# Teaching quality important
## Western culture course must be rewarding 
###

On Dec. 1 the Faculty Senate re
ceived the preliminary report of the
Task Force on Western Culture. The
six-page report proposed a rationale
for requiring the study of western cul
ture at Stanford and recommended a
course centered around small classes
that emphasized intellectual and polit
ical texts from classical Greece to
twentieth-century Europe.
The commitment demanded by stu
dents in this course, or probably any
course in western culture, is substan
tial. rhe sequence of three five-unit
courses means students would devote a
third of their freshman or sophomore
years, at minimal, to prescribed course
work ip western culture. And unless
altered by the Faculty Senate, these 15
units would be in addition to the writ
ing requirement and the distribution
requirements in the social sciences, the
humanities, and in natural sciences/
mathematics/technology.
Adding a 15-unit requirement in
western culture poses particular prob
lems for those students with already
crammed schedules. Engineering stu
dents are the most obvious example.
Each student in the School of Engineer
ing is required to take a minimum of

122 units in the school. When the writ
ing requirement and distribution re
quirements (6 and 18 units, respec
tively) are added to the school re
quirements and a western culture re
quirement, most engineering majors
would have to fulfill a minimum of 161
units of requirements out of the 180
units needed for graduation.
Scheduling problems, however, are
not insurmountable. One solution is to
allow the western culture requirement
to fulfill the humanities requirement
for engineering majors. Or another
possibility would be to redefine the dis
tribution requirements for all students
such that the western culture course
would not mean any addition in the
number of units required for gradua
tion. But nonetheless, these potential
problems illustrate the commitment
students would make to accommo
date a required western culture
course in their undergraduate prog
rams.
Under these circumstances, it seems
natural enough that a proposed cur
ricular requirement in western culture
should be among Stanford's best
courses. The western culture should be
among Stanford's best courses. The

western culture course would be un
ique among general requirements since
students would be unable to choose
from among a wide variety of courses
as they can in the writing and distribu
tion requirements. Instead, for better
or worse, all students would be forced
to take one course. Consequently, ex
pectations for a course in western cul
ture must be extraordinarily high.
Teaching quality
To ensure the quality of the course
teaching is all important. It's not dif
ficult to understand why students are
reluctant to sacrifice elective courses
for a required course in western cul
ture that they suspect would probably
be either poorly taught by inexperi
enced teaching assistants or given
thorough unbearable lectures in Mem
•Aud.
All the high-sounding ideals, ration
al, and objectives heard the past few
years in favorof a requirement in west
ern culture (like the need to supply stu
dents with an "historical dimension," a
balanced curriculum; and a critical
appreciation, and, at least, an informal
acquaintance with western culture)
would be lost in a course that could not
exact the active and enthusiastic par
ticipation of most students.
Working from this premise—that a
course should, in the end, be judged by
the quality of attention it exacts from
students—leads, almost inevitably, to
small classes. By its nature a small class
is the best'place to get the greatest at
tention. It encourages discussion, orig
inal thinking, and most importantly, a
personal involvement with the subject.
And as the Task Force noted in its re
port, the freshman year often does not
include a meaningful small-class ex
perience.
Small classes
But small classes are no panacea.
They are expensive, both in financial
terms and in teaching allocation. The
85 seminars needed to accommodate
1700 students has been estimated to
cost between $500,000 and $800,000
annually by the task force. These fi
gures have cooled many administrators
and some faculty to the recommended
course.
Another criticism of the small classes
suggested by the task force is that they
exchange an expert —the lecturer in a
large class — for a "non-specialist."
Since 85 seminars require at least 40
teachers and since there are not that
many specialists at Stanford in the
material of any quarter of the recom
mended course, by necessity, teachers
will have to lead small classes outside
of their specialty. For example, an En
glish professor whose specialty is
Shakespeare may teach a small class in
the classics.

Frustrated? If it were only a question
of whether small classes, with their po
tential forgiving the student the oppor
tunity for an active engagement with
the subject or lectures, with distin
guished professors directing students
through analysis of different aspects of
western culture, the debate would be
relatively simple. Unfortunately, the
issue is not so black and white but
smeared in gray.
Financial reasons
Small classes are opposed primarily,
but not exclusively, for financial
reasons. The faculty interest in teach
ing a course in western culture that was
interdisciplinary and taught in small
classes has been disappointing. Many
faculty complain that a small class is
the most difficult teaching situation.
Others fear teaching outside of their
specialty and believe students would
be shortchanged in this format.
Equally imposing are the disadvan
tages of a lecture format. Besides for
feiting the chance for original thinking
that most often occurs in a well-led
discussion, lectures mean piling at least
850 students (if each lecture was given
twice) into some auditorium for an im
personal, and what would probably
often be an unproductive 50 minutes.
But there is another problem: who is
an expert in western culture? With the
possible exception of the first quarter
in the classics it seems doubtful that
anyone could possibly have the exper
tise in western culture over the ex
tended chronological periods and
range of subjects covered in a course
on western culture.

The second quarter of the recom
mended course, for example, begins in
400 A.D. and ends in 1750, covering
thinkers like St. Augustine, Dante,
Machiavelli, I uther, Shakespeare,
Galileo, Descartes and Locke. And if
different professors lectured on each
thinker the continuity of the course
would be shattered.
Other choices
Deciding whether to opt for small
classes or lectures is not, of course, the
only question. Other choices have to
be made such as whether to include'
coverage of non-western cultures, the
United States, and the role of technol
ogy in western culture. But the effec
tiveness of the course depends on the
quality of the teaching dictated by the
course format.
After the Committee on Under
graduate Studies receives the final re
port from the Task Force on Western
Culture later this month or in early Feb
ruary, CUS will prepare its own re
commendations to submit to the Fa
culty Senate for their action.
Whatever is decided by the Faculty
Senate, explicit and sound educational
reasons within financial realities must
be the basis of the choice. No cheap,
easy, or intellectually lazy way out can
be endorsed. If students are to be asked
to commit a year to the study of west
ern culture, then faculty and adminis
trators must commit themselves to
providing the essential teaching and fi
nancial support to ensure a rewarding,
well-taught, educational experience.
