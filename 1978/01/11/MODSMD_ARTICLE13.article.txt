Quote
In Monday's Daily I was quoted as
saying that "The trustees do wish to
vote on proxy issues in a way that will
maximize profits." That's not what I
said, though I can understand how con
fusion can arise on complex and emo
tionally charged issues.
The fact of the matter is that while
maximization of total investment re
turn consistent with risk is their "prim
ary fiduciary responsibility," the trus
tees will give "independent weight" to
social responsibility issues. My state
ment paraphrased this, and added that
the modified investment responsibility
guidelines speak quite positively to
proxy voting.

Business and Finance
(Editor's Note: The sentence Massy

refers to is not a direct quote but a
paraphrase of his comments, and was
presented this way in the story. News
Editor Kurt Cobb recorded Massy's
comments when he was asked to
comment on a statement by ASSU
Co-President Anne Henkels concern
ing the guidelines adopted by Uni
versity trustees for a new Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility.
Henkels said the guidelines "totally
subordinate social responsibility to
the maximization of profit." Massy,
in his interview with Cobb, said,
"This is certainly true with respect to
proxy voting.")
Misleading headline
The Daily's headline over the re
view of the Palo Alto Community
Theatre Theatrework's production of
Oliver (Jan. 9) distressed me because

I had seen the musical New Year's
Eve and was delighted with it. As I
read on, I decided the reviewer hit
the nail on the head â€” at any rate, I
was in agreement with what he had
to say. Occasionally it did seem like
an amateur production, which it was,
but I have attended professional
productions which were not as well
done. It was really an excellent
show!
My complaint is that the Daily
made the same mistake as did the
Palo Alto Times in their review: the
Daily gave a headline that was mis
leading, in that it didn't really express
the 'gist' of the review. A better head
line might have been taken from the
last paragraph of the review: "An O
liver' well worth seeing!"
