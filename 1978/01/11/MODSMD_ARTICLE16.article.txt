# 1980 census costs to more than quadruple
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Cen
sus Bureau, which spent about
$1 per American in compiling
the 1970 census, says it will
spend more than four times
that amount to do the job in
1980.
Inflation and a larger popula
tion can be blamed for part of
the increased costs, bureau di
rector Manuel Plotkin says. But
the critical reason is that the
bureau is making a special ef
fort to reach groups such as the
poor and minorities which
have been undercounted in
the past.
Plotkin said it is difficult to
convey to poor, uneducated
people the importance of re
sponding to the census, which
for the first time will include
questions about income and
ethnic origin.
But he added that "the cen

sus has an impact on every
American. It determines the
seats in the House of Rep
resentatives."
He also noted that census in
formation is used to determine
how much federal money goes
to local communities.
And although the census
form takes time to complete,
"there is no question that will
do people any harm. It's com
pletely confidential, and none
of the information can go to
any other government
agency," Plotkin said.
The 1970 census, which mea
sured a population of 204 mill
ion, cost $210 million, census
officials said. The 1980 census
is expected to measure about
220 million Americans and cost
about $900 million.
Plotkin said the 1970 census
undercounted the number of

Americans by 2Vi percent, or
5.3 million persons. Of these,
an estimated 3.4 million whites
and 1.9 million blacks were not
counted.
He said 200 field workers —
10 times the number in 1970 —
will be hired in 1980 to help
minority groups complete the
census forms in an effort to
remedy this problem.
Under law, there is a fine of
up to $100 for willfully neglect
ing to respond to the census
questionnaire.
Plotkin said that around April
1, 1980, every American

household will receive by mail
a census form with such ques
tions as sex, race, marital
status, number of children,
educational background, oc
cupation, quality of housing,
plumbing facilities and
appliances owned.
About 80 percent of the
population will receive the
short form, which has 19 ques
tions and takes approximately
15 minutes to complete. The
other 20 percent will receive
the long form, which has about
75 questions and takes about
45 minutes to complete.

officials said. The 1980 census
is expected to measure about
220 million Americans and cost
about $900 million.
Plotkin said the 1970 census
undercounted the number of

Americans by 2Vi percent, or
5.3 million persons. Of these,
an estimated 3.4 million whites
and 1.9 million blacks were not
counted.
He said 200 field workers —
10 times the number in 1970 —
will be hired in 1980 to help
minority groups complete the
census forms in an effort to
remedy this problem.
Under law, there is a fine of
up to $100 for willfully neglect
ing to respond to the census
questionnaire.
Plotkin said that around April
1, 1980, every American

household will receive by mail
a census form with such ques
tions as sex, race, marital
status, number of children,
educational background, oc
cupation, quality of housing,
plumbing facilities and
appliances owned.
About 80 percent of the
population will receive the
short form, which has 19 ques
tions and takes approximately
15 minutes to complete. The
other 20 percent will receive
the long form, which has about
75 questions and takes about
45 minutes to complete.
Washington (AP) — The Cen
sus Bureau, which spent about
$1 per American in compiling
the 1970 census, says it will
spend more than four times
that amount to do the job in
1980.
Inflation and a larger popula
tion can be blamed for part of
the increased costs, bureau di
rector Manuel Plotkin says. But
the critical reason is that the
bureau is making a special ef
fort to reach groups such as the
poor and minorities which
have been undercounted in
the past.
Plotkin said it is difficult to
convey to poor, uneducated
people the importance of re
sponding to the census, which
for the first time will include
questions about income and
ethnic origin.
But he added that "the cen

sus has an impact on every
American. It determines the
seats in the House of Rep
resentatives."
He also noted that census in
formation is used to determine
how much federal money goes
to local communities.
And although the census
form takes time to complete,
"there is no question that will
do people any harm. It's com
pletely confidential, and none
of the information can go to
any other government
agency," Plotkin said.
The 1970 census, which mea
sured a population of 204 mill
ion, cost $210 million, census
officials said. The 1980 census
is expected to measure about
220 million Americans and cost
about $900 million.
