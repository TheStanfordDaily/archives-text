# No minimum wage rise for California youths

### 
Sacramento (AP) — The minimum wage for at
least a million adult Californians is Scheduled to
rise t052.65 an hour on April 1, but the minimum
for most minors will remain at $2.15, a state
commission said Tuesday.
About 2 million of California's 9.35 million
job-holders are paid at or slightly above the
minimum wage, officials say.
That wage is $2.50 an hour for workers under
state jurisdiction. But on Jan. 1 it was raised to
$2.65 an hour for those under federal jurisdic
tion — employees of companies engaged in in
terstate commerce, or of retail operations doing
more than $250,000 worth of business in a year.
State Industrial Relations Department
spokesman Gene Cresci said from 750,000 to 1
million Californians making the minimum wage
are under federal jurisdiction, and get their
raises |an. 1.

Other workers must wait until the state In
dustrial Welfare Commission completes hear
ings and orders an increase in the state
minimum. A state law passed last year says
California's minimum wage must be at least as
high as the federal minimum.
The commission conducted its second of
three hearings Tuesday and said it would issue
an order after the third hearing Jan. 19 that
would put the new wage into effect April 1, after
a legally required waiting period.
For most workers the raise will be 15 cents an
hour. But for some it will be 65 cents, and others
will get no raise at all.
When the commission raised the state
minimum to $2.50 in October 1976, it exempted
minors and unskilled, first-time "learner"
workers, for whom the minimum was set at
$2.15.
