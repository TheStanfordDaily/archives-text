# FBI reveals Hoover accepted special favors

### 
Washington (AP) â€” The Jus
tice Department yesterday ac
cused the late FBI Director ).
Edgar Hoover of accepting
special favors and services
from FBI employees.
It also said in a 40-page re
port that the long-time director
took part with other former FBI
officials in a pattern of
longstanding and widespread
abuses of FBI services.
Hoover, who died in 1972 at
the age of 77, was said to have
accepted favors that ranged
from additions to his home to
servicing of his lawnmower
and snow blower.
"Clocks were reset, metal
polished, wallpaper re

touched, firewood provided
and furniture rearranged," the
report said. "Employees were
on call night and day for this
work."
Hoover also got free tax ad
vice from a bureau accountant
and members of the FBl's
Exhibits Section were called
upon to build gifts each year
for Hoover on Christinas, his
service anniversary with the
agency and other special occa
sions, the report alleged.
Similar and related charges
also were alleged against a
number of other former top
FBI officials.
But the department said no
civil court action was con
templated against any of these
persons since the statute of
limitations may have run out
and since "the actual amounts
involved are small compared to
the expense of litigation."
Most of the allegations in the
report had been previously re
ported by the news media.
However, this was the first time
that the Justice Department
has published its version of the
events. The department spent
more than two years looking
into the allegations.
The report said that the gifts
for Hoover included tables,
display cases, cabinets, a bar
and valets. It said assistant di
rectors chipped in to pay for
materials but the workers who

built the presents were never
compensated.
"FBI employees called upon
to perform these services did
not think them proper but felt
compelled to follow orders for
fear of losing their jobs, or of
arbitrary transfers or promo
tion delays," the report said.
Attorney General Griffin Bell
said in a statement accompany
ing the report that "This report
will confirm that very few indi
viduals engaged in improper
conduct." But he issued a
warning to all FBI officials that
he would not "tolerate the
kind of misuse of office or
abuse of authority described in
this report."
The report mentions the
previously disclosed incidents
involving current FBI director
Clarence Kelley, who accepted
two sets of window valances
made and installed by FBI
employees. Kelley has reim
bursed the agency for the cost
of the valances and has re
turned two television sets that
were purchased by the FBl's
radio engineering section for
his Washington apartment.
The report notes that Kelley,
who is retiring next month, was
not involved in any of the other
matters detailed in the report.
While the report described
extensive abuses, it noted that
there was no evidence of brib
ery.
