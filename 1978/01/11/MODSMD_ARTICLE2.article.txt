# University opposes tuition tax credit bill

A bill is being opposed by the Uni
versity that would provide tax credits
for tuition expenses.
The College Tuition Tax Relief Act
(S-311), introduced by Senator Wil
liam Roth (R-Del.) last )an. 18, would
create a tax credit to cover educa
tional expenses of up to $250 in 1977,
$300 in 1978, $400 in 1979, and $500 in
1980 and thereafter.
Larry Horton, assistant director of

government relations, said the Uni
versity's primary objection to the bill
is that "it is an extremely inefficient
way of allocating money to higher
education.
"The Roth bill is particularly bad
because not only will it be an enorm
ous drain on the treasury, but it will
also be hard to monitor the funds
given out. It will also be easy to de
fraud the government," said Horton.
Financial Aids Director Robert Huff

said, "It really doesn't give Stanford
parents very much help. The bill
doesn't provide much relief, and it
could reduce aid at both the federal
and the state level. It's very expen
sive but ineffective."
Horton said there would be "a neg
ligible positive effect on Stanford
students" if the bill passes. "I expect
some type of action early next
month," said Horton. "The potential
for abuse if it is passed is enormous,"

he said.
The American Council on Educa
tion (ACE) estimates that the Roth bill
will cost the government $1.5 billion
if passed in 1978. "There are other
traditional ways of spending that
much money in the form of loans or
grants that would be more effec
tive," said Horton.
Bruce Thompson, legislative assis
tant to Roth, said that hearings will be
held on the bill )an. 18-20. At that
time the Senate Finance Committee
will decide whether or not to re
commend the bill separately for pas
sage or try to tack it on to President
)immy Carter's upcoming tax prop
osals.
"Passage of this bill will not lessen
congressional support for financial
aids programs," said Thompson.
"This is not an either/or situation as
many college administrators are try
ing to view it. The bill is aimed at
l)elping to ease the load for middle
income tax payers. They are the ones
supporting financial aids programs
and yet they are receiving the least
benefit from them," he said.
"This bill is eeared to help people
