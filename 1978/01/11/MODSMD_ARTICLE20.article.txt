# Tax cuts, hospital funding top state's election-year budget
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — Gov. Jerry Brown un
veiled a record-breaking $17.4 billion state
spending program yesterday that prom
ises money for futuristic space and energy
programs and tax cuts for 7.9 million
homeowners and renters.
In his budget message, the Democratic
governor's "era of limits" warnings of past
years were replaced this year by a promise
that California "is still a land of dreams."
He said his proposal was "a budget that
builds for the future" with new programs
to plant millions of trees, provide money
for solar, wind and geothermal power, and
create a new state space institute.
The 1249-page document sent to the
Legislature yesterday is an election year
budget, containing an eight-point prog
ram aimed specifically at campaign issues
such as taxes, crime, energy and mental
health.
Brown said his budget can be financed
without new across-the-board taxes be
cause of California's robust economic
boom, which has generated an estimated
$3.21 billion surplus.
He asked the Legislature to use that
surplus to finance a $1 billion annual tax
cut for 4.3 million California homeowners
and 3.6 million renters.
Brown also asked for $100 million to
build one or more new state prisons with
"2400 cells somewhere in California," plus
another $3.6 million to hire 183 additional
prison personnel to combat drugs and
gangs.
He requested a $127 million boost in
state hospital and community mental
health funds. Those are the programs
which have become the most embarras
sing problem of the Brown administration,
largely because of Brown's tight lid on ex
penditures.
In the budget, Brown proposed pay
raises average 6.6 percent for state

employees and welfare grant increases of
7.07 percent.
The budget proposes an increase of 3000
employees in the state's 138,000-person
civil service work force, mostly in anti
crime and mental health programs.
Potentially one of the most controversial
items in the budget is a $34 million approp
riation to pay for the estimated 70,000
Medi-Cal abortions for which the federal
government has cut off funds.
The spending package consists of a
$16.2 billion budget bill to finance most
state programs and a $1.2 billion reserve
for companion bills granting property tax
relief and creating new state programs in
energy development, conservation, re
forestation and housing.
If adopted as Brown proposed it, the
fiscal plan would boost state spending by
15.8 percent, a single year boost of $2.36
billion. ,
That represents a record-high per capita
state tax burden of $784 for each of
California's 22 million residents, or $3136
in sales, income, gasoline, cigarette and
other taxes for the average California fam
ily of four.
The current per capita cost of California
government is $687.
That big boost in per capita taxes can
occur without a tax rate increase because
of what state Finance Director Roy Bell de
scribed as "phenomenally high" increases
in business activity, taxable sales, corpo
rate profits and personal income.
While the state's population grew only
by 1.4 percent during the past year, per
sonal income went up 12.5 percent, taxa
ble sales increased by 19 percent and per
sonal income tax receipt went up 21.9 per
cent as millions of Californians moved into
higher tax brackets.
Bell predicted the state's economic
growth would slow some during the next

year, but that 1978 will still be "really a
good year" as the boom economy of 1977
"slows down to normal."
The biggest part of the new budget
proposal goes to finance the traditional
state programs: $4.98 billion for health
and welfare, $5.81 billion for education
programs from kindergarten through col
lege, $1.01 billion for highways.
The budget bill looks to the 21st century
with a $5.8 million appropriation to put
equipment for state use on a communica
tions satellite intended for launch in 1980
and with $500,000 for a space institute at
the University of California.
Brown said the space institute would at
tract scientists to California who in turn
would attract more space industries.
He said California "is at the crossroads"
and space technology "is where the future
is. As it goes up, I want California to be a
part of it."
Brown also said the budget puts aside
funds to make a state grant of $25 million
to help finance a $293 million coal gasifica
tion power plant planned by Southern
California Edison.
But he said the details have not been
worked out as to whether that would be a
loan, a grant or an investment by the state.
Other new proposals in Brown's 1978-79
budget would provide $200 million over
the next four to five years to insulate and
remodel public buildings to cut energy
use in what Brown expansively described
as "the boldest commitment ever made by
a state" to energy programs.
Another proposal would appropriate $5
million for grants for solar energy de
monstration projects.
About $70 million has been slated for a
five-year plan to plant 300,000 acres of
trees in what was described as the biggest
program of its kind ever undertaken by a
state.

funds to make a state grant of $25 million
to help finance a $293 million coal gasifica
tion power plant planned by Southern
California Edison.
But he said the details have not been
worked out as to whether that would be a
loan, a grant or an investment by the state.
Other new proposals in Brown's 1978-79
budget would provide $200 million over
the next four to five years to insulate and
remodel public buildings to cut energy
use in what Brown expansively described
as "the boldest commitment ever made by
a state" to energy programs.
Another proposal would appropriate $5
million for grants for solar energy de
monstration projects.
About $70 million has been slated for a
five-year plan to plant 300,000 acres of
trees in what was described as the biggest
program of its kind ever undertaken by a
state.
Sacramento (AP) — Gov. Jerry Brown un
veiled a record-breaking $17.4 billion state
spending program yesterday that prom
ises money for futuristic space and energy
programs and tax cuts for 7.9 million
homeowners and renters.
In his budget message, the Democratic
governor's "era of limits" warnings of past
years were replaced this year by a promise
that California "is still a land of dreams."
He said his proposal was "a budget that
builds for the future" with new programs
to plant millions of trees, provide money
for solar, wind and geothermal power, and
create a new state space institute.
The 1249-page document sent to the
Legislature yesterday is an election year
budget, containing an eight-point prog
ram aimed specifically at campaign issues
such as taxes, crime, energy and mental
health.
Brown said his budget can be financed
without new across-the-board taxes be
cause of California's robust economic
boom, which has generated an estimated
$3.21 billion surplus.
He asked the Legislature to use that
surplus to finance a $1 billion annual tax
cut for 4.3 million California homeowners
and 3.6 million renters.
Brown also asked for $100 million to
build one or more new state prisons with
"2400 cells somewhere in California," plus
another $3.6 million to hire 183 additional
prison personnel to combat drugs and
gangs.
He requested a $127 million boost in
state hospital and community mental
health funds. Those are the programs
which have become the most embarras
sing problem of the Brown administration,
largely because of Brown's tight lid on ex
penditures.
In the budget, Brown proposed pay
raises average 6.6 percent for state

employees and welfare grant increases of
7.07 percent.
The budget proposes an increase of 3000
employees in the state's 138,000-person
civil service work force, mostly in anti
crime and mental health programs.
Potentially one of the most controversial
items in the budget is a $34 million approp
riation to pay for the estimated 70,000
Medi-Cal abortions for which the federal
government has cut off funds.
The spending package consists of a
$16.2 billion budget bill to finance most
state programs and a $1.2 billion reserve
for companion bills granting property tax
relief and creating new state programs in
energy development, conservation, re
forestation and housing.
If adopted as Brown proposed it, the
fiscal plan would boost state spending by
15.8 percent, a single year boost of $2.36
billion. ,
That represents a record-high per capita
state tax burden of $784 for each of
California's 22 million residents, or $3136
in sales, income, gasoline, cigarette and
other taxes for the average California fam
ily of four.
The current per capita cost of California
government is $687.
That big boost in per capita taxes can
occur without a tax rate increase because
of what state Finance Director Roy Bell de
scribed as "phenomenally high" increases
in business activity, taxable sales, corpo
rate profits and personal income.
While the state's population grew only
by 1.4 percent during the past year, per
sonal income went up 12.5 percent, taxa
ble sales increased by 19 percent and per
sonal income tax receipt went up 21.9 per
cent as millions of Californians moved into
higher tax brackets.
Bell predicted the state's economic
growth would slow some during the next

year, but that 1978 will still be "really a
good year" as the boom economy of 1977
"slows down to normal."
The biggest part of the new budget
proposal goes to finance the traditional
state programs: $4.98 billion for health
and welfare, $5.81 billion for education
programs from kindergarten through col
lege, $1.01 billion for highways.
The budget bill looks to the 21st century
with a $5.8 million appropriation to put
equipment for state use on a communica
tions satellite intended for launch in 1980
and with $500,000 for a space institute at
the University of California.
Brown said the space institute would at
tract scientists to California who in turn
would attract more space industries.
He said California "is at the crossroads"
and space technology "is where the future
is. As it goes up, I want California to be a
part of it."

"slows down to normal."
The biggest part of the new budget
proposal goes to finance the traditional
state programs: $4.98 billion for health
and welfare, $5.81 billion for education
programs from kindergarten through col
lege, $1.01 billion for highways.
The budget bill looks to the 21st century
with a $5.8 million appropriation to put
equipment for state use on a communica
tions satellite intended for launch in 1980
and with $500,000 for a space institute at
the University of California.
Brown said the space institute would at
tract scientists to California who in turn
would attract more space industries.
He said California "is at the crossroads"
and space technology "is where the future
is. As it goes up, I want California to be a
part of it."
Brown also said the budget puts aside
funds to make a state grant of $25 million
to help finance a $293 million coal gasifica
tion power plant planned by Southern
California Edison.
But he said the details have not been
worked out as to whether that would be a
loan, a grant or an investment by the state.
Other new proposals in Brown's 1978-79
budget would provide $200 million over
the next four to five years to insulate and
remodel public buildings to cut energy
use in what Brown expansively described
as "the boldest commitment ever made by
a state" to energy programs.
Another proposal would appropriate $5
million for grants for solar energy de
monstration projects.
About $70 million has been slated for a
five-year plan to plant 300,000 acres of
trees in what was described as the biggest
program of its kind ever undertaken by a
state.
Sacramento (AP) — Gov. Jerry Brown un
veiled a record-breaking $17.4 billion state
spending program yesterday that prom
ises money for futuristic space and energy
programs and tax cuts for 7.9 million
homeowners and renters.
In his budget message, the Democratic
governor's "era of limits" warnings of past
years were replaced this year by a promise
that California "is still a land of dreams."
He said his proposal was "a budget that
builds for the future" with new programs
to plant millions of trees, provide money
for solar, wind and geothermal power, and
create a new state space institute.
The 1249-page document sent to the
Legislature yesterday is an election year
budget, containing an eight-point prog
ram aimed specifically at campaign issues
such as taxes, crime, energy and mental
health.
Brown said his budget can be financed
without new across-the-board taxes be
cause of California's robust economic
boom, which has generated an estimated
$3.21 billion surplus.
He asked the Legislature to use that
surplus to finance a $1 billion annual tax
cut for 4.3 million California homeowners
and 3.6 million renters.
Brown also asked for $100 million to
build one or more new state prisons with
"2400 cells somewhere in California," plus
another $3.6 million to hire 183 additional
prison personnel to combat drugs and
gangs.
He requested a $127 million boost in
state hospital and community mental
health funds. Those are the programs
which have become the most embarras
sing problem of the Brown administration,
largely because of Brown's tight lid on ex
penditures.
In the budget, Brown proposed pay
raises average 6.6 percent for state

employees and welfare grant increases of
7.07 percent.
The budget proposes an increase of 3000
employees in the state's 138,000-person
civil service work force, mostly in anti
crime and mental health programs.
Potentially one of the most controversial
items in the budget is a $34 million approp
riation to pay for the estimated 70,000
Medi-Cal abortions for which the federal
government has cut off funds.
The spending package consists of a
$16.2 billion budget bill to finance most
state programs and a $1.2 billion reserve
for companion bills granting property tax
relief and creating new state programs in
energy development, conservation, re
forestation and housing.
If adopted as Brown proposed it, the
fiscal plan would boost state spending by
15.8 percent, a single year boost of $2.36
billion. ,
That represents a record-high per capita
state tax burden of $784 for each of
California's 22 million residents, or $3136
in sales, income, gasoline, cigarette and
other taxes for the average California fam
ily of four.
The current per capita cost of California
government is $687.
That big boost in per capita taxes can
occur without a tax rate increase because
of what state Finance Director Roy Bell de
scribed as "phenomenally high" increases
in business activity, taxable sales, corpo
rate profits and personal income.
While the state's population grew only
by 1.4 percent during the past year, per
sonal income went up 12.5 percent, taxa
ble sales increased by 19 percent and per
sonal income tax receipt went up 21.9 per
cent as millions of Californians moved into
higher tax brackets.
Bell predicted the state's economic
growth would slow some during the next

year, but that 1978 will still be "really a
good year" as the boom economy of 1977
"slows down to normal."
