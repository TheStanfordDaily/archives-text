### Paulette Truman 
He has done everything from earning a
Stanford Ph.D. in philosophy to selling used
cars. He is a part-time bartender, functional
integration therapist (similar to a physical
therapist), martial arts (aikido) teacher, and is
adding one more unusual pastime to his list.
Marty Weiner — personable, pensive and
friendly — will be teaching an ASSU
sponsored bartending class. The class meets
at 3 p.m. each Wednesday starting today for
two and a half hours.
It is a special non-credit class with a fee of
$35 to $40. ASSU advertises it as a class "to
take just for fun" but according to Weiner,
"they'll (students) come out of there with a
skill which they'll be able to use."
The syllabus of the course involves how to
prepare garnishes, how to take an order —
from a customer or cocktail waitress— relat
ing to customers, preparing drink recipes
and learning dice games.
Weiner's bartending course will provide
not only classroom training but also behind
the-bar experience. He plans to eventually
hold his weekly class at the jumping Frog
Saloon in the Old Mill Shopping Center, the
bar where he works.
"Being a good bartender is like conducting
a symphony," Weiner said. According to
Weiner, bartending is a good skill to learn
since there is not a lot of competition and the
pay is good. Besides receiving a salary, a bar
tender can earn quite a bit of money through
tips.
Another advantage to the job, Weiner said,
is "you're constantly meeting new people."
Through one customer at the bar, Weiner
got a job as a car salesman.
"But I got bored with that." After six weeks
he went back to bartending.
"It's a lot of fun. You meet people and
there are always a lot of ladies."

Bartending can give a person a tremendous
amount of self-assurance, Weiner said. "I've
seen people who were shy and after they
started bartending, they gained confidence
and improved their ability to relate to
others."
People's impression of the bartender's role
has always one of a good listener, a
counselor.
"People come in to bars for a variety of
reasons. It's like a watering hole. Some come
because they're lonely. Sometimes people
come in because they are really desperate
and are even suicidal or are depressed.
"But I get bored when people come in
ready to bitch and who use the bartender to
bitch at," said Weiner.
How did Weiner, a Ph.D. in philosophy,
decide to disregard his college education and
become a bartender, among his other un
usual occupations?
"After I got my degree, I said 'What the hell
do I know?' I was still fairly ignorant about
living so I decided to start over again."
Weiner worked for two years in the office
of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies at
Stanford. He then became interested in func
tional integration therapy, a type of therapy
which re-educates a person's nervous sys
tem. He currently has his own practice.
Weiner said before getting involved in all
this, "I felt I didn't know anything. I realized I
could start all over again or I could remain an
academician and kind of live happily ever
after— I cou!d get up in front of a class, speak
pompously, retire at 65, and do the whole
act.
"All my training in philosophy taught me
about truth and the nature of reality. I knew it
was a lot of bullshit that I had learned here so
I knew I couldn't turn around and teach it to
other people. That would be total hypocrisy
and fraud," he said.

Weiner said before getting involved in all
this, "I felt I didn't know anything. I realized I
could start all over again or I could remain an
academician and kind of live happily ever
after— I cou!d get up in front of a class, speak
pompously, retire at 65, and do the whole
act.
"All my training in philosophy taught me
about truth and the nature of reality. I knew it
was a lot of bullshit that I had learned here so
I knew I couldn't turn around and teach it to
other people. That would be total hypocrisy
and fraud," he said.

He has done everything from earning a
Stanford Ph.D. in philosophy to selling used
cars. He is a part-time bartender, functional
integration therapist (similar to a physical
therapist), martial arts (aikido) teacher, and is
adding one more unusual pastime to his list.
Marty Weiner — personable, pensive and
friendly — will be teaching an ASSU
sponsored bartending class. The class meets
at 3 p.m. each Wednesday starting today for
two and a half hours.
It is a special non-credit class with a fee of
$35 to $40. ASSU advertises it as a class "to
take just for fun" but according to Weiner,
"they'll (students) come out of there with a
skill which they'll be able to use."
The syllabus of the course involves how to
prepare garnishes, how to take an order —
from a customer or cocktail waitress— relat
ing to customers, preparing drink recipes
and learning dice games.
Weiner's bartending course will provide
not only classroom training but also behind
the-bar experience. He plans to eventually
hold his weekly class at the jumping Frog
Saloon in the Old Mill Shopping Center, the
bar where he works.
"Being a good bartender is like conducting
a symphony," Weiner said. According to
Weiner, bartending is a good skill to learn
since there is not a lot of competition and the
pay is good. Besides receiving a salary, a bar
tender can earn quite a bit of money through
tips.
Another advantage to the job, Weiner said,
is "you're constantly meeting new people."
Through one customer at the bar, Weiner
got a job as a car salesman.
"But I got bored with that." After six weeks
he went back to bartending.
"It's a lot of fun. You meet people and
there are always a lot of ladies."

Bartending can give a person a tremendous
amount of self-assurance, Weiner said. "I've
seen people who were shy and after they
started bartending, they gained confidence
and improved their ability to relate to
others."
People's impression of the bartender's role
has always one of a good listener, a
counselor.
"People come in to bars for a variety of
reasons. It's like a watering hole. Some come
because they're lonely. Sometimes people
come in because they are really desperate
and are even suicidal or are depressed.
"But I get bored when people come in
ready to bitch and who use the bartender to
bitch at," said Weiner.
How did Weiner, a Ph.D. in philosophy,
decide to disregard his college education and
become a bartender, among his other un
usual occupations?
"After I got my degree, I said 'What the hell
do I know?' I was still fairly ignorant about
living so I decided to start over again."
Weiner worked for two years in the office
of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies at
Stanford. He then became interested in func
tional integration therapy, a type of therapy
which re-educates a person's nervous sys
tem. He currently has his own practice.
