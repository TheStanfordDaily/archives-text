"We'll be the team to beat in
the northern conference,"
coach Dottie McCrea said after
the Stanford women's basket
ball team defeated UC-Davis,
88-4J3, last night in Maples Pavil
ion.
Despite having taken a beat
ing from experienced southern
California teams last weekend,
Stanford entered last night's
contest a poised and confident
team. Sparked by forward
Stephanie Galef's shooting
hand, the Cards gained an
early lead which they main
tained throughout the game,
dominating a team which had
defeated them by nine points
earlier in the season. "Stanford
shot 10 times better this
game," Pam Gill, the Davis
coach, commented.
Guards Peggy Bruggman and
Beth Boylan moved the ball

well on the outside and made
smart passes to forwards Mag
gie Nelson and Kathy Murphy.
Murphy, the freshman recruit
from Pennsylvania provided
the bulk of the scoring by
muscling in 30 points off drives
and rebounds. Nelson added
17 to the Cards' highest scoring
game to date.
High scorers for Davis were
junior Pam Martin and sopho
more Laura Fumagalli, who
both put in 12 points. "The kids
weren't psyched because of
the mix-up with the referees,"
coach Gill said. The game got
off to a fate start when the
scheduled referees did not
show and two volunteers from
the crowd were called upon to
officiate. Consequently, the
Davis coach labeled the game
"a scrimmage."
Stanford spirits were high in
spite of the problems and the
game will be a boost in confi
dence as the Card women pre
pare to meet Fullerton State,
Friday, Jan. 13 in Maples at 7:30
p.m.
Coach McCrea attributed
the fine performance to the
experience the Cards gained
during their tough weekend in
Los Angeles. Cal Poly-
Pomona's roster, averaging
6-foot-2 per player, represent
a well developed basketball
program which McCrea said is
three years ahead of Stanford's
program.
Although Stanford lost to
Cal-Poly Pomona by 40 points,
it came within four points of a
tough Fullerton State team.
This continued improvement
of the Stanford women was in
dicated by last night's rout of
Davis.
