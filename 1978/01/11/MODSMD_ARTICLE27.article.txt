# Cougs bounce to Maples

The loser shall be last.
Actually, the loser of to
morrow's Pacific-8 basket
ball game between Stanford
and Washington State will
be only tied for last. But an
0-3 start in conference play
for either tht Cards or the
Cougars could make tem
pers short and optimism un
founded.
Both teams entered the
conference schedule with
records to justify predic
tions for success. But the
Cougars, 8-4 in nonconfer
ence, dropped their home
opener to USC, 68-65, and
then were dusted by UCLA,
70-55, Sunday in Pullman.
Stanford, meanwhile, lost
twice in Oregon last
weekend.
WSU coach George Ravel
ing has centered this sea

son's team around the big
men in the middle. The
biggest of them is 7-foot-2,
275 lbs. James Donaldson.
"The only thing we have at
Stanford that's bigger than
Donaldson is Hoover To
wer," said Cardinal coach
Dick Dißiaso. Donaldson's
averaging 13 points a game,
eighth best in the Pac-8, and
is the conference's best re
bounder with an 11.1 aver
age.
Assisting Donaldson in
the Cougars' double-post
offense will be either 6-11
Stuart House, who scored
19 points in his last visit to
Maples Pavilion, or 6-8 John
Preston.
But the Cougs don't rely
solely on their big men.
"They fast break," said Di-
Biaso. "(Wing Don) Collins
and the two guards push the

ball up the court pretty
fast."
Defensively, though, the
Cougs' height in the middle
could pose problems for the
Cards' offense. "Our zone
offense will have to make
some adjustments against
their big men," said Di-
Biaso.
According to Dißiaso,
WSU uses multiple de
fenses, most of which are
some type of a zone. "You
need to have an inside
outside game against a
zone,"hesaid, "orelsethey
jam it up more and more on
the inside."
Most of Stanford's scor
ing comes from the inside,
where forward Kimberly
Belton, fourth in the Pac-8
with a 15.3 average, oper
ates.
