Israelis occupy West Bank
Jerusalem — The government won final approval
yesterday for three new and potentially controver
sial Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank
of the lordan River. The go-ahead came one day
before Egypt and Israel begin the next stage of
peace negotiations.
The parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs
Committee voted 14-9 to override an attempt by a
moderate minority faction in Prime Minister
Menahem Begin's coalition government to halt
the settlement plan.
President Sadat has said "not a single Israeli"
can remain on Arab lands after peace. Israel's
Begin is equally adamant that the settlements will
stay.
The peace dialogue enters a new phase today
when the defense ministers of Israel and Egypt —
Ezer Weizman and Mohammed Abdel Ghany
Gamassy — meet in Cairo for negotiations dealing
primarily with the return of the Sinai Peninsula to
Egypt.
FDA wants colorings listed
Washington — The government has asked the
nation's leading food manufacturers to list volun
tarily on their ingredient labels the colors they add
to foods.
In a letter to about 100 of the largest food com
panies in the country, Food and Drug Commis
sioner Donald Kennedy said, "There can be no
doubt that consumers want to know what they are
eating."
He said public concern has been stimulated in
recent years by the Food and Drug Administra
tion's banning of Red No. 2 and 4 artificial coloring
and a ( urrent proposal to require specific labeling
on products containing Yellow No. 5.
Present law requires only that food colorings be
certified by the FDA as safe when used as intended
and that products containing them include a nota
tion in the list of ingredients that the product con
tains coloring.
FDA proposed last year to require specific iden
tity ation on labels of Yellow No. 5 to enable bet
ween 50,000 and 100,000 Americans who may be
allergic to it to avoid it.(he dye, technically known
as tartrazine, is the most widely used food coloring
in the United States and is used in most over-the
counter and prescription drugs, the FDA has said.
HUD focuses on small towns
Washington — The Department ot FHousing and
Urban Development, responding to small-town
concerns that HUD policies are too big city
oriented, is creating a task force to study the de
velopment problems of rural areas and smaller
communities.

A National League of Cities survey of small town
officials found that their most frequently men
tioned problem was meeting the requirements for
federal programs.
Some small towns are growing too fast and don't
have the resources to plan for the changes. Others
are losing population and jobs, and seek govern
ment help in shoring up community services. Of
ten, those communities say Washington turns a
deaf ear to problems, and rarely do they have the
political clout to do anything about it.
HUD secretary Patricia Harris said her depart
ment is prepared to "focus some well-deserved
attention on the needs of rural areas." She noted
that "some of the best public housing that HUD
administers is rural public housing."
Tax cuts studied by lawmakers
Sacramento — California lawmakers tossed
billion-dollar tax cut ideas all about the Capitol
yesterday, but no plan has emerged yet with a
clear consensus.
The most likely bill to finally reach Gov. Jerry
Brown's desk is a $950 million-a-year Democrat
backed plan to give a minimum tax cut or rebate of
$150 to each California homeowner and $50 to
each renter.
That plan focuses on property tax relief for
homeowners, plus bigger cash rebates on state
income taxes for renters.
That's the compromise bill Senate Democratic
leaders planned to unveil at a news conference
Monday. But the four cosponsors stumbled over
disagreements an hour before the news confer
ence and called off their announcement.
Senate Finance Committee chairman Albert
Rodda, author of the Senate Democrats' plan, said
that bill "is still very much alive," and that the
cosponsors are working closely to resolve what he
described as "just a few, not major substantive
differences" that still separate them.
Soviets to rendezvous in space
Moscow — The Soviet Union sent two cos
monauts aloft yesterday for a rendezvous with a
space laboratory where two other cosmonauts
have been living for a month.
A huge, white rocket lifted Soyuz 27 from the
Central Asian launch pad in Baikenur at 3:26 p.m.
Moscow time — B:2b a.m. EST, Tass said. It flew in
an orbit close to the space station, Salyut b, in
preparation for docking today.
Announcement of the launch was not made
until 90 minutes after it occurred. The crew was
reported "feeling well" and the ship's systems
were "functioning normally."

Tass said after the docking with Salyut 6 the
crews of Soyuz 27 and its predecessor, Soyuz 26,
would carry out research and experiments. It did
not say how long the joint linkup would last.
Nuclear plant rules may ease
Sacramento — A Democrat and a Republican,
both boosters of nuclear power, have introduced
bills in the Assembly to repeal California's laws
restricting nuclear plant construction.
The virtually identical measures are AB 2170 by
Assemblyman Alister McAlister (D-San lose) and
AB 2173 by Assemblyman William Dannemeyer
(R-Fullerton). Both were introduced Monday.
In a statement yesterday, McAlister said the
three nuclear safety bills, passed in 1976, were
enacted "in a spirit of panic" in order to head off a
tougher anti-nuclear initiative on the lune 1976
ballot. That initiative, Prop. 15, was rejected by
voters about 2-1.
Two sentenced in Bolles case
Phoenix, Ariz. — A contractor and a plumber
were sentenced yesterday to die in the gas
chamber for their role in the assassination ot re
porter Don Bolles, whose car was bombed while
he was investigating organized crime.
Max Dunlap, a 48-year Phoenix building con
tractor and James Robison, a 55-year-old plumber
from suburban Chandler, both proclaimed their
innocence and attacked the court. Their sentences
and convictions will be automatically appealed to
the Arizona Supreme Court.
Voyager 1 sends photograph
Los Angeles — A startling photograph of the
earth and moon as a traveler in outer space would
see them has been transmitted by the Voyager 1
spacecraft, 7.25 million miles away on its journey
toward Saturn and beyond.
The color photograph, showing for the first time
the earth and moon together, was released by
National Aeronautics and Space Administration
chief Robert Frosch.
Frosch was in town to tout the NASA program, in
a hiatus period after the manned moon shots and
the Viking voyages to Mars, which searched in
conclusively for life on the Red Planet.
Today's weather

Soviets to rendezvous in space
Moscow — The Soviet Union sent two cos
monauts aloft yesterday for a rendezvous with a
space laboratory where two other cosmonauts
have been living for a month.
A huge, white rocket lifted Soyuz 27 from the
Central Asian launch pad in Baikenur at 3:26 p.m.
Moscow time — B:2b a.m. EST, Tass said. It flew in
an orbit close to the space station, Salyut b, in
preparation for docking today.
Announcement of the launch was not made
until 90 minutes after it occurred. The crew was
reported "feeling well" and the ship's systems
were "functioning normally."

Tass said after the docking with Salyut 6 the
crews of Soyuz 27 and its predecessor, Soyuz 26,
would carry out research and experiments. It did
not say how long the joint linkup would last.
Nuclear plant rules may ease
Sacramento — A Democrat and a Republican,
both boosters of nuclear power, have introduced
bills in the Assembly to repeal California's laws
restricting nuclear plant construction.
The virtually identical measures are AB 2170 by
Assemblyman Alister McAlister (D-San lose) and
AB 2173 by Assemblyman William Dannemeyer
(R-Fullerton). Both were introduced Monday.
In a statement yesterday, McAlister said the
three nuclear safety bills, passed in 1976, were
enacted "in a spirit of panic" in order to head off a
tougher anti-nuclear initiative on the lune 1976
ballot. That initiative, Prop. 15, was rejected by
voters about 2-1.
Two sentenced in Bolles case
Phoenix, Ariz. — A contractor and a plumber
were sentenced yesterday to die in the gas
chamber for their role in the assassination ot re
porter Don Bolles, whose car was bombed while
he was investigating organized crime.
Max Dunlap, a 48-year Phoenix building con
tractor and James Robison, a 55-year-old plumber
from suburban Chandler, both proclaimed their
innocence and attacked the court. Their sentences
and convictions will be automatically appealed to
the Arizona Supreme Court.
Voyager 1 sends photograph
Los Angeles — A startling photograph of the
earth and moon as a traveler in outer space would
see them has been transmitted by the Voyager 1
spacecraft, 7.25 million miles away on its journey
toward Saturn and beyond.
The color photograph, showing for the first time
the earth and moon together, was released by
National Aeronautics and Space Administration
chief Robert Frosch.
Frosch was in town to tout the NASA program, in
a hiatus period after the manned moon shots and
the Viking voyages to Mars, which searched in
conclusively for life on the Red Planet.
Today's weather
Patchy early morning fog. Periods of rain likely
through tomorrow. Lows in the mid 40s to low 50s.
Highs both days mid 50s to low 60s. Variable winds
southerly 15 to 25 mph today. Chance of rain 60
percent today and 70 percent tonight.
Israelis occupy West Bank
Jerusalem — The government won final approval
yesterday for three new and potentially controver
sial Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank
of the lordan River. The go-ahead came one day
before Egypt and Israel begin the next stage of
peace negotiations.
The parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs
Committee voted 14-9 to override an attempt by a
moderate minority faction in Prime Minister
Menahem Begin's coalition government to halt
the settlement plan.
President Sadat has said "not a single Israeli"
can remain on Arab lands after peace. Israel's
Begin is equally adamant that the settlements will
stay.
The peace dialogue enters a new phase today
when the defense ministers of Israel and Egypt —
Ezer Weizman and Mohammed Abdel Ghany
Gamassy — meet in Cairo for negotiations dealing
primarily with the return of the Sinai Peninsula to
Egypt.
FDA wants colorings listed
Washington — The government has asked the
nation's leading food manufacturers to list volun
tarily on their ingredient labels the colors they add
to foods.
In a letter to about 100 of the largest food com
panies in the country, Food and Drug Commis
sioner Donald Kennedy said, "There can be no
doubt that consumers want to know what they are
eating."
He said public concern has been stimulated in
recent years by the Food and Drug Administra
tion's banning of Red No. 2 and 4 artificial coloring
and a ( urrent proposal to require specific labeling
on products containing Yellow No. 5.
Present law requires only that food colorings be
certified by the FDA as safe when used as intended
and that products containing them include a nota
tion in the list of ingredients that the product con
tains coloring.
FDA proposed last year to require specific iden
tity ation on labels of Yellow No. 5 to enable bet
ween 50,000 and 100,000 Americans who may be
allergic to it to avoid it.(he dye, technically known
as tartrazine, is the most widely used food coloring
in the United States and is used in most over-the
counter and prescription drugs, the FDA has said.
HUD focuses on small towns
Washington — The Department ot FHousing and
Urban Development, responding to small-town
concerns that HUD policies are too big city
oriented, is creating a task force to study the de
velopment problems of rural areas and smaller
communities.

A National League of Cities survey of small town
officials found that their most frequently men
tioned problem was meeting the requirements for
federal programs.
Some small towns are growing too fast and don't
have the resources to plan for the changes. Others
are losing population and jobs, and seek govern
ment help in shoring up community services. Of
ten, those communities say Washington turns a
deaf ear to problems, and rarely do they have the
political clout to do anything about it.
HUD secretary Patricia Harris said her depart
ment is prepared to "focus some well-deserved
attention on the needs of rural areas." She noted
that "some of the best public housing that HUD
administers is rural public housing."
Tax cuts studied by lawmakers
Sacramento — California lawmakers tossed
billion-dollar tax cut ideas all about the Capitol
yesterday, but no plan has emerged yet with a
clear consensus.
The most likely bill to finally reach Gov. Jerry
Brown's desk is a $950 million-a-year Democrat
backed plan to give a minimum tax cut or rebate of
$150 to each California homeowner and $50 to
each renter.
That plan focuses on property tax relief for
homeowners, plus bigger cash rebates on state
income taxes for renters.
That's the compromise bill Senate Democratic
leaders planned to unveil at a news conference
Monday. But the four cosponsors stumbled over
disagreements an hour before the news confer
ence and called off their announcement.
Senate Finance Committee chairman Albert
Rodda, author of the Senate Democrats' plan, said
that bill "is still very much alive," and that the
cosponsors are working closely to resolve what he
described as "just a few, not major substantive
differences" that still separate them.

FDA wants colorings listed
Washington — The government has asked the
nation's leading food manufacturers to list volun
tarily on their ingredient labels the colors they add
to foods.
In a letter to about 100 of the largest food com
panies in the country, Food and Drug Commis
sioner Donald Kennedy said, "There can be no
doubt that consumers want to know what they are
eating."
He said public concern has been stimulated in
recent years by the Food and Drug Administra
tion's banning of Red No. 2 and 4 artificial coloring
and a ( urrent proposal to require specific labeling
on products containing Yellow No. 5.
Present law requires only that food colorings be
certified by the FDA as safe when used as intended
and that products containing them include a nota
tion in the list of ingredients that the product con
tains coloring.
FDA proposed last year to require specific iden
tity ation on labels of Yellow No. 5 to enable bet
ween 50,000 and 100,000 Americans who may be
allergic to it to avoid it.(he dye, technically known
as tartrazine, is the most widely used food coloring
in the United States and is used in most over-the
counter and prescription drugs, the FDA has said.
HUD focuses on small towns
Washington — The Department ot FHousing and
Urban Development, responding to small-town
concerns that HUD policies are too big city
oriented, is creating a task force to study the de
velopment problems of rural areas and smaller
communities.

A National League of Cities survey of small town
officials found that their most frequently men
tioned problem was meeting the requirements for
federal programs.
Some small towns are growing too fast and don't
have the resources to plan for the changes. Others
are losing population and jobs, and seek govern
ment help in shoring up community services. Of
ten, those communities say Washington turns a
deaf ear to problems, and rarely do they have the
political clout to do anything about it.
HUD secretary Patricia Harris said her depart
ment is prepared to "focus some well-deserved
attention on the needs of rural areas." She noted
that "some of the best public housing that HUD
administers is rural public housing."
Tax cuts studied by lawmakers
Sacramento — California lawmakers tossed
billion-dollar tax cut ideas all about the Capitol
yesterday, but no plan has emerged yet with a
clear consensus.
The most likely bill to finally reach Gov. Jerry
Brown's desk is a $950 million-a-year Democrat
backed plan to give a minimum tax cut or rebate of
$150 to each California homeowner and $50 to
each renter.
That plan focuses on property tax relief for
homeowners, plus bigger cash rebates on state
income taxes for renters.
That's the compromise bill Senate Democratic
leaders planned to unveil at a news conference
Monday. But the four cosponsors stumbled over
disagreements an hour before the news confer
ence and called off their announcement.
Senate Finance Committee chairman Albert
Rodda, author of the Senate Democrats' plan, said
that bill "is still very much alive," and that the
cosponsors are working closely to resolve what he
described as "just a few, not major substantive
differences" that still separate them.
Soviets to rendezvous in space
Moscow — The Soviet Union sent two cos
monauts aloft yesterday for a rendezvous with a
space laboratory where two other cosmonauts
have been living for a month.
A huge, white rocket lifted Soyuz 27 from the
Central Asian launch pad in Baikenur at 3:26 p.m.
Moscow time — B:2b a.m. EST, Tass said. It flew in
an orbit close to the space station, Salyut b, in
preparation for docking today.
Announcement of the launch was not made
until 90 minutes after it occurred. The crew was
reported "feeling well" and the ship's systems
were "functioning normally."

Tass said after the docking with Salyut 6 the
crews of Soyuz 27 and its predecessor, Soyuz 26,
would carry out research and experiments. It did
not say how long the joint linkup would last.
Nuclear plant rules may ease
Sacramento — A Democrat and a Republican,
both boosters of nuclear power, have introduced
bills in the Assembly to repeal California's laws
restricting nuclear plant construction.
The virtually identical measures are AB 2170 by
Assemblyman Alister McAlister (D-San lose) and
AB 2173 by Assemblyman William Dannemeyer
(R-Fullerton). Both were introduced Monday.
In a statement yesterday, McAlister said the
three nuclear safety bills, passed in 1976, were
enacted "in a spirit of panic" in order to head off a
tougher anti-nuclear initiative on the lune 1976
ballot. That initiative, Prop. 15, was rejected by
voters about 2-1.
Two sentenced in Bolles case
Phoenix, Ariz. — A contractor and a plumber
were sentenced yesterday to die in the gas
chamber for their role in the assassination ot re
porter Don Bolles, whose car was bombed while
he was investigating organized crime.
Max Dunlap, a 48-year Phoenix building con
tractor and James Robison, a 55-year-old plumber
from suburban Chandler, both proclaimed their
innocence and attacked the court. Their sentences
and convictions will be automatically appealed to
the Arizona Supreme Court.
Voyager 1 sends photograph
Los Angeles — A startling photograph of the
earth and moon as a traveler in outer space would
see them has been transmitted by the Voyager 1
spacecraft, 7.25 million miles away on its journey
toward Saturn and beyond.
The color photograph, showing for the first time
the earth and moon together, was released by
National Aeronautics and Space Administration
chief Robert Frosch.
Frosch was in town to tout the NASA program, in
a hiatus period after the manned moon shots and
the Viking voyages to Mars, which searched in
conclusively for life on the Red Planet.
Today's weather
Patchy early morning fog. Periods of rain likely
through tomorrow. Lows in the mid 40s to low 50s.
Highs both days mid 50s to low 60s. Variable winds
southerly 15 to 25 mph today. Chance of rain 60
percent today and 70 percent tonight.
Israelis occupy West Bank
Jerusalem — The government won final approval
yesterday for three new and potentially controver
sial Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank
of the lordan River. The go-ahead came one day
before Egypt and Israel begin the next stage of
peace negotiations.
The parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs
Committee voted 14-9 to override an attempt by a
moderate minority faction in Prime Minister
Menahem Begin's coalition government to halt
the settlement plan.
President Sadat has said "not a single Israeli"
can remain on Arab lands after peace. Israel's
Begin is equally adamant that the settlements will
stay.
The peace dialogue enters a new phase today
when the defense ministers of Israel and Egypt —
Ezer Weizman and Mohammed Abdel Ghany
Gamassy — meet in Cairo for negotiations dealing
primarily with the return of the Sinai Peninsula to
Egypt.
