# Registrar's office remails study lists
## 
### Cheryl Eschbach 
The registrar's office mailed a sec
ond study list confirmation to each
student who preregistered this quar
ter, to correct data omissions on
many original study list confirma
tions.
Usually data is omitted if a stu
dent's study list has incorrect course
information. But this time it was the
registrar's office which goofed.
Registrar Sally Mahoney attributed
the problem to staff inexperience
and failure to crosscheck course list
ings. Information for about 70
courses was misfiled in a computer,
she said.

Mahoney said it was easier and less
costly to reissue study list confirma
tions for all 7000 preregistered stu
dents than to let students attempt to
correct misinformation individually.
According to Mahoney, the cost of
the error was slight, including only
additional personnel and postage
expenses. Computer costs were neg
ligible because the machine which
was used is already paid for and does
not incur incremental expenses.
Because so many forms were
faulty, "student correction would
have been useless," she added.
New study list confirmations were
issued last week.
