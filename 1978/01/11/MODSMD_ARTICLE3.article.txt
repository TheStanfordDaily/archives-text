# Med School decries new state sexuality course requirements
## 
### Andrea James 
The state government cannot tell universities how to
teach human sexuality courses, Medical School officials
have declared.
Such standards were proposed recently by the Board
of Medical Quality Assurance (BMQA) in response to
legislation introduced two years ago by Assemblyman
)ohn Vasconcellos.
Vasconcellos' legislation was signed into law in 1976.
His bill, AB 4179, required that all candidates for a
California physician's license have education in human
sexuality and that the BMQA determine the length and
content of training necessary for that license.
No assumptions
"The Legislature has not, at any time, assumed it had
the expertise, nor attempted to detail specifics about
curriculum and licensure requirements," Vasconcellos
stated in a recent press release.
"The question here is whether it was wise for the
BMQA to act in such a proscriptive manner," said Larry
Horton, spokesman for the University's office of public
affairs.
Horton added that it is doubtful any proposed regula
tions will become law before March 1978.
The proposed BMQA regulations require that the
human sexuality classes be taught by a multidisciplinary
faculty and mandate that the course be at least 30 hours
long, cover a list of specific topics and include explicit
sexual material.
The University curriculum currently meets most of the
standards set forth in the proposed guidelines, but offi
cials nevertheless object to governmental intervention
in curriculum.

"The government has been notoriously inept in mat
ters of curriculum," Horten said. "These guidelines de
termine how the class must be taught, and who must
teach it — areas which should be determined by the
faculty, not by the government."
"These proposed standards constitute a fundamental
departure from the principle of academic self
determination which traditionally has afforded univer
sities the right to establish academic policy free from
governmental intervention," said Dr. Clayton Rich,
dean of the Medical School.
Dr. Michael lacobs, assistant professor of medicine
and instructor of the Medical School's human sexuality
course, said, "I object to an agency telling me how to
teach, especially when the standards are based only on
what has been done previously in the field," adding that
human sexuality is a relatively new academic subject.
Vasconcellos agreed that the board "should not adopt
regulations which are too confining."
Threatening precedent
Rich commented that, "if the state is prepared to regu
late the details of the curriculum in one area, it can and
may do so in all others. This would establish a precedent
and possibly a trend that seriously threatens the quality
of all the public and private universities in this state."
Jacobs' "Sexual Matters in Medical Practice" is popu
lar at the Medical School, receiving high ratings in evalu
ation questionnaires and attracting more than 100 stu
dents, plus their spouses or guests.
Speakers in the class include psychiatrists and sex
therapists as well as representatives in alternative sexual
lifestyles, including prostitutes, gays, sadomasochists
and transsexuals.

affairs.
Horton added that it is doubtful any proposed regula
tions will become law before March 1978.
The proposed BMQA regulations require that the
human sexuality classes be taught by a multidisciplinary
faculty and mandate that the course be at least 30 hours
long, cover a list of specific topics and include explicit
sexual material.
The University curriculum currently meets most of the
standards set forth in the proposed guidelines, but offi
cials nevertheless object to governmental intervention
in curriculum.

"The government has been notoriously inept in mat
ters of curriculum," Horten said. "These guidelines de
termine how the class must be taught, and who must
teach it — areas which should be determined by the
faculty, not by the government."
"These proposed standards constitute a fundamental
departure from the principle of academic self
determination which traditionally has afforded univer
sities the right to establish academic policy free from
governmental intervention," said Dr. Clayton Rich,
dean of the Medical School.
Dr. Michael lacobs, assistant professor of medicine
and instructor of the Medical School's human sexuality
course, said, "I object to an agency telling me how to
teach, especially when the standards are based only on
what has been done previously in the field," adding that
human sexuality is a relatively new academic subject.
Vasconcellos agreed that the board "should not adopt
regulations which are too confining."
Threatening precedent
Rich commented that, "if the state is prepared to regu
late the details of the curriculum in one area, it can and
may do so in all others. This would establish a precedent
and possibly a trend that seriously threatens the quality
of all the public and private universities in this state."
Jacobs' "Sexual Matters in Medical Practice" is popu
lar at the Medical School, receiving high ratings in evalu
ation questionnaires and attracting more than 100 stu
dents, plus their spouses or guests.
Speakers in the class include psychiatrists and sex
therapists as well as representatives in alternative sexual
lifestyles, including prostitutes, gays, sadomasochists
and transsexuals.
The state government cannot tell universities how to
teach human sexuality courses, Medical School officials
have declared.
Such standards were proposed recently by the Board
of Medical Quality Assurance (BMQA) in response to
legislation introduced two years ago by Assemblyman
)ohn Vasconcellos.
Vasconcellos' legislation was signed into law in 1976.
His bill, AB 4179, required that all candidates for a
California physician's license have education in human
sexuality and that the BMQA determine the length and
content of training necessary for that license.
No assumptions
"The Legislature has not, at any time, assumed it had
the expertise, nor attempted to detail specifics about
curriculum and licensure requirements," Vasconcellos
stated in a recent press release.
"The question here is whether it was wise for the
BMQA to act in such a proscriptive manner," said Larry
Horton, spokesman for the University's office of public
affairs.
Horton added that it is doubtful any proposed regula
tions will become law before March 1978.
The proposed BMQA regulations require that the
human sexuality classes be taught by a multidisciplinary
