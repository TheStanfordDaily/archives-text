# Winter's worst cold hits Midwest, East
## 
### Associated Press 
The winter's worst cold spell
forced widespread cutbacks in elec
tric power from Michigan to the
Carolinas yesterday, with tempera
tures below zero in many areas and
plunging to the teens as far south as
Alabama. The cold was blamed for at
least 16 deaths.
The Northeast cold spell drained
so much power that Commonwealth
Edison engineers in Chicago re
ported that the nation's electric
clocks ran an average of 27.7 seconds
slow during the night and yesterday
morning.
"It was a nationwide problem be
cause of heavy demands," said Bill
IHarrah, a spokesman for Common
wealth Edison.
It was so cold in western Pennsyl
vania that residents venturing out of
doors were warned that exposed
flesh could freeze in less than a mi
nute.
"The problem of electric power is
pretty common throughout the mid
dle section of the country," said Wil
liam Webb, a spokesman for the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commis
sion. "There is not enough capacity
to go around right now and this ap
pears to be fairly general in a broad
area from Michigan to the
Carolinas."
Rationing
Power systems in Pennsylvania cal
led for rationing and cut back elec
tricity supplies because of excep
tionally heavy demands.

In Ohio, where seven deaths were
blamed on the cold, temperatures
near or below zero also prompted
utility companies to cut back electri
cal output and call for power ration
ing. Toledo Edison Co. and Dayton
Power & Light Co. both ordered 5
percent cutbacks in electricity.
In Columbus, where the mid
morning reading was 4 above, Col
umbus and Southern Ohio Electric
Co. called the situation critical and
asked customers to reduce con
sumption by 50 percent.
Cleveland Mayor Dennis Kucinich,
saying the problem was beyond the
city's capacity to deal with, re
quested emergency assistance Mon
day night. Gov. lames Rhodes de
clared a snow emergency and or
dered out National Guard units in the
Cleveland area to assist authorities.
Snow
The National Weather Service said
8.6 inches of snow fell in Cleveland
since Sunday, and heavy winds
created drifts and reduced visibility.
Cleveland's 113,000-student public
school system was closed for the
second straight day.
In the seven-state Tennessep Val
ley Authority area, TVA spokesman
Lee Sheppeard said the agency
shaved its power to industrial users.
"It's tight not just on our system
but for the whole eastern grid gener
ally," Sheppeard said. "We got just a
dab from the outside. There aren't
any blocks of power around that we
can purchase."
