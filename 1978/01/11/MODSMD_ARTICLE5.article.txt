# Senate supports refusal to pick students for CIR
## 
### Sara Lessley 
Declaring that student input on the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility would be "ineffectual," the
ASSU Senate voted 11-6 last night to
support a recent refusal to nominate
any students for committee posts.
The senate supported the ASSU
Nominations Committee's decision
Monday not to nominate students
for posts on the CIR. The senate
could have directed the Nom Com to
make selections, according to ASSU
Co-president Anne Henkels.
The senate resolution objected to
the 1977 revision of the University's
guidelines on investment respon
sibilities as adopted by the Board of
Trustees.
According to the resolution, those

guidelines "require in all cases the
subordination of social responsibil
ity to the fiduciary responsibility of
maximizing returns on the Universi
ty's investment."
Active in discussion
Ad hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility members Ellen Byrne,
Lloyd Dixon and Anne Henkels were
active in discussion of the resolution.
The three expressed dissatisfac
tion with modifications the trustees
made in investment guidelines pre
sented to them by the ad hoc com
mittee.
Dixon said student members of the
ad hoc committee were not "criticiz
ing the trustees for altering the re
port," because the ad hoc committee
report was a delicate balance bet
ween varying views of "committee
members.
However, the trustees removed
any leeway in the document that al
lows compromise, Dixon said. "The
University says the trustees will be
sued if they don't maximize (profit)
returns."
'Not changes in tone'
Byrne added the trustee revisions
were "not changes in tone, but in
principles."
She said the revised report is
"black and white, with no shades of
gray."
"The way it's set up now, the Uni
versity can be profit-making and not
consider social injury, or consider
social injury and lose lots of money.
"We need a process that will con
sider both options" and try to com
promise, she said.
Dixon said appointing members to
the CIR would be a "legitimization"
of the trustees' guidelines and an ac
ceptance of its principles.
"There is no use in having a com
mission operating under those
guidelines."
Hurting profits
Henkels added that the revised
wording "restricts voting on social
issues only if it won't hurt profits."
Dixon said the trustees "might be
upset if the students refused to par
ticipate. Maybe they (the trustees)

will consider revising the docu
ment."
ASSU Co-president Greg Larson
said President Richard Lyman proba
bly would appoint students to the
CIR if the Nom Com refused to
nominate any. (The president has
final say in appointing and approving
commission members.)
Henkels agreed, but added that
she thought "everybody, including
the trustees, would see the commit-

tee as illegitimate without the recog
nition of the ASSU."
'Deserve a voice'
Disagreeing with both the
guidelines and the proposed refusal
to nominate students, Sen. Doug
Bandow said students "deserve a
voice to affect University policy."
Senator Steve Buckley said he did
not "agree with the document, it is
structurally flawed and a blanket slap
in the face to the students who
served five months on the commit
tee."
But, he added, the question is
"what would be most politically
shrewd." He said he thought it
would be "politically stupid" for the
senate to approve the Nom Com re

Voting for the resolution support

Senators Don Moonshine, Steve
Mentor, Paul Framson, Carlyle Kinni
son, Mary Bateson, Rick Levy, Marvin
Anderson, Kenneth Nunn, Meriel
Burtle, Lynn Rubinett and David
Catanzerite.
Voting against the measure were
Senators George Drysdale, Doug
Bandow, Rainer Newberry, Al Miner,
Tom McCormack and Steve Buckley.
Henkels added after the meeting
that the ASSU will announce a forum
for all students and committee
members to answer questions and
provide background information on
the resolution on investment re
sponsibility.

nition of the ASSU."
'Deserve a voice'
Disagreeing with both the
guidelines and the proposed refusal
to nominate students, Sen. Doug
Bandow said students "deserve a
voice to affect University policy."
Senator Steve Buckley said he did
not "agree with the document, it is
structurally flawed and a blanket slap
in the face to the students who
served five months on the commit
tee."
But, he added, the question is
"what would be most politically
shrewd." He said he thought it
would be "politically stupid" for the
senate to approve the Nom Com re


Anne Henkels
tusal to nominate students.
Voting for the resolution support
ing the Nom Corn's action were
Senators Don Moonshine, Steve
Mentor, Paul Framson, Carlyle Kinni
son, Mary Bateson, Rick Levy, Marvin
Anderson, Kenneth Nunn, Meriel
Burtle, Lynn Rubinett and David
Catanzerite.
Voting against the measure were
Senators George Drysdale, Doug
Bandow, Rainer Newberry, Al Miner,
Tom McCormack and Steve Buckley.
Henkels added after the meeting
that the ASSU will announce a forum
for all students and committee
members to answer questions and
provide background information on
the resolution on investment re
sponsibility.
Declaring that student input on the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility would be "ineffectual," the
ASSU Senate voted 11-6 last night to
support a recent refusal to nominate
any students for committee posts.
The senate supported the ASSU
Nominations Committee's decision
Monday not to nominate students
for posts on the CIR. The senate
could have directed the Nom Com to
make selections, according to ASSU
Co-president Anne Henkels.
The senate resolution objected to
the 1977 revision of the University's
guidelines on investment respon
sibilities as adopted by the Board of
Trustees.
According to the resolution, those

guidelines "require in all cases the
subordination of social responsibil
ity to the fiduciary responsibility of
maximizing returns on the Universi
ty's investment."
Active in discussion
Ad hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility members Ellen Byrne,
Lloyd Dixon and Anne Henkels were
active in discussion of the resolution.
The three expressed dissatisfac
tion with modifications the trustees
made in investment guidelines pre
sented to them by the ad hoc com
mittee.
Dixon said student members of the
ad hoc committee were not "criticiz
ing the trustees for altering the re
port," because the ad hoc committee
report was a delicate balance bet
ween varying views of "committee
members.
However, the trustees removed
any leeway in the document that al
lows compromise, Dixon said. "The
University says the trustees will be
sued if they don't maximize (profit)
returns."
'Not changes in tone'
Byrne added the trustee revisions
were "not changes in tone, but in
principles."
She said the revised report is
"black and white, with no shades of
gray."
"The way it's set up now, the Uni
versity can be profit-making and not
consider social injury, or consider
social injury and lose lots of money.
"We need a process that will con
sider both options" and try to com
promise, she said.
Dixon said appointing members to
the CIR would be a "legitimization"
of the trustees' guidelines and an ac
ceptance of its principles.
"There is no use in having a com
mission operating under those
guidelines."
Hurting profits
Henkels added that the revised
wording "restricts voting on social
issues only if it won't hurt profits."
Dixon said the trustees "might be
upset if the students refused to par
ticipate. Maybe they (the trustees)

will consider revising the docu
ment."
ASSU Co-president Greg Larson
said President Richard Lyman proba
bly would appoint students to the
CIR if the Nom Com refused to
nominate any. (The president has
final say in appointing and approving
commission members.)
Henkels agreed, but added that
she thought "everybody, including
the trustees, would see the commit-

tee as illegitimate without the recog
nition of the ASSU."
