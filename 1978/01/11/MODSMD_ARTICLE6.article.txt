# Student representative on Board sought by COP campaign drive
## 
### Hardy Iredale 
The ASSU Council of Presidents is
launching a campaign to get a stu
dent representative on the Board of
Trustees, ASSU Co-president Steve
Westly said yesterday.
"I think a student representative
on the Board of Trustees is very im
portant, and something every stu
dent should consider working for,"
Westly said.
Westly said the move would be a
strong sign that the University ac
cepts the capability and responsibil

ity of the student body. He noted that
many universities have student rep
resentatives on their boards of trus
tees.
"Currently," he said, "we do not
have any direct input into meetings
of the Board of Trustees. We don't
want to be deciding policy," he said,
"but we do feel we have the right to
input on the University's policy deci
sions."
When to lobby
Asked whether he had any specific
issues in mind, Westly said the stu

dent representative on the board
would not lobby "unless the student
body demonstrated one concerted
opinion in favor of action." He indi
cated that the campaign to get a stu
dent on the board was aimed only at
increasing student say in University
policy.
Westly said he felt the proposal has
a better chance now than in previous
years because of "improved "rela
tions between the ASSU and the
Board of Trustees.
"To a larger degree than ever be
fore, we have earned the trustees'
respect by making coherent remarks
on several student related issues like
tuition hikes," he said.
He also said a more favorable cli
mate for the move.exists now "be
cause of the student activism last
spring and this year, particularly
concerning the divestment issue.
"Because all these other things are
happening, the trustees may know
that the students do need a more
legitimized position in the governing
structure of the University," Westly
said.
'Transient' students
A traditional argument against
placing a student member on the
Board of Trustees, Westly said, is that
students are transient and not able to
make positive contributions.
"We feel that in the past, students
have demonstrated great responsi
bility cohcerning University issues,"
he said.
"The Jeffersonian ideal," he
noted, "says that if an individual is
subject to the consequences of gov
ernment, they have a right to a say in
how that government is run. )ust be
cause students are transient does not
mean you can deny them a say," he
said.
However, Westly said, the ASSU
will not pursue this unless student
support is shown. "We hope stu
dents will show their support by
coming to the meeting at 7:30 p.m.
this Thursday at the ASSU office in
Tresidder.
"From the Thursday meeting we
hope to get student opinion and to
draft a letter which will be sent to the
trustees," he said. "We hope to get
feedback on how the board stands so
we can respond to their concerns
and questions on a personal basis.

A traditional argument against
placing a student member on the
Board of Trustees, Westly said, is that
students are transient and not able to
make positive contributions.
"We feel that in the past, students
have demonstrated great responsi
bility cohcerning University issues,"
he said.
"The Jeffersonian ideal," he
noted, "says that if an individual is
subject to the consequences of gov
ernment, they have a right to a say in
how that government is run. )ust be
cause students are transient does not
mean you can deny them a say," he
said.
However, Westly said, the ASSU
will not pursue this unless student
support is shown. "We hope stu
dents will show their support by
coming to the meeting at 7:30 p.m.
this Thursday at the ASSU office in
Tresidder.
"From the Thursday meeting we
hope to get student opinion and to
draft a letter which will be sent to the
trustees," he said. "We hope to get
feedback on how the board stands so
we can respond to their concerns
and questions on a personal basis.
The ASSU Council of Presidents is
launching a campaign to get a stu
dent representative on the Board of
Trustees, ASSU Co-president Steve
Westly said yesterday.
"I think a student representative
on the Board of Trustees is very im
portant, and something every stu
dent should consider working for,"
Westly said.
Westly said the move would be a
strong sign that the University ac
cepts the capability and responsibil

ity of the student body. He noted that
many universities have student rep
resentatives on their boards of trus
tees.
"Currently," he said, "we do not
have any direct input into meetings
of the Board of Trustees. We don't
want to be deciding policy," he said,
"but we do feel we have the right to
input on the University's policy deci
sions."
When to lobby
Asked whether he had any specific
issues in mind, Westly said the stu

dent representative on the board
would not lobby "unless the student
body demonstrated one concerted
opinion in favor of action." He indi
cated that the campaign to get a stu
dent on the board was aimed only at
increasing student say in University
policy.
Westly said he felt the proposal has
a better chance now than in previous
years because of "improved "rela
tions between the ASSU and the
Board of Trustees.
"To a larger degree than ever be
fore, we have earned the trustees'
respect by making coherent remarks
on several student related issues like
tuition hikes," he said.
He also said a more favorable cli
mate for the move.exists now "be
cause of the student activism last
spring and this year, particularly
concerning the divestment issue.
"Because all these other things are
happening, the trustees may know
that the students do need a more
legitimized position in the governing
structure of the University," Westly
said.
