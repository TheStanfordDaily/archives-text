Stanford Police prevented students from entering Meyer
Library (above) early yesterday afternoon after
receiving a call just before noon saying there is "a bomb
in the new library." At 12:30 police found a suspicious
brown case in an unlocked storage locker near the first
floor stairs. Sergeant Debra Marinaro told the crowd at
the front portal waiting admittance, "We have some-

thing that could be a possibility, and we're going to have
to disturb it." At 12:45 the upper floors of the library
were evacuated, but police soon discovered the brown
case contained the typewriter it was designed for, not
the rumored 30 sticks of dynamite. UGLY returned to
normal operations at 1:20.
