# Investment policy
## Illusions of progress 
### Byrne, et al 
The trustees have unanimously
adopted a "revised" version of Stan
ford's investment guidelines. Although
the trustees accepted for the most part
the language of the ad hoc Committee's
majority recommendations, they man
aged with minor alterations and the
addition of a few qualifying paragraphs
to change and even negate the underly
ing concepts.
With their newest rewrite of Stan
ford's investment policy, the board has
assured us once again that investment
responsibility has not yet come to Stan
ford.
Shackled with these guidelines, a
new Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR) will limp to a start in
)anuary with fanfare from the Stanford
administration as the answer to all of
the trustees' problems. Before the
community puts its faith in this "new"
committee, we would like to briefly
examine the trustees "revised"
guidelines.
In the University's 1971 Statement
on Investment Responsibility, consid
eration of the social impact of Univer
sity investments is subordinated to fi
nancial considerations except when
virtually impossible conditions are met
(i.e., when "substantial consensus" on
the issue can be proven to exist within
the Stanford community.)
It was this automatic subordination
of the trustees' social responsibility as
investors to their fiduciary responsibil
ity which the three of us on the ad hoc
Committee worked to change in the
1977 revision. Limited progress was
made, but our names accompanied the
1977 revision onlybecauseourdissent
ing appendix was attached.
Prettier box
What the trustees have done with the
new 1977 statement is what American
business does so well; they put the
same product in a prettier box with a
bigger bow. The basic principles which
underlie both the 1971 and 1977
statements are exactly the same. The
1977 statement is just a little flashier in
that it expands somewhat the notion of
investment responsibility and even
hints at progressivism here and there.
Staff are finally included on the new
CIR, and the guidelines contain a
clause, however inadequate, on di
vestment, and also stipulate that the
CIR recommendations should be sent
directly to the board instead of being
routed through the university's

bureaucratic quagmire.
The document also pays lip service to
several shareholder rights such as proxy
voting and representations to corpo
rate management, although it over
looks the right to initiate proxy resolu
tions. (The University of Minnesota in
conjunction with several other schools
has recently submitted a South Africa
related proxy.)
While the "new" statement contains
several legitimate steps forward, they
are merely illusiohs of progress. Its
positive aspects are overshadowed by
the total subordination of social re
sponsibility to maximum financial re
turn.
Example
To illustrate, the section on "Selec
tion and Retention of Investment Sec
urities" uses, for the most part, the lib
eral language of the ad hoc Committee.
But where the committee wrote . .
the investment manager of advisor
shall take into consideration any sub
stantial social injury caused by com
pany activities which are likely to pro
duce an adverse governmental or pub
lic reaction," the trustees substituted
. . the investment manager or ad
visor shall take into consideration any
substantial social injury caused by
company activities which in his or her
opinion is likely to have a negative im
pact on the value of the investment."
The substitution of this one clause
ties the consideration of social injury in
the selection and retention of stocks to
the effect the social injury will have on
the University's profits. Thus, instead
of telling the investment manager to
independently consider the social im
plications of a company's activities, the
trustees are telling him or her to make
sure that such activities will not hurt
Stanford's investment profits.
In the section on shareholder rights,
again the trustees have used the lan
guage of the ad hoc Committee's
majority report but negated the origi
nal sense of the section. Where the
committee wrote that the trustees shall
vote for proxy resolutions which seek
to eliminate or retard social injury, the
trustees have added the clause "provid
ing such action is not inconsistent with
the trustees' fiduciary obligations."
Profit maximization
According to the document, the trus
tees' fiduciary obligation is "to
maximize the financial return on . . .
(University) resources. . The same

clause is used by the trustees to limit
use of the divestment option. Con
sequently, in the voting of proxies and
divestment, as well as in the selection
and retention of stocks, the University
cannot act in ways that are inconsistent
with profit maximization.
In the 1977 revision of the 1971
statement, the trustees have re
established the automatic subordina
tion of social responsibility to maximi
zation of profits. Therefore, we feel
that participation on the new CIR
would be a waste of time.
We urge the ASSU Nominations
Committee to refuse to legitimize the
1977 investment guidelines and to
acknowledge the impotence of the new
by refusing to nominate students
to serve on it. We also urge students,
faculty, staff, and alumnae, in their
own self-interest, not to support the
new CIR until the trustees show a sin
cere commitment to investment re
sponsibility. Until that time, we will not
accept the attempted deception of the
trustees' "new" statement on invest
ment responsibility.

Responsibility August through
