santly and thereby detracts
from the finish, while the
absence of acting inspires a
definite sense of manipula
tion. It is hard to be moved
by Richard Dreyfuss' insis
tence on playing it cute
throughout, and if Francois
Truffaut Js a genius
elsewhere he is not all that
potent an actor.
Unfortunately, the
people who made "Close
Encounters" appear to count
that a virtue. Like "Star
Wars" this movie evidences
a director's belief that act
ing is less than essential; in
stead it depends on
mechanical methods of giv-

"Close Encounters of the
Third Kind" is a largely
bogus movie. The claims it
lays to sensations above
and beyond those inspired
by its predecessors prove
almost entirely false; if it
does have a few moments
worthy of awe they do not
make up for the two hours
of hype. "Close Encoun
ters" says some disappoint
ing things about what "pul
ling out all the stops"
means these days in Hol-

Bloated, bland
pretentious

lywood — for the most part
the movie is nothing more
than fast-shuffle delivered
to an audience primed for a
vision.
The powerful moments in
this picture stand almost at
odds with its bulk. The
music sandbags us inces-

ing the viewers thrills.
And the thrills are not
new or different. Though
the UFOs are made out to
be good and wise they also
seem to be fans of "The
Exorcist" — the zeal with
Which they trash the homes
of humans is lifted un-

touched from that movie.
They smash dresser draw
ers open and rifle re
frigerators and rip open
six-packs of Coke if at the
end they seem wisely inten
tioned it is hard to forget
the earlier brattiness.
They also look ridiculous.
The aliens that appear at the
end of "Close Encounters"
have properly been de
. scribed elsewhere as bear
ing a striking resemblance
to underfed Pillsbury
Doughboys. They have eyes
exactly like the eyes on
4hose paintings of adorable
children who cry just one
tear of affection; if you go
to Tijuana you will find

them on sale between the
nude women and the
fluorescent Christs.
On the other hand, there
is much to be said -for the
work that went into produc
ing a film on this scale — I
ought not imply that the
money spent does not show
itself on the screen. Every
thing in the movie is expen
sive, it seems — everything
we see seems stuffed to the
gills with the best stuffing'
money can buy.
But that's the point. The
effects in this picture rarely
seem anything more than
effects. After a while that
kind of stuff grates on any
one foolish enough to ex
pect to find a live human

being in the works. The fact
that the picture will not
admit its lack of substance
only serves to make things
worse.
"Close Encounters" is
truly phony at the bone. It is
a monument to over
production. Where it suc
ceeds it insists on stretching
the moment for more than
it is worth. The mother ship
communicates, for in
stance, and the feeling is
overpowering — then it
doesn't stop and you get a
little irked at its skill at im
personating tubas. When it
does stop the background
music is immediately
thrown in the void, and the
ship proceeds to light itself
up until it looks like a float
ing Las Vegas.
The movie is bloated,
bland and worst of all, pre
tentious. The script is
mediocre and at crucial
moments just plain rotten.
The plot is an unashamed
hustle; barefaced pimping
for thrills. The whole pro
duction is overdone and
empty — lots of gaudy
clothes but no emperor.
