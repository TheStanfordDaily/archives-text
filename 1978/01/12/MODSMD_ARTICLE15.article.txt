"We should have total freedom
to do as we like, just so long as it's
not dulL A critic who talks to me
about plausibility is a dull fel
low . . . Some films are slices of
life. Mine are slices of cake." Long
ago, Alfred Hitchcock said that
about his work as a director. But
this comment applies very well to
Steven Spielberg's new film,
"Close Encounters of the Third
Kind." It is a film made by a young
man (30) unconcerned with plausi
bility and mistakes as long as he
entertains. Spielberg's film is a
"slice of cake," a joyous evocation
of awe.
"Close Encounters" has the kind
of childlike wonder, the "gee whiz"
quality that "The Wizard of Oz"
hasf only with the technology
changed. It's flying saucers instead
of flying houses. But "Close En
counters" captivates the audience
in much the same way "Oz" does, /
with its innocence and sense of
curiosity (represented by Garland
in "Oz" and by Richard Dreyfuss in
this film). Spielberg combines this
magical quality with the archetypal
Hitchcock plot; an ordinary man
(Dreyfuss, an electrical worker in
Muncie, Indiana) gets caught in an
situation (contact
withan UFO.)
Besides the film's plot, other re
ferences to Hitchcock are notice
able. One is Spielberg's tongue
in-check use of master French di
rector (and admitted ardent ad
mirer of Hitchcock) Francois Truf
faut in one of the film's lead roles.
Another is a scene reminiscent of
the one in the Hitchcock film
"North by Northwest" when Cary
Grant saves the blonde haired
Eva-Marie Saint from falling off the
face of Mount Rushmore. In a de
liberately low-key homage to that
scene, Spielberg switches the sexes
and has blonde naired Melinda Dil
lon help Richard Dreyfuss up what
is no more than a five-foot high crag
of rock.
Spielberg is influenced by Hitch
cock, but he is not a disciple. He
has his own concerns and areas of
interest. One is the unknown. In.
Spielberg'sTV-movie "Duel," De
nnis Weaver is pursued by an un
known driver in a semi. In "Jaws,"
the shark is the element of mystery.
In "Close Encounters," the un
known is represented by the UFOs.
Another recurring theme in
Spielberg's body of work (three fea
ture films and a couple of TV films)
is obsession. Examples include
Goldie Hawn's for her child in "The
Sugarland Express*' and Robert
Shaw's with sharks in "Jaws." But
"Close Encounters" is more di
rectly about obsession than any
thing else Spielberg has done. After
his contact with the UFO, Dreyfuss
is obsessed with a vision of a) large
tower-like rock formation. He con
stantly recreates this image: at din
ner with mashed potatoes; in a dif
ficult and flawed sequence, he be
gins to tear apart the vegetation
around his home and throw it in
side his house, where he forms a

gigantic model of this tower, which
he later discovers to be Wyoming's
Devil's Tower, the landing place for
the alien spaceships. Spielberg is
trying to show us the depth of
Dreyfuss' mania, but the scene is
too long, and Dreyfuss can't make it
work without appearing too forced,
too comical.
Understanding and defining
characters seems to be a weak area -
for Spielberg; he can't delineate a
character in a few broad strokes li ke
Hitchcock can. But you f§ll (espe
cially in this film) that Spielberg is
unconcerned with this problem.
Spielberg must be an enor
< mously confident director; he tries to
make up for his weaknesses with
characters (and also make his
themes work) through strictly vis
ual means. And he's got an uncanny
feel for the visual. With this talent
he is capable of (and produces)
/" great scenes. He exploits this valu
able skill for all that it's worth. In
the film's special effects scenes,
Spielberg overwhelms with his
"visual" sense of power
and majesty the UFOs.
Early* in the film, when Dreyfuss
sights the UFOs, and later when
Melinda Dillon has one pass over -
her house and take her three year
old son (delightfully played by Cary
Guffey), you feel this majestic
power. Along with cinematog
rapher Vilmos Zsigmond (assisted
v by noted cinematographers Doug
las Slocombe and John Alonzo) and
special effects wizard Douglas
Trumbull ("2001"), Spielberg has

given his UFOs a myth, almost re
ligious aura. Using identification
technique, Spielberg takes things
people can easily comprehend (the
shaking of object inside Dillon's
house, or inside Dreyfuss' truck) to
give a sense of the might the aliens
have.
The film saves its spectacular ef
fects for the end. The obsessed
Dreyfuss and Dillon (who also has
receded the vision of Devil's To
wer) manage to get through the
tight security which the govern
ment (which has cleared the area by
reporting a nerve-gas leakage) has
set up around the Tower and its
newly built landing site. At the site,
Truffaut, Dreyfuss and select others
wait. Suddenly it happens. A targe
number of small ships fly by, fol

lowed by an enormous "mother
ship." The ship is an amazing, al
most incomprehensible image. As
it hovers above the landing area
and prepares to open, you can feel
the audience's (and the director's)
excitement. Spielberg is in his ele
ment — the visual — and he's got a
huge canvas.
This climactic scene conveys
Spielberg's own awe; even his
much-criticized showing of the

aliens is consistent with his vision.
Spielberg is trying to humanize the
friendly aliens and yet keep you
impressed with their power. It's a
visual tightrope that Spielberg
walks, and he manages it with stun
ning style.
Spielberg's attitude towards spe
cial effects makes "Close Encoun
ters" a more personal film for an
audience than "Star Wars,'**so in
this sense it is a more satisfying
film. You wonder with the people
in "Encounters;" you wonder at all
the comic-book characters and
wizardry of "Star Wars."
Spielberg has trouble with transi
tion; for example, he doesn't tie in
his opening sequence (the finding
of long-lost planes in a Mexican de
sert) very well with the rest of his
film. This weakness separates him
(for now) from Kubrick, even
though "Close Encounters" 's
climactic scene is the best piece of
science fantasy ever filmed. But
Spielberg is a quick learner; as he
gets older, characters, actors, and
transitions may become stronger
points for him. But one thing he
should keep is his young man's
exuberance. In "Close Encounter,"
Spielberg is like a kid with a new
toy, and this element of his film —
and his talent — are a delightful
thing to behold.
Many people may lose the plot
thread in "Close Encounters" be
cause the action is not verbalized
for the audience. It's gotten to the
point now that if a movie doesn't sit
down and tell you what its plot and
theme are (like "TheTurning Point"
does), people dismiss it for wa % 112
plot and meaning. But a film wtw.i
tells you what its meaning is is far
less satisfying than a film that lets
you discover its themes by using
your feelings about the film and
? your own experience. "Close En
- counters" provides this kind of

freedom for an audience. There is a
story told in "Close Encounters;" it
is a simple and, some say, implaus
ible one. But plausibility isn't im
portant; entertainment and direc
torial vision are, and "Close En
counters" is both entertaining and
visionary. That the plot is simple
shouldn't be held against it; com
plexity is not the key element in a
good plot.
Characterization has been a
problem for all science-fiction/
fantasy films. In "2001," Kubrick
couldn't (or wouldn't) create
characters — except possibly Hal
the computer. The '50s sci-fi films
usually featured some mutation
wreaking havoc on various hu
mans; characterization was forgot
ten in these films. The characters of
"Star Wars" are one-dimentional
comic strip characters; this is part
of its childlike charm. "Close En
counters" tries harder than most SF
films to develop characters, but it
doesn't really succeed. The charac-
in the film are defined, but they
are not fully drawn. The Truffaut
character is especially weak; his
motivations are almost completely
unknown.
The acting in the film is generally
good, but Spielberg doesn't quite
yet know what to do with it. Teri
Garr, playing essentially the same
role she played in "Oh, God!" (the
doubting wife), is largely wasted,
and we don't see her in the second
half of the film. Richard Dreyfuss
can't pull off some of his scenes,
but he is generally likable and be
lievable in his role of Mr. Average
America. The best performance in
the film is given by thqpe-year old
Guffey, who perfectly expresses
the film's childlike wonder.
Many people who go to "Close En
counters" want to see "Star Wars"
over again, and when they don't get
it, they're disappointed. "Close En
counters" is a different experience
than "Star Wars;" each film should
be seen in the context of what it is
trying to fio. "Star Wars" is pure
escapism; "Close Encounters" is a
thematic work which reflects the in
terests of filmmaker Spielberg.
°Both "Close Encounters" and "Star
Wars" feature books by their re
spective directors. This trend may
be a phenomenon of the science
fantasy genre (even Kubrick had a
hand in the "2001" paperback that
came out after the film), or it may
foreshadow the creation of another
role for a director — the novelist.
Spielberg has said: "Movies for
me are a heightehed reality." This is
similar to Hitchcock's statement:
"Drama is life with the dull bits
taken out." "Heightened reality" is
an apt description for "Close En
counters;" it deals with ordinary
people in extraordinary situations.
One final thought: Steven Spiel
berg, after only three feature films
is close to becoming a very great
film artist. "Heightened reality 7 ' is a
vision that's as good as any other
movie vision, and vision is the key
to art.

Garr, playing essentially the same
role she played in "Oh, God!" (the
doubting wife), is largely wasted,
and we don't see her in the second
half of the film. Richard Dreyfuss
can't pull off some of his scenes,
but he is generally likable and be
lievable in his role of Mr. Average
America. The best performance in
the film is given by thqpe-year old
Guffey, who perfectly expresses
the film's childlike wonder.
Many people who go to "Close En
counters" want to see "Star Wars"
over again, and when they don't get
it, they're disappointed. "Close En
counters" is a different experience
than "Star Wars;" each film should
be seen in the context of what it is
trying to fio. "Star Wars" is pure
escapism; "Close Encounters" is a
thematic work which reflects the in
terests of filmmaker Spielberg.
°Both "Close Encounters" and "Star
Wars" feature books by their re
spective directors. This trend may
be a phenomenon of the science
fantasy genre (even Kubrick had a
hand in the "2001" paperback that
came out after the film), or it may
foreshadow the creation of another
role for a director — the novelist.
Spielberg has said: "Movies for
me are a heightehed reality." This is
similar to Hitchcock's statement:
"Drama is life with the dull bits
taken out." "Heightened reality" is
an apt description for "Close En
counters;" it deals with ordinary
people in extraordinary situations.
One final thought: Steven Spiel
berg, after only three feature films
is close to becoming a very great
film artist. "Heightened reality 7 ' is a
vision that's as good as any other
movie vision, and vision is the key
to art.

"We should have total freedom
to do as we like, just so long as it's
not dulL A critic who talks to me
about plausibility is a dull fel
low . . . Some films are slices of
life. Mine are slices of cake." Long
ago, Alfred Hitchcock said that
about his work as a director. But
this comment applies very well to
Steven Spielberg's new film,
"Close Encounters of the Third
Kind." It is a film made by a young
man (30) unconcerned with plausi
bility and mistakes as long as he
entertains. Spielberg's film is a
"slice of cake," a joyous evocation
of awe.
"Close Encounters" has the kind
of childlike wonder, the "gee whiz"
quality that "The Wizard of Oz"
hasf only with the technology
changed. It's flying saucers instead
of flying houses. But "Close En
counters" captivates the audience
in much the same way "Oz" does, /
with its innocence and sense of
curiosity (represented by Garland
in "Oz" and by Richard Dreyfuss in
this film). Spielberg combines this
magical quality with the archetypal
Hitchcock plot; an ordinary man
(Dreyfuss, an electrical worker in
Muncie, Indiana) gets caught in an
situation (contact
withan UFO.)
Besides the film's plot, other re
ferences to Hitchcock are notice
able. One is Spielberg's tongue
in-check use of master French di
rector (and admitted ardent ad
mirer of Hitchcock) Francois Truf
faut in one of the film's lead roles.
Another is a scene reminiscent of
the one in the Hitchcock film
"North by Northwest" when Cary
Grant saves the blonde haired
Eva-Marie Saint from falling off the
face of Mount Rushmore. In a de
liberately low-key homage to that
scene, Spielberg switches the sexes
and has blonde naired Melinda Dil
lon help Richard Dreyfuss up what
is no more than a five-foot high crag
of rock.
Spielberg is influenced by Hitch
cock, but he is not a disciple. He
has his own concerns and areas of
interest. One is the unknown. In.
Spielberg'sTV-movie "Duel," De
nnis Weaver is pursued by an un
known driver in a semi. In "Jaws,"
the shark is the element of mystery.
In "Close Encounters," the un
known is represented by the UFOs.
Another recurring theme in
Spielberg's body of work (three fea
ture films and a couple of TV films)
is obsession. Examples include
Goldie Hawn's for her child in "The
Sugarland Express*' and Robert
Shaw's with sharks in "Jaws." But
"Close Encounters" is more di
rectly about obsession than any
thing else Spielberg has done. After
his contact with the UFO, Dreyfuss
is obsessed with a vision of a) large
tower-like rock formation. He con
stantly recreates this image: at din
ner with mashed potatoes; in a dif
ficult and flawed sequence, he be
gins to tear apart the vegetation
around his home and throw it in
side his house, where he forms a

gigantic model of this tower, which
he later discovers to be Wyoming's
Devil's Tower, the landing place for
the alien spaceships. Spielberg is
trying to show us the depth of
Dreyfuss' mania, but the scene is
too long, and Dreyfuss can't make it
work without appearing too forced,
too comical.
Understanding and defining
characters seems to be a weak area -
for Spielberg; he can't delineate a
character in a few broad strokes li ke
Hitchcock can. But you f§ll (espe
cially in this film) that Spielberg is
unconcerned with this problem.
Spielberg must be an enor
< mously confident director; he tries to
make up for his weaknesses with
characters (and also make his
themes work) through strictly vis
ual means. And he's got an uncanny
feel for the visual. With this talent
he is capable of (and produces)
/" great scenes. He exploits this valu
able skill for all that it's worth. In
the film's special effects scenes,
Spielberg overwhelms with his
"visual" sense of power
and majesty the UFOs.
Early* in the film, when Dreyfuss
sights the UFOs, and later when
Melinda Dillon has one pass over -
her house and take her three year
old son (delightfully played by Cary
Guffey), you feel this majestic
power. Along with cinematog
rapher Vilmos Zsigmond (assisted
v by noted cinematographers Doug
las Slocombe and John Alonzo) and
special effects wizard Douglas
Trumbull ("2001"), Spielberg has

given his UFOs a myth, almost re
ligious aura. Using identification
technique, Spielberg takes things
people can easily comprehend (the
shaking of object inside Dillon's
house, or inside Dreyfuss' truck) to
give a sense of the might the aliens
have.
The film saves its spectacular ef
fects for the end. The obsessed
Dreyfuss and Dillon (who also has
receded the vision of Devil's To
wer) manage to get through the
tight security which the govern
ment (which has cleared the area by
reporting a nerve-gas leakage) has
set up around the Tower and its
newly built landing site. At the site,
Truffaut, Dreyfuss and select others
wait. Suddenly it happens. A targe
number of small ships fly by, fol

lowed by an enormous "mother
ship." The ship is an amazing, al
most incomprehensible image. As
it hovers above the landing area
and prepares to open, you can feel
the audience's (and the director's)
excitement. Spielberg is in his ele
ment — the visual — and he's got a
huge canvas.
This climactic scene conveys
Spielberg's own awe; even his
much-criticized showing of the

aliens is consistent with his vision.
Spielberg is trying to humanize the
friendly aliens and yet keep you
impressed with their power. It's a
visual tightrope that Spielberg
walks, and he manages it with stun
ning style.
Spielberg's attitude towards spe
cial effects makes "Close Encoun
ters" a more personal film for an
audience than "Star Wars,'**so in
this sense it is a more satisfying
film. You wonder with the people
in "Encounters;" you wonder at all
the comic-book characters and
wizardry of "Star Wars."
Spielberg has trouble with transi
tion; for example, he doesn't tie in
his opening sequence (the finding
of long-lost planes in a Mexican de
sert) very well with the rest of his
film. This weakness separates him
(for now) from Kubrick, even
though "Close Encounters" 's
climactic scene is the best piece of
science fantasy ever filmed. But
Spielberg is a quick learner; as he
gets older, characters, actors, and
transitions may become stronger
points for him. But one thing he
should keep is his young man's
exuberance. In "Close Encounter,"
Spielberg is like a kid with a new
toy, and this element of his film —
and his talent — are a delightful
thing to behold.
Many people may lose the plot
thread in "Close Encounters" be
cause the action is not verbalized
for the audience. It's gotten to the
point now that if a movie doesn't sit
down and tell you what its plot and
theme are (like "TheTurning Point"
does), people dismiss it for wa % 112
plot and meaning. But a film wtw.i
tells you what its meaning is is far
less satisfying than a film that lets
you discover its themes by using
your feelings about the film and
? your own experience. "Close En
- counters" provides this kind of

freedom for an audience. There is a
story told in "Close Encounters;" it
is a simple and, some say, implaus
ible one. But plausibility isn't im
portant; entertainment and direc
torial vision are, and "Close En
counters" is both entertaining and
visionary. That the plot is simple
shouldn't be held against it; com
plexity is not the key element in a
good plot.
Characterization has been a
problem for all science-fiction/
fantasy films. In "2001," Kubrick
couldn't (or wouldn't) create
characters — except possibly Hal
the computer. The '50s sci-fi films
usually featured some mutation
wreaking havoc on various hu
mans; characterization was forgot
ten in these films. The characters of
"Star Wars" are one-dimentional
comic strip characters; this is part
of its childlike charm. "Close En
counters" tries harder than most SF
films to develop characters, but it
doesn't really succeed. The charac-
in the film are defined, but they
are not fully drawn. The Truffaut
character is especially weak; his
motivations are almost completely
unknown.
The acting in the film is generally
good, but Spielberg doesn't quite
yet know what to do with it. Teri
Garr, playing essentially the same
role she played in "Oh, God!" (the

thread in "Close Encounters" be
cause the action is not verbalized
for the audience. It's gotten to the
point now that if a movie doesn't sit
down and tell you what its plot and
theme are (like "TheTurning Point"
does), people dismiss it for wa % 112
plot and meaning. But a film wtw.i
tells you what its meaning is is far
less satisfying than a film that lets
you discover its themes by using
your feelings about the film and
? your own experience. "Close En
- counters" provides this kind of

freedom for an audience. There is a
story told in "Close Encounters;" it
is a simple and, some say, implaus
ible one. But plausibility isn't im
portant; entertainment and direc
torial vision are, and "Close En
counters" is both entertaining and
visionary. That the plot is simple
shouldn't be held against it; com
plexity is not the key element in a
good plot.
Characterization has been a
problem for all science-fiction/
fantasy films. In "2001," Kubrick
couldn't (or wouldn't) create
characters — except possibly Hal
the computer. The '50s sci-fi films
usually featured some mutation
wreaking havoc on various hu
mans; characterization was forgot
ten in these films. The characters of
"Star Wars" are one-dimentional
comic strip characters; this is part
of its childlike charm. "Close En
counters" tries harder than most SF
films to develop characters, but it
doesn't really succeed. The charac-
in the film are defined, but they
are not fully drawn. The Truffaut
character is especially weak; his
motivations are almost completely
unknown.
The acting in the film is generally
good, but Spielberg doesn't quite
yet know what to do with it. Teri
Garr, playing essentially the same
role she played in "Oh, God!" (the
doubting wife), is largely wasted,
and we don't see her in the second
half of the film. Richard Dreyfuss
can't pull off some of his scenes,
but he is generally likable and be
lievable in his role of Mr. Average
America. The best performance in
the film is given by thqpe-year old
Guffey, who perfectly expresses
the film's childlike wonder.
Many people who go to "Close En
counters" want to see "Star Wars"
over again, and when they don't get
it, they're disappointed. "Close En
counters" is a different experience
than "Star Wars;" each film should
be seen in the context of what it is
trying to fio. "Star Wars" is pure
escapism; "Close Encounters" is a
thematic work which reflects the in
terests of filmmaker Spielberg.
°Both "Close Encounters" and "Star
Wars" feature books by their re
spective directors. This trend may
be a phenomenon of the science
fantasy genre (even Kubrick had a
hand in the "2001" paperback that
came out after the film), or it may
foreshadow the creation of another
role for a director — the novelist.
Spielberg has said: "Movies for
me are a heightehed reality." This is
similar to Hitchcock's statement:
"Drama is life with the dull bits
taken out." "Heightened reality" is
an apt description for "Close En
counters;" it deals with ordinary
people in extraordinary situations.
One final thought: Steven Spiel
berg, after only three feature films
is close to becoming a very great
film artist. "Heightened reality 7 ' is a
vision that's as good as any other
movie vision, and vision is the key
to art.

"We should have total freedom
to do as we like, just so long as it's
not dulL A critic who talks to me
about plausibility is a dull fel
low . . . Some films are slices of
life. Mine are slices of cake." Long
ago, Alfred Hitchcock said that
about his work as a director. But
this comment applies very well to
Steven Spielberg's new film,
"Close Encounters of the Third
Kind." It is a film made by a young
man (30) unconcerned with plausi
bility and mistakes as long as he
entertains. Spielberg's film is a
"slice of cake," a joyous evocation
of awe.
"Close Encounters" has the kind
of childlike wonder, the "gee whiz"
quality that "The Wizard of Oz"
hasf only with the technology
changed. It's flying saucers instead
of flying houses. But "Close En
counters" captivates the audience
in much the same way "Oz" does, /
with its innocence and sense of
curiosity (represented by Garland
in "Oz" and by Richard Dreyfuss in
this film). Spielberg combines this
magical quality with the archetypal
Hitchcock plot; an ordinary man
(Dreyfuss, an electrical worker in
Muncie, Indiana) gets caught in an
situation (contact
withan UFO.)
Besides the film's plot, other re
ferences to Hitchcock are notice
able. One is Spielberg's tongue
in-check use of master French di
rector (and admitted ardent ad
mirer of Hitchcock) Francois Truf
faut in one of the film's lead roles.
Another is a scene reminiscent of
the one in the Hitchcock film
"North by Northwest" when Cary
Grant saves the blonde haired
Eva-Marie Saint from falling off the
face of Mount Rushmore. In a de
liberately low-key homage to that
scene, Spielberg switches the sexes
and has blonde naired Melinda Dil
lon help Richard Dreyfuss up what
is no more than a five-foot high crag
of rock.
Spielberg is influenced by Hitch
cock, but he is not a disciple. He
has his own concerns and areas of
interest. One is the unknown. In.
Spielberg'sTV-movie "Duel," De
nnis Weaver is pursued by an un
known driver in a semi. In "Jaws,"
the shark is the element of mystery.
In "Close Encounters," the un
known is represented by the UFOs.
Another recurring theme in
Spielberg's body of work (three fea
ture films and a couple of TV films)
is obsession. Examples include
Goldie Hawn's for her child in "The
Sugarland Express*' and Robert
Shaw's with sharks in "Jaws." But
"Close Encounters" is more di
rectly about obsession than any
thing else Spielberg has done. After
his contact with the UFO, Dreyfuss
is obsessed with a vision of a) large
tower-like rock formation. He con
stantly recreates this image: at din
ner with mashed potatoes; in a dif
ficult and flawed sequence, he be
gins to tear apart the vegetation
around his home and throw it in
side his house, where he forms a

gigantic model of this tower, which
he later discovers to be Wyoming's
Devil's Tower, the landing place for
the alien spaceships. Spielberg is
trying to show us the depth of
Dreyfuss' mania, but the scene is
too long, and Dreyfuss can't make it
work without appearing too forced,
too comical.
Understanding and defining
characters seems to be a weak area -
for Spielberg; he can't delineate a
character in a few broad strokes li ke
Hitchcock can. But you f§ll (espe
cially in this film) that Spielberg is
unconcerned with this problem.
Spielberg must be an enor
< mously confident director; he tries to
make up for his weaknesses with
characters (and also make his
themes work) through strictly vis
ual means. And he's got an uncanny
feel for the visual. With this talent
he is capable of (and produces)
/" great scenes. He exploits this valu
able skill for all that it's worth. In
the film's special effects scenes,
Spielberg overwhelms with his
"visual" sense of power
and majesty the UFOs.
Early* in the film, when Dreyfuss
sights the UFOs, and later when
Melinda Dillon has one pass over -
her house and take her three year
old son (delightfully played by Cary
Guffey), you feel this majestic
power. Along with cinematog
rapher Vilmos Zsigmond (assisted
v by noted cinematographers Doug
las Slocombe and John Alonzo) and
special effects wizard Douglas
Trumbull ("2001"), Spielberg has

given his UFOs a myth, almost re
ligious aura. Using identification
technique, Spielberg takes things
people can easily comprehend (the
shaking of object inside Dillon's
house, or inside Dreyfuss' truck) to
give a sense of the might the aliens
have.
The film saves its spectacular ef
fects for the end. The obsessed
Dreyfuss and Dillon (who also has
receded the vision of Devil's To
wer) manage to get through the
tight security which the govern
ment (which has cleared the area by
reporting a nerve-gas leakage) has
set up around the Tower and its
newly built landing site. At the site,
Truffaut, Dreyfuss and select others
wait. Suddenly it happens. A targe
number of small ships fly by, fol

lowed by an enormous "mother
ship." The ship is an amazing, al
most incomprehensible image. As
it hovers above the landing area
and prepares to open, you can feel
the audience's (and the director's)
excitement. Spielberg is in his ele
ment — the visual — and he's got a
huge canvas.
This climactic scene conveys
Spielberg's own awe; even his
much-criticized showing of the

aliens is consistent with his vision.
Spielberg is trying to humanize the
friendly aliens and yet keep you
impressed with their power. It's a
visual tightrope that Spielberg
walks, and he manages it with stun
ning style.
Spielberg's attitude towards spe
cial effects makes "Close Encoun
ters" a more personal film for an
audience than "Star Wars,'**so in
this sense it is a more satisfying
film. You wonder with the people
in "Encounters;" you wonder at all
the comic-book characters and
wizardry of "Star Wars."
Spielberg has trouble with transi
tion; for example, he doesn't tie in
his opening sequence (the finding
of long-lost planes in a Mexican de
sert) very well with the rest of his
film. This weakness separates him
(for now) from Kubrick, even
though "Close Encounters" 's
climactic scene is the best piece of
science fantasy ever filmed. But
Spielberg is a quick learner; as he
gets older, characters, actors, and
transitions may become stronger
points for him. But one thing he
should keep is his young man's
exuberance. In "Close Encounter,"
Spielberg is like a kid with a new
toy, and this element of his film —
and his talent — are a delightful
thing to behold.

aliens is consistent with his vision.
Spielberg is trying to humanize the
friendly aliens and yet keep you
impressed with their power. It's a
visual tightrope that Spielberg
walks, and he manages it with stun
ning style.
Spielberg's attitude towards spe
cial effects makes "Close Encoun
ters" a more personal film for an
audience than "Star Wars,'**so in
this sense it is a more satisfying
film. You wonder with the people
in "Encounters;" you wonder at all
the comic-book characters and
wizardry of "Star Wars."
Spielberg has trouble with transi
tion; for example, he doesn't tie in
his opening sequence (the finding
of long-lost planes in a Mexican de
sert) very well with the rest of his
film. This weakness separates him
(for now) from Kubrick, even
though "Close Encounters" 's
climactic scene is the best piece of
science fantasy ever filmed. But
Spielberg is a quick learner; as he
gets older, characters, actors, and
transitions may become stronger
points for him. But one thing he
should keep is his young man's
exuberance. In "Close Encounter,"
Spielberg is like a kid with a new
toy, and this element of his film —
and his talent — are a delightful
thing to behold.
Many people may lose the plot
thread in "Close Encounters" be
cause the action is not verbalized
for the audience. It's gotten to the
point now that if a movie doesn't sit
down and tell you what its plot and
theme are (like "TheTurning Point"
does), people dismiss it for wa % 112
plot and meaning. But a film wtw.i
tells you what its meaning is is far
less satisfying than a film that lets
you discover its themes by using
your feelings about the film and
? your own experience. "Close En
- counters" provides this kind of

freedom for an audience. There is a
story told in "Close Encounters;" it
is a simple and, some say, implaus
ible one. But plausibility isn't im
portant; entertainment and direc
torial vision are, and "Close En
counters" is both entertaining and
visionary. That the plot is simple
shouldn't be held against it; com
plexity is not the key element in a
good plot.
Characterization has been a
problem for all science-fiction/
fantasy films. In "2001," Kubrick
couldn't (or wouldn't) create
characters — except possibly Hal
the computer. The '50s sci-fi films
usually featured some mutation
wreaking havoc on various hu
mans; characterization was forgot
ten in these films. The characters of
"Star Wars" are one-dimentional
comic strip characters; this is part
of its childlike charm. "Close En
counters" tries harder than most SF
films to develop characters, but it
doesn't really succeed. The charac-
in the film are defined, but they
are not fully drawn. The Truffaut
character is especially weak; his
motivations are almost completely
unknown.
The acting in the film is generally
good, but Spielberg doesn't quite
yet know what to do with it. Teri
Garr, playing essentially the same
role she played in "Oh, God!" (the
doubting wife), is largely wasted,
and we don't see her in the second
half of the film. Richard Dreyfuss
can't pull off some of his scenes,
but he is generally likable and be
lievable in his role of Mr. Average
America. The best performance in
the film is given by thqpe-year old
Guffey, who perfectly expresses
the film's childlike wonder.
Many people who go to "Close En
counters" want to see "Star Wars"
over again, and when they don't get
it, they're disappointed. "Close En
counters" is a different experience
than "Star Wars;" each film should
be seen in the context of what it is
trying to fio. "Star Wars" is pure
escapism; "Close Encounters" is a
thematic work which reflects the in
terests of filmmaker Spielberg.
°Both "Close Encounters" and "Star
Wars" feature books by their re
spective directors. This trend may
be a phenomenon of the science
fantasy genre (even Kubrick had a
hand in the "2001" paperback that
came out after the film), or it may
foreshadow the creation of another
role for a director — the novelist.
Spielberg has said: "Movies for
me are a heightehed reality." This is
similar to Hitchcock's statement:
"Drama is life with the dull bits
taken out." "Heightened reality" is
an apt description for "Close En
counters;" it deals with ordinary
people in extraordinary situations.
One final thought: Steven Spiel
berg, after only three feature films
is close to becoming a very great
film artist. "Heightened reality 7 ' is a
vision that's as good as any other
movie vision, and vision is the key
to art.

"We should have total freedom
to do as we like, just so long as it's
not dulL A critic who talks to me
about plausibility is a dull fel
low . . . Some films are slices of
life. Mine are slices of cake." Long
ago, Alfred Hitchcock said that
about his work as a director. But
this comment applies very well to
Steven Spielberg's new film,
"Close Encounters of the Third
Kind." It is a film made by a young
man (30) unconcerned with plausi
bility and mistakes as long as he
entertains. Spielberg's film is a
"slice of cake," a joyous evocation
of awe.
"Close Encounters" has the kind
of childlike wonder, the "gee whiz"
quality that "The Wizard of Oz"
hasf only with the technology
changed. It's flying saucers instead
of flying houses. But "Close En
counters" captivates the audience
in much the same way "Oz" does, /
with its innocence and sense of
curiosity (represented by Garland
in "Oz" and by Richard Dreyfuss in
this film). Spielberg combines this
magical quality with the archetypal
Hitchcock plot; an ordinary man
(Dreyfuss, an electrical worker in
Muncie, Indiana) gets caught in an
situation (contact
withan UFO.)
Besides the film's plot, other re
ferences to Hitchcock are notice
able. One is Spielberg's tongue
in-check use of master French di
rector (and admitted ardent ad
mirer of Hitchcock) Francois Truf
faut in one of the film's lead roles.
Another is a scene reminiscent of
the one in the Hitchcock film
"North by Northwest" when Cary
Grant saves the blonde haired
Eva-Marie Saint from falling off the
face of Mount Rushmore. In a de
liberately low-key homage to that
scene, Spielberg switches the sexes
and has blonde naired Melinda Dil
lon help Richard Dreyfuss up what
is no more than a five-foot high crag
of rock.
Spielberg is influenced by Hitch
cock, but he is not a disciple. He
has his own concerns and areas of
interest. One is the unknown. In.
Spielberg'sTV-movie "Duel," De
nnis Weaver is pursued by an un
known driver in a semi. In "Jaws,"
the shark is the element of mystery.
In "Close Encounters," the un
known is represented by the UFOs.
Another recurring theme in
Spielberg's body of work (three fea
ture films and a couple of TV films)
is obsession. Examples include
Goldie Hawn's for her child in "The
Sugarland Express*' and Robert
Shaw's with sharks in "Jaws." But
"Close Encounters" is more di
rectly about obsession than any
thing else Spielberg has done. After
his contact with the UFO, Dreyfuss
is obsessed with a vision of a) large
tower-like rock formation. He con
stantly recreates this image: at din
ner with mashed potatoes; in a dif
ficult and flawed sequence, he be
gins to tear apart the vegetation
around his home and throw it in
side his house, where he forms a

gigantic model of this tower, which
he later discovers to be Wyoming's
Devil's Tower, the landing place for
the alien spaceships. Spielberg is
trying to show us the depth of
Dreyfuss' mania, but the scene is
too long, and Dreyfuss can't make it
work without appearing too forced,
too comical.
Understanding and defining
characters seems to be a weak area -
for Spielberg; he can't delineate a
character in a few broad strokes li ke
Hitchcock can. But you f§ll (espe
cially in this film) that Spielberg is
unconcerned with this problem.
Spielberg must be an enor
< mously confident director; he tries to
make up for his weaknesses with
characters (and also make his
themes work) through strictly vis
ual means. And he's got an uncanny
feel for the visual. With this talent
he is capable of (and produces)
/" great scenes. He exploits this valu
able skill for all that it's worth. In
the film's special effects scenes,
Spielberg overwhelms with his
"visual" sense of power
and majesty the UFOs.
Early* in the film, when Dreyfuss
sights the UFOs, and later when
Melinda Dillon has one pass over -
her house and take her three year
old son (delightfully played by Cary
Guffey), you feel this majestic
power. Along with cinematog
rapher Vilmos Zsigmond (assisted
v by noted cinematographers Doug

special effects wizard Douglas
Trumbull ("2001"), Spielberg has

given his UFOs a myth, almost re
ligious aura. Using identification
technique, Spielberg takes things
people can easily comprehend (the
shaking of object inside Dillon's
house, or inside Dreyfuss' truck) to
give a sense of the might the aliens
have.
The film saves its spectacular ef
fects for the end. The obsessed
Dreyfuss and Dillon (who also has
receded the vision of Devil's To
wer) manage to get through the
tight security which the govern
ment (which has cleared the area by
reporting a nerve-gas leakage) has
set up around the Tower and its
newly built landing site. At the site,
Truffaut, Dreyfuss and select others
wait. Suddenly it happens. A targe
number of small ships fly by, fol

lowed by an enormous "mother
ship." The ship is an amazing, al
most incomprehensible image. As
it hovers above the landing area
and prepares to open, you can feel
the audience's (and the director's)
excitement. Spielberg is in his ele

given his UFOs a myth, almost re

people can easily comprehend (the

house, or inside Dreyfuss' truck) to
give a sense of the might the aliens
have.
The film saves its spectacular ef

Dreyfuss and Dillon (who also has

reporting a nerve-gas leakage) has
set up around the Tower and its
newly built landing site. At the site,
Truffaut, Dreyfuss and select others
wait. Suddenly it happens. A targe
number of small ships fly by, fol

lowed by an enormous "mother
ship." The ship is an amazing, al
most incomprehensible image. As
it hovers above the landing area

the audience's (and the director's)
excitement. Spielberg is in his ele

aliens is consistent with his vision.
Spielberg is trying to humanize the
friendly aliens and yet keep you
impressed with their power. It's a
visual tightrope that Spielberg
walks, and he manages it with stun
ning style.
Spielberg's attitude towards spe
cial effects makes "Close Encoun
ters" a more personal film for an
audience than "Star Wars,'**so in
this sense it is a more satisfying
film. You wonder with the people
in "Encounters;" you wonder at all
the comic-book characters and
wizardry of "Star Wars."
Spielberg has trouble with transi
tion; for example, he doesn't tie in
his opening sequence (the finding
of long-lost planes in a Mexican de
sert) very well with the rest of his
film. This weakness separates him
(for now) from Kubrick, even
though "Close Encounters" 's
climactic scene is the best piece of
science fantasy ever filmed. But
Spielberg is a quick learner; as he
gets older, characters, actors, and
transitions may become stronger
points for him. But one thing he
should keep is his young man's
exuberance. In "Close Encounter,"
Spielberg is like a kid with a new
toy, and this element of his film —
and his talent — are a delightful
thing to behold.
Many people may lose the plot
thread in "Close Encounters" be
cause the action is not verbalized
for the audience. It's gotten to the
point now that if a movie doesn't sit
down and tell you what its plot and
theme are (like "TheTurning Point"
does), people dismiss it for wa % 112
plot and meaning. But a film wtw.i
tells you what its meaning is is far
less satisfying than a film that lets
you discover its themes by using
your feelings about the film and
? your own experience. "Close En
- counters" provides this kind of

freedom for an audience. There is a
story told in "Close Encounters;" it
is a simple and, some say, implaus
ible one. But plausibility isn't im
portant; entertainment and direc
torial vision are, and "Close En
counters" is both entertaining and
visionary. That the plot is simple
shouldn't be held against it; com
plexity is not the key element in a
good plot.
Characterization has been a
problem for all science-fiction/
fantasy films. In "2001," Kubrick
couldn't (or wouldn't) create
characters — except possibly Hal
the computer. The '50s sci-fi films
usually featured some mutation
wreaking havoc on various hu
mans; characterization was forgot
ten in these films. The characters of
"Star Wars" are one-dimentional
comic strip characters; this is part
of its childlike charm. "Close En
counters" tries harder than most SF
films to develop characters, but it
doesn't really succeed. The charac-
in the film are defined, but they
are not fully drawn. The Truffaut
character is especially weak; his
motivations are almost completely
unknown.
The acting in the film is generally
good, but Spielberg doesn't quite
yet know what to do with it. Teri
Garr, playing essentially the same
role she played in "Oh, God!" (the
doubting wife), is largely wasted,
and we don't see her in the second
half of the film. Richard Dreyfuss
can't pull off some of his scenes,
but he is generally likable and be
lievable in his role of Mr. Average
America. The best performance in
the film is given by thqpe-year old
Guffey, who perfectly expresses
the film's childlike wonder.
Many people who go to "Close En
counters" want to see "Star Wars"
over again, and when they don't get
it, they're disappointed. "Close En
counters" is a different experience
than "Star Wars;" each film should
be seen in the context of what it is
trying to fio. "Star Wars" is pure
escapism; "Close Encounters" is a
thematic work which reflects the in
terests of filmmaker Spielberg.
°Both "Close Encounters" and "Star
Wars" feature books by their re
spective directors. This trend may
be a phenomenon of the science
fantasy genre (even Kubrick had a
hand in the "2001" paperback that
came out after the film), or it may
foreshadow the creation of another
role for a director — the novelist.
Spielberg has said: "Movies for
me are a heightehed reality." This is
similar to Hitchcock's statement:
"Drama is life with the dull bits
taken out." "Heightened reality" is
an apt description for "Close En
counters;" it deals with ordinary
people in extraordinary situations.
One final thought: Steven Spiel
berg, after only three feature films
is close to becoming a very great
film artist. "Heightened reality 7 ' is a
vision that's as good as any other
movie vision, and vision is the key
to art.

"We should have total freedom
to do as we like, just so long as it's
not dulL A critic who talks to me
about plausibility is a dull fel
low . . . Some films are slices of
life. Mine are slices of cake." Long
ago, Alfred Hitchcock said that
about his work as a director. But
this comment applies very well to
Steven Spielberg's new film,
"Close Encounters of the Third
Kind." It is a film made by a young
man (30) unconcerned with plausi
bility and mistakes as long as he
entertains. Spielberg's film is a
"slice of cake," a joyous evocation
of awe.
"Close Encounters" has the kind
of childlike wonder, the "gee whiz"
quality that "The Wizard of Oz"
hasf only with the technology
changed. It's flying saucers instead
of flying houses. But "Close En
counters" captivates the audience
in much the same way "Oz" does, /
with its innocence and sense of
curiosity (represented by Garland
in "Oz" and by Richard Dreyfuss in
this film). Spielberg combines this
magical quality with the archetypal
Hitchcock plot; an ordinary man
(Dreyfuss, an electrical worker in
Muncie, Indiana) gets caught in an
situation (contact
withan UFO.)
Besides the film's plot, other re
ferences to Hitchcock are notice
able. One is Spielberg's tongue
in-check use of master French di
rector (and admitted ardent ad
mirer of Hitchcock) Francois Truf
faut in one of the film's lead roles.
Another is a scene reminiscent of
the one in the Hitchcock film
"North by Northwest" when Cary
Grant saves the blonde haired
Eva-Marie Saint from falling off the
face of Mount Rushmore. In a de
liberately low-key homage to that
scene, Spielberg switches the sexes
and has blonde naired Melinda Dil
lon help Richard Dreyfuss up what
is no more than a five-foot high crag
of rock.
Spielberg is influenced by Hitch
cock, but he is not a disciple. He
has his own concerns and areas of
interest. One is the unknown. In.
Spielberg'sTV-movie "Duel," De
nnis Weaver is pursued by an un
known driver in a semi. In "Jaws,"
the shark is the element of mystery.
In "Close Encounters," the un
known is represented by the UFOs.
Another recurring theme in
Spielberg's body of work (three fea
ture films and a couple of TV films)
is obsession. Examples include
Goldie Hawn's for her child in "The
Sugarland Express*' and Robert
Shaw's with sharks in "Jaws." But
"Close Encounters" is more di
rectly about obsession than any
thing else Spielberg has done. After
his contact with the UFO, Dreyfuss
is obsessed with a vision of a) large
tower-like rock formation. He con
stantly recreates this image: at din
ner with mashed potatoes; in a dif
ficult and flawed sequence, he be
gins to tear apart the vegetation
around his home and throw it in
side his house, where he forms a

gigantic model of this tower, which
he later discovers to be Wyoming's
Devil's Tower, the landing place for
the alien spaceships. Spielberg is
trying to show us the depth of
Dreyfuss' mania, but the scene is
too long, and Dreyfuss can't make it
work without appearing too forced,
too comical.
Understanding and defining
characters seems to be a weak area -
for Spielberg; he can't delineate a
character in a few broad strokes li ke
Hitchcock can. But you f§ll (espe
cially in this film) that Spielberg is
unconcerned with this problem.
Spielberg must be an enor
< mously confident director; he tries to
make up for his weaknesses with
characters (and also make his
themes work) through strictly vis
ual means. And he's got an uncanny
feel for the visual. With this talent
he is capable of (and produces)
/" great scenes. He exploits this valu
able skill for all that it's worth. In
