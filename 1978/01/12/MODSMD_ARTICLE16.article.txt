# Jackson Browne
## may be 'running on empty' but he's got a new, light look 'ON THE ROAD' 
### 
One thing rock music
doesn't need is another
song about the musician's
life on the highway: trave
lin from show to show, the
woman you left at the last
one night stand, booze,
dope, the holiday inn, com
inghomegoinghomeiswhere
Iwannabe cominghomego
ing
homeiswherelwannabe etc.
etc. etc.
So when one of the few
contemporary songwrite r s,
who can boast a style that is
notably above the function
ally literate level, fills an en
tire album with songs about
THE ROAD, the result is not
only a waste of time, but a
waste of talent, right?
Wrong.
lackson Browne's "Run
ning on Empty" is in some
ways his finest album. To be
certain, the kind of lyrics
which have made him one
of America's most re
spected songwriters aren't
present here. As a matter of
fact, of the 10 cuts, only
three are solely Browne
compositions, four being
written by other artists and
three cowritten by Browne
and various compatriots.
No instant tearjerkers
Many of his trademark
themes are missing. There's
no instant tearjerkers like
"My Opening Farewell" or
"Fountain of Sorrow." no
reverent hymns to friends
gone by like "Song for
Adam," or "For a Dancer,"
not even an apocalyptic vis
ion in the "For Everyman,"
"Before the Deluge" mold.
Instead, there's a lot of
good humor and good rock
and roll. Recorded live on
stage, in hotel rooms and
even in a bus, "Running on
Empty" is a loose, spontane
ous collection of highway
songs featuring the best
singing and instrumental
backing to be found on any
Jackson Browne record.
One of the main themes
of his last album, "The Pre
tender," was the all too

rapid passage of time ("The
Fuse," "Daddy's Tune,"
"Sleep's Dark and Silent
Gate," "The Pretender").
The title track of the new
album picks up where "The
Pretender" left off, as the
author still sees himself
growing older by the day.
But now instead of building
a home "in the shade of the
freeway," he's running on
empty down the great free
way of life — a typical L.A.
rock metaphor that also
runs low on originality.
Licks not lines
But the beauty of this re
cord lies not in originality so
much as in performance.
For example, the first half of
Danny O'Keefe's "The
Road" is recorded in a hotel
room with Browne's guitar
and voice accompanied
only by David Lindley's fid
dle.
"The ladies come to see you
If you're name still rings a
bell
They give you damn near
nothin'
And they'll say they knew
you well
So you tell 'em you'll re
member
But they know it's just a
game
And along the way their
faces
All begin to look the same"
Midway through the song
there is a pause, followed by
a perfect blending into an
onstage version with full in
strumentation. The impact
is devastating as Browne,
following the refuge of the
hotel room, performs the
final verse to . . just
another town along the
road."
Give him a break
But enough thematic in
terpretation. Most reviews
of Jackson Browne albums
end up sounding like En
glish term papers, and be
sides, his devotees have no
doubt already dissected
every line of every song to
determine just where their
hero stands today. But give

the man a break. Go ahead
and scrutinize the lyrics on
his first four albums, but
just sit back and have as
good a time listening to this
one as the band obviously
had recording it.
Musically, Browne's writ
ing always remains within a
simple chord framework,
but the strength of his ever
improving vocals and the
performance of his backing
band always keep things in
teresting. David Lidley, on
slide guitar and fiddle, is
one of the premiere in
strumentalists in the busi
ness. In an age dominated
bysequinned rock guitarists
who play amelodic lines at
ridiculous speeds, Lindley
plays with a restraint that is
as flawless as it is ana
chronistic. Rather than clut
tering songs with needless
chords and filler licks, he
gives each tune special
treatment, playing only
what is essential in com
plementing Browne's sing
ing. When he does take off,
as on "You Love the Thun
der," the result is some of
the tastiest slide playing in
recent memory.
The Section
Guitarist Danny "Kootch"
Kortchmar, drummer Russ
Kunkell, bassist Leland Sklar
and keyboard man Craig
Doerge, known collectively
as The Section, comprise
the rest of the band. These
four, widely known for their
work with lames Taylor,
Crosby and Nash, and a
myriad of others; are be
coming something of star
themselves, and for good
reason. Coupled with
Lindley, The Section pro
vides Browne with the most
powerful backing he's ever
taken on the road.
Kortchmar wrote the open
ing song on side two,
"Shaky Town," and in so
doing accomplished a
nearly impossible feat —
writing a song about truc
kers that not only refrains
from being overtly obnoxi

ous, but actually is quite en
joyable.
Warm humor
One thing lacking in
Browne's earlier recorded
work (with the exception of
"For Everyman's" "Ready or
Not") has been the expres
sion of the warm sense of
humor he displays on stage,
but "Running On Empty"
should dispel the criticism
of.those who find him too
serious. In "Rosie," cowrit
ten with production man
ager Donald Miller, he sings
from a roadie's point of view
about a young woman he
lets backstage, only to see
her run off with the drum
mer:
"But Rosie you're alright—
you wear my ring
When you hold me tight—
Rosie that's my thing
Whenyou turn out the light,
I've got to hand it to me"
The Rev. Gary Davis'
"Cocaine," long an in
concert standard of
Browne's, features some
new lyrics including a line
about the album's engineer,
Greg Ladanyi:
"Late last night about a
quarter past four
Ladanyi came knockin'
down my hotel room
door
Where's the cocaine—
It's runnin' all 'round my
brain"
Last words
Interestingly, Browne has
always chosen to make his
biggest statement with the
final songs on his albums:
the wistful "From Silver
Lake," "For Everyman,"
"Before the Deluge," and of
course, "The Pretender."
But the usual bigfinish gives
way on the new album to
easy-going rock and roll.
It closes with a medley of
"The Load Out" and an
early '60s schlock-rock
standard, "Stay." "The
Load-Out" not only pre

sents a further depiction of
the hotel room life, but is
alsoatribute to the roadies:
"Now roll them cases out
and lift them amps
Haul them trusses down
and get 'em up them
ramps
Cause when it comes to
moving me
You guys are the champs"
It's hardly one of his finer
lyrical moments, but it ob
viously wasn't meant to be.
Lasting words
Jackson's Browne is one
of only a handful of con
temporary lyricists, Joni
Mitchell, Paul Simon and
Randy Newman among
them, whose work can be
taken seriously on more
than just a pop music level.
His first four albums are all
classics of some sort:
"Jackson Browne," which
Rolling Stone's Cameron
Crowe termed a "Southern
California 'Catcher in the
Rye;' "For Everyman," which
proved the writer to be the
best interpreter of the
often-recorded "These
Days," and also gave us the
title song, quite possibly his
greatest composition; "Late
for the Sky," which pre
sented the fatalism of "For a
Dancer" on the same side as
the hope for salvation ex
pressed in "Before the De
luge," with "Walking Slow"
in between no less; and
"The Pretender," a medita
tion on aging and maturing
unlike anything else rock in
its infinite infancy has ever
produced.
"Running on Empty"
shows his audience another
side, accenting the loose,
humorous and rocking
parts of lackson Browne's
music. Taken in light of and
in conjunction with his ear
lier albums, it presents a
portrait of the closest thing
to a complete artist rock has
in the 19705.

one of the premiere in
strumentalists in the busi
ness. In an age dominated
bysequinned rock guitarists
who play amelodic lines at
ridiculous speeds, Lindley
plays with a restraint that is
as flawless as it is ana
chronistic. Rather than clut
tering songs with needless
chords and filler licks, he
gives each tune special
treatment, playing only
what is essential in com
plementing Browne's sing
ing. When he does take off,
as on "You Love the Thun
der," the result is some of
the tastiest slide playing in
recent memory.
The Section
Guitarist Danny "Kootch"
Kortchmar, drummer Russ
Kunkell, bassist Leland Sklar
and keyboard man Craig
Doerge, known collectively
as The Section, comprise
the rest of the band. These
four, widely known for their
work with lames Taylor,
Crosby and Nash, and a
myriad of others; are be
coming something of star
themselves, and for good
reason. Coupled with
Lindley, The Section pro
vides Browne with the most
powerful backing he's ever
taken on the road.
Kortchmar wrote the open
ing song on side two,
"Shaky Town," and in so
doing accomplished a
nearly impossible feat —
writing a song about truc
kers that not only refrains
from being overtly obnoxi

ous, but actually is quite en
joyable.
Warm humor
One thing lacking in
Browne's earlier recorded
work (with the exception of
"For Everyman's" "Ready or
Not") has been the expres
sion of the warm sense of
humor he displays on stage,
but "Running On Empty"
should dispel the criticism
of.those who find him too
serious. In "Rosie," cowrit
ten with production man
ager Donald Miller, he sings
from a roadie's point of view
about a young woman he
lets backstage, only to see
her run off with the drum
mer:
"But Rosie you're alright—
you wear my ring
When you hold me tight—
Rosie that's my thing
Whenyou turn out the light,
I've got to hand it to me"
The Rev. Gary Davis'
"Cocaine," long an in
concert standard of
Browne's, features some
new lyrics including a line
about the album's engineer,
Greg Ladanyi:
"Late last night about a
quarter past four
Ladanyi came knockin'
down my hotel room
door
Where's the cocaine—
It's runnin' all 'round my
brain"
Last words
Interestingly, Browne has
always chosen to make his
biggest statement with the
final songs on his albums:
the wistful "From Silver
Lake," "For Everyman,"
"Before the Deluge," and of
course, "The Pretender."
But the usual bigfinish gives
way on the new album to
easy-going rock and roll.
It closes with a medley of
"The Load Out" and an
early '60s schlock-rock
standard, "Stay." "The
Load-Out" not only pre

sents a further depiction of
the hotel room life, but is
alsoatribute to the roadies:
"Now roll them cases out
and lift them amps
Haul them trusses down
and get 'em up them
ramps
Cause when it comes to
moving me
You guys are the champs"
It's hardly one of his finer
lyrical moments, but it ob
viously wasn't meant to be.
Lasting words
Jackson's Browne is one
of only a handful of con
temporary lyricists, Joni
Mitchell, Paul Simon and
Randy Newman among
them, whose work can be
taken seriously on more
than just a pop music level.
His first four albums are all
classics of some sort:
"Jackson Browne," which
Rolling Stone's Cameron
Crowe termed a "Southern
California 'Catcher in the
Rye;' "For Everyman," which
proved the writer to be the
best interpreter of the
often-recorded "These
Days," and also gave us the
title song, quite possibly his
greatest composition; "Late
for the Sky," which pre
sented the fatalism of "For a
Dancer" on the same side as
the hope for salvation ex
pressed in "Before the De
luge," with "Walking Slow"
in between no less; and
"The Pretender," a medita
tion on aging and maturing
unlike anything else rock in
its infinite infancy has ever
produced.
"Running on Empty"
shows his audience another
side, accenting the loose,
humorous and rocking
parts of lackson Browne's
music. Taken in light of and
in conjunction with his ear
lier albums, it presents a
portrait of the closest thing
to a complete artist rock has
in the 19705.
—TOM CASCIATO

One thing rock music
doesn't need is another
song about the musician's
life on the highway: trave
lin from show to show, the
woman you left at the last
one night stand, booze,
dope, the holiday inn, com
inghomegoinghomeiswhere
Iwannabe cominghomego
ing
homeiswherelwannabe etc.
etc. etc.
So when one of the few
contemporary songwrite r s,
who can boast a style that is
notably above the function
ally literate level, fills an en
tire album with songs about
THE ROAD, the result is not
only a waste of time, but a
waste of talent, right?
Wrong.
lackson Browne's "Run
ning on Empty" is in some
ways his finest album. To be
certain, the kind of lyrics
which have made him one
of America's most re
spected songwriters aren't
present here. As a matter of
fact, of the 10 cuts, only
three are solely Browne
compositions, four being
written by other artists and
three cowritten by Browne
and various compatriots.
No instant tearjerkers
Many of his trademark
themes are missing. There's
no instant tearjerkers like
"My Opening Farewell" or
"Fountain of Sorrow." no
reverent hymns to friends
gone by like "Song for
Adam," or "For a Dancer,"
not even an apocalyptic vis
ion in the "For Everyman,"
"Before the Deluge" mold.
Instead, there's a lot of
good humor and good rock
and roll. Recorded live on
stage, in hotel rooms and
even in a bus, "Running on
Empty" is a loose, spontane
ous collection of highway
songs featuring the best
singing and instrumental
backing to be found on any
Jackson Browne record.
One of the main themes
of his last album, "The Pre
tender," was the all too

rapid passage of time ("The
Fuse," "Daddy's Tune,"
"Sleep's Dark and Silent
Gate," "The Pretender").
The title track of the new
album picks up where "The
Pretender" left off, as the
author still sees himself
growing older by the day.
But now instead of building
a home "in the shade of the
freeway," he's running on
empty down the great free
way of life — a typical L.A.
rock metaphor that also
runs low on originality.
Licks not lines
But the beauty of this re
cord lies not in originality so
much as in performance.
For example, the first half of
Danny O'Keefe's "The
Road" is recorded in a hotel
room with Browne's guitar
and voice accompanied
only by David Lindley's fid
dle.
"The ladies come to see you
If you're name still rings a
bell
They give you damn near
nothin'
And they'll say they knew
you well
So you tell 'em you'll re
member
But they know it's just a
game
And along the way their
faces
All begin to look the same"
Midway through the song
there is a pause, followed by
a perfect blending into an
onstage version with full in
strumentation. The impact
is devastating as Browne,
following the refuge of the
hotel room, performs the
final verse to . . just
another town along the
road."
Give him a break
But enough thematic in
terpretation. Most reviews
of Jackson Browne albums
end up sounding like En
glish term papers, and be
sides, his devotees have no
doubt already dissected
every line of every song to
determine just where their
hero stands today. But give

the man a break. Go ahead
and scrutinize the lyrics on
his first four albums, but
just sit back and have as
good a time listening to this
one as the band obviously
had recording it.
Musically, Browne's writ
ing always remains within a
simple chord framework,
but the strength of his ever
improving vocals and the
performance of his backing
band always keep things in
teresting. David Lidley, on
slide guitar and fiddle, is
one of the premiere in
strumentalists in the busi
ness. In an age dominated
bysequinned rock guitarists
who play amelodic lines at
ridiculous speeds, Lindley
plays with a restraint that is
as flawless as it is ana
chronistic. Rather than clut
tering songs with needless
chords and filler licks, he
gives each tune special

sented the fatalism of "For a

the hope for salvation ex
pressed in "Before the De

in between no less; and
"The Pretender," a medita
tion on aging and maturing
unlike anything else rock in
its infinite infancy has ever
produced.
"Running on Empty"
shows his audience another
side, accenting the loose,

portrait of the closest thing

—TOM CASCIATO

One thing rock music
doesn't need is another
song about the musician's
life on the highway: trave
lin from show to show, the
woman you left at the last
one night stand, booze,
dope, the holiday inn, com
inghomegoinghomeiswhere
Iwannabe cominghomego
ing
homeiswherelwannabe etc.
etc. etc.
So when one of the few
contemporary songwrite r s,
who can boast a style that is
notably above the function
ally literate level, fills an en
tire album with songs about
THE ROAD, the result is not
only a waste of time, but a
waste of talent, right?
Wrong.
lackson Browne's "Run
ning on Empty" is in some
ways his finest album. To be
certain, the kind of lyrics
which have made him one
of America's most re
spected songwriters aren't
present here. As a matter of
fact, of the 10 cuts, only
three are solely Browne
compositions, four being
written by other artists and
three cowritten by Browne
and various compatriots.
No instant tearjerkers
Many of his trademark
themes are missing. There's
no instant tearjerkers like
"My Opening Farewell" or
"Fountain of Sorrow." no
reverent hymns to friends
gone by like "Song for
Adam," or "For a Dancer,"
not even an apocalyptic vis
ion in the "For Everyman,"
"Before the Deluge" mold.
Instead, there's a lot of
good humor and good rock
and roll. Recorded live on
stage, in hotel rooms and
even in a bus, "Running on
Empty" is a loose, spontane
ous collection of highway
songs featuring the best
singing and instrumental
backing to be found on any
Jackson Browne record.
One of the main themes
of his last album, "The Pre
tender," was the all too

rapid passage of time ("The
Fuse," "Daddy's Tune,"
"Sleep's Dark and Silent
Gate," "The Pretender").
The title track of the new
album picks up where "The
Pretender" left off, as the
author still sees himself
growing older by the day.
But now instead of building
a home "in the shade of the
freeway," he's running on
empty down the great free
way of life — a typical L.A.
rock metaphor that also
runs low on originality.
Licks not lines
But the beauty of this re
cord lies not in originality so
much as in performance.
For example, the first half of
Danny O'Keefe's "The
Road" is recorded in a hotel
room with Browne's guitar
and voice accompanied
only by David Lindley's fid
dle.
"The ladies come to see you
If you're name still rings a
bell
They give you damn near
nothin'
And they'll say they knew
you well
So you tell 'em you'll re
member
But they know it's just a
game
And along the way their
faces
All begin to look the same"
Midway through the song
there is a pause, followed by
a perfect blending into an
onstage version with full in
strumentation. The impact
is devastating as Browne,
following the refuge of the
hotel room, performs the
final verse to . . just
another town along the
road."
Give him a break
But enough thematic in
terpretation. Most reviews
of Jackson Browne albums
end up sounding like En
glish term papers, and be
sides, his devotees have no
doubt already dissected
every line of every song to
determine just where their
hero stands today. But give

the man a break. Go ahead
and scrutinize the lyrics on
his first four albums, but
just sit back and have as
good a time listening to this
one as the band obviously
had recording it.
Musically, Browne's writ
ing always remains within a
simple chord framework,
but the strength of his ever
improving vocals and the
performance of his backing
band always keep things in
teresting. David Lidley, on
slide guitar and fiddle, is
one of the premiere in
strumentalists in the busi
ness. In an age dominated
bysequinned rock guitarists
who play amelodic lines at
ridiculous speeds, Lindley
plays with a restraint that is
as flawless as it is ana
chronistic. Rather than clut
tering songs with needless
chords and filler licks, he
gives each tune special
treatment, playing only
what is essential in com
plementing Browne's sing
ing. When he does take off,
as on "You Love the Thun
der," the result is some of
the tastiest slide playing in
recent memory.
The Section
Guitarist Danny "Kootch"
Kortchmar, drummer Russ
Kunkell, bassist Leland Sklar
and keyboard man Craig
Doerge, known collectively
as The Section, comprise
the rest of the band. These
four, widely known for their
work with lames Taylor,
Crosby and Nash, and a
myriad of others; are be
coming something of star
themselves, and for good
reason. Coupled with
Lindley, The Section pro
vides Browne with the most
powerful backing he's ever
taken on the road.
Kortchmar wrote the open
ing song on side two,
"Shaky Town," and in so
doing accomplished a
nearly impossible feat —
writing a song about truc
kers that not only refrains
from being overtly obnoxi

ous, but actually is quite en
joyable.
Warm humor
One thing lacking in
Browne's earlier recorded
work (with the exception of
"For Everyman's" "Ready or
Not") has been the expres
sion of the warm sense of
humor he displays on stage,
but "Running On Empty"
should dispel the criticism
of.those who find him too
serious. In "Rosie," cowrit
ten with production man
ager Donald Miller, he sings
from a roadie's point of view
about a young woman he
lets backstage, only to see
her run off with the drum
mer:
"But Rosie you're alright—
you wear my ring
When you hold me tight—
Rosie that's my thing
Whenyou turn out the light,
I've got to hand it to me"
The Rev. Gary Davis'
"Cocaine," long an in
concert standard of
Browne's, features some
new lyrics including a line
about the album's engineer,
Greg Ladanyi:
"Late last night about a
quarter past four
Ladanyi came knockin'
down my hotel room
door
Where's the cocaine—
It's runnin' all 'round my
brain"
Last words
Interestingly, Browne has
always chosen to make his
biggest statement with the
final songs on his albums:
the wistful "From Silver
Lake," "For Everyman,"
"Before the Deluge," and of
course, "The Pretender."
But the usual bigfinish gives
way on the new album to
easy-going rock and roll.
It closes with a medley of
"The Load Out" and an
early '60s schlock-rock
standard, "Stay." "The
Load-Out" not only pre

sents a further depiction of
the hotel room life, but is
alsoatribute to the roadies:
"Now roll them cases out
and lift them amps
Haul them trusses down
and get 'em up them
ramps
Cause when it comes to
moving me
You guys are the champs"
It's hardly one of his finer
lyrical moments, but it ob
viously wasn't meant to be.
Lasting words
Jackson's Browne is one
of only a handful of con
temporary lyricists, Joni
Mitchell, Paul Simon and
Randy Newman among
them, whose work can be
taken seriously on more
than just a pop music level.
His first four albums are all
classics of some sort:
"Jackson Browne," which
Rolling Stone's Cameron
Crowe termed a "Southern
California 'Catcher in the
Rye;' "For Everyman," which
proved the writer to be the
best interpreter of the
often-recorded "These
Days," and also gave us the
title song, quite possibly his
greatest composition; "Late
for the Sky," which pre
sented the fatalism of "For a
Dancer" on the same side as
the hope for salvation ex
pressed in "Before the De
luge," with "Walking Slow"
in between no less; and
"The Pretender," a medita
tion on aging and maturing
unlike anything else rock in
its infinite infancy has ever
produced.
"Running on Empty"
shows his audience another

humorous and rocking

glish term papers, and be
sides, his devotees have no
doubt already dissected
every line of every song to
determine just where their
hero stands today. But give

the man a break. Go ahead
and scrutinize the lyrics on
his first four albums, but
just sit back and have as
good a time listening to this
one as the band obviously
had recording it.
Musically, Browne's writ
ing always remains within a
simple chord framework,
but the strength of his ever
improving vocals and the
performance of his backing
band always keep things in
teresting. David Lidley, on
slide guitar and fiddle, is
one of the premiere in
strumentalists in the busi
ness. In an age dominated
bysequinned rock guitarists
who play amelodic lines at
ridiculous speeds, Lindley
plays with a restraint that is
as flawless as it is ana
chronistic. Rather than clut
tering songs with needless
chords and filler licks, he
gives each tune special
treatment, playing only
what is essential in com
plementing Browne's sing
ing. When he does take off,
as on "You Love the Thun
der," the result is some of
the tastiest slide playing in
recent memory.
The Section
Guitarist Danny "Kootch"
Kortchmar, drummer Russ
Kunkell, bassist Leland Sklar
and keyboard man Craig
Doerge, known collectively
as The Section, comprise
the rest of the band. These
four, widely known for their
work with lames Taylor,
Crosby and Nash, and a
myriad of others; are be
coming something of star
themselves, and for good
reason. Coupled with
Lindley, The Section pro
vides Browne with the most
powerful backing he's ever
taken on the road.
Kortchmar wrote the open
ing song on side two,
"Shaky Town," and in so
doing accomplished a
nearly impossible feat —
writing a song about truc
kers that not only refrains
from being overtly obnoxi

ous, but actually is quite en
joyable.
Warm humor
One thing lacking in
Browne's earlier recorded
work (with the exception of
"For Everyman's" "Ready or
Not") has been the expres
sion of the warm sense of
humor he displays on stage,
but "Running On Empty"
should dispel the criticism
of.those who find him too
serious. In "Rosie," cowrit
ten with production man
ager Donald Miller, he sings
from a roadie's point of view
about a young woman he
lets backstage, only to see
her run off with the drum
mer:
"But Rosie you're alright—
you wear my ring
When you hold me tight—
Rosie that's my thing
Whenyou turn out the light,
I've got to hand it to me"
The Rev. Gary Davis'
"Cocaine," long an in
concert standard of
Browne's, features some
new lyrics including a line
about the album's engineer,
Greg Ladanyi:
"Late last night about a
quarter past four
Ladanyi came knockin'
down my hotel room
door
Where's the cocaine—
It's runnin' all 'round my
brain"
Last words
Interestingly, Browne has
always chosen to make his
biggest statement with the
final songs on his albums:
the wistful "From Silver
Lake," "For Everyman,"
"Before the Deluge," and of
course, "The Pretender."
But the usual bigfinish gives
way on the new album to
easy-going rock and roll.
It closes with a medley of
"The Load Out" and an
early '60s schlock-rock
standard, "Stay." "The
Load-Out" not only pre

sents a further depiction of
the hotel room life, but is
alsoatribute to the roadies:
"Now roll them cases out
and lift them amps
Haul them trusses down
and get 'em up them
ramps
Cause when it comes to
moving me
You guys are the champs"
It's hardly one of his finer
lyrical moments, but it ob
viously wasn't meant to be.
Lasting words
Jackson's Browne is one
of only a handful of con
temporary lyricists, Joni
Mitchell, Paul Simon and
Randy Newman among
them, whose work can be
taken seriously on more
than just a pop music level.
His first four albums are all
classics of some sort:
"Jackson Browne," which
Rolling Stone's Cameron
Crowe termed a "Southern
California 'Catcher in the
Rye;' "For Everyman," which
proved the writer to be the
best interpreter of the
often-recorded "These
Days," and also gave us the
title song, quite possibly his
greatest composition; "Late
for the Sky," which pre
sented the fatalism of "For a
Dancer" on the same side as
the hope for salvation ex
pressed in "Before the De
luge," with "Walking Slow"
in between no less; and
"The Pretender," a medita
tion on aging and maturing
unlike anything else rock in
its infinite infancy has ever
produced.
"Running on Empty"
shows his audience another
side, accenting the loose,
humorous and rocking
parts of lackson Browne's
music. Taken in light of and
in conjunction with his ear
lier albums, it presents a
portrait of the closest thing
to a complete artist rock has
in the 19705.
—TOM CASCIATO

One thing rock music
doesn't need is another
song about the musician's
life on the highway: trave
lin from show to show, the
woman you left at the last
one night stand, booze,
dope, the holiday inn, com
inghomegoinghomeiswhere
Iwannabe cominghomego
ing
homeiswherelwannabe etc.
etc. etc.
So when one of the few
contemporary songwrite r s,
who can boast a style that is
notably above the function
ally literate level, fills an en
tire album with songs about
THE ROAD, the result is not
only a waste of time, but a
waste of talent, right?
Wrong.
lackson Browne's "Run
ning on Empty" is in some
ways his finest album. To be
certain, the kind of lyrics
which have made him one
of America's most re
spected songwriters aren't
present here. As a matter of
fact, of the 10 cuts, only
three are solely Browne
compositions, four being
written by other artists and
three cowritten by Browne
and various compatriots.
No instant tearjerkers
Many of his trademark
themes are missing. There's
no instant tearjerkers like
"My Opening Farewell" or
"Fountain of Sorrow." no
reverent hymns to friends
gone by like "Song for
Adam," or "For a Dancer,"
not even an apocalyptic vis
ion in the "For Everyman,"
"Before the Deluge" mold.
Instead, there's a lot of
good humor and good rock
and roll. Recorded live on
stage, in hotel rooms and
even in a bus, "Running on
Empty" is a loose, spontane
ous collection of highway
songs featuring the best
singing and instrumental
backing to be found on any
Jackson Browne record.
One of the main themes
of his last album, "The Pre
tender," was the all too

rapid passage of time ("The
Fuse," "Daddy's Tune,"
"Sleep's Dark and Silent
Gate," "The Pretender").
The title track of the new
album picks up where "The
Pretender" left off, as the
author still sees himself
growing older by the day.
But now instead of building
a home "in the shade of the
freeway," he's running on
empty down the great free
way of life — a typical L.A.
rock metaphor that also
runs low on originality.
Licks not lines
But the beauty of this re
cord lies not in originality so
much as in performance.
For example, the first half of
Danny O'Keefe's "The
Road" is recorded in a hotel
room with Browne's guitar
and voice accompanied
only by David Lindley's fid
dle.
"The ladies come to see you
If you're name still rings a
bell
They give you damn near
nothin'
And they'll say they knew
you well
So you tell 'em you'll re
member
But they know it's just a
game
And along the way their
faces
All begin to look the same"
Midway through the song
there is a pause, followed by
a perfect blending into an
onstage version with full in
strumentation. The impact
is devastating as Browne,
following the refuge of the
hotel room, performs the
final verse to . . just
another town along the
road."
Give him a break
But enough thematic in
terpretation. Most reviews
of Jackson Browne albums
end up sounding like En
glish term papers, and be
sides, his devotees have no
doubt already dissected
every line of every song to
determine just where their
hero stands today. But give

the man a break. Go ahead
and scrutinize the lyrics on
his first four albums, but
just sit back and have as
