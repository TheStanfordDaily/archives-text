# The 						big band ain't dead and Baker's horn is hot
## The 						big bandleaders 
### 
One of the widely-repeated state
ments about jazz is that the big band is
dead. Partially because of rising musi
cians' wages and partially because of
changing tastes in music the big band
has all but faded from the jazz scene.
For this reason, jazz fans are very for
tunate to have the Thad Jones-Mel
Lewis Band. Not only is it the best big
band around, very few of its com
petitors can even come close to it. Its
music is modern without resorting to
the trite effects of Maynard Ferguson's
or Don Ellis's group. One can safely bet
that the Thad lones-Mel Lewis band will
never be recording the theme from
"Star Wars" or 'Rocky."
Their latest album, "Live in Munich,"
is, as the title indicates, a stirring re
cording of a September, 1976 concert.
The band flourishes in the live context.
The music is excellent and the solos
inspired.
As usual the Lewis-Jones band con
stantly surprises the listener. All of a
sudden, the band will fade out for a
piano solp, then there will be an unex
pected ensemble at breakneck tempo
without rhythm section. At the least ex
pected moment the reeds will break in
with cascading passage in the high re
gister. The music constantly envelops
and invites the listener.
Too superb?
The arrangements are superb, some
times too superb. The brilliance of the
band often overshadows the consider
able talents of the soloists. Particularly
creditable performances are contri
buted by leader Thad Jones on cornet
and lerry Dodgion on soprano sax.
Thad's playing on Duke Ellington's
lovelv "Come Sunday" is one of the
album's nicer moments, lone's playing
is tluid with a very beautiful tone.
The band's other leader, Mel Lewis,is

the perfect big band drummer. His
playing is to the point and very much
like Jo Jone's work with Count Basie's
band. He always succeeds in propelling
the band, yet is never obtrusive or ver
bose.
Fast rise
The Thad Jones-Mel Lewis band
began several years ago as a rehearsal
band. Soon, however, their Monday
night appearances at New York's Vil
lage Vanguard brought them considera
ble attention. The band has retained its
general excellence despite numerous
changes in personnel. The band's ap
pearances on the west coast are all too
rare — it still manages to spend most of
the year in New York.
"Live in Munich" should be of in
terest to those who have their doubts
about the viability of a big band in the
late '70s. The Thad Jones-Mel Lewis
Band should quell those doubts.
Chet Baker:
You Can't Go Home Again
Horizon
Trumpeter Chet Baker has been ig
nored for all too many years. His recent

work on the Horizon label, in particular
"You Can't Co Home Again," may help
rectify this.
One reason for this is that Baker's
album is extremely polished without
being too slick or contrived. It is in
teresting to note that during the '60s,
jazz suffered from a lack of polish —
many recording sessions sounded like
hastily-arranged jam sessions. During
the past several years, just the opposite
has been true as more and more artists
have overproduced their albums with a
maximum of lush arrangements and a
minimum of jazz. Baker's "You Can't
Go Home Again" is a perfect balance
between the extremes.
The ensemble passages are tight and
the arrangements are sometimes com
plex (with even string orchestra parts),
yet the arrangements never get in the
way. The sidemen get plenty of room to
solo and use the time well.
Strong backup
Much of the success of the album
depends on the excellent backup musi
cians which Baker uses. Richard
Beirach and Kenny Barron are two of

the finest young pianists around; bass
is gracefully handled by Alphonso
lohnson and Ron Carter (who seems to
be on every record nowadays). Michael
Brecker plays some of his best sax to
date and Tony Williams is the most un
derrated drummer in jazz, if not the
best.
Special note must be made of the
contribution of alto saxophonist Paul
Desmond. Desmond plays on only one
number, which was recorded shortly
before his death last spring, yet his solo
on the beautiful ballad, which is the
title track, is perhaps the album's high
light.
The album consists of four diverse
selections, two standards and two orig
inals. The standards are Cole Porter's
"Love for Sale" and the rarely heard
"Un Poco Loco."
The original compositions, both by
arranger Don Sebesky, are excellent
numbes. The title cut, as I mentioned,
is a beautiful lyric ballad, much in the
style of Chuck Mangione at his best.
The other, "El Morro," is a rockish
number with some compelling solo
work by Baker.
Jazz-rock twist
The album often leans toward the
jazz-rock fusion which is so popular to
day, yet its strong jazz element and fine
music cause it to definitely stand out
from other similar efforts. In thisway, it
would serve as an excellent introduc
tion to someone just starting to listen to
jazz.
Musicians will appreciate the trans
cription of Chet Baker's solo on "Un
Poco loco" which is included on the
inside sleeve. It allows the listener to
follow more closely the process of im
provisation as done by one of the best
around.
