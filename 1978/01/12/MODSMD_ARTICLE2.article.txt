Park signs cooperation pledge
Seoul, Korea (AP) — Tong-sun Park signed an ag
reement yesterday pledging to cooperate with Justice
Department investigations into his alleged Korean
influence buying operation in Washington.
But Park refused to say if he will testify before
congressional committees.
The agreement, signed before acting U.S. Deputy
Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, completed ar
rangements for the justice Department's questioning
of Park, due to start Friday.
The memorandum said Park would tell the truth to
American investigators in Seoul and, if required, in
American courts, in return for immunity from crimi
nal charges.
Park has been indicted by a U.S. federal grand jury
on 36 counts of bribery, fraud and other charges.
More than 20 former and present congressmen
have acknowledged receiving money or gifts from
Park but deny any wrongdoing. Park also denies crim
inal guilt.
FBI investigates state politics
Sacramento (AP) — The FBI said yesterday it is inves
tigating "possible political corruption" in California,
a probe one report said involved suspected vote
buying in the Legislature.
Top political leaders of both parties confirmed they
had been questioned by FBI agents or called before a
federal grand jury, but all said they were personally
not targets of the investigation, which numerous re
ports say centers on a Howard Hughes empire lob
byist.
Assembly Speaker Leo McCarthy of San Francisco
and minority floor leader Paul Priolo of Malibu, the
Democratic and Republican leaders of the Assembly,
both confirmed they had been contacted by FBI
agents. Former Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti tes
tified before a grand jury.
The FBI Sacramento office released a statement
confirming an investigation was underway but refus
ing to discuss details.
But Assemblyman Louis Papan, a former FBI agent,
said the probe involved dealings of some lobbyists
and legislators, dealings the San Francisco Examiner
said included suspected vote-buying.
Three-year low in jobless rate
Washington (AP) — President limmy Carter hailed

as "good news for the country" the Labor Depart
ment's report yesterday that the December jobless
rate fell to 6.4 percent, its lowest level in more than
three years.
The half a percentage point decline from
November's 6.9 percent level broke an eight-month
pattern that has seen the unemployment rate bounce
between 6.9 percent and 7.1 percent.
Unemployment stood at 7.3 percent when Carter
took office last lanuary and the administration set a
goal of reducing joblessness to 6.6 percent by year
end.
"The statistics look good," the President said at a
hastily called White House meeting with reporters
and Charles Schultze, his chief economic adviser.
Carter spoke hopefully of further improvements this
year with the aid of his proposed tax cut.
The Labor Department said a record 58 percent of
the population was working last month. Over the
year, employment increased by 4.1 million to a total
of 92.6 million — the biggest 12-month increase since
World War 11.
HEW: cigarettes enemy No. 1
Washington (AP) — HEW Secretary Joseph Califano
launched a massive government attack yesterday on
cigarette smoking, declaring it "public health enemy
No. 1" and a killer of thousands of Americans.
Califano promised help to the nation's 54 million
smokers to quit the habit. The government will ex
pand its smoking research and urge broadcasters and
educators to spread the message that "smoking
maims, smoking kills."
Tobacco growers urged President Carter to get
Califano "back down to earth" after his announce
ment of the $24 million campaign.
Califano's campaign includes an effort to get fed
eral taxes on cigarettes increased, a proposed ban on
smoking on commercial aircraft, a call for restrictions
on smoking in all public buildings and public places
warnings about smoking on birth control pills and a
new Office on Smoking and Health to oversee the
drive.
Public sees health care crisis
Chicago (AP) — A study shows that 61 percent of
Americans think there is a "crisis in health care" in
this country — at least for other people. But only 12
percent say they are generally dissatisfied with the

health care they themselves are getting.
"Why this paradox exists is a mystery still to be
probed," said the University of Chicago researchers
in their report yesterday.
The causes of health care dissatisfaction most fre
quently cited were high costs and long amounts of
time spent in waiting rooms.
The researchers also found that although most
Americans have better access to medical care than
ever before — with particularly dramatic improve
ments among blacks and other minorities —
nevertheless, 24 million Americans still have no regu
lar access to treatment.
The researchers attributed the dramatic improve
ment in availability of health care for previously dep
rived segments of the population to government
programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid,
begun in 1966, and to other programs begun since
1963 designed to improve health care access by the
poor of all ages.
UC regents must tell finances
Sacramento (AP) — The state's political watchdog
commission voted yesterday to require University of
California regents and top administrators to disclose
their personal finances.
The provision was part of a conflict-of-interest code
for the regents approved by the Fair Political Practices
Commission.
Regents have threatened to sue the commission if it
sought to require personal financial disclosure.
The code the regents proposed to the FPPC in
cluded only limited disclosure requirements in cases
of financial holdings that were affected by decisions
the regents made.
The commission voted to reject that code and in
stead apply to the university the same standard
applied to most public officials in California: Disclo
sure of the size and nature of investments, real estate
holdings and sources of income.
The requirements do not apply to UC teachers.

HEW: cigarettes enemy No. 1
Washington (AP) — HEW Secretary Joseph Califano
launched a massive government attack yesterday on
cigarette smoking, declaring it "public health enemy
No. 1" and a killer of thousands of Americans.
Califano promised help to the nation's 54 million
smokers to quit the habit. The government will ex
pand its smoking research and urge broadcasters and
educators to spread the message that "smoking
maims, smoking kills."
Tobacco growers urged President Carter to get
Califano "back down to earth" after his announce
ment of the $24 million campaign.
Califano's campaign includes an effort to get fed
eral taxes on cigarettes increased, a proposed ban on
smoking on commercial aircraft, a call for restrictions
on smoking in all public buildings and public places
warnings about smoking on birth control pills and a
new Office on Smoking and Health to oversee the
drive.
Public sees health care crisis
Chicago (AP) — A study shows that 61 percent of
Americans think there is a "crisis in health care" in
this country — at least for other people. But only 12
percent say they are generally dissatisfied with the

health care they themselves are getting.
"Why this paradox exists is a mystery still to be
probed," said the University of Chicago researchers
in their report yesterday.
The causes of health care dissatisfaction most fre
quently cited were high costs and long amounts of
time spent in waiting rooms.
The researchers also found that although most
Americans have better access to medical care than
ever before — with particularly dramatic improve
ments among blacks and other minorities —
nevertheless, 24 million Americans still have no regu
lar access to treatment.
The researchers attributed the dramatic improve
ment in availability of health care for previously dep
rived segments of the population to government
programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid,
begun in 1966, and to other programs begun since
1963 designed to improve health care access by the
poor of all ages.
UC regents must tell finances
Sacramento (AP) — The state's political watchdog
commission voted yesterday to require University of
California regents and top administrators to disclose
their personal finances.
The provision was part of a conflict-of-interest code
for the regents approved by the Fair Political Practices
Commission.
Regents have threatened to sue the commission if it
sought to require personal financial disclosure.
The code the regents proposed to the FPPC in
cluded only limited disclosure requirements in cases
of financial holdings that were affected by decisions
the regents made.
The commission voted to reject that code and in
stead apply to the university the same standard
applied to most public officials in California: Disclo
sure of the size and nature of investments, real estate
holdings and sources of income.
The requirements do not apply to UC teachers.

Park signs cooperation pledge
Seoul, Korea (AP) — Tong-sun Park signed an ag

influence buying operation in Washington.
But Park refused to say if he will testify before
congressional committees.
The agreement, signed before acting U.S. Deputy
Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, completed ar
rangements for the justice Department's questioning
of Park, due to start Friday.
The memorandum said Park would tell the truth to
American investigators in Seoul and, if required, in
American courts, in return for immunity from crimi
nal charges.
Park has been indicted by a U.S. federal grand jury
on 36 counts of bribery, fraud and other charges.
More than 20 former and present congressmen
have acknowledged receiving money or gifts from
Park but deny any wrongdoing. Park also denies crim

FBI investigates state politics

percent say they are generally dissatisfied with the

health care they themselves are getting.
"Why this paradox exists is a mystery still to be
probed," said the University of Chicago researchers
in their report yesterday.
The causes of health care dissatisfaction most fre
quently cited were high costs and long amounts of
time spent in waiting rooms.
The researchers also found that although most
Americans have better access to medical care than
ever before — with particularly dramatic improve
ments among blacks and other minorities —
nevertheless, 24 million Americans still have no regu
lar access to treatment.
The researchers attributed the dramatic improve
ment in availability of health care for previously dep
rived segments of the population to government
programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid,
begun in 1966, and to other programs begun since
1963 designed to improve health care access by the
poor of all ages.
UC regents must tell finances
Sacramento (AP) — The state's political watchdog
commission voted yesterday to require University of
California regents and top administrators to disclose
their personal finances.
The provision was part of a conflict-of-interest code
for the regents approved by the Fair Political Practices
Commission.
Regents have threatened to sue the commission if it
sought to require personal financial disclosure.
The code the regents proposed to the FPPC in
cluded only limited disclosure requirements in cases
of financial holdings that were affected by decisions
the regents made.
The commission voted to reject that code and in
stead apply to the university the same standard
applied to most public officials in California: Disclo
sure of the size and nature of investments, real estate
holdings and sources of income.
The requirements do not apply to UC teachers.

Park signs cooperation pledge
Seoul, Korea (AP) — Tong-sun Park signed an ag
reement yesterday pledging to cooperate with Justice
Department investigations into his alleged Korean
influence buying operation in Washington.
But Park refused to say if he will testify before
congressional committees.
The agreement, signed before acting U.S. Deputy
Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, completed ar
rangements for the justice Department's questioning
of Park, due to start Friday.
The memorandum said Park would tell the truth to
American investigators in Seoul and, if required, in
American courts, in return for immunity from crimi
nal charges.
Park has been indicted by a U.S. federal grand jury
on 36 counts of bribery, fraud and other charges.
More than 20 former and present congressmen
have acknowledged receiving money or gifts from
Park but deny any wrongdoing. Park also denies crim
inal guilt.
FBI investigates state politics
Sacramento (AP) — The FBI said yesterday it is inves
tigating "possible political corruption" in California,
a probe one report said involved suspected vote
buying in the Legislature.
Top political leaders of both parties confirmed they
had been questioned by FBI agents or called before a
federal grand jury, but all said they were personally
not targets of the investigation, which numerous re
ports say centers on a Howard Hughes empire lob
byist.
Assembly Speaker Leo McCarthy of San Francisco
and minority floor leader Paul Priolo of Malibu, the
Democratic and Republican leaders of the Assembly,
both confirmed they had been contacted by FBI
agents. Former Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti tes
tified before a grand jury.
The FBI Sacramento office released a statement
confirming an investigation was underway but refus
ing to discuss details.
But Assemblyman Louis Papan, a former FBI agent,
said the probe involved dealings of some lobbyists
and legislators, dealings the San Francisco Examiner
said included suspected vote-buying.
Three-year low in jobless rate
Washington (AP) — President limmy Carter hailed

as "good news for the country" the Labor Depart
ment's report yesterday that the December jobless
rate fell to 6.4 percent, its lowest level in more than
three years.
The half a percentage point decline from
November's 6.9 percent level broke an eight-month
pattern that has seen the unemployment rate bounce
between 6.9 percent and 7.1 percent.
Unemployment stood at 7.3 percent when Carter
took office last lanuary and the administration set a
goal of reducing joblessness to 6.6 percent by year
end.
"The statistics look good," the President said at a
hastily called White House meeting with reporters
and Charles Schultze, his chief economic adviser.
Carter spoke hopefully of further improvements this
year with the aid of his proposed tax cut.
The Labor Department said a record 58 percent of
the population was working last month. Over the
year, employment increased by 4.1 million to a total
of 92.6 million — the biggest 12-month increase since
World War 11.
HEW: cigarettes enemy No. 1
Washington (AP) — HEW Secretary Joseph Califano
launched a massive government attack yesterday on
cigarette smoking, declaring it "public health enemy
No. 1" and a killer of thousands of Americans.
Califano promised help to the nation's 54 million
smokers to quit the habit. The government will ex
pand its smoking research and urge broadcasters and
educators to spread the message that "smoking
maims, smoking kills."
Tobacco growers urged President Carter to get
Califano "back down to earth" after his announce
ment of the $24 million campaign.
Califano's campaign includes an effort to get fed
eral taxes on cigarettes increased, a proposed ban on
smoking on commercial aircraft, a call for restrictions
on smoking in all public buildings and public places
warnings about smoking on birth control pills and a
new Office on Smoking and Health to oversee the
drive.
