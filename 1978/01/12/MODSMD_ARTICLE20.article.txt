The Victim as Criminal and Artist

Our cultural memory is unceasingly renewed
retroactively by new discoveries, returns to the
sources, reforms and renaissances that are much
more than revivals of the past and constitute be
hind us what one might call a "neo-past." . . . Thus,
by retroaction from the successive "nows," our
past never stops changing its meaning; the present
appropriation of the past modifies that which
motivates us from the depths of the past.
-from the Symbolism of Evil, by Paul Ricoeur
Some writers have the knack of — if not being
right on target — being able to skew the reader
around 180 degrees and make him stop and
think, make him realize that there is at least one
otherwayof lookingat something. Disregarding
politics and personalities and bringing it right
down to academics, Stanford's ex-enfant terri
ble H. Bruce Franklin has consistently shown his
ability to be a gadfly of the literary establish
ment. Somewhat ironically, the resolution of
Franklin's Santa Clara County court case coin
cides with the publication of his new book, The

Books

Victim as Criminal and Artist - Literature from the
American Prison. (As for this title, it could as
easily read The Criminal as Victim and Artist or
The Artist as Criminal and Victim — and still sell
short the quality of thinking and scholarship
which has gone into the book.)
Normally, I suppose, books of "literary criti
cism" are not the province of Thursday reviews,
but the paths of the University and Franklin, for
some time in parallel, have since presented an
interesting contrast — mostly because Franklin
has not limited himself to churning out "literary
criticism."
As to what the book is about: Incarceration,
consciousness and literature, from Melville to
slave narratives, to slave songs, to lack London,
to studies of Malcolm Braly and Chester
to Malcolm X, Attica and beyond. A rather mixed
bag which Franklin manages to clearly and read
ably draw into cohesion. In the process he
makes some very interesting observations about
academics and art.
An issue central to the book's purpose is
raised (inadvertently?) on the back of the dust
jacket by Vale's F.R. Jameson: "It is not so fre
quent to find a whole virtually unstudied body
of narratives presented to us for study, as
Franklin does here with the slave and prison
narratives. Clearly, this material is new and fas
cinating in its own right, and Franklin's book
would be important if it were nothing more than
a 'rediscovery' of these neglected texts. But it is

a good deal more than that, and is full of
stimulating critical analyses which have as many
implications for 'high literature' as for these
more popular cultural artifacts."
One wonders whether Jameson's delight in
discovery is feigned or whether this actually is
his first encounter with the "fascinating new
material." Putting aside for the moment the
issue of academian naivete which lameson's
quote raises, it is important to note what is
genuinely new in the work, Franklin's analysis of
Melville's writing. For anyone who has ever had
to read Moby Dick more than once or has waded
through such epics of Melville-criticism as
American Renaissance, The Fine Hammered
Steel of.. .and Franklin's own In the Wake of
the Cods, this book is a must. While not denying
the whale (or Bartelby or whatever) as a totally
abstract metaphor, Franklin does point out that
Melville was no Sunday fisherman writing in idle
moments, but a writer who went broke and
broken-hearted trying to make some very co
gent comments about some very hard, cold
American realities.
The next closest thing to "something new
under the sun" is the gathering together under
one cover by a fairly respected and certainly
influential critic, who is also white, material and
analysis which has been around for a long time,
albeit somewhat buried or dispersed through
other fields (as the book jacket says, "for anyone
interested in American literature, Afro-
American culture, Marxist theory, penology and
the relation between crime and art . . .") or —
less a matter of accessibility than of vision — or
just not seen.
Franklin himself is keenly aware of this blind
ness. In the 10 pages of brief introduction, he
takes a deadly look at American literature — at
the "Nashville fugitives" (|ohn Crowe Ransom,
Robert Penn Warren, Alan Tate and David
Davidson), holdovers from an Old South which
never existed and which they reconstituted in
the halls of academia, and at the severe case of
tunnel vision they propagated from which
American letters is still suffering. If you have
read W.E.B. Dußois, Frederick Douglas, Sterling
Brown, Arna Bontemps, Charles Nichols (who
was at Stanford in '73), Ellison, Robert Hayden,
Michael Harper, Ishmael Reed . . . the list goes
on and one. . . perhaps you might find the book
redundant. If you have not, the book definitely
bears reading.
The year is now 1978, though. A goodly
amount of time has passed since the era of the
'60s-early '70s. Stanford's brash boy has written
a decently scholarly and thoughtful book. A
Humanities Fellowship from the Rockerfeller
Foundation helped fund the writing. Oxford
University Press published it. Times change. The
merit in a book such as this one lies less in the
fact that it was written at all than whether it is
read> —KIT MORGAN
