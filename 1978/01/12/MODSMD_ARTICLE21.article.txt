The Autumn 1977 issue of Sequoia offers an admirable blend of
poetry, fiction and criticism.
An awareness of literary tradition informs its contents; the
most obvious example is Richard Spilman's "Ars Cucharacha," a
witty parody of Archibald MacLeish's "Ars Poetica" which ends,
a cockroach should not mean but be
The poet Richard Howard has said that poetry should recover
some of the ground lost to fiction and drama. When Spilman
suggests that poetry can be about cockroaches as much as the
rejection of love, he shows how a poem's subject matter deter
mines its possibilities. Shelley Shaver's colloquial narratives such
as "Birthday: Conversation in an Idle Office," and Dana Gioia's
description of his poem "The Mad Nun" as a short story, also
assist in this recovery.
Literature expands its possibilities not only through its subject
matter and experimental techniques, but also in its reaction to
past achievements. For some writers, masterpieces become
monuments which obstruct a new voice. Others, responding to
the past, create original works. Michael Stillman takes the song
which concludes Shakespeare's "Love's Labor's Lost," written as
a counterpoint between spring and winter, and adds his own
versions for summer and autumn. He calls the resulting cycle "a
distant collaboration" and it is, both historically and creatively.
Stillman inverts the two parts of Shakespeare's song, incidentally
making it into two songs, in order to create a poetic cycle that
corresponds to a natural cycle.
This issue is dedicated to William Everson, a poet who wrote as
Brother Antoninus for 19 years. Twenty-two pages are devoted to
a critical interpretation of Everson as a religious poet, an inter
view with the poet and one of Everson's own poems. In the
interview, Everson discusses "The Poet as Prophet" with erudi
tion that is often taxing until he begins to describe the actual
process of the poet's spiritual apprenticeship.
The editors also would have done well to provide biographical
data for Gabriele Wohmann, as well as a note about the trans
lators of her short story, "The Answer." I know of no collection of
her short stories in English which makes this translation by Sylvia
Keady and Marikka Rype especially valuable. Wohmann is consi
dered to be a master of the German short story and"The Answer"
appears to be typical of her ironic depiction of commonplace
situations.
The issue is rounded out by a book review of Kenneth Fields'
"Smoke," lyrics which range widely in style and tone, and photo
graphs by Susan Katz. Sequoia is available at the Stanford
bookstore.

a cockroach should not mean but be
The poet Richard Howard has said that poetry should recover
some of the ground lost to fiction and drama. When Spilman
suggests that poetry can be about cockroaches as much as the
rejection of love, he shows how a poem's subject matter deter
mines its possibilities. Shelley Shaver's colloquial narratives such
as "Birthday: Conversation in an Idle Office," and Dana Gioia's
description of his poem "The Mad Nun" as a short story, also
assist in this recovery.
Literature expands its possibilities not only through its subject
matter and experimental techniques, but also in its reaction to
past achievements. For some writers, masterpieces become
monuments which obstruct a new voice. Others, responding to
the past, create original works. Michael Stillman takes the song
which concludes Shakespeare's "Love's Labor's Lost," written as
a counterpoint between spring and winter, and adds his own
versions for summer and autumn. He calls the resulting cycle "a
distant collaboration" and it is, both historically and creatively.
Stillman inverts the two parts of Shakespeare's song, incidentally
making it into two songs, in order to create a poetic cycle that
corresponds to a natural cycle.
This issue is dedicated to William Everson, a poet who wrote as
Brother Antoninus for 19 years. Twenty-two pages are devoted to
a critical interpretation of Everson as a religious poet, an inter
view with the poet and one of Everson's own poems. In the
interview, Everson discusses "The Poet as Prophet" with erudi
tion that is often taxing until he begins to describe the actual
process of the poet's spiritual apprenticeship.
The editors also would have done well to provide biographical
data for Gabriele Wohmann, as well as a note about the trans
lators of her short story, "The Answer." I know of no collection of
her short stories in English which makes this translation by Sylvia
Keady and Marikka Rype especially valuable. Wohmann is consi
dered to be a master of the German short story and"The Answer"
appears to be typical of her ironic depiction of commonplace
situations.
The issue is rounded out by a book review of Kenneth Fields'
"Smoke," lyrics which range widely in style and tone, and photo
graphs by Susan Katz. Sequoia is available at the Stanford
bookstore.
