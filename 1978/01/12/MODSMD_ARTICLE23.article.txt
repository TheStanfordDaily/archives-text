"Princess Ida, or Castle Adamant," in Din
kelspiel on |an. 14 from 1-5 p.m., and (an. 15
from 7-10 p.m.
One of the lesser known works of the Gilbert
and Sullivan repertory, "Princess Ida" was writ
ten at a time when women were just beginning
to gain admittance to English universities. Ten
nyson had written "The Princess," describing an
idyllic, self-sufficient women's university of
"sweet girl-graduates in their golden hair." Gil
bert, who held the traditional Victorian view that
women should be cherished and protected, but
in no way considered the equals of men, re
sponded with what he termed "a respectful per
version" of Tennyson's poem. "Princess Ida"
was originally performed (not very successfully)
to the music of several operatic composers of
the day.
The story concerns Princess Ida, who refuses

to honor her betrothal-in-infancy to Prince
Hilarion, and, instead, renounces men and sets
up a women's university in Castle Adamant.
Hilarion and two triends infiltrate the university
dressed as women, posing as new students.
Soon, as one might expect, all hell breaks loose.
The men are discovered and put in chains; the
castle is stormed by the army of Hilarion's
father, King Hildebrand; Ida's father, King
Gama, and her three slow-witted warrior
brothers come to her defense; the outcome is
finally decided by a duel between the three
young suitors and the three brothers.
Auditions are open to everyone, and no ex
perience is necessary, According to producer
Rita Taylor.
The cast requires 15 principals and large men's
and women's choruses. Production jobs require
about 25 people, and the orchestra about 40.
