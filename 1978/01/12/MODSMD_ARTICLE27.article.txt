# Humanities sequence hit
## 
### Richard Bowditch 
The Committee on Under
graduate Studies (CUS) voted
unanimously yesterday to
submit for Faculty Senate con
sideration a proposal which
would eliminate the restriction
that courses fulfilling the
humanities distribution re
quirement be part of a desig
nated sequence, according to
CUS chairman, Political Sci
ence Prof. )an Triska.
The proposal would be re
troactive and would apply to all
students who entered Stanford
in or after the academic year
1976-77.
The sequence requirement,
applying only to those students
who have enrolled since au
tumn quarter 1976, stipulates
that students must take three
courses of at least three units
each in an approved series.
The student can choose from
one of hundreds of designated
sequences or can make up his
own.
'In adminstrable'
Committee member Brad
krevoy said, "The major reason
for not continuing that policy
was it was unadministrahle,
confusing and causing a lot of
students anguish."
Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Herant katchadourian
said the possibility of creating
individual sequences, together
with the variety of designated
ones, negate the original intent
of the sequence concept,
which was to offer students a
coherent program in the
humanities.
If the Faculty Senate, "to en
courage coherence," passes
the proposal, departments will
be asked to list "illustrative
sequences" in Courses and
Degrees.
But Chairman Triska em
phasized that the measure
would be a temporary one;
consideration of the proposed
western civilization require
ment will necessitate a re
examination of the entire
humanities distribution re
quirement.

In the December committee
meeting the problems with the
sequence were highlighted
when Asst. Linguistics Prof.
Thomas Wasow asked that the
restriction be eliminated.
katchadourian said the
committee had two choices: it
could limit the number of ap
proved sequences or it could
veto the restriction. Pat Flinn, a
student committee member,
said that no one wished tolimit
further students' choices.
Flinn said he considers the
proposal an "enlightened"
measure and "more than just a

minor alteration of the re
quirement." He said it is an
acknowledgement that the Fa
culty Senate had made a mis
take, and said hewas surprised
the committee had admitted it
so frankly.
Flinn added that the lesson
may be that a bureaucratic
measure is not always the best
method of inducing students
to study what the faculty wants
them to study.
But he cautioned that he did
not know what the Faculty Se
nate is going to do with the
program.
