Cairo (AP) â€” The defense
ministers of Egypt and Israel
took their "battle for peace" to
a Cairo conference table yes
terday to seek agreement on
Israeli withdrawal from the
Sinai Peninsula and to deter
mine the fate of )ewish settle
ments that have blossomed in
that wasteland.
The meeting was seen by
Egypt as a key barometer in ad
vance of parallel but wider
ranging talks between Israeli
and Egyptian foreign ministers
set to open lan. 16 in
Jerusalem.
An Israeli source said (he
Cairo talks began on an awk
ward note with Egypt demand
ing that an opening statement
prepared by Israeli defense
chief Ezer Weizman be with
drawn, apparently because it
conflicted with Egyption op
position to lewish settlements
in Sinai.
The source, who asked not
to be identified, gave reporters
copies of the text. In it, Weiz
man said Israel and Egypt will
"examine arrangements for
continued maintenance of the
Israeli settlements."
There was no immediate
Egyptian comment on the flap.
Negotiations between
Weizman and Egyptian War
Minister Mohammed Abdel
Ghany Gamassy will focus on
the future of a score of Israeli
Sinai settlements in a peace
settlement.
The controversial issue be
came the target of a war of
words, with Sadat vowing that
no Israeli, soldier or civilian,
will remain in a Sinai returned
to Egyptian control. Israel's
Prime Minister Menahem Be
gin, speaking with equal pas
sion, declared: "The Israelis
do not burn settlements. They

build them and keep them."
Before leaving Tel Aviv,
Weizman defined the settle
ment controversy as "a critical
one" and said Israel's overall
aim was "to achieve security
measures."
Egyptian officials say they
will be watching Israel's re
sponse as a test of the Begin
government's willingness to
reply to Sadat's solo peace in
itiative.
