# KZSU to boost power
## 
### 
The Federal Communica
tions Commission voted
unanimously yesterday to
grant construction permits for
higher power to KZSU-FM and
Foothill College station KFJC
FM.
KZSU station manager )on
Morris said F.C.C. staff
member Barry Wood told him
that the commission approved
the "waivers of interference"
that have delayed the final pro
cessing of the applications for
some 2Vi years.
KZSU's chief engineer Ron
Kwang said the station will be
broadcasting with 500 watts of
power in about a month.
KZSU's signal will be 10 de
cibels stronger now and
should reach from South San
Francisco to San lose. In addi
tion, the signal will be both
horizontally and vertically
polarized â€” meaning that re
ception in automobiles will be
greatly improved.
