# Biden speaks on CIA
## 
### Rob Lempert 
Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.),
speaking in kresge Au
ditorium last night, said his
review of CIA files has re
vealed a "serious" conflict
between national security
and our system of civil jus
tice.
Biden, a member of the
Intelligence committee,
said there are many cases of
Americans caught giving
classified items to foreign
governments that cannot be
brought to trial because in
doing so further secrets
would be disclosed in open
court.
Biden cited the example
of an Army sergeant sus
pected of selling docu
ments to a foreign govern
ment. An American agent in
that country's intelligence
service found the evidence,
but the sergeant could not
be tried without revealing
the agent's identity and pos
ition. Instead the sergeant
was promoted and dis
charged.
Biden said his major con
cern is not with the security
dangers these cases pose,
but with the constitutional
dangers caused by attempts
to stop them.

He said he fears his com
mittee might cause some
repressive legislation which
might cause a dec line in civil
liberties.
The senator said he is
proposing legislation to
deal with this problem, but
that it is morea basis for dis
cussion than a final plan. He
said that if rio solution can
be found he would sacrifice
national security to pre
serve civil liberty.
Biden said he faced a di
lemma when he first came
to the Senate in 1972 and
began to deal with agencies
such as the CIA. When he
was in school during the
'60s he said he felt there was
no place for secrecy in a
democracy, but when he
came to Washington he said
he found "covert activities
can be a useful tool in keep
ing the peace."
The senator said there are
now many new laws de
signed to control abuses by
intelligence agencies.
Biden is one of 15
senators on a committee
privy to all information con
cerning U.S. intelligence
operations, but he acknow
ledges he may be lied to by
the agencies.
