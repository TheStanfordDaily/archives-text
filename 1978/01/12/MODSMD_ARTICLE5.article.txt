# Common Ground : more than a garden
## 
### 
The headquarters of the Syn
tex Corporation is located
on a hillside just west of Footh
ill Expressway, across from
Palo Alto's Veterans Administ
ration Hospital. A large cement
and glass building in the mod
ern architectural style, it sits on
a very green and well-groomed
lawn. At the foot of the hill,
however, literally a stone's
throw away from the
chemical-pharmaceuticals bas
tion, an incongruous sight pre
sents itself: a truck garden, in
the best tradition of truck gar
dens. It is a disorderly collage
of colors and textures — the
lush green of crops and weeds,
the crumbling dark brown of
newly turned earth, the dry
light brown of withered vege
tation, the dusty white sheen
of sheet plastic, the hard lustre
less gray of metal siding.

A casual passerby, observing
the two establishments, would
be likely to see in their proxim
ity the tension which often
exists between the new and
dynamic and the old and static.
Palo Aito, he might surmise, is
in the final stages of a
metamorphosis from the pas
toral to the cosmopolitan; the
garden, a quaint anachronism,
will soon be the site of yet
another corporate headquar
ters and the cement and glass
building on the hillside will ac
quire, by comparison, an air of
establishment and seniority.

Such is not the case, how
ever. Quite to the contrary, the
cement and glass building
antedates the garden; the land
on which the garden is located
is owned by the corporation
and worked by the garden's
proprietors under the terms of
a rent-free lease; the operation
of the garden is partially sub
sidized, with virtually no return
obligations, by the corpora
tion's donation, in addition to
the land, of water and funds. It
is an unusual situation, but it is
an unusual truck garden.
Foods ranging from grains to
fruit to beans to vegetables are
under cultivation there. The
yield of any given foodstuff at
any given harvest time typically
ranges from two to 31 times the
national, California or Santa
Clara County average
(whichever is higher). From
one-half to one-sixteenth the
average amount of water per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. From one-half to
one-sixteenth the average
amount of nitrogen fertilizer
per pound of food produced is
typically used. About one
one-hundredth the energy per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. No "chemical" fer
tilizer is used. Mo pesticides of
any type are used. No machin
ery more sophisticated than a
simple wheelbarrow is used.
And it is not uncommon to see
men and women in business
dress entering or leaving the
garden or engaged in some
phase of agriculture.
Despite these arresting facts,
the garden and its proprietors
remain surprisingly anonym
ous. Perhaps it is the
previously-described undis
tinguished character of the
former, or maybe it is the
quiet, unassuming style of the
latter. It may even be that it has
less to do with either the
former or latter than the nature
of the rest of the world. What
ever the case, it would be a
poor bet indeed to wager that
that anonymity is to be pre
served for very much longer.
Although I have been in
terested in food in general
and gardening in specific for
much of my life, the terms
"biodynamic" and "French in
tensive" remained obscure to
me until I made the acquain
tance of John leavons. An
alumnus of Yale and former
head of Business Services for
the Stanford library system,
leavons currently wields the

ponderous title of Director of
Agricultural Research for Ecol
ogy Action of the Midpenin
sula.
It is largely Jeavons who is
responsible for the present
shape — in both a physLal and
an abstract sense — of the ag
ricultural program underway
on the three and three-quarter
acre plot of Syntex land. It was
Jeavons who, after making a
study on his own initiative of
United Nations iand use and

population
figures, be
came con
vinced that
the planet
was still
capable of
feeding all
her in
habitants;
it was he
who, after
attending a
seminar on
the agricul
tural
techniques

synthesized by the Englishman
Alan Chadwick, sought out the
master horticulturalist in his
barren hillside-turned Garden
of Eden at the University of
California at Santa Cruz; it was
Jeavons who, after talking at
length with Chadwick, prop
osed the idea of a combined
research and community gar
den to the board of directors of
Ecology Action, a Palo Alto
conservation group which had
won recognition for a success
ful city-wide recycling prog-

ram; it was he who, after con
vincing them of the viability
and significance of such a
program, proceeded to as
semble the elements of Com
mon Ground — land, funds,
people — and embark on a
course of rigorous scientific
research.
The program is now in its
sixth year. Each succeeding
year has, according to Jeavons,
confirmed his faith in Chad
wick's techniques, known now
as the biodynamic-French in
tensive method.
When I first spoke with
leavons, I had a vague recollec
tion of a chapter in a gardening
book which had described a
"labor-intensive" system of
farming which allowed the
densely-populated countries
of western Europe to grow
much food on little land. This, I
imagined, was related to
"French-intensive" farming. In
his articulate and methodical
way, Jeavons soon clarified and
expanded this conception —
and made me realize how large
a topic this form of agriculture
had become.
"The method we're using
now," he said, "is made up of
two techniques that were de
veloped in Europe around the
turn of the century. The French
intensive method is one—that
reached its culmination in the
1890s outside Paris. What it did
was it raised vegetables in beds
that consisted of 18 inches of
horse manure — which was re
ally plentiful at the time. Be
cause of this high level of or
ganic matter and the fertility it
created, as well as the great
depth of loose material, roots
were able to grow downward
instead of needing room to
grow out horizontally. So they
were able to use very close
spacing."
This simple concept, leavons
continued, accounts for a sig
nificant part of the increased
yields which the method pro
duces. As jeavons phrased it in
a research report summarizing
Common Ground's first four
years, "A simple 24-inch deep
soil preparation allows the

plants to be spaced more
closely so that their leaves
touch or almost touch. . . .
This factor alone would make
fourfold yields possible be
cause four times as many
plants as usual can be planted
in a given area."
"The other technique,"
Jeavons told me, "was the
biodynamic technique. It was
developed in the 1920s by
Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian
genius who was into educa
tion, philosophy, religion, and
agriculture. The French inten
sive method had been de
veloped over hundreds of
years by French marchiers or
gardeners. The biodynamic
method, though, was de
veloped by Steiner in the late
'20s fora lot of wealthy German
farmers who had noticed that
their yields were going down
and they were getting more in
sect and disease problems. It
turned out they had been using
chemical fertilizers. Urea, a
kind of artifical nitrogen, had
been developed in the late
1880s. Steiner traced their
problems to the chemical fer
tilizers and suggested that they
return to some of their old
methods and adopt five special
practices. These practices be
camethe biodynamic method.
"One was the use of raised
beds — beds only 12 inches
deep prepared by raking soil
out of the path. This was going
back to the Greeks who found
out that plants grew better in
landslides. The raised beds as
they came to be dug were like
little, artificial landslides. The
reasons the plants do better in
them is because the soil is
looser and there's more air or
gases in it — you need up to 50
percent gases for good plant
growth."
jeavons frequently uses the
verb "dovetail" to describe
areas where two concepts in
termesh or compliment each
other. The deep soil prepara
tion and close spacing of the
French intensive method
dovetails, he said, with the "ar
tificial landslides" of the
biodynamic method to pro

duce healthier, more produc
tive plants.
"There was a study in the '50s
at the University of California
at Berkeley," he said, "that
showed that if you improved
root health by two to four per
cent for most common field
crops you could increase the
yields by 200 to 400 percent.
One of the things which can
make this possible is better soil
preparation and aeration. With
our method, you have more air
in the soil, more surface area
for contact between soil and air
since a raised bed has a curved
surface and also more surface
area to absorb rain or watering
and warmth from the sun. And
the curved surface also allows
you to increase the planting
area by 20 percent. Say you
have a plot of land that's a
hundred square feet and you
make it a raised bed, you can
wind up with 120 square feet of
planting area.
"The second technique that
Steiner recommended, after
the raised beds — which inci
dentally may even have gone
back even before the Greeks to
the Chinese, possibly 4000
years ago — was the use of or
ganic fertilizers. Chemical fer
tilizers at the time were mainly
just nitrogen or nitrogen and
phosphorous. They weren't
balanced or complete; they
needed trace minerals and
potash. Also the chemical fer
tilizers broke down very
quickly and harmed the texture
and structure of the soil and
killed the microbiotic life and

so forth. So Steiner asked the
German farmers to return to
organic fertilizers that were
more balanced and diverse —
like fish meal which has nitro
gen, phosphorous and trace
mi nerals and breaks down over
a period of six months instead
of four to six weeks.
"The third technique was
companion planting. There
were a lot of folk myths about
what things to grow well to
gether. Steiner tried to scienti
fically investigate this through
such techniques as
chromatography and crystalli
zation and field testing to de
termine which plants grown
together would do better. For
instance, one part chamomile
grown with two hundred parts
of wheat increases the health
and yield of wheat. But if its
one to one, one part
chamomile grown with one
part wheat, the wheat will be
destroyed, or at least seriously
harmed.
"Another technique was the
use of herbal sprays. At one
point they were almost a cult.
You take stinging nettles, for
example, and you do some
thing like — I can't remember
exactly — bury it three feet
under the ground at a certain
conjunction of the plants and
leave it under there for six
months and dig it up and mix it
in with a water solution and
then spray it on the ground. It's
supposed to stimulate the
micorobiotic life of the soil
which helps the plants. Really
far out, really unusual, but it
works.
"And the fifth thing was
planting by the phases of the
moon. The rationale for this
comes from seeing the moon's
effect on oceans — daily tides
of up to 40 feet in some parts of
the world. There's water in the
ground, in seeds and in plants
so it seems there might be a
small effect there.
"So those were the two
threads — the French intensive
method and Steiner's five
biodynamic techniques.
"Now, Chadwick, who is, I
think, a horticultural genius,

certainly a horticultural artist,
put these two techniques to
gether sometime between the
1930s and the 1960s when he
came to Santa Cruz. He had
been severely exasperated by
the second world war. A
woman named Freiavon Molka
and he got together and de
cided that one of the best ways
to bring peace and life and
harmony back into the world
was through gardens. Chad
wick had studied under the
French marchiers and he had
studied under Steiner. He's
had over 50 years of experience
in raising food. He also worked
under George Bernard Shaw in
drama, he's a painter, an actor,
an incredible individual — very
dramatic in his presentation of
things.
"When he put the two farm
ing techniques together, he
simplified them. Where
Steiner would make herbal
preparations, Chadwick would
just grow the herb, the stinging
nettle say, in the bed and then
put it in the compost pile and
let it have a living kind of influ
ence. Instead of using dead
mulches he used living mulch
— when the plants are so close
together that their leaves just
about touch, the ground is
shaded, moisture is con
served, a micro-climate is
created. So his whole orienta
tion is using living plants and
giving to nature as much as she
produces and even a little
more. If you give to nature
more than she gives you, she
will continually provide you
with abundance.
"So Chadwick prepares his
beds 24 inches deep, not just
18, he uses compost mainly
from vegetable matter, he uses
very little manure — in contrast
with the French and in contrast
with the other biodynamic
people who sometimes use a
lot of manure. This is important
worldwide because one-third
of the world's people now have
a different kind of energy
crisis: they don't have enough
firewood. So like in India,
they're burning the manure
from animals to heat their
homes and to cook their food.
There's a fertilizer shortage
there. But you don't need the
manure under Chadwick's
technique; most of it is veget
able compost, as I said.
"So he uses 24-inch-deep
soil preparation; close spac
ing; comparatively speaking, a
vegetarian or quasi-vegetarian
compost that's two-thirds veg
etable matter, one-third soil;
he uses living herbs rather than
herbal sprays, generally; he
uses some organic fertilizers,
mainly bone meal but not
much else; and he plants by
the phases of the moon."
/ / K| ow we started re-
searching the method
in 1972. Our purposes were
twofold. One was to document
how the method was done — it
had never been documented
in written form because Chad
wick doesn't believe in the
written word but by handing
things down by example and
by word of mouth, master to
apprentice and so forth. Also it
had been reputed that the
method produced four times
the average yield, but this had
never been documented one
way or another.
"The lot Syntex gave us had a
soil which was one-third rock
— meaning pebbles and stuff.
Normal agricultural soil is
maybe five percent rock, not 33
percent. In addition, our soil
was over one-third clay. There
was no nitrogen fertilizer in the
soil and just a trace of phos
phorous and potash.
"During our first five years
we got very encouraging re
sults — yields which ranged
anywhere from two to 16 times
the U.S., Santa Clara County or
California averages. Then in
1976, I developed a new

technique called 'superdig
ging' which is a sort of a super
texturizing technique. This
technique improves the soil
more rapidly. It takes up to five
years using normal techniques
to improve the soil. Re
member, we were in subsoil
clay with no top soil at all. As a
result of this new technique,
this year we've gone as high as
about 60 times the Santa Clara
County average with zucchini
using about two percent of the
water per pound of food pro
duced and one percent of the
added nitrogen fertilizer per
pound of food produced. In
the case of grain, we're as high
as two and a quarter times the
national average on soybeans,

double on
wheat and
expect to
go six to
eight times
for those
yields.
Also, we
expect to
be using
one third to
one-eighth
the water
per pound
of grain
produced
— and that
could be
significant
because it
means you

could be getting very high
grain yields with as little as
eight or 10 inches of rainfall.
Over 75 percent of the arable
area of the world has 10 or
more inches of rainfall.
"An interesting thing is that
the Zulus of South Africa use a
similar technique — similar to
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method, that is, that they
developed on their own. It's a
triple-digging technique, lust
before it rains they prepare the
soil three feet deep and as
soon as it does rain they plant
their grain. It doesn't rain all
summer and is very dry. They
grow grain when no one else
can grow grain anywhere. So
here's a similar technique
that's working under natural
rainfall conditions.
"What this means is that if
we reach all of our projections,
we would be getting an aver
age of four to eight times on
vegetables and six to eight
times the average yield on
grain. And these yields, by the
way are already being obtained
somewhere else in the world
on the average — and on a
large scale basis. A way to high
light this is to say that for every
major crop grown in the Un
ited States, some other country
in the world on the average is
getting a yield about twice as
high. So U.S. agriculture,
though it may look good, is not
the best with all crops."
One morning soon after our
first conversation, I met
Jeavons for a tour of the Com
mon Ground garden. He is
plainly in his element there. A
fairly large man in his mid-30s
he sports an incipient pot belly
and a voluminous though
well-behaved beard. He was
dressed in mud-spattered
work pants, a heavy flannel
shirt and a sweat-stained
leather cap. He generally main
tains a serious demeanor al
though when he smiles he re
veals a considerable capacity
for simple delight. His eyes
especially, manifest his posi
tive attitude: whether engaged
in a visual analysis of crop
progress, gazing at clouds in
the distance or glancing at his
auditor, they are intelligent,
energetic, unusually alive.
He took me first to some
thing he called an "herbal
lawn." From a distance, this
looked similar to a grass lawn
— green and flat. Standing next
to it, however, I saw that its

color was not uniform. In
terspersed among the light
green of sweet clover were
plants of darker shades —
identified by Jeavons as Roman
chamomile, creeping thyme
and dwarf yarrow. In addition
to being "simple and beauti
ful," Jeavons said, the lawn
fixes nitrogen in the soil and
concentrates phosphorous
and potash in its leaves. It is
thus beneficial to the soil on
which it is grown and can be
mown as a source of
nutriment-rich compost.
For the next hour we looked
at such things as newly-planted
fruit trees, fragrant and useful
herbs, fallow planting beds,
freshly-prepared planting

beds, planting beds overflow
ing with mature vegetables and
legumes, and recently har
vested planting beds. All the
while Jeavons kept up an in
teresting commentary filled
with odd facts and anecdotes.
"You see those nicely dug beds
over there?" he asked at one
point. "Those were prepared
by a 65-year-old woman with a
heart condition."
Finally, he led me to a
fenced-off area with a pad
locked gate. "This is the re
search garden," he said.
"What we've been looking at is
the community garden. People
from all over, including about
five to 10 percent of all the Syn
tex employees, are involved
with raising food here."
Inside the research garden
were rows of beds each about
six feet wide and 20 feet long. I
was slightly disappointed by
the modest dimensions of the
whole garden — smaller than
that occupied by the average
house — since it seemed that
something larger would be re
quired for such significant re
search.
"This area is about 2500
square feet," Jeavons said as if
reading my thoughts. "Our re
search indicates that a com
pletely balanced diet could be
grown on this much space —
and with as little as a half hour
of work a day. The same
amount of food, if it were
grown by U.S. chemical,
mechanized techniques would
take 10,000 square feet. In In
dia, the same diet would take
32,000 square feet.
"Now, the average American
eats 322 pounds of vegetables
and soft fruits — fruits like
strawberries, cantalopes and
watermelon — a year. Two
hundred and twenty of those
pounds are potatoes. You can
grow that amount of vegeta
bles with the biodynamic-
French intensive method in 100
square feet in a four to six
month growing season. In the
case of fruit trees, you can put
two of them in a hundred
square foot bed on eight foot
centers. Each of those fruit
trees should produce a
hundred pounds of hard fruit
per year and the average
American eats 162 pounds of
hard fruit a year. It should take
you maybe a half a minute to a
minute a day to take care of the
trees on an average basis and it
should take you about five to
10 minutes a day to take care of

the vegetable bed.
"So what we're talking about
is eventually people can start
raising a fair amount of their
food just in their back yard. A
family of four, in 400 square
feet, could raise in a four to six
month growing season food
worth $480 in five to 10 minutes
a day each. Their labor would
then be worth $4 to $8 an hour.
Now a person is probably not
going to do this the first year if
he's never gardened before,
but he's going to do a lot better
than he's done with other
techniques. What this means
for overseas, for India, for
example, where they have fer
tilizer shortages, energy shor
tages, water shortages and
food shortages, is that in a
small area, say 2500 to 7000
square feet they could raise
their total diet rather than in
32,000 square feet. So small is
beautiful: in this country, de
escalation of technology; for
overseas, a move to more self
sufficiency."
We moved to a bed with
some dried leaves and with
ered stalks in it which I recog
nized as potatoes, leavons
went on.
"Now in monetary terms,
with potatoes, we're now at
four times the national average
but we expect to go much
higher— maybe well above 20.
We're still experimenting with
that. I can't tell you on the re
cord how high we expect to go
but I can say on the record it's
over 20. With zucchini, when
we got only 16 times the Santa
Clara county average, the bed
produced $12.50 an hour — or
would have if we'd sold it all at
the wholesale rate. Now that
we're up to 60, we're talking
about producing three times
that or $37.50 an hour. This is
an extreme case but it should
be possible to earn a minimum
of $4 an hour just raising your
own vegetables.
"We're guessing that a new
kind of job or profession will
come out of all of this — mini
farming. We estimate that it
will be possible for one person
working a 40-hour week to
raise $15,000 net on as little as a
quarter of an acre. Currently
small farmers with farms of 200
to4oo acres are lucky if they net
several thousand dollars.
"So our philosophy is one of
low techonology, that is, simple
technology but sophisticated
theory. And I should say that
we're not a 'labor-intensive'
method as many people have
said we are. It's actually 'skill
intensive.' Bed preparation
may be the hardest job of the
method but once the soil is in
good shape and using a new
device that they've developed
in Canada, it should be possi
ble to prepare a bed in five to
10 minutes.
"All the resources that we
need to raise food right are av
ailable— we're just using them
in the wrong way. Take wheat
production, for example.
Normally to produce more
grain you have to use a lot
more fertilizer. For instance
with corn, from 1940 to 1960,
the nitrogen fertilizer use in
creased 10-fold, but the yields
only doubled. So your fertilizer
effectiveness was only one
fifth as good in 1960 as it was in
1940. Well, we cut our nitrogen
fertilizer use in one year to
one-half and the yield dou
bled. At the same time the pro
tein content increased. It went
from 14.8 percent to 15.7.
Normally when your yields go
up, your protein content per
pound of food goes down. Plus
we used less water and less
energy, less phosphorous and
less potash.
"Eventually, if we get all the
projections that we expect to
get, we'll be producing as
much food per hour as people
with machines can produce. So
this makes the individual im

portant again and gives the in
dividual a choice.
"I should stress that we've
got a ways to go yet. We don't
have a perfect system. We have
failures; we haven't reached all
our projections, but we've had
a lot of good results too.
"Right now, we think if the
method has an Achilles heel, it
will be in the net flow of or
ganic matter in and out of the
soil. We may have to face the
possibility that with the yields
we're now getting, we'll
exhaust the soil in a few more
years. The most important
thing about an agricultural
method is whether it is sustain
able in an environmentally ba
lanced way. The Chinese have
been able for hundreds of
years to grow twice as much
food as the United States does
now. And by using manual, or
ganic techniques and fertiliz
ers grown or produced on their
farms. But we may have to face
the possibility that our sustain
able yield level will be less than
our optimum yield level."
Jeavons turned away from
the potato bed and regarded
me fora moment, as if to make
sure I had understood every
thing up to that point. After tak
ing a deep breath, he turned
and pointed to a pair of
plastic-covered structures
which were, evidently,
greenhouses. One was very
similar in appearance to a con
ventional greenhouse but the
other one was only three feet
high and just covered one
hundred-square-foot bed.
"Now with these miniature
greenhouses," Jeavons said,
"a 12-month growing season is
possible in most climates
where food is grown. What this
means is you could grow your
total diet on as little as 1250
square feet working as little as
15 minutes a day." He walked
to the center of the area and
spread his arms. "That's this
much," he said, his tone imply
ing how little he thought 1250
square feet to be. I was a little
incredulous for a moment be
cause the space he indicated
really seemed no larger than
the average living room. But
then I remembered that an
acre is somewhat more than
40,000 square feet. I had no
trouble believing that the de
signated area was about a thir
tieth of an acre. "And, he said,
with a smile, "even though it's
too early to say on the record,
we expect to go much, much
lower than that to grow a total
diet."

In 1840 the German chemist
Justus von Liebig published a
paper entitled "Chemistry in
its application to agriculture
and physiology." This event,
giving birth to a whole new ap •
proach to the cultivation of
food — which I will call "chem
ical agriculture" — intruded
into the gradual evolution of
farming with all the virulence
of a malignant tumor.
It is true that relatively little
change had taken place in ag
riculture since the dawn of
civilization — 4000 years or

more if one goes back to the
Chinese farmers mentioned by
Jeavons; it is true that during
the period in which chemical
agriculture was developed in
earnest — from the 1880s to the
1920s — the world's population
was growing at a heretofore
unimaginable rate; and it is
true that many well
intentioned people saw in
chemical agriculture the only
means of putting food in the
staggering number of new and
hungry mouths.
It is also true, however, that
concurrent with the rise of
chemical agriculture were the
several great strides outlined
by Jeavons — the strides which
developed in a relatively short
time into the biodynamic-
French intensive method. As
chemical agriculture
burgeoned into an industry
and an orthodoxy, men such as
Rudolf Steiner — and he was
far from alone — recognized
the folly of abandoning
methods proven over millenia
for new and untried
techniques. On the next occa
sion on which I met with
jeavons, I asked him what he
believed were the causes for
the headlong rush toward
chemicals in the face of saner
councils.
"Well, part of the reason,"
he said, "was that as chemical
fertilizers came into play, trac
tors were being developed and
brought into use on many
farms. This made it possible to
spread chemical fertilizer very
easily. It was less time
consuming than spreading
manures. Also, with the tractor
you were able to farm large
areas. Even though it wasn't in
tensive, you could farm a large
area and produce a lot of food
in a very short time. The prom
ise of opening up increased ac
reage was very seductive. To
most people, two to four times
the area meant two to four
times the food. On the other
hand, the French intensive cul
ture that was developed out
side Paris required an awful lot
of people per acre. So with
everyone getting caught up in
the petrochemical
mechanized revolution, the
tendency was to equate 'faster'
with 'more and better.' Which
for a short time was probably
true. But if we get into today's
period, the petrochemicals are
getting more expensive so
spending more time and labor
to get the same amount of food
isn't as unappealing as it used
to be. But more important, I

believe,
from the
perspective
of our re
search, is
that we be
lieve we're
going to be
able to
produce as
much food
per hour as
a machine
can — by
hand. The
way that
we're going
to be able
to do this is
by thinking
about

what's been done in the past,
about what's being done cur
rently, and maximizing the
simplicity which produces the
time efficiency."
During the course of the last
half century, many of the
spokesmen for non-chemical
agriculture have found them
selves ostracized for their be
liefs and techniques. At best
they have been ignored by the
academic and political estab
lishment, at worst they have
been actively harassed and
obstructed in presenting their
cases before the public. One of


these men, Sir Albert Howard,
an Imperial Botanist for the In
dian government, "did some
fantastic things," according to
Jeavons. "Everyone had told
him he couldn't grow cotton
organically in India because
the pests would eat it up. It
took him a while but at the end
of five years, he was growing
cotton organically — with no
pesticides. He had less crop
loss than the people who were
using pesticides."
Although knighted for this
and other accomplishments,
Howard received so much pub
lic ridicule — both from fer-

tilizer in
dustry
spokesmen
and his fel
low scien
tists — that
his ideas
went
widely un
heeded.
Howard
wrote, after

addressing one particularly
nonreceptive audience of
botanists, "Here again I was
amazed by the limited know
ledge and experience of the
world's agriculturalists dis
closed by this debate. I felt I
was dealing with beginners
and that some of the argu
ments put forward could al
most be described as the im
pertinences of ignorance."
In this country, the case of
|.l. Rodale, whose publications
are among the standard refer
ences for a large segment of
the organic farming popula
tion, is not unusual. Rodale
was forced to spend almost a
quarter of a million dollars in
legal fees to win a court deci
sion over the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission which had
blocked the publication of his
book "The Health Finder."
I asked )eavons whether he
thought these examples indi
cated the presence of an estab
lishment which had a vested in
terest in the development and
maintenance of chemical ag
riculture irrespective of the
best interests of mankind. It
was true, he said, that
"businessmen are always
ready to take advantage of a
good thing and push it to the
fullest," but there were proba
bly "two separate thrusts" —
business incentives and desire
for greater efficiency — which
"then became merged."
leavons then related an in
teresting anecdote, most of
which had to remain off the re
cord, which was a telling
statement about the present
state of agricultural research.
"It was amazing to me," he
said, "that agricultural schools
are not more interested in re
search like that (Howard's),
and in trying to replicate it — at
least as an alternative ap
proach. I wrote a letter to an
individual who was involved in
agricultural research at a col
lege here in California. I told
him I was confused. In the light
of some of the possibilities we
were uncovering with the
biodynamic-French intensive
method, why wasn't anyone
investigating our results. He
wrote me back a very good let
ter. He indicated that the re
search money is coming from
thechemical industriesand the
agricultural interests. They
have an interest in using the
system they've already got.
And again, their purpose is
making money from it, not
necessarily making it better. So
you see, the professors almost
have to ridicule alternative
methods. If they go into other
areas, they become profes
sionally ostracized and they
can't get funds."
leavons continued with
another anecdote, this time
regarding a conference about
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method which was held

last year in Santa Barbara. Sev
eral members of the American
Society of Agronomy had at
tended, he said, and had asked
questions about the
mechanisms of the improved
plant growth. "If we couldn't
tell them exactly how it was
happening, in their terms and
language, they wouldn't give it
very much credence. Someone
pointed out that the Romans
knew how to make concrete a
long time before anyone knew
why it worked. There's a kind
of scientific myopia here. It's
like they're saying, you can
only be scientific if you're sci
entific in the way in which we
are scientific. Well, good lord,
if someone's demonstrating
that something is possible,
anyone who's really an open
minded scientist ought to be
excited and interested to find
out why it's possible. But there
aren't any funds for them to do
it."
leavons is not alone in his
observation of "scientific
myopia" in the present
academic community. In April,
1973, Nicholas Wade reported
in Science magazine that "a
blue-ribbon committee of
basic and agricultural scien
tists" found that "the basic re
search performed by federal
and state agricultural research
organizations is of meager
quality, suffers from a 'shock
ing lack of intellectual leader
ship' and is guided by policies
detrimental to the interests of
agriculture."
Although no reference was
made to a lack of attention to
any specific area of research,
University of Chicago Biology
Prof. Richard Levins wrote in a
later issue of Science that "the
issues raised by Nicholas
Wade's report have to be set
into a broader context than
simply the policies of the U.S.
Department of Agricul
ture. . . . Within agricultural
science, America's traditional
anti-intellectualism survives as
an antitheoretical bias. . . .It is
reinforced by the search for
marketable products (mostly
chemical) as the central
strategy for improvement of
agriculture . . . and by a nar
row acceptance of the present
structure of agriculture as a
given condition which restricts
options. For example, the con
sideration of mixed plantings is
inhibited by the present design
of farm machinery."
The tone of both articles asks
the question, "Ought we to let
this happen?" The tone taken
increasingly by more and more
far-sighted scientists today,
however, is "Can we afford to
let this happen?" jeavons him
self points to the dwindling
supply of natural gas — the
current reserves of which are
slated to run out in about a de
cade — as one factor which
could lead to an agricultural
disaster. Since the production
of artificial nitrogen fertilizer
has been made almost wholly
dependent on natural gas, he
says, and since there is evi-

dence indi
cating that
nitrogen fi
xation from
the air by
soil bac
teria stops
in the pre
sence of ar
tificial fer
tilizer
which in

turn causes a soil "addiction"
to this form of fertilizer, it
seems likely that we will be
faced with the necessity of
using pollution-producing coal
to satisfy our farmlands'
"habit." And even the coal
supply will someday be
exhausted.
Yet even if the scarcity of
energy were not an issue, the
question would still be a valid
one. In addition to beini:


ecologically unsound, our pre
sent system of food production
is economically and technolog
ically unsatisfactory for a large
segment of the world's popula
tion. As Frances Moore Lappe
and ]oseph Collins de
monstrate in their book, Food
First, the expensive technology
and inflated prices which "ag
ribusiness" and its "global
supermarket" force on unde
veloped nations do as much to
hinder their progress as any
other single factor.
Jeavons' belief is that the
solution to many of the world's
food-related problems —
ecological, economical and
technological — lies in a global
move to small-scale farming. A
February, 1976 paper released
by Ecology Action states that
"the current food shortages
will worsen into a crisis of
global proportions unless the
productivity of the 100 million
small farms in the developing
world is increased dramati
cally. Several key points make
the biodynamic-Fiench inten
sive method especially viable
in countries with limited re
sources: The method does not
require complicated machin
ery or expensive fertilizers.
The key technological element
is the common shovel. The
method uses 1/2 to 1/16 the wa
ter. This will be especially valu
able in arid areas of the world,
or those limited to natural rain
fall. The method provides a
self-sufficient livelihood in
areas of high unemployment.
The method's diversified ap
proach encourages intercrop
ping with local foods, thus of
fering a varied diet. The
method builds a healthy soil,
the key to dependable food
production and the building of
a stable economic and social
system."
And, according to a paper
co-authored by leavons, "The
small farm, all factors consi
dered, is actually a more effi
cient unit of production than
its large-scale counterpart. To
quote Sterling Wortman of the
Rockerfeller Foundation, . .
most large-scale mechanized
agriculture is less productive
per unit area than small scale
farming can be. The farmer on
a small holding can engage in
intensive high yield gardening,
systems such as intercropping,
multiple cropping, relay plant
ing or other techniques that
require attention to individual
plants. The point is that
mechanized agriculture is very
productive in terms of output
per man-year, but it is not as
productive per unit of land as
the highly intensive systems
are.' Much of the economic
advantage large farms now
enjoy is not due to any stream
lining inherent in their size but
in the tax structures and sub
sidies which favor corporate
'tax loss' farming, land specula
tion, and vertical stratification
of the food industry from pro
duction of fertilizers, to farm
ing, to packaging and distribu
tion of food products."
Jeavons is generally unop
timistic

about the
prospects
for a rapid
change
from our
current ag
ricultural
practices,
projecting
50years as a
minimum

before such a transformation
will be started on a large scale.
"The thing that has always con
fused me," he told me, "is why
so few people have asked why
can't we keep the organic,
small-scale simplicity and also
have the sophistication of
modern science. I think one
reason why people don't get
into that too much is because
they're thinking on a closed

system basis — and it gets away
from a growth economy.
There's no audience for this in
this country, very few people
living that kind of lifestyle.
They're not putting their
energy into making it happen.
They're still chasing the growth
economy that is epitomized by
the development of the tractor
and the chemical fertilizers."
Lemmings have at least one
thing to recommend them
over mankind — at least when
they rush to their destruction,
•they do not drag the rest of the
planet with them. But mankind
has at least one thing to re
commend it over lemmings: at
least as it rushes to its destruc
tion, it can see where it is going
and attempt to stop before it is

too late.
It often
seems,
however,
that rather
than at
tempting to
stop our
sprint to
ward an
nihilation,

one part of
our species is actively engaged
in accelerating our progress
while the other part fiddles
marching tunes like a whole
race of carefree Neros. We find
our leaders more concerned
with their own destinies than
those of the people they are
supposed to lead; we find, in
fact, that they seem to have no
awareness of any destiny other
than their own. We find them
structuring our culture for
their own ends, without regard
for any future more distant
than the probable span of their
lives. We find an educational
system which perpetuates
their narrow-sightedness. We
at the summit of our culture
find ourselves in the midst of a
highly-sophisticated,
apparently-benign process
which teaches us to shut our
eyes and go faster.
But then it can not be de
nied: the power of vision has
not left us entirely; there are
those who do stretch their
necks to look around. It is no
doubt painful and traumatic to
take a long look at the destruc
tion which we are cultivating.
But there are, these people tell
us, other views, views as prom
ising as the scene immediately
before us is threatening. And,
hope being what it is, they are
working to divert our rush.
)eavons, obviously, is such a
man. He is not militant, anar
chistic, alienated, alienating or
bitter. As he says, "you don't
really need to change the sys
tem to live a better life."
leavons is just quietly pursuing
his work, doing what he can to
bring about an improvement in
the attitude of our culture.

Grow More Vegetables Than
You Ever Thought Possible
On Less Land Than You Can

The headquarters of the Syn
tex Corporation is located
on a hillside just west of Footh
ill Expressway, across from
Palo Alto's Veterans Administ
ration Hospital. A large cement
and glass building in the mod
ern architectural style, it sits on
a very green and well-groomed
lawn. At the foot of the hill,
however, literally a stone's
throw away from the
chemical-pharmaceuticals bas
tion, an incongruous sight pre
sents itself: a truck garden, in
the best tradition of truck gar
dens. It is a disorderly collage
of colors and textures — the
lush green of crops and weeds,
the crumbling dark brown of
newly turned earth, the dry
light brown of withered vege
tation, the dusty white sheen
of sheet plastic, the hard lustre
less gray of metal siding.

A casual passerby, observing
the two establishments, would
be likely to see in their proxim
ity the tension which often
exists between the new and
dynamic and the old and static.
Palo Aito, he might surmise, is
in the final stages of a
metamorphosis from the pas
toral to the cosmopolitan; the
garden, a quaint anachronism,
will soon be the site of yet
another corporate headquar
ters and the cement and glass
building on the hillside will ac
quire, by comparison, an air of
establishment and seniority.

Such is not the case, how
ever. Quite to the contrary, the
cement and glass building
antedates the garden; the land
on which the garden is located
is owned by the corporation
and worked by the garden's
proprietors under the terms of
a rent-free lease; the operation
of the garden is partially sub
sidized, with virtually no return
obligations, by the corpora
tion's donation, in addition to
the land, of water and funds. It
is an unusual situation, but it is
an unusual truck garden.
Foods ranging from grains to
fruit to beans to vegetables are
under cultivation there. The
yield of any given foodstuff at
any given harvest time typically
ranges from two to 31 times the
national, California or Santa
Clara County average
(whichever is higher). From
one-half to one-sixteenth the
average amount of water per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. From one-half to
one-sixteenth the average
amount of nitrogen fertilizer
per pound of food produced is
typically used. About one
one-hundredth the energy per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. No "chemical" fer
tilizer is used. Mo pesticides of
any type are used. No machin
ery more sophisticated than a
simple wheelbarrow is used.
And it is not uncommon to see
men and women in business
dress entering or leaving the
garden or engaged in some
phase of agriculture.
Despite these arresting facts,
the garden and its proprietors
remain surprisingly anonym
ous. Perhaps it is the
previously-described undis
tinguished character of the
former, or maybe it is the
quiet, unassuming style of the
latter. It may even be that it has
less to do with either the
former or latter than the nature
of the rest of the world. What
ever the case, it would be a
poor bet indeed to wager that
that anonymity is to be pre
served for very much longer.
Although I have been in
terested in food in general
and gardening in specific for
much of my life, the terms
"biodynamic" and "French in
tensive" remained obscure to
me until I made the acquain
tance of John leavons. An
alumnus of Yale and former
head of Business Services for
the Stanford library system,
leavons currently wields the

ponderous title of Director of
Agricultural Research for Ecol
ogy Action of the Midpenin
sula.
It is largely Jeavons who is
responsible for the present
shape — in both a physLal and
an abstract sense — of the ag
ricultural program underway
on the three and three-quarter
acre plot of Syntex land. It was
Jeavons who, after making a
study on his own initiative of
United Nations iand use and

population
figures, be
came con
vinced that
the planet
was still
capable of
feeding all
her in
habitants;
it was he
who, after
attending a
seminar on
the agricul
tural
techniques

synthesized by the Englishman
Alan Chadwick, sought out the
master horticulturalist in his
barren hillside-turned Garden
of Eden at the University of
California at Santa Cruz; it was
Jeavons who, after talking at
length with Chadwick, prop
osed the idea of a combined
research and community gar
den to the board of directors of
Ecology Action, a Palo Alto
conservation group which had
won recognition for a success
ful city-wide recycling prog-

ram; it was he who, after con
vincing them of the viability
and significance of such a
program, proceeded to as
semble the elements of Com
mon Ground — land, funds,
people — and embark on a
course of rigorous scientific
research.
The program is now in its
sixth year. Each succeeding
year has, according to Jeavons,
confirmed his faith in Chad
wick's techniques, known now
as the biodynamic-French in
tensive method.
When I first spoke with
leavons, I had a vague recollec
tion of a chapter in a gardening
book which had described a
"labor-intensive" system of
farming which allowed the
densely-populated countries
of western Europe to grow
much food on little land. This, I
imagined, was related to
"French-intensive" farming. In
his articulate and methodical
way, Jeavons soon clarified and
expanded this conception —
and made me realize how large
a topic this form of agriculture
had become.
"The method we're using
now," he said, "is made up of
two techniques that were de
veloped in Europe around the
turn of the century. The French
intensive method is one—that
reached its culmination in the
1890s outside Paris. What it did
was it raised vegetables in beds
that consisted of 18 inches of
horse manure — which was re
ally plentiful at the time. Be
cause of this high level of or
ganic matter and the fertility it
created, as well as the great
depth of loose material, roots
were able to grow downward
instead of needing room to
grow out horizontally. So they
were able to use very close
spacing."
This simple concept, leavons
continued, accounts for a sig
nificant part of the increased
yields which the method pro
duces. As jeavons phrased it in
a research report summarizing
Common Ground's first four
years, "A simple 24-inch deep
soil preparation allows the

plants to be spaced more
closely so that their leaves
touch or almost touch. . . .
This factor alone would make
fourfold yields possible be
cause four times as many
plants as usual can be planted
in a given area."
"The other technique,"
Jeavons told me, "was the
biodynamic technique. It was
developed in the 1920s by
Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian
genius who was into educa
tion, philosophy, religion, and
agriculture. The French inten
sive method had been de
veloped over hundreds of
years by French marchiers or
gardeners. The biodynamic
method, though, was de
veloped by Steiner in the late
'20s fora lot of wealthy German
farmers who had noticed that
their yields were going down
and they were getting more in
sect and disease problems. It
turned out they had been using
chemical fertilizers. Urea, a
kind of artifical nitrogen, had
been developed in the late
1880s. Steiner traced their
problems to the chemical fer
tilizers and suggested that they
return to some of their old
methods and adopt five special
practices. These practices be
camethe biodynamic method.
"One was the use of raised
beds — beds only 12 inches
deep prepared by raking soil
out of the path. This was going
back to the Greeks who found
out that plants grew better in
landslides. The raised beds as
they came to be dug were like
little, artificial landslides. The
reasons the plants do better in
them is because the soil is
looser and there's more air or
gases in it — you need up to 50
percent gases for good plant
growth."
jeavons frequently uses the
verb "dovetail" to describe
areas where two concepts in
termesh or compliment each
other. The deep soil prepara
tion and close spacing of the
French intensive method
dovetails, he said, with the "ar
tificial landslides" of the
biodynamic method to pro

duce healthier, more produc
tive plants.
"There was a study in the '50s
at the University of California
at Berkeley," he said, "that
showed that if you improved
root health by two to four per
cent for most common field
crops you could increase the
yields by 200 to 400 percent.
One of the things which can
make this possible is better soil
preparation and aeration. With
our method, you have more air
in the soil, more surface area
for contact between soil and air
since a raised bed has a curved
surface and also more surface
area to absorb rain or watering
and warmth from the sun. And
the curved surface also allows
you to increase the planting
area by 20 percent. Say you
have a plot of land that's a
hundred square feet and you
make it a raised bed, you can
wind up with 120 square feet of
planting area.
"The second technique that
Steiner recommended, after
the raised beds — which inci
dentally may even have gone
back even before the Greeks to
the Chinese, possibly 4000
years ago — was the use of or
ganic fertilizers. Chemical fer
tilizers at the time were mainly
just nitrogen or nitrogen and
phosphorous. They weren't
balanced or complete; they
needed trace minerals and
potash. Also the chemical fer
tilizers broke down very
quickly and harmed the texture
and structure of the soil and
killed the microbiotic life and

so forth. So Steiner asked the
German farmers to return to
organic fertilizers that were
more balanced and diverse —
like fish meal which has nitro
gen, phosphorous and trace
mi nerals and breaks down over
a period of six months instead
of four to six weeks.
"The third technique was
companion planting. There
were a lot of folk myths about
what things to grow well to
gether. Steiner tried to scienti
fically investigate this through
such techniques as
chromatography and crystalli
zation and field testing to de
termine which plants grown
together would do better. For
instance, one part chamomile
grown with two hundred parts
of wheat increases the health
and yield of wheat. But if its
one to one, one part
chamomile grown with one
part wheat, the wheat will be
destroyed, or at least seriously
harmed.
"Another technique was the
use of herbal sprays. At one
point they were almost a cult.
You take stinging nettles, for
example, and you do some
thing like — I can't remember
exactly — bury it three feet
under the ground at a certain
conjunction of the plants and
leave it under there for six
months and dig it up and mix it
in with a water solution and
then spray it on the ground. It's
supposed to stimulate the
micorobiotic life of the soil
which helps the plants. Really
far out, really unusual, but it
works.
"And the fifth thing was
planting by the phases of the
moon. The rationale for this
comes from seeing the moon's
effect on oceans — daily tides
of up to 40 feet in some parts of
the world. There's water in the
ground, in seeds and in plants
so it seems there might be a
small effect there.
"So those were the two
threads — the French intensive
method and Steiner's five
biodynamic techniques.
"Now, Chadwick, who is, I
think, a horticultural genius,

certainly a horticultural artist,
put these two techniques to
gether sometime between the
1930s and the 1960s when he
came to Santa Cruz. He had
been severely exasperated by
the second world war. A
woman named Freiavon Molka
and he got together and de
cided that one of the best ways
to bring peace and life and
harmony back into the world
was through gardens. Chad
wick had studied under the
French marchiers and he had
studied under Steiner. He's
had over 50 years of experience
in raising food. He also worked
under George Bernard Shaw in
drama, he's a painter, an actor,
an incredible individual — very
dramatic in his presentation of
things.
"When he put the two farm
ing techniques together, he
simplified them. Where
Steiner would make herbal
preparations, Chadwick would
just grow the herb, the stinging
nettle say, in the bed and then
put it in the compost pile and
let it have a living kind of influ
ence. Instead of using dead
mulches he used living mulch
— when the plants are so close
together that their leaves just
about touch, the ground is
shaded, moisture is con
served, a micro-climate is
created. So his whole orienta
tion is using living plants and
giving to nature as much as she
produces and even a little
more. If you give to nature
more than she gives you, she
will continually provide you
with abundance.
"So Chadwick prepares his
beds 24 inches deep, not just
18, he uses compost mainly
from vegetable matter, he uses
very little manure — in contrast
with the French and in contrast
with the other biodynamic
people who sometimes use a
lot of manure. This is important
worldwide because one-third
of the world's people now have
a different kind of energy
crisis: they don't have enough
firewood. So like in India,
they're burning the manure
from animals to heat their
homes and to cook their food.
There's a fertilizer shortage
there. But you don't need the
manure under Chadwick's
technique; most of it is veget
able compost, as I said.
"So he uses 24-inch-deep
soil preparation; close spac
ing; comparatively speaking, a
vegetarian or quasi-vegetarian
compost that's two-thirds veg
etable matter, one-third soil;
he uses living herbs rather than
herbal sprays, generally; he
uses some organic fertilizers,
mainly bone meal but not
much else; and he plants by
the phases of the moon."
/ / K| ow we started re-
searching the method
in 1972. Our purposes were
twofold. One was to document
how the method was done — it
had never been documented
in written form because Chad
wick doesn't believe in the
written word but by handing
things down by example and
by word of mouth, master to
apprentice and so forth. Also it
had been reputed that the
method produced four times
the average yield, but this had
never been documented one
way or another.
"The lot Syntex gave us had a
soil which was one-third rock
— meaning pebbles and stuff.
Normal agricultural soil is
maybe five percent rock, not 33
percent. In addition, our soil
was over one-third clay. There
was no nitrogen fertilizer in the
soil and just a trace of phos
phorous and potash.
"During our first five years
we got very encouraging re
sults — yields which ranged
anywhere from two to 16 times
the U.S., Santa Clara County or
California averages. Then in
1976, I developed a new

technique called 'superdig
ging' which is a sort of a super
texturizing technique. This
technique improves the soil
more rapidly. It takes up to five
years using normal techniques
to improve the soil. Re
member, we were in subsoil
clay with no top soil at all. As a
result of this new technique,
this year we've gone as high as
about 60 times the Santa Clara
County average with zucchini
using about two percent of the
water per pound of food pro
duced and one percent of the
added nitrogen fertilizer per
pound of food produced. In
the case of grain, we're as high
as two and a quarter times the
national average on soybeans,

double on
wheat and
expect to
go six to
eight times
for those
yields.
Also, we
expect to
be using
one third to
one-eighth
the water
per pound
of grain
produced
— and that
could be
significant
because it
means you

could be getting very high
grain yields with as little as
eight or 10 inches of rainfall.
Over 75 percent of the arable
area of the world has 10 or
more inches of rainfall.
"An interesting thing is that
the Zulus of South Africa use a
similar technique — similar to
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method, that is, that they
developed on their own. It's a
triple-digging technique, lust
before it rains they prepare the
soil three feet deep and as
soon as it does rain they plant
their grain. It doesn't rain all
summer and is very dry. They
grow grain when no one else
can grow grain anywhere. So
here's a similar technique
that's working under natural
rainfall conditions.
"What this means is that if
we reach all of our projections,
we would be getting an aver
age of four to eight times on
vegetables and six to eight
times the average yield on
grain. And these yields, by the
way are already being obtained
somewhere else in the world
on the average — and on a
large scale basis. A way to high
light this is to say that for every
major crop grown in the Un
ited States, some other country
in the world on the average is
getting a yield about twice as
high. So U.S. agriculture,
though it may look good, is not
the best with all crops."
One morning soon after our
first conversation, I met
Jeavons for a tour of the Com
mon Ground garden. He is
plainly in his element there. A
fairly large man in his mid-30s
he sports an incipient pot belly
and a voluminous though
well-behaved beard. He was
dressed in mud-spattered
work pants, a heavy flannel
shirt and a sweat-stained
leather cap. He generally main
tains a serious demeanor al
though when he smiles he re
veals a considerable capacity
for simple delight. His eyes
especially, manifest his posi
tive attitude: whether engaged
in a visual analysis of crop
progress, gazing at clouds in
the distance or glancing at his
auditor, they are intelligent,
energetic, unusually alive.
He took me first to some
thing he called an "herbal
lawn." From a distance, this
looked similar to a grass lawn
— green and flat. Standing next
to it, however, I saw that its

color was not uniform. In
terspersed among the light
green of sweet clover were
plants of darker shades —
identified by Jeavons as Roman
chamomile, creeping thyme
and dwarf yarrow. In addition
to being "simple and beauti
ful," Jeavons said, the lawn
fixes nitrogen in the soil and
concentrates phosphorous
and potash in its leaves. It is
thus beneficial to the soil on
which it is grown and can be
mown as a source of
nutriment-rich compost.
For the next hour we looked
at such things as newly-planted
fruit trees, fragrant and useful
herbs, fallow planting beds,
freshly-prepared planting

beds, planting beds overflow
ing with mature vegetables and
legumes, and recently har
vested planting beds. All the
while Jeavons kept up an in
teresting commentary filled
with odd facts and anecdotes.
"You see those nicely dug beds
over there?" he asked at one
point. "Those were prepared
by a 65-year-old woman with a
heart condition."
Finally, he led me to a
fenced-off area with a pad
locked gate. "This is the re
search garden," he said.
"What we've been looking at is
the community garden. People
from all over, including about
five to 10 percent of all the Syn
tex employees, are involved
with raising food here."
Inside the research garden
were rows of beds each about
six feet wide and 20 feet long. I
was slightly disappointed by
the modest dimensions of the
whole garden — smaller than
that occupied by the average
house — since it seemed that
something larger would be re
quired for such significant re
search.
"This area is about 2500
square feet," Jeavons said as if
reading my thoughts. "Our re
search indicates that a com
pletely balanced diet could be
grown on this much space —
and with as little as a half hour
of work a day. The same
amount of food, if it were
grown by U.S. chemical,
mechanized techniques would
take 10,000 square feet. In In
dia, the same diet would take
32,000 square feet.
"Now, the average American
eats 322 pounds of vegetables
and soft fruits — fruits like
strawberries, cantalopes and
watermelon — a year. Two
hundred and twenty of those
pounds are potatoes. You can
grow that amount of vegeta
bles with the biodynamic-
French intensive method in 100
square feet in a four to six
month growing season. In the
case of fruit trees, you can put
two of them in a hundred
square foot bed on eight foot
centers. Each of those fruit
trees should produce a
hundred pounds of hard fruit
per year and the average
American eats 162 pounds of
hard fruit a year. It should take
you maybe a half a minute to a
minute a day to take care of the
trees on an average basis and it
should take you about five to
10 minutes a day to take care of

the vegetable bed.
"So what we're talking about
is eventually people can start
raising a fair amount of their
food just in their back yard. A
family of four, in 400 square
feet, could raise in a four to six
month growing season food
worth $480 in five to 10 minutes
a day each. Their labor would
then be worth $4 to $8 an hour.
Now a person is probably not
going to do this the first year if
he's never gardened before,
but he's going to do a lot better
than he's done with other
techniques. What this means
for overseas, for India, for
example, where they have fer
tilizer shortages, energy shor
tages, water shortages and
food shortages, is that in a
small area, say 2500 to 7000
square feet they could raise
their total diet rather than in
32,000 square feet. So small is
beautiful: in this country, de
escalation of technology; for
overseas, a move to more self
sufficiency."
We moved to a bed with
some dried leaves and with
ered stalks in it which I recog
nized as potatoes, leavons
went on.
"Now in monetary terms,
with potatoes, we're now at
four times the national average
but we expect to go much
higher— maybe well above 20.
We're still experimenting with
that. I can't tell you on the re
cord how high we expect to go
but I can say on the record it's
over 20. With zucchini, when
we got only 16 times the Santa
Clara county average, the bed
produced $12.50 an hour — or
would have if we'd sold it all at
the wholesale rate. Now that
we're up to 60, we're talking
about producing three times
that or $37.50 an hour. This is
an extreme case but it should
be possible to earn a minimum
of $4 an hour just raising your
own vegetables.
"We're guessing that a new
kind of job or profession will
come out of all of this — mini
farming. We estimate that it
will be possible for one person
working a 40-hour week to
raise $15,000 net on as little as a
quarter of an acre. Currently
small farmers with farms of 200
to4oo acres are lucky if they net
several thousand dollars.
"So our philosophy is one of
low techonology, that is, simple
technology but sophisticated
theory. And I should say that
we're not a 'labor-intensive'
method as many people have
said we are. It's actually 'skill
intensive.' Bed preparation
may be the hardest job of the
method but once the soil is in
good shape and using a new
device that they've developed
in Canada, it should be possi
ble to prepare a bed in five to
10 minutes.
"All the resources that we
need to raise food right are av
ailable— we're just using them
in the wrong way. Take wheat
production, for example.
Normally to produce more
grain you have to use a lot
more fertilizer. For instance
with corn, from 1940 to 1960,
the nitrogen fertilizer use in
creased 10-fold, but the yields
only doubled. So your fertilizer
effectiveness was only one
fifth as good in 1960 as it was in
1940. Well, we cut our nitrogen
fertilizer use in one year to
one-half and the yield dou
bled. At the same time the pro
tein content increased. It went
from 14.8 percent to 15.7.
Normally when your yields go
up, your protein content per
pound of food goes down. Plus
we used less water and less
energy, less phosphorous and
less potash.
"Eventually, if we get all the
projections that we expect to
get, we'll be producing as
much food per hour as people
with machines can produce. So
this makes the individual im

portant again and gives the in
dividual a choice.
"I should stress that we've
got a ways to go yet. We don't
have a perfect system. We have
failures; we haven't reached all
our projections, but we've had
a lot of good results too.
"Right now, we think if the
method has an Achilles heel, it
will be in the net flow of or
ganic matter in and out of the
soil. We may have to face the
possibility that with the yields
we're now getting, we'll
exhaust the soil in a few more
years. The most important
thing about an agricultural
method is whether it is sustain
able in an environmentally ba
lanced way. The Chinese have
been able for hundreds of
years to grow twice as much
food as the United States does
now. And by using manual, or
ganic techniques and fertiliz
ers grown or produced on their
farms. But we may have to face
the possibility that our sustain
able yield level will be less than
our optimum yield level."
Jeavons turned away from
the potato bed and regarded
me fora moment, as if to make
sure I had understood every
thing up to that point. After tak
ing a deep breath, he turned
and pointed to a pair of
plastic-covered structures
which were, evidently,
greenhouses. One was very
similar in appearance to a con
ventional greenhouse but the
other one was only three feet
high and just covered one
hundred-square-foot bed.
"Now with these miniature
greenhouses," Jeavons said,
"a 12-month growing season is
possible in most climates
where food is grown. What this
means is you could grow your
total diet on as little as 1250
square feet working as little as
15 minutes a day." He walked
to the center of the area and
spread his arms. "That's this
much," he said, his tone imply
ing how little he thought 1250
square feet to be. I was a little
incredulous for a moment be
cause the space he indicated
really seemed no larger than
the average living room. But
then I remembered that an
acre is somewhat more than
40,000 square feet. I had no
trouble believing that the de
signated area was about a thir
tieth of an acre. "And, he said,
with a smile, "even though it's
too early to say on the record,
we expect to go much, much
lower than that to grow a total
diet."

In 1840 the German chemist
Justus von Liebig published a
paper entitled "Chemistry in
its application to agriculture
and physiology." This event,
giving birth to a whole new ap •
proach to the cultivation of
food — which I will call "chem
ical agriculture" — intruded
into the gradual evolution of
farming with all the virulence
of a malignant tumor.
It is true that relatively little
change had taken place in ag
riculture since the dawn of
civilization — 4000 years or

more if one goes back to the
Chinese farmers mentioned by
Jeavons; it is true that during
the period in which chemical
agriculture was developed in
earnest — from the 1880s to the
1920s — the world's population
was growing at a heretofore
unimaginable rate; and it is
true that many well
intentioned people saw in
chemical agriculture the only
means of putting food in the
staggering number of new and
hungry mouths.
It is also true, however, that
concurrent with the rise of
chemical agriculture were the
several great strides outlined
by Jeavons — the strides which
developed in a relatively short
time into the biodynamic-
French intensive method. As
chemical agriculture
burgeoned into an industry
and an orthodoxy, men such as
Rudolf Steiner — and he was
far from alone — recognized
the folly of abandoning
methods proven over millenia
for new and untried
techniques. On the next occa
sion on which I met with
jeavons, I asked him what he
believed were the causes for
the headlong rush toward
chemicals in the face of saner
councils.
"Well, part of the reason,"
he said, "was that as chemical
fertilizers came into play, trac
tors were being developed and
brought into use on many
farms. This made it possible to
spread chemical fertilizer very
easily. It was less time
consuming than spreading
manures. Also, with the tractor
you were able to farm large
areas. Even though it wasn't in
tensive, you could farm a large
area and produce a lot of food
in a very short time. The prom
ise of opening up increased ac
reage was very seductive. To
most people, two to four times
the area meant two to four
times the food. On the other
hand, the French intensive cul
ture that was developed out
side Paris required an awful lot
of people per acre. So with
everyone getting caught up in
the petrochemical
mechanized revolution, the
tendency was to equate 'faster'
with 'more and better.' Which
for a short time was probably
true. But if we get into today's
period, the petrochemicals are
getting more expensive so
spending more time and labor
to get the same amount of food
isn't as unappealing as it used
to be. But more important, I

believe,
from the
perspective
of our re
search, is
that we be
lieve we're
going to be
able to
produce as
much food
per hour as
a machine
can — by
hand. The
way that
we're going
to be able
to do this is
by thinking
about

what's been done in the past,
about what's being done cur
rently, and maximizing the
simplicity which produces the
time efficiency."
During the course of the last
half century, many of the
spokesmen for non-chemical
agriculture have found them
selves ostracized for their be
liefs and techniques. At best
they have been ignored by the
academic and political estab
lishment, at worst they have
been actively harassed and
obstructed in presenting their
cases before the public. One of


these men, Sir Albert Howard,
an Imperial Botanist for the In
dian government, "did some
fantastic things," according to
Jeavons. "Everyone had told
him he couldn't grow cotton
organically in India because
the pests would eat it up. It
took him a while but at the end
of five years, he was growing
cotton organically — with no
pesticides. He had less crop
loss than the people who were
using pesticides."
Although knighted for this
and other accomplishments,
Howard received so much pub
lic ridicule — both from fer-

tilizer in
dustry
spokesmen
and his fel
low scien
tists — that
his ideas
went
widely un
heeded.
Howard
wrote, after

addressing one particularly
nonreceptive audience of
botanists, "Here again I was
amazed by the limited know
ledge and experience of the
world's agriculturalists dis
closed by this debate. I felt I
was dealing with beginners
and that some of the argu
ments put forward could al
most be described as the im
pertinences of ignorance."
In this country, the case of
|.l. Rodale, whose publications
are among the standard refer
ences for a large segment of
the organic farming popula
tion, is not unusual. Rodale
was forced to spend almost a
quarter of a million dollars in
legal fees to win a court deci
sion over the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission which had
blocked the publication of his
book "The Health Finder."
I asked )eavons whether he
thought these examples indi
cated the presence of an estab
lishment which had a vested in
terest in the development and
maintenance of chemical ag
riculture irrespective of the
best interests of mankind. It
was true, he said, that
"businessmen are always
ready to take advantage of a
good thing and push it to the
fullest," but there were proba
bly "two separate thrusts" —
business incentives and desire
for greater efficiency — which
"then became merged."
leavons then related an in
teresting anecdote, most of
which had to remain off the re
cord, which was a telling
statement about the present
state of agricultural research.
"It was amazing to me," he
said, "that agricultural schools
are not more interested in re
search like that (Howard's),
and in trying to replicate it — at
least as an alternative ap
proach. I wrote a letter to an
individual who was involved in
agricultural research at a col
lege here in California. I told
him I was confused. In the light
of some of the possibilities we
were uncovering with the
biodynamic-French intensive
method, why wasn't anyone
investigating our results. He
wrote me back a very good let
ter. He indicated that the re
search money is coming from
thechemical industriesand the
agricultural interests. They
have an interest in using the
system they've already got.
And again, their purpose is
making money from it, not
necessarily making it better. So
you see, the professors almost
have to ridicule alternative
methods. If they go into other
areas, they become profes
sionally ostracized and they
can't get funds."
leavons continued with
another anecdote, this time
regarding a conference about
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method which was held

last year in Santa Barbara. Sev
eral members of the American
Society of Agronomy had at
tended, he said, and had asked
questions about the
mechanisms of the improved
plant growth. "If we couldn't
tell them exactly how it was
happening, in their terms and
language, they wouldn't give it
very much credence. Someone
pointed out that the Romans
knew how to make concrete a
long time before anyone knew
why it worked. There's a kind
of scientific myopia here. It's
like they're saying, you can
only be scientific if you're sci
entific in the way in which we
are scientific. Well, good lord,
if someone's demonstrating
that something is possible,
anyone who's really an open
minded scientist ought to be
excited and interested to find
out why it's possible. But there
aren't any funds for them to do
it."
leavons is not alone in his
observation of "scientific
myopia" in the present
academic community. In April,
1973, Nicholas Wade reported
in Science magazine that "a
blue-ribbon committee of
basic and agricultural scien
tists" found that "the basic re
search performed by federal
and state agricultural research
organizations is of meager
quality, suffers from a 'shock
ing lack of intellectual leader
ship' and is guided by policies
detrimental to the interests of
agriculture."
Although no reference was
made to a lack of attention to
any specific area of research,
University of Chicago Biology
Prof. Richard Levins wrote in a
later issue of Science that "the
issues raised by Nicholas
Wade's report have to be set
into a broader context than
simply the policies of the U.S.
Department of Agricul
ture. . . . Within agricultural
science, America's traditional
anti-intellectualism survives as
an antitheoretical bias. . . .It is
reinforced by the search for
marketable products (mostly
chemical) as the central
strategy for improvement of
agriculture . . . and by a nar
row acceptance of the present
structure of agriculture as a
given condition which restricts
options. For example, the con
sideration of mixed plantings is
inhibited by the present design
of farm machinery."
The tone of both articles asks
the question, "Ought we to let
this happen?" The tone taken
increasingly by more and more
far-sighted scientists today,
however, is "Can we afford to
let this happen?" jeavons him
self points to the dwindling
supply of natural gas — the
current reserves of which are
slated to run out in about a de
cade — as one factor which
could lead to an agricultural
disaster. Since the production
of artificial nitrogen fertilizer
has been made almost wholly
dependent on natural gas, he
says, and since there is evi-

dence indi
cating that
nitrogen fi
xation from
the air by
soil bac
teria stops
in the pre
sence of ar
tificial fer
tilizer
which in

turn causes a soil "addiction"
to this form of fertilizer, it
seems likely that we will be
faced with the necessity of
using pollution-producing coal
to satisfy our farmlands'
"habit." And even the coal
supply will someday be
exhausted.
Yet even if the scarcity of
energy were not an issue, the
question would still be a valid
one. In addition to beini:


ecologically unsound, our pre
sent system of food production
is economically and technolog
ically unsatisfactory for a large
segment of the world's popula
tion. As Frances Moore Lappe
and ]oseph Collins de
monstrate in their book, Food
First, the expensive technology
and inflated prices which "ag
ribusiness" and its "global
supermarket" force on unde
veloped nations do as much to
hinder their progress as any
other single factor.
Jeavons' belief is that the
solution to many of the world's
food-related problems —
ecological, economical and
technological — lies in a global
move to small-scale farming. A
February, 1976 paper released
by Ecology Action states that
"the current food shortages
will worsen into a crisis of
global proportions unless the
productivity of the 100 million
small farms in the developing
world is increased dramati
cally. Several key points make
the biodynamic-Fiench inten
sive method especially viable
in countries with limited re
sources: The method does not
require complicated machin
ery or expensive fertilizers.
The key technological element
is the common shovel. The
method uses 1/2 to 1/16 the wa
ter. This will be especially valu
able in arid areas of the world,
or those limited to natural rain
fall. The method provides a
self-sufficient livelihood in
areas of high unemployment.
The method's diversified ap
proach encourages intercrop
ping with local foods, thus of
fering a varied diet. The
method builds a healthy soil,
the key to dependable food
production and the building of
a stable economic and social
system."
And, according to a paper
co-authored by leavons, "The
small farm, all factors consi
dered, is actually a more effi
cient unit of production than
its large-scale counterpart. To
quote Sterling Wortman of the
Rockerfeller Foundation, . .
most large-scale mechanized
agriculture is less productive
per unit area than small scale
farming can be. The farmer on
a small holding can engage in
intensive high yield gardening,
systems such as intercropping,
multiple cropping, relay plant
ing or other techniques that
require attention to individual
plants. The point is that
mechanized agriculture is very
productive in terms of output
per man-year, but it is not as
productive per unit of land as
the highly intensive systems
are.' Much of the economic
advantage large farms now
enjoy is not due to any stream
lining inherent in their size but
in the tax structures and sub
sidies which favor corporate
'tax loss' farming, land specula
tion, and vertical stratification
of the food industry from pro
duction of fertilizers, to farm
ing, to packaging and distribu
tion of food products."
Jeavons is generally unop
timistic

about the
prospects
for a rapid
change
from our
current ag
ricultural
practices,
projecting
50years as a
minimum

before such a transformation
will be started on a large scale.
"The thing that has always con
fused me," he told me, "is why
so few people have asked why
can't we keep the organic,
small-scale simplicity and also
have the sophistication of
modern science. I think one
reason why people don't get
into that too much is because
they're thinking on a closed

system basis — and it gets away
from a growth economy.
There's no audience for this in
this country, very few people
living that kind of lifestyle.
They're not putting their
energy into making it happen.
They're still chasing the growth
economy that is epitomized by
the development of the tractor
and the chemical fertilizers."
Lemmings have at least one
thing to recommend them
over mankind — at least when
they rush to their destruction,
•they do not drag the rest of the
planet with them. But mankind
has at least one thing to re
commend it over lemmings: at
least as it rushes to its destruc
tion, it can see where it is going
and attempt to stop before it is

too late.
It often
seems,
however,
that rather
than at
tempting to
stop our
sprint to
ward an
nihilation,

one part of
our species is actively engaged
in accelerating our progress
while the other part fiddles
marching tunes like a whole
race of carefree Neros. We find
our leaders more concerned
with their own destinies than
those of the people they are
supposed to lead; we find, in
fact, that they seem to have no
awareness of any destiny other
than their own. We find them
structuring our culture for
their own ends, without regard
for any future more distant
than the probable span of their
lives. We find an educational
system which perpetuates
their narrow-sightedness. We
at the summit of our culture
find ourselves in the midst of a
highly-sophisticated,
apparently-benign process
which teaches us to shut our
eyes and go faster.
But then it can not be de
nied: the power of vision has
not left us entirely; there are
those who do stretch their
necks to look around. It is no
doubt painful and traumatic to
take a long look at the destruc
tion which we are cultivating.
But there are, these people tell
us, other views, views as prom
ising as the scene immediately
before us is threatening. And,
hope being what it is, they are
working to divert our rush.
)eavons, obviously, is such a
man. He is not militant, anar
chistic, alienated, alienating or
bitter. As he says, "you don't
really need to change the sys
tem to live a better life."
leavons is just quietly pursuing
his work, doing what he can to
bring about an improvement in
the attitude of our culture.

Grow More Vegetables Than
You Ever Thought Possible
On Less Land Than You Can

dia, Australia, Indonesia,
Mexico, Canada and Nepal.


The headquarters of the Syn
tex Corporation is located
on a hillside just west of Footh
ill Expressway, across from
Palo Alto's Veterans Administ
ration Hospital. A large cement
and glass building in the mod
ern architectural style, it sits on
a very green and well-groomed
lawn. At the foot of the hill,
however, literally a stone's
throw away from the
chemical-pharmaceuticals bas
tion, an incongruous sight pre
sents itself: a truck garden, in
the best tradition of truck gar
dens. It is a disorderly collage
of colors and textures — the
lush green of crops and weeds,
the crumbling dark brown of
newly turned earth, the dry
light brown of withered vege
tation, the dusty white sheen
of sheet plastic, the hard lustre
less gray of metal siding.

A casual passerby, observing
the two establishments, would
be likely to see in their proxim
ity the tension which often
exists between the new and
dynamic and the old and static.
Palo Aito, he might surmise, is
in the final stages of a
metamorphosis from the pas
toral to the cosmopolitan; the
garden, a quaint anachronism,
will soon be the site of yet
another corporate headquar
ters and the cement and glass
building on the hillside will ac
quire, by comparison, an air of
establishment and seniority.

Such is not the case, how
ever. Quite to the contrary, the
cement and glass building
antedates the garden; the land
on which the garden is located
is owned by the corporation
and worked by the garden's
proprietors under the terms of
a rent-free lease; the operation
of the garden is partially sub
sidized, with virtually no return
obligations, by the corpora
tion's donation, in addition to
the land, of water and funds. It
is an unusual situation, but it is
an unusual truck garden.
Foods ranging from grains to
fruit to beans to vegetables are
under cultivation there. The
yield of any given foodstuff at
any given harvest time typically
ranges from two to 31 times the
national, California or Santa
Clara County average
(whichever is higher). From
one-half to one-sixteenth the
average amount of water per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. From one-half to
one-sixteenth the average
amount of nitrogen fertilizer
per pound of food produced is
typically used. About one
one-hundredth the energy per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. No "chemical" fer
tilizer is used. Mo pesticides of
any type are used. No machin
ery more sophisticated than a
simple wheelbarrow is used.
And it is not uncommon to see
men and women in business
dress entering or leaving the
garden or engaged in some
phase of agriculture.
Despite these arresting facts,
the garden and its proprietors
remain surprisingly anonym
ous. Perhaps it is the
previously-described undis
tinguished character of the
former, or maybe it is the
quiet, unassuming style of the
latter. It may even be that it has
less to do with either the
former or latter than the nature
of the rest of the world. What
ever the case, it would be a
poor bet indeed to wager that
that anonymity is to be pre
served for very much longer.
Although I have been in
terested in food in general
and gardening in specific for
much of my life, the terms
"biodynamic" and "French in
tensive" remained obscure to
me until I made the acquain
tance of John leavons. An
alumnus of Yale and former
head of Business Services for
the Stanford library system,
leavons currently wields the

ponderous title of Director of
Agricultural Research for Ecol
ogy Action of the Midpenin
sula.
It is largely Jeavons who is
responsible for the present
shape — in both a physLal and
an abstract sense — of the ag
ricultural program underway
on the three and three-quarter
acre plot of Syntex land. It was
Jeavons who, after making a
study on his own initiative of
United Nations iand use and

population
figures, be
came con
vinced that
the planet
was still
capable of
feeding all
her in
habitants;
it was he
who, after
attending a
seminar on
the agricul
tural
techniques

synthesized by the Englishman
Alan Chadwick, sought out the
master horticulturalist in his
barren hillside-turned Garden
of Eden at the University of
California at Santa Cruz; it was
Jeavons who, after talking at
length with Chadwick, prop
osed the idea of a combined
research and community gar
den to the board of directors of
Ecology Action, a Palo Alto
conservation group which had
won recognition for a success
ful city-wide recycling prog-

ram; it was he who, after con
vincing them of the viability
and significance of such a
program, proceeded to as
semble the elements of Com
mon Ground — land, funds,
people — and embark on a
course of rigorous scientific
research.
The program is now in its
sixth year. Each succeeding
year has, according to Jeavons,
confirmed his faith in Chad
wick's techniques, known now
as the biodynamic-French in
tensive method.
When I first spoke with
leavons, I had a vague recollec
tion of a chapter in a gardening
book which had described a
"labor-intensive" system of
farming which allowed the
densely-populated countries
of western Europe to grow
much food on little land. This, I
imagined, was related to
"French-intensive" farming. In
his articulate and methodical
way, Jeavons soon clarified and
expanded this conception —
and made me realize how large
a topic this form of agriculture
had become.
"The method we're using
now," he said, "is made up of
two techniques that were de
veloped in Europe around the
turn of the century. The French
intensive method is one—that
reached its culmination in the
1890s outside Paris. What it did
was it raised vegetables in beds
that consisted of 18 inches of
horse manure — which was re
ally plentiful at the time. Be
cause of this high level of or
ganic matter and the fertility it
created, as well as the great
depth of loose material, roots
were able to grow downward
instead of needing room to
grow out horizontally. So they
were able to use very close
spacing."
This simple concept, leavons
continued, accounts for a sig
nificant part of the increased
yields which the method pro
duces. As jeavons phrased it in
a research report summarizing
Common Ground's first four
years, "A simple 24-inch deep
soil preparation allows the

plants to be spaced more
closely so that their leaves
touch or almost touch. . . .
This factor alone would make
fourfold yields possible be
cause four times as many
plants as usual can be planted
in a given area."
"The other technique,"
Jeavons told me, "was the
biodynamic technique. It was
developed in the 1920s by
Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian
genius who was into educa
tion, philosophy, religion, and
agriculture. The French inten
sive method had been de
veloped over hundreds of
years by French marchiers or
gardeners. The biodynamic
method, though, was de
veloped by Steiner in the late
'20s fora lot of wealthy German
farmers who had noticed that
their yields were going down
and they were getting more in
sect and disease problems. It
turned out they had been using
chemical fertilizers. Urea, a
kind of artifical nitrogen, had
been developed in the late
1880s. Steiner traced their
problems to the chemical fer
tilizers and suggested that they
return to some of their old
methods and adopt five special
practices. These practices be
camethe biodynamic method.
"One was the use of raised
beds — beds only 12 inches
deep prepared by raking soil
out of the path. This was going
back to the Greeks who found
out that plants grew better in
landslides. The raised beds as
they came to be dug were like
little, artificial landslides. The
reasons the plants do better in
them is because the soil is
looser and there's more air or
gases in it — you need up to 50
percent gases for good plant
growth."
jeavons frequently uses the
verb "dovetail" to describe
areas where two concepts in
termesh or compliment each
other. The deep soil prepara
tion and close spacing of the
French intensive method
dovetails, he said, with the "ar
tificial landslides" of the
biodynamic method to pro

duce healthier, more produc
tive plants.
"There was a study in the '50s
at the University of California
at Berkeley," he said, "that
showed that if you improved
root health by two to four per
cent for most common field
crops you could increase the
yields by 200 to 400 percent.
One of the things which can
make this possible is better soil
preparation and aeration. With
our method, you have more air
in the soil, more surface area
for contact between soil and air
since a raised bed has a curved
surface and also more surface
area to absorb rain or watering
and warmth from the sun. And
the curved surface also allows
you to increase the planting
area by 20 percent. Say you
have a plot of land that's a
hundred square feet and you
make it a raised bed, you can
wind up with 120 square feet of
planting area.
"The second technique that
Steiner recommended, after
the raised beds — which inci
dentally may even have gone
back even before the Greeks to
the Chinese, possibly 4000
years ago — was the use of or
ganic fertilizers. Chemical fer
tilizers at the time were mainly
just nitrogen or nitrogen and
phosphorous. They weren't
balanced or complete; they
needed trace minerals and
potash. Also the chemical fer
tilizers broke down very
quickly and harmed the texture
and structure of the soil and
killed the microbiotic life and

so forth. So Steiner asked the
German farmers to return to
organic fertilizers that were
more balanced and diverse —
like fish meal which has nitro
gen, phosphorous and trace
mi nerals and breaks down over
a period of six months instead
of four to six weeks.
"The third technique was
companion planting. There
were a lot of folk myths about
what things to grow well to
gether. Steiner tried to scienti
fically investigate this through
such techniques as
chromatography and crystalli
zation and field testing to de
termine which plants grown
together would do better. For
instance, one part chamomile
grown with two hundred parts
of wheat increases the health
and yield of wheat. But if its
one to one, one part
chamomile grown with one
part wheat, the wheat will be
destroyed, or at least seriously
harmed.
"Another technique was the
use of herbal sprays. At one
point they were almost a cult.
You take stinging nettles, for
example, and you do some
thing like — I can't remember
exactly — bury it three feet
under the ground at a certain
conjunction of the plants and
leave it under there for six
months and dig it up and mix it
in with a water solution and
then spray it on the ground. It's
supposed to stimulate the
micorobiotic life of the soil
which helps the plants. Really
far out, really unusual, but it
works.
"And the fifth thing was
planting by the phases of the
moon. The rationale for this
comes from seeing the moon's
effect on oceans — daily tides
of up to 40 feet in some parts of
the world. There's water in the
ground, in seeds and in plants
so it seems there might be a
small effect there.
"So those were the two
threads — the French intensive
method and Steiner's five
biodynamic techniques.
"Now, Chadwick, who is, I
think, a horticultural genius,

certainly a horticultural artist,
put these two techniques to
gether sometime between the
1930s and the 1960s when he
came to Santa Cruz. He had
been severely exasperated by
the second world war. A
woman named Freiavon Molka
and he got together and de
cided that one of the best ways
to bring peace and life and
harmony back into the world
was through gardens. Chad
wick had studied under the
French marchiers and he had
studied under Steiner. He's
had over 50 years of experience
in raising food. He also worked
under George Bernard Shaw in
drama, he's a painter, an actor,
an incredible individual — very
dramatic in his presentation of
things.
"When he put the two farm
ing techniques together, he
simplified them. Where
Steiner would make herbal
preparations, Chadwick would
just grow the herb, the stinging
nettle say, in the bed and then
put it in the compost pile and
let it have a living kind of influ
ence. Instead of using dead
mulches he used living mulch
— when the plants are so close
together that their leaves just
about touch, the ground is
shaded, moisture is con
served, a micro-climate is
created. So his whole orienta
tion is using living plants and
giving to nature as much as she
produces and even a little
more. If you give to nature
more than she gives you, she
will continually provide you
with abundance.
"So Chadwick prepares his
beds 24 inches deep, not just
18, he uses compost mainly
from vegetable matter, he uses
very little manure — in contrast
with the French and in contrast
with the other biodynamic
people who sometimes use a
lot of manure. This is important
worldwide because one-third
of the world's people now have
a different kind of energy
crisis: they don't have enough
firewood. So like in India,
they're burning the manure
from animals to heat their
homes and to cook their food.
There's a fertilizer shortage
there. But you don't need the
manure under Chadwick's
technique; most of it is veget
able compost, as I said.
"So he uses 24-inch-deep
soil preparation; close spac
ing; comparatively speaking, a
vegetarian or quasi-vegetarian
compost that's two-thirds veg
etable matter, one-third soil;
he uses living herbs rather than
herbal sprays, generally; he
uses some organic fertilizers,
mainly bone meal but not
much else; and he plants by
the phases of the moon."
/ / K| ow we started re-
searching the method
in 1972. Our purposes were
twofold. One was to document
how the method was done — it
had never been documented
in written form because Chad
wick doesn't believe in the
written word but by handing
things down by example and
by word of mouth, master to
apprentice and so forth. Also it
had been reputed that the
method produced four times
the average yield, but this had
never been documented one
way or another.
"The lot Syntex gave us had a
soil which was one-third rock
— meaning pebbles and stuff.
Normal agricultural soil is
maybe five percent rock, not 33
percent. In addition, our soil
was over one-third clay. There
was no nitrogen fertilizer in the
soil and just a trace of phos
phorous and potash.
"During our first five years
we got very encouraging re
sults — yields which ranged
anywhere from two to 16 times
the U.S., Santa Clara County or
California averages. Then in
1976, I developed a new

technique called 'superdig
ging' which is a sort of a super
texturizing technique. This
technique improves the soil
more rapidly. It takes up to five
years using normal techniques
to improve the soil. Re
member, we were in subsoil
clay with no top soil at all. As a
result of this new technique,
this year we've gone as high as
about 60 times the Santa Clara
County average with zucchini
using about two percent of the
water per pound of food pro
duced and one percent of the
added nitrogen fertilizer per
pound of food produced. In
the case of grain, we're as high
as two and a quarter times the
national average on soybeans,

double on
wheat and
expect to
go six to
eight times
for those
yields.
Also, we
expect to
be using
one third to
one-eighth
the water
per pound
of grain
produced
— and that
could be
significant
because it
means you

could be getting very high
grain yields with as little as
eight or 10 inches of rainfall.
Over 75 percent of the arable
area of the world has 10 or
more inches of rainfall.
"An interesting thing is that
the Zulus of South Africa use a
similar technique — similar to
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method, that is, that they
developed on their own. It's a
triple-digging technique, lust
before it rains they prepare the
soil three feet deep and as
soon as it does rain they plant
their grain. It doesn't rain all
summer and is very dry. They
grow grain when no one else
can grow grain anywhere. So
here's a similar technique
that's working under natural
rainfall conditions.
"What this means is that if
we reach all of our projections,
we would be getting an aver
age of four to eight times on
vegetables and six to eight
times the average yield on
grain. And these yields, by the
way are already being obtained
somewhere else in the world
on the average — and on a
large scale basis. A way to high
light this is to say that for every
major crop grown in the Un
ited States, some other country
in the world on the average is
getting a yield about twice as
high. So U.S. agriculture,
though it may look good, is not
the best with all crops."
One morning soon after our
first conversation, I met
Jeavons for a tour of the Com
mon Ground garden. He is
plainly in his element there. A
fairly large man in his mid-30s
he sports an incipient pot belly
and a voluminous though
well-behaved beard. He was
dressed in mud-spattered
work pants, a heavy flannel
shirt and a sweat-stained
leather cap. He generally main
tains a serious demeanor al
though when he smiles he re
veals a considerable capacity
for simple delight. His eyes
especially, manifest his posi
tive attitude: whether engaged
in a visual analysis of crop
progress, gazing at clouds in
the distance or glancing at his
auditor, they are intelligent,
energetic, unusually alive.
He took me first to some
thing he called an "herbal
lawn." From a distance, this
looked similar to a grass lawn
— green and flat. Standing next
to it, however, I saw that its

color was not uniform. In
terspersed among the light
green of sweet clover were
plants of darker shades —
identified by Jeavons as Roman
chamomile, creeping thyme
and dwarf yarrow. In addition
to being "simple and beauti
ful," Jeavons said, the lawn
fixes nitrogen in the soil and
concentrates phosphorous
and potash in its leaves. It is
thus beneficial to the soil on
which it is grown and can be
mown as a source of
nutriment-rich compost.
For the next hour we looked
at such things as newly-planted
fruit trees, fragrant and useful
herbs, fallow planting beds,
freshly-prepared planting

beds, planting beds overflow
ing with mature vegetables and
legumes, and recently har
vested planting beds. All the
while Jeavons kept up an in
teresting commentary filled
with odd facts and anecdotes.
"You see those nicely dug beds
over there?" he asked at one
point. "Those were prepared
by a 65-year-old woman with a
heart condition."
Finally, he led me to a
fenced-off area with a pad
locked gate. "This is the re
search garden," he said.
"What we've been looking at is
the community garden. People
from all over, including about
five to 10 percent of all the Syn
tex employees, are involved
with raising food here."
Inside the research garden
were rows of beds each about
six feet wide and 20 feet long. I
was slightly disappointed by
the modest dimensions of the
whole garden — smaller than
that occupied by the average
house — since it seemed that
something larger would be re
quired for such significant re
search.
"This area is about 2500
square feet," Jeavons said as if
reading my thoughts. "Our re
search indicates that a com
pletely balanced diet could be
grown on this much space —
and with as little as a half hour
of work a day. The same
amount of food, if it were
grown by U.S. chemical,
mechanized techniques would
take 10,000 square feet. In In
dia, the same diet would take
32,000 square feet.
"Now, the average American
eats 322 pounds of vegetables
and soft fruits — fruits like
strawberries, cantalopes and
watermelon — a year. Two
hundred and twenty of those
pounds are potatoes. You can
grow that amount of vegeta
bles with the biodynamic-
French intensive method in 100
square feet in a four to six
month growing season. In the
case of fruit trees, you can put
two of them in a hundred
square foot bed on eight foot
centers. Each of those fruit
trees should produce a
hundred pounds of hard fruit
per year and the average
American eats 162 pounds of
hard fruit a year. It should take
you maybe a half a minute to a
minute a day to take care of the
trees on an average basis and it
should take you about five to
10 minutes a day to take care of

the vegetable bed.
"So what we're talking about
is eventually people can start
raising a fair amount of their
food just in their back yard. A
family of four, in 400 square
feet, could raise in a four to six
month growing season food
worth $480 in five to 10 minutes
a day each. Their labor would
then be worth $4 to $8 an hour.
Now a person is probably not
going to do this the first year if
he's never gardened before,
but he's going to do a lot better
than he's done with other
techniques. What this means
for overseas, for India, for
example, where they have fer
tilizer shortages, energy shor
tages, water shortages and
food shortages, is that in a
small area, say 2500 to 7000
square feet they could raise
their total diet rather than in
32,000 square feet. So small is
beautiful: in this country, de
escalation of technology; for
overseas, a move to more self
sufficiency."
We moved to a bed with
some dried leaves and with
ered stalks in it which I recog
nized as potatoes, leavons
went on.
"Now in monetary terms,
with potatoes, we're now at
four times the national average
but we expect to go much
higher— maybe well above 20.
We're still experimenting with
that. I can't tell you on the re
cord how high we expect to go
but I can say on the record it's
over 20. With zucchini, when
we got only 16 times the Santa
Clara county average, the bed
produced $12.50 an hour — or
would have if we'd sold it all at
the wholesale rate. Now that
we're up to 60, we're talking
about producing three times
that or $37.50 an hour. This is
an extreme case but it should
be possible to earn a minimum
of $4 an hour just raising your
own vegetables.
"We're guessing that a new
kind of job or profession will
come out of all of this — mini
farming. We estimate that it
will be possible for one person
working a 40-hour week to
raise $15,000 net on as little as a
quarter of an acre. Currently
small farmers with farms of 200
to4oo acres are lucky if they net
several thousand dollars.
"So our philosophy is one of
low techonology, that is, simple
technology but sophisticated
theory. And I should say that
we're not a 'labor-intensive'
method as many people have
said we are. It's actually 'skill
intensive.' Bed preparation
may be the hardest job of the
method but once the soil is in
good shape and using a new
device that they've developed
in Canada, it should be possi
ble to prepare a bed in five to
10 minutes.
"All the resources that we
need to raise food right are av
ailable— we're just using them
in the wrong way. Take wheat
production, for example.
Normally to produce more
grain you have to use a lot
more fertilizer. For instance
with corn, from 1940 to 1960,
the nitrogen fertilizer use in
creased 10-fold, but the yields
only doubled. So your fertilizer
effectiveness was only one
fifth as good in 1960 as it was in
1940. Well, we cut our nitrogen
fertilizer use in one year to
one-half and the yield dou
bled. At the same time the pro
tein content increased. It went
from 14.8 percent to 15.7.
Normally when your yields go
up, your protein content per
pound of food goes down. Plus
we used less water and less
energy, less phosphorous and
less potash.
"Eventually, if we get all the
projections that we expect to
get, we'll be producing as
much food per hour as people
with machines can produce. So
this makes the individual im

portant again and gives the in
dividual a choice.
"I should stress that we've
got a ways to go yet. We don't
have a perfect system. We have
failures; we haven't reached all
our projections, but we've had
a lot of good results too.
"Right now, we think if the
method has an Achilles heel, it
will be in the net flow of or
ganic matter in and out of the
soil. We may have to face the
possibility that with the yields
we're now getting, we'll
exhaust the soil in a few more
years. The most important
thing about an agricultural
method is whether it is sustain
able in an environmentally ba
lanced way. The Chinese have
been able for hundreds of
years to grow twice as much
food as the United States does
now. And by using manual, or
ganic techniques and fertiliz
ers grown or produced on their
farms. But we may have to face
the possibility that our sustain
able yield level will be less than
our optimum yield level."
Jeavons turned away from
the potato bed and regarded
me fora moment, as if to make
sure I had understood every
thing up to that point. After tak
ing a deep breath, he turned
and pointed to a pair of
plastic-covered structures
which were, evidently,
greenhouses. One was very
similar in appearance to a con
ventional greenhouse but the
other one was only three feet
high and just covered one
hundred-square-foot bed.
"Now with these miniature
greenhouses," Jeavons said,
"a 12-month growing season is
possible in most climates
where food is grown. What this
means is you could grow your
total diet on as little as 1250
square feet working as little as
15 minutes a day." He walked
to the center of the area and
spread his arms. "That's this
much," he said, his tone imply
ing how little he thought 1250
square feet to be. I was a little
incredulous for a moment be
cause the space he indicated
really seemed no larger than
the average living room. But
then I remembered that an
acre is somewhat more than
40,000 square feet. I had no
trouble believing that the de
signated area was about a thir
tieth of an acre. "And, he said,
with a smile, "even though it's
too early to say on the record,
we expect to go much, much
lower than that to grow a total
diet."

In 1840 the German chemist
Justus von Liebig published a
paper entitled "Chemistry in
its application to agriculture
and physiology." This event,
giving birth to a whole new ap •
proach to the cultivation of
food — which I will call "chem
ical agriculture" — intruded
into the gradual evolution of
farming with all the virulence
of a malignant tumor.
It is true that relatively little
change had taken place in ag
riculture since the dawn of
civilization — 4000 years or

more if one goes back to the
Chinese farmers mentioned by
Jeavons; it is true that during
the period in which chemical
agriculture was developed in
earnest — from the 1880s to the
1920s — the world's population
was growing at a heretofore
unimaginable rate; and it is
true that many well
intentioned people saw in
chemical agriculture the only
means of putting food in the
staggering number of new and
hungry mouths.
It is also true, however, that
concurrent with the rise of
chemical agriculture were the
several great strides outlined
by Jeavons — the strides which
developed in a relatively short
time into the biodynamic-
French intensive method. As
chemical agriculture
burgeoned into an industry
and an orthodoxy, men such as
Rudolf Steiner — and he was
far from alone — recognized
the folly of abandoning
methods proven over millenia
for new and untried
techniques. On the next occa
sion on which I met with
jeavons, I asked him what he
believed were the causes for
the headlong rush toward
chemicals in the face of saner
councils.
"Well, part of the reason,"
he said, "was that as chemical
fertilizers came into play, trac
tors were being developed and
brought into use on many
farms. This made it possible to
spread chemical fertilizer very
easily. It was less time
consuming than spreading
manures. Also, with the tractor
you were able to farm large
areas. Even though it wasn't in
tensive, you could farm a large
area and produce a lot of food
in a very short time. The prom
ise of opening up increased ac
reage was very seductive. To
most people, two to four times
the area meant two to four
times the food. On the other
hand, the French intensive cul
ture that was developed out
side Paris required an awful lot
of people per acre. So with
everyone getting caught up in
the petrochemical
mechanized revolution, the
tendency was to equate 'faster'
with 'more and better.' Which
for a short time was probably
true. But if we get into today's
period, the petrochemicals are
getting more expensive so
spending more time and labor
to get the same amount of food
isn't as unappealing as it used
to be. But more important, I

believe,
from the
perspective
of our re
search, is
that we be
lieve we're
going to be
able to
produce as
much food
per hour as
a machine
can — by
hand. The
way that
we're going
to be able
to do this is
by thinking
about

what's been done in the past,
about what's being done cur
rently, and maximizing the
simplicity which produces the
time efficiency."
During the course of the last
half century, many of the
spokesmen for non-chemical
agriculture have found them
selves ostracized for their be
liefs and techniques. At best
they have been ignored by the
academic and political estab
lishment, at worst they have
been actively harassed and
obstructed in presenting their
cases before the public. One of


these men, Sir Albert Howard,
an Imperial Botanist for the In
dian government, "did some
fantastic things," according to
Jeavons. "Everyone had told
him he couldn't grow cotton
organically in India because
the pests would eat it up. It
took him a while but at the end
of five years, he was growing
cotton organically — with no
pesticides. He had less crop
loss than the people who were
using pesticides."
Although knighted for this
and other accomplishments,
Howard received so much pub
lic ridicule — both from fer-

tilizer in
dustry
spokesmen
and his fel
low scien
tists — that
his ideas
went
widely un
heeded.
Howard
wrote, after

addressing one particularly
nonreceptive audience of
botanists, "Here again I was
amazed by the limited know
ledge and experience of the
world's agriculturalists dis
closed by this debate. I felt I
was dealing with beginners
and that some of the argu
ments put forward could al
most be described as the im
pertinences of ignorance."
In this country, the case of
|.l. Rodale, whose publications
are among the standard refer
ences for a large segment of
the organic farming popula
tion, is not unusual. Rodale
was forced to spend almost a
quarter of a million dollars in
legal fees to win a court deci
sion over the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission which had
blocked the publication of his
book "The Health Finder."
I asked )eavons whether he
thought these examples indi
cated the presence of an estab
lishment which had a vested in
terest in the development and
maintenance of chemical ag
riculture irrespective of the
best interests of mankind. It
was true, he said, that
"businessmen are always
ready to take advantage of a
good thing and push it to the
fullest," but there were proba
bly "two separate thrusts" —
business incentives and desire
for greater efficiency — which
"then became merged."
leavons then related an in
teresting anecdote, most of
which had to remain off the re
cord, which was a telling
statement about the present
state of agricultural research.
"It was amazing to me," he
said, "that agricultural schools
are not more interested in re
search like that (Howard's),
and in trying to replicate it — at
least as an alternative ap
proach. I wrote a letter to an
individual who was involved in
agricultural research at a col
lege here in California. I told
him I was confused. In the light
of some of the possibilities we
were uncovering with the
biodynamic-French intensive
method, why wasn't anyone
investigating our results. He
wrote me back a very good let
ter. He indicated that the re
search money is coming from
thechemical industriesand the
agricultural interests. They
have an interest in using the
system they've already got.
And again, their purpose is
making money from it, not
necessarily making it better. So
you see, the professors almost
have to ridicule alternative
methods. If they go into other
areas, they become profes
sionally ostracized and they
can't get funds."
leavons continued with
another anecdote, this time
regarding a conference about
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method which was held

last year in Santa Barbara. Sev
eral members of the American
Society of Agronomy had at
tended, he said, and had asked
questions about the
mechanisms of the improved
plant growth. "If we couldn't
tell them exactly how it was
happening, in their terms and
language, they wouldn't give it
very much credence. Someone
pointed out that the Romans
knew how to make concrete a
long time before anyone knew
why it worked. There's a kind
of scientific myopia here. It's
like they're saying, you can
only be scientific if you're sci
entific in the way in which we
are scientific. Well, good lord,
if someone's demonstrating
that something is possible,
anyone who's really an open
minded scientist ought to be
excited and interested to find
out why it's possible. But there
aren't any funds for them to do
it."
leavons is not alone in his
observation of "scientific
myopia" in the present
academic community. In April,
1973, Nicholas Wade reported
in Science magazine that "a
blue-ribbon committee of
basic and agricultural scien
tists" found that "the basic re
search performed by federal
and state agricultural research
organizations is of meager
quality, suffers from a 'shock
ing lack of intellectual leader
ship' and is guided by policies
detrimental to the interests of
agriculture."
Although no reference was
made to a lack of attention to
any specific area of research,
University of Chicago Biology
Prof. Richard Levins wrote in a
later issue of Science that "the
issues raised by Nicholas
Wade's report have to be set
into a broader context than
simply the policies of the U.S.
Department of Agricul
ture. . . . Within agricultural
science, America's traditional
anti-intellectualism survives as
an antitheoretical bias. . . .It is
reinforced by the search for
marketable products (mostly
chemical) as the central
strategy for improvement of
agriculture . . . and by a nar
row acceptance of the present
structure of agriculture as a
given condition which restricts
options. For example, the con
sideration of mixed plantings is
inhibited by the present design
of farm machinery."
The tone of both articles asks
the question, "Ought we to let
this happen?" The tone taken
increasingly by more and more
far-sighted scientists today,
however, is "Can we afford to
let this happen?" jeavons him
self points to the dwindling
supply of natural gas — the
current reserves of which are
slated to run out in about a de
cade — as one factor which
could lead to an agricultural
disaster. Since the production
of artificial nitrogen fertilizer
has been made almost wholly
dependent on natural gas, he
says, and since there is evi-

dence indi
cating that
nitrogen fi
xation from
the air by
soil bac
teria stops
in the pre
sence of ar
tificial fer
tilizer
which in

turn causes a soil "addiction"
to this form of fertilizer, it
seems likely that we will be
faced with the necessity of
using pollution-producing coal
to satisfy our farmlands'
"habit." And even the coal
supply will someday be
exhausted.
Yet even if the scarcity of
energy were not an issue, the
question would still be a valid
one. In addition to beini:


ecologically unsound, our pre
sent system of food production
is economically and technolog
ically unsatisfactory for a large
segment of the world's popula
tion. As Frances Moore Lappe
and ]oseph Collins de
monstrate in their book, Food
First, the expensive technology
and inflated prices which "ag
ribusiness" and its "global
supermarket" force on unde
veloped nations do as much to
hinder their progress as any
other single factor.
Jeavons' belief is that the
solution to many of the world's
food-related problems —
ecological, economical and
technological — lies in a global
move to small-scale farming. A
February, 1976 paper released
by Ecology Action states that
"the current food shortages
will worsen into a crisis of
global proportions unless the
productivity of the 100 million
small farms in the developing
world is increased dramati
cally. Several key points make
the biodynamic-Fiench inten
sive method especially viable
in countries with limited re
sources: The method does not
require complicated machin
ery or expensive fertilizers.
The key technological element
is the common shovel. The
method uses 1/2 to 1/16 the wa
ter. This will be especially valu
able in arid areas of the world,
or those limited to natural rain
fall. The method provides a
self-sufficient livelihood in
areas of high unemployment.
The method's diversified ap
proach encourages intercrop
ping with local foods, thus of
fering a varied diet. The
method builds a healthy soil,
the key to dependable food
production and the building of
a stable economic and social
system."
And, according to a paper
co-authored by leavons, "The
small farm, all factors consi
dered, is actually a more effi
cient unit of production than
its large-scale counterpart. To
quote Sterling Wortman of the
Rockerfeller Foundation, . .
most large-scale mechanized
agriculture is less productive
per unit area than small scale
farming can be. The farmer on
a small holding can engage in
intensive high yield gardening,
systems such as intercropping,
multiple cropping, relay plant
ing or other techniques that
require attention to individual
plants. The point is that
mechanized agriculture is very
productive in terms of output
per man-year, but it is not as
productive per unit of land as
the highly intensive systems
are.' Much of the economic
advantage large farms now
enjoy is not due to any stream
lining inherent in their size but
in the tax structures and sub
sidies which favor corporate
'tax loss' farming, land specula
tion, and vertical stratification
of the food industry from pro
duction of fertilizers, to farm
ing, to packaging and distribu
tion of food products."
Jeavons is generally unop
timistic

about the
prospects
for a rapid
change
from our
current ag
ricultural
practices,
projecting
50years as a
minimum

before such a transformation
will be started on a large scale.
"The thing that has always con
fused me," he told me, "is why
so few people have asked why
can't we keep the organic,
small-scale simplicity and also
have the sophistication of
modern science. I think one
reason why people don't get
into that too much is because
they're thinking on a closed

system basis — and it gets away
from a growth economy.
There's no audience for this in
this country, very few people
living that kind of lifestyle.
They're not putting their
energy into making it happen.
They're still chasing the growth
economy that is epitomized by
the development of the tractor
and the chemical fertilizers."
Lemmings have at least one
thing to recommend them
over mankind — at least when
they rush to their destruction,
•they do not drag the rest of the
planet with them. But mankind
has at least one thing to re
commend it over lemmings: at
least as it rushes to its destruc
tion, it can see where it is going
and attempt to stop before it is

too late.
It often
seems,
however,
that rather
than at
tempting to
stop our
sprint to
ward an
nihilation,

one part of
our species is actively engaged
in accelerating our progress
while the other part fiddles
marching tunes like a whole
race of carefree Neros. We find
our leaders more concerned
with their own destinies than
those of the people they are
supposed to lead; we find, in
fact, that they seem to have no
awareness of any destiny other
than their own. We find them
structuring our culture for
their own ends, without regard
for any future more distant
than the probable span of their
lives. We find an educational
system which perpetuates
their narrow-sightedness. We
at the summit of our culture
find ourselves in the midst of a
highly-sophisticated,
apparently-benign process
which teaches us to shut our
eyes and go faster.
But then it can not be de
nied: the power of vision has
not left us entirely; there are
those who do stretch their
necks to look around. It is no
doubt painful and traumatic to
take a long look at the destruc
tion which we are cultivating.
But there are, these people tell
us, other views, views as prom
ising as the scene immediately
before us is threatening. And,
hope being what it is, they are
working to divert our rush.
)eavons, obviously, is such a
man. He is not militant, anar
chistic, alienated, alienating or
bitter. As he says, "you don't
really need to change the sys
tem to live a better life."
leavons is just quietly pursuing
his work, doing what he can to
bring about an improvement in
the attitude of our culture.

Grow More Vegetables Than

On Less Land Than You Can

The headquarters of the Syn
tex Corporation is located
on a hillside just west of Footh
ill Expressway, across from
Palo Alto's Veterans Administ
ration Hospital. A large cement
and glass building in the mod
ern architectural style, it sits on
a very green and well-groomed
lawn. At the foot of the hill,
however, literally a stone's
throw away from the
chemical-pharmaceuticals bas
tion, an incongruous sight pre
sents itself: a truck garden, in
the best tradition of truck gar
dens. It is a disorderly collage
of colors and textures — the
lush green of crops and weeds,
the crumbling dark brown of
newly turned earth, the dry
light brown of withered vege
tation, the dusty white sheen
of sheet plastic, the hard lustre
less gray of metal siding.

A casual passerby, observing
the two establishments, would
be likely to see in their proxim
ity the tension which often
exists between the new and
dynamic and the old and static.
Palo Aito, he might surmise, is
in the final stages of a
metamorphosis from the pas
toral to the cosmopolitan; the
garden, a quaint anachronism,
will soon be the site of yet
another corporate headquar
ters and the cement and glass
building on the hillside will ac
quire, by comparison, an air of
establishment and seniority.

Such is not the case, how
ever. Quite to the contrary, the
cement and glass building
antedates the garden; the land
on which the garden is located
is owned by the corporation
and worked by the garden's
proprietors under the terms of
a rent-free lease; the operation
of the garden is partially sub
sidized, with virtually no return
obligations, by the corpora
tion's donation, in addition to
the land, of water and funds. It
is an unusual situation, but it is
an unusual truck garden.
Foods ranging from grains to
fruit to beans to vegetables are
under cultivation there. The
yield of any given foodstuff at
any given harvest time typically
ranges from two to 31 times the
national, California or Santa
Clara County average
(whichever is higher). From
one-half to one-sixteenth the
average amount of water per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. From one-half to
one-sixteenth the average
amount of nitrogen fertilizer
per pound of food produced is
typically used. About one
one-hundredth the energy per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. No "chemical" fer
tilizer is used. Mo pesticides of
any type are used. No machin
ery more sophisticated than a
simple wheelbarrow is used.
And it is not uncommon to see
men and women in business
dress entering or leaving the
garden or engaged in some
phase of agriculture.
Despite these arresting facts,
the garden and its proprietors
remain surprisingly anonym
ous. Perhaps it is the
previously-described undis
tinguished character of the
former, or maybe it is the
quiet, unassuming style of the
latter. It may even be that it has
less to do with either the
former or latter than the nature
of the rest of the world. What
ever the case, it would be a
poor bet indeed to wager that
that anonymity is to be pre
served for very much longer.
Although I have been in
terested in food in general
and gardening in specific for
much of my life, the terms
"biodynamic" and "French in
tensive" remained obscure to
me until I made the acquain
tance of John leavons. An
alumnus of Yale and former
head of Business Services for
the Stanford library system,
leavons currently wields the

ponderous title of Director of
Agricultural Research for Ecol
ogy Action of the Midpenin
sula.
It is largely Jeavons who is
responsible for the present
shape — in both a physLal and
an abstract sense — of the ag
ricultural program underway
on the three and three-quarter
acre plot of Syntex land. It was
Jeavons who, after making a
study on his own initiative of
United Nations iand use and

population
figures, be
came con
vinced that
the planet
was still
capable of
feeding all
her in
habitants;
it was he
who, after
attending a
seminar on
the agricul
tural
techniques

synthesized by the Englishman
Alan Chadwick, sought out the
master horticulturalist in his
barren hillside-turned Garden
of Eden at the University of
California at Santa Cruz; it was
Jeavons who, after talking at
length with Chadwick, prop
osed the idea of a combined
research and community gar
den to the board of directors of
Ecology Action, a Palo Alto
conservation group which had
won recognition for a success
ful city-wide recycling prog-

ram; it was he who, after con
vincing them of the viability
and significance of such a
program, proceeded to as
semble the elements of Com
mon Ground — land, funds,
people — and embark on a
course of rigorous scientific
research.
The program is now in its
sixth year. Each succeeding
year has, according to Jeavons,
confirmed his faith in Chad
wick's techniques, known now
as the biodynamic-French in
tensive method.
When I first spoke with
leavons, I had a vague recollec
tion of a chapter in a gardening
book which had described a
"labor-intensive" system of
farming which allowed the
densely-populated countries
of western Europe to grow
much food on little land. This, I
imagined, was related to
"French-intensive" farming. In
his articulate and methodical
way, Jeavons soon clarified and
expanded this conception —
and made me realize how large
a topic this form of agriculture
had become.
"The method we're using
now," he said, "is made up of
two techniques that were de
veloped in Europe around the
turn of the century. The French
intensive method is one—that
reached its culmination in the
1890s outside Paris. What it did
was it raised vegetables in beds
that consisted of 18 inches of
horse manure — which was re
ally plentiful at the time. Be
cause of this high level of or
ganic matter and the fertility it
created, as well as the great
depth of loose material, roots
were able to grow downward
instead of needing room to
grow out horizontally. So they
were able to use very close
spacing."
This simple concept, leavons
continued, accounts for a sig
nificant part of the increased
yields which the method pro
duces. As jeavons phrased it in
a research report summarizing
Common Ground's first four
years, "A simple 24-inch deep
soil preparation allows the

plants to be spaced more
closely so that their leaves
touch or almost touch. . . .
This factor alone would make
fourfold yields possible be
cause four times as many
plants as usual can be planted
in a given area."
"The other technique,"
Jeavons told me, "was the
biodynamic technique. It was
developed in the 1920s by
Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian
genius who was into educa
tion, philosophy, religion, and
agriculture. The French inten
sive method had been de
veloped over hundreds of
years by French marchiers or
gardeners. The biodynamic
method, though, was de
veloped by Steiner in the late
'20s fora lot of wealthy German
farmers who had noticed that
their yields were going down
and they were getting more in
sect and disease problems. It
turned out they had been using
chemical fertilizers. Urea, a
kind of artifical nitrogen, had
been developed in the late
1880s. Steiner traced their
problems to the chemical fer
tilizers and suggested that they
return to some of their old
methods and adopt five special
practices. These practices be
camethe biodynamic method.
"One was the use of raised
beds — beds only 12 inches
deep prepared by raking soil
out of the path. This was going
back to the Greeks who found
out that plants grew better in
landslides. The raised beds as
they came to be dug were like
little, artificial landslides. The
reasons the plants do better in
them is because the soil is
looser and there's more air or
gases in it — you need up to 50
percent gases for good plant
growth."
jeavons frequently uses the
verb "dovetail" to describe
areas where two concepts in
termesh or compliment each
other. The deep soil prepara
tion and close spacing of the
French intensive method
dovetails, he said, with the "ar
tificial landslides" of the
biodynamic method to pro

duce healthier, more produc
tive plants.
"There was a study in the '50s
at the University of California
at Berkeley," he said, "that
showed that if you improved
root health by two to four per
cent for most common field
crops you could increase the
yields by 200 to 400 percent.
One of the things which can
make this possible is better soil
preparation and aeration. With
our method, you have more air
in the soil, more surface area
for contact between soil and air
since a raised bed has a curved
surface and also more surface
area to absorb rain or watering
and warmth from the sun. And
the curved surface also allows
you to increase the planting
area by 20 percent. Say you
have a plot of land that's a
hundred square feet and you
make it a raised bed, you can
wind up with 120 square feet of
planting area.
"The second technique that
Steiner recommended, after
the raised beds — which inci
dentally may even have gone
back even before the Greeks to
the Chinese, possibly 4000
years ago — was the use of or
ganic fertilizers. Chemical fer
tilizers at the time were mainly
just nitrogen or nitrogen and
phosphorous. They weren't
balanced or complete; they
needed trace minerals and
potash. Also the chemical fer
tilizers broke down very
quickly and harmed the texture
and structure of the soil and
killed the microbiotic life and

so forth. So Steiner asked the
German farmers to return to
organic fertilizers that were
more balanced and diverse —
like fish meal which has nitro
gen, phosphorous and trace
mi nerals and breaks down over
a period of six months instead
of four to six weeks.
"The third technique was
companion planting. There
were a lot of folk myths about
what things to grow well to
gether. Steiner tried to scienti
fically investigate this through
such techniques as
chromatography and crystalli
zation and field testing to de
termine which plants grown
together would do better. For
instance, one part chamomile
grown with two hundred parts
of wheat increases the health
and yield of wheat. But if its
one to one, one part
chamomile grown with one
part wheat, the wheat will be
destroyed, or at least seriously
harmed.
"Another technique was the
use of herbal sprays. At one
point they were almost a cult.
You take stinging nettles, for
example, and you do some
thing like — I can't remember
exactly — bury it three feet
under the ground at a certain
conjunction of the plants and
leave it under there for six
months and dig it up and mix it
in with a water solution and
then spray it on the ground. It's
supposed to stimulate the
micorobiotic life of the soil
which helps the plants. Really
far out, really unusual, but it
works.
"And the fifth thing was
planting by the phases of the
moon. The rationale for this
comes from seeing the moon's
effect on oceans — daily tides
of up to 40 feet in some parts of
the world. There's water in the
ground, in seeds and in plants
so it seems there might be a
small effect there.
"So those were the two
threads — the French intensive
method and Steiner's five
biodynamic techniques.
"Now, Chadwick, who is, I
think, a horticultural genius,

certainly a horticultural artist,
put these two techniques to
gether sometime between the
1930s and the 1960s when he
came to Santa Cruz. He had
been severely exasperated by
the second world war. A
woman named Freiavon Molka
and he got together and de
cided that one of the best ways
to bring peace and life and
harmony back into the world
was through gardens. Chad
wick had studied under the
French marchiers and he had
studied under Steiner. He's
had over 50 years of experience
in raising food. He also worked
under George Bernard Shaw in
drama, he's a painter, an actor,
an incredible individual — very
dramatic in his presentation of
things.
"When he put the two farm
ing techniques together, he
simplified them. Where
Steiner would make herbal
preparations, Chadwick would
just grow the herb, the stinging
nettle say, in the bed and then
put it in the compost pile and
let it have a living kind of influ
ence. Instead of using dead
mulches he used living mulch
— when the plants are so close
together that their leaves just
about touch, the ground is
shaded, moisture is con
served, a micro-climate is
created. So his whole orienta
tion is using living plants and
giving to nature as much as she
produces and even a little
more. If you give to nature
more than she gives you, she
will continually provide you
with abundance.
"So Chadwick prepares his
beds 24 inches deep, not just
18, he uses compost mainly
from vegetable matter, he uses
very little manure — in contrast
with the French and in contrast
with the other biodynamic
people who sometimes use a
lot of manure. This is important
worldwide because one-third
of the world's people now have
a different kind of energy
crisis: they don't have enough
firewood. So like in India,
they're burning the manure
from animals to heat their
homes and to cook their food.
There's a fertilizer shortage
there. But you don't need the
manure under Chadwick's
technique; most of it is veget
able compost, as I said.
"So he uses 24-inch-deep
soil preparation; close spac
ing; comparatively speaking, a
vegetarian or quasi-vegetarian
compost that's two-thirds veg
etable matter, one-third soil;
he uses living herbs rather than
herbal sprays, generally; he
uses some organic fertilizers,
mainly bone meal but not
much else; and he plants by
the phases of the moon."
/ / K| ow we started re-
searching the method
in 1972. Our purposes were
twofold. One was to document
how the method was done — it
had never been documented
in written form because Chad
wick doesn't believe in the
written word but by handing
things down by example and
by word of mouth, master to
apprentice and so forth. Also it
had been reputed that the
method produced four times
the average yield, but this had
never been documented one
way or another.
"The lot Syntex gave us had a
soil which was one-third rock
— meaning pebbles and stuff.
Normal agricultural soil is
maybe five percent rock, not 33
percent. In addition, our soil
was over one-third clay. There
was no nitrogen fertilizer in the
soil and just a trace of phos
phorous and potash.
"During our first five years
we got very encouraging re
sults — yields which ranged
anywhere from two to 16 times
the U.S., Santa Clara County or
California averages. Then in
1976, I developed a new

technique called 'superdig
ging' which is a sort of a super
texturizing technique. This
technique improves the soil
more rapidly. It takes up to five
years using normal techniques
to improve the soil. Re
member, we were in subsoil
clay with no top soil at all. As a
result of this new technique,
this year we've gone as high as
about 60 times the Santa Clara
County average with zucchini
using about two percent of the
water per pound of food pro
duced and one percent of the
added nitrogen fertilizer per
pound of food produced. In
the case of grain, we're as high
as two and a quarter times the
national average on soybeans,

double on
wheat and
expect to
go six to
eight times
for those
yields.
Also, we
expect to
be using
one third to
one-eighth
the water
per pound
of grain
produced
— and that
could be
significant
because it
means you

could be getting very high
grain yields with as little as
eight or 10 inches of rainfall.
Over 75 percent of the arable
area of the world has 10 or
more inches of rainfall.
"An interesting thing is that
the Zulus of South Africa use a
similar technique — similar to
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method, that is, that they
developed on their own. It's a
triple-digging technique, lust
before it rains they prepare the
soil three feet deep and as
soon as it does rain they plant
their grain. It doesn't rain all
summer and is very dry. They
grow grain when no one else
can grow grain anywhere. So
here's a similar technique
that's working under natural
rainfall conditions.
"What this means is that if
we reach all of our projections,
we would be getting an aver
age of four to eight times on
vegetables and six to eight
times the average yield on
grain. And these yields, by the
way are already being obtained
somewhere else in the world
on the average — and on a
large scale basis. A way to high
light this is to say that for every
major crop grown in the Un
ited States, some other country
in the world on the average is
getting a yield about twice as
high. So U.S. agriculture,
though it may look good, is not
the best with all crops."
One morning soon after our
first conversation, I met
Jeavons for a tour of the Com
mon Ground garden. He is
plainly in his element there. A
fairly large man in his mid-30s
he sports an incipient pot belly
and a voluminous though
well-behaved beard. He was
dressed in mud-spattered
work pants, a heavy flannel
shirt and a sweat-stained
leather cap. He generally main
tains a serious demeanor al
though when he smiles he re
veals a considerable capacity
for simple delight. His eyes
especially, manifest his posi
tive attitude: whether engaged
in a visual analysis of crop
progress, gazing at clouds in
the distance or glancing at his
auditor, they are intelligent,
energetic, unusually alive.
He took me first to some
thing he called an "herbal
lawn." From a distance, this
looked similar to a grass lawn
— green and flat. Standing next
to it, however, I saw that its

color was not uniform. In
terspersed among the light
green of sweet clover were
plants of darker shades —
identified by Jeavons as Roman
chamomile, creeping thyme
and dwarf yarrow. In addition
to being "simple and beauti
ful," Jeavons said, the lawn
fixes nitrogen in the soil and
concentrates phosphorous
and potash in its leaves. It is
thus beneficial to the soil on
which it is grown and can be
mown as a source of
nutriment-rich compost.
For the next hour we looked
at such things as newly-planted
fruit trees, fragrant and useful
herbs, fallow planting beds,
freshly-prepared planting

beds, planting beds overflow
ing with mature vegetables and
legumes, and recently har
vested planting beds. All the
while Jeavons kept up an in
teresting commentary filled
with odd facts and anecdotes.
"You see those nicely dug beds
over there?" he asked at one
point. "Those were prepared
by a 65-year-old woman with a
heart condition."
Finally, he led me to a
fenced-off area with a pad
locked gate. "This is the re
search garden," he said.
"What we've been looking at is
the community garden. People
from all over, including about
five to 10 percent of all the Syn
tex employees, are involved
with raising food here."
Inside the research garden
were rows of beds each about
six feet wide and 20 feet long. I
was slightly disappointed by
the modest dimensions of the
whole garden — smaller than
that occupied by the average
house — since it seemed that
something larger would be re
quired for such significant re
search.
"This area is about 2500
square feet," Jeavons said as if
reading my thoughts. "Our re
search indicates that a com
pletely balanced diet could be
grown on this much space —
and with as little as a half hour
of work a day. The same
amount of food, if it were
grown by U.S. chemical,
mechanized techniques would
take 10,000 square feet. In In
dia, the same diet would take
32,000 square feet.
"Now, the average American
eats 322 pounds of vegetables
and soft fruits — fruits like
strawberries, cantalopes and
watermelon — a year. Two
hundred and twenty of those
pounds are potatoes. You can
grow that amount of vegeta
bles with the biodynamic-
French intensive method in 100
square feet in a four to six
month growing season. In the
case of fruit trees, you can put
two of them in a hundred
square foot bed on eight foot
centers. Each of those fruit
trees should produce a
hundred pounds of hard fruit
per year and the average
American eats 162 pounds of
hard fruit a year. It should take
you maybe a half a minute to a
minute a day to take care of the
trees on an average basis and it
should take you about five to
10 minutes a day to take care of

the vegetable bed.
"So what we're talking about
is eventually people can start
raising a fair amount of their
food just in their back yard. A
family of four, in 400 square
feet, could raise in a four to six
month growing season food
worth $480 in five to 10 minutes
a day each. Their labor would
then be worth $4 to $8 an hour.
Now a person is probably not
going to do this the first year if
he's never gardened before,
but he's going to do a lot better
than he's done with other
techniques. What this means
for overseas, for India, for
example, where they have fer
tilizer shortages, energy shor
tages, water shortages and
food shortages, is that in a
small area, say 2500 to 7000
square feet they could raise
their total diet rather than in
32,000 square feet. So small is
beautiful: in this country, de
escalation of technology; for
overseas, a move to more self
sufficiency."
We moved to a bed with
some dried leaves and with
ered stalks in it which I recog
nized as potatoes, leavons
went on.
"Now in monetary terms,
with potatoes, we're now at
four times the national average
but we expect to go much
higher— maybe well above 20.
We're still experimenting with
that. I can't tell you on the re
cord how high we expect to go
but I can say on the record it's
over 20. With zucchini, when
we got only 16 times the Santa
Clara county average, the bed
produced $12.50 an hour — or
would have if we'd sold it all at
the wholesale rate. Now that
we're up to 60, we're talking
about producing three times
that or $37.50 an hour. This is
an extreme case but it should
be possible to earn a minimum
of $4 an hour just raising your
own vegetables.
"We're guessing that a new
kind of job or profession will
come out of all of this — mini
farming. We estimate that it
will be possible for one person
working a 40-hour week to
raise $15,000 net on as little as a
quarter of an acre. Currently
small farmers with farms of 200
to4oo acres are lucky if they net
several thousand dollars.
"So our philosophy is one of
low techonology, that is, simple
technology but sophisticated
theory. And I should say that
we're not a 'labor-intensive'
method as many people have
said we are. It's actually 'skill
intensive.' Bed preparation
may be the hardest job of the
method but once the soil is in
good shape and using a new
device that they've developed
in Canada, it should be possi
ble to prepare a bed in five to
10 minutes.
"All the resources that we
need to raise food right are av
ailable— we're just using them
in the wrong way. Take wheat
production, for example.
Normally to produce more
grain you have to use a lot
more fertilizer. For instance
with corn, from 1940 to 1960,
the nitrogen fertilizer use in
creased 10-fold, but the yields
only doubled. So your fertilizer
effectiveness was only one
fifth as good in 1960 as it was in
1940. Well, we cut our nitrogen
fertilizer use in one year to
one-half and the yield dou
bled. At the same time the pro
tein content increased. It went
from 14.8 percent to 15.7.
Normally when your yields go
up, your protein content per
pound of food goes down. Plus
we used less water and less
energy, less phosphorous and
less potash.
"Eventually, if we get all the
projections that we expect to
get, we'll be producing as
much food per hour as people
with machines can produce. So
this makes the individual im

portant again and gives the in
dividual a choice.
"I should stress that we've
got a ways to go yet. We don't
have a perfect system. We have
failures; we haven't reached all
our projections, but we've had
a lot of good results too.
"Right now, we think if the
method has an Achilles heel, it
will be in the net flow of or
ganic matter in and out of the
soil. We may have to face the
possibility that with the yields
we're now getting, we'll
exhaust the soil in a few more
years. The most important
thing about an agricultural
method is whether it is sustain
able in an environmentally ba
lanced way. The Chinese have
been able for hundreds of
years to grow twice as much
food as the United States does
now. And by using manual, or
ganic techniques and fertiliz
ers grown or produced on their
farms. But we may have to face
the possibility that our sustain
able yield level will be less than
our optimum yield level."
Jeavons turned away from
the potato bed and regarded
me fora moment, as if to make
sure I had understood every
thing up to that point. After tak
ing a deep breath, he turned
and pointed to a pair of
plastic-covered structures
which were, evidently,
greenhouses. One was very
similar in appearance to a con
ventional greenhouse but the
other one was only three feet
high and just covered one
hundred-square-foot bed.
"Now with these miniature
greenhouses," Jeavons said,
"a 12-month growing season is
possible in most climates
where food is grown. What this
means is you could grow your
total diet on as little as 1250
square feet working as little as
15 minutes a day." He walked
to the center of the area and
spread his arms. "That's this
much," he said, his tone imply
ing how little he thought 1250
square feet to be. I was a little
incredulous for a moment be
cause the space he indicated
really seemed no larger than
the average living room. But
then I remembered that an
acre is somewhat more than
40,000 square feet. I had no
trouble believing that the de
signated area was about a thir
tieth of an acre. "And, he said,
with a smile, "even though it's
too early to say on the record,
we expect to go much, much
lower than that to grow a total
diet."

In 1840 the German chemist
Justus von Liebig published a
paper entitled "Chemistry in
its application to agriculture
and physiology." This event,
giving birth to a whole new ap •
proach to the cultivation of
food — which I will call "chem
ical agriculture" — intruded
into the gradual evolution of
farming with all the virulence
of a malignant tumor.
It is true that relatively little
change had taken place in ag
riculture since the dawn of
civilization — 4000 years or

more if one goes back to the
Chinese farmers mentioned by
Jeavons; it is true that during
the period in which chemical
agriculture was developed in
earnest — from the 1880s to the
1920s — the world's population
was growing at a heretofore
unimaginable rate; and it is
true that many well
intentioned people saw in
chemical agriculture the only
means of putting food in the
staggering number of new and
hungry mouths.
It is also true, however, that
concurrent with the rise of
chemical agriculture were the
several great strides outlined
by Jeavons — the strides which
developed in a relatively short
time into the biodynamic-
French intensive method. As
chemical agriculture
burgeoned into an industry
and an orthodoxy, men such as
Rudolf Steiner — and he was
far from alone — recognized
the folly of abandoning
methods proven over millenia
for new and untried
techniques. On the next occa
sion on which I met with
jeavons, I asked him what he
believed were the causes for
the headlong rush toward
chemicals in the face of saner
councils.
"Well, part of the reason,"
he said, "was that as chemical
fertilizers came into play, trac
tors were being developed and
brought into use on many
farms. This made it possible to
spread chemical fertilizer very
easily. It was less time
consuming than spreading
manures. Also, with the tractor
you were able to farm large
areas. Even though it wasn't in
tensive, you could farm a large
area and produce a lot of food
in a very short time. The prom
ise of opening up increased ac
reage was very seductive. To
most people, two to four times
the area meant two to four
times the food. On the other
hand, the French intensive cul
ture that was developed out
side Paris required an awful lot
of people per acre. So with
everyone getting caught up in
the petrochemical
mechanized revolution, the
tendency was to equate 'faster'
with 'more and better.' Which
for a short time was probably
true. But if we get into today's
period, the petrochemicals are
getting more expensive so
spending more time and labor
to get the same amount of food
isn't as unappealing as it used
to be. But more important, I

believe,
from the
perspective
of our re
search, is
that we be
lieve we're
going to be
able to
produce as
much food
per hour as
a machine
can — by
hand. The
way that
we're going
to be able
to do this is
by thinking
about

what's been done in the past,
about what's being done cur
rently, and maximizing the
simplicity which produces the
time efficiency."
During the course of the last
half century, many of the
spokesmen for non-chemical
agriculture have found them
selves ostracized for their be
liefs and techniques. At best
they have been ignored by the
academic and political estab
lishment, at worst they have
been actively harassed and
obstructed in presenting their
cases before the public. One of


these men, Sir Albert Howard,
an Imperial Botanist for the In
dian government, "did some
fantastic things," according to
Jeavons. "Everyone had told
him he couldn't grow cotton
organically in India because
the pests would eat it up. It
took him a while but at the end
of five years, he was growing
cotton organically — with no
pesticides. He had less crop
loss than the people who were
using pesticides."
Although knighted for this
and other accomplishments,
Howard received so much pub
lic ridicule — both from fer-

tilizer in
dustry
spokesmen
and his fel
low scien
tists — that
his ideas
went
widely un
heeded.
Howard
wrote, after

addressing one particularly
nonreceptive audience of
botanists, "Here again I was
amazed by the limited know
ledge and experience of the
world's agriculturalists dis
closed by this debate. I felt I
was dealing with beginners
and that some of the argu
ments put forward could al
most be described as the im
pertinences of ignorance."
In this country, the case of
|.l. Rodale, whose publications
are among the standard refer
ences for a large segment of
the organic farming popula
tion, is not unusual. Rodale
was forced to spend almost a
quarter of a million dollars in
legal fees to win a court deci
sion over the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission which had
blocked the publication of his
book "The Health Finder."
I asked )eavons whether he
thought these examples indi
cated the presence of an estab
lishment which had a vested in
terest in the development and
maintenance of chemical ag
riculture irrespective of the
best interests of mankind. It
was true, he said, that
"businessmen are always
ready to take advantage of a
good thing and push it to the
fullest," but there were proba
bly "two separate thrusts" —
business incentives and desire
for greater efficiency — which
"then became merged."
leavons then related an in
teresting anecdote, most of
which had to remain off the re
cord, which was a telling
statement about the present
state of agricultural research.
"It was amazing to me," he
said, "that agricultural schools
are not more interested in re
search like that (Howard's),
and in trying to replicate it — at
least as an alternative ap
proach. I wrote a letter to an
individual who was involved in
agricultural research at a col
lege here in California. I told
him I was confused. In the light
of some of the possibilities we
were uncovering with the
biodynamic-French intensive
method, why wasn't anyone
investigating our results. He
wrote me back a very good let
ter. He indicated that the re
search money is coming from
thechemical industriesand the
agricultural interests. They
have an interest in using the
system they've already got.
And again, their purpose is
making money from it, not
necessarily making it better. So
you see, the professors almost
have to ridicule alternative
methods. If they go into other
areas, they become profes
sionally ostracized and they
can't get funds."
leavons continued with
another anecdote, this time
regarding a conference about
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method which was held

last year in Santa Barbara. Sev
eral members of the American
Society of Agronomy had at
tended, he said, and had asked
questions about the
mechanisms of the improved
plant growth. "If we couldn't
tell them exactly how it was
happening, in their terms and
language, they wouldn't give it
very much credence. Someone
pointed out that the Romans
knew how to make concrete a
long time before anyone knew
why it worked. There's a kind
of scientific myopia here. It's
like they're saying, you can
only be scientific if you're sci
entific in the way in which we
are scientific. Well, good lord,
if someone's demonstrating
that something is possible,
anyone who's really an open
minded scientist ought to be
excited and interested to find
out why it's possible. But there
aren't any funds for them to do
it."
leavons is not alone in his
observation of "scientific
myopia" in the present
academic community. In April,
1973, Nicholas Wade reported
in Science magazine that "a
blue-ribbon committee of
basic and agricultural scien
tists" found that "the basic re
search performed by federal
and state agricultural research
organizations is of meager
quality, suffers from a 'shock
ing lack of intellectual leader
ship' and is guided by policies
detrimental to the interests of
agriculture."
Although no reference was
made to a lack of attention to
any specific area of research,
University of Chicago Biology
Prof. Richard Levins wrote in a
later issue of Science that "the
issues raised by Nicholas
Wade's report have to be set
into a broader context than
simply the policies of the U.S.
Department of Agricul
ture. . . . Within agricultural
science, America's traditional
anti-intellectualism survives as
an antitheoretical bias. . . .It is
reinforced by the search for
marketable products (mostly
chemical) as the central
strategy for improvement of
agriculture . . . and by a nar
row acceptance of the present
structure of agriculture as a
given condition which restricts
options. For example, the con
sideration of mixed plantings is
inhibited by the present design
of farm machinery."
The tone of both articles asks
the question, "Ought we to let
this happen?" The tone taken
increasingly by more and more
far-sighted scientists today,
however, is "Can we afford to
let this happen?" jeavons him
self points to the dwindling
supply of natural gas — the
current reserves of which are
slated to run out in about a de
cade — as one factor which
could lead to an agricultural
disaster. Since the production
of artificial nitrogen fertilizer
has been made almost wholly
dependent on natural gas, he
says, and since there is evi-

dence indi
cating that
nitrogen fi
xation from
the air by
soil bac
teria stops
in the pre
sence of ar
tificial fer
tilizer
which in

turn causes a soil "addiction"
to this form of fertilizer, it
seems likely that we will be
faced with the necessity of
using pollution-producing coal
to satisfy our farmlands'
"habit." And even the coal
supply will someday be
exhausted.
Yet even if the scarcity of
energy were not an issue, the
question would still be a valid
one. In addition to beini:


ecologically unsound, our pre
sent system of food production
is economically and technolog
ically unsatisfactory for a large
segment of the world's popula
tion. As Frances Moore Lappe
and ]oseph Collins de
monstrate in their book, Food
First, the expensive technology
and inflated prices which "ag
ribusiness" and its "global
supermarket" force on unde
veloped nations do as much to
hinder their progress as any
other single factor.
Jeavons' belief is that the
solution to many of the world's
food-related problems —
ecological, economical and
technological — lies in a global
move to small-scale farming. A
February, 1976 paper released
by Ecology Action states that
"the current food shortages
will worsen into a crisis of
global proportions unless the
productivity of the 100 million
small farms in the developing
world is increased dramati
cally. Several key points make
the biodynamic-Fiench inten
sive method especially viable
in countries with limited re
sources: The method does not
require complicated machin
ery or expensive fertilizers.
The key technological element
is the common shovel. The
method uses 1/2 to 1/16 the wa
ter. This will be especially valu
able in arid areas of the world,
or those limited to natural rain
fall. The method provides a
self-sufficient livelihood in
areas of high unemployment.
The method's diversified ap
proach encourages intercrop
ping with local foods, thus of
fering a varied diet. The
method builds a healthy soil,
the key to dependable food
production and the building of
a stable economic and social
system."
And, according to a paper
co-authored by leavons, "The
small farm, all factors consi
dered, is actually a more effi
cient unit of production than
its large-scale counterpart. To
quote Sterling Wortman of the
Rockerfeller Foundation, . .
most large-scale mechanized
agriculture is less productive
per unit area than small scale
farming can be. The farmer on
a small holding can engage in
intensive high yield gardening,
systems such as intercropping,
multiple cropping, relay plant
ing or other techniques that
require attention to individual
plants. The point is that
mechanized agriculture is very
productive in terms of output
per man-year, but it is not as
productive per unit of land as
the highly intensive systems
are.' Much of the economic
advantage large farms now
enjoy is not due to any stream
lining inherent in their size but
in the tax structures and sub
sidies which favor corporate
'tax loss' farming, land specula
tion, and vertical stratification
of the food industry from pro
duction of fertilizers, to farm
ing, to packaging and distribu
tion of food products."
Jeavons is generally unop
timistic

about the
prospects
for a rapid
change
from our
current ag
ricultural
practices,
projecting
50years as a
minimum

before such a transformation
will be started on a large scale.
"The thing that has always con
fused me," he told me, "is why
so few people have asked why
can't we keep the organic,
small-scale simplicity and also
have the sophistication of
modern science. I think one
reason why people don't get
into that too much is because
they're thinking on a closed

system basis — and it gets away
from a growth economy.
There's no audience for this in
this country, very few people
living that kind of lifestyle.
They're not putting their
energy into making it happen.
They're still chasing the growth
economy that is epitomized by
the development of the tractor
and the chemical fertilizers."
Lemmings have at least one
thing to recommend them
over mankind — at least when
they rush to their destruction,
•they do not drag the rest of the
planet with them. But mankind
has at least one thing to re
commend it over lemmings: at
least as it rushes to its destruc
tion, it can see where it is going
and attempt to stop before it is

too late.
It often
seems,
however,
that rather
than at
tempting to
stop our
sprint to
ward an
nihilation,

one part of
our species is actively engaged
in accelerating our progress
while the other part fiddles
marching tunes like a whole
race of carefree Neros. We find
our leaders more concerned
with their own destinies than
those of the people they are
supposed to lead; we find, in
fact, that they seem to have no
awareness of any destiny other
than their own. We find them
structuring our culture for
their own ends, without regard
for any future more distant
than the probable span of their
lives. We find an educational
system which perpetuates
their narrow-sightedness. We
at the summit of our culture
find ourselves in the midst of a
highly-sophisticated,
apparently-benign process
which teaches us to shut our
eyes and go faster.
But then it can not be de
nied: the power of vision has
not left us entirely; there are
those who do stretch their
necks to look around. It is no
doubt painful and traumatic to
take a long look at the destruc
tion which we are cultivating.
But there are, these people tell
us, other views, views as prom
ising as the scene immediately
before us is threatening. And,
hope being what it is, they are
working to divert our rush.
)eavons, obviously, is such a
man. He is not militant, anar
chistic, alienated, alienating or
bitter. As he says, "you don't
really need to change the sys
tem to live a better life."
leavons is just quietly pursuing
his work, doing what he can to
bring about an improvement in
the attitude of our culture.

Mexico, Canada and Nepal.


The headquarters of the Syn
tex Corporation is located
on a hillside just west of Footh
ill Expressway, across from
Palo Alto's Veterans Administ
ration Hospital. A large cement
and glass building in the mod
ern architectural style, it sits on
a very green and well-groomed
lawn. At the foot of the hill,
however, literally a stone's
throw away from the
chemical-pharmaceuticals bas
tion, an incongruous sight pre
sents itself: a truck garden, in
the best tradition of truck gar
dens. It is a disorderly collage
of colors and textures — the
lush green of crops and weeds,
the crumbling dark brown of
newly turned earth, the dry
light brown of withered vege
tation, the dusty white sheen
of sheet plastic, the hard lustre
less gray of metal siding.

A casual passerby, observing
the two establishments, would
be likely to see in their proxim
ity the tension which often
exists between the new and
dynamic and the old and static.
Palo Aito, he might surmise, is
in the final stages of a
metamorphosis from the pas
toral to the cosmopolitan; the
garden, a quaint anachronism,
will soon be the site of yet
another corporate headquar
ters and the cement and glass
building on the hillside will ac
quire, by comparison, an air of
establishment and seniority.

Such is not the case, how
ever. Quite to the contrary, the
cement and glass building
antedates the garden; the land
on which the garden is located
is owned by the corporation
and worked by the garden's
proprietors under the terms of
a rent-free lease; the operation
of the garden is partially sub
sidized, with virtually no return
obligations, by the corpora
tion's donation, in addition to
the land, of water and funds. It
is an unusual situation, but it is
an unusual truck garden.
Foods ranging from grains to
fruit to beans to vegetables are
under cultivation there. The
yield of any given foodstuff at
any given harvest time typically
ranges from two to 31 times the
national, California or Santa
Clara County average
(whichever is higher). From
one-half to one-sixteenth the
average amount of water per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. From one-half to
one-sixteenth the average
amount of nitrogen fertilizer
per pound of food produced is
typically used. About one
one-hundredth the energy per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. No "chemical" fer
tilizer is used. Mo pesticides of
any type are used. No machin
ery more sophisticated than a
simple wheelbarrow is used.
And it is not uncommon to see
men and women in business
dress entering or leaving the
garden or engaged in some
phase of agriculture.
Despite these arresting facts,
the garden and its proprietors
remain surprisingly anonym
ous. Perhaps it is the
previously-described undis
tinguished character of the
former, or maybe it is the
quiet, unassuming style of the
latter. It may even be that it has
less to do with either the
former or latter than the nature
of the rest of the world. What
ever the case, it would be a
poor bet indeed to wager that
that anonymity is to be pre
served for very much longer.
Although I have been in
terested in food in general
and gardening in specific for
much of my life, the terms
"biodynamic" and "French in
tensive" remained obscure to
me until I made the acquain
tance of John leavons. An
alumnus of Yale and former
head of Business Services for
the Stanford library system,
leavons currently wields the

ponderous title of Director of
Agricultural Research for Ecol
ogy Action of the Midpenin
sula.
It is largely Jeavons who is
responsible for the present
shape — in both a physLal and
an abstract sense — of the ag
ricultural program underway
on the three and three-quarter
acre plot of Syntex land. It was
Jeavons who, after making a
study on his own initiative of
United Nations iand use and

population
figures, be
came con
vinced that
the planet
was still
capable of
feeding all
her in
habitants;
it was he
who, after
attending a
seminar on
the agricul
tural
techniques

synthesized by the Englishman
Alan Chadwick, sought out the
master horticulturalist in his
barren hillside-turned Garden
of Eden at the University of
California at Santa Cruz; it was
Jeavons who, after talking at
length with Chadwick, prop
osed the idea of a combined
research and community gar
den to the board of directors of
Ecology Action, a Palo Alto
conservation group which had
won recognition for a success
ful city-wide recycling prog-

ram; it was he who, after con
vincing them of the viability
and significance of such a
program, proceeded to as
semble the elements of Com
mon Ground — land, funds,
people — and embark on a
course of rigorous scientific
research.
The program is now in its
sixth year. Each succeeding
year has, according to Jeavons,
confirmed his faith in Chad
wick's techniques, known now
as the biodynamic-French in
tensive method.
When I first spoke with
leavons, I had a vague recollec
tion of a chapter in a gardening
book which had described a
"labor-intensive" system of
farming which allowed the
densely-populated countries
of western Europe to grow
much food on little land. This, I
imagined, was related to
"French-intensive" farming. In
his articulate and methodical
way, Jeavons soon clarified and
expanded this conception —
and made me realize how large
a topic this form of agriculture
had become.
"The method we're using
now," he said, "is made up of
two techniques that were de
veloped in Europe around the
turn of the century. The French
intensive method is one—that
reached its culmination in the
1890s outside Paris. What it did
was it raised vegetables in beds
that consisted of 18 inches of
horse manure — which was re
ally plentiful at the time. Be
cause of this high level of or
ganic matter and the fertility it
created, as well as the great
depth of loose material, roots
were able to grow downward
instead of needing room to
grow out horizontally. So they
were able to use very close
spacing."
This simple concept, leavons
continued, accounts for a sig
nificant part of the increased
yields which the method pro
duces. As jeavons phrased it in
a research report summarizing
Common Ground's first four
years, "A simple 24-inch deep
soil preparation allows the

plants to be spaced more
closely so that their leaves
touch or almost touch. . . .
This factor alone would make
fourfold yields possible be
cause four times as many
plants as usual can be planted
in a given area."
"The other technique,"
Jeavons told me, "was the
biodynamic technique. It was
developed in the 1920s by
Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian
genius who was into educa
tion, philosophy, religion, and
agriculture. The French inten
sive method had been de
veloped over hundreds of
years by French marchiers or
gardeners. The biodynamic
method, though, was de
veloped by Steiner in the late
'20s fora lot of wealthy German
farmers who had noticed that
their yields were going down
and they were getting more in
sect and disease problems. It
turned out they had been using
chemical fertilizers. Urea, a
kind of artifical nitrogen, had
been developed in the late
1880s. Steiner traced their
problems to the chemical fer
tilizers and suggested that they
return to some of their old
methods and adopt five special
practices. These practices be
camethe biodynamic method.
"One was the use of raised
beds — beds only 12 inches
deep prepared by raking soil
out of the path. This was going
back to the Greeks who found
out that plants grew better in
landslides. The raised beds as
they came to be dug were like
little, artificial landslides. The
reasons the plants do better in
them is because the soil is
looser and there's more air or
gases in it — you need up to 50
percent gases for good plant
growth."
jeavons frequently uses the
verb "dovetail" to describe
areas where two concepts in
termesh or compliment each
other. The deep soil prepara
tion and close spacing of the
French intensive method
dovetails, he said, with the "ar
tificial landslides" of the
biodynamic method to pro

duce healthier, more produc
tive plants.
"There was a study in the '50s
at the University of California
at Berkeley," he said, "that
showed that if you improved
root health by two to four per
cent for most common field
crops you could increase the
yields by 200 to 400 percent.
One of the things which can
make this possible is better soil
preparation and aeration. With
our method, you have more air
in the soil, more surface area
for contact between soil and air
since a raised bed has a curved
surface and also more surface
area to absorb rain or watering
and warmth from the sun. And
the curved surface also allows
you to increase the planting
area by 20 percent. Say you
have a plot of land that's a
hundred square feet and you
make it a raised bed, you can
wind up with 120 square feet of
planting area.
"The second technique that
Steiner recommended, after
the raised beds — which inci
dentally may even have gone
back even before the Greeks to
the Chinese, possibly 4000
years ago — was the use of or
ganic fertilizers. Chemical fer
tilizers at the time were mainly
just nitrogen or nitrogen and
phosphorous. They weren't
balanced or complete; they
needed trace minerals and
potash. Also the chemical fer
tilizers broke down very
quickly and harmed the texture
and structure of the soil and
killed the microbiotic life and

so forth. So Steiner asked the
German farmers to return to
organic fertilizers that were
more balanced and diverse —
like fish meal which has nitro
gen, phosphorous and trace
mi nerals and breaks down over
a period of six months instead
of four to six weeks.
"The third technique was
companion planting. There
were a lot of folk myths about
what things to grow well to
gether. Steiner tried to scienti
fically investigate this through
such techniques as
chromatography and crystalli
zation and field testing to de
termine which plants grown
together would do better. For
instance, one part chamomile
grown with two hundred parts
of wheat increases the health
and yield of wheat. But if its
one to one, one part
chamomile grown with one
part wheat, the wheat will be
destroyed, or at least seriously
harmed.
"Another technique was the
use of herbal sprays. At one
point they were almost a cult.
You take stinging nettles, for
example, and you do some
thing like — I can't remember
exactly — bury it three feet
under the ground at a certain
conjunction of the plants and
leave it under there for six
months and dig it up and mix it
in with a water solution and
then spray it on the ground. It's
supposed to stimulate the
micorobiotic life of the soil
which helps the plants. Really
far out, really unusual, but it
works.
"And the fifth thing was
planting by the phases of the
moon. The rationale for this
comes from seeing the moon's
effect on oceans — daily tides
of up to 40 feet in some parts of
the world. There's water in the
ground, in seeds and in plants
so it seems there might be a
small effect there.
"So those were the two
threads — the French intensive
method and Steiner's five
biodynamic techniques.
"Now, Chadwick, who is, I
think, a horticultural genius,

certainly a horticultural artist,
put these two techniques to
gether sometime between the
1930s and the 1960s when he
came to Santa Cruz. He had
been severely exasperated by
the second world war. A
woman named Freiavon Molka
and he got together and de
cided that one of the best ways
to bring peace and life and
harmony back into the world
was through gardens. Chad
wick had studied under the
French marchiers and he had
studied under Steiner. He's
had over 50 years of experience
in raising food. He also worked
under George Bernard Shaw in
drama, he's a painter, an actor,
an incredible individual — very
dramatic in his presentation of
things.
"When he put the two farm
ing techniques together, he
simplified them. Where
Steiner would make herbal
preparations, Chadwick would
just grow the herb, the stinging
nettle say, in the bed and then
put it in the compost pile and
let it have a living kind of influ
ence. Instead of using dead
mulches he used living mulch
— when the plants are so close
together that their leaves just
about touch, the ground is
shaded, moisture is con
served, a micro-climate is
created. So his whole orienta
tion is using living plants and
giving to nature as much as she
produces and even a little
more. If you give to nature
more than she gives you, she
will continually provide you
with abundance.
"So Chadwick prepares his
beds 24 inches deep, not just
18, he uses compost mainly
from vegetable matter, he uses
very little manure — in contrast
with the French and in contrast
with the other biodynamic
people who sometimes use a
lot of manure. This is important
worldwide because one-third
of the world's people now have
a different kind of energy
crisis: they don't have enough
firewood. So like in India,
they're burning the manure
from animals to heat their
homes and to cook their food.
There's a fertilizer shortage
there. But you don't need the
manure under Chadwick's
technique; most of it is veget
able compost, as I said.
"So he uses 24-inch-deep
soil preparation; close spac
ing; comparatively speaking, a
vegetarian or quasi-vegetarian
compost that's two-thirds veg
etable matter, one-third soil;
he uses living herbs rather than
herbal sprays, generally; he
uses some organic fertilizers,
mainly bone meal but not
much else; and he plants by
the phases of the moon."
/ / K| ow we started re-
searching the method
in 1972. Our purposes were
twofold. One was to document
how the method was done — it
had never been documented
in written form because Chad
wick doesn't believe in the
written word but by handing
things down by example and
by word of mouth, master to
apprentice and so forth. Also it
had been reputed that the
method produced four times
the average yield, but this had
never been documented one
way or another.
"The lot Syntex gave us had a
soil which was one-third rock
— meaning pebbles and stuff.
Normal agricultural soil is
maybe five percent rock, not 33
percent. In addition, our soil
was over one-third clay. There
was no nitrogen fertilizer in the
soil and just a trace of phos
phorous and potash.
"During our first five years
we got very encouraging re
sults — yields which ranged
anywhere from two to 16 times
the U.S., Santa Clara County or
California averages. Then in
1976, I developed a new

technique called 'superdig
ging' which is a sort of a super
texturizing technique. This
technique improves the soil
more rapidly. It takes up to five
years using normal techniques
to improve the soil. Re
member, we were in subsoil
clay with no top soil at all. As a
result of this new technique,
this year we've gone as high as
about 60 times the Santa Clara
County average with zucchini
using about two percent of the
water per pound of food pro
duced and one percent of the
added nitrogen fertilizer per
pound of food produced. In
the case of grain, we're as high
as two and a quarter times the
national average on soybeans,

double on
wheat and
expect to
go six to
eight times
for those
yields.
Also, we
expect to
be using
one third to
one-eighth
the water
per pound
of grain
produced
— and that
could be
significant
because it
means you

could be getting very high
grain yields with as little as
eight or 10 inches of rainfall.
Over 75 percent of the arable
area of the world has 10 or
more inches of rainfall.
"An interesting thing is that
the Zulus of South Africa use a
similar technique — similar to
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method, that is, that they
developed on their own. It's a
triple-digging technique, lust
before it rains they prepare the
soil three feet deep and as
soon as it does rain they plant
their grain. It doesn't rain all
summer and is very dry. They
grow grain when no one else
can grow grain anywhere. So
here's a similar technique
that's working under natural
rainfall conditions.
"What this means is that if
we reach all of our projections,
we would be getting an aver
age of four to eight times on
vegetables and six to eight
times the average yield on
grain. And these yields, by the
way are already being obtained
somewhere else in the world
on the average — and on a
large scale basis. A way to high
light this is to say that for every
major crop grown in the Un
ited States, some other country
in the world on the average is
getting a yield about twice as
high. So U.S. agriculture,
though it may look good, is not
the best with all crops."
One morning soon after our
first conversation, I met
Jeavons for a tour of the Com
mon Ground garden. He is
plainly in his element there. A
fairly large man in his mid-30s
he sports an incipient pot belly
and a voluminous though
well-behaved beard. He was
dressed in mud-spattered
work pants, a heavy flannel
shirt and a sweat-stained
leather cap. He generally main
tains a serious demeanor al
though when he smiles he re
veals a considerable capacity
for simple delight. His eyes
especially, manifest his posi
tive attitude: whether engaged
in a visual analysis of crop
progress, gazing at clouds in
the distance or glancing at his
auditor, they are intelligent,
energetic, unusually alive.
He took me first to some
thing he called an "herbal
lawn." From a distance, this
looked similar to a grass lawn
— green and flat. Standing next
to it, however, I saw that its

color was not uniform. In
terspersed among the light
green of sweet clover were
plants of darker shades —
identified by Jeavons as Roman
chamomile, creeping thyme
and dwarf yarrow. In addition
to being "simple and beauti
ful," Jeavons said, the lawn
fixes nitrogen in the soil and
concentrates phosphorous
and potash in its leaves. It is
thus beneficial to the soil on
which it is grown and can be
mown as a source of
nutriment-rich compost.
For the next hour we looked
at such things as newly-planted
fruit trees, fragrant and useful
herbs, fallow planting beds,
freshly-prepared planting

beds, planting beds overflow
ing with mature vegetables and
legumes, and recently har
vested planting beds. All the
while Jeavons kept up an in
teresting commentary filled
with odd facts and anecdotes.
"You see those nicely dug beds
over there?" he asked at one
point. "Those were prepared
by a 65-year-old woman with a
heart condition."
Finally, he led me to a
fenced-off area with a pad
locked gate. "This is the re
search garden," he said.
"What we've been looking at is
the community garden. People
from all over, including about
five to 10 percent of all the Syn
tex employees, are involved
with raising food here."
Inside the research garden
were rows of beds each about
six feet wide and 20 feet long. I
was slightly disappointed by
the modest dimensions of the
whole garden — smaller than
that occupied by the average
house — since it seemed that
something larger would be re
quired for such significant re
search.
"This area is about 2500
square feet," Jeavons said as if
reading my thoughts. "Our re
search indicates that a com
pletely balanced diet could be
grown on this much space —
and with as little as a half hour
of work a day. The same
amount of food, if it were
grown by U.S. chemical,
mechanized techniques would
take 10,000 square feet. In In
dia, the same diet would take
32,000 square feet.
"Now, the average American
eats 322 pounds of vegetables
and soft fruits — fruits like
strawberries, cantalopes and
watermelon — a year. Two
hundred and twenty of those
pounds are potatoes. You can
grow that amount of vegeta
bles with the biodynamic-
French intensive method in 100
square feet in a four to six
month growing season. In the
case of fruit trees, you can put
two of them in a hundred
square foot bed on eight foot
centers. Each of those fruit
trees should produce a
hundred pounds of hard fruit
per year and the average
American eats 162 pounds of
hard fruit a year. It should take
you maybe a half a minute to a
minute a day to take care of the
trees on an average basis and it
should take you about five to
10 minutes a day to take care of

the vegetable bed.
"So what we're talking about
is eventually people can start
raising a fair amount of their
food just in their back yard. A
family of four, in 400 square
feet, could raise in a four to six
month growing season food
worth $480 in five to 10 minutes
a day each. Their labor would
then be worth $4 to $8 an hour.
Now a person is probably not
going to do this the first year if
he's never gardened before,
but he's going to do a lot better
than he's done with other
techniques. What this means
for overseas, for India, for
example, where they have fer
tilizer shortages, energy shor
tages, water shortages and
food shortages, is that in a
small area, say 2500 to 7000
square feet they could raise
their total diet rather than in
32,000 square feet. So small is
beautiful: in this country, de
escalation of technology; for
overseas, a move to more self
sufficiency."
We moved to a bed with
some dried leaves and with
ered stalks in it which I recog
nized as potatoes, leavons
went on.
"Now in monetary terms,
with potatoes, we're now at
four times the national average
but we expect to go much
higher— maybe well above 20.
We're still experimenting with
that. I can't tell you on the re
cord how high we expect to go
but I can say on the record it's
over 20. With zucchini, when
we got only 16 times the Santa
Clara county average, the bed
produced $12.50 an hour — or
would have if we'd sold it all at
the wholesale rate. Now that
we're up to 60, we're talking
about producing three times
that or $37.50 an hour. This is
an extreme case but it should
be possible to earn a minimum
of $4 an hour just raising your
own vegetables.
"We're guessing that a new
kind of job or profession will
come out of all of this — mini
farming. We estimate that it
will be possible for one person
working a 40-hour week to
raise $15,000 net on as little as a
quarter of an acre. Currently
small farmers with farms of 200
to4oo acres are lucky if they net
several thousand dollars.
"So our philosophy is one of
low techonology, that is, simple
technology but sophisticated
theory. And I should say that
we're not a 'labor-intensive'
method as many people have
said we are. It's actually 'skill
intensive.' Bed preparation
may be the hardest job of the
method but once the soil is in
good shape and using a new
device that they've developed
in Canada, it should be possi
ble to prepare a bed in five to
10 minutes.
"All the resources that we
need to raise food right are av
ailable— we're just using them
in the wrong way. Take wheat
production, for example.
Normally to produce more
grain you have to use a lot
more fertilizer. For instance
with corn, from 1940 to 1960,
the nitrogen fertilizer use in
creased 10-fold, but the yields
only doubled. So your fertilizer
effectiveness was only one
fifth as good in 1960 as it was in
1940. Well, we cut our nitrogen
fertilizer use in one year to
one-half and the yield dou
bled. At the same time the pro
tein content increased. It went
from 14.8 percent to 15.7.
Normally when your yields go
up, your protein content per
pound of food goes down. Plus
we used less water and less
energy, less phosphorous and
less potash.
"Eventually, if we get all the
projections that we expect to
get, we'll be producing as
much food per hour as people
with machines can produce. So
this makes the individual im

portant again and gives the in
dividual a choice.
"I should stress that we've
got a ways to go yet. We don't
have a perfect system. We have
failures; we haven't reached all
our projections, but we've had
a lot of good results too.
"Right now, we think if the
method has an Achilles heel, it
will be in the net flow of or
ganic matter in and out of the
soil. We may have to face the
possibility that with the yields
we're now getting, we'll
exhaust the soil in a few more
years. The most important
thing about an agricultural
method is whether it is sustain
able in an environmentally ba
lanced way. The Chinese have
been able for hundreds of
years to grow twice as much
food as the United States does
now. And by using manual, or
ganic techniques and fertiliz
ers grown or produced on their
farms. But we may have to face
the possibility that our sustain
able yield level will be less than
our optimum yield level."
Jeavons turned away from
the potato bed and regarded
me fora moment, as if to make
sure I had understood every
thing up to that point. After tak
ing a deep breath, he turned
and pointed to a pair of
plastic-covered structures
which were, evidently,
greenhouses. One was very
similar in appearance to a con
ventional greenhouse but the
other one was only three feet
high and just covered one
hundred-square-foot bed.
"Now with these miniature
greenhouses," Jeavons said,
"a 12-month growing season is
possible in most climates
where food is grown. What this
means is you could grow your
total diet on as little as 1250
square feet working as little as
15 minutes a day." He walked
to the center of the area and
spread his arms. "That's this
much," he said, his tone imply
ing how little he thought 1250
square feet to be. I was a little
incredulous for a moment be
cause the space he indicated
really seemed no larger than
the average living room. But
then I remembered that an
acre is somewhat more than
40,000 square feet. I had no
trouble believing that the de
signated area was about a thir
tieth of an acre. "And, he said,
with a smile, "even though it's
too early to say on the record,
we expect to go much, much
lower than that to grow a total
diet."

In 1840 the German chemist
Justus von Liebig published a
paper entitled "Chemistry in
its application to agriculture
and physiology." This event,
giving birth to a whole new ap •
proach to the cultivation of
food — which I will call "chem
ical agriculture" — intruded
into the gradual evolution of
farming with all the virulence
of a malignant tumor.
It is true that relatively little
change had taken place in ag
riculture since the dawn of
civilization — 4000 years or

more if one goes back to the
Chinese farmers mentioned by
Jeavons; it is true that during
the period in which chemical
agriculture was developed in
earnest — from the 1880s to the
1920s — the world's population
was growing at a heretofore
unimaginable rate; and it is
true that many well
intentioned people saw in
chemical agriculture the only
means of putting food in the
staggering number of new and
hungry mouths.
It is also true, however, that
concurrent with the rise of
chemical agriculture were the
several great strides outlined
by Jeavons — the strides which
developed in a relatively short
time into the biodynamic-
French intensive method. As
chemical agriculture
burgeoned into an industry
and an orthodoxy, men such as
Rudolf Steiner — and he was
far from alone — recognized
the folly of abandoning
methods proven over millenia
for new and untried
techniques. On the next occa
sion on which I met with
jeavons, I asked him what he
believed were the causes for
the headlong rush toward
chemicals in the face of saner
councils.
"Well, part of the reason,"
he said, "was that as chemical
fertilizers came into play, trac
tors were being developed and
brought into use on many
farms. This made it possible to
spread chemical fertilizer very
easily. It was less time
consuming than spreading
manures. Also, with the tractor
you were able to farm large
areas. Even though it wasn't in
tensive, you could farm a large
area and produce a lot of food
in a very short time. The prom
ise of opening up increased ac
reage was very seductive. To
most people, two to four times
the area meant two to four
times the food. On the other
hand, the French intensive cul
ture that was developed out
side Paris required an awful lot
of people per acre. So with
everyone getting caught up in
the petrochemical
mechanized revolution, the
tendency was to equate 'faster'
with 'more and better.' Which
for a short time was probably
true. But if we get into today's
period, the petrochemicals are
getting more expensive so
spending more time and labor
to get the same amount of food
isn't as unappealing as it used
to be. But more important, I

believe,
from the
perspective
of our re
search, is
that we be
lieve we're
going to be
able to
produce as
much food
per hour as
a machine
can — by
hand. The
way that
we're going
to be able
to do this is
by thinking
about

what's been done in the past,
about what's being done cur
rently, and maximizing the
simplicity which produces the
time efficiency."
During the course of the last
half century, many of the
spokesmen for non-chemical
agriculture have found them
selves ostracized for their be
liefs and techniques. At best
they have been ignored by the
academic and political estab
lishment, at worst they have
been actively harassed and
obstructed in presenting their
cases before the public. One of


these men, Sir Albert Howard,
an Imperial Botanist for the In
dian government, "did some
fantastic things," according to
Jeavons. "Everyone had told
him he couldn't grow cotton
organically in India because
the pests would eat it up. It
took him a while but at the end
of five years, he was growing
cotton organically — with no
pesticides. He had less crop
loss than the people who were
using pesticides."
Although knighted for this
and other accomplishments,
Howard received so much pub
lic ridicule — both from fer-

tilizer in
dustry
spokesmen
and his fel
low scien
tists — that
his ideas
went
widely un
heeded.
Howard
wrote, after

addressing one particularly
nonreceptive audience of
botanists, "Here again I was
amazed by the limited know
ledge and experience of the
world's agriculturalists dis
closed by this debate. I felt I
was dealing with beginners
and that some of the argu
ments put forward could al
most be described as the im
pertinences of ignorance."
In this country, the case of
|.l. Rodale, whose publications
are among the standard refer
ences for a large segment of
the organic farming popula
tion, is not unusual. Rodale
was forced to spend almost a
quarter of a million dollars in
legal fees to win a court deci
sion over the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission which had
blocked the publication of his
book "The Health Finder."
I asked )eavons whether he
thought these examples indi
cated the presence of an estab
lishment which had a vested in
terest in the development and
maintenance of chemical ag
riculture irrespective of the
best interests of mankind. It
was true, he said, that
"businessmen are always
ready to take advantage of a
good thing and push it to the
fullest," but there were proba
bly "two separate thrusts" —
business incentives and desire
for greater efficiency — which
"then became merged."
leavons then related an in
teresting anecdote, most of
which had to remain off the re
cord, which was a telling
statement about the present
state of agricultural research.
"It was amazing to me," he
said, "that agricultural schools
are not more interested in re
search like that (Howard's),
and in trying to replicate it — at
least as an alternative ap
proach. I wrote a letter to an
individual who was involved in
agricultural research at a col
lege here in California. I told
him I was confused. In the light
of some of the possibilities we
were uncovering with the
biodynamic-French intensive
method, why wasn't anyone
investigating our results. He
wrote me back a very good let
ter. He indicated that the re
search money is coming from
thechemical industriesand the
agricultural interests. They
have an interest in using the
system they've already got.
And again, their purpose is
making money from it, not
necessarily making it better. So
you see, the professors almost
have to ridicule alternative
methods. If they go into other
areas, they become profes
sionally ostracized and they
can't get funds."
leavons continued with
another anecdote, this time
regarding a conference about
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method which was held

last year in Santa Barbara. Sev
eral members of the American
Society of Agronomy had at
tended, he said, and had asked
questions about the
mechanisms of the improved
plant growth. "If we couldn't
tell them exactly how it was
happening, in their terms and
language, they wouldn't give it
very much credence. Someone
pointed out that the Romans
knew how to make concrete a
long time before anyone knew
why it worked. There's a kind
of scientific myopia here. It's
like they're saying, you can
only be scientific if you're sci
entific in the way in which we
are scientific. Well, good lord,
if someone's demonstrating
that something is possible,
anyone who's really an open
minded scientist ought to be
excited and interested to find
out why it's possible. But there
aren't any funds for them to do
it."
leavons is not alone in his
observation of "scientific
myopia" in the present
academic community. In April,
1973, Nicholas Wade reported
in Science magazine that "a
blue-ribbon committee of
basic and agricultural scien
tists" found that "the basic re
search performed by federal
and state agricultural research
organizations is of meager
quality, suffers from a 'shock
ing lack of intellectual leader
ship' and is guided by policies
detrimental to the interests of
agriculture."
Although no reference was
made to a lack of attention to
any specific area of research,
University of Chicago Biology
Prof. Richard Levins wrote in a
later issue of Science that "the
issues raised by Nicholas
Wade's report have to be set
into a broader context than
simply the policies of the U.S.
Department of Agricul
ture. . . . Within agricultural
science, America's traditional
anti-intellectualism survives as
an antitheoretical bias. . . .It is
reinforced by the search for
marketable products (mostly
chemical) as the central
strategy for improvement of
agriculture . . . and by a nar
row acceptance of the present
structure of agriculture as a
given condition which restricts
options. For example, the con
sideration of mixed plantings is
inhibited by the present design
of farm machinery."
The tone of both articles asks
the question, "Ought we to let
this happen?" The tone taken
increasingly by more and more
far-sighted scientists today,
however, is "Can we afford to
let this happen?" jeavons him
self points to the dwindling
supply of natural gas — the
current reserves of which are
slated to run out in about a de
cade — as one factor which
could lead to an agricultural
disaster. Since the production
of artificial nitrogen fertilizer
has been made almost wholly
dependent on natural gas, he
says, and since there is evi-

dence indi
cating that
nitrogen fi
xation from
the air by
soil bac
teria stops
in the pre
sence of ar
tificial fer
tilizer
which in

turn causes a soil "addiction"
to this form of fertilizer, it
seems likely that we will be
faced with the necessity of
using pollution-producing coal
to satisfy our farmlands'
"habit." And even the coal
supply will someday be
exhausted.
Yet even if the scarcity of
energy were not an issue, the
question would still be a valid
one. In addition to beini:


ecologically unsound, our pre
sent system of food production
is economically and technolog
ically unsatisfactory for a large
segment of the world's popula
tion. As Frances Moore Lappe
and ]oseph Collins de
monstrate in their book, Food
First, the expensive technology
and inflated prices which "ag
ribusiness" and its "global
supermarket" force on unde
veloped nations do as much to
hinder their progress as any
other single factor.
Jeavons' belief is that the
solution to many of the world's
food-related problems —
ecological, economical and
technological — lies in a global
move to small-scale farming. A
February, 1976 paper released
by Ecology Action states that
"the current food shortages
will worsen into a crisis of
global proportions unless the
productivity of the 100 million
small farms in the developing
world is increased dramati
cally. Several key points make
the biodynamic-Fiench inten
sive method especially viable
in countries with limited re
sources: The method does not
require complicated machin
ery or expensive fertilizers.
The key technological element
is the common shovel. The
method uses 1/2 to 1/16 the wa
ter. This will be especially valu
able in arid areas of the world,
or those limited to natural rain
fall. The method provides a
self-sufficient livelihood in
areas of high unemployment.
The method's diversified ap
proach encourages intercrop
ping with local foods, thus of
fering a varied diet. The
method builds a healthy soil,
the key to dependable food
production and the building of
a stable economic and social
system."
And, according to a paper
co-authored by leavons, "The
small farm, all factors consi
dered, is actually a more effi
cient unit of production than
its large-scale counterpart. To
quote Sterling Wortman of the
Rockerfeller Foundation, . .
most large-scale mechanized
agriculture is less productive
per unit area than small scale
farming can be. The farmer on
a small holding can engage in
intensive high yield gardening,
systems such as intercropping,
multiple cropping, relay plant
ing or other techniques that
require attention to individual
plants. The point is that
mechanized agriculture is very
productive in terms of output
per man-year, but it is not as
productive per unit of land as
the highly intensive systems
are.' Much of the economic
advantage large farms now
enjoy is not due to any stream
lining inherent in their size but
in the tax structures and sub
sidies which favor corporate
'tax loss' farming, land specula
tion, and vertical stratification
of the food industry from pro
duction of fertilizers, to farm
ing, to packaging and distribu
tion of food products."
Jeavons is generally unop
timistic

about the
prospects
for a rapid
change
from our
current ag
ricultural
practices,
projecting
50years as a
minimum

before such a transformation
will be started on a large scale.
"The thing that has always con
fused me," he told me, "is why
so few people have asked why
can't we keep the organic,
small-scale simplicity and also
have the sophistication of
modern science. I think one
reason why people don't get
into that too much is because
they're thinking on a closed

system basis — and it gets away
from a growth economy.
There's no audience for this in
this country, very few people
living that kind of lifestyle.
They're not putting their
energy into making it happen.
They're still chasing the growth
economy that is epitomized by
the development of the tractor
and the chemical fertilizers."
Lemmings have at least one
thing to recommend them
over mankind — at least when
they rush to their destruction,
•they do not drag the rest of the
planet with them. But mankind
has at least one thing to re
commend it over lemmings: at
least as it rushes to its destruc
tion, it can see where it is going
and attempt to stop before it is

too late.
It often
seems,
however,
that rather
than at
tempting to
stop our
sprint to
ward an
nihilation,

one part of
our species is actively engaged
in accelerating our progress
while the other part fiddles
marching tunes like a whole
race of carefree Neros. We find
our leaders more concerned
with their own destinies than
those of the people they are
supposed to lead; we find, in
fact, that they seem to have no
awareness of any destiny other
than their own. We find them
structuring our culture for
their own ends, without regard
for any future more distant
than the probable span of their
lives. We find an educational
system which perpetuates
their narrow-sightedness. We
at the summit of our culture
find ourselves in the midst of a
highly-sophisticated,
apparently-benign process
which teaches us to shut our
eyes and go faster.
But then it can not be de
nied: the power of vision has
not left us entirely; there are
those who do stretch their
necks to look around. It is no
doubt painful and traumatic to
take a long look at the destruc
tion which we are cultivating.
But there are, these people tell
us, other views, views as prom
ising as the scene immediately
before us is threatening. And,
hope being what it is, they are
working to divert our rush.
)eavons, obviously, is such a
man. He is not militant, anar
chistic, alienated, alienating or
bitter. As he says, "you don't
really need to change the sys
tem to live a better life."
leavons is just quietly pursuing
his work, doing what he can to
bring about an improvement in
the attitude of our culture.

Grow More Vegetables Than

The headquarters of the Syn
tex Corporation is located
on a hillside just west of Footh
ill Expressway, across from
Palo Alto's Veterans Administ
ration Hospital. A large cement
and glass building in the mod
ern architectural style, it sits on
a very green and well-groomed
lawn. At the foot of the hill,
however, literally a stone's
throw away from the
chemical-pharmaceuticals bas
tion, an incongruous sight pre
sents itself: a truck garden, in
the best tradition of truck gar
dens. It is a disorderly collage
of colors and textures — the
lush green of crops and weeds,
the crumbling dark brown of
newly turned earth, the dry
light brown of withered vege
tation, the dusty white sheen
of sheet plastic, the hard lustre
less gray of metal siding.

A casual passerby, observing
the two establishments, would
be likely to see in their proxim
ity the tension which often
exists between the new and
dynamic and the old and static.
Palo Aito, he might surmise, is
in the final stages of a
metamorphosis from the pas
toral to the cosmopolitan; the
garden, a quaint anachronism,
will soon be the site of yet
another corporate headquar
ters and the cement and glass
building on the hillside will ac
quire, by comparison, an air of
establishment and seniority.

Such is not the case, how
ever. Quite to the contrary, the
cement and glass building
antedates the garden; the land
on which the garden is located
is owned by the corporation
and worked by the garden's
proprietors under the terms of
a rent-free lease; the operation
of the garden is partially sub
sidized, with virtually no return
obligations, by the corpora
tion's donation, in addition to
the land, of water and funds. It
is an unusual situation, but it is
an unusual truck garden.
Foods ranging from grains to
fruit to beans to vegetables are
under cultivation there. The
yield of any given foodstuff at
any given harvest time typically
ranges from two to 31 times the
national, California or Santa
Clara County average
(whichever is higher). From
one-half to one-sixteenth the
average amount of water per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. From one-half to
one-sixteenth the average
amount of nitrogen fertilizer
per pound of food produced is
typically used. About one
one-hundredth the energy per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. No "chemical" fer
tilizer is used. Mo pesticides of
any type are used. No machin
ery more sophisticated than a
simple wheelbarrow is used.
And it is not uncommon to see
men and women in business
dress entering or leaving the
garden or engaged in some
phase of agriculture.
Despite these arresting facts,
the garden and its proprietors
remain surprisingly anonym
ous. Perhaps it is the
previously-described undis
tinguished character of the
former, or maybe it is the
quiet, unassuming style of the
latter. It may even be that it has
less to do with either the
former or latter than the nature
of the rest of the world. What
ever the case, it would be a
poor bet indeed to wager that
that anonymity is to be pre
served for very much longer.
Although I have been in
terested in food in general
and gardening in specific for
much of my life, the terms
"biodynamic" and "French in
tensive" remained obscure to
me until I made the acquain
tance of John leavons. An
alumnus of Yale and former
head of Business Services for
the Stanford library system,
leavons currently wields the

ponderous title of Director of
Agricultural Research for Ecol
ogy Action of the Midpenin
sula.
It is largely Jeavons who is
responsible for the present
shape — in both a physLal and
an abstract sense — of the ag
ricultural program underway
on the three and three-quarter
acre plot of Syntex land. It was
Jeavons who, after making a
study on his own initiative of
United Nations iand use and

population
figures, be
came con
vinced that
the planet
was still
capable of
feeding all
her in
habitants;
it was he
who, after
attending a
seminar on
the agricul
tural
techniques

synthesized by the Englishman
Alan Chadwick, sought out the
master horticulturalist in his
barren hillside-turned Garden
of Eden at the University of
California at Santa Cruz; it was
Jeavons who, after talking at
length with Chadwick, prop
osed the idea of a combined
research and community gar
den to the board of directors of
Ecology Action, a Palo Alto
conservation group which had
won recognition for a success
ful city-wide recycling prog-

ram; it was he who, after con
vincing them of the viability
and significance of such a
program, proceeded to as
semble the elements of Com
mon Ground — land, funds,
people — and embark on a
course of rigorous scientific
research.
The program is now in its
sixth year. Each succeeding
year has, according to Jeavons,
confirmed his faith in Chad
wick's techniques, known now
as the biodynamic-French in
tensive method.
When I first spoke with
leavons, I had a vague recollec
tion of a chapter in a gardening
book which had described a
"labor-intensive" system of
farming which allowed the
densely-populated countries
of western Europe to grow
much food on little land. This, I
imagined, was related to
"French-intensive" farming. In
his articulate and methodical
way, Jeavons soon clarified and
expanded this conception —
and made me realize how large
a topic this form of agriculture
had become.
"The method we're using
now," he said, "is made up of
two techniques that were de
veloped in Europe around the
turn of the century. The French
intensive method is one—that
reached its culmination in the
1890s outside Paris. What it did
was it raised vegetables in beds
that consisted of 18 inches of
horse manure — which was re
ally plentiful at the time. Be
cause of this high level of or
ganic matter and the fertility it
created, as well as the great
depth of loose material, roots
were able to grow downward
instead of needing room to
grow out horizontally. So they
were able to use very close
spacing."
This simple concept, leavons
continued, accounts for a sig
nificant part of the increased
yields which the method pro
duces. As jeavons phrased it in
a research report summarizing
Common Ground's first four
years, "A simple 24-inch deep
soil preparation allows the

plants to be spaced more
closely so that their leaves
touch or almost touch. . . .
This factor alone would make
fourfold yields possible be
cause four times as many
plants as usual can be planted
in a given area."
"The other technique,"
Jeavons told me, "was the
biodynamic technique. It was
developed in the 1920s by
Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian
genius who was into educa
tion, philosophy, religion, and
agriculture. The French inten
sive method had been de
veloped over hundreds of
years by French marchiers or
gardeners. The biodynamic
method, though, was de
veloped by Steiner in the late
'20s fora lot of wealthy German
farmers who had noticed that
their yields were going down
and they were getting more in
sect and disease problems. It
turned out they had been using
chemical fertilizers. Urea, a
kind of artifical nitrogen, had
been developed in the late
1880s. Steiner traced their
problems to the chemical fer
tilizers and suggested that they
return to some of their old
methods and adopt five special
practices. These practices be
camethe biodynamic method.
"One was the use of raised
beds — beds only 12 inches
deep prepared by raking soil
out of the path. This was going
back to the Greeks who found
out that plants grew better in
landslides. The raised beds as
they came to be dug were like
little, artificial landslides. The
reasons the plants do better in
them is because the soil is
looser and there's more air or
gases in it — you need up to 50
percent gases for good plant
growth."
jeavons frequently uses the
verb "dovetail" to describe
areas where two concepts in
termesh or compliment each
other. The deep soil prepara
tion and close spacing of the
French intensive method
dovetails, he said, with the "ar
tificial landslides" of the
biodynamic method to pro

duce healthier, more produc
tive plants.
"There was a study in the '50s
at the University of California
at Berkeley," he said, "that
showed that if you improved
root health by two to four per
cent for most common field
crops you could increase the
yields by 200 to 400 percent.
One of the things which can
make this possible is better soil
preparation and aeration. With
our method, you have more air
in the soil, more surface area
for contact between soil and air
since a raised bed has a curved
surface and also more surface
area to absorb rain or watering
and warmth from the sun. And
the curved surface also allows
you to increase the planting
area by 20 percent. Say you
have a plot of land that's a
hundred square feet and you
make it a raised bed, you can
wind up with 120 square feet of
planting area.
"The second technique that
Steiner recommended, after
the raised beds — which inci
dentally may even have gone
back even before the Greeks to
the Chinese, possibly 4000
years ago — was the use of or
ganic fertilizers. Chemical fer
tilizers at the time were mainly
just nitrogen or nitrogen and
phosphorous. They weren't
balanced or complete; they
needed trace minerals and
potash. Also the chemical fer
tilizers broke down very
quickly and harmed the texture
and structure of the soil and
killed the microbiotic life and

so forth. So Steiner asked the
German farmers to return to
organic fertilizers that were
more balanced and diverse —
like fish meal which has nitro
gen, phosphorous and trace
mi nerals and breaks down over
a period of six months instead
of four to six weeks.
"The third technique was
companion planting. There
were a lot of folk myths about
what things to grow well to
gether. Steiner tried to scienti
fically investigate this through
such techniques as
chromatography and crystalli
zation and field testing to de
termine which plants grown
together would do better. For
instance, one part chamomile
grown with two hundred parts
of wheat increases the health
and yield of wheat. But if its
one to one, one part
chamomile grown with one
part wheat, the wheat will be
destroyed, or at least seriously
harmed.
"Another technique was the
use of herbal sprays. At one
point they were almost a cult.
You take stinging nettles, for
example, and you do some
thing like — I can't remember
exactly — bury it three feet
under the ground at a certain
conjunction of the plants and
leave it under there for six
months and dig it up and mix it
in with a water solution and
then spray it on the ground. It's
supposed to stimulate the
micorobiotic life of the soil
which helps the plants. Really
far out, really unusual, but it
works.
"And the fifth thing was
planting by the phases of the
moon. The rationale for this
comes from seeing the moon's
effect on oceans — daily tides
of up to 40 feet in some parts of
the world. There's water in the
ground, in seeds and in plants
so it seems there might be a
small effect there.
"So those were the two
threads — the French intensive
method and Steiner's five
biodynamic techniques.
"Now, Chadwick, who is, I
think, a horticultural genius,

certainly a horticultural artist,
put these two techniques to
gether sometime between the
1930s and the 1960s when he
came to Santa Cruz. He had
been severely exasperated by
the second world war. A
woman named Freiavon Molka
and he got together and de
cided that one of the best ways
to bring peace and life and
harmony back into the world
was through gardens. Chad
wick had studied under the
French marchiers and he had
studied under Steiner. He's
had over 50 years of experience
in raising food. He also worked
under George Bernard Shaw in
drama, he's a painter, an actor,
an incredible individual — very
dramatic in his presentation of
things.
"When he put the two farm
ing techniques together, he
simplified them. Where
Steiner would make herbal
preparations, Chadwick would
just grow the herb, the stinging
nettle say, in the bed and then
put it in the compost pile and
let it have a living kind of influ
ence. Instead of using dead
mulches he used living mulch
— when the plants are so close
together that their leaves just
about touch, the ground is
shaded, moisture is con
served, a micro-climate is
created. So his whole orienta
tion is using living plants and
giving to nature as much as she
produces and even a little
more. If you give to nature
more than she gives you, she
will continually provide you
with abundance.
"So Chadwick prepares his
beds 24 inches deep, not just
18, he uses compost mainly
from vegetable matter, he uses
very little manure — in contrast
with the French and in contrast
with the other biodynamic
people who sometimes use a
lot of manure. This is important
worldwide because one-third
of the world's people now have
a different kind of energy
crisis: they don't have enough
firewood. So like in India,
they're burning the manure
from animals to heat their
homes and to cook their food.
There's a fertilizer shortage
there. But you don't need the
manure under Chadwick's
technique; most of it is veget
able compost, as I said.
"So he uses 24-inch-deep
soil preparation; close spac
ing; comparatively speaking, a
vegetarian or quasi-vegetarian
compost that's two-thirds veg
etable matter, one-third soil;
he uses living herbs rather than
herbal sprays, generally; he
uses some organic fertilizers,
mainly bone meal but not
much else; and he plants by
the phases of the moon."
/ / K| ow we started re-
searching the method
in 1972. Our purposes were
twofold. One was to document
how the method was done — it
had never been documented
in written form because Chad
wick doesn't believe in the
written word but by handing
things down by example and
by word of mouth, master to
apprentice and so forth. Also it
had been reputed that the
method produced four times
the average yield, but this had
never been documented one
way or another.
"The lot Syntex gave us had a
soil which was one-third rock
— meaning pebbles and stuff.
Normal agricultural soil is
maybe five percent rock, not 33
percent. In addition, our soil
was over one-third clay. There
was no nitrogen fertilizer in the
soil and just a trace of phos
phorous and potash.
"During our first five years
we got very encouraging re
sults — yields which ranged
anywhere from two to 16 times
the U.S., Santa Clara County or
California averages. Then in
1976, I developed a new

technique called 'superdig
ging' which is a sort of a super
texturizing technique. This
technique improves the soil
more rapidly. It takes up to five
years using normal techniques
to improve the soil. Re
member, we were in subsoil
clay with no top soil at all. As a
result of this new technique,
this year we've gone as high as
about 60 times the Santa Clara
County average with zucchini
using about two percent of the
water per pound of food pro
duced and one percent of the
added nitrogen fertilizer per
pound of food produced. In
the case of grain, we're as high
as two and a quarter times the
national average on soybeans,

double on
wheat and
expect to
go six to
eight times
for those
yields.
Also, we
expect to
be using
one third to
one-eighth
the water
per pound
of grain
produced
— and that
could be
significant
because it
means you

could be getting very high
grain yields with as little as
eight or 10 inches of rainfall.
Over 75 percent of the arable
area of the world has 10 or
more inches of rainfall.
"An interesting thing is that
the Zulus of South Africa use a
similar technique — similar to
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method, that is, that they
developed on their own. It's a
triple-digging technique, lust
before it rains they prepare the
soil three feet deep and as
soon as it does rain they plant
their grain. It doesn't rain all
summer and is very dry. They
grow grain when no one else
can grow grain anywhere. So
here's a similar technique
that's working under natural
rainfall conditions.
"What this means is that if
we reach all of our projections,
we would be getting an aver
age of four to eight times on
vegetables and six to eight
times the average yield on
grain. And these yields, by the
way are already being obtained
somewhere else in the world
on the average — and on a
large scale basis. A way to high
light this is to say that for every
major crop grown in the Un
ited States, some other country
in the world on the average is
getting a yield about twice as
high. So U.S. agriculture,
though it may look good, is not
the best with all crops."
One morning soon after our
first conversation, I met
Jeavons for a tour of the Com
mon Ground garden. He is
plainly in his element there. A
fairly large man in his mid-30s
he sports an incipient pot belly
and a voluminous though
well-behaved beard. He was
dressed in mud-spattered
work pants, a heavy flannel
shirt and a sweat-stained
leather cap. He generally main
tains a serious demeanor al
though when he smiles he re
veals a considerable capacity
for simple delight. His eyes
especially, manifest his posi
tive attitude: whether engaged
in a visual analysis of crop
progress, gazing at clouds in
the distance or glancing at his
auditor, they are intelligent,
energetic, unusually alive.
He took me first to some
thing he called an "herbal
lawn." From a distance, this
looked similar to a grass lawn
— green and flat. Standing next
to it, however, I saw that its

color was not uniform. In
terspersed among the light
green of sweet clover were
plants of darker shades —
identified by Jeavons as Roman
chamomile, creeping thyme
and dwarf yarrow. In addition
to being "simple and beauti
ful," Jeavons said, the lawn
fixes nitrogen in the soil and
concentrates phosphorous
and potash in its leaves. It is
thus beneficial to the soil on
which it is grown and can be
mown as a source of
nutriment-rich compost.
For the next hour we looked
at such things as newly-planted
fruit trees, fragrant and useful
herbs, fallow planting beds,
freshly-prepared planting

beds, planting beds overflow
ing with mature vegetables and
legumes, and recently har
vested planting beds. All the
while Jeavons kept up an in
teresting commentary filled
with odd facts and anecdotes.
"You see those nicely dug beds
over there?" he asked at one
point. "Those were prepared
by a 65-year-old woman with a
heart condition."
Finally, he led me to a
fenced-off area with a pad
locked gate. "This is the re
search garden," he said.
"What we've been looking at is
the community garden. People
from all over, including about
five to 10 percent of all the Syn
tex employees, are involved
with raising food here."
Inside the research garden
were rows of beds each about
six feet wide and 20 feet long. I
was slightly disappointed by
the modest dimensions of the
whole garden — smaller than
that occupied by the average
house — since it seemed that
something larger would be re
quired for such significant re
search.
"This area is about 2500
square feet," Jeavons said as if
reading my thoughts. "Our re
search indicates that a com
pletely balanced diet could be
grown on this much space —
and with as little as a half hour
of work a day. The same
amount of food, if it were
grown by U.S. chemical,
mechanized techniques would
take 10,000 square feet. In In
dia, the same diet would take
32,000 square feet.
"Now, the average American
eats 322 pounds of vegetables
and soft fruits — fruits like
strawberries, cantalopes and
watermelon — a year. Two
hundred and twenty of those
pounds are potatoes. You can
grow that amount of vegeta
bles with the biodynamic-
French intensive method in 100
square feet in a four to six
month growing season. In the
case of fruit trees, you can put
two of them in a hundred
square foot bed on eight foot
centers. Each of those fruit
trees should produce a
hundred pounds of hard fruit
per year and the average
American eats 162 pounds of
hard fruit a year. It should take
you maybe a half a minute to a
minute a day to take care of the
trees on an average basis and it
should take you about five to
10 minutes a day to take care of

the vegetable bed.
"So what we're talking about
is eventually people can start
raising a fair amount of their
food just in their back yard. A
family of four, in 400 square
feet, could raise in a four to six
month growing season food
worth $480 in five to 10 minutes
a day each. Their labor would
then be worth $4 to $8 an hour.
Now a person is probably not
going to do this the first year if
he's never gardened before,
but he's going to do a lot better
than he's done with other
techniques. What this means
for overseas, for India, for
example, where they have fer
tilizer shortages, energy shor
tages, water shortages and
food shortages, is that in a
small area, say 2500 to 7000
square feet they could raise
their total diet rather than in
32,000 square feet. So small is
beautiful: in this country, de
escalation of technology; for
overseas, a move to more self
sufficiency."
We moved to a bed with
some dried leaves and with
ered stalks in it which I recog
nized as potatoes, leavons
went on.
"Now in monetary terms,
with potatoes, we're now at
four times the national average
but we expect to go much
higher— maybe well above 20.
We're still experimenting with
that. I can't tell you on the re
cord how high we expect to go
but I can say on the record it's
over 20. With zucchini, when
we got only 16 times the Santa
Clara county average, the bed
produced $12.50 an hour — or
would have if we'd sold it all at
the wholesale rate. Now that
we're up to 60, we're talking
about producing three times
that or $37.50 an hour. This is
an extreme case but it should
be possible to earn a minimum
of $4 an hour just raising your
own vegetables.
"We're guessing that a new
kind of job or profession will
come out of all of this — mini
farming. We estimate that it
will be possible for one person
working a 40-hour week to
raise $15,000 net on as little as a
quarter of an acre. Currently
small farmers with farms of 200
to4oo acres are lucky if they net
several thousand dollars.
"So our philosophy is one of
low techonology, that is, simple
technology but sophisticated
theory. And I should say that
we're not a 'labor-intensive'
method as many people have
said we are. It's actually 'skill
intensive.' Bed preparation
may be the hardest job of the
method but once the soil is in
good shape and using a new
device that they've developed
in Canada, it should be possi
ble to prepare a bed in five to
10 minutes.
"All the resources that we
need to raise food right are av
ailable— we're just using them
in the wrong way. Take wheat
production, for example.
Normally to produce more
grain you have to use a lot
more fertilizer. For instance
with corn, from 1940 to 1960,
the nitrogen fertilizer use in
creased 10-fold, but the yields
only doubled. So your fertilizer
effectiveness was only one
fifth as good in 1960 as it was in
1940. Well, we cut our nitrogen
fertilizer use in one year to
one-half and the yield dou
bled. At the same time the pro
tein content increased. It went
from 14.8 percent to 15.7.
Normally when your yields go
up, your protein content per
pound of food goes down. Plus
we used less water and less
energy, less phosphorous and
less potash.
"Eventually, if we get all the
projections that we expect to
get, we'll be producing as
much food per hour as people
with machines can produce. So
this makes the individual im

portant again and gives the in
dividual a choice.
"I should stress that we've
got a ways to go yet. We don't
have a perfect system. We have
failures; we haven't reached all
our projections, but we've had
a lot of good results too.
"Right now, we think if the
method has an Achilles heel, it
will be in the net flow of or
ganic matter in and out of the
soil. We may have to face the
possibility that with the yields
we're now getting, we'll
exhaust the soil in a few more
years. The most important
thing about an agricultural
method is whether it is sustain
able in an environmentally ba
lanced way. The Chinese have
been able for hundreds of
years to grow twice as much
food as the United States does
now. And by using manual, or
ganic techniques and fertiliz
ers grown or produced on their
farms. But we may have to face
the possibility that our sustain
able yield level will be less than
our optimum yield level."
Jeavons turned away from
the potato bed and regarded
me fora moment, as if to make
sure I had understood every
thing up to that point. After tak
ing a deep breath, he turned
and pointed to a pair of
plastic-covered structures
which were, evidently,
greenhouses. One was very
similar in appearance to a con
ventional greenhouse but the
other one was only three feet
high and just covered one
hundred-square-foot bed.
"Now with these miniature
greenhouses," Jeavons said,
"a 12-month growing season is
possible in most climates
where food is grown. What this
means is you could grow your
total diet on as little as 1250
square feet working as little as
15 minutes a day." He walked
to the center of the area and
spread his arms. "That's this
much," he said, his tone imply
ing how little he thought 1250
square feet to be. I was a little
incredulous for a moment be
cause the space he indicated
really seemed no larger than
the average living room. But
then I remembered that an
acre is somewhat more than
40,000 square feet. I had no
trouble believing that the de
signated area was about a thir
tieth of an acre. "And, he said,
with a smile, "even though it's
too early to say on the record,
we expect to go much, much
lower than that to grow a total
diet."

In 1840 the German chemist
Justus von Liebig published a
paper entitled "Chemistry in
its application to agriculture
and physiology." This event,
giving birth to a whole new ap •
proach to the cultivation of
food — which I will call "chem
ical agriculture" — intruded
into the gradual evolution of
farming with all the virulence
of a malignant tumor.
It is true that relatively little
change had taken place in ag
riculture since the dawn of
civilization — 4000 years or

more if one goes back to the
Chinese farmers mentioned by
Jeavons; it is true that during
the period in which chemical
agriculture was developed in
earnest — from the 1880s to the
1920s — the world's population
was growing at a heretofore
unimaginable rate; and it is
true that many well
intentioned people saw in
chemical agriculture the only
means of putting food in the
staggering number of new and
hungry mouths.
It is also true, however, that
concurrent with the rise of
chemical agriculture were the
several great strides outlined
by Jeavons — the strides which
developed in a relatively short
time into the biodynamic-
French intensive method. As
chemical agriculture
burgeoned into an industry
and an orthodoxy, men such as
Rudolf Steiner — and he was
far from alone — recognized
the folly of abandoning
methods proven over millenia
for new and untried
techniques. On the next occa
sion on which I met with
jeavons, I asked him what he
believed were the causes for
the headlong rush toward
chemicals in the face of saner
councils.
"Well, part of the reason,"
he said, "was that as chemical
fertilizers came into play, trac
tors were being developed and
brought into use on many
farms. This made it possible to
spread chemical fertilizer very
easily. It was less time
consuming than spreading
manures. Also, with the tractor
you were able to farm large
areas. Even though it wasn't in
tensive, you could farm a large
area and produce a lot of food
in a very short time. The prom
ise of opening up increased ac
reage was very seductive. To
most people, two to four times
the area meant two to four
times the food. On the other
hand, the French intensive cul
ture that was developed out
side Paris required an awful lot
of people per acre. So with
everyone getting caught up in
the petrochemical
mechanized revolution, the
tendency was to equate 'faster'
with 'more and better.' Which
for a short time was probably
true. But if we get into today's
period, the petrochemicals are
getting more expensive so
spending more time and labor
to get the same amount of food
isn't as unappealing as it used
to be. But more important, I

believe,
from the
perspective
of our re
search, is
that we be
lieve we're
going to be
able to
produce as
much food
per hour as
a machine
can — by
hand. The
way that
we're going
to be able
to do this is
by thinking
about

what's been done in the past,
about what's being done cur
rently, and maximizing the
simplicity which produces the
time efficiency."
During the course of the last
half century, many of the
spokesmen for non-chemical
agriculture have found them
selves ostracized for their be
liefs and techniques. At best
they have been ignored by the
academic and political estab
lishment, at worst they have
been actively harassed and
obstructed in presenting their
cases before the public. One of


these men, Sir Albert Howard,
an Imperial Botanist for the In
dian government, "did some
fantastic things," according to
Jeavons. "Everyone had told
him he couldn't grow cotton
organically in India because
the pests would eat it up. It
took him a while but at the end
of five years, he was growing
cotton organically — with no
pesticides. He had less crop
loss than the people who were
using pesticides."
Although knighted for this
and other accomplishments,
Howard received so much pub
lic ridicule — both from fer-

tilizer in
dustry
spokesmen
and his fel
low scien
tists — that
his ideas
went
widely un
heeded.
Howard
wrote, after

addressing one particularly
nonreceptive audience of
botanists, "Here again I was
amazed by the limited know
ledge and experience of the
world's agriculturalists dis
closed by this debate. I felt I
was dealing with beginners
and that some of the argu
ments put forward could al
most be described as the im
pertinences of ignorance."
In this country, the case of
|.l. Rodale, whose publications
are among the standard refer
ences for a large segment of
the organic farming popula
tion, is not unusual. Rodale
was forced to spend almost a
quarter of a million dollars in
legal fees to win a court deci
sion over the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission which had
blocked the publication of his
book "The Health Finder."
I asked )eavons whether he
thought these examples indi
cated the presence of an estab
lishment which had a vested in
terest in the development and
maintenance of chemical ag
riculture irrespective of the
best interests of mankind. It
was true, he said, that
"businessmen are always
ready to take advantage of a
good thing and push it to the
fullest," but there were proba
bly "two separate thrusts" —
business incentives and desire
for greater efficiency — which
"then became merged."
leavons then related an in
teresting anecdote, most of
which had to remain off the re
cord, which was a telling
statement about the present
state of agricultural research.
"It was amazing to me," he
said, "that agricultural schools
are not more interested in re
search like that (Howard's),
and in trying to replicate it — at
least as an alternative ap
proach. I wrote a letter to an
individual who was involved in
agricultural research at a col
lege here in California. I told
him I was confused. In the light
of some of the possibilities we
were uncovering with the
biodynamic-French intensive
method, why wasn't anyone
investigating our results. He
wrote me back a very good let
ter. He indicated that the re
search money is coming from
thechemical industriesand the
agricultural interests. They
have an interest in using the
system they've already got.
And again, their purpose is
making money from it, not
necessarily making it better. So
you see, the professors almost
have to ridicule alternative
methods. If they go into other
areas, they become profes
sionally ostracized and they
can't get funds."
leavons continued with
another anecdote, this time
regarding a conference about
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method which was held

last year in Santa Barbara. Sev
eral members of the American
Society of Agronomy had at
tended, he said, and had asked
questions about the
mechanisms of the improved
plant growth. "If we couldn't
tell them exactly how it was
happening, in their terms and
language, they wouldn't give it
very much credence. Someone
pointed out that the Romans
knew how to make concrete a
long time before anyone knew
why it worked. There's a kind
of scientific myopia here. It's
like they're saying, you can
only be scientific if you're sci
entific in the way in which we
are scientific. Well, good lord,
if someone's demonstrating
that something is possible,
anyone who's really an open
minded scientist ought to be
excited and interested to find
out why it's possible. But there
aren't any funds for them to do
it."
leavons is not alone in his
observation of "scientific
myopia" in the present
academic community. In April,
1973, Nicholas Wade reported
in Science magazine that "a
blue-ribbon committee of
basic and agricultural scien
tists" found that "the basic re
search performed by federal
and state agricultural research
organizations is of meager
quality, suffers from a 'shock
ing lack of intellectual leader
ship' and is guided by policies
detrimental to the interests of
agriculture."
Although no reference was
made to a lack of attention to
any specific area of research,
University of Chicago Biology
Prof. Richard Levins wrote in a
later issue of Science that "the
issues raised by Nicholas
Wade's report have to be set
into a broader context than
simply the policies of the U.S.
Department of Agricul
ture. . . . Within agricultural
science, America's traditional
anti-intellectualism survives as
an antitheoretical bias. . . .It is
reinforced by the search for
marketable products (mostly
chemical) as the central
strategy for improvement of
agriculture . . . and by a nar
row acceptance of the present
structure of agriculture as a
given condition which restricts
options. For example, the con
sideration of mixed plantings is
inhibited by the present design
of farm machinery."
The tone of both articles asks
the question, "Ought we to let
this happen?" The tone taken
increasingly by more and more
far-sighted scientists today,
however, is "Can we afford to
let this happen?" jeavons him
self points to the dwindling
supply of natural gas — the
current reserves of which are
slated to run out in about a de
cade — as one factor which
could lead to an agricultural
disaster. Since the production
of artificial nitrogen fertilizer
has been made almost wholly
dependent on natural gas, he
says, and since there is evi-

dence indi
cating that
nitrogen fi
xation from
the air by
soil bac
teria stops
in the pre
sence of ar
tificial fer
tilizer
which in

turn causes a soil "addiction"
to this form of fertilizer, it
seems likely that we will be
faced with the necessity of
using pollution-producing coal
to satisfy our farmlands'
"habit." And even the coal
supply will someday be
exhausted.
Yet even if the scarcity of
energy were not an issue, the
question would still be a valid
one. In addition to beini:


ecologically unsound, our pre
sent system of food production
is economically and technolog
ically unsatisfactory for a large
segment of the world's popula
tion. As Frances Moore Lappe
and ]oseph Collins de
monstrate in their book, Food
First, the expensive technology
and inflated prices which "ag
ribusiness" and its "global
supermarket" force on unde
veloped nations do as much to
hinder their progress as any
other single factor.
Jeavons' belief is that the
solution to many of the world's
food-related problems —
ecological, economical and
technological — lies in a global
move to small-scale farming. A
February, 1976 paper released
by Ecology Action states that
"the current food shortages
will worsen into a crisis of
global proportions unless the
productivity of the 100 million
small farms in the developing
world is increased dramati
cally. Several key points make
the biodynamic-Fiench inten
sive method especially viable
in countries with limited re
sources: The method does not
require complicated machin
ery or expensive fertilizers.
The key technological element
is the common shovel. The
method uses 1/2 to 1/16 the wa
ter. This will be especially valu
able in arid areas of the world,
or those limited to natural rain
fall. The method provides a
self-sufficient livelihood in
areas of high unemployment.
The method's diversified ap
proach encourages intercrop
ping with local foods, thus of
fering a varied diet. The
method builds a healthy soil,
the key to dependable food
production and the building of
a stable economic and social
system."
And, according to a paper
co-authored by leavons, "The
small farm, all factors consi
dered, is actually a more effi
cient unit of production than
its large-scale counterpart. To
quote Sterling Wortman of the
Rockerfeller Foundation, . .
most large-scale mechanized
agriculture is less productive
per unit area than small scale
farming can be. The farmer on
a small holding can engage in
intensive high yield gardening,
systems such as intercropping,
multiple cropping, relay plant
ing or other techniques that
require attention to individual
plants. The point is that
mechanized agriculture is very
productive in terms of output
per man-year, but it is not as
productive per unit of land as
the highly intensive systems
are.' Much of the economic
advantage large farms now
enjoy is not due to any stream
lining inherent in their size but
in the tax structures and sub
sidies which favor corporate
'tax loss' farming, land specula
tion, and vertical stratification
of the food industry from pro
duction of fertilizers, to farm
ing, to packaging and distribu
tion of food products."
Jeavons is generally unop
timistic

about the
prospects
for a rapid
change
from our
current ag
ricultural
practices,
projecting
50years as a
minimum

before such a transformation
will be started on a large scale.
"The thing that has always con
fused me," he told me, "is why
so few people have asked why
can't we keep the organic,
small-scale simplicity and also
have the sophistication of
modern science. I think one
reason why people don't get
into that too much is because
they're thinking on a closed

system basis — and it gets away
from a growth economy.
There's no audience for this in
this country, very few people
living that kind of lifestyle.
They're not putting their
energy into making it happen.
They're still chasing the growth
economy that is epitomized by
the development of the tractor
and the chemical fertilizers."
Lemmings have at least one
thing to recommend them
over mankind — at least when
they rush to their destruction,
•they do not drag the rest of the
planet with them. But mankind
has at least one thing to re
commend it over lemmings: at
least as it rushes to its destruc
tion, it can see where it is going
and attempt to stop before it is

too late.
It often
seems,
however,
that rather
than at
tempting to
stop our
sprint to
ward an
nihilation,

one part of
our species is actively engaged
in accelerating our progress
while the other part fiddles
marching tunes like a whole
race of carefree Neros. We find
our leaders more concerned
with their own destinies than
those of the people they are
supposed to lead; we find, in
fact, that they seem to have no
awareness of any destiny other
than their own. We find them
structuring our culture for
their own ends, without regard
for any future more distant
than the probable span of their
lives. We find an educational
system which perpetuates
their narrow-sightedness. We
at the summit of our culture
find ourselves in the midst of a
highly-sophisticated,
apparently-benign process
which teaches us to shut our
eyes and go faster.
But then it can not be de
nied: the power of vision has
not left us entirely; there are
those who do stretch their
necks to look around. It is no
doubt painful and traumatic to
take a long look at the destruc
tion which we are cultivating.
But there are, these people tell
us, other views, views as prom
ising as the scene immediately
before us is threatening. And,
hope being what it is, they are
working to divert our rush.
)eavons, obviously, is such a
man. He is not militant, anar
chistic, alienated, alienating or
bitter. As he says, "you don't
really need to change the sys
tem to live a better life."
leavons is just quietly pursuing
his work, doing what he can to
bring about an improvement in
the attitude of our culture.

The headquarters of the Syn
tex Corporation is located
on a hillside just west of Footh
ill Expressway, across from
Palo Alto's Veterans Administ
ration Hospital. A large cement
and glass building in the mod
ern architectural style, it sits on
a very green and well-groomed
lawn. At the foot of the hill,
however, literally a stone's
throw away from the
chemical-pharmaceuticals bas
tion, an incongruous sight pre
sents itself: a truck garden, in
the best tradition of truck gar
dens. It is a disorderly collage
of colors and textures — the
lush green of crops and weeds,
the crumbling dark brown of
newly turned earth, the dry
light brown of withered vege
tation, the dusty white sheen
of sheet plastic, the hard lustre
less gray of metal siding.

A casual passerby, observing
the two establishments, would
be likely to see in their proxim
ity the tension which often
exists between the new and
dynamic and the old and static.
Palo Aito, he might surmise, is
in the final stages of a
metamorphosis from the pas
toral to the cosmopolitan; the
garden, a quaint anachronism,
will soon be the site of yet
another corporate headquar
ters and the cement and glass
building on the hillside will ac
quire, by comparison, an air of
establishment and seniority.

Such is not the case, how
ever. Quite to the contrary, the
cement and glass building
antedates the garden; the land
on which the garden is located
is owned by the corporation
and worked by the garden's
proprietors under the terms of
a rent-free lease; the operation
of the garden is partially sub
sidized, with virtually no return
obligations, by the corpora
tion's donation, in addition to
the land, of water and funds. It
is an unusual situation, but it is
an unusual truck garden.
Foods ranging from grains to
fruit to beans to vegetables are
under cultivation there. The
yield of any given foodstuff at
any given harvest time typically
ranges from two to 31 times the
national, California or Santa
Clara County average
(whichever is higher). From
one-half to one-sixteenth the
average amount of water per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. From one-half to
one-sixteenth the average
amount of nitrogen fertilizer
per pound of food produced is
typically used. About one
one-hundredth the energy per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. No "chemical" fer
tilizer is used. Mo pesticides of
any type are used. No machin
ery more sophisticated than a
simple wheelbarrow is used.
And it is not uncommon to see
men and women in business
dress entering or leaving the
garden or engaged in some
phase of agriculture.
Despite these arresting facts,
the garden and its proprietors
remain surprisingly anonym
ous. Perhaps it is the
previously-described undis
tinguished character of the
former, or maybe it is the
quiet, unassuming style of the
latter. It may even be that it has
less to do with either the
former or latter than the nature
of the rest of the world. What
ever the case, it would be a
poor bet indeed to wager that
that anonymity is to be pre
served for very much longer.
Although I have been in
terested in food in general
and gardening in specific for
much of my life, the terms
"biodynamic" and "French in
tensive" remained obscure to
me until I made the acquain
tance of John leavons. An
alumnus of Yale and former
head of Business Services for
the Stanford library system,
leavons currently wields the

ponderous title of Director of
Agricultural Research for Ecol
ogy Action of the Midpenin
sula.
It is largely Jeavons who is
responsible for the present
shape — in both a physLal and
an abstract sense — of the ag
ricultural program underway
on the three and three-quarter
acre plot of Syntex land. It was
Jeavons who, after making a
study on his own initiative of
United Nations iand use and

population
figures, be
came con
vinced that
the planet
was still
capable of
feeding all
her in
habitants;
it was he
who, after
attending a
seminar on
the agricul
tural
techniques

synthesized by the Englishman
Alan Chadwick, sought out the
master horticulturalist in his
barren hillside-turned Garden
of Eden at the University of
California at Santa Cruz; it was
Jeavons who, after talking at
length with Chadwick, prop
osed the idea of a combined
research and community gar
den to the board of directors of
Ecology Action, a Palo Alto
conservation group which had
won recognition for a success
ful city-wide recycling prog-

ram; it was he who, after con
vincing them of the viability
and significance of such a
program, proceeded to as
semble the elements of Com
mon Ground — land, funds,
people — and embark on a
course of rigorous scientific
research.
The program is now in its
sixth year. Each succeeding
year has, according to Jeavons,
confirmed his faith in Chad
wick's techniques, known now
as the biodynamic-French in
tensive method.
When I first spoke with
leavons, I had a vague recollec
tion of a chapter in a gardening
book which had described a
"labor-intensive" system of
farming which allowed the
densely-populated countries
of western Europe to grow
much food on little land. This, I
imagined, was related to
"French-intensive" farming. In
his articulate and methodical
way, Jeavons soon clarified and
expanded this conception —
and made me realize how large
a topic this form of agriculture
had become.
"The method we're using
now," he said, "is made up of
two techniques that were de
veloped in Europe around the
turn of the century. The French
intensive method is one—that
reached its culmination in the
1890s outside Paris. What it did
was it raised vegetables in beds
that consisted of 18 inches of
horse manure — which was re
ally plentiful at the time. Be
cause of this high level of or
ganic matter and the fertility it
created, as well as the great
depth of loose material, roots
were able to grow downward
instead of needing room to
grow out horizontally. So they
were able to use very close
spacing."
This simple concept, leavons
continued, accounts for a sig
nificant part of the increased
yields which the method pro
duces. As jeavons phrased it in
a research report summarizing
Common Ground's first four
years, "A simple 24-inch deep
soil preparation allows the

plants to be spaced more
closely so that their leaves
touch or almost touch. . . .
This factor alone would make
fourfold yields possible be
cause four times as many
plants as usual can be planted
in a given area."
"The other technique,"
Jeavons told me, "was the
biodynamic technique. It was
developed in the 1920s by
Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian
genius who was into educa
tion, philosophy, religion, and
agriculture. The French inten
sive method had been de
veloped over hundreds of
years by French marchiers or
gardeners. The biodynamic
method, though, was de
veloped by Steiner in the late
'20s fora lot of wealthy German
farmers who had noticed that
their yields were going down
and they were getting more in
sect and disease problems. It
turned out they had been using
chemical fertilizers. Urea, a
kind of artifical nitrogen, had
been developed in the late
1880s. Steiner traced their
problems to the chemical fer
tilizers and suggested that they
return to some of their old
methods and adopt five special
practices. These practices be
camethe biodynamic method.
"One was the use of raised
beds — beds only 12 inches
deep prepared by raking soil
out of the path. This was going
back to the Greeks who found
out that plants grew better in
landslides. The raised beds as
they came to be dug were like
little, artificial landslides. The
reasons the plants do better in
them is because the soil is
looser and there's more air or
gases in it — you need up to 50
percent gases for good plant
growth."
jeavons frequently uses the
verb "dovetail" to describe
areas where two concepts in
termesh or compliment each
other. The deep soil prepara
tion and close spacing of the
French intensive method
dovetails, he said, with the "ar
tificial landslides" of the
biodynamic method to pro

duce healthier, more produc
tive plants.
"There was a study in the '50s
at the University of California
at Berkeley," he said, "that
showed that if you improved
root health by two to four per
cent for most common field
crops you could increase the
yields by 200 to 400 percent.
One of the things which can
make this possible is better soil
preparation and aeration. With
our method, you have more air
in the soil, more surface area
for contact between soil and air
since a raised bed has a curved
surface and also more surface
area to absorb rain or watering
and warmth from the sun. And
the curved surface also allows
you to increase the planting
area by 20 percent. Say you
have a plot of land that's a
hundred square feet and you
make it a raised bed, you can
wind up with 120 square feet of
planting area.
"The second technique that
Steiner recommended, after
the raised beds — which inci
dentally may even have gone
back even before the Greeks to
the Chinese, possibly 4000
years ago — was the use of or
ganic fertilizers. Chemical fer
tilizers at the time were mainly
just nitrogen or nitrogen and
phosphorous. They weren't
balanced or complete; they
needed trace minerals and
potash. Also the chemical fer
tilizers broke down very
quickly and harmed the texture
and structure of the soil and
killed the microbiotic life and

so forth. So Steiner asked the
German farmers to return to
organic fertilizers that were
more balanced and diverse —
like fish meal which has nitro
gen, phosphorous and trace
mi nerals and breaks down over
a period of six months instead
of four to six weeks.
"The third technique was
companion planting. There
were a lot of folk myths about
what things to grow well to
gether. Steiner tried to scienti
fically investigate this through
such techniques as
chromatography and crystalli
zation and field testing to de
termine which plants grown
together would do better. For
instance, one part chamomile
grown with two hundred parts
of wheat increases the health
and yield of wheat. But if its
one to one, one part
chamomile grown with one
part wheat, the wheat will be
destroyed, or at least seriously
harmed.
"Another technique was the
use of herbal sprays. At one
point they were almost a cult.
You take stinging nettles, for
example, and you do some
thing like — I can't remember
exactly — bury it three feet
under the ground at a certain
conjunction of the plants and
leave it under there for six
months and dig it up and mix it
in with a water solution and
then spray it on the ground. It's
supposed to stimulate the
micorobiotic life of the soil
which helps the plants. Really
far out, really unusual, but it
works.
"And the fifth thing was
planting by the phases of the
moon. The rationale for this
comes from seeing the moon's
effect on oceans — daily tides
of up to 40 feet in some parts of
the world. There's water in the
ground, in seeds and in plants
so it seems there might be a
small effect there.
"So those were the two
threads — the French intensive
method and Steiner's five
biodynamic techniques.
"Now, Chadwick, who is, I
think, a horticultural genius,

certainly a horticultural artist,
put these two techniques to
gether sometime between the
1930s and the 1960s when he
came to Santa Cruz. He had
been severely exasperated by
the second world war. A
woman named Freiavon Molka
and he got together and de
cided that one of the best ways
to bring peace and life and
harmony back into the world
was through gardens. Chad
wick had studied under the
French marchiers and he had
studied under Steiner. He's
had over 50 years of experience
in raising food. He also worked
under George Bernard Shaw in
drama, he's a painter, an actor,
an incredible individual — very
dramatic in his presentation of
things.
"When he put the two farm
ing techniques together, he
simplified them. Where
Steiner would make herbal
preparations, Chadwick would
just grow the herb, the stinging
nettle say, in the bed and then
put it in the compost pile and
let it have a living kind of influ
ence. Instead of using dead
mulches he used living mulch
— when the plants are so close
together that their leaves just
about touch, the ground is
shaded, moisture is con
served, a micro-climate is
created. So his whole orienta
tion is using living plants and
giving to nature as much as she
produces and even a little
more. If you give to nature
more than she gives you, she
will continually provide you
with abundance.
"So Chadwick prepares his
beds 24 inches deep, not just
18, he uses compost mainly
from vegetable matter, he uses
very little manure — in contrast
with the French and in contrast
with the other biodynamic
people who sometimes use a
lot of manure. This is important
worldwide because one-third
of the world's people now have
a different kind of energy
crisis: they don't have enough
firewood. So like in India,
they're burning the manure
from animals to heat their
homes and to cook their food.
There's a fertilizer shortage
there. But you don't need the
manure under Chadwick's
technique; most of it is veget
able compost, as I said.
"So he uses 24-inch-deep
soil preparation; close spac
ing; comparatively speaking, a
vegetarian or quasi-vegetarian
compost that's two-thirds veg
etable matter, one-third soil;
he uses living herbs rather than
herbal sprays, generally; he
uses some organic fertilizers,
mainly bone meal but not
much else; and he plants by
the phases of the moon."
/ / K| ow we started re-
searching the method
in 1972. Our purposes were
twofold. One was to document
how the method was done — it
had never been documented
in written form because Chad
wick doesn't believe in the
written word but by handing
things down by example and
by word of mouth, master to
apprentice and so forth. Also it
had been reputed that the
method produced four times
the average yield, but this had
never been documented one
way or another.
"The lot Syntex gave us had a
soil which was one-third rock
— meaning pebbles and stuff.
Normal agricultural soil is
maybe five percent rock, not 33
percent. In addition, our soil
was over one-third clay. There
was no nitrogen fertilizer in the
soil and just a trace of phos
phorous and potash.
"During our first five years
we got very encouraging re
sults — yields which ranged
anywhere from two to 16 times
the U.S., Santa Clara County or
California averages. Then in
1976, I developed a new

technique called 'superdig
ging' which is a sort of a super
texturizing technique. This
technique improves the soil
more rapidly. It takes up to five
years using normal techniques
to improve the soil. Re
member, we were in subsoil
clay with no top soil at all. As a
result of this new technique,
this year we've gone as high as
about 60 times the Santa Clara
County average with zucchini
using about two percent of the
water per pound of food pro
duced and one percent of the
added nitrogen fertilizer per
pound of food produced. In
the case of grain, we're as high
as two and a quarter times the
national average on soybeans,

double on
wheat and
expect to
go six to
eight times
for those
yields.
Also, we
expect to
be using
one third to
one-eighth
the water
per pound
of grain
produced
— and that
could be
significant
because it
means you

could be getting very high
grain yields with as little as
eight or 10 inches of rainfall.
Over 75 percent of the arable
area of the world has 10 or
more inches of rainfall.
"An interesting thing is that
the Zulus of South Africa use a
similar technique — similar to
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method, that is, that they
developed on their own. It's a
triple-digging technique, lust
before it rains they prepare the
soil three feet deep and as
soon as it does rain they plant
their grain. It doesn't rain all
summer and is very dry. They
grow grain when no one else
can grow grain anywhere. So
here's a similar technique
that's working under natural
rainfall conditions.
"What this means is that if
we reach all of our projections,
we would be getting an aver
age of four to eight times on
vegetables and six to eight
times the average yield on
grain. And these yields, by the
way are already being obtained
somewhere else in the world
on the average — and on a
large scale basis. A way to high
light this is to say that for every
major crop grown in the Un
ited States, some other country
in the world on the average is
getting a yield about twice as
high. So U.S. agriculture,
though it may look good, is not
the best with all crops."
One morning soon after our
first conversation, I met
Jeavons for a tour of the Com
mon Ground garden. He is
plainly in his element there. A
fairly large man in his mid-30s
he sports an incipient pot belly
and a voluminous though
well-behaved beard. He was
dressed in mud-spattered
work pants, a heavy flannel
shirt and a sweat-stained
leather cap. He generally main
tains a serious demeanor al
though when he smiles he re
veals a considerable capacity
for simple delight. His eyes
especially, manifest his posi
tive attitude: whether engaged
in a visual analysis of crop
progress, gazing at clouds in
the distance or glancing at his
auditor, they are intelligent,
energetic, unusually alive.
He took me first to some
thing he called an "herbal
lawn." From a distance, this
looked similar to a grass lawn
— green and flat. Standing next
to it, however, I saw that its

color was not uniform. In
terspersed among the light
green of sweet clover were
plants of darker shades —
identified by Jeavons as Roman
chamomile, creeping thyme
and dwarf yarrow. In addition
to being "simple and beauti
ful," Jeavons said, the lawn
fixes nitrogen in the soil and
concentrates phosphorous
and potash in its leaves. It is
thus beneficial to the soil on
which it is grown and can be
mown as a source of
nutriment-rich compost.
For the next hour we looked
at such things as newly-planted
fruit trees, fragrant and useful
herbs, fallow planting beds,
freshly-prepared planting

beds, planting beds overflow
ing with mature vegetables and
legumes, and recently har
vested planting beds. All the
while Jeavons kept up an in
teresting commentary filled
with odd facts and anecdotes.
"You see those nicely dug beds
over there?" he asked at one
point. "Those were prepared
by a 65-year-old woman with a
heart condition."
Finally, he led me to a
fenced-off area with a pad
locked gate. "This is the re
search garden," he said.
"What we've been looking at is
the community garden. People
from all over, including about
five to 10 percent of all the Syn
tex employees, are involved
with raising food here."
Inside the research garden
were rows of beds each about
six feet wide and 20 feet long. I
was slightly disappointed by
the modest dimensions of the
whole garden — smaller than
that occupied by the average
house — since it seemed that
something larger would be re
quired for such significant re
search.
"This area is about 2500
square feet," Jeavons said as if
reading my thoughts. "Our re
search indicates that a com
pletely balanced diet could be
grown on this much space —
and with as little as a half hour
of work a day. The same
amount of food, if it were
grown by U.S. chemical,
mechanized techniques would
take 10,000 square feet. In In
dia, the same diet would take
32,000 square feet.
"Now, the average American
eats 322 pounds of vegetables
and soft fruits — fruits like
strawberries, cantalopes and
watermelon — a year. Two
hundred and twenty of those
pounds are potatoes. You can
grow that amount of vegeta
bles with the biodynamic-
French intensive method in 100
square feet in a four to six
month growing season. In the
case of fruit trees, you can put
two of them in a hundred
square foot bed on eight foot
centers. Each of those fruit
trees should produce a
hundred pounds of hard fruit
per year and the average
American eats 162 pounds of
hard fruit a year. It should take
you maybe a half a minute to a
minute a day to take care of the
trees on an average basis and it
should take you about five to
10 minutes a day to take care of

the vegetable bed.
"So what we're talking about
is eventually people can start
raising a fair amount of their
food just in their back yard. A
family of four, in 400 square
feet, could raise in a four to six
month growing season food
worth $480 in five to 10 minutes
a day each. Their labor would
then be worth $4 to $8 an hour.
Now a person is probably not
going to do this the first year if
he's never gardened before,
but he's going to do a lot better
than he's done with other
techniques. What this means
for overseas, for India, for
example, where they have fer
tilizer shortages, energy shor
tages, water shortages and
food shortages, is that in a
small area, say 2500 to 7000
square feet they could raise
their total diet rather than in
32,000 square feet. So small is
beautiful: in this country, de
escalation of technology; for
overseas, a move to more self
sufficiency."
We moved to a bed with
some dried leaves and with
ered stalks in it which I recog
nized as potatoes, leavons
went on.
"Now in monetary terms,
with potatoes, we're now at
four times the national average
but we expect to go much
higher— maybe well above 20.
We're still experimenting with
that. I can't tell you on the re
cord how high we expect to go
but I can say on the record it's
over 20. With zucchini, when
we got only 16 times the Santa
Clara county average, the bed
produced $12.50 an hour — or
would have if we'd sold it all at
the wholesale rate. Now that
we're up to 60, we're talking
about producing three times
that or $37.50 an hour. This is
an extreme case but it should
be possible to earn a minimum
of $4 an hour just raising your
own vegetables.
"We're guessing that a new
kind of job or profession will
come out of all of this — mini
farming. We estimate that it
will be possible for one person
working a 40-hour week to
raise $15,000 net on as little as a
quarter of an acre. Currently
small farmers with farms of 200
to4oo acres are lucky if they net
several thousand dollars.
"So our philosophy is one of
low techonology, that is, simple
technology but sophisticated
theory. And I should say that
we're not a 'labor-intensive'
method as many people have
said we are. It's actually 'skill
intensive.' Bed preparation
may be the hardest job of the
method but once the soil is in
good shape and using a new
device that they've developed
in Canada, it should be possi
ble to prepare a bed in five to
10 minutes.
"All the resources that we
need to raise food right are av
ailable— we're just using them
in the wrong way. Take wheat
production, for example.
Normally to produce more
grain you have to use a lot
more fertilizer. For instance
with corn, from 1940 to 1960,
the nitrogen fertilizer use in
creased 10-fold, but the yields
only doubled. So your fertilizer
effectiveness was only one
fifth as good in 1960 as it was in
1940. Well, we cut our nitrogen
fertilizer use in one year to
one-half and the yield dou
bled. At the same time the pro
tein content increased. It went
from 14.8 percent to 15.7.
Normally when your yields go
up, your protein content per
pound of food goes down. Plus
we used less water and less
energy, less phosphorous and
less potash.
"Eventually, if we get all the
projections that we expect to
get, we'll be producing as
much food per hour as people
with machines can produce. So
this makes the individual im

portant again and gives the in
dividual a choice.
"I should stress that we've
got a ways to go yet. We don't
have a perfect system. We have
failures; we haven't reached all
our projections, but we've had
a lot of good results too.
"Right now, we think if the
method has an Achilles heel, it
will be in the net flow of or
ganic matter in and out of the
soil. We may have to face the
possibility that with the yields
we're now getting, we'll
exhaust the soil in a few more
years. The most important
thing about an agricultural
method is whether it is sustain
able in an environmentally ba
lanced way. The Chinese have
been able for hundreds of
years to grow twice as much
food as the United States does
now. And by using manual, or
ganic techniques and fertiliz
ers grown or produced on their
farms. But we may have to face
the possibility that our sustain
able yield level will be less than
our optimum yield level."
Jeavons turned away from
the potato bed and regarded
me fora moment, as if to make
sure I had understood every
thing up to that point. After tak
ing a deep breath, he turned
and pointed to a pair of
plastic-covered structures
which were, evidently,
greenhouses. One was very
similar in appearance to a con
ventional greenhouse but the
other one was only three feet
high and just covered one
hundred-square-foot bed.
"Now with these miniature
greenhouses," Jeavons said,
"a 12-month growing season is
possible in most climates
where food is grown. What this
means is you could grow your
total diet on as little as 1250
square feet working as little as
15 minutes a day." He walked
to the center of the area and
spread his arms. "That's this
much," he said, his tone imply
ing how little he thought 1250
square feet to be. I was a little
incredulous for a moment be
cause the space he indicated
really seemed no larger than
the average living room. But
then I remembered that an
acre is somewhat more than
40,000 square feet. I had no
trouble believing that the de
signated area was about a thir
tieth of an acre. "And, he said,
with a smile, "even though it's
too early to say on the record,
we expect to go much, much
lower than that to grow a total
diet."

In 1840 the German chemist
Justus von Liebig published a
paper entitled "Chemistry in
its application to agriculture
and physiology." This event,
giving birth to a whole new ap •
proach to the cultivation of
food — which I will call "chem
ical agriculture" — intruded
into the gradual evolution of
farming with all the virulence
of a malignant tumor.
It is true that relatively little
change had taken place in ag
riculture since the dawn of
civilization — 4000 years or

more if one goes back to the
Chinese farmers mentioned by
Jeavons; it is true that during
the period in which chemical
agriculture was developed in
earnest — from the 1880s to the
1920s — the world's population
was growing at a heretofore
unimaginable rate; and it is
true that many well
intentioned people saw in
chemical agriculture the only
means of putting food in the
staggering number of new and
hungry mouths.
It is also true, however, that
concurrent with the rise of
chemical agriculture were the
several great strides outlined
by Jeavons — the strides which
developed in a relatively short
time into the biodynamic-
French intensive method. As
chemical agriculture
burgeoned into an industry
and an orthodoxy, men such as
Rudolf Steiner — and he was
far from alone — recognized
the folly of abandoning
methods proven over millenia
for new and untried
techniques. On the next occa
sion on which I met with
jeavons, I asked him what he
believed were the causes for
the headlong rush toward
chemicals in the face of saner
councils.
"Well, part of the reason,"
he said, "was that as chemical
fertilizers came into play, trac
tors were being developed and
brought into use on many
farms. This made it possible to
spread chemical fertilizer very
easily. It was less time
consuming than spreading
manures. Also, with the tractor
you were able to farm large
areas. Even though it wasn't in
tensive, you could farm a large
area and produce a lot of food
in a very short time. The prom
ise of opening up increased ac
reage was very seductive. To
most people, two to four times
the area meant two to four
times the food. On the other
hand, the French intensive cul
ture that was developed out
side Paris required an awful lot
of people per acre. So with
everyone getting caught up in
the petrochemical
mechanized revolution, the
tendency was to equate 'faster'
with 'more and better.' Which
for a short time was probably
true. But if we get into today's
period, the petrochemicals are
getting more expensive so
spending more time and labor
to get the same amount of food
isn't as unappealing as it used
to be. But more important, I

believe,
from the
perspective
of our re
search, is
that we be
lieve we're
going to be
able to
produce as
much food
per hour as
a machine
can — by
hand. The
way that
we're going
to be able
to do this is
by thinking
about

what's been done in the past,
about what's being done cur
rently, and maximizing the
simplicity which produces the
time efficiency."
During the course of the last
half century, many of the
spokesmen for non-chemical
agriculture have found them
selves ostracized for their be
liefs and techniques. At best
they have been ignored by the
academic and political estab
lishment, at worst they have
been actively harassed and
obstructed in presenting their
cases before the public. One of


these men, Sir Albert Howard,
an Imperial Botanist for the In
dian government, "did some
fantastic things," according to
Jeavons. "Everyone had told
him he couldn't grow cotton
organically in India because
the pests would eat it up. It
took him a while but at the end
of five years, he was growing
cotton organically — with no
pesticides. He had less crop
loss than the people who were
using pesticides."
Although knighted for this
and other accomplishments,
Howard received so much pub
lic ridicule — both from fer-

tilizer in
dustry
spokesmen
and his fel
low scien
tists — that
his ideas
went
widely un
heeded.
Howard
wrote, after

addressing one particularly
nonreceptive audience of
botanists, "Here again I was
amazed by the limited know
ledge and experience of the
world's agriculturalists dis
closed by this debate. I felt I
was dealing with beginners
and that some of the argu
ments put forward could al
most be described as the im
pertinences of ignorance."
In this country, the case of
|.l. Rodale, whose publications
are among the standard refer
ences for a large segment of
the organic farming popula
tion, is not unusual. Rodale
was forced to spend almost a
quarter of a million dollars in
legal fees to win a court deci
sion over the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission which had
blocked the publication of his
book "The Health Finder."
I asked )eavons whether he
thought these examples indi
cated the presence of an estab
lishment which had a vested in
terest in the development and
maintenance of chemical ag
riculture irrespective of the
best interests of mankind. It
was true, he said, that
"businessmen are always
ready to take advantage of a
good thing and push it to the
fullest," but there were proba
bly "two separate thrusts" —
business incentives and desire
for greater efficiency — which
"then became merged."
leavons then related an in
teresting anecdote, most of
which had to remain off the re
cord, which was a telling
statement about the present
state of agricultural research.
"It was amazing to me," he
said, "that agricultural schools
are not more interested in re
search like that (Howard's),
and in trying to replicate it — at
least as an alternative ap
proach. I wrote a letter to an
individual who was involved in
agricultural research at a col
lege here in California. I told
him I was confused. In the light
of some of the possibilities we
were uncovering with the
biodynamic-French intensive
method, why wasn't anyone
investigating our results. He
wrote me back a very good let
ter. He indicated that the re
search money is coming from
thechemical industriesand the
agricultural interests. They
have an interest in using the
system they've already got.
And again, their purpose is
making money from it, not
necessarily making it better. So
you see, the professors almost
have to ridicule alternative
methods. If they go into other
areas, they become profes
sionally ostracized and they
can't get funds."
leavons continued with
another anecdote, this time
regarding a conference about
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method which was held

last year in Santa Barbara. Sev
eral members of the American
Society of Agronomy had at
tended, he said, and had asked
questions about the
mechanisms of the improved
plant growth. "If we couldn't
tell them exactly how it was
happening, in their terms and
language, they wouldn't give it
very much credence. Someone
pointed out that the Romans
knew how to make concrete a
long time before anyone knew
why it worked. There's a kind
of scientific myopia here. It's
like they're saying, you can
only be scientific if you're sci
entific in the way in which we
are scientific. Well, good lord,
if someone's demonstrating
that something is possible,
anyone who's really an open
minded scientist ought to be
excited and interested to find
out why it's possible. But there
aren't any funds for them to do
it."
leavons is not alone in his
observation of "scientific
myopia" in the present
academic community. In April,
1973, Nicholas Wade reported
in Science magazine that "a
blue-ribbon committee of
basic and agricultural scien
tists" found that "the basic re
search performed by federal
and state agricultural research
organizations is of meager
quality, suffers from a 'shock
ing lack of intellectual leader
ship' and is guided by policies
detrimental to the interests of
agriculture."
Although no reference was
made to a lack of attention to
any specific area of research,
University of Chicago Biology
Prof. Richard Levins wrote in a
later issue of Science that "the
issues raised by Nicholas
Wade's report have to be set
into a broader context than
simply the policies of the U.S.
Department of Agricul
ture. . . . Within agricultural
science, America's traditional
anti-intellectualism survives as
an antitheoretical bias. . . .It is
reinforced by the search for
marketable products (mostly
chemical) as the central
strategy for improvement of
agriculture . . . and by a nar
row acceptance of the present
structure of agriculture as a
given condition which restricts
options. For example, the con
sideration of mixed plantings is
inhibited by the present design
of farm machinery."
The tone of both articles asks
the question, "Ought we to let
this happen?" The tone taken
increasingly by more and more
far-sighted scientists today,
however, is "Can we afford to
let this happen?" jeavons him
self points to the dwindling
supply of natural gas — the
current reserves of which are
slated to run out in about a de
cade — as one factor which
could lead to an agricultural
disaster. Since the production
of artificial nitrogen fertilizer
has been made almost wholly
dependent on natural gas, he
says, and since there is evi-

dence indi
cating that
nitrogen fi
xation from
the air by
soil bac
teria stops
in the pre
sence of ar
tificial fer
tilizer
which in

turn causes a soil "addiction"
to this form of fertilizer, it
seems likely that we will be
faced with the necessity of
using pollution-producing coal
to satisfy our farmlands'
"habit." And even the coal
supply will someday be
exhausted.
Yet even if the scarcity of
energy were not an issue, the
question would still be a valid
one. In addition to beini:


ecologically unsound, our pre
sent system of food production
is economically and technolog
ically unsatisfactory for a large
segment of the world's popula
tion. As Frances Moore Lappe
and ]oseph Collins de
monstrate in their book, Food
First, the expensive technology
and inflated prices which "ag
ribusiness" and its "global
supermarket" force on unde
veloped nations do as much to
hinder their progress as any
other single factor.
Jeavons' belief is that the
solution to many of the world's
food-related problems —
ecological, economical and
technological — lies in a global
move to small-scale farming. A
February, 1976 paper released
by Ecology Action states that
"the current food shortages
will worsen into a crisis of
global proportions unless the
productivity of the 100 million
small farms in the developing
world is increased dramati
cally. Several key points make
the biodynamic-Fiench inten
sive method especially viable
in countries with limited re
sources: The method does not
require complicated machin
ery or expensive fertilizers.
The key technological element
is the common shovel. The
method uses 1/2 to 1/16 the wa
ter. This will be especially valu
able in arid areas of the world,
or those limited to natural rain
fall. The method provides a
self-sufficient livelihood in
areas of high unemployment.
The method's diversified ap
proach encourages intercrop
ping with local foods, thus of
fering a varied diet. The
method builds a healthy soil,
the key to dependable food
production and the building of
a stable economic and social
system."
And, according to a paper
co-authored by leavons, "The
small farm, all factors consi
dered, is actually a more effi
cient unit of production than
its large-scale counterpart. To
quote Sterling Wortman of the
Rockerfeller Foundation, . .
most large-scale mechanized
agriculture is less productive
per unit area than small scale
farming can be. The farmer on
a small holding can engage in
intensive high yield gardening,
systems such as intercropping,
multiple cropping, relay plant
ing or other techniques that
require attention to individual
plants. The point is that
mechanized agriculture is very
productive in terms of output
per man-year, but it is not as
productive per unit of land as
the highly intensive systems
are.' Much of the economic
advantage large farms now
enjoy is not due to any stream
lining inherent in their size but
in the tax structures and sub
sidies which favor corporate
'tax loss' farming, land specula
tion, and vertical stratification
of the food industry from pro
duction of fertilizers, to farm
ing, to packaging and distribu
tion of food products."
Jeavons is generally unop
timistic

about the
prospects
for a rapid
change
from our
current ag
ricultural
practices,
projecting
50years as a
minimum

before such a transformation
will be started on a large scale.
"The thing that has always con
fused me," he told me, "is why
so few people have asked why
can't we keep the organic,
small-scale simplicity and also
have the sophistication of
modern science. I think one
reason why people don't get
into that too much is because
they're thinking on a closed

system basis — and it gets away
from a growth economy.
There's no audience for this in
this country, very few people
living that kind of lifestyle.
They're not putting their
energy into making it happen.
They're still chasing the growth
economy that is epitomized by
the development of the tractor
and the chemical fertilizers."
Lemmings have at least one
thing to recommend them
over mankind — at least when
they rush to their destruction,
•they do not drag the rest of the
planet with them. But mankind
has at least one thing to re
commend it over lemmings: at
least as it rushes to its destruc
tion, it can see where it is going
and attempt to stop before it is

too late.
It often
seems,
however,
that rather
than at
tempting to
stop our
sprint to
ward an
nihilation,

one part of
our species is actively engaged
in accelerating our progress
while the other part fiddles
marching tunes like a whole
race of carefree Neros. We find
our leaders more concerned
with their own destinies than
those of the people they are
supposed to lead; we find, in
fact, that they seem to have no
awareness of any destiny other
than their own. We find them
structuring our culture for
their own ends, without regard
for any future more distant
than the probable span of their
lives. We find an educational
system which perpetuates
their narrow-sightedness. We
at the summit of our culture
find ourselves in the midst of a
highly-sophisticated,
apparently-benign process
which teaches us to shut our
eyes and go faster.
But then it can not be de
nied: the power of vision has
not left us entirely; there are
those who do stretch their
necks to look around. It is no
doubt painful and traumatic to
take a long look at the destruc
tion which we are cultivating.
But there are, these people tell
us, other views, views as prom
ising as the scene immediately
before us is threatening. And,
hope being what it is, they are
working to divert our rush.
)eavons, obviously, is such a
man. He is not militant, anar
chistic, alienated, alienating or
bitter. As he says, "you don't
really need to change the sys
tem to live a better life."
leavons is just quietly pursuing
his work, doing what he can to
bring about an improvement in
the attitude of our culture.

Grow More Vegetables Than
You Ever Thought Possible
On Less Land Than You Can

The headquarters of the Syn
tex Corporation is located
on a hillside just west of Footh
ill Expressway, across from
Palo Alto's Veterans Administ
ration Hospital. A large cement
and glass building in the mod
ern architectural style, it sits on
a very green and well-groomed
lawn. At the foot of the hill,
however, literally a stone's
throw away from the
chemical-pharmaceuticals bas
tion, an incongruous sight pre
sents itself: a truck garden, in
the best tradition of truck gar
dens. It is a disorderly collage
of colors and textures — the
lush green of crops and weeds,
the crumbling dark brown of
newly turned earth, the dry
light brown of withered vege
tation, the dusty white sheen
of sheet plastic, the hard lustre
less gray of metal siding.

A casual passerby, observing
the two establishments, would
be likely to see in their proxim
ity the tension which often
exists between the new and
dynamic and the old and static.
Palo Aito, he might surmise, is
in the final stages of a
metamorphosis from the pas
toral to the cosmopolitan; the
garden, a quaint anachronism,
will soon be the site of yet
another corporate headquar
ters and the cement and glass
building on the hillside will ac
quire, by comparison, an air of
establishment and seniority.

Such is not the case, how
ever. Quite to the contrary, the
cement and glass building
antedates the garden; the land
on which the garden is located
is owned by the corporation
and worked by the garden's
proprietors under the terms of
a rent-free lease; the operation
of the garden is partially sub
sidized, with virtually no return
obligations, by the corpora
tion's donation, in addition to
the land, of water and funds. It
is an unusual situation, but it is
an unusual truck garden.
Foods ranging from grains to
fruit to beans to vegetables are
under cultivation there. The
yield of any given foodstuff at
any given harvest time typically
ranges from two to 31 times the
national, California or Santa
Clara County average
(whichever is higher). From
one-half to one-sixteenth the
average amount of water per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. From one-half to
one-sixteenth the average
amount of nitrogen fertilizer
per pound of food produced is
typically used. About one
one-hundredth the energy per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. No "chemical" fer
tilizer is used. Mo pesticides of
any type are used. No machin
ery more sophisticated than a
simple wheelbarrow is used.
And it is not uncommon to see
men and women in business
dress entering or leaving the
garden or engaged in some
phase of agriculture.
Despite these arresting facts,
the garden and its proprietors
remain surprisingly anonym
ous. Perhaps it is the
previously-described undis
tinguished character of the
former, or maybe it is the
quiet, unassuming style of the
latter. It may even be that it has
less to do with either the
former or latter than the nature
of the rest of the world. What
ever the case, it would be a
poor bet indeed to wager that
that anonymity is to be pre
served for very much longer.
Although I have been in
terested in food in general
and gardening in specific for
much of my life, the terms
"biodynamic" and "French in
tensive" remained obscure to
me until I made the acquain
tance of John leavons. An
alumnus of Yale and former
head of Business Services for
the Stanford library system,
leavons currently wields the

ponderous title of Director of
Agricultural Research for Ecol
ogy Action of the Midpenin
sula.
It is largely Jeavons who is
responsible for the present
shape — in both a physLal and
an abstract sense — of the ag
ricultural program underway
on the three and three-quarter
acre plot of Syntex land. It was
Jeavons who, after making a
study on his own initiative of
United Nations iand use and

population
figures, be
came con
vinced that
the planet
was still
capable of
feeding all
her in
habitants;
it was he
who, after
attending a
seminar on
the agricul
tural
techniques

synthesized by the Englishman
Alan Chadwick, sought out the
master horticulturalist in his
barren hillside-turned Garden
of Eden at the University of
California at Santa Cruz; it was
Jeavons who, after talking at
length with Chadwick, prop
osed the idea of a combined
research and community gar
den to the board of directors of
Ecology Action, a Palo Alto
conservation group which had
won recognition for a success
ful city-wide recycling prog-

ram; it was he who, after con
vincing them of the viability
and significance of such a
program, proceeded to as
semble the elements of Com
mon Ground — land, funds,
people — and embark on a
course of rigorous scientific
research.
The program is now in its
sixth year. Each succeeding
year has, according to Jeavons,
confirmed his faith in Chad
wick's techniques, known now
as the biodynamic-French in
tensive method.
When I first spoke with
leavons, I had a vague recollec
tion of a chapter in a gardening
book which had described a
"labor-intensive" system of
farming which allowed the
densely-populated countries
of western Europe to grow
much food on little land. This, I
imagined, was related to
"French-intensive" farming. In
his articulate and methodical
way, Jeavons soon clarified and
expanded this conception —
and made me realize how large
a topic this form of agriculture
had become.
"The method we're using
now," he said, "is made up of
two techniques that were de
veloped in Europe around the
turn of the century. The French
intensive method is one—that
reached its culmination in the
1890s outside Paris. What it did
was it raised vegetables in beds
that consisted of 18 inches of
horse manure — which was re
ally plentiful at the time. Be
cause of this high level of or
ganic matter and the fertility it
created, as well as the great
depth of loose material, roots
were able to grow downward
instead of needing room to
grow out horizontally. So they
were able to use very close
spacing."
This simple concept, leavons
continued, accounts for a sig
nificant part of the increased
yields which the method pro
duces. As jeavons phrased it in
a research report summarizing
Common Ground's first four
years, "A simple 24-inch deep
soil preparation allows the

plants to be spaced more
closely so that their leaves
touch or almost touch. . . .
This factor alone would make
fourfold yields possible be
cause four times as many
plants as usual can be planted
in a given area."
"The other technique,"
Jeavons told me, "was the
biodynamic technique. It was
developed in the 1920s by
Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian
genius who was into educa
tion, philosophy, religion, and
agriculture. The French inten
sive method had been de
veloped over hundreds of
years by French marchiers or
gardeners. The biodynamic
method, though, was de
veloped by Steiner in the late
'20s fora lot of wealthy German
farmers who had noticed that
their yields were going down
and they were getting more in
sect and disease problems. It
turned out they had been using
chemical fertilizers. Urea, a
kind of artifical nitrogen, had
been developed in the late
1880s. Steiner traced their
problems to the chemical fer
tilizers and suggested that they
return to some of their old
methods and adopt five special
practices. These practices be
camethe biodynamic method.
"One was the use of raised
beds — beds only 12 inches
deep prepared by raking soil
out of the path. This was going
back to the Greeks who found
out that plants grew better in
landslides. The raised beds as
they came to be dug were like
little, artificial landslides. The
reasons the plants do better in
them is because the soil is
looser and there's more air or
gases in it — you need up to 50
percent gases for good plant
growth."
jeavons frequently uses the
verb "dovetail" to describe
areas where two concepts in
termesh or compliment each
other. The deep soil prepara
tion and close spacing of the
French intensive method
dovetails, he said, with the "ar
tificial landslides" of the
biodynamic method to pro

duce healthier, more produc
tive plants.
"There was a study in the '50s
at the University of California
at Berkeley," he said, "that
showed that if you improved
root health by two to four per
cent for most common field
crops you could increase the
yields by 200 to 400 percent.
One of the things which can
make this possible is better soil
preparation and aeration. With
our method, you have more air
in the soil, more surface area
for contact between soil and air
since a raised bed has a curved
surface and also more surface
area to absorb rain or watering
and warmth from the sun. And
the curved surface also allows
you to increase the planting
area by 20 percent. Say you
have a plot of land that's a
hundred square feet and you
make it a raised bed, you can
wind up with 120 square feet of
planting area.
"The second technique that
Steiner recommended, after
the raised beds — which inci
dentally may even have gone
back even before the Greeks to
the Chinese, possibly 4000
years ago — was the use of or
ganic fertilizers. Chemical fer
tilizers at the time were mainly
just nitrogen or nitrogen and
phosphorous. They weren't
balanced or complete; they
needed trace minerals and
potash. Also the chemical fer
tilizers broke down very
quickly and harmed the texture
and structure of the soil and
killed the microbiotic life and

so forth. So Steiner asked the
German farmers to return to
organic fertilizers that were
more balanced and diverse —
like fish meal which has nitro
gen, phosphorous and trace
mi nerals and breaks down over
a period of six months instead
of four to six weeks.
"The third technique was
companion planting. There
were a lot of folk myths about
what things to grow well to
gether. Steiner tried to scienti
fically investigate this through
such techniques as
chromatography and crystalli
zation and field testing to de
termine which plants grown
together would do better. For
instance, one part chamomile
grown with two hundred parts
of wheat increases the health
and yield of wheat. But if its
one to one, one part
chamomile grown with one
part wheat, the wheat will be
destroyed, or at least seriously
harmed.
"Another technique was the
use of herbal sprays. At one
point they were almost a cult.
You take stinging nettles, for
example, and you do some
thing like — I can't remember
exactly — bury it three feet
under the ground at a certain
conjunction of the plants and
leave it under there for six
months and dig it up and mix it
in with a water solution and
then spray it on the ground. It's
supposed to stimulate the
micorobiotic life of the soil
which helps the plants. Really
far out, really unusual, but it
works.
"And the fifth thing was
planting by the phases of the
moon. The rationale for this
comes from seeing the moon's
effect on oceans — daily tides
of up to 40 feet in some parts of
the world. There's water in the
ground, in seeds and in plants
so it seems there might be a
small effect there.
"So those were the two
threads — the French intensive
method and Steiner's five
biodynamic techniques.
"Now, Chadwick, who is, I
think, a horticultural genius,

certainly a horticultural artist,
put these two techniques to
gether sometime between the
1930s and the 1960s when he
came to Santa Cruz. He had
been severely exasperated by
the second world war. A
woman named Freiavon Molka
and he got together and de
cided that one of the best ways
to bring peace and life and
harmony back into the world
was through gardens. Chad
wick had studied under the
French marchiers and he had
studied under Steiner. He's
had over 50 years of experience
in raising food. He also worked
under George Bernard Shaw in
drama, he's a painter, an actor,
an incredible individual — very
dramatic in his presentation of
things.
"When he put the two farm
ing techniques together, he
simplified them. Where
Steiner would make herbal
preparations, Chadwick would
just grow the herb, the stinging
nettle say, in the bed and then
put it in the compost pile and
let it have a living kind of influ
ence. Instead of using dead
mulches he used living mulch
— when the plants are so close
together that their leaves just
about touch, the ground is
shaded, moisture is con
served, a micro-climate is
created. So his whole orienta
tion is using living plants and
giving to nature as much as she
produces and even a little
more. If you give to nature
more than she gives you, she
will continually provide you
with abundance.
"So Chadwick prepares his
beds 24 inches deep, not just
18, he uses compost mainly
from vegetable matter, he uses
very little manure — in contrast
with the French and in contrast
with the other biodynamic
people who sometimes use a
lot of manure. This is important
worldwide because one-third
of the world's people now have
a different kind of energy
crisis: they don't have enough
firewood. So like in India,
they're burning the manure
from animals to heat their
homes and to cook their food.
There's a fertilizer shortage
there. But you don't need the
manure under Chadwick's
technique; most of it is veget
able compost, as I said.
"So he uses 24-inch-deep
soil preparation; close spac
ing; comparatively speaking, a
vegetarian or quasi-vegetarian
compost that's two-thirds veg
etable matter, one-third soil;
he uses living herbs rather than
herbal sprays, generally; he
uses some organic fertilizers,
mainly bone meal but not
much else; and he plants by
the phases of the moon."
/ / K| ow we started re-
searching the method
in 1972. Our purposes were
twofold. One was to document
how the method was done — it
had never been documented
in written form because Chad
wick doesn't believe in the
written word but by handing
things down by example and
by word of mouth, master to
apprentice and so forth. Also it
had been reputed that the
method produced four times
the average yield, but this had
never been documented one
way or another.
"The lot Syntex gave us had a
soil which was one-third rock
— meaning pebbles and stuff.
Normal agricultural soil is
maybe five percent rock, not 33
percent. In addition, our soil
was over one-third clay. There
was no nitrogen fertilizer in the
soil and just a trace of phos
phorous and potash.
"During our first five years
we got very encouraging re
sults — yields which ranged
anywhere from two to 16 times
the U.S., Santa Clara County or
California averages. Then in
1976, I developed a new

technique called 'superdig
ging' which is a sort of a super
texturizing technique. This
technique improves the soil
more rapidly. It takes up to five
years using normal techniques
to improve the soil. Re
member, we were in subsoil
clay with no top soil at all. As a
result of this new technique,
this year we've gone as high as
about 60 times the Santa Clara
County average with zucchini
using about two percent of the
water per pound of food pro
duced and one percent of the
added nitrogen fertilizer per
pound of food produced. In
the case of grain, we're as high
as two and a quarter times the
national average on soybeans,

double on
wheat and
expect to
go six to
eight times
for those
yields.
Also, we
expect to
be using
one third to
one-eighth
the water
per pound
of grain
produced
— and that
could be
significant
because it
means you

could be getting very high
grain yields with as little as
eight or 10 inches of rainfall.
Over 75 percent of the arable
area of the world has 10 or
more inches of rainfall.
"An interesting thing is that
the Zulus of South Africa use a
similar technique — similar to
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method, that is, that they
developed on their own. It's a
triple-digging technique, lust
before it rains they prepare the
soil three feet deep and as
soon as it does rain they plant
their grain. It doesn't rain all
summer and is very dry. They
grow grain when no one else
can grow grain anywhere. So
here's a similar technique
that's working under natural
rainfall conditions.
"What this means is that if
we reach all of our projections,
we would be getting an aver
age of four to eight times on
vegetables and six to eight
times the average yield on
grain. And these yields, by the
way are already being obtained
somewhere else in the world
on the average — and on a
large scale basis. A way to high
light this is to say that for every
major crop grown in the Un
ited States, some other country
in the world on the average is
getting a yield about twice as
high. So U.S. agriculture,
though it may look good, is not
the best with all crops."
One morning soon after our
first conversation, I met
Jeavons for a tour of the Com
mon Ground garden. He is
plainly in his element there. A
fairly large man in his mid-30s
he sports an incipient pot belly
and a voluminous though
well-behaved beard. He was
dressed in mud-spattered
work pants, a heavy flannel
shirt and a sweat-stained
leather cap. He generally main
tains a serious demeanor al
though when he smiles he re
veals a considerable capacity
for simple delight. His eyes
especially, manifest his posi
tive attitude: whether engaged
in a visual analysis of crop
progress, gazing at clouds in
the distance or glancing at his
auditor, they are intelligent,
energetic, unusually alive.
He took me first to some
thing he called an "herbal
lawn." From a distance, this
looked similar to a grass lawn
— green and flat. Standing next
to it, however, I saw that its

color was not uniform. In
terspersed among the light
green of sweet clover were
plants of darker shades —
identified by Jeavons as Roman
chamomile, creeping thyme
and dwarf yarrow. In addition
to being "simple and beauti
ful," Jeavons said, the lawn
fixes nitrogen in the soil and
concentrates phosphorous
and potash in its leaves. It is
thus beneficial to the soil on
which it is grown and can be
mown as a source of
nutriment-rich compost.
For the next hour we looked
at such things as newly-planted
fruit trees, fragrant and useful
herbs, fallow planting beds,
freshly-prepared planting

beds, planting beds overflow
ing with mature vegetables and
legumes, and recently har
vested planting beds. All the
while Jeavons kept up an in
teresting commentary filled
with odd facts and anecdotes.
"You see those nicely dug beds
over there?" he asked at one
point. "Those were prepared
by a 65-year-old woman with a
heart condition."
Finally, he led me to a
fenced-off area with a pad
locked gate. "This is the re
search garden," he said.
"What we've been looking at is
the community garden. People
from all over, including about
five to 10 percent of all the Syn
tex employees, are involved
with raising food here."
Inside the research garden
were rows of beds each about
six feet wide and 20 feet long. I
was slightly disappointed by
the modest dimensions of the
whole garden — smaller than
that occupied by the average
house — since it seemed that
something larger would be re
quired for such significant re
search.
"This area is about 2500
square feet," Jeavons said as if
reading my thoughts. "Our re
search indicates that a com
pletely balanced diet could be
grown on this much space —
and with as little as a half hour
of work a day. The same
amount of food, if it were
grown by U.S. chemical,
mechanized techniques would
take 10,000 square feet. In In
dia, the same diet would take
32,000 square feet.
"Now, the average American
eats 322 pounds of vegetables
and soft fruits — fruits like
strawberries, cantalopes and
watermelon — a year. Two
hundred and twenty of those
pounds are potatoes. You can
grow that amount of vegeta
bles with the biodynamic-
French intensive method in 100
square feet in a four to six
month growing season. In the
case of fruit trees, you can put
two of them in a hundred
square foot bed on eight foot
centers. Each of those fruit
trees should produce a
hundred pounds of hard fruit
per year and the average
American eats 162 pounds of
hard fruit a year. It should take
you maybe a half a minute to a
minute a day to take care of the
trees on an average basis and it
should take you about five to
10 minutes a day to take care of

the vegetable bed.
"So what we're talking about
is eventually people can start
raising a fair amount of their
food just in their back yard. A
family of four, in 400 square
feet, could raise in a four to six
month growing season food
worth $480 in five to 10 minutes
a day each. Their labor would
then be worth $4 to $8 an hour.
Now a person is probably not
going to do this the first year if
he's never gardened before,
but he's going to do a lot better
than he's done with other
techniques. What this means
for overseas, for India, for
example, where they have fer
tilizer shortages, energy shor
tages, water shortages and
food shortages, is that in a
small area, say 2500 to 7000
square feet they could raise
their total diet rather than in
32,000 square feet. So small is
beautiful: in this country, de
escalation of technology; for
overseas, a move to more self
sufficiency."
We moved to a bed with
some dried leaves and with
ered stalks in it which I recog
nized as potatoes, leavons
went on.
"Now in monetary terms,
with potatoes, we're now at
four times the national average
but we expect to go much
higher— maybe well above 20.
We're still experimenting with
that. I can't tell you on the re
cord how high we expect to go
but I can say on the record it's
over 20. With zucchini, when
we got only 16 times the Santa
Clara county average, the bed
produced $12.50 an hour — or
would have if we'd sold it all at
the wholesale rate. Now that
we're up to 60, we're talking
about producing three times
that or $37.50 an hour. This is
an extreme case but it should
be possible to earn a minimum
of $4 an hour just raising your
own vegetables.
"We're guessing that a new
kind of job or profession will
come out of all of this — mini
farming. We estimate that it
will be possible for one person
working a 40-hour week to
raise $15,000 net on as little as a
quarter of an acre. Currently
small farmers with farms of 200
to4oo acres are lucky if they net
several thousand dollars.
"So our philosophy is one of
low techonology, that is, simple
technology but sophisticated
theory. And I should say that
we're not a 'labor-intensive'
method as many people have
said we are. It's actually 'skill
intensive.' Bed preparation
may be the hardest job of the
method but once the soil is in
good shape and using a new
device that they've developed
in Canada, it should be possi
ble to prepare a bed in five to
10 minutes.
"All the resources that we
need to raise food right are av
ailable— we're just using them
in the wrong way. Take wheat
production, for example.
Normally to produce more
grain you have to use a lot
more fertilizer. For instance
with corn, from 1940 to 1960,
the nitrogen fertilizer use in
creased 10-fold, but the yields
only doubled. So your fertilizer
effectiveness was only one
fifth as good in 1960 as it was in
1940. Well, we cut our nitrogen
fertilizer use in one year to
one-half and the yield dou
bled. At the same time the pro
tein content increased. It went
from 14.8 percent to 15.7.
Normally when your yields go
up, your protein content per
pound of food goes down. Plus
we used less water and less
energy, less phosphorous and
less potash.
"Eventually, if we get all the
projections that we expect to
get, we'll be producing as
much food per hour as people
with machines can produce. So
this makes the individual im

portant again and gives the in
dividual a choice.
"I should stress that we've
got a ways to go yet. We don't
have a perfect system. We have
failures; we haven't reached all
our projections, but we've had
a lot of good results too.
"Right now, we think if the
method has an Achilles heel, it
will be in the net flow of or
ganic matter in and out of the
soil. We may have to face the
possibility that with the yields
we're now getting, we'll
exhaust the soil in a few more
years. The most important
thing about an agricultural
method is whether it is sustain
able in an environmentally ba
lanced way. The Chinese have
been able for hundreds of
years to grow twice as much
food as the United States does
now. And by using manual, or
ganic techniques and fertiliz
ers grown or produced on their
farms. But we may have to face
the possibility that our sustain
able yield level will be less than
our optimum yield level."
Jeavons turned away from
the potato bed and regarded
me fora moment, as if to make
sure I had understood every
thing up to that point. After tak
ing a deep breath, he turned
and pointed to a pair of
plastic-covered structures
which were, evidently,
greenhouses. One was very
similar in appearance to a con
ventional greenhouse but the
other one was only three feet
high and just covered one
hundred-square-foot bed.
"Now with these miniature
greenhouses," Jeavons said,
"a 12-month growing season is
possible in most climates
where food is grown. What this
means is you could grow your
total diet on as little as 1250
square feet working as little as
15 minutes a day." He walked
to the center of the area and
spread his arms. "That's this
much," he said, his tone imply
ing how little he thought 1250
square feet to be. I was a little
incredulous for a moment be
cause the space he indicated
really seemed no larger than
the average living room. But
then I remembered that an
acre is somewhat more than
40,000 square feet. I had no
trouble believing that the de
signated area was about a thir
tieth of an acre. "And, he said,
with a smile, "even though it's
too early to say on the record,
we expect to go much, much
lower than that to grow a total
diet."

In 1840 the German chemist
Justus von Liebig published a
paper entitled "Chemistry in
its application to agriculture
and physiology." This event,
giving birth to a whole new ap •
proach to the cultivation of
food — which I will call "chem
ical agriculture" — intruded
into the gradual evolution of
farming with all the virulence
of a malignant tumor.
It is true that relatively little
change had taken place in ag
riculture since the dawn of
civilization — 4000 years or

more if one goes back to the
Chinese farmers mentioned by
Jeavons; it is true that during
the period in which chemical
agriculture was developed in
earnest — from the 1880s to the
1920s — the world's population
was growing at a heretofore
unimaginable rate; and it is
true that many well
intentioned people saw in
chemical agriculture the only
means of putting food in the
staggering number of new and
hungry mouths.
It is also true, however, that
concurrent with the rise of
chemical agriculture were the
several great strides outlined
by Jeavons — the strides which
developed in a relatively short
time into the biodynamic-
French intensive method. As
chemical agriculture
burgeoned into an industry
and an orthodoxy, men such as
Rudolf Steiner — and he was
far from alone — recognized
the folly of abandoning
methods proven over millenia
for new and untried
techniques. On the next occa
sion on which I met with
jeavons, I asked him what he
believed were the causes for
the headlong rush toward
chemicals in the face of saner
councils.
"Well, part of the reason,"
he said, "was that as chemical
fertilizers came into play, trac
tors were being developed and
brought into use on many
farms. This made it possible to
spread chemical fertilizer very
easily. It was less time
consuming than spreading
manures. Also, with the tractor
you were able to farm large
areas. Even though it wasn't in
tensive, you could farm a large
area and produce a lot of food
in a very short time. The prom
ise of opening up increased ac
reage was very seductive. To
most people, two to four times
the area meant two to four
times the food. On the other
hand, the French intensive cul
ture that was developed out
side Paris required an awful lot
of people per acre. So with
everyone getting caught up in
the petrochemical
mechanized revolution, the
tendency was to equate 'faster'
with 'more and better.' Which
for a short time was probably
true. But if we get into today's
period, the petrochemicals are
getting more expensive so
spending more time and labor
to get the same amount of food
isn't as unappealing as it used
to be. But more important, I

believe,
from the
perspective
of our re
search, is
that we be
lieve we're
going to be
able to
produce as
much food
per hour as
a machine
can — by
hand. The
way that
we're going
to be able
to do this is
by thinking
about

what's been done in the past,
about what's being done cur
rently, and maximizing the
simplicity which produces the
time efficiency."
During the course of the last
half century, many of the
spokesmen for non-chemical
agriculture have found them
selves ostracized for their be
liefs and techniques. At best
they have been ignored by the
academic and political estab
lishment, at worst they have
been actively harassed and
obstructed in presenting their
cases before the public. One of


these men, Sir Albert Howard,
an Imperial Botanist for the In
dian government, "did some
fantastic things," according to
Jeavons. "Everyone had told
him he couldn't grow cotton
organically in India because
the pests would eat it up. It
took him a while but at the end
of five years, he was growing
cotton organically — with no
pesticides. He had less crop
loss than the people who were
using pesticides."
Although knighted for this
and other accomplishments,
Howard received so much pub
lic ridicule — both from fer-

tilizer in
dustry
spokesmen
and his fel
low scien
tists — that
his ideas
went
widely un
heeded.
Howard
wrote, after

addressing one particularly
nonreceptive audience of
botanists, "Here again I was
amazed by the limited know
ledge and experience of the
world's agriculturalists dis
closed by this debate. I felt I
was dealing with beginners
and that some of the argu
ments put forward could al
most be described as the im
pertinences of ignorance."
In this country, the case of
|.l. Rodale, whose publications
are among the standard refer
ences for a large segment of
the organic farming popula
tion, is not unusual. Rodale
was forced to spend almost a
quarter of a million dollars in
legal fees to win a court deci
sion over the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission which had
blocked the publication of his
book "The Health Finder."
I asked )eavons whether he
thought these examples indi
cated the presence of an estab
lishment which had a vested in
terest in the development and
maintenance of chemical ag
riculture irrespective of the
best interests of mankind. It
was true, he said, that
"businessmen are always
ready to take advantage of a
good thing and push it to the
fullest," but there were proba
bly "two separate thrusts" —
business incentives and desire
for greater efficiency — which
"then became merged."
leavons then related an in
teresting anecdote, most of
which had to remain off the re
cord, which was a telling
statement about the present
state of agricultural research.
"It was amazing to me," he
said, "that agricultural schools
are not more interested in re
search like that (Howard's),
and in trying to replicate it — at
least as an alternative ap
proach. I wrote a letter to an
individual who was involved in
agricultural research at a col
lege here in California. I told
him I was confused. In the light
of some of the possibilities we
were uncovering with the
biodynamic-French intensive
method, why wasn't anyone
investigating our results. He
wrote me back a very good let
ter. He indicated that the re
search money is coming from
thechemical industriesand the
agricultural interests. They
have an interest in using the
system they've already got.
And again, their purpose is
making money from it, not
necessarily making it better. So
you see, the professors almost
have to ridicule alternative
methods. If they go into other
areas, they become profes
sionally ostracized and they
can't get funds."
leavons continued with
another anecdote, this time
regarding a conference about
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method which was held

last year in Santa Barbara. Sev
eral members of the American
Society of Agronomy had at
tended, he said, and had asked
questions about the
mechanisms of the improved
plant growth. "If we couldn't
tell them exactly how it was
happening, in their terms and
language, they wouldn't give it
very much credence. Someone
pointed out that the Romans
knew how to make concrete a
long time before anyone knew
why it worked. There's a kind
of scientific myopia here. It's
like they're saying, you can
only be scientific if you're sci
entific in the way in which we
are scientific. Well, good lord,
if someone's demonstrating
that something is possible,
anyone who's really an open
minded scientist ought to be
excited and interested to find
out why it's possible. But there
aren't any funds for them to do
it."
leavons is not alone in his
observation of "scientific
myopia" in the present
academic community. In April,
1973, Nicholas Wade reported
in Science magazine that "a
blue-ribbon committee of
basic and agricultural scien
tists" found that "the basic re
search performed by federal
and state agricultural research
organizations is of meager
quality, suffers from a 'shock
ing lack of intellectual leader
ship' and is guided by policies
detrimental to the interests of
agriculture."
Although no reference was
made to a lack of attention to
any specific area of research,
University of Chicago Biology
Prof. Richard Levins wrote in a
later issue of Science that "the
issues raised by Nicholas
Wade's report have to be set
into a broader context than
simply the policies of the U.S.
Department of Agricul
ture. . . . Within agricultural
science, America's traditional
anti-intellectualism survives as
an antitheoretical bias. . . .It is
reinforced by the search for
marketable products (mostly
chemical) as the central
strategy for improvement of
agriculture . . . and by a nar
row acceptance of the present
structure of agriculture as a
given condition which restricts
options. For example, the con
sideration of mixed plantings is
inhibited by the present design
of farm machinery."
The tone of both articles asks
the question, "Ought we to let
this happen?" The tone taken
increasingly by more and more
far-sighted scientists today,
however, is "Can we afford to
let this happen?" jeavons him
self points to the dwindling
supply of natural gas — the
current reserves of which are
slated to run out in about a de
cade — as one factor which
could lead to an agricultural
disaster. Since the production
of artificial nitrogen fertilizer
has been made almost wholly
dependent on natural gas, he
says, and since there is evi-

dence indi
cating that
nitrogen fi
xation from
the air by
soil bac
teria stops
in the pre
sence of ar
tificial fer
tilizer
which in

turn causes a soil "addiction"
to this form of fertilizer, it
seems likely that we will be
faced with the necessity of
using pollution-producing coal
to satisfy our farmlands'
"habit." And even the coal
supply will someday be
exhausted.
Yet even if the scarcity of
energy were not an issue, the
question would still be a valid
one. In addition to beini:


ecologically unsound, our pre
sent system of food production
is economically and technolog
ically unsatisfactory for a large
segment of the world's popula
tion. As Frances Moore Lappe
and ]oseph Collins de
monstrate in their book, Food
First, the expensive technology
and inflated prices which "ag
ribusiness" and its "global
supermarket" force on unde
veloped nations do as much to
hinder their progress as any
other single factor.
Jeavons' belief is that the
solution to many of the world's
food-related problems —
ecological, economical and
technological — lies in a global
move to small-scale farming. A
February, 1976 paper released
by Ecology Action states that
"the current food shortages
will worsen into a crisis of
global proportions unless the
productivity of the 100 million
small farms in the developing
world is increased dramati
cally. Several key points make
the biodynamic-Fiench inten
sive method especially viable
in countries with limited re
sources: The method does not
require complicated machin
ery or expensive fertilizers.
The key technological element
is the common shovel. The
method uses 1/2 to 1/16 the wa
ter. This will be especially valu
able in arid areas of the world,
or those limited to natural rain
fall. The method provides a
self-sufficient livelihood in
areas of high unemployment.
The method's diversified ap
proach encourages intercrop
ping with local foods, thus of
fering a varied diet. The
method builds a healthy soil,
the key to dependable food
production and the building of
a stable economic and social
system."
And, according to a paper
co-authored by leavons, "The
small farm, all factors consi
dered, is actually a more effi
cient unit of production than
its large-scale counterpart. To
quote Sterling Wortman of the
Rockerfeller Foundation, . .
most large-scale mechanized
agriculture is less productive
per unit area than small scale
farming can be. The farmer on
a small holding can engage in
intensive high yield gardening,
systems such as intercropping,
multiple cropping, relay plant
ing or other techniques that
require attention to individual
plants. The point is that
mechanized agriculture is very
productive in terms of output
per man-year, but it is not as
productive per unit of land as
the highly intensive systems
are.' Much of the economic
advantage large farms now
enjoy is not due to any stream
lining inherent in their size but
in the tax structures and sub
sidies which favor corporate
'tax loss' farming, land specula
tion, and vertical stratification
of the food industry from pro
duction of fertilizers, to farm
ing, to packaging and distribu
tion of food products."
Jeavons is generally unop
timistic

about the
prospects
for a rapid
change
from our
current ag
ricultural
practices,
projecting
50years as a
minimum

before such a transformation
will be started on a large scale.
"The thing that has always con
fused me," he told me, "is why
so few people have asked why
can't we keep the organic,
small-scale simplicity and also
have the sophistication of
modern science. I think one
reason why people don't get
into that too much is because
they're thinking on a closed

system basis — and it gets away
from a growth economy.
There's no audience for this in
this country, very few people
living that kind of lifestyle.
They're not putting their
energy into making it happen.
They're still chasing the growth
economy that is epitomized by
the development of the tractor
and the chemical fertilizers."
Lemmings have at least one
thing to recommend them
over mankind — at least when
they rush to their destruction,
•they do not drag the rest of the
planet with them. But mankind
has at least one thing to re
commend it over lemmings: at
least as it rushes to its destruc
tion, it can see where it is going
and attempt to stop before it is

too late.
It often
seems,
however,
that rather
than at
tempting to
stop our
sprint to
ward an
nihilation,

one part of
our species is actively engaged
in accelerating our progress
while the other part fiddles
marching tunes like a whole
race of carefree Neros. We find
our leaders more concerned
with their own destinies than
those of the people they are
supposed to lead; we find, in
fact, that they seem to have no
awareness of any destiny other
than their own. We find them
structuring our culture for
their own ends, without regard
for any future more distant
than the probable span of their
lives. We find an educational
system which perpetuates
their narrow-sightedness. We
at the summit of our culture
find ourselves in the midst of a
highly-sophisticated,
apparently-benign process
which teaches us to shut our
eyes and go faster.
But then it can not be de
nied: the power of vision has
not left us entirely; there are
those who do stretch their
necks to look around. It is no
doubt painful and traumatic to
take a long look at the destruc
tion which we are cultivating.
But there are, these people tell
us, other views, views as prom
ising as the scene immediately
before us is threatening. And,
hope being what it is, they are
working to divert our rush.
)eavons, obviously, is such a
man. He is not militant, anar
chistic, alienated, alienating or
bitter. As he says, "you don't
really need to change the sys
tem to live a better life."
leavons is just quietly pursuing
his work, doing what he can to
bring about an improvement in
the attitude of our culture.

The headquarters of the Syn
tex Corporation is located
on a hillside just west of Footh
ill Expressway, across from
Palo Alto's Veterans Administ
ration Hospital. A large cement
and glass building in the mod
ern architectural style, it sits on
a very green and well-groomed
lawn. At the foot of the hill,
however, literally a stone's
throw away from the
chemical-pharmaceuticals bas
tion, an incongruous sight pre
sents itself: a truck garden, in
the best tradition of truck gar
dens. It is a disorderly collage
of colors and textures — the
lush green of crops and weeds,
the crumbling dark brown of
newly turned earth, the dry
light brown of withered vege
tation, the dusty white sheen
of sheet plastic, the hard lustre
less gray of metal siding.

A casual passerby, observing
the two establishments, would
be likely to see in their proxim
ity the tension which often
exists between the new and
dynamic and the old and static.
Palo Aito, he might surmise, is
in the final stages of a
metamorphosis from the pas
toral to the cosmopolitan; the
garden, a quaint anachronism,
will soon be the site of yet
another corporate headquar
ters and the cement and glass
building on the hillside will ac
quire, by comparison, an air of
establishment and seniority.

Such is not the case, how
ever. Quite to the contrary, the
cement and glass building
antedates the garden; the land
on which the garden is located
is owned by the corporation
and worked by the garden's
proprietors under the terms of
a rent-free lease; the operation
of the garden is partially sub
sidized, with virtually no return
obligations, by the corpora
tion's donation, in addition to
the land, of water and funds. It
is an unusual situation, but it is
an unusual truck garden.
Foods ranging from grains to
fruit to beans to vegetables are
under cultivation there. The
yield of any given foodstuff at
any given harvest time typically
ranges from two to 31 times the
national, California or Santa
Clara County average
(whichever is higher). From
one-half to one-sixteenth the
average amount of water per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. From one-half to
one-sixteenth the average
amount of nitrogen fertilizer
per pound of food produced is
typically used. About one
one-hundredth the energy per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. No "chemical" fer
tilizer is used. Mo pesticides of
any type are used. No machin
ery more sophisticated than a
simple wheelbarrow is used.
And it is not uncommon to see
men and women in business
dress entering or leaving the
garden or engaged in some
phase of agriculture.
Despite these arresting facts,
the garden and its proprietors
remain surprisingly anonym
ous. Perhaps it is the
previously-described undis
tinguished character of the
former, or maybe it is the
quiet, unassuming style of the
latter. It may even be that it has
less to do with either the
former or latter than the nature
of the rest of the world. What
ever the case, it would be a
poor bet indeed to wager that
that anonymity is to be pre
served for very much longer.
Although I have been in
terested in food in general
and gardening in specific for
much of my life, the terms
"biodynamic" and "French in
tensive" remained obscure to
me until I made the acquain
tance of John leavons. An
alumnus of Yale and former
head of Business Services for
the Stanford library system,
leavons currently wields the

ponderous title of Director of
Agricultural Research for Ecol
ogy Action of the Midpenin
sula.
It is largely Jeavons who is
responsible for the present
shape — in both a physLal and
an abstract sense — of the ag
ricultural program underway
on the three and three-quarter
acre plot of Syntex land. It was
Jeavons who, after making a
study on his own initiative of
United Nations iand use and

population
figures, be
came con
vinced that
the planet
was still
capable of
feeding all
her in
habitants;
it was he
who, after
attending a
seminar on
the agricul
tural
techniques

synthesized by the Englishman
Alan Chadwick, sought out the
master horticulturalist in his
barren hillside-turned Garden
of Eden at the University of
California at Santa Cruz; it was
Jeavons who, after talking at
length with Chadwick, prop
osed the idea of a combined
research and community gar
den to the board of directors of
Ecology Action, a Palo Alto
conservation group which had
won recognition for a success
ful city-wide recycling prog-

ram; it was he who, after con
vincing them of the viability
and significance of such a
program, proceeded to as
semble the elements of Com
mon Ground — land, funds,
people — and embark on a
course of rigorous scientific
research.
The program is now in its
sixth year. Each succeeding
year has, according to Jeavons,
confirmed his faith in Chad
wick's techniques, known now
as the biodynamic-French in
tensive method.
When I first spoke with
leavons, I had a vague recollec
tion of a chapter in a gardening
book which had described a
"labor-intensive" system of
farming which allowed the
densely-populated countries
of western Europe to grow
much food on little land. This, I
imagined, was related to
"French-intensive" farming. In
his articulate and methodical
way, Jeavons soon clarified and
expanded this conception —
and made me realize how large
a topic this form of agriculture
had become.
"The method we're using
now," he said, "is made up of
two techniques that were de
veloped in Europe around the
turn of the century. The French
intensive method is one—that
reached its culmination in the
1890s outside Paris. What it did
was it raised vegetables in beds
that consisted of 18 inches of
horse manure — which was re
ally plentiful at the time. Be
cause of this high level of or
ganic matter and the fertility it
created, as well as the great
depth of loose material, roots
were able to grow downward
instead of needing room to
grow out horizontally. So they
were able to use very close
spacing."
This simple concept, leavons
continued, accounts for a sig
nificant part of the increased
yields which the method pro
duces. As jeavons phrased it in
a research report summarizing
Common Ground's first four
years, "A simple 24-inch deep
soil preparation allows the

plants to be spaced more
closely so that their leaves
touch or almost touch. . . .
This factor alone would make
fourfold yields possible be
cause four times as many
plants as usual can be planted
in a given area."
"The other technique,"
Jeavons told me, "was the
biodynamic technique. It was
developed in the 1920s by
Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian
genius who was into educa
tion, philosophy, religion, and
agriculture. The French inten
sive method had been de
veloped over hundreds of
years by French marchiers or
gardeners. The biodynamic
method, though, was de
veloped by Steiner in the late
'20s fora lot of wealthy German
farmers who had noticed that
their yields were going down
and they were getting more in
sect and disease problems. It
turned out they had been using
chemical fertilizers. Urea, a
kind of artifical nitrogen, had
been developed in the late
1880s. Steiner traced their
problems to the chemical fer
tilizers and suggested that they
return to some of their old
methods and adopt five special
practices. These practices be
camethe biodynamic method.
"One was the use of raised
beds — beds only 12 inches
deep prepared by raking soil
out of the path. This was going
back to the Greeks who found
out that plants grew better in
landslides. The raised beds as
they came to be dug were like
little, artificial landslides. The
reasons the plants do better in
them is because the soil is
looser and there's more air or
gases in it — you need up to 50
percent gases for good plant
growth."
jeavons frequently uses the
verb "dovetail" to describe
areas where two concepts in
termesh or compliment each
other. The deep soil prepara
tion and close spacing of the
French intensive method
dovetails, he said, with the "ar
tificial landslides" of the
biodynamic method to pro

duce healthier, more produc
tive plants.
"There was a study in the '50s
at the University of California
at Berkeley," he said, "that
showed that if you improved
root health by two to four per
cent for most common field
crops you could increase the
yields by 200 to 400 percent.
One of the things which can
make this possible is better soil
preparation and aeration. With
our method, you have more air
in the soil, more surface area
for contact between soil and air
since a raised bed has a curved
surface and also more surface
area to absorb rain or watering
and warmth from the sun. And
the curved surface also allows
you to increase the planting
area by 20 percent. Say you
have a plot of land that's a
hundred square feet and you
make it a raised bed, you can
wind up with 120 square feet of
planting area.
"The second technique that
Steiner recommended, after
the raised beds — which inci
dentally may even have gone
back even before the Greeks to
the Chinese, possibly 4000
years ago — was the use of or
ganic fertilizers. Chemical fer
tilizers at the time were mainly
just nitrogen or nitrogen and
phosphorous. They weren't
balanced or complete; they
needed trace minerals and
potash. Also the chemical fer
tilizers broke down very
quickly and harmed the texture
and structure of the soil and
killed the microbiotic life and

so forth. So Steiner asked the
German farmers to return to
organic fertilizers that were
more balanced and diverse —
like fish meal which has nitro
gen, phosphorous and trace
mi nerals and breaks down over
a period of six months instead
of four to six weeks.
"The third technique was
companion planting. There
were a lot of folk myths about
what things to grow well to
gether. Steiner tried to scienti
fically investigate this through
such techniques as
chromatography and crystalli
zation and field testing to de
termine which plants grown
together would do better. For
instance, one part chamomile
grown with two hundred parts
of wheat increases the health
and yield of wheat. But if its
one to one, one part
chamomile grown with one
part wheat, the wheat will be
destroyed, or at least seriously
harmed.
"Another technique was the
use of herbal sprays. At one
point they were almost a cult.
You take stinging nettles, for
example, and you do some
thing like — I can't remember
exactly — bury it three feet
under the ground at a certain
conjunction of the plants and
leave it under there for six
months and dig it up and mix it
in with a water solution and
then spray it on the ground. It's
supposed to stimulate the
micorobiotic life of the soil
which helps the plants. Really
far out, really unusual, but it
works.
"And the fifth thing was
planting by the phases of the
moon. The rationale for this
comes from seeing the moon's
effect on oceans — daily tides
of up to 40 feet in some parts of
the world. There's water in the
ground, in seeds and in plants
so it seems there might be a
small effect there.
"So those were the two
threads — the French intensive
method and Steiner's five
biodynamic techniques.
"Now, Chadwick, who is, I
think, a horticultural genius,

certainly a horticultural artist,
put these two techniques to
gether sometime between the
1930s and the 1960s when he
came to Santa Cruz. He had
been severely exasperated by
the second world war. A
woman named Freiavon Molka
and he got together and de
cided that one of the best ways
to bring peace and life and
harmony back into the world
was through gardens. Chad
wick had studied under the
French marchiers and he had
studied under Steiner. He's
had over 50 years of experience
in raising food. He also worked
under George Bernard Shaw in
drama, he's a painter, an actor,
an incredible individual — very
dramatic in his presentation of
things.
"When he put the two farm
ing techniques together, he
simplified them. Where
Steiner would make herbal
preparations, Chadwick would
just grow the herb, the stinging
nettle say, in the bed and then
put it in the compost pile and
let it have a living kind of influ
ence. Instead of using dead
mulches he used living mulch
— when the plants are so close
together that their leaves just
about touch, the ground is
shaded, moisture is con
served, a micro-climate is
created. So his whole orienta
tion is using living plants and
giving to nature as much as she
produces and even a little
more. If you give to nature
more than she gives you, she
will continually provide you
with abundance.
"So Chadwick prepares his
beds 24 inches deep, not just
18, he uses compost mainly
from vegetable matter, he uses
very little manure — in contrast
with the French and in contrast
with the other biodynamic
people who sometimes use a
lot of manure. This is important
worldwide because one-third
of the world's people now have
a different kind of energy
crisis: they don't have enough
firewood. So like in India,
they're burning the manure
from animals to heat their
homes and to cook their food.
There's a fertilizer shortage
there. But you don't need the
manure under Chadwick's
technique; most of it is veget
able compost, as I said.
"So he uses 24-inch-deep
soil preparation; close spac
ing; comparatively speaking, a
vegetarian or quasi-vegetarian
compost that's two-thirds veg
etable matter, one-third soil;
he uses living herbs rather than
herbal sprays, generally; he
uses some organic fertilizers,
mainly bone meal but not
much else; and he plants by
the phases of the moon."
/ / K| ow we started re-
searching the method
in 1972. Our purposes were
twofold. One was to document
how the method was done — it
had never been documented
in written form because Chad
wick doesn't believe in the
written word but by handing
things down by example and
by word of mouth, master to
apprentice and so forth. Also it
had been reputed that the
method produced four times
the average yield, but this had
never been documented one
way or another.
"The lot Syntex gave us had a
soil which was one-third rock
— meaning pebbles and stuff.
Normal agricultural soil is
maybe five percent rock, not 33
percent. In addition, our soil
was over one-third clay. There
was no nitrogen fertilizer in the
soil and just a trace of phos
phorous and potash.
"During our first five years
we got very encouraging re
sults — yields which ranged
anywhere from two to 16 times
the U.S., Santa Clara County or
California averages. Then in
1976, I developed a new

technique called 'superdig
ging' which is a sort of a super
texturizing technique. This
technique improves the soil
more rapidly. It takes up to five
years using normal techniques
to improve the soil. Re
member, we were in subsoil
clay with no top soil at all. As a
result of this new technique,
this year we've gone as high as
about 60 times the Santa Clara
County average with zucchini
using about two percent of the
water per pound of food pro
duced and one percent of the
added nitrogen fertilizer per
pound of food produced. In
the case of grain, we're as high
as two and a quarter times the
national average on soybeans,

double on
wheat and
expect to
go six to
eight times
for those
yields.
Also, we
expect to
be using
one third to
one-eighth
the water
per pound
of grain
produced
— and that
could be
significant
because it
means you

could be getting very high
grain yields with as little as
eight or 10 inches of rainfall.
Over 75 percent of the arable
area of the world has 10 or
more inches of rainfall.
"An interesting thing is that
the Zulus of South Africa use a
similar technique — similar to
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method, that is, that they
developed on their own. It's a
triple-digging technique, lust
before it rains they prepare the
soil three feet deep and as
soon as it does rain they plant
their grain. It doesn't rain all
summer and is very dry. They
grow grain when no one else
can grow grain anywhere. So
here's a similar technique
that's working under natural
rainfall conditions.
"What this means is that if
we reach all of our projections,
we would be getting an aver
age of four to eight times on
vegetables and six to eight
times the average yield on
grain. And these yields, by the
way are already being obtained
somewhere else in the world
on the average — and on a
large scale basis. A way to high
light this is to say that for every
major crop grown in the Un
ited States, some other country
in the world on the average is
getting a yield about twice as
high. So U.S. agriculture,
though it may look good, is not
the best with all crops."
One morning soon after our
first conversation, I met
Jeavons for a tour of the Com
mon Ground garden. He is
plainly in his element there. A
fairly large man in his mid-30s
he sports an incipient pot belly
and a voluminous though
well-behaved beard. He was
dressed in mud-spattered
work pants, a heavy flannel
shirt and a sweat-stained
leather cap. He generally main
tains a serious demeanor al
though when he smiles he re
veals a considerable capacity
for simple delight. His eyes
especially, manifest his posi
tive attitude: whether engaged
in a visual analysis of crop
progress, gazing at clouds in
the distance or glancing at his
auditor, they are intelligent,
energetic, unusually alive.
He took me first to some
thing he called an "herbal
lawn." From a distance, this
looked similar to a grass lawn
— green and flat. Standing next
to it, however, I saw that its

color was not uniform. In
terspersed among the light
green of sweet clover were
plants of darker shades —
identified by Jeavons as Roman
chamomile, creeping thyme
and dwarf yarrow. In addition
to being "simple and beauti
ful," Jeavons said, the lawn
fixes nitrogen in the soil and
concentrates phosphorous
and potash in its leaves. It is
thus beneficial to the soil on
which it is grown and can be
mown as a source of
nutriment-rich compost.
For the next hour we looked
at such things as newly-planted
fruit trees, fragrant and useful
herbs, fallow planting beds,
freshly-prepared planting

beds, planting beds overflow
ing with mature vegetables and
legumes, and recently har
vested planting beds. All the
while Jeavons kept up an in
teresting commentary filled
with odd facts and anecdotes.
"You see those nicely dug beds
over there?" he asked at one
point. "Those were prepared
by a 65-year-old woman with a
heart condition."
Finally, he led me to a
fenced-off area with a pad
locked gate. "This is the re
search garden," he said.
"What we've been looking at is
the community garden. People
from all over, including about
five to 10 percent of all the Syn
tex employees, are involved
with raising food here."
Inside the research garden
were rows of beds each about
six feet wide and 20 feet long. I
was slightly disappointed by
the modest dimensions of the
whole garden — smaller than
that occupied by the average
house — since it seemed that
something larger would be re
quired for such significant re
search.
"This area is about 2500
square feet," Jeavons said as if
reading my thoughts. "Our re
search indicates that a com
pletely balanced diet could be
grown on this much space —
and with as little as a half hour
of work a day. The same
amount of food, if it were
grown by U.S. chemical,
mechanized techniques would
take 10,000 square feet. In In
dia, the same diet would take
32,000 square feet.
"Now, the average American
eats 322 pounds of vegetables
and soft fruits — fruits like
strawberries, cantalopes and
watermelon — a year. Two
hundred and twenty of those
pounds are potatoes. You can
grow that amount of vegeta
bles with the biodynamic-
French intensive method in 100
square feet in a four to six
month growing season. In the
case of fruit trees, you can put
two of them in a hundred
square foot bed on eight foot
centers. Each of those fruit
trees should produce a
hundred pounds of hard fruit
per year and the average
American eats 162 pounds of
hard fruit a year. It should take
you maybe a half a minute to a
minute a day to take care of the
trees on an average basis and it
should take you about five to
10 minutes a day to take care of

the vegetable bed.
"So what we're talking about
is eventually people can start
raising a fair amount of their
food just in their back yard. A
family of four, in 400 square
feet, could raise in a four to six
month growing season food
worth $480 in five to 10 minutes
a day each. Their labor would
then be worth $4 to $8 an hour.
Now a person is probably not
going to do this the first year if
he's never gardened before,
but he's going to do a lot better
than he's done with other
techniques. What this means
for overseas, for India, for
example, where they have fer
tilizer shortages, energy shor
tages, water shortages and
food shortages, is that in a
small area, say 2500 to 7000
square feet they could raise
their total diet rather than in
32,000 square feet. So small is
beautiful: in this country, de
escalation of technology; for
overseas, a move to more self
sufficiency."
We moved to a bed with
some dried leaves and with
ered stalks in it which I recog
nized as potatoes, leavons
went on.
"Now in monetary terms,
with potatoes, we're now at
four times the national average
but we expect to go much
higher— maybe well above 20.
We're still experimenting with
that. I can't tell you on the re
cord how high we expect to go
but I can say on the record it's
over 20. With zucchini, when
we got only 16 times the Santa
Clara county average, the bed
produced $12.50 an hour — or
would have if we'd sold it all at
the wholesale rate. Now that
we're up to 60, we're talking
about producing three times
that or $37.50 an hour. This is
an extreme case but it should
be possible to earn a minimum
of $4 an hour just raising your
own vegetables.
"We're guessing that a new
kind of job or profession will
come out of all of this — mini
farming. We estimate that it
will be possible for one person
working a 40-hour week to
raise $15,000 net on as little as a
quarter of an acre. Currently
small farmers with farms of 200
to4oo acres are lucky if they net
several thousand dollars.
"So our philosophy is one of
low techonology, that is, simple
technology but sophisticated
theory. And I should say that
we're not a 'labor-intensive'
method as many people have
said we are. It's actually 'skill
intensive.' Bed preparation
may be the hardest job of the
method but once the soil is in
good shape and using a new
device that they've developed
in Canada, it should be possi
ble to prepare a bed in five to
10 minutes.
"All the resources that we
need to raise food right are av
ailable— we're just using them
in the wrong way. Take wheat
production, for example.
Normally to produce more
grain you have to use a lot
more fertilizer. For instance
with corn, from 1940 to 1960,
the nitrogen fertilizer use in
creased 10-fold, but the yields
only doubled. So your fertilizer
effectiveness was only one
fifth as good in 1960 as it was in
1940. Well, we cut our nitrogen
fertilizer use in one year to
one-half and the yield dou
bled. At the same time the pro
tein content increased. It went
from 14.8 percent to 15.7.
Normally when your yields go
up, your protein content per
pound of food goes down. Plus
we used less water and less
energy, less phosphorous and
less potash.
"Eventually, if we get all the
projections that we expect to
get, we'll be producing as
much food per hour as people
with machines can produce. So
this makes the individual im

portant again and gives the in
dividual a choice.
"I should stress that we've
got a ways to go yet. We don't
have a perfect system. We have
failures; we haven't reached all
our projections, but we've had
a lot of good results too.
"Right now, we think if the
method has an Achilles heel, it
will be in the net flow of or
ganic matter in and out of the
soil. We may have to face the
possibility that with the yields
we're now getting, we'll
exhaust the soil in a few more
years. The most important
thing about an agricultural
method is whether it is sustain
able in an environmentally ba
lanced way. The Chinese have
been able for hundreds of
years to grow twice as much
food as the United States does
now. And by using manual, or
ganic techniques and fertiliz
ers grown or produced on their
farms. But we may have to face
the possibility that our sustain
able yield level will be less than
our optimum yield level."
Jeavons turned away from
the potato bed and regarded
me fora moment, as if to make
sure I had understood every
thing up to that point. After tak
ing a deep breath, he turned
and pointed to a pair of
plastic-covered structures
which were, evidently,
greenhouses. One was very
similar in appearance to a con
ventional greenhouse but the
other one was only three feet
high and just covered one
hundred-square-foot bed.
"Now with these miniature
greenhouses," Jeavons said,
"a 12-month growing season is
possible in most climates
where food is grown. What this
means is you could grow your
total diet on as little as 1250
square feet working as little as
15 minutes a day." He walked
to the center of the area and
spread his arms. "That's this
much," he said, his tone imply
ing how little he thought 1250
square feet to be. I was a little
incredulous for a moment be
cause the space he indicated
really seemed no larger than
the average living room. But
then I remembered that an
acre is somewhat more than
40,000 square feet. I had no
trouble believing that the de
signated area was about a thir
tieth of an acre. "And, he said,
with a smile, "even though it's
too early to say on the record,
we expect to go much, much
lower than that to grow a total
diet."

In 1840 the German chemist
Justus von Liebig published a
paper entitled "Chemistry in
its application to agriculture
and physiology." This event,
giving birth to a whole new ap •
proach to the cultivation of
food — which I will call "chem
ical agriculture" — intruded
into the gradual evolution of
farming with all the virulence
of a malignant tumor.
It is true that relatively little
change had taken place in ag
riculture since the dawn of
civilization — 4000 years or

more if one goes back to the
Chinese farmers mentioned by
Jeavons; it is true that during
the period in which chemical
agriculture was developed in
earnest — from the 1880s to the
1920s — the world's population
was growing at a heretofore
unimaginable rate; and it is
true that many well
intentioned people saw in
chemical agriculture the only
means of putting food in the
staggering number of new and
hungry mouths.
It is also true, however, that
concurrent with the rise of
chemical agriculture were the
several great strides outlined
by Jeavons — the strides which
developed in a relatively short
time into the biodynamic-
French intensive method. As
chemical agriculture
burgeoned into an industry
and an orthodoxy, men such as
Rudolf Steiner — and he was
far from alone — recognized
the folly of abandoning
methods proven over millenia
for new and untried
techniques. On the next occa
sion on which I met with
jeavons, I asked him what he
believed were the causes for
the headlong rush toward
chemicals in the face of saner
councils.
"Well, part of the reason,"
he said, "was that as chemical
fertilizers came into play, trac
tors were being developed and
brought into use on many
farms. This made it possible to
spread chemical fertilizer very
easily. It was less time
consuming than spreading
manures. Also, with the tractor
you were able to farm large
areas. Even though it wasn't in
tensive, you could farm a large
area and produce a lot of food
in a very short time. The prom
ise of opening up increased ac
reage was very seductive. To
most people, two to four times
the area meant two to four
times the food. On the other
hand, the French intensive cul
ture that was developed out
side Paris required an awful lot
of people per acre. So with
everyone getting caught up in
the petrochemical
mechanized revolution, the
tendency was to equate 'faster'
with 'more and better.' Which
for a short time was probably
true. But if we get into today's
period, the petrochemicals are
getting more expensive so
spending more time and labor
to get the same amount of food
isn't as unappealing as it used
to be. But more important, I

believe,
from the
perspective
of our re
search, is
that we be
lieve we're
going to be
able to
produce as
much food
per hour as
a machine
can — by
hand. The
way that
we're going
to be able
to do this is
by thinking
about

what's been done in the past,
about what's being done cur
rently, and maximizing the
simplicity which produces the
time efficiency."
During the course of the last
half century, many of the
spokesmen for non-chemical
agriculture have found them
selves ostracized for their be
liefs and techniques. At best
they have been ignored by the
academic and political estab
lishment, at worst they have
been actively harassed and
obstructed in presenting their
cases before the public. One of


these men, Sir Albert Howard,
an Imperial Botanist for the In
dian government, "did some
fantastic things," according to
Jeavons. "Everyone had told
him he couldn't grow cotton
organically in India because
the pests would eat it up. It
took him a while but at the end
of five years, he was growing
cotton organically — with no
pesticides. He had less crop
loss than the people who were
using pesticides."
Although knighted for this
and other accomplishments,
Howard received so much pub
lic ridicule — both from fer-

tilizer in
dustry
spokesmen
and his fel
low scien
tists — that
his ideas
went
widely un
heeded.
Howard
wrote, after

addressing one particularly
nonreceptive audience of
botanists, "Here again I was
amazed by the limited know
ledge and experience of the
world's agriculturalists dis
closed by this debate. I felt I
was dealing with beginners
and that some of the argu
ments put forward could al
most be described as the im
pertinences of ignorance."
In this country, the case of
|.l. Rodale, whose publications
are among the standard refer
ences for a large segment of
the organic farming popula
tion, is not unusual. Rodale
was forced to spend almost a
quarter of a million dollars in
legal fees to win a court deci
sion over the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission which had
blocked the publication of his
book "The Health Finder."
I asked )eavons whether he
thought these examples indi
cated the presence of an estab
lishment which had a vested in
terest in the development and
maintenance of chemical ag
riculture irrespective of the
best interests of mankind. It
was true, he said, that
"businessmen are always
ready to take advantage of a
good thing and push it to the
fullest," but there were proba
bly "two separate thrusts" —
business incentives and desire
for greater efficiency — which
"then became merged."
leavons then related an in
teresting anecdote, most of
which had to remain off the re
cord, which was a telling
statement about the present
state of agricultural research.
"It was amazing to me," he
said, "that agricultural schools
are not more interested in re
search like that (Howard's),
and in trying to replicate it — at
least as an alternative ap
proach. I wrote a letter to an
individual who was involved in
agricultural research at a col
lege here in California. I told
him I was confused. In the light
of some of the possibilities we
were uncovering with the
biodynamic-French intensive
method, why wasn't anyone
investigating our results. He
wrote me back a very good let
ter. He indicated that the re
search money is coming from
thechemical industriesand the
agricultural interests. They
have an interest in using the
system they've already got.
And again, their purpose is
making money from it, not
necessarily making it better. So
you see, the professors almost
have to ridicule alternative
methods. If they go into other
areas, they become profes
sionally ostracized and they
can't get funds."
leavons continued with
another anecdote, this time
regarding a conference about
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method which was held

last year in Santa Barbara. Sev
eral members of the American
Society of Agronomy had at
tended, he said, and had asked
questions about the
mechanisms of the improved
plant growth. "If we couldn't
tell them exactly how it was
happening, in their terms and
language, they wouldn't give it
very much credence. Someone
pointed out that the Romans
knew how to make concrete a
long time before anyone knew
why it worked. There's a kind
of scientific myopia here. It's
like they're saying, you can
only be scientific if you're sci
entific in the way in which we
are scientific. Well, good lord,
if someone's demonstrating
that something is possible,
anyone who's really an open
minded scientist ought to be
excited and interested to find
out why it's possible. But there
aren't any funds for them to do
it."
leavons is not alone in his
observation of "scientific
myopia" in the present
academic community. In April,
1973, Nicholas Wade reported
in Science magazine that "a
blue-ribbon committee of
basic and agricultural scien
tists" found that "the basic re
search performed by federal
and state agricultural research
organizations is of meager
quality, suffers from a 'shock
ing lack of intellectual leader
ship' and is guided by policies
detrimental to the interests of
agriculture."
Although no reference was
made to a lack of attention to
any specific area of research,
University of Chicago Biology
Prof. Richard Levins wrote in a
later issue of Science that "the
issues raised by Nicholas
Wade's report have to be set
into a broader context than
simply the policies of the U.S.
Department of Agricul
ture. . . . Within agricultural
science, America's traditional
anti-intellectualism survives as
an antitheoretical bias. . . .It is
reinforced by the search for
marketable products (mostly
chemical) as the central
strategy for improvement of
agriculture . . . and by a nar
row acceptance of the present
structure of agriculture as a
given condition which restricts
options. For example, the con
sideration of mixed plantings is
inhibited by the present design
of farm machinery."
The tone of both articles asks
the question, "Ought we to let
this happen?" The tone taken
increasingly by more and more
far-sighted scientists today,
however, is "Can we afford to
let this happen?" jeavons him
self points to the dwindling
supply of natural gas — the
current reserves of which are
slated to run out in about a de
cade — as one factor which
could lead to an agricultural
disaster. Since the production
of artificial nitrogen fertilizer
has been made almost wholly
dependent on natural gas, he
says, and since there is evi-

dence indi
cating that
nitrogen fi
xation from
the air by
soil bac
teria stops
in the pre
sence of ar
tificial fer
tilizer
which in

turn causes a soil "addiction"
to this form of fertilizer, it
seems likely that we will be
faced with the necessity of
using pollution-producing coal
to satisfy our farmlands'
"habit." And even the coal
supply will someday be
exhausted.
Yet even if the scarcity of
energy were not an issue, the
question would still be a valid
one. In addition to beini:


ecologically unsound, our pre
sent system of food production
is economically and technolog
ically unsatisfactory for a large
segment of the world's popula
tion. As Frances Moore Lappe
and ]oseph Collins de
monstrate in their book, Food
First, the expensive technology
and inflated prices which "ag
ribusiness" and its "global
supermarket" force on unde
veloped nations do as much to
hinder their progress as any
other single factor.
Jeavons' belief is that the
solution to many of the world's
food-related problems —
ecological, economical and
technological — lies in a global
move to small-scale farming. A
February, 1976 paper released
by Ecology Action states that
"the current food shortages
will worsen into a crisis of
global proportions unless the
productivity of the 100 million
small farms in the developing
world is increased dramati
cally. Several key points make
the biodynamic-Fiench inten
sive method especially viable
in countries with limited re
sources: The method does not
require complicated machin
ery or expensive fertilizers.
The key technological element
is the common shovel. The
method uses 1/2 to 1/16 the wa
ter. This will be especially valu
able in arid areas of the world,
or those limited to natural rain
fall. The method provides a
self-sufficient livelihood in
areas of high unemployment.
The method's diversified ap
proach encourages intercrop
ping with local foods, thus of
fering a varied diet. The
method builds a healthy soil,
the key to dependable food
production and the building of
a stable economic and social
system."
And, according to a paper
co-authored by leavons, "The
small farm, all factors consi
dered, is actually a more effi
cient unit of production than
its large-scale counterpart. To
quote Sterling Wortman of the
Rockerfeller Foundation, . .
most large-scale mechanized
agriculture is less productive
per unit area than small scale
farming can be. The farmer on
a small holding can engage in
intensive high yield gardening,
systems such as intercropping,
multiple cropping, relay plant
ing or other techniques that
require attention to individual
plants. The point is that
mechanized agriculture is very
productive in terms of output
per man-year, but it is not as
productive per unit of land as
the highly intensive systems
are.' Much of the economic
advantage large farms now
enjoy is not due to any stream
lining inherent in their size but
in the tax structures and sub
sidies which favor corporate
'tax loss' farming, land specula
tion, and vertical stratification
of the food industry from pro
duction of fertilizers, to farm
ing, to packaging and distribu
tion of food products."
Jeavons is generally unop
timistic

about the
prospects
for a rapid
change
from our
current ag
ricultural
practices,
projecting
50years as a
minimum

before such a transformation
will be started on a large scale.
"The thing that has always con
fused me," he told me, "is why
so few people have asked why
can't we keep the organic,
small-scale simplicity and also
have the sophistication of
modern science. I think one
reason why people don't get
into that too much is because
they're thinking on a closed

system basis — and it gets away
from a growth economy.
There's no audience for this in
this country, very few people
living that kind of lifestyle.
They're not putting their
energy into making it happen.
They're still chasing the growth
economy that is epitomized by
the development of the tractor
and the chemical fertilizers."
Lemmings have at least one
thing to recommend them
over mankind — at least when
they rush to their destruction,
•they do not drag the rest of the
planet with them. But mankind
has at least one thing to re
commend it over lemmings: at
least as it rushes to its destruc
tion, it can see where it is going
and attempt to stop before it is

too late.
It often
seems,
however,
that rather
than at
tempting to
stop our
sprint to
ward an
nihilation,

one part of
our species is actively engaged
in accelerating our progress
while the other part fiddles
marching tunes like a whole
race of carefree Neros. We find
our leaders more concerned
with their own destinies than
those of the people they are
supposed to lead; we find, in
fact, that they seem to have no
awareness of any destiny other
than their own. We find them
structuring our culture for
their own ends, without regard
for any future more distant
than the probable span of their
lives. We find an educational
system which perpetuates
their narrow-sightedness. We
at the summit of our culture
find ourselves in the midst of a
highly-sophisticated,
apparently-benign process
which teaches us to shut our
eyes and go faster.
But then it can not be de
nied: the power of vision has
not left us entirely; there are
those who do stretch their
necks to look around. It is no
doubt painful and traumatic to
take a long look at the destruc
tion which we are cultivating.
But there are, these people tell
us, other views, views as prom
ising as the scene immediately
before us is threatening. And,
hope being what it is, they are
working to divert our rush.
)eavons, obviously, is such a
man. He is not militant, anar
chistic, alienated, alienating or
bitter. As he says, "you don't
really need to change the sys
tem to live a better life."
leavons is just quietly pursuing
his work, doing what he can to
bring about an improvement in
the attitude of our culture.

Grow More Vegetables Than
You Ever Thought Possible
On Less Land Than You Can

Mexico, Canada and Nepal.


The headquarters of the Syn
tex Corporation is located
on a hillside just west of Footh
ill Expressway, across from
Palo Alto's Veterans Administ
ration Hospital. A large cement
and glass building in the mod
ern architectural style, it sits on
a very green and well-groomed
lawn. At the foot of the hill,
however, literally a stone's
throw away from the
chemical-pharmaceuticals bas
tion, an incongruous sight pre
sents itself: a truck garden, in
the best tradition of truck gar
dens. It is a disorderly collage
of colors and textures — the
lush green of crops and weeds,
the crumbling dark brown of
newly turned earth, the dry
light brown of withered vege
tation, the dusty white sheen
of sheet plastic, the hard lustre
less gray of metal siding.

A casual passerby, observing
the two establishments, would
be likely to see in their proxim
ity the tension which often
exists between the new and
dynamic and the old and static.
Palo Aito, he might surmise, is
in the final stages of a
metamorphosis from the pas
toral to the cosmopolitan; the
garden, a quaint anachronism,
will soon be the site of yet
another corporate headquar
ters and the cement and glass
building on the hillside will ac
quire, by comparison, an air of
establishment and seniority.

Such is not the case, how
ever. Quite to the contrary, the
cement and glass building
antedates the garden; the land
on which the garden is located
is owned by the corporation
and worked by the garden's
proprietors under the terms of
a rent-free lease; the operation
of the garden is partially sub
sidized, with virtually no return
obligations, by the corpora
tion's donation, in addition to
the land, of water and funds. It
is an unusual situation, but it is
an unusual truck garden.
Foods ranging from grains to
fruit to beans to vegetables are
under cultivation there. The
yield of any given foodstuff at
any given harvest time typically
ranges from two to 31 times the
national, California or Santa
Clara County average
(whichever is higher). From
one-half to one-sixteenth the
average amount of water per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. From one-half to
one-sixteenth the average
amount of nitrogen fertilizer
per pound of food produced is
typically used. About one
one-hundredth the energy per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. No "chemical" fer
tilizer is used. Mo pesticides of
any type are used. No machin
ery more sophisticated than a
simple wheelbarrow is used.
And it is not uncommon to see
men and women in business
dress entering or leaving the
garden or engaged in some
phase of agriculture.
Despite these arresting facts,
the garden and its proprietors
remain surprisingly anonym
ous. Perhaps it is the
previously-described undis
tinguished character of the
former, or maybe it is the
quiet, unassuming style of the
latter. It may even be that it has
less to do with either the
former or latter than the nature
of the rest of the world. What
ever the case, it would be a
poor bet indeed to wager that
that anonymity is to be pre
served for very much longer.
Although I have been in
terested in food in general
and gardening in specific for
much of my life, the terms
"biodynamic" and "French in
tensive" remained obscure to
me until I made the acquain
tance of John leavons. An
alumnus of Yale and former
head of Business Services for
the Stanford library system,
leavons currently wields the

ponderous title of Director of
Agricultural Research for Ecol
ogy Action of the Midpenin
sula.
It is largely Jeavons who is
responsible for the present
shape — in both a physLal and
an abstract sense — of the ag
ricultural program underway
on the three and three-quarter
acre plot of Syntex land. It was
Jeavons who, after making a
study on his own initiative of
United Nations iand use and

population
figures, be
came con
vinced that
the planet
was still
capable of
feeding all
her in
habitants;
it was he
who, after
attending a
seminar on
the agricul
tural
techniques

synthesized by the Englishman
Alan Chadwick, sought out the
master horticulturalist in his
barren hillside-turned Garden
of Eden at the University of
California at Santa Cruz; it was
Jeavons who, after talking at
length with Chadwick, prop
osed the idea of a combined
research and community gar
den to the board of directors of
Ecology Action, a Palo Alto
conservation group which had
won recognition for a success
ful city-wide recycling prog-

ram; it was he who, after con
vincing them of the viability
and significance of such a
program, proceeded to as
semble the elements of Com
mon Ground — land, funds,
people — and embark on a
course of rigorous scientific
research.
The program is now in its
sixth year. Each succeeding
year has, according to Jeavons,
confirmed his faith in Chad
wick's techniques, known now
as the biodynamic-French in
tensive method.
When I first spoke with
leavons, I had a vague recollec
tion of a chapter in a gardening
book which had described a
"labor-intensive" system of
farming which allowed the
densely-populated countries
of western Europe to grow
much food on little land. This, I
imagined, was related to
"French-intensive" farming. In
his articulate and methodical
way, Jeavons soon clarified and
expanded this conception —
and made me realize how large
a topic this form of agriculture
had become.
"The method we're using
now," he said, "is made up of
two techniques that were de
veloped in Europe around the
turn of the century. The French
intensive method is one—that
reached its culmination in the
1890s outside Paris. What it did
was it raised vegetables in beds
that consisted of 18 inches of
horse manure — which was re
ally plentiful at the time. Be
cause of this high level of or
ganic matter and the fertility it
created, as well as the great
depth of loose material, roots
were able to grow downward
instead of needing room to
grow out horizontally. So they
were able to use very close
spacing."
This simple concept, leavons
continued, accounts for a sig
nificant part of the increased
yields which the method pro
duces. As jeavons phrased it in
a research report summarizing
Common Ground's first four
years, "A simple 24-inch deep
soil preparation allows the

plants to be spaced more
closely so that their leaves
touch or almost touch. . . .
This factor alone would make
fourfold yields possible be
cause four times as many
plants as usual can be planted
in a given area."
"The other technique,"
Jeavons told me, "was the
biodynamic technique. It was
developed in the 1920s by
Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian
genius who was into educa
tion, philosophy, religion, and
agriculture. The French inten
sive method had been de
veloped over hundreds of
years by French marchiers or
gardeners. The biodynamic
method, though, was de
veloped by Steiner in the late
'20s fora lot of wealthy German
farmers who had noticed that
their yields were going down
and they were getting more in
sect and disease problems. It
turned out they had been using
chemical fertilizers. Urea, a
kind of artifical nitrogen, had
been developed in the late
1880s. Steiner traced their
problems to the chemical fer
tilizers and suggested that they
return to some of their old
methods and adopt five special
practices. These practices be
camethe biodynamic method.
"One was the use of raised
beds — beds only 12 inches
deep prepared by raking soil
out of the path. This was going
back to the Greeks who found
out that plants grew better in
landslides. The raised beds as
they came to be dug were like
little, artificial landslides. The
reasons the plants do better in
them is because the soil is
looser and there's more air or
gases in it — you need up to 50
percent gases for good plant
growth."
jeavons frequently uses the
verb "dovetail" to describe
areas where two concepts in
termesh or compliment each
other. The deep soil prepara
tion and close spacing of the
French intensive method
dovetails, he said, with the "ar
tificial landslides" of the
biodynamic method to pro

duce healthier, more produc
tive plants.
"There was a study in the '50s
at the University of California
at Berkeley," he said, "that
showed that if you improved
root health by two to four per
cent for most common field
crops you could increase the
yields by 200 to 400 percent.
One of the things which can
make this possible is better soil
preparation and aeration. With
our method, you have more air
in the soil, more surface area
for contact between soil and air
since a raised bed has a curved
surface and also more surface
area to absorb rain or watering
and warmth from the sun. And
the curved surface also allows
you to increase the planting
area by 20 percent. Say you
have a plot of land that's a
hundred square feet and you
make it a raised bed, you can
wind up with 120 square feet of
planting area.
"The second technique that
Steiner recommended, after
the raised beds — which inci
dentally may even have gone
back even before the Greeks to
the Chinese, possibly 4000
years ago — was the use of or
ganic fertilizers. Chemical fer
tilizers at the time were mainly
just nitrogen or nitrogen and
phosphorous. They weren't
balanced or complete; they
needed trace minerals and
potash. Also the chemical fer
tilizers broke down very
quickly and harmed the texture
and structure of the soil and
killed the microbiotic life and

so forth. So Steiner asked the
German farmers to return to
organic fertilizers that were
more balanced and diverse —
like fish meal which has nitro
gen, phosphorous and trace
mi nerals and breaks down over
a period of six months instead
of four to six weeks.
"The third technique was
companion planting. There
were a lot of folk myths about
what things to grow well to
gether. Steiner tried to scienti
fically investigate this through
such techniques as
chromatography and crystalli
zation and field testing to de
termine which plants grown
together would do better. For
instance, one part chamomile
grown with two hundred parts
of wheat increases the health
and yield of wheat. But if its
one to one, one part
chamomile grown with one
part wheat, the wheat will be
destroyed, or at least seriously
harmed.
"Another technique was the
use of herbal sprays. At one
point they were almost a cult.
You take stinging nettles, for
example, and you do some
thing like — I can't remember
exactly — bury it three feet
under the ground at a certain
conjunction of the plants and
leave it under there for six
months and dig it up and mix it
in with a water solution and
then spray it on the ground. It's
supposed to stimulate the
micorobiotic life of the soil
which helps the plants. Really
far out, really unusual, but it
works.
"And the fifth thing was
planting by the phases of the
moon. The rationale for this
comes from seeing the moon's
effect on oceans — daily tides
of up to 40 feet in some parts of
the world. There's water in the
ground, in seeds and in plants
so it seems there might be a
small effect there.
"So those were the two
threads — the French intensive
method and Steiner's five
biodynamic techniques.
"Now, Chadwick, who is, I
think, a horticultural genius,

certainly a horticultural artist,
put these two techniques to
gether sometime between the
1930s and the 1960s when he
came to Santa Cruz. He had
been severely exasperated by
the second world war. A
woman named Freiavon Molka
and he got together and de
cided that one of the best ways
to bring peace and life and
harmony back into the world
was through gardens. Chad
wick had studied under the
French marchiers and he had
studied under Steiner. He's
had over 50 years of experience
in raising food. He also worked
under George Bernard Shaw in
drama, he's a painter, an actor,
an incredible individual — very
dramatic in his presentation of
things.
"When he put the two farm
ing techniques together, he
simplified them. Where
Steiner would make herbal
preparations, Chadwick would
just grow the herb, the stinging
nettle say, in the bed and then
put it in the compost pile and
let it have a living kind of influ
ence. Instead of using dead
mulches he used living mulch
— when the plants are so close
together that their leaves just
about touch, the ground is
shaded, moisture is con
served, a micro-climate is
created. So his whole orienta
tion is using living plants and
giving to nature as much as she
produces and even a little
more. If you give to nature
more than she gives you, she
will continually provide you
with abundance.
"So Chadwick prepares his
beds 24 inches deep, not just
18, he uses compost mainly
from vegetable matter, he uses
very little manure — in contrast
with the French and in contrast
with the other biodynamic
people who sometimes use a
lot of manure. This is important
worldwide because one-third
of the world's people now have
a different kind of energy
crisis: they don't have enough
firewood. So like in India,
they're burning the manure
from animals to heat their
homes and to cook their food.
There's a fertilizer shortage
there. But you don't need the
manure under Chadwick's
technique; most of it is veget
able compost, as I said.
"So he uses 24-inch-deep
soil preparation; close spac
ing; comparatively speaking, a
vegetarian or quasi-vegetarian
compost that's two-thirds veg
etable matter, one-third soil;
he uses living herbs rather than
herbal sprays, generally; he
uses some organic fertilizers,
mainly bone meal but not
much else; and he plants by
the phases of the moon."
/ / K| ow we started re-
searching the method
in 1972. Our purposes were
twofold. One was to document
how the method was done — it
had never been documented
in written form because Chad
wick doesn't believe in the
written word but by handing
things down by example and
by word of mouth, master to
apprentice and so forth. Also it
had been reputed that the
method produced four times
the average yield, but this had
never been documented one
way or another.
"The lot Syntex gave us had a
soil which was one-third rock
— meaning pebbles and stuff.
Normal agricultural soil is
maybe five percent rock, not 33
percent. In addition, our soil
was over one-third clay. There
was no nitrogen fertilizer in the
soil and just a trace of phos
phorous and potash.
"During our first five years
we got very encouraging re
sults — yields which ranged
anywhere from two to 16 times
the U.S., Santa Clara County or
California averages. Then in
1976, I developed a new

technique called 'superdig
ging' which is a sort of a super
texturizing technique. This
technique improves the soil
more rapidly. It takes up to five
years using normal techniques
to improve the soil. Re
member, we were in subsoil
clay with no top soil at all. As a
result of this new technique,
this year we've gone as high as
about 60 times the Santa Clara
County average with zucchini
using about two percent of the
water per pound of food pro
duced and one percent of the
added nitrogen fertilizer per
pound of food produced. In
the case of grain, we're as high
as two and a quarter times the
national average on soybeans,

double on
wheat and
expect to
go six to
eight times
for those
yields.
Also, we
expect to
be using
one third to
one-eighth
the water
per pound
of grain
produced
— and that
could be
significant
because it
means you

could be getting very high
grain yields with as little as
eight or 10 inches of rainfall.
Over 75 percent of the arable
area of the world has 10 or
more inches of rainfall.
"An interesting thing is that
the Zulus of South Africa use a
similar technique — similar to
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method, that is, that they
developed on their own. It's a
triple-digging technique, lust
before it rains they prepare the
soil three feet deep and as
soon as it does rain they plant
their grain. It doesn't rain all
summer and is very dry. They
grow grain when no one else
can grow grain anywhere. So
here's a similar technique
that's working under natural
rainfall conditions.
"What this means is that if
we reach all of our projections,
we would be getting an aver
age of four to eight times on
vegetables and six to eight
times the average yield on
grain. And these yields, by the
way are already being obtained
somewhere else in the world
on the average — and on a
large scale basis. A way to high
light this is to say that for every
major crop grown in the Un
ited States, some other country
in the world on the average is
getting a yield about twice as
high. So U.S. agriculture,
though it may look good, is not
the best with all crops."
One morning soon after our
first conversation, I met
Jeavons for a tour of the Com
mon Ground garden. He is
plainly in his element there. A
fairly large man in his mid-30s
he sports an incipient pot belly
and a voluminous though
well-behaved beard. He was
dressed in mud-spattered
work pants, a heavy flannel
shirt and a sweat-stained
leather cap. He generally main
tains a serious demeanor al
though when he smiles he re
veals a considerable capacity
for simple delight. His eyes
especially, manifest his posi
tive attitude: whether engaged
in a visual analysis of crop
progress, gazing at clouds in
the distance or glancing at his
auditor, they are intelligent,
energetic, unusually alive.
He took me first to some
thing he called an "herbal
lawn." From a distance, this
looked similar to a grass lawn
— green and flat. Standing next
to it, however, I saw that its

color was not uniform. In
terspersed among the light
green of sweet clover were
plants of darker shades —
identified by Jeavons as Roman
chamomile, creeping thyme
and dwarf yarrow. In addition
to being "simple and beauti
ful," Jeavons said, the lawn
fixes nitrogen in the soil and
concentrates phosphorous
and potash in its leaves. It is
thus beneficial to the soil on
which it is grown and can be
mown as a source of
nutriment-rich compost.
For the next hour we looked
at such things as newly-planted
fruit trees, fragrant and useful
herbs, fallow planting beds,
freshly-prepared planting

beds, planting beds overflow
ing with mature vegetables and
legumes, and recently har
vested planting beds. All the
while Jeavons kept up an in
teresting commentary filled
with odd facts and anecdotes.
"You see those nicely dug beds
over there?" he asked at one
point. "Those were prepared
by a 65-year-old woman with a
heart condition."
Finally, he led me to a
fenced-off area with a pad
locked gate. "This is the re
search garden," he said.
"What we've been looking at is
the community garden. People
from all over, including about
five to 10 percent of all the Syn
tex employees, are involved
with raising food here."
Inside the research garden
were rows of beds each about
six feet wide and 20 feet long. I
was slightly disappointed by
the modest dimensions of the
whole garden — smaller than
that occupied by the average
house — since it seemed that
something larger would be re
quired for such significant re
search.
"This area is about 2500
square feet," Jeavons said as if
reading my thoughts. "Our re
search indicates that a com
pletely balanced diet could be
grown on this much space —
and with as little as a half hour
of work a day. The same
amount of food, if it were
grown by U.S. chemical,
mechanized techniques would
take 10,000 square feet. In In
dia, the same diet would take
32,000 square feet.
"Now, the average American
eats 322 pounds of vegetables
and soft fruits — fruits like
strawberries, cantalopes and
watermelon — a year. Two
hundred and twenty of those
pounds are potatoes. You can
grow that amount of vegeta
bles with the biodynamic-
French intensive method in 100
square feet in a four to six
month growing season. In the
case of fruit trees, you can put
two of them in a hundred
square foot bed on eight foot
centers. Each of those fruit
trees should produce a
hundred pounds of hard fruit
per year and the average
American eats 162 pounds of
hard fruit a year. It should take
you maybe a half a minute to a
minute a day to take care of the
trees on an average basis and it
should take you about five to
10 minutes a day to take care of

the vegetable bed.
"So what we're talking about
is eventually people can start
raising a fair amount of their
food just in their back yard. A
family of four, in 400 square
feet, could raise in a four to six
month growing season food
worth $480 in five to 10 minutes
a day each. Their labor would
then be worth $4 to $8 an hour.
Now a person is probably not
going to do this the first year if
he's never gardened before,
but he's going to do a lot better
than he's done with other
techniques. What this means
for overseas, for India, for
example, where they have fer
tilizer shortages, energy shor
tages, water shortages and
food shortages, is that in a
small area, say 2500 to 7000
square feet they could raise
their total diet rather than in
32,000 square feet. So small is
beautiful: in this country, de
escalation of technology; for
overseas, a move to more self
sufficiency."
We moved to a bed with
some dried leaves and with
ered stalks in it which I recog
nized as potatoes, leavons
went on.
"Now in monetary terms,
with potatoes, we're now at
four times the national average
but we expect to go much
higher— maybe well above 20.
We're still experimenting with
that. I can't tell you on the re
cord how high we expect to go
but I can say on the record it's
over 20. With zucchini, when
we got only 16 times the Santa
Clara county average, the bed
produced $12.50 an hour — or
would have if we'd sold it all at
the wholesale rate. Now that
we're up to 60, we're talking
about producing three times
that or $37.50 an hour. This is
an extreme case but it should
be possible to earn a minimum
of $4 an hour just raising your
own vegetables.
"We're guessing that a new
kind of job or profession will
come out of all of this — mini
farming. We estimate that it
will be possible for one person
working a 40-hour week to
raise $15,000 net on as little as a
quarter of an acre. Currently
small farmers with farms of 200
to4oo acres are lucky if they net
several thousand dollars.
"So our philosophy is one of
low techonology, that is, simple
technology but sophisticated
theory. And I should say that
we're not a 'labor-intensive'
method as many people have
said we are. It's actually 'skill
intensive.' Bed preparation
may be the hardest job of the
method but once the soil is in
good shape and using a new
device that they've developed
in Canada, it should be possi
ble to prepare a bed in five to
10 minutes.
"All the resources that we
need to raise food right are av
ailable— we're just using them
in the wrong way. Take wheat
production, for example.
Normally to produce more
grain you have to use a lot
more fertilizer. For instance
with corn, from 1940 to 1960,
the nitrogen fertilizer use in
creased 10-fold, but the yields
only doubled. So your fertilizer
effectiveness was only one
fifth as good in 1960 as it was in
1940. Well, we cut our nitrogen
fertilizer use in one year to
one-half and the yield dou
bled. At the same time the pro
tein content increased. It went
from 14.8 percent to 15.7.
Normally when your yields go
up, your protein content per
pound of food goes down. Plus
we used less water and less
energy, less phosphorous and
less potash.
"Eventually, if we get all the
projections that we expect to
get, we'll be producing as
much food per hour as people
with machines can produce. So
this makes the individual im

portant again and gives the in
dividual a choice.
"I should stress that we've
got a ways to go yet. We don't
have a perfect system. We have
failures; we haven't reached all
our projections, but we've had
a lot of good results too.
"Right now, we think if the
method has an Achilles heel, it
will be in the net flow of or
ganic matter in and out of the
soil. We may have to face the
possibility that with the yields
we're now getting, we'll
exhaust the soil in a few more
years. The most important
thing about an agricultural
method is whether it is sustain
able in an environmentally ba
lanced way. The Chinese have
been able for hundreds of
years to grow twice as much
food as the United States does
now. And by using manual, or
ganic techniques and fertiliz
ers grown or produced on their
farms. But we may have to face
the possibility that our sustain
able yield level will be less than
our optimum yield level."
Jeavons turned away from
the potato bed and regarded
me fora moment, as if to make
sure I had understood every
thing up to that point. After tak
ing a deep breath, he turned
and pointed to a pair of
plastic-covered structures
which were, evidently,
greenhouses. One was very
similar in appearance to a con
ventional greenhouse but the
other one was only three feet
high and just covered one
hundred-square-foot bed.
"Now with these miniature
greenhouses," Jeavons said,
"a 12-month growing season is
possible in most climates
where food is grown. What this
means is you could grow your
total diet on as little as 1250
square feet working as little as
15 minutes a day." He walked
to the center of the area and
spread his arms. "That's this
much," he said, his tone imply
ing how little he thought 1250
square feet to be. I was a little
incredulous for a moment be
cause the space he indicated
really seemed no larger than
the average living room. But
then I remembered that an
acre is somewhat more than
40,000 square feet. I had no
trouble believing that the de
signated area was about a thir
tieth of an acre. "And, he said,
with a smile, "even though it's
too early to say on the record,
we expect to go much, much
lower than that to grow a total
diet."

In 1840 the German chemist
Justus von Liebig published a
paper entitled "Chemistry in
its application to agriculture
and physiology." This event,
giving birth to a whole new ap •
proach to the cultivation of
food — which I will call "chem
ical agriculture" — intruded
into the gradual evolution of
farming with all the virulence
of a malignant tumor.
It is true that relatively little
change had taken place in ag
riculture since the dawn of
civilization — 4000 years or

more if one goes back to the
Chinese farmers mentioned by
Jeavons; it is true that during
the period in which chemical
agriculture was developed in
earnest — from the 1880s to the
1920s — the world's population
was growing at a heretofore
unimaginable rate; and it is
true that many well
intentioned people saw in
chemical agriculture the only
means of putting food in the
staggering number of new and
hungry mouths.
It is also true, however, that
concurrent with the rise of
chemical agriculture were the
several great strides outlined
by Jeavons — the strides which
developed in a relatively short
time into the biodynamic-
French intensive method. As
chemical agriculture
burgeoned into an industry
and an orthodoxy, men such as
Rudolf Steiner — and he was
far from alone — recognized
the folly of abandoning
methods proven over millenia
for new and untried
techniques. On the next occa
sion on which I met with
jeavons, I asked him what he
believed were the causes for
the headlong rush toward
chemicals in the face of saner
councils.
"Well, part of the reason,"
he said, "was that as chemical
fertilizers came into play, trac
tors were being developed and
brought into use on many
farms. This made it possible to
spread chemical fertilizer very
easily. It was less time
consuming than spreading
manures. Also, with the tractor
you were able to farm large
areas. Even though it wasn't in
tensive, you could farm a large
area and produce a lot of food
in a very short time. The prom
ise of opening up increased ac
reage was very seductive. To
most people, two to four times
the area meant two to four
times the food. On the other
hand, the French intensive cul
ture that was developed out
side Paris required an awful lot
of people per acre. So with
everyone getting caught up in
the petrochemical
mechanized revolution, the
tendency was to equate 'faster'
with 'more and better.' Which
for a short time was probably
true. But if we get into today's
period, the petrochemicals are
getting more expensive so
spending more time and labor
to get the same amount of food
isn't as unappealing as it used
to be. But more important, I

believe,
from the
perspective
of our re
search, is
that we be
lieve we're
going to be
able to
produce as
much food
per hour as
a machine
can — by
hand. The
way that
we're going
to be able
to do this is
by thinking
about

what's been done in the past,
about what's being done cur
rently, and maximizing the
simplicity which produces the
time efficiency."
During the course of the last
half century, many of the
spokesmen for non-chemical
agriculture have found them
selves ostracized for their be
liefs and techniques. At best
they have been ignored by the
academic and political estab
lishment, at worst they have
been actively harassed and
obstructed in presenting their
cases before the public. One of


these men, Sir Albert Howard,
an Imperial Botanist for the In
dian government, "did some
fantastic things," according to
Jeavons. "Everyone had told
him he couldn't grow cotton
organically in India because
the pests would eat it up. It
took him a while but at the end
of five years, he was growing
cotton organically — with no
pesticides. He had less crop
loss than the people who were
using pesticides."
Although knighted for this
and other accomplishments,
Howard received so much pub
lic ridicule — both from fer-

tilizer in
dustry
spokesmen
and his fel
low scien
tists — that
his ideas
went
widely un
heeded.
Howard
wrote, after

addressing one particularly
nonreceptive audience of
botanists, "Here again I was
amazed by the limited know
ledge and experience of the
world's agriculturalists dis
closed by this debate. I felt I
was dealing with beginners
and that some of the argu
ments put forward could al
most be described as the im
pertinences of ignorance."
In this country, the case of
|.l. Rodale, whose publications
are among the standard refer
ences for a large segment of
the organic farming popula
tion, is not unusual. Rodale
was forced to spend almost a
quarter of a million dollars in
legal fees to win a court deci
sion over the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission which had
blocked the publication of his
book "The Health Finder."
I asked )eavons whether he
thought these examples indi
cated the presence of an estab
lishment which had a vested in
terest in the development and
maintenance of chemical ag
riculture irrespective of the
best interests of mankind. It
was true, he said, that
"businessmen are always
ready to take advantage of a
good thing and push it to the
fullest," but there were proba
bly "two separate thrusts" —
business incentives and desire
for greater efficiency — which
"then became merged."
leavons then related an in
teresting anecdote, most of
which had to remain off the re
cord, which was a telling
statement about the present
state of agricultural research.
"It was amazing to me," he
said, "that agricultural schools
are not more interested in re
search like that (Howard's),
and in trying to replicate it — at
least as an alternative ap
proach. I wrote a letter to an
individual who was involved in
agricultural research at a col
lege here in California. I told
him I was confused. In the light
of some of the possibilities we
were uncovering with the
biodynamic-French intensive
method, why wasn't anyone
investigating our results. He
wrote me back a very good let
ter. He indicated that the re
search money is coming from
thechemical industriesand the
agricultural interests. They
have an interest in using the
system they've already got.
And again, their purpose is
making money from it, not
necessarily making it better. So
you see, the professors almost
have to ridicule alternative
methods. If they go into other
areas, they become profes
sionally ostracized and they
can't get funds."
leavons continued with
another anecdote, this time
regarding a conference about
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method which was held

last year in Santa Barbara. Sev
eral members of the American
Society of Agronomy had at
tended, he said, and had asked
questions about the
mechanisms of the improved
plant growth. "If we couldn't
tell them exactly how it was
happening, in their terms and
language, they wouldn't give it
very much credence. Someone
pointed out that the Romans
knew how to make concrete a
long time before anyone knew
why it worked. There's a kind
of scientific myopia here. It's
like they're saying, you can
only be scientific if you're sci
entific in the way in which we
are scientific. Well, good lord,
if someone's demonstrating
that something is possible,
anyone who's really an open
minded scientist ought to be
excited and interested to find
out why it's possible. But there
aren't any funds for them to do
it."
leavons is not alone in his
observation of "scientific
myopia" in the present
academic community. In April,
1973, Nicholas Wade reported
in Science magazine that "a
blue-ribbon committee of
basic and agricultural scien
tists" found that "the basic re
search performed by federal
and state agricultural research
organizations is of meager
quality, suffers from a 'shock
ing lack of intellectual leader
ship' and is guided by policies
detrimental to the interests of
agriculture."
Although no reference was
made to a lack of attention to
any specific area of research,
University of Chicago Biology
Prof. Richard Levins wrote in a
later issue of Science that "the
issues raised by Nicholas
Wade's report have to be set
into a broader context than
simply the policies of the U.S.
Department of Agricul
ture. . . . Within agricultural
science, America's traditional
anti-intellectualism survives as
an antitheoretical bias. . . .It is
reinforced by the search for
marketable products (mostly
chemical) as the central
strategy for improvement of
agriculture . . . and by a nar
row acceptance of the present
structure of agriculture as a
given condition which restricts
options. For example, the con
sideration of mixed plantings is
inhibited by the present design
of farm machinery."
The tone of both articles asks
the question, "Ought we to let
this happen?" The tone taken
increasingly by more and more
far-sighted scientists today,
however, is "Can we afford to
let this happen?" jeavons him
self points to the dwindling
supply of natural gas — the
current reserves of which are
slated to run out in about a de
cade — as one factor which
could lead to an agricultural
disaster. Since the production
of artificial nitrogen fertilizer
has been made almost wholly
dependent on natural gas, he
says, and since there is evi-

dence indi
cating that
nitrogen fi
xation from
the air by
soil bac
teria stops
in the pre
sence of ar
tificial fer
tilizer
which in

turn causes a soil "addiction"
to this form of fertilizer, it
seems likely that we will be
faced with the necessity of
using pollution-producing coal
to satisfy our farmlands'
"habit." And even the coal
supply will someday be
exhausted.
Yet even if the scarcity of
energy were not an issue, the
question would still be a valid
one. In addition to beini:


ecologically unsound, our pre
sent system of food production
is economically and technolog
ically unsatisfactory for a large
segment of the world's popula
tion. As Frances Moore Lappe
and ]oseph Collins de
monstrate in their book, Food
First, the expensive technology
and inflated prices which "ag
ribusiness" and its "global
supermarket" force on unde
veloped nations do as much to
hinder their progress as any
other single factor.
Jeavons' belief is that the
solution to many of the world's
food-related problems —
ecological, economical and
technological — lies in a global
move to small-scale farming. A
February, 1976 paper released
by Ecology Action states that
"the current food shortages
will worsen into a crisis of
global proportions unless the
productivity of the 100 million
small farms in the developing
world is increased dramati
cally. Several key points make
the biodynamic-Fiench inten
sive method especially viable
in countries with limited re
sources: The method does not
require complicated machin
ery or expensive fertilizers.
The key technological element
is the common shovel. The
method uses 1/2 to 1/16 the wa
ter. This will be especially valu
able in arid areas of the world,
or those limited to natural rain
fall. The method provides a
self-sufficient livelihood in
areas of high unemployment.
The method's diversified ap
proach encourages intercrop
ping with local foods, thus of
fering a varied diet. The
method builds a healthy soil,
the key to dependable food
production and the building of
a stable economic and social
system."
And, according to a paper
co-authored by leavons, "The
small farm, all factors consi
dered, is actually a more effi
cient unit of production than
its large-scale counterpart. To
quote Sterling Wortman of the
Rockerfeller Foundation, . .
most large-scale mechanized
agriculture is less productive
per unit area than small scale
farming can be. The farmer on
a small holding can engage in
intensive high yield gardening,
systems such as intercropping,
multiple cropping, relay plant
ing or other techniques that
require attention to individual
plants. The point is that
mechanized agriculture is very
productive in terms of output
per man-year, but it is not as
productive per unit of land as
the highly intensive systems
are.' Much of the economic
advantage large farms now
enjoy is not due to any stream
lining inherent in their size but
in the tax structures and sub
sidies which favor corporate
'tax loss' farming, land specula
tion, and vertical stratification
of the food industry from pro
duction of fertilizers, to farm
ing, to packaging and distribu
tion of food products."
Jeavons is generally unop
timistic

about the
prospects
for a rapid
change
from our
current ag
ricultural
practices,
projecting
50years as a
minimum

before such a transformation
will be started on a large scale.
"The thing that has always con
fused me," he told me, "is why
so few people have asked why
can't we keep the organic,
small-scale simplicity and also
have the sophistication of
modern science. I think one
reason why people don't get
into that too much is because
they're thinking on a closed

system basis — and it gets away
from a growth economy.
There's no audience for this in
this country, very few people
living that kind of lifestyle.
They're not putting their
energy into making it happen.
They're still chasing the growth
economy that is epitomized by
the development of the tractor
and the chemical fertilizers."
Lemmings have at least one
thing to recommend them
over mankind — at least when
they rush to their destruction,
•they do not drag the rest of the
planet with them. But mankind
has at least one thing to re
commend it over lemmings: at
least as it rushes to its destruc
tion, it can see where it is going
and attempt to stop before it is

too late.
It often
seems,
however,
that rather
than at
tempting to
stop our
sprint to
ward an
nihilation,

one part of
our species is actively engaged
in accelerating our progress
while the other part fiddles
marching tunes like a whole
race of carefree Neros. We find
our leaders more concerned
with their own destinies than
those of the people they are
supposed to lead; we find, in
fact, that they seem to have no
awareness of any destiny other
than their own. We find them
structuring our culture for
their own ends, without regard
for any future more distant
than the probable span of their
lives. We find an educational
system which perpetuates
their narrow-sightedness. We
at the summit of our culture
find ourselves in the midst of a
highly-sophisticated,
apparently-benign process
which teaches us to shut our
eyes and go faster.
But then it can not be de
nied: the power of vision has
not left us entirely; there are
those who do stretch their
necks to look around. It is no
doubt painful and traumatic to
take a long look at the destruc
tion which we are cultivating.
But there are, these people tell
us, other views, views as prom
ising as the scene immediately
before us is threatening. And,
hope being what it is, they are
working to divert our rush.
)eavons, obviously, is such a
man. He is not militant, anar
chistic, alienated, alienating or
bitter. As he says, "you don't
really need to change the sys
tem to live a better life."
leavons is just quietly pursuing
his work, doing what he can to
bring about an improvement in
the attitude of our culture.

The headquarters of the Syn
tex Corporation is located
on a hillside just west of Footh
ill Expressway, across from
Palo Alto's Veterans Administ
ration Hospital. A large cement
and glass building in the mod
ern architectural style, it sits on
a very green and well-groomed
lawn. At the foot of the hill,
however, literally a stone's
throw away from the
chemical-pharmaceuticals bas
tion, an incongruous sight pre
sents itself: a truck garden, in
the best tradition of truck gar
dens. It is a disorderly collage
of colors and textures — the
lush green of crops and weeds,
the crumbling dark brown of
newly turned earth, the dry
light brown of withered vege
tation, the dusty white sheen
of sheet plastic, the hard lustre
less gray of metal siding.

A casual passerby, observing
the two establishments, would
be likely to see in their proxim
ity the tension which often
exists between the new and
dynamic and the old and static.
Palo Aito, he might surmise, is
in the final stages of a
metamorphosis from the pas
toral to the cosmopolitan; the
garden, a quaint anachronism,
will soon be the site of yet
another corporate headquar
ters and the cement and glass
building on the hillside will ac
quire, by comparison, an air of
establishment and seniority.

Such is not the case, how
ever. Quite to the contrary, the
cement and glass building
antedates the garden; the land
on which the garden is located
is owned by the corporation
and worked by the garden's
proprietors under the terms of
a rent-free lease; the operation
of the garden is partially sub
sidized, with virtually no return
obligations, by the corpora
tion's donation, in addition to
the land, of water and funds. It
is an unusual situation, but it is
an unusual truck garden.
Foods ranging from grains to
fruit to beans to vegetables are
under cultivation there. The
yield of any given foodstuff at
any given harvest time typically
ranges from two to 31 times the
national, California or Santa
Clara County average
(whichever is higher). From
one-half to one-sixteenth the
average amount of water per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. From one-half to
one-sixteenth the average
amount of nitrogen fertilizer
per pound of food produced is
typically used. About one
one-hundredth the energy per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. No "chemical" fer
tilizer is used. Mo pesticides of
any type are used. No machin
ery more sophisticated than a
simple wheelbarrow is used.
And it is not uncommon to see
men and women in business
dress entering or leaving the
garden or engaged in some
phase of agriculture.
Despite these arresting facts,
the garden and its proprietors
remain surprisingly anonym
ous. Perhaps it is the
previously-described undis
tinguished character of the
former, or maybe it is the
quiet, unassuming style of the
latter. It may even be that it has
less to do with either the
former or latter than the nature
of the rest of the world. What
ever the case, it would be a
poor bet indeed to wager that
that anonymity is to be pre
served for very much longer.
Although I have been in
terested in food in general
and gardening in specific for
much of my life, the terms
"biodynamic" and "French in
tensive" remained obscure to
me until I made the acquain
tance of John leavons. An
alumnus of Yale and former
head of Business Services for
the Stanford library system,
leavons currently wields the

ponderous title of Director of
Agricultural Research for Ecol
ogy Action of the Midpenin
sula.
It is largely Jeavons who is
responsible for the present
shape — in both a physLal and
an abstract sense — of the ag
ricultural program underway
on the three and three-quarter
acre plot of Syntex land. It was
Jeavons who, after making a
study on his own initiative of
United Nations iand use and

population
figures, be
came con
vinced that
the planet
was still
capable of
feeding all
her in
habitants;
it was he
who, after
attending a
seminar on
the agricul
tural
techniques

synthesized by the Englishman
Alan Chadwick, sought out the
master horticulturalist in his
barren hillside-turned Garden
of Eden at the University of
California at Santa Cruz; it was
Jeavons who, after talking at
length with Chadwick, prop
osed the idea of a combined
research and community gar
den to the board of directors of
Ecology Action, a Palo Alto
conservation group which had
won recognition for a success
ful city-wide recycling prog-

ram; it was he who, after con
vincing them of the viability
and significance of such a
program, proceeded to as
semble the elements of Com
mon Ground — land, funds,
people — and embark on a
course of rigorous scientific
research.
The program is now in its
sixth year. Each succeeding
year has, according to Jeavons,
confirmed his faith in Chad
wick's techniques, known now
as the biodynamic-French in
tensive method.
When I first spoke with
leavons, I had a vague recollec
tion of a chapter in a gardening
book which had described a
"labor-intensive" system of
farming which allowed the
densely-populated countries
of western Europe to grow
much food on little land. This, I
imagined, was related to
"French-intensive" farming. In
his articulate and methodical
way, Jeavons soon clarified and
expanded this conception —
and made me realize how large
a topic this form of agriculture
had become.
"The method we're using
now," he said, "is made up of
two techniques that were de
veloped in Europe around the
turn of the century. The French
intensive method is one—that
reached its culmination in the
1890s outside Paris. What it did
was it raised vegetables in beds
that consisted of 18 inches of
horse manure — which was re
ally plentiful at the time. Be
cause of this high level of or
ganic matter and the fertility it
created, as well as the great
depth of loose material, roots
were able to grow downward
instead of needing room to
grow out horizontally. So they
were able to use very close
spacing."
This simple concept, leavons
continued, accounts for a sig
nificant part of the increased
yields which the method pro
duces. As jeavons phrased it in
a research report summarizing
Common Ground's first four
years, "A simple 24-inch deep
soil preparation allows the

plants to be spaced more
closely so that their leaves
touch or almost touch. . . .
This factor alone would make
fourfold yields possible be
cause four times as many
plants as usual can be planted
in a given area."
"The other technique,"
Jeavons told me, "was the
biodynamic technique. It was
developed in the 1920s by
Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian
genius who was into educa
tion, philosophy, religion, and
agriculture. The French inten
sive method had been de
veloped over hundreds of
years by French marchiers or
gardeners. The biodynamic
method, though, was de
veloped by Steiner in the late
'20s fora lot of wealthy German
farmers who had noticed that
their yields were going down
and they were getting more in
sect and disease problems. It
turned out they had been using
chemical fertilizers. Urea, a
kind of artifical nitrogen, had
been developed in the late
1880s. Steiner traced their
problems to the chemical fer
tilizers and suggested that they
return to some of their old
methods and adopt five special
practices. These practices be
camethe biodynamic method.
"One was the use of raised
beds — beds only 12 inches
deep prepared by raking soil
out of the path. This was going
back to the Greeks who found
out that plants grew better in
landslides. The raised beds as
they came to be dug were like
little, artificial landslides. The
reasons the plants do better in
them is because the soil is
looser and there's more air or
gases in it — you need up to 50
percent gases for good plant
growth."
jeavons frequently uses the
verb "dovetail" to describe
areas where two concepts in
termesh or compliment each
other. The deep soil prepara
tion and close spacing of the
French intensive method
dovetails, he said, with the "ar
tificial landslides" of the
biodynamic method to pro

duce healthier, more produc
tive plants.
"There was a study in the '50s
at the University of California
at Berkeley," he said, "that
showed that if you improved
root health by two to four per
cent for most common field
crops you could increase the
yields by 200 to 400 percent.
One of the things which can
make this possible is better soil
preparation and aeration. With
our method, you have more air
in the soil, more surface area
for contact between soil and air
since a raised bed has a curved
surface and also more surface
area to absorb rain or watering
and warmth from the sun. And
the curved surface also allows
you to increase the planting
area by 20 percent. Say you
have a plot of land that's a
hundred square feet and you
make it a raised bed, you can
wind up with 120 square feet of
planting area.
"The second technique that
Steiner recommended, after
the raised beds — which inci
dentally may even have gone
back even before the Greeks to
the Chinese, possibly 4000
years ago — was the use of or
ganic fertilizers. Chemical fer
tilizers at the time were mainly
just nitrogen or nitrogen and
phosphorous. They weren't
balanced or complete; they
needed trace minerals and
potash. Also the chemical fer
tilizers broke down very
quickly and harmed the texture
and structure of the soil and
killed the microbiotic life and

so forth. So Steiner asked the
German farmers to return to
organic fertilizers that were
more balanced and diverse —
like fish meal which has nitro
gen, phosphorous and trace
mi nerals and breaks down over
a period of six months instead
of four to six weeks.
"The third technique was
companion planting. There
were a lot of folk myths about
what things to grow well to
gether. Steiner tried to scienti
fically investigate this through
such techniques as
chromatography and crystalli
zation and field testing to de
termine which plants grown
together would do better. For
instance, one part chamomile
grown with two hundred parts
of wheat increases the health
and yield of wheat. But if its
one to one, one part
chamomile grown with one
part wheat, the wheat will be
destroyed, or at least seriously
harmed.
"Another technique was the
use of herbal sprays. At one
point they were almost a cult.
You take stinging nettles, for
example, and you do some
thing like — I can't remember
exactly — bury it three feet
under the ground at a certain
conjunction of the plants and
leave it under there for six
months and dig it up and mix it
in with a water solution and
then spray it on the ground. It's
supposed to stimulate the
micorobiotic life of the soil
which helps the plants. Really
far out, really unusual, but it
works.
"And the fifth thing was
planting by the phases of the
moon. The rationale for this
comes from seeing the moon's
effect on oceans — daily tides
of up to 40 feet in some parts of
the world. There's water in the
ground, in seeds and in plants
so it seems there might be a
small effect there.
"So those were the two
threads — the French intensive
method and Steiner's five
biodynamic techniques.
"Now, Chadwick, who is, I
think, a horticultural genius,

certainly a horticultural artist,
put these two techniques to
gether sometime between the
1930s and the 1960s when he
came to Santa Cruz. He had
been severely exasperated by
the second world war. A
woman named Freiavon Molka
and he got together and de
cided that one of the best ways
to bring peace and life and
harmony back into the world
was through gardens. Chad
wick had studied under the
French marchiers and he had
studied under Steiner. He's
had over 50 years of experience
in raising food. He also worked
under George Bernard Shaw in
drama, he's a painter, an actor,
an incredible individual — very
dramatic in his presentation of
things.
"When he put the two farm
ing techniques together, he
simplified them. Where
Steiner would make herbal
preparations, Chadwick would
just grow the herb, the stinging
nettle say, in the bed and then
put it in the compost pile and
let it have a living kind of influ
ence. Instead of using dead
mulches he used living mulch
— when the plants are so close
together that their leaves just
about touch, the ground is
shaded, moisture is con
served, a micro-climate is
created. So his whole orienta
tion is using living plants and
giving to nature as much as she
produces and even a little
more. If you give to nature
more than she gives you, she
will continually provide you
with abundance.
"So Chadwick prepares his
beds 24 inches deep, not just
18, he uses compost mainly
from vegetable matter, he uses
very little manure — in contrast
with the French and in contrast
with the other biodynamic
people who sometimes use a
lot of manure. This is important
worldwide because one-third
of the world's people now have
a different kind of energy
crisis: they don't have enough
firewood. So like in India,
they're burning the manure
from animals to heat their
homes and to cook their food.
There's a fertilizer shortage
there. But you don't need the
manure under Chadwick's
technique; most of it is veget
able compost, as I said.
"So he uses 24-inch-deep
soil preparation; close spac
ing; comparatively speaking, a
vegetarian or quasi-vegetarian
compost that's two-thirds veg
etable matter, one-third soil;
he uses living herbs rather than
herbal sprays, generally; he
uses some organic fertilizers,
mainly bone meal but not
much else; and he plants by
the phases of the moon."
/ / K| ow we started re-
searching the method
in 1972. Our purposes were
twofold. One was to document
how the method was done — it
had never been documented
in written form because Chad
wick doesn't believe in the
written word but by handing
things down by example and
by word of mouth, master to
apprentice and so forth. Also it
had been reputed that the
method produced four times
the average yield, but this had
never been documented one
way or another.
"The lot Syntex gave us had a
soil which was one-third rock
— meaning pebbles and stuff.
Normal agricultural soil is
maybe five percent rock, not 33
percent. In addition, our soil
was over one-third clay. There
was no nitrogen fertilizer in the
soil and just a trace of phos
phorous and potash.
"During our first five years
we got very encouraging re
sults — yields which ranged
anywhere from two to 16 times
the U.S., Santa Clara County or
California averages. Then in
1976, I developed a new

technique called 'superdig
ging' which is a sort of a super
texturizing technique. This
technique improves the soil
more rapidly. It takes up to five
years using normal techniques
to improve the soil. Re
member, we were in subsoil
clay with no top soil at all. As a
result of this new technique,
this year we've gone as high as
about 60 times the Santa Clara
County average with zucchini
using about two percent of the
water per pound of food pro
duced and one percent of the
added nitrogen fertilizer per
pound of food produced. In
the case of grain, we're as high
as two and a quarter times the
national average on soybeans,

double on
wheat and
expect to
go six to
eight times
for those
yields.
Also, we
expect to
be using
one third to
one-eighth
the water
per pound
of grain
produced
— and that
could be
significant
because it
means you

could be getting very high
grain yields with as little as
eight or 10 inches of rainfall.
Over 75 percent of the arable
area of the world has 10 or
more inches of rainfall.
"An interesting thing is that
the Zulus of South Africa use a
similar technique — similar to
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method, that is, that they
developed on their own. It's a
triple-digging technique, lust
before it rains they prepare the
soil three feet deep and as
soon as it does rain they plant
their grain. It doesn't rain all
summer and is very dry. They
grow grain when no one else
can grow grain anywhere. So
here's a similar technique
that's working under natural
rainfall conditions.
"What this means is that if
we reach all of our projections,
we would be getting an aver
age of four to eight times on
vegetables and six to eight
times the average yield on
grain. And these yields, by the
way are already being obtained
somewhere else in the world
on the average — and on a
large scale basis. A way to high
light this is to say that for every
major crop grown in the Un
ited States, some other country
in the world on the average is
getting a yield about twice as
high. So U.S. agriculture,
though it may look good, is not
the best with all crops."
One morning soon after our
first conversation, I met
Jeavons for a tour of the Com
mon Ground garden. He is
plainly in his element there. A
fairly large man in his mid-30s
he sports an incipient pot belly
and a voluminous though
well-behaved beard. He was
dressed in mud-spattered
work pants, a heavy flannel
shirt and a sweat-stained
leather cap. He generally main
tains a serious demeanor al
though when he smiles he re
veals a considerable capacity
for simple delight. His eyes
especially, manifest his posi
tive attitude: whether engaged
in a visual analysis of crop
progress, gazing at clouds in
the distance or glancing at his
auditor, they are intelligent,
energetic, unusually alive.
He took me first to some
thing he called an "herbal
lawn." From a distance, this
looked similar to a grass lawn
— green and flat. Standing next
to it, however, I saw that its

color was not uniform. In
terspersed among the light
green of sweet clover were
plants of darker shades —
identified by Jeavons as Roman
chamomile, creeping thyme
and dwarf yarrow. In addition
to being "simple and beauti
ful," Jeavons said, the lawn
fixes nitrogen in the soil and
concentrates phosphorous
and potash in its leaves. It is
thus beneficial to the soil on
which it is grown and can be
mown as a source of
nutriment-rich compost.
For the next hour we looked
at such things as newly-planted
fruit trees, fragrant and useful
herbs, fallow planting beds,
freshly-prepared planting

beds, planting beds overflow
ing with mature vegetables and
legumes, and recently har
vested planting beds. All the
while Jeavons kept up an in
teresting commentary filled
with odd facts and anecdotes.
"You see those nicely dug beds
over there?" he asked at one
point. "Those were prepared
by a 65-year-old woman with a
heart condition."
Finally, he led me to a
fenced-off area with a pad
locked gate. "This is the re
search garden," he said.
"What we've been looking at is
the community garden. People
from all over, including about
five to 10 percent of all the Syn
tex employees, are involved
with raising food here."
Inside the research garden
were rows of beds each about
six feet wide and 20 feet long. I
was slightly disappointed by
the modest dimensions of the
whole garden — smaller than
that occupied by the average
house — since it seemed that
something larger would be re
quired for such significant re
search.
"This area is about 2500
square feet," Jeavons said as if
reading my thoughts. "Our re
search indicates that a com
pletely balanced diet could be
grown on this much space —
and with as little as a half hour
of work a day. The same
amount of food, if it were
grown by U.S. chemical,
mechanized techniques would
take 10,000 square feet. In In
dia, the same diet would take
32,000 square feet.
"Now, the average American
eats 322 pounds of vegetables
and soft fruits — fruits like
strawberries, cantalopes and
watermelon — a year. Two
hundred and twenty of those
pounds are potatoes. You can
grow that amount of vegeta
bles with the biodynamic-
French intensive method in 100
square feet in a four to six
month growing season. In the
case of fruit trees, you can put
two of them in a hundred
square foot bed on eight foot
centers. Each of those fruit
trees should produce a
hundred pounds of hard fruit
per year and the average
American eats 162 pounds of
hard fruit a year. It should take
you maybe a half a minute to a
minute a day to take care of the
trees on an average basis and it
should take you about five to
10 minutes a day to take care of

the vegetable bed.
"So what we're talking about
is eventually people can start
raising a fair amount of their
food just in their back yard. A
family of four, in 400 square
feet, could raise in a four to six
month growing season food
worth $480 in five to 10 minutes
a day each. Their labor would
then be worth $4 to $8 an hour.
Now a person is probably not
going to do this the first year if
he's never gardened before,
but he's going to do a lot better
than he's done with other
techniques. What this means
for overseas, for India, for
example, where they have fer
tilizer shortages, energy shor
tages, water shortages and
food shortages, is that in a
small area, say 2500 to 7000
square feet they could raise
their total diet rather than in
32,000 square feet. So small is
beautiful: in this country, de
escalation of technology; for
overseas, a move to more self
sufficiency."
We moved to a bed with
some dried leaves and with
ered stalks in it which I recog
nized as potatoes, leavons
went on.
"Now in monetary terms,
with potatoes, we're now at
four times the national average
but we expect to go much
higher— maybe well above 20.
We're still experimenting with
that. I can't tell you on the re
cord how high we expect to go
but I can say on the record it's
over 20. With zucchini, when
we got only 16 times the Santa
Clara county average, the bed
produced $12.50 an hour — or
would have if we'd sold it all at
the wholesale rate. Now that
we're up to 60, we're talking
about producing three times
that or $37.50 an hour. This is
an extreme case but it should
be possible to earn a minimum
of $4 an hour just raising your
own vegetables.
"We're guessing that a new
kind of job or profession will
come out of all of this — mini
farming. We estimate that it
will be possible for one person
working a 40-hour week to
raise $15,000 net on as little as a
quarter of an acre. Currently
small farmers with farms of 200
to4oo acres are lucky if they net
several thousand dollars.
"So our philosophy is one of
low techonology, that is, simple
technology but sophisticated
theory. And I should say that
we're not a 'labor-intensive'
method as many people have
said we are. It's actually 'skill
intensive.' Bed preparation
may be the hardest job of the
method but once the soil is in
good shape and using a new
device that they've developed
in Canada, it should be possi
ble to prepare a bed in five to
10 minutes.
"All the resources that we
need to raise food right are av
ailable— we're just using them
in the wrong way. Take wheat
production, for example.
Normally to produce more
grain you have to use a lot
more fertilizer. For instance
with corn, from 1940 to 1960,
the nitrogen fertilizer use in
creased 10-fold, but the yields
only doubled. So your fertilizer
effectiveness was only one
fifth as good in 1960 as it was in
1940. Well, we cut our nitrogen
fertilizer use in one year to
one-half and the yield dou
bled. At the same time the pro
tein content increased. It went
from 14.8 percent to 15.7.
Normally when your yields go
up, your protein content per
pound of food goes down. Plus
we used less water and less
energy, less phosphorous and
less potash.
"Eventually, if we get all the
projections that we expect to
get, we'll be producing as
much food per hour as people
with machines can produce. So
this makes the individual im

portant again and gives the in
dividual a choice.
"I should stress that we've
got a ways to go yet. We don't
have a perfect system. We have
failures; we haven't reached all
our projections, but we've had
a lot of good results too.
"Right now, we think if the
method has an Achilles heel, it
will be in the net flow of or
ganic matter in and out of the
soil. We may have to face the
possibility that with the yields
we're now getting, we'll
exhaust the soil in a few more
years. The most important
thing about an agricultural
method is whether it is sustain
able in an environmentally ba
lanced way. The Chinese have
been able for hundreds of
years to grow twice as much
food as the United States does
now. And by using manual, or
ganic techniques and fertiliz
ers grown or produced on their
farms. But we may have to face
the possibility that our sustain
able yield level will be less than
our optimum yield level."
Jeavons turned away from
the potato bed and regarded
me fora moment, as if to make
sure I had understood every
thing up to that point. After tak
ing a deep breath, he turned
and pointed to a pair of
plastic-covered structures
which were, evidently,
greenhouses. One was very
similar in appearance to a con
ventional greenhouse but the
other one was only three feet
high and just covered one
hundred-square-foot bed.
"Now with these miniature
greenhouses," Jeavons said,
"a 12-month growing season is
possible in most climates
where food is grown. What this
means is you could grow your
total diet on as little as 1250
square feet working as little as
15 minutes a day." He walked
to the center of the area and
spread his arms. "That's this
much," he said, his tone imply
ing how little he thought 1250
square feet to be. I was a little
incredulous for a moment be
cause the space he indicated
really seemed no larger than
the average living room. But
then I remembered that an
acre is somewhat more than
40,000 square feet. I had no
trouble believing that the de
signated area was about a thir
tieth of an acre. "And, he said,
with a smile, "even though it's
too early to say on the record,
we expect to go much, much
lower than that to grow a total
diet."

In 1840 the German chemist
Justus von Liebig published a
paper entitled "Chemistry in
its application to agriculture
and physiology." This event,
giving birth to a whole new ap •
proach to the cultivation of
food — which I will call "chem
ical agriculture" — intruded
into the gradual evolution of
farming with all the virulence
of a malignant tumor.
It is true that relatively little
change had taken place in ag
riculture since the dawn of
civilization — 4000 years or

more if one goes back to the
Chinese farmers mentioned by
Jeavons; it is true that during
the period in which chemical
agriculture was developed in
earnest — from the 1880s to the
1920s — the world's population
was growing at a heretofore
unimaginable rate; and it is
true that many well
intentioned people saw in
chemical agriculture the only
means of putting food in the
staggering number of new and
hungry mouths.
It is also true, however, that
concurrent with the rise of
chemical agriculture were the
several great strides outlined
by Jeavons — the strides which
developed in a relatively short
time into the biodynamic-
French intensive method. As
chemical agriculture
burgeoned into an industry
and an orthodoxy, men such as
Rudolf Steiner — and he was
far from alone — recognized
the folly of abandoning
methods proven over millenia
for new and untried
techniques. On the next occa
sion on which I met with
jeavons, I asked him what he
believed were the causes for
the headlong rush toward
chemicals in the face of saner
councils.
"Well, part of the reason,"
he said, "was that as chemical
fertilizers came into play, trac
tors were being developed and
brought into use on many
farms. This made it possible to
spread chemical fertilizer very
easily. It was less time
consuming than spreading
manures. Also, with the tractor
you were able to farm large
areas. Even though it wasn't in
tensive, you could farm a large
area and produce a lot of food
in a very short time. The prom
ise of opening up increased ac
reage was very seductive. To
most people, two to four times
the area meant two to four
times the food. On the other
hand, the French intensive cul
ture that was developed out
side Paris required an awful lot
of people per acre. So with
everyone getting caught up in
the petrochemical
mechanized revolution, the
tendency was to equate 'faster'
with 'more and better.' Which
for a short time was probably
true. But if we get into today's
period, the petrochemicals are
getting more expensive so
spending more time and labor
to get the same amount of food
isn't as unappealing as it used
to be. But more important, I

believe,
from the
perspective
of our re
search, is
that we be
lieve we're
going to be
able to
produce as
much food
per hour as
a machine
can — by
hand. The
way that
we're going
to be able
to do this is
by thinking
about

what's been done in the past,
about what's being done cur
rently, and maximizing the
simplicity which produces the
time efficiency."
During the course of the last
half century, many of the
spokesmen for non-chemical
agriculture have found them
selves ostracized for their be
liefs and techniques. At best
they have been ignored by the
academic and political estab
lishment, at worst they have
been actively harassed and
obstructed in presenting their
cases before the public. One of


these men, Sir Albert Howard,
an Imperial Botanist for the In
dian government, "did some
fantastic things," according to
Jeavons. "Everyone had told
him he couldn't grow cotton
organically in India because
the pests would eat it up. It
took him a while but at the end
of five years, he was growing
cotton organically — with no
pesticides. He had less crop
loss than the people who were
using pesticides."
Although knighted for this
and other accomplishments,
Howard received so much pub
lic ridicule — both from fer-

tilizer in
dustry
spokesmen
and his fel
low scien
tists — that
his ideas
went
widely un
heeded.
Howard
wrote, after

addressing one particularly
nonreceptive audience of
botanists, "Here again I was
amazed by the limited know
ledge and experience of the
world's agriculturalists dis
closed by this debate. I felt I
was dealing with beginners
and that some of the argu
ments put forward could al
most be described as the im
pertinences of ignorance."
In this country, the case of
|.l. Rodale, whose publications
are among the standard refer
ences for a large segment of
the organic farming popula
tion, is not unusual. Rodale
was forced to spend almost a
quarter of a million dollars in
legal fees to win a court deci
sion over the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission which had
blocked the publication of his
book "The Health Finder."
I asked )eavons whether he
thought these examples indi
cated the presence of an estab
lishment which had a vested in
terest in the development and
maintenance of chemical ag
riculture irrespective of the
best interests of mankind. It
was true, he said, that
"businessmen are always
ready to take advantage of a
good thing and push it to the
fullest," but there were proba
bly "two separate thrusts" —
business incentives and desire
for greater efficiency — which
"then became merged."
leavons then related an in
teresting anecdote, most of
which had to remain off the re
cord, which was a telling
statement about the present
state of agricultural research.
"It was amazing to me," he
said, "that agricultural schools
are not more interested in re
search like that (Howard's),
and in trying to replicate it — at
least as an alternative ap
proach. I wrote a letter to an
individual who was involved in
agricultural research at a col
lege here in California. I told
him I was confused. In the light
of some of the possibilities we
were uncovering with the
biodynamic-French intensive
method, why wasn't anyone
investigating our results. He
wrote me back a very good let
ter. He indicated that the re
search money is coming from
thechemical industriesand the
agricultural interests. They
have an interest in using the
system they've already got.
And again, their purpose is
making money from it, not
necessarily making it better. So
you see, the professors almost
have to ridicule alternative
methods. If they go into other
areas, they become profes
sionally ostracized and they
can't get funds."
leavons continued with
another anecdote, this time
regarding a conference about
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method which was held

last year in Santa Barbara. Sev
eral members of the American
Society of Agronomy had at
tended, he said, and had asked
questions about the
mechanisms of the improved
plant growth. "If we couldn't
tell them exactly how it was
happening, in their terms and
language, they wouldn't give it
very much credence. Someone
pointed out that the Romans
knew how to make concrete a
long time before anyone knew
why it worked. There's a kind
of scientific myopia here. It's
like they're saying, you can
only be scientific if you're sci
entific in the way in which we
are scientific. Well, good lord,
if someone's demonstrating
that something is possible,
anyone who's really an open
minded scientist ought to be
excited and interested to find
out why it's possible. But there
aren't any funds for them to do
it."
leavons is not alone in his
observation of "scientific
myopia" in the present
academic community. In April,
1973, Nicholas Wade reported
in Science magazine that "a
blue-ribbon committee of
basic and agricultural scien
tists" found that "the basic re
search performed by federal
and state agricultural research
organizations is of meager
quality, suffers from a 'shock
ing lack of intellectual leader
ship' and is guided by policies
detrimental to the interests of
agriculture."
Although no reference was
made to a lack of attention to
any specific area of research,
University of Chicago Biology
Prof. Richard Levins wrote in a
later issue of Science that "the
issues raised by Nicholas
Wade's report have to be set
into a broader context than
simply the policies of the U.S.
Department of Agricul
ture. . . . Within agricultural
science, America's traditional
anti-intellectualism survives as
an antitheoretical bias. . . .It is
reinforced by the search for
marketable products (mostly
chemical) as the central
strategy for improvement of
agriculture . . . and by a nar
row acceptance of the present
structure of agriculture as a
given condition which restricts
options. For example, the con
sideration of mixed plantings is
inhibited by the present design
of farm machinery."
The tone of both articles asks
the question, "Ought we to let
this happen?" The tone taken
increasingly by more and more
far-sighted scientists today,
however, is "Can we afford to
let this happen?" jeavons him
self points to the dwindling
supply of natural gas — the
current reserves of which are
slated to run out in about a de
cade — as one factor which
could lead to an agricultural
disaster. Since the production
of artificial nitrogen fertilizer
has been made almost wholly
dependent on natural gas, he
says, and since there is evi-

dence indi
cating that
nitrogen fi
xation from
the air by
soil bac
teria stops
in the pre
sence of ar
tificial fer
tilizer
which in

turn causes a soil "addiction"
to this form of fertilizer, it
seems likely that we will be
faced with the necessity of
using pollution-producing coal
to satisfy our farmlands'
"habit." And even the coal
supply will someday be
exhausted.
Yet even if the scarcity of
energy were not an issue, the
question would still be a valid
one. In addition to beini:


ecologically unsound, our pre
sent system of food production
is economically and technolog
ically unsatisfactory for a large
segment of the world's popula
tion. As Frances Moore Lappe
and ]oseph Collins de
monstrate in their book, Food
First, the expensive technology
and inflated prices which "ag
ribusiness" and its "global
supermarket" force on unde
veloped nations do as much to
hinder their progress as any
other single factor.
Jeavons' belief is that the
solution to many of the world's
food-related problems —
ecological, economical and
technological — lies in a global
move to small-scale farming. A
February, 1976 paper released
by Ecology Action states that
"the current food shortages
will worsen into a crisis of
global proportions unless the
productivity of the 100 million
small farms in the developing
world is increased dramati
cally. Several key points make
the biodynamic-Fiench inten
sive method especially viable
in countries with limited re
sources: The method does not
require complicated machin
ery or expensive fertilizers.
The key technological element
is the common shovel. The
method uses 1/2 to 1/16 the wa
ter. This will be especially valu
able in arid areas of the world,
or those limited to natural rain
fall. The method provides a
self-sufficient livelihood in
areas of high unemployment.
The method's diversified ap
proach encourages intercrop
ping with local foods, thus of
fering a varied diet. The
method builds a healthy soil,
the key to dependable food
production and the building of
a stable economic and social
system."
And, according to a paper
co-authored by leavons, "The
small farm, all factors consi
dered, is actually a more effi
cient unit of production than
its large-scale counterpart. To
quote Sterling Wortman of the
Rockerfeller Foundation, . .
most large-scale mechanized
agriculture is less productive
per unit area than small scale
farming can be. The farmer on
a small holding can engage in
intensive high yield gardening,
systems such as intercropping,
multiple cropping, relay plant
ing or other techniques that
require attention to individual
plants. The point is that
mechanized agriculture is very
productive in terms of output
per man-year, but it is not as
productive per unit of land as
the highly intensive systems
are.' Much of the economic
advantage large farms now
enjoy is not due to any stream
lining inherent in their size but
in the tax structures and sub
sidies which favor corporate
'tax loss' farming, land specula
tion, and vertical stratification
of the food industry from pro
duction of fertilizers, to farm
ing, to packaging and distribu
tion of food products."
Jeavons is generally unop
timistic

about the
prospects
for a rapid
change
from our
current ag
ricultural
practices,
projecting
50years as a
minimum

before such a transformation
will be started on a large scale.
"The thing that has always con
fused me," he told me, "is why
so few people have asked why
can't we keep the organic,
small-scale simplicity and also
have the sophistication of
modern science. I think one
reason why people don't get
into that too much is because
they're thinking on a closed

system basis — and it gets away
from a growth economy.
There's no audience for this in
this country, very few people
living that kind of lifestyle.
They're not putting their
energy into making it happen.
They're still chasing the growth
economy that is epitomized by
the development of the tractor
and the chemical fertilizers."
Lemmings have at least one
thing to recommend them
over mankind — at least when
they rush to their destruction,
•they do not drag the rest of the
planet with them. But mankind
has at least one thing to re
commend it over lemmings: at
least as it rushes to its destruc
tion, it can see where it is going
and attempt to stop before it is

too late.
It often
seems,
however,
that rather
than at
tempting to
stop our
sprint to
ward an
nihilation,

one part of
our species is actively engaged
in accelerating our progress
while the other part fiddles
marching tunes like a whole
race of carefree Neros. We find
our leaders more concerned
with their own destinies than
those of the people they are
supposed to lead; we find, in
fact, that they seem to have no
awareness of any destiny other
than their own. We find them
structuring our culture for
their own ends, without regard
for any future more distant
than the probable span of their
lives. We find an educational
system which perpetuates
their narrow-sightedness. We
at the summit of our culture
find ourselves in the midst of a
highly-sophisticated,
apparently-benign process
which teaches us to shut our
eyes and go faster.
But then it can not be de
nied: the power of vision has
not left us entirely; there are
those who do stretch their
necks to look around. It is no
doubt painful and traumatic to
take a long look at the destruc
tion which we are cultivating.
But there are, these people tell
us, other views, views as prom
ising as the scene immediately
before us is threatening. And,
hope being what it is, they are
working to divert our rush.
)eavons, obviously, is such a
man. He is not militant, anar
chistic, alienated, alienating or
bitter. As he says, "you don't
really need to change the sys
tem to live a better life."
leavons is just quietly pursuing
his work, doing what he can to
bring about an improvement in
the attitude of our culture.

Grow More Vegetables Than
You Ever Thought Possible
On Less Land Than You Can

The headquarters of the Syn
tex Corporation is located
on a hillside just west of Footh
ill Expressway, across from
Palo Alto's Veterans Administ
ration Hospital. A large cement
and glass building in the mod
ern architectural style, it sits on
a very green and well-groomed
lawn. At the foot of the hill,
however, literally a stone's
throw away from the
chemical-pharmaceuticals bas
tion, an incongruous sight pre
sents itself: a truck garden, in
the best tradition of truck gar
dens. It is a disorderly collage
of colors and textures — the
lush green of crops and weeds,
the crumbling dark brown of
newly turned earth, the dry
light brown of withered vege
tation, the dusty white sheen
of sheet plastic, the hard lustre
less gray of metal siding.

A casual passerby, observing
the two establishments, would
be likely to see in their proxim
ity the tension which often
exists between the new and
dynamic and the old and static.
Palo Aito, he might surmise, is
in the final stages of a
metamorphosis from the pas
toral to the cosmopolitan; the
garden, a quaint anachronism,
will soon be the site of yet
another corporate headquar
ters and the cement and glass
building on the hillside will ac
quire, by comparison, an air of
establishment and seniority.

Such is not the case, how
ever. Quite to the contrary, the
cement and glass building
antedates the garden; the land
on which the garden is located
is owned by the corporation
and worked by the garden's
proprietors under the terms of
a rent-free lease; the operation
of the garden is partially sub
sidized, with virtually no return
obligations, by the corpora
tion's donation, in addition to
the land, of water and funds. It
is an unusual situation, but it is
an unusual truck garden.
Foods ranging from grains to
fruit to beans to vegetables are
under cultivation there. The
yield of any given foodstuff at
any given harvest time typically
ranges from two to 31 times the
national, California or Santa
Clara County average
(whichever is higher). From
one-half to one-sixteenth the
average amount of water per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. From one-half to
one-sixteenth the average
amount of nitrogen fertilizer
per pound of food produced is
typically used. About one
one-hundredth the energy per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. No "chemical" fer
tilizer is used. Mo pesticides of
any type are used. No machin
ery more sophisticated than a
simple wheelbarrow is used.
And it is not uncommon to see
men and women in business
dress entering or leaving the
garden or engaged in some
phase of agriculture.
Despite these arresting facts,
the garden and its proprietors
remain surprisingly anonym
ous. Perhaps it is the
previously-described undis
tinguished character of the
former, or maybe it is the
quiet, unassuming style of the
latter. It may even be that it has
less to do with either the
former or latter than the nature
of the rest of the world. What
ever the case, it would be a
poor bet indeed to wager that
that anonymity is to be pre
served for very much longer.
Although I have been in
terested in food in general
and gardening in specific for
much of my life, the terms
"biodynamic" and "French in
tensive" remained obscure to
me until I made the acquain
tance of John leavons. An
alumnus of Yale and former
head of Business Services for
the Stanford library system,
leavons currently wields the

ponderous title of Director of
Agricultural Research for Ecol
ogy Action of the Midpenin
sula.
It is largely Jeavons who is
responsible for the present
shape — in both a physLal and
an abstract sense — of the ag
ricultural program underway
on the three and three-quarter
acre plot of Syntex land. It was
Jeavons who, after making a
study on his own initiative of
United Nations iand use and

population
figures, be
came con
vinced that
the planet
was still
capable of
feeding all
her in
habitants;
it was he
who, after
attending a
seminar on
the agricul
tural
techniques

synthesized by the Englishman
Alan Chadwick, sought out the
master horticulturalist in his
barren hillside-turned Garden
of Eden at the University of
California at Santa Cruz; it was
Jeavons who, after talking at
length with Chadwick, prop
osed the idea of a combined
research and community gar
den to the board of directors of
Ecology Action, a Palo Alto
conservation group which had
won recognition for a success
ful city-wide recycling prog-

ram; it was he who, after con
vincing them of the viability
and significance of such a
program, proceeded to as
semble the elements of Com
mon Ground — land, funds,
people — and embark on a
course of rigorous scientific
research.
The program is now in its
sixth year. Each succeeding
year has, according to Jeavons,
confirmed his faith in Chad
wick's techniques, known now
as the biodynamic-French in
tensive method.
When I first spoke with
leavons, I had a vague recollec
tion of a chapter in a gardening
book which had described a
"labor-intensive" system of
farming which allowed the
densely-populated countries
of western Europe to grow
much food on little land. This, I
imagined, was related to
"French-intensive" farming. In
his articulate and methodical
way, Jeavons soon clarified and
expanded this conception —
and made me realize how large
a topic this form of agriculture
had become.
"The method we're using
now," he said, "is made up of
two techniques that were de
veloped in Europe around the
turn of the century. The French
intensive method is one—that
reached its culmination in the
1890s outside Paris. What it did
was it raised vegetables in beds
that consisted of 18 inches of
horse manure — which was re
ally plentiful at the time. Be
cause of this high level of or
ganic matter and the fertility it
created, as well as the great
depth of loose material, roots
were able to grow downward
instead of needing room to
grow out horizontally. So they
were able to use very close
spacing."
This simple concept, leavons
continued, accounts for a sig
nificant part of the increased
yields which the method pro
duces. As jeavons phrased it in
a research report summarizing
Common Ground's first four
years, "A simple 24-inch deep
soil preparation allows the

plants to be spaced more
closely so that their leaves
touch or almost touch. . . .
This factor alone would make
fourfold yields possible be
cause four times as many
plants as usual can be planted
in a given area."
"The other technique,"
Jeavons told me, "was the
biodynamic technique. It was
developed in the 1920s by
Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian
genius who was into educa
tion, philosophy, religion, and
agriculture. The French inten
sive method had been de
veloped over hundreds of
years by French marchiers or
gardeners. The biodynamic
method, though, was de
veloped by Steiner in the late
'20s fora lot of wealthy German
farmers who had noticed that
their yields were going down
and they were getting more in
sect and disease problems. It
turned out they had been using
chemical fertilizers. Urea, a
kind of artifical nitrogen, had
been developed in the late
1880s. Steiner traced their
problems to the chemical fer
tilizers and suggested that they
return to some of their old
methods and adopt five special
practices. These practices be
camethe biodynamic method.
"One was the use of raised
beds — beds only 12 inches
deep prepared by raking soil
out of the path. This was going
back to the Greeks who found
out that plants grew better in
landslides. The raised beds as
they came to be dug were like
little, artificial landslides. The
reasons the plants do better in
them is because the soil is
looser and there's more air or
gases in it — you need up to 50
percent gases for good plant
growth."
jeavons frequently uses the
verb "dovetail" to describe
areas where two concepts in
termesh or compliment each
other. The deep soil prepara
tion and close spacing of the
French intensive method
dovetails, he said, with the "ar
tificial landslides" of the
biodynamic method to pro

duce healthier, more produc
tive plants.
"There was a study in the '50s
at the University of California
at Berkeley," he said, "that
showed that if you improved
root health by two to four per
cent for most common field
crops you could increase the
yields by 200 to 400 percent.
One of the things which can
make this possible is better soil
preparation and aeration. With
our method, you have more air
in the soil, more surface area
for contact between soil and air
since a raised bed has a curved
surface and also more surface
area to absorb rain or watering
and warmth from the sun. And
the curved surface also allows
you to increase the planting
area by 20 percent. Say you
have a plot of land that's a
hundred square feet and you
make it a raised bed, you can
wind up with 120 square feet of
planting area.
"The second technique that
Steiner recommended, after
the raised beds — which inci
dentally may even have gone
back even before the Greeks to
the Chinese, possibly 4000
years ago — was the use of or
ganic fertilizers. Chemical fer
tilizers at the time were mainly
just nitrogen or nitrogen and
phosphorous. They weren't
balanced or complete; they
needed trace minerals and
potash. Also the chemical fer
tilizers broke down very
quickly and harmed the texture
and structure of the soil and
killed the microbiotic life and

so forth. So Steiner asked the
German farmers to return to
organic fertilizers that were
more balanced and diverse —
like fish meal which has nitro
gen, phosphorous and trace
mi nerals and breaks down over
a period of six months instead
of four to six weeks.
"The third technique was
companion planting. There
were a lot of folk myths about
what things to grow well to
gether. Steiner tried to scienti
fically investigate this through
such techniques as
chromatography and crystalli
zation and field testing to de
termine which plants grown
together would do better. For
instance, one part chamomile
grown with two hundred parts
of wheat increases the health
and yield of wheat. But if its
one to one, one part
chamomile grown with one
part wheat, the wheat will be
destroyed, or at least seriously
harmed.
"Another technique was the
use of herbal sprays. At one
point they were almost a cult.
You take stinging nettles, for
example, and you do some
thing like — I can't remember
exactly — bury it three feet
under the ground at a certain
conjunction of the plants and
leave it under there for six
months and dig it up and mix it
in with a water solution and
then spray it on the ground. It's
supposed to stimulate the
micorobiotic life of the soil
which helps the plants. Really
far out, really unusual, but it
works.
"And the fifth thing was
planting by the phases of the
moon. The rationale for this
comes from seeing the moon's
effect on oceans — daily tides
of up to 40 feet in some parts of
the world. There's water in the
ground, in seeds and in plants
so it seems there might be a
small effect there.
"So those were the two
threads — the French intensive
method and Steiner's five
biodynamic techniques.
"Now, Chadwick, who is, I
think, a horticultural genius,

certainly a horticultural artist,
put these two techniques to
gether sometime between the
1930s and the 1960s when he
came to Santa Cruz. He had
been severely exasperated by
the second world war. A
woman named Freiavon Molka
and he got together and de
cided that one of the best ways
to bring peace and life and
harmony back into the world
was through gardens. Chad
wick had studied under the
French marchiers and he had
studied under Steiner. He's
had over 50 years of experience
in raising food. He also worked
under George Bernard Shaw in
drama, he's a painter, an actor,
an incredible individual — very
dramatic in his presentation of
things.
"When he put the two farm
ing techniques together, he
simplified them. Where
Steiner would make herbal
preparations, Chadwick would
just grow the herb, the stinging
nettle say, in the bed and then
put it in the compost pile and
let it have a living kind of influ
ence. Instead of using dead
mulches he used living mulch
— when the plants are so close
together that their leaves just
about touch, the ground is
shaded, moisture is con
served, a micro-climate is
created. So his whole orienta
tion is using living plants and
giving to nature as much as she
produces and even a little
more. If you give to nature
more than she gives you, she
will continually provide you
with abundance.
"So Chadwick prepares his
beds 24 inches deep, not just
18, he uses compost mainly
from vegetable matter, he uses
very little manure — in contrast
with the French and in contrast
with the other biodynamic
people who sometimes use a
lot of manure. This is important
worldwide because one-third
of the world's people now have
a different kind of energy
crisis: they don't have enough
firewood. So like in India,
they're burning the manure
from animals to heat their
homes and to cook their food.
There's a fertilizer shortage
there. But you don't need the
manure under Chadwick's
technique; most of it is veget
able compost, as I said.
"So he uses 24-inch-deep
soil preparation; close spac
ing; comparatively speaking, a
vegetarian or quasi-vegetarian
compost that's two-thirds veg
etable matter, one-third soil;
he uses living herbs rather than
herbal sprays, generally; he
uses some organic fertilizers,
mainly bone meal but not
much else; and he plants by
the phases of the moon."
/ / K| ow we started re-
searching the method
in 1972. Our purposes were
twofold. One was to document
how the method was done — it
had never been documented
in written form because Chad
wick doesn't believe in the
written word but by handing
things down by example and
by word of mouth, master to
apprentice and so forth. Also it
had been reputed that the
method produced four times
the average yield, but this had
never been documented one
way or another.
"The lot Syntex gave us had a
soil which was one-third rock
— meaning pebbles and stuff.
Normal agricultural soil is
maybe five percent rock, not 33
percent. In addition, our soil
was over one-third clay. There
was no nitrogen fertilizer in the
soil and just a trace of phos
phorous and potash.
"During our first five years
we got very encouraging re
sults — yields which ranged
anywhere from two to 16 times
the U.S., Santa Clara County or
California averages. Then in
1976, I developed a new

technique called 'superdig
ging' which is a sort of a super
texturizing technique. This
technique improves the soil
more rapidly. It takes up to five
years using normal techniques
to improve the soil. Re
member, we were in subsoil
clay with no top soil at all. As a
result of this new technique,
this year we've gone as high as
about 60 times the Santa Clara
County average with zucchini
using about two percent of the
water per pound of food pro
duced and one percent of the
added nitrogen fertilizer per
pound of food produced. In
the case of grain, we're as high
as two and a quarter times the
national average on soybeans,

double on
wheat and
expect to
go six to
eight times
for those
yields.
Also, we
expect to
be using
one third to
one-eighth
the water
per pound
of grain
produced
— and that
could be
significant
because it
means you

could be getting very high
grain yields with as little as
eight or 10 inches of rainfall.
Over 75 percent of the arable
area of the world has 10 or
more inches of rainfall.
"An interesting thing is that
the Zulus of South Africa use a
similar technique — similar to
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method, that is, that they
developed on their own. It's a
triple-digging technique, lust
before it rains they prepare the
soil three feet deep and as
soon as it does rain they plant
their grain. It doesn't rain all
summer and is very dry. They
grow grain when no one else
can grow grain anywhere. So
here's a similar technique
that's working under natural
rainfall conditions.
"What this means is that if
we reach all of our projections,
we would be getting an aver
age of four to eight times on
vegetables and six to eight
times the average yield on
grain. And these yields, by the
way are already being obtained
somewhere else in the world
on the average — and on a
large scale basis. A way to high
light this is to say that for every
major crop grown in the Un
ited States, some other country
in the world on the average is
getting a yield about twice as
high. So U.S. agriculture,
though it may look good, is not
the best with all crops."
One morning soon after our
first conversation, I met
Jeavons for a tour of the Com
mon Ground garden. He is
plainly in his element there. A
fairly large man in his mid-30s
he sports an incipient pot belly
and a voluminous though
well-behaved beard. He was
dressed in mud-spattered
work pants, a heavy flannel
shirt and a sweat-stained
leather cap. He generally main
tains a serious demeanor al
though when he smiles he re
veals a considerable capacity
for simple delight. His eyes
especially, manifest his posi
tive attitude: whether engaged
in a visual analysis of crop
progress, gazing at clouds in
the distance or glancing at his
auditor, they are intelligent,
energetic, unusually alive.
He took me first to some
thing he called an "herbal
lawn." From a distance, this
looked similar to a grass lawn
— green and flat. Standing next
to it, however, I saw that its

color was not uniform. In
terspersed among the light
green of sweet clover were
plants of darker shades —
identified by Jeavons as Roman
chamomile, creeping thyme
and dwarf yarrow. In addition
to being "simple and beauti
ful," Jeavons said, the lawn
fixes nitrogen in the soil and
concentrates phosphorous
and potash in its leaves. It is
thus beneficial to the soil on
which it is grown and can be
mown as a source of
nutriment-rich compost.
For the next hour we looked
at such things as newly-planted
fruit trees, fragrant and useful
herbs, fallow planting beds,
freshly-prepared planting

beds, planting beds overflow
ing with mature vegetables and
legumes, and recently har
vested planting beds. All the
while Jeavons kept up an in
teresting commentary filled
with odd facts and anecdotes.
"You see those nicely dug beds
over there?" he asked at one
point. "Those were prepared
by a 65-year-old woman with a
heart condition."
Finally, he led me to a
fenced-off area with a pad
locked gate. "This is the re
search garden," he said.
"What we've been looking at is
the community garden. People
from all over, including about
five to 10 percent of all the Syn
tex employees, are involved
with raising food here."
Inside the research garden
were rows of beds each about
six feet wide and 20 feet long. I
was slightly disappointed by
the modest dimensions of the
whole garden — smaller than
that occupied by the average
house — since it seemed that
something larger would be re
quired for such significant re
search.
"This area is about 2500
square feet," Jeavons said as if
reading my thoughts. "Our re
search indicates that a com
pletely balanced diet could be
grown on this much space —
and with as little as a half hour
of work a day. The same
amount of food, if it were
grown by U.S. chemical,
mechanized techniques would
take 10,000 square feet. In In
dia, the same diet would take
32,000 square feet.
"Now, the average American
eats 322 pounds of vegetables
and soft fruits — fruits like
strawberries, cantalopes and
watermelon — a year. Two
hundred and twenty of those
pounds are potatoes. You can
grow that amount of vegeta
bles with the biodynamic-
French intensive method in 100
square feet in a four to six
month growing season. In the
case of fruit trees, you can put
two of them in a hundred
square foot bed on eight foot
centers. Each of those fruit
trees should produce a
hundred pounds of hard fruit
per year and the average
American eats 162 pounds of
hard fruit a year. It should take
you maybe a half a minute to a
minute a day to take care of the
trees on an average basis and it
should take you about five to
10 minutes a day to take care of

the vegetable bed.
"So what we're talking about
is eventually people can start
raising a fair amount of their
food just in their back yard. A
family of four, in 400 square
feet, could raise in a four to six
month growing season food
worth $480 in five to 10 minutes
a day each. Their labor would
then be worth $4 to $8 an hour.
Now a person is probably not
going to do this the first year if
he's never gardened before,
but he's going to do a lot better
than he's done with other
techniques. What this means
for overseas, for India, for
example, where they have fer
tilizer shortages, energy shor
tages, water shortages and
food shortages, is that in a
small area, say 2500 to 7000
square feet they could raise
their total diet rather than in
32,000 square feet. So small is
beautiful: in this country, de
escalation of technology; for
overseas, a move to more self
sufficiency."
We moved to a bed with
some dried leaves and with
ered stalks in it which I recog
nized as potatoes, leavons
went on.
"Now in monetary terms,
with potatoes, we're now at
four times the national average
but we expect to go much
higher— maybe well above 20.
We're still experimenting with
that. I can't tell you on the re
cord how high we expect to go
but I can say on the record it's
over 20. With zucchini, when
we got only 16 times the Santa
Clara county average, the bed
produced $12.50 an hour — or
would have if we'd sold it all at
the wholesale rate. Now that
we're up to 60, we're talking
about producing three times
that or $37.50 an hour. This is
an extreme case but it should
be possible to earn a minimum
of $4 an hour just raising your
own vegetables.
"We're guessing that a new
kind of job or profession will
come out of all of this — mini
farming. We estimate that it
will be possible for one person
working a 40-hour week to
raise $15,000 net on as little as a
quarter of an acre. Currently
small farmers with farms of 200
to4oo acres are lucky if they net
several thousand dollars.
"So our philosophy is one of
low techonology, that is, simple
technology but sophisticated
theory. And I should say that
we're not a 'labor-intensive'
method as many people have
said we are. It's actually 'skill
intensive.' Bed preparation
may be the hardest job of the
method but once the soil is in
good shape and using a new
device that they've developed
in Canada, it should be possi
ble to prepare a bed in five to
10 minutes.
"All the resources that we
need to raise food right are av
ailable— we're just using them
in the wrong way. Take wheat
production, for example.
Normally to produce more
grain you have to use a lot
more fertilizer. For instance
with corn, from 1940 to 1960,
the nitrogen fertilizer use in
creased 10-fold, but the yields
only doubled. So your fertilizer
effectiveness was only one
fifth as good in 1960 as it was in
1940. Well, we cut our nitrogen
fertilizer use in one year to
one-half and the yield dou
bled. At the same time the pro
tein content increased. It went
from 14.8 percent to 15.7.
Normally when your yields go
up, your protein content per
pound of food goes down. Plus
we used less water and less
energy, less phosphorous and
less potash.
"Eventually, if we get all the
projections that we expect to
get, we'll be producing as
much food per hour as people
with machines can produce. So
this makes the individual im

portant again and gives the in
dividual a choice.
"I should stress that we've
got a ways to go yet. We don't
have a perfect system. We have
failures; we haven't reached all
our projections, but we've had
a lot of good results too.
"Right now, we think if the
method has an Achilles heel, it
will be in the net flow of or
ganic matter in and out of the
soil. We may have to face the
possibility that with the yields
we're now getting, we'll
exhaust the soil in a few more
years. The most important
thing about an agricultural
method is whether it is sustain
able in an environmentally ba
lanced way. The Chinese have
been able for hundreds of
years to grow twice as much
food as the United States does
now. And by using manual, or
ganic techniques and fertiliz
ers grown or produced on their
farms. But we may have to face
the possibility that our sustain
able yield level will be less than
our optimum yield level."
Jeavons turned away from
the potato bed and regarded
me fora moment, as if to make
sure I had understood every
thing up to that point. After tak
ing a deep breath, he turned
and pointed to a pair of
plastic-covered structures
which were, evidently,
greenhouses. One was very
similar in appearance to a con
ventional greenhouse but the
other one was only three feet
high and just covered one
hundred-square-foot bed.
"Now with these miniature
greenhouses," Jeavons said,
"a 12-month growing season is
possible in most climates
where food is grown. What this
means is you could grow your
total diet on as little as 1250
square feet working as little as
15 minutes a day." He walked
to the center of the area and
spread his arms. "That's this
much," he said, his tone imply
ing how little he thought 1250
square feet to be. I was a little
incredulous for a moment be
cause the space he indicated
really seemed no larger than
the average living room. But
then I remembered that an
acre is somewhat more than
40,000 square feet. I had no
trouble believing that the de
signated area was about a thir
tieth of an acre. "And, he said,
with a smile, "even though it's
too early to say on the record,
we expect to go much, much
lower than that to grow a total
diet."

In 1840 the German chemist
Justus von Liebig published a
paper entitled "Chemistry in
its application to agriculture
and physiology." This event,
giving birth to a whole new ap •
proach to the cultivation of
food — which I will call "chem
ical agriculture" — intruded
into the gradual evolution of
farming with all the virulence
of a malignant tumor.
It is true that relatively little
change had taken place in ag
riculture since the dawn of
civilization — 4000 years or

more if one goes back to the
Chinese farmers mentioned by
Jeavons; it is true that during
the period in which chemical
agriculture was developed in
earnest — from the 1880s to the
1920s — the world's population
was growing at a heretofore
unimaginable rate; and it is
true that many well
intentioned people saw in
chemical agriculture the only
means of putting food in the
staggering number of new and
hungry mouths.
It is also true, however, that
concurrent with the rise of
chemical agriculture were the
several great strides outlined
by Jeavons — the strides which
developed in a relatively short
time into the biodynamic-
French intensive method. As
chemical agriculture
burgeoned into an industry
and an orthodoxy, men such as
Rudolf Steiner — and he was
far from alone — recognized
the folly of abandoning
methods proven over millenia
for new and untried
techniques. On the next occa
sion on which I met with
jeavons, I asked him what he
believed were the causes for
the headlong rush toward
chemicals in the face of saner
councils.
"Well, part of the reason,"
he said, "was that as chemical
fertilizers came into play, trac
tors were being developed and
brought into use on many
farms. This made it possible to
spread chemical fertilizer very
easily. It was less time
consuming than spreading
manures. Also, with the tractor
you were able to farm large
areas. Even though it wasn't in
tensive, you could farm a large
area and produce a lot of food
in a very short time. The prom
ise of opening up increased ac
reage was very seductive. To
most people, two to four times
the area meant two to four
times the food. On the other
hand, the French intensive cul
ture that was developed out
side Paris required an awful lot
of people per acre. So with
everyone getting caught up in
the petrochemical
mechanized revolution, the
tendency was to equate 'faster'
with 'more and better.' Which
for a short time was probably
true. But if we get into today's
period, the petrochemicals are
getting more expensive so
spending more time and labor
to get the same amount of food
isn't as unappealing as it used
to be. But more important, I

believe,
from the
perspective
of our re
search, is
that we be
lieve we're
going to be
able to
produce as
much food
per hour as
a machine
can — by
hand. The
way that
we're going
to be able
to do this is
by thinking
about

what's been done in the past,
about what's being done cur
rently, and maximizing the
simplicity which produces the
time efficiency."
During the course of the last
half century, many of the
spokesmen for non-chemical
agriculture have found them
selves ostracized for their be
liefs and techniques. At best
they have been ignored by the
academic and political estab
lishment, at worst they have
been actively harassed and
obstructed in presenting their
cases before the public. One of


these men, Sir Albert Howard,
an Imperial Botanist for the In
dian government, "did some
fantastic things," according to
Jeavons. "Everyone had told
him he couldn't grow cotton
organically in India because
the pests would eat it up. It
took him a while but at the end
of five years, he was growing
cotton organically — with no
pesticides. He had less crop
loss than the people who were
using pesticides."
Although knighted for this
and other accomplishments,
Howard received so much pub
lic ridicule — both from fer-

tilizer in
dustry
spokesmen
and his fel
low scien
tists — that
his ideas
went
widely un
heeded.
Howard
wrote, after

addressing one particularly
nonreceptive audience of
botanists, "Here again I was
amazed by the limited know
ledge and experience of the
world's agriculturalists dis
closed by this debate. I felt I
was dealing with beginners
and that some of the argu
ments put forward could al
most be described as the im
pertinences of ignorance."
In this country, the case of
|.l. Rodale, whose publications
are among the standard refer
ences for a large segment of
the organic farming popula
tion, is not unusual. Rodale
was forced to spend almost a
quarter of a million dollars in
legal fees to win a court deci
sion over the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission which had
blocked the publication of his
book "The Health Finder."
I asked )eavons whether he
thought these examples indi
cated the presence of an estab
lishment which had a vested in
terest in the development and
maintenance of chemical ag
riculture irrespective of the
best interests of mankind. It
was true, he said, that
"businessmen are always
ready to take advantage of a
good thing and push it to the
fullest," but there were proba
bly "two separate thrusts" —
business incentives and desire
for greater efficiency — which
"then became merged."
leavons then related an in
teresting anecdote, most of
which had to remain off the re
cord, which was a telling
statement about the present
state of agricultural research.
"It was amazing to me," he
said, "that agricultural schools
are not more interested in re
search like that (Howard's),
and in trying to replicate it — at
least as an alternative ap
proach. I wrote a letter to an
individual who was involved in
agricultural research at a col
lege here in California. I told
him I was confused. In the light
of some of the possibilities we
were uncovering with the
biodynamic-French intensive
method, why wasn't anyone
investigating our results. He
wrote me back a very good let
ter. He indicated that the re
search money is coming from
thechemical industriesand the
agricultural interests. They
have an interest in using the
system they've already got.
And again, their purpose is
making money from it, not
necessarily making it better. So
you see, the professors almost
have to ridicule alternative
methods. If they go into other
areas, they become profes
sionally ostracized and they
can't get funds."
leavons continued with
another anecdote, this time
regarding a conference about
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method which was held

last year in Santa Barbara. Sev
eral members of the American
Society of Agronomy had at
tended, he said, and had asked
questions about the
mechanisms of the improved
plant growth. "If we couldn't
tell them exactly how it was
happening, in their terms and
language, they wouldn't give it
very much credence. Someone
pointed out that the Romans
knew how to make concrete a
long time before anyone knew
why it worked. There's a kind
of scientific myopia here. It's
like they're saying, you can
only be scientific if you're sci
entific in the way in which we
are scientific. Well, good lord,
if someone's demonstrating
that something is possible,
anyone who's really an open
minded scientist ought to be
excited and interested to find
out why it's possible. But there
aren't any funds for them to do
it."
leavons is not alone in his
observation of "scientific
myopia" in the present
academic community. In April,
1973, Nicholas Wade reported
in Science magazine that "a
blue-ribbon committee of
basic and agricultural scien
tists" found that "the basic re
search performed by federal
and state agricultural research
organizations is of meager
quality, suffers from a 'shock
ing lack of intellectual leader
ship' and is guided by policies
detrimental to the interests of
agriculture."
Although no reference was
made to a lack of attention to
any specific area of research,
University of Chicago Biology
Prof. Richard Levins wrote in a
later issue of Science that "the
issues raised by Nicholas
Wade's report have to be set
into a broader context than
simply the policies of the U.S.
Department of Agricul
ture. . . . Within agricultural
science, America's traditional
anti-intellectualism survives as
an antitheoretical bias. . . .It is
reinforced by the search for
marketable products (mostly
chemical) as the central
strategy for improvement of
agriculture . . . and by a nar
row acceptance of the present
structure of agriculture as a
given condition which restricts
options. For example, the con
sideration of mixed plantings is
inhibited by the present design
of farm machinery."
The tone of both articles asks
the question, "Ought we to let
this happen?" The tone taken
increasingly by more and more
far-sighted scientists today,
however, is "Can we afford to
let this happen?" jeavons him
self points to the dwindling
supply of natural gas — the
current reserves of which are
slated to run out in about a de
cade — as one factor which
could lead to an agricultural
disaster. Since the production
of artificial nitrogen fertilizer
has been made almost wholly
dependent on natural gas, he
says, and since there is evi-

dence indi
cating that
nitrogen fi
xation from
the air by
soil bac
teria stops
in the pre
sence of ar
tificial fer
tilizer
which in

turn causes a soil "addiction"
to this form of fertilizer, it
seems likely that we will be
faced with the necessity of
using pollution-producing coal
to satisfy our farmlands'
"habit." And even the coal
supply will someday be
exhausted.
Yet even if the scarcity of
energy were not an issue, the
question would still be a valid
one. In addition to beini:


ecologically unsound, our pre
sent system of food production
is economically and technolog
ically unsatisfactory for a large
segment of the world's popula
tion. As Frances Moore Lappe
and ]oseph Collins de
monstrate in their book, Food
First, the expensive technology
and inflated prices which "ag
ribusiness" and its "global
supermarket" force on unde
veloped nations do as much to
hinder their progress as any
other single factor.
Jeavons' belief is that the
solution to many of the world's
food-related problems —
ecological, economical and
technological — lies in a global
move to small-scale farming. A
February, 1976 paper released
by Ecology Action states that
"the current food shortages
will worsen into a crisis of
global proportions unless the
productivity of the 100 million
small farms in the developing
world is increased dramati
cally. Several key points make
the biodynamic-Fiench inten
sive method especially viable
in countries with limited re
sources: The method does not
require complicated machin
ery or expensive fertilizers.
The key technological element
is the common shovel. The
method uses 1/2 to 1/16 the wa
ter. This will be especially valu
able in arid areas of the world,
or those limited to natural rain
fall. The method provides a
self-sufficient livelihood in
areas of high unemployment.
The method's diversified ap
proach encourages intercrop
ping with local foods, thus of
fering a varied diet. The
method builds a healthy soil,
the key to dependable food
production and the building of
a stable economic and social
system."
And, according to a paper
co-authored by leavons, "The
small farm, all factors consi
dered, is actually a more effi
cient unit of production than
its large-scale counterpart. To
quote Sterling Wortman of the
Rockerfeller Foundation, . .
most large-scale mechanized
agriculture is less productive
per unit area than small scale
farming can be. The farmer on
a small holding can engage in
intensive high yield gardening,
systems such as intercropping,
multiple cropping, relay plant
ing or other techniques that
require attention to individual
plants. The point is that
mechanized agriculture is very
productive in terms of output
per man-year, but it is not as
productive per unit of land as
the highly intensive systems
are.' Much of the economic
advantage large farms now
enjoy is not due to any stream
lining inherent in their size but
in the tax structures and sub
sidies which favor corporate
'tax loss' farming, land specula
tion, and vertical stratification
of the food industry from pro
duction of fertilizers, to farm
ing, to packaging and distribu
tion of food products."
Jeavons is generally unop
timistic

about the
prospects
for a rapid
change
from our
current ag
ricultural
practices,
projecting
50years as a
minimum

before such a transformation
will be started on a large scale.
"The thing that has always con
fused me," he told me, "is why
so few people have asked why
can't we keep the organic,
small-scale simplicity and also
have the sophistication of
modern science. I think one
reason why people don't get
into that too much is because
they're thinking on a closed

system basis — and it gets away
from a growth economy.
There's no audience for this in
this country, very few people
living that kind of lifestyle.
They're not putting their
energy into making it happen.
They're still chasing the growth
economy that is epitomized by
the development of the tractor
and the chemical fertilizers."
Lemmings have at least one
thing to recommend them
over mankind — at least when
they rush to their destruction,
•they do not drag the rest of the
planet with them. But mankind
has at least one thing to re
commend it over lemmings: at
least as it rushes to its destruc
tion, it can see where it is going
and attempt to stop before it is

too late.
It often
seems,
however,
that rather
than at
tempting to
stop our
sprint to
ward an
nihilation,

one part of
our species is actively engaged
in accelerating our progress
while the other part fiddles
marching tunes like a whole
race of carefree Neros. We find
our leaders more concerned
with their own destinies than
those of the people they are
supposed to lead; we find, in
fact, that they seem to have no
awareness of any destiny other
than their own. We find them
structuring our culture for
their own ends, without regard
for any future more distant
than the probable span of their
lives. We find an educational
system which perpetuates
their narrow-sightedness. We
at the summit of our culture
find ourselves in the midst of a
highly-sophisticated,
apparently-benign process
which teaches us to shut our
eyes and go faster.
But then it can not be de
nied: the power of vision has
not left us entirely; there are
those who do stretch their
necks to look around. It is no
doubt painful and traumatic to
take a long look at the destruc
tion which we are cultivating.
But there are, these people tell
us, other views, views as prom
ising as the scene immediately
before us is threatening. And,
hope being what it is, they are
working to divert our rush.
)eavons, obviously, is such a
man. He is not militant, anar
chistic, alienated, alienating or
bitter. As he says, "you don't
really need to change the sys
tem to live a better life."
leavons is just quietly pursuing
his work, doing what he can to
bring about an improvement in
the attitude of our culture.

The headquarters of the Syn
tex Corporation is located
on a hillside just west of Footh
ill Expressway, across from
Palo Alto's Veterans Administ
ration Hospital. A large cement
and glass building in the mod
ern architectural style, it sits on
a very green and well-groomed
lawn. At the foot of the hill,
however, literally a stone's
throw away from the
chemical-pharmaceuticals bas
tion, an incongruous sight pre
sents itself: a truck garden, in
the best tradition of truck gar
dens. It is a disorderly collage
of colors and textures — the
lush green of crops and weeds,
the crumbling dark brown of
newly turned earth, the dry
light brown of withered vege
tation, the dusty white sheen
of sheet plastic, the hard lustre
less gray of metal siding.

A casual passerby, observing
the two establishments, would
be likely to see in their proxim
ity the tension which often
exists between the new and
dynamic and the old and static.
Palo Aito, he might surmise, is
in the final stages of a
metamorphosis from the pas
toral to the cosmopolitan; the
garden, a quaint anachronism,
will soon be the site of yet
another corporate headquar
ters and the cement and glass
building on the hillside will ac
quire, by comparison, an air of
establishment and seniority.

Such is not the case, how
ever. Quite to the contrary, the
cement and glass building
antedates the garden; the land
on which the garden is located
is owned by the corporation
and worked by the garden's
proprietors under the terms of
a rent-free lease; the operation
of the garden is partially sub
sidized, with virtually no return
obligations, by the corpora
tion's donation, in addition to
the land, of water and funds. It
is an unusual situation, but it is
an unusual truck garden.
Foods ranging from grains to
fruit to beans to vegetables are
under cultivation there. The
yield of any given foodstuff at
any given harvest time typically
ranges from two to 31 times the
national, California or Santa
Clara County average
(whichever is higher). From
one-half to one-sixteenth the
average amount of water per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. From one-half to
one-sixteenth the average
amount of nitrogen fertilizer
per pound of food produced is
typically used. About one
one-hundredth the energy per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. No "chemical" fer
tilizer is used. Mo pesticides of
any type are used. No machin
ery more sophisticated than a
simple wheelbarrow is used.
And it is not uncommon to see
men and women in business
dress entering or leaving the
garden or engaged in some
phase of agriculture.
Despite these arresting facts,
the garden and its proprietors
remain surprisingly anonym
ous. Perhaps it is the
previously-described undis
tinguished character of the
former, or maybe it is the
quiet, unassuming style of the
latter. It may even be that it has
less to do with either the
former or latter than the nature
of the rest of the world. What
ever the case, it would be a
poor bet indeed to wager that
that anonymity is to be pre
served for very much longer.
Although I have been in
terested in food in general
and gardening in specific for
much of my life, the terms
"biodynamic" and "French in
tensive" remained obscure to
me until I made the acquain
tance of John leavons. An
alumnus of Yale and former
head of Business Services for
the Stanford library system,
leavons currently wields the

ponderous title of Director of
Agricultural Research for Ecol
ogy Action of the Midpenin
sula.
It is largely Jeavons who is
responsible for the present
shape — in both a physLal and
an abstract sense — of the ag
ricultural program underway
on the three and three-quarter
acre plot of Syntex land. It was
Jeavons who, after making a
study on his own initiative of
United Nations iand use and

population
figures, be
came con
vinced that
the planet
was still
capable of
feeding all
her in
habitants;
it was he
who, after
attending a
seminar on
the agricul
tural
techniques

synthesized by the Englishman
Alan Chadwick, sought out the
master horticulturalist in his
barren hillside-turned Garden
of Eden at the University of
California at Santa Cruz; it was
Jeavons who, after talking at
length with Chadwick, prop
osed the idea of a combined
research and community gar
den to the board of directors of
Ecology Action, a Palo Alto
conservation group which had
won recognition for a success
ful city-wide recycling prog-

ram; it was he who, after con
vincing them of the viability
and significance of such a
program, proceeded to as
semble the elements of Com
mon Ground — land, funds,
people — and embark on a
course of rigorous scientific
research.
The program is now in its
sixth year. Each succeeding
year has, according to Jeavons,
confirmed his faith in Chad
wick's techniques, known now
as the biodynamic-French in
tensive method.
When I first spoke with
leavons, I had a vague recollec
tion of a chapter in a gardening
book which had described a
"labor-intensive" system of
farming which allowed the
densely-populated countries
of western Europe to grow
much food on little land. This, I
imagined, was related to
"French-intensive" farming. In
his articulate and methodical
way, Jeavons soon clarified and
expanded this conception —
and made me realize how large
a topic this form of agriculture
had become.
"The method we're using
now," he said, "is made up of
two techniques that were de
veloped in Europe around the
turn of the century. The French
intensive method is one—that
reached its culmination in the
1890s outside Paris. What it did
was it raised vegetables in beds
that consisted of 18 inches of
horse manure — which was re
ally plentiful at the time. Be
cause of this high level of or
ganic matter and the fertility it
created, as well as the great
depth of loose material, roots
were able to grow downward
instead of needing room to
grow out horizontally. So they
were able to use very close
spacing."
This simple concept, leavons
continued, accounts for a sig
nificant part of the increased
yields which the method pro
duces. As jeavons phrased it in
a research report summarizing
Common Ground's first four
years, "A simple 24-inch deep
soil preparation allows the

plants to be spaced more
closely so that their leaves
touch or almost touch. . . .
This factor alone would make
fourfold yields possible be
cause four times as many
plants as usual can be planted
in a given area."
"The other technique,"
Jeavons told me, "was the
biodynamic technique. It was
developed in the 1920s by
Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian
genius who was into educa
tion, philosophy, religion, and
agriculture. The French inten
sive method had been de
veloped over hundreds of
years by French marchiers or
gardeners. The biodynamic
method, though, was de
veloped by Steiner in the late
'20s fora lot of wealthy German
farmers who had noticed that
their yields were going down
and they were getting more in
sect and disease problems. It
turned out they had been using
chemical fertilizers. Urea, a
kind of artifical nitrogen, had
been developed in the late
1880s. Steiner traced their
problems to the chemical fer
tilizers and suggested that they
return to some of their old
methods and adopt five special
practices. These practices be
camethe biodynamic method.
"One was the use of raised
beds — beds only 12 inches
deep prepared by raking soil
out of the path. This was going
back to the Greeks who found
out that plants grew better in
landslides. The raised beds as
they came to be dug were like
little, artificial landslides. The
reasons the plants do better in
them is because the soil is
looser and there's more air or
gases in it — you need up to 50
percent gases for good plant
growth."
jeavons frequently uses the
verb "dovetail" to describe
areas where two concepts in
termesh or compliment each
other. The deep soil prepara
tion and close spacing of the
French intensive method
dovetails, he said, with the "ar
tificial landslides" of the
biodynamic method to pro

duce healthier, more produc
tive plants.
"There was a study in the '50s
at the University of California
at Berkeley," he said, "that
showed that if you improved
root health by two to four per
cent for most common field
crops you could increase the
yields by 200 to 400 percent.
One of the things which can
make this possible is better soil
preparation and aeration. With
our method, you have more air
in the soil, more surface area
for contact between soil and air
since a raised bed has a curved
surface and also more surface
area to absorb rain or watering
and warmth from the sun. And
the curved surface also allows
you to increase the planting
area by 20 percent. Say you
have a plot of land that's a
hundred square feet and you
make it a raised bed, you can
wind up with 120 square feet of
planting area.
"The second technique that
Steiner recommended, after
the raised beds — which inci
dentally may even have gone
back even before the Greeks to
the Chinese, possibly 4000
years ago — was the use of or
ganic fertilizers. Chemical fer
tilizers at the time were mainly
just nitrogen or nitrogen and
phosphorous. They weren't
balanced or complete; they
needed trace minerals and
potash. Also the chemical fer
tilizers broke down very
quickly and harmed the texture
and structure of the soil and
killed the microbiotic life and

so forth. So Steiner asked the
German farmers to return to
organic fertilizers that were
more balanced and diverse —
like fish meal which has nitro
gen, phosphorous and trace
mi nerals and breaks down over
a period of six months instead
of four to six weeks.
"The third technique was
companion planting. There
were a lot of folk myths about
what things to grow well to
gether. Steiner tried to scienti
fically investigate this through
such techniques as
chromatography and crystalli
zation and field testing to de
termine which plants grown
together would do better. For
instance, one part chamomile
grown with two hundred parts
of wheat increases the health
and yield of wheat. But if its
one to one, one part
chamomile grown with one
part wheat, the wheat will be
destroyed, or at least seriously
harmed.
"Another technique was the
use of herbal sprays. At one
point they were almost a cult.
You take stinging nettles, for
example, and you do some
thing like — I can't remember
exactly — bury it three feet
under the ground at a certain
conjunction of the plants and
leave it under there for six
months and dig it up and mix it
in with a water solution and
then spray it on the ground. It's
supposed to stimulate the
micorobiotic life of the soil
which helps the plants. Really
far out, really unusual, but it
works.
"And the fifth thing was
planting by the phases of the
moon. The rationale for this
comes from seeing the moon's
effect on oceans — daily tides
of up to 40 feet in some parts of
the world. There's water in the
ground, in seeds and in plants
so it seems there might be a
small effect there.
"So those were the two
threads — the French intensive
method and Steiner's five
biodynamic techniques.
"Now, Chadwick, who is, I
think, a horticultural genius,

certainly a horticultural artist,
put these two techniques to
gether sometime between the
1930s and the 1960s when he
came to Santa Cruz. He had
been severely exasperated by
the second world war. A
woman named Freiavon Molka
and he got together and de
cided that one of the best ways
to bring peace and life and
harmony back into the world
was through gardens. Chad
wick had studied under the
French marchiers and he had
studied under Steiner. He's
had over 50 years of experience
in raising food. He also worked
under George Bernard Shaw in
drama, he's a painter, an actor,
an incredible individual — very
dramatic in his presentation of
things.
"When he put the two farm
ing techniques together, he
simplified them. Where
Steiner would make herbal
preparations, Chadwick would
just grow the herb, the stinging
nettle say, in the bed and then
put it in the compost pile and
let it have a living kind of influ
ence. Instead of using dead
mulches he used living mulch
— when the plants are so close
together that their leaves just
about touch, the ground is
shaded, moisture is con
served, a micro-climate is
created. So his whole orienta
tion is using living plants and
giving to nature as much as she
produces and even a little
more. If you give to nature
more than she gives you, she
will continually provide you
with abundance.
"So Chadwick prepares his
beds 24 inches deep, not just
18, he uses compost mainly
from vegetable matter, he uses
very little manure — in contrast
with the French and in contrast
with the other biodynamic
people who sometimes use a
lot of manure. This is important
worldwide because one-third
of the world's people now have
a different kind of energy
crisis: they don't have enough
firewood. So like in India,
they're burning the manure
from animals to heat their
homes and to cook their food.
There's a fertilizer shortage
there. But you don't need the
manure under Chadwick's
technique; most of it is veget
able compost, as I said.
"So he uses 24-inch-deep
soil preparation; close spac
ing; comparatively speaking, a
vegetarian or quasi-vegetarian
compost that's two-thirds veg
etable matter, one-third soil;
he uses living herbs rather than
herbal sprays, generally; he
uses some organic fertilizers,
mainly bone meal but not
much else; and he plants by
the phases of the moon."
/ / K| ow we started re-
searching the method
in 1972. Our purposes were
twofold. One was to document
how the method was done — it
had never been documented
in written form because Chad
wick doesn't believe in the
written word but by handing
things down by example and
by word of mouth, master to
apprentice and so forth. Also it
had been reputed that the
method produced four times
the average yield, but this had
never been documented one
way or another.
"The lot Syntex gave us had a
soil which was one-third rock
— meaning pebbles and stuff.
Normal agricultural soil is
maybe five percent rock, not 33
percent. In addition, our soil
was over one-third clay. There
was no nitrogen fertilizer in the
soil and just a trace of phos
phorous and potash.
"During our first five years
we got very encouraging re
sults — yields which ranged
anywhere from two to 16 times
the U.S., Santa Clara County or
California averages. Then in
1976, I developed a new

technique called 'superdig
ging' which is a sort of a super
texturizing technique. This
technique improves the soil
more rapidly. It takes up to five
years using normal techniques
to improve the soil. Re
member, we were in subsoil
clay with no top soil at all. As a
result of this new technique,
this year we've gone as high as
about 60 times the Santa Clara
County average with zucchini
using about two percent of the
water per pound of food pro
duced and one percent of the
added nitrogen fertilizer per
pound of food produced. In
the case of grain, we're as high
as two and a quarter times the
national average on soybeans,

double on
wheat and
expect to
go six to
eight times
for those
yields.
Also, we
expect to
be using
one third to
one-eighth
the water
per pound
of grain
produced
— and that
could be
significant
because it
means you

could be getting very high
grain yields with as little as
eight or 10 inches of rainfall.
Over 75 percent of the arable
area of the world has 10 or
more inches of rainfall.
"An interesting thing is that
the Zulus of South Africa use a
similar technique — similar to
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method, that is, that they
developed on their own. It's a
triple-digging technique, lust
before it rains they prepare the
soil three feet deep and as
soon as it does rain they plant
their grain. It doesn't rain all
summer and is very dry. They
grow grain when no one else
can grow grain anywhere. So
here's a similar technique
that's working under natural
rainfall conditions.
"What this means is that if
we reach all of our projections,
we would be getting an aver
age of four to eight times on
vegetables and six to eight
times the average yield on
grain. And these yields, by the
way are already being obtained
somewhere else in the world
on the average — and on a
large scale basis. A way to high
light this is to say that for every
major crop grown in the Un
ited States, some other country
in the world on the average is
getting a yield about twice as
high. So U.S. agriculture,
though it may look good, is not
the best with all crops."
One morning soon after our
first conversation, I met
Jeavons for a tour of the Com
mon Ground garden. He is
plainly in his element there. A
fairly large man in his mid-30s
he sports an incipient pot belly
and a voluminous though
well-behaved beard. He was
dressed in mud-spattered
work pants, a heavy flannel
shirt and a sweat-stained
leather cap. He generally main
tains a serious demeanor al
though when he smiles he re
veals a considerable capacity
for simple delight. His eyes
especially, manifest his posi
tive attitude: whether engaged
in a visual analysis of crop
progress, gazing at clouds in
the distance or glancing at his
auditor, they are intelligent,
energetic, unusually alive.
He took me first to some
thing he called an "herbal
lawn." From a distance, this
looked similar to a grass lawn
— green and flat. Standing next
to it, however, I saw that its

color was not uniform. In
terspersed among the light
green of sweet clover were
plants of darker shades —
identified by Jeavons as Roman
chamomile, creeping thyme
and dwarf yarrow. In addition
to being "simple and beauti
ful," Jeavons said, the lawn
fixes nitrogen in the soil and
concentrates phosphorous
and potash in its leaves. It is
thus beneficial to the soil on
which it is grown and can be
mown as a source of
nutriment-rich compost.
For the next hour we looked
at such things as newly-planted
fruit trees, fragrant and useful
herbs, fallow planting beds,
freshly-prepared planting

beds, planting beds overflow
ing with mature vegetables and
legumes, and recently har
vested planting beds. All the
while Jeavons kept up an in
teresting commentary filled
with odd facts and anecdotes.
"You see those nicely dug beds
over there?" he asked at one
point. "Those were prepared
by a 65-year-old woman with a
heart condition."
Finally, he led me to a
fenced-off area with a pad
locked gate. "This is the re
search garden," he said.
"What we've been looking at is
the community garden. People
from all over, including about
five to 10 percent of all the Syn
tex employees, are involved
with raising food here."
Inside the research garden
were rows of beds each about
six feet wide and 20 feet long. I
was slightly disappointed by
the modest dimensions of the
whole garden — smaller than
that occupied by the average
house — since it seemed that
something larger would be re
quired for such significant re
search.
"This area is about 2500
square feet," Jeavons said as if
reading my thoughts. "Our re
search indicates that a com
pletely balanced diet could be
grown on this much space —
and with as little as a half hour
of work a day. The same
amount of food, if it were
grown by U.S. chemical,
mechanized techniques would
take 10,000 square feet. In In
dia, the same diet would take
32,000 square feet.
"Now, the average American
eats 322 pounds of vegetables
and soft fruits — fruits like
strawberries, cantalopes and
watermelon — a year. Two
hundred and twenty of those
pounds are potatoes. You can
grow that amount of vegeta
bles with the biodynamic-
French intensive method in 100
square feet in a four to six
month growing season. In the
case of fruit trees, you can put
two of them in a hundred
square foot bed on eight foot
centers. Each of those fruit
trees should produce a
hundred pounds of hard fruit
per year and the average
American eats 162 pounds of
hard fruit a year. It should take
you maybe a half a minute to a
minute a day to take care of the
trees on an average basis and it
should take you about five to
10 minutes a day to take care of

the vegetable bed.
"So what we're talking about
is eventually people can start
raising a fair amount of their
food just in their back yard. A
family of four, in 400 square
feet, could raise in a four to six
month growing season food
worth $480 in five to 10 minutes
a day each. Their labor would
then be worth $4 to $8 an hour.
Now a person is probably not
going to do this the first year if
he's never gardened before,
but he's going to do a lot better
than he's done with other
techniques. What this means
for overseas, for India, for
example, where they have fer
tilizer shortages, energy shor
tages, water shortages and
food shortages, is that in a
small area, say 2500 to 7000
square feet they could raise
their total diet rather than in
32,000 square feet. So small is
beautiful: in this country, de
escalation of technology; for
overseas, a move to more self
sufficiency."
We moved to a bed with
some dried leaves and with
ered stalks in it which I recog
nized as potatoes, leavons
went on.
"Now in monetary terms,
with potatoes, we're now at
four times the national average
but we expect to go much
higher— maybe well above 20.
We're still experimenting with
that. I can't tell you on the re
cord how high we expect to go
but I can say on the record it's
over 20. With zucchini, when
we got only 16 times the Santa
Clara county average, the bed
produced $12.50 an hour — or
would have if we'd sold it all at
the wholesale rate. Now that
we're up to 60, we're talking
about producing three times
that or $37.50 an hour. This is
an extreme case but it should
be possible to earn a minimum
of $4 an hour just raising your
own vegetables.
"We're guessing that a new
kind of job or profession will
come out of all of this — mini
farming. We estimate that it
will be possible for one person
working a 40-hour week to
raise $15,000 net on as little as a
quarter of an acre. Currently
small farmers with farms of 200
to4oo acres are lucky if they net
several thousand dollars.
"So our philosophy is one of
low techonology, that is, simple
technology but sophisticated
theory. And I should say that
we're not a 'labor-intensive'
method as many people have
said we are. It's actually 'skill
intensive.' Bed preparation
may be the hardest job of the
method but once the soil is in
good shape and using a new
device that they've developed
in Canada, it should be possi
ble to prepare a bed in five to
10 minutes.
"All the resources that we
need to raise food right are av
ailable— we're just using them
in the wrong way. Take wheat
production, for example.
Normally to produce more
grain you have to use a lot
more fertilizer. For instance
with corn, from 1940 to 1960,
the nitrogen fertilizer use in
creased 10-fold, but the yields
only doubled. So your fertilizer
effectiveness was only one
fifth as good in 1960 as it was in
1940. Well, we cut our nitrogen
fertilizer use in one year to
one-half and the yield dou
bled. At the same time the pro
tein content increased. It went
from 14.8 percent to 15.7.
Normally when your yields go
up, your protein content per
pound of food goes down. Plus
we used less water and less
energy, less phosphorous and
less potash.
"Eventually, if we get all the
projections that we expect to
get, we'll be producing as
much food per hour as people
with machines can produce. So
this makes the individual im

portant again and gives the in
dividual a choice.
"I should stress that we've
got a ways to go yet. We don't
have a perfect system. We have
failures; we haven't reached all
our projections, but we've had
a lot of good results too.
"Right now, we think if the
method has an Achilles heel, it
will be in the net flow of or
ganic matter in and out of the
soil. We may have to face the
possibility that with the yields
we're now getting, we'll
exhaust the soil in a few more
years. The most important
thing about an agricultural
method is whether it is sustain
able in an environmentally ba
lanced way. The Chinese have
been able for hundreds of
years to grow twice as much
food as the United States does
now. And by using manual, or
ganic techniques and fertiliz
ers grown or produced on their
farms. But we may have to face
the possibility that our sustain
able yield level will be less than
our optimum yield level."
Jeavons turned away from
the potato bed and regarded
me fora moment, as if to make
sure I had understood every
thing up to that point. After tak
ing a deep breath, he turned
and pointed to a pair of
plastic-covered structures
which were, evidently,
greenhouses. One was very
similar in appearance to a con
ventional greenhouse but the
other one was only three feet
high and just covered one
hundred-square-foot bed.
"Now with these miniature
greenhouses," Jeavons said,
"a 12-month growing season is
possible in most climates
where food is grown. What this
means is you could grow your
total diet on as little as 1250
square feet working as little as
15 minutes a day." He walked
to the center of the area and
spread his arms. "That's this
much," he said, his tone imply
ing how little he thought 1250
square feet to be. I was a little
incredulous for a moment be
cause the space he indicated
really seemed no larger than
the average living room. But
then I remembered that an
acre is somewhat more than
40,000 square feet. I had no
trouble believing that the de
signated area was about a thir
tieth of an acre. "And, he said,
with a smile, "even though it's
too early to say on the record,
we expect to go much, much
lower than that to grow a total
diet."

In 1840 the German chemist
Justus von Liebig published a
paper entitled "Chemistry in
its application to agriculture
and physiology." This event,
giving birth to a whole new ap •
proach to the cultivation of
food — which I will call "chem
ical agriculture" — intruded
into the gradual evolution of
farming with all the virulence
of a malignant tumor.
It is true that relatively little
change had taken place in ag
riculture since the dawn of
civilization — 4000 years or

more if one goes back to the
Chinese farmers mentioned by
Jeavons; it is true that during
the period in which chemical
agriculture was developed in
earnest — from the 1880s to the
1920s — the world's population
was growing at a heretofore
unimaginable rate; and it is
true that many well
intentioned people saw in
chemical agriculture the only
means of putting food in the
staggering number of new and
hungry mouths.
It is also true, however, that
concurrent with the rise of
chemical agriculture were the
several great strides outlined
by Jeavons — the strides which
developed in a relatively short
time into the biodynamic-
French intensive method. As
chemical agriculture
burgeoned into an industry
and an orthodoxy, men such as
Rudolf Steiner — and he was
far from alone — recognized
the folly of abandoning
methods proven over millenia
for new and untried
techniques. On the next occa
sion on which I met with
jeavons, I asked him what he
believed were the causes for
the headlong rush toward
chemicals in the face of saner
councils.
"Well, part of the reason,"
he said, "was that as chemical
fertilizers came into play, trac
tors were being developed and
brought into use on many
farms. This made it possible to
spread chemical fertilizer very
easily. It was less time
consuming than spreading
manures. Also, with the tractor
you were able to farm large
areas. Even though it wasn't in
tensive, you could farm a large
area and produce a lot of food
in a very short time. The prom
ise of opening up increased ac
reage was very seductive. To
most people, two to four times
the area meant two to four
times the food. On the other
hand, the French intensive cul
ture that was developed out
side Paris required an awful lot
of people per acre. So with
everyone getting caught up in
the petrochemical
mechanized revolution, the
tendency was to equate 'faster'
with 'more and better.' Which
for a short time was probably
true. But if we get into today's
period, the petrochemicals are
getting more expensive so
spending more time and labor
to get the same amount of food
isn't as unappealing as it used
to be. But more important, I

believe,
from the
perspective
of our re
search, is
that we be
lieve we're
going to be
able to
produce as
much food
per hour as
a machine
can — by
hand. The
way that
we're going
to be able
to do this is
by thinking
about

what's been done in the past,
about what's being done cur
rently, and maximizing the
simplicity which produces the
time efficiency."
During the course of the last
half century, many of the
spokesmen for non-chemical
agriculture have found them
selves ostracized for their be
liefs and techniques. At best
they have been ignored by the
academic and political estab
lishment, at worst they have
been actively harassed and
obstructed in presenting their
cases before the public. One of


these men, Sir Albert Howard,
an Imperial Botanist for the In
dian government, "did some
fantastic things," according to
Jeavons. "Everyone had told
him he couldn't grow cotton
organically in India because
the pests would eat it up. It
took him a while but at the end
of five years, he was growing
cotton organically — with no
pesticides. He had less crop
loss than the people who were
using pesticides."
Although knighted for this
and other accomplishments,
Howard received so much pub
lic ridicule — both from fer-

tilizer in
dustry
spokesmen
and his fel
low scien
tists — that
his ideas
went
widely un
heeded.
Howard
wrote, after

addressing one particularly
nonreceptive audience of
botanists, "Here again I was
amazed by the limited know
ledge and experience of the
world's agriculturalists dis
closed by this debate. I felt I
was dealing with beginners
and that some of the argu
ments put forward could al
most be described as the im
pertinences of ignorance."
In this country, the case of
|.l. Rodale, whose publications
are among the standard refer
ences for a large segment of
the organic farming popula
tion, is not unusual. Rodale
was forced to spend almost a
quarter of a million dollars in
legal fees to win a court deci
sion over the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission which had
blocked the publication of his
book "The Health Finder."
I asked )eavons whether he
thought these examples indi
cated the presence of an estab
lishment which had a vested in
terest in the development and
maintenance of chemical ag
riculture irrespective of the
best interests of mankind. It
was true, he said, that
"businessmen are always
ready to take advantage of a
good thing and push it to the
fullest," but there were proba
bly "two separate thrusts" —
business incentives and desire
for greater efficiency — which
"then became merged."
leavons then related an in
teresting anecdote, most of
which had to remain off the re
cord, which was a telling
statement about the present
state of agricultural research.
"It was amazing to me," he
said, "that agricultural schools
are not more interested in re
search like that (Howard's),
and in trying to replicate it — at
least as an alternative ap
proach. I wrote a letter to an
individual who was involved in
agricultural research at a col
lege here in California. I told
him I was confused. In the light
of some of the possibilities we
were uncovering with the
biodynamic-French intensive
method, why wasn't anyone
investigating our results. He
wrote me back a very good let
ter. He indicated that the re
search money is coming from
thechemical industriesand the
agricultural interests. They
have an interest in using the
system they've already got.
And again, their purpose is
making money from it, not
necessarily making it better. So
you see, the professors almost
have to ridicule alternative
methods. If they go into other
areas, they become profes
sionally ostracized and they
can't get funds."
leavons continued with
another anecdote, this time
regarding a conference about
the biodynamic-French inten
sive method which was held

last year in Santa Barbara. Sev
eral members of the American
Society of Agronomy had at
tended, he said, and had asked
questions about the
mechanisms of the improved
plant growth. "If we couldn't
tell them exactly how it was
happening, in their terms and
language, they wouldn't give it
very much credence. Someone
pointed out that the Romans
knew how to make concrete a
long time before anyone knew
why it worked. There's a kind
of scientific myopia here. It's
like they're saying, you can
only be scientific if you're sci
entific in the way in which we
are scientific. Well, good lord,
if someone's demonstrating
that something is possible,
anyone who's really an open
minded scientist ought to be
excited and interested to find
out why it's possible. But there
aren't any funds for them to do
it."
leavons is not alone in his
observation of "scientific
myopia" in the present
academic community. In April,
1973, Nicholas Wade reported
in Science magazine that "a
blue-ribbon committee of
basic and agricultural scien
tists" found that "the basic re
search performed by federal
and state agricultural research
organizations is of meager
quality, suffers from a 'shock
ing lack of intellectual leader
ship' and is guided by policies
detrimental to the interests of
agriculture."
Although no reference was
made to a lack of attention to
any specific area of research,
University of Chicago Biology
Prof. Richard Levins wrote in a
later issue of Science that "the
issues raised by Nicholas
Wade's report have to be set
into a broader context than
simply the policies of the U.S.
Department of Agricul
ture. . . . Within agricultural
science, America's traditional
anti-intellectualism survives as
an antitheoretical bias. . . .It is
reinforced by the search for
marketable products (mostly
chemical) as the central
strategy for improvement of
agriculture . . . and by a nar
row acceptance of the present
structure of agriculture as a
given condition which restricts
options. For example, the con
sideration of mixed plantings is
inhibited by the present design
of farm machinery."
The tone of both articles asks
the question, "Ought we to let
this happen?" The tone taken
increasingly by more and more
far-sighted scientists today,
however, is "Can we afford to
let this happen?" jeavons him
self points to the dwindling
supply of natural gas — the
current reserves of which are
slated to run out in about a de
cade — as one factor which
could lead to an agricultural
disaster. Since the production
of artificial nitrogen fertilizer
has been made almost wholly
dependent on natural gas, he
says, and since there is evi-

dence indi
cating that
nitrogen fi
xation from
the air by
soil bac
teria stops
in the pre
sence of ar
tificial fer
tilizer
which in

turn causes a soil "addiction"
to this form of fertilizer, it
seems likely that we will be
faced with the necessity of
using pollution-producing coal
to satisfy our farmlands'
"habit." And even the coal
supply will someday be
exhausted.
Yet even if the scarcity of
energy were not an issue, the
question would still be a valid
one. In addition to beini:


ecologically unsound, our pre
sent system of food production
is economically and technolog
ically unsatisfactory for a large
segment of the world's popula
tion. As Frances Moore Lappe
and ]oseph Collins de
monstrate in their book, Food
First, the expensive technology
and inflated prices which "ag
ribusiness" and its "global
supermarket" force on unde
veloped nations do as much to
hinder their progress as any
other single factor.
Jeavons' belief is that the
solution to many of the world's
food-related problems —
ecological, economical and
technological — lies in a global
move to small-scale farming. A
February, 1976 paper released
by Ecology Action states that
"the current food shortages
will worsen into a crisis of
global proportions unless the
productivity of the 100 million
small farms in the developing
world is increased dramati
cally. Several key points make
the biodynamic-Fiench inten
sive method especially viable
in countries with limited re
sources: The method does not
require complicated machin
ery or expensive fertilizers.
The key technological element
is the common shovel. The
method uses 1/2 to 1/16 the wa
ter. This will be especially valu
able in arid areas of the world,
or those limited to natural rain
fall. The method provides a
self-sufficient livelihood in
areas of high unemployment.
The method's diversified ap
proach encourages intercrop
ping with local foods, thus of
fering a varied diet. The
method builds a healthy soil,
the key to dependable food
production and the building of
a stable economic and social
system."
And, according to a paper
co-authored by leavons, "The
small farm, all factors consi
dered, is actually a more effi
cient unit of production than
its large-scale counterpart. To
quote Sterling Wortman of the
Rockerfeller Foundation, . .
most large-scale mechanized
agriculture is less productive
per unit area than small scale
farming can be. The farmer on
a small holding can engage in
intensive high yield gardening,
systems such as intercropping,
multiple cropping, relay plant
ing or other techniques that
require attention to individual
plants. The point is that
mechanized agriculture is very
productive in terms of output
per man-year, but it is not as
productive per unit of land as
the highly intensive systems
are.' Much of the economic
advantage large farms now
enjoy is not due to any stream
lining inherent in their size but
in the tax structures and sub
sidies which favor corporate
'tax loss' farming, land specula
tion, and vertical stratification
of the food industry from pro
duction of fertilizers, to farm
ing, to packaging and distribu
tion of food products."
Jeavons is generally unop
timistic

about the
prospects
for a rapid
change
from our
current ag
ricultural
practices,
projecting
50years as a
minimum

before such a transformation
will be started on a large scale.
"The thing that has always con
fused me," he told me, "is why
so few people have asked why
can't we keep the organic,
small-scale simplicity and also
have the sophistication of
modern science. I think one
reason why people don't get
into that too much is because
they're thinking on a closed

system basis — and it gets away
from a growth economy.
There's no audience for this in
this country, very few people
living that kind of lifestyle.
They're not putting their
energy into making it happen.
They're still chasing the growth
economy that is epitomized by
the development of the tractor
and the chemical fertilizers."
Lemmings have at least one
thing to recommend them
over mankind — at least when
they rush to their destruction,
•they do not drag the rest of the
planet with them. But mankind
has at least one thing to re
commend it over lemmings: at
least as it rushes to its destruc
tion, it can see where it is going
and attempt to stop before it is

too late.
It often
seems,
however,
that rather
than at
tempting to
stop our
sprint to
ward an
nihilation,

one part of
our species is actively engaged
in accelerating our progress
while the other part fiddles
marching tunes like a whole
race of carefree Neros. We find
our leaders more concerned
with their own destinies than
those of the people they are
supposed to lead; we find, in
fact, that they seem to have no
awareness of any destiny other
than their own. We find them
structuring our culture for
their own ends, without regard
for any future more distant
than the probable span of their
lives. We find an educational
system which perpetuates
their narrow-sightedness. We
at the summit of our culture
find ourselves in the midst of a
highly-sophisticated,
apparently-benign process
which teaches us to shut our
eyes and go faster.
But then it can not be de
nied: the power of vision has
not left us entirely; there are
those who do stretch their
necks to look around. It is no
doubt painful and traumatic to
take a long look at the destruc
tion which we are cultivating.
But there are, these people tell
us, other views, views as prom
ising as the scene immediately
before us is threatening. And,
hope being what it is, they are
working to divert our rush.
)eavons, obviously, is such a
man. He is not militant, anar
chistic, alienated, alienating or
bitter. As he says, "you don't
really need to change the sys
tem to live a better life."
leavons is just quietly pursuing
his work, doing what he can to
bring about an improvement in
the attitude of our culture.
