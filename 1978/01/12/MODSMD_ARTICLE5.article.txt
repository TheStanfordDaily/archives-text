# Common Ground : more than a garden
## 
### 
The headquarters of the Syn
tex Corporation is located
on a hillside just west of Footh
ill Expressway, across from
Palo Alto's Veterans Administ
ration Hospital. A large cement
and glass building in the mod
ern architectural style, it sits on
a very green and well-groomed
lawn. At the foot of the hill,
however, literally a stone's
throw away from the
chemical-pharmaceuticals bas
tion, an incongruous sight pre
sents itself: a truck garden, in
the best tradition of truck gar
dens. It is a disorderly collage
of colors and textures — the
lush green of crops and weeds,
the crumbling dark brown of
newly turned earth, the dry
light brown of withered vege
tation, the dusty white sheen
of sheet plastic, the hard lustre
less gray of metal siding.

A casual passerby, observing
the two establishments, would
be likely to see in their proxim
ity the tension which often
exists between the new and
dynamic and the old and static.
Palo Aito, he might surmise, is
in the final stages of a
metamorphosis from the pas
toral to the cosmopolitan; the
garden, a quaint anachronism,
will soon be the site of yet
another corporate headquar
ters and the cement and glass
building on the hillside will ac
quire, by comparison, an air of
establishment and seniority.

Such is not the case, how
ever. Quite to the contrary, the
cement and glass building
antedates the garden; the land
on which the garden is located
is owned by the corporation
and worked by the garden's
proprietors under the terms of
a rent-free lease; the operation
of the garden is partially sub
sidized, with virtually no return
obligations, by the corpora
tion's donation, in addition to
the land, of water and funds. It
is an unusual situation, but it is
an unusual truck garden.
Foods ranging from grains to
fruit to beans to vegetables are
under cultivation there. The
yield of any given foodstuff at
any given harvest time typically
ranges from two to 31 times the
national, California or Santa
Clara County average
(whichever is higher). From
one-half to one-sixteenth the
average amount of water per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. From one-half to
one-sixteenth the average
amount of nitrogen fertilizer
per pound of food produced is
typically used. About one
one-hundredth the energy per
pound of food produced is typ
ically used. No "chemical" fer
tilizer is used. Mo pesticides of
any type are used. No machin
ery more sophisticated than a
simple wheelbarrow is used.
And it is not uncommon to see
men and women in business
dress entering or leaving the
garden or engaged in some
phase of agriculture.
Despite these arresting facts,
the garden and its proprietors
remain surprisingly anonym
ous. Perhaps it is the
previously-described undis
tinguished character of the
former, or maybe it is the
quiet, unassuming style of the
latter. It may even be that it has
less to do with either the
former or latter than the nature
of the rest of the world. What
ever the case, it would be a
poor bet indeed to wager that
that anonymity is to be pre
served for very much longer.
Although I have been in
terested in food in general
and gardening in specific for
much of my life, the terms
"biodynamic" and "French in
tensive" remained obscure to
me until I made the acquain
tance of John leavons. An
alumnus of Yale and former
head of Business Services for
the Stanford library system,
leavons currently wields the

ponderous title of Director of
Agricultural Research for Ecol
ogy Action of the Midpenin
sula.
It is largely Jeavons who is
responsible for the present
shape — in both a physLal and
an abstract sense — of the ag
ricultural program underway
on the three and three-quarter
acre plot of Syntex land. It was
Jeavons who, after making a
study on his own initiative of
United Nations iand use and

population
figures, be
came con
vinced that
the planet
was still
capable of
feeding all
her in
habitants;
it was he
who, after
attending a
seminar on
the agricul
tural
techniques

synthesized by the Englishman
Alan Chadwick, sought out the
master horticulturalist in his
barren hillside-turned Garden
of Eden at the University of
California at Santa Cruz; it was
Jeavons who, after talking at
length with Chadwick, prop
osed the idea of a combined
research and community gar
den to the board of directors of
Ecology Action, a Palo Alto
conservation group which had
won recognition for a success
ful city-wide recycling prog-

ram; it was he who, after con
vincing them of the viability
and significance of such a
program, proceeded to as
semble the elements of Com
mon Ground — land, funds,
people — and embark on a
course of rigorous scientific
research.
The program is now in its
sixth year. Each succeeding
year has, according to Jeavons,
confirmed his faith in Chad
wick's techniques, known now
as the biodynamic-French in
tensive method.
When I first spoke with
leavons, I had a vague recollec
tion of a chapter in a gardening
book which had described a
"labor-intensive" system of
farming which allowed the
densely-populated countries
of western Europe to grow
much food on little land. This, I
imagined, was related to
"French-intensive" farming. In
his articulate and methodical
way, Jeavons soon clarified and
expanded this conception —
and made me realize how large
a topic this form of agriculture
had become.
"The method we're using
now," he said, "is made up of
two techniques that were de
veloped in Europe around the
turn of the century. The French
intensive method is one—that
reached its culmination in the
1890s outside Paris. What it did
was it raised vegetables in beds
that consisted of 18 inches of
horse manure — which was re
ally plentiful at the time. Be
cause of this high level of or
ganic matter and the fertility it
created, as well as the great
depth of loose material, roots
were able to grow downward
instead of needing room to
grow out horizontally. So they
were able to use very close
spacing."
This simple concept, leavons
continued, accounts for a sig
nificant part of the increased
yields which the method pro
duces. As jeavons phrased it in
a research report summarizing
Common Ground's first four
years, "A simple 24-inch deep
soil preparation allows the

plants to be spaced more
closely so that their leaves
touch or almost touch. . . .
This factor alone would make
fourfold yields possible be
cause four times as many
plants as usual can be planted
in a given area."
"The other technique,"
Jeavons told me, "was the
biodynamic technique. It was
developed in the 1920s by
Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian
genius who was into educa
tion, philosophy, religion, and
agriculture. The French inten
sive method had been de
veloped over hundreds of
years by French marchiers or
gardeners. The biodynamic
method, though, was de
veloped by Steiner in the late
'20s fora lot of wealthy German
farmers who had noticed that
their yields were going down
and they were getting more in
sect and disease problems. It
turned out they had been using
chemical fertilizers. Urea, a
kind of artifical nitrogen, had
been developed in the late
1880s. Steiner traced their
problems to the chemical fer
tilizers and suggested that they
return to some of their old
methods and adopt five special
practices. These practices be
camethe biodynamic method.
"One was the use of raised
beds — beds only 12 inches
deep prepared by raking soil
out of the path. This was going
back to the Greeks who found
out that plants grew better in
landslides. The raised beds as
they came to be dug were like
little, artificial landslides. The
reasons the plants do better in
them is because the soil is
looser and there's more air or
gases in it — you need up to 50
percent gases for good plant
growth."
jeavons frequently uses the
verb "dovetail" to describe
areas where two concepts in
termesh or compliment each
other. The deep soil prepara
tion and close spacing of the
French intensive method
dovetails, he said, with the "ar
tificial landslides" of the
biodynamic method to pro

duce healthier, more produc
tive plants.
"There was a study in the '50s
at the University of California
at Berkeley," he said, "that
showed that if you improved
root health by two to four per
cent for most common field
crops you could increase the
yields by 200 to 400 percent.
One of the things which can
make this possible is better soil
preparation and aeration. With
our method, you have more air
in the soil, more surface area
for contact between soil and air
since a raised bed has a curved
surface and also more surface
area to absorb rain or watering
and warmth from the sun. And
the curved surface also allows
you to increase the planting
area by 20 percent. Say you
have a plot of land that's a
hundred square feet and you
make it a raised bed, you can
wind up with 120 square feet of
planting area.
"The second technique that
Steiner recommended, after
the raised beds — which inci
dentally may even have gone
back even before the Greeks to
the Chinese, possibly 4000
years ago — was the use of or
ganic fertilizers. Chemical fer
tilizers at the time were mainly
just nitrogen or nitrogen and
phosphorous. They weren't
balanced or complete; they
needed trace minerals and
potash. Also the chemical fer
tilizers broke down very
quickly and harmed the texture
and structure of the soil and
killed the microbiotic life and

so forth. So Steiner asked the
German farmers to return to
organic fertilizers that were
more balanced and diverse —
like fish meal which has nitro
gen, phosphorous and trace
mi nerals and breaks down over
a period of six months instead
of four to six weeks.
"The third technique was
companion planting. There
were a lot of folk myths about
what things to grow well to
gether. Steiner tried to scienti
fically investigate this through
such techniques as
chromatography and crystalli
zation and field testing to de
termine which plants grown
together would do better. For
instance, one part chamomile
grown with two hundred parts
of wheat increases the health
and yield of wheat. But if its
one to one, one part
chamomile grown with one
part wheat, the wheat will be
destroyed, or at least seriously
harmed.
"Another technique was the
use of herbal sprays. At one
point they were almost a cult.
You take stinging nettles, for
example, and you do some
thing like — I can't remember
exactly — bury it three feet
under the ground at a certain
conjunction of the plants and
leave it under there for six
months and dig it up and mix it
in with a water solution and
then spray it on the ground. It's
supposed to stimulate the
micorobiotic life of the soil
which helps the plants. Really
far out, really unusual, but it
works.
"And the fifth thing was
planting by the phases of the
moon. The rationale for this
comes from seeing the moon's
effect on oceans — daily tides
of up to 40 feet in some parts of
the world. There's water in the
ground, in seeds and in plants
so it seems there might be a
small effect there.
"So those were the two
threads — the French intensive
method and Steiner's five
biodynamic techniques.
"Now, Chadwick, who is, I
think, a horticultural genius,

certainly a horticultural artist,
put these two techniques to
gether sometime between the
1930s and the 1960s when he
came to Santa Cruz. He had
been severely exasperated by
the second world war. A
woman named Freiavon Molka
and he got together and de
cided that one of the best ways
to bring peace and life and
harmony back into the world
was through gardens. Chad
wick had studied under the
French marchiers and he had
studied under Steiner. He's
had over 50 years of experience
in raising food. He also worked
under George Bernard Shaw in
drama, he's a painter, an actor,
an incredible individual — very
dramatic in his presentation of
things.
"When he put the two farm
ing techniques together, he
simplified them. Where
Steiner would make herbal
preparations, Chadwick would
just grow the herb, the stinging
nettle say, in the bed and then
put it in the compost pile and
let it have a living kind of influ
ence. Instead of using dead
mulches he used living mulch
— when the plants are so close
together that their leaves just
about touch, the ground is
shaded, moisture is con
served, a micro-climate is
created. So his whole orienta
tion is using living plants and
giving to nature as much as she
produces and even a little
more. If you give to nature
more than she gives you, she
will continually provide you
with abundance.
"So Chadwick prepares his
beds 24 inches deep, not just
18, he uses compost mainly
from vegetable matter, he uses
very little manure — in contrast
with the French and in contrast
with the other biodynamic
people who sometimes use a
lot of manure. This is important
worldwide because one-third
of the world's people now have
a different kind of energy
crisis: they don't have enough
firewood. So like in India,
they're burning the manure
from animals to heat their
homes and to cook their food.
There's a fertilizer shortage
there. But you don't need the
manure under Chadwick's
technique; most of it is veget
able compost, as I said.
"So he uses 24-inch-deep
soil preparation; close spac
ing; comparatively speaking, a
vegetarian or quasi-vegetarian
compost that's two-thirds veg
etable matter, one-third soil;
he uses living herbs rather than
herbal sprays, generally; he
uses some organic fertilizers,
mainly bone meal but not
much else; and he plants by
the phases of the moon."
/ / K| ow we started re-
searching the method
in 1972. Our purposes were
twofold. One was to document
how the method was done — it
had never been documented
in written form because Chad
wick doesn't believe in the
written word but by handing
things down by example and
by word of mouth, master to
apprentice and so forth. Also it
had been reputed that the
method produced four times
the average yield, but this had
never been documented one
way or another.
"The lot Syntex gave us had a
soil which was one-third rock
— meaning pebbles and stuff.
Normal agricultural soil is
maybe five percent rock, not 33
percent. In addition, our soil
was over one-third clay. There
was no nitrogen fertilizer in the
soil and just a trace of phos
phorous and potash.
"During our first five years
we got very encouraging re
sults — yields which ranged
anywhere from two to 16 times
the U.S., Santa Clara County or
California averages. Then in
1976, I developed a new
