# 'Peace, progress and well-being' in Paraguay
## 
### 
The casual visitor arriving in
Paraguay would probably first
notice the tropical vegetation
and relatively slow pace in the
small buffer nation between
Brazil and Argentina. He might
observe a certain peaceful
quality to life even in Asun
cion, the capital, but would
probably be unaware of the
tragedies behind its tranquil
surface.
A short time ago a number of
local papers, including the
Daily, followed the case of the
arbitrary arrest in Argentina of
my father, Epifanio Mendez
Fleitas, and my brother,
Epifanio Mendez Vail, both
Paraguayans who have lived in
exile for many years. They were
officially charged with mem
bership in an Argentine guer
rilla organization (the charges
have been dropped and they
are now free) but the apparent
impetus behind the case was a
request from General Alfredo
Stroessner, dictator of
Paraguay, that they be de
ported to their native land . This
act is consistent with the two

decade-long record of perse
cution of opposition leaders,
such as my father.
The reality experienced in
Paraguay contrasts profoundly
with that which the govern
ment attempts to fabricate for
internal and external con
sumption in presidential ad
dresses, official declarations
and the machinery of pro
government propaganda,
which is summed up in the
only poster seen on walls and
public buildings: "Peace,
progress, and well-being with
Stroessner." One can find this
displayed today in neon splen
dor, strategically located atop
the Central Bank of Paraguay.
Unfortunately the only
"peace" that exists today in
Paraguay is that of the silence
enforced by repression and
fear; the "progress" is re
served for those who are wil
ling to join in the general cor
ruption of the government,
many members of which are
well known figures in the il
legal traffic of drugs and other
forms of smuggling; and the

"well-being" can only refer to
that achieved by those who
"are well" with Stroessner.
A more accurate idea of
Paraguayan reality than can be
obtained during a short visit is
to be found in documents pre
pared by such agencies as Am
nesty International and the
U.S. State Department. (The
latter issued an analysis of
political repression in Paraguay
earlier this year.) The country
covers about the same area as
the state of California. The
majority of its 2.6 million in
habitants are engaged in ag
riculture. In spite of its insig
nificant size and high level of
underdevelopment it holds
one record of note: its dictator
has been in power longer than
iny other in Latin America.
Stroessner rose to power in a

1954 coup d'etat. Repression,
widespread poverty, corrup
tion at the governmental level
and the indiscriminant stifling
of all opposition have been the
constants of his regime. These
policies translate into the fol
lowing facts and figures:
Approximately one in every
325 adult males are in prison
for political reasons, according
to international estimates
which put the total number of
political prisoners at 2000.
The magnitude of the rep
ression is shown by the
ideological, social, and
economic variety of those who
are subject to arrests and per
secution. Among the victims
are priests, military personnel,
intellectuals, merchants, pro
fessionals, students, workers,
peasants, Catholics and mem

bers of all parties, including
the one in power. In the pris
ons there are women, children
and babies born in captivity.
There were and are prisoners
who have remained in jail foras
much as 19 years.
The constant exodus from
the country has sharpened in
recent years. A great number
of people have found it neces
sary to leave the country in
search of a better fortune in
neighboring lands, especially
Argentina. Today it is esti
mated that between 700,000
and 800,000, more than one
fourth the population of the
country, are living in exile for
economic and/or political
reasons.
