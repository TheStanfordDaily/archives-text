...as Michael Barry, Senior, who took Second Place in last year's Mattel
Design Competition, taking home a big $1,500! Michael came up with the
innovative "Gimbaloid", singling him out of the many Stanford Product
Design and Engineering students who competed in 1977 for over $C\ooo in
prize money as well as the recognition of the thriving toy industry for
their creative talents.
This year's competition is on NOW, with a final deadline for entry January
31st. For complete details, a full presentation will be made by Mattel in
the Main auditorium, Room 153, of Terman Engineering Center, January
12th, from 7:30 to 9:00 p.m.
You could be so creative!
