BE THE FIRST ON YOUR BLOCK
TO MTERVEW WITH DATA GENERAL.
It'd be a crime if you didn't. Because Data General is the third largest computer
company in the world in computer shipments.
After only nine years, we've installed over 44,500 systems - more than
Sperry-Univac, NCR, Control Data, and Raytheon combined. Last year alone, we
announced a new product every 15 working days. And shipped a new system every
16 minutes last time we checked. We even pump more revenues back into R&D
than any other computer company.
That's the kind of dynamic growth that spells opportunity for creative people
with degrees in EE, ME, CS or other technical disciplines. And we can prove it.
Ask us to tell you about the engineer who designed a computer at night
in his kitchen. And now heads up our North Carolina engineering research group.
Or about the 21-year old college grad who sold $1 million olus his first year out.
On commission!
Talk with Data General. We can help keep you straight.
