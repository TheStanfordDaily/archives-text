The National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) has given a go-ahead
for employee elections at the Stan
ford Hospital. Ballotting is set for
Feb. 2-4.
The NLRB had considered post
poning the February elections be
cause the United Stanford
Employees (USE) had filed unfair
labor practice charges against the
University.
Anne Schlagenhaft, USE presi
dent, said the claim involving an
employee opinion survey distributed
by the University "tried to ask
employees already in the union how
they felt about wages and working
conditions."
Unfair
She said this represented unfair
labor practice because the University
should have gone through USE
rather than question individual
employees.
However, Michael Taylor, director
of the NLRB's Region 32, said the dis
tribution of the survey would not af
fect the exercise of employee free
choice in such an election.
Gary Mecklenburg, hospital ad
ministrator, said the Medical Cent
er's administration agrees with the
decision.
"The administration continues to
believe employees should have the
opportunity to express their (union)
preference in the election," he said.
Secret ballot
Voting by secret ballot, employees
will decide whether or not they pre
fer USE as their exclusive bargaining
representative.
The Medical School has approxi
mately 260 USE members, said
Schlagenhaft. However, hospital
employees are not represented by
the union.
Similar elections were held in April
1975, and more than 1000 of the 1200
eligible employees voted to reject
any union representation.
After that election, the USE filed
separate unfair labor practice
charges and election objections,
which claimed that La Alianza Latina
and the Black Advisory Committee
were unlawfully assisted by the hos
pital.
These election objections were
settled last )une when the elections
were nullified and the University was
instructed to post messages saying
that it would treat USE like all other
organizations.
