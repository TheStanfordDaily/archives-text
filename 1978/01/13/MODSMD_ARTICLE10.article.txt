# Forty-ninth birthday honored
## Martin Luther King a rare individual

"Let us not wallow in the valley of
despair," pleaded the Rev. Martin
Luther King, )r. "I say to you today,
my friends, that in spite of the dif
ficulties and frustrations of the mo
ment, I still have a dream â€” I have a
dream that one day this nation will
rise up and live out the true meaning
of its creed: 'We hold these truths to
be self-evident, that all men are
created equal, . . "
The multitudes at the Lincoln
Memorial on August 28, 1963, a cen
tury after so-called black emancipa
tion, punctuated Dr. King's phrases
with roars of approval. Two hundred
thousand marchers had come to
Washington, D.C., that day as the
greatest assembly for redress of grie
vances that this nation has ever seen.
This rally marked the high point of
the civil rights movement that began
with the bus boycott in Montgomery,
Alabama, in 1954. Not only those in
Washington, but millions of Ameri
cans at home before their television
sets, heard Dr. King deliver his, "I
have a dream" appeal to the nation's
conscience.
On Sunday, January 15, black
people across the nation will pause
and reflect on what would have been

the forty-ninth birthday of Martin
Luther King, )r. In 1955, the
Montgomery bus boycott thrust
King, who was at that time a relatively
obscure 26-year old Baptist minister,
into the forefront of the civil rights
movement.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the
"gentle warrior," was the son of an
Atlanta preacher and a graduate of
Morehouse College, Crozer Semi
nary, and Boston University (Ph.D.
1955). King used the teachings of
Christianity and the methods of
Gandhi in his fight for civil rights. His
successes and failures earned him in
ternational fame and the Nobel
Peace Prize for 1964. He became the
second American black to win this
honor.
With the success of the Montgom
ery boycott and the rise of new black
nations in Africa,'beginning with
Ghana in 1957, blacks in America be
came more insistent on achieving
their rights. King and a group of
ministers organized the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference in
1957.
Dr. King became as revered a
leader as Frederick Douglass, inspir
ing millions with his Gandhi-like
phil osophy of nonviolence. He
pointed out that "nonviolent resis
tance is not a method for cowards; it
does resist." But he said, "It does not
seek to defeat or humiliate the op
ponent, but to win his friendship and
understanding." Dr. King urged his
followers to love their enemies, "to
accept blows . . . without striking
back," and to accept jailing for refus
ing to obey unjust laws because "un
earned suffering is redemptive" and
can bring about change.
Unfortunately King's pleas for fair
dealing had a hard time bearing fruit.
For those pleas, like those which
other blacks had echoed for the past
two centuries, generally fell among
the thorns of the national dedication
to white supremacy and were soon
choked by those racist thorns.
Though the nation listened, it did
not inwardly digest his words suffi
ciently. King himself realized that
what was needed was a national
commitment to stamp out every ves
tige of racism, to rectify past oppres
sion, to overcome the disadvantages
fostered by centuries of racism and
discrimination, and to transform his
dream of brotherhood into reality.
The failure of the American people
to undertake such an effort left the
nation tragically divided as the 1960s
ended, bringing to the fore voices far
more strident and tactics far less
peaceful than Dr. King's.
The nonviolence movement lost

much of its luster when Dr. King was
assassinated in April, 1968, while aid
ing striking sanitation workers in
Memphis. He was only 39. White
Americans in 1969 shuddered at the
prospects of racial guerrilla warfare.
But many were too comfortable with
the economic and social advantages
of being white to make the commit
ment to a total national effort to end
racism and exploitation and to over
come the ill effects of centuries of
slavery, discrimination, and pre
judice.
Though King's death brought
some gains to blacks and the poor,
for the most part these gains have
been token. After King was mur
dered, a few black people were let
into schools, a few black people got
better paying jobs, a few black
people achieved motion picture
stardom. So for a while a few people
have had a piece of the pie, so
everyone can now sit back and relax;
everyone is happy.
Or are they?
Since 1973, jobs and other "oppor
tunities" for blacks, nonwhites, and
women have steadily decreased.
Most recently, the cry of "reverse
racism" has echoed across the land.
In one case, a would-be student
named Allan Bakke sued the UC-
Davis Medical School after he was
denied admission for two successive
years. The California Supreme Court
promptly declared that the UC prog
ram to increase minority enrollment
was unconstitutional.
It is now clear that this case and
others like it will be used to attack
affirmative action programs in edu
cation and employment in California
and throughout the country.
Now, it took 200 years for white
America to face the issue of discrimi
nation against blacks and to establish
programs to deal with that issue. But
in only a few years, these programs
are now being attacked, and some
folks are even charging "reverse dis
crimination" and "reverse racism."
The sad fact is that despite King's
death and despite affirmative action
programs, the condition of the poor,
blacks and other minorities remain
little changed.
So where does that leave us? Why
do we celebrate King's birthday? We
honor King because he was a true
leader, possessing tremendous and
overwhelming verbal and mental
power, but more than that, he pos
sessed immeasurable wisdom, dedi
cation and compassion. Human be
ings such as this man are rare, to say
the least. We honor King because we
remember what he stood for; we
remember the nature of his com

mitment to human equality and jus
tice.
In remembering this, we knowthat
Dr. King did not die in vain. For there
may yet be hope. The final purpose
of King's life may be fulfilled through
the hearts and minds of many others.
Only time will tell if the confusion
and lack of commitment against ra
cism will end while there is still time
to turn chaos into community. Only
time will tell whether or not King's
dream can only be a fantasy or can be
made into reality in this country. For
now, we recognize Dr. King's birth
day and honor this rare human be
ing.
