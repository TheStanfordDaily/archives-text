Honor Code
It was with great dismay that we
saw the Faculty Senate reject a resol
ution that would affirm the faculty's
obligation to observe the Honor
Code. The resolution that was re
jected was parallel in wording to one
passed by the ASSU Senate and
stated that the faculty have an "obli
gation" to observe the Honor Code.
The resolution that was passed by
the Faculty Senate states that the fa
culty "affirms the principles" of the
Honor Code and that faculty should
"administer" it and provide "educa
tion" about the Code.
This wording was adopted because
the faculty members are not willing
to abide by the Code, or perhaps be
cause they are not familiar with its
contents. The Cole report, published
last year, revealed that a majority of
those faculty members surveyed did
not realize that proctoring was a vio
lation of the Code. Indeed, the sur
vey revealed that one-third of the fa
culty thought that proctoring was a
perfectly acceptable practice.
The Honor Code Commission was
created this year after the Student
Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC)
noted that the greatest difficulty in
keeping an Honor Code at Stanford

was that people were unfamiliar with
the Code, not that students cheated.
The role of the Commission would
be to educate the Stanford commun
ity on the Code and work to see that
it would once again become a work
ing part of the academic system.
The Commission soon realized
that faculty play a crucial role in the
operation of the Honor Code. Stu
dents are transient, and cannot pro
vide much continuity from year to
year. Also, faculty members have
specific obligations which are writ
ten into the Code. Though primary
responsibility for the preservation of
the Honor Code rests with the stu
dents, it cannot hope to remain a vi
able system without the encourage
ment and cooperation of the faculty.
The Honor Code is an important
symbol of academic freedom at Stan
ford. It has endured over the years
because students observed it and fa
culty members respected it. It is clear
that it is now in danger of dying, for it
takes a complete and unconditional
willingness to abide by the Code by
both the faculty and the students for
it to continue to work.
