# Western culture task force issues fourth statement on proposed requirement
## 
### 
Following is the text of the fourth statement by the task
force on the Western culture requirement. The individual
course proposals from faculty members mentioned in the
text appear in the current Campus Report. Copies are
available at News and Publications in the Press Courtyard off
Santa Teresa St.
Final proposals from the task force will be considered by
the Committee on Undergraduate Studies, whose recommen
dations then would be considered by the Faculty Senate.
Members of the task force are Profs. John Perry, philoso
phy; Nan Keohane, political science; Paul Seaver, history, and
Ron Rebholz, English; and students Andy Brown and John
Reider. -
Several aspects of the proposed requirement in Western
culture have prompted spirited discussion at Stanford in the
last few months. The impact of this requirement on existing
distribution requirements, the relationship between Western
culture courses and the study of non-Western culture, and the
funding of various alternative programs have attracted atten
tion. The single course proposed by the Task Force on
Western Culture in its preliminary report to the Committee
on Undergradaute Studies (Campus Report, November 30)
has stimulated argument about the merits of choice amonr
several courses versus a single course as ways of satisfying the
requirement.
Members of the Task Force have profited from conversa
tions about these issues with many faculty and students.
Discussions in the Committee on Undergraduate Studies and
the Academic Senate have helped us define our views.
However, before we formulate our final report to C-US, we
are seeking a more systematic indication of faculty opinion.
A questionnaire will be mailed out on January 12 to all
faculty engaged in undergraduate teaching. This statement is
intended to provide background for that survey; copies will
be mailed out with the questionnaire.
By means of this interim report we also hope to inform
the community more generally at the beginning of the final
quarter of our deliberations. Most of the report will be
devoted to the debate over the single course versus the
multiple-track option. We welcome your reactions to this
discussion and to other issues we raise more briefly at the end
of the report.
I. Reasons for requiring the study of Western culture
We believe that there are a number of reasons for
supporting a requirement in Western culture for undergradu
ates at Stanford.
Many of our students have little knowledge of the culture
of the Western world before their own brief conscious
lifetimes. They cannot recognize references to major his
torical trends in many areas of human experience, or to
outstanding works of the past and their creators. A writer for
a British newspaper, having recently visited and interviewed
our students at Cliveden, concluded that "the world between
the second Ice Age and John Fitzgerald Kennedy seems all
roughly the same to them." A student told a member of the
Philosophy Department last year that Descartes lived before
Jesus. The consequence of such lack of knowledge has been
the impoverishment of the intellectual horizons of our
undergraduates.
We are convinced that some acquaintance with a "range
of significant intellectual episodes," as one of our colleagues
put it recently, equips men and women to deal more
effectively with problems they and their societies encounter.
The study of Western culture should provide students with
central images and models developed by thinkers of the past
that will give them some understanding of the complex
dimensions of recurrent human dilemmas, and allow them to
express their own ideas more creatively and effectively.
A knowledge of some of the past events and inherited
ideas, values, and institutions that have helped shape our
society helps us understand ourselves. Such knowledge makes
it possible for students to appreciate Western culture as well
as to criticize it effectively. It also trains them to be
better-informed students of other cultures by giving them a
more sophisticated point of reference.
Understanding some -spects of the past that have not so
obviously shaped the present can expand our conception of
the possible, making us aware of alternatives to the contem
porary and the immediately applicable. Courses in Western
culture should surprise and intrigue students with the diversi
ty of the past, as well as induce occasional shocks of
recognition as the roots of the familiar are discovered there.
Western culture is not the sole property of some single
contemporary ethnic group. It is a rich and complex intellec
tual experience that is part of the heritage of all our students
in addition to any other that they may enjoy. An education
that fails to provide some fairly systematic study of this
heritage is not serving students well.
The education of Stanford undergraduates today does not
ensure such a study. None of the alternative ways that have
been suggested for dealing with this disturbing situation
seems to us so likely to be effective as a requirement in the
study of Western culture. Thus, although members of the
Task Force came to our discussions with a variety of opinions
on this matter, we have all come to agree that such a
requirement is desirable.
11. A single course to satisfy the requirement, or a choice
among several courses
We have discussed at length, among ourselves and with
others, two alternative ways of instituting such a require
ment: either all students take the same course, or students
choose among several courses approved by some individual or
group as suitable for satisfying the requirement.
The primary advantage of a single course is that it would
provide a shared intellectual experience for all participants.
The discussion of common material might bring new vitality
to student life. Working with colleagues from other disci
plines to design and teach such a course might enrich the
intellectual life of the faculty as well. Faculty could assume
students' knowledge of certain material and build on that
knowledge in subsequent courses.
An imaginative, carefully constructed course in Western
culture could become a distinctive feature of Stanford s
undergraduate life, attracting students and providing a speci
fic common focus for the energies of faculty concerned to
enhance the liberal education of undergraduates. It would be
easier to monitor the quality of such a course and to ensure
that it maintained a level of excellence that justified requiring
it, than it would be to supervise the teaching of many
different courses with an eye to deciding which ones met
standards of excellence and fitness.
The major argument against a single course is that it
sacrifices all the advantages that come with choice. Students
generally prefer to have alternatives available to thern; faculty
generally prefer to design their own courses rather than join
with a group of colleagues in designing a single course. Unless
large numbers of students and faculty were enthusiastic
about the single course, it could not succeed in its objectives.
A course that required a sizable number of regular
Stanford faculty to engage in general education rather than
teaching close to their areas of specialization would en
counter opposition from those who believe our talents are
better used as specialists. A single course for 1,600 students
would be difficult to organize, especially if avoiding very
large lectures whenever possible were a desideratum. Without
the spur of competition, a single course might become inert
and unimaginative. Without a strong departmental base, the
organizers of such a course might find it hard to obtain good
teachers.
The primary advantage of allowing choice among a num
ber of courses is that it would be possible to present a variety
of perspectives on Western culture according to the different
abilities and preferences of different faculty members, and
possible for students to select courses that suited their own
interests and preferences. Having a variety of courses in
competition for students and for the conferral of "approved
status" as ways of satisfying the requirement might en
courage innovation and help maintain high standards.
Some of the advantages of the single course could be
achieved under this plan if faculty cooperated across discipli
nary boundaries in designing courses. If it were determined,
on the other hand, that only courses with a departmental
base were likely to thrive, departments might be led to
compete among themselves, and the whole undergradus'q
curriculum might benefit from this experience.
The major argument against instituting alternative courses
is that it would be difficult to determine, and even more
difficult to apply systematically, criteria for selection among

different courses offered to satisfy the requirement. The task
of a supervisory group under this system would not be an
enviable one. Unless some fairly arbitrary upper limit were
set on the number of courses there would be a danger of an
unlimited proliferation like that which plagued the new
humanities sequences.
It would be harder to ensure standards of excellence were
met in a number of courses than in a single course. Yet unless
the courses satisfying the requirement were consistently
excellent, manageable in number, and well-designed to
achieve the purposes of the requirement, the requirement
would be difficult to justify.
These appear to us to be the most important arguments
on both sides of this issue of a single course versus multiple
tracks. Beyond this, of course, particular types of courses
have advantages and disadvantages of their own, both sub
stantive and procedural. We have found that it helps to
consider the merits and drawbacks of specific proposed
courses, as a way of obtaining perspective on the more
general issues that remain to be decided.
111. The single course favored by the Task Force
If the model of a single course is adopted, the Task Force
favors a particular kind of course. We have given a good deal
of thought to this course, and are clear about our own
priorities. We have also drawn up sample syllabi to provide a
sense for ourselves and others of what such a single course
might look like. These syllabi are available in full at the
reserve desk of the Undergraduate Library, and in the office
of the Dean of Humanities and Sciences, for those who
would like to consider the whole set of materials.
We think that all Stanford undergraduates should partici
pate in an intellectually active engagement with important
works of Western culture. The single course that we propose,
therefore, would be taught primarily in small seminar-style
classes. Lectures would supplement the sfeminars to provide
background and deal with special topics. We think that the
objectives of this requirement are more likely to be achieved
if the course is taught in small classes. Most Stanford students
with whom we have discussed the question agree strongly,
and educational research supports our view (see N.L. Gage
and D.C. Berliner, Educational Psychology, units 22-24.)
Since the quality of such a course would depend heavily
on its teachers, we propose that the seminars be taught by
regular members of the Stanford faculty whenever possible.
Emeriti professors could be recalled to help in teaching the
course, and instructors who have just received the Ph.D.
could be hired especially for this course, on the model of
History 1,2,3. One of the advantages of the plan, in our eyes,
is that it provides an opportunity for employing a corps of
skilled young faculty to do a specific job for a specific term.
The instructors would gain teaching experience, and Stanford
would have an infusion of young teaching staff in a number
of different departments. The core of the teaching faculty in
this course, however, should be members of the Stanford
professoriate; and the course would depend on the attractive
ness of such a teaching opportunity to an appropriate
number of our colleages.
We do not propose a course in "great books," but a
course in "great works." In our sample syllabi we have
provided for acquaintance with paintings, musical composi
tions, buildings, and machines, as well as the writings of
philosopheis, theologians, scientists, historians, poets, play
wrights, and novelists. At this point our syllabi are still
weighted heavily in the direction of books as such; we would
expect that groups of colleagues working together to design
this course would draw up a more balanced list. To us, one of
the most exciting and innovative features of the course is that
it does not rely on books alone, but introduces students to a
variety of products of Western culture. The purpose of the
course would be to make students aware of the temporal
relationship of these works to one another, and to under
stand some of the political, social, and economic contexts of
the works.
In a single course organized around a common list of
works taught in small classes, the seminar leaders could not
be specialists in all the material they teach. In a time of
increasing specialization, no single person or even any small
group of academics is likely to be expert in more than a very
small portion of Western culture. Any course in Western
culture, therefore, save one with a narrow disciplinary and
temporal base, will necessarily have to involve teaching
outside areas of special expertise. But we think that an
intelligent, educated, nonspecialist, with conscientious prepa
ration and a degree of enthusiasm about the adventure, can
help other intelligent people achieve serious understanding of
a work and some of its contexts. We assume that groups of
teachers working together could help one another in under
standing and teaching the works by sharing specialized
knowledge. And we would rely on lectures for conveying
factual material, contexts, complex connections between
works, and large-scale interpretations and syntheses.
In the limited amount of time we can reasonably expect
our students to devote to courses satisfying the require
ment—probably three five-unit courses, and no more than
four—no course could do justice to all aspects of Western
culture. Among the principles of selection used in designing
this course is the choice of works of "high" rather than
"popular" culture. Another is the decision to assign most
vvorks in their entirety, rather than rely on selections or
excerpts.
Particular periods in Western culture would be empha
sized, and groups of work* drawn from those periods would
be clustered together in the syllabus to provide a sense of the
complexity of some of the more important moments in the
development of Western culture. Although works would be
studied in some of their contexts, and some sense of
continuity over time would be provided, the course is not a
history course as such, and would not claim to acquaint
students with the discipline of the historian. These character
istics differentiate this course from the Western Civilization
course at Stanford which placed much more emphasis on
political and social history, used works of popular as well as
high culture, and often used excerpts rather than whole
works.
The course we propose would have the following proce
dural characteristics:
A. All students will study the same works and be ex
amined on them in the same examinations. The list of works
will be determined collectively by the teachers in the course.
Limited variations in the works and examinations may be
permitted to accommodate the special interests of the
teachers and students.
B. Each teacher will determine how he or she will present
the works in the course, what themes and relationships will
be emphasized, and what connections will be drawn among
the works. Groups of individuals may work together in
deciding how to present particular portions of the material,
but the basic decisions about how to teach it will be left to
each instructor.
C. Students will study the works and their contexts for
one year in three five-unit classes and be examined on them
at the end of each quarter. In so far as possible, examinations
in the second and third quarters will encourage students to
relate material studied earlier in the course to that studied
later. Students should be strongly encouraged to satisfy the
requirement in their freshman year.
D. Students will write at least ten to twelve pages per
quarter, distributed as the teachers see fit.
E. Regular members of the faculty will teach as many at
the classes as possible. While the values of continuity and
close relationships between the teacher and students will be
served if one person teaches all three quarters of the course,
it is unlikely that many regular members of the faculty will
be in a position to divert that much time from their other
teaching obligations. Teaching one or two quarters of the
course will therefore be acceptable and probably the norm.
F. Emeriti professors and postdoctoral instructors, the
latter appointed for fixed terms (for example, for three years
with the possibility of renewal for a further three years), will
teach classes not taught by regular faculty. The former will
be encouraged, the latter expected to teach all three quarters
of the course.
G. Twenty students in each class is an absolute maximum.
Every (eduction of class size from twenty in the direction of
twelve to fifteen improves the quality of the students' active
engagement with the works and the discussion of them with
others.

H. Each class will meet for two two-hour periods each
week. A lecture on Monday of each week will supplement the
knowledge of facts and contexts gained from secondary
texts, suggest broad connections between works and help fill
gaps between emphasized periods, clarify particularly diffi
cult works, and treat the kinds of works which may be more
fully illuminated with audiovisual aids not easily managed in
small classrooms.
I. An hour on Friday of each week will be kept open for
optional lectures on special subjects: for example, on the
ways in which works discussed in the classroom might be
approached from different disciplinary perspectives.
J. The course will be administered by a committee on the
Western Culture requirement appointed by the dean of
humanities and sciences in consultation with other relevant
deans and the Committee on Undergraduate Studies. The
Committee, always subject to the approval of the dean, will
be responsible for recruiting members of the faculty to teach
in the course, hiring instructors, and monitoring the quality
of the course. The Committee will ensure that all teachers in
the course are evaluated by the University's mechanisms for
evaluation of teachers.
K. The course will be tested in a pilot program for two
years before it is required of all students. In the first year of
the pilot program approximately 100 students will be invited
to volunteer to take the course; in the second year a larger
number will be invited. While the pilot program cannot test
the impact of a requirement per se on the students' percep
tions of the course, it can test the internal soundness of the
course and the responses of students to it.
L The following are examples of general outlines for each
of the three quarters of the proposed course. Reflecting the
interests of the persons who developed them, they differ in
character and format. In each case we have provided sample
lists of works and lecture topics for one three-week segment
tnat might be used in drawing up syllabi. These are merely
samples and in no way prescriptive; the actual teachers in the
course will determine outlines and lists of works.

IV. Criteria for deciding among courses for a multiple-track
requirement
In discussing a multitrack requirement that would permit
students to choose among several different sequences of
courses, the major difficulty we encountered was in drawing
up a set of criteria for determining what courses would be
included among sequences approved for satisfying the
requirement. Since the potential material for courses in
Western culture is so vast, it seems less arbitrary, paradoxical
ly enough, to consider the design of a single coherent course
than to determine satisfactory standards for deciding among
a large number of potentially attractive courses.
It could be that the diverse demands on faculty would
keep the number of serious proposals within reasonable
bounds. However, the number of courses that have already
been proposed to us, formally and informally, indicates that
it is probable that a decision to have a multitrack require
ment would spur members of a large number of departments
to submit a variety of proposals for new courses, and for
modifications of existing courses. Such a degree of interest
can be viewed as a heartening phenomenon by supporters of
the Western Culture requirement. But it underlines the
difficulties inherent in the problem of choice.
None of us is happy with the notion of an unlimited
number of courses in satisfaction of the requirement; it is
difficult, on the other hand, to decide upon a reasonable
upper limit. Some members of the Task Force feel that if we
cannot decide upon a single subject matter that it is essential
for our students to know, the requirement itself is pointless.
Other members accept the idea that there are many different
ways of achieving the purposes of the requirement and aie
thus attracted by the advantages of the multitrack model.
Unless the problem of choice can be satisfactorily dealt with,
however, the advantages of the single course appear to us to
outweigh those of the alternative.
We have tentatively agreed on the following criteria that
might be used to deal with this problem, and offer them to
help focus discussion of the multiple-track model. We believe
that any sequence of courses approved for the requirement
should have the following characteristics'.
A. It must include the study of a considerable number of
primary works.
B. It must deal with more than one national and linguistic
subculture; for example, a sequence treating only Britain and
the U.S.A. would not qualify.
C. It must cover at least three out of four temporal
periods—ancient, medieval, early modern, and modern.
D. It must not approach Western culture through courses
designed to introduce students to a single discipline; however,
this does not mean that faculty from more than one depart
ment would have to be involved in the sequence for it to
qualify.
E. If lectures are at the core of the courses the sequence
must also involve instruction in small groups for a minimum
of two hours each week.
F. Each regular member of the faculty involved in the
courses should teach one of these small classes or sections
during at least one quarter of the sequence.
G. Small classes or sections not taught by regular faculty
should be taught by an instructor with a Ph.D., and with
proven ability as a teacher.

The administration of this model would require a commit
tee like that described in 11 I.J. above. The committee would
publish its criteria, invite faculty members or departments to
propose sequences of courses, and determine which courses
would be taught. It would also recruit faculty members and
departments for courses that it thought promising. It would
collaborate with the faculty members and departments in
volved in each course in the hiring of teachers to supplement
the regular members of the faculty. Finally, it would monitor
the quality of the courses and suggest improvements.
V. Courses already proposed for the multicourse model
In response to our earlier reports we have received
suggestions for courses that might be considered in this
model. At the time the proponents made their proposals,
most of them were not aware of the criteria listed above, and
therefore several of the courses do not satisfy the criteria. In
most cases we think they could be adapted without great
difficulty. Indeed the suggested courses have themselves been
helpful to us in developing the criteria for qualification.
The following are some of the suggestions made thus far.
The descriptions of existing courses are very brief because
their content can be examined in Courses and Degrees.
Proposals for new sequences of courses are summarized; a full
description of several, written by the faculty proponents,
follows this article. We hope these will stimulate more
interest among faculty, either to participate in the design of
these proposals or to make further proposals.
A. Existing courses
1. Humanities 61, 62, 63. This sequence, organized by
Humanities Special Programs and staffed with professors and
teaching assistants from several departments, deals with the
period from the ancient world to the present in three
quarters. It emphasizes intellectual and literary history.
2. History 1,2,3. This sequence, organized and staffed by
the Department of History, deals with European history from
1500 to the present. It emphasizes political and social history
but treats some intellectual history as well.
3. The Program in Structured Liberal Education. This is
an interdisciplinary course for freshmen, offered for nine
units a quarter. It covers the Greeks, the Renaissance, and the
Scientific Revolution, and the Modern Era from Adam Smith
through Freud, in three quarters. It emphasizes primary
works in philosophy, literature, social thought, and the
philosophy of science. Regular faculty from several depart
ments are involved in teaching the course in addition to
specially appointed teaching assistants.
B. Proposals for new sequences
1. A proposed modification of History 1,2,3 would add a
course in the ancient world taught by the Classics Depart
ment, and a course in the middle ages (perhaps Medieval
Culture, History 65/ English 65) taught by members of the
Medieval Studies Program. Students would choose three of
five courses to fulfill the requirement.
2. A course on the interplay of technology with ideas and
social institutions during the last two millenia in the West,
taught by members of the Program in Values, Technology
and Society. The first quarter would treat the historical
experience through the eighteenth century; the second, the
growth of modern industrial societies through the early
twentieth century. The third quarter would deal with con
temporary technological society. (See proposal by Professor
Vincenti.)
3. A four-quarter course organizing material in terms of
central themes, one for each quarter, rather than proceeding
chronologically. The first quarter would treat conceptions of
the individual and human nature from the ancient world to
the present; the second, social thought and the origins of
states; the third. Western man's attitudes toward nature, and
the impact of major technological innovations. In the fourth
quarter the student would choose a course on the relation
ship of the West to either Africa, Latin America, or East Asia.
Theie course* would be developed by the relevant area
studies committees. (See proposal by Profs. Abernethy,
Kennedy, and Wirth.)
4. A course in modern thought, literature, and the arts,
devoting two quarters to the period from the Enlightenment
to the present. This course, highlighting the modern period,
would provide intensive treatment of the visual arts, music,
film, architecture, and the impact of technology and third
world cultures on the West. In addition students would
choose a one-quarter course in an earlier period, such as
Humanities 61 or 62, History 1 or 2. (See proposal by Prof.
Guerard.)
5. A proposed network of courses dealing with the ques
tion of how any given culture comes to terms with a parent
culture or cultures from which it derives, but from which it
feels compelled to establish its intellectual and artisitc in
dependence. These courses would be organized by disciplines,
and students would select one course in a different discipline
each quarter. A wide variety of permutations would be
possible, with courses offered by Art, Anthropology, Classics,
History, Philosophy, Religious Studies, and the various litera
ture departments, for example. Each student would gain
knowledge of various aspects of Western culture through a
coherent yet diverse chronological sequence of courses. (See
proposal by Prof. Evans.)
6. A sequence in political, social, and intellectual history
treating the ancient world, the middle ages, and the early
modern period in terms of what successive periods take from
their predecessors in Western culture, what they reject, and
the reasons for this screening process.
7. A sequence covering the development of philosophy,
political theory, and religious concepts from the Greeks to
the present, taught by members of the Departments of
Philosophy, Political Science, and Religious Studies. Co
herence and mutual influence among these ideas would be
emphasized instead of the more common disciplinary distinc
tions. Ideas about the nature of reality, the legitimacy of
government, attitudes towards authority and justice, the
problem of evil, and various concepts linking the individual,
the society, and the cosmos would be discussed, with read
ings from primary documents.
8. A set of courses on the evolution of scientific concepts,
emphasizing the interactions between scientific developments
and other aspects of society, and of intellectual history. Such
a course would be taught by members of the Philosophy
Department, various departments in the sciences and social
sciences, and new faculty in the history of science. This
would be an expansion of a course already offered in the
Department of Philosophy on "The Evolution of Scientific
Concepts" from the Renaissance to the eighteenth century
The courses are only a selection from among those
suggested to us. Others, drawing more heavily on the social
sciences, particularly anthropology, and on faculty in the
various area studies committees, have been mentioned more
informally. The course proposed by the Task Force might
itself be one of the options in a multitrack plan. If this
system is adopted we think it would be sensible for all
proposed courses to compete in a pilot program for a year or
two so that they can be tested, and decisions among them
can be more firmly based.
VI. Other issues to be deali with
The proposal by Prof. Abernethy and his associates
addresses itself, in its requirement of a fourth quarter
devoted to the study of the relationship between Western and
non-Western culture, to a problem that we have faced from
the beginning: the charge that a requirement in Western
culture is ethnocentric in character. Several aspects of this
contention have concerned us. O
Another aspect of the study of non-Western culture is the
desirability of becoming familiar with a culture not one's
own, for students raised in the West. There are good argu
ments for thinking this as important as the study of the West.
For those who have not been raised in the West, and expect
to spend their lives in other societies, some of the arguments
for requiring the study of Western culture are weakened,
although others may be made more prominent. All these
problems have concerned us; and several of us feel that a
study of non-Western culture, either as part of the Western
culture requirement, or as an additional requirement is
desirable, for its intrinsic value, and as a way of highlighting
distinctive characteristics of Western culture. However, v\«
have roached no agreement on this point.
