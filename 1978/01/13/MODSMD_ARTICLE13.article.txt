# 'Some of my best friends are lefties'
## 
### Jenny Smith 
What is it that Gerald Ford, Alexander
the Great, Judy Garland, Jimi Hendrix,
Babe Ruth, Michaelangelo, Kim Novak and
this author have in common? They are all
part of a greatly neglected minority. They
are all sinistral. No, that doesn't mean
bad; it means left-handed.
Lefties have been persecuted through
out history. Discrimination against lefties
began during the time of the Romans.
They created the left to right alphabet
which makes it hard for southpaws to write
without smudging the ink on the way.
Before the Romans, writing was fairly
nonpartisan. The Greeks alternated direc
tion, writing from left to right, then right to
left on the next line. The Chinese still write
up and down and the Egyptians wrote any
way they pleased.
Prejudice
The Romans also showed prejudice
against lefties in their language. Their
word for right was "dexter," while their
word for left was "sinister."
Today, Roget's Thesaurus shows a nega
tive attitude towards left-handedness,
which, it claims, is synonymous with
clumsiness, "awkward, backhanded,
heavy-handed." No wonder lefties are a
minority.
What makes a person prefer one hand to
the other? No one knows for sure, but
there are several theories. Some scientists
believe that the two hemispheres of the
brain may control different body func
tions. If the right hemisphere is dominant
in a person, chances are that person will
be left-handed. Conversely, many left
hemisphere dominant people are right
handed.
Creative or not, lefties continue to face

problems in situations that most right
handers take for granted. Scissors, for
example, are almost impossible for a lefty
to use. One Stanford student related the
trauma she suffered in kindergarten as a
lefty. "I flunked cutting because I was
left-handed," she said. "The scissors
never worked for me."
As this article was being written, the au
thor heard a radio disc jockey talking
about lefties. He said recent studies attri
bute mental illness in a number of children
to a change by parental force from left to
right-handedness.
Eric Masters, a freshman, narrowly mis
sed such a childhood experience. "My
grandmother tried to make me be right
handed, but I stuck up for my lefts," he said.
"I was very confused as a child. For a while
I didn't know which hand to use; I was
very clumsy." Masters is now on the Stan
ford track team.
Products for righties
Many commodities have been invented
solely for right-handed use. Manual can
openers are made so that the right hand
turns the handle. Frying pans with pouring
lips must be held with the right hand. Ice
cream scoopers are right-handed. All
stringed instruments are designed for
right-handers; lefties who play any of
these instruments must have them re
strung and play them upside-down. Spiral
notebooks are painfully right-handed.
Left-handed premeds always have spiral
marks on their writing hand.
For years, Stanford lefties have had to
put up with another kind of problem: try
ing to write efficiently on those tiny desks
attached to the right (wrong) side of a
number of classrooms and lecture halls.

Fortunately, something is now being
down to alleviate the problem.
According to Gene Kirshner, associate
director of planning, t all new buildings and
all classrooms that are being renovated
are going to accommodate Stanford lefties
who, it is estimated, make up about five to
10 per cent of all Stanford students.
Remedy
About 10 years ago, Kirshner said, his
office received a letter from "somebody
who was concerned" about the lack of
left-handed tablet arm chairs. Since then
the plans were made to remedy the situa
tion. "We try to be sensitive to these kinds
of things," he said.
In spite of the adverse conditions sur
rounding lefties, many are trying to raise
the world's consciousness in regards to
their uniqueness. Left-handed shops have
been established which stock such items
as left-handed scissors, ice cream scoop
ers, wrist watches, and music books for
left-handed guitarists. The Stanford
bookstore now carries left-handed spiral
notebooks, with the spiral on the right
side.
Some of the more militant lefty factions
want to start a lefty revolution. James T. de
Kay wrote "The Left-Handed Book," a
book for lefties in which he creates a left
handed manifesto. He tells lefties to buy
only left-handed commodities, such as
English cars, and typewriters which have
most of the important keys on the left side.
Although most lefties are not that ex
treme, they are beginning to feel their
existence as a minority. Maybe some day,
lefties will be recognized as the unique
people they are. After all, lefties have
rights, too.
