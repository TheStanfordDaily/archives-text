# Using color to create best image may be key to career success
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
What you have on your body
is almost as important as what
you have in your head when
being interviewed by a poten
tial employer, according to a
local adviser.
"I talked with a president of a
bank this fall and he told me
that when he hires, he's al
ready made up his mind within
the first five minutes someone
walks through the door," said
Sue McCollum, a color analyst.
Her private business in Palo
Alto helps persons create their
most flattering appearance
through the use of color, line
and design theory.
"We live in an image
oriented society. Everything —
even success — depends on
the image we make on other
people," said McCollum, a
mother of three.

"I ache for the students,
fresh from college, who have
the technical knowledge, the

expertise, yet walk into an in
terview where the employer
makes a decision even before
the student opens his mouth,"
she said.
What color analysis does is
take a person's personal color
ing and match it with com
plimentary wardrobe colors
that emphasize one's good fea
tures.
"Each of us has a different
and unique personal coloring
determined basically by hair,
skin and eye color, features
and body shape.
"To generalize, we take
what you already have going
foryou and tell you whatcolors
to wear. Some colors are
dynamite on you while others
make you look ill," McCollum
said.
Men, too
"Color harmony will en
hance who you are as a per
son," McCollum said. She has
taught classes at Canada Col
lege and plans to teach two

classes for women on her own
this quarter at Oak Creek
Clubhouse.
Colors are important for
men as well, she emphasized.
"There are really unwritten
codes for successful dressing.
For example, if a man wants a
credible look, he'll wear a
white shirt, a repped (striped)
tie and a dark suit. It's basically
a conservative look."
Cynthia Penrose, 38, was an
MBA student at University of
Santa Clara when she took
McCollum's class. She is now
an administrative assistant for a
science research firm.
"I used to stumble through
clothes racks. I had no sense of
style and was not confident
with what I was wearing. I re
lied on feedback from other
people instead of being able to
look frankly in a mirror and say
'This is not right for me.' "
"If you're a career or profes
sional woman you shouldn't
dress like a secretary. You

don't get promoted that way,"
Penrose said.
"In business, colors have to
be played down. I don't want
to look too fresh and lively so
that I distract a man from what I
am saying."
McCollum said women
should especially begin to act
as mentors to one another in
the business field.
"Most men who are success
ful have had a mentor — an
older man who's been in the
business for a while who can
show him the tricks of the
trade.
"Women don't tend to do
that. I don't know whether its
the nature of the beasts that we
are. Women should help other
women get their foot in the
business door," she said.
"The main thing is that if you
feel good about yourself, you
have a better self image. You
can concentrate on your work
instead of worrying about how
you look."

Cynthia Penrose, 38, was an
MBA student at University of
Santa Clara when she took
McCollum's class. She is now
an administrative assistant for a
science research firm.
"I used to stumble through
clothes racks. I had no sense of
style and was not confident
with what I was wearing. I re
lied on feedback from other
people instead of being able to
look frankly in a mirror and say
'This is not right for me.' "
"If you're a career or profes
sional woman you shouldn't
dress like a secretary. You

don't get promoted that way,"
Penrose said.
"In business, colors have to
be played down. I don't want
to look too fresh and lively so
that I distract a man from what I
am saying."
McCollum said women
should especially begin to act
as mentors to one another in
the business field.
"Most men who are success
ful have had a mentor — an
older man who's been in the
business for a while who can
show him the tricks of the
trade.
"Women don't tend to do
that. I don't know whether its
the nature of the beasts that we
are. Women should help other
women get their foot in the
business door," she said.
"The main thing is that if you
feel good about yourself, you
have a better self image. You
can concentrate on your work
instead of worrying about how
you look."

Color analyst Sue McCollum says the way you dress and the colors you use may mean the difference
between a job in the business world or a place on the unemployment line.
What you have on your body
is almost as important as what
you have in your head when
being interviewed by a poten
tial employer, according to a
local adviser.
"I talked with a president of a
bank this fall and he told me
that when he hires, he's al
ready made up his mind within
the first five minutes someone
walks through the door," said
Sue McCollum, a color analyst.
Her private business in Palo
Alto helps persons create their
most flattering appearance
through the use of color, line
and design theory.
"We live in an image
oriented society. Everything —
even success — depends on
the image we make on other
people," said McCollum, a
mother of three.
Snap judgment
"I ache for the students,
fresh from college, who have
the technical knowledge, the

expertise, yet walk into an in
terview where the employer
makes a decision even before
the student opens his mouth,"
she said.
What color analysis does is
take a person's personal color
ing and match it with com
plimentary wardrobe colors
that emphasize one's good fea
tures.
"Each of us has a different
and unique personal coloring
determined basically by hair,
skin and eye color, features
and body shape.
"To generalize, we take
what you already have going
foryou and tell you whatcolors
to wear. Some colors are
dynamite on you while others
make you look ill," McCollum
said.
Men, too
"Color harmony will en
hance who you are as a per
son," McCollum said. She has
taught classes at Canada Col
lege and plans to teach two

classes for women on her own
this quarter at Oak Creek
Clubhouse.
Colors are important for
men as well, she emphasized.
"There are really unwritten
codes for successful dressing.
For example, if a man wants a
credible look, he'll wear a
white shirt, a repped (striped)
tie and a dark suit. It's basically
a conservative look."
