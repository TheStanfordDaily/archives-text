### Doug Yoshida 
/4s a senior girl two quarters from gradua
tion, I am worried about achieving the
status of "Stanford Woman" through the
necessary "In-the-Quad-and-under-the
full-moon" fashion.
My fiance is a co-terminal student who
has not yet picked up his bachelor's de
gree. I'm hoping he qualifies as a "Senior
Man." He is eligible for undergraduate
housing, which technically makes him an
undergraduate. On this fact, I am banking
my endangered future. Please tell me I can
be fulfilled without breaking my engage
ment.

Well, since students who graduate in
three years are called "seniors," I guess
the number of years at Stanford is not a
determining factor. So, even if your fiance
has been here five years, as long as he
hasn't received his bachelor's degree, I
would think he qualifies as a "Senior
Man.'' Engagements have been broken for
less, so I hope this answer is satisfactory. If
not, I'm sure there are plenty of seniors
who would be happy to oblige you.
By the way, the next full moon is on
January 23, at 11:55 p.m.

The Stanford staff was requested to en
roll in the new Stanford Disability Plan be
cause it offered many advantages. The
monetary advantages to Stanford Univer
sity were not given. Could you please ob
tain from someone the estimated annual
savings, in dollars that Stanford anticipates
as a result of the staff switching to this
plan. I do not want a lot of flowery words,
just the number. I hope you are up to the

challenge.
-CR
That someone is Robert Beth, director of
Insurance Risk Management.
Here are the number he gave me: Under
the state plan, the Stanford staff paid out
about $800,000 a year, and received back
about $300,000 in benefits. The remaining
$500,000 was left with the state. Under the
Stanford plan, the staff pays out the same
amount, but would keep the $500,000. Of
the $500,000, $150,000 would be spent on
increased benefits for the faculty and staff,
$100,000 would be used to offset the cost
of sick leave and long-term benefits pay
ments, and the remaining $250,000 would
be kept in a reserve fund. By state law, this
reserve fund money must be used for be
nefits to the staff, (i.e. the Universiy can
not use it "to hire new professors.")
How long am I required to keep my draft
card? How long will I be available for draft
ing (assuming, for some awful reason, the
draft machine were to be cranked up
again?). Are young men still required to
register for the draft? My card was issued
on May 9, 1975 . . .
According to the Federal Information
Center in San Francisco, when the Selec
tive Service was abolished on January 27,
1976, all young men were assigned to
category 1-H. Men are no longer required
to register for the draft (because there is
none), and all the district offices of the
Selective Service have been closed down.
You are no longer required to keep your
draft card. If you want more information,
the only office left is in Washington D.C.,

and the number is (202) 724-0424.

The post office in White Plaza will accept
personal checks tor the purchase of
stamps, etc. There is also a post office
branch in the basement of the medical
center. Although they seem to do all the
things most post office branches do, they
will NOT accept checks for the purchase of
stamps. When asked why, they can't pro
vide any more of an answer than; "We
don't accept checks." Can you make some
sense out of this?
-SJ
The reason they don't accept checks is
twofold: (1) the branch is only a "contract
station," and (2) they have received some
bad checks in the past.
A "contract station," is authorized to
carry on all the normal business of a post
office, but none of the employees are offi
cial post office personnel. Station super
visor Ron Creamier' said that all of the
workers are hospital employees.
Initially, the station began accepting
personal checks, but when they received
some bad ones, the Post Office Account
ing Department instructed them not to
take any checks. It was felt that accepting
checks would be an unnecessary risk for a
mere contract station.
So if you want stamps, remember the
old slogan, "Cash and Carry."

the $500,000, $150,000 would be spent on
increased benefits for the faculty and staff,
$100,000 would be used to offset the cost
of sick leave and long-term benefits pay
ments, and the remaining $250,000 would
be kept in a reserve fund. By state law, this
reserve fund money must be used for be
nefits to the staff, (i.e. the Universiy can
not use it "to hire new professors.")
How long am I required to keep my draft
card? How long will I be available for draft
ing (assuming, for some awful reason, the
draft machine were to be cranked up
again?). Are young men still required to
register for the draft? My card was issued
on May 9, 1975 . . .
According to the Federal Information
Center in San Francisco, when the Selec
tive Service was abolished on January 27,
1976, all young men were assigned to
category 1-H. Men are no longer required
to register for the draft (because there is
none), and all the district offices of the
Selective Service have been closed down.
You are no longer required to keep your
draft card. If you want more information,
the only office left is in Washington D.C.,

The post office in White Plaza will accept
personal checks tor the purchase of
stamps, etc. There is also a post office
branch in the basement of the medical
center. Although they seem to do all the
things most post office branches do, they
will NOT accept checks for the purchase of
stamps. When asked why, they can't pro
vide any more of an answer than; "We
don't accept checks." Can you make some
sense out of this?
-SJ
The reason they don't accept checks is
twofold: (1) the branch is only a "contract
station," and (2) they have received some
bad checks in the past.
A "contract station," is authorized to
carry on all the normal business of a post
office, but none of the employees are offi
cial post office personnel. Station super
visor Ron Creamier' said that all of the
workers are hospital employees.
Initially, the station began accepting
personal checks, but when they received
some bad ones, the Post Office Account
ing Department instructed them not to
take any checks. It was felt that accepting
checks would be an unnecessary risk for a
mere contract station.
So if you want stamps, remember the
old slogan, "Cash and Carry."

/4s a senior girl two quarters from gradua
tion, I am worried about achieving the
status of "Stanford Woman" through the
necessary "In-the-Quad-and-under-the
full-moon" fashion.
My fiance is a co-terminal student who
has not yet picked up his bachelor's de
gree. I'm hoping he qualifies as a "Senior
Man." He is eligible for undergraduate
housing, which technically makes him an
undergraduate. On this fact, I am banking
my endangered future. Please tell me I can
be fulfilled without breaking my engage
ment.
-KT
Well, since students who graduate in
three years are called "seniors," I guess
the number of years at Stanford is not a
determining factor. So, even if your fiance
has been here five years, as long as he
hasn't received his bachelor's degree, I
would think he qualifies as a "Senior
Man.'' Engagements have been broken for
less, so I hope this answer is satisfactory. If
not, I'm sure there are plenty of seniors
who would be happy to oblige you.
By the way, the next full moon is on
January 23, at 11:55 p.m.
