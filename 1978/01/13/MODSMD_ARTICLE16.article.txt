# Storms, rising reservoirs indicate end to drought
## 
### 
(AP) — With eyes turned anxiously toward
skimpy water reserves, California officials
quietly concede the state's two-year drought —
as a weather phenomenon — is finished.
Wet Pacific storms troop steadily over the
state. Rivers and reservoirs are on the rise. The
Sierra sits under a thick mantle of fresh snow.
Many cities have ended or eased drought
mandated rationing. And growers look forward
to a near-normal irrigation season.
"In the sense of rain, yes, no one can doubt
the drought is over," Don Foley, a member of
Gov. Jerry Brown's Drought Emergency Task
Force, said.
Foley and other water experts were quick to
note, however, the past two record dry years
critically cut water reserves. They said drought
effects will haunt California indefinitely and cal
led for the campaign to conserve water to con
tinue.
In the San Joaquin Valley, farmers battled the
drought with wells — 20,000 drilled last year —
and drained underground water tables to
dangerously low levels.
And the state's 30 major reservoirs today hold
roughly half the normal water supply and even
less water than last year — the driest in Califor
nia's history.
But the good news is rain.
Another in a series of storms was expected to
move over the state today and unleash more rain
and snow, a forecast which has become com
mon in California since the fall.
"We are back to regular winter weather for
California," said Bill Hackel, a National Weather
Service meteorologist.
"It's like it always has been, at least before the
drought. A lot of clouds and a lot of rain.
"The pattern of the last two years is broken,"

he added. "And looking at a long weather re
cord there's no reason to believe we should be
back to dry again next year."
Added Mary Hill of the United States Geologi
cal Survey: "As far as we are concerned, as a
weather phenomenon the drought is over, but
the effects are not."
Season rainfall totals have surpassed normal
for most California points: At San Francisco In
ternational Airport, 10.31 inches have fallen to
date this season, compared to a normal of 9.62.
Elsewhere, Eureka, 19.15 this season compared
to a normal of 19.03; Fresno, 4.40 this year, 4.04
normal; Los Angeles, 9.22, 5.57 normal; Sac
ramento, 10.21, normal 7.70.
Foley said heavy snows Tuesday pushed the
all-important snowpack to just under 100 inches
— almost twice the usual amount for this date.
The snowpack is vital because spring melts are
counted on to refill reservoirs.
"With the rainfall and snow we've had and are
predicted to get in the future, we can fill most of
our reservoirs this year," said Bill Clark of the
state's Drought Information Center.
"However, its still questionable whether
some of the major reservoirs can be filled or not
by the end of the year," he said.
The cascade of rain and snow has prompted
several communities to cut back or drop ration
ing plans.
Officials worry that the improved water situa
tion won't prompt a flurry of water waste. Said
Foley: "Ourfearisthatit'shuman naturetolook
around and say, 'Hey, it's raining,' and then
forget the short showers and all about the con
servation ethic.
"It would be very easy for us to just slip back
into our old habits and go out and water the
sidewalk."

"In the sense of rain, yes, no one can doubt
the drought is over," Don Foley, a member of
Gov. Jerry Brown's Drought Emergency Task
Force, said.
Foley and other water experts were quick to
note, however, the past two record dry years
critically cut water reserves. They said drought
effects will haunt California indefinitely and cal
led for the campaign to conserve water to con
tinue.
In the San Joaquin Valley, farmers battled the
drought with wells — 20,000 drilled last year —
and drained underground water tables to
dangerously low levels.
And the state's 30 major reservoirs today hold
roughly half the normal water supply and even
less water than last year — the driest in Califor
nia's history.
But the good news is rain.
Another in a series of storms was expected to
move over the state today and unleash more rain
and snow, a forecast which has become com
mon in California since the fall.
"We are back to regular winter weather for
California," said Bill Hackel, a National Weather
Service meteorologist.
"It's like it always has been, at least before the
drought. A lot of clouds and a lot of rain.
"The pattern of the last two years is broken,"

he added. "And looking at a long weather re
cord there's no reason to believe we should be
back to dry again next year."
Added Mary Hill of the United States Geologi
cal Survey: "As far as we are concerned, as a
weather phenomenon the drought is over, but
the effects are not."
Season rainfall totals have surpassed normal
for most California points: At San Francisco In
ternational Airport, 10.31 inches have fallen to
date this season, compared to a normal of 9.62.
Elsewhere, Eureka, 19.15 this season compared
to a normal of 19.03; Fresno, 4.40 this year, 4.04
normal; Los Angeles, 9.22, 5.57 normal; Sac
ramento, 10.21, normal 7.70.
Foley said heavy snows Tuesday pushed the
all-important snowpack to just under 100 inches
— almost twice the usual amount for this date.
The snowpack is vital because spring melts are
counted on to refill reservoirs.
"With the rainfall and snow we've had and are
predicted to get in the future, we can fill most of
our reservoirs this year," said Bill Clark of the
state's Drought Information Center.
"However, its still questionable whether
some of the major reservoirs can be filled or not
by the end of the year," he said.
The cascade of rain and snow has prompted
several communities to cut back or drop ration
ing plans.
Officials worry that the improved water situa
tion won't prompt a flurry of water waste. Said
Foley: "Ourfearisthatit'shuman naturetolook
around and say, 'Hey, it's raining,' and then
forget the short showers and all about the con
servation ethic.
"It would be very easy for us to just slip back
into our old habits and go out and water the
sidewalk."
(AP) — With eyes turned anxiously toward
skimpy water reserves, California officials
quietly concede the state's two-year drought —
as a weather phenomenon — is finished.
Wet Pacific storms troop steadily over the
state. Rivers and reservoirs are on the rise. The
Sierra sits under a thick mantle of fresh snow.
Many cities have ended or eased drought
mandated rationing. And growers look forward
to a near-normal irrigation season.
