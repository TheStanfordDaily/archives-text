Gypsy Cellar
3151 Middlefield Road at sth
Avenue
Redwood City
Last month marked the first
anniversary of Jan and An
toinette Novak's Gypsy Cellar
and, as a restaurant goer, I wish
their restaurant many more
anniversaries to come. Adding
an unusual occidental alterna
tive to moderately priced local
ethnic restaurants, the Gypsy
Cellar specializes in the reg
ional cuisines of the former
Austro-Hungarian Empire, a
melange of Bohemian,
Czechoslovakian, Hungarian,
Austrian, Rumanian and
Yugoslavian dishes.
Owner Jan Novak, originally
from Bohemia, serenades
patrons with haunting Vien
nese tunes on his violin. As
gifted a violinist as he is re
stauranteur, Jan formerly
played with our metropolitan
symphony. The restaurant it
self is among the most beauti
fully decorated locally, with a
ceiling tented in a pink floral
print rectangularly reminiscent
of Michael Taylor's circular
fabric tent at Le Fleur de Lys in
San Francisco.
Chosing a Karl Kissel Pies
porter Goldtroepfchen from

Germany ($6.50) as an aperitif
was a choice that increased my
constantly rising opinion of
German wines from an admit
tedly ignorant, Francophile
bias. I had a delicious Tartar
steak ($2.25) as an appetizer
while my partner chose to diet,
though she did sample it and
pronounced it excellent. Hun
garian goulash soup followed
on the dinner which I felt was
as good as ever. My friend had
a salad which looked as delici
ous as she said.
Accompanying the entrees
was an excellent Bouchard
Pere & Fils Chateauneuf du
Pape ($8). My companion's
choice was a succulent
Shashlik-Enesce made with
choice pieces of beef on a
skewer mixed with green pep
pers, onions and mushrooms
and served with rice pilaf.
I chose Segedin goulash
made with cuts of pork, sour
cream and saurkraut and
served with spetzels rather
than potatoes. Both were
pleasingly varied. As we were
sampling our main course, we
listened to Richardo Albert
Peti's Spanish flamenco guitar
accompaniment. The Gypsy
Cellar enjoys occasional guest
artists such as Signor Peti who
perform to a dining public.

A la carte entrees at the
Gypsy Cellar range from $3.50
to $6.95 while dinners, which
include soup or salad, range
from $4.50 to $7.85.
Palachenka, a dessert of two
crepes suzette filled with ap
ricot preserve or cheese are an
appetizing final course to a
memorable evening.

Last month marked the first
anniversary of Jan and An
toinette Novak's Gypsy Cellar
and, as a restaurant goer, I wish
their restaurant many more
anniversaries to come. Adding
an unusual occidental alterna
tive to moderately priced local
ethnic restaurants, the Gypsy
Cellar specializes in the reg
ional cuisines of the former
Austro-Hungarian Empire, a
melange of Bohemian,
Czechoslovakian, Hungarian,
Austrian, Rumanian and
Yugoslavian dishes.
Owner Jan Novak, originally
from Bohemia, serenades
patrons with haunting Vien
nese tunes on his violin. As
gifted a violinist as he is re
stauranteur, Jan formerly
played with our metropolitan
symphony. The restaurant it
self is among the most beauti
fully decorated locally, with a
ceiling tented in a pink floral
print rectangularly reminiscent
of Michael Taylor's circular
fabric tent at Le Fleur de Lys in
San Francisco.
Chosing a Karl Kissel Pies
porter Goldtroepfchen from

Germany ($6.50) as an aperitif
was a choice that increased my
constantly rising opinion of
German wines from an admit
tedly ignorant, Francophile
bias. I had a delicious Tartar
steak ($2.25) as an appetizer
while my partner chose to diet,
though she did sample it and
pronounced it excellent. Hun
garian goulash soup followed
on the dinner which I felt was
as good as ever. My friend had
a salad which looked as delici
ous as she said.
Accompanying the entrees
was an excellent Bouchard
Pere & Fils Chateauneuf du
Pape ($8). My companion's
choice was a succulent
Shashlik-Enesce made with
choice pieces of beef on a
skewer mixed with green pep
pers, onions and mushrooms
and served with rice pilaf.
I chose Segedin goulash
made with cuts of pork, sour
cream and saurkraut and
served with spetzels rather
than potatoes. Both were
pleasingly varied. As we were
sampling our main course, we
listened to Richardo Albert
Peti's Spanish flamenco guitar
accompaniment. The Gypsy
Cellar enjoys occasional guest
artists such as Signor Peti who
perform to a dining public.

A la carte entrees at the
