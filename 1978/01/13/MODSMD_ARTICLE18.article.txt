# Menlo Park standout
## French success in special touches 
### 
Pear Williams
150 Middlefield Road
Menlo Park
Slivers of lemon at the bot
tom of each glass of water,
first-rate wine sauce for the
tournedo, and a host of other
small touches make Pear Wil
liams a standout among
reasonably priced French re
staurants.
Dinners at Pear Williams
come with soup and salad, and
range from $5.25 for the
Mousse aux Epinards to $9.75
for the Tournedo saute Mar
chand de Vins.
The list of entrees fills only
one page of a small menu, but
each offering is distinctive. The
list is augmented by a different
special each day. We tried the
special our night — French sole
with Hollandaise sauce.

The steak portion was am
ple, although the serving of
sole was a bit small. The Hol
landaise sauce tasted good,
but was quite thin.
All three vegetables — zuc
chini, cauliflower and to
matoes with cheese — were
skillfully prepared. The rice
which accompanied the fish
was moist and fluffy, also draw
ing high marks. The scalloped
potatoes with the steak were
the only weakness of the main
course.
The earlier courses stood up
well, too The soup, a cream of
watercress, was delicate and
seasoned in a subtle, approp
riate manner.
The salad used the dark
green outer leaves of a head of
lettuce, torn in accord with
true French manner. These re
ceived the proper amount of

an oil and vinegar dressing — a
surprise when so many re
staurants flood their salads
with dressing.
The desserts were ample and
respectable, although hardly
superb. The Pear Williams
($1.25), the specialty of the
house, turned out to be a half
pear, vanilla ice cream and
caramel sauce keeping overly
close company in a tiny bowl.
The intriguing mesh of tastes
worked on one bite, clashed
on the next.
La Dacquoise ($1.25) was a
meringue on raspberry ice
cream with strawberry cream
sauce. Unfortunately, the
meringue was the rock-hard
variety favored in the United
States, rather than the chewier
form found in France.
This was about the only
anachronism in a meal which

otherwise meticulously fol
lowed French forms.
The butter was served in a
small bowl, the proper way,
and certainly preferable to the
molded pats found at most re
staurants. The dark rye bread
was delightfully crusty and
chewy.
The decor was modest, with
wooden pillars in the middle of
the floor, and booths to sit in.
But although unpretentious, it
had an authentic air.
The service was exceptional.
Our waitress was extremely ef
ficient without ever being in
trusive.
In light of all this, we were
puzzled that the restaurant was
far from full at 7 p.m. on a
Saturday. But even the most
finicky diner should try Pear
Williams.

respectable, although hardly
superb. The Pear Williams
($1.25), the specialty of the
house, turned out to be a half
pear, vanilla ice cream and
caramel sauce keeping overly
close company in a tiny bowl.
The intriguing mesh of tastes
worked on one bite, clashed
on the next.
La Dacquoise ($1.25) was a
meringue on raspberry ice
cream with strawberry cream
sauce. Unfortunately, the
meringue was the rock-hard
variety favored in the United
States, rather than the chewier
form found in France.
This was about the only
anachronism in a meal which

otherwise meticulously fol
lowed French forms.
The butter was served in a
small bowl, the proper way,
and certainly preferable to the
molded pats found at most re
staurants. The dark rye bread
was delightfully crusty and
chewy.
The decor was modest, with
wooden pillars in the middle of
the floor, and booths to sit in.
But although unpretentious, it
had an authentic air.
The service was exceptional.
Our waitress was extremely ef
ficient without ever being in
trusive.
In light of all this, we were
puzzled that the restaurant was
far from full at 7 p.m. on a
Saturday. But even the most
finicky diner should try Pear
Williams.

Pear Williams
150 Middlefield Road
Menlo Park
Slivers of lemon at the bot
tom of each glass of water,
first-rate wine sauce for the
tournedo, and a host of other
small touches make Pear Wil
liams a standout among
reasonably priced French re
staurants.
Dinners at Pear Williams
come with soup and salad, and
range from $5.25 for the
Mousse aux Epinards to $9.75
for the Tournedo saute Mar
chand de Vins.
The list of entrees fills only
one page of a small menu, but
each offering is distinctive. The
list is augmented by a different
special each day. We tried the
special our night — French sole
with Hollandaise sauce.

The steak portion was am
ple, although the serving of
sole was a bit small. The Hol
landaise sauce tasted good,
but was quite thin.
All three vegetables — zuc
chini, cauliflower and to
matoes with cheese — were
skillfully prepared. The rice
which accompanied the fish
was moist and fluffy, also draw
ing high marks. The scalloped
potatoes with the steak were
the only weakness of the main
course.
The earlier courses stood up
well, too The soup, a cream of
watercress, was delicate and
seasoned in a subtle, approp
riate manner.
The salad used the dark
green outer leaves of a head of
lettuce, torn in accord with
true French manner. These re
ceived the proper amount of

an oil and vinegar dressing — a
surprise when so many re
staurants flood their salads
with dressing.
The desserts were ample and
respectable, although hardly
superb. The Pear Williams
