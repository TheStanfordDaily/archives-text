# Two agencies investigating research fraud allegation

Both the FBI and the National Insti
tutes of Health (NIH) have confirmed
their investigations into the alleged
research fraud on the part of Assoc.
Prof, of Surgery Zolton Lucas.
Lucas is suspected of telling NIH
he completed and submitted to pub
lishers a number of articles produced
under a University-received NIH
grant when he allegedly had not
done so.
"We do confirm the existence of
an investigation," said Joe Erran,
public relations spokesman at the FBI
office in San Francisco.
However, Erran refused to com
ment on the extent of the investiga
tion because the case is in progress.
Erran did add that the case files are
"very thick, as are most files concern
ing alleged fraud."
Investigation by the FBI was re
quested by the U.S. Attorney's office

in San Francisco last April. The case
was brought to the attention of the
U.S. Attorney by Assoc. Prof, of Car
diovascular Surgery Eugene Dong.
Lucas said through a spokesperson
that he has not been contacted by the
FBI. He refused to comment further.
Carol Price, University counsel
handling the Lucas case, also said she
has not been contacted by the
bureau.
The NIH contacted Clayton Rich,
dean of the Medical School, last
November and is awaiting the Uni
versity's response to its requests, ac
cording to Ralph Curens, superin
tendent auditor in the division of
management survey and review at
NIH.
Neither Curens nor Rich would say
what specific information was re
quested by the health institutes.
"It took a couple of months to get
all the information the NIH re

quested from us, and then it took
Lucas about a month to answer all
our questions and supply us with the
information we requested," Rich
said.
He added that the University is
now going over Lucas' responses to
the requested information and that
he "couldn't make a guess" as to
when the responses will be submit
ted to NIH.
"It is important that we have
adequate time to compile all the in
formation," Rich said.
He added that the process may be
delayed even further because "we
may wish to ask Lucas additional
questions."
Curens said the requests were sent
to the University rather than directly
to Lucas because the University is the
prime recipient of NIH grants.
Both Curens and Rich refused to
speculate on the possible criminal
proceedings which could be brought
against either Lucas or the University
if the professor is found guilty of
fraud while working under NIH
grants received by the University.
Rich said he did not see how the
University could be guilty of criminal
conduct since there was no criminal
intent.
John Schwartz, University counsel
for the Medical School, is out of town
and unavailable for comment.
The allegation that Lucas may have
committed fraud is apparently sup
ported by court testimony the pro
fessor gave in a civil suit filed by his
former associate.
