# Chinese food that's a little extra

China Lion
3345 El Camino
Palo Alto
For you oriental food lovers
who are not aware of the
plethora of Chinese restaur
ants in the mid-peninsula area
(at last count, there were se
venty eight between San Fran
cisco and San Jose, all located
on El Camino Real) the time to
begin your exploring is now.
A great place to begin is
China Lion. However, don't be
surprised if you are so satisfied
that you lose your desire to try
the many other Chinese re
staurants in our area.
Specializing mainly in the

Mandarin and Cantonese,
China Lion has a complete
menu, ranging from sweet and
sour pork ($2.95) to Szechwan
duck ($11.50). The menu also
boasts a sorted array of ap
petizers (their Chinese dumpl
ing, which they call "Pot
Sticks" are excellent
and highly recommended),
several types of soups (their
Won Ton soup, with its won
tons freshly cooked to order, is
also superb) and a wide variety
of pork, beef, seafood, fowl,
vegetable, chow mein and
combination dinners.
The Mushu Pork, which is a
pork filling wrapped in a light
doughy pancake, and often

thought of as a "Chinese bur
rito" is very good, and our wai
ter even pointed out that for
those who avoid pork, it is also
available in beef and chicken.
As a customer, you are first
given a chance to witness the
dexterity of the waiter as he
wraps the Mushu Pork for you,
but for your second ana third
helpings, you are on your own.
The Cashew Chicken is also a
must, though for those of you
wishing to try several different
items, two combination din
ners are available, one at $4.90
and another at $5.25.
The price of the average dish
is about $3.25, so with soup
and tip, you can probably fi
gure on about $6 a dinner.
For a Chinese restaurant, the
wine list is extensive, ranging
from half a carafe of Mondavi
Chablis, Burgundy or Rose for
$2, to a bottle of 1971 Lafite
Rothschild, at $80. The choice
is overwhelming.

And every so often, if your
waiter takes a liking to you, you
might even receive a com
plimentary half a carafe of the
house wine, as was our experi
ence.
Coupled with the tas'y
cuisine is a small, personal and
charming atmosphere. The
service is prompt and individu
ally tailored, and it does not
take much prompting to en
gage your waiter in conversa
tion about the history of their
cuisine.
There are also a few tables
outdoors which afford the op
portunity, if you are so in
clined, to mix a little traffic with
your meals, as the tahles over
look El Camino Real
The China Lion is open seven
days a week, from 11:30to9:30
Monday through Friday, and
until 10:30 on Friday and
Saturday. They also feature a
business lunch, served from
11:30-2:30 during the week, in

which, for only $2.25, a combi
nation of several different
items is served (i.e., Friday's
lunch consists of shredded
chicken salad or soup du jour,
fried chicken wings, luchee
pork, shrimp with assorted
vegetables, fried rice, fortune
cookies and tea.)
Having been open only a
year, and competing in a very
competitive market, the China
Lion seems to put out that little
bit extra which is often hard to
find. Reservations are ac
cepted, the vegetables are
freshly chosen every morning,
and for those of you who really
know your stuff, the menu is
available in Chinese.
For an authentic, tasty and
reasonably priced Chinese
meal served in a cozy, charm
ing and personal atmosphere,
the China Lion is the place to
go. I couldn't recommend it
more highly.
