Lansing, Mich. (AP) — A wife
who helps pay her husband's
way through college should
receive benefits for that effort
if the couple later divorces, the
Michigan Court of Appeals
says.
The court upheld an Oak
land County Circuit Court rul
ing which awarded Susan Moss
a $15,000 alimony settlement.
"This case presents the not
uncommon situation of a wife
who, having worked so that
her husband could obtain a

professional education, finds
herself left by the roadside be
fore the fruits of that education
can be harvested," the appeals
court said.
Moss worked as a guidance
counselor to earn money to
put her husband, Lee, through
medical school. He later
graduated and began a surgical
residency in Maryland.
But the Oakland County
court then granted the
couple's request for a divorce.
Both parties appealed the

lower court decision. Mrs.
Moss said the alimony sould be
raised to $60,000 for her con
tribution to her husband's de
gree. Moss claimed that
alimony should not have been
granted at all, because his
former wife earned more
money as a counselor than j
was making.
But the appeals court held
Tuesday that Moss' diploma
was the only asset the couple
had and that the lower court's
finding was fair.
