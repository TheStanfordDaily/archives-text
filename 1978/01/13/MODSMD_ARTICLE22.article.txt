# The 						comic that toppled Allende
## 
### Helen Nissenbaum 
A single comic book which was a chil
dren's supplement to a Chilean news
paper may have played a central role in the
overthrow of Salvador Allende's govern
ment in 1973, the author of the book told
an audience here.
Ariel Dorfman, a literary critic and pro
fessoratthe University of Amsterdam, said
the comic and the mass media in general
affected the "subconscious mobilization
of everyday life" of the Chilean people.
The comic, called "How to read Donald
Duck," appeared in serialized form and
told the story of a child hero, Mampato,
who helped the peaceful and industrious
people enslaved by a villainous ruler to
free themselves from tyranny.
The serial ran between May and Oc
tober of 1973. The coup which toppled
Allende occurred in September, and
Dorfman said there were "surprising
parallelisms between the history and the
comic."
Dorfman discounted a planned conspi
racy responsible for the comic, but
suggested that when reality is very prob
lematic it may emerge in media forms
which usually do not deal with society's

problems.
The comic reader identifies with the
"good" rebels in the story, Dorfman said,
and this leads the reader to then identify
with the opponents of Allende in Chile.
The comic thus projects an "interpreta
tion of what is happening every day." This
was the interpretation being pushed by
the right-wing military leaders who even
tually toppled the government, Dorfman
said.
It gave a "mythical representation of the
real battle," depicting it as "against the
tyranny of communism," he added.
Dorfman then broadened the subject
and spoke of the changes which have oc
curred since the "barbaric and repressive"
military regime has begun governing.
"Today there exists a cultural opposition
to the dictatorship," which is evident in
the literature, song and art, Dorfman said.
He added that a new mass culture
termed the "Clandestine Culture" is
emerging in Chile today and it is charac
terized by graffiti, rumor, slogans written
on banknotes and esoteric jokes.
In addition, the circulation of news is
affected, he said. Since professional re

porters are severely repressed the people
who were previously passive readers of
the news now "break the verticality of
news" by speaking out about themselves.
A counter-culture also emerges from
concentration camps where political pris
oners are held. This too, affects the mass
culture, he said.
Dorfman pointed out that today there
exists a "mass fight." He said he is hopeful
of its continuation, without implying phys
ical violence.
He spoke of the "spaces" within the
present regime through which this is pos
sible. He referred to the increase in use of
code and symbolism in literature and art.
He exhibited examples of tapestries made
by the wives of the poor and unemployed
or political prisoners which encode mes
sages of dissatisfaction. The diversity and
subtlety of these means make it virtually
impossible for the regime to prevent
them.
Dorfman sees prospects for future use
of comics and allegory against the milit
ary's regime in order to draw people to
focus on the myth that the regime is om
nipotent, and to the effectiveness of op
posing forces.

nipotent, and to the effectiveness of op
posing forces.
A single comic book which was a chil
dren's supplement to a Chilean news
paper may have played a central role in the
overthrow of Salvador Allende's govern
ment in 1973, the author of the book told
an audience here.
Ariel Dorfman, a literary critic and pro
fessoratthe University of Amsterdam, said
the comic and the mass media in general
affected the "subconscious mobilization
of everyday life" of the Chilean people.
The comic, called "How to read Donald
Duck," appeared in serialized form and
told the story of a child hero, Mampato,
who helped the peaceful and industrious
people enslaved by a villainous ruler to
free themselves from tyranny.
The serial ran between May and Oc
tober of 1973. The coup which toppled
Allende occurred in September, and
Dorfman said there were "surprising
parallelisms between the history and the
comic."
Dorfman discounted a planned conspi
racy responsible for the comic, but
suggested that when reality is very prob
lematic it may emerge in media forms
which usually do not deal with society's

problems.
The comic reader identifies with the
"good" rebels in the story, Dorfman said,
and this leads the reader to then identify
with the opponents of Allende in Chile.
The comic thus projects an "interpreta
tion of what is happening every day." This
was the interpretation being pushed by
the right-wing military leaders who even
tually toppled the government, Dorfman
said.
It gave a "mythical representation of the
real battle," depicting it as "against the
tyranny of communism," he added.
Dorfman then broadened the subject
and spoke of the changes which have oc
curred since the "barbaric and repressive"
military regime has begun governing.
"Today there exists a cultural opposition
to the dictatorship," which is evident in
the literature, song and art, Dorfman said.
He added that a new mass culture
termed the "Clandestine Culture" is
emerging in Chile today and it is charac
terized by graffiti, rumor, slogans written
on banknotes and esoteric jokes.
In addition, the circulation of news is
affected, he said. Since professional re

porters are severely repressed the people
who were previously passive readers of
the news now "break the verticality of
news" by speaking out about themselves.
A counter-culture also emerges from
concentration camps where political pris
oners are held. This too, affects the mass
culture, he said.
Dorfman pointed out that today there
exists a "mass fight." He said he is hopeful
of its continuation, without implying phys
ical violence.
He spoke of the "spaces" within the
present regime through which this is pos
sible. He referred to the increase in use of
code and symbolism in literature and art.
He exhibited examples of tapestries made
by the wives of the poor and unemployed
or political prisoners which encode mes
sages of dissatisfaction. The diversity and
subtlety of these means make it virtually
impossible for the regime to prevent
them.
Dorfman sees prospects for future use
of comics and allegory against the milit
ary's regime in order to draw people to
focus on the myth that the regime is om
nipotent, and to the effectiveness of op
posing forces.
