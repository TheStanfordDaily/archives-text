# Engineering class looks at soft energy
## 
### David Lampe 
Students here in "Engineer
ing Systems Design" (En
gineering 235) are studying the
feasibility of using "soft
energy" as a means for meet
ing America's future energy
needs.
Soft energy sources include
many alternatives to conven
tional centralized, or "hard"
energy sources such as nuclear
reactors and fossil-fueled elec
tric generating plants.
Devices such as solar collec
tors and windmills, which use
the inexhaustible resources of
the sun and wind and can read
ily be used in a local setting, are
called soft energy systems.
Work in the course is being
carried out as part of a contract
with the Argonne National
Laboratory in Batavia, 111.,
which is under contract to the
Department of Energy.
"Engineering Systems De
sign," a two-quarter course
beginning this winter, offers
experience in solving a major
multi-disciplinary problem.
Students from law, economics
and the social sciences, as well
as engineering, are carefully
selected to deal with legal,
economic social and technical
aspects of these complex prob
lems.
"The purpose of the course
is to give students actual ex
perience in applying theanalyt
ical techniques learned in their
required courses to solve a real
problem," said Electrical En
gineering Prof. Bruce Lusig
nan, the course supervisor.
Lusignan called the soft
energy research an "ideal topic

for this multidisciplinary ap
proach."
To study problems of de
veloping and converting to
new energy technology, stu
dents have been divided into
five teams, each headed by a
faculty member.
These teams will develop a
model of energy use in the Un
ited States, study the
technological developments
required, assess the environ
mental impact, outline the
economic effects and investi
gate the public's acceptance of
proposed changes in energy
use habits.
"Students are the only
people who can be objective
en masse" on an issue as sensi
tive as the energy crisis, Lusig
nan pointed out. They are not
swayed by the "dominant
economic interests" in the
energy business, he said.
In addition to the direct stu
dent and faculty participants,
there are two advisory boards
which will periodically review
progress of research.
The Faculty Advisory Panel,
composed of 22 faculty mem
bers representing a wide vari
ety of fields from business to
food research, will meet to
consult three times during the
coyrse.
There will also be an advisory
board drawn from outside the
University representing di
verse interest groups and
businesses including the
Friends of the Earth, the
California State Energy Com
mission, the Sierra Club,
Pacific Gas and Electric and var
ious manufacturing firms.

Past projects undertaken by
Engineering 235 students have
included the development of a
garbage conversion system for
Palo Alto, which is now under
active consideration by the
city, and a study of an alterna
tive energy source for Hawaii
based on sugarcane.
The most dramatic results to
date came from a project de
scribing how to use communi
cations satellites for television
broadcasting in the underde
veloped areas o f india, In
donesia and Brazil. The
methods now used in these

countries can be traced di
rectly back to this study.
Lusignan said this year's pro
ject "is the first one where
we've had people waiting for
our results." In the past, po
tentially interested people
were contacted after the pro
ject was well underway.
The contract from Argonne
began July 1,1977. From July to
August, the Institute for Energy
Studies at Stanford prepared a
preliminary report entitled "An
Overview Study of Soft Energy
Paths and Decentralized
Energy Systems in the United

States."
From October to January,
this year's Engineering 235
class was planned. The course
will last until June, and a final
report will be prepared next
summer.
The objective of the current
study is to design and assess the
paths which may be taken to
achieve various degrees of
energy decentralization in the
U.S. overthe nextsoyears, and
to identify the risks, con
straints and impacts resulting
from implementing the various
hard and soft energy alterna
tives.
Lusignan indicated that if the
findings of this study are favor
able to the adoption of soft
energy technology, they could
have a profound effect on
America's future energy pol
icy.
According to Ami McKinley,
engineering research associate
and project coordinator, "suc
cess depends on two things:
effective organization, and the
abilities and talents of the stu
dents and others involved, and
we've got both of these right
now."

rectly back to this study.
Lusignan said this year's pro
ject "is the first one where
we've had people waiting for
our results." In the past, po
tentially interested people
were contacted after the pro
ject was well underway.
The contract from Argonne
began July 1,1977. From July to
August, the Institute for Energy
Studies at Stanford prepared a
preliminary report entitled "An
Overview Study of Soft Energy
Paths and Decentralized
Energy Systems in the United

States."
From October to January,
this year's Engineering 235
class was planned. The course
will last until June, and a final
report will be prepared next
summer.
The objective of the current
study is to design and assess the
paths which may be taken to
achieve various degrees of
energy decentralization in the
U.S. overthe nextsoyears, and
to identify the risks, con
straints and impacts resulting
from implementing the various
hard and soft energy alterna
tives.
Lusignan indicated that if the
findings of this study are favor
able to the adoption of soft
energy technology, they could
have a profound effect on
America's future energy pol
icy.
According to Ami McKinley,
engineering research associate
and project coordinator, "suc
cess depends on two things:
effective organization, and the
abilities and talents of the stu
dents and others involved, and
we've got both of these right
now."
Students here in "Engineer
ing Systems Design" (En
gineering 235) are studying the
feasibility of using "soft
energy" as a means for meet
ing America's future energy
needs.
Soft energy sources include
many alternatives to conven
tional centralized, or "hard"
energy sources such as nuclear
reactors and fossil-fueled elec
tric generating plants.
Devices such as solar collec
tors and windmills, which use
the inexhaustible resources of
the sun and wind and can read
ily be used in a local setting, are
called soft energy systems.
Work in the course is being
carried out as part of a contract
with the Argonne National
Laboratory in Batavia, 111.,
which is under contract to the
Department of Energy.
"Engineering Systems De
sign," a two-quarter course
beginning this winter, offers
experience in solving a major
multi-disciplinary problem.
Students from law, economics
and the social sciences, as well
as engineering, are carefully
selected to deal with legal,
economic social and technical
aspects of these complex prob
lems.
"The purpose of the course
is to give students actual ex
perience in applying theanalyt
ical techniques learned in their
required courses to solve a real
problem," said Electrical En
gineering Prof. Bruce Lusig
nan, the course supervisor.
Lusignan called the soft
energy research an "ideal topic

for this multidisciplinary ap
proach."
To study problems of de
veloping and converting to
new energy technology, stu
dents have been divided into
five teams, each headed by a
faculty member.
These teams will develop a
model of energy use in the Un
ited States, study the
technological developments
required, assess the environ
mental impact, outline the
economic effects and investi
gate the public's acceptance of
proposed changes in energy
use habits.
"Students are the only
people who can be objective
en masse" on an issue as sensi
tive as the energy crisis, Lusig
nan pointed out. They are not
swayed by the "dominant
economic interests" in the
energy business, he said.
In addition to the direct stu
dent and faculty participants,
there are two advisory boards
which will periodically review
progress of research.
The Faculty Advisory Panel,
composed of 22 faculty mem
bers representing a wide vari
ety of fields from business to
food research, will meet to
consult three times during the
coyrse.
There will also be an advisory
board drawn from outside the
University representing di
verse interest groups and
businesses including the
Friends of the Earth, the
California State Energy Com
mission, the Sierra Club,
Pacific Gas and Electric and var
ious manufacturing firms.

Past projects undertaken by
Engineering 235 students have
included the development of a
garbage conversion system for
Palo Alto, which is now under
active consideration by the
city, and a study of an alterna
tive energy source for Hawaii
based on sugarcane.
The most dramatic results to
date came from a project de
scribing how to use communi
cations satellites for television
broadcasting in the underde
veloped areas o f india, In
donesia and Brazil. The
methods now used in these

countries can be traced di
rectly back to this study.
