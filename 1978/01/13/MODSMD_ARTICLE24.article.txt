Washington (AP) — Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
says the Soviet Union is at least indirectly financing some of the
terrorist training going on in Libya and Lebanon.
"Many of these terrorists are being trained in camps in Libya
and Lebanon by organizations that themselves are financed by
the Soviet Union," Kissinger said.
Previous accounts have pointed to oil-rich Libya as a staging
ground for terrorists. Libya's leader, Moammar Khadafy, is an
arch-foe of Israel and has ties to Palestinians opposed to the
lewish state.
While other accounts have noted that some violent Palestinian
elements are trained in and make their forays from Lebanon, this
is the first firm suggestion by a prominent western figure that the
terrorists have a common money base in the Soviet Union and the
Eastern European bloc.
"Somebody is clearly financing the training and the organiza
tion, and some of it is clearly coming from the communist world,"
Kissinger said.
While adding, "That doesn't mean the communist world is
planning all this," he said even terrorists not directly supported
by communists "benefit the communist parties."
He said both terrorism and communism have their roots in
alienation with the system.
