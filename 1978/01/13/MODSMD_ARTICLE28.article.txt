# Nuclear power plants may be banned in Calif.

### 
Sacramento (AP) — A major
ity of the state Energy Commis
sion says there's no proven
long-term way to store nuclear
wastes, and their position is
casting a shadow on nuclear
power in California.
If the three majority mem
bers don't change their minds
by Jan. 25, they could lead to an
indefinite ban on nuclear
power plant construction in
the state.
On that date, they could
strike a fatal blow to the San
Diego Gas & Electric Co.'s
proposed Sundesert plant near
the Arizona border, the first
nuclear proposal since 1976
when California enacted the
nation's toughest nuclear
safety laws.
R. Denis Richter, an SDG&E
vice president, said in an inter
view Wednesday that there
"seems to be a planned cam
paign to kill this Sundesert pro
ject," and it "does not portend
well for nuclear power in the
State of California."
The three majority members
reported their stance at a news
conference recently.
Chairman Richard Maullin
and member Gene Varanini
endorsed a report saying
radioactive wastes remain
dangerous for 250,000 years,
and no way has been found to
store them securely for that
long.
Member Ronald Doctor, in
the audience, endorsed the
report when questioned by re
porters^
Their position is crucial be
cause under the 1976 laws, new
nuclear power plants are ban
ned until the commission de
clares that the federal govern
ment has found a safe method
for permanently storing the
wastes.
But commission decisions
may be overruled by the legis
lature.
Said Varanini, who headed
the committee that wrote the
report: "Such a technology has
not been demonstrated and
. . . it is even questionable to
assume that one will be de
monstrated before the mid
-1980s."
"It is not prudent to con

tinue siting nuclear power
plants based on an optimistic
assumption that waste man
agement technologies to
handle nuclear waste will be
developed and scientifically
demonstrated."
The three commissioners re
fused to say how they would
vote jan. 25 on
adoption of the committee re
port, and on a proposal to
exempt Sundesert from the
nuclear laws.
The commission's five
members were appointed by
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr., who
has been increasingly reserved
about nuclear power.
