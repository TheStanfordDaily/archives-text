Washington (AP) — American
companies may be sued by
foreign nations for alleged an
titrust law violations, the Sup
reme Court said Wednesday in
a ruling that may carry substan
tial impactforU.S. consumers.
The court's 5-3 decision
cleared the way for a major an
titrust trial in Minnesota on
charges by India, Iran and the
Philippines that six major U.S.
drug firms conspired illegally
to hike the price of the antibio
tic tetracycline.
In writing for the court, Jus
tice Potter Stewart suggested
that the ruling may be a boon
to consumers. "If potential an
titrust violators must take into
account the full costs of their
conduct, American consumers
are benefited by the maximum
deterrent effect of treble dam
ages upon all potential vio
lators," he said.
He noted that if the court
had deprived foreign nations
from filing such lawsuits, il
legal conspiracies could be en
couraged — "raising
worldwide prices and thus
contributing to American infla
tion."
Also, the court's opinion
suggested in a footnote, allow
ing such suits "might undercut
monopoly prices in this coun
try."
