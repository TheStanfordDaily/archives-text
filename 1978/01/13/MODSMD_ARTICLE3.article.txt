# Stanford places 75%
## Surveys reveal fewer jobs for Ph.D.s

Persons receiving Ph.D.s from the
University later find jobs relevant to
their educational background, but a
nationwide survey indicates that the
future job market for doctoral de
gree holders in the humanities looks
grim.
A survey released by the office of
Graduate Dean W. Bliss Carnochan
shows that three out of four students
receiving their Ph.D. at Stanford dur
ing 1976-77 had been able to find jobs
relevant to their educational
background.
Of the 449 Ph.D.s surveyed, 139
were found to be faculty members in
U.S. colleges and universities, 92 are
in business or industrial positions
and 46 are employed in government
or in non-profit institutions.
The remaining graduates have re
ceived temporary appointments as
post-doctoral fellows or research as
sociates, are in military service or
professional school or are foreign
and U.S. nationals who left the Un
ited States.
Only 3.6 percent of all those sur
veyed were actually unemployed.
The status of 3.1 percent of those
surveyed was unknown to their de
partment; some in this category may

have been looking for employment
However, a national survey con
ducted by the Higher Education Re
search Institute (HERD of Los Angeles
shows that there will be a drastic de
cline in job opportunities for
humanities doctoral graduates by
1993.
In the past, most jobs for doctorate
holders have been found in college
teaching. Because of the declining
birth rate and lower college enroll
ment, these job openings will de
crease by 70 percent in 15 years, ac
cording to Ernest May, chairman of
the history department at Harvard
and Dorothy Harrison, coordinator
of the doctoral project in the New
York State Education Department,
principal investigators in the national
study.
According to an article published
in the New York Times last
November, Harrison and May both
feel that "serious obstacles" have
kept Ph.D. graduates from breaking
into the lucrative fields of business
and industry.
"Many professors are prejudiced
against what they term corruption in
big business. But the Ph.D.'s them
selves are viewed with contempt by
business leaders who tend to classify

them as ivory-tower dwellers, as
people who cannot perform, who
cannot meet deadlines.
"Of course, both are wrong," said
Harrison in the Times article.
Carnochan said he felt the Univer
sity "will continue to do better than
most or many" in preparing its doc
toral students for careers, but "there
is no doubt that things will be getting
more difficult."

"Clearly there are still going to be
jobs, and the best people will get
them," said Carnochan. Those doc
toral graduates who are "superbly
qualified" will always be able to find
employment, according to the dean.
Those accepted in the University's
Ph.D. program are now being pro
vided with information concerning
the national job outlook as well as
the employment records of recent
University graduates.
