# Visiting British prof says England not collapsing

"60 Minutes seems determined that Britain is
about to suffer either a Bolshevik revolution or a
Nazi takeover in the manner of 1933," said An
thony King, professor of government at the Uni
versity of Essex and political writer for the Lon
don Observer, in a speech on Britain recently.
"There could be no greater nonsense," King
told an audience of about 60 at the Bechtel In
ternational Center.
Countering recent reports in the American
media on the strength of left- and right-wing
extremism in Britain, King quoted percentages
of the vote obtained by Communists in the
30-odd stronghold seats they contested in the
last three general elections. In 1970, they got 1.2
per cent. In February and October 1974,1.8 and
1.4 per cent respectively, he said.
"Now you simply cannot persuade me that a
political party that cannot do better than that is
about to take over the country," concluded
King.
Right-wing support
King suggested that support for the right-wing
racist party, the National Front, springs both
from a dislike of colored immigrants in Britain
and from dislike of the two main political par
ties.
"For some of these people, the National Front
is a haven, a place they can go to," King said.
However, the National Front has also failed to
make a strong showing in elections, according
to King. For the Oct. 1974 election he quoted a
figure of 3.1 per cent of the total vote in seats
contested.
King said that disaffection with the two main
parties is also a reason for the sharp rise in votes
for the Scottish National Party in Scotland.
"It's extremely difficult to predict the future,"
said King. "I don't myself think Scotland will
become independent."
There is currently a bill before the British Par
liament to give more local control to Scotland
and Wales through regional assemblies in Edin
burgh and Cardiff. King said he thought the
British government hoped passage of this bill
would reduce enthusiasm for an independent
Scottish nation.
Discussing other parts of the United King
dom, King stressed the extent to which North
ern Ireland is "an isolable, separate problem,
with no connection to Britain's other prob
lems."
' "A measure of how isolable the problem is in
the way British people talk about it," said King.
"They regard it as nothing to do with them.
Northern Ireland could be towed out into the
middle of the Atlantic and sunk, and that would
be alright by them."
Government committed
Yet the British government is committed to
interfering in Northern Ireland's affairs. King
said this commitment was based largely on "the

embarrassing fact that the majority of citizens in
Northern Ireland do not wish to be part of the
Republic."
Another reason for the presence of the British
army in Ulster, King said, was the fear that vio
lence might escalate if the troops were with
drawn. The violence might then spread to two
British cities, Liverpool and Glasgow, which
both have large Northern Irish Catholic and Pro
testant populations.
At present, violence in Northern Ireland is
decreasing. King said that the number of killings
there in 1977 was one-third of the 1976 total.
Serious discussion of Britain's problems was
relieved by lighter remarks. Talking of the im
pact of North Sea oil on the British economy,
King jibed: "Britain will be an exporter of pet
roleum products, and is threatening to join
OPEC."
The audience laughed, but King reminded
them to take note of the importance of North
Sea oil.
"Britain's 1978 surplus will be bigger than the
West German," he said. "For at least the next 10
to 12 years, Britain can count on an enormous
balance of payments surplus."
Questioned about trade union power in in
dustry, King said he thought the great inflation
of 1974-75 had caused a change in the tactics and
politics of British trade unionists.
"Until 1975," said King, "British trade unions
regarded capitalism, government, employers as
alien, distant nothing to do with them."
He said he thought that in 1975 inflation had
forced trade unionists to realize that pushing up
wage settlements was having a bad effect "not
only on something out there, an abstraction cal
led the economy, but on themselves, their
members."
Another question focused on the number and
influence of oil-rich Arabs in London.
"Arabs are buying real estate in London and
banks in Georgia," King replied. "It doesn't
worry me; they can't take them away."
Favorite sight
He said one of his favorite sights in London is
Arab ladies buying literally hundreds of gar
ments at Marks and Spencer, a leading British
department store.
"It's funny," King said," because Marks and
Spencers is owned and operated by one of the
most strongly Zionist families in British Jewry."
King said he thought the only worry in having
Arabs in England, and especially in London, was
that they might bring the violence of the Middle
East to the capital. In fact, there have been three
murders of Arabs in London in the last 10 days.
But that is not about to cause the demise of
the whole country. Indeed, King painted a rosy
picture overall.
"The question I set myself," he said, "is, is
Britain about to collapse? The answer is No."

"The question I set myself," he said, "is, is
Britain about to collapse? The answer is No."
"60 Minutes seems determined that Britain is
about to suffer either a Bolshevik revolution or a
Nazi takeover in the manner of 1933," said An
thony King, professor of government at the Uni
versity of Essex and political writer for the Lon
don Observer, in a speech on Britain recently.
"There could be no greater nonsense," King
told an audience of about 60 at the Bechtel In
ternational Center.
Countering recent reports in the American
media on the strength of left- and right-wing
extremism in Britain, King quoted percentages
of the vote obtained by Communists in the
30-odd stronghold seats they contested in the
last three general elections. In 1970, they got 1.2
per cent. In February and October 1974,1.8 and
1.4 per cent respectively, he said.
"Now you simply cannot persuade me that a
political party that cannot do better than that is
about to take over the country," concluded
King.
Right-wing support
King suggested that support for the right-wing
racist party, the National Front, springs both
from a dislike of colored immigrants in Britain
and from dislike of the two main political par
ties.
"For some of these people, the National Front
is a haven, a place they can go to," King said.
However, the National Front has also failed to
make a strong showing in elections, according
to King. For the Oct. 1974 election he quoted a
figure of 3.1 per cent of the total vote in seats
contested.
King said that disaffection with the two main
parties is also a reason for the sharp rise in votes
for the Scottish National Party in Scotland.
"It's extremely difficult to predict the future,"
said King. "I don't myself think Scotland will
become independent."
There is currently a bill before the British Par
liament to give more local control to Scotland
and Wales through regional assemblies in Edin
burgh and Cardiff. King said he thought the
British government hoped passage of this bill
would reduce enthusiasm for an independent
Scottish nation.
Discussing other parts of the United King
dom, King stressed the extent to which North
ern Ireland is "an isolable, separate problem,
with no connection to Britain's other prob
lems."
' "A measure of how isolable the problem is in
the way British people talk about it," said King.
"They regard it as nothing to do with them.
Northern Ireland could be towed out into the
middle of the Atlantic and sunk, and that would
be alright by them."
Government committed
Yet the British government is committed to
interfering in Northern Ireland's affairs. King
said this commitment was based largely on "the

embarrassing fact that the majority of citizens in
Northern Ireland do not wish to be part of the
Republic."
Another reason for the presence of the British
army in Ulster, King said, was the fear that vio
lence might escalate if the troops were with
drawn. The violence might then spread to two
British cities, Liverpool and Glasgow, which
both have large Northern Irish Catholic and Pro
testant populations.
At present, violence in Northern Ireland is
decreasing. King said that the number of killings
there in 1977 was one-third of the 1976 total.
Serious discussion of Britain's problems was
relieved by lighter remarks. Talking of the im
pact of North Sea oil on the British economy,
King jibed: "Britain will be an exporter of pet
roleum products, and is threatening to join
OPEC."
The audience laughed, but King reminded
them to take note of the importance of North
Sea oil.
"Britain's 1978 surplus will be bigger than the
West German," he said. "For at least the next 10
to 12 years, Britain can count on an enormous
balance of payments surplus."
Questioned about trade union power in in
dustry, King said he thought the great inflation
of 1974-75 had caused a change in the tactics and
politics of British trade unionists.
"Until 1975," said King, "British trade unions
regarded capitalism, government, employers as
alien, distant nothing to do with them."
He said he thought that in 1975 inflation had
forced trade unionists to realize that pushing up
wage settlements was having a bad effect "not
only on something out there, an abstraction cal
led the economy, but on themselves, their
members."
Another question focused on the number and
influence of oil-rich Arabs in London.
"Arabs are buying real estate in London and
banks in Georgia," King replied. "It doesn't
worry me; they can't take them away."
Favorite sight
He said one of his favorite sights in London is
Arab ladies buying literally hundreds of gar
ments at Marks and Spencer, a leading British
department store.
"It's funny," King said," because Marks and
Spencers is owned and operated by one of the
most strongly Zionist families in British Jewry."
King said he thought the only worry in having
Arabs in England, and especially in London, was
that they might bring the violence of the Middle
East to the capital. In fact, there have been three
murders of Arabs in London in the last 10 days.
But that is not about to cause the demise of
the whole country. Indeed, King painted a rosy
picture overall.

Britain about to collapse? The answer is No."

the whole country. Indeed, King painted a rosy
picture overall.
"The question I set myself," he said, "is, is
Britain about to collapse? The answer is No."
"60 Minutes seems determined that Britain is
about to suffer either a Bolshevik revolution or a
Nazi takeover in the manner of 1933," said An
thony King, professor of government at the Uni
versity of Essex and political writer for the Lon
don Observer, in a speech on Britain recently.
"There could be no greater nonsense," King
told an audience of about 60 at the Bechtel In
ternational Center.
Countering recent reports in the American
media on the strength of left- and right-wing
extremism in Britain, King quoted percentages
of the vote obtained by Communists in the
30-odd stronghold seats they contested in the
last three general elections. In 1970, they got 1.2
per cent. In February and October 1974,1.8 and
1.4 per cent respectively, he said.
"Now you simply cannot persuade me that a
political party that cannot do better than that is
about to take over the country," concluded
King.
Right-wing support
King suggested that support for the right-wing
racist party, the National Front, springs both
from a dislike of colored immigrants in Britain
and from dislike of the two main political par
ties.
"For some of these people, the National Front
is a haven, a place they can go to," King said.
However, the National Front has also failed to
make a strong showing in elections, according
to King. For the Oct. 1974 election he quoted a
figure of 3.1 per cent of the total vote in seats
contested.
King said that disaffection with the two main
parties is also a reason for the sharp rise in votes
for the Scottish National Party in Scotland.
"It's extremely difficult to predict the future,"
said King. "I don't myself think Scotland will
become independent."
There is currently a bill before the British Par
liament to give more local control to Scotland
and Wales through regional assemblies in Edin
burgh and Cardiff. King said he thought the
British government hoped passage of this bill
would reduce enthusiasm for an independent
Scottish nation.
Discussing other parts of the United King
dom, King stressed the extent to which North
ern Ireland is "an isolable, separate problem,
with no connection to Britain's other prob
lems."
' "A measure of how isolable the problem is in
the way British people talk about it," said King.
"They regard it as nothing to do with them.
Northern Ireland could be towed out into the
middle of the Atlantic and sunk, and that would
be alright by them."
Government committed
Yet the British government is committed to
interfering in Northern Ireland's affairs. King
said this commitment was based largely on "the

embarrassing fact that the majority of citizens in
Northern Ireland do not wish to be part of the
Republic."
Another reason for the presence of the British
army in Ulster, King said, was the fear that vio
lence might escalate if the troops were with
drawn. The violence might then spread to two
British cities, Liverpool and Glasgow, which
both have large Northern Irish Catholic and Pro
testant populations.
At present, violence in Northern Ireland is
decreasing. King said that the number of killings
there in 1977 was one-third of the 1976 total.
Serious discussion of Britain's problems was
relieved by lighter remarks. Talking of the im
pact of North Sea oil on the British economy,
King jibed: "Britain will be an exporter of pet
roleum products, and is threatening to join
OPEC."
The audience laughed, but King reminded
them to take note of the importance of North
Sea oil.
"Britain's 1978 surplus will be bigger than the
West German," he said. "For at least the next 10
to 12 years, Britain can count on an enormous
balance of payments surplus."
Questioned about trade union power in in
dustry, King said he thought the great inflation
of 1974-75 had caused a change in the tactics and
politics of British trade unionists.
"Until 1975," said King, "British trade unions
regarded capitalism, government, employers as
alien, distant nothing to do with them."
He said he thought that in 1975 inflation had
forced trade unionists to realize that pushing up
wage settlements was having a bad effect "not
only on something out there, an abstraction cal
led the economy, but on themselves, their
members."
Another question focused on the number and
influence of oil-rich Arabs in London.
"Arabs are buying real estate in London and
banks in Georgia," King replied. "It doesn't
worry me; they can't take them away."
Favorite sight
He said one of his favorite sights in London is
Arab ladies buying literally hundreds of gar
ments at Marks and Spencer, a leading British
department store.
"It's funny," King said," because Marks and
Spencers is owned and operated by one of the
most strongly Zionist families in British Jewry."
King said he thought the only worry in having
Arabs in England, and especially in London, was
that they might bring the violence of the Middle
East to the capital. In fact, there have been three
murders of Arabs in London in the last 10 days.
But that is not about to cause the demise of
the whole country. Indeed, King painted a rosy
picture overall.
"The question I set myself," he said, "is, is
Britain about to collapse? The answer is No."
