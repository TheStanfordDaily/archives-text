# Nicotine found in women's breasts

San Francisco (AP) â€” Women cigarette smokers accumulate
nicotine in their breasts, according to researchers at the Univer
sity of California at San Francisco.
In a report in the Jan. 20 issue of Science magazine released
yesterday, Dr. Nicholas Petrakis said the findings indicate that
other foreign substances, "including carcinogens found in
cagarettes," could accumulate in the breast.
The findings, he said "could have relevance to research on
causes of breast cancer."
The university said earlier studies implied only milk producing
women collected foreign substances in their breasts. The UC
study focused on non-lactating women.
Lactating women get rid of any accumulated foreign sub
stances, such as nicotine, when they breast feed, the study said.
The breast fluid of non-lactating women builds up in the breast
ducts, the study said. Breast cancer, which strikes some 90,000
women a year, originates in those breast ducts, the researchers
said.
Petrakis said there was no evidence showing women smokers
had a higher rate of breast cancer.
"However," he added, "the fact that cigarette smoke contains
. . . several known carcinogenic chemicals which are also proba
bly secreted by the breast we suspect that these might be a
potential risk."
Petrakis and five other researchers drew fluid from the breasts
of six women, including four regular smokers. Samples were
taken 15 minutes after smoking. No nicotine was found in the
breast fluids of the two non-smokers.
