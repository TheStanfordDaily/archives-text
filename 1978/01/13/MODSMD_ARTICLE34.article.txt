# Dement explores the most ignored third of your life
## 
### Sup Goldfarb 
"The biological riddle of the
century is that we don't know
why we sleep, and sleep is po
tentially dangerous. Still,
everywhere you look, sleep is
ignored," said Dr. William
Dement, physiologist, clini
cian and professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sci
ences here.
"The myth of modern
medicine is that doctors have
or soon will have all the
answers. Yet one third of
human life, the time which is
spent sleeping, has been to
tally ignored," the nation's
leading sleep and dreams re
searcher continued.
Dement was initially in
terested in how the mind turns
on and off. This led him to his
inquiry into the radical
changes that take place in the
mind during sleep.
He also explores the rela
tionship between personality
development and dreams.
Through his endeavors, De

ment aspires to "make a trans
lation of theory into practice."
Pills
"Too often sleeping pills are
prescribed as a cure. The sleep
induced by a pill is different
than regular sleep. Although
the total effect is unclear, it is
known that sleeping pills are
addictive, and that in itself is
harmful," Dement said.
Beginning his research in the
1950s at the University of
Chicago, Dement published
numerous accounts of his dis
coveries. In 1963 he came west
and established the sleep re
search center and in 1973,
founded Stanford's sleep dis
orders center.
Here he clarified several
sleep syndromes including in
fant death syndrome, which
can often result in crib death;
apnea, the loss of breath dur
ing sleep and narcolepsy, the
experience of round-the-clock
sleepiness.
While treatment can help
narcoleptics, the disease

seems to be inborn and sur
faces at puberty. Although the
cause is unknown, it is known
that the disease is incurable.
"A major problem in treat
ment is that narcoleptics need
stimulants, which are rapidly
being removed from the mar
ket," Dement said.
"It is interesting," Dement
noted, "that the average col
lege student is much more
tired than the average 12 year
old."

'The myth of modern medicine is that doc
tors have or soon will have all the answers.
Yet one-third of human life, the time which
is spent sleeping, has been totally ignored/

Dement now teaches at the
Medical School here, holds a
Psychology 157: Sleep and
Dreams class, instructs physi
cians throughout the country
and heads the sleep disorders

center.
Dement has received na
tional recognition from the
New York Academy of Science,
the University of Chicago and
the American Psychiatric As
sociation.
Besides dealing with pa
tients, Dement is actively in
volved in narcolepsy, insom
nia, sleep apnea, and clinical
research.
With a schedule such as this,
it seems incredible that De

ment himself doesn't suffer
from narcolepsy.
Sleep research almost nil
Dement outlined some
problems in sleep research.
"What little has gone on has
been mythologically deter
mined." He said 80 per cent of
the people suffering from
sleep disorders are undiag
nosed because doctors are un
aware of the specific sleep dis
orders that cause complaints.
"Incredibly, doctors go
through medical school and
graduate literally ignorant of a
large facet of human life —
sleep functions. Worse yet,
until very recently there was no
effort to teach anything about
sleep."
Dement cited U.S. figures,
saying, "360,000 doctors can
treat patients for waking disor
ders, but less than 50 doctors
can treat people for sleep dis
orders."
Farming analogy
Dement further illustrates
the problem of fitting sleep re
search into modern medicine
by comparing the situation to
farming.
"A hundred years ago, it was
no problem starting a farm.
Land was abundant and squat
ter's rights were granted. But
try to start a farm today, and
there's no land, or if there is,

it's extremely expensive.
"Similarly, a hundred years
ago medicine was rather
abstract, and there were no
concrete answers. But with the
development of drugs like
penicillin and the tuberculosis
vaccination, absolutes have
been established.
"Now we come up with a re
latively new inquiry — sleep
research, and we're like to
day's farmer trying to fi nd land.
Do we fit in with biology,
psychiatry, internal medicine
— where?" he said.
Major aspect of life
Apparently, Dement be
lieves sleep research belongs
in all categories of medicine.
When asked which route was
best for an individual wanting
to participate in sleep re
search, he responded, "Any
medical field: internal
medicine, cardiology,
psychiatry, pediatrics . . .
sleep is a major aspect of all
human biology."
Dement's Sleep and Dreams
course this quarter is the only
undergraduate course this
quarter offered in this
area. Seminars are available
and students may become

'The course will emphasize the importance
of sleep and how the body functions while
sleeping. It will raise student awareness of
potential problems. Briefly, it is an educa
tion of the night side of life/

teaching assistants for Sleep
and Dreams, and may partici
pate in research during spring
and summer breaks. Although
Sleep and Dreams may fit bet
ter into the human biology de
partment, the urgent need for
support is clear.
'Night side'
"The course will emphasize
the importance of sleep and
how the body functions while
sleeping. It will raise student
awareness of potential prob
lems. Briefly, it is an education
of the night side of life."

Although it started out as an
undergraduate special, Sleep
and Dreams is now in the
Psychology department, which
helps offset the costs.
"The course will take a close
look at REM (rapid eye move
ment) sleep," Dement said.
This is a normal state of sleep in
which the active brain halluci
nates through dreaming, and
the voluntary muscles are

paralyzed except the diap
hragm and the eyes.
Particular dangers can occur
in sleep because the muscles in
the rib cage are paralyzed. Ad
ditional dangers occur for in
fants because their rib cages
aren't firm and collapse as the
infant inhales, restricting air
entry, and resulting possible
crib death.
While sleep research is a re
latively new field, it is an ex
ceedingly important one, De
ment said. Many sleep disor
ders and dangers have been
uncovered and can be treated.
However, Dement said his
work still requires support to
be successfully integrated into
the medical profession.

lieves sleep research belongs
in all categories of medicine.
When asked which route was
best for an individual wanting
to participate in sleep re
search, he responded, "Any

medicine, cardiology,

sleep is a major aspect of all
human biology."

undergraduate course this
quarter offered in this
area. Seminars are available

'Night side'
"The course will emphasize
the importance of sleep and
how the body functions while
sleeping. It will raise student
awareness of potential prob
lems. Briefly, it is an education
of the night side of life."

Although it started out as an
undergraduate special, Sleep
and Dreams is now in the
Psychology department, which
helps offset the costs.
"The course will take a close
look at REM (rapid eye move
ment) sleep," Dement said.
This is a normal state of sleep in
which the active brain halluci
nates through dreaming, and
the voluntary muscles are

paralyzed except the diap
hragm and the eyes.
Particular dangers can occur
in sleep because the muscles in
the rib cage are paralyzed. Ad
ditional dangers occur for in
fants because their rib cages
aren't firm and collapse as the
infant inhales, restricting air
entry, and resulting possible
crib death.
While sleep research is a re
latively new field, it is an ex
ceedingly important one, De
ment said. Many sleep disor
ders and dangers have been
uncovered and can be treated.
However, Dement said his
work still requires support to
be successfully integrated into
the medical profession.

"The biological riddle of the
century is that we don't know
why we sleep, and sleep is po
tentially dangerous. Still,
everywhere you look, sleep is
ignored," said Dr. William
Dement, physiologist, clini
cian and professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sci
ences here.
"The myth of modern
medicine is that doctors have
or soon will have all the
answers. Yet one third of
human life, the time which is
spent sleeping, has been to
tally ignored," the nation's
leading sleep and dreams re
searcher continued.
Dement was initially in
terested in how the mind turns
on and off. This led him to his
inquiry into the radical
changes that take place in the
mind during sleep.
He also explores the rela
tionship between personality
development and dreams.
Through his endeavors, De

ment aspires to "make a trans
lation of theory into practice."
Pills
"Too often sleeping pills are
prescribed as a cure. The sleep
induced by a pill is different
than regular sleep. Although
the total effect is unclear, it is
known that sleeping pills are
addictive, and that in itself is
harmful," Dement said.
Beginning his research in the
1950s at the University of
Chicago, Dement published
numerous accounts of his dis
coveries. In 1963 he came west
and established the sleep re
search center and in 1973,
founded Stanford's sleep dis
orders center.
Here he clarified several
sleep syndromes including in
fant death syndrome, which
can often result in crib death;
apnea, the loss of breath dur
ing sleep and narcolepsy, the
experience of round-the-clock
sleepiness.
While treatment can help
narcoleptics, the disease

seems to be inborn and sur
faces at puberty. Although the
cause is unknown, it is known
that the disease is incurable.
"A major problem in treat
ment is that narcoleptics need
stimulants, which are rapidly
being removed from the mar
ket," Dement said.
"It is interesting," Dement
noted, "that the average col
lege student is much more
tired than the average 12 year
old."

'The myth of modern medicine is that doc
tors have or soon will have all the answers.
Yet one-third of human life, the time which
is spent sleeping, has been totally ignored/

Dement now teaches at the
Medical School here, holds a
Psychology 157: Sleep and
Dreams class, instructs physi
cians throughout the country
and heads the sleep disorders

center.
Dement has received na
tional recognition from the
New York Academy of Science,
the University of Chicago and
the American Psychiatric As
sociation.
Besides dealing with pa
tients, Dement is actively in
volved in narcolepsy, insom
nia, sleep apnea, and clinical
research.
With a schedule such as this,
it seems incredible that De

ment himself doesn't suffer
from narcolepsy.
Sleep research almost nil
Dement outlined some
problems in sleep research.
"What little has gone on has
been mythologically deter
mined." He said 80 per cent of
the people suffering from
sleep disorders are undiag
nosed because doctors are un
aware of the specific sleep dis
orders that cause complaints.
"Incredibly, doctors go
through medical school and
graduate literally ignorant of a
large facet of human life —
sleep functions. Worse yet,
until very recently there was no
effort to teach anything about
sleep."
Dement cited U.S. figures,
saying, "360,000 doctors can
treat patients for waking disor
ders, but less than 50 doctors
can treat people for sleep dis
orders."
Farming analogy
Dement further illustrates
the problem of fitting sleep re
search into modern medicine
by comparing the situation to
farming.
"A hundred years ago, it was
no problem starting a farm.
Land was abundant and squat
ter's rights were granted. But
try to start a farm today, and
there's no land, or if there is,

it's extremely expensive.
"Similarly, a hundred years

Here he clarified several
sleep syndromes including in
fant death syndrome, which
can often result in crib death;
apnea, the loss of breath dur
ing sleep and narcolepsy, the
experience of round-the-clock
sleepiness.
While treatment can help
narcoleptics, the disease

seems to be inborn and sur
faces at puberty. Although the
cause is unknown, it is known
that the disease is incurable.
"A major problem in treat
ment is that narcoleptics need
stimulants, which are rapidly
being removed from the mar
ket," Dement said.
"It is interesting," Dement
noted, "that the average col
lege student is much more
tired than the average 12 year
old."

Dement now teaches at the
Medical School here, holds a
Psychology 157: Sleep and
Dreams class, instructs physi
cians throughout the country
and heads the sleep disorders

center.
Dement has received na
tional recognition from the
New York Academy of Science,
the University of Chicago and
the American Psychiatric As
sociation.
Besides dealing with pa
tients, Dement is actively in
volved in narcolepsy, insom
nia, sleep apnea, and clinical
research.
With a schedule such as this,
it seems incredible that De

ment himself doesn't suffer
from narcolepsy.
Sleep research almost nil
Dement outlined some
problems in sleep research.
"What little has gone on has
been mythologically deter
mined." He said 80 per cent of
the people suffering from
sleep disorders are undiag
nosed because doctors are un
aware of the specific sleep dis
orders that cause complaints.
"Incredibly, doctors go
through medical school and
graduate literally ignorant of a
large facet of human life —
sleep functions. Worse yet,
until very recently there was no
effort to teach anything about
sleep."
Dement cited U.S. figures,
saying, "360,000 doctors can
treat patients for waking disor
ders, but less than 50 doctors
can treat people for sleep dis
orders."
Farming analogy
Dement further illustrates
the problem of fitting sleep re
search into modern medicine
by comparing the situation to
farming.
"A hundred years ago, it was
no problem starting a farm.
Land was abundant and squat
ter's rights were granted. But
try to start a farm today, and
there's no land, or if there is,

it's extremely expensive.
"Similarly, a hundred years
ago medicine was rather
abstract, and there were no
concrete answers. But with the
development of drugs like
penicillin and the tuberculosis
vaccination, absolutes have
been established.
"Now we come up with a re
latively new inquiry — sleep
research, and we're like to
day's farmer trying to fi nd land.
Do we fit in with biology,
psychiatry, internal medicine
— where?" he said.
Major aspect of life
Apparently, Dement be
lieves sleep research belongs
in all categories of medicine.
When asked which route was
best for an individual wanting
to participate in sleep re
search, he responded, "Any
medical field: internal
medicine, cardiology,
psychiatry, pediatrics . . .
sleep is a major aspect of all
human biology."
Dement's Sleep and Dreams
course this quarter is the only
undergraduate course this
quarter offered in this
area. Seminars are available
and students may become

of sleep and how the body functions while
sleeping. It will raise student awareness of
potential problems. Briefly, it is an educa
tion of the night side of life/

teaching assistants for Sleep
and Dreams, and may partici
pate in research during spring

Sleep and Dreams may fit bet
ter into the human biology de
partment, the urgent need for
support is clear.
'Night side'
"The course will emphasize
the importance of sleep and
how the body functions while
sleeping. It will raise student
awareness of potential prob
lems. Briefly, it is an education
of the night side of life."

Although it started out as an
undergraduate special, Sleep
and Dreams is now in the
Psychology department, which
helps offset the costs.
"The course will take a close
look at REM (rapid eye move
ment) sleep," Dement said.
This is a normal state of sleep in
which the active brain halluci
nates through dreaming, and
the voluntary muscles are

paralyzed except the diap
hragm and the eyes.
Particular dangers can occur
in sleep because the muscles in
the rib cage are paralyzed. Ad
ditional dangers occur for in
fants because their rib cages
aren't firm and collapse as the
infant inhales, restricting air
entry, and resulting possible
crib death.
While sleep research is a re
latively new field, it is an ex
ceedingly important one, De
ment said. Many sleep disor
ders and dangers have been
uncovered and can be treated.
However, Dement said his
work still requires support to
be successfully integrated into
the medical profession.

"The biological riddle of the
century is that we don't know
why we sleep, and sleep is po
tentially dangerous. Still,
everywhere you look, sleep is
ignored," said Dr. William
Dement, physiologist, clini
cian and professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sci
ences here.
"The myth of modern
medicine is that doctors have
or soon will have all the
answers. Yet one third of
human life, the time which is
spent sleeping, has been to
tally ignored," the nation's
leading sleep and dreams re
searcher continued.
Dement was initially in
terested in how the mind turns
on and off. This led him to his
inquiry into the radical
changes that take place in the
mind during sleep.
He also explores the rela
tionship between personality
development and dreams.
Through his endeavors, De

ment aspires to "make a trans
lation of theory into practice."
Pills
"Too often sleeping pills are
prescribed as a cure. The sleep
induced by a pill is different
than regular sleep. Although
the total effect is unclear, it is
known that sleeping pills are
addictive, and that in itself is
harmful," Dement said.
Beginning his research in the
1950s at the University of
Chicago, Dement published
numerous accounts of his dis
coveries. In 1963 he came west
and established the sleep re
search center and in 1973,
founded Stanford's sleep dis
orders center.
Here he clarified several
sleep syndromes including in
fant death syndrome, which
can often result in crib death;
