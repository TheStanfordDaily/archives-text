Halftime — Stanford 28, WSU 28 Fouled
out — Stanford, McHugh Attendance —
4936.

McHugh missed a jumper, and
the Cougars gained control.
But after Washington State
went into a stall, Stuart House
was called for traveling.
Then with 1:11 left, George
Schader, the game's high
scorer with 21 points, was
fouled near the basket, but the
officials ruled he was not
shooting, so Stanford took the
ball out-of-bounds.
The Cards fed the ball in
low to Kimberly Belton who
rolled to the hoop for a basket,
but referee Booker Turner cal
led the forward for traveling.
One more chance
The Cards got the ball back
when WSU committed a five
second violation, but then Bel
ton was whistled for a charge.
House missed the first free
throw, but got his own re
bound. The Cards then fouled
Collins with 19 seconds left,
and he hit both free throws to
give the Cougars their margin
of victory.
"I had my three best free

throw shooters in at the end so
I wasn't worried about free
throw situations," said WSU
coach George Raveling. "I
didn't care who they fouled,
but they fouled Don, and that
was nice because he hasn't
missed a foul shot in three
games."
The biggest lead for either
team in the second half was
four points. The Cougars led
57-53 with five minutes to go
before Daryle Morgan and
McHugh hit jumpers to knot
the game. The Cards went
ahead with Vh minutes to go
when Wolfe Perry canned a
baseline jumper, but then they
did not score for the remainder
of the game.
"We played well," said Stan
ford coach Dick Dißiaso, "but
not well enough to win. I think
we played good defense con
sidering all we had to do to ad
just."
And Stanford had plenty of
adjusting to do. The Cougars'
big trees in the middle —

7-foot-2 James Donaldson and
6-11 House — clogged the
middle and dominated the
backboards, particularly dur
ing the first half.
"You have to have the
proper balance," said Dißiaso.
"We obviously don't have the
big guys. We held House
down, but their guards (Terry)
Kelly and (Tim) Jankovich had
great games."
Kelly was the Cougars' top
scorer with 16 points and Jan

kovich contributed 10. Schader
led the Cards with 21, with 13 of
them coming in the first half
when he hit on six of nine at
tempts from the floor.
"Schader surprised us with
his great outside shooting/'
said Raveling. Schader led a
first-half comeback by the
Cards that saw them bring a
25-12 deficit to a 28-28 tie at
half. He hit four shots from at
least 15 feet as the Cards out
scored the Cougars 14-1 during
a five-minute stretch.

Halftime — Stanford 28, WSU 28 Fouled
out — Stanford, McHugh Attendance —
4936.

McHugh missed a jumper, and
the Cougars gained control.
But after Washington State
went into a stall, Stuart House
was called for traveling.
Then with 1:11 left, George
Schader, the game's high
scorer with 21 points, was
fouled near the basket, but the
officials ruled he was not
shooting, so Stanford took the
ball out-of-bounds.
The Cards fed the ball in
low to Kimberly Belton who
rolled to the hoop for a basket,
but referee Booker Turner cal
led the forward for traveling.
One more chance
The Cards got the ball back
when WSU committed a five
second violation, but then Bel
ton was whistled for a charge.
House missed the first free
throw, but got his own re
bound. The Cards then fouled
Collins with 19 seconds left,
and he hit both free throws to
give the Cougars their margin
of victory.
"I had my three best free

throw shooters in at the end so
I wasn't worried about free
throw situations," said WSU
coach George Raveling. "I
didn't care who they fouled,
but they fouled Don, and that
was nice because he hasn't
missed a foul shot in three
games."
The biggest lead for either
team in the second half was
four points. The Cougars led
57-53 with five minutes to go
before Daryle Morgan and
McHugh hit jumpers to knot
the game. The Cards went
ahead with Vh minutes to go
when Wolfe Perry canned a
baseline jumper, but then they
did not score for the remainder
of the game.
"We played well," said Stan
ford coach Dick Dißiaso, "but
not well enough to win. I think
we played good defense con
sidering all we had to do to ad
just."
And Stanford had plenty of
adjusting to do. The Cougars'
big trees in the middle —

7-foot-2 James Donaldson and
6-11 House — clogged the
middle and dominated the
backboards, particularly dur
ing the first half.
"You have to have the
proper balance," said Dißiaso.
"We obviously don't have the
big guys. We held House
down, but their guards (Terry)
Kelly and (Tim) Jankovich had
great games."
Kelly was the Cougars' top
scorer with 16 points and Jan

kovich contributed 10. Schader
led the Cards with 21, with 13 of
them coming in the first half
when he hit on six of nine at
tempts from the floor.
"Schader surprised us with
his great outside shooting/'
said Raveling. Schader led a
first-half comeback by the
Cards that saw them bring a
25-12 deficit to a 28-28 tie at
half. He hit four shots from at
least 15 feet as the Cards out
scored the Cougars 14-1 during
a five-minute stretch.

Halftime — Stanford 28, WSU 28 Fouled
out — Stanford, McHugh Attendance —
4936.

McHugh missed a jumper, and
the Cougars gained control.
But after Washington State
went into a stall, Stuart House
was called for traveling.
Then with 1:11 left, George
Schader, the game's high
scorer with 21 points, was
fouled near the basket, but the
officials ruled he was not
shooting, so Stanford took the
ball out-of-bounds.
The Cards fed the ball in
low to Kimberly Belton who
rolled to the hoop for a basket,
but referee Booker Turner cal
led the forward for traveling.
One more chance
The Cards got the ball back
when WSU committed a five
second violation, but then Bel
ton was whistled for a charge.
House missed the first free
throw, but got his own re
bound. The Cards then fouled
Collins with 19 seconds left,
and he hit both free throws to
give the Cougars their margin
of victory.
"I had my three best free

throw shooters in at the end so
I wasn't worried about free
throw situations," said WSU
coach George Raveling. "I
didn't care who they fouled,
but they fouled Don, and that
was nice because he hasn't
missed a foul shot in three
games."
The biggest lead for either
team in the second half was
four points. The Cougars led
57-53 with five minutes to go
before Daryle Morgan and
McHugh hit jumpers to knot
the game. The Cards went
ahead with Vh minutes to go
when Wolfe Perry canned a
baseline jumper, but then they
did not score for the remainder
of the game.
"We played well," said Stan
ford coach Dick Dißiaso, "but
not well enough to win. I think
we played good defense con
sidering all we had to do to ad
just."
And Stanford had plenty of
adjusting to do. The Cougars'
big trees in the middle —

7-foot-2 James Donaldson and
6-11 House — clogged the
middle and dominated the
backboards, particularly dur
ing the first half.
"You have to have the
proper balance," said Dißiaso.
"We obviously don't have the
big guys. We held House
down, but their guards (Terry)
Kelly and (Tim) Jankovich had
great games."
Kelly was the Cougars' top
scorer with 16 points and Jan

kovich contributed 10. Schader
led the Cards with 21, with 13 of
them coming in the first half
when he hit on six of nine at
tempts from the floor.
"Schader surprised us with
his great outside shooting/'
said Raveling. Schader led a
first-half comeback by the
Cards that saw them bring a
25-12 deficit to a 28-28 tie at
half. He hit four shots from at
least 15 feet as the Cards out
scored the Cougars 14-1 during
a five-minute stretch.

George Schader goes up for a jump shot in last night's 59-62 loss to
the Washington State Cougers. Schader had his best offensive night
of the year for the Cards last night, scoring 21 points. The loss drops
Stanford to 8-6 for the season and 0-3 in conference play.
Washington State's Don Col
lins had only four points in the
second half last night at Maples
Pavilion, but those four pulled
out a 62-59 win for the Cougars
and gave Stanford its third
Pacific-8 loss without a win this
season.
With Stanford leading 60-59
with two-and-one-half minutes
to play, Collins stole the ball
from the Cards' Jeff Ryan and
went the length of the court for
a slam dunk and a one-point
lead.
