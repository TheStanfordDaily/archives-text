# 5 Cards in Challenge Bowl
## 
### 
Ohio State and Michigan
have dominated the Big Ten for
the past decade. One or the
other has been the confer
ence's representative in the
Rose Bowl during that time,
and the two have headed back
to the midwest with a com
bined total of two victories,
both by Ohio State (1969 and
1974).
But tomorrow in Seattle's
Kingdome, Ohio State and
Michigan won't be dominating
the roster of the Big Ten squad
for the inaugural Challenge
Bowl. Only six Wolverines or
Buckeyes will be on the 33-man
team which will be facing an
all-star team of Pacific-8
seniors.
Even with the lack of rep
resentation by the pow
erhouses, the Big Ten's reputa
tion for grind 'em up football
remains. The coach of the
midwesterners is lack Pardee,

the Chicago Bear coach whose
team's offense consists of giv
ing the ball to Walter Payton as
often as possible.
Unfortunately for Pardee,
the running backs in the game
aren't quite as well known, not
to mention as good, as Payton.
John Skibinski of Purdue,
James Earley of Michigan State
and James Coleman of Illinois
are the Big Ten's running
backs.
Coleman's teammate Kurt
Steger and Tom McLaughlin of
lowa are Pardee's quarter
backs.
The Big Ten's biggest names
are probably on defense,
where Buckeyes Aaron Brown
and Ed Beamon are on the line,
and Wolverine Dwight Hicks in
the secondary.
The Pacific-8, meanwhile,
has a coach whose pro team
has a potent passing attack.
Seattle Seahawk coach Jack

Patera, though a believer that
defense is the way to champ
ionships, has a pro team that is
known for its passing. And his
college stars have the talent to
score through the air from
anywhere on the field.
Pac-8 Co-Players of the Year,
Stanford's Guy Benjamin and
Washington's Warren Moon,
will be the quarterbacks. Mike
Levenseller of Washington
State, Cal's Jesse Thompson
and James Lofton and Bill Kellar
of Stanford will be their targets
at receivers.
Other Cards playing in the
game are tackle Cordon King
and linebacker Ray Cardinally
Washington State has the
most players on the team with
six, followed by the Cards and
USC with five apiece.
