### 
Atlanta (AP) â€” Four games
into the 1977 season, the Uni
versity of Washington had a 1-3
record and Coach Don James
remembers it as "the most in
credibly awful experience of
my life."
But Thursday, James "hit the
jackpot" when he was named

Major College Coach of the
Year by the more than 2000
members of the American
Football Coaches Association.
In between, the Washington
Huskies won six of their final
seven regular-season games
and then upset Michigan 27-20
in the Rose Bowl to finish 8-4.
