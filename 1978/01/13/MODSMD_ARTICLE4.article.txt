# McCloskey favors canal treaty
## 
### Craig Dennis 
Congressman Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) said
' there are ambiguities and questions that need to be
clarified," but continued his strong support of the
Panama Canal treaty last night in Kresge Auditorium.
McCloskey was challenged, in a debate sponsored by
the Stanford Committee on Political Education, by
Richard Burress, associate director and research fellow
at the Hoover Institute.
Burress countered by saying, "If ratified, the treaty
will lead us into big trouble in the foreseeable future. I
think the American people are being misled." He added
that treaty ratification would be "handing the next gen
eration a grenade that is armed."
However, McCloskey said treaty ratification would
diminish the possibility of conflict in the Canal Zone.
"None of those fears are as dangerous to the United
States," he said, "as the possibility that a refusal to ratify
the treaty will be accompanied by what (Panama Presi
dent Omar) Torrijos has said is the willingness of 50,000
young Panamanians to die rather than accept this slight
of their national honor."
Even odds
The odds of treaty ratification in the Senate are no
greater than "even," said McCloskey, representative of
California's 12th District which includes the Stanford
campus.
He said his constituent mail is running3oo to 5 against
treaty ratification. McCloskey said that in the Senate,
there are 40 votes for the treaty and 25 against, with 35
senators undecided at the present time. He classified
most of the undecided leading toward treaty ratification.
Noting that the conservatives are pressuring Senator
Howard Baker (R-Tenn.), a pivotal swing vote and a po
tential presidential candidate in 1980, McCloskey said it
wouldbe "a real caseof statesmanship if he votes for it."
McCloskey is the senior Republican member of the
House Merchant Marines and Fisheries Committee,
which will be considering certain funding aspects of the
treaty if ratified by the Senate.
Burress and McCloskey differed sharply on the canal's
commercial, economic and military value. McCloskey

said the canal's use is dropping. He suggested it might
be almost unused by the U.S. by the year 2000.
But Burress countered, "The ink will barely be dry
before the next negotiations begin, and the United
States is asked to leave completely by 1990 at the latest."
Neutrality questioned
He questioned the neutrality aspect of the treaty, say
ing it does not mean the right to intervene after treaty
implementation, even though Defense Department of
ficials claim it does.
He said, "Privileged passage, whatever that means,
... is not priority passage and that is what we need in an
emergency."
McCloskey said, "The greater risk to U.S. military and
commercial use of the canal can occur from a hostile
populace. If there is no way to prevent the sabotage of
the canal either from a guerrilla force moving overland
or from blowing up a tanker in the canal then we should
not consider the possibility that there is no real benefit
in a permanent sovereignty which military force cannot
protect."
He added, "With respect to the Canal Zone, there is
no question this is viewed as the last vestige of im
perialism in our time, the American contention of
sovereignty over the Canal Zone."
Military importance
Questioning the military importance of the canal,
McCloskey said it was difficult for him to conceive of
naval war with the Soviet Union without nuclear
weapons "when fast transport is not a necessity."
Burress claimed there was a greater danger of conflict
by turning the canal over to Panama. Describing Torrijos
as a dictator, he said, "If he wants a riot, he gets it.
"Certainly the opportunity to defend the canal is
much greater," Burress continued, "if troops are in
place rather than an amphibious landing."
However, McCloskey said the "debate should not
center on the frailties of the Panamanian government."
He said the posture of the United States will be "faced
with an equal and greater problem if we do not ratify."

protect."
He added, "With respect to the Canal Zone, there is
no question this is viewed as the last vestige of im
perialism in our time, the American contention of
sovereignty over the Canal Zone."
Military importance
Questioning the military importance of the canal,
McCloskey said it was difficult for him to conceive of
naval war with the Soviet Union without nuclear
weapons "when fast transport is not a necessity."
Burress claimed there was a greater danger of conflict
by turning the canal over to Panama. Describing Torrijos
as a dictator, he said, "If he wants a riot, he gets it.
"Certainly the opportunity to defend the canal is
much greater," Burress continued, "if troops are in
place rather than an amphibious landing."
However, McCloskey said the "debate should not
center on the frailties of the Panamanian government."
He said the posture of the United States will be "faced
with an equal and greater problem if we do not ratify."


Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) spoke on the Panama
Canal treaty on campus yesterday. McCloskey (I.) was

joined by panelist Richard Burress and moderator Paul
Cheverton.
Congressman Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) said
' there are ambiguities and questions that need to be
clarified," but continued his strong support of the
Panama Canal treaty last night in Kresge Auditorium.
McCloskey was challenged, in a debate sponsored by
the Stanford Committee on Political Education, by
Richard Burress, associate director and research fellow
at the Hoover Institute.
Burress countered by saying, "If ratified, the treaty
will lead us into big trouble in the foreseeable future. I
think the American people are being misled." He added
that treaty ratification would be "handing the next gen
eration a grenade that is armed."
However, McCloskey said treaty ratification would
diminish the possibility of conflict in the Canal Zone.
"None of those fears are as dangerous to the United
States," he said, "as the possibility that a refusal to ratify
the treaty will be accompanied by what (Panama Presi
dent Omar) Torrijos has said is the willingness of 50,000
young Panamanians to die rather than accept this slight
of their national honor."
Even odds
The odds of treaty ratification in the Senate are no
greater than "even," said McCloskey, representative of
California's 12th District which includes the Stanford
campus.
He said his constituent mail is running3oo to 5 against
treaty ratification. McCloskey said that in the Senate,
there are 40 votes for the treaty and 25 against, with 35
senators undecided at the present time. He classified
most of the undecided leading toward treaty ratification.
Noting that the conservatives are pressuring Senator
Howard Baker (R-Tenn.), a pivotal swing vote and a po
tential presidential candidate in 1980, McCloskey said it
wouldbe "a real caseof statesmanship if he votes for it."
McCloskey is the senior Republican member of the
House Merchant Marines and Fisheries Committee,
which will be considering certain funding aspects of the
treaty if ratified by the Senate.
Burress and McCloskey differed sharply on the canal's
commercial, economic and military value. McCloskey

said the canal's use is dropping. He suggested it might
be almost unused by the U.S. by the year 2000.
But Burress countered, "The ink will barely be dry
before the next negotiations begin, and the United
States is asked to leave completely by 1990 at the latest."
Neutrality questioned
He questioned the neutrality aspect of the treaty, say
ing it does not mean the right to intervene after treaty
implementation, even though Defense Department of
ficials claim it does.
He said, "Privileged passage, whatever that means,
... is not priority passage and that is what we need in an
emergency."
McCloskey said, "The greater risk to U.S. military and
commercial use of the canal can occur from a hostile
populace. If there is no way to prevent the sabotage of
the canal either from a guerrilla force moving overland
or from blowing up a tanker in the canal then we should
not consider the possibility that there is no real benefit
in a permanent sovereignty which military force cannot
protect."
He added, "With respect to the Canal Zone, there is
no question this is viewed as the last vestige of im
perialism in our time, the American contention of
sovereignty over the Canal Zone."
