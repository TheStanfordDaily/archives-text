# Rumors about Walsh move to Rams abound
## 
### Bill Burger 
Stanford football coach Bill
Walsh told the Daily last night
that it is untrue that he has told
friends he "has decided to ac
cept the head coaching job
with the Los Angeles Rams" as
an Associated Press story run
ning this morning in most
major newspapers reports Jim
Healy as saying.
Healy, Sports Director of Los
Angeles radio station KLAC
also was quoted as saying the
Rams would announce the hir
ing of Walsh next Tuesday.
"I haven't really seriously
talked to the Rams," Walsh
said. "On two or three occa
sions they've shown an interest
in me but neither party has
come close to putting this to
gether."
Walsh maintained that he
could neither confirm nor
deny that he would become
the Ram's next head coach.
"Right now," he said, "there is
no job to accept."
Walsh is currently on a re
cruiting trip in southern
California but said he has had
"no serious head to head"
meetings with Ram officials.
Walsh said he has not been
in direct contact with Rams
owner Carroll Rosenbloom
about the coaching job.

Walsh did say that Don Klos
terman, the Rams' General
Manager, had been to the Stan
ford campus on more than one
occasion. Walsh said Kloster
man is interested in one of
Stanford's graduating seniors.
Walsh also said, however, that
he and Klosterman are "good
friends" and have talked about
the Rams' coaching position.
Chuck Knox became head
coach of the NFL's Buffalo Bills
this week, officially opening up
the Rams job. Healy said Walsh
had told friends he had been in
contact with the Rams about
the coaching job for five
weeks.
"I do believe the Los Angeles
Rams are one of the two or
three best franchises in the
NFL," Walsh said. He also said
that if he were one day to move
to the NFL he hoped it would
be with a "team like the Rams,
the Bears, or one of the New
York clubs, to name a few."
