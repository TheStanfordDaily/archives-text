National swimming powers
Arizona and Arizona State in
vade the farm this weekend for
the first time in several seasons
hoping to out-churn the
talented Stanford men swim
mers at deCuerre pool. Both
dual meets, according to Car
dinal head coach Jim Gaug
hran, should prove "extremely
tough."
Several matchups should
provide plenty of excitement
for spectators. Munich Olym
pian Rick DeMont of Arizona,
who received widespread at
tention when his 400 meter
freestyle gold medal was taken
away because of a banned drug
prescribed to him by his physi
cian, has emerged as one of the
nation's top sprinters. He will
face Stanford's Jon Powell, cur
rently ranked second nation
ally, only to world record hol
der Jonty Skinner, among 100
yard freestylers.
DeMont's teammate, Doug
Northway, a distance
specialist, will battle Stanford
Olympians Mike Bruner and

Paul Hartloff and endurance
swimmers Bill Chao and Monte
Brown. Bruner, Jim Belardi,
and Tom O'Brien will contend
with Arizona's Steve Tallman in
the 200 yard butterfly who
finished third in this event at
last year's national champion
ships.
Rounding out Arizona's
squad: Lance Michaelis, a
world class breaststroker, Rick
DeMont's brother Ken (indi
vidual medley, and
backstroke), sprinter Steve
Wyatt and a group of fine di
vers.
Stanford swimmers Sam
Franklin, Bob Hagberg, Ken
Shilling, Rob Weber, Andy
Nichols, Kevin Reel, Jack Con
nelly and John Kingery will be
counted on to take important
points.
While Arizona is rich in qual
ity, Arizona State is rich in
depth. Outstanding in relays,
with a super group of divers,
and always tough in dual
meets, Arizona State promises
to give Stanford all they can
handle.

Leading the Sundevils will be
NCAA All-American Blake
Johnson (individual medley
and backstroke), distance men
Mike French, Paul Asmuth,
Shannon Varner, and divers
Dan La Sarge and Kevin
Weyrauch.
The meet will probably be
decided by the relay events in
which Stanford has yet to be
tested this season.
The Stanford Relays, an an
nual event, will present both
men and women swimmers
with opportunities to swim dis
tances and events not normally
swum in dual meet competi
tion. Presently, the teams en
tered are Stanford, California,
Arizona, Arizona State, Chico
State, San Jose State, Marin
Aquatic Club and Santa Clara
Swim Club.
Arizona State will tackle
Stanford at 2 p.m. on Friday.
The Stanford Relays com
mence at 1 p.m. on Saturday.
The University of Arizona meet
is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m.
on Monday.

nual event, will present both
men and women swimmers
with opportunities to swim dis
tances and events not normally
swum in dual meet competi
