# Winkers serious about their sport
## Tiddlywinks finds a home at Stanford 
### Richard Keller 
A squoped wink can't be
squidged again until it is de
squoped either by the origi
nal squoper or by a squoper's
partner who manages to
squidge a third wink atop the
second and push the squoper
off.
If this doesn't seem like an
everyday topic of discussion,
don't panic. It isn't likely that a
woman will squidge your
squop for a discreet wink or
two. You just aren't one of the
several hundred Americans
playing the ultimate game of
strategy: tiddlywinks.
Ross Callon, a graduate stu
dent in operations research,
founded Stanford's tiddlywink
ing team two falls ago. If you
are among the disbelievers
who feel winkers reach their

prime in kindergarten, dor; t
tell Callon. He is 6-foot-4,
weighs 200 lbs and takes his
winking seriously.
"Comparing tiddlywinks to a
child's game is like saying
bridge resembles go fish,"
stated Callon. "I was our high
school chess champion, but
winking is much more intellec
tually challenging than bridge
or chess. The thing with winks
is that its a strategic game. It's
like playing chess but you have
to throw the pieces instead of
placing them. You can't count
on a particular shot working."
The modern version of
tiddlywinks evolved from Eng
land about 1955. A group of
men wanted to set up a frater
nity at Cambridge University,
but they needed three ac
tivities to receive official status.
Since they only had two,
tiddlywinks was born.
In the late 19605, the game
moved to the eastern United
States. MIT, where Callon
played in 1973, was the first
university to field a team. Har
vard and Cornell quickly fol
lowed suit.

fish/

According to the interna
tional rules of tiddlywinks, the
playing surface is a 3-foot by
6-foot felt-covered table with a
one and seven-eighth-inch
wide winking pot in the center.
A match is played by four
players, each starting with six
winks in a separate corner of
the mat.
Every player has winks of a
different color. Blue and red
start on diagonal corners of the
mat, and are partners; the
same is true of green and yel
low.
Tiddlywinks are round, plas
tic disks. Each player has two
quarter-sized winks and four
that are dime-sized. A winker
propels (squidges) his winks
by pressing down on their
edges with a larger plastic disc
known as a squidger.
To the untrained eye, a
squidger is a squidger. But
winkers treasure their squid
gers as golfers covet their favo
rite putters. Serious winkers
can spend days polishing and
sanding to bring the perfect
squidger to life.
When one wink becomes
covered by another, the bot
tom wink is considered
squoped. Squoped winks are
not allowed to be squidged.
Scoring is done on a 3-1-0
scale. In games, three points
are awarded for every potted
wink, one point for every free
(uncovered) wink and none for
squoped winks. In tournament
play, four points are given for
winning games, two points for
second place and one for
finishing third.

The more difficult shots to
execute include the gromp
(moving a wink so it covers two
or more other winks), boon
docking (freeing your squoped
wink and shooting your oppo
nent's into the boondocks),
the bristol (a pile shot) and the
piddle (a touch shot by using
the squidger perpendicular to
the wink).
If a wink is so close to the
tiddlepot that it can't be pot
ted, it is considered "nurdled"
(presumably for the nerd who
put it there).
And don't think that basket
ball is the only sport with a shot
clock. To prevent the 25-
minute match from ending too
abruptly, the North American
Tiddlywinks Association
(NATwA) has instituted a 30
second clock. If a team takes
more than the alloted 30 sec
onds to squidge, the clock is
halted until play is resumed.
Callon started squidging
winks in 1972 as an under
graduate at MIT. That same
year, before he made the team,
the MIT winkers traveled to
England where they defeated

the world champions from
Cambridge. Since a winning
team was such a rare occur
ence for MIT, $1800 in student
funds was contributed for the
trip overseas.
"English players aren't
nearly as good as Americans,"
explained Callon. The English
are much better at shooting.
But we play a very conservative
game with careful placement
and defensive formations.
They (the English) just haven't
improved."
The following season, Callon
and the MIT 'A' team con
tinued the winning tradition by
squoping on the national
championships for the second
consecutive time. Since he had
reached the zenith of the wink
ing world, Callon moved west
as an unofficial winks ambas
sador.
In 1974 he founded a team at
the University of British Col
umbia (where he was a compu
ter programmer) and two years
later he formed the Stanford
Winkers.
Analyzing his own game,
Callon said, "I haven't played
very long, but when I play well
there's no one in the world
who can touch me. I've won
about two-thirds of the tour
naments I've been in.
"I have to rely on my
strategy," he continued,
"since my shooting is rather
bland. My forte is playing with
piles of winks.
"I'm not as serious as I have
been. The problem is we're all
too busy. I can't afford to go
back East (for the national

tourneys) because I'm taking
five courses a quarter. I have to
graduate in three quarters be
cause I'm running out of
money. I don't have the time."
The crucial difference bet
ween the kids' game of winks
and the advanced version, is
squoping. No longer is the ob
ject merely to put the
tiddlywinks in the tiddlepot.
Defensive players who squop
have more success than the
old-guard winkers who are
strictly potters. Toddlers have
lost their superiority.
"Winks is 60 percent strategy
and 40 percent shooting,"
claimed Callon. "The strategy
is very, very subtle. When most
people lose they don't know
why they lose. I have a feeling
for what's going on on the
board.
"The players who come out
charging and attacking tend to
lose. A 'blitz' (an attempt to pot
all your winks) works great if
you're hot; but if it doesn't
work, you've lost. One time in
a match I put four of my oppo
nents' winks on two more of
their winks (so all six were
squoped and couldn't be
moved), thereby causing them
to turn green and drop dead."
Callon has made many non
believers aware that
tiddlywinks is not a "simple"
game. Callon bet one such
guinea pig that he (Callon)
could cover all the other gent
leman's winks with his six
winks. Well, in addition to
winning that bet, Callon did
the same thing with five, four,
three and finally two of his
winks. Callon challenged the
former non-believer to cover
with one wink, but he "got dis
gusted and walked away."

'Winking is much more intellectually
challenging than bridge or chess/

"Winkers are a friendly
bunch. One time I got into To
ronto for a tournament at 1:30
in the morning. I didn't have
any place to stay so I showed
up at a winker's house. He had
a perfect right to throw me out
in the street, but hetook me in.
The next day he called in sick
and we played a couple
games."
There are about 200 active
players and 20 teams spread ac
ross the country. The major
winkdom is centered in the
East. The NATwA has divided
winking into four divisions:
Toronto, Ithica, Boston and the
far East (the West). Three
NATwA tournaments are held
on an annual basis: the team
championships in Ithica, N.Y.,
the pairs championships at MIT
and the singles championships
at the same location.
The NATwA, according to
their official publication "The
Return Of The Missing Wink,"
"is an organization based not
upon attitudes held in com
mon, nor upon the further

ence of values held in concert,
nor even upon clearly defined
consensually validated goals. It
is an organization comprised
of many people who have dff*
ferent notions about both what
they wish to derive from wink
dom, and in what direction
they wish to see winx travel,
In May of 1976, the
western winking tourney toctfc
place at the Berkeley alurriqi
house. The program for the
first annual West Coast Invita-;
tional Tiddlywink Champion-;
ships commenced with a flair
for the absurd. Before the
matches got underway, the
crowd was entertained by the
Berkeley Men's Octet, which
sang such hit-bound-sounds as
"Take Me Out To the Wink
Mat" and "You'll Never Squop
Alone." Both tunes, of course,
were taken from the official
NATwA songbook. ) v;
One member of the NATyvA
Ithica division is the team from
Ithica High School. Robin
Cowin, a former member i>f
Ithica's B' team, is now a
sophomore at Stanford. He is
also a starter for the Stanford
Winkers.
"I've been playing since Sep-;
tember of 1975," recalled;
Cowin. "My eleventh grade
math teacher, Severin Drix,
was world champion. He tried
to get all his math students in
volved in winking."
The Ithica high school team
competed against all the col
lege "powers" like MIT, Cor->
nell and Harvard. Although the
team didn't fare too well with\
such fierce competition;
Gowin was confident he could
have played college winks in
the East.
Hesaid, "If I hadgone(East) I

could have been on any team,-
but winks wasn't a factor in-
college I decided to go'
to."
Gowin turned his freshman 1
dormitory, Donner, into the
winking capitol of the West. He
has "officially taught about 20"
of his friends how to play. The
winks revolution was sparked
last fall when another Donner
resident, Kevin Wilson, was
making a sign-up list for in
tramural sports. As a joke he
set aside a category for
tiddlywinks. But when Gowin
signed up and asked Wilson if
he wanted to play, the joke was
over. Wilson claimed he wds
attracted to the sport because
"it's the only game where if
you're too close you can't put it
in."
Callon, Gowin and the rest
of the Stanford Winkers will re
sume their season during
winter quarter. They are tenta
tively scheduled for a rematch
on "the home felt" against the
Fresno Winking and Drinking
Team. .
