Egypt, Israel trade proposals
Cairo — Egypt and Israel traded proposals
yesterday for future security in the Sinai Penin
sula but made no progress on the key issue of
Jewish settlements in that desert region. The
defense chiefs of the two nations insisted,
however, that an answer can be found.
The two sides "are not too far apart and
determined to bridge the gap," said Egyptian
War Minister Mohammed Abdel Ghany
Gamassy. Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weiz
man nodded: "There is a possibility to bridge
the gap."
Weizman and Gamassy held a news confer
ence together on the palm-shaded front lawn
of the Tahra Palace, where their joint commit
tee had just completed a 3V2-hour session on
the second day of talks on military aspects of a
peace agreement.
Weizman reaffirmed the Israeli position that
it wants to keep its 20 settlements in the Sinai
as a means of ensuring its security even after
the peninsula is returned to Egypt.
Gamassy, restating Egypt's demand that all
Israelis evacuate the Sinai, retorted that
Egypt's international borders were not subject
to "discussion or bargaining."
Italian premier may resign
Rome — The possibility of Communists shar
ing power in Italy's government increased yes
terday with word that Premier Giulio Andreot
ti's struggling Christian Democrat administra
tion was preparing to resign.
The country, struggling with grave
economic problems, has been torn by increas
ing violence staged by both leftist and rightist
extremists.
Communists, Socialists, Republicans and
others who favor Communist participation in
the government voted to remove support for
the minority, church-backed Christian Demo
crats who have ruled Italy alone or in coalition
since 1945.
The likelihood of Communists sharing
power in this NATO country aroused in
creased concern in Washington.
"We do not favor such participation and
would like to see Communist influence in any
Western European country reduced," said a
State Department paper read to reporters by
press officer John Trattner.
USSR accused of intervention
Washington — President Jimmy Carter ac
cused the Soviet Union yesterday of sending
"some men" as well as large shipments of arms
to Ethiopia in its clash with Somalia.
The president did not say whether the Rus

sians in Ethiopia were technicians, military ad
visers or troops. He reaffirmed, at the same
time, that Cubans were also involved in the
war over the Ogaden region.
"We have taken a position concerning Africa
that we would use our influence to bring about
peace without shipping arms to the disputing
parties and without injecting ourselves into
disputes that can be best resolved by Afri
cans," Carter said.
"The Soviets have done just the opposite,"
he said, and urged the Russians to join with the
United States in in supporting immediate
negotiations to end the dispute.
Carter also predicted that Congress will ap
prove a national energy program early in this
coming session "of which we can be proud."
Unexpected storm to continue
San Francisco — A rainstorm, that surprised
San Francisco Bay area weather forecasters
who expected to be greeted by clear skies yes
terday morning, promised to continue soaking
Northern California for a few more days.
National Weather Service forecaster Bill De
nney said no more than a quarter inch of rain
had fallen in most areas by mid-afternoon. But
the rain was expected to continue through to
morrow, with scattered showers Sunday.
"I think it'll be as big overall as the storms
we've been having in the past two or three
weeks," Denney said. Those storms have
dumped so much rain on the drought-weary
state that season rainfall totals surpass normal
for most California points.
Wholesale prices rise 6.6%
Washington — Pushed by higher food costs,
wholesale prices increased 0.7 percent in De
cember and brought the total increase for the
year to 6.6 percent, the government reported
yesterday.
The 12-month price rise was twice the 3.3
percent gain in 1976and reflected a quickening
in the pace of inflation during the year, al
though it was in line with government fore
casts.
Prices of foods ready for the consumer rose
by 1.5 percent in December, up from an 0.4
percent gain in November and the biggest
one-month jump in seven months.
The December rise in food prices signaled
higher grocery bills for consumers, especially
for pork, poultry and vegetable oil products,
all of which rose substantially.
Prices also increased for fish and dairy pro
ducts, processed fruits and vegetables, and
eggs, while there were declines for fresh and
dried vegetables, fresh fruits and coffee.

Ed Davis turns in his badge
Los Angeles — Police Chief Edward Davis,
feisty to the end, turned in his badge yesterday
with a blast at two former New York police
commissioners for "chickening out'' of the
competition to succeed him.
The dapper, white-haired Davis played to
television cameras as he tossed his badge on a
desk and began joking about the good fishing
in Sacramento's American River. Sacramento,
of course, is where Davis would like to move
after the next gubernatorial election in 1978.
When reporters commented that he seemed
confident of going to Sacramento, Davis re
plied: "I'll probably be going there several
times — but I might not get to stay."
Davis, 61, said he was confident about win
ning the Republican primary next )une but said
the "general election would be more dif
ficult."
Gas from coal possible by 1990
Paulsboro, N.J. — The production of high
quality, unleaded gasoline from coal rather
than oil may be economically feasible by 1990,
officials of one of the nation's largest oil firms
said yesterday.
Mobil Oil Co. officials, at a news conference
in this south New Jersey town, released details
of a patented process that transforms coal to
alcohol and then to high-octane unleaded
gasoline. Development of the process was an
nounced about a year ago, but until yesterday
details were scarce.
John Wise, a Mobil vice president, said that
the new gasoline "wouid cost 40 to 50 cents
more per gallon than gasoline made from oil,
but with oil becoming more and more scarce,
we think the process will be economically feas
ible within 10 to 20 years."
Other groups also are developing new ways
of producing gasoline. One of the most prom
ising is the fermentation of agricultural pro
ducts such as sugar cane into ethyl alcohol
which then could be mixed with conventional
gasoline.
Computers to aid smog control
Los Angeles — The state Air Resources Board
(ARB) said yesterday a drive-through system
that checks automobile smog control devices
with a computer could bring both air pollution
and over-priced mechanics to a choking halt in
Southern California.
The 10-minute inspection program would be
more effective in reducing smog than any
mass-transit system, ARB Chairman Tom
Quinn said. He added that computerized
readouts on malfunctioning smog devices

would discourage mechanics who charge for
unnecessary repairs.
Quinn added that by next January, the mul
timillion dollar inspection program would be
expanded from Riverside County to five other
counties — Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernar
dino, Ventura and Santa Barbara.
He said the 17 inspection stations — which
resemble car washes — will screen cars up for
sale, as required under state law.
Flu experts advise vaccine
Washington — The government's flu experts
agreed yesterday that a vaccine to protect
Americans from Russian flu should be part of
any flu immunization program for the upcom
ing flu season.
In a series of recommendations that will go
to U.S. Surgeon General Julius Richmond, the
medical and scientific panel said it expects the
influenza strain that has swept across the
Soviet Union and into Finland, Czechoslovakia
and China to break out in the United States
sometime this year or next.
The 75 experts, gathered from the various
agencies within the U.S. Public Health Service,
reached a consensus that a vaccine containing
at least the Russian flu virus and possibly pro
tection against other strains should be re
commended primarily for persons 50 years old
or older and secondarily for the chronically ill
in other age groups.
Studies indicate that people under 24 years
old who have never been exposed to a relative
of the Russian virus that hit the United States
between 1947 and 1956 have little or no immun
ity from the new Soviet strain.
Korchnoi to play for chess title
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — Victor Korchnoi,
former Soviet chess champion now in exile,
won the right yesterday to play Anatoly Karpov
of the Soviet Union for his world chess title by
defeating Boris Spassky in the challengers' fi
nals.
Spassky, a former world champion, resigned
the adjourned 18th game of the match im
mediately after play was resumed and his sea
led 41st move of Wednesday was opened. This
gave Korchnoi a winning score of 10.5 to 7.5
points.
Today's weather
Periods of rain likely through tomorrow.
Lows upper 40s to mid-50s. Highs mid-50s to
rnid-60s. Small craft advisory for southerly
winds increasing to 15 to 30 mph today.
Chance of measurable rain 80 percent today,
60 percent tonight.

with a blast at two former New York police
commissioners for "chickening out'' of the
competition to succeed him.
The dapper, white-haired Davis played to
television cameras as he tossed his badge on a
desk and began joking about the good fishing
in Sacramento's American River. Sacramento,
of course, is where Davis would like to move
after the next gubernatorial election in 1978.
When reporters commented that he seemed
confident of going to Sacramento, Davis re
plied: "I'll probably be going there several
times — but I might not get to stay."
Davis, 61, said he was confident about win
ning the Republican primary next )une but said
the "general election would be more dif
ficult."
Gas from coal possible by 1990
Paulsboro, N.J. — The production of high
quality, unleaded gasoline from coal rather
than oil may be economically feasible by 1990,
officials of one of the nation's largest oil firms
said yesterday.
Mobil Oil Co. officials, at a news conference
in this south New Jersey town, released details
of a patented process that transforms coal to
alcohol and then to high-octane unleaded
gasoline. Development of the process was an
nounced about a year ago, but until yesterday
details were scarce.
John Wise, a Mobil vice president, said that
the new gasoline "wouid cost 40 to 50 cents
more per gallon than gasoline made from oil,
but with oil becoming more and more scarce,
we think the process will be economically feas
ible within 10 to 20 years."
Other groups also are developing new ways
of producing gasoline. One of the most prom
ising is the fermentation of agricultural pro
ducts such as sugar cane into ethyl alcohol
which then could be mixed with conventional
gasoline.
Computers to aid smog control
Los Angeles — The state Air Resources Board
(ARB) said yesterday a drive-through system
that checks automobile smog control devices
with a computer could bring both air pollution
and over-priced mechanics to a choking halt in
Southern California.
The 10-minute inspection program would be
more effective in reducing smog than any
mass-transit system, ARB Chairman Tom
Quinn said. He added that computerized
readouts on malfunctioning smog devices

would discourage mechanics who charge for
unnecessary repairs.
Quinn added that by next January, the mul
timillion dollar inspection program would be
expanded from Riverside County to five other
counties — Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernar
dino, Ventura and Santa Barbara.
He said the 17 inspection stations — which
resemble car washes — will screen cars up for
sale, as required under state law.
Flu experts advise vaccine
Washington — The government's flu experts
agreed yesterday that a vaccine to protect
Americans from Russian flu should be part of
any flu immunization program for the upcom
ing flu season.
In a series of recommendations that will go
to U.S. Surgeon General Julius Richmond, the
medical and scientific panel said it expects the
influenza strain that has swept across the
Soviet Union and into Finland, Czechoslovakia
and China to break out in the United States
sometime this year or next.
The 75 experts, gathered from the various
agencies within the U.S. Public Health Service,
reached a consensus that a vaccine containing
at least the Russian flu virus and possibly pro
tection against other strains should be re
commended primarily for persons 50 years old
or older and secondarily for the chronically ill
in other age groups.
Studies indicate that people under 24 years
old who have never been exposed to a relative
of the Russian virus that hit the United States
between 1947 and 1956 have little or no immun
ity from the new Soviet strain.
Korchnoi to play for chess title
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — Victor Korchnoi,
former Soviet chess champion now in exile,
won the right yesterday to play Anatoly Karpov
of the Soviet Union for his world chess title by
defeating Boris Spassky in the challengers' fi
nals.
Spassky, a former world champion, resigned
the adjourned 18th game of the match im
mediately after play was resumed and his sea
led 41st move of Wednesday was opened. This
gave Korchnoi a winning score of 10.5 to 7.5
points.
Today's weather
Periods of rain likely through tomorrow.
Lows upper 40s to mid-50s. Highs mid-50s to
rnid-60s. Small craft advisory for southerly
winds increasing to 15 to 30 mph today.
Chance of measurable rain 80 percent today,
60 percent tonight.
Egypt, Israel trade proposals
Cairo — Egypt and Israel traded proposals
yesterday for future security in the Sinai Penin
sula but made no progress on the key issue of
Jewish settlements in that desert region. The
defense chiefs of the two nations insisted,
however, that an answer can be found.
The two sides "are not too far apart and
determined to bridge the gap," said Egyptian
War Minister Mohammed Abdel Ghany
Gamassy. Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weiz
man nodded: "There is a possibility to bridge
the gap."
Weizman and Gamassy held a news confer
ence together on the palm-shaded front lawn
of the Tahra Palace, where their joint commit
tee had just completed a 3V2-hour session on
the second day of talks on military aspects of a
peace agreement.
Weizman reaffirmed the Israeli position that
it wants to keep its 20 settlements in the Sinai
as a means of ensuring its security even after
the peninsula is returned to Egypt.
Gamassy, restating Egypt's demand that all
Israelis evacuate the Sinai, retorted that
Egypt's international borders were not subject
to "discussion or bargaining."
Italian premier may resign
Rome — The possibility of Communists shar
ing power in Italy's government increased yes
terday with word that Premier Giulio Andreot
ti's struggling Christian Democrat administra
tion was preparing to resign.
The country, struggling with grave
economic problems, has been torn by increas
ing violence staged by both leftist and rightist
extremists.
Communists, Socialists, Republicans and
others who favor Communist participation in
the government voted to remove support for
the minority, church-backed Christian Demo
crats who have ruled Italy alone or in coalition
since 1945.
The likelihood of Communists sharing
power in this NATO country aroused in
creased concern in Washington.
"We do not favor such participation and
would like to see Communist influence in any
Western European country reduced," said a
State Department paper read to reporters by
press officer John Trattner.
USSR accused of intervention
Washington — President Jimmy Carter ac
cused the Soviet Union yesterday of sending
"some men" as well as large shipments of arms
to Ethiopia in its clash with Somalia.
The president did not say whether the Rus

sians in Ethiopia were technicians, military ad
visers or troops. He reaffirmed, at the same
time, that Cubans were also involved in the
war over the Ogaden region.
"We have taken a position concerning Africa
that we would use our influence to bring about
peace without shipping arms to the disputing
parties and without injecting ourselves into
disputes that can be best resolved by Afri
cans," Carter said.
"The Soviets have done just the opposite,"
he said, and urged the Russians to join with the
United States in in supporting immediate
negotiations to end the dispute.
Carter also predicted that Congress will ap
prove a national energy program early in this
coming session "of which we can be proud."
Unexpected storm to continue
San Francisco — A rainstorm, that surprised
San Francisco Bay area weather forecasters
who expected to be greeted by clear skies yes
terday morning, promised to continue soaking
Northern California for a few more days.
National Weather Service forecaster Bill De
nney said no more than a quarter inch of rain
had fallen in most areas by mid-afternoon. But
the rain was expected to continue through to
morrow, with scattered showers Sunday.
"I think it'll be as big overall as the storms
we've been having in the past two or three
weeks," Denney said. Those storms have
dumped so much rain on the drought-weary
state that season rainfall totals surpass normal
for most California points.
Wholesale prices rise 6.6%
Washington — Pushed by higher food costs,
wholesale prices increased 0.7 percent in De
cember and brought the total increase for the
year to 6.6 percent, the government reported
yesterday.
The 12-month price rise was twice the 3.3
percent gain in 1976and reflected a quickening
in the pace of inflation during the year, al
though it was in line with government fore
casts.
Prices of foods ready for the consumer rose
by 1.5 percent in December, up from an 0.4
percent gain in November and the biggest
one-month jump in seven months.
The December rise in food prices signaled
higher grocery bills for consumers, especially
for pork, poultry and vegetable oil products,
all of which rose substantially.
Prices also increased for fish and dairy pro
ducts, processed fruits and vegetables, and
eggs, while there were declines for fresh and
dried vegetables, fresh fruits and coffee.

Egypt, Israel trade proposals
Cairo — Egypt and Israel traded proposals
yesterday for future security in the Sinai Penin
sula but made no progress on the key issue of
Jewish settlements in that desert region. The
defense chiefs of the two nations insisted,
however, that an answer can be found.
The two sides "are not too far apart and
determined to bridge the gap," said Egyptian
War Minister Mohammed Abdel Ghany
Gamassy. Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weiz
man nodded: "There is a possibility to bridge
the gap."
Weizman and Gamassy held a news confer
ence together on the palm-shaded front lawn
of the Tahra Palace, where their joint commit
tee had just completed a 3V2-hour session on
the second day of talks on military aspects of a
peace agreement.
Weizman reaffirmed the Israeli position that
it wants to keep its 20 settlements in the Sinai
as a means of ensuring its security even after
the peninsula is returned to Egypt.
Gamassy, restating Egypt's demand that all
Israelis evacuate the Sinai, retorted that
Egypt's international borders were not subject
to "discussion or bargaining."
Italian premier may resign
Rome — The possibility of Communists shar
ing power in Italy's government increased yes
terday with word that Premier Giulio Andreot
ti's struggling Christian Democrat administra
tion was preparing to resign.
The country, struggling with grave
economic problems, has been torn by increas
ing violence staged by both leftist and rightist
extremists.
Communists, Socialists, Republicans and
others who favor Communist participation in
the government voted to remove support for
the minority, church-backed Christian Demo
crats who have ruled Italy alone or in coalition
since 1945.
The likelihood of Communists sharing
power in this NATO country aroused in
creased concern in Washington.
"We do not favor such participation and
would like to see Communist influence in any
Western European country reduced," said a
State Department paper read to reporters by
press officer John Trattner.
USSR accused of intervention
Washington — President Jimmy Carter ac
cused the Soviet Union yesterday of sending
"some men" as well as large shipments of arms
to Ethiopia in its clash with Somalia.
The president did not say whether the Rus

sians in Ethiopia were technicians, military ad
visers or troops. He reaffirmed, at the same
time, that Cubans were also involved in the
war over the Ogaden region.
"We have taken a position concerning Africa
that we would use our influence to bring about
peace without shipping arms to the disputing
parties and without injecting ourselves into
disputes that can be best resolved by Afri
cans," Carter said.
"The Soviets have done just the opposite,"
he said, and urged the Russians to join with the
United States in in supporting immediate
negotiations to end the dispute.
Carter also predicted that Congress will ap
prove a national energy program early in this
coming session "of which we can be proud."
Unexpected storm to continue
San Francisco — A rainstorm, that surprised
San Francisco Bay area weather forecasters
who expected to be greeted by clear skies yes
terday morning, promised to continue soaking
Northern California for a few more days.
National Weather Service forecaster Bill De
nney said no more than a quarter inch of rain
had fallen in most areas by mid-afternoon. But
the rain was expected to continue through to
morrow, with scattered showers Sunday.
"I think it'll be as big overall as the storms
we've been having in the past two or three
weeks," Denney said. Those storms have
dumped so much rain on the drought-weary
state that season rainfall totals surpass normal
for most California points.
Wholesale prices rise 6.6%
Washington — Pushed by higher food costs,
wholesale prices increased 0.7 percent in De
cember and brought the total increase for the
year to 6.6 percent, the government reported
yesterday.
The 12-month price rise was twice the 3.3
percent gain in 1976and reflected a quickening
in the pace of inflation during the year, al
though it was in line with government fore
casts.
Prices of foods ready for the consumer rose
by 1.5 percent in December, up from an 0.4
percent gain in November and the biggest
one-month jump in seven months.
The December rise in food prices signaled
higher grocery bills for consumers, especially
for pork, poultry and vegetable oil products,
all of which rose substantially.
Prices also increased for fish and dairy pro
ducts, processed fruits and vegetables, and
eggs, while there were declines for fresh and
dried vegetables, fresh fruits and coffee.

Ed Davis turns in his badge
Los Angeles — Police Chief Edward Davis,
feisty to the end, turned in his badge yesterday
with a blast at two former New York police
commissioners for "chickening out'' of the
competition to succeed him.
The dapper, white-haired Davis played to
television cameras as he tossed his badge on a
desk and began joking about the good fishing
in Sacramento's American River. Sacramento,
of course, is where Davis would like to move
after the next gubernatorial election in 1978.
When reporters commented that he seemed
confident of going to Sacramento, Davis re
plied: "I'll probably be going there several
times — but I might not get to stay."
Davis, 61, said he was confident about win
ning the Republican primary next )une but said
the "general election would be more dif
ficult."
Gas from coal possible by 1990
Paulsboro, N.J. — The production of high
quality, unleaded gasoline from coal rather
than oil may be economically feasible by 1990,
officials of one of the nation's largest oil firms
said yesterday.
Mobil Oil Co. officials, at a news conference
in this south New Jersey town, released details
of a patented process that transforms coal to
alcohol and then to high-octane unleaded
gasoline. Development of the process was an
nounced about a year ago, but until yesterday
details were scarce.
John Wise, a Mobil vice president, said that
the new gasoline "wouid cost 40 to 50 cents
more per gallon than gasoline made from oil,
but with oil becoming more and more scarce,
we think the process will be economically feas
ible within 10 to 20 years."
Other groups also are developing new ways
of producing gasoline. One of the most prom
ising is the fermentation of agricultural pro
ducts such as sugar cane into ethyl alcohol
which then could be mixed with conventional
gasoline.
Computers to aid smog control
Los Angeles — The state Air Resources Board
(ARB) said yesterday a drive-through system
that checks automobile smog control devices
with a computer could bring both air pollution
and over-priced mechanics to a choking halt in
Southern California.
The 10-minute inspection program would be
more effective in reducing smog than any
mass-transit system, ARB Chairman Tom
Quinn said. He added that computerized
readouts on malfunctioning smog devices

would discourage mechanics who charge for
unnecessary repairs.
Quinn added that by next January, the mul
timillion dollar inspection program would be
expanded from Riverside County to five other
counties — Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernar
dino, Ventura and Santa Barbara.
He said the 17 inspection stations — which
resemble car washes — will screen cars up for
sale, as required under state law.
Flu experts advise vaccine
Washington — The government's flu experts
agreed yesterday that a vaccine to protect
Americans from Russian flu should be part of
any flu immunization program for the upcom
ing flu season.
In a series of recommendations that will go
to U.S. Surgeon General Julius Richmond, the
medical and scientific panel said it expects the
influenza strain that has swept across the
Soviet Union and into Finland, Czechoslovakia
and China to break out in the United States
sometime this year or next.
The 75 experts, gathered from the various
agencies within the U.S. Public Health Service,
reached a consensus that a vaccine containing
at least the Russian flu virus and possibly pro
tection against other strains should be re
commended primarily for persons 50 years old
or older and secondarily for the chronically ill
in other age groups.
Studies indicate that people under 24 years
old who have never been exposed to a relative
of the Russian virus that hit the United States
between 1947 and 1956 have little or no immun
ity from the new Soviet strain.
Korchnoi to play for chess title
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — Victor Korchnoi,
former Soviet chess champion now in exile,
won the right yesterday to play Anatoly Karpov
of the Soviet Union for his world chess title by
defeating Boris Spassky in the challengers' fi
nals.
Spassky, a former world champion, resigned
the adjourned 18th game of the match im
mediately after play was resumed and his sea
led 41st move of Wednesday was opened. This
gave Korchnoi a winning score of 10.5 to 7.5
points.

Periods of rain likely through tomorrow.
Lows upper 40s to mid-50s. Highs mid-50s to

feisty to the end, turned in his badge yesterday
with a blast at two former New York police
commissioners for "chickening out'' of the
competition to succeed him.
The dapper, white-haired Davis played to
television cameras as he tossed his badge on a
desk and began joking about the good fishing
in Sacramento's American River. Sacramento,
of course, is where Davis would like to move
after the next gubernatorial election in 1978.
When reporters commented that he seemed
confident of going to Sacramento, Davis re
plied: "I'll probably be going there several
times — but I might not get to stay."
Davis, 61, said he was confident about win
ning the Republican primary next )une but said
the "general election would be more dif
ficult."
Gas from coal possible by 1990
Paulsboro, N.J. — The production of high
quality, unleaded gasoline from coal rather
than oil may be economically feasible by 1990,
officials of one of the nation's largest oil firms
said yesterday.
Mobil Oil Co. officials, at a news conference
in this south New Jersey town, released details
of a patented process that transforms coal to
alcohol and then to high-octane unleaded
gasoline. Development of the process was an
nounced about a year ago, but until yesterday
details were scarce.
John Wise, a Mobil vice president, said that
the new gasoline "wouid cost 40 to 50 cents
more per gallon than gasoline made from oil,
but with oil becoming more and more scarce,
we think the process will be economically feas
ible within 10 to 20 years."
Other groups also are developing new ways
of producing gasoline. One of the most prom
ising is the fermentation of agricultural pro
ducts such as sugar cane into ethyl alcohol
which then could be mixed with conventional
gasoline.
Computers to aid smog control
Los Angeles — The state Air Resources Board
(ARB) said yesterday a drive-through system
that checks automobile smog control devices
with a computer could bring both air pollution
and over-priced mechanics to a choking halt in
Southern California.
The 10-minute inspection program would be
more effective in reducing smog than any
mass-transit system, ARB Chairman Tom
Quinn said. He added that computerized
readouts on malfunctioning smog devices

would discourage mechanics who charge for
unnecessary repairs.
Quinn added that by next January, the mul
timillion dollar inspection program would be
expanded from Riverside County to five other
counties — Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernar
dino, Ventura and Santa Barbara.
He said the 17 inspection stations — which
resemble car washes — will screen cars up for
sale, as required under state law.
Flu experts advise vaccine
Washington — The government's flu experts
agreed yesterday that a vaccine to protect
Americans from Russian flu should be part of
any flu immunization program for the upcom
ing flu season.
In a series of recommendations that will go
to U.S. Surgeon General Julius Richmond, the
medical and scientific panel said it expects the
influenza strain that has swept across the
Soviet Union and into Finland, Czechoslovakia
and China to break out in the United States
sometime this year or next.
The 75 experts, gathered from the various
agencies within the U.S. Public Health Service,
reached a consensus that a vaccine containing
at least the Russian flu virus and possibly pro
tection against other strains should be re
commended primarily for persons 50 years old
or older and secondarily for the chronically ill
in other age groups.
Studies indicate that people under 24 years
old who have never been exposed to a relative
of the Russian virus that hit the United States
between 1947 and 1956 have little or no immun
ity from the new Soviet strain.
Korchnoi to play for chess title
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — Victor Korchnoi,
former Soviet chess champion now in exile,
won the right yesterday to play Anatoly Karpov
of the Soviet Union for his world chess title by
defeating Boris Spassky in the challengers' fi
nals.
Spassky, a former world champion, resigned
the adjourned 18th game of the match im
mediately after play was resumed and his sea
led 41st move of Wednesday was opened. This
gave Korchnoi a winning score of 10.5 to 7.5
points.
Today's weather
Periods of rain likely through tomorrow.
Lows upper 40s to mid-50s. Highs mid-50s to
rnid-60s. Small craft advisory for southerly
winds increasing to 15 to 30 mph today.
Chance of measurable rain 80 percent today,
60 percent tonight.
Egypt, Israel trade proposals
Cairo — Egypt and Israel traded proposals
yesterday for future security in the Sinai Penin
sula but made no progress on the key issue of
Jewish settlements in that desert region. The
defense chiefs of the two nations insisted,
however, that an answer can be found.
The two sides "are not too far apart and
determined to bridge the gap," said Egyptian
War Minister Mohammed Abdel Ghany
Gamassy. Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weiz
man nodded: "There is a possibility to bridge
the gap."
Weizman and Gamassy held a news confer
ence together on the palm-shaded front lawn
of the Tahra Palace, where their joint commit
tee had just completed a 3V2-hour session on
the second day of talks on military aspects of a
peace agreement.
Weizman reaffirmed the Israeli position that
it wants to keep its 20 settlements in the Sinai
as a means of ensuring its security even after
the peninsula is returned to Egypt.
Gamassy, restating Egypt's demand that all
Israelis evacuate the Sinai, retorted that
Egypt's international borders were not subject
to "discussion or bargaining."
Italian premier may resign
Rome — The possibility of Communists shar
ing power in Italy's government increased yes
terday with word that Premier Giulio Andreot
ti's struggling Christian Democrat administra
tion was preparing to resign.
The country, struggling with grave
economic problems, has been torn by increas
ing violence staged by both leftist and rightist
extremists.
Communists, Socialists, Republicans and
others who favor Communist participation in
the government voted to remove support for
the minority, church-backed Christian Demo
crats who have ruled Italy alone or in coalition
since 1945.
The likelihood of Communists sharing
power in this NATO country aroused in
creased concern in Washington.
"We do not favor such participation and
would like to see Communist influence in any
Western European country reduced," said a
State Department paper read to reporters by
press officer John Trattner.
USSR accused of intervention
Washington — President Jimmy Carter ac
cused the Soviet Union yesterday of sending
"some men" as well as large shipments of arms
to Ethiopia in its clash with Somalia.
The president did not say whether the Rus

sians in Ethiopia were technicians, military ad
visers or troops. He reaffirmed, at the same
time, that Cubans were also involved in the
war over the Ogaden region.
"We have taken a position concerning Africa
that we would use our influence to bring about
peace without shipping arms to the disputing
parties and without injecting ourselves into
disputes that can be best resolved by Afri
cans," Carter said.
"The Soviets have done just the opposite,"
he said, and urged the Russians to join with the
United States in in supporting immediate
negotiations to end the dispute.
Carter also predicted that Congress will ap
prove a national energy program early in this
coming session "of which we can be proud."
Unexpected storm to continue
San Francisco — A rainstorm, that surprised
San Francisco Bay area weather forecasters
who expected to be greeted by clear skies yes
terday morning, promised to continue soaking
Northern California for a few more days.
National Weather Service forecaster Bill De
nney said no more than a quarter inch of rain
had fallen in most areas by mid-afternoon. But
the rain was expected to continue through to
morrow, with scattered showers Sunday.
"I think it'll be as big overall as the storms
we've been having in the past two or three
weeks," Denney said. Those storms have
dumped so much rain on the drought-weary
state that season rainfall totals surpass normal
for most California points.
Wholesale prices rise 6.6%
Washington — Pushed by higher food costs,
wholesale prices increased 0.7 percent in De
cember and brought the total increase for the
year to 6.6 percent, the government reported
yesterday.
The 12-month price rise was twice the 3.3
percent gain in 1976and reflected a quickening
in the pace of inflation during the year, al
though it was in line with government fore
casts.
Prices of foods ready for the consumer rose
by 1.5 percent in December, up from an 0.4
percent gain in November and the biggest
one-month jump in seven months.
The December rise in food prices signaled
higher grocery bills for consumers, especially
for pork, poultry and vegetable oil products,
all of which rose substantially.
Prices also increased for fish and dairy pro
ducts, processed fruits and vegetables, and
eggs, while there were declines for fresh and
dried vegetables, fresh fruits and coffee.
