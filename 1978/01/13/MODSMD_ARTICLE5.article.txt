# Rape-don't just scream for help
## 
### Janet Bailey 
There is more to rape prevention than
screaming for help, according to several
groups at Stanford concerned with the
prevention of rape.
Planned improvements in lighting, in
creased police patrols, a booklet by a
SWOPSI collective, an emergency re
sponse service of professional coun
selors, and a preventive rape education
program in the planning stage are some
of the responses to the problem of as
saults on campus.
"Without creating an environment of
fear, we want to make people aware of
precautions they can take to protect
themselves, and identify resources that
exist to help people who are attacked,"
said Alice Supton, assistant dean for resi
dential education.
Supton's department is one of several
working together with Stanford police
and Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices at Cowell to establish a rape educa
tion program here.
Leah Kaplan, assistant dean of student
affairs, said the program is being mod
eled after one at Berkeley. Kaplan coor
dinated an October meeting between the
director of Berkeley's program and some
members of the Stanford staff.
An effective rape prevention program
must include "more than a do's and

don'ts safety list, though that is helpful,"
said Supton. "We need to deal with why
rape happens and how to live with it."
Analysis
"Working Against Rape" is a booklet
being printed as an outgrowth of last
spring's SWOPSI 179, Workshop on
Sexism. The booklet includes a feminist
analysis of rape, as well as sections on
self-defense, practical prevention, and
options of the rape victim.
Its authors, a collective of Stanford
area women, hope to use the book in
conjunction with workshops and discus
sions directed at students, faculty and
staff, both male and female.
Involvement of men is an essential as
pect to the program being planned for
Stanford. "Most people don't realize that
rape involves two victims — the woman
and her partner," said Kaplan. A publica
tion by the Berkeley committee states
that if a rape victim has a boyfriend or
husband, there is a 90 percent chance
that the relationship will break up within
a year after the rape.
Attention must be paid to the "debunk
ing of myths surrounding rape," said
Supton. "Many rapes are not in secluded
dark alleys. And in many instances the
woman will know her attacker."
"We want to stress that rape is an act of
violence, not a sexual act," said Kaplan.

Breaking down the myth that a woman
is asking for rape by provocative behavior
can help to relieve much of the guilt felt
by rape victims, said Supton.
Campus safety
Efforts are being made to improve the
safety of the campus. Following an inci
dent last quarter when a man climbed
through a window into a woman's room
at Roble Hall, bolts have been put on
first-floor windows and extra lighting has
been installed.
"Within the next couple of months,
we'd like to put window bolts in other
dorms where there is access to the first
floor," said Robert Ramirez, University
housing manager.
"We also want to install more lighting
in areas where people inform us lighting
is insufficient," Ramirez said. He said his
office is producing a list of such areas.
The Police Services has increased its
patrolling of dorms and of the Quad, ac
cording to Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Individuals can take many safety pre
cautions that are "common sense," said
Niemeyer. Persons should walk with a
companion at night and keep to well
lighted routes Doors and windows of
rooms should be kept locked. Before en
tering her car, a woman should check the
back seat to make sure no one is hiding
and keep car doors locked. Persons are

advised not to jog alone in deserted areas
even during the day. Anything suspicious
should be reported to police.
Reaction
How to react to an attacker depends on
the situation — whether he is armed and
where the attack occurs, said Sgt. De
borah Marinaro. Marinaro has led discus
sions in several dorms since the Roble
incident.
The Stanford Bookstore stocks "shriek
alarms," high-powered whistles de
signed to frighten off an attacker. Mace
was legalized in California last year, and
persons who complete an instruction
course may be certified to purchase and
carry mace. The College of San Mateo is
currently the only location in the Stanford
area which offers such instruction.
Support available to rape victims has
also been increased. Several male and
female staff members from Counseling
and Psychological Services are on call to
serve as advocates for rape victims of
either sex, and to be present with them
during questioning.
"One thing all of us feel is that rape is
not just a women's problem," said Sup
ton. "Part of our concern is to encourage
discussion about sex roles and sexuality.
"What we can do in dorms is sensitize
both women and men to attitudes that
devalue women and contribute to rape."

been installed.
"Within the next couple of months,
we'd like to put window bolts in other
dorms where there is access to the first
floor," said Robert Ramirez, University
housing manager.
"We also want to install more lighting
in areas where people inform us lighting
is insufficient," Ramirez said. He said his
office is producing a list of such areas.
The Police Services has increased its
patrolling of dorms and of the Quad, ac
cording to Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Individuals can take many safety pre
cautions that are "common sense," said
Niemeyer. Persons should walk with a
companion at night and keep to well
lighted routes Doors and windows of
rooms should be kept locked. Before en
tering her car, a woman should check the
back seat to make sure no one is hiding
and keep car doors locked. Persons are

advised not to jog alone in deserted areas
even during the day. Anything suspicious
should be reported to police.
Reaction
How to react to an attacker depends on
the situation — whether he is armed and
where the attack occurs, said Sgt. De
borah Marinaro. Marinaro has led discus
sions in several dorms since the Roble
incident.
The Stanford Bookstore stocks "shriek
alarms," high-powered whistles de
signed to frighten off an attacker. Mace
was legalized in California last year, and
persons who complete an instruction
course may be certified to purchase and
carry mace. The College of San Mateo is
currently the only location in the Stanford
area which offers such instruction.
Support available to rape victims has
also been increased. Several male and
female staff members from Counseling
and Psychological Services are on call to
serve as advocates for rape victims of
either sex, and to be present with them
during questioning.
"One thing all of us feel is that rape is
not just a women's problem," said Sup
ton. "Part of our concern is to encourage
discussion about sex roles and sexuality.
"What we can do in dorms is sensitize
both women and men to attitudes that
devalue women and contribute to rape."
There is more to rape prevention than
screaming for help, according to several
groups at Stanford concerned with the
prevention of rape.
Planned improvements in lighting, in
creased police patrols, a booklet by a
SWOPSI collective, an emergency re
sponse service of professional coun
selors, and a preventive rape education
program in the planning stage are some
of the responses to the problem of as
saults on campus.
"Without creating an environment of
fear, we want to make people aware of
precautions they can take to protect
themselves, and identify resources that
exist to help people who are attacked,"
said Alice Supton, assistant dean for resi
dential education.
Supton's department is one of several
working together with Stanford police
and Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices at Cowell to establish a rape educa
tion program here.
Leah Kaplan, assistant dean of student
affairs, said the program is being mod
eled after one at Berkeley. Kaplan coor
dinated an October meeting between the
director of Berkeley's program and some
members of the Stanford staff.
An effective rape prevention program
must include "more than a do's and

don'ts safety list, though that is helpful,"
said Supton. "We need to deal with why
rape happens and how to live with it."
Analysis
"Working Against Rape" is a booklet
being printed as an outgrowth of last
spring's SWOPSI 179, Workshop on
Sexism. The booklet includes a feminist
analysis of rape, as well as sections on
self-defense, practical prevention, and
options of the rape victim.
Its authors, a collective of Stanford
area women, hope to use the book in
conjunction with workshops and discus
sions directed at students, faculty and
staff, both male and female.
Involvement of men is an essential as
pect to the program being planned for
Stanford. "Most people don't realize that
rape involves two victims — the woman
and her partner," said Kaplan. A publica
tion by the Berkeley committee states
that if a rape victim has a boyfriend or
husband, there is a 90 percent chance
that the relationship will break up within
a year after the rape.
Attention must be paid to the "debunk
ing of myths surrounding rape," said
Supton. "Many rapes are not in secluded
dark alleys. And in many instances the
woman will know her attacker."
"We want to stress that rape is an act of
violence, not a sexual act," said Kaplan.

Breaking down the myth that a woman
is asking for rape by provocative behavior
can help to relieve much of the guilt felt
by rape victims, said Supton.

Efforts are being made to improve the
safety of the campus. Following an inci

through a window into a woman's room
at Roble Hall, bolts have been put on
