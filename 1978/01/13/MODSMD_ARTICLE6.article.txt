## How to stifle discussion 
### 
When dealing with a com
plex and emotionally charged
issue, one of the greatest
temptations of all is to stifle
discussion, and that's just
what the Board of Trustees has
done with its amendments to
the majority report of the ad
hoc Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility.
Following those changes,
both the ASSU Nominations
Committee and the ASSU Se
nate refused to appoint stu
dent members to the new CIR.
Those two parts of student
government aren't buying the
trustees' version of a Com
mission on Investment Re
sponsibility, and neither are
we.
The trustees availed them
selves of their right to make
changes in the ad hoc Com
mittee's report, but we take
issue with the nature of those
changes.
Persons need only read a
few sentences in the trustees'
unanimous new Statement on
Investment Responsibility to
see how unfairly the trustees
have dealt with both the new
CIR and the community.
The ad hoc CIR began sec
tion 1.2 with "the obligation
(of the trustees) to take ethical
factors into account when set
ting investment policies and
voting proxies. . ."
The trustees have
weakened this to "the author
ity to take ethical factors into
account. .
In Section 2.1(a), the ad hoc
CIR wrote the investment
manager would consider
"substantial social injury
caused by company activities
which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or pub
lic reaction."
The trustees have altered
that sentence to conclude
"subtantial social injury
caused by company activities
which in his or her (the in
vestment manager's) opinion
is likely to have a negative im
pact on the value of the in
vestments."
Lastly, for Section 2.2(a), the
ad hoc Committee decided
that in regard to a shareholder
proposal whose goal is to
eliminate or reduce substan
tial social injury, "the Univer
sity will vote for the proposal
and will vote against a prop
osal" that does not have this
goal.
To this phrase, the board
neatly appended "provided
such action is not inconsistent
with the trustees' fiduciary ob
ligations."
All these changes seem to

indicate that the trustees have
artfully begged the question
of investment responsibility
on which the CIR should be dis
cussing and making recom
mendations to the trustees.
At least five questions are
unanswered by the trustees
following their amending:
—What does the phrase
"fiduciary obligations" mean,
and who would realistically
and legally be able to take
what kind of action against the
trustees should they fail to
meet "fiduciary obligations"?
—If financial advisers, using
their expertise and judgment,
follow financial policies which
cause the University to lose
money, have the trustees
failed to meet their "fiduciary
obligations" just as if financial
personnel lost money by fol
lowing a policy of social re
sponsibility?
—Is there a line of conduct
which corporations must
cross before trustees will take
action, regardless of the pro
fitability of that corporation's
Stock?
—As soon as a stock of a
corporation causing substan
tial injury declines on the
stock market, can the trustees
then sell the stock because by
doing so they will not be con
travening their "fiduciary ob
ligations"?
—Does the phrase "nega
tive impact on the value of the
investment" refer to financial
value, moral value,
philosophical value, or some
other value? And since the
new ClR's reports are sup
posed to go directly to the
trustees instead of going to
administrators first, as was the
practice of the previous CIR,

does this phrase allow ad
ministrators to sidetrack or
impede a CIR recommenda
tion?
These questions all deal
with our concern for the
philosophy of the new CIR,
not the structure of the CIR
itself. By their changes, the
trustees seerrf to be leading
the ClR's discussion, instead
of allowing the CIR to lead its
own discussion.
Faced with such constraints
and double-edged phrases,
any student participation
would probably be an exer
cise in futility. The ASSU Se
nate and Nominations Com
mittee felt that a refusal to
nominate students to the new
CIR was the best course of ac
tion, and even though we
deem this a regrettable event,
we think this was virtually the
only action open to the ASSU.
The trustees' new statement
highlights a major problem in
the investment responsibility
conflict: the trustees' non
recognition of the necessity to
make open, unambiguous
and direct answers to many
questions.
Absent a clear understand
ing of just where the trustees
stand, and what they really
want from a CIR, it would be
almost farcical for students to
participate in this committee's
"discussion."
We hope that the trustees
will soon make these impera
tive formal answers and
.statements. In the meantime,
the ASSU will be holding an
informational meeting on this
matter next week, and we
urge students and members
of the community to attend.

have dealt with both the new
CIR and the community.
The ad hoc CIR began sec
tion 1.2 with "the obligation
(of the trustees) to take ethical
factors into account when set
ting investment policies and
voting proxies. . ."
The trustees have
weakened this to "the author
ity to take ethical factors into
account. .
In Section 2.1(a), the ad hoc
CIR wrote the investment
manager would consider
"substantial social injury
caused by company activities
which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or pub
lic reaction."
The trustees have altered
that sentence to conclude
"subtantial social injury
caused by company activities
which in his or her (the in
vestment manager's) opinion
is likely to have a negative im
pact on the value of the in
vestments."
Lastly, for Section 2.2(a), the
ad hoc Committee decided
that in regard to a shareholder
proposal whose goal is to
eliminate or reduce substan
tial social injury, "the Univer
sity will vote for the proposal
and will vote against a prop
osal" that does not have this
goal.
To this phrase, the board
neatly appended "provided
such action is not inconsistent
with the trustees' fiduciary ob
ligations."
All these changes seem to

indicate that the trustees have
artfully begged the question
of investment responsibility
on which the CIR should be dis
cussing and making recom
mendations to the trustees.
At least five questions are
unanswered by the trustees
following their amending:
—What does the phrase
"fiduciary obligations" mean,
and who would realistically
and legally be able to take
what kind of action against the
trustees should they fail to
meet "fiduciary obligations"?
—If financial advisers, using
their expertise and judgment,
follow financial policies which
cause the University to lose
money, have the trustees
failed to meet their "fiduciary
obligations" just as if financial
personnel lost money by fol
lowing a policy of social re
sponsibility?
—Is there a line of conduct
which corporations must
cross before trustees will take
action, regardless of the pro
fitability of that corporation's
Stock?
—As soon as a stock of a
corporation causing substan
tial injury declines on the
stock market, can the trustees
then sell the stock because by
doing so they will not be con
travening their "fiduciary ob
ligations"?
—Does the phrase "nega
tive impact on the value of the
investment" refer to financial
value, moral value,
philosophical value, or some
other value? And since the
new ClR's reports are sup
posed to go directly to the
trustees instead of going to
administrators first, as was the
practice of the previous CIR,

does this phrase allow ad
ministrators to sidetrack or
impede a CIR recommenda
tion?
These questions all deal
with our concern for the
philosophy of the new CIR,
not the structure of the CIR
itself. By their changes, the
trustees seerrf to be leading
the ClR's discussion, instead
of allowing the CIR to lead its
own discussion.
Faced with such constraints
and double-edged phrases,
any student participation
would probably be an exer
cise in futility. The ASSU Se
nate and Nominations Com
mittee felt that a refusal to
nominate students to the new
CIR was the best course of ac
tion, and even though we
deem this a regrettable event,
we think this was virtually the
only action open to the ASSU.
The trustees' new statement
highlights a major problem in
the investment responsibility
conflict: the trustees' non
recognition of the necessity to
make open, unambiguous
and direct answers to many
questions.
Absent a clear understand
ing of just where the trustees
stand, and what they really
want from a CIR, it would be
almost farcical for students to
participate in this committee's
"discussion."
We hope that the trustees
will soon make these impera
tive formal answers and
.statements. In the meantime,
the ASSU will be holding an
informational meeting on this
matter next week, and we
urge students and members
of the community to attend.
When dealing with a com
plex and emotionally charged
issue, one of the greatest
temptations of all is to stifle
discussion, and that's just
what the Board of Trustees has
done with its amendments to
the majority report of the ad
hoc Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility.
Following those changes,
both the ASSU Nominations
Committee and the ASSU Se
nate refused to appoint stu
dent members to the new CIR.
Those two parts of student
government aren't buying the
trustees' version of a Com
mission on Investment Re
sponsibility, and neither are
we.
The trustees availed them
selves of their right to make
changes in the ad hoc Com
mittee's report, but we take
issue with the nature of those
changes.

ad hoc Committee decided
that in regard to a shareholder
proposal whose goal is to
eliminate or reduce substan
tial social injury, "the Univer
sity will vote for the proposal
and will vote against a prop
osal" that does not have this
goal.
To this phrase, the board
neatly appended "provided
such action is not inconsistent
with the trustees' fiduciary ob
ligations."
All these changes seem to

indicate that the trustees have
artfully begged the question
of investment responsibility
on which the CIR should be dis
cussing and making recom
mendations to the trustees.
At least five questions are
unanswered by the trustees
following their amending:
—What does the phrase
"fiduciary obligations" mean,
and who would realistically
and legally be able to take
what kind of action against the
trustees should they fail to
meet "fiduciary obligations"?
—If financial advisers, using
their expertise and judgment,
follow financial policies which
cause the University to lose
money, have the trustees
failed to meet their "fiduciary
obligations" just as if financial
personnel lost money by fol
lowing a policy of social re
sponsibility?
—Is there a line of conduct
which corporations must
cross before trustees will take
action, regardless of the pro
fitability of that corporation's
Stock?
—As soon as a stock of a
corporation causing substan
tial injury declines on the
stock market, can the trustees
then sell the stock because by
doing so they will not be con
travening their "fiduciary ob
ligations"?
—Does the phrase "nega
tive impact on the value of the
investment" refer to financial
value, moral value,
philosophical value, or some
other value? And since the
new ClR's reports are sup
posed to go directly to the
trustees instead of going to
administrators first, as was the
practice of the previous CIR,

does this phrase allow ad
ministrators to sidetrack or
impede a CIR recommenda
tion?
These questions all deal
with our concern for the
philosophy of the new CIR,
not the structure of the CIR
itself. By their changes, the
trustees seerrf to be leading
the ClR's discussion, instead
of allowing the CIR to lead its
own discussion.
Faced with such constraints
and double-edged phrases,
any student participation
would probably be an exer
cise in futility. The ASSU Se
nate and Nominations Com
mittee felt that a refusal to
nominate students to the new
CIR was the best course of ac
tion, and even though we
deem this a regrettable event,
we think this was virtually the
only action open to the ASSU.
The trustees' new statement
highlights a major problem in
the investment responsibility
conflict: the trustees' non
recognition of the necessity to
make open, unambiguous
and direct answers to many
questions.
Absent a clear understand
ing of just where the trustees
stand, and what they really
want from a CIR, it would be
almost farcical for students to
participate in this committee's
"discussion."
We hope that the trustees
will soon make these impera
tive formal answers and
.statements. In the meantime,
the ASSU will be holding an
informational meeting on this
matter next week, and we
urge students and members
of the community to attend.
