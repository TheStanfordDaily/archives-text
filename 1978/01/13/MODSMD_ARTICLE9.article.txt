# Requirements relaxed
## Overseas campuses inferior 
### 
Erin Potter

Few will argue with the statement
that Stanford's overseas campuses
lack the academic intensity for which
the Palo Alto campus is so well
known. The one exception, perhaps,
is Paris where the student is offered
an intensive program at the Sor
bonne. The other campuses are
characterized by a minimum of
academic rigor and a plethora of di
verse "extracurricular" activities.
The Italian campus still offers all its
classes in English as the Stanford stu
dents gaze down upon Florence
from their self-sufficient hill-top
villa. And Cliveden is well known for

its isolated, "country clubbish" at
mosphere. Are the overseas cam
puses really the playground that so
many believe them to be?
The experiences offered to a Stan
ford student in the overseas program
are many and varied. The program
operates in such a way as to allow
each student to establish his own
priorities. If a student has chosen an
overseas campus as a base for Euro
pean travel, he will find that he can
spend the first seven weeks of the
quarter on trains and the last two
weeks completing his course work.
If, on the other hand, he prefers to

become intimately involved with the
community and country where he is
studying, he will find endless oppor
tunities for such involvement. Any
student desiring an intensive
academic program has the option of
setting up independent study pro
jects with one of his professors.
Thus, the individual student deter
mines where the emphasis will lie
during his stay overseas. In this
sense, the Stanford overseas prog
ram is without doubt beneficial.
The fact remains, however, that
the quality of academics overseas
fails to match that of the Palo Alto
campus. The inferior quality is not a
reflection of the personnel; some of
the overseas professors are among
Stanford's best. In most cases, it is
simply that much less is demanded of
the students. Instead of insisting that
the high academic standards which
characterize the institution be main
tained, Stanford has relaxed its re
quirements to the point where a stu
dent's overseas accomplishments
are viewed, and rightly so with much
skepticism.
Some might argue that the relaxa
tion of standards is essential in that it
allows students to choose their own
priorities during their stay overseas
(i.e. travel, vacation, community in
volvement, academics). But this is
precisely the issue involved.
The point is not to question the
value of these kinds of overseas ex
periences, but rather to question the
validity of Stanford's academic rec
ognition of such experiences. Might
it not be better to let the student dis
cover travel and culture on his own
and to establish overseas campuses
reflecting the high standards which
are the essence of Stanford?

community and country where he is
studying, he will find endless oppor
tunities for such involvement. Any
student desiring an intensive
academic program has the option of
setting up independent study pro
jects with one of his professors.
Thus, the individual student deter
mines where the emphasis will lie
during his stay overseas. In this
sense, the Stanford overseas prog
ram is without doubt beneficial.
The fact remains, however, that
the quality of academics overseas
fails to match that of the Palo Alto
campus. The inferior quality is not a
reflection of the personnel; some of
the overseas professors are among
Stanford's best. In most cases, it is
simply that much less is demanded of
the students. Instead of insisting that
the high academic standards which
characterize the institution be main
tained, Stanford has relaxed its re
quirements to the point where a stu
dent's overseas accomplishments
are viewed, and rightly so with much
skepticism.
Some might argue that the relaxa
tion of standards is essential in that it
allows students to choose their own
priorities during their stay overseas
(i.e. travel, vacation, community in

precisely the issue involved.
The point is not to question the
value of these kinds of overseas ex

validity of Stanford's academic rec

it not be better to let the student dis

and to establish overseas campuses
reflecting the high standards which
are the essence of Stanford?

Few will argue with the statement
that Stanford's overseas campuses
lack the academic intensity for which
the Palo Alto campus is so well
known. The one exception, perhaps,
is Paris where the student is offered
an intensive program at the Sor
bonne. The other campuses are
characterized by a minimum of
academic rigor and a plethora of di
verse "extracurricular" activities.
The Italian campus still offers all its
classes in English as the Stanford stu
dents gaze down upon Florence
from their self-sufficient hill-top
villa. And Cliveden is well known for

its isolated, "country clubbish" at
mosphere. Are the overseas cam
puses really the playground that so
many believe them to be?
The experiences offered to a Stan
ford student in the overseas program
are many and varied. The program
operates in such a way as to allow
each student to establish his own
priorities. If a student has chosen an
overseas campus as a base for Euro
pean travel, he will find that he can
spend the first seven weeks of the
quarter on trains and the last two
weeks completing his course work.
If, on the other hand, he prefers to

become intimately involved with the
community and country where he is
studying, he will find endless oppor
tunities for such involvement. Any
student desiring an intensive
academic program has the option of
setting up independent study pro
jects with one of his professors.
Thus, the individual student deter
mines where the emphasis will lie
during his stay overseas. In this
sense, the Stanford overseas prog
ram is without doubt beneficial.
