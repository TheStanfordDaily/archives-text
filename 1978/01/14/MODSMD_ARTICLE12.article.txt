The hoop is 10 feet from the floor, and when bodies and ball
converge near the basket, the closer to the rim a player gets, the
better his chance for scoring. WSU's Don Collins, though, has his
hand between the rim and Kimberly Belton's shot (lower right).
Card guard Mark Pitchford has an even tougher time going against
two USF Dons (lower left). The easiest way to block a shot is by
getting it just before it goes through the hoop, as the Cougars'
Stuart House illustrates (upper left). And sometimes, the pushing
and shoving under the basket goes on after the whistle and an
official has to intervene (upper right).
