## Coaching gives Maxey what he likes 
### Yvonne Randle 
With his origins in the icy
midwest, and a stay in the de
sert of Arizona behind him, As
sistant Basketball Coach Ken
Maxey has now established a
home on the Farm.
The newest member of the
coaching staff, Maxey has a his
tory of not only coaching bas
ketball, but also participating
as a player.
Maxey said he earlier
thought his major sport would
be baseball. After entering
high school, though, he found
that he could not work during
the summer and play baseball,
too. So, he concentrated on
basketball and track.
During his basketball high
school career, he earned All-
Illinois, All-Chicago, and sec
ond team All-American hon
ors.
When Maxey graduated
from high school, he received
offers from a variety of colleges
and universities, including
Stanford. But he didn't choose
Stanford. "I didn't know any
thing about Stanford, then,"
he said. Maxey said he wanted
a school which was both
academically and athletically
oriented. He chose the Univer
sity of Michigan because it was
both a member of the Big Ten
as well as close to his
hometown of Chicago.
In 1968-69, the Michigan
guard served as the Wol
verines' team captain and was
also a Big Ten Conference All-
American selection.
School teacher
After graduation in 1969,
Maxey taught physical educa
tion and social science in De
troit on the elementary school
level. He said, "I like little
kids." Meanwhile he was also
coaching a high school basket
ball team. A year later, he re
turned to Michigan to work
towards his master's degree in
guidance and counseling.

After receiving his master's
degree, Maxey became head
basketball and track coach at
Lake Michigan Community
College. He also served as ath
letic director there in 1972-73.
He said he considers this ex
perience a valuable one be
cause "there is a great possibil
ity that I someday go into ad
ministration."
Maxey accepted a position as

assistant basketball coach at
Arizona in 1973. He remained
there until he joined the Stan
ford staff last August.
Maxey said he chose Stan
ford the second time around
because "it was a good school
both academically and athleti
cally. It was the kind of attitude
that was congruent with my
personality."
Commenting on Maxey's

selection, Head Coach Dick
Dißiaso said "He was the most
qualified of all the candidates.
He is extremely personable,
sincere and honest. Everyone
spoke highly of him and I was
impressed with his loyalty to
his previous position."
Dißiaso said that both Maxey
and the other assistant coach,
Tom McLaughlin, are "totally

involved in the basketball
program." Maxey's duties as
assistant coach include recruit
ing, scouting and assisting at
practices.
At practices, Maxey works
with the guards and forwards.
But his experience as a guard
has been particularly helpful to
the players.
Daryle Morgan, a guard,
said, "Because he was a guard
himself, he has helped us out."
Kimberly Belton, a forward,
added, "It's good to have „a
coach that played the position
to help with the little things."
Wasn't goal
Coaching was not always a
goal for Maxey, but he said,
"I've always been in for a
people's business. Coaching is
one of the more exclusive
choices. It has a great impact
on society because you have
the opportunity of assisting
and directing minds of future
leaders."
He also said that his goal is to
go as far as possible in coach
ing but that he would also be
wifling to someday go into voc
ational or personal counseling.
Off the courts and out of the
basketball office, Maxey has
been trying to get settled into a
new home after his move from
Arizona. He said "My wife
Anita was tremendous in help
ing me make the adjustment."
He added that when he gets
the time, he will start playing
tennis, handball and golf, but
that he "lacks skill" in these
sports.
When asked what he thought
the differences were between
his playing days and college
basketball today, he replied,
"Players now are much more
talented and aware of the diffe
rent skills and techniques."
Later, he added, "They're
getting better coaching, too."
After his journey across the
country, Maxey seems to have
found a home on the Farm.
