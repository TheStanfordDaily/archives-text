# Shader's career hampered by injuries
## Big George has finally made it back 
### Brad Brockbank 
"I had always been in winning situations, prior to coming to
Stanford," said senior George Schader. "My whole goal in com
ing here was that I wanted to help make a winner out of this
school."
The Cardinal co-captain entered Stanford as a transfer student
from Mount San Antonio Junior College two years ago. After a
successful junior season on the Stanford basketball team, how
ever, Schader tore the cartilage in his knee, forcing him to red
shirt last year.
While recuperating, he tore the cartilage in the other knee and
had to go under the knife for a second time. Then, last summer,
the 6-foot-7 forward from Covina, Ca. stepped on a piece of glass
at the beach. Two operations and five months later, Schader
began basketball practice, determined to fulfill his goal of playing
on a victorious Stanford team.
"I just had to realize that I wasn't up to 100 percent, that I
shouldn't be starting," Schader recalled. "But I knew within
myself that I could start and, if I got my game back, I would be
starting."
Still recovering from his foot injury, Schader began the 1977-78
season. The early games were the toughest for him and, at first,
his sore foot prevented him from seeing much action.
"At the beginning of the year," recalled coach Dick Dißiaso,
"his competitive instincts and his emotions demanded certain
expectations that his body was not ready to provide him."
Starting call
Slowly, however, Sqhader and his foot have improved to a
point where he now considers himself close to 100 percent,
physically. In accordance with Schader's present condition, Di-
Biaso inserted his co-captain into the starting lineup Thursday,
for the first time in two years.
Schader's return as a starter, however, does not mean that he
has entirely regained his reckless form of two years ago. Both
physically and psychologically, Schader has had to adjust to a
year's layoff.
"I lost a little bit of my confidence that I think I'm regaining
now," explained Schader. "You know, you're not sure whether
you can play or whether you're supposed to play. You're not sure
whether you can do the things you did two years ago. Then you
look at the films and you see you're doing the same stuff. It's just a
matter of overcoming the lack of confidence.
"A couple parts of my game are just a little behind," he con
tinued. "The recknessness isn't like it was and I've gotto improve
on my rebounding. I'm rebounding well when the ball's coming
straight off, but I'm not going for some of the reaching rebounds.
I've just got to extend myself a little bit more."
"He has skills that people don't always recognize because the
basic fan sees fluid, 6ne-on-one players and George is not that,"
said Dißiaso. "George is a worker. He has a nice soft shot and he's
a good passer for his size. He's a smart player who knows the
game."
Fundamentally
Schader credited his strengths to a knowledge of fundamentals
which he learned from his high school coach.
"I'm not a gifted athlete," Schader concedes. "I'm not a great
leaper. I don't have exceptional speed or exceptional quickness. I
feel that I'm an intelligent player. I overcome my weaknesses by
going to my strengths. If I can't jump as well as somebody, I'll box
him out."
Neither Schader nor Dißiaso know when the big forward will
be back in top form, but the game this weekend could give an
indication.
"For once, he has a chance to play and not have to think about
his injuries," said teammate Jay Carter. "He should be more
consistent this weekend."
Schader had his best game of the season Thursday night against
Washington State when he scored 21 points and grabbed nine
rebounds, team highs for the Cards in their 62-59 loss.
"George has skills that need to be honed, as opposed to skills
that you need to develop," Dißiaso explained. "That's just a
matter of practicing and playing. Practices are critical for him. He
has to perform in practice as though it's a game, in order to get
the reactions and the skill levels back."
Besides his individual abilities, Schader has also had to come
back and adjust to playing with a team.
"I think I've hurt myself a little bit up until now just because I
didn't know where I was going to be standing on the team and
what I was expected to do," Schader said. "I didn't know if I
should go out and try to dominate a game like I did a couple of
years ago.
"Now I'm seeing where that's a must," he continued. "We
need that. We're a young team and, for the most part, an inex
perienced team. We need somebody who's been around and
knows what the team can do. I really feel that they're looking for
leadership and I like that kind of role."

It's been gone for more than a year, but Thursday night Stanford forward George Schader displayed the
type of play he was known for before leg injuries interrupted his career. Against Washington State,
Schader scored 21 points and had nine rebounds.
