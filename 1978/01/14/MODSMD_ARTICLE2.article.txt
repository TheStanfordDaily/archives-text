# 0-3 conference start
## Cards need new deal 
### David Georgette 
After opening the Pacific-8 season with three
straight losses, things couldn't be much worse
for coach Dick Dißiaso's Cards, right? But they
will be if the Cards don't win this afternoon's
game against the Washington Huskies.
How important is today's contest to Stanford
and Dißiaso? "The game has obvious impor
tance," he said. "We're playing at home, we've
lost three league games already and it's on TV.
We want to do well on TV."
But the opening three losses haven't dam
pened Dißiaso's optimism for this season. He
has said often the team has played well despite
the losing streak, and he points to the turn
around Cal pulled in the second half of last
season as to what is possible.
But in playing good, the Cards nevertheless
have not come up with the ingredients neces
sary to put them over the top in a conference
game. "In order to win," said Dißiaso, "it's a
matter of us playing with concentration and not
letting the little things beat us.!'
By the little things, Dißiaso means a player
letting his man inside for a rebound basket or
another player making a bad pass. These indi
vidual breakdowns haven't kept Stanford out of
any game, but they have happened enough times
to make the difference in a close game. And Stan

ford has had more than its share of close games
this season.
The Dogs
Washington, meanwhile, hasn't had many
close games, but the Dogs have had an up-and
down season. They opened with five wins, but
then went on a four-game losing streak.
The Huskies picked up two more wins
entering the Pac-8, but then they dropped
games against UCLA and USC last weekend.
Would the real Huskies please stand up.
From performance against Cal Thursday
night, it looks like the Dogs' true character is
that of the team that won five straight games.
They shot 54 per cent from the field in the
second half on the way to a 85-77 win over the
Bears.
Forward Kim Stewart, the team's top scorer,'
led the Dogs to their win over Cal, canning 20
points and adding eight assists. The Huskies'
other forward, sophomore Stan Walker, their
third-leading scorer, had 17 points and grabbed
nine rebounds.
The third member of the Huskies' leading trio
is junior guard Mike Neill. The left-handed
guard is the team's second-leading scorer, and
can hurt zone defenses with his long-range set
shots.
