# Lefty Ryan finds defens is the right way
## Freshman gets starting call 
### Emilie Deutsch 
Jeff Ryan is tall (almost towering), blond
and a freshman —for which he receives no
special consideration on the Cardinal bas
ketball team. Head Coach Dick Dißiaso
made a point when practices first began
that "everyone's equal, we're starting
from here."
Ryan approves of this policy. Because of
a merit rather than a seniority system, he's
started eight games for the Cards this year.
"It's good to know where you stand," said
the recruit from Wilmette, 111.
And Ryan stands pretty tall at about
6-foot-7.
Dißiaso said, "Ryan has made the transi
tion from a high school center to a college
forward well." He also had praise for the
preparatory training Ryan received (which
started in the third grade with a park
league team). "He was well-coached in
high school," said Dißiaso, "and that has
helped him make that transition."
Ryan said he feels the change was made
easier by the similar emphasis both of his
coaches placed on defense—which he ac
tually enjoys playing.

"It's a good feeling when you stop
someone from scoring/' said Ryan. "Our
high school coach was all defense. He said
'You guys ought to love to play de
fense'...He was a pretty funny guy."
Ryan also thinks it's the fundamental
component of a victory. "Fans love the
dunk, but the defense wins games for
Southpaw shot
Aside from the fact that Ryan is a
freshman, his left-handed play is another
distinction between he and the majority of
college players. The result?
"People have to guard me differently,"
said Ryan, "force me to the right. A lot of
people are so used to guarding right
handed players, they're not quick to re
spond to left-handed ones."
Ryan has had no trouble responding to
his teammates, though.

"That's one of the main reasons I came
here," said the rather shy midwesterner.
"When I made my visits, I always made a
point to learn something about the
players, to go out with them, because you
don't want to play with guys you don't
like...you'd be miserable. I get along well

with these guys. We have the same kind of
goals."
The modest athlete has refused to let
himself be overwhelmed by the advent of
college, the 2000-mile distance from home
and the added pressure of playing on a
major college basketball team.
"At first I was kind of shy," said Ryan. "I
don't really come across too strongly any
way. Everything's new. It's very exciting."
The game of hoops is not new to Ryan,
though.
"I look forward to the season, and I
know what's going to happen. It's all bas
ketball and school now—those are my
main concerns. You don't have too much
of a social life during basketball, but I'm
used to that too —so is everyone else that
plays."
Big fans
Ryan's father, a mere 6-3, never played
after high school. But that hasn't stopped
him from being one of his son's three
most avid fans. Who are the other two? His
brother and "almost six-foot tall" mother.
"My dad's seen seven Stanford games
already this year," said Ryan.

And remember, Illinois is not exactly
next door.
"My parents are just great basketball
fans," he explained.
Ryan, who recently injured his knee
slightly, has been "living in the training
room." That only adds to the usual five
hours a day he dedicates to the game
"from taping until after training table."
Although many of these experiences are
new, including contributing that extra
time, the 10-year veteran to the game can,
obviously, anticipate a few things. Appa
rently the same philosophy applies at
every level of basketball from park league
to the Pacific-8.
"You can never get too uptight," said
Ryan. "You've just got to go out there and
play. Once the game starts, whoever's
going to work the hardest, wins."
No. 52 has won no small prize—a start
ing position, at least some of the time, as a
freshman.
And undoubtedly he'll work just as hard
to keep it for the nexf four years, just as he
did to win it.

Freshman Jeff Ryan is a firm believer in the importance of good defense, but the Stanford frontliner also
can shoot. He's made over-50 per cent of his field goal attempts and is an 80 per cent free thrower.
