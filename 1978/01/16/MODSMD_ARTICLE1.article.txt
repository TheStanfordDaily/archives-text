# Recently enacted copyright law hinders photocopying
## 
### Dave Ansley 
Students may find photocopied
reserve readings more difficult to
obtain now that a new federal
copyright law has gone into ef
fect.
For the same reason, instruc
tors turning in their course read
ing lists to the libraries may dis
cover a four- to six-week delay be
fore photocopied readings reach
the shelves.
The new statute, which took ef
fect Jan. 1, was the first major revi
sion of the federal copyright sta
tute since 1909. Legislators pro
duced complicated changes in the
legality of sound reproduction
and photocopying — processes
almost nonexistent in 1909.
Congress, seeking to codify the
concept of "fair use," has limited
the uses for which publications
can be photocopied without the
payment of royalties to the pub
lisher or author.
"We have to write to the pub
lisher for copies or for permission
to photocopy beyond 'fair use,' "
said David Weber, director of
University libraries.
Photocopying permission
Libraries here have been asking
for such permission before
photocopying for 10 years, he
said. However, they will no longer
accept photocopied readings di
rectly from instructors unless
permission has already been ob
tained.
"In the past, we didn't require
permission for professors' multi

pie copies," said Liz Salzer, head
librarian at Meyer, where the bulk
of reserve readings are held. "We
won't accept those anymore, so
we hope everyone gets their lists
in just as soon as they can,'' she
added.
Late reserve reading requests
may be the chief cause of prob
lems under the new system. Most
of the reading for many under
graduate classes is on special
shelves behind the loan desk, av
ailable for two-hour periods.
Thousands of these readings
are photocopies of selected chap
ters and articles from a wide range
of books and magazines. Such
readings are placed on reserve
only when an instructor requests
them, but some winter quarter
reading lists were being turned in
as late as last week.
Library guidelines
Provost William Miller's office
prepared a set of guidelines for
the libraries' compliance with the
new law. It indicates that "fre
quently, inquiry of a journal pro
duces information that the
copyright is actually held by the
author, and four weeks is often
quite inadequate to obtain such
permission."
Salzer said, "There is a possibil
ity that more readings might be
late until professors are used to
the change."
A few selections are being
placed on reserve before permis
sion for their reproduction has
been received. But Salzer indi

cated that this occurs only "when
a long period has passed with no
response to a request and we have
a strong need for the materials.
"But if permission for those
readings doesn't come in," she
said, "we'll have to take them off
reserve. And that could have an
effect on the students."
Not turned down
Ralph Hansen, chief of library
acquisitions, said, "So far we have
not been turned down by any
one." But not all requests have
been answered yet.
He said, "It should be stressed
that faculty should be submitting
requests for next quarter now. It
takes so long.
"The only people we've had
problems with have been au
thors," Hansen said. "One very
well-known author wrote us a sca
thing letter saying we're taking
the bread out of his mouth. His
book was a nonfiction bestseller.
"A few publishers have indi
cated they have reprint services.
Some simply charge us a fee to
photocopy," he said.
"Foreign Affairs magazine of
fered us unlimited permission for
$250 a year, with the exception of
any articles by Arthur Schlesinger
Jr. They cost $100 extra each."
Royalty payments
Salzer said that the libraries
have set themselves no limit for
royalty payments. "We don't have
enough experience with this yet,
and we agreed that we'd like to

Notices regarding recently enacted federal copyright laws have been

liable for any infringement."
see what happens."
If, in the middle of a quarter, a
professor realizes that he or she
has forgotten to place an impor
tant reading on reserve, the new
law offers an out: the spontaneity
clause.
This provision allows brief ex
cerpts of a particular work to be
reproduced for only one course,
one copy per student. Since the
idea of copying the work is sup
posed to be "spontaneous," that
clause can never again be invoked
for that same piece.
Weber indicated that, under
some circumstances, libraries
would place a "spontaneous"
copy on the reserve shelves for
one quarter. Further use would
require permission from the

copyright holder.
"Our feeling is that this is a con
scientious effort to comply with
the law and not frustrate the fa
culty," Weber said.
Required permission
Permission may also be re
quired when anyone uses a self
service machine to copy a
copyrighted work.
Warning signs, required by the
new law, have been placed on
campus photocopy machines,
cautioning the user that repro
ductions are now covered by the
copyright law.
According to John Heyeck, as
sistant director for administrative
services, the University is not li
able for any illegal use of self
service copy machines as long as
the notice is attached to it.

Notices regarding recently enacted federal copyright laws have been

see what happens."
If, in the middle of a quarter, a
professor realizes that he or she
has forgotten to place an impor
tant reading on reserve, the new
law offers an out: the spontaneity
clause.
This provision allows brief ex
cerpts of a particular work to be
reproduced for only one course,
one copy per student. Since the
idea of copying the work is sup
posed to be "spontaneous," that
clause can never again be invoked
for that same piece.
Weber indicated that, under
some circumstances, libraries
would place a "spontaneous"
copy on the reserve shelves for
one quarter. Further use would
require permission from the

copyright holder.
"Our feeling is that this is a con
scientious effort to comply with
the law and not frustrate the fa
culty," Weber said.
Required permission
Permission may also be re
quired when anyone uses a self
service machine to copy a
copyrighted work.
Warning signs, required by the
new law, have been placed on
campus photocopy machines,
cautioning the user that repro
ductions are now covered by the
copyright law.
According to John Heyeck, as
sistant director for administrative
services, the University is not li
able for any illegal use of self
service copy machines as long as
the notice is attached to it.
Students may find photocopied
reserve readings more difficult to
obtain now that a new federal
copyright law has gone into ef
fect.
For the same reason, instruc
tors turning in their course read
ing lists to the libraries may dis
cover a four- to six-week delay be
fore photocopied readings reach
the shelves.
The new statute, which took ef
fect Jan. 1, was the first major revi
sion of the federal copyright sta
tute since 1909. Legislators pro
duced complicated changes in the
legality of sound reproduction
and photocopying — processes
almost nonexistent in 1909.
Congress, seeking to codify the
concept of "fair use," has limited
the uses for which publications
can be photocopied without the
payment of royalties to the pub
lisher or author.
"We have to write to the pub
lisher for copies or for permission
to photocopy beyond 'fair use,' "
said David Weber, director of
University libraries.
Photocopying permission
Libraries here have been asking
for such permission before
photocopying for 10 years, he
said. However, they will no longer
accept photocopied readings di
rectly from instructors unless
permission has already been ob
tained.
"In the past, we didn't require
permission for professors' multi

pie copies," said Liz Salzer, head
librarian at Meyer, where the bulk
of reserve readings are held. "We
won't accept those anymore, so
we hope everyone gets their lists
in just as soon as they can,'' she
added.
Late reserve reading requests
may be the chief cause of prob
lems under the new system. Most
of the reading for many under
graduate classes is on special
shelves behind the loan desk, av
ailable for two-hour periods.
Thousands of these readings
are photocopies of selected chap
ters and articles from a wide range
of books and magazines. Such
readings are placed on reserve
only when an instructor requests
them, but some winter quarter
reading lists were being turned in
as late as last week.
Library guidelines
Provost William Miller's office
prepared a set of guidelines for
the libraries' compliance with the
new law. It indicates that "fre
quently, inquiry of a journal pro
duces information that the
copyright is actually held by the
author, and four weeks is often
quite inadequate to obtain such
permission."
Salzer said, "There is a possibil
ity that more readings might be
late until professors are used to
the change."
A few selections are being
placed on reserve before permis
sion for their reproduction has
been received. But Salzer indi

cated that this occurs only "when
a long period has passed with no
response to a request and we have
a strong need for the materials.
"But if permission for those
readings doesn't come in," she
said, "we'll have to take them off
reserve. And that could have an
effect on the students."
Not turned down
Ralph Hansen, chief of library
acquisitions, said, "So far we have
not been turned down by any
one." But not all requests have
been answered yet.
He said, "It should be stressed
that faculty should be submitting
requests for next quarter now. It
takes so long.
"The only people we've had

in just as soon as they can,'' she
added.
Late reserve reading requests
may be the chief cause of prob
lems under the new system. Most
of the reading for many under
graduate classes is on special
shelves behind the loan desk, av
ailable for two-hour periods.
Thousands of these readings
are photocopies of selected chap
ters and articles from a wide range
of books and magazines. Such
readings are placed on reserve
only when an instructor requests
them, but some winter quarter
reading lists were being turned in
as late as last week.
Library guidelines
Provost William Miller's office
prepared a set of guidelines for
the libraries' compliance with the
new law. It indicates that "fre
quently, inquiry of a journal pro
duces information that the
copyright is actually held by the
author, and four weeks is often
quite inadequate to obtain such
permission."
Salzer said, "There is a possibil
ity that more readings might be
late until professors are used to
the change."
A few selections are being
placed on reserve before permis
sion for their reproduction has
been received. But Salzer indi

cated that this occurs only "when
a long period has passed with no
response to a request and we have
a strong need for the materials.
"But if permission for those
readings doesn't come in," she
said, "we'll have to take them off
reserve. And that could have an
effect on the students."
Not turned down
Ralph Hansen, chief of library
acquisitions, said, "So far we have
not been turned down by any
one." But not all requests have
been answered yet.
He said, "It should be stressed
that faculty should be submitting
requests for next quarter now. It
takes so long.
"The only people we've had
problems with have been au
thors," Hansen said. "One very
well-known author wrote us a sca
thing letter saying we're taking
the bread out of his mouth. His
book was a nonfiction bestseller.
"A few publishers have indi
cated they have reprint services.
Some simply charge us a fee to
photocopy," he said.
"Foreign Affairs magazine of
fered us unlimited permission for
$250 a year, with the exception of
any articles by Arthur Schlesinger
Jr. They cost $100 extra each."
Royalty payments
Salzer said that the libraries
have set themselves no limit for
royalty payments. "We don't have
enough experience with this yet,
and we agreed that we'd like to

Notices regarding recently enacted federal copyright laws have been
placed on all Meyer library photocopy machines. The notice reads: "The
copyright law of the United States (Title 17, U.S. code) governs the making
of Dnotocopies of copyright materials. The person using this equipment is
liable for any infringement."
see what happens."
If, in the middle of a quarter, a
professor realizes that he or she
has forgotten to place an impor
tant reading on reserve, the new
law offers an out: the spontaneity
clause.
This provision allows brief ex
cerpts of a particular work to be
reproduced for only one course,
one copy per student. Since the
idea of copying the work is sup
posed to be "spontaneous," that
clause can never again be invoked
for that same piece.
Weber indicated that, under
some circumstances, libraries
would place a "spontaneous"
copy on the reserve shelves for
one quarter. Further use would
require permission from the

copyright holder.
"Our feeling is that this is a con
scientious effort to comply with
the law and not frustrate the fa
culty," Weber said.
Required permission
Permission may also be re
quired when anyone uses a self
service machine to copy a
copyrighted work.
Warning signs, required by the
new law, have been placed on
campus photocopy machines,
cautioning the user that repro
ductions are now covered by the
copyright law.
According to John Heyeck, as
sistant director for administrative
services, the University is not li
able for any illegal use of self
service copy machines as long as
the notice is attached to it.
Students may find photocopied
reserve readings more difficult to
obtain now that a new federal
copyright law has gone into ef
fect.
For the same reason, instruc
tors turning in their course read
ing lists to the libraries may dis
cover a four- to six-week delay be
fore photocopied readings reach
the shelves.
The new statute, which took ef
fect Jan. 1, was the first major revi
sion of the federal copyright sta
tute since 1909. Legislators pro
duced complicated changes in the
legality of sound reproduction
and photocopying — processes
almost nonexistent in 1909.
Congress, seeking to codify the
concept of "fair use," has limited
the uses for which publications
can be photocopied without the
payment of royalties to the pub
lisher or author.
"We have to write to the pub
lisher for copies or for permission
to photocopy beyond 'fair use,' "
said David Weber, director of
University libraries.
Photocopying permission
Libraries here have been asking
for such permission before
photocopying for 10 years, he
said. However, they will no longer
accept photocopied readings di
rectly from instructors unless
permission has already been ob
tained.
"In the past, we didn't require
permission for professors' multi

pie copies," said Liz Salzer, head
librarian at Meyer, where the bulk
of reserve readings are held. "We
won't accept those anymore, so
we hope everyone gets their lists
in just as soon as they can,'' she
added.
