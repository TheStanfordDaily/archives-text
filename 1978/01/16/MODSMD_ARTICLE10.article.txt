# Palestinian controversy
## Echoes of Vietnam 
### 
Rachelle Marshall

The controversy over a Palestinian
homeland has recently given off
ominous echoes of the early days of
U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Last
month President jimmy Carter said
he was opposed to the creation of a
"radical" state on the West Bank. Is
raeli PrimeMinisterMenachem Begin
insisted recently that a Palestinian
state would endanger Israel's sec
urity because it would be taken over
by the Palestinian Liberation Organi
zation (PLO) and turned into a Soviet
base. And Anwar Sadat reportedly at
tempted to assure Carter that if self
determination for the Palestinians
could be phased in over a long
enough period of time, "moderates"
would eventually assume leadership
So the concern is not simply
whether the Palestinians are entitled
to a nation of their own, but over the
nature of their leadership and of the
society they would presumably es
tablish. The fear that they will create
a "radical" state, allied with the
Soviet Union, harks back to the early
1950s when the U.S. determined that
Vietnam, free of French colonial
rule, should not become a satellite of
the Russians and Chinese.
Since the overwhelmingly popular
leader, Ho Chi Minh, was obviously a
radical, we proceeded to choose and
install a substitute, Ngo Dinh Diem,
intending that he set up the kind of
moderate, pro-U.S. government we
could live with. The corruption, op
pression, and bloodshed that fol
lowed should have taught us that
outsiders cannot, without terrible
risk, choose the leaders of nationalist
movements or attempt to control the
direction they should take.
We should also have learned from
Vietnam that those who aspire to na
tional independence seldom remain
willing puppets of the Soviets. Viet
namese nationalists turned to the
Russians for help after they were re
buffed by the U.S. in 1948. The PLO
obviously welcomes Soviet aid be
cause no other major source is avail
able. But outside of Russia's im
mediate orbit, recipients of her aid
have been notoriously reluctant to
become satellites. Somalia is only the
latest country to cut off once-friendly
relations with the USSR.
Prophecy
There is, however, such a thing as
self-fulfilling prophecy. As long as
the U.S. takes a hard line on Palesti
nian nationhood, militant Palesti
nians will continue to rely on the
Russians. And as long as the Palesti
nian people feel they are being man
ipulated by others and denied active
participation in a Middle East settle
ment, they will turn to militants for
leadership.
In the past there have been unmis
takable signals that the PLO leader
ship would adopt a conciliatory at
titude toward Israel, recognizing her
right to secure borders, in exchange
for recognition of the Palestinians'

right to a separate state. These sig
nals have grown dimmer with Israel's
repeated refusal to grant such rec
ognition.
Begin's current proposal that in
habitants of the West Bank and Gaza
be permitted local government
under Israeli military control but de
nied separate citizenship, free im
migration, and major decision
making powers, is a total rejection of
the Palestinians' demand for inde
pendence. Given Israel's military
superiority, and in the absence of ef
fective opposition by the U.S., the
plan may well go into effect, com
plete with carefully chosen Palesti
nians to help carry it out. But there
will be an inevitable price.
Israel has already resorted to tor
ture and other brutalities in the oc
cupied territories. The question that
must be asked is, how long can Israel
use the measures necessary to put
down Arab protest and still remain a

progressive and humane society?
Recent history has shown that when
a country forcefully subdues the un
willing population, there are incal
culable costs to both sides. Having
learned this lesson in Vietnam, we
should urge Israel to avoid the same
quagmire.
There is, after all, an alternative.
Anwar Sadat overcame 30 years of
violence and hatred between Egyp
tians and Israelis with his historic
flight to Jerusalem. It no longer
seems far-fetched to wonder if Is
rael's leaders could not do the same
thing by proposing face-to-face talks
with the PLO — the only organization
that can presently claim to represent
the Palestinians — with the aim of
achieving eventual co-existence.
Such a move might be only the first
step in a very long process but at least
it would be in the right direction.
