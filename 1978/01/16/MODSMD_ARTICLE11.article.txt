# Western Culture Requirement
## How the proposals stack up

The Western Culture Requirement
proposal now comes in two models;
the "preferred" model (preferred by
the Western Culture Task Force), and
the "multi-track" model. The prefer
red model, consisting of one course,
led by one-third faculty and two
thirds post-doctoral fellows in small
seminars supplemented by a weekly
lecture, has been attacked by the Fa
culty Senate for a number of reasons.
Many of the members of the faculty
feel that the requirement would be
best fulfilled by the multi-track
model, which would be made up of
courses now being offered, with
some changes in content. This model
was preferred by members of the Fa
culty Senate because it would be
"more innovative," and allows
"more freedom of choice" for the
student. As a side note, the multi
track model costs less.
The preferred model is, however,
the preferred model of students as
well as the preferred model of the
Task Force. There are a number of
reasons why this is so; they are
perhaps indicative of a general at
titude towards undergraduate edu
cation at Stanford.
Not innovative
Contrary to the beliefs of faculty
senators, the multi-track model is
not innovative. It is a warmed-over
and tightened-up version of the
humanities requirement. It does not
provide for more faculty-student in

teraction than in the preferred
model, as suggested by some ad
ministrators. In the preferred model,
students will be in a small class with a
regular faculty member for at least
onequarter. In Modern Europe,orin
the Humanities 60 series, which are
prototypes of the multi-track model,
lectures predominate; faculty mem
bers rarely, if ever, participate in
small group discussions.
The multi-track model provides an
illusion of choice for students; in re
ality students are being given no
choice at all; instead, they are being
required to take classes they pre
sently have the option to take. No
thing new would be offered them.
What is behind the multi-track
model, and the support forit, is not, I
believe, a real concern for student
choice or for innovation. Rather, the
multi-track system would be
cheaper; a school which often de
monstrates its unwillingness to
spend money on undergraduates,
particularly those in humanities,
would find the multi-track model ap
pealing.
There is, however, another reason
why some faculty might feel that the
multi-track model is best. In the pre
ferred model, faculty members
would be required to teach in an area
in which they might not be experts.
The learning experience would be a
shared one; the instructor and stu
dent would work towards an under

standing of the material, in a sense,
together. Naturally, this would re
quire more preparation than for a
class in a field in which the instructor
has taught and studied foryears. That
it takes an expert in classics to give a
general understanding of Plato is not
a persuasive argument. The intent of
the requirement is, in part, to pro
vide a foundation in western culture,
not provide an intensive study of the
subject. The advantage gained by
having an expert teach might be
offset by the understanding that
would occur when a faculty member
explores it with the student.
Departments
Departments as institutions would
welcome the multi-track model, be
cause students would then be re
quired to take one of their courses
where there once was choice. They
wouldn't be able to claim a "piece of
the action" in the preferred model.
The crux of the issue is resources.
The preferred model is ambitious; it
requires a great deal from the Uni
versity in terms of money and faculty
time. The question the Faculty Se
nate must address is not one of
which model is more innovative, or
which offers more choice. The ques
tion is really how much does Stan
ford care about teaching under
graduates. The answer is, I'm afraid,
"some, but not a lot."
