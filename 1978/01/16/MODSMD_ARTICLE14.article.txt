Rotterdam, Netherlands (AP)
— An "odd couple" alliance of
Rotterdam prostitutes and em
barrassed citizens is trying to
torpedo city plans for a floating
brothel and sex center in the
world's busiest harbor.
The prostitutes complain
that a sex palace in the public
eye will frighten off their trade,
and other critics say the so
called "Eros Center" will give
Rotterdam a bad name.
"Nine out of 10 girls will tell
you that this is a bad idea," said
Leen Persy, who operates a
hotel and bar in the Katen
drecht, the bustling red-light
district on Rotterdam's south
side.
"When you pick up a prosti
tute in Katendrecht, nobody
sees you," Persy said, "but in
going to the Eros Center,
everybody will see you, maybe
even your neighbors."
Prostitutes oppose the plan
on economic grounds as well.
"The girls now rent rooms in
Katendrecht at about $22 a day.
On the boat they'll be paying at
least twice that," Persy said.
The Rotterdam City Council
began planning the Eros
Center in 1974 in response to

public complaints that pros
titution and related crime was
spreading outward from
Katendrecht to the city's resi
dential districts.
The scheme will concentrate
Rotterdam's thriving sex indus
try on a 400-bed ship that
would be moored alongside
the Oud Poortgebouw — the
old port building — an aban
doned area of this teeming
harbor.
City officials say that despite
mounting criticism they are

going ahead with the plan,
overwhelmingly approved last
October, and are pressing
their search tor a suitable ship.
Although prostitution is
technically illegal, it has been
tolerated by authorities here
for many years and its prac
titioners are seldom prose
cuted. There are 150 prosti
tutes registered with the Rot
terdam police, but officials es
timate more than 1000 women
are plying the trade, most of
them in Katendrecht.
