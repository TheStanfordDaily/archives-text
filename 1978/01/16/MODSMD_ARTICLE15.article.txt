# Down Dogs, 72-68
## Cards capture first league win 
### David Georgette 
Fifteen feet straight on from
the hoop and nobody to get in
the way. That's what free
throwing amounts to, and be
cause of its simplicity occa
sionally it is overlooked in the
context of fast breaking, slam
dunking and fancy passing.
But Saturday afternoon put
ting the ball through the hoop
from the foul stripe made the
difference as Stanford won its
first Pacific-8 game of the year,
72-68 over Washington.
In the last nine minutes of
the game, Stanford had only
one bucket from the floor — a
jumper by Daryle Morgan. But
the Cards went to the free
throw line 17 times, and made
12 of the shots to stave off the
Huskies.
"We always expect to make
the free throw,'' said Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso, "but we
know we're the last team in the
Pac-8 in free throwing. Fortu
nately, this time we made the
important ones."

The Cards had led 56-48 with
11 minutes to go in the game,
but Washington rallied to pull
within 64-62 with four minutes
to play.
But then George Schader,
the game's top scorer with 24
points, sank two free throws to
put Stanford up by four points.
Twice more Washington nar
rowed the margin to two, but
blew a chance to pull even at
66-66 when Mike Neill blew a
lay-up. Then Stanford made
three free throws, while the
Huskies missed a shot and then
turned the ball over to take
themselves out of the game.
Schader hot
Schader, who made seven of
nine shots on the way to 16
first-half points, had his sec
ond straight consecutive good
shooting game. Against
Washington State Thursday, he
made 10 of 17 from the field.
One reason for Schader's
improved outside shooting
was the time he spent shooting
while recovering from the foot

injury he suffered during the
summer. Unable to work out at
full speed, Schader was still
able to shoot, and Saturday he
was given the opportunity by
Washington.
"It seemed that like they
were sagging off," said
Schader, who hit four of his
nine field goals from the free
throw line or further.
Center Jeff McHugh also had
an outstanding effort from the
floor, netting eight of 11 shots
and finishing with 19 points.
The outside shooting was
needed as the Cards commit
ted 22 turnovers to
Washington's 11.
"We had more turnovers,"
said Dißiaso, "but we shot
well. That makes up for it."
Dißiaso also pointed to the
Cards' better play on switching
from offense. "We improved
on our transition," he said.
"They like to run, and we got
back with them. I thought our
guys played pretty good de
fense."

The Cards never trailed after
Schader rolled to the hoop tor
two and then converted a free
throw for a three-point play
and a 19-16 lead. The Huskies
pulled even at 40-40 early in the
second half, but then the Cards
reestablished their lead and
went out to the 56-48 advan
tage.
Washington got 64 of its
points from the field, but went
to the free throw line only five
times. "We were in control of
the game," said Dißiaso, "and
usually when you get behind,
you take more outside shots
and that doesn't lend itself to
fouling."
And if you aren't fouled, it's
hard to get that open 15-footer.

nine shots on the way to 16
first-half points, had his sec
ond straight consecutive good
shooting game. Against
Washington State Thursday, he
made 10 of 17 from the field.
One reason for Schader's
improved outside shooting
was the time he spent shooting
while recovering from the foot

injury he suffered during the
summer. Unable to work out at
full speed, Schader was still
able to shoot, and Saturday he
was given the opportunity by
Washington.
"It seemed that like they
were sagging off," said
Schader, who hit four of his
nine field goals from the free
throw line or further.
Center Jeff McHugh also had
an outstanding effort from the
floor, netting eight of 11 shots
and finishing with 19 points.
The outside shooting was
needed as the Cards commit
ted 22 turnovers to
Washington's 11.
"We had more turnovers,"
said Dißiaso, "but we shot
well. That makes up for it."
Dißiaso also pointed to the
Cards' better play on switching
from offense. "We improved
on our transition," he said.
"They like to run, and we got
back with them. I thought our
guys played pretty good de
fense."

The Cards never trailed after
Schader rolled to the hoop tor
two and then converted a free
throw for a three-point play
and a 19-16 lead. The Huskies
pulled even at 40-40 early in the
second half, but then the Cards
reestablished their lead and
went out to the 56-48 advan
tage.
Washington got 64 of its
points from the field, but went
to the free throw line only five
times. "We were in control of
the game," said Dißiaso, "and
usually when you get behind,
you take more outside shots
and that doesn't lend itself to
fouling."
And if you aren't fouled, it's
hard to get that open 15-footer.
Fifteen feet straight on from
the hoop and nobody to get in
the way. That's what free
throwing amounts to, and be
cause of its simplicity occa
sionally it is overlooked in the
context of fast breaking, slam
dunking and fancy passing.
But Saturday afternoon put
ting the ball through the hoop
from the foul stripe made the
difference as Stanford won its
first Pacific-8 game of the year,
72-68 over Washington.
In the last nine minutes of
the game, Stanford had only
one bucket from the floor — a
jumper by Daryle Morgan. But
the Cards went to the free
throw line 17 times, and made
12 of the shots to stave off the
Huskies.
"We always expect to make
the free throw,'' said Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso, "but we
know we're the last team in the
Pac-8 in free throwing. Fortu
nately, this time we made the
important ones."

The Cards had led 56-48 with
11 minutes to go in the game,
but Washington rallied to pull
within 64-62 with four minutes
to play.
But then George Schader,
the game's top scorer with 24
points, sank two free throws to
put Stanford up by four points.
Twice more Washington nar
rowed the margin to two, but
blew a chance to pull even at
66-66 when Mike Neill blew a
lay-up. Then Stanford made
three free throws, while the
Huskies missed a shot and then
turned the ball over to take
themselves out of the game.
