### Sukie Jackson 
Stanford lost to an excellent
team but beat a good team in
women's basketball action at
Maples Pavilion over the
weekend. Friday night the
Cards lost 74-50 to the Cal
State-Fullerton Titans but then
won their first Northern
California Athletic Conference
Saturday night by dumping the
University of the Pacific
Tigers, 67-58.
Both the Titans and the Ti
gers played good, solid games.
Stanford, on the other hand,
had trouble scoring against Ful
lerton's effective man-to-man
press, but the Cards bounced
back against UOP with a ba
lanced attack.
Both opposing teams fo
cused their defenses on Stan
ford's front line. "It was the
first time we've faced full court
pressure," forward Kathy
Murphy said of the Fullerton
game. "We got rattled and
never got going." The Titans
managed to hold Murphy to 16
points and senior center Mag
gie Nelson to nine points.
Since none of Stanford's
front line hit double figures in
the UOP game, the Cards'
backcourt had to pick up the
scoring slack. After the UOP

game, Betsy Lough, a sopho
more guard who put in 16
points, said, "We (the guards)
weren't pressured on the out
side. We were open a lot."
Although the Cards got off to
an early lead Saturday, the Ti
gers kept pace by feeding the
ball underneath to UOP's Kim
McDonald, who finished the
game with 31 points. At
halftime Stanford led 27-26
and five minutes into the sec
ond half the Cards still led by
only one but a steal by Lough
and two quick baskets gave
Stanford a four-point edge
which they never relinquished.
Even with Murphy, Nelson
and Ann Cooper all in foul
trouble late in the game, Stan
ford maintained its momentum
and Stephanie Calef's four
for-four free throwing in the
last minute eliminated a possi
ble comeback by the Tigers.
Coaches Dottie McCrea and
Sue Rojcewicz commended
the guards after the game. "We
won the game without the big
people. They were a good team
and played well but we never
gave up. The guards won the
game," McCrea said.
Before Saturday's game
Stanford had depended on the
forwards for scoring, but fol

lowing the win guard Lough
said, "We know we can do it
now and maybe we can take
some of the pressure off the
big people."
Stanford will have the
chance to test their offense
Wednesday night when they
meet San Francisco State at 8
p.m. in Maples Pavilion.

ble comeback by the Tigers.
Coaches Dottie McCrea and
Sue Rojcewicz commended
the guards after the game. "We
won the game without the big
people. They were a good team
and played well but we never
gave up. The guards won the
game," McCrea said.
Before Saturday's game
Stanford had depended on the
forwards for scoring, but fol

lowing the win guard Lough
said, "We know we can do it
now and maybe we can take
some of the pressure off the
big people."
Stanford will have the
chance to test their offense
Wednesday night when they
meet San Francisco State at 8
p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
Stanford lost to an excellent
team but beat a good team in
women's basketball action at
Maples Pavilion over the
weekend. Friday night the
Cards lost 74-50 to the Cal
State-Fullerton Titans but then
won their first Northern
California Athletic Conference
Saturday night by dumping the
University of the Pacific
Tigers, 67-58.
Both the Titans and the Ti
gers played good, solid games.
Stanford, on the other hand,
had trouble scoring against Ful
lerton's effective man-to-man
press, but the Cards bounced
back against UOP with a ba
lanced attack.
Both opposing teams fo
cused their defenses on Stan
ford's front line. "It was the
first time we've faced full court
pressure," forward Kathy
Murphy said of the Fullerton
game. "We got rattled and
never got going." The Titans
managed to hold Murphy to 16
points and senior center Mag
gie Nelson to nine points.
Since none of Stanford's
front line hit double figures in
the UOP game, the Cards'
backcourt had to pick up the
scoring slack. After the UOP

game, Betsy Lough, a sopho
more guard who put in 16
points, said, "We (the guards)
weren't pressured on the out
side. We were open a lot."
Although the Cards got off to
an early lead Saturday, the Ti
gers kept pace by feeding the
ball underneath to UOP's Kim
McDonald, who finished the
game with 31 points. At
halftime Stanford led 27-26
and five minutes into the sec
ond half the Cards still led by
only one but a steal by Lough
and two quick baskets gave
Stanford a four-point edge
which they never relinquished.
Even with Murphy, Nelson
and Ann Cooper all in foul
trouble late in the game, Stan
ford maintained its momentum
and Stephanie Calef's four
for-four free throwing in the
last minute eliminated a possi
ble comeback by the Tigers.
