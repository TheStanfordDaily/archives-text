New Orleans (AP) — The cool and efficient Dallas Cowboys,
directed by Roger Staubach and a ferocious defense that de
stroyed Denver, wiped out the Broncos 27-10 in Super Bowl XII
yesterday to capture the world championship of professional
football.
A proud "Doomsday II" defense, named after the unit that led
Dallas to its first Super Bowl championship six years ago, forced
eight vital turnovers and supplied the game's Most Valuable
Players — end Harvey Martin and tackle Randy White.
Martin and White, the right side of the Dallas defense,
exploded into the Broncos backfield time and time again with Ed
"Too Tall" Jones and a host of other Cowboys. Eventually they
forced ex-teammate Craig Morton, who had quarterbacked De
nver into its first Super Bowl, right out of the gameand prevented
the Broncos from ever really challenging Dallas' dominance.
Staubach threw one touchdown pass to Butch Johnson in the

third quarter and running back Robert Newhouse hurled another
on an option play to Golden Richards in the fourth as the Cow
boys picked apart the Denver secondary.
Tony Dorsett, forced out of the game in the third period with a
twisted right knee, scored the other Cowboys touchdown on a
3-yard run after Dallas intercepted the first of four passes off
Broncos quarterback Craig Morton.
The Broncos had boasted that Dallas' only serious receiving
threat was flanker Drew Pearson, but Pearson did less damage
than any of the other targets in the Cowboys' arsenal.
Johnson made a circus catch in the end zone on a 45-yard bomb
from Staubach in the third quarter and Richards grabbed
Newhouse's pitch for Dallas' wrapup TD.
Morton, who threw only eight interceptions all season, lowest
in the American Conference, had four passes picked off in the
first half and Dallas also recovered four Denver fumbles.

Free throwing made the difference Saturday as Stanford won its first Pacific-8 game of the season,
downing Washington 72-68. Mark Pitchford made four of his five attempts, including two critical free
throws at the end of the game.
