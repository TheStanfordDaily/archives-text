# University plans new housing
## 
### Randy Keith 
The University may build 1000 to
1200 units of high density housing on
46 acres of land bordering San Fran
cisquito Creek, and may also in
crease the number of faculty-staff
homes near Peter Coutts Road, ac
cording to William Massy, vice presi
dent for business and finance.
The projects are being studied by
Massy's office in an attempt to find a
solution to high priced, scarce hous
ing facing people moving into the
Stanford area.
"We have found that housing
prices on the Mid-Peninsula are high
enough to make difficult the re
cruitment of faculty and staff," Massy
told the Palo Alto Chamber of Com
merce Business Outlook Forum.
"It is increasingly difficult for
people already here to afford homes
if they have been renting, or to find
reasonably priced accommodations
close to their jobs," he added.
The development of the vacant 46
acres on the western side of the Med
ical Center would include a "range of
units in terms of cost"and some
would be sold below market value,
