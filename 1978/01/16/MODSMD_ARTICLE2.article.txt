# University plans new housing
## 
### Randy Keith 
The University may build 1000 to
1200 units of high density housing on
46 acres of land bordering San Fran
cisquito Creek, and may also in
crease the number of faculty-staff
homes near Peter Coutts Road, ac
cording to William Massy, vice presi
dent for business and finance.
The projects are being studied by
Massy's office in an attempt to find a
solution to high priced, scarce hous
ing facing people moving into the
Stanford area.
"We have found that housing
prices on the Mid-Peninsula are high
enough to make difficult the re
cruitment of faculty and staff," Massy
told the Palo Alto Chamber of Com
merce Business Outlook Forum.
"It is increasingly difficult for
people already here to afford homes
if they have been renting, or to find
reasonably priced accommodations
close to their jobs," he added.
The development of the vacant 46
acres on the western side of the Med
ical Center would include a "range of
units in terms of cost"and some
would be sold below market value,
Massy said.
The University has agreed that any
development on the land would have
to meet a requirement of the Palo
Alto master plan which specifies that
some of the housing must be priced
at least 10 percent below the actual
market value.
These units are then rented or sold
through the Palo Alto Housing Cor
poration to people who cannot af
ford higher priced housing.
Though Massy says the housing
would be primarily for people work
ing for corporations and businesses
in the Stanford Industrial Park or the
Shopping Center, he said graduate
students as well as Medical School
residents and interns would proba

bly be allowed to live there.
Currently residents at the Medical
School cannot live in on-campus
housing like Escondido Village.
The possibility of a high density
development on the land came up
several years ago, but actual plan
ning has been delayed until final ap
proval of the Sand Hill Road Im
provement Project was obtained
from Palo Alto.
Last week the city approved the
final step of the project which will
widen Sand Hill Road running along
the eastern edge of the parcel slated
for development.
Massy also said that the University
is currently conducting a survey on
faculty-staff housing demand and he
told the forum that "one of my goals

is to increase the supply and change
the mix of faculty-staff housing on
and adjacent to the campus."
Massy said that additional faculty
staff housing might be built on the
site of what was once known as the
Frenchman's Terrace project near
Page Mill Road.
The Frenchman's Terrace project
died about three years ago when
federal funding for the 225-unit de
velopment fell through.
Financing of the two new prop
osed developments is still unclear
but Massy said that he does not ex
pect any federal funds to be used.

dent for business and finance.
The projects are being studied by
Massy's office in an attempt to find a
solution to high priced, scarce hous
ing facing people moving into the
Stanford area.
"We have found that housing
prices on the Mid-Peninsula are high
enough to make difficult the re
cruitment of faculty and staff," Massy
told the Palo Alto Chamber of Com
merce Business Outlook Forum.
"It is increasingly difficult for
people already here to afford homes
if they have been renting, or to find
reasonably priced accommodations
close to their jobs," he added.
The development of the vacant 46
acres on the western side of the Med
ical Center would include a "range of
units in terms of cost"and some
would be sold below market value,
Massy said.
The University has agreed that any
development on the land would have
to meet a requirement of the Palo
Alto master plan which specifies that
some of the housing must be priced
at least 10 percent below the actual
market value.
These units are then rented or sold
through the Palo Alto Housing Cor
poration to people who cannot af
ford higher priced housing.
Though Massy says the housing
would be primarily for people work
ing for corporations and businesses
in the Stanford Industrial Park or the
Shopping Center, he said graduate
students as well as Medical School
residents and interns would proba

bly be allowed to live there.
Currently residents at the Medical
School cannot live in on-campus
housing like Escondido Village.
The possibility of a high density
development on the land came up
several years ago, but actual plan
ning has been delayed until final ap
proval of the Sand Hill Road Im
provement Project was obtained
from Palo Alto.
Last week the city approved the
final step of the project which will
widen Sand Hill Road running along
the eastern edge of the parcel slated
for development.
Massy also said that the University
is currently conducting a survey on
faculty-staff housing demand and he
told the forum that "one of my goals

is to increase the supply and change
the mix of faculty-staff housing on
and adjacent to the campus."
Massy said that additional faculty
staff housing might be built on the
site of what was once known as the
Frenchman's Terrace project near
Page Mill Road.
The Frenchman's Terrace project
died about three years ago when
federal funding for the 225-unit de
velopment fell through.
Financing of the two new prop
osed developments is still unclear
but Massy said that he does not ex
pect any federal funds to be used.
The University may build 1000 to
1200 units of high density housing on
46 acres of land bordering San Fran
cisquito Creek, and may also in
crease the number of faculty-staff
homes near Peter Coutts Road, ac
cording to William Massy, vice presi
dent for business and finance.
