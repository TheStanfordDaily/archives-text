# ASU upends men swimmers
## 
### Andy Lowe 
A spirited Arizona State swim
team, rebounding from the
previous day's loss to Califor
nia, outswam Stanford Friday
afternoon, 69-44. Despite the
cold, wind and rain, normally a
hindrance to swimming per
formances, several fine indi
vidual efforts highlighted the
meet.
Again leading Stanford were
freestylers Jon Powell and
Mike Bruner. Uncontested in
winning two events each,
Powell dominated the fields in
the 50 yd. (21.2) and 100 yd.
(45.8) freestyles. Bruner easily
outdistanced all competitors in
the 200 yd. (1:40.5) and 500 yd.
(4:34.4) freestyle events. Also
capturing races for the Cardi
nals were Paul Hartloff (1000
yd. free, 9:27.2), Rob Weber
(200 breast, 2:11.4) and Tom
O'Brien (200 fly 1:51.8).
Both Stanford relay quartets
touched second behind
Arizona State. The medley re
lay, without captains Stu Cor

liss and Jon Powell, posted a
fine 3:32.3 (Connelly 54.1,
Weber 59.6, Hagberg 50.9,
Kingery 47.7). The freestyle re
lay, despite Powell's 45.5 an
chor leg, fell three-tenths short
of defeating ASU's balanced
foursome, 3:08.8 to 3:09.1.
A key to Arizona State's meet
victory was their strength in di
ving. By virtue of their 1-2
finishes in the one- and
three-meter competitions,
ASU gained a 16-2 advantage, a
point spread Stanford swim
mers were unable to over
come. Stanford's Mike Ray, a
promising and fast improving
diver, took third place on both
boards. Diving has been tradi
tionally weak at Stanford, but
coach Rick Schavone is work
ing hard this year to improve
Cardinal diving quality and
depth.
This afternoon at 2 p.m.,
Stanford faces talented Uni
versity of Arizona at deCuerre
Pool. A close and exciting meet
is expected, featuring many of
the nation's top swimmers.
