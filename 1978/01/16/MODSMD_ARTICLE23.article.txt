Walsh meeting expected
Stanford Athletic Director
joe Ruetz is expected to meet
with football coach Bill Walsh
today amid reports Walsh is
planning to become head
coach of the Los Angeles Rams
of the National Football
League.
The Associated Press re
ported yesterday that sources
in the Stanford athletic de
partment have said Ruetz will
offer Walsh a salary increase.
Sources close to Walsh, AP
reported, said Walsh plans to
meet with Rams' officials Tues
day for their first face-to-face
discussion after numerous
phone calls.
Walsh could not be reached
for comment.
Rams' owner Carroll
Rosenbloom said Saturday,
"My hiring practices have been

well documented many times.
I don't talk to a man just once
before I hire him. We have said
for publication that it will take
two or three weeks to make a
decision — if we make one that
soon."
Should Walsh choose to
leave Stanford, a Card assistant
coach — either receiver coach
Rod Dowhower or secondary
coach George Seifert — would
likely be his successor. Seifert
was a top candidate for the
head coaching position before
Walsh was chosen. Dowhower
has been often credited by the
Stanford players as having a
large role with the emergence
of James Lofton as one of col
lege football's top receivers
last season.
Ruggers sweep
All three of Stanford's rugby
squads opened their seasons

with victories over St. Mary's
Saturday on muddy turf in
Moraga.
Gordy Riegel and Denis
Shanagher each scored a try
and Jeff Morris added a con
version as Stanford I downed
St. Mary's I, 10-0. Stanford II
triumphed 8-oover St. Mary's II
as Gary Marenzi and Redmond
Burke each tallied a try. Stan
ford 111 won, 34-0.
Fencers get win
Stanford's fencing match
with UC-SantaCruz Saturday at
Roble Gym was forfeited to the
Cards when the visitors' coach
failed to show. According to
Stanford fencing coach Jean
Helliwell, UC-Santa Cruz
brought along an under
graduate as coach, but North
ern California Athletic Confer
ence rules require that the

coach be at least of graduate
standing. "They had to turn
around and go home again,"
said Helliwell.
Women gymnasts triumph
In their first intercollegiate
meet, the Stanford women's
gymnastics team downed Cal
State-Northridge Saturday at
Encina Gym. Saundra
Muramatsu led the Cards to
the win by capturing three of
the four events in addition to
the all-around competition.
Muramatsu highlighted the
Stanford effort with a 9.35
score on the uneven parallel
bars, the only event the Stan
ford team did not win.
Muramatsu captured the vault
ing event with an 8.65 score
and the floor exercise with a
9.25 performance.
She won the all-around with

a 34.70 mark, ahead of Kathy
Malone's 30.40 for Cal State-
Northridge and Stanford's
Linda Parks with 31.5. The
Cards' Dana Padden finished
fifth with 27.00.
Parks deadlocked Cal
State-Northridge's Sharon Sine
for first in the balance beam
with a 7.6 score.
"It was kind of exciting to
win our first women's meet
ever at Stanford/' said Stan
ford coach Jackie Walker. "We
did better than I had ex
pected."
White chosen
Stanford field hockey player
Nancy White has been selected
to the United States field hoc
key squad which will compete
against the national team of
Trinidad in April in Trinidad.
