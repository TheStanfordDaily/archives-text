# Card gridders pick up winnings

### 
Ten Stanford football players
— five alumni and five who are
soon to be alumni — were in
the spotlight over the
weekend. And all 10 of them
are richer this morning than
they were Saturday morning.
The ones who won the most
money play for the Dallas
Cowboys, the winners of yes
terday's Super Bowl. Two of
the former Cards — offensive
tackle Pat Donovan and cor
nerback Benny Barnes — each
were starters in the Cowboys'
27-10 win over the Denver
Broncos. Barnes intercepted
one of four passes picked off
by the Cowboys.
The other two Stanford
alumni for Dallas are running
back Scott Laidlaw, who car
ried the ball once, and punt re
turner Tony Hill, who probably
wished one time he hadn't
touched the ball.
Hill, an effective punt re
turner for the Cowboys during
the later stages of the season,
fielded a Denver punt early in
the game on his own 4-yard
line when he probably should
have let it go. He fumbled the
ball, but under a swarm of
players, Cowboy Charlie Wat
ers somehow managed to re
cover the loose ball on about
the 1-yard line. Then the Cow
boys worked their way out of
trouble.
For winning two play-off
games and the Super Bowl,
each Dallas player receives

$32,000. Randy Poltl, another
Stanford alumnus, will receive
$23,000 as a member of the De
niver Broncos.
The monetary stakes weren't
as high Saturday in Seattle's
Kingdome, but when there's
$1200 per man for the taking,
that's still a nice bundle to
have. And five Stanford players
from last season's 9-3 team can
add that amount to their assets
now.
The Cards had some key
roles in the Pacific-B's27-20 win
over the Big Ten in the first
Challenge Bowl, which pitted
seniors from the two confer
ences against each other.
Quarterback Guy Benjamin
completed seven of 22 passes
for 154 yards and one*
touchdown, but he had three
passes intercepted.
The touchdown went to
James Lofton on a 48-yard pass
in the second quarter. Lofton
was the game's top pass re
ceiver with six catches for 158
yards.
The other Cards participat
ing in the game were receiver
Bill Kellar, offensive tackle
Gordon King and linebacker
Ray Cardinalli.
Lofton's touchdown catch
staked the Pac-8 to a 20-0 lead.
The Big Ten scored one
touchdown before half and
then added two more in the
third quarter to pull within
27-20 before the scoreless
fourth quarter.
