Egypt, Israel to resume peace talks
Jerusalem — After a day of uncertainty, Egypt's foreign
minister arrived here last night for resumed Egyptian-
Israeli peace talks, now delayed until tomorrow because
of a dispute over the agenda.
Sources here said the dispute involved the agenda's
wording on the Palestinian issue. A U.S. official in
Washington said it was settled when the two sides ag
reed on "neutral" language for dealing with the issue.
The Israeli cabinet, meeting in a critical session yes
terday morning, adopted revisions in its agenda prop
osal. The revisions were flashed to Sadat through the
U.S. ambassadors in Tel Aviv and Cairo, and the way was
cleared for the talks to begin.
Egypt wants to discuss "self-determination" for the 1.1
million Palestinians living under Israeli rule on the West
Bank of the Jordan River and in the Gaza Strip. Sadat has
interpreted the phrase as a stepping-stone to an inde
pendent Palestinian state, possibly linked with Jordan.
Attacker kills two at sorority
Tallahassee, Fla. — A club-wielding attacker crept into
a sorority house at Florida State University early yester
day and strangled two women, one with his bare hands,
after beating them senseless and raping one of them,
police said.
Two other women in the house were also severely
beaten, and a short time later, another student who was
not a member of the sorority was beaten at her home
nearby.
Police said they could not be sure there was a connec
tion between the two attacks, but Leon County Sheriff
Ken Katsaris said a 1-inch by 2-inch board was found at
the fifth victim's home, and a man with a club was seen
rushing from the sorority house.
After autopsies were performed on the women, who
had been sleeping in separate rooms, a sheriff's official
said both were choked to death, at least one by bare
hands, and one had been raped.
Katsaris said the killer passed rooms where other girls
were sleeping before entering the rooms where the
attacks took place.

Police said all 32 women in the Chi Omega sorority
house were asleep during the attacks against the four
residents, but the assailant was spotted by one woman
as she returned shortly after 3 a.m. from a date.
Carter popularity drops in poll
Washington — Americans' rating of President Jimmy
Carter's performance in office has continued its down
ward slide despite his recent overseas trip, an As
sociated Press-NBC News poll shows.
Only 41 percent of those interviewed rated Carter's
overall performance as excellent or good. About 57 per
cent rated his performance only fair or poor, with the
remaining two percent undecided.
That rating is the lowest for Carter since he entered
office one year ago.
Ecuador approves new constitution
Quito, Ecuador — Ecuadorians voted on a new con
stitution yesterday in a referendum that could break the
almost solid wall of military rule in South America.
With about two-thirds of the vote counted, election
officials announced that what has been called the "new"
constitution, giving strong guarantees of workers'
rights, received 47.9 percent of the vote; a "reformed
1945" constitution had 31.4 percent.
The choice was between two civilian-rule constitu
tions drafted by lawyers appointed by Rear Adm. Alfredo
Poveda's junta, which seized power from another milit
ary regime two years ago. Ecuador is now in its sixth year
of military rule.
The government has said presidential elections will
take place July 16 even if voters heed opposition calls to
reject both constitutions. It plans to impose the con
stitution winning more votes, even if it does not win a
majority.
Today's weather
Rain or showers likely through tomorrow.
South to southwest winds 15 to 30 mph through to
night. Lows in the mid and upper 40s. Highs mid and
upper 50s. Chance of rain 70 percent today and 70 per
cent tonight.
