### 
Washington (AP) — Hubert Hum
phrey was eulogized by President
limmy Carter yesterday as "the most
beloved of all Americans" and an in
spiration to all the presidents of his
time.
At a memorial service in the
Rotunda of the Capitol, Carter spoke
in farewell to the Minnesota senator,
former vice president and sometime
political rival, saying that when
Humphrey first visited him in the
Oval Office, "I felt that he should
have served there."
Former Presidents Richard Nixon
and Gerald Ford, and Lady Bird
Johnson, wife of the late President
Lyndon Johnson, were among the of
ficial mourners at the nationally tele
vised service.
"We and our families are here
today to testify that Hubert Hum
phrey may well have blessed our
country more than any of us," Carter
said.
Happy Warrior
Before the flag-draped coffin of
the fallen Happy Warrior, the leaders
of American government gathered in
Washington's final tribute.
The Senate in which he served, the
House, the Cabinet, the Supreme
Court, all assembled where Hum
phrey had lain in state since Satur
day, while thousands of citizens filed

past the coffin.
In Minnesota, his home state,
thousands more lined up in near
zero temperatures outside the
Capitol in St. Paul and began walking
slowly in a double line past the casket
last night after it was flown from
Washington aboard a presidential
jet.
The body was to lie in state all last
night and this morning. A funeral
service in St. Paul and burial in Min
neapolis were scheduled for Monday
afternoon.

Mrs. Humphrey, Vice President
Walter Mondale, his wife Joan, the
Humphreys' three sons and daugh
ter and eight grandchildren traveled
with the body from Washington and
attended a private service in the
Minnesota Capitol before the build
ing was opened to the public.
Carter planned to fly to Minnesota
today to attend the funeral.
"Fie was simply incredible," said
the grieving Mondale, recalling his
first meetingwith Humphrey 31 years
ago. "When he said that life was not
meant to be endured but rather to be
enjoyed, you knew what he meant.
You could see it simply by watching
and listening to him. . . .
"He taught us all how to hope and
how to love, how to win and how to

lose. He taught us how to live and,
finally, he taught us how to die."
And although Humphrey never
realized his greatest goal, the presi
dency he sought so long, Mondale
said that he achieved something
more rare and valuable than that of
fice.
'Country's conscience'
"He became his country's consci
ence," Mondale said.
Carter and Mondale both spoke of
Humphrey's early advocacy of civil
rights for black Americans, the issue
that split the Democratic Party in
1948.
Twenty years later, Humphrey led
that party, divided again, this time
over the war in Vietnam, in a presi
dential campaign that barely lost.
Nixon defeated him, and it was
Humphrey's death that led the res
igned president to return to
Washington for the first time since
Watergate and its aftermath forced
him from the White House.
Nixon flew to Washington from
Los Angeles Saturday on a commer
cial airliner, and planned to return
today. His daughter, Tricia, accom
panied him at the service.
Humphrey, 66, lost his long and
valiant battle with cancer at 9:25 p.m.
CST Friday at his home in Waverly,
Minnesota.

Washington (AP) — Hubert Hum
phrey was eulogized by President
limmy Carter yesterday as "the most
beloved of all Americans" and an in
spiration to all the presidents of his
time.
At a memorial service in the
Rotunda of the Capitol, Carter spoke
in farewell to the Minnesota senator,
former vice president and sometime
political rival, saying that when
Humphrey first visited him in the
Oval Office, "I felt that he should
have served there."
Former Presidents Richard Nixon
and Gerald Ford, and Lady Bird
Johnson, wife of the late President
Lyndon Johnson, were among the of
ficial mourners at the nationally tele
vised service.
"We and our families are here
today to testify that Hubert Hum
phrey may well have blessed our
country more than any of us," Carter
said.
Happy Warrior
Before the flag-draped coffin of
the fallen Happy Warrior, the leaders
of American government gathered in
Washington's final tribute.
The Senate in which he served, the
House, the Cabinet, the Supreme
Court, all assembled where Hum
phrey had lain in state since Satur
day, while thousands of citizens filed

past the coffin.
In Minnesota, his home state,
thousands more lined up in near
zero temperatures outside the
Capitol in St. Paul and began walking
slowly in a double line past the casket
last night after it was flown from
Washington aboard a presidential
jet.
The body was to lie in state all last
night and this morning. A funeral
service in St. Paul and burial in Min
neapolis were scheduled for Monday
afternoon.
Travelers
Mrs. Humphrey, Vice President
Walter Mondale, his wife Joan, the
Humphreys' three sons and daugh
ter and eight grandchildren traveled
with the body from Washington and
attended a private service in the
Minnesota Capitol before the build
ing was opened to the public.
Carter planned to fly to Minnesota
today to attend the funeral.
"Fie was simply incredible," said
the grieving Mondale, recalling his
first meetingwith Humphrey 31 years
ago. "When he said that life was not
meant to be endured but rather to be
enjoyed, you knew what he meant.
You could see it simply by watching
and listening to him. . . .
"He taught us all how to hope and
how to love, how to win and how to

lose. He taught us how to live and,
finally, he taught us how to die."
And although Humphrey never
realized his greatest goal, the presi
dency he sought so long, Mondale
said that he achieved something
more rare and valuable than that of
fice.
'Country's conscience'
"He became his country's consci
ence," Mondale said.
Carter and Mondale both spoke of
Humphrey's early advocacy of civil
rights for black Americans, the issue
that split the Democratic Party in
1948.
Twenty years later, Humphrey led
that party, divided again, this time
over the war in Vietnam, in a presi
dential campaign that barely lost.
Nixon defeated him, and it was
Humphrey's death that led the res
igned president to return to
Washington for the first time since
Watergate and its aftermath forced
him from the White House.
Nixon flew to Washington from
Los Angeles Saturday on a commer
cial airliner, and planned to return
today. His daughter, Tricia, accom
panied him at the service.
Humphrey, 66, lost his long and
valiant battle with cancer at 9:25 p.m.
