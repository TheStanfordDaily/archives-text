# Can mailing urges container legislation
## 
### Lane Webster 
Guzzle the last drops of a Coke
and toss it in the nearest — mail
box? That's right, if first you ad
dress it to President )immy Carter,
says loan Larkins, coordinator of
the Stanford end of the nation
wide "Mail-A-Can to Carter"
campaign.
The drive urges President Car
ter to introduce mandatory be
verage deposit legislation, she
said.
Students will be manning a
booth in White Plaza today and
tomorrow to provide labels ad
dressed to Carter for can-carrying
people willing to pay the 13 cent
postage, she said.
Known as "the bottle bill," the
legislation would allow customers
to get money from the places
where they buy the beverages for
any bottles returned. "The con
sumer would get deposit money
from the retailer, who would get it
from the wholesaler, and so on
down the line," said Jeff Ryan,
member of a SWOPSI conserva
tion course.
"It would encourage more re
turns by giving an incentive," said
Larkins. "It cuts down on litter,
solid waste and energy used up in
melting cans down," she said.
Current laws do not do the job,

she noted. "California's passed a
litter tax so the price of soft drinks
and beer include the cost of pick
ing up the junk," she said.
But that law backfires. "It en
courages the throw away ethic: if I
paid for the litter, I might as well
drop it," Larkins commented.
Ryan found another problem.
The taxpayer must now pay the
cost of cleaning up the junk, he
said. "The burden should be on
the consumers of the beverages.
They should be paying the whole
price," he said.
So far mandatory deposit legis
lation has been "bottled up" in
Congressional committees, said
Ryan.
"Lobbyists are so powerful," he
said. "It's the aluminum com
panies in particular. Also it's a big
hassle for the beverage com
panies to switch over from cans to
bottles. The supermarkets don't
like it either," he added, because
they must honor the deposits im
mediately and wait for their re
funds.
Yet once the laws are passed,
they work, he said. Before it in
itiated the legislation, Oregon
was consuming 60 percent bottled
beverages and 40 percent canned,
he said. "Now it's up toBo percent
bottles and 20 percent cans."

was consuming 60 percent bottled
beverages and 40 percent canned,

Guzzle the last drops of a Coke
and toss it in the nearest — mail
box? That's right, if first you ad
dress it to President )immy Carter,
says loan Larkins, coordinator of
the Stanford end of the nation
wide "Mail-A-Can to Carter"
campaign.
The drive urges President Car
ter to introduce mandatory be
verage deposit legislation, she
said.
Students will be manning a
booth in White Plaza today and
tomorrow to provide labels ad
dressed to Carter for can-carrying
people willing to pay the 13 cent
postage, she said.
Known as "the bottle bill," the
legislation would allow customers
to get money from the places
where they buy the beverages for
any bottles returned. "The con
sumer would get deposit money
from the retailer, who would get it
from the wholesaler, and so on
down the line," said Jeff Ryan,
member of a SWOPSI conserva
tion course.
"It would encourage more re
turns by giving an incentive," said
Larkins. "It cuts down on litter,
solid waste and energy used up in
melting cans down," she said.
Current laws do not do the job,

she noted. "California's passed a
litter tax so the price of soft drinks
and beer include the cost of pick
ing up the junk," she said.
But that law backfires. "It en
courages the throw away ethic: if I
paid for the litter, I might as well
drop it," Larkins commented.
Ryan found another problem.
The taxpayer must now pay the
cost of cleaning up the junk, he
said. "The burden should be on
the consumers of the beverages.
They should be paying the whole
price," he said.
So far mandatory deposit legis
lation has been "bottled up" in
Congressional committees, said
Ryan.
"Lobbyists are so powerful," he
said. "It's the aluminum com
panies in particular. Also it's a big
hassle for the beverage com
panies to switch over from cans to
bottles. The supermarkets don't
like it either," he added, because
they must honor the deposits im
mediately and wait for their re
funds.
Yet once the laws are passed,
they work, he said. Before it in
itiated the legislation, Oregon
was consuming 60 percent bottled
beverages and 40 percent canned,
he said. "Now it's up toBo percent
bottles and 20 percent cans."
