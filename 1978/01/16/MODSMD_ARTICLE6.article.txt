# Mancall hosts Berlin studies center opening
## 
### Caryn Coulder 
Overseas Studies Director Mark
Mancall left for Berlin Thursday to
host today's official opening cere
mony of the University's Villa
Muthesius study center in Germany.
The ceremony will celebrate the
opening of the Stanford-in-Berlin
campus in it's recently renovated
headquarters and will be attended by
University administrators, profes
sors and*students as well as German
officials and German alumni of Stan
ford.
The official fanfare will signal the
first academic quarter that Villa
Muthesius has been used to house
the entire student and faculty group
and its academic activities under a
single roof.
Throughout its four years of opera
tion, the Berlin program's students
have lived in private German homes.
Connie Burton, assistant director of
student services, said the new villa is
the most affordable alternative to the
expensive individual housing system
which was relied upon at the prog
ram's inception.
Among the officials who will be
presenting the Berlin facility to its
host country are Provost William Mil
ler, German Studies Chairman Wal
ter Lohnes, Director of the Berlin
Center Paul Robinson and Robert
Ward, head of the Center for Re
search in International Studies.
The use of the 20th-century-style
Villa Muthesius was made possible
primarily through the assistance of

the West German government, out
of gratitude for the role played by
History Prof. Cordon Craig in the es
tablishment of Berlin's Free Univer
sity after World War 11.
Burton said, "The West German
government was so eager to keep the
Stanford affiliation with the Univer
sity that it agreed to perform all of the
Villa renovations to our specifica
tions. Otherwise, we weren't going
to be able to afford any other type of
facility in the Berlin area."
The Overseas Office considers the
bulk of the cost-cutting contribu
tions of the German government as
"almost a diplomatic gift," Burton
said.
The villa currently has room for 34
students per quarter, making it the
fifth largest overseas campus, follow
ing Cliveden, Florence, Tours and
Vienna. The campus is open winter
and spring quarters only, with an op
tion for second-quarter students to
enroll in courses at either of the Ber
lin universities.
Stanford-in-Berlin is unique be
cause of its proximity to communist
East Berlin, to which Stanford stu
dents enjoy relatively free access,
and because Berlin is a major
sociocultural center of Europe. Fa
culty for 1978 include Craig, German
professor Gerhard Huber, Free Uni
versity of Berlin alumni Paul Robin
son and Franz Neckenig, and laugage
program coordinator Pat
McConeghy.

The official fanfare will signal the
first academic quarter that Villa
Muthesius has been used to house
the entire student and faculty group
and its academic activities under a
single roof.
Throughout its four years of opera
tion, the Berlin program's students
have lived in private German homes.
Connie Burton, assistant director of
student services, said the new villa is
the most affordable alternative to the
expensive individual housing system
which was relied upon at the prog
ram's inception.
Among the officials who will be
presenting the Berlin facility to its
host country are Provost William Mil
ler, German Studies Chairman Wal
ter Lohnes, Director of the Berlin
Center Paul Robinson and Robert
Ward, head of the Center for Re
search in International Studies.
The use of the 20th-century-style
Villa Muthesius was made possible
primarily through the assistance of

the West German government, out
of gratitude for the role played by
History Prof. Cordon Craig in the es
tablishment of Berlin's Free Univer
sity after World War 11.
Burton said, "The West German
government was so eager to keep the
Stanford affiliation with the Univer
sity that it agreed to perform all of the
Villa renovations to our specifica
tions. Otherwise, we weren't going
to be able to afford any other type of
facility in the Berlin area."
The Overseas Office considers the
bulk of the cost-cutting contribu
tions of the German government as
"almost a diplomatic gift," Burton
said.
The villa currently has room for 34
students per quarter, making it the
fifth largest overseas campus, follow
ing Cliveden, Florence, Tours and
Vienna. The campus is open winter
and spring quarters only, with an op
tion for second-quarter students to
enroll in courses at either of the Ber
lin universities.
Stanford-in-Berlin is unique be
cause of its proximity to communist
East Berlin, to which Stanford stu
dents enjoy relatively free access,
and because Berlin is a major
sociocultural center of Europe. Fa
culty for 1978 include Craig, German
professor Gerhard Huber, Free Uni
versity of Berlin alumni Paul Robin
son and Franz Neckenig, and laugage
program coordinator Pat
McConeghy.
