## Reflecting on LBJ

It was five years ago this month
that Lyndon Baines Johnson passed
away. The fifth anniversary of his
death provides an opportunity to re
flect on his use and misuse of power,
and to remember a war that must
never be forgotten.
LBJ's years in the White House
typified the classic tragedy, marked
first by his rise after the assassination
of John Kennedy and then by his des
cent as he, too, fell victim to the hor
ror of Indochina. His valuable ac
complishments at home came to be
overshadowed by his failures
abroad.
This Texan's first 15 months in of
fice saw the start of his vision of a
Great Society. Though his programs
depended on liberal reform rather
than on radical overhaul, they still led
to such monumental achievements
as the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Vot
ing Rights Bill of 1965, as well as Med
icare and federal aid to education.
Vietnam
But then came LBJ's last 3V2 years as
president, when he marched this
country into the quagmire of Viet
nam. He sent over 35,000 American
men to their deaths during those
years. Over 4,000,000 Indochinese
were killed, wounded, or refugeed.
Antiwar demonstrations rang with
the cry, "Hey, hey, LBJ! How many
more did you kill today?" as
Johnson's vision of a Great Society
crumbled.
Thus there were two Lyndon
Johnsons we remember today. There
was the Lyndon Johnson of the Great
Society, the president who rode the
wave of a vast amount of social legis
lation, who told Congress only five
days after succeeding to the presi
dency, "We have talked longenough
in this country about equal rights.
We have talked for 100 years or more.
It is time now to write it in the books
of law."
This was the Lyndon Johnson who
had a more gentle side to the per
sonality that we remember now as
coarse and temperamental. As col
umnist Carl Rowan wrote after LBJ

died, "Johnson was at heart a sen
timentalist — the kind of man who
would weep in San Antonio during
the 1964 campaign when an aged
black man stood in the back of a pick
up truck at a shopping center and
said: 'I'm a black man, born two
blocks from this spot. I never
dreamed I'd live to see the day when
a Mexican congressman would in
troduce me so I could ask you to vote
for a white Texan for president.'
"And Johnson," Rowan con
tinued, "would dismiss his tears with
the comment that 'a man ain't worth
a goddamn if he can't cry at the right
time.' "
Bill Moyers, LB|'s press secretary,
also wrote, "He was, inside, a soft
man. I saw him weep as he watched
television reports from Selma,
Alabama. 'My God,' he said, 'those
are people they're beating. Thoseare
Americans.' "
Other Johnson
But there was also the other Lyn
don Johnson, the one we marched
against. His anguish over seeing
black people beaten in Selma was
not the type to dissuade him from
murdering the Vietnamese, of whom
he could not say, "Those are Ameri
cans."

In the end, the flames that en
gulfed Vietnam reached the United
States as well and destroyed the
career of a president. Despairing of
peace and cognizant of his own polit
ical situation, Johnson stunned a na
tion by announcing he would not
seek re-election. On the night of
March 31,1968 we saw and heard an
old, wrinkled man — the tragic, al
most pathetic remains of a once
powerful president who had held the
reins of a Great Society. He lived his
last years in quiet recluse and went
almost forgotten at the 1972 Democ
ratic Convention. The war in Vietnam
came to outlive him.
And so, five years later, we re
member LBJ's presidency with mixed
emotions. Despite what he did in In
dochina, there was another side to
this man that was never to be found
in his successor. The great tragedy of
Lyndon Johnson, and the far
reaching paradox of his political life,
will forever lie in the fact that al
though he pursued a policy of social
justice at home, he unleashed a
nightmare of bloodshed abroad.
