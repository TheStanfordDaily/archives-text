# Poverty: a problem that merits Carter's concern

If a free society cannot help the many
who are poor, it cannot save the few
who are rich.
-John F. Kennedy, January 20, 1961
President Kennedy's philosophic
warning in his inaugural address 16
years ago has direct, practical appli
cation to the problem of poverty in
the world today and merits the con
cern of both the Carter Administra
tion and the general public.
The facts, statistics and details re

garding poverty in the world are re
ported week after week in almost
every newspaper, magazine and
evening newscast. One need only
open the newspaper and read the
headlines: 25 million Americans live
in poverty, Economy stagnating in
poorest nations, 400 million people
face starvation in the world today.
And yet it seems that aside from
those domestic economic problems
which affect the "American pocket
book" directly, we have become

immune to the startling reality ot
poverty in the world.
Perhaps one of the hardest facts
the Carter Administration must face
is that poverty has become an inhe
rent aspect of our domestic and in
ternational economic system. This
presents us with the disheartening
observation that we live in a "zero
sum" economy â€” where the wealth
of one class or one nation is built
upon the poverty of another class or
nation. The gross economic asym
metries between the rich and the
poor bear this out.
National poverty
Although domestic poverty is
more subtle and less widespread
than the poverty found in such poor
nations as Chad and Bangladesh,
economic disparities still exist within
the United States. Everyone is aware
of high unemployment and the
steadily increasing cost of living, but
the roots of poverty and discrimina
tion run deep into the economic sys
tem and are often less apparent than
simple price indices. Poverty is heav
ily concentrated among minority
groups. Unemployment among
young blacks, for example, may
reach as high as 60 per cent. These
trends stem from years of economic
and political repression and a clear
denial of "equal opportunity." In
1975, the federal government de
fined the poverty level for a family of
four at an annual income of $5500. At
this bare subsistance level some 25
million Americans or 12 per cent of
the nation qualified as poor.
The domestic situation has re
vealed some hope for.the poor. The
commitment started by President
Johnson to fight the "war on pov
erty" and support civil rights legisla
tion has helped balance the in
equities of the nation and move us

closer to achieving economic justice.
Despite the fact that the major im
pact of the war on poverty was de
nied in favor of expenditures on
another war, and although aban
doned during the Nixon years, such
programs to assist the poor await re
kindling in the future. For example,
President Carter has within his
power the option to propose legisla
tion which would help ameliorate
the economic burdens of the poor
through tax benefits, income redis
tribution, increased government
jobs, a national health care plan and
similar programs.
International poverty
However, domestic improvement
will be short lived unless our
economic and political relationships
with other nations follow suit.
The Washington Post reported that
the poorest nations of the world,
comprising one billion people,
showed no economic growth in the
past five years. In addition, the na
tional debts of these Third and
Fourth World nations have in
creased. Among the less developed
countries (LDCs), where per capita
gross national product (CNP) ranges
Irom about $50-$5OO per year as
compared to the U.S. per capita GNP
of $6200, malnutrition, starvation and
complete poverty are rife. The LDCs
seem to remain steadily behind the
developed world with little sign of
improvement.
The cause of this poverty is built
into the current international
economic order. The world is be
coming more interdependent as can
be seen from increases in interna
tional trade, foreign investment and
transgovernmental dealings. How
ever, this interdependence is highly
asymmetrical. As a result, less de
veloped nations are much more de
pendent on U.S. support than the
United States is on their trade. Thus,
the economies of many nations in
Latin America, Asia and Africa fluc
tuate at the will of the United States
and other exploiting nations.
The LDCs are dependent on indus
trialized states for export sales,
commercial capital flows and foreign
aid. In addition, if development does
occur it is usually capital intensive
and one in low priority sectors. The
overall result is that the Third World

nations remain in poverty, increase
their debts and have little chance to
develop to their benefit. This condi
tion has been perpetuated by
exploiting nations which have built
dominance into the system through
highly industrialized, capital inten
sive development of often unneeded
manufactured products as well as
technological monopoly and control
of capital with regulation of trade,
tariff and expansion.
Intense conflict
Colonial and imperialistic exploita
tion of Third World raw materials,
increased dependency of the LDCs
on the United States and ineffective
foreign aid have left the current
world economic order with intense
conflict dividing the world into two
factions: poor vs. rich. Furthermore,
even within our own nation conflicts
exist between those who are poor,
unemployed or discriminated
against those who wish to maintain
the status quo.
The solution that the United States
has found domestically is to make
incremental changes through legisla
tion and reform, and, indeed, the
situation of conflict in the world can
be improved along the same lines.
The United States should make
gradual and yet significant conces
sions to such Third World demands
as commodity pricing agreements,
development and technology assis
tance, aid and loan agreements, and
the opening of markets. The U.S.
must rejuvenate, improve and in
crease spending on such foreign aid
programs as the Peace Corps and
Food for Peace, as well as assisting
efforts for world food and monetary
organization.
A proposal for economic harmony
is highly idealistic and most likely will
not be fulfilled in the near future.
Flowever, the United States sitsat the
fulcrum of world order, and with that
position a concerted national effort
led by the administration in
Washington could turn the tide of
events and lead the United States in
the right direction toward avoiding
conflict, achieving world coopera
tion and maintaining President Ken
nedy's pledge to assist the poor.
