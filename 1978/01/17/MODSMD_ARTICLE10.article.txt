# Photo policy played role

One of the reasons which police say led them to obtain a
warrant for a search of the Daily's offices was a February 1970
policy of the Daily entitled "Politics and Photos." It stated:
1) Photographers will be assigned to newsworthy events,
and they will remain until explicitly excluded. If they or their
equipment are harmed, the Daily will press charges through
campus and community judicial bodies. However, the Daily
will not withhold news coverage to force access for its
photographers.
2) The Daily will print newsworthy photographs regard
less of their potential for incrimination. This is essential to
full coverage of events.
3) Negatives which may be used to convict protestors will
be destroyed. We feel that a line can and should be drawn at
this point between journalistic responsibility and coopera
tion with government authorities in protests that are often
directed against the government. Once a story has been
printed, pictures taken with it are rarely used again. How
ever, negatives which may never appear in the paper may be
used to convict demonstrators.
The Daily feels no obligation to help in the prosecution of
students for crimes related to political activity. Our purpose
is to gather information for our readers, not for police files.
