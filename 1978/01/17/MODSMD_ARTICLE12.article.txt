# Those involved reflect on case
## 
### 
It's not every day that you
wake up and find a case which
involves you will be argued be
fore the nation's highest court.
It's been almost seven years
since the search which brought
about today's Supreme Court
review occurred in April 1971.
And since the turbulent days of
that early '70s don't compare
with today's events, the lapse
of years is heightened.
Looking back on the search
and reflecting on the signifi
cance of a Supreme Court case
brought about different reac
tions from those involved in
the case.
When asked what he would
do if the Supreme Court re
verses the lower courts' deci
sions and declares the search
constitutional, Palo Alto Police
Chief James Zurcher re
sponded, "I recognize the First
Amendment problem and I
truly understand what news
papers have to do. I would cer
tainly give a lot of thought to
any third-party searches in the
future."
Louis Bergna, district of
Santa Clara County, declined
comment on the case.
Felicity Barringer, Daily
editor at the time of the search,
said she remembers "return
ing from an English poetry
class, walking into the office
and finding polite,

businesslike police officers
poking their noses into every
thing."
Recalling the emotional days
of the early 70s, Barnnger said
"it is odd to have that emo
tional quality reduced to black
and white now, to see it be
come an issue of legal princi
ple."
Fred Mann, managing editor
in the spring of 1971, said the
plaintiffs "undertook the case

with hope of making substan
tial law in an area where there
was no precedent. I'm happy
being there (before the Sup
reme Court) but realistically,
with the make up of the court,
it's not very favorable for us."
Hall Daily, former sports
editor, said "I remain hopeful
it will be resolved in our favor
for the sake of a lot more
people than the Daily. Resolu
tion in our favor will bode well
for freedom of press on all

levels."
Robert Litterman, former
opinions editor, expressed
tnat he's hopeful because "we
have a good case."
Steven Ungar, a former Daily
copy editor who also had the
then-hazardous position of
photographer, remarked that
he's "optimistic" and said "I'd
be shocked if they overturned
the First Amendment part of
the case."

Fred Mann, managing editor
in the spring of 1971, said the
plaintiffs "undertook the case

with hope of making substan
tial law in an area where there
was no precedent. I'm happy
being there (before the Sup
reme Court) but realistically,
with the make up of the court,
it's not very favorable for us."
Hall Daily, former sports
editor, said "I remain hopeful
it will be resolved in our favor
for the sake of a lot more
people than the Daily. Resolu
tion in our favor will bode well
for freedom of press on all

levels."
Robert Litterman, former
opinions editor, expressed
tnat he's hopeful because "we
have a good case."
Steven Ungar, a former Daily
copy editor who also had the
then-hazardous position of
photographer, remarked that
he's "optimistic" and said "I'd
be shocked if they overturned
the First Amendment part of
the case."
