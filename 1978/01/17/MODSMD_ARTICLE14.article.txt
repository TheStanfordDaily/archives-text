Who won the first Big Came football contest between
Stanford and the University of California?
How and why was the Stanford Research Institute estab
lished at Stanford?
What sorts of people have served on the Stanford Board
of Trustees since the University was established in 1891?
Answers to these and thousands of other questions
about Stanford University can be found in the University
Archives, an office that is tucked away in a third floorcorner
of Green Library.
Here, one can see almost everything from contemporary
campus posters to aging architectural blueprints. The arc
hives, most of which are stored in the basement of the
library, include copies of all Stanford masters theses and
Ph.D. dissertations, all issues of the Daily and the Quad,
minutes of Trustees meetings, papers of past University
presidents, trustees, prominent alumni and faculty, stu
dent diaries, scrapbooks and much more.
"It's a gold mine of information about Stanford and this
area," said Roxanne-Louise Nilan, assistant archivist. She
lamented, however, that the Archives is "definitely unde
rutilized."
The 1976-77 Annual Report of the Archives indicated that
only 1950 persons made use of the Archives that year.
"I think many people have an idea that the Archives is a
dusty closet where we hide away old things," Nilan said.
"They don't realize it's a useable research collection and
that it has an awful lot in it."
For those who do discover the Archives, more than a gold
mine of information awaits them. Visitors and researchers
are allowed to use the Timothy Hopkins Reading Room.
