# Rain doesn't dampen sales
##

It could rain for the next 40
days and 40 nights and Tom Ali,
the manager of Stanford Shell
on El Camino Real, couldn't be
happier.
And his joy would have no
thing to do with the drought.
His business increases about
30 percent when it pours.
The rain is not good for all
businesses, but for some it is a
real boon.
Ali reports that gas sales at
his canopied self-service
pumps increase about 15 per
cent when it rains. Calls for
road service double. Batteries
wear out because people
forget to turn off lights and wet
ignition systems need encour
agement.
But the Cloudburst Car
Wash down *he stree f is hurt
ing. Business is off about 30
percent, according to the
operator.
Thecashierat the Fill'em Fast
self-service station on the next
block maintains that his busi
ness is as good as ever and
points to his customers who
hold umbrellas while filling
their cars.

The rain appears to be help
ing retail sales.
Macy's has sold "a ton of
boots" and more shoes than
usual, according to Cynthia
Jehning who has worked at
Macy's shoe department for
almost two years. She added
that people are also buying
more waterproofing for leather
shoes and boots.
A saleswoman in the coat
department said that coat sales
have been excellent all week,
especially warm raincoats.
"We've been bringing up
new merchandise all day," she
said.
Rain always increases the
volume of sales said one sales
person who has worked at Ma
cy's for 15 years.
Two women from Sunnyvale
and Palo Alto said that the rain
was "fun" for a while, but that
they "just wanted to get out for
the day." They hadn't planned
to buy anything special, but
had spent about $30.
Sales at liquor stores aren't
influenced by the weather, ac
cording to the manager of Er
nie's in Palo Alto. The manager
of Beltramo's in Menlo Park

said, "If you want a drink, it
doesn't matter whether it's
raining."
The bartender at the New
Varsity Restaurant and Theatre
in Palo Alto, Jim Cehnder, says
that the rain hurts business. He
thinks that people just don't
want to leave home when it's
wet.
People are less likely to run
out fora pizza when it's raining
says Hugh Bennett, supervisor
at Palo Alto's Straw Hat re
staurant. Take out orders are
down.
And at the Taco Tio on El
Camino, which offers only
outdoor seating, the manager
had sent home all but one of
the crew.
Bob Talbott, the bartender at
the Winery, says that in his 10
years of watching people come
and go he has seen the same
pattern.
"They stay home the first few
nights, then they get out the
umbrella and go," Talbott exp
lains. "The only real difference
is that people switch from
scotch and water to hot
brandy."
