# Reg holds rise
## 
### Hardy Iredale 
Over 3000 permits to register for this quarter were held by the
Registrar's office, owing either to unpaid bills or academic prob
lems.
Robert Houghton, associate registrar, said that despite the
slight rise in holds on registration (compared with winter quarter
last year), there has been no change in University policy regard
ing the holds.
About half of the holds are requested by the student account
ing office, Houghton said. The Office of Academic Credentials
and the University libraries are other major sources.
The remainder generally originate from Cowell Student Health
Center, various eating clubs and fraternities.
Requests for holds
Houghton said that over the years there have been requests
from local merchants to hold student registration because of
student debts or returned checks. Merchants have also asked
that the University handle processing of the account problems
through the University accounting system, but he said these
requests have always been turned down.
The only policy change, Houghton said, is "we are not issuing
transcripts at the request of students who have holds, and we are
not going to give grade sheets to students who have holds be
cause they can be used instead of transcripts."
He said students will still be allowed to see their records how
ever.
In cases where the Registrar's office has been contacted by
merchants, he said, "we might have given the merchant the
student's address, which we consider public information as it is in
the student directory."
Merchants referred
In some cases, Houghton said, merchants are referred to the
Office of the Dean of Student Affairs.
Dale Canelas, Meyer Library assistant librarian, said that "un
der ordinary circumstances, fines from previous quarters (mean
PTR's) are held at the end of that quarter unless there are major
extenuating circumstances."
Houghton said there have been a couple of instances where
students weren't aware of fines at the library because they lent
identification cards to others or because they lent borrowed
books to friends. Hence they unexpectedly find holds on their
registrations when they go to register.
Delinquent accounts
Joseph Jedd, manager of student accounting, said registration
holds are sent from his office for delinquent student accounts
and loans that have not been paid.
"For these things we have always withheld registrations," Jedd
said.
He said the figure for delinquent accounts is "continuously
changing." He said he hasn't noticed much change in University
policy, but said, "I have a feeling that students over the past few
years have been a little more reliable than, say, in the early
seventies."
