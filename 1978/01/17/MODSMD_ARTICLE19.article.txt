# 'No fun screams Rotten as fans pelt Sex Pistols
## 
### 
San Francisco— (AP) Sex Pistol Johnny Rotten
squatted amid human spit, tomatoes, umbrellas
and other assorted nasties to scream out the
final number of the band's first United States
tour.
"No fun. No fun. This is noooo fun. No fun,"
he wailed as his three fellow punk rockers
ducked flying debris and cranked out a
background racket with guitar, bass guitar and
drums.
It was a ballad to sum up just how Britain's
premier New Wave punk group felt about the
first United States visit, says Malcolm McLaren,
the band's founder and manager.
"I think they hated the entire tour," McLaren
said in a telephone interview Sunday. "It's been
an eyeopener for the band to realize England is a
helluva lot freer and a helluva lot more intelli
gent than America.
"I think their opinion is that most Americans
are a lot of dummies. They've seen everybody
obeying orders but nobody wanting to change
any."
The rebel band ended its seven-city tour
Saturday night before a sell-out crowd of 3,500
persons in San Francisco's Winterland au
ditorium.

McLaren said it was the worst show of the
tour. He said it typified everything the four
young musicians found wrong in America:
"They all thoughi the whole show as a very mis
erable '60s-hippie-fascist event, the very thing
they set out to destroy when they started this
band."
The Sex Pistols were formed in 1976 by McLa
ren as a counterpunch to big-name rock and
roll. Their loud songs like "I'm a Lazy Sod" and
"I'm Pretty Vacant" were designed to be about
"who and what they are," McLaren told Rolling
Stone magazine.
At Winterland, hundreds of young followers
stuck safety pins in their noses, uncombed their
hair in proper punk style and bounced up and
down — pogoed — just like British punksters.
But McLaren complained it wasn't good
enough. The crowd was too big, he said, too
tame. And he called the steady exchange of spit,
kicks and hurled ammunition between Pistols
and audience "a little too light-weight."
Asked to describe what would have happened
if the show had gone right, McLaren replied
simply: "Perhaps you would not have seen the
San Francisco Winterland anymore."
