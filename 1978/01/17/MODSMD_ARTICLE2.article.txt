# Italian premier resigns
## 
### 
Rome (AP) — Italy's 39th govern
ment since the overthrow of Fascism
in World War II fell yesterday. Pre
mier Ciulio Andreotti resigned in the
midst of economic turmoil, political
violence and a Communist drive for
power in this NATO country.
President Giovanni Leone
scheduled talks with political leaders
today and is expected to ask An
dreotti, 59, the three-time Christian
Democrat premier, to try to form a
new government by Thursday. But
long and difficult negotiations ap
peared certain.
The United States has strongly op
posed entry of the Communists in
the government where they would
share military information of the At
lantic Alliance.
If a cabinet cannot be formed,
elections for a new Parliament would
have to be held, but all parties op
pose this. Opinion polls indicate
elections would further polarize the
country, increasing support for the
Christian Democrats and Com
munistsat the expense of thesmaller
parties.
Political clashes
In the past three years, 27 persons
— including four this year — have
died in political clashes. Most of the
victims were youthful members of
extremist groups, including the
neo-fascist Italian Social Movement
on the right and urban guerrilla
groups such as the Red Brigades and
Armed Proletariat on the left.
Andreotti, who led a one-party
minority government for 17 months,
resigned after it became clear that
the largest Communist party in
Western Europe, supported by
Socialists and Republicans, would no
longer allow his government to con
tinue.
To avoid the prospect of new elec
tions that could aggravate the politi
cal crisis, the Christian Democrat
Party, which has ruled Italy alone or
in coalition since 1945, must find a
solution acceptable to the left —
cabinet posts for Communist
approved independents, a coalition
including the Socialists, policy con
cessions that would meet concerns
of the working class or some other
formula not yet aired publicly.
No Kremlin domination
The Communists, led by the
Eurocommunist Enrico Berlinguer,
gained 34 percent of the popular vote
in 1976 elections, just four points
short of the Christian Democrats. Ita
lian, French and Spanish Com
munists in the Eurocommunist
movement avow they are free of
Kremlin domination and claim they
would participate democratically in
the government of their countries.
As a result of the elections, the Ita
lian Communists won the presidency
of the Chamber of Deputies, the
lower house of Parliament, and key
posts on parliamentary commis
sions, then gained the backing of
other parties to force the Andreotti
government to accept their collab
oration in the formation of govern
ment policy in return for abstentions
in Parliament.
But the Communists, dissatisfied
with the government's implementa
tion of programs and worried about
possible loss of popular support, de
cided last week to end their coopera
tion with Andreotti's government
and try for their long-sought goal of a
"historic compromise" that would
allow them to share power with the
Christian Democrats.

longer allow his government to con
tinue.
To avoid the prospect of new elec
tions that could aggravate the politi
cal crisis, the Christian Democrat
Party, which has ruled Italy alone or
in coalition since 1945, must find a
solution acceptable to the left —
cabinet posts for Communist
approved independents, a coalition
including the Socialists, policy con
cessions that would meet concerns
of the working class or some other
formula not yet aired publicly.
No Kremlin domination
The Communists, led by the
Eurocommunist Enrico Berlinguer,
gained 34 percent of the popular vote
in 1976 elections, just four points
short of the Christian Democrats. Ita
lian, French and Spanish Com
munists in the Eurocommunist
movement avow they are free of
Kremlin domination and claim they
would participate democratically in
the government of their countries.
As a result of the elections, the Ita
lian Communists won the presidency
of the Chamber of Deputies, the
lower house of Parliament, and key
posts on parliamentary commis
sions, then gained the backing of
other parties to force the Andreotti
government to accept their collab
oration in the formation of govern
ment policy in return for abstentions
in Parliament.
But the Communists, dissatisfied
with the government's implementa
tion of programs and worried about
possible loss of popular support, de
cided last week to end their coopera
tion with Andreotti's government
and try for their long-sought goal of a
"historic compromise" that would
allow them to share power with the
Christian Democrats.
Rome (AP) — Italy's 39th govern
ment since the overthrow of Fascism
in World War II fell yesterday. Pre
mier Ciulio Andreotti resigned in the
midst of economic turmoil, political
violence and a Communist drive for
power in this NATO country.
President Giovanni Leone
scheduled talks with political leaders
today and is expected to ask An
dreotti, 59, the three-time Christian
Democrat premier, to try to form a
new government by Thursday. But
long and difficult negotiations ap
peared certain.
The United States has strongly op
posed entry of the Communists in
the government where they would
share military information of the At
lantic Alliance.
If a cabinet cannot be formed,
elections for a new Parliament would
have to be held, but all parties op
pose this. Opinion polls indicate
elections would further polarize the
country, increasing support for the
Christian Democrats and Com
munistsat the expense of thesmaller
parties.
Political clashes
In the past three years, 27 persons
— including four this year — have
died in political clashes. Most of the
victims were youthful members of
extremist groups, including the
neo-fascist Italian Social Movement
on the right and urban guerrilla
groups such as the Red Brigades and
Armed Proletariat on the left.
Andreotti, who led a one-party
minority government for 17 months,
resigned after it became clear that
the largest Communist party in
Western Europe, supported by
Socialists and Republicans, would no
longer allow his government to con
tinue.
