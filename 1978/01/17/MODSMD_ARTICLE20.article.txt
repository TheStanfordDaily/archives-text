# Grant gives Lively Arts bigger reach
## 
### 
Miniconcerts, workshops, and other edu
cational prorams in the Midpeninsula are
currently being planned by The Lively Arts at
Stanford as a result of a grant it has received
from the San Francisco Foundation.
According to Vicky Holt, director of Stan
ford's Office of Public Events, the founda
tion awarded $12,238 to The Lively Arts so
that it may expand its performing arts prog
ram into the community.
"We are going to take the performing arts
to students from the elementary through
high school levels, to senior citizens and
other groups of people who don't have ac
cess to the arts through concert hall events,"
says Holt.
The grant provides for a half-time staff
person to coordinate the outreach program,
and Craig Leitner, an arts administration in
tern from St. Louis, has been hired for the
position.
He will work with a committee of rep
resentatives from Midpeninsula special in
terest groups. That committee is directed by

Queene Amirian, cultural events specialist
for the Senior Coordinating Council of Palo
Alto.
"Direct artist-audience interchange is not
possible in a formal concert situation. But if
we take an artist off stage into an informal
setting, people can appreciate him or her
personally as well as learn more about his
talent. It's a very stimulating experience for
both the artist and audience, and it prom
otes interest in the performing arts.
Some of the activities planned as part of
The Lively Arts outreach program are a
miniconcert with pianist Boris Bloch at Addi
son Elementary School; a miniconcert and
luncheon with him at the Jewish Community
Center; a master class with pianist Aldo Cic
colini sponsored in conjunction with Stan
ford's Music Cuild; a lecture demonstra
tion, master class, and workshop with De
nnis Wayne's Dancers; and a miniconcert
for senior citizens with harpist Nicanor
Zabaleta.
