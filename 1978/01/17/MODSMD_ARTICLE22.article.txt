Flutist Alexandra Hawley and pianist Kenneth Ziegenfuss perform Jan. 27 in Dinkelspiel. The duo will play
from a Baroque to Twentieth Century program, featuring works by J.S. Bach, Kuhlau, Messaien, Hin
demith and Pierne. In a Jan. 21 program, pianist Karen Rosenak compares and contrasts "the sonorities,
resources and literatures of the early and modern piano." On the department's antique Broadway
forte-piano, Rosenak will play Fantasia and Sonata in A Major (C.P.E. Bach); 32 Variations in C minor
(Beethoven); and Nocturne in A major and Midi (John Field). On the modern piano, Rosenak will play
Symphonic Etudes (Schumann) and Improvisations (Bartok).
