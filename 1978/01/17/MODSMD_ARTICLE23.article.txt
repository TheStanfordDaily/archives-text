# Taneyev String Quartet
## 
### 
Detente with the Soviet Union has given
America many things; in addition to de
pleted wheat reserves and defective
Rumar.an boxers, we have prospered
greatly from the cultural trading that has
gone on lately, with such great artists as
Lazar Berman and Daniel Shafran appear
ing in concert here. This exchange has af
fected the recording industry also, shown
by the number of Melodiya pressings that
have found their way into our domestic
catalogues. These records often feature
artists who are unknown in this country,
but are established in Europe and the
U.S.S.R.
The Taneyev String Quartet is one such
group, and its many merits are rep
resented by two recent recordings:
(Dmitri) "Shostakovich's Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Quartets" on Columbia/
Melodiya, and Franz Schubert's "Death
and the Maiden," (Quartet No. 14), on
Westminster/Melodiya.
The Taneyev
As the liner notes to the Schubert inform
us, the Taneyev was formed a few years
back, taking its name from composer and
teacher Sergei Taneyev, (1856-1915), who
was a student of Tchaikovsky. The notes
go on to tell us how great they are, both at
home and abroad, as an incentive to buy
this version, rather than one of the other
fine performances on record, of which
there are several.
Unfortunately, the quality of recording
and performance of the Taneyev's
Schubert doesn't quite match up to the
hype of the notes and Westminster's
pretty packaging job. The first difficulty
that the quartet encounters is that the in
dependence of the voices necessitates
that each performer possess both the
ability to play his line regardless of what
the others are playing ana the foresight to
make the listener aware that he is doing
so.
Flard to hear
It is hard to hear in this recording that
the Taneyev players recognize either of
these responsibilities; although the fast
tempos are kept up throughout the first
and fourth movements, the more difficult
passages have strange notes substituting
for the right ones, and it sounds as if such
substitutions were made on the spur of the
moment rather than fitting into a larger
scheme of artistic alteration.
The players also seem to lack confi
dence in all but the unison or slow sec
tions, which can severely get in the way of
a piece that depends so much on counter
point. It seems that none of the players,
except possibly cellist losif Levinzon, are

really equal to the challenge of such a dif
ficult piece.
The reason why I'm not sure how well
Levinzon plays is that the quality of the
original Russian recording is atrocious. It
sounds as if the performance is held inside
a metal garbage can, with the microphone
hung directly over the mouth. The violin
parts come out just fine, but the lower
'cello sounds stay down in the bottom of
the can; it sounds as if Levinzon were play
ing very well, but the poor quality of the
recording doesn't allow this to influence
my overall reaction to the performance. A
better record to get for Schubert's "Death
and the Maiden" is the Guarneri perfor
mance on RCA, although I prefer the now
out-of-print Juiliiard version, also on RCA.
Shostakovich's late music, that is, his
music from the mid-'6os to his death in
1975, is very difficult to bring off success
fully, mostly because of its gloomy and
introspective nature; when he learned
that he was afflicted by a heart disease that
would eventually prove fatal, Shos
takovich began to turn his music inward,
which led him to construct his pieces with
less emphasis on melodic interest, drama
tic contrast, alternation of fast and slow
movements, and the like. In place of these
facets he substituted bleakness and im
ages of decay, as if to say "I know what you
want to hear; but it's not what I want to tell
you." These late pieces, then, are master
pieces not for their musical content and
clear organization, but because they grant
the listener a moving insight into the de
cline and despair of a great man.
Illuminating
Realizing all of this, the Taneyev Quartet
has managed to construct fine perfor
mances that illuminate these bleak qual
ities. A good example of this is the first
movement of the Fourteenth Quartet;
what the Fitzwilliam Quartet on L'Oiseau-
Lyre interprets as light and dancelike the
Taneyev has correctly diagnosed as ironi
cally nostalgic, bordering on hysterical. Al
though this interpretation allows for no
real let-up of the unpleasant elements of
the quartet, it enables the listener to un
derstand that the entire work is cut from
the same piece of cloth. The Fifteenth
Quartet, Shostakovich's last in that
medium and the fourth to last of all his
works, is still more sparse and depressing,
and it fares well with this same approach
from the Taneyev.
Could it be, then, that the Shostakovich
is the more representative of the two re
cords, and that the Schubert was just re
corded on a bad day, for both performers
and engineers? The chronology would in

dicate that the group has matured, in that
the Schubert was recorded four years be
fore the Shostakovich, which has fine per
formances from all the musicians. It ap
pears that Russian recordings have im
proved also, and their high quality master
was transferred onto a very clean Colum
bia disc.
All of this would indicate that the next
Taneyev record could help us to decide
whether or not we like them; it would be a
pity if all we had to go on was best two out
of three . . .

Rodrigo, Concierto de Aranjuez; Fan
tasia para un gentiihombre, Angel
Romero, guitar; the London Sym
phony Orch., conducted by Andre
Previn. Angel S-37440.
This recording fascinated me upon first
listening for one reason: some brilliant re
cording engineer had discovered how to
transform Velveeta into something that
your ear could appreciate! The mic
rophones are placed so close to the musi
cians that there is no distance between
voices; the sounds are so highly proces
sed and mixed that a dull, stagnant two
dimentionality is created, and on a quad
raphonic system this is no mean feat. (I just
hope they never repeat it!)
Romero fantastic
The performance itself is not bad: Angel
Romero is a fantastic virtuoso, but I feel
that Previn is holding the tempos back,
more than Romero would have liked.
Romero's performance of the Concierto is
faster and more exciting with the San An
tonio Symphony, on Mercury Golden Im
port series; this version is aimed at the
guitar-music aficionado, whereas Previn's
is aimed at those who would only recog
nize the second movement of the Con
cierto as the music behind the Chrysler
Cordoba commercials.
Hovhaness, "The Rubaiyat of Omar
Khayyam," narrated by Douglas Fair
banks, Jr.; plus five other. Columbia
M-34537
Alan Hovhaness is capable of great
music. A Seattle composer who con
ducted the San Jose Symphony in a con
cert of his own works last year, he has
written pieces that conjur up images of
Persia and his ancestral home Armenia, and
such pieces as "Fra Angelico" and "Return
and Rebuild the Desolate Places" show a
gift for subtlety and tact. It is unfair, then,
to find his worst pieces and cram them
together on the same record. I suppose
this makes this record a novelty of a sort;
that's nice, but don't buy it.

this version, rather than one of the other
fine performances on record, of which
there are several.
Unfortunately, the quality of recording
and performance of the Taneyev's
Schubert doesn't quite match up to the
hype of the notes and Westminster's
pretty packaging job. The first difficulty
that the quartet encounters is that the in
dependence of the voices necessitates
that each performer possess both the
ability to play his line regardless of what
the others are playing ana the foresight to
make the listener aware that he is doing
so.
Flard to hear
It is hard to hear in this recording that
the Taneyev players recognize either of
these responsibilities; although the fast
tempos are kept up throughout the first
and fourth movements, the more difficult
passages have strange notes substituting
for the right ones, and it sounds as if such
substitutions were made on the spur of the
moment rather than fitting into a larger
scheme of artistic alteration.
The players also seem to lack confi
dence in all but the unison or slow sec
tions, which can severely get in the way of
a piece that depends so much on counter
point. It seems that none of the players,
except possibly cellist losif Levinzon, are

really equal to the challenge of such a dif
ficult piece.
The reason why I'm not sure how well
Levinzon plays is that the quality of the
original Russian recording is atrocious. It
sounds as if the performance is held inside
a metal garbage can, with the microphone
hung directly over the mouth. The violin
parts come out just fine, but the lower
'cello sounds stay down in the bottom of
the can; it sounds as if Levinzon were play
ing very well, but the poor quality of the
recording doesn't allow this to influence
my overall reaction to the performance. A
better record to get for Schubert's "Death
and the Maiden" is the Guarneri perfor
mance on RCA, although I prefer the now
out-of-print Juiliiard version, also on RCA.
Shostakovich's late music, that is, his
music from the mid-'6os to his death in
1975, is very difficult to bring off success
fully, mostly because of its gloomy and
introspective nature; when he learned
that he was afflicted by a heart disease that
would eventually prove fatal, Shos
takovich began to turn his music inward,
which led him to construct his pieces with
less emphasis on melodic interest, drama
tic contrast, alternation of fast and slow
movements, and the like. In place of these
facets he substituted bleakness and im
ages of decay, as if to say "I know what you
want to hear; but it's not what I want to tell
you." These late pieces, then, are master
pieces not for their musical content and
clear organization, but because they grant
the listener a moving insight into the de
cline and despair of a great man.
Illuminating
Realizing all of this, the Taneyev Quartet
has managed to construct fine perfor
mances that illuminate these bleak qual
ities. A good example of this is the first
movement of the Fourteenth Quartet;
what the Fitzwilliam Quartet on L'Oiseau-
Lyre interprets as light and dancelike the
Taneyev has correctly diagnosed as ironi
cally nostalgic, bordering on hysterical. Al
though this interpretation allows for no
real let-up of the unpleasant elements of
the quartet, it enables the listener to un
derstand that the entire work is cut from
the same piece of cloth. The Fifteenth
Quartet, Shostakovich's last in that
medium and the fourth to last of all his
works, is still more sparse and depressing,
and it fares well with this same approach
from the Taneyev.
Could it be, then, that the Shostakovich
is the more representative of the two re
cords, and that the Schubert was just re
corded on a bad day, for both performers
and engineers? The chronology would in

dicate that the group has matured, in that
the Schubert was recorded four years be
fore the Shostakovich, which has fine per
formances from all the musicians. It ap
pears that Russian recordings have im
proved also, and their high quality master
was transferred onto a very clean Colum
bia disc.
All of this would indicate that the next
Taneyev record could help us to decide
whether or not we like them; it would be a
pity if all we had to go on was best two out
of three . . .

Rodrigo, Concierto de Aranjuez; Fan
tasia para un gentiihombre, Angel
Romero, guitar; the London Sym
phony Orch., conducted by Andre
Previn. Angel S-37440.
This recording fascinated me upon first
listening for one reason: some brilliant re
cording engineer had discovered how to
transform Velveeta into something that
your ear could appreciate! The mic
rophones are placed so close to the musi
cians that there is no distance between
voices; the sounds are so highly proces
sed and mixed that a dull, stagnant two
dimentionality is created, and on a quad
raphonic system this is no mean feat. (I just
hope they never repeat it!)
Romero fantastic
The performance itself is not bad: Angel
Romero is a fantastic virtuoso, but I feel
that Previn is holding the tempos back,
more than Romero would have liked.
Romero's performance of the Concierto is
faster and more exciting with the San An
tonio Symphony, on Mercury Golden Im
port series; this version is aimed at the
guitar-music aficionado, whereas Previn's
is aimed at those who would only recog
nize the second movement of the Con
cierto as the music behind the Chrysler
Cordoba commercials.
Hovhaness, "The Rubaiyat of Omar
Khayyam," narrated by Douglas Fair
banks, Jr.; plus five other. Columbia
M-34537
Alan Hovhaness is capable of great
music. A Seattle composer who con
ducted the San Jose Symphony in a con
cert of his own works last year, he has
written pieces that conjur up images of
Persia and his ancestral home Armenia, and
such pieces as "Fra Angelico" and "Return
and Rebuild the Desolate Places" show a
gift for subtlety and tact. It is unfair, then,
to find his worst pieces and cram them
together on the same record. I suppose
this makes this record a novelty of a sort;
that's nice, but don't buy it.

The reason why I'm not sure how well
Levinzon plays is that the quality of the
original Russian recording is atrocious. It
sounds as if the performance is held inside
a metal garbage can, with the microphone
hung directly over the mouth. The violin
parts come out just fine, but the lower
'cello sounds stay down in the bottom of
the can; it sounds as if Levinzon were play
ing very well, but the poor quality of the
recording doesn't allow this to influence
my overall reaction to the performance. A
better record to get for Schubert's "Death
and the Maiden" is the Guarneri perfor
mance on RCA, although I prefer the now
out-of-print Juiliiard version, also on RCA.
Shostakovich's late music, that is, his
music from the mid-'6os to his death in
1975, is very difficult to bring off success
fully, mostly because of its gloomy and
introspective nature; when he learned
that he was afflicted by a heart disease that
would eventually prove fatal, Shos
takovich began to turn his music inward,
which led him to construct his pieces with
less emphasis on melodic interest, drama
tic contrast, alternation of fast and slow
movements, and the like. In place of these
facets he substituted bleakness and im
ages of decay, as if to say "I know what you
want to hear; but it's not what I want to tell
you." These late pieces, then, are master
pieces not for their musical content and
clear organization, but because they grant
the listener a moving insight into the de
cline and despair of a great man.
Illuminating
Realizing all of this, the Taneyev Quartet
has managed to construct fine perfor
mances that illuminate these bleak qual
ities. A good example of this is the first
movement of the Fourteenth Quartet;
what the Fitzwilliam Quartet on L'Oiseau-
Lyre interprets as light and dancelike the
Taneyev has correctly diagnosed as ironi
cally nostalgic, bordering on hysterical. Al
though this interpretation allows for no
real let-up of the unpleasant elements of
the quartet, it enables the listener to un
derstand that the entire work is cut from
the same piece of cloth. The Fifteenth
Quartet, Shostakovich's last in that
medium and the fourth to last of all his
works, is still more sparse and depressing,
and it fares well with this same approach
from the Taneyev.
Could it be, then, that the Shostakovich
is the more representative of the two re
cords, and that the Schubert was just re
corded on a bad day, for both performers
and engineers? The chronology would in

dicate that the group has matured, in that
the Schubert was recorded four years be
fore the Shostakovich, which has fine per
formances from all the musicians. It ap
pears that Russian recordings have im
proved also, and their high quality master
was transferred onto a very clean Colum
bia disc.
All of this would indicate that the next
Taneyev record could help us to decide
whether or not we like them; it would be a
pity if all we had to go on was best two out
of three . . .

Rodrigo, Concierto de Aranjuez; Fan
tasia para un gentiihombre, Angel
Romero, guitar; the London Sym
phony Orch., conducted by Andre
Previn. Angel S-37440.
This recording fascinated me upon first
listening for one reason: some brilliant re
cording engineer had discovered how to
transform Velveeta into something that
your ear could appreciate! The mic
rophones are placed so close to the musi
cians that there is no distance between
voices; the sounds are so highly proces
sed and mixed that a dull, stagnant two
dimentionality is created, and on a quad
raphonic system this is no mean feat. (I just
hope they never repeat it!)
Romero fantastic
The performance itself is not bad: Angel
Romero is a fantastic virtuoso, but I feel
that Previn is holding the tempos back,
more than Romero would have liked.
Romero's performance of the Concierto is
faster and more exciting with the San An
tonio Symphony, on Mercury Golden Im
port series; this version is aimed at the
guitar-music aficionado, whereas Previn's
is aimed at those who would only recog
nize the second movement of the Con
cierto as the music behind the Chrysler
Cordoba commercials.
Hovhaness, "The Rubaiyat of Omar
Khayyam," narrated by Douglas Fair
banks, Jr.; plus five other. Columbia
M-34537
Alan Hovhaness is capable of great
music. A Seattle composer who con
ducted the San Jose Symphony in a con
cert of his own works last year, he has
written pieces that conjur up images of
Persia and his ancestral home Armenia, and
such pieces as "Fra Angelico" and "Return
and Rebuild the Desolate Places" show a
gift for subtlety and tact. It is unfair, then,
to find his worst pieces and cram them
together on the same record. I suppose
this makes this record a novelty of a sort;
that's nice, but don't buy it.

Detente with the Soviet Union has given
America many things; in addition to de
pleted wheat reserves and defective
Rumar.an boxers, we have prospered
greatly from the cultural trading that has
gone on lately, with such great artists as
Lazar Berman and Daniel Shafran appear
ing in concert here. This exchange has af
fected the recording industry also, shown
by the number of Melodiya pressings that
have found their way into our domestic
catalogues. These records often feature
artists who are unknown in this country,
but are established in Europe and the
U.S.S.R.
The Taneyev String Quartet is one such
group, and its many merits are rep
resented by two recent recordings:
(Dmitri) "Shostakovich's Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Quartets" on Columbia/
Melodiya, and Franz Schubert's "Death
and the Maiden," (Quartet No. 14), on
Westminster/Melodiya.
The Taneyev
As the liner notes to the Schubert inform
us, the Taneyev was formed a few years
back, taking its name from composer and
teacher Sergei Taneyev, (1856-1915), who
was a student of Tchaikovsky. The notes
go on to tell us how great they are, both at
home and abroad, as an incentive to buy
this version, rather than one of the other
fine performances on record, of which
there are several.
Unfortunately, the quality of recording
and performance of the Taneyev's
Schubert doesn't quite match up to the
hype of the notes and Westminster's
pretty packaging job. The first difficulty
that the quartet encounters is that the in
dependence of the voices necessitates
that each performer possess both the
ability to play his line regardless of what
the others are playing ana the foresight to
make the listener aware that he is doing
so.
Flard to hear
It is hard to hear in this recording that
the Taneyev players recognize either of
these responsibilities; although the fast
tempos are kept up throughout the first
and fourth movements, the more difficult
passages have strange notes substituting
for the right ones, and it sounds as if such
substitutions were made on the spur of the
moment rather than fitting into a larger
scheme of artistic alteration.
The players also seem to lack confi
dence in all but the unison or slow sec
tions, which can severely get in the way of
a piece that depends so much on counter
point. It seems that none of the players,
except possibly cellist losif Levinzon, are

really equal to the challenge of such a dif
ficult piece.

ages of decay, as if to say "I know what you
want to hear; but it's not what I want to tell
you." These late pieces, then, are master
pieces not for their musical content and
clear organization, but because they grant
the listener a moving insight into the de
cline and despair of a great man.
Illuminating
Realizing all of this, the Taneyev Quartet
has managed to construct fine perfor
mances that illuminate these bleak qual
ities. A good example of this is the first
movement of the Fourteenth Quartet;
what the Fitzwilliam Quartet on L'Oiseau-
Lyre interprets as light and dancelike the
Taneyev has correctly diagnosed as ironi
cally nostalgic, bordering on hysterical. Al
though this interpretation allows for no
real let-up of the unpleasant elements of
the quartet, it enables the listener to un
derstand that the entire work is cut from
the same piece of cloth. The Fifteenth
Quartet, Shostakovich's last in that
medium and the fourth to last of all his
works, is still more sparse and depressing,
and it fares well with this same approach
from the Taneyev.
Could it be, then, that the Shostakovich
is the more representative of the two re
cords, and that the Schubert was just re
corded on a bad day, for both performers
and engineers? The chronology would in

dicate that the group has matured, in that
the Schubert was recorded four years be
fore the Shostakovich, which has fine per
formances from all the musicians. It ap
pears that Russian recordings have im
proved also, and their high quality master
was transferred onto a very clean Colum
bia disc.
All of this would indicate that the next
Taneyev record could help us to decide
whether or not we like them; it would be a
pity if all we had to go on was best two out
of three . . .

Rodrigo, Concierto de Aranjuez; Fan
tasia para un gentiihombre, Angel
Romero, guitar; the London Sym
phony Orch., conducted by Andre
Previn. Angel S-37440.
This recording fascinated me upon first
listening for one reason: some brilliant re
cording engineer had discovered how to
transform Velveeta into something that
your ear could appreciate! The mic
rophones are placed so close to the musi
cians that there is no distance between
voices; the sounds are so highly proces
sed and mixed that a dull, stagnant two
dimentionality is created, and on a quad
raphonic system this is no mean feat. (I just
hope they never repeat it!)
Romero fantastic
The performance itself is not bad: Angel
Romero is a fantastic virtuoso, but I feel
that Previn is holding the tempos back,
more than Romero would have liked.
Romero's performance of the Concierto is
faster and more exciting with the San An
tonio Symphony, on Mercury Golden Im
port series; this version is aimed at the
guitar-music aficionado, whereas Previn's
is aimed at those who would only recog
nize the second movement of the Con
cierto as the music behind the Chrysler
Cordoba commercials.
Hovhaness, "The Rubaiyat of Omar
Khayyam," narrated by Douglas Fair
banks, Jr.; plus five other. Columbia
M-34537
Alan Hovhaness is capable of great
music. A Seattle composer who con
ducted the San Jose Symphony in a con
cert of his own works last year, he has
written pieces that conjur up images of
Persia and his ancestral home Armenia, and
such pieces as "Fra Angelico" and "Return
and Rebuild the Desolate Places" show a
gift for subtlety and tact. It is unfair, then,
to find his worst pieces and cram them
together on the same record. I suppose
this makes this record a novelty of a sort;
that's nice, but don't buy it.
