# 'The Goodbye Girl': hello, Dreyfuss
## 
### 
"The Goodbye Girl," directed by Her
bert Ross from a Neil Simon screenplay, is
a piece of romantic fluff that charms with
its general mood of optimism and Richard
Dreyfuss' energetic performance. The film
is not all that it could have been; but as it
is, you should have a good time.
The Simon script is yet another version
of his "odd couple in New York" comic
situation. He has often parlayed this
storyline into success ("The Odd Couple,"
"Barefoot in the Park"). Simon is success
ful, but he is not an artist; he's a mechanic.
But he has a quality that some artists don't
have (it's not of key importance) — the
ability to know what will be popular. He's
never going to satisfy intellectually, but in
his familiar way, he can make you laugh.
New York, New York
Simon's last few efforts in the New York
format, however, have been tired, cynical,
and heavy-handed (specifically, "The Pris
oner of Second Avenue"). It is probably
easy to get that way if you live in and write
about New York long enough, as Simon
has. He now lives in Los Angeles, and the
move has seemingly reawakened his op
timism, a necessary and welcome compo
nent of "The Goodbye Girl."
One half of Simon's new odd couple is
Marsha Mason (Simon's wife), who plays a
mid-30s, slightly over-the-hill dancer with
a young but mature daughter. Mason has

just been deserted by her lover, an all too
common occurrence (thus the title,
"Goodbye Girl").
To add insult to injury, she finds that the
apartment she shared with her lovpr has
been rented by him to an actor-friend of
his, Richard Dreyfuss.
Moving in
Dreyfuss tries to move in. After realizing
that neither of them has any place else to
go, they decide to share the apartment in a
"separate but equal" relationship.
So, Simon sets up his man and woman
odd couple, and he does his job, writing
funny lines and situations. He creates
funny characters, not real people, and this
obviously limits his comedies.
In "Goodbye Girl," Dreyfuss and new
comer Quinn Cummings (who plays Ma
son's mature and tough talking daughter)
manage to overcome this deficiency with
their attention to timing and personality.
Marsha Mason is a likable and talented
actress, but you don't respond to her per
formance like you do Dreyfuss' and Cum
mings'; perhaps she's too low-key for this
film. When you listen to her, you too often
hear Simon's words; when Dreyfuss is
speaking, you concentrate on him and not
Simon's lines — a better fate for an audi
ence.
Richard Dreyfuss makes this film work.
His performance transcends Simon's writ
ing; you respond to it and enjoy it, in

much the same way you respond to
Richard Pryor's work in "Silver Streak" —
to its sheer physical energy.
The film's funniest gag has nothing to do
with Simon or director Ross; it's all
Dreyfuss. Dreyfuss has come to New York
to play Richard 111 in an off-Broadway pro
duction. His avant-garde director believes
that "deep down" Richard 111 is a
homosexual.
On opening night, out steps the gay
Richard. The scene is a good piece of phys
ical comedy; of the actor making a fool of
himself.
Ross 'out of way'
Director Herb Ross thankfully keeps out
of the way in this film, an asset he should
have exercised in his other film this year,
the much ballyhooed (and very disap
pointing, except for the dancing) "The
Turning Point." In that film we knew — all
too well — that Ross was directing it.
When Ross lets the actors do the work, he
is successful; "The Seven-Percent Solu
tion," arguably his best film, has marvel
ous character performances.
Ross has let Dreyfuss go in "Goodbye
Girl"; it is one of his best performances.
Dreyfuss is not (yet?) a great actor, but he
can carry a movie, and he does so here.
"The Goodbye Girl" is a relatively small
film, but Dreyfuss makes it an interesting
and rather enjoyable slight entertainment.
