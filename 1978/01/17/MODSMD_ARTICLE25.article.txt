# Concertmaster Stamos, 'at home with the violin'
## 
### 
Professional violinist Spiro Stamos per
formed last Sunday in Tresidder Union.
Stamos is a former concert master of both
the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera and the
New York Goldovski Opera Orchestra. He
also describes himself as "very much a fam
ily man."
For most professional musicians the lack
of a home life is a necessary sacrifice for
"success." Early in his career, Stamos
toured extensively, spending as much as
four months away from home. "I disliked
touring," he said. "I'd come home, and my
child wouldn't recognize me. I woke up
one day and realized that if I had to go
through the intense competition found in
touring, something would happen to me,
and subsequently to my wife and children.
It was a choice I had to make."
Stamos chose to stay in the Los Angeles
area and become a commercial musician.
He is currently the concertmaster and
studio musician at several recording
studios, including MCM, Capitol, NBC,
and Walt Disney. "I have an opportunity to
be both a musician and a father this way,"
he said.

Stamos has three sons. The oldest, Peter,
is a sophomore at Stanford, who called his
home life "pretty normal, except we're
used to hearing music being practiced all
of the time."
"Being a commercial musician can be
musically stifling," Stamos said, "but it's a
good life." He still gives frequent perfor
mances in the Los Angeles area, to main
tain what he termed his "musical sanity."
"Music is a great force in our lives," he
said. "In every recital, I hope to be able to
touch a few people in the audience, affect
one or two, and leave them with some
thing. This could happen in just a few bars,
or not at all. It's not something that hap
pens every day. To affect someone that
way, I guess that's my idea of immortality."
Stamos called his wife his "greatest critic
and ally." He said, "for me, she was the
understanding I needed, she gave me the
strength to survive in this business. The
ones that don't need anyone, the ones who
concentrate on themselves alone, are the
ones who survive on tour. That's their
choice. I have no regrets."
