# 'Trojan Women'
## Fuzzy Greek primer 
### 
Although there are classi
cal aspects to Hillbarn
Theatre's production of
Euripedes' "The Trojan Wo
men," they really can't be
considered more than a col
lection of currently-held be
liefs, (however vague or in
error), about the characteris
tics which composed the an
cient Greek theater. The best
part of the play is the
singing-dancing of the
chorus of the Trojan Wo
men, which cleverly updates
the ancient use of the Greek
chorus and gives the repeti
tive dialogue more rhythm
than it deserves.
The addition of archaic
sounding music on modern
instruments only alienates
the audience, revealing the
purpose of directors Peg
Duggar and Jim Haran: to
bring to the subconscious
the acknowledgment of the
futility of war and its annihi
lation of victor and van
quished alike.
This realization is sup
ported by:
1) the story of the total de
struction of Troy because of

the unfaithfulness of Helen,
couched in the visualization
of the aftermath of despair of
the surviving females;
2) the general expression
less, almost mask-like faces
of these women as they
realize their new situations,
as spoils of war;
3) the dreary lighting ef
fects, through which the ac
tors are forced to play in
twilight, (especially, the first
scene where gods Poseidon
and Athena give the
background of the play in
almost total darkness).
The diction of every per
former is consistently clear
and loud, even to the inclu
sion of the xongue-twisting,
almost endless names. Both
the herald (Edgar Weinstock)
and Menelaus (Derek
Charnley) perform in a de
clamatory style, which is
closer to the stoic Roman
soldiers than the warriors of
Argos that they are. Notable
portrayals include Susan
Tailer's mad Cassandra, the
overbearingly-maternal An
dromache of Patricia McMa
hon, (who, horrified at the

thought of her child's execu
tion, almost suffocates this
same son in the folds of her
robe while she cries for
mercy), and the excellent
down-to-the-last-detail im
personation of Helen by
Marcia Brinkley, (who easily
convinces the audience of
the true vileness of her per
sonality through a speech as
clearly false as Marc An
tony's speech to the people
in Julius Caesar; she is a
female out just for her own
ends).
This production, which
will continue on Fridays and
Saturdays through Feb. 4,
can be symbolized by the
almost conflicting efforts of
the designer, Sam Rolph. Al
though he made each cos
tume singularly individual in
color, he did not prevent the
lighting from destroying any
effect of the robes.
This production's problem
is that its social implications
have overcome its classi
cism; which makes it mean
ingful but not much more
than a primer for Greek
drama. â€” GARY ESTEE
