Park's testimony 'valuable'
Seoul, South Korea — Tongsun Park's chief
American interrogator said yesterday the one
time Washington lobbyist is providing "very
valuable" information about the Capitol Hill
payoff scandal and probably will be ques
tioned for a total of 70 hours more.
Acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General Ben
jamin Civiletti also told reporters he would fly
back to Washington today, leaving the Park
questioning to the remaining five members of
his justice Department team.
Fie said policy matters had been worked out
so that his subordinates could continue the
questioning routinely. South Korean inves
tigators are also participating. The sessions will
last about a week more, Civiletti said.
Civiletti refused to give details of the inter
rogation, but Rep. Bruce Caputo (R-N.Y.), who
sat in on the first two days of questioning as an
observer for the Flouse Ethics Committee, has
reported Park testified he gave "hundreds of
thousands of dollars" to congressmen and
U.S. executive branch officials.
Caputo said the testimony covered "dozens
of dozens" of people.
Vance active in peace talks
Jerusalem — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
flew here yesterday determined to play an ac
tive role in the new round of Egyptian-Israeli
peace talks, but U.S. officials cautioned that
"instant agreements" are not in the offing.
Vance expects long and difficult negotia
tions and even occasional breakdowns, a
senior U.S. official told reporters on Vance's
arrival for the formal resumption of talks Tues
day.
Another summit meeting between Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minis
ter Menahem Begin may be needed to keep up
the momentum, the official said. "You're not
going to find instant agreements."

The negotiations that begin today in a
Jerusalem hotel suite will focus from the start
on the Palestinian issue.
Vance is expected to offer proposals for an
interim arrangement for the 1.1 million Pales
tinians living in Israeli-occupied territory. It
would stop short of independence but would
give them more autonomy than the "self-rule"
proposed last month by Begin.
Floods, slides plague state
Torrential rains, flooding and rock slides
snarled roads throughout California yesterday
as drought-breaking storms hit the West
Coast. Meanwhile, the East Coast girded for a
snow storm pushing out of the Rockies and
headed across the Great Plains.
Much of the nation coped with bad weather.
A frost hit parts of Florida; snow fell over the
Dakotas; heavy winds blew across West Texas;
and thousands of New York suburbanites
awaited the restoration of electrical power.
Power outages were reported on both coasts
as downed trees knocked out lines in Califor
nia and a weekend ice storm in New York left
more than 100,000 homes and businesses on
Long Island without power.
Winds that reached to 40 mph brought gale
warnings to the San Francisco Bay area where
more than 3 inches of rain had fallen since
Saturday. And another storm was building up
over the Pacific.
The storm turned to snow in the mountains.
Inmate execution requested
Sacramento — Attorney General Evelle
Younger will ask the state Supreme Court to
allow execution of up to inmates who were
on Death Row when the court overturned
California's old death penalty law, his office
said yesterday.
There were 68 prisoners condemned to
death when the court declared the law uncon
stitutional in December 1976. So far, only 15
have gotten a formal reduction to life impris

onment, said state prisons spokesman Philip
Guthrie.
The Legislature enacted a new death penalty
law last Aug. 11 over Gov. )erry Brown's veto.
Younger, a contender for the Republican
nomination for governor, wants to apply that
law retroactively to prisoners whose sentences
have not yet been commuted.
So far, California courts have not gone
along. But Younger aides say they will try toget
the state Supreme Court to decide the issue.
They noted that the U.S. Supreme Court al
lowed Florida to sentence a man to death
under a similar retroactive application.
Court approves pay hikes
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday
upheld the way members of Congress have
been giving themselves pay raises and threw
out an attempt to sink the Panama Canal
treaties.
The court rejected a challenge by Rep. Larry
Pressler (R-S.D.) to the methods used by Con
gress since 1969 to boost the salaries of its
members. The lawmakers were earning
$42,500 a year in 1969. They now earn $57,500
annually.
Had Pressler been successful, all members
of Congress would have seen salaries shrink to
their 1969 level — a $15,000 pay cut.
The justices issued no accompanying com
ment when they threw out an appeal by five
members of Congress and four states challeng
ing the constitutionality of the Panama Canal
treaties signed last September by President
Jimmy Carter.
One treaty would relinquish U.S. control
over the international waterway to Panama in
the year 2000. The second would guarantee the
continued neutrality of the canal zone.
The appeal contended the Constitution re
quires action by both houses of Congress be
fore the government may dispose of U.S.
property.

Mondale to Canada, Mexico
Washington — Vice President Walter Mon
dale, embarking on his third diplomatic mis
sion for President Jimmy Carter, visits Canada
and Mexico this week, with energy a focal
point of his trip.
Such key issues in his host countries as the
Quebec separatist movement and illegal aliens
will be discussed only briefly, if at all.
The vice president, who spent five days last
week in western states and traveled to Min
nesota for Sen. Hubert Humphrey's funeral
yesterday, flies to Ottawa today for meetings
with Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott
Trudeau and other Canadian leaders.
Tomorrow he flies to Edmonton, Alberta,
and then back to Washington in time for Car
ter's State of the Union address the following
day.
While in Canada, Mondale will discuss addi
tional gas sales involving the two nations, oil
storage sites, transportation of oil and gas from
Alaska and the Canadian north across Canada
and into the United States, and exchange of
electricity along the border, they said.
Today's weather
Showers decreasing this morning. Partly
cloudy this afternoon and tonight. Increasing
clouds tomorrow with rain likely late in the

Park's testimony 'valuable'
Seoul, South Korea — Tongsun Park's chief
American interrogator said yesterday the one
time Washington lobbyist is providing "very
valuable" information about the Capitol Hill
payoff scandal and probably will be ques
tioned for a total of 70 hours more.
Acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General Ben
jamin Civiletti also told reporters he would fly
back to Washington today, leaving the Park
questioning to the remaining five members of
his justice Department team.
Fie said policy matters had been worked out
so that his subordinates could continue the
questioning routinely. South Korean inves
tigators are also participating. The sessions will
last about a week more, Civiletti said.
Civiletti refused to give details of the inter
rogation, but Rep. Bruce Caputo (R-N.Y.), who
sat in on the first two days of questioning as an
observer for the Flouse Ethics Committee, has
reported Park testified he gave "hundreds of
thousands of dollars" to congressmen and
U.S. executive branch officials.
Caputo said the testimony covered "dozens
of dozens" of people.
Vance active in peace talks
Jerusalem — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
flew here yesterday determined to play an ac
tive role in the new round of Egyptian-Israeli
peace talks, but U.S. officials cautioned that
"instant agreements" are not in the offing.
Vance expects long and difficult negotia
tions and even occasional breakdowns, a
senior U.S. official told reporters on Vance's
arrival for the formal resumption of talks Tues
day.
Another summit meeting between Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minis
ter Menahem Begin may be needed to keep up
the momentum, the official said. "You're not
going to find instant agreements."

The negotiations that begin today in a
Jerusalem hotel suite will focus from the start
on the Palestinian issue.
Vance is expected to offer proposals for an
interim arrangement for the 1.1 million Pales
tinians living in Israeli-occupied territory. It
would stop short of independence but would
give them more autonomy than the "self-rule"
proposed last month by Begin.
Floods, slides plague state
Torrential rains, flooding and rock slides
snarled roads throughout California yesterday
as drought-breaking storms hit the West
Coast. Meanwhile, the East Coast girded for a
snow storm pushing out of the Rockies and
headed across the Great Plains.
Much of the nation coped with bad weather.
A frost hit parts of Florida; snow fell over the
Dakotas; heavy winds blew across West Texas;
and thousands of New York suburbanites
awaited the restoration of electrical power.
Power outages were reported on both coasts
as downed trees knocked out lines in Califor
nia and a weekend ice storm in New York left
more than 100,000 homes and businesses on
Long Island without power.
Winds that reached to 40 mph brought gale
warnings to the San Francisco Bay area where
more than 3 inches of rain had fallen since
Saturday. And another storm was building up
over the Pacific.
The storm turned to snow in the mountains.
Inmate execution requested
Sacramento — Attorney General Evelle
Younger will ask the state Supreme Court to
allow execution of up to inmates who were
on Death Row when the court overturned
California's old death penalty law, his office
said yesterday.
There were 68 prisoners condemned to
death when the court declared the law uncon
stitutional in December 1976. So far, only 15
have gotten a formal reduction to life impris

onment, said state prisons spokesman Philip
Guthrie.
The Legislature enacted a new death penalty
law last Aug. 11 over Gov. )erry Brown's veto.
Younger, a contender for the Republican
nomination for governor, wants to apply that
law retroactively to prisoners whose sentences
have not yet been commuted.
So far, California courts have not gone
along. But Younger aides say they will try toget
the state Supreme Court to decide the issue.
They noted that the U.S. Supreme Court al
lowed Florida to sentence a man to death
under a similar retroactive application.
Court approves pay hikes
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday
upheld the way members of Congress have
been giving themselves pay raises and threw
out an attempt to sink the Panama Canal
treaties.
The court rejected a challenge by Rep. Larry
Pressler (R-S.D.) to the methods used by Con
gress since 1969 to boost the salaries of its
members. The lawmakers were earning
$42,500 a year in 1969. They now earn $57,500
annually.
Had Pressler been successful, all members
of Congress would have seen salaries shrink to
their 1969 level — a $15,000 pay cut.
The justices issued no accompanying com
ment when they threw out an appeal by five
members of Congress and four states challeng
ing the constitutionality of the Panama Canal
treaties signed last September by President
Jimmy Carter.
One treaty would relinquish U.S. control
over the international waterway to Panama in
the year 2000. The second would guarantee the
continued neutrality of the canal zone.
The appeal contended the Constitution re
quires action by both houses of Congress be
fore the government may dispose of U.S.
property.

Mondale to Canada, Mexico
Washington — Vice President Walter Mon

Such key issues in his host countries as the
Quebec separatist movement and illegal aliens
will be discussed only briefly, if at all.
The vice president, who spent five days last
week in western states and traveled to Min
nesota for Sen. Hubert Humphrey's funeral
yesterday, flies to Ottawa today for meetings
with Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott
Trudeau and other Canadian leaders.
Tomorrow he flies to Edmonton, Alberta,
and then back to Washington in time for Car

day.
While in Canada, Mondale will discuss addi

storage sites, transportation of oil and gas from
Alaska and the Canadian north across Canada
and into the United States, and exchange of
electricity along the border, they said.

Park's testimony 'valuable'
Seoul, South Korea — Tongsun Park's chief
American interrogator said yesterday the one
time Washington lobbyist is providing "very
valuable" information about the Capitol Hill
payoff scandal and probably will be ques
tioned for a total of 70 hours more.
Acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General Ben
jamin Civiletti also told reporters he would fly
back to Washington today, leaving the Park
questioning to the remaining five members of
his justice Department team.
Fie said policy matters had been worked out
so that his subordinates could continue the
questioning routinely. South Korean inves
tigators are also participating. The sessions will
last about a week more, Civiletti said.
Civiletti refused to give details of the inter
rogation, but Rep. Bruce Caputo (R-N.Y.), who
sat in on the first two days of questioning as an
observer for the Flouse Ethics Committee, has
reported Park testified he gave "hundreds of
thousands of dollars" to congressmen and
U.S. executive branch officials.
Caputo said the testimony covered "dozens
of dozens" of people.
Vance active in peace talks
Jerusalem — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
flew here yesterday determined to play an ac
tive role in the new round of Egyptian-Israeli
peace talks, but U.S. officials cautioned that
"instant agreements" are not in the offing.
Vance expects long and difficult negotia
tions and even occasional breakdowns, a
senior U.S. official told reporters on Vance's
arrival for the formal resumption of talks Tues
day.
Another summit meeting between Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minis
ter Menahem Begin may be needed to keep up
the momentum, the official said. "You're not
going to find instant agreements."

The negotiations that begin today in a
Jerusalem hotel suite will focus from the start
on the Palestinian issue.
Vance is expected to offer proposals for an
interim arrangement for the 1.1 million Pales
tinians living in Israeli-occupied territory. It
would stop short of independence but would
give them more autonomy than the "self-rule"
proposed last month by Begin.
Floods, slides plague state
Torrential rains, flooding and rock slides
snarled roads throughout California yesterday
as drought-breaking storms hit the West
Coast. Meanwhile, the East Coast girded for a
snow storm pushing out of the Rockies and
headed across the Great Plains.
Much of the nation coped with bad weather.
A frost hit parts of Florida; snow fell over the
Dakotas; heavy winds blew across West Texas;
and thousands of New York suburbanites
awaited the restoration of electrical power.
Power outages were reported on both coasts
as downed trees knocked out lines in Califor
nia and a weekend ice storm in New York left
more than 100,000 homes and businesses on
Long Island without power.
Winds that reached to 40 mph brought gale
warnings to the San Francisco Bay area where
more than 3 inches of rain had fallen since
Saturday. And another storm was building up
over the Pacific.
The storm turned to snow in the mountains.
Inmate execution requested
Sacramento — Attorney General Evelle
Younger will ask the state Supreme Court to
allow execution of up to inmates who were
on Death Row when the court overturned
California's old death penalty law, his office
said yesterday.
There were 68 prisoners condemned to
death when the court declared the law uncon
stitutional in December 1976. So far, only 15
have gotten a formal reduction to life impris

onment, said state prisons spokesman Philip
Guthrie.
The Legislature enacted a new death penalty
law last Aug. 11 over Gov. )erry Brown's veto.
Younger, a contender for the Republican
nomination for governor, wants to apply that
law retroactively to prisoners whose sentences
have not yet been commuted.
So far, California courts have not gone
along. But Younger aides say they will try toget
the state Supreme Court to decide the issue.
They noted that the U.S. Supreme Court al
lowed Florida to sentence a man to death
under a similar retroactive application.
Court approves pay hikes
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday
upheld the way members of Congress have
been giving themselves pay raises and threw
out an attempt to sink the Panama Canal
treaties.
The court rejected a challenge by Rep. Larry
Pressler (R-S.D.) to the methods used by Con
gress since 1969 to boost the salaries of its
members. The lawmakers were earning
$42,500 a year in 1969. They now earn $57,500
annually.
Had Pressler been successful, all members
of Congress would have seen salaries shrink to
their 1969 level — a $15,000 pay cut.
The justices issued no accompanying com
ment when they threw out an appeal by five
members of Congress and four states challeng
ing the constitutionality of the Panama Canal
treaties signed last September by President
Jimmy Carter.
One treaty would relinquish U.S. control
over the international waterway to Panama in
the year 2000. The second would guarantee the
continued neutrality of the canal zone.
The appeal contended the Constitution re
quires action by both houses of Congress be
fore the government may dispose of U.S.
property.

Mondale to Canada, Mexico
Washington — Vice President Walter Mon
dale, embarking on his third diplomatic mis
sion for President Jimmy Carter, visits Canada
and Mexico this week, with energy a focal
point of his trip.
Such key issues in his host countries as the
Quebec separatist movement and illegal aliens
will be discussed only briefly, if at all.
The vice president, who spent five days last
week in western states and traveled to Min
nesota for Sen. Hubert Humphrey's funeral
yesterday, flies to Ottawa today for meetings
with Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott
Trudeau and other Canadian leaders.
Tomorrow he flies to Edmonton, Alberta,
and then back to Washington in time for Car
ter's State of the Union address the following
day.
