# Bookstore losing money on its textbook sales
## 
### Cheryl Eschbach 
The Bookstore is losing money in
textbook sales, according to
textbook manager )im Arnold.
As a nonprofit corporation, the
Bookstore charges the list price for
textbooks. But operating costs have
been spiraling along with inflation,
exceeding the average textbook dis
count rate offered by publishing
firms.
In other words, if your $10
textbook cost the Bookstore $8 at

discount, the store may have incur
red more than $2 in operating ex
penses just getting it to you.
In addition, the Bookstore faces a
"discount dilemma" where the 20
percent rates remain rigid due to the
lack of discount competition in the
publishing industry. Arnold offered
two explanations for this.
First, professors select the stock of
books and supplying companies,
without knowledge of relative
prices. Second, consolidation in the
publishing industry is hurting com
petition, Arnold said.
Pretty soon we'll need antitrust in
the publishing industry," he added.
Publishers, however, do not agree
that their industry is the profiteering
better half. According to Harcourt
Brace's West Coast textbook man
ager, Bill Barnett, textbook price in
creases have been trailing "far be
hind" the rate of inflation.

He called the industry "one of our
economy's most competitive," being
composed of about 50 firms.
An editor from Wadsworth pub
lishing company, Rebecca Haydn,
said textbook prices are now lower
than they were during the depres
sion in relation to the minimum
wage, while the books produced
have become "much more lavish" in
quality.
Publishing company Scott Fores
man s textbook representative Earl
Karn explained the industry's "fixed"
20 percent discount rate as a market
imperfection due to professors, and
not the profit-maximizing business
world, who are choosing the books
to be ordered.
The financial woes on both sides of
the fence are partly due to declining
aggregate demand. "The baby-boom
heyday of the 1960s is over," Arnold
said.
This has forced the bookstores of
some Bay Area state schools to begin
charging more than the list price for
textbooks. Arnold said he did not
welcome this prospect as a solution
for the Bookstore's problems, be
cause it would mean deviation from
the Bookstore's nonprofit status and
traditional practice of charging only
list prices.
However, because it is an entity
separate from the University, the
Bookstore has no "cushion to fall
back upon," Arnold said.
Manager Eldon Speed said that
losses due to textbook sales have
been sustained through the
Bookstore's non-academic sales, in
clothing, stationery and gifts.
The construction now underway
will not significantly affect overall
operating costs, Speed said, because
it should generate enough additional
sales to offset the extra expenses.

20 percent discount rate as a market
imperfection due to professors, and
not the profit-maximizing business
world, who are choosing the books
to be ordered.
The financial woes on both sides of
the fence are partly due to declining
aggregate demand. "The baby-boom
heyday of the 1960s is over," Arnold
said.
This has forced the bookstores of
some Bay Area state schools to begin
charging more than the list price for
textbooks. Arnold said he did not
welcome this prospect as a solution
for the Bookstore's problems, be
cause it would mean deviation from
the Bookstore's nonprofit status and
traditional practice of charging only
list prices.
However, because it is an entity
separate from the University, the
Bookstore has no "cushion to fall
back upon," Arnold said.
Manager Eldon Speed said that
losses due to textbook sales have
been sustained through the
Bookstore's non-academic sales, in
clothing, stationery and gifts.
The construction now underway
will not significantly affect overall
operating costs, Speed said, because
it should generate enough additional
sales to offset the extra expenses.
The Bookstore is losing money in
textbook sales, according to
textbook manager )im Arnold.
As a nonprofit corporation, the
Bookstore charges the list price for
textbooks. But operating costs have
been spiraling along with inflation,
exceeding the average textbook dis
count rate offered by publishing
firms.
In other words, if your $10
textbook cost the Bookstore $8 at

discount, the store may have incur
red more than $2 in operating ex
penses just getting it to you.
In addition, the Bookstore faces a
"discount dilemma" where the 20
percent rates remain rigid due to the
lack of discount competition in the
publishing industry. Arnold offered
two explanations for this.
First, professors select the stock of
books and supplying companies,
without knowledge of relative
prices. Second, consolidation in the
publishing industry is hurting com
petition, Arnold said.
Pretty soon we'll need antitrust in
the publishing industry," he added.
Publishers, however, do not agree
that their industry is the profiteering
better half. According to Harcourt
Brace's West Coast textbook man
ager, Bill Barnett, textbook price in
creases have been trailing "far be
hind" the rate of inflation.

He called the industry "one of our
economy's most competitive," being
composed of about 50 firms.
An editor from Wadsworth pub
lishing company, Rebecca Haydn,
said textbook prices are now lower
than they were during the depres
sion in relation to the minimum
wage, while the books produced
have become "much more lavish" in
quality.
Publishing company Scott Fores
man s textbook representative Earl
Karn explained the industry's "fixed"
20 percent discount rate as a market
imperfection due to professors, and
not the profit-maximizing business
world, who are choosing the books
to be ordered.
