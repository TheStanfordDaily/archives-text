# SWOPSI energy class: practicing as they teach
## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
As a result of the SWOPSI
course, "Energy Conservation As
An Energy Resource," several
campus conservation projects are
being implemented.
For example, members of the
class recently installed insulation
in the Phi Psi House and plan to
put in fireplace covers within five
or six weeks. Also planned is a
solar water heating system for
Roth House, which should be
completed by the end of the quar
ter.
Karl Johnson, instructor of the
SWOPSI course and coordinator
of the Energy Conservation
Center, said, "We are putting in
sulation between the floor of the
attic and the ceiling of the third
floor. Because the third floor uses
seven electric heaters and three
hot water radiators, it is important
to keep the generated heat on the
floor, rather than allow it to es
cape through the attic."
The project was funded, at a
cost of $1900, by Ed Scholes, di
rector of housing and food ser

vices, and Rob Ramirez, manager
of the residential housing office.
"We are using monotherm in
sulation because it is, essentially,
recycled newspaper," Johnson
explained. "Consequently, it
takes less energy to produce it,
and it is much safer to work with.
Anyone who has worked with
fiberglass knows that the material
splinters into the skin. This prob
lem is alleviated by using
monotherm insulation."
The insulation project is ex
pected to cut Phi Psi's heating
needs by 20 percent and should
pay for itself in energy saving in
five years.
Johnson, commenting on the
fire covers, said "At the Phi Psi
house, 13 percent of the heat from
the fireplaces goes up the flue be
cause there are no dampers. The
covers will prevent that heat
loss."
The SWOPSI course, offered
Autumn quarter, will continue
through Winter and Spring quar
ters, with an emphasis on energy
conservation and conservation
projects.
