# Physics graduate student chosen for astronaut team
## 
### Dave Ansley 
Sally Ride, a graduate student in
physics here, was selected yesterday
as one of 35 new NASA astronauts.
She was among six women named to
the formerly all-male astronaut
corps.
A Ph.D. candidate in astrophysics,
Ride was chosen to be a mission
specialist to fly aboard space shuttle
flights, where she will conduct a
wide range of orbiting experiments.
"X-ray astrophysics is my field right
now," Ride said, "but as a mission
specialist I won't be doing just that.
I'll be in charge of all experiments on
the flight."
She said these would include earth
resource experiments (investigating
weather patterns, mineral reserves
and land use), biological tests of the
effects of weightlessness and as
tronomy.
The space shuttle, which was first
tested last summer atop a 747, won't

be launched into space until next
year. A fleet of the reuseable
rocket-powered craft will eventually
be built to carry a crew into space
every week for a decade.
Ride begins a year of astronaut
training in July — "perfect timing,"
she says, since she plans to complete
her Ph.D. in June.
"It's not clear what the training in
volves, but it doesn't involve flight
training. We'll be learning about
communications and about the ex
periments," she said.
"It's not just test pilots anymore."
Always interested
NASA's head of mission specialists
telephoned Ride yesterday morning
to tell her of the selection.
Her first reaction to the news: "I
was very excited — and happy."
"I've always been interested in as
tronomy, since before high school,"
she said.
After two years at Swarthmore Col
lege, she completed degrees in En
glish and physics here in 1973. Ride
received her master's in physics
about three years ago and has since
been studying X-ray astrophysics —
the detection of X-rays emitted by
stellar objects including, perhaps,
black holes.
"I applied about a year ago, when
NASA let it be known that it was in
terested in women as astronauts. I
don't know quite how I got in
terested in it — it seemed a natural
thing to do. I know a lot of people
who jumped at the chance to apply;
it seemed perfectly reasonable to
want to do that."
From about 7000 applicants, NASA
selected 200 potential specialists and
pilots last October. (Each shuttle car
ries two pilots, a mission specialist,
and up to seven passengers.)
"We spent a week in Houston
going through medical testing and
psychological testing and being in
terviewed," Ride recalled.
Sat and worried
After returning to Stanford, "I
wasn't subjected to the competi
tion," she said. "I sat in my office
and worried, but I didn't feel like I
was competing with someone else."
Why does she think she was

selected?
"I'd like to think I was chosen be
cause I am a scientist, not because I
am a woman."
One factor which she thinks
helped her application was her
sports background. Ride plays
rugby, volleyball and tennis and runs
five miles a day, so she's confident
her physical condition is sufficient
for the astronaut program.
She responded with a quick "no"
when asked whether she feared
being launched into space or being
in orbit with a lot of men.
"My only apprehension," Ride
said, "is that while I'm in the program
I won't be able to do as much re
search as I'd like to."
Other astronauts
Five other women, three black
men and an Asian are among the 35
astronauts chosen yesterday to fly
space shuttles.
This is the first time that women
and minoritv-group members have
joined the as'ronaut corps. The
group of 35 is tl e largest list of as
tronauts ever selected and the first
group named sim e 1969.
All of the women, two of the blacks
and the Asian will be among 20
mission specialists in the new as
tronaut class. The other black is one
of 15 pilots named.
Robert Frosch, head of NASA, said
the new astronauts will report July 1
to NASA's Johnson Space Center in
Houston. They will join 27 astronauts
already on flight status.
The large number of new as
tronauts reflects NASA's belief that
by 1985 it will be launching as many
as 60 space shuttle flights a year, each
lasting from seven to 30 days.
The other women named are Anna
Fisher of Rancho Palos Verdes, a
physician; Shannon Lucid of Ok
lahoma City, a post-doctoral fellow
in biochemistry; Judith Resnik, Re
dondo Beach, a member of the en
gineering staff of Xerox Corp.; Mar
garet Seddon, Memphis, a physi
cian; and Kathryn Sullivan, Halifax,
Nova Scotia, a post-graduate student
at Dalhousie University. Sullivan is a
U.S. citizen whose parents live in
Cupertino.

physics here, was selected yesterday
as one of 35 new NASA astronauts.
She was among six women named to
the formerly all-male astronaut
corps.
A Ph.D. candidate in astrophysics,
Ride was chosen to be a mission
specialist to fly aboard space shuttle
flights, where she will conduct a
wide range of orbiting experiments.
"X-ray astrophysics is my field right
now," Ride said, "but as a mission
specialist I won't be doing just that.
I'll be in charge of all experiments on
the flight."
She said these would include earth
resource experiments (investigating
weather patterns, mineral reserves
and land use), biological tests of the
effects of weightlessness and as
tronomy.
The space shuttle, which was first
tested last summer atop a 747, won't

be launched into space until next
year. A fleet of the reuseable
rocket-powered craft will eventually
be built to carry a crew into space
every week for a decade.
Ride begins a year of astronaut
training in July — "perfect timing,"
she says, since she plans to complete
her Ph.D. in June.
"It's not clear what the training in
volves, but it doesn't involve flight
training. We'll be learning about
communications and about the ex
periments," she said.
"It's not just test pilots anymore."
Always interested
NASA's head of mission specialists
telephoned Ride yesterday morning
to tell her of the selection.
Her first reaction to the news: "I
was very excited — and happy."
"I've always been interested in as
tronomy, since before high school,"
she said.
After two years at Swarthmore Col
lege, she completed degrees in En
glish and physics here in 1973. Ride
received her master's in physics
about three years ago and has since
been studying X-ray astrophysics —
the detection of X-rays emitted by
stellar objects including, perhaps,
black holes.
"I applied about a year ago, when
NASA let it be known that it was in
terested in women as astronauts. I
don't know quite how I got in
terested in it — it seemed a natural
thing to do. I know a lot of people
who jumped at the chance to apply;
it seemed perfectly reasonable to
want to do that."
From about 7000 applicants, NASA
selected 200 potential specialists and
pilots last October. (Each shuttle car
ries two pilots, a mission specialist,
and up to seven passengers.)
"We spent a week in Houston
going through medical testing and
psychological testing and being in
terviewed," Ride recalled.
Sat and worried
After returning to Stanford, "I
wasn't subjected to the competi
tion," she said. "I sat in my office
and worried, but I didn't feel like I
was competing with someone else."
Why does she think she was

selected?
"I'd like to think I was chosen be
cause I am a scientist, not because I
am a woman."
One factor which she thinks
helped her application was her
sports background. Ride plays
rugby, volleyball and tennis and runs
five miles a day, so she's confident
her physical condition is sufficient
for the astronaut program.
She responded with a quick "no"
when asked whether she feared
being launched into space or being
in orbit with a lot of men.
"My only apprehension," Ride
said, "is that while I'm in the program
I won't be able to do as much re
search as I'd like to."
Other astronauts
Five other women, three black
men and an Asian are among the 35
astronauts chosen yesterday to fly
space shuttles.
This is the first time that women
and minoritv-group members have
joined the as'ronaut corps. The
group of 35 is tl e largest list of as
tronauts ever selected and the first
group named sim e 1969.
All of the women, two of the blacks
and the Asian will be among 20
mission specialists in the new as
tronaut class. The other black is one
of 15 pilots named.
Robert Frosch, head of NASA, said
the new astronauts will report July 1
to NASA's Johnson Space Center in
Houston. They will join 27 astronauts
already on flight status.
The large number of new as
tronauts reflects NASA's belief that
by 1985 it will be launching as many
as 60 space shuttle flights a year, each
lasting from seven to 30 days.
The other women named are Anna
Fisher of Rancho Palos Verdes, a
physician; Shannon Lucid of Ok
lahoma City, a post-doctoral fellow
in biochemistry; Judith Resnik, Re
dondo Beach, a member of the en
gineering staff of Xerox Corp.; Mar
garet Seddon, Memphis, a physi
cian; and Kathryn Sullivan, Halifax,
Nova Scotia, a post-graduate student
at Dalhousie University. Sullivan is a
U.S. citizen whose parents live in
Cupertino.

She was among six women named to
the formerly all-male astronaut
corps.
A Ph.D. candidate in astrophysics,
Ride was chosen to be a mission
specialist to fly aboard space shuttle
flights, where she will conduct a
wide range of orbiting experiments.
"X-ray astrophysics is my field right
now," Ride said, "but as a mission
specialist I won't be doing just that.
I'll be in charge of all experiments on
the flight."
She said these would include earth
resource experiments (investigating
weather patterns, mineral reserves
and land use), biological tests of the
effects of weightlessness and as
tronomy.
The space shuttle, which was first
tested last summer atop a 747, won't

be launched into space until next
year. A fleet of the reuseable
rocket-powered craft will eventually
be built to carry a crew into space
every week for a decade.
Ride begins a year of astronaut
training in July — "perfect timing,"
she says, since she plans to complete
her Ph.D. in June.
"It's not clear what the training in
volves, but it doesn't involve flight
training. We'll be learning about
communications and about the ex
periments," she said.
"It's not just test pilots anymore."
Always interested
NASA's head of mission specialists
telephoned Ride yesterday morning
to tell her of the selection.
Her first reaction to the news: "I
was very excited — and happy."
"I've always been interested in as
tronomy, since before high school,"
she said.
After two years at Swarthmore Col
lege, she completed degrees in En
glish and physics here in 1973. Ride
received her master's in physics
about three years ago and has since
been studying X-ray astrophysics —
the detection of X-rays emitted by
stellar objects including, perhaps,
black holes.
"I applied about a year ago, when
NASA let it be known that it was in
terested in women as astronauts. I
don't know quite how I got in
terested in it — it seemed a natural
thing to do. I know a lot of people
who jumped at the chance to apply;
it seemed perfectly reasonable to
want to do that."
From about 7000 applicants, NASA
selected 200 potential specialists and
pilots last October. (Each shuttle car
ries two pilots, a mission specialist,
and up to seven passengers.)
"We spent a week in Houston
going through medical testing and
psychological testing and being in
terviewed," Ride recalled.
Sat and worried
After returning to Stanford, "I
wasn't subjected to the competi
tion," she said. "I sat in my office
and worried, but I didn't feel like I
was competing with someone else."
Why does she think she was

selected?
"I'd like to think I was chosen be
cause I am a scientist, not because I
am a woman."
One factor which she thinks
helped her application was her
sports background. Ride plays
rugby, volleyball and tennis and runs
five miles a day, so she's confident
her physical condition is sufficient
for the astronaut program.
She responded with a quick "no"
when asked whether she feared
being launched into space or being
in orbit with a lot of men.
"My only apprehension," Ride
said, "is that while I'm in the program
I won't be able to do as much re
search as I'd like to."
Other astronauts
Five other women, three black
men and an Asian are among the 35
astronauts chosen yesterday to fly
space shuttles.
This is the first time that women
and minoritv-group members have
joined the as'ronaut corps. The
group of 35 is tl e largest list of as
tronauts ever selected and the first
group named sim e 1969.
All of the women, two of the blacks
and the Asian will be among 20
mission specialists in the new as
tronaut class. The other black is one
of 15 pilots named.
Robert Frosch, head of NASA, said
the new astronauts will report July 1
to NASA's Johnson Space Center in
Houston. They will join 27 astronauts
already on flight status.
The large number of new as
tronauts reflects NASA's belief that
by 1985 it will be launching as many
as 60 space shuttle flights a year, each
lasting from seven to 30 days.
The other women named are Anna
Fisher of Rancho Palos Verdes, a
physician; Shannon Lucid of Ok
lahoma City, a post-doctoral fellow
in biochemistry; Judith Resnik, Re
dondo Beach, a member of the en
gineering staff of Xerox Corp.; Mar
garet Seddon, Memphis, a physi
cian; and Kathryn Sullivan, Halifax,
Nova Scotia, a post-graduate student
at Dalhousie University. Sullivan is a
U.S. citizen whose parents live in
Cupertino.
