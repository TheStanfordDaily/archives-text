# Supreme Court to hear 'Stanford Daily' case today
## Case arises from 1971 Palo Alto police search of 'Daily' offices for photos Zurcher argues 'probable cause' warrants search 
### 
The Supreme Court is
scheduled to hear the Daily's
case this afternoon. Attorneys
for the defendants, who
petitioned the court to review
the case, will argue first. Each
side is allowed one-half hour in
which to present its case and
respond to questions from the
justices.
The petitioners can choose
to divide their 30 minutes into
an opening statement and then
a reply after the Daily presents
its arguments. Due to the
court's schedule, there is the
chance that arguments in the
case may be concluded tomor
row morning.
The nine justices are Chief
lustice Warren Burger, and As
sociate Justices William Bren
nan, Potter Stewart, Byron
White, Thurgood Marshall,
Harry Blackmun, Lewis Powell,
William Rehnquist and john
Paul Stevens.

Justice Brennan is undergo
ing medical treatment for
throat cancer and may not at
tend today's hearing.
Many briefs have been filed
with the court. The following
persons and groups have pre
sented these arguments for the
court's attention:
Palo Alto Police Chief James
Zurcher and four police offic
ers are petitioners. They argue
that there should be no addi
tional requirements beyond
that of probable cause to be
lieve items are in a certain
place for police officers to ob
tain a search warrant; that the
police officers in this case
acted in compliance with then
existing law and should not be
held liable for their conduct;
and that the award of attor
neys' fees should not be up
held.
District Attorney Louis
Bergna of Santa Clara County

and Deputy District Attorney
Craig Brown are also petition
ers. They also argue that there
should be no other require
ment except that there be
probable cause to believe
items are in a particular place in
order to obtain a warrant. They
further argue that the award of
attorneys' fees violates the ab
solute immunity from monet
ary penalties granted to
judges, prosecutors, and those
who carry out judicial orders.
The International Associa
tion of Chiefs of Police and
Americans for Effective Law En
forcement have filed an amicus
curiae (friend of the court)
brief with the court, in which
they argue the impropriety of
the attorneys' fees award.
The attorneys general of
17 states have also filed
an amicus brief siding with the
petitioners.
Their arguments are that the
Fourth Amendment doesn't
require prohibiting the use of
search warrants directed at
third-parties, and that such a
requirement isn't consistent
with the search warrant provi
sions of all 50 states and also
undermines the ability of the
states to enforce effectively
their law. They also argue that
the attorneys' fees award
against prosecutors violates
their absolute immunity from
money damages under statut
ory law. ,
The Daily and its seven
former editors are the respon
dents. Some of their argu
ments are that before a magis
trate can issue a search warrant
directed at a non-suspect
newspaper, the magistrate
must have evidence establish
ing probable cause that a sub
poena would be impractical.
The Daily also raises the First
Amendment issues involved
when there is a search of a
non-suspect newspaper, such
as the breach of confidentiality
of material not the purpose of
the search. The Daily also ar
gues that the declaration of the
search as unconstitutional was
proper and that the award of
attorneys' fees was authorized
by a 1976 federal law.
Amici briefs have been filed
by several groups in support of
the Daily. Besides the National
Association of Criminal De
fense lawyers, the media
groups siding with the Daily
are the Reporters Committee
for Freedom of the Press, the
National Association of Broad
casters, the American Society
of Newspaper Editors, the
Radio-TV News Directors As
sociation, the Student Press
Law Center, the National
Newspaper Association, the
American Newspapers Pub
lishers Association, the Society
of Professional Journalists
(Sigma Delta Chi), the As
sociated Press Managing
Editors Association.
The media groups argue that
newsroom searches needlessly
endanger confidential mate
rial, have a chilling effect on
freedom of the press and dis
rupt newsroom operations.

Paul Stevens.

Justice Brennan is undergo
ing medical treatment for
throat cancer and may not at
tend today's hearing.
Many briefs have been filed
with the court. The following
persons and groups have pre
sented these arguments for the
court's attention:
Palo Alto Police Chief James
Zurcher and four police offic
ers are petitioners. They argue
that there should be no addi
tional requirements beyond
that of probable cause to be
lieve items are in a certain
place for police officers to ob
tain a search warrant; that the
police officers in this case
acted in compliance with then
existing law and should not be
held liable for their conduct;
and that the award of attor
neys' fees should not be up
held.
District Attorney Louis
Bergna of Santa Clara County

and Deputy District Attorney
Craig Brown are also petition
ers. They also argue that there
should be no other require
ment except that there be
probable cause to believe
items are in a particular place in
order to obtain a warrant. They
further argue that the award of
attorneys' fees violates the ab
solute immunity from monet
ary penalties granted to
judges, prosecutors, and those
who carry out judicial orders.
The International Associa
tion of Chiefs of Police and
Americans for Effective Law En
forcement have filed an amicus
curiae (friend of the court)
brief with the court, in which
they argue the impropriety of
the attorneys' fees award.
The attorneys general of
17 states have also filed
an amicus brief siding with the
petitioners.
Their arguments are that the
Fourth Amendment doesn't
require prohibiting the use of
search warrants directed at
third-parties, and that such a
requirement isn't consistent
with the search warrant provi
sions of all 50 states and also
undermines the ability of the
states to enforce effectively
their law. They also argue that
the attorneys' fees award
against prosecutors violates
their absolute immunity from
money damages under statut
ory law. ,
The Daily and its seven
former editors are the respon
dents. Some of their argu
ments are that before a magis
trate can issue a search warrant
directed at a non-suspect
newspaper, the magistrate
must have evidence establish
ing probable cause that a sub
poena would be impractical.
The Daily also raises the First
Amendment issues involved
when there is a search of a
non-suspect newspaper, such
as the breach of confidentiality
of material not the purpose of
the search. The Daily also ar
gues that the declaration of the
search as unconstitutional was
proper and that the award of
attorneys' fees was authorized
by a 1976 federal law.
Amici briefs have been filed
by several groups in support of
the Daily. Besides the National
Association of Criminal De
fense lawyers, the media
groups siding with the Daily
are the Reporters Committee
for Freedom of the Press, the
National Association of Broad
casters, the American Society
of Newspaper Editors, the
Radio-TV News Directors As
sociation, the Student Press
Law Center, the National
Newspaper Association, the
American Newspapers Pub
lishers Association, the Society
of Professional Journalists
(Sigma Delta Chi), the As
sociated Press Managing
Editors Association.
The media groups argue that
newsroom searches needlessly
endanger confidential mate
rial, have a chilling effect on
freedom of the press and dis
rupt newsroom operations.
