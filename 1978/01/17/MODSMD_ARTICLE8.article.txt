# Search follows riot at hospital
## 
### 
The U.S. Supreme Court will
hear oral arguments today in a
case involving a lawsuit which
the Daily filed against Palo Alto
police officers after they used a
search warrant to raid the Dai
ly's offices on April 12, 1971 in
an attempt to find photographs
of demonstrators.
Two lower federal courts
have declared the search as
violating First Amendment free
press protections and Fourth
Amendment prohibitions
against unreasonable searches
and seizures. The courts have
also decided that the City of
Palo Alto and the County of
Santa Clara should pay the fees
of the Daily's attorneys.
Since the Daily's offices were
searched, three radio stations
and one newspaper in Califor
nia and a Rhode Island TV sta
tion have been searched.
Searches also were aimed at
several Bay Area TV stations
last month.
The Daily's search was pre
cipitated by a riot at Stanford
Hospital, which ended a 30-
hour long sit-in.
A coalition of blacks pre
sented a list of demands to the
hospital administration on
April 6, 1971, to protest the fir
ing of a black hospital custo
dian named Sam Bridges and
the continuing lay-offs of other
hospital employees at that
time. Two days later, after a
rally and negotiations with
hospital officials who decided
to grant all the demands except
the rehiring of Bridges, protes
ters began a sit-in in a hospital
administrative corridor.
That sit-in was ended the
next evening, April 9th. Palo
Alto Police Chief lames
Zurcher recalled that 100 or
more demonstrators had been
in the corridor and that patient
care in a nearby corridor was

being affected.
Hospital administrators then
called in police. Some 65 Palo
Alto police and 110 sheriff's
deputies arrived to clear out
the demonstrators, about 60 of
whom had since barricaded
themselves in the corridor.
The major force of police
was at the corridor's west end,
with a smaller detachment of
about nine officers at the east
end.
"We thought it would be a
simple matter of carrying
people out of the corridor,"
explained Zurcher recently
about the deployment of
police.
However, police attempts to
break down the barricaded
west doors proved futile.
Police then sprayed a Mace
equivalent at the de
monstrators, which the de
monstrators blew back at the
police and on-lookers with a
fire hose. After three more
fruitless attempts, police then
loosened and pulled out one
door.
At that moment, de
monstrators began to exit at
the east end and overcame the
small group of police stationed
there, several of whom the
demonstrators beat.
Twenty-three persons were
arrested at the demonstration,
and police later made six more
arrests. Almost 40 protesters
and police were injured, and
$100,000 of damage was done
to the hospital.
Several demonstrators, in
cluding some who had at
tacked police, had escaped.
Zurcher said it was the police
department's understanding
that Daily photographers were
stationed at the east end. This
understanding was confirmed
for the police when the Daily
published an issue two days

later which featured some pic
tures of the demonstration,
said Zurcher.
Zurcher, who did not know
about the search until after it
occurred, said his officers saw
the Daily's issue and then went
to the district attorney and a
judge of the municipal court to
follow the applicable law of the
time for procuring search war
rants.
On the evening of April 12th,
four police officers entered the
Daily offices without prior
notice. These police officers
had two Stanford police offic
ers meet them at the Daily's of
fices with a key. Since the of
fice was open, the Stanford
police looked on while Palo
Alto officers made a thorough
search of the office looking for
negatives and pictures of the
demonstration.
Police went through photo
files along with desks, filing
cabinets, wastebaskets, mail
boxes and shelves before leav
ing empty-handed.
The search immediately
brought national attention,
and journalists and others st
ernly decried the search.
LeeGreathouse, Daily photo
editor at the time, said then,
"This year Daily photographers
have been threatened, maced,
and chased while trying to do
their jobs. But nothing has
seriously affected our ability to
capture the news as this in
timidation by search warrant."
Those involved in the search
said they obtained a warrant
partly because of a published
Daily policy on photographs
(see below, "Daily photo pol
icy") to destroy evidence
which might incriminate
people.
The deputy district attorney
who obtained the warrant,
Craig Brown, said at the time of

the search one reason a search
was made was because his of
fice believed the Daily's policy
was designed "to protect crim
inals."
Zurcher said then that the
search was based on informa
tion that the Daily had material
which might be of some
evidentiary value to the district
attorney's office in criminal
prosecutions.
The Daily and seven of its
then-staff members brought
suit against the police shortly
afterwards (see "Legal his
tory").
Felicity Barringer, then
editor, recalled recently that
"Stanford and the country
were fairly different places
when (the search) happened —
those were emotional times."
Remembering the search,
Barringer said, "it was a search
for photographs of a demonst
ration that was ve£y bloody."
Current Palo Alio police re
cords show that of the 29 ar
rested for the demonstration,
25 were arrested by Palo Alto
police, two by the county
sheriff, and two were juvenile
cases.
Of those 25 arrested by Palo
Alto police, 11 were convicted
who then served out their pro
bation and, following their re
quests, had their convictions
expunged by court order.
Police records show that the
remaining 14 people were con
victed of the following mis
demeanor of felony charges:
trespassing, rioting, carrying a
concealed weapon, assault,
battery, assault on a police of
ficer and battery on a police of
ficer.
