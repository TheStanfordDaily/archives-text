# Lyman wants students on CIR
## 
### Craig Dennis 
Refusal by the ASSU Senate and
the Nominations Committee to ap
point students to the restructured
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR) received criticism yes
terday from President Richard Lyman
and Nelson Dong, an alumnus who
served on the ad hoc Committee on
Investment Responsibility.
Lyman said it was "premature" to
say what action will be taken next,
but he added, "My own opinion is
there ought to be students on this
council."
He said if there is to be a "workable
system this year," students would
have to be appointed in the next few
weeks. He noted that the "proxy sea
son" is nearing "pretty darn soon,"
and "it's important that there be stu
dent representation."
Lyman, who was on the East Coast
last week attending various meetings
and missed some of the on-campus
debate, was interviewed on KZSU's
Campus Conference last night.
Vast improvement
In a letter just released to the stu
dent members of the ad hoc CIR,
Dong said, "I personally feel that the
new statement is a vast improvement
over the 1971 statement and fairly in
corporates what the overwhelming
majority of our own ad hoc commit
tee recommended."
Dong was responding to charges
by student committee members
Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon and Anne
Henkels that the Board of Trustees at
their December meeting had
changed the intent of the ad hoc
committee's recommendations.
He listed 15 new provisions in the
1977 statement that "represent a
substantial improvement" over the
1971 guidelines for the CIR.
"There is now a frank and honest

recognition that the concept of cor
porate social responsibility is inhe
rent in stock ownership. That state
ment is more far-reaching than any
thing that our own ad hoc committee
drafted, especially when viewed
against the 1971 guidelines," Dong
wrote.
Four points stressed
Lyman stressed four points in an
opening statement before actual
questions began on the radio prog
ram. He said the trustees had to act in
December if "we were to have such a
commission in place in time for this
year's proxy votes."
They were "not rushing to judg
ment or moving to stifle discussion,"
he continued.
The debate on the ad hoc commit
tee's recommendations was the
"longest and most earnest" discus
sion Lyman has ever heard at a trus
tees meeting, he said. "The trustees
were not of one mind," he con
tinued.
Lyman believes there are two main
reasons for the questions he is hear
ing. There is a misunderstanding of
what the amendments meant and a
fear of the report to be used as an
"excuse" to do nothing, he said.
"There are going to be judgment
calls every step of this process,"
Lyman said, using the vagueness of
trust laws as an example. "There is no
way to resolve those fears," he said.
'A starting point'
He said the modified CIR should
be "a starting point. Until it's in op
eration, we have no way of knowing
how well it will work."
Jing Lyman, the president's wife,
who attended the taping with her
husband, said she had talked to two
trustees who were "distressed" by
recent student action.
Lyman himself said, "As far as the

majority of trustees are concerned,
there will be considerable feeling
that the boycott was unjustified and a
grossly premature move."
He also said it was "reasonable to
assume" that the trustees will not
meet the demands of the Stanford
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility to divest its stockholdings in
nine companies with investments in
South Africa by a Feb. 14 deadline.
"In fact," Lyman said, "as the pol
icy emerged from the ad hoc Com
mission and as it is in the final version
there are a whole lot of steps that are
supposed to be taken before you go
to the ultimate of divestiture."

what the amendments meant and a
fear of the report to be used as an
"excuse" to do nothing, he said.
"There are going to be judgment
calls every step of this process,"
Lyman said, using the vagueness of
trust laws as an example. "There is no
way to resolve those fears," he said.
'A starting point'
He said the modified CIR should
be "a starting point. Until it's in op
eration, we have no way of knowing
how well it will work."
Jing Lyman, the president's wife,
who attended the taping with her
husband, said she had talked to two
trustees who were "distressed" by
recent student action.
Lyman himself said, "As far as the

majority of trustees are concerned,
there will be considerable feeling
that the boycott was unjustified and a
grossly premature move."
He also said it was "reasonable to
assume" that the trustees will not
meet the demands of the Stanford
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility to divest its stockholdings in
nine companies with investments in
South Africa by a Feb. 14 deadline.
"In fact," Lyman said, "as the pol
icy emerged from the ad hoc Com
mission and as it is in the final version
there are a whole lot of steps that are
supposed to be taken before you go
to the ultimate of divestiture."

Refusal by the ASSU Senate and
the Nominations Committee to ap
point students to the restructured
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR) received criticism yes
terday from President Richard Lyman
and Nelson Dong, an alumnus who
served on the ad hoc Committee on
Investment Responsibility.
Lyman said it was "premature" to
say what action will be taken next,
but he added, "My own opinion is
there ought to be students on this
council."
He said if there is to be a "workable
system this year," students would
have to be appointed in the next few
weeks. He noted that the "proxy sea
son" is nearing "pretty darn soon,"
and "it's important that there be stu
dent representation."
Lyman, who was on the East Coast
last week attending various meetings
and missed some of the on-campus
debate, was interviewed on KZSU's
Campus Conference last night.
Vast improvement
In a letter just released to the stu
dent members of the ad hoc CIR,
Dong said, "I personally feel that the
new statement is a vast improvement
over the 1971 statement and fairly in
corporates what the overwhelming
majority of our own ad hoc commit
tee recommended."
Dong was responding to charges
by student committee members
Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon and Anne
Henkels that the Board of Trustees at
their December meeting had
changed the intent of the ad hoc
committee's recommendations.
He listed 15 new provisions in the
1977 statement that "represent a
substantial improvement" over the
1971 guidelines for the CIR.
"There is now a frank and honest

recognition that the concept of cor
porate social responsibility is inhe
rent in stock ownership. That state
ment is more far-reaching than any
thing that our own ad hoc committee
drafted, especially when viewed
against the 1971 guidelines," Dong
wrote.
Four points stressed
Lyman stressed four points in an
opening statement before actual
questions began on the radio prog
ram. He said the trustees had to act in
December if "we were to have such a
commission in place in time for this
year's proxy votes."
They were "not rushing to judg
ment or moving to stifle discussion,"
he continued.
The debate on the ad hoc commit
tee's recommendations was the
"longest and most earnest" discus
sion Lyman has ever heard at a trus
tees meeting, he said. "The trustees
were not of one mind," he con
tinued.
Lyman believes there are two main
reasons for the questions he is hear
ing. There is a misunderstanding of
what the amendments meant and a
fear of the report to be used as an
"excuse" to do nothing, he said.
"There are going to be judgment
calls every step of this process,"
Lyman said, using the vagueness of
