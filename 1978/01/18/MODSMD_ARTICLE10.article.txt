# Distinguishing premeds
## Who's been accepted?

If you have at least four friends (and chances are that
you do unless you're a resident of the Androgyny house
who was caught with a copy of Hustler magazine), the
next 12 weeks could be crucial. According to the watch
dog of the Stanford undergraduate body, COCWS, the
Committee to Overlook Cheating by Wealthy Students,
at least one of your friends is a senior who wants to
attend medical school next year. And sometime in the
next 12 weeks all these seniors will be hearing the news
regarding their admission.
Admittedly, a few people, i.e. redhots, have already
received a confirmation from some medical school. I will
deal with them later. And believe it or not, there are a
few students who were rejected by all medical schools
two or three days after they had applied.
Of course, these students are a very special lot. Some
simply aren't too bright, i.e. those who took the MCATS
and instead of receiving their results got a refund and an
autographed picture of a chiropractor. Others applied
just for kicks. A friend of mine actually snorted a sup
pository and in his ensuing stupor sent applications to
every medical school in the country and the Diesel
Mechanics School of Memphis. (He's on the waiting list
there.)
However, the people who know they will not be at
tending medical school next year are not the subjects of
this column. The next 12 weeks are crucial because of
those who have been admitted and those who haven't
heard These are the friends who will undergo a radical
psychological transformation, either becoming so
proud and cocky that they make Philip Zimbardo look
shy, or losing all their self respect to become spineless
jellyfish.
To begin to cope with these Jekyll and Hydes, wo must
learn how to spot them in a crowd. Therefore, I have
assembled a few tell-taie signs one can use to distinguish
the "admitted" from the "waiting."
You know you're looking at someone who's already

gotten into med school when:
1. You're watching an intramural (IM) basketball game
and one of the players is wearing a white lab coat.
2. One of the vendors in White Plaza is a student selling
futures on a complete physical.
3. The only thing your date is interested in fingering is
your pulse.
4. A student appears in a chemistry class wearing a lei
sure suit made out of his acceptance letters.
5. A biology class is disrupted by some student arrang
ing a little barnyard scene with all the fetal pigs.
On the other hand, you know you are looking at
someone waiting to hear from medical schools when:
1. The person in question has pitched a tent in front of
his post office box and bitten the hands of at least
three postal workers.
2. You mention any word containing the letters "m" and
"d" and the person to whom you're speaking loses
voluntary control of the left eyelid and swallows his or
her lower lip.
3. A student is seen in Memorial Church more often
than the minister.
4. You see someone in Meyer Library trying to Xerox a
cadaver.
5. A student has had his fingers crossed for so long, he
visits a restaurant and the maitre d' puts him in the
live lobster tank by mistake.
These guidelines should make life easier for all of us in
the next 12 weeks. Please remember, medical school
candidates require special treatment. Those who ha
ven't been notified should be encouraged by their
peers. (I have several pamphlets left over from the
Diesel Mechanics School.) And to those who have got
ten in: medicine will soon be socialized so you can
forget about buying that Porsche.

If you have at least four friends (and chances are that
you do unless you're a resident of the Androgyny house
who was caught with a copy of Hustler magazine), the
next 12 weeks could be crucial. According to the watch
dog of the Stanford undergraduate body, COCWS, the
Committee to Overlook Cheating by Wealthy Students,
at least one of your friends is a senior who wants to
attend medical school next year. And sometime in the
next 12 weeks all these seniors will be hearing the news
regarding their admission.
Admittedly, a few people, i.e. redhots, have already
received a confirmation from some medical school. I will
deal with them later. And believe it or not, there are a
few students who were rejected by all medical schools
two or three days after they had applied.
Of course, these students are a very special lot. Some
simply aren't too bright, i.e. those who took the MCATS
and instead of receiving their results got a refund and an
autographed picture of a chiropractor. Others applied
just for kicks. A friend of mine actually snorted a sup
pository and in his ensuing stupor sent applications to
every medical school in the country and the Diesel
Mechanics School of Memphis. (He's on the waiting list
there.)
However, the people who know they will not be at
tending medical school next year are not the subjects of
this column. The next 12 weeks are crucial because of
those who have been admitted and those who haven't
heard These are the friends who will undergo a radical
psychological transformation, either becoming so
proud and cocky that they make Philip Zimbardo look
shy, or losing all their self respect to become spineless
jellyfish.
To begin to cope with these Jekyll and Hydes, wo must
learn how to spot them in a crowd. Therefore, I have
assembled a few tell-taie signs one can use to distinguish
the "admitted" from the "waiting."
You know you're looking at someone who's already

gotten into med school when:
1. You're watching an intramural (IM) basketball game
and one of the players is wearing a white lab coat.
2. One of the vendors in White Plaza is a student selling
futures on a complete physical.
3. The only thing your date is interested in fingering is
your pulse.
4. A student appears in a chemistry class wearing a lei
sure suit made out of his acceptance letters.
5. A biology class is disrupted by some student arrang
ing a little barnyard scene with all the fetal pigs.
On the other hand, you know you are looking at
someone waiting to hear from medical schools when:
1. The person in question has pitched a tent in front of
his post office box and bitten the hands of at least
three postal workers.
2. You mention any word containing the letters "m" and
"d" and the person to whom you're speaking loses
voluntary control of the left eyelid and swallows his or
her lower lip.
