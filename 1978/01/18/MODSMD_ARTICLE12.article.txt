# Sugar may cause high blood pressure

### 
Newport Beach (AP) — For
millions of Americans with a
tendency toward high hlood
pressure, the sugar bowl may
join the salt shaker as an un
welcome dinner guest, a re
searcher suggested yesterday.
The implication that sugar
may be a partial cause of high
blood pressure, or hyperten
sion, was contained in a report
on experimental diets fed
monkeys by researchers at
Louisiana State University.
Dr. Gerald Berenson told a
science writers' forum that
monkeys on a diet of high salt
and sugar experienced a rise in
blood pressure exceeding that
of monkeys fed only a high-salt
diet. Both diets raised blood
pressure far higher than did a
control diet with no added salt
or sugar.
Though the cause of hyper
tension — which affects one in
six adults and can lead to

deadly heart and kidney dis
ease — is in most cases un
known, high salt intake has for
some time been viewed as a
contributing factor.
Berenson told the forum,
sponsored by the American
Heart Association, that a high
sugar diet not only seems to
increase the effect of salt on
blood pressure, but also to in
crease cholesterol levels in the
blood.
Though there can be no di
rect comparison of experimen
tal results in animals with
studies in humans, Berenson
commented on the high salt
and sugar intake of children in
LSU's Bogalusa Heart Study.
In that study, begun in 1972,
more than 5000 children are
being regularly examined in an
attempt to understand the
early development of hyper
tension in coronary heart dis
ease.

"We're beginning to detect
hypertension in our school
aged children," he said. "We
have spent a lot of time looking
at the nutritional intake of the
children, and I think there are
some significant observations:
One is that the children are
consuming about 34 percent of
their calories in snack foods
alone which are high in sugar
and are eating a high-salt diet
— by body weight, about 1 Vi
times what adults are eating."
The spider monkeys in Be
renson's study were divided
into three groups. One group
was put on a high-salt and
high-sugar diet, one on just
high salt, and one on basic
monkey chow with no added
salt or sugar. All the monkeys
had some blood pressure rise,
which Berenson attributed to
the fact that they all gained
weight.
Berenson suggested that

sugar, like salt, may cause the
body to retain water in the
blood. The higher blood vol
ume resulting from water re
tention may be partly respon
sible tor hypertension in this
case, he said.
The physician did not make
any specific recommendations
for a reduction in the sugar in
take of the average American,
however.
