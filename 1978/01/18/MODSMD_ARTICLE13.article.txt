# Hayakawa defends his Senate attendance record

### 
San Francisco (AP) — Sen. S.I.
Hayakawa, while admitting "it
wasn't terrific," yesterday de
fended his Senate voting at
tendance record that an inde
pendent journal ranked
eighth-worst. And he said he
planned "no changes" this
year.
But the 71-year-old Califor
nia junior senator promised
"to tighten up and be some
what more careful about the
scheduling."
The diminutive ex-professor
arid college president made his
remarks during a news confer
ence about his 10-day trip to
Japan this month. The atten
dance question came up early
in Hayakawa's lecture-like re
marks about his trip.
"I did do better than eight
out of 10 times when votes
came up. So the average is over
80 per cent," he said.
The figures in the Congres
sional Quarterly last week, he
declared, "do not tell the
whole story because senators
have so many duties other than
voting, especially duties in be
half of his constituents."
Hayakawa said he made
more than 15 trips back to
California during the last ses
sion to talk to defense officials,
lumbering interests, tuna fish
ing representatives, agricul
ture officials and to make
speeches.
The publication said the av
erage for the 100 senators in
the first session of the 95th
Congress was 88 percent. It
said Hayakawa's attendance
record for rollcalls was 82 per
cent and California Sen. Alan
Cranston's was 92 percent.
Hayakawa, a naturalized citi
zen born in Canada of
Japanese parents, reported
that his trip to Japan failed in at
least one respect. He can't fi
gure out how to transfer to this
country Japan's success at put
ting young people to work.

He said there were many
reasons why the Japanese sys
tem wouldn't work in America
and that he planned to do a lot
of thinking about it.
Hayakawa said he scolded
Japanese agriculture officials
for believing that Japan, one of
the richest industrialized na
tions in the world, was "a poor
little country'' when it came to
edibles and needed protec
tionist laws.
"I kept saying, You don't

have to be protectionist' ... I
don't know how much good I
did,'' he said.
Hayakawa said this country is
partly to blame for what some
have called japan's unfair
commercial advantages over
American businesses.
"The trade imbalance is not
entirely japan's fault," he con
cluded. America, he
suggested, ought to recon
sider its "squawks" against la
pan.

record for rollcalls was 82 per
cent and California Sen. Alan
Cranston's was 92 percent.
Hayakawa, a naturalized citi
zen born in Canada of
Japanese parents, reported
that his trip to Japan failed in at
least one respect. He can't fi
gure out how to transfer to this
country Japan's success at put
ting young people to work.

He said there were many
reasons why the Japanese sys
tem wouldn't work in America
and that he planned to do a lot
of thinking about it.
Hayakawa said he scolded
Japanese agriculture officials
for believing that Japan, one of
the richest industrialized na
tions in the world, was "a poor
little country'' when it came to
edibles and needed protec
tionist laws.
"I kept saying, You don't

have to be protectionist' ... I
don't know how much good I
did,'' he said.
Hayakawa said this country is
partly to blame for what some
have called japan's unfair
commercial advantages over
American businesses.
"The trade imbalance is not
entirely japan's fault," he con
cluded. America, he
suggested, ought to recon
sider its "squawks" against la
pan.
San Francisco (AP) — Sen. S.I.
Hayakawa, while admitting "it
wasn't terrific," yesterday de
fended his Senate voting at
tendance record that an inde
pendent journal ranked
eighth-worst. And he said he
planned "no changes" this
year.
But the 71-year-old Califor
nia junior senator promised
"to tighten up and be some
what more careful about the
scheduling."
The diminutive ex-professor
arid college president made his
remarks during a news confer
ence about his 10-day trip to
Japan this month. The atten
dance question came up early
in Hayakawa's lecture-like re
marks about his trip.
"I did do better than eight
out of 10 times when votes
came up. So the average is over
80 per cent," he said.
The figures in the Congres
sional Quarterly last week, he
declared, "do not tell the
whole story because senators
have so many duties other than
voting, especially duties in be
half of his constituents."
Hayakawa said he made
more than 15 trips back to
California during the last ses
sion to talk to defense officials,
lumbering interests, tuna fish
ing representatives, agricul
ture officials and to make
speeches.
The publication said the av
erage for the 100 senators in
the first session of the 95th
Congress was 88 percent. It
said Hayakawa's attendance
record for rollcalls was 82 per
cent and California Sen. Alan
Cranston's was 92 percent.
