# National Urban League: grim outlook for blacks
## 
### 
Washington (AP) —The National Urban League, describing the
state of black America as grim, said yesterday that the broad tax
cut proposal being readied by President (immy Carter is unwise,
and would not benefit blacks or the nation's troubled cities.
Any reduction in federal revenues would "become an excuse
for not implementing vitally needed urban and social programs,"
said Vernon Jordan, director of the moderate civil rights group.
Though his statement was not so harsh as the criticism he
leveled at Carter last |uly, when he said many blacks felt "bet
rayed" by the president, lordan made it clear that he is dissatis
fied with early reports on the president's tax reform and urban
policy plans.
His remarks indicated Carter can expect vocal opposition from
black leaders if they think the administration's upcoming tax and
urban proposals do not benefit blacks and the cities sufficiently.
There was no immediate reaction from the White House.
In the league's third annual "State of Black America" report,
)ordan said: "1977 was a year of continued depression, with
unacceptablv high unemployment and a widening income gap.
Most Americans consider that 1977 was a year of economic
recovery. We cannot share that view."
He told reporters, "Unemployment is an urgent and serious
problem in the black community." Asked about Carter's job
policies, lordan replied, "We are disappointed."
"The state of Black America is grim, and we expect the presi
dent to be responsive to those needs," said Jordan.
The Urban League director said, "The administration must face
up to two basic realities. First — more, much more, is needed by
way of federal actions to assist poor people and the cities.
"Second, it must recognize that the priority of balancing the
budget by 1981 cannot be reconciled with more pressing
priorities."
lordan listed four main priorities for the civil rights community:
The tax cut proposal, the administration's upcoming national
urban policy, full employment legislation now before Congress,
and passage of a welfare reform package.
