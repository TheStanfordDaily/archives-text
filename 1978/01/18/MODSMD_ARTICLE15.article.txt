# Students, inmates communicate despite cell bars
##

For those students who feel
constrained in Stanford's "iv
ory (and red-tiled) tower," the
Prison Information Center
(PIC) in the Old Firehouse, may
provide a ticket to freedom.
Legal or social research,
teaching or tutoring at the local
jail, writing a bill for the
California State Legislature on
prisoner re-entry or simply
volunteering to improve the
local jail library may provide an
interesting pasttime for stu
dents here.
The PIC provides the re
search materials and contacts
with the North County Jail in
Palo Alto.
The center, which is viewed
by director Carol Osborne as
furnishing "an alternative to
the classroom in the area of

say, 'Goddammit, why are you here?' '

criminal justice," was started
some 10 years ago, and was
originally oriented towards
prison reform.
Since then, according to
Community Consultant Louisa
Priddy, it has become steadily
de-politicized and broadened
to reflect the more diverse in
terests of Stanford in the '70s.
Scary
Lately the center has had
some ciifficulty in attracting
students, says Osborne
"They see the word prison
and they walk away like we
were poison."
Currently the PIC sponsors
approximately 10 student pro
jects.
Past and present projects in
clude research on juvenile de
liquency, the publication of
the Inmate Coalition News
paper and doing legal research
for prisoners throughout
California who have out-dated
or poorly stocked law libraries.
Student participants in PIC
have ranged from law students
to undergraduate art students,
one of which currently teaches
fine arts at the North County
Jail.
"The only requirement for
students is that they have a

positive attitude and really
care," Priddy said.
Most projects are developed
by t,he individual, with the PIC
providing the more concrete
items, such as office space, re
search materials, community
contacts, clerical assistance
and funding or credit where
possible.
For those students who feel
unsure about designing their
own projects or who don't
wish to work independently,
the PIC also serves as a liason
to established community or
ganizations, such as the
Friends Outside.
Education program
The most successful prog
ram the PIC sponsors is the
education program at North
County jail, according to Os
borne. It is also the only one of

it's kind in the nation, she ad
ded.
Under the program students
lead weekly classes for two to
15 inmates in the area of their
choice.
The classes taught thus far
have included sociology, art
and journalism. The journalism
class spawned the state-wide
Inmate Coalition Newspaper.
The program also encour
ages students to tutor inmates
on a one-to-one basis.
The North County Jail, just
minutes from the campus, is an
all-male maximum security in
stitution with a capacity of 63.
The size of the facility,
coupled with the "very suppor
tive" attitude of the director
towards the education prog
ram provides an ideal climate
for student-inmate interaction.
"As jails go," says Priddy,
"North County is a better jail."
Just the same, the average
Stanford student is apt to be a
little shocked at what he or she
encounters, Priddy said.
Bare
"The classroom the students
teach in is just a converted cell
— a cell without bunks. It's a
tiny, bare-walled, stuffy place.
You are working with almost

no facilities. It's just you, the
bare walls, a few shelves that
are called the "Law Library,"
some metal chairs and a
toilet."
Maureen Poxon, who leads a
weekly class in sociology,
found herself pleasantly sur
prised by the inmates and un-

pleasantly surprised by "the
system that they bear the brunt
of."
"Like most Stanford stu
dents, I came with a lot of pre
conceptions of what a har
dened criminal' was. People
still ask me what they look like!
"A lot of these preconcep
tions have been completely
shattered," she said.
Priddy, herself the leader of
a Sunday night "rap session,"
says one of the biggest dis
coveries awaiting the student is
the imagination, enthusiasm,
and sense of humor typically
displayed in the discussions.

"Humor is the survival
mechanism of the inmate,"
Priddy said.
"Without it, he would never
make it."
Trust
A sense of humor is essential
to the student too, she says,
recalling a situation in which

the inmates complained the
female teachers had eschewed
the wearing of skirts and
make-up, out of a fear of arr
ousing them. "You'll find
they're pretty conservative;
things can get pretty comical,"
Priddy said.

Poxon claims the initial mis
trust and fear of the situation
has disappeared from her
sociology class. A close rapport
and an informal "rap" struc
ture has taken its place.
Although she is the
"teacher," Poxon said she feels
the average student will learn
far more than he or she will
ever be able to impart to the
inmates.
"I feel so naive next to their
street-wisdom," she said.
"What they know instinctively,
we intellectualize. There's so
much creativity and potential
there that sometimes I just

want to say 'Goddammit, why
are you here?' "
College credit
Poxon, who began her
academic career as a com
munication major, knew very
little about sociology when she
began her project. Now she's
changed both her major and
her career plans to sociology
and criminal justice reform.
"All in all, it's been the most
educational process I've ever
been through," she said.
Future plans for the educa
tional program include arrang
ing college credit for participat
ing inmates (via Foothill junior

College), a drive to supply in
mates with newspapers (they
receive none now) and a
course for inmates on how to
use their own Law Library ef
fectively.
Students interested in these
projects or any other criminal
justice-related activities,
should contact Osborne at the
PIC headquarters.
"They're your peer group,
not mine," says Priddy to stu
dents. "These men average be
tween 18 and 26 years of age.
Just why do you think they're
incarcerated while you're
going to school?"

far more than he or she will
ever be able to impart to the

"I feel so naive next to their

Poxon, who began her
academic career as a com
munication major, knew very
little about sociology when she
began her project. Now she's
changed both her major and
her career plans to sociology
and criminal justice reform.
"All in all, it's been the most
educational process I've ever
been through," she said.
Future plans for the educa
tional program include arrang
ing college credit for participat
ing inmates (via Foothill junior

College), a drive to supply in
mates with newspapers (they
receive none now) and a
course for inmates on how to
use their own Law Library ef
fectively.
Students interested in these
projects or any other criminal
justice-related activities,
should contact Osborne at the
PIC headquarters.
"They're your peer group,
not mine," says Priddy to stu
dents. "These men average be
tween 18 and 26 years of age.
Just why do you think they're
incarcerated while you're
going to school?"

For those students who feel
constrained in Stanford's "iv
ory (and red-tiled) tower," the
Prison Information Center
(PIC) in the Old Firehouse, may
provide a ticket to freedom.
Legal or social research,
teaching or tutoring at the local
jail, writing a bill for the
California State Legislature on
prisoner re-entry or simply
volunteering to improve the
local jail library may provide an
interesting pasttime for stu

The PIC provides the re
search materials and contacts
with the North County Jail in
Palo Alto.

criminal justice," was started
some 10 years ago, and was
originally oriented towards
prison reform.
Since then, according to
Community Consultant Louisa
Priddy, it has become steadily
de-politicized and broadened
to reflect the more diverse in
terests of Stanford in the '70s.
Scary
Lately the center has had
some ciifficulty in attracting
students, says Osborne
"They see the word prison
and they walk away like we
were poison."
Currently the PIC sponsors
approximately 10 student pro
jects.
Past and present projects in
clude research on juvenile de
liquency, the publication of
the Inmate Coalition News
paper and doing legal research
for prisoners throughout
California who have out-dated
or poorly stocked law libraries.
Student participants in PIC
have ranged from law students
to undergraduate art students,
one of which currently teaches
fine arts at the North County
Jail.
"The only requirement for
students is that they have a

positive attitude and really
care," Priddy said.
Most projects are developed
by t,he individual, with the PIC
providing the more concrete
items, such as office space, re
search materials, community
contacts, clerical assistance
and funding or credit where
possible.
For those students who feel
unsure about designing their
own projects or who don't
wish to work independently,
the PIC also serves as a liason
to established community or
ganizations, such as the
Friends Outside.
Education program
The most successful prog
ram the PIC sponsors is the
education program at North
County jail, according to Os
borne. It is also the only one of

it's kind in the nation, she ad
ded.
Under the program students
lead weekly classes for two to
15 inmates in the area of their
choice.
The classes taught thus far
have included sociology, art
and journalism. The journalism
class spawned the state-wide
Inmate Coalition Newspaper.
The program also encour
ages students to tutor inmates
on a one-to-one basis.
The North County Jail, just
minutes from the campus, is an
all-male maximum security in
stitution with a capacity of 63.
The size of the facility,
coupled with the "very suppor
tive" attitude of the director
towards the education prog
ram provides an ideal climate
for student-inmate interaction.
"As jails go," says Priddy,
"North County is a better jail."
Just the same, the average
Stanford student is apt to be a
little shocked at what he or she
encounters, Priddy said.
Bare
"The classroom the students
teach in is just a converted cell
— a cell without bunks. It's a
tiny, bare-walled, stuffy place.
You are working with almost

no facilities. It's just you, the
bare walls, a few shelves that
are called the "Law Library,"
some metal chairs and a
toilet."
Maureen Poxon, who leads a
weekly class in sociology,
found herself pleasantly sur
prised by the inmates and un-

pleasantly surprised by "the
system that they bear the brunt
of."
"Like most Stanford stu
dents, I came with a lot of pre
conceptions of what a har
dened criminal' was. People
still ask me what they look like!
"A lot of these preconcep
tions have been completely
shattered," she said.
Priddy, herself the leader of
a Sunday night "rap session,"
says one of the biggest dis
coveries awaiting the student is
the imagination, enthusiasm,
and sense of humor typically
displayed in the discussions.

"Humor is the survival
mechanism of the inmate,"
Priddy said.
"Without it, he would never
make it."
Trust
A sense of humor is essential
to the student too, she says,
recalling a situation in which

the inmates complained the
female teachers had eschewed
the wearing of skirts and
make-up, out of a fear of arr
ousing them. "You'll find
they're pretty conservative;
things can get pretty comical,"
Priddy said.

Poxon claims the initial mis
trust and fear of the situation
has disappeared from her
sociology class. A close rapport
and an informal "rap" struc
ture has taken its place.
Although she is the
"teacher," Poxon said she feels
the average student will learn
far more than he or she will
ever be able to impart to the
inmates.

prised by the inmates and un-

pleasantly surprised by "the
system that they bear the brunt
of."
"Like most Stanford stu
dents, I came with a lot of pre
conceptions of what a har
dened criminal' was. People
still ask me what they look like!
"A lot of these preconcep
tions have been completely
shattered," she said.
Priddy, herself the leader of
a Sunday night "rap session,"
says one of the biggest dis
coveries awaiting the student is
the imagination, enthusiasm,
and sense of humor typically
displayed in the discussions.

"Humor is the survival
mechanism of the inmate,"
Priddy said.
"Without it, he would never
make it."
Trust
A sense of humor is essential
to the student too, she says,
recalling a situation in which

the inmates complained the
female teachers had eschewed
the wearing of skirts and
make-up, out of a fear of arr
ousing them. "You'll find
they're pretty conservative;
things can get pretty comical,"
Priddy said.

Poxon claims the initial mis
trust and fear of the situation
has disappeared from her
sociology class. A close rapport
and an informal "rap" struc
ture has taken its place.
Although she is the
"teacher," Poxon said she feels
the average student will learn
far more than he or she will
ever be able to impart to the
inmates.
"I feel so naive next to their
street-wisdom," she said.
"What they know instinctively,
we intellectualize. There's so
much creativity and potential
there that sometimes I just

want to say 'Goddammit, why
are you here?' "
College credit
Poxon, who began her
academic career as a com
munication major, knew very
little about sociology when she
began her project. Now she's
changed both her major and
her career plans to sociology
and criminal justice reform.
"All in all, it's been the most
educational process I've ever
been through," she said.
Future plans for the educa
tional program include arrang
ing college credit for participat
ing inmates (via Foothill junior

College), a drive to supply in
mates with newspapers (they
receive none now) and a
course for inmates on how to
use their own Law Library ef
fectively.
Students interested in these
projects or any other criminal
justice-related activities,
should contact Osborne at the
PIC headquarters.
"They're your peer group,
not mine," says Priddy to stu
dents. "These men average be
tween 18 and 26 years of age.
Just why do you think they're
incarcerated while you're
going to school?"

For those students who feel
constrained in Stanford's "iv
ory (and red-tiled) tower," the
Prison Information Center
(PIC) in the Old Firehouse, may
provide a ticket to freedom.
Legal or social research,
teaching or tutoring at the local
jail, writing a bill for the
California State Legislature on
prisoner re-entry or simply
volunteering to improve the
local jail library may provide an
interesting pasttime for stu
dents here.
The PIC provides the re
search materials and contacts
with the North County Jail in
Palo Alto.
The center, which is viewed
by director Carol Osborne as
furnishing "an alternative to
the classroom in the area of

criminal justice," was started
some 10 years ago, and was
originally oriented towards
prison reform.
Since then, according to
Community Consultant Louisa
Priddy, it has become steadily
de-politicized and broadened
to reflect the more diverse in
terests of Stanford in the '70s.
Scary
Lately the center has had
some ciifficulty in attracting
students, says Osborne
"They see the word prison
and they walk away like we
were poison."
Currently the PIC sponsors
approximately 10 student pro
jects.
Past and present projects in
clude research on juvenile de
liquency, the publication of
the Inmate Coalition News
paper and doing legal research
for prisoners throughout
California who have out-dated
or poorly stocked law libraries.
Student participants in PIC
have ranged from law students
to undergraduate art students,
one of which currently teaches
fine arts at the North County
Jail.
"The only requirement for
students is that they have a

positive attitude and really
care," Priddy said.
Most projects are developed
by t,he individual, with the PIC
providing the more concrete
items, such as office space, re
search materials, community
contacts, clerical assistance
and funding or credit where
possible.
For those students who feel
unsure about designing their
own projects or who don't
wish to work independently,
the PIC also serves as a liason
to established community or
ganizations, such as the
Friends Outside.
Education program
The most successful prog
ram the PIC sponsors is the
education program at North
County jail, according to Os
borne. It is also the only one of

it's kind in the nation, she ad
ded.
Under the program students
lead weekly classes for two to
15 inmates in the area of their
choice.
The classes taught thus far
have included sociology, art
and journalism. The journalism
class spawned the state-wide
Inmate Coalition Newspaper.
The program also encour
ages students to tutor inmates
on a one-to-one basis.
The North County Jail, just
minutes from the campus, is an
all-male maximum security in
stitution with a capacity of 63.
The size of the facility,
coupled with the "very suppor
tive" attitude of the director
towards the education prog
ram provides an ideal climate
for student-inmate interaction.
"As jails go," says Priddy,
"North County is a better jail."
Just the same, the average
Stanford student is apt to be a
little shocked at what he or she
encounters, Priddy said.
Bare
"The classroom the students
teach in is just a converted cell
— a cell without bunks. It's a
tiny, bare-walled, stuffy place.
You are working with almost

no facilities. It's just you, the
bare walls, a few shelves that
are called the "Law Library,"
some metal chairs and a
toilet."
