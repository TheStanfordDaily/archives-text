# Judge denounces escape; sends Knievel back to jail
## 
### 
Santa Monica (AP) â€” De
nouncing Evel Knievel as a
coward, a judge yesterday or
dered that the motorcycle
stunt man be required to serve
every day of his six-month jail
sentence behind bars.
Superior Court judge Ed
ward Rafeedie, expressing
open anger at Knievel's "show
business stunts and PR pipe
dreams," stared across the
courtroom at Knievel and said:
"You are in jail, sir.
"You are not Evel Knievel,
daredevil. You are Robert C.
Knievel, an inmate. . . . Do
your time. Do it with dignity.
Obey the rules, and you'll get
out."
Rafeedie ordered the county
Parole Board not to release
Knievel before he has served
the full six months of his sen
tence. The ruling came at the
end of a sometimes chaotic
hearing in which Knievel vol
unteered to take a lie detector
test to prove he never intended
to escape when he returned to

jail late from his work furlough.
The hearing grew out of
Knievel's tardiness )an. 7 in re
turning to jail from his regular
work furlough. Some jail offi
cials interpreted the five-hour
absence as an escape attempt
and issued an all-points bulle
tin for Knievel's arrest, but the
district attorney's office de
clined to charge him with es
cape.
Knievel himself said he never
meant to escape but only to
straighten out personal prob
lems stemming from a televi
sion gossip commentator's re
port that he was seeing a
woman other than his wife dur
ing his furloughs.
The district attorney's office
sought yesterday's hearing in
an effort to have Knievel's pro
bation revoked, a step that
could have placed him behind
bars for the maximum prison
sentence for assault.
But Rafeedie declined to re
voke the three-year probation
and, accusing the district at

torney's office of "a classic
case of buck passing," refused
to specifically rule on whether
Knievel had escaped.
Rafeedie told the district at
torney to decide if litigation
was necessary on the escape
question, ordered the county
Parole Board not to grant
Knievel early release and re
commended that the county
Probation Department not re
turn him to work furlough.
He said he felt the county
Probation Department should
have removed Knievel from a
work furlough program long
before the escape issue arose.
He said such stunts as lining
up limousines in front of the
prison "serves to inflame the
public and discredit a program
in which thousands of men
have served with dignity."
The judge said Knievel had
improperly tried to portray his
assault with a baseball bat on
his former manager as "the act
of a heroic avenger."
