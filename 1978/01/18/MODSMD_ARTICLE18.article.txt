# California bars face rising tide of lawsuits
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — A California Sup
reme Court decision this week has un
derscored a growing problem for bars
and other businesses serving liquor:
the danger of a crushing lawsuit.
The high court overturned a lower
court's dismissal of a suit stemming
from the alcohol poisoning death of a
young bowling alley customer.
Christopher Ewing's family filed suit
in 1971 against the Cloverleaf Bowl in
Fremont seeking a million dollars in
damages and claiming that its barten
der had been negligent in serving
Ewing 10 straight shots of 151 proof
rum, a vodka collins and two beer chas
ers in less than 90 minutes.
Don Hillman, the Cloverleaf Bowl's
manager, said the bartender and the
cocktail waitress both warned Ewing of
the drinks' potency.
"But he continued to drink anyway.
This was not disputed in court," Hill
man said in a telephone interview.
Judicial toughening
The high court's decision represents
a toughening of judicial policy in this
area, Hillman said. "Betore, if you con
tributed through your own negligence
by consuming a damaging amount of
alcoholic beverages, it barred you from
any recovery from me," he said. "Now,
regardless of your negligence, I am still
liable."
The court, in overturning the earlier
decision of the Alameda County
Superior Court in the case, ruled that
the trial jury should have been allowed
to consider whether the Cloverleaf
Bowl's bartender was negligent in serv

ing Ewing such a large quantity of al
cohol in so short a time.
Instead, the high court noted, the
lower court had proceeded under the
legal concept that a patron suffering in
juries from his own intoxication cannot
recover damages from a bartender, no
matter how negligent or reckless the
bartender's conduct may have been.
In California, as in other states, it is
illegal to serve liquor to somebody who
is already drunk.
"The financial threat to a bar serving
an obviously intoxicated person is very
weighty, and is one reason why bars
have become so cautious lately,"
California Deputy Attorney General
Richard Radosh noted.
Court rulings
He added that court rulings have
clearly established the precedent that a
bar owner may be held liable to third
parties injured by intoxicated persons
served too much to drink.
One of the most celebrated cases,
Radosh recalled, involved actor lames
Stacy, who lost an arm and a leg when a
car struck his motorcycle in Sept. 1973,
injuring him and killing his female pas
senger.
Stacy sued the owners of the bar
where drinks were served to the driver
who struck him, and he was awarded
$1.9 million in May 1976 by a Los
Angeles Superior Court jury. His pas
senger's family was awarded $400,000.
In another case, Radosh said, an ap
pellate court rejected the damage
claims of the heirs of an alcoholic when

they filed a wrongful death action
against a bar.
Pinpoint blame
It is difficult, if not impossible, to
pinpoint the blame on a single drinking
place for years of alcohol abuse which
ultimately prove fatal. But alcohol itself
usually is not hard to determine as a
cause of death, according to Dr. Ernest
Criesemer, a toxicologist with the Los
Angeles County Coroners' Office.
For example, he said, diagnosing al
cohol poisoning is simple: "If there's
over 0.4 percent alcohol in the blood
then it's pretty obvious."
Furthermore, he said, "Cirrhosis of
the liver is easy to diagnose, because
you get all this replacement of normal
liver tissue with fat cells. This can be
seen readily without much study, and
can easily be confirmed with micros
copic study."
jim Scarborough, who claims to have
instructed more than 100,000 budding
bartenders over the past 41 years at the
Major School of Bartending in
downtown Los Angeles, said he's al
ways careful to stress the legal dangers
of the profession.
Pitfall
One particular pitfall, he noted, is
that authorities tend to concentrate on
where a person they arrest downed his
last drink.
"I don't care if they've been to 15
previous bars, it's where they had their
last drink," Scarborough said. "At the
time of a person's arrest, he's asked,
where did you have your last drink of

intoxicating beverage?"
The first and second offenses of serv
ing an intoxicated person will bring
warning letters from the state Alcoholic
Beverage Control Department, Scar
borough explained. "If it happens a
third time, the ABC visits the bar and
personally warns them you can have a
suspension of your license for repeated
offenses."
Some drunks are easy to spot, Scar
borough noted, but others are talented
at concealing their intoxication. "This is
an extremely grey area for people, be
cause even a medical doctor cannot say
if you're intoxicated in many cases un
less he takes a blood sample."
Alcohol needed
The amount of alcohol needed to in
duce drunkenness varies widely among
individuals, he added. "How many
drinks will make you intoxicated? With
some people it only takes one, with
some others it might take 10. I've seen
people drink 10 martinis in a bar and
walk out of there straight as a judge."
Another problem, Scarborough con
tinued, is that bartenders often don't
have the time to carefully observe and
analyze the conditions of individual
customers. "On a busy riight, serving
several hundred people, it's extremely
hard to tell. Your bartender may have 20
customers up there screaming for
drinks, and let it slip by."
He observed that suits against bars
seem to be increasing, but added,
"Maybe that's just because everybody
seems quicker to sue these days."

against a bar.
Pinpoint blame
It is difficult, if not impossible, to
pinpoint the blame on a single drinking
place for years of alcohol abuse which
ultimately prove fatal. But alcohol itself
usually is not hard to determine as a
cause of death, according to Dr. Ernest
Criesemer, a toxicologist with the Los
Angeles County Coroners' Office.
For example, he said, diagnosing al
cohol poisoning is simple: "If there's
over 0.4 percent alcohol in the blood
then it's pretty obvious."
Furthermore, he said, "Cirrhosis of
the liver is easy to diagnose, because
you get all this replacement of normal
liver tissue with fat cells. This can be
seen readily without much study, and
can easily be confirmed with micros
copic study."
jim Scarborough, who claims to have
instructed more than 100,000 budding
bartenders over the past 41 years at the
Major School of Bartending in
downtown Los Angeles, said he's al
ways careful to stress the legal dangers
of the profession.
Pitfall
One particular pitfall, he noted, is
that authorities tend to concentrate on
where a person they arrest downed his
last drink.
"I don't care if they've been to 15
previous bars, it's where they had their
last drink," Scarborough said. "At the
time of a person's arrest, he's asked,
where did you have your last drink of

intoxicating beverage?"
The first and second offenses of serv
ing an intoxicated person will bring
warning letters from the state Alcoholic
Beverage Control Department, Scar
borough explained. "If it happens a
third time, the ABC visits the bar and
personally warns them you can have a
suspension of your license for repeated
offenses."
Some drunks are easy to spot, Scar
borough noted, but others are talented
at concealing their intoxication. "This is
an extremely grey area for people, be
cause even a medical doctor cannot say
if you're intoxicated in many cases un
less he takes a blood sample."
Alcohol needed
The amount of alcohol needed to in
duce drunkenness varies widely among
individuals, he added. "How many
drinks will make you intoxicated? With
some people it only takes one, with
some others it might take 10. I've seen
people drink 10 martinis in a bar and
walk out of there straight as a judge."
Another problem, Scarborough con
tinued, is that bartenders often don't
have the time to carefully observe and
analyze the conditions of individual
customers. "On a busy riight, serving
several hundred people, it's extremely
hard to tell. Your bartender may have 20
customers up there screaming for
drinks, and let it slip by."
He observed that suits against bars
seem to be increasing, but added,
"Maybe that's just because everybody
seems quicker to sue these days."
Los Angeles (AP) — A California Sup
reme Court decision this week has un
derscored a growing problem for bars
and other businesses serving liquor:
the danger of a crushing lawsuit.
The high court overturned a lower
court's dismissal of a suit stemming
from the alcohol poisoning death of a
young bowling alley customer.
Christopher Ewing's family filed suit
in 1971 against the Cloverleaf Bowl in
Fremont seeking a million dollars in
damages and claiming that its barten
der had been negligent in serving
Ewing 10 straight shots of 151 proof
rum, a vodka collins and two beer chas
ers in less than 90 minutes.
Don Hillman, the Cloverleaf Bowl's
manager, said the bartender and the
cocktail waitress both warned Ewing of
the drinks' potency.
"But he continued to drink anyway.
This was not disputed in court," Hill
man said in a telephone interview.
Judicial toughening
The high court's decision represents
a toughening of judicial policy in this
area, Hillman said. "Betore, if you con
tributed through your own negligence
by consuming a damaging amount of
alcoholic beverages, it barred you from
any recovery from me," he said. "Now,
regardless of your negligence, I am still
liable."
The court, in overturning the earlier
decision of the Alameda County
Superior Court in the case, ruled that
the trial jury should have been allowed
to consider whether the Cloverleaf
Bowl's bartender was negligent in serv

ing Ewing such a large quantity of al
cohol in so short a time.
Instead, the high court noted, the
lower court had proceeded under the
legal concept that a patron suffering in
juries from his own intoxication cannot
recover damages from a bartender, no
matter how negligent or reckless the
bartender's conduct may have been.
In California, as in other states, it is
illegal to serve liquor to somebody who
is already drunk.
"The financial threat to a bar serving
an obviously intoxicated person is very
weighty, and is one reason why bars
have become so cautious lately,"
California Deputy Attorney General
Richard Radosh noted.
Court rulings
He added that court rulings have
clearly established the precedent that a
bar owner may be held liable to third
parties injured by intoxicated persons
served too much to drink.
One of the most celebrated cases,
Radosh recalled, involved actor lames
Stacy, who lost an arm and a leg when a
car struck his motorcycle in Sept. 1973,
injuring him and killing his female pas
senger.
Stacy sued the owners of the bar
where drinks were served to the driver
who struck him, and he was awarded
$1.9 million in May 1976 by a Los
Angeles Superior Court jury. His pas
senger's family was awarded $400,000.
In another case, Radosh said, an ap
pellate court rejected the damage
claims of the heirs of an alcoholic when

they filed a wrongful death action
against a bar.

reme Court decision this week has un
derscored a growing problem for bars
and other businesses serving liquor:
the danger of a crushing lawsuit.
The high court overturned a lower
court's dismissal of a suit stemming
from the alcohol poisoning death of a
young bowling alley customer.
Christopher Ewing's family filed suit
in 1971 against the Cloverleaf Bowl in
Fremont seeking a million dollars in
damages and claiming that its barten
der had been negligent in serving
Ewing 10 straight shots of 151 proof
rum, a vodka collins and two beer chas
ers in less than 90 minutes.
Don Hillman, the Cloverleaf Bowl's
manager, said the bartender and the
cocktail waitress both warned Ewing of
the drinks' potency.
"But he continued to drink anyway.
This was not disputed in court," Hill
man said in a telephone interview.
Judicial toughening
The high court's decision represents
a toughening of judicial policy in this
area, Hillman said. "Betore, if you con
tributed through your own negligence
by consuming a damaging amount of
alcoholic beverages, it barred you from
any recovery from me," he said. "Now,
regardless of your negligence, I am still
liable."
The court, in overturning the earlier
decision of the Alameda County
Superior Court in the case, ruled that
the trial jury should have been allowed
to consider whether the Cloverleaf
Bowl's bartender was negligent in serv

ing Ewing such a large quantity of al
cohol in so short a time.
Instead, the high court noted, the
lower court had proceeded under the
legal concept that a patron suffering in
juries from his own intoxication cannot
recover damages from a bartender, no
matter how negligent or reckless the
bartender's conduct may have been.
In California, as in other states, it is
illegal to serve liquor to somebody who
is already drunk.
"The financial threat to a bar serving
an obviously intoxicated person is very
weighty, and is one reason why bars
have become so cautious lately,"
California Deputy Attorney General
Richard Radosh noted.
Court rulings
He added that court rulings have
clearly established the precedent that a
bar owner may be held liable to third
parties injured by intoxicated persons
served too much to drink.
One of the most celebrated cases,
Radosh recalled, involved actor lames
Stacy, who lost an arm and a leg when a
car struck his motorcycle in Sept. 1973,
injuring him and killing his female pas
senger.
Stacy sued the owners of the bar
where drinks were served to the driver
who struck him, and he was awarded
$1.9 million in May 1976 by a Los
Angeles Superior Court jury. His pas
senger's family was awarded $400,000.
In another case, Radosh said, an ap
pellate court rejected the damage
claims of the heirs of an alcoholic when

they filed a wrongful death action
against a bar.
Pinpoint blame
It is difficult, if not impossible, to
pinpoint the blame on a single drinking
place for years of alcohol abuse which
ultimately prove fatal. But alcohol itself
usually is not hard to determine as a
cause of death, according to Dr. Ernest
Criesemer, a toxicologist with the Los
Angeles County Coroners' Office.
For example, he said, diagnosing al
cohol poisoning is simple: "If there's
over 0.4 percent alcohol in the blood
then it's pretty obvious."
Furthermore, he said, "Cirrhosis of
the liver is easy to diagnose, because
you get all this replacement of normal
liver tissue with fat cells. This can be
seen readily without much study, and
can easily be confirmed with micros
copic study."
jim Scarborough, who claims to have
instructed more than 100,000 budding
bartenders over the past 41 years at the
Major School of Bartending in
downtown Los Angeles, said he's al
ways careful to stress the legal dangers
of the profession.
Pitfall
One particular pitfall, he noted, is
that authorities tend to concentrate on
where a person they arrest downed his
last drink.
"I don't care if they've been to 15
previous bars, it's where they had their
last drink," Scarborough said. "At the
time of a person's arrest, he's asked,
where did you have your last drink of

intoxicating beverage?"
The first and second offenses of serv
ing an intoxicated person will bring
warning letters from the state Alcoholic
Beverage Control Department, Scar
borough explained. "If it happens a
third time, the ABC visits the bar and
personally warns them you can have a
suspension of your license for repeated
offenses."
Some drunks are easy to spot, Scar
borough noted, but others are talented
at concealing their intoxication. "This is
an extremely grey area for people, be
cause even a medical doctor cannot say
if you're intoxicated in many cases un
less he takes a blood sample."
Alcohol needed
The amount of alcohol needed to in
duce drunkenness varies widely among
individuals, he added. "How many
drinks will make you intoxicated? With
some people it only takes one, with
some others it might take 10. I've seen
people drink 10 martinis in a bar and
walk out of there straight as a judge."
Another problem, Scarborough con
tinued, is that bartenders often don't
have the time to carefully observe and
analyze the conditions of individual
customers. "On a busy riight, serving
several hundred people, it's extremely
hard to tell. Your bartender may have 20
customers up there screaming for
drinks, and let it slip by."
He observed that suits against bars
seem to be increasing, but added,
"Maybe that's just because everybody
seems quicker to sue these days."
