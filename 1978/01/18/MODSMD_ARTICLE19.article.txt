# Cranston urges normal relations with China

### 
Washington (AP) — Senate Majority
Whip Alan Cranston urged the United
States yesterday to normalize relations
with the People's Republic of China "as
soon as possible" along lines suggested by
the Chinese.
Cranston, who led a 10-member con
gressional delegation on a four-city tour of
China, said he doesn't believe that Peking
will try to take Taiwan by force if the Un
ited States renounces a mutual defense
treaty in effect since 1954.
The California Democrat, declaring that
he feels more urgently about the need to
set up diplomatic ties with China because
of his trip, said, "i feel we should do so
swiftly, that we should recognize the ab
surdity of maintaining our relationship
with Taiwan on the grounds it is the gov
ernment of all China. Clearly, it is
not. . .
Cranston noted the terms outlined by
Peking for normalized relations: an end to
U.S.-Taiwanese diplomatic relations al
though trade and cultural ties could con
tinue; an end to the mutual U.S.-
Taiwanese defense treaty and withdrawal
of U.S. military personnel from the island
off the Asian mainland.

"I think we should proceed on those
termsas soon as possible," Cranston said.
Defense treaty
He noted that renouncing the mutual
defense treaty would eliminate a legal ob
ligation for the United States to intervene
if Peking moves militarily against Taiwan. It
would not preclude such a move, how
ever, if the United States decided one
were necessary.
Cranston said he discussed his views
with President Jimmy Carter on Monday
aboard the plane carrying Carter back to
Washington from Minnesota, where he at
tended funeral services for Hubert Hum
phrey. Carter "didn't comment," he said.
United States policy, as set out in the
Shanghai Communique signed at the end
of President Richard Nixon's trip to China
in 1972, favors eventual normalization in
diplomatic relations. But the question of
Taiwan has been the main stumbling
block.
Cranston declined to say precisely how
soon he thinks the United States can move
toward normalized relations with Peking.
"I doubt that practically it can be done this
year," he said, especially in view of ad
ministration foreign policy concerns with

the Panama Canal treaties and strategic
arms limitation talks with the Soviet Un
ion.
Not fearful
But he also said he was not fearful that
the issue would be politically damaging if
it were raised in advance of the 1980 presi
dential elections. "I think there will be
some uproar and then when China doesn't
make an immediate grab for Taiwan it will
die down," he said.
With Cranston in China for a 14-day trip
that ended a day early because of Hum
phrey's death were Sens. Charles Mathias
(R-Md.), )ames Abourezk (D-S.D.), Gary
Hart (D-Colo.), and Richard Lugar (R-lnd.)
and Reps. Charles Whalen (R-Ohio),
lames Weaver (D-Ore.), Stephen Neal
(D-N.C.), Fred Richmond (D-N.Y.) and
Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y.).
The group traveled to Peking, Shanghai,
Nanking and Canton, touring numerous
facilities as well as holding discussions
with several Chinese officials.
Cranston said he found among Chinese
leaders a "discouraging acceptance of the
inevitably of war" because of differences
between the United States and Russia.

Shanghai Communique signed at the end
of President Richard Nixon's trip to China
in 1972, favors eventual normalization in
diplomatic relations. But the question of
Taiwan has been the main stumbling
block.
Cranston declined to say precisely how
soon he thinks the United States can move
toward normalized relations with Peking.
"I doubt that practically it can be done this
year," he said, especially in view of ad
ministration foreign policy concerns with

the Panama Canal treaties and strategic
arms limitation talks with the Soviet Un
ion.
Not fearful
But he also said he was not fearful that
the issue would be politically damaging if
it were raised in advance of the 1980 presi
dential elections. "I think there will be
some uproar and then when China doesn't
make an immediate grab for Taiwan it will
die down," he said.
With Cranston in China for a 14-day trip
that ended a day early because of Hum
phrey's death were Sens. Charles Mathias
(R-Md.), )ames Abourezk (D-S.D.), Gary
Hart (D-Colo.), and Richard Lugar (R-lnd.)
and Reps. Charles Whalen (R-Ohio),
lames Weaver (D-Ore.), Stephen Neal
(D-N.C.), Fred Richmond (D-N.Y.) and
Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y.).
The group traveled to Peking, Shanghai,
Nanking and Canton, touring numerous
facilities as well as holding discussions
with several Chinese officials.
Cranston said he found among Chinese
leaders a "discouraging acceptance of the
inevitably of war" because of differences
between the United States and Russia.
Washington (AP) — Senate Majority
Whip Alan Cranston urged the United
States yesterday to normalize relations
with the People's Republic of China "as
soon as possible" along lines suggested by
the Chinese.
Cranston, who led a 10-member con
gressional delegation on a four-city tour of
China, said he doesn't believe that Peking
will try to take Taiwan by force if the Un
ited States renounces a mutual defense
treaty in effect since 1954.
The California Democrat, declaring that
he feels more urgently about the need to
set up diplomatic ties with China because
of his trip, said, "i feel we should do so
swiftly, that we should recognize the ab
surdity of maintaining our relationship
with Taiwan on the grounds it is the gov
ernment of all China. Clearly, it is
not. . .
Cranston noted the terms outlined by
Peking for normalized relations: an end to
U.S.-Taiwanese diplomatic relations al
though trade and cultural ties could con
tinue; an end to the mutual U.S.-
Taiwanese defense treaty and withdrawal
of U.S. military personnel from the island
off the Asian mainland.

"I think we should proceed on those
termsas soon as possible," Cranston said.
Defense treaty
He noted that renouncing the mutual
defense treaty would eliminate a legal ob
ligation for the United States to intervene
if Peking moves militarily against Taiwan. It
would not preclude such a move, how
ever, if the United States decided one
were necessary.
Cranston said he discussed his views
with President Jimmy Carter on Monday
aboard the plane carrying Carter back to
Washington from Minnesota, where he at
tended funeral services for Hubert Hum
phrey. Carter "didn't comment," he said.
