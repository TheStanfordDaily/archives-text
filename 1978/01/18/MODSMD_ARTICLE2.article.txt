Washington — Oral arguments
over the constitutionality of the 1971
Palo Alto Police search of the Daily's
offices were heard in the Supreme
Court yesterday.
On April 12, 1971, police, armed
with a search warrant, ransacked the
Daily's offices looking for photo
graphs of demonstrators. Attorneys,
prompted by frequent questions by
the justices at yesterday's hearing,
argued the First and Fourth Amend
ment aspects of the case and the
question of fees for the Daily's attor
neys.
The case, known as Stanford Daily
v. Zurcher, was first heard by Federal
District Court )udge Robert Pec
kham. In his October 1972 decision,
Peckham ruled the search uncon
stitutional and set strict criteria for
issuance of search warrants against
newspapers and against other "third
parties" — those not suspected of a
crime.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Ap
peals unanimously upheld Peckham
last February.
Ruling
Peckham ruled that police should
have used a subpoena to attempt to
obtain the evidence rather than a
search warrant. The warrant gave the
Daily no chance to contest its validity
in court, whereas the Daily could
have moved to quash a subpoena.
Peckham's criteria were the focus
of many of the justices' questions.
Daily attorney Jerome Falk )r. con
ceded that Peckham's ruling, which
applied to all third parties, was pos
sibly too broad. Chief justice Warren
Burger and justices William Re
hnquist and Harry Blackmun posed
several hypothetical situations for

Falk to test the validity of the Daily's
arguments.
Rhenquist asked whether a person
engaging in scholarly activities inves
tigating the government and who
took photographs of a crime would
get the same first amendment pro
tection as the Daily. Falk answered
that he would need more informa
tion to give a definite answer.
Clergyman?
Blackmun interjected a question:
would a clergyman taking photo
graphs in preparation for a sermon
also receive First Amendment pro
tections?
After Burger added that clergymen
are engaged in First Amendment ac
tivities every Sunday, Falk attempted
to distinguish the Daily's case by the
injury done to the newsgathering
process.
Because of the search, Falk ar
gued, the Daily was never given a
chance to be heard in court to con
test turning over the photographs.
He further argued that other mate
rials, including confidential informa
tion, were seen by police and that the
newsroom was disrupted.
The same issues had been addres
sed minutes earlier when Eric Col
lins, deputy California attorney gen
eral, argued the case for the defen
dants. Collins had begun with a
lengthy presentation of the facts sur
rounding the April 9, 1971 melee at
Stanford Hospital of which the police
sought photographs, justice Thur
good Marshall attempted to focus
the argument:
"I just think the (sobpoena) duces
tecum should do it, not a search war
rant. Then therecould bea motion to
quash, and everybody would have
his day in court," Marshall observed.
Marshall then asked what the state

would have done if the Daily had de
stroyed photographs immediately
after taking them. Collins responded
that it is "our hope that the Daily
would not set a precedent for the rest
of the media."
Much of the 65-minute hearing
centered on the First Amendment
aspects of the case.
Falk said the Daily was concerned
with the First Amendment overtones
of the case while the police and iaw
enforcement officials who appealed
the case perceived the lower court
ruling as dealing only with Fourth
Amendment questions surrounding
third-party searches.
lustices Rehnquist and Byron
White asked how the police officers
who were to follow the ruling could
differentiate suspects from nonsus
pects. Rehnquist asked if the Daily
would be considered a suspect if it
were believed that there were 500
pounds of marijuana on the Daily's
premises. Falk responded that no
one could be a nonsuspect if he or
she possessed marijuana.
Following more questions from
White and Marshall on how police
officers could follow the ruling, Falk
concluded by saying that the Daily
did not seek a specific press
privilege, but rather was concerned
with whether information was ob
tained by search warrant or sub
poena.
Falk said the Daily was seeking
only a procedural right — that of
using a subpoena over a search war
rant — rather than a "substantive
right."
Rehnquist had asked Falk why
newspapers should receive special
privileges not afforded to other
businesses, such as banks, which
keep confidential records. Burger
pointed out that others "have First
Amendment rights too." But Mar
shall interjected that if any bank suf
fered a 15-minute search as the Daily
did it would result in "chaos plus."
Falk explained to the court that the
Daily's photo policy was generated
by a fear that photo files would be
exploited and it was in an attempt to
avoid that that the Daily made an an
nouncement "don't subpoena us."
Burger asked Collins if the high
court should consider the Daily's
photo policy even though police had
not mentioned it to the judge who
issued the warrant.
Collins responded that even
though the judge was never told a
subpoena would be impractical, the
Daily had a policy to destroy such
photographs and that the Daily later
amended this policy to say it would
destroy "all potentially incriminat
ing" photographs.
When Justice Lewis Powell asked if
the Daily would destroy photographs
of a person robbing a bank or assas
sinating john Kennedy, Falk said that
if the Daily policy was read literally,
