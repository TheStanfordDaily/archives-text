# Fall 68-43 to Southwest power
## Arizona downs swimmers 
### Andy Lowe 
Unable to score points in
either diving or relay events,
Stanford fell to a fast University
of Arizona swim team, 68-43
yesterday in deGuerre Pool.
Stanford coach Jim Caug
hran, however, was optimistic
about his team's progress, not
ing "Given the amount of yar
dage currently being swum,
the weather, and Stu's (Corliss)
temporary illness, I feel our
team performed well. There
were many encouraging come
from behind swims, a few na
tional standards were made,
and we had some good relay
swims."
Junior Mike Bruner, gold
medalist in the 200 meter but
terfly and 800 meter freestyle

relay of the Montreal Olym
pics, displayed his versatility
winning three events. Posting
what likely is the fastest time in
the nation this season, Bruner
swam an incredible 1:48.8
200 yard butterfly, eclipsing his
own pool record of 1:48.96.
Few will question his ex
pected first place finish at the
NCAA Championships in
March, where he will return to
defend his title. The Stockton
resident also won the 500 yard
freestyle, stroking to a 4:29.4,
well below the national qualify
ing standard, and the 200 yard
freestyle (1:41.1).
Jon Powell, another consis
tent winner for Stanford, re
mained undefeated this season
in the 100 yard freestyle, easily

capturing the race with an im
pressive 46.4. A slow start pre
vented a first place finish in the
50 yard free, however, as Pow
ell lost a close race to one of
the premiere sprinters in the
collegiate ranks, Steve Wyatt.
Many near upsets kept the
meet interesting for on
looking competitors and spec
tators. Bill Chao hung with
Olympian Rick DeMont for 150
yards of the2oo yard individual
medley but fell just short when
DeMont used his sprinting
ability to take the race in the
final 50 yards.
Other notable swims in
cluded Jack Connelly's duel
with Ken DeMont in the 200
backstroke (1:57.8), Rob
Weber's race with National
Junior College record holder
Lance Michaelis in the 200
breaststroke (2:11.1), and
Monte Brown's 1000 yard free,
in which he overtook Arizona's
Supple on the final lap.
Coach Caughran was also
pleased with Sam Franklin's
46.9 freestyle relay leg, Bob
Hagberg's 50.8 medley relay
split, Ken Shilling's 200 I.M.
(1:59.6), and Ted Knapp's 100
and 200 yard freestyle times.
Thursday afternoon, at 2
p.m., the men's team will host
Long Beach State, whose vastly
improved team includes
Olympian, former world re
cord holder, and NCAA winner
of the 500 yard freestyle in 1976
and 1977, Tim Shaw.
Greg Jagenberg, for several
seasons one of the foremost
butterfly swimmers in the
world, will undoubtedly give
Stanford's relays and flyers
outstanding races. Finally,
Long Beach State's coach Dick
Jochums will count on Bob
Jackson, a bronze medalist at
Montreal, who is expected to
place high among the nation's
backstrokers at the NCAA
Championships, which Long
Beach will host on March 23-25.
