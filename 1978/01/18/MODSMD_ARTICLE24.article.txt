# No home rink for Card icemen
## Hockey team hits the ice 
### 
Ice hockey in balmy California?
You'd better believe it. The Stanford hoc
key team begins its 1978 season this
weekend at Squaw Valley in a tournament
thai includes San Diego State and Brigham
Young.
Last season the Cards were 8-2-1 and the
icemen are hopeful of another successful
season this winter. After annihilating USC,
19-6, before a home crowd in the season
opener last year, Stanford went on to beat
the Northridge All-Stars, UCLA, San Diego
State and California. A semi-pro team from
Sacramento handed the Cardinals their only
setbacks.
While the team is highly competitive, the
icemen maintain that the key to their success
in recent years has been an informal attitude
nurtured in practice and brought to fruition
after the games.
"We have a highly developed sense of
priorities on the team," said Danny Schley, a
perennial Stanford star now in his fifth sea
son with the Cards. "First we have a good
time, then we make sure we win."
The system must be a good one. Over the
last three seasons Stanford has lost only
seven of 30 games.
Player-coach Pat Baldwin, who has
coached the team since its inception, added

further light to the Stanford approach to ice
hockey.,
"I like to work on fundamentals and some
of the more basic moves, then, if I can get
the boys out of the bars, I try to teach them
some hockey," Baldwin said.
The team practices in Belmont and Burlin
game and is forced to play most of its games
on the road. Besides the trip to Squaw Val
ley, the team travels to Los Angeles, San
Diego, Sacramento, Berkeley and Colorado.
The team relies on alumni support and spe
cial events for most of its limited revenue.
Heading for Squaw Valley — the site of the
only U.S. Olympic gold medal in hockey —
will be returning lettermen Dave Lougee,
Henry Dudley, Kenny Breitenbach, team
captain Cris lames, John von Schlegell, Paul
Spaeth, Baldwin, Schley and a complement
of new players.
Hockey fans attending any of Stanford's
games this season may be surprised to see
the old Stanford Indian crest on the jerseys.
The team insists the Indians are not a polit
ical statement, but that the jerseys were
purchased from the Chicago Blackhawks in
pre-Cardinal days.
When asked why the team had not
changed to new emblems, Henry Dudley,
the team financial manager, adroitly stated,
"We can't afford 'em."
