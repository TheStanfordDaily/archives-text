# Chapel dean views S. Africa

"I do not support the divestment movement regarding South
Africa because I am not convinced that it would be a positive step
for blacks in the country," said Robert Hamerton-Kelly, dean of
the chapel, who recently returned from a three week visit in
South Africa.
Hamerton-Kelly had been on a six month sabbatical in Munich
and visited his mother and two brothers in South Africa, where he
was born. When asked about his general impressions of the
country, Hamerton-Kelly answered that he found the atmos
phere "depressing."
"The population in South Africa is 18 million — four million
whites and 14 million non-whites. The government policy is
strictly controlled and determines where blacks can work and
live. Blacks cannot vote nor can they own property, except in
designated black areas."
'Don't give a damn'
Hamerton-Kelly divided the white population into three
groups: those who "don't give a damn" about the situation,
those who are despairing and want to leave the country and those
who are fanatically in favor of the system.
"The despairing face a problem in leaving in that strict currency
controls prevent the transfer of assets outside the country. Since
my last visit to South Africa in 1972, the most striking difference I
observed was the greatly increased number of well-to-do whites
who want to leave. It's no wonder they feel unstable — rumors
circulateat cocktail parties that leading government officials keep
their money in Swiss banks," he said.
The fanatics favoring the system comprise the majority of the
white population. One woman Hamerton-Kelly met was the wife
of a Rhodesian dog breeder. Hamerton-Kelly said he thought it
must be frightening to drive a car in Rhodesia but the woman
replied it was no problem since she and her husband traveled in
an armed convoy.
"Anyone who thinks driving in an armed convoy is no problem
is a fanatic," Hamerton-Kelly said.
Bulldozing
Hamerton-Kelly also retold incidents describing black oppres
sion in South Africa.
"I was in Capetown when the government decided to bulldoze
a squatters' town," he recalled. "The weather was cold and wet,
but the government went ahead and bulldozed the homes. The
only redemption offered to the black families was a one way
ticket to the black homeland. This implied mandatory un
employment since the people living in these homes held jobs in
Capetown."
When visiting his brother's apartment in Johannesburg,
Hamerton-Kelly asked where the black men who furnished the
building's "maid service" lived. His brother took him to the top of
the building, where the penthouse would be in an American
structure.
But instead of a penthouse, the South African building had a
cell-block like structure, where the blacks lived in solitude. Iso
lated from their families, who live on reservations, these men see
their wives and children only one month out of the year,
Hamerton-Kelly said.
Separate, not equal
"In the city, hundreds of black workers stand around on the
streets at lunchtime, because they aren't permitted to eat in
restaurants. The same thing occurs in the evening. While most
blacks go home to the Bantu homelands, those who live in the
cell-block structures atop the high rises are left idle in the city."
On the issue of U.S. aid in South Africa, Hamerton-Kelly said,
"It's a question of whether or not the blacks want help. The U.S.
can collapse the economic situation, and although divestment is
supported by morally sensitive people, I'm not convinced it's the
right solution.

"Who is to decide what's best for South African blacks? Blacks?
Whites? American university theorists.? Although the collapse in
economy may help in the long run, it is the black workers who
end up paying. I am reluctant to fight to the last drop of other
people's blood.
"American theorists have a tendency to look at the long run
and ignore the immediate effects."
Freeze favored
Leaders of black trade unions are anti-divestment; they favor a
freeze on investments, Hamerton-Kelly said. Leonard Skakes
Sikhakhane, general secretary of Sweet Food and Allied Unions
in South Africa claimed, "U.S. withdrawals are murdering my
people." Working as a group, the black workers hope to create
internal unrest, and gain recognition as a result. The collapse of
industries would eliminate the possibility of a workers' union.
While Hamerton-Kelly said he believes the South African sys
tem is wrong, he doesn't know the best way to go about
correcting the improper system. "It is a problem comparable to
major surgery," he said.
Hamerton-Kelly and his associate, Ernie W.D. Young, will hold
a conference called "Spotlight on South Africa" this Friday
through Sunday at Corralitos Conference Center in the Santa
Cruz Mountains.
Young holds a different view on divestment, seeing it as the
only route for South Africa.
The weekend will feature a debate between Hamerton-Kelly
and Young, history and ideology of the situation, political experi
ence and strategies for change and religious views on just wars
and revolution.
