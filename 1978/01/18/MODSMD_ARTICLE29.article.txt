## Call to revolution 
### 
The revolution will not be tele
vised;
The revolution will not be tele
vised . . .
The revolution will not go bet
ter with Coke,
The revolution will not stop
germs that cause bad
breath,
The revolution will put you in
the driver's seat.
-Cil Scott-Heron
The stirring words are a call
to arms for people to get off
their duffs and take part in to
day's ongoing revolution, and
who could say them more
powerfully than Gil Scott-
Heron?
Scott-Heron, a musician and
poet, speaker and creative
writing teacher at Federal City
College in Washington D.C. is
set to show Stanford that the
revolution is nothing but
change and change is bound to
come.
His is the revolutionary
voice, well-known within the
black community since the late
'60s and now known in rock
circles since his hit, "The Bot
tle"— a pieceon alcoholism —
hit the charts in the early '70s.
Scott-Heron kicks off Black
Liberation Month festivities
here with a free speech tomor
row at 8 p.m. in Kresge Au
ditorium,
By keeping his finger on the
pulse of black Americans'
frustration, anger and despair,
Scott-Heron has turned out
eight albums that accurately
express these feelings with an
historic as well as update in
terpretation.
"The Revolution Will Not Be
Televised" is a fast-moving,
tongue-in-cheek piece which
plays with the countless televi
sion ads which bombard the
American minds, but more im
portantly, criticizes armchair
revolutionaries who'd rather
sit down, plug in and tune out
than participate in the change.
Other known works include
"Lady Day and |ohn Coltrane,"
"Home Is Where the Hatred
Is," "Johannesburg" and
"Pieces of a Man."
The word revolution does

not become an empty, mean
ingless scrap of '60s
memorabilia to be tucked away
between the pages of an old
yearbook tor Scott-Heron.
Neither is he shy to speak his
mind on what he considers to
be the outrages of our time
with his carefully directed lam
poons.
On the pardoning of former
President Richard Nixon after
the Watergate affair, Scott-
Heron writes in "Pardon Our
Analysis,"
"We beg your pardon
America because the pardon
you gave this time was not
yours to give.
A novelist as well as a
musician/composer, Scott-

Heron said he got into record
ing because "there are a lot of
our school children and a lot of
our adults, too, who do not
read comprehensively enough
or often enough to really enjoy
dealing with novels."
Scott-Heron met Brian
lackson at Lincoln University
and they have been perform
ing together since 1969 first as
part of a group called Black and
Blues and now in the Midnight
Band.
"We wanted him to be here
for Black Liberation Month be
cause he's the baddest guy
around," said David Smith,
Liberation Month Steering
Committee member.
