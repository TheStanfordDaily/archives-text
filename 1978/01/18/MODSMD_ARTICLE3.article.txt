# Investment motion weakened

The ASSU Senate "watered down" Sen. Don Moon
shine's resolution on Investment Responsibility last
night, passing an amended resolution with a vote of
8-5-1.
The original resolution was designed to "condemn
the actions of the trustees in as strong language as pos
sible," Moonshine said.
(Moonshine referred to the trustees' revisions in the
Ad F-loc Committee on Investment Responsibility's Re
port.)
Moonshine added that "the time has passed when we
should make any pretense at compromise. We should
make efforts to mobilize community support towards
divestment.
"I'm tired of telling the University we disagree by
replying in mild language. It's time to use strong lan
guage."
The "strong language" contained in the original re
solution included calling the final statement on Invest
ment Responsibility issued by the trustees a "document
which totally abbrogates the University's duty to exer
cise social responsibility."
Sen. George Drysdale's amended version strikes the
word "totally."
In addition, the last clause was amended to read, "the

Senate encourages non-violent action by the Stanford
community to encourage this University to exercise so
cial responsibility."
The phrase "including civil disobedience" at the end
was struck.
The resolution encountered opposition from Sen.
Tom McCormack, who called it "one of the most unwise
pieces of legislation I've seen."
McCormack added that he felt there is no need to
issue a strong statement on the senate's position, and
that the resolution was "kicking a dead horse."
Sen. Carlyle Kinnison disagreed, replying he hoped
the senate would "go on kicking the dead horse until we
kick some life into it."
Other action in the sparsely attended senate meeting
included a drawn-out discussion on the composition of
an upcoming ASSU forum. The purpose of the forum is
to explain to students the senate support of the Nomina
tion Committee's refusal to nominate students to the
new Commission on Investment Responsibility, accord
ing to ASSU Co-president Steve Westly.
Senate chairperson Fred Grethel added that the forum
would not be "to influence, but to discuss" the issue.
Grethel also called tor "more concrete legislation" for
the next senate meeting.
