Middle East peace talks open
Jerusalem — New Middle East peace talks
opened yesterday with an Egyptian demand for
"an equal house for the Palestinian people" and a
low-keyed Israeli call for "concession, com
promise and mutual agreement."
Sec retary of State Cyrus Vance, staking out the
middle ground, said the common goal of Egypt,
Israel and the United States "and those absent
today" — lordan, Syria and the Soviet Union — is a
just, lasting and comprehensive settlement.
The strongly worded statement by Egyptian
Foreign Minister Mohammed Kamel contrasted
with the Israeli call for compromise, highlighting
sharp differences between them, the legacy of the
10-year dispute.
Later, at a news conference, Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Dayan said everything is negoti
able. Every Egyptian proposal including Palesti
nian statehood would receive consideration, he
said.
"The only thing we do not accept is a kind of
ultimatum — take it or leave it.
"There is no deadlock," Dayan told reporters,
"but that doesn't mean we are all doing wonder
fully well."
Saudi leaders make money offer
Beirut, Lebanon — King Khaled and Crown Pr
ince Fahd of oil-rich Saudi Arabia have offered to
buy the West Bank of the lordan River and the
Gaza Strip from Israel to establish a Palestinian
state, an Arab publication said yesterday.
I he Saudi leaders made the offer to President
Jimmy Carter during his visit earlier this month to
Saudi Arabia, the world's leading oil exporter, ac
cording to the Middle East Reporter, a usually
well-informed daily digest of Arab affairs.
"The Saudis made it plain to the American pres
ident they are prepared to pay as much as required
to establish a homeland for ihe Palestinian nation,
even if that means buying the West Bank and Gaza
from Israel," the publication said.
It quoted Khaled and Fahd as telling Carter:
"You try to solve the Palestinian problem and we
are ready to give you all the oil you want."
In Washington, White House press secretary
Jody Powell, who attended some of the meetings
between U.S. and Saudi officials, said he was una
ware of any such offer.
Business gives more than labor
Washington For the first time in the five years
that records have been kept, business political

committees in 1977 gave more to congressional
candidates than did labor, according to a new
study by Common Cause.
Despite the limited number of elections last
year, special interest groups managed to invest
>2.4 million in the candidates of their rhoice dur
ing the first 10 months of 1977.
'For this period, corporate or trade association
political action committees contributed $987,000
to political candidates compared to $844,000 from
labor groups.
Common Cause, a citizens group that
specializes in monitoring government, also re
leased figures showing business nearly tripled its
political gifts and almost caught labor in 1976, the
last full-scale election year.
No Koreagate indictment?
Seoul, South Korea — Acting Deputy U.S. Attor
ney General Benjamin Civiletti suggested yester
day that the questioning of Tongsun Park in the
influence-peddling scandal may not result in any
indictments of present U.S. officials or members
of Congress.
Civiletti, chief U.S. interrogator of Park for four
days, told reporters, "In all likelihood, there will
be very few possible criminal cases. The few cases
that do result," he added, would apply "primarily
if not exclusively" to former officials and private
individuals.
The Justice Department official said, however,
that the testimony has been "extremely useful."
Civiletti told a news conference prior to his de
parture for Washington that news reports about
Park's testimony in Seoul were "grossly exagger
ated or widely speculative" and that there was no
evidence of "certainly criminal conduct on the
part of any vast number of people, either former
officials or present."
Heavy snow storm hits Midwest
Chicago — Hundreds of Midwest schools, fac
tories and offices were forced to close yesterday as
a storm dumped and drifted 1 Vi feet of snow be
fore heading east. Another storm brewing in the
Rockies was expected to sock the Great Plains by
nightfall.
In California, flooding rains gave way briefly to
sunshine. The Southeast had sleet and freezing
rain.
In Cairo, 111., where 15 inches of snow was
dumped overnight, one resident described the
storm this way: "It's like the floor fell out of the
sky. It's incredible."

"Just about stilled," was the way an airport
weather forecaster summed up Evansville, Ind.,
where streets were silent and public buildings
empty.
The spreading storm had reached the New York
City area by midafternoon, where National
Guardsmen and snow-clearing equipment were
waiting for what the National Weather Service said
would be a severe beating.
Carter outlines address
Washington — President )immy Carter, prepar
ing for the approaching congressional session,
said yesterday that his State of the Union address
will focus on the economy and that his immediate
goal is final action on an energy program.
His spokesman, meanwhile, predicted that Car
ter's tax plan, to be unveiled in the State of the
Union speech tomorrow night and in a tax mes
sage to Congress two days later, will be "the most
comprehensive and perhaps the most controver
sial tax reform package presented in recent ad
ministrations."
In a day spent meeting with congressional lead
ers and a group of the more junior members, Car
ter and his aides outlined his agenda for the sec
ond session of the 95th Congress, which begins
tomorrow.
Charity fund-raising investigated
Washington — The Postal Service said yesterday
it is investigating the current practices of a Roman
Catholic order whose past practices led to the
indictment of its former chief fund-raiser.
"We have an open case regarding the mail prac
tices of the Pallottine Fathers," Paul Coe, assistant
chief of the Postal Inspection Service, said in an
interview.
"We are taking a strong look at their current
campaigns to see what they are doing with the
money they are raising," Coe said.
During one 18-month period in the mid-19705,
the Pallottine Fathers of Baltimore raised $20 mill
ion with emotional appeals to help starving chil
dren abroad. An audit later showed that most of
the money went to paying for the massive direct
mail campaigns and less than 3 percent of the
money went to hungry children.
