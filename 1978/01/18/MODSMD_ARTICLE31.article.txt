# From Issaquah to the top
## Ansley elected editor 
### 
David Ansley, the bearded Don
)uan of The Stanford Daily, was
elected editor for Volume 173 last
night.
A senior communications and
political science major, Ansley
hails from Issaquah, Washington.
In the past he has served as staff
editor, features editor and copy
editor at The Daily, but is perhaps
most famous for his stint as the
author of "Under Covers," the
wildly popular column which was
Masters and Johnson, "The Sen
suous Man" and Woody Allen all
rolled into one. A resident of
Alpha Sig, he claims to be "an
apathetic liberal."
Ansley's first goal in the upcom
ing volume, which begins on
January 30, is to boost the size of
the staff at the paper. "I think this
is really the time for people who
want to make changes at The Daily
to show up and start working," he
said.
Ansley actually started work for
the newspaper before he was a
registered student, showing up
during Freshman Orientation

Week 1974 and offering to take
photos of "anything that moves."
After those pictures appeared in
print, Ansley started growing the
beard which he has kept since
then.
Last spring he held a reporting
job at The Kitsep County Herald, a

weekly in Port Orchard,
Washington. He wants to bring
his professional experience into
play as editor, saying he "hopes
the stories which will appear in
the paper in my volume will be
more likely ones which people
would like to read."
