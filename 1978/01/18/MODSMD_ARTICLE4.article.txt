# McCloskey says he will seek re-election
## 
### Craig Dennis 
Congressman Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo
Pai k) said in an interview last week that he is
yoing to run for re-election to Congress this
year and said President )immy Carter's con
gressional relations were Carter's "worst re
cord of accomplishment."
McCloskey, on campus Thursday for a de
bate over the Panama Canal treaty, said he had
"no idea" what sort of opponents he might
have when he runs for a sixth term later this
year.
But he added, "The tuna fishermen's wives
have said they will come up and campaign
against me. Ralph Nader has said he would
come into the district and campaign against me,
and a Democratic senator recently allowed to
one of Jack Anderson's people that there was
$100,000 from the maritime industry for anyone
who would run against me."
McCloskey, the senior Republican member
of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee, was instrumental in the defeat of
the Cargo Preference Act, a bill heavily lobbied
for by both the maritime industry and related
unions.
"I think I am the first member active on this
committee who has not come from a port city
and therefore hopefully has some dispassion
ate judgment about the issue rather than trying
to protect the jobs in the shipyards," he said.
Role on committee
McCloskey said his role on the committee is
as a member trying to prevent "distorted legis
lation." He said this is a trend developing in
Congress to get a "balanced view on commit
tees where work is done, and I think this is all
for the good."
Carter's ineffectiveness in communicating
with Congress was partially blamed by McClos
key for the failure of a House-Senate confer
ence committee to compromise on energy
legislation.

"He is a fast learner, though, and he is a very
intelligent man," he said in describing Carter.
"I think he is beginning to perceive that he
overlooked a very material part of being presi
dent in his first year, and what he overlooked
was that he is dealing with some very intelli
gent, very proud, almost prima donna people
in the Senate."
McCloskey added, "Hopefully, he will up
grade the standard of performance and the in
volvement and sophistication of the relatively
few people in his administration who deal with
the Congress. Thus far he has had almost a
negative record in dealing with the Congress."
McCloskey described himsel' as unsatisfied
with the energy legislation developing out of
the conference committee. "But I suppose I am
reluctantly of the view that this is all we can get
out of this country at the present time."
McCloskey said he would place strong em
phasis on cutting oil imports in half, even if it
meant sacrificing some economic growth. He
supports a gradual price rise in oil and gas, but
he said rationing "may be the ultimate neces
sity" if Congress fails to pass an adequate prog
ram.
Bigger question
Whether the president has the "guts" is a
much bigger question, McCloskey said.
"What is missing is the ability of the president
or the administration or the statesmen in Con
gress to convince the people of the United
States that we have got to reduce our consump
tion of energy. Because the people don't rec
ognize the risk and peril, you are not getting the
Congress to do what we ought to do."
McCloskey said his main questions about
Carter are in Carter's relationships with Con
gress. "I think he wants to do the right thing. He
is honest. I think on balance Carter's done a
pretty good job."
Using the current Mideast negotiations as an
example where the Carter administration is

meeting some success, he continued, "Our
posture there is essentially to create an envi
ronment to permit the various Arab factions
and the Israelis to negotiate."
McCloskey theorized that the failure of Con
gress itself to take on a strong leadership role
might be because the intelligence of its mem
bers has improved during the last decade, re
sulting in their demanding more leadership re
sponsibility and debate of the issues.
Members' caliber
"The caliber of the individual members of
Congress, their motivation, their honesty, their
idealism is very much higher today than it's
been in my 10 years in Congress," he said.
McCloskey described his 12th congressional
district as "one of the most challenging districts
in the country, because we usually have the
leadership on both sides of any issue.
"It is a tremendous district to represent," he
continued, "I think I can always be assured of
getting advice on both sides of any issue, rather
vigorous advice."
Exactly that happened at Thursday night's
Panama Canal debate when the question and
answer period was more of a commentary of
opposition to the treaty from some of his con
stituents.
"The only way you get honesty and perfor
mance out of politicians is by holding them to
account and criticizing them bitterly," McClos
key said.
Maverick Republican
Often described as a maverick Republican for
some of his liberal stands, he said, "I think any
liberal Republican is a mystery to his own party,
even in this district."
But he added, "I think thinking Republicans
will be supporting the Panama Canal treaties.
Jerry Ford is not considered a maverick Repub
lican, whatever else he might be."
