# Cooperation necessary
## Energy cause for concern 
### 
Mark McMenamin

Anyone informed about the
energy crisis cannot help but be
deeply concerned. Plots of energy
data curves extrapolated into the
near future indicate that the demand
for energy will increase almost expo
nentially, while the supply of current
energy sources will decrease stead
ily- .
It is easy to see that this relation
ship cannot go on for long, because
soon the breaking point will be
reached where either demand
drops, supply increases, or other fac
tors influence the scene. Since our
society is unwilling to give up the
benefits of technological growth and
material wealth, both of which are
dependent on energy, the first pos
sibility, decrease in energy demand,
seems unlikely.
The second possibility, of energy
supply increase, seems equally un
likely because only a finite amount of
traditional energy sources such as
oil, coal, and natural gas are available
in the earth's crust. Hence, de
velopment of other energy factors is
the final alternative to prevent stag
nation in a world that flows with pol
lution producing and increasingly
scarce fossil fuels.
Varied and sometimes conflicting
ideas have arisen proposing what
form these "other factors" should
take. In the United States, nuclear
energy is already producing a con
siderable amount of electricity, and
many would like to see atomic
energy production increased. How
ever, the development of conven
tional fission or light water reactors is
hardly a solution to the energy shor
tage because reactor uranium (U
-235) is also in seriously short supply.
Breeder reactors, which convert
more natural uranium to useful
energy than conventional reactors,
are a good example of suing high
level technology to combat the
energy shortage. Unfortunately,
though, breeder reactors are suspect
(as evidenced by President jimmy
Carter's Clinch River Project veto)
because of atomic waste safety con
siderations and because breeders
produce weapons grade plutonium
which could increase nuclear

weapon proliferation and the possi
bility of terrorist nuclear theft.
The best prospect for nuclear
energy is the fusion reactor, that
fuses atoms of light elements in a
hydrogen bomb reaction to create
large quantities of heat. But the con
trolled conversion of fusion heat to
useable energy is a technique that
must wait several or more decades
before it is practical, say fusion ex
perts, so this form of nuclear energy
will not be useable before the pro
jected terminal shortage of fossil
fuels.
Since nuclear energy is not the
short-range answer to the energy
crisis, perhaps lower technology
solutions are in order. The sun, ulti
mate source of all renewable energy,
may offer some immediate allevia
tion of household energy drains on
the fossil fuel reserve by solar space
and water heating and creation of
photovoltaic electricity with solar
cells.
Solar heating has always been re
sponsible for river flow and winds â€”
both potential energy sources. Al
though the energy gained by dam
ming rivers is becoming less
economical, wind generation of
electricity (once widely used on
midwest farms before the Depres
sion) may prove valuable in areas
with suitable winds. Other alternate
energy possibilities, some of which
are labor intensive and could create
large numbers of permanent jobs,
include conversion of garbage to
methane gas, harnessing of oceanic
tidal energy, and geothermal energy.
But the most immediate and availa
ble new energy resource is, not un
reasonably, conservation of the con
ventional fuels we use today. Setting
a realistic goal of cutting back man
kind's (and especially America's)
energy consumption by 20 per cent
would be a great help towards tiding
us over until a transformation to an
alternate energy system could be
made. Thus, a worldwide energy
panic could be averted and combina
tions of high and low technology
breakthroughs could be systemati
cally and smoothly incorporated.
Today's energy system is far from

smooth because of uneven geologic
distribution and unequal consump
tion of fossil fuels. International rela
tionships will be increasingly depen
dent on fuel supplies. The Middle
East OPEC (Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries) nations
highlighted this fact in 1973 when
their oil embargo paralyzed nations
dependent on OPEC oil. Similarly,
world harmony could be seriously
threatened if the energy supply vital
to development of Third World
countries were cut off.
Solution of the energy problem is a
question of survival and is one of the
most important problems ever to
confront mankind. Energy solutions
are being worked on here at Stanford
at many levels. The Stanford Institute
for Energy Studies consists of Stan
ford faculty members helping to
produce technological advances in
energy production. The Energy
Center concerns itself with energy
conservation on campus. The energy
situation is a clearly defined, tangible
problem that will be improved only
by the cooperation of a large number
of informed, concerned, and in
volved people.
