# Sororities to follow a new trajectory
##

Cast away your preconceptions of
sororities. Chances are your views
are tainted by selective glimpses of
the past and exaggerated "war
stories" that friends from other col
leges bring home. Stanford
sororities will follow a new trajec
tory.
Stanford offers a unique environ
ment; sorority life will be different as
well. Higher priorities than Creek
loyalty occupy most everybody's
time here. For many, fraternity life
offersa sound platform for launching
efforts toward grad school. Last

year's tests, easily-formed study
groups, and seniors fresh from the
application-interview process pro
vide apt cultivation for pledges' aspi
rations. Sororities are especially
needed now with an abundance of
positions in management and grad
schools eagerly awaiting competent
women from ruling class factories
like this one.
Success in many of these positions
often pivots on leadership skill.
Sadly, Stanford offers a meager train
ing ground, especially for women.
Student government recurrently

flounders in the quagmire of indi
vidual interest and resume-bloating.
This year's ASSU "Sin-hut" fiasco
epitomizes the situation. To compli
cate matters, the average tremend
ous ego here resents most efforts at
leadership, or at best is apathetic.
Ask any yell leader.
Somehow the stronger bonds
founded in a Creek house help as
suage this resentment. Political or
ganization plays a key role in every
fraternity. The fact that we must live
with one another induces us to re
spect the political process. (I occa
sionally wonder how much more ef
fective our ASSU senators could be if
they slept, ate and showered to
gether.) More centrally, the ever
ready patronage of a national organi
zation, combined with common ritu
als strengthen the sinews of our frat
ernal ties.
Obviously, Stanford women are
missing many valuable opportunities
to hone their management skills.
Consider these two facts: (1) Of the
nation's 50 largest corporations, 43
are headed by fraternity men; and (2)
Since the first fraternity was founded
in 1825, every U.S. president, except
two, has been a fraternity member.
Forcenturies women have subtly run
much of our socioeconomic world as
wives of powerful men. . . . Ladies,
why not take the credit directly, par
ticularly since society increasingly
demands your skills?
At many campuses across the land,
socializing revolves around the
Greek system; not so at Stanford.
More funds in the larger dorms and
newer, roomier facilities are availa
ble in much of the independent
housing. Lively street-dances on the
Row, Larkin-Serra-Donner parties,
an occasional dorm play, and
numerous sherry hours all attest to a
healthy social spirit in dorm life. The
height of contrast occurred with the

washing away of the Intra-Fraternity
Council's bonfire, followed by the
thundering success of the Big Game
Gaieties.
Vet, the overwhelming reason
sororities will follow a new trajectory
here lies in the University's tight
fisted policies. Very few fraternities
in the nation face the threat of being
sucked into University housing for
not achieving quotas arbitrarily set
by the University. Even fewer frater
nities must endure consistent hostile
attitudes by administrators. |im
Lyons, dean of student affairs, has in
committee meetings openly de
clared his feelingsagainst fraternities
as housing for subjectively-selected
students.
Additionally, Dr. Peter Bing, presi
dent of the Board of Trustees, re
cently put it, "If we had to start all
over again, we would probably not
have fraternities, let alone
sororities." Perhaps, the main
reason for strong political cohesion
within fraternities is merely the need
for efficient organization just to sur
vive.
Sororities will meet the same pres
sures to be sure, particularly with the
University's exclusive attitude to
ward national organizations. Ulti
mately, though, these same pres
sures will vitalize the future Hellenic
system by forcing efficiency and last
ing friendships to prevail, and by
winnowing the weaker, less respon
sive chapters.
Contrary to sororities of the earlier
years on the Farm, tomorrow's
sororities cannot afford to be exclu
sive. Coed dorms offer what many
consider to be a better alternative.
Living in a dorm for two quarters be
fore deciding whether to rush allows
a lot of students to happily adopt this
living styie. Sorority rush would
occur later during the year also, since
our nationally-drawn student body
makes it difficult to rush just prior to
fall quarter, as most Greeks do.
No Hoover Tower death plunges
will follow the coming sorority rushs
(though, maintenance crews may
still be sweeping up leftover Chem 33
flunkees). Prior to the ban in the '40s,
most of the women lived in
sororities; they were understandably
exclusive as a social unit â€” few out
side activities could be initiated due
to lack of sponsorship. Nowadays,
women in the dorms have almost the
best of both worlds in coed living.
Furthermore, fraternity "little sister"
programs offer halfway-houses for
those not wishing to make a full
commitment to an Hellenic living
group.
Lastly, responsibility will play a fea
ture role. We have learned from our
past mistakes and can continually
contrast our unique situation with
other chapters nationally. The Stan
ford sorority women of tomorrow
will be responsible enough to move
their organizations along a new path,
though not without its detours and
chuckholes. Nevertheless, with the
guiding hand of the University and
the backing of present fraternities,
the women will lead one another into
essential positions in government,
business and the professions.
Perhaps, one of our future Hellenes
may be married to the First Husband
residing in the White House.
