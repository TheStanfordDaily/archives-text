Vandalism of art
The recent vandalism of a major
sculpture on campus, threats of van
dalism to a proposed sculpture for
this campus, and actual vandalism of
a wooden mockup of the latter
prompt these thoughts on vandalism
and the visual arts at Stanford.
Tradically, one of the serious dete
rents to placing art on the Stanford
campus is the threat of vandalism by
some of our own students. The van
dalism of art is an assault not just on
property rights, but those of the
human beings who made it. There
are countless men and women of av
erage courage who would rather
themselves be assaulted by spray
painting or even endure more physi
cal violence than have these insults
intlicted on their art.
For artists their work is not just a
second self, it is often the best of
themselves; it is their offspring in
spirit and form; it is their gift to
others and the future. Art is the ar
tist 's credential for being a civilized
person. Art's protection is a re
quirement of civilized society. Van
dalism is not a joking matter.
Educated people are identifiable
by their respect for what they may
not know about or have a taste for in
the arts. Familiarity does not breed
contempt in the arts, but lack of
familiarity often does. Contempt
breeds vandalism. Stanford seems to
number those who are not humbled

by their ignorance, but instead are
vengeful. They will not stir them
selves to see art already made, but
are moved to prevent its coming into
being. One argument for a stronger
humanities requirement is to de
velop a broader respect for the arts.
To graduate those who would in any
way encourage vandalism or treat its
prospect frivolously diminishes this
University.
Anv work of art may be disputed
on the merits by the fair minded, and
the art in question is no exception. It
is the humanities' function to train
students to be critical as well as ap
preciative.

Overseas campuses
Erin Potter's concern for academic
standards at overseas campuses
(Daily, )an. 13) prompts me to a
couple of observations:
Perhaps the "Law Focus Program"
(Summer 1977) at Cliveden would
have eased Erin's mind a bit. As de
manding as any course sequence at
the home campus, the program left
little opportunity for Erin's grandiose
scheme for playing hooky ("seven
weeks of the quarter on trains and
the last two weeks completing
course work").
The success of such programs may
suggest to overseas studies adminis
trators some possible curriculum

changes at other campuses —
perhaps more emphasis on themati
cally related courses, with professors
willing to coordinate their teaching
efforts and students anticipating a
cohesive array of studies. Of course,
opportunities for independent work
should also be provided. But all of
these arrangements invoke the prin
ciple of observation number two:
It is nigh unto impossible to set
academic standards overseas as pre
cisely as in Palo Alto. Granting some
leeway to out-of-staters who've
never seen Point Reyes or Lake
Tahoe, travel among Stanford stu
dents in California is simply not inex
tricably linked with academic life.
Really now, what kind of nerd is
going to arrive at Cliveden for a
three-month stay in the library when
he could hold audience with the
ghost of Dylan Thomas at a little
known cove in Wales? And what kind
of straight-A |unkie is going to settle
in France and ignore the possibility
of joining the commune at Shakes
peare and Company on the Rive

Gauche, Paris?
I would argue that such experi
ences cannot be separated from the
so-called academic education over
seas. Admitting that assigned work is
the main concern of any good over
seas study program, one would be
foolish to overlook the reason for
such work. In other words, it would
be pretty hard to study the history of
France if France didn't exist, or to
sing praises to the memory of the
Cawain-poet if Yorkshire or Lanca
shire were figments of the imagina
tion.
I should note that some of my
friends have acquired considerable
academic knowledge by arranging
independent study projects in which
appropriate travel supplemented
book larnin'.
The overseas studies program pro
vided me with one of my most re
warding educational experiences,
and I can't help but be grateful.
