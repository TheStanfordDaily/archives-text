Evolving-Superconducting Technology:
Some Cool Solutions to Hot Problems
Superconductivity — the ability of certain metals to carry electrical currents without
0 dissipation — has been known for over six decades and has been understood in a I
microscopic sense since 1957. The discovery of a variety of superconductors with
improved properties has opened the doors to new technology ranging from ex
tremely small high-speed-computer elements to huge magnets for confining the
g plasmas which may eventually be used to generate power using the energy re- !
11l leased by the fusion of nuclei.
