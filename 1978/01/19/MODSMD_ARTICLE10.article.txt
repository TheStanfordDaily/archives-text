—Dr. Pauling recently sent a statement to the National
Cancer Institute Advisory Board in which he notes that "I
have another application pending — an application for sup
port not only of animal studies, but also of basic scientific
studies of the action of ascorbic acid, especially in relation to
the immune process, and clinical studies in several hospi
tals."
Pauling emphasized the serious harm in delaying support
of research on cancer with the comment, "Some of the work
that my associates and I propose to carry out if our present
application is approved would have been carried out four
years ago if the first application had been approved." He
goes on to state that "It is my opinion that the National
Cancer Institute has been doing an excellent job in the field
of development. On the other hand, it is my opinion that the
National Cancer Institute does not know how to carry on
research nor how to recognize a new idea."
—Since issuing this statement, Dr. Pauling has received a
letter from Roger H. Halterman, M.D., chief of the diagnosis
and treatment branch of the division of cancer research
resources and centers, National Cancer Institute, which be
gins, "Based on evaluation of scientific merit of this applica
tion, disapproval must be recommended."
—In spite of unsuccessful applications to the National
Cancer Institute and a lack of interest in the Pauling-
Cameron work shown by the American Cancer Society, the
work of the Pauling Institute and of non-resident fellow Dr.
Cameron has been carried out with the aid of grants from the
Educational Foundation of America, the Secretary of State for
Scotland, the Hoffman-La Roche Company and private
donors. The Institute is now looking for facilities on the West
Coast to establish a clinic providing orthomolecular therapy
forcancer, multiplesclerosisand otherdebilitatingdiseases.
According to Richard Hicks, Executive Vice-president of
the Institute, they need "land, buildings, and funding."
Readers with suggestions are urged to contact Mr. Hicks at
The Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine, 2700
Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, California 94025.
—Dr. Pauling now states that "It is my opinion tht the
discovery of huge doses of vitamin C may before long be
recognized as constituting the most important contribution
to the control of cancer that has been made during the last 25
years."
