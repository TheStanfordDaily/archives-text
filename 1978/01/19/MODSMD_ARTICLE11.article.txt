# Paraguay:
## illicit drugs, indiscriminate persecution, governmental lawlessness 
### 
Paraguay, the small buffer
nation between Brazil and
Argentina, has become a thriv
ing center of the contraband
drug market. Paraguay's dic
tator, General Alfredo Stroess
ner, is at least indirectly impli
cated in the smuggling and il
licit trade of drugs by a 1974
Reader's Digest article and
more recently, a column by
nationally-syndicated jour
nalist jack Anderson.
From a CIA memo and his
own staff investigation, Ander
son has compiled a list of high

Paraguayan figures, who are
directly controlled by Stroess
ner" who are "responsible for
the drug trade." Among others
his list includes "General
Andres Rodriguez, the sternly
handsome commander of 3000
American-equipped troops
based near Asuncion," Pastor
Coronel, "Stroessner's trusted
chief of investigative police,"
Sabino Augusto Montanaro,
Interior Secretary, Vicente
Quinonez, Air Force Chief
General, Raul Sapena Pastor,
"the Secretary of State, who
has granted passports to

known smugglers" and a few
others. As a related and inci
dental datum we note that in
March of this year the youngest
son of General Stroessner mar
ried Rodriguez' daughter. Rod
riguez also gained notoriety
when he was accused last year
by the U.S. government of
master-minding the drug trade
for all of South America.
Indiscriminate persecution
in Paraguay includes tortures
of the cruelest kind and is not
limited to the national borders
but extends to other countries.
It includes the kidnapping of
members of the opposition
with the goal of bringing them
to Paraguay to be tortured
and/or murdered. An example

is the assassination plot against
my father in Montevideo,
Uruguay, in the early '60s, the
perpetrators of which were in
tercepted by the Uruguayan
police. Another example is the
disappearance, early this year,
of Dr. Agustin Goiburu,
member of the MOPOCO
(another dissident branch of
the majority party). Dr. Goib
uru was kidnapped in Ciudad
de Parana, Argentina, by civi
lians who identified them
selves as belonging to the
Argentine police. Months later
Goiburu was found in Asun
cion, Paraguay, and is pre
sently being held, with seven
others, by the presidential
guard battalion, badly de

formed by torture. This infor
mation comes from an uniden
tified but reliable source and
contradicts government de
nials that they hold him. A final
example is provided by the
latest attempt to extradite my
father and brother to Paraguay.
The number of documented
cases of repression inside and
outside Paraguay goes far, far
beyond these.
Stroessner tries to preserve a
few shreds of legitimacy by re
newing every three months his
declaration, originally made 23
years ago, of "a state of siege."
Under this dubious attempt at
lawfulness, personal guaran
tees recognized by the con
stitution are suspended for an
indeterminate period of time
and the lives of the citizens are
open to the capiice of the au
thorities. "Lawyers are reluc
tant to take on the judicial de
fense of political prisoners,"
reports the Agenda Noticiosa
Paraguaya (the paper of Liberal
Party exiles), "more because
they know beforehand that al
legations based on law will
have no effect whatsoever than
for fear of compromising
themselves. If dictatorship is
defined as a power not limited
by law, then without doubt,
Paraguay has been ruled by a
dictatorship for 23 years."
In a similar vein, "elections"
are staged regularly and if the
constitution can not be mod
ified to serve the interests of
the Stroessner regime, it is dut
ifully modified. The State De
partment analysis found that
. . the Government of Gen
eral Alfredo Stroessner has
again shown that it has no real

interest in instituting a rep
resentative democracy in the
country. After a long process of
discussion and compromises,
two of the main parties of the
legalized opposition achieved
reunification and exerted
combined pressures against
the amendment of the Con
stitution that would allow the
re-election of Stroessner for
the fifth time. In order to neut
ralize this unexpected show of
strength of the opposition,
General Stroessner had the
electoral college recognize a

tiny dissident faction of those
parties. By this maneuver,
Stroessner forced the main
body of the joint front against
him into a spurious and cont
rived illegality." The amend
ment that permits Stroessner's
re-election is now in the con
stitution.
To legalize the repression
further, a law (law 209, "De
fense of public peace and lib
erty of the people," extending
former law 294, "Defense of
Democracy") has been
enacted which makes virtually
any kind of opposition to the
government illegal. For exam
ple, "whoever, alone or obey
ing directives of an organiza
tion of whatever origin, shall
carry out or incite to carry out
actions tending to provoke
hatred or violent class struggle
or to subvert in any way the

political and social order" will
be punished by "three to 15
years in prison." Any kind of
demonstration, however
peaceful, could fit under these
definitions in theory, and cer
tainly does so in practice.
Other articles restrict freedom
of the press, etc.
The Paraguayan bishops
have publicly announced that
this law "abolishes a certain
number of rights basic to free
citizens, all of which are univ
ersal, inviolable, and ir
renouncable, such as the right

to information, to one's own
opinion, to meet and associate
with others, the natural right to
peaceful resistance to what is
arbitrary and unjust; the right
to criticism within democ
racy. . ." Not even the Catholic
church, the most independent
institution apart from the gov
ernment, is free in Paraguay; a
number of its priests have been
expelled orare in prison today.
In short, the apparent peace
ful quality that a casual vis
itor might observe in Paraguay
should not lead him to accept
literally the large neon sign on
the Central Bank that reads
"Peace, progress, and well
being with Stroessner." Please
let him know that appearances
deceive, and, in this case, they
deceive greatly.

Paraguay, the small buffer
nation between Brazil and
Argentina, has become a thriv
ing center of the contraband
drug market. Paraguay's dic
tator, General Alfredo Stroess
ner, is at least indirectly impli
cated in the smuggling and il
licit trade of drugs by a 1974
Reader's Digest article and
more recently, a column by
nationally-syndicated jour
nalist jack Anderson.
From a CIA memo and his
own staff investigation, Ander
son has compiled a list of high

Paraguayan figures, who are
directly controlled by Stroess
ner" who are "responsible for
the drug trade." Among others
his list includes "General
Andres Rodriguez, the sternly
handsome commander of 3000
American-equipped troops
based near Asuncion," Pastor
Coronel, "Stroessner's trusted
chief of investigative police,"
Sabino Augusto Montanaro,
Interior Secretary, Vicente
Quinonez, Air Force Chief
General, Raul Sapena Pastor,
"the Secretary of State, who
has granted passports to

known smugglers" and a few
others. As a related and inci
dental datum we note that in
March of this year the youngest
son of General Stroessner mar
ried Rodriguez' daughter. Rod
riguez also gained notoriety
when he was accused last year
by the U.S. government of
master-minding the drug trade
for all of South America.
Indiscriminate persecution
in Paraguay includes tortures
of the cruelest kind and is not
limited to the national borders
but extends to other countries.
It includes the kidnapping of
members of the opposition
with the goal of bringing them
to Paraguay to be tortured
and/or murdered. An example

is the assassination plot against
my father in Montevideo,
Uruguay, in the early '60s, the
perpetrators of which were in
tercepted by the Uruguayan
police. Another example is the
disappearance, early this year,
of Dr. Agustin Goiburu,
member of the MOPOCO
(another dissident branch of
the majority party). Dr. Goib
uru was kidnapped in Ciudad
de Parana, Argentina, by civi
lians who identified them
selves as belonging to the
Argentine police. Months later
Goiburu was found in Asun
cion, Paraguay, and is pre
sently being held, with seven
others, by the presidential
guard battalion, badly de

formed by torture. This infor
mation comes from an uniden
tified but reliable source and
contradicts government de
nials that they hold him. A final
example is provided by the
latest attempt to extradite my
father and brother to Paraguay.
The number of documented
cases of repression inside and
outside Paraguay goes far, far
beyond these.
Stroessner tries to preserve a
few shreds of legitimacy by re
newing every three months his
declaration, originally made 23
years ago, of "a state of siege."
Under this dubious attempt at
lawfulness, personal guaran
tees recognized by the con
stitution are suspended for an
indeterminate period of time
and the lives of the citizens are
open to the capiice of the au
thorities. "Lawyers are reluc
tant to take on the judicial de
fense of political prisoners,"
reports the Agenda Noticiosa
Paraguaya (the paper of Liberal
Party exiles), "more because
they know beforehand that al
legations based on law will
have no effect whatsoever than
for fear of compromising
themselves. If dictatorship is
defined as a power not limited
by law, then without doubt,
Paraguay has been ruled by a
dictatorship for 23 years."
In a similar vein, "elections"
are staged regularly and if the
constitution can not be mod
ified to serve the interests of
the Stroessner regime, it is dut
ifully modified. The State De
partment analysis found that
. . the Government of Gen
eral Alfredo Stroessner has
again shown that it has no real

interest in instituting a rep
resentative democracy in the
country. After a long process of
discussion and compromises,
two of the main parties of the
legalized opposition achieved
reunification and exerted
combined pressures against
the amendment of the Con
stitution that would allow the
re-election of Stroessner for
the fifth time. In order to neut
ralize this unexpected show of
strength of the opposition,
General Stroessner had the
electoral college recognize a

tiny dissident faction of those
parties. By this maneuver,
Stroessner forced the main
body of the joint front against
him into a spurious and cont
rived illegality." The amend
ment that permits Stroessner's
re-election is now in the con
stitution.
To legalize the repression
further, a law (law 209, "De
fense of public peace and lib
erty of the people," extending
former law 294, "Defense of
Democracy") has been
enacted which makes virtually
any kind of opposition to the
government illegal. For exam
ple, "whoever, alone or obey
ing directives of an organiza
tion of whatever origin, shall
carry out or incite to carry out
actions tending to provoke
hatred or violent class struggle
or to subvert in any way the

political and social order" will
be punished by "three to 15
years in prison." Any kind of
demonstration, however
peaceful, could fit under these
definitions in theory, and cer
tainly does so in practice.
Other articles restrict freedom
of the press, etc.
The Paraguayan bishops

ment that permits Stroessner's
re-election is now in the con
stitution.
To legalize the repression
further, a law (law 209, "De
fense of public peace and lib
erty of the people," extending
former law 294, "Defense of
Democracy") has been
enacted which makes virtually
any kind of opposition to the
government illegal. For exam
ple, "whoever, alone or obey
ing directives of an organiza
tion of whatever origin, shall
carry out or incite to carry out
actions tending to provoke
hatred or violent class struggle
or to subvert in any way the

political and social order" will
be punished by "three to 15
years in prison." Any kind of
demonstration, however
peaceful, could fit under these
definitions in theory, and cer
tainly does so in practice.
Other articles restrict freedom
of the press, etc.
The Paraguayan bishops
have publicly announced that
this law "abolishes a certain
number of rights basic to free
citizens, all of which are univ
ersal, inviolable, and ir
renouncable, such as the right

to information, to one's own
opinion, to meet and associate
with others, the natural right to
peaceful resistance to what is
arbitrary and unjust; the right
to criticism within democ
racy. . ." Not even the Catholic
church, the most independent
institution apart from the gov
ernment, is free in Paraguay; a
number of its priests have been
expelled orare in prison today.
In short, the apparent peace
ful quality that a casual vis
itor might observe in Paraguay
should not lead him to accept
literally the large neon sign on
the Central Bank that reads
"Peace, progress, and well
being with Stroessner." Please
let him know that appearances
deceive, and, in this case, they
deceive greatly.

Paraguay, the small buffer
nation between Brazil and
Argentina, has become a thriv
ing center of the contraband
drug market. Paraguay's dic
tator, General Alfredo Stroess
ner, is at least indirectly impli
cated in the smuggling and il
licit trade of drugs by a 1974
Reader's Digest article and
more recently, a column by
nationally-syndicated jour
nalist jack Anderson.
From a CIA memo and his
own staff investigation, Ander
son has compiled a list of high

Paraguayan figures, who are
directly controlled by Stroess
ner" who are "responsible for
the drug trade." Among others
his list includes "General
Andres Rodriguez, the sternly
handsome commander of 3000
American-equipped troops
based near Asuncion," Pastor
Coronel, "Stroessner's trusted
chief of investigative police,"
Sabino Augusto Montanaro,
Interior Secretary, Vicente
Quinonez, Air Force Chief
General, Raul Sapena Pastor,
"the Secretary of State, who
has granted passports to

known smugglers" and a few
others. As a related and inci
dental datum we note that in
March of this year the youngest
son of General Stroessner mar
ried Rodriguez' daughter. Rod
riguez also gained notoriety
when he was accused last year
by the U.S. government of
master-minding the drug trade
for all of South America.
Indiscriminate persecution
in Paraguay includes tortures
of the cruelest kind and is not
limited to the national borders
but extends to other countries.
It includes the kidnapping of
members of the opposition
with the goal of bringing them
to Paraguay to be tortured
and/or murdered. An example

is the assassination plot against
my father in Montevideo,
Uruguay, in the early '60s, the
perpetrators of which were in
tercepted by the Uruguayan
police. Another example is the
disappearance, early this year,
of Dr. Agustin Goiburu,
member of the MOPOCO
(another dissident branch of
the majority party). Dr. Goib
uru was kidnapped in Ciudad
de Parana, Argentina, by civi
lians who identified them
selves as belonging to the
Argentine police. Months later
Goiburu was found in Asun
cion, Paraguay, and is pre
sently being held, with seven
others, by the presidential
guard battalion, badly de

formed by torture. This infor
mation comes from an uniden
tified but reliable source and
contradicts government de
nials that they hold him. A final
example is provided by the
latest attempt to extradite my
father and brother to Paraguay.
The number of documented
cases of repression inside and
outside Paraguay goes far, far
beyond these.
Stroessner tries to preserve a
few shreds of legitimacy by re
newing every three months his
declaration, originally made 23
years ago, of "a state of siege."
Under this dubious attempt at
lawfulness, personal guaran
tees recognized by the con
stitution are suspended for an
indeterminate period of time
and the lives of the citizens are
open to the capiice of the au
thorities. "Lawyers are reluc
tant to take on the judicial de
fense of political prisoners,"
reports the Agenda Noticiosa
Paraguaya (the paper of Liberal
Party exiles), "more because
they know beforehand that al
legations based on law will
have no effect whatsoever than
for fear of compromising
themselves. If dictatorship is
defined as a power not limited
by law, then without doubt,
Paraguay has been ruled by a
dictatorship for 23 years."
In a similar vein, "elections"
are staged regularly and if the
constitution can not be mod
ified to serve the interests of
the Stroessner regime, it is dut
ifully modified. The State De
partment analysis found that
. . the Government of Gen
eral Alfredo Stroessner has
again shown that it has no real

interest in instituting a rep
resentative democracy in the
country. After a long process of
discussion and compromises,
two of the main parties of the
legalized opposition achieved
reunification and exerted
combined pressures against
the amendment of the Con
stitution that would allow the
re-election of Stroessner for
the fifth time. In order to neut
ralize this unexpected show of
strength of the opposition,
General Stroessner had the
electoral college recognize a

tiny dissident faction of those
parties. By this maneuver,
Stroessner forced the main
body of the joint front against
him into a spurious and cont
rived illegality." The amend
ment that permits Stroessner's
re-election is now in the con
stitution.
To legalize the repression
