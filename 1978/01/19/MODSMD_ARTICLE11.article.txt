# Paraguay:
## illicit drugs, indiscriminate persecution, governmental lawlessness 
### 
Paraguay, the small buffer
nation between Brazil and
Argentina, has become a thriv
ing center of the contraband
drug market. Paraguay's dic
tator, General Alfredo Stroess
ner, is at least indirectly impli
cated in the smuggling and il
licit trade of drugs by a 1974
Reader's Digest article and
more recently, a column by
nationally-syndicated jour
nalist jack Anderson.
From a CIA memo and his
own staff investigation, Ander
son has compiled a list of high

Paraguayan figures, who are
directly controlled by Stroess
ner" who are "responsible for
the drug trade." Among others
his list includes "General
Andres Rodriguez, the sternly
handsome commander of 3000
American-equipped troops
based near Asuncion," Pastor
Coronel, "Stroessner's trusted
chief of investigative police,"
Sabino Augusto Montanaro,
Interior Secretary, Vicente
Quinonez, Air Force Chief
General, Raul Sapena Pastor,
"the Secretary of State, who
has granted passports to

known smugglers" and a few
others. As a related and inci
dental datum we note that in
March of this year the youngest
son of General Stroessner mar
ried Rodriguez' daughter. Rod
riguez also gained notoriety
when he was accused last year
by the U.S. government of
master-minding the drug trade
for all of South America.
Indiscriminate persecution
in Paraguay includes tortures
of the cruelest kind and is not
limited to the national borders
but extends to other countries.
It includes the kidnapping of
members of the opposition
with the goal of bringing them
to Paraguay to be tortured
and/or murdered. An example

is the assassination plot against
my father in Montevideo,
Uruguay, in the early '60s, the
perpetrators of which were in
tercepted by the Uruguayan
police. Another example is the
disappearance, early this year,
of Dr. Agustin Goiburu,
member of the MOPOCO
(another dissident branch of
the majority party). Dr. Goib
uru was kidnapped in Ciudad
de Parana, Argentina, by civi
lians who identified them
selves as belonging to the
Argentine police. Months later
Goiburu was found in Asun
cion, Paraguay, and is pre

others, by the presidential
guard battalion, badly de
