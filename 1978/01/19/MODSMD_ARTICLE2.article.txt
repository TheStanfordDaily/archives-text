Webster named new FBI director
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter has
chosen U.S. Circuit judge William H. Webster to be
the next FBI director, administration sources said last
night.
Webster, 53, of St. Louis won a strong recommen
dation from Attorney General Griffin Bell and Carter
agreed with Bell's choice, the sources said. The White
House was expected to make the formal announce
ment today.
Webster must win Senate confirmation before tak
ing over the FBI from Director Clarence Kelley, who is
scheduled to retire Feb. 15.
The choice of the Missouri judge and former fed
eral prosecutor ends the administration's year-long
search for an FBI chief willing to serve a 10-year term,
the maximum permitted by law.
Bell had insisted on a 10-year commitment to pro
vide the bureau with continuity in leadership as it
continues major changes in its operations and recov
ers from disclosures of past wrongdoing.
A Republican, Webster dabbled in Missouri party
politics several years ago, but has refrained from
political activities since he was appointed a federal
district judge in 1971 by then-President Richard Ni
xon.
Carter revises hospital standards
Washington (AP) — The Carter administration re
vised its proposed national hospital standards yes
terday to give local agencies, particularly in rural
areas, more flexibility to decide how many hospital
beds and what services are needed in a community.
The revised proposal, which follows an outpouring
of more than 55,000 letters from congressmen and
the public, represents a significant pullback from
"mandatory standards" proposed last September
when officials predicted they would eliminate one of
every 10 hospital beds in the country by 1984.
Formally called National Health Planning
Guidelines, the proposed standards are the first at
tempt by the federal government to determine an
adequate level of hospital care in the United States.
As written and now revised by the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, the guidelines say
there should be fewer than fourgeneral hospital beds
for 1000 population in a community and that the aver
age bed should be occupied at least 80 percent of the
time.
There are now about 4.4 beds per 1000 nationwide
and a 75 percent occupancy rate.
JFK assassination files released
Washington (AP) — In the years following John
Kennedy's assassination,). Edgar Hoover fumed over

the mounting criticism of the FBI investigation of the
case but decided to ignore most of the critics, at least
publicly.
In private, he kept meticulous records on the cri
tics' personal lives as well as their public comments
about the bureau.
The details emerged from 58,754 pages of FBI files
that the bureau made public yesterday to comply with
requests under the Freedom of Information Act.
The half-ton of documents, together with 40,001
pages released in December, comprise virtually all of
the bureau's investigative files on the murder of the
president Nov. 22, 1963, in Dallas.
• This batch of files begins in mid-1964. Scores of
letters and memos reflect the cool but polite relation
ship between the FBI and the Warren Commission as
the commission launched its probe of the case.
Later that year, the commission was to report its
conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy
and that he acted alone. Hoover had arrived at the
same belief months earlier.
$1 million for sports charity
Detroit (AP) — An 80-year-old sports promoter who
sued the city after his wife was killed by young thugs
has agreed to a settlement in which Detroit will fi
nance a $1 million athletics program to get similar
youths "off the front page . . . and onto the sports
page.''
The out-of-court agreement, expected to be ap
proved by the city council, came in a suit filed against
the city by Leo Salakin, who was beaten unconscious
with a crowbar. His wife, Pearl, was stabbed to death
in the same attack in their home.
City officials said the proposed settlement, which
they describe as unprecedented, called for the estab
lishment of a foundation to promote amateur athle
tics in Detroit.
In his suit for $23 million in damages, Salakin
claimed that when the thugs began smashing in the
front door of his home on May 3, 1976, he called the
911 police emergency number and was told by the
operator to find out who was outside.
Coal strike reduces stockpiles
New York (AP) — The six-week-old coal strike has
reduced stockpiles at electric utilities, but most
should be able to withstand the strike for at least
three more months, government and industry offi
cials said yesterday.
A spot check confirmed that assessment, but also
found utilities in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Mary
land and Ohio at which dwindling supplies soon
might cause emergency curtailments of service.
The spot check also showed that steelmakers said
their stocks of coal — vital to production of steel —

were adequate, but the walkout is having a serious
effect on the two major coal-hauling railroads.
The Norfolk & Western, where coal accounts for 70
percent of the tonnage and 40 percent of revenues,
has laid off 4100 of its 24,600 employees because of
the strike, spokesman William Martin said. The Ches
sie System reports having laid off more than 875
employees.
Civic center roof collapses in rain
Hartford, Conn. (AP) — The coliseum roof of
Hartford's three-year-old Civic Center collapsed
under heavy rain and snowyesterday, injuring noone
but dealing what Mayor George Athanson called "a
serious blow" to hopes for downtown revival.
Athanson called the Civic Center, which cost $70
million and was the focus of a major urban renewal
effort, "the focal point of the new beat of Hartford."
The flat, 1400-ton roof of the 10,000-seat arena
crumpled without warning at 4:19 a.m., just hours
after 4800 basketball fans had left the arena.
Initial assessments were that repairs would take 1 Vi
to 2 years, and Arthur Lumsden, president of the
Greater Hartford Chamber of Commerce, predicted
business losses of between $15 million and $20 mill
ion a year.
Deadly radium found in junkyard
Meridian, Miss. (AP) — Eight stainless steel tubes
holding dangerous doses of radioactive radium were
found amid the debris in a junkyard yesterday, six
days after they disappeared from a hospital.
Ed Fuente, director of the Mississippi Board of
Health's Radiological Health division, and an assis
tant found the radium at the St. Louis )unk Co., ac
cording to board spokesman Sam Mabry.
"All of the needles are now accounted for," Mabry
said.
Nine of the containers were discovered missing
from a locked room at Jeff Anderson Memorial Hospi
tal on Thursday. One was quickly discovered in the
hospital parking lot.
The others were found after officials remembered
that "the hospital commonly sells scrap metal to the
company and that the room where the needles had
been stored was very junky," Mabry said. "Our
people assume that the needles inadvertently got
into the stuff that was sold to the junk company."
Today's weather
Showers likely today with westerly winds 15 to 30

Lows tonight in the upper 30s and 40s. Highs today
and tomorrow in the 50s. Chance of rain 60 percent
today.

$1 million for sports charity
Detroit (AP) — An 80-year-old sports promoter who
sued the city after his wife was killed by young thugs
has agreed to a settlement in which Detroit will fi
nance a $1 million athletics program to get similar
youths "off the front page . . . and onto the sports
page.''
The out-of-court agreement, expected to be ap
proved by the city council, came in a suit filed against
the city by Leo Salakin, who was beaten unconscious
with a crowbar. His wife, Pearl, was stabbed to death
in the same attack in their home.
City officials said the proposed settlement, which
they describe as unprecedented, called for the estab
lishment of a foundation to promote amateur athle
tics in Detroit.
In his suit for $23 million in damages, Salakin
claimed that when the thugs began smashing in the
front door of his home on May 3, 1976, he called the
911 police emergency number and was told by the
operator to find out who was outside.
Coal strike reduces stockpiles
New York (AP) — The six-week-old coal strike has
reduced stockpiles at electric utilities, but most
should be able to withstand the strike for at least
three more months, government and industry offi
cials said yesterday.
A spot check confirmed that assessment, but also
found utilities in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Mary
land and Ohio at which dwindling supplies soon
might cause emergency curtailments of service.
The spot check also showed that steelmakers said
their stocks of coal — vital to production of steel —

were adequate, but the walkout is having a serious
effect on the two major coal-hauling railroads.
The Norfolk & Western, where coal accounts for 70
percent of the tonnage and 40 percent of revenues,
has laid off 4100 of its 24,600 employees because of
the strike, spokesman William Martin said. The Ches
sie System reports having laid off more than 875
employees.
Civic center roof collapses in rain
Hartford, Conn. (AP) — The coliseum roof of
Hartford's three-year-old Civic Center collapsed
under heavy rain and snowyesterday, injuring noone
but dealing what Mayor George Athanson called "a
serious blow" to hopes for downtown revival.
Athanson called the Civic Center, which cost $70
million and was the focus of a major urban renewal
effort, "the focal point of the new beat of Hartford."
The flat, 1400-ton roof of the 10,000-seat arena
crumpled without warning at 4:19 a.m., just hours
after 4800 basketball fans had left the arena.
Initial assessments were that repairs would take 1 Vi
to 2 years, and Arthur Lumsden, president of the
Greater Hartford Chamber of Commerce, predicted
business losses of between $15 million and $20 mill
ion a year.
Deadly radium found in junkyard
Meridian, Miss. (AP) — Eight stainless steel tubes
holding dangerous doses of radioactive radium were
found amid the debris in a junkyard yesterday, six
days after they disappeared from a hospital.
Ed Fuente, director of the Mississippi Board of
Health's Radiological Health division, and an assis
tant found the radium at the St. Louis )unk Co., ac
cording to board spokesman Sam Mabry.
"All of the needles are now accounted for," Mabry
said.
Nine of the containers were discovered missing
from a locked room at Jeff Anderson Memorial Hospi
tal on Thursday. One was quickly discovered in the
hospital parking lot.
The others were found after officials remembered
that "the hospital commonly sells scrap metal to the
company and that the room where the needles had
been stored was very junky," Mabry said. "Our
people assume that the needles inadvertently got
into the stuff that was sold to the junk company."
Today's weather

Webster named new FBI director
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter has
chosen U.S. Circuit judge William H. Webster to be
the next FBI director, administration sources said last
night.
Webster, 53, of St. Louis won a strong recommen
dation from Attorney General Griffin Bell and Carter
agreed with Bell's choice, the sources said. The White
House was expected to make the formal announce
ment today.
Webster must win Senate confirmation before tak
ing over the FBI from Director Clarence Kelley, who is
scheduled to retire Feb. 15.
The choice of the Missouri judge and former fed
eral prosecutor ends the administration's year-long
search for an FBI chief willing to serve a 10-year term,
the maximum permitted by law.
Bell had insisted on a 10-year commitment to pro
vide the bureau with continuity in leadership as it
continues major changes in its operations and recov
ers from disclosures of past wrongdoing.
A Republican, Webster dabbled in Missouri party
politics several years ago, but has refrained from
political activities since he was appointed a federal
district judge in 1971 by then-President Richard Ni
xon.
Carter revises hospital standards
Washington (AP) — The Carter administration re
vised its proposed national hospital standards yes
terday to give local agencies, particularly in rural
areas, more flexibility to decide how many hospital
beds and what services are needed in a community.
The revised proposal, which follows an outpouring
of more than 55,000 letters from congressmen and
the public, represents a significant pullback from
"mandatory standards" proposed last September
when officials predicted they would eliminate one of
every 10 hospital beds in the country by 1984.
Formally called National Health Planning
Guidelines, the proposed standards are the first at
tempt by the federal government to determine an
adequate level of hospital care in the United States.
As written and now revised by the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, the guidelines say
there should be fewer than fourgeneral hospital beds
for 1000 population in a community and that the aver
age bed should be occupied at least 80 percent of the
time.
There are now about 4.4 beds per 1000 nationwide
and a 75 percent occupancy rate.

Civic center roof collapses in rain
Hartford, Conn. (AP) — The coliseum roof of
Hartford's three-year-old Civic Center collapsed
under heavy rain and snowyesterday, injuring noone
but dealing what Mayor George Athanson called "a
serious blow" to hopes for downtown revival.
Athanson called the Civic Center, which cost $70
million and was the focus of a major urban renewal
effort, "the focal point of the new beat of Hartford."
The flat, 1400-ton roof of the 10,000-seat arena
crumpled without warning at 4:19 a.m., just hours
after 4800 basketball fans had left the arena.
Initial assessments were that repairs would take 1 Vi
to 2 years, and Arthur Lumsden, president of the
Greater Hartford Chamber of Commerce, predicted
business losses of between $15 million and $20 mill
ion a year.
Deadly radium found in junkyard
Meridian, Miss. (AP) — Eight stainless steel tubes
holding dangerous doses of radioactive radium were
found amid the debris in a junkyard yesterday, six
days after they disappeared from a hospital.
Ed Fuente, director of the Mississippi Board of
Health's Radiological Health division, and an assis
tant found the radium at the St. Louis )unk Co., ac
cording to board spokesman Sam Mabry.
"All of the needles are now accounted for," Mabry
said.
Nine of the containers were discovered missing
from a locked room at Jeff Anderson Memorial Hospi
tal on Thursday. One was quickly discovered in the
hospital parking lot.
The others were found after officials remembered
that "the hospital commonly sells scrap metal to the
company and that the room where the needles had
been stored was very junky," Mabry said. "Our
people assume that the needles inadvertently got
into the stuff that was sold to the junk company."
Today's weather
Showers likely today with westerly winds 15 to 30

Lows tonight in the upper 30s and 40s. Highs today

Webster named new FBI director
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter has
chosen U.S. Circuit judge William H. Webster to be
the next FBI director, administration sources said last
night.
Webster, 53, of St. Louis won a strong recommen
dation from Attorney General Griffin Bell and Carter
agreed with Bell's choice, the sources said. The White
House was expected to make the formal announce
ment today.
Webster must win Senate confirmation before tak
ing over the FBI from Director Clarence Kelley, who is
scheduled to retire Feb. 15.
The choice of the Missouri judge and former fed
eral prosecutor ends the administration's year-long
search for an FBI chief willing to serve a 10-year term,
the maximum permitted by law.
Bell had insisted on a 10-year commitment to pro
vide the bureau with continuity in leadership as it
continues major changes in its operations and recov
ers from disclosures of past wrongdoing.
A Republican, Webster dabbled in Missouri party
politics several years ago, but has refrained from
political activities since he was appointed a federal
district judge in 1971 by then-President Richard Ni
xon.
Carter revises hospital standards
Washington (AP) — The Carter administration re
vised its proposed national hospital standards yes
terday to give local agencies, particularly in rural
areas, more flexibility to decide how many hospital
beds and what services are needed in a community.
The revised proposal, which follows an outpouring
of more than 55,000 letters from congressmen and
the public, represents a significant pullback from
"mandatory standards" proposed last September
when officials predicted they would eliminate one of
every 10 hospital beds in the country by 1984.
Formally called National Health Planning
Guidelines, the proposed standards are the first at
tempt by the federal government to determine an
adequate level of hospital care in the United States.
As written and now revised by the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, the guidelines say
there should be fewer than fourgeneral hospital beds
for 1000 population in a community and that the aver
age bed should be occupied at least 80 percent of the
time.
There are now about 4.4 beds per 1000 nationwide
and a 75 percent occupancy rate.
JFK assassination files released
Washington (AP) — In the years following John
Kennedy's assassination,). Edgar Hoover fumed over

the mounting criticism of the FBI investigation of the
case but decided to ignore most of the critics, at least
publicly.
In private, he kept meticulous records on the cri
tics' personal lives as well as their public comments
about the bureau.
The details emerged from 58,754 pages of FBI files
that the bureau made public yesterday to comply with
requests under the Freedom of Information Act.
The half-ton of documents, together with 40,001
pages released in December, comprise virtually all of
the bureau's investigative files on the murder of the
president Nov. 22, 1963, in Dallas.
• This batch of files begins in mid-1964. Scores of
letters and memos reflect the cool but polite relation
ship between the FBI and the Warren Commission as
the commission launched its probe of the case.
Later that year, the commission was to report its
conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy
and that he acted alone. Hoover had arrived at the
same belief months earlier.
$1 million for sports charity
Detroit (AP) — An 80-year-old sports promoter who
sued the city after his wife was killed by young thugs
has agreed to a settlement in which Detroit will fi
nance a $1 million athletics program to get similar
youths "off the front page . . . and onto the sports
page.''
The out-of-court agreement, expected to be ap
proved by the city council, came in a suit filed against
the city by Leo Salakin, who was beaten unconscious
with a crowbar. His wife, Pearl, was stabbed to death
in the same attack in their home.
City officials said the proposed settlement, which
they describe as unprecedented, called for the estab
lishment of a foundation to promote amateur athle
tics in Detroit.
In his suit for $23 million in damages, Salakin
claimed that when the thugs began smashing in the
front door of his home on May 3, 1976, he called the
911 police emergency number and was told by the
operator to find out who was outside.
Coal strike reduces stockpiles
New York (AP) — The six-week-old coal strike has
reduced stockpiles at electric utilities, but most
should be able to withstand the strike for at least
three more months, government and industry offi
cials said yesterday.
A spot check confirmed that assessment, but also
found utilities in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Mary
land and Ohio at which dwindling supplies soon
might cause emergency curtailments of service.
The spot check also showed that steelmakers said
their stocks of coal — vital to production of steel —

were adequate, but the walkout is having a serious
effect on the two major coal-hauling railroads.
The Norfolk & Western, where coal accounts for 70
percent of the tonnage and 40 percent of revenues,
has laid off 4100 of its 24,600 employees because of
