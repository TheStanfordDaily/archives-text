## 'You have to be a little fanatical...' 
### 
Last spring the American Ballet
Theatre Company came to San Fran
cisco. After the first act of Sleeping
Beauty one Saturday evening, I walked
upstairs to the female soloists dressing
room. Kristine Elliot had just finished
dancing the role of the Fairy of the En
chanted Garden she had agreed to
talk with me about her career as a prom
inent soloist with the company.
Elliot is casually unaware of ballet's
exotic image and dances with healthy
elan. Though unpretentious, she is
theatrically conscious; during an on
stage royal procession, she walks more
regally and musically than anyone else,
yet she never appears vain.
Kristine was born in Oakland and
grew up in San Mateo, where she re
ceived her training from Richard Gib
son. She was a leading member of the
Stuttgart Ballet Company in Germany
before she joined ABT. She danced
Olga in Eugene Onegin, Bianca in Tam
ing of the Shrew and the principal roles
in Swan Lake and Giselle. According to
her resume, Elliott is a vegetarian and a
shoe-hater. I was anxious to meet this
down-to-earth ballerina.
I asked her about starting ballet,
whether she was another Tanaquil le
Clerq whowalked on her toes at the age
of three, or a Kirkland who forgot to
wash her hair because she was so in
volved in her classes? She said that
work, not talent, is responsible for her
success and that she didn't miracul
ously know what a pirouette was be
fore she started dancing at the age of 10
with a modern teacher.

Nureyev came to San Francisco and
Gibson asked her and Kenneth Delmar
(now associate director of the Pacific
Dance Center) to dance for them.
"That was fun! Mr. Gibson said he
was going to cancel it at the last mo
ment, no, we were so excited, we beg
ged him to let us do it. He's a very
strong principled man and maybe,
since they might be expecting profes
sional dancers, he thought it would be
Dolly Dinkle (a Gibsonism meaning
cheap). Robert Goutel was going to
play the piano — all these celebrities at
a crazy party! I'd never experienced
that kind of party before; everybody
dressed extremely, drinking a lot. We
wanted to dance until two in the morn
ing."
She went to other parties as well, on
Friday and Saturday nights, and shared
the junior prom queen title. She en
joyed school, but by senior year she
was "kind of a drop-out." Although she
didn't like the standards of ABT at the
time, she did join the Stuttgart Ballet
Company when she was 19. "I knew
that Mr. Balanchine was very
specialized and that it would involve
going to his school for a long time, but
I'd love to dance some of his things
now. I think of myself as a classical
dancer so I wanted to dance the classics
and Joffrey didn't seem to be classical
enough. I was looking to Europe and at
that tir ne Stuttgart had just made a big
success in New York; everyone was rav
ing about them." While they were per
forming Romeo and luliet, Elliott re
members, she discovered that she had
