# '...to reach that point of perfection...

Her parents made her pay for her first
month of lessons but she knew right
away that she wanted to be a dancer.
She received a scholarship to the San
Francisco Ballet School, but when
Richard Gibson (now director of Pacific
Dance Center in Mountain View) asked
her to study with him instead, she in
stinctively trusted him.
That was when she started taking
classes four or five times a week and
would have to warm up at least an hour
before class. But she says that she
doesn't remember practicing that
much on her own because after two or
three classes, she felt that there was not
much need to do more.
"Oh yeah. I was really dedicated,"
she laughed. "When I was 12 or 13, I
had to give up choir and Brownies and
that was heartbreaking for me at the
time. When I was in high school, I told
myself that there's time for everything
— I don't think I missed out on a lot. I
had too much energy then!"
When she was 14, Fonteyn and

been accepted.
Elliott found that after having studied
with Gibson, "you become a little pam
pered; there aren't classes like that in
any other place, especially company
classes — they are always the worst. . .
you have to learn to work well in a bad
class, because half the time, that's all
you can get. Or else you develop the
discipline to do it yourself, but some
how it's always better for me to do
someone else's class."
It's difficult to improve one's
technique once you're in a company
because "there's so much more to
learn besides technique — stage pre
sence, just being on the stage. What
you can do on the stage and what you
can do in the classroom are two totally
different things. A rehearsal could be
perfect and you could fall apart on the
stage.
"Make-up, costuming, being able to
keep with people, musicality . . .
you're working on a particular piece of
choreography; it's a specialized way of

improving technique. There are things
that I still think I did better as a student
— I used to do many more pirhouettes;
but I do more pirouettes on pointe
now."
In Europe, though, she felt that she
got "into a rut, not concentrating, not
really caring ... I began to enjoy much
more my time off— to be able to travel,
to see places — I didn't concentrate on
my dancing. Something was wrong — I
didn't enjoy being in the theater. I fell
in love ... I wasn't stimulated, I didn't
see a lot of other companies; I saw only
Stuttgart. And I didn't see myself as ris
ing to the top there; I saw the ballerinas
there and I figured they'd be there
forever and I'd never get anywhere.
"And I just didn't like dancing — I
needed a change; I needed some inspi
ration. And actually when I left
Stuttgart, I didn't think I'd go on darn
ing anymore. I quit the company — I
went to Spain and Portugal with mv
boyfriend for two months and we
ended up in Wales. We |ust camped
out; it was fabulous! Aik) I thought,
'This is wonderlul! I don I want to
dance.' "

perfect and you could fall apart on the
stage.
"Make-up, costuming, being able to
keep with people, musicality . . .
you're working on a particular piece of
choreography; it's a specialized way of

improving technique. There are things
that I still think I did better as a student
— I used to do many more pirhouettes;
but I do more pirouettes on pointe
now."
In Europe, though, she felt that she
got "into a rut, not concentrating, not
really caring ... I began to enjoy much
more my time off— to be able to travel,
to see places — I didn't concentrate on
my dancing. Something was wrong — I
didn't enjoy being in the theater. I fell
in love ... I wasn't stimulated, I didn't
see a lot of other companies; I saw only
Stuttgart. And I didn't see myself as ris
ing to the top there; I saw the ballerinas
there and I figured they'd be there
forever and I'd never get anywhere.
"And I just didn't like dancing — I
needed a change; I needed some inspi
ration. And actually when I left
Stuttgart, I didn't think I'd go on darn
ing anymore. I quit the company — I
went to Spain and Portugal with mv
boyfriend for two months and we
ended up in Wales. We |ust camped
out; it was fabulous! Aik) I thought,
'This is wonderlul! I don I want to
dance.' "
Her parents made her pay for her first
month of lessons but she knew right
away that she wanted to be a dancer.
She received a scholarship to the San
Francisco Ballet School, but when
Richard Gibson (now director of Pacific
Dance Center in Mountain View) asked
her to study with him instead, she in
stinctively trusted him.
That was when she started taking
classes four or five times a week and
would have to warm up at least an hour
before class. But she says that she
doesn't remember practicing that
much on her own because after two or
three classes, she felt that there was not
much need to do more.
"Oh yeah. I was really dedicated,"
she laughed. "When I was 12 or 13, I
had to give up choir and Brownies and
that was heartbreaking for me at the
time. When I was in high school, I told
myself that there's time for everything
— I don't think I missed out on a lot. I
had too much energy then!"
When she was 14, Fonteyn and

Elliott found that after having studied
with Gibson, "you become a little pam
pered; there aren't classes like that in
any other place, especially company
classes — they are always the worst. . .
you have to learn to work well in a bad
class, because half the time, that's all
you can get. Or else you develop the
discipline to do it yourself, but some
how it's always better for me to do
someone else's class."
It's difficult to improve one's
technique once you're in a company
because "there's so much more to
learn besides technique — stage pre
sence, just being on the stage. What
you can do on the stage and what you
can do in the classroom are two totally
different things. A rehearsal could be
perfect and you could fall apart on the
stage.
