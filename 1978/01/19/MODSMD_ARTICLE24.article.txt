## Kristine Elliot 
### 
At this time in her life, she felt that it
was too much of a luxury to just study,
yet she desired some direction. She
wondered what she was going to do
with her life .ind she wouldn't take a job
at just anything. "My boyfriend told me
to just I.ken: you're a dancer and you
should gel on with it. That's what you
do best and that's what you really love
to do. I see this many times; once
you've danced — people stop and they
just have to dance. So, it was a real
struggle; having been off for six
months and put on about 20 pounds —
was it really worth it?"
Eager to get a job, Kristine started
taking classes in San Francisco with the
Company, but found that her height
(s'3'/2") as well as the financial prob
lems of the Company precluded any
work.
"I was disappointed ... I could un
derstand what they were going
through; the Company had almost
folded just before I joined and all the
kids were going out in the streets, get
ting money. In order to hire me, Imuine
would have had to fire one of those
people. So at the end of Nutcracker,
they said they couldn't keep me — I
said oh, oh, New York here I come! It's
almost a challenge that every dancer
has to face — you have to do it once in
New York."
To lake classes or to go to auditions?
"To join one of the companies in New
York. There isn't really a glamor com
pany outside of New York except
maybe San Francisco Ballet in the Un
ited States."
What would she have done if her
technique or her will had gone below
the point where she could have joined a
company in New York? So many people
just keep trying desperately to win a
losing battle.
"Oh well, if I went to New York and I
auditioned there and nobody wanted
me, I would say if you want to dance,
then there's a place for you to dance.
There's Canada, a million companies in
Europe, but what I wanted, what I
needed at the time, was to dance in
New York for the stimulation. There are
so many good dancers. The competition
made it so different from dancing in
Europe. I kind of liked it that way — it
could have been the other way around
— to go from New York to Europe, but I
did it from Europe to New York."
Her voice becomes softer, and more
distant. "I really treasure those years in
Stuttgart — working with Cranko; it
was a very special upbringing. Fie instil
led confidence in his dancers. It was a
very organized place — there was a
sense of just loving to dance that I don't
find in many other places. But, on the
other hand, the competition wasn't as
great, there weren't as many other
good dancers and I find that I dance
better here. Maybe because I know that
if I don't dance well, there are many
other people waiting to do my parts.
I'm very stimulated."
Hadn't she gone to Joffrey first?
"Well, Mr. joffrey would promise he
would be there on Friday and then he'd
promise he'd be there on Monday and
then he'd watch center and say he'd
need to see more."
"I had never planned to audition for
the Ballet Theater. I thought I'd be lost
in the corps de ballet. That's not what I
wanted to do. I thought that loffrey,
being a smaller company, had more
specialized roles that I could work up
to. So I came to see lurgen Schneider
who used to be in Stuttgart."
"Then, Mr. (Anthony) Tudor saw me.
He needed someone to do his ballet;
he was choreographing The Leaves are
Fading and he had another girl in mind.
She was injured and she kept not get
ting better and not getting better and
the ballet was having its premiere soon.
He said he'd give me a three-day trial
basis; I had three days of rehearsal and
so I joined the company.
"Lucia gave me a corps de ballet con
tract and it happened that the company
was about to leave to go to Houston to
premiere Nureyev's Raymonda.
Marianna Icheikassky had hurt her foot;
she had the second leading role and

she suggested to Lucia that I learn it so I
had about a week to get it together. I
learned it very quickly — but it was so
exciting! Nureyev was there, coach
ing, and I was working with him in many
ways. So I went and did that and when
he came back Marianna's foot was bet
ter, but she wanted to save it for Leaves.
"I replaced her in the pas de trois of
Swan Lake and then I did Leaves are
Fading, which is a soloist role. That was
the end of a six-week season that I had
worked there and it was time — Lucia
gives a temporary contract, a sort of
trial contract, for a season and then she
tells you and you resign. I hadn't done
any corps de ballet and she could only
offer me a soloist contract; I said all
right!"
Contracts are renewed every year un
less a dancer is new; then he or she
signs a trial contract for one six-week
season. Kristine works almost 52
weeks, although the contract guaran
tees 36 weeks of work. One of the
reasons she came to New York was to
enjoy seasons of work and then
periodic time off.
"You can give it all you've got be
cause you know you'll be able to do
other things — but it doesn't turn out
that way!" (Union rules require that
dancers be paid overtime if they must
rehearse more than two hours besides
class on the day of a performance or six
hours when not performing.)
Being married aftects her life but she
again serenely said that she's always
had time for eveiylhing, though she
can't bear the touring. When she's
home she "relaxes totally. I'm really
lazy when it comes to anything besides
my dancing. . . When I'm finished with
the theater, I like to leave it. Being mar
ried to somebody who's not a dancer is
very helpful — I don't come home and
talk shop When I was in Los Angeles, I
staved with some musicians and in San
Francisco, with my family. I seek out
other kinds of people — it's a narrow
field.
"Although you have to be a little
fanatical to reach that point of perfec
tion where you can begin to relax and to
enjoy things and much as I love danc
ing, I do feel it's an error to go home
and tocontinue talkingabout just danc
ing." —JULIANNE KOEHNE
