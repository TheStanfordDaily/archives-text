# Every night at the movies
## 
### 
The movies are well rep
resented at Stanford this year
by film series. This quarter of
fers a series on every night of
the week. Many fine films are
being shown, including Citi
zen Kane, and featuring direc
tors who range from Lubitsch
to Kubrick.
The series and some of the
highlights include:
The B'nai B'rith Hillel Found
ation presents the Thursday
Night Flicks, shown at 7:30
p.m. at Cubberley. Tonight
they are showing The Mad Av
entures of Rabbi Jacob, a slight
but engaging comedy.
On Feb. 2, Take the Money
and Run will be featured. The
film stars Woody Allen (direct
ing for the first time) in a very
funny film about poor Woody's
adventures at robbing a bank.
Take the Money is nowhere
near Allen's best, but it is still
enjoyable.
On Feb. 9, The Apprentice
ship of Duddy Kravitz will be
shown. This 1974 Canadian film
is a well-done adaption of the
Mordecai Richler novel. It stars
Richard Dreyfuss (in what is
probably his best perfor
mance) as Duddy, the
schemer-dreamer.
The Producers, Mel Brooks'
first film as a director, will be
shown on Feb. 16. In a brilliant
performance, Zero Mostel
stars as a Broadway producer
who is persuaded that the only
way to make money from the
stage is to make a flop. So he
does, and the opening number
from his designed-flop,
"Springtime for Hitler" is one
of the most inventive and
funny scenes Brooks has ever
done. Gene Wilder stars as a
strange accountant.
The last film of the series is
Ernst Lubitsch's Nazi satire To
Be or Not To Be to be shown
March 9. This 1942 film was
widely regarded as ill-timed,
but it contains Carole Lom
bard's last performance, and in
an unlikely pairing, an excel
lent performance by lack
Benny. Lubitsch's sophisti
cated comic touch is always in
evidence.

Tickets for the Thursday
night series are $2 for general
admission and $1 for students
and senior citizens.
Law School series
On Friday nights, the Stan
ford Law School Film Society
continues its excellent series,
combining old and new Ameri
can films. Tomorrow night they
will show Day of the Jackal,
Fred Zinnemann's (Julia) ver
sion of the Frederick Forsyth
novel. This movie, about an as
sasination attempt on Charles
DeGaulle's life, is probably the
best American thriller of the
decade.
Sidney Lumet's first film,
Twelve Angry Men, is featured

Film

Feb. 3. Lumet has since be
come famous for such films as
Dog Day Afternoon and Net
work, and this 1957 film shows
the traits Lumet has parlayed
into a successful career —
handling actors, tight editing
to heighten suspense. It also
stars Henry Fonda and Lee ).
Cobb.
On Feb. 24, Alfred Hitch
cock's brilliant 1946 film,
Notorious, will be shown.
Pauline Kael has called this film
an "amatory thriller" and she's
right; you're more concerned
about the Cary Grant-lngrid
Bergman relationship than you
are about the plot (which con
tains Hitchcock's most famous
"MacGuffin" — the uranium in
the wine bottles).
An early Stanley Kubrick
film, Paths of Glory, is the at
traction on March 3. This is a
small but brilliant anti-war
film; it is very humanist for
Kubrick. The battle scenes
(done largely by Kubrick with a
hand-held camera) are among
the best ever filmed. With Kirk
Douglas in a very good per
formance.
Director Ernst Lubitsch and
star Greta Garbo combine suc
cessfully in the 1939 comedy,
Ninotchka, to be shown March
10. The film features Lubitsch's
always fine comic touch along
with Garbo's fine performance
as a Russian agent who suc
cumbs to the joys of Paris. With
Melvyn Douglas and Bela
Lugosi.
Admission for the Friday
night films is $1. The films are
shown at Kresge Auditorium.
Check the handbill for show
times.
The Chappie series
On Saturday nights, the
Chaparral has its film series,
with its typical accent on the
sensational (Best of the New

York Erotic Film Festival and
Emmanuelle, for example).
Some of the better films in
clude:
On Jan. 28, John Boorman's
film Deliverance will be fea
tured. The film, which stars
Burt Reynolds, Jon Voigt and
Ned Beatty, is about four men
from the city who take on a
wild river for the sport of it and
find things to be a little more
serious along the way. A well
done suspense-adventure
film.
Sean Connery is James Bond
in Thunderball, the Feb. 25
film. It's a good Bond film, but
go see it to be reminded how
much better Connery is than
Roger Moore as 007.
Last year's surprise film, The
Late Show will be shown March
4. The film is a comedy-mystery
directed with strong flair by
Robert Benton (who co-wrote
the screenplay for Bonnie and
Clyde). Art Carney, in a very
good performance, plays an
aging Bogart-type detective
who is hired by Lily Tomlin to
find her cat, only to find that
the case is slightly more in
volved than that. Tomlin is bril
liant as a kooky, "every day a
new fad" Southern California
woman.
The Chaparral films are
shown at Cubberley. Admis
sion is $1.25; check handbill
for showtimes.
The Flicks
On Sundays, of course, is
the ASSU Flicks. This very
popular series has a weaker
group of films this quarter than
usual, but there are some very
good ones.
One is Mel Brooks' silent tri
bute to Keaton and Chaplin, Si
lent Movie. The film is basically
plotless, but is very funny
nonetheless. The film is built
on the premise: can Brooks
(playing director Mel Funn)
persuade his nearly bankrupt
studio to make a silent movie.
Yes, but only if he can get some
stars. Cameo performances by
Anne Bancroft, Liza Minnelli,
James Caan, Burt Reynolds,
and Paul Newman (in a very
funny bit where he races
around in a wheelchair). The
film will be shown Jan. 29.
John Frankenheimer's excit
ing but flawed thriller, Black
Sunday, starring Robert Shaw,
Marthe Keller and Bruce Dern,
will be featured Feb. 19. This
film from last year did fairly
well with the critics but not at
the box office; people didn't
want to see a film about ter
rorism — it is too close to
home. The plot concerns an at
tempt by Arab terrorists to
blow up the Super Bowl using
the Goodyear blimp. Bruce

Dern gives what is probably his
best performance as the de
ranged American pilot who
aids the terrorists.
On Feb. 26, Annie Hall,
Woody Allen's best film, will
be shown. The film is a semi
autobiographical account of
Allen's relationship with Diane
Keaton. Keaton is fantastic as
the absent-minded funny lady.
The movie is worth the price of
admission just to watch
Keaton's first scene, where she
goes from complete self
assurance to utter confusion,
ending with "well la de da."
All showings for the "Sunday
Flicks are at Memorial Au
ditorium. Tickets are 75 cents

with Stanford ID and $2 with
out ID; check handbill for
showtimes.
'Great Directors'
This quarter's best film series
is the Stanford Film Society's
"Great Directors Series"
shown on Monday nights start
ing at 7 p.m.
On Jan. 23, Sergei Eisens
tein's landmark 1925 film
Potemkin will be shown along
with Ernst Lubritsch'sbest film,
the 1932 Trouble in Paradise.
Potemkin is a largely prop
agandists account of Russia's
Worker's Revolution of 1905. It
is a landmark film because of
Eisenstein's use of the mon
tage technique and for its
