# Anti-cliche comedian Klein
## 'Uh, he ate a lot of toast 
### 
jauntily fluffing his "just
cut hair" and petting the 20
pounds that "aren't the real
me," comedian Robert
Klein entertained the "hip
second-show people" at the
Boarding House last Satur
day night.
Klein is a stand-up
mainstream comedian. He
focuses on the average
American who is caught in
the mainstream of commer
cial life which erodes his
self-determination and
eventually deposits him in a
stagnant pool of clicheism.
Klein jokes about how
people are satisfied to be
trite. They will stop their
search for original phrases if
they can find a hackneyed
one, so common that there
is no doubt that everyone
will understand what they
mean. Klein says that he
never understood half of
them.
"My grandmother always
said, If only these walls
could talk.'
"If only these walls could

talk — what would they say?
" 'Well, uh, the last guy
who lived here, let's see . . .
he ate a lot of toast.' "
Klein says that once
people learn to say or do
something one way, it's
hard to change
"I used to bowl twice a
week and I rented shoes for
50 cents a night. I didn't
want to spend $14 on a pair,
so now I've spent $800 rent
ing them for the last 15 years
— and those shoes are so
smelly that it's as bad as re
nting kleenex.
"TV can mold you, warp
you and then wrench your
guts out.
" Hello, I'm Helen
Hayes. Kom Do Soc is a 14-
year-old Korean boy who
has never eaten. Won't you
help him share this most
human of human experi
ences?'
"I send checks, jewelry,
anything."
Klein himself isversatile;
he elicites ticklish care-free
laughter when he does his

Memory Lane routines and
talks about his childhood
impressions. He mimicks a
child's admiration, saying,
"Horses look so cool the
way they stand with one leg
bent." Then he imitates the
horse.
Between overbearing pa
rental neuroses and un
idirectional persuasions of
TV, Klein foresees a society
in which most interaction is
formally stereotyped.
Klein urges us to be more
natural. He recognizes
some of the traps we fall
into as we get older and
lazier, and he points to orig
inality and more open ex
pression.
"You know the TV com
mercial with the moose
peacefully grazing on the
hill? Suddenly the moose
looks up at the sunset," he
says,"and do you know
why? Because the camera
man just threw a rock at its
head."

Boarding House last Satur
day night.
Klein is a stand-up
mainstream comedian. He
focuses on the average
American who is caught in
the mainstream of commer
cial life which erodes his
self-determination and
eventually deposits him in a
stagnant pool of clicheism.
Klein jokes about how
people are satisfied to be
trite. They will stop their
search for original phrases if
they can find a hackneyed
one, so common that there
is no doubt that everyone
will understand what they
mean. Klein says that he
never understood half of
them.
"My grandmother always
said, If only these walls
could talk.'
"If only these walls could

talk — what would they say?
" 'Well, uh, the last guy
who lived here, let's see . . .
he ate a lot of toast.' "
Klein says that once
people learn to say or do
something one way, it's
hard to change
"I used to bowl twice a
week and I rented shoes for
50 cents a night. I didn't
want to spend $14 on a pair,
so now I've spent $800 rent
ing them for the last 15 years
— and those shoes are so
smelly that it's as bad as re
nting kleenex.
"TV can mold you, warp
you and then wrench your
guts out.
" Hello, I'm Helen
Hayes. Kom Do Soc is a 14-
year-old Korean boy who
has never eaten. Won't you
help him share this most
human of human experi
ences?'
"I send checks, jewelry,
anything."
Klein himself isversatile;
he elicites ticklish care-free
laughter when he does his

Memory Lane routines and
talks about his childhood
impressions. He mimicks a
child's admiration, saying,
"Horses look so cool the
way they stand with one leg
bent." Then he imitates the
horse.
Between overbearing pa
rental neuroses and un
idirectional persuasions of
TV, Klein foresees a society
in which most interaction is
formally stereotyped.
Klein urges us to be more
natural. He recognizes
some of the traps we fall
into as we get older and
lazier, and he points to orig
inality and more open ex
pression.
"You know the TV com
mercial with the moose
peacefully grazing on the
hill? Suddenly the moose
looks up at the sunset," he
says,"and do you know
why? Because the camera
man just threw a rock at its
head."

jauntily fluffing his "just
cut hair" and petting the 20
pounds that "aren't the real
me," comedian Robert

second-show people" at the
