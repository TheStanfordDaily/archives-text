# 'Works II'
## Records Spread too thin? 
### 
Early last year, Keith
Emerson,Greg Lake and
Carl Palmer released their
finest effort to date, Works
Volume One. Much of this
collection's success is due
to the group's diversity in
style. Works Volume Two
also demonstrates EL&P's
diversity, but it carries this
too far.

The pieces in Works 11,
which vary from jazz to
progressive rock to
honky-tonk ragtime, are
very short — most averag
ing only four minutes. In
past efforts, the group has
shown its talents best in
longer, sustained compos
itions, often lasting an en
tire album side. In addi
tion, many of these pieces
incorporated the different
styles of the group into the
same work.
In Works 11, the short
ness of the pieces does not
allow the listener to fully
appreciate them. Further,
the ordering of the works
on each side is too
choppy; honky-tonk leads
to a classical-type piece,

then to jazz, then back to
honky-tonk.
Each composition
stands well on its own.
Most notable among the
selections are Emerson's
Barrelhouse Shakedown; I
Believe in Father Christ
mas by Lake and his
longtime collaborator,
Peter Sinfield; and So Far
To Fall by Emerson, Lake
and Sinfield.
Where they were
Father Christmas and
another piece, Honky
Tonk Train Blues, were
previously released as
singles, and Brain Salad
Surgery, the elusive song
sharing the same name as
their fifth album, has ap
peared on bootlegged
concert albums.
Perhaps the entire
album is a set of songs that
never found its way onto
any of EL&P's previous al
bums, much like the
Who's Odds and Sods.
Nonetheless, this set of
works is at least deserving
of better packaging.
