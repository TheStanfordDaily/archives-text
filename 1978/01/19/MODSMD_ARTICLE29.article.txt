# 'Voices,
## from the left 
### 
Stanford's Department of
Music will be host to the San
Francisco Contemporary Music
Players, conducted by Jean-
Louis Le Roux, in a perfor
mance of "Voices" by Hans
Werner Henze at 8 p.m. Jan.
29, in Dinkelspiel.
Henze's full length composi
tion is an extraordinary collec
tion of 22 songs, settings of
Henze's personal anthology of
poems by many different au
thors — Italian, German, Cu
ban, Chinese, American —
ranging from Heinrich Heine
Bertolt Brecht to contem
oorary black American poets.
Scored for mezzo-soprano,
tenor and 18 musicians playing
more than 70 instruments, the
work dates from 1973 and re
ceived its world premiere — to
an enthusiastic reception — in
London in 1974.
Soprano Claudia Cummings
and tenor )ohn Duykers will be
soloists in the Jan. 29 perfor
mance.
Henze is a political com
poser with strong left-wing
sympathies, as the text of "Voi
ces" reveals. He says: "Choice
of the poems and the order in
which they are arranged reflect
my own personal political
perspective and emotional in
volvement, and it is this
perspective and these feelings
which give the cycle its cohe
sion."
The variety of idioms and

political sentiments expressed
in the poems (which include
one by Ho Chi Minh) have in
turn influenced Henze's eclec
tic use of musical idioms. "In
some cases, I wanted to use
highly developed post
serialistic structures ... (in
others), more direct means of
expression include jazz, aleat
ory and elements of music the
ater; . . . also I tried to extend
the Weill-Eissler-Dessau tradi
tion into my own style. . ."
"Voices" is exciting visually
as well as musically. It requires
a great deal of versatility on the
part of the instrumentalists,
who at one point in the score
are referred to as the "cast."
Orchestration is different for
each song. The violinist plays
the mandolin; the cellist a tin
whistle.

In one song all the men in
the orchestra form a close
harmony choir.
"But," as one London critic
noted, "its spectacular ele
ment, its visual fantasy, is de
signed only to make the total
experience the more powerful,
to express in large and lumin
ous letters the composer's
political bitterness and en
thusiasms, and shouldn't be al
lowed to obscure the purely
musical substance. It goes
further than any of Henze's
earlier works towards speaking
a language which, if not exactly
'popular,' is at least vividly in
telligible."

cians dedicated to performing

more than 70 instruments, the
work dates from 1973 and re
ceived its world premiere — to
an enthusiastic reception — in
London in 1974.
Soprano Claudia Cummings

soloists in the Jan. 29 perfor
mance.
Henze is a political com
poser with strong left-wing
sympathies, as the text of "Voi
ces" reveals. He says: "Choice
of the poems and the order in
which they are arranged reflect
my own personal political
perspective and emotional in
volvement, and it is this
perspective and these feelings
which give the cycle its cohe
sion."
The variety of idioms and

political sentiments expressed
in the poems (which include
one by Ho Chi Minh) have in
turn influenced Henze's eclec
tic use of musical idioms. "In
some cases, I wanted to use
highly developed post
serialistic structures ... (in
others), more direct means of
expression include jazz, aleat
ory and elements of music the
ater; . . . also I tried to extend
the Weill-Eissler-Dessau tradi
tion into my own style. . ."
"Voices" is exciting visually
as well as musically. It requires
a great deal of versatility on the
part of the instrumentalists,
who at one point in the score
are referred to as the "cast."
Orchestration is different for
each song. The violinist plays
the mandolin; the cellist a tin
whistle.

In one song all the men in
the orchestra form a close
harmony choir.
"But," as one London critic
noted, "its spectacular ele
ment, its visual fantasy, is de
signed only to make the total
experience the more powerful,
to express in large and lumin
ous letters the composer's
political bitterness and en
thusiasms, and shouldn't be al
lowed to obscure the purely
musical substance. It goes
further than any of Henze's
earlier works towards speaking
a language which, if not exactly
'popular,' is at least vividly in
telligible."
The San Francisco Contem
porary Music Players — co
directed by Marcella DeCray
and Jean-Louis Le Roux — are a
group of professional musi
cians dedicated to performing
rarely heard contemporary
music.
Tickets are $2 general, $1

Stanford's Department of
Music will be host to the San
Francisco Contemporary Music
Players, conducted by Jean-
Louis Le Roux, in a perfor
mance of "Voices" by Hans
Werner Henze at 8 p.m. Jan.
29, in Dinkelspiel.
Henze's full length composi
tion is an extraordinary collec
tion of 22 songs, settings of
Henze's personal anthology of
poems by many different au
thors — Italian, German, Cu
ban, Chinese, American —
ranging from Heinrich Heine
Bertolt Brecht to contem
oorary black American poets.
Scored for mezzo-soprano,
tenor and 18 musicians playing
more than 70 instruments, the
work dates from 1973 and re
ceived its world premiere — to
an enthusiastic reception — in
London in 1974.
