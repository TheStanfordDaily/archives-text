# The 						art of jammin'
## 
### 
Jazz, it could be argued, is to
be found in its purest form at a
jam session. Here the em
phasis is on improvisation, and
the (sometimes) friendly com
petition between the musi
cians oftens spurs them on to
exceptional performances.
A new eight-album set from
Pablo, The Art of the lam Ses
sion, goes a long way toward
proving this contention. The
album features stellar perfor
mances from several of Pablo's
impressive line-up of jazz
musicians: Dizzy Gillespie,
Oscar Peterson, Count Basie,
Mi't Jackson.
Norman Granz, producer of
Pablo records has been famous
for recording jam sessions in
great numbers, often in com
plete disregard of the musi
cians stylistic roots. (Who else
would put Lester Young, Char
lie Parker and Ben Webster on
the same stage?) During his te
nure at Verve Records Granz
recorded countless jam ses
sions under the name "Jazz at
the Philharmonic." The JATP
recordings have not worn well
with the passingyears, partially
because of the diversity of
musical styles and also because
of their sheer bulk. Certainly a
good jazz musician should be
able to solo on almost any tune
and produce a variety of in
terpretations; yet it is another
thing to expect the poor fan to
wade through all the music to
find the few gems that make
the jam session worthwhile.
Despite these problems, The
Art of the lam Session fares
well in holding the listener'sat
tention. The performance of
Oscar Peterson is particularly
noteworthy; featured on four
of theeight albums, his work is
constantly swinging and intel
ligent. On the bop- standard
"Donna Lee," Peterson begins
with a typical bop approach
and elevates it into an unbe
lievably fast interpretation

which transcends the form.
Other excellent perfor
mances are contributed by the
bassist Niels Orsted-Pedersen,
Milt lackson and Dizzy Gilles
pie. Since the dissolution of
the Modern jazz Quartet,
Jackson has been playing his
best in years. He is co-featured
with Ray Brown on one of the
jam sessions and contributes
several excellent solos, an ex
tremely engaging one on the
number "Red Top."
The highlight of the set,
however, is the concluding
album which features Oscar
Peterson playing with two of
the great bassists of our time:
Pedersen and Ray Brown. The
album provides an excellent
opportunity for comparing two
greatly different approaches to
