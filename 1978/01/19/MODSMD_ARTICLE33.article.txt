an often over-looked instru

Pedersen is a virtuoso of the
highest order (he recorded
with Bud Powell before he was
15) and his playing is full of fast
runs and intricate ornamenta
tion. Brown, in contrast, al
ways chooses the ingenious
over the flashy and his playing
remains interesting without
being elaborate. Brown's
biggest asset lies in the rich,
full tone which he produces on
the bass. He is one of the few
bassists who could play with
Oscar Peterson and still stand
out amidst the avalanche of
pianistic acrobatics.
The boxed set, all of which
was recorded at the past Mon
treux festival, is also available
in single albums. As a whole it
is an excellent sampling of the
very illustrious Pablo label, and
an indication of finer things to
come from several of the musi
cians.
