The efforts of a U.C.-Berkeley frater
nity to wreak vengeance after Stan
ford's victory in the Big Came have
backfired.
The incident began when the
rickshaw used by Stanford Band drum
major )im )ett for his entrance and half
time activities was taken after the foot
ball game by members of the Berkeley
chapter of Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity.
During an attempt by Jett and
another band member to recover the
chariot, a truck chaseensued, resulting
in an accident between the Stanford
vehicle and another car and a suit being
filed against the driver of the Stanford
vehicle.
Jett said that he and Bill Boone,
another Stanford Band member, acting
on a tip, went to the Berkeley Phi Kappa
Sigma house on Nov. 28 in an effort to
recover the rickshaw. Jett also said that
the members of the fraternity initially
denied any knowledge of the
rickshaw's whereabouts and sent them
to look in other houses.
Jett and Boone's search led them
back to Phi Kappa Sigma where they
discovered the rickshaw locked to a
couch with a bicycle cable. They re
scued the rickshaw and took it to
Boone's truck parked outside.
Jett said that as they drove away they
were followed by an orange truck carry
ing several people. After a short time,
the truck cut in front of them. A few of
the passengers jumped out and ap
proached Boone's vehicle, Jett said.
In trying to drive around the orange
truck, Boone's truck was hit from be
hind by another car. The orange
truck and its passengers left im

mediately, said Jett.
Following a police investigation of
the accident, Boone and Jett returned
the rickshaw to its owner.
According to Jett, the rickshaw was
damaged at the fraternity house. The
owner, Bob Shalar of San Francisco,
said repairs, including replacing the
rickshaw's silk covering, would cost
$300.
John Symes, president of Phi Kappa
Sigma, appeared before a Berkeley
judiciary committee meeting last week.
The committee held the fraternity re
sponsible for taking the rickshaw and
gave Symes one week to deal with the
parties involved to come to a monetary
settlement. If Symes has not arranged
an agreement by tomorrow, the com
mittee has said they will have the
fraternity pay the full $300.
According to Ann Hawley, assistant
director of student activities and prog
rams at Berkeley, Symes said that Jett
said the actual amount of the damages
is only $50 and that the fraternity should
not pay more than that. Symes planned
to speak to Shalar about this during the
week.
Symes refused to comment on the
matter.
Hawley said that both universities
recognize that occurrences of this kind
may take place during the annual Big
Game, but that any parties involved
should be held accountable for any
damages.
The driver of the other vehicle in the
accident filed suit yesterday against Bill
Boone, claiming $430 in damages. The
damage done to Boone's car totalled
$400. The rickshaw did not receive
further damage during the accident.
