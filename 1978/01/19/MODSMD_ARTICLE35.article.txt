# Egypt-Israel talks broken off; minister recalled

Jerusalem (AP) — Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat dramat
ically broke off talks with Israel
yesterday, called his foreign
minister back to Cairo and ac
cused the Israelis of deliber
ately blocking progress toward
a Middle East peace.
The sudden move by the
Egyptian leader cast a pall over
the future of historic Egyptian-
Israeli peace negotiations
begun at Sadat's initiative last
November.
There was no immediate Is
raeli comment on the de

velopment. The Israeli cabinet
rushed into special session.
State Department spokes
man Hodding Carter said "It
means for the moment that the
talks will not continue. I'm not
going to assess it beyond that."
Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance, who has been attempt
ing to bridge the gaps between
Israel and Egypt in private talks
with the negotiators, told re
porters he does not believe the
talks have broken down.
"I've been through a lot of
international negotiations. I've

seen ups and downs in the
past," Vance said.
But Egypt's announcement
caught Vance by surprise. He
was planning to give a dinner
for Egyptian Foreign Minister
Mohammed Kamel last night.
The talks between the Israeli
and Egyptian foreign ministers,
the highest level negotiations
between the two countries so
far, began Tuesday and soon
were deeply divided over
Palestinian rights to a home
land and Israel's 11-year occu
pation of Arab lands.

The talks were "continuing
in a vicious cycle," Egyptian In
formation Minister Abdel
Moneim el Savvy said in an
nouncing the breakoff on
Cairo television.
Sawy said Sadat ordered
Kamel to return "immediately"
because "it became apparent
from the declarations of Israeli
leaders that Israel insists on
presenting partial solutions
that cannot lead to the estab
lishment of a just and lasting
peace."

Sawy, his face grave as he
read the recall statement over
Egyptian television, said
Egypt's demands — for total Is
raeli withdrawal from Arab
lands and self determination
for the Palestinians — have not
changed.
Sawy said Sadat has called an
emergency session of the
Peoples' Assembly, Egypt's
parliament, for Saturday to
"place before the representa
tives of the people all the facts
of the situation."
