# Lederberg leaving; Walsh may stay
## 
### David Georgette 
Joshua Lederberg, Nobel Laureate
and chairman of the department of
genetics at the Medical School, has
been elected president of Rockefeller
University in New York City.
Lederberg is the university's fifth
president and is succeeding Frederick
Seitz who retired in 1976 but has con
tinued in office while the search for
the new president was being com
pleted.
Lederberg, 52, is one of the pioneers
in the field of the genetics of microor
ganisms and has been partly responsi
ble for its development into a com
prehensive field of research.
Rockefeller University is devoted
exclusively to research, postdoctoral
training and graduate training in the
biological and biomedical sciences
and in the related behavioral, physical
and mathematical sciences.
Lederberg is a native of Montclair,
New Jersey. He attended Columbia
and Yale Universities and won a 1958
Nobel Prize "for studies on organiza
tion of the genetic material in bac
teria."
He taught for 12 years at the Univer
sity of Wisconsin before coming to the
Medical School here in 1959. In addi
tion to his chairmanship, Lederberg
has related responsibilities for re
search programs in instrumentation,
computers for laboratory use and in
the study of artificial intelligence, and
the detection of life on other planets.

Stanford football coach Bill Walsh
indicated last night that he does not
expect to leave Stanford to become
head coach of the Los Angeles Rams of
the National Football League.
Walsh said his visit with Rams'
owner Carroll Rosenbloom was "an in
teresting, engaging visit" and "infor
mative to both sides," but, he added,
"I'm not sure I'll see them again."
"There's always a remote chance,"
Walsh said, "but I'm not sure this will
go any further. I don't see anything
coming out of it that would mean I'd
be changing jobs. I honestly preferred
not to take it any further."
"I don't regret the meeting," he
said. "This is something I had to look
into. It's difficult not to flirt with some
thing like that. The financial end is al
most shocking." The Rams' new coach
is expected to receive a six-figure con
tract plus fringe benefits from media
shows.
"The door is still open," Walsh con
ceded, "but I'm not waiting by the
phone for a call. As far as Stanford's
concerned, this thing will be resolved
by early next week." He did not think,
however, the Rams' search for a now
head coach would be resolved by that
time.
Rosenbloom said Saturday, "I don't
talk to a man just once before I hire
him. We have said for publication that
it will take two or three weeks to make
a decisionâ€”if we make one that soon."
