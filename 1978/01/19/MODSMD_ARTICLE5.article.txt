# THE 						CHEMISTRY CORE—

/' Deople are scared to
I death of chemistry,"
says senior Loretta McQuaid, a
them major.
"Historically, chemistry has
always been considered a hard
subject," say* Chemistry Lec
turer lames LuValle.
No matter whom you ask,
people will tell you there's a
certain mystique to chemistry
here. And there are an assort
ment of facts to bear that view
out.
Last fall, for example, the
Learning Assistance Center
conducted 155 tutoring ses
sions, with 46 percent of those
sessions being for chemistry.
Some 59 of those requests
were for Chem 31 (first quarter
chemistry) alone.
In fall 1976, chemistry drew
an even larger share of tutor
ing. Of 213 tutoring sessions,
52 percent were for chemistry.
And although tutoring re
quests decline in winter and
spring quarters, chem still
draws far more sessions than
any other field, according to
LAC Tutoring Coordinator Sal
lie Kueny.
„ And while some students opt
for tutoring, many more drop
out of the chem sequence. In
fall 1976, 804 persons com
pleted Chem 31. As the series
progressed, registrar's statis
tics show that 656 persons
finished Chem 33 in winter
1977, 506 finished Chem 35 in
spring 1977, and 188 finished
Chem 131 last quarter.
"If a student gets a couple
C's, he may decide Perhaps
there's another subject I'd do
better in,' " Chemistry Prof.
Harry Mosher said.
"Quite a few people start 31
and don't make it to 135," said
junior Dave McFarland, a pre
med history major. "I put a lot
of the blame on the depart
ment."
And the students who do
stick out the organic chem
series are far from enthusiastic
about it. Chemistry courses
have drawn ratings in the ASSU
Course Guide which are con
sistently worse than those for
other classes. When Asst.
Chemistry Prof. Keith Hodgson
taught Chem 131 in the fall
1975, the Course Guide wrote:
"Although the overall value of
this course was rated below
average, the instructor was
considered by many to be the
best in the Chemistry Depart
ment."
Most of the ratings pub
lished in the Course Guide this
academic year are based on the
1975-76 versions of the
courses, Mosher pointed out.
He said courses have improved
since then.
But Mosher acknowledged
that many students have com
plaints about the chemistry
program here. "Chemistry
does suffer in comparison to,
say, history or psychology," he
said. "It's easier to give brilliant
lectures in those fields, while
you just don't give brilliant lec
tures in chemistry, you pound
something home."
The large size of chemistry
core classes also has an ad
verse effect on teaching qual
ity, Mosher said.
Asst Chemistry Prof. Wray
Huestis said most of the stu
dents who take chemistry
courses do so because the
c lasses are required by another
department. As a result, she
said, "We've had placed upon
us a burden we did not wel
come, and that is of teaching
students who walk in the clas
sroom and think they're not in
terested in chemistry. We find
it very much of a challenge to
show them that they're wrong,
and I think we have succeeded
in a good many cases.
"Also, I believe it's a matter
of documented fact that the
chemistry department grades a
bit tougher than other depart
ments do," she said. "Obvi-

A subject for study

ously, this has an adverse affect
on student opinion."
Stanford chem profs have
major research commitments,
Mosher said, and "if you get a
faculty that is pre-eminent in
research, you're not going to
get people who are that in
terested in teaching on an un
dergraduate level."
"There's personal variabil
ity," Huestis said. "There are
some faculty members who
care very deeply about their
undergraduates, and there are
others, who while they want to
do well in teaching, do not
have their hearts completely in
it."
Senior )ohn Shield, a chemi
cal engineering major, also
said he saw variability in pro
fessors' attitudes. He first de
clared that chem profs "care
only about their graduate stu
dents," but added, "That's a
very strong statement. There
are exceptions."
Scott Peeples, a sophomore
in biology, said chemistry profs
"don't really care about stu
dents. They love to see people
suffer, it seems like."
McFarland said he changed
his mind on how chem profs
viewed their students after he
served on an informal faculty/
student committee looking at
possible changes in the
chemistry curriculum.
"After talking to some of the
professors, I was really impre
ssed with their attitudes,"
McFarland said. "Their attitude
in class is not their attitude in
committee. You sometimes
hear that chem profs think stu
dents are just a bunch of pre
med cut-throats who are not
interested in chemistry. Well,
that didn't seem to be their at
titude. They seemed interested
in improving the system and
interested in students."
McFarland said that he and
McQuaid were two of about
five students who met with a
similar number of professors
several times last spring and
fall. Some of the informal
committee's reforms have al
ready been implemented, he
noted, with others to follow.
A freshman seminar may be
added next year, McFarland
said, for persons who didn't
have any chemistry in high
school, and might otherwise
be underprepared for Chem
.31. A change already made was
to add sections for Chem 131
and 135, he said, where none
existed previously.
The committee also worked
to standardize different pro
fessors' versions of the same
course in the organic sequ
ence, McFarland said.
"It's a real concern of stu
dents that all three sections (of
a course in the organic sequ
ence) are not at the same level
of difficulty, nor do they cover
the same amount of material,"
Mosher said.
Because they come from dif
ferent Chem 33 sections,
"some students in Chem 35
have a breeze, while some get
murdered on the nomencla
ture," Shield said.
Professors who teach core
courses now all work from the
same outlines, Mosher said.
"That way, no matter which
section a student is in, he'll
cover the same material as
someone in another section."
Under consideration are
proposals to add an advanced
track of Chem 31 for freshman
with solid high school chemis
try backgrounds, and to bitur
cate the first quarter chem lab
into a lab tor majors and
another for nonmajors.
But these distinctions are tar
less controversial than a much
simpler one: who gets A sand
who doesn't.
McQuaid recalled thai some
classmates in her core courses
"were only willing to disc uss
medians and grading. I've
never heard such an amount ot

talk about medians. Only when
I got in classes with majors was
I able to discuss chemistry."
Much of this pressure is im
posed by premeds' perception
of what it will take to get into
medical school, Mosher said.
"It's very commonly said that
chemistry screens out students
for medical school," he re
marked. "As long as only one
in three persons who applied
to medical school gets in,
there's noway but that chemis
try is going to be very competi
tive."
One junior who transferred
here last fall said she found
chemistry students "heavily
competitive," and has
switched her major out of
chemistry.
"A lot of the prerneds are ter
ribly competitive," said lec
turer LuValle. "They look at the
curve, and all they want to
know is 'Where's the A?' "
LuValle coordinates the
chem labs, said by some to be
the most competitive part of
chemistry here. One junior
who took Chem 132 (the sec
ond quarter lab for majors) last
quarter, said many persons in

the class
believed "if
they don't
get through
that class,
they won't
go to med
school.
There's so
much pres
sure in
volved that
you don't
have time
to enjoy the
class. I
think
LuValle ex
pects too
much from
the stu
dents. He
tends to
scare
people."
LuValle
said he re
cently
talked to a
student

who took chem lab last quar
ter. "She said she almost
dropped the course after my
first lecture, when I told the
students what was expected of
them," he recalled. "But she
stuck it out, and ended up get
ting an A-minus."
LuValle said his lecture on

the first day of Chem 132 or 130
(the second quarter lab course
for nonmajors) "is just a matter
of letting students know
what's expected of them. It's
not a matter of trying to scare
anyone."
Nonetheless, the Chemistry
Department has received peti
tions from students asking that
Chem 36 and 130 be changed
to mandatory pass/no credit to
reduce academic pressure.
These petitions have been
rejected, Mosher said. "The
faculty feels that students
wouldn't really learn the mate
rial if students didn't have to
work for a grade," he
explained. "Instead, they'd do
the minimum amount."
Medical schools would
much rather see grades for or
ganic chem labs than a pass,
said Chemistry Prof. Richard
Eastman. Furthermore,
Eastman said he believed a
student "has the right to earn a
grade.
"If my son came home over
Christmas and told me Dad, I
really creamed that chem lab,
and all I've got is a pass to show
for it,' I'd write that chem prof

a letter and ask him what the
hell is going on," Eastman said.
Many students said luck
plays a role in determining
chem lab grades. One major
component of these'grades is
the ability to identify several
unknown compounds, and
some students will be issued

easier unknowns than other
students, they say.
"Every now and then, some
student will luck out," LuValle
acknowledged. "But that hap
pens so infrequently."
Students also complained
about the difficulty of the
problem sets in 130 and 132.
"Some of the problems are so
hard that they don't teach you
to do anything except to go to
the TAs for help," one junior
said.
LuValle said some problems
may be too demanding, but
said many students also do not
prepare fully.
One problem LuValle said
he saw with Chem 130 is that
many persons will start the
course as sophomores, drop
it, and take it over as seniors.
They then have trouble brush
ing up on organic chemistry
covered two years previously,
and, if they are premeds, may
miss labs because of med
school interviews,
"All we can do is put up a big
sign saying 'This course should

not be attempted by seniors
going on interviews,' " he
said.
But even if LuValle's sign is
printed tomorrow, it's not
going to change the Chemistry
Department in any radical way.
In fact, both students and fa
culty seem to believe chemis
try's problems here are inhe
rent, making only minor
changes possible.
Professors seem to feel they
are constrained by having to
teach primarily premeds
whose main interests seldom
include chemistry.
Students seem to feel they
are constrained by having to
be taught by instructors whose
main interest often isn't un
dergraduate teaching.
And regardless of how much
truth there is to either view, it
appears nearly certain that
chem students will continue to
write negative course reviews
and to hunt down drop cards
and tutors.
