# Organic chem-a divergence
## 
### 
At nearly all colleges in the United States,
undergraduates go through a year of general
chemistry before starting organic chem.
Stanford used to do it that way too. But for
the past few years, students have been re
ceiving one quarter of general chemistry
(Chem 31) followed by a year-long sequence
of organic.
It's a system that draws far more com
plaints than priase. "I didn't like it at all,"
declared sophomore Scott Peeples, a biology
major. "I didn't feel I was prepared for or
ganic by 31."
"As a chem major, I would have preferred
it if there had been more general chemistry
before organic," said senior Loretta
McQuaid.
According to Chemistry Prof. Harry
Mosher, 90 percent of those who start the
( hemistry sequence do so because they need
chemistry as a prerequisite before taking
biology classes.
We've really rearranged the program to
accommodate them," he said.
Asst. Chemistry Prof. Wray Huestis agreed,
saying the change was "supposedly a re
sponse to the pain of the biologically
oriented student at being inflicted with so
much inorganic chemistry before starting or
ganic chem."
Bio Prof. Dow Woodward recalled that the
change was made about five years ago, fol
lowing complaints from biology majors in the
chemistry sequence. "The chemistry de
partment came to us and said, 'We've had a
lot of criticism by these people and we feel
our curriculum ought to reflect something of
their interests." "
The revision in chemistry enabled the biol
ogy department to invert the order of its
core, Woodward said. Biology could begin
with molecular biology (a chemistry
intensive subject) and proceed to population
biology, instead of the reverse order. Some

regard this as an improvement, Woodward
said; others do not.
"I think it would have been better to have
had one more quarter of inorganic," said
senior Arthur Liu, a biology major. "For stan
dardized tests like the MCATs and dental
tests, you need a lot more inorganic."
One human biology major who requested
anonymity said he didn't see any reason to
offer organic chemistry so early because
"sixth grade chemistry is all you need for
human bio."
Ken Doxsee, a senior in chemistry, said he
felt he would have understood more of the
principles behind organic chemistry if Stan
ford offered a full year of general chemistry
before organic.
Peeples, referring to the three-quarter or
ganic chemistry sequence, said, "It seemed
like all three of those classes were memoriza
tion. I'll probably forget it all by next year."
The ordering of Stanford's sequence appa
rently causes some confusion for profes
sional schools. "I spent the first halt hour of
my med school interview trying to explain to
them what the different names of the chem
courses meant," recalled senior Rick Cas
tillo, a human bio major. "They couldn't un
derstand why I d only taken five quarters of
chemistry."
Mosher, who heads the Chemistry De
partment's undergraduate studies commit
tee, said he has periodically heard proposals
that the department one e more offer a year of
general chemistry before starting the organic
sequence. But these have been "dropped
pretty rapidly," he said.
So for the present and near future, it looks
as if Stanford freshmen, who can not buy
liquor either on or off campus, will at least be
able to continue studying Grignard reacto
ions.
