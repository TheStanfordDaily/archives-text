In the Thursday of October 20, 1977, I reported that two
time Nohel laureate Linus Pauling, in collaboration with Dr.
Ewan Cameron, Chief Consultant Surgeon of the Vale of
Leven Hospital in Loch Lomondside, Scotland, found that
100 "untreatable" cancer patients receiving 10 grams of vita
min C per day lived an average of four times longer than 1000
patients who received no vitamin C, and that some are still
alive five years after being pronounced untreatable. Most are
in such apparent good health as to suggest they now have
normal life expectancy. All of the patients who received no
vitamin C are dead.
Since I talked with Dr. Pauling on July 28, 1977, additional
information has come to light. The following consists of
previously overlooked facts, expansions on what has been
said, and new developments.
—I reported Dr. Pauling's estimate that the age-specific
incidence of and mortality from cancer could be decreased
by 50 per cent by use of vitamin C. His current prediction is
that "a decrease of 75 per cent can be achieved by use of
vitamin C alone, and a further decrease by use of other
nutritional measures."
—Patients with advanced cancer have now received up to
50 grams of vitamin C per day both intravenously and orally,
and Dr. Pauling says that . . there is some evidence that
the larger intakes are considerably more effective than the
intake of 10 grams per day."
—For the second straight year, Prevention, one of the
leading health magazines in the United States, presented its
"greatest contribution" award to vitamin C "for its role in
cancer prevention."
