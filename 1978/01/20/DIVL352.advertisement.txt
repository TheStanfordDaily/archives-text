Today's problems are complex, the search demanding. Los Alamos
Scientific Laboratory is committed to the concept that America's great
est resource lies in its people.
Los Alamos is not looking for employees with assembly-line imagin
ation, but those who will dare to question the obvious, and reach for
dreams yet undreamed.
Our special search is for innovative, safe sources of energy created
through our Laboratory's brainpower: energy alternatives such as
• Laser Fusion
• Magnetic Fusion
• Geothermal
• Solar
• and others still in the conceptual stage
It's your future! Make your mark with us.
Los Alamos representatives will be conducting interviews Friday,
January 27, 1978 at the Career Planning and Placement Center, White
Memorial Plaza, or write to:
