# Shockley: role of genetics in I.Q.
## 
### Jon Hornsby 
Since Nobel Laureate William Shockey re
tired from teaching here in October 1975, he
has focused his attention on whgt he says is
society's "moral obligation to diagnose the
American Negro tragedy of statistical I.Q. de
ficit."
Though he will soon travel to Norway to lec
ture on his 1956 Nobel Prize-willing co
invention of the transistor, he said in a recent
interview from his Stanford home that his re
search has lately concentrated on the genetic
inheritability of I.Q.
Over the past decade, Shockley has received
much criticism for his genetic research. He has
been labeled a racist by many for his theory that
lower I.Q.'s of blacks may be genetic in origin.
He said he now has to devote time to public
relations to make sure he is more clearly under
stood.
Renewed interest in his research motives was
sparked last month when The New York Times
reported that Shockley had received $179,000
over the last 10 years from the Pioneer Fund, a
private foundation devoted to research into
"racial betterment."
Shockley expressed little concern over this
funding, saying that if he could get the funds,
he would.
But he said he is having trouble keeping his
tax-exempt research fund out of the red. "It's
been operating on funds that I've been loaning
it," he said.
If he were to continue his personal support
and accept money from the Pioneer Fund, he
said he'd be "in trouble."
"It wouldn't get the benefits of being a so
called non-private foundation," a class which

Shockley speculated benefits issues which "re
flect the public interests."
He has said in the past that his goal in re
search is an "objective inquiry" into whether,
as he believes is the case, there is occuring a
"genetic deterioration in the potential for intel
ligence" among blacks.
Earl Cilley, director of the University's spon
sored projects office, which audited the money
from the Pioneer Fund when Shockley was at
Stanford, emphasized the emeritus professor's
right to research despite the prevailing opin
ions toward it.
A 1971 statement on research by the
Academic Council said the University should
foster research regardless of "speculations
concerning the political or moral impropriety
of the uses which might be made of its results."
Cilley said Shockley had been very conscien
tious in following the University's guidelines
for research.
Shockley reacted to the recent disclosures
about the Pioneer Fund by writing letters at
tempting to justify his research to newspapers.
He said, "Babies born with an unfair shake
from a badly loaded parental dice cup (no mat
ter whether black, white or other) will be genet
ically enslaved.
"If my opinion is proven true, wise treatment
can be sought. If proven wrong, the new scien
tific facts will help to counter prejudice."
He said he believes diagnostic tools exist to
find the truth.
Visiting professor of genetics v ßichard
Goldsby has another opinion.
Goldsby said, "There is research methodol
ogy that gives one impressions of the genetic
inheritability of 1.Q.," but he added, "There is

really no data that could be delivered in a single
stroke or in multiple strokes to prove
Shockley's theory."
The black geneticist often debates Shockley,
taking the stance that the environment a child is
raised in is the most important factor in de
veloping I.Q.
Coldsby emphasized the "incredibly com
plex number of factors involved in this pro
cess."
Goldsby supported Shockley's right to his
research and said he felt it had not been sup
pressed.
In 1972, former Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Lincoln Moses, vetoed a faculty advis
ory committee vote to allow Shockley to teach a
course on dysgenics (retrogressive evolution
through excessive birthrate of the genetically
disadvantaged) on the grounds that he was un
qualified.
Goldsby's view of Shockley's competence
was "an individual who can do solid-state
physics should have no difficulty in mastering
chromosomal and population genetics; how
ever, people who have devqted their lives to it,
like Professors (Marcus) Feldman and (Luigi)
Cavalli-Storza, have disagreed."
Shockley compares the "wishful thinking
egalitarianism of our nation" to the "intellec
tual atmosphere of Hitler's Nazi Germany."
Goldsby said he didn't think that many
people in the country are as "viscerally egalita
rian" as Shockley charged.
"I wish they were," he said.
"But," he added, "if we gave everyone a lie
detector test and asked if they really believed
'All men are created equal,' I wonder how many
people would register yes?"

Coldsby emphasized the "incredibly com
plex number of factors involved in this pro
cess."
Goldsby supported Shockley's right to his
research and said he felt it had not been sup
pressed.
In 1972, former Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Lincoln Moses, vetoed a faculty advis
ory committee vote to allow Shockley to teach a
course on dysgenics (retrogressive evolution
through excessive birthrate of the genetically
disadvantaged) on the grounds that he was un
qualified.
Goldsby's view of Shockley's competence
was "an individual who can do solid-state
physics should have no difficulty in mastering
chromosomal and population genetics; how
ever, people who have devqted their lives to it,
like Professors (Marcus) Feldman and (Luigi)
Cavalli-Storza, have disagreed."
Shockley compares the "wishful thinking
egalitarianism of our nation" to the "intellec
tual atmosphere of Hitler's Nazi Germany."
Goldsby said he didn't think that many
people in the country are as "viscerally egalita
rian" as Shockley charged.
"I wish they were," he said.
"But," he added, "if we gave everyone a lie
detector test and asked if they really believed
'All men are created equal,' I wonder how many
people would register yes?"


William Shockley
Since Nobel Laureate William Shockey re
tired from teaching here in October 1975, he
has focused his attention on whgt he says is
society's "moral obligation to diagnose the
American Negro tragedy of statistical I.Q. de
ficit."
Though he will soon travel to Norway to lec
ture on his 1956 Nobel Prize-willing co
invention of the transistor, he said in a recent
interview from his Stanford home that his re
search has lately concentrated on the genetic
inheritability of I.Q.
Over the past decade, Shockley has received
much criticism for his genetic research. He has
been labeled a racist by many for his theory that
lower I.Q.'s of blacks may be genetic in origin.
He said he now has to devote time to public
relations to make sure he is more clearly under
stood.
Renewed interest in his research motives was
sparked last month when The New York Times
reported that Shockley had received $179,000
over the last 10 years from the Pioneer Fund, a
private foundation devoted to research into
"racial betterment."
Shockley expressed little concern over this
funding, saying that if he could get the funds,
he would.
But he said he is having trouble keeping his
tax-exempt research fund out of the red. "It's
been operating on funds that I've been loaning
it," he said.
If he were to continue his personal support
and accept money from the Pioneer Fund, he
said he'd be "in trouble."
"It wouldn't get the benefits of being a so
called non-private foundation," a class which

Shockley speculated benefits issues which "re
flect the public interests."
He has said in the past that his goal in re
search is an "objective inquiry" into whether,
as he believes is the case, there is occuring a
"genetic deterioration in the potential for intel
ligence" among blacks.
Earl Cilley, director of the University's spon
sored projects office, which audited the money
from the Pioneer Fund when Shockley was at
Stanford, emphasized the emeritus professor's
right to research despite the prevailing opin
ions toward it.
A 1971 statement on research by the
Academic Council said the University should
foster research regardless of "speculations
concerning the political or moral impropriety
of the uses which might be made of its results."
Cilley said Shockley had been very conscien
tious in following the University's guidelines
for research.
Shockley reacted to the recent disclosures
about the Pioneer Fund by writing letters at
tempting to justify his research to newspapers.
He said, "Babies born with an unfair shake
from a badly loaded parental dice cup (no mat
ter whether black, white or other) will be genet
ically enslaved.
"If my opinion is proven true, wise treatment
can be sought. If proven wrong, the new scien
tific facts will help to counter prejudice."
He said he believes diagnostic tools exist to
find the truth.
Visiting professor of genetics v ßichard
Goldsby has another opinion.
Goldsby said, "There is research methodol
ogy that gives one impressions of the genetic
inheritability of 1.Q.," but he added, "There is

really no data that could be delivered in a single
stroke or in multiple strokes to prove
Shockley's theory."
The black geneticist often debates Shockley,
taking the stance that the environment a child is
raised in is the most important factor in de
veloping I.Q.
