# New investment statement: improvement
## 
### Nelson Dong 
As I read the column by Byrne, et
al. (Daily, Jan. 11) concerning Stan
ford's revised investment guidelines,
I jotted down a number of notes, and
I thought I would share those
thoughts. In this column, I will try to
go through the commentary.
Let me state at the outset that, for
many reasons, I am not at all upset
with what the trustees finally
adopted. I personally feel that the
new statement is avast improvement
over the 1971 statement and fairly in
corporates what the overwhelming
majority of what the ad hoc commit
tee recommended.
Byrne states that the three stu
dents on the ad hoc committee
"worked to change" the "automatic
subordination of the trustees' social
responsibility as investors to their
fiduciary responsibility." I think that
is plainly wrong, as Tully Friedman,
Dick Cuggenhime, and I tried to
point out repeatedly.
There is no way for the trustees,
much less an ad hoc committee, to
change the law of trusts and the law
of corporations unilaterally. That
so-called "automatic subordination"
is simply a fact of life, imposed by the
vast body of case law and statutes
which govern corporations and
trusts. Even if our committee had
been unanimous, and even if the
trustees themselves had unanim
ously endorsed the student position,
that would not have changed the
legal reality in which the University
must function.

Byrne describes the new statement
as "the same product in a prettier

box with a bigger bow." That seems
to be a disingenuous and extremely
unfair characterization of the new
guidelines.
Perhaps the best answer to those
criticisms is the language of parag
raph 1.2 of the new guidelines. In
that paragraph, there is now a frank
and honest recognition that the con
cept of corporate social responsibil
ity is inherent in stock ownership.
That statement is more far-reaching
than anything that our own ad hoc
committee drafted, especially when
viewed against the 1971 guidelines.
Inaccurate characterization
Byrne lists a couple of the new fea
tures and then dismisses them as
"hints at progressivism." That
characterization is inaccurate. There
are at least 14 new provisions in the
1977 statement that represent a sub
stantial improvement over the 1971
guidelines:
—An affirmative commitment to
the concept of corporate social re
sponsibility (paragraph 1.3);
—Mandatory voting for proxy is
sues that would eliminate or mate
rially reduce substantial social injury
(paragraph 2.2(a));
—Formal recognition of the ability
to make formal and informal rep
resentations to corporate manage
ment, regardless of whether a proxy
issue is presented (paragraph
2.2(b));
—A clear divestment policy which
requires the University to exercise all
of its practicable shareholder rights
in the interest of corporate social re
sponsibility before divestment is

proposed (paragraph 2.3);
—An expanded Commission on
Investment Responsibility (CIR) that
includes representatives of all sec
tors of the Stanford community, in
cluding regular staff (paragraph
3.1(a));
Agenda
—A clearly-defined mechanism for
establishing the agenda of the CIR,
including input from any member or
group of the Stanford community
(paragraph 3.2(b));
—An affirmative commitment of
budget and staff to support the ClR's
investigations and deliberations
(paragraph 3.2(d));
—Guaranteed CIR access to hold
ing lists of endowment securities and
other pertinent data with respect to
corporate social responsibility
(paragraph 3.2(e));
—Affirmative recognition that the
scope of the ClR's review of a matter
must take into consideration the
"opinions expressed within the Stan
ford community regarding the is
sues" (paragraph 3.3(a));
—Provision for direct reporting of
the ClR's recommendations to the
Board of Trustees and to the respon
sible officers of the University
(paragraph 3.3(d));
Dissenting
—Express provision for dissenting
views to be submitted along with the
majority recommendation of the CIR
(paragraph 3.3(d));
—Provision for public dissemina
tion of the CIR recommendation and
report, at the ClR's own discretion
(paragraph 3.3(d));
—A commitment by the trustees
to defer taking any action wherever
feasible until the CIR has completed
its study and delivered its recom
mendations (paragraph 3.3(e)); and
—A commitment that the trustees
will inform the CIR about the reason
where its actions differ from the re
commendations of the CIR (parag
raph 3.3(f)).
I have gone to the trouble of
itemizing these improvements to
show you that there are substantive
changes in the new document which
deserve more credit...
Language
Byrne attacks the change of lan
guage which deals with the invest
ment manager or advisor. I wrote the
original sentence to which Byrne has
apparently become so attached. I am
not at all disturbed by the change
because the sense of both sentences
is essentially the same: The invest
ment manager's initial decision, as
distinguished from the trustees' later
judgment, must be based on purely
economic consideration.
My own language was merely a
way of expressing the fact that a
"substantial social injury caused by
company activities which are likely to
produce an adverse governmental or
public reaction" could be translated
into dollar terms by the investment
manager...
It is important to recall that the in
vestment manager is retained solely
to assist in the maximization of the
return on the University's endow
ment. He has neither the ability nor
the right to substitute his individual
concepts of social responsibility in
making his decisions for the Univer
sity. However, the trustees do have
that responsibility, as evidenced by
this set of guidelines. That was, after
all, the whole point behind drafting
this statement and establishing the
CIR to advise the trustees.
Fiduciary duties
The entire Trustee Statement on
Investment Responsibility must be
deemed subordinate to the trustees'
fiduciary duties to the school. In
other words, anything contained in
such a statement that is inconsistent
with the trustees' fiduciary duties

would be null and void in the eyes of
the law, and any actions taken there
under would, at least potentially,
make the participating trustees liable
to prosecution by the state attorney
general.
Therefore, it is an empty exercise
to adopt language in any statement
which is contrary to the law of
fiduciaries. To recognize that con
straint explicitly with such language
as "providing such action is not in
consistent with the trustees'
fiduciary obligations" does not add
anything to what the law already
plainly requires.
Moreover, Byrne omits an impor
tant qualifier found in the 1977
guidelines: the word "primary." It is
the trustees' "primary fiduciary obli
gation" to seek a maximum return,
not its exclusive obligation.
Profit maximization
Furthermore, there is no absolute
and objective criterion by which pro
fit maximization versus social re
sponsibility can be measured. In the
last analysis, the decisions will always
be a matter of judgment, revolving
around the degree of detriment to
the return as balanced against the
probable benefits of the measure. I
doubt very much that anyone would
criticize the trustees for voting in
favor of the measure that might cost
the University a few hundred or even
a few thousand dollars on its return if
the societal benefit were spectacular
or even substantial. The law of
fiduciaries, about which Byrne
seems to have so much dread, does
not require the trustees to get every
last cent out of an investment, as evi
denced by their ability to adopt these
guidelines.
Byrne makes the statement that
the 1977 revision has "re-established
the automatic subordination of so
cial responsibility to maximization of
profits." That is flatly untrue. Byrne,
Dixon, and Henkels have noted re
peatedly that many, if not most, mea
sures will have little or no effect on a
firm's profit picture. Accordingly,
the University's position on those
particular measures pose absolutely
no conflict and requires no "subor
dination."

Even those intermediate cases
where some minor loss may be an
ticipated can be dealt with affirma
tively and yet consistently with the
trustees' fiduciary duty. But in the
extreme case, where there would be
a serious loss of return due to the
adoption of a reasonable and lawful
measure to cure a substantial social
injury, there is a high probability that
Stanford would soon dump that
stock anyway as a bad, marginal in
vestment; as an economic fact of life,
such companies are not good long
term investments. Therefore, I fail to
see a practical result that matches
your grim prediction.
It was only through the experience
that you and other members of the
community had with the 1971 state
ment that allowed us to draft this re
vision.
Further changes may well be desir
able, but that will only be known
after this set of guidelines has been
tested. As for the sincerity of the
trustees' commitment to corporate
social responsibiltiy, that, too, will
be demonstrated as it deals with the
recommendations from the new CIR
over the next year. In this area, as in
so many others, actions speak far
more loudly than words, even when
those words are expressed in a set of
policy guidelines.

I have gone to the trouble of
itemizing these improvements to
show you that there are substantive
changes in the new document which
deserve more credit...
Language
Byrne attacks the change of lan
guage which deals with the invest
ment manager or advisor. I wrote the
original sentence to which Byrne has
apparently become so attached. I am
not at all disturbed by the change
because the sense of both sentences
is essentially the same: The invest
ment manager's initial decision, as
distinguished from the trustees' later
judgment, must be based on purely
economic consideration.
My own language was merely a
way of expressing the fact that a
"substantial social injury caused by
company activities which are likely to
produce an adverse governmental or
public reaction" could be translated
into dollar terms by the investment
manager...
It is important to recall that the in
vestment manager is retained solely
to assist in the maximization of the
return on the University's endow
ment. He has neither the ability nor
the right to substitute his individual
concepts of social responsibility in
making his decisions for the Univer
sity. However, the trustees do have
that responsibility, as evidenced by
this set of guidelines. That was, after
all, the whole point behind drafting
this statement and establishing the
CIR to advise the trustees.
Fiduciary duties
The entire Trustee Statement on
Investment Responsibility must be
deemed subordinate to the trustees'
fiduciary duties to the school. In
other words, anything contained in
such a statement that is inconsistent
with the trustees' fiduciary duties

would be null and void in the eyes of
the law, and any actions taken there
under would, at least potentially,
make the participating trustees liable
to prosecution by the state attorney
general.
Therefore, it is an empty exercise
to adopt language in any statement
which is contrary to the law of
fiduciaries. To recognize that con
straint explicitly with such language
as "providing such action is not in
consistent with the trustees'
fiduciary obligations" does not add
anything to what the law already
plainly requires.
Moreover, Byrne omits an impor
tant qualifier found in the 1977
guidelines: the word "primary." It is
the trustees' "primary fiduciary obli
gation" to seek a maximum return,
not its exclusive obligation.
Profit maximization
Furthermore, there is no absolute
and objective criterion by which pro
fit maximization versus social re
sponsibility can be measured. In the
last analysis, the decisions will always
be a matter of judgment, revolving
around the degree of detriment to
the return as balanced against the
probable benefits of the measure. I
doubt very much that anyone would
criticize the trustees for voting in
favor of the measure that might cost
the University a few hundred or even
a few thousand dollars on its return if
the societal benefit were spectacular
or even substantial. The law of
fiduciaries, about which Byrne
seems to have so much dread, does
not require the trustees to get every
last cent out of an investment, as evi
denced by their ability to adopt these
guidelines.
Byrne makes the statement that
the 1977 revision has "re-established
the automatic subordination of so
cial responsibility to maximization of
profits." That is flatly untrue. Byrne,
Dixon, and Henkels have noted re
peatedly that many, if not most, mea
sures will have little or no effect on a
firm's profit picture. Accordingly,
the University's position on those
particular measures pose absolutely
no conflict and requires no "subor
dination."

Even those intermediate cases
where some minor loss may be an
ticipated can be dealt with affirma
tively and yet consistently with the
trustees' fiduciary duty. But in the
extreme case, where there would be
a serious loss of return due to the
adoption of a reasonable and lawful
measure to cure a substantial social
injury, there is a high probability that
Stanford would soon dump that
stock anyway as a bad, marginal in
vestment; as an economic fact of life,
such companies are not good long
term investments. Therefore, I fail to
see a practical result that matches
your grim prediction.
It was only through the experience
that you and other members of the
community had with the 1971 state
ment that allowed us to draft this re
vision.
Further changes may well be desir
able, but that will only be known
after this set of guidelines has been
tested. As for the sincerity of the
trustees' commitment to corporate
social responsibiltiy, that, too, will
be demonstrated as it deals with the
recommendations from the new CIR
over the next year. In this area, as in
so many others, actions speak far
more loudly than words, even when
those words are expressed in a set of
policy guidelines.
(This column is an edited version of a
letter to COP President Anne Hen
kels by Nelson Dong, an alumnus
member of the ad hoc Committee on
Investment Responsibility.)
As I read the column by Byrne, et
al. (Daily, Jan. 11) concerning Stan
ford's revised investment guidelines,
I jotted down a number of notes, and
I thought I would share those
thoughts. In this column, I will try to
go through the commentary.
Let me state at the outset that, for
many reasons, I am not at all upset
with what the trustees finally
adopted. I personally feel that the
new statement is avast improvement
over the 1971 statement and fairly in
corporates what the overwhelming
majority of what the ad hoc commit
tee recommended.
Byrne states that the three stu
dents on the ad hoc committee
"worked to change" the "automatic
subordination of the trustees' social
responsibility as investors to their
fiduciary responsibility." I think that
is plainly wrong, as Tully Friedman,
Dick Cuggenhime, and I tried to
point out repeatedly.
There is no way for the trustees,
much less an ad hoc committee, to
change the law of trusts and the law
of corporations unilaterally. That
so-called "automatic subordination"
is simply a fact of life, imposed by the
vast body of case law and statutes
which govern corporations and
trusts. Even if our committee had
been unanimous, and even if the
trustees themselves had unanim
ously endorsed the student position,
that would not have changed the
legal reality in which the University
must function.

Byrne describes the new statement
as "the same product in a prettier

box with a bigger bow." That seems
to be a disingenuous and extremely
unfair characterization of the new
guidelines.
Perhaps the best answer to those
criticisms is the language of parag
raph 1.2 of the new guidelines. In
that paragraph, there is now a frank
and honest recognition that the con
cept of corporate social responsibil
ity is inherent in stock ownership.
That statement is more far-reaching
than anything that our own ad hoc
committee drafted, especially when
viewed against the 1971 guidelines.
Inaccurate characterization
Byrne lists a couple of the new fea
tures and then dismisses them as
"hints at progressivism." That
characterization is inaccurate. There
are at least 14 new provisions in the
1977 statement that represent a sub
stantial improvement over the 1971
guidelines:
—An affirmative commitment to
the concept of corporate social re
sponsibility (paragraph 1.3);
—Mandatory voting for proxy is
sues that would eliminate or mate
rially reduce substantial social injury
(paragraph 2.2(a));
—Formal recognition of the ability
to make formal and informal rep
resentations to corporate manage
ment, regardless of whether a proxy
issue is presented (paragraph
2.2(b));
—A clear divestment policy which
requires the University to exercise all
of its practicable shareholder rights
in the interest of corporate social re
sponsibility before divestment is

proposed (paragraph 2.3);
—An expanded Commission on
Investment Responsibility (CIR) that
includes representatives of all sec
tors of the Stanford community, in
cluding regular staff (paragraph
3.1(a));
Agenda
—A clearly-defined mechanism for
establishing the agenda of the CIR,
including input from any member or
group of the Stanford community
(paragraph 3.2(b));
—An affirmative commitment of
budget and staff to support the ClR's
investigations and deliberations
(paragraph 3.2(d));
—Guaranteed CIR access to hold
ing lists of endowment securities and
other pertinent data with respect to
corporate social responsibility
(paragraph 3.2(e));
—Affirmative recognition that the
scope of the ClR's review of a matter
must take into consideration the
"opinions expressed within the Stan
ford community regarding the is
sues" (paragraph 3.3(a));
—Provision for direct reporting of
the ClR's recommendations to the
Board of Trustees and to the respon
sible officers of the University
(paragraph 3.3(d));
Dissenting
—Express provision for dissenting
views to be submitted along with the
majority recommendation of the CIR
(paragraph 3.3(d));
—Provision for public dissemina
tion of the CIR recommendation and
report, at the ClR's own discretion
(paragraph 3.3(d));
—A commitment by the trustees
to defer taking any action wherever
feasible until the CIR has completed
its study and delivered its recom
mendations (paragraph 3.3(e)); and
—A commitment that the trustees

where its actions differ from the re

consistent with the trustees'
fiduciary obligations" does not add
anything to what the law already
plainly requires.
Moreover, Byrne omits an impor
tant qualifier found in the 1977
guidelines: the word "primary." It is
the trustees' "primary fiduciary obli
gation" to seek a maximum return,
not its exclusive obligation.
Profit maximization
Furthermore, there is no absolute
and objective criterion by which pro
fit maximization versus social re
sponsibility can be measured. In the
last analysis, the decisions will always
be a matter of judgment, revolving
around the degree of detriment to
the return as balanced against the
probable benefits of the measure. I
doubt very much that anyone would
criticize the trustees for voting in
favor of the measure that might cost
the University a few hundred or even
a few thousand dollars on its return if
the societal benefit were spectacular
or even substantial. The law of
fiduciaries, about which Byrne
seems to have so much dread, does
not require the trustees to get every
last cent out of an investment, as evi
denced by their ability to adopt these
guidelines.
Byrne makes the statement that
the 1977 revision has "re-established
the automatic subordination of so
cial responsibility to maximization of
profits." That is flatly untrue. Byrne,
Dixon, and Henkels have noted re
peatedly that many, if not most, mea
sures will have little or no effect on a
firm's profit picture. Accordingly,
the University's position on those
particular measures pose absolutely
no conflict and requires no "subor
dination."

Even those intermediate cases
where some minor loss may be an
ticipated can be dealt with affirma
tively and yet consistently with the
trustees' fiduciary duty. But in the
extreme case, where there would be
a serious loss of return due to the
adoption of a reasonable and lawful
measure to cure a substantial social
injury, there is a high probability that
Stanford would soon dump that
stock anyway as a bad, marginal in
vestment; as an economic fact of life,
such companies are not good long
term investments. Therefore, I fail to
see a practical result that matches
your grim prediction.
It was only through the experience
that you and other members of the
community had with the 1971 state
ment that allowed us to draft this re
vision.
Further changes may well be desir
able, but that will only be known
after this set of guidelines has been
tested. As for the sincerity of the
trustees' commitment to corporate
social responsibiltiy, that, too, will
be demonstrated as it deals with the
recommendations from the new CIR
over the next year. In this area, as in
so many others, actions speak far
more loudly than words, even when
those words are expressed in a set of
policy guidelines.
(This column is an edited version of a
letter to COP President Anne Hen
kels by Nelson Dong, an alumnus
member of the ad hoc Committee on
Investment Responsibility.)
As I read the column by Byrne, et
al. (Daily, Jan. 11) concerning Stan
ford's revised investment guidelines,
I jotted down a number of notes, and
I thought I would share those
thoughts. In this column, I will try to
go through the commentary.
Let me state at the outset that, for
many reasons, I am not at all upset
with what the trustees finally
adopted. I personally feel that the
new statement is avast improvement
over the 1971 statement and fairly in
corporates what the overwhelming
majority of what the ad hoc commit
tee recommended.
Byrne states that the three stu
dents on the ad hoc committee
"worked to change" the "automatic
subordination of the trustees' social
responsibility as investors to their
fiduciary responsibility." I think that
is plainly wrong, as Tully Friedman,
Dick Cuggenhime, and I tried to
point out repeatedly.
There is no way for the trustees,
much less an ad hoc committee, to
change the law of trusts and the law
of corporations unilaterally. That
so-called "automatic subordination"
is simply a fact of life, imposed by the
vast body of case law and statutes
which govern corporations and
trusts. Even if our committee had
been unanimous, and even if the
trustees themselves had unanim
ously endorsed the student position,
that would not have changed the
legal reality in which the University
must function.

Byrne describes the new statement
as "the same product in a prettier

box with a bigger bow." That seems
to be a disingenuous and extremely
unfair characterization of the new
guidelines.
Perhaps the best answer to those
criticisms is the language of parag
raph 1.2 of the new guidelines. In
that paragraph, there is now a frank
and honest recognition that the con
cept of corporate social responsibil
ity is inherent in stock ownership.
That statement is more far-reaching
than anything that our own ad hoc
committee drafted, especially when
viewed against the 1971 guidelines.
Inaccurate characterization
Byrne lists a couple of the new fea
tures and then dismisses them as
"hints at progressivism." That
characterization is inaccurate. There
are at least 14 new provisions in the
1977 statement that represent a sub
stantial improvement over the 1971
guidelines:
—An affirmative commitment to
the concept of corporate social re
sponsibility (paragraph 1.3);
—Mandatory voting for proxy is
sues that would eliminate or mate
rially reduce substantial social injury
(paragraph 2.2(a));
—Formal recognition of the ability
to make formal and informal rep
resentations to corporate manage
ment, regardless of whether a proxy
issue is presented (paragraph
2.2(b));
—A clear divestment policy which
requires the University to exercise all
of its practicable shareholder rights
in the interest of corporate social re
sponsibility before divestment is

proposed (paragraph 2.3);
—An expanded Commission on
Investment Responsibility (CIR) that
includes representatives of all sec
tors of the Stanford community, in
cluding regular staff (paragraph
3.1(a));
Agenda
—A clearly-defined mechanism for
establishing the agenda of the CIR,
including input from any member or
group of the Stanford community
(paragraph 3.2(b));
—An affirmative commitment of
budget and staff to support the ClR's
investigations and deliberations
(paragraph 3.2(d));
—Guaranteed CIR access to hold
ing lists of endowment securities and
other pertinent data with respect to
corporate social responsibility
(paragraph 3.2(e));
—Affirmative recognition that the
scope of the ClR's review of a matter
must take into consideration the
"opinions expressed within the Stan
ford community regarding the is
sues" (paragraph 3.3(a));
—Provision for direct reporting of
the ClR's recommendations to the
Board of Trustees and to the respon
sible officers of the University
(paragraph 3.3(d));
Dissenting
—Express provision for dissenting
views to be submitted along with the
majority recommendation of the CIR
(paragraph 3.3(d));
—Provision for public dissemina
tion of the CIR recommendation and
report, at the ClR's own discretion
(paragraph 3.3(d));
—A commitment by the trustees
to defer taking any action wherever
feasible until the CIR has completed
its study and delivered its recom
mendations (paragraph 3.3(e)); and
—A commitment that the trustees
will inform the CIR about the reason
where its actions differ from the re
commendations of the CIR (parag
raph 3.3(f)).
I have gone to the trouble of
itemizing these improvements to
show you that there are substantive
changes in the new document which
deserve more credit...
Language
Byrne attacks the change of lan
guage which deals with the invest
ment manager or advisor. I wrote the
original sentence to which Byrne has
apparently become so attached. I am
not at all disturbed by the change
because the sense of both sentences
is essentially the same: The invest
ment manager's initial decision, as
distinguished from the trustees' later
judgment, must be based on purely
economic consideration.
My own language was merely a
way of expressing the fact that a
"substantial social injury caused by
company activities which are likely to
produce an adverse governmental or
public reaction" could be translated
into dollar terms by the investment
manager...
It is important to recall that the in
vestment manager is retained solely
to assist in the maximization of the
return on the University's endow
ment. He has neither the ability nor
the right to substitute his individual
concepts of social responsibility in
making his decisions for the Univer
sity. However, the trustees do have
that responsibility, as evidenced by
this set of guidelines. That was, after
all, the whole point behind drafting
this statement and establishing the
CIR to advise the trustees.
Fiduciary duties
The entire Trustee Statement on
Investment Responsibility must be
deemed subordinate to the trustees'
fiduciary duties to the school. In
other words, anything contained in
such a statement that is inconsistent
with the trustees' fiduciary duties

would be null and void in the eyes of
the law, and any actions taken there
under would, at least potentially,
make the participating trustees liable
to prosecution by the state attorney
general.
Therefore, it is an empty exercise
to adopt language in any statement
which is contrary to the law of
fiduciaries. To recognize that con
straint explicitly with such language
as "providing such action is not in
consistent with the trustees'
fiduciary obligations" does not add
anything to what the law already
plainly requires.
Moreover, Byrne omits an impor
tant qualifier found in the 1977

many reasons, I am not at all upset
with what the trustees finally
adopted. I personally feel that the
new statement is avast improvement
over the 1971 statement and fairly in
corporates what the overwhelming
majority of what the ad hoc commit
tee recommended.
Byrne states that the three stu
dents on the ad hoc committee
"worked to change" the "automatic
subordination of the trustees' social
responsibility as investors to their
fiduciary responsibility." I think that
is plainly wrong, as Tully Friedman,
Dick Cuggenhime, and I tried to
point out repeatedly.
There is no way for the trustees,
much less an ad hoc committee, to
change the law of trusts and the law
of corporations unilaterally. That
so-called "automatic subordination"
is simply a fact of life, imposed by the
vast body of case law and statutes
which govern corporations and
trusts. Even if our committee had
been unanimous, and even if the
trustees themselves had unanim
ously endorsed the student position,
that would not have changed the
legal reality in which the University
must function.

Byrne describes the new statement
as "the same product in a prettier

box with a bigger bow." That seems
to be a disingenuous and extremely
unfair characterization of the new
guidelines.
Perhaps the best answer to those
criticisms is the language of parag
raph 1.2 of the new guidelines. In
that paragraph, there is now a frank
and honest recognition that the con
cept of corporate social responsibil
ity is inherent in stock ownership.
That statement is more far-reaching
than anything that our own ad hoc
committee drafted, especially when
viewed against the 1971 guidelines.
Inaccurate characterization
Byrne lists a couple of the new fea
tures and then dismisses them as
"hints at progressivism." That
characterization is inaccurate. There
are at least 14 new provisions in the
1977 statement that represent a sub
stantial improvement over the 1971
guidelines:
—An affirmative commitment to
the concept of corporate social re
sponsibility (paragraph 1.3);
—Mandatory voting for proxy is
sues that would eliminate or mate
rially reduce substantial social injury
(paragraph 2.2(a));
—Formal recognition of the ability
to make formal and informal rep
resentations to corporate manage
ment, regardless of whether a proxy
issue is presented (paragraph
2.2(b));
—A clear divestment policy which
requires the University to exercise all
of its practicable shareholder rights
in the interest of corporate social re
sponsibility before divestment is

proposed (paragraph 2.3);
—An expanded Commission on
Investment Responsibility (CIR) that
includes representatives of all sec
tors of the Stanford community, in
cluding regular staff (paragraph
3.1(a));
Agenda
—A clearly-defined mechanism for
establishing the agenda of the CIR,
including input from any member or
group of the Stanford community
(paragraph 3.2(b));
—An affirmative commitment of
budget and staff to support the ClR's
investigations and deliberations
(paragraph 3.2(d));
—Guaranteed CIR access to hold
ing lists of endowment securities and
other pertinent data with respect to
corporate social responsibility
(paragraph 3.2(e));
—Affirmative recognition that the
scope of the ClR's review of a matter
must take into consideration the
"opinions expressed within the Stan
ford community regarding the is
sues" (paragraph 3.3(a));
—Provision for direct reporting of
the ClR's recommendations to the
Board of Trustees and to the respon
sible officers of the University
(paragraph 3.3(d));
Dissenting
—Express provision for dissenting
views to be submitted along with the
majority recommendation of the CIR
(paragraph 3.3(d));
—Provision for public dissemina
tion of the CIR recommendation and
report, at the ClR's own discretion
(paragraph 3.3(d));
—A commitment by the trustees
to defer taking any action wherever
feasible until the CIR has completed
its study and delivered its recom
mendations (paragraph 3.3(e)); and
—A commitment that the trustees
will inform the CIR about the reason
where its actions differ from the re
commendations of the CIR (parag
raph 3.3(f)).
I have gone to the trouble of
itemizing these improvements to
show you that there are substantive
changes in the new document which
deserve more credit...
Language
Byrne attacks the change of lan
guage which deals with the invest
ment manager or advisor. I wrote the
original sentence to which Byrne has
apparently become so attached. I am
not at all disturbed by the change
because the sense of both sentences
is essentially the same: The invest
ment manager's initial decision, as
distinguished from the trustees' later
judgment, must be based on purely
economic consideration.
My own language was merely a
way of expressing the fact that a
"substantial social injury caused by
company activities which are likely to
produce an adverse governmental or
public reaction" could be translated
into dollar terms by the investment
manager...
It is important to recall that the in
vestment manager is retained solely
to assist in the maximization of the
return on the University's endow
ment. He has neither the ability nor
the right to substitute his individual
concepts of social responsibility in
making his decisions for the Univer
sity. However, the trustees do have
that responsibility, as evidenced by
this set of guidelines. That was, after
all, the whole point behind drafting
this statement and establishing the
CIR to advise the trustees.
Fiduciary duties
The entire Trustee Statement on
Investment Responsibility must be
deemed subordinate to the trustees'
fiduciary duties to the school. In
other words, anything contained in
such a statement that is inconsistent
with the trustees' fiduciary duties

would be null and void in the eyes of
the law, and any actions taken there
under would, at least potentially,
make the participating trustees liable
to prosecution by the state attorney
general.
Therefore, it is an empty exercise
to adopt language in any statement
which is contrary to the law of
fiduciaries. To recognize that con
straint explicitly with such language
as "providing such action is not in
consistent with the trustees'
fiduciary obligations" does not add
anything to what the law already
plainly requires.
Moreover, Byrne omits an impor
tant qualifier found in the 1977
guidelines: the word "primary." It is
the trustees' "primary fiduciary obli
gation" to seek a maximum return,
not its exclusive obligation.
Profit maximization
Furthermore, there is no absolute
and objective criterion by which pro
fit maximization versus social re
sponsibility can be measured. In the
last analysis, the decisions will always
be a matter of judgment, revolving
around the degree of detriment to
the return as balanced against the
probable benefits of the measure. I
doubt very much that anyone would
criticize the trustees for voting in
favor of the measure that might cost
the University a few hundred or even
a few thousand dollars on its return if
the societal benefit were spectacular
or even substantial. The law of
fiduciaries, about which Byrne
seems to have so much dread, does
not require the trustees to get every
last cent out of an investment, as evi
denced by their ability to adopt these
guidelines.
Byrne makes the statement that
the 1977 revision has "re-established
the automatic subordination of so
cial responsibility to maximization of
profits." That is flatly untrue. Byrne,
Dixon, and Henkels have noted re
peatedly that many, if not most, mea
sures will have little or no effect on a
firm's profit picture. Accordingly,
the University's position on those
particular measures pose absolutely
no conflict and requires no "subor
dination."

Even those intermediate cases
where some minor loss may be an
ticipated can be dealt with affirma
tively and yet consistently with the
trustees' fiduciary duty. But in the
extreme case, where there would be
a serious loss of return due to the
adoption of a reasonable and lawful
measure to cure a substantial social
injury, there is a high probability that
Stanford would soon dump that
stock anyway as a bad, marginal in
vestment; as an economic fact of life,
such companies are not good long
term investments. Therefore, I fail to
see a practical result that matches
your grim prediction.
It was only through the experience
that you and other members of the
community had with the 1971 state
ment that allowed us to draft this re
vision.
Further changes may well be desir
able, but that will only be known
after this set of guidelines has been
tested. As for the sincerity of the
trustees' commitment to corporate
social responsibiltiy, that, too, will
be demonstrated as it deals with the
recommendations from the new CIR
over the next year. In this area, as in
so many others, actions speak far
more loudly than words, even when
those words are expressed in a set of
policy guidelines.

Investment Responsibility.)
As I read the column by Byrne, et
al. (Daily, Jan. 11) concerning Stan
ford's revised investment guidelines,
I jotted down a number of notes, and
I thought I would share those
