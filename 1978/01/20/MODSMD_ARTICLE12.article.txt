What is the mysterious "Bleeker Area," whose
sign forbids all but authorized personnel, lo
cated way out on Searsville Road on the west
side of campus?
The buildings in the Bleeker Area are pre
sently used as studios for graduate students in
painting and sculpture, said Joan Coppock, an
administrative assistant in the Art Department.
Graduate students in the MFA program do
their work in the three buildings which com
prise the Bleeker Area. The three buildings are
named Barnes Hall, Bleeker Hall, and Price Hall.
Barnes is named for Mike Barnes, an artist, and
Price is named for Donald Price, the former as
sistant dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
The Art Department took overthe buildings in
1964-65.

Why is it that pants clips cost 100 percent more
at the Campus Bike Shop on campus than they
do at the Stanford Bike Co-op in town?
Could this suggest that the Campus Bike Shop
has artificially inflated prices because of its exc
lusive location on campus?
-MJ
I called the Co-op and they told me their pants
clips cost 89 cents that's for the plain metal
ones. At the Campus Bike Shop, metal ones with
a reflective edge cost 99 cents. Where's the 100
per cent? ,

Why is the lab 175 on the first floor of the Seely
C. Mudd Chemistry Building used as office
space? I feel that it is a waste of the expensive lab
facilities which have been newly installed in that
room.

It is true that one of the "wet labs" on the first
floor has been taken over for offices, said Curtis
Wherry, an administrative officer in the Chemis
try Department.
The root oftheproblem lies in the fact that the
present building is a compromise. Years ago,
plans called for the construction of two new
chemistry buildings. However due to a lack of
funds, only one building was built the Seely
C. Mudd building. The Chemistry Department
is trying to make do with the present space (only
two floors worth the third floor is "shelled").
Presently, office space is needed for graduate
students. According to Wherry, the "wet lab" is
being used as office space because, "Now, the
need is more critical for graduate student desk
space than for wet lab space." Wherry em
phasized that the move is "not irreversible,"
and that "nothing was torn out." He said the
move is only "temporary," and should condi
tions change,

chemistry buildings. However due to a lack of
funds, only one building was built the Seely
C. Mudd building. The Chemistry Department
is trying to make do with the present space (only
two floors worth the third floor is "shelled").
Presently, office space is needed for graduate
students. According to Wherry, the "wet lab" is
being used as office space because, "Now, the
need is more critical for graduate student desk
space than for wet lab space." Wherry em
phasized that the move is "not irreversible,"
and that "nothing was torn out." He said the
move is only "temporary," and should condi
tions change,

What is the mysterious "Bleeker Area," whose
sign forbids all but authorized personnel, lo
cated way out on Searsville Road on the west
side of campus?
The buildings in the Bleeker Area are pre
sently used as studios for graduate students in
painting and sculpture, said Joan Coppock, an
administrative assistant in the Art Department.
Graduate students in the MFA program do
their work in the three buildings which com
prise the Bleeker Area. The three buildings are
named Barnes Hall, Bleeker Hall, and Price Hall.
Barnes is named for Mike Barnes, an artist, and
Price is named for Donald Price, the former as
sistant dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
The Art Department took overthe buildings in
1964-65.

Why is it that pants clips cost 100 percent more
at the Campus Bike Shop on campus than they
do at the Stanford Bike Co-op in town?
Could this suggest that the Campus Bike Shop
has artificially inflated prices because of its exc
lusive location on campus?
-MJ
I called the Co-op and they told me their pants
clips cost 89 cents that's for the plain metal
ones. At the Campus Bike Shop, metal ones with
a reflective edge cost 99 cents. Where's the 100
per cent? ,

Why is the lab 175 on the first floor of the Seely
C. Mudd Chemistry Building used as office
space? I feel that it is a waste of the expensive lab
facilities which have been newly installed in that
room.

It is true that one of the "wet labs" on the first
floor has been taken over for offices, said Curtis
Wherry, an administrative officer in the Chemis
try Department.
The root oftheproblem lies in the fact that the
present building is a compromise. Years ago,
plans called for the construction of two new
chemistry buildings. However due to a lack of
funds, only one building was built the Seely
C. Mudd building. The Chemistry Department
is trying to make do with the present space (only
two floors worth the third floor is "shelled").
Presently, office space is needed for graduate
