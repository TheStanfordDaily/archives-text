# Rains mean end to water rationing
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) With
torrents of rainwater scoring
records in previously
drought-parched Northern
California, Marin County
first to impose water rationing
reports the official end of
that grim measure as other
counties move to do the same.
Huge water runoffs from a
sparsely broken succession of
violent storms that have slam
med California for most of a
month are filling the reservoirs
at great speed.
The Sierra snowpack,
California's "bank" for water in
the dry months, grows deeper
with each storm.
On top of that good news, a
state agency finally called an
unequivocal and official end to
the two-year drought which
had people wondering when
cactus would start growing in
the streets.
Said yesterday's announce
ment from the California-
Nevada River Forecast Center
in Sacramento:
'Dramatic conclusions'
"The heavy rains which have
bombarded much of the West
ern United States since late
November have brought a
dramatic conclusion to the se
vere drought which has
plagued California. . . ."

At Mount Shasta, for in
stance, a key Northern Califor
nia weather station, the area
reported experiencing its third
wettest month in some 90 years

of record-keeping at the site.
On Wednesday, directors of
the Marin Municipal Water
District voted unanimously to
end water rationing for its

170,000 customers across the
Golden Gate from San Fran
cisco.
A few hours later, Contra
Costa County water officials
voted the same good news for
their 271,000 customers.
Rationing end
At the same time, the East
Bay Municipal Utility District,
with 1.1 million customers, an
nounced that directors will be
asked to end rationing.
Top Marin water official j.
Dietrich Stroch called the
runoff into the county reser
voirs "remarkable . . . fantas
tic. We're 93V2 percent full and
probably will be full by next
week."
San Francisco, which con
trols the Sierra's huge Hetch
Hetchy water supply for itself
and other nearby cities, has not
yet taken any action on easing
its 25 percent cutback.
Mayor George Moscone bas
said he would wait until the re
sults next month of a federal
survey of the Sierra snowpack
before making a move.
Among the good news
tumbling in was word from the
federal government that there
will be a full supply of water for
farmers dependent on the
northern system of the Central
Valley irrigation project.
