# PG&E repairs defective lines
## 
### 
Work crews from Pacific
Gas & Electric are continu
ing efforts to correct some
faulty electrical lines which
were responsible for a
lengthy power outage in the
San Juan Hill area earlier this
week.
PG&E spokesman Ron
Rutlowski said yesterday
that the 207 customers who
were temporarily without
power Tuesday were
supplied with sufficient
electricity due to a re
routing of power.
He said that the power
outage, which began at 2:40
a.m. on Tuesday, was
caused by some under
ground problems and by a
faulty above-ground trans

former.
The transformer, which
steps voltage down to use
able levels, was replaced
and power was restored by 7
p.m. Tuesday, according to
Rutlowski.
But he said the under
ground work had not been
completed. He said the
situation was complicated
because of muddy condi
tions.
There was no indication
when the repairs will be
completed, but he said he
did not expect PG&E would
have to blackout the area
again to finish the job.
"We may have to de
energize the line again, but I
don't think so," Rutlowski
said.
