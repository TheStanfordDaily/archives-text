Los Angeles (AP) Accusa
tions that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service dis
criminates against Mexican-
Americans and oversteps its
bounds as a policing agency
are among several being inves
tigated by the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission, authorities said
yesterday.
The investigation, one of
several being conducted by the
commission throughout the
country, will officially kick off
with public hearings here
March 22 and 23, although pre
liminary testimony already has
been taken, said commission
director Philip Montez.
The main thrust of the inves
tigation involves implementa
tion of a court order from a dis
crimination case against the
INS in Chicago, and the agen
cy's enforcement policies
applied to minority citizens,
especially Mexican-Americans.
Laurie Campbell, staff attor
ney for the commission,
explained that the INS often
"harasses people who look like
they are immigrants," al
though often, those people are

documented immigrants or
American citizens.
INS District Director Joseph
Sureck denied the charge and
said there are no lawsuits
against the INS concerning
harassment.
The INS director said yester
day that although he was
scheduled to meet with com
mission representatives the
next day, he was unaware of
the investigation, other than
from news reports.
The matter was first reported
in a series of interviews broad
cast on KNX radio.

Montez said the commission
also will look into why the INS
allegedly spends much of its
time enforcing immigration
policy instead of helping im
migrants.

"The INS is supposed to as
sist immigrants and provide
services," said Montez. "It
seems to us that they spend all
their time policing. The main
question we're asking is: Why
do they put their emphasis on
keeping people out of the
country?"
