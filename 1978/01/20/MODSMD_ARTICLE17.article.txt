# Shopping Center building planned
## 
### Matt Mettler 
New construction at the
Stanford Shopping Center is
scheduled to begin next week
behind Woolworth's, accord
ing to Jim Nelson, director of
Facilities and Properties.
With some 26,000 square
feet of floor space, the building
will house several fast food
outlets and be completed by
next fall, Nelson said. No
specific chains were named
but pizza, hotdog and donut
franchises havb been
suggested.
This will be the third phase of
construction at the shopping
center. The second phase was
begun last year alongside Ma
cy's, and is nearing comple
tion. Tenants should be able to
move in by April.

All four financial institutions
at the shopping center, Bank of
America, Crocker Bank, Citi
zen Savings and World Savings
will move to new prominent
corner locations in this build
ing beside Macy's."
Two new restaurants are
planned, along with sporting
goods, women's fashions,
jewelry and gift shops.
The building to be com
pleted next fall may also con
tain clothing and electronic
goods stores and a gift shop.
All of the buildings and land
at the shopping center are
owned by the University. The
occupants lease the space but
must pay for improvements to
the buildings. In some cases
the University receives a per
centage of profits from new
merchants.
