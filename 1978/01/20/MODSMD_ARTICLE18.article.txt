# Student ad-sellers provide lifeblood of publications

Scan a campus publication
end chances are you'll firrd
lany ads that can save you a
few bucks or tell you about a
new restaurant.
What you may not know
about the ads is how they got
there in the first place. Simple
through student salesper
sons.
Some students spend any
where from four to 30 hours a
week selling advertising to
local businesses.
Some have made up to $lOOO
a quarter on the job. Others
merely do it for "the experi
ence" or because ads must be
sold to keep a publication
alive.
The individuals' titles range
from door-to-door sales rep
resentative to advertising or
business manager. But the
basic idea behind all their ef
forts is to sell a product and
keep the customer satisfied.

"I'm responsible for all as
pects of customer service, sol
icitation, space reservation,
some aspects of billing and for
hiring new staff," said Kevin
O'Leary, advertising manager
at The Stanford Daily.
O'Leary, a senior, took up ad
selling after dropping JV
baseball at the end of his
freshman year. As a 30-hour
a-week manager, O'Leary
who oversees a 14-member
sales staff earns a salary, an
eight percent commission on
any ads he sells and gets one
percent of all ads sold in the
Daily.
Only 21
"Where else can anyone
who's 21 years old have re
sponsibility for 14 people and
be able to implement all kinds
of office procedures?
"It's a tremendous experi
ence as far as developing one's
sense of personal responsibil
ity," said O'Leary, who plans to
apply to business school.
"I came after I had seen an ad
in the Daily that they needed
salespeople," said Steve
Cobbe, a senior majoring in
electrical engineering. Cobbe
said his three months at the
Daily so far have been "a nice
distraction" and that the office
is "very hang loose. You call

your own hours here, it's not
high pressure."
"I was given 25 accounts
when I came here. Maybe five
or 10 of them are active. I've
gotten four or five from just
picking up the phone or from
spin-offs from customers I've
had before," said Cobbe, who
said he works 10 to 15 hours a
week.
"A lot of electrical engineers
get into the marketing or man
agement end of things. I want
to know both the technical end
and how to deal with people,"
he said.
Karen O'Leary is one of only
two women on the Daily ad
staff. As special projects man
ager, she manages all ads for
projects such as the stereo,
photography or ski issues, as
well as all sports issues.
'Not a disadvantage'
"Being a woman is definitely
not a disadvantage. I haven't
Jet it be a disadvantage," said

the senior English major.
"I'm fairly assertive. If you're
not, you don't make it here,"
she said.
O'Leary said if she receives
sexist comments on the job
from her customers, she
doesn't tell them off.
"I'm not in a position to say
'That was a horribly sexist re
mark.' I'm not in a position to
change their attitude. I can
onlytry to be a responsible role
model," she said.
Not all ad representatives on
campus receive commissions.
George Sycip wasn't paid to
solicit ads for Winds, the Asian
American newspaper last year.
"It was hard selling because
we were a new paper. Many
customers were hesitant be
cause they'd never heard of
Winds," Sycip said.
"At one store owned by a
Chinese man, the guy slam
med the door in our faces. We
started mumbling something
in Chinese and he opened the
door and said, 'Oh, you're
Chinese. I thought you were
Japanese.' He let us in but he
didn't buy an ad," Sycip said.
Sell to publish
At other publications, com
missions are available but do
not appear to be the primary
motivation behind student

sales efforts.
"Most people sell ads just to
help out the paper," said
Haywood Weaver, advertising
manager for the Black Media
Institute which publishes
among other things, the Real
News newspaper.
The Chaparral's business
manager, Steve Gittings, said
his relatively small sales staff
gets a 20 percent commission.
"At the Chaparral, commis
sions are downplayed. The
people here simply like the
Chaparral. They're not here to
make money. They know that
we have to sell ads in order to
publish," said Gittings, an
economics major going co
terminal in industrial engineer
ing.
Gittings said he receives no
salary and hasn't paid himself
any commissions although he
sells many ads.
Qualities
What qualities make a good
salesperson? John Baer, unof

ficial ad czar on campus, is a
senior in English who has to his
credit selling ads for the Stan
ford Money Book, as well as
ads for the Daily, the Stanford
desk blotter and bookcover, a
campus directory and the
Course Guide. He is also pres
ident of Ween Associates, an
advertising company.
"You have to be adaptable to
the other person. Selling an ad
to an 80-year-old shoe sales
man is different from selling an
ad to a 25-year-old typewriter
distributor. It's a lot of game
playing," Baer said. "You have
to make the other guy feel
good about himself. You can't
be afraid of patting the other
person on the back."
"Second, you ought to have
confidence in what you're sel
ling. Third, you should brush
your teeth.
"I easily spend 20 to 25' hours
a week selling ads. If a person's
not making $3O to $5O an hour,
he ought to change his pitch or

mouthwash," Baer said.
It's not known how many
students here sell ads for the
various publications. All of
those interviewed, however,
agreed that Stanford is in a
good ad market and there is
enough advertising to go
around.
Kevin O'Leary said it is fairly
easy for students to decide to

start a project and seek com
munity advertising to fund it.
Sometimes, students who
handle ads'in a-slipshod man
ner elicit complaints from local
advertisers, O'Leary said.
Image
"Those who try to pull off
schemes just to get money are
hurting all of us by setting a bad
example," he said.
"In many people's minds,

Stanford is one big thing. One
bad apple who says he's from
Stanford can ruin your image
even though you're from the
Stanford Daily and have been
working X number of years in a
very professional manner,"
O'Leary said. He added, how
ever, that most advertisers
have been "pleased" with what
Stanford students have done

for them.
O'Leary estimated the Daily
has 720 accounts. Daily busi
ness manager Robert Feren
said the Daily did $330,000
worth of business this year.
"We have 30 advertisers with
revenues in the range of $9OO
to $1300," said Gittings. He
added that the Daily didn't
create much of a competition
problem for the Chaparral.

"The Chappie has two very
marketable qualities. It's ads
are cheaper than the Daily'ij
and because it's a magazine",
the Chappie has a longer reten
tion period. People keep the
Chappie around longer," Git
tings explained.
"We don't have much prob
lem selling ads on campus be
cause we are a student organi
zation actually helping stu
dents learn more about news
paper production," Weaver
said of the Real News. "We also
have fewer advertisers than the
Daily, so ads in our paper are
less likely to be overlooked."
Surprisingly, most of those
interviewed don't intend to
make a career of advertising.
Weaver said he would like to
get into advertising manage
ment but get away from actual
selling activity.
Karen O'Leary said she
would "never work for an ad
agency."
"I don't like being a sales :
man. People think salesmen
are trying to snow them," said
Gittings. "You've got to con
vince them that's not what
you're doing."

'l'm fairly assertive. If you're not, you
don't make it here/

7 don't like being a salesman. People
think salesmen are trying to snow them.
You've got to convince them that's not
what you're doing.'
