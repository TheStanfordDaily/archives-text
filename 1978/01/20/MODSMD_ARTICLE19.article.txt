Emden, West Germany (AP) The last Vol
kswagen Beetle sedan, Nazi dictator Adolf Hi
tler's legacy that helped West Germans beef up
their post-war economy, rolled off a German
assembly line yesterday.
Since Daimler Benz made the first 30 pro
totype Beetles designed by Ferdinand Porsche
40 years ago, Volkswagen built 19.2 million Bee
tles to surpass the previous production record
of 15,007,034 set by Henry Ford's Model T in the
late 19205.
The Beetle continues to be produced in
Mexico, Brazil, South Africa and Nigeria. Mod
els sold in Germany from now on will bear a
"made in Mexico" tag.
The first shipload arrived two weeks ago at the
same Emden pier from which thousands of
German-made Beetles left to begin their suc
cessful invasion of the United States.
West German lines are still making a limited
number of Beetle convertibles in nearby Osnab
rueck. Besides Rolls-Royce's expensive Cor
niche, they are the only four-seater convertibles
in production.
At age 55, Porsche, who is better known today
for the expensive sportscar that bears his name,
hired six people in 1930 to begin work on his
dream, an inexpensive auto that most German
families could afford.
Porsche developed the unmistakeable out

lines of the Beetle on the basis of Chrysler's!
streamlined cars, which had impressed him on a
visit to the United States in the early 19305.
He triecj unsuccessfully to mass-produce his
design in successive ventures with two German:
motorcycle companies. In January 1934 he wrote;
Hitler to propose "construction of a German
Volkswagen" (people's car) with state support.
A friend from Daimler Benz arranged a meet- 1 !
ing with the Fuehrer. Hitler and Porsche, both
native Austrians, got on well together, and the
Fuehrer gave his full support and state financing
to the scheme.
The Nazi Party's Strength through Joy welfare
organization organized a savings plan to finance
the huge undertaking. A German worker was
promised his car as soon as he saved 990 marks
($472 dollars at present rates), then the price of a
medium-sized motorcycle.
World War II put a sudden stop to the
scheme. Civilian production plans were stop
ped immediately, and the car was modified to
become the German equivalent of the U.S. Ar
my's jeep.
When Hitler's Reich crumbled in 1945, the
Beetle plant was in ruins. The British military
government appointed Heinrich Nordhoff, a
former Opel truck plant manager, to take over
management of Volkswagen.
The People's Car was finally available to the
people in 1949.

Emden, West Germany (AP) The last Vol
kswagen Beetle sedan, Nazi dictator Adolf Hi
tler's legacy that helped West Germans beef up
their post-war economy, rolled off a German
assembly line yesterday.
Since Daimler Benz made the first 30 pro
totype Beetles designed by Ferdinand Porsche
40 years ago, Volkswagen built 19.2 million Bee
tles to surpass the previous production record
of 15,007,034 set by Henry Ford's Model T in the
late 19205.
The Beetle continues to be produced in
Mexico, Brazil, South Africa and Nigeria. Mod
els sold in Germany from now on will bear a
"made in Mexico" tag.
The first shipload arrived two weeks ago at the
same Emden pier from which thousands of
German-made Beetles left to begin their suc
cessful invasion of the United States.
West German lines are still making a limited
number of Beetle convertibles in nearby Osnab
rueck. Besides Rolls-Royce's expensive Cor
niche, they are the only four-seater convertibles
in production.
At age 55, Porsche, who is better known today
for the expensive sportscar that bears his name,
hired six people in 1930 to begin work on his
dream, an inexpensive auto that most German
families could afford.
Porsche developed the unmistakeable out

lines of the Beetle on the basis of Chrysler's!
streamlined cars, which had impressed him on a
visit to the United States in the early 19305.
He triecj unsuccessfully to mass-produce his
design in successive ventures with two German:
motorcycle companies. In January 1934 he wrote;
Hitler to propose "construction of a German
Volkswagen" (people's car) with state support.
A friend from Daimler Benz arranged a meet- 1 !
ing with the Fuehrer. Hitler and Porsche, both
native Austrians, got on well together, and the
Fuehrer gave his full support and state financing
to the scheme.
The Nazi Party's Strength through Joy welfare
organization organized a savings plan to finance
the huge undertaking. A German worker was
promised his car as soon as he saved 990 marks
($472 dollars at present rates), then the price of a
medium-sized motorcycle.
