# BSU brings Scott-Heron to Kresge
## 
### Hardy Iredale 
"Revolution ain't nothing but
change," said black singer
songwriter Gil Scott-Heron last night
at Kresge Auditorium.
"Change" was what his perfor
mance was all about. He told stories
of his youth in Harlem, delivered
with a wry wit and biting social com
mentary which alternately drew
laughter and applause from the
capacity audience.
Scott-Heron has been a major
voice in the black movement over
the past few years. His hit songs
"Johannesburg," "The Bottle" and
"The Revolution Will Not Be Tele
vised" brought him to national atten
tion a few years ago. He has also pub
lished several novels dealing with the
black situation in America.
Interpretation
Scott-Heron described his work as
"trying to interpret the black experi
ence; exposing and receiving ideas,
serving as an educator." He quoted
black singer Paul Robeson, who said,
"The artist always has the choice of
liberation or repression.
"I have made my choice," he said.
In an interview he said he sees his
music as continuing the traditional
Griot music of Africa; showing
blacks their past, putting their prob
lems and frustrations into words. But
the modern "culture figure," he
said, "has a much larger responsibil
ity to an extent, because we have a
much larger audience, and can throw
ideas out a lot further."
Those "ideas," for Scott-Heron,
have to do with reviving the African
roots of black culture in America,
and emphasizing its solidarity and
responsibility for shaping its own fu
ture.
Change
Speaking to the audience, he said
"change is inevitable and gradual
and constant, and if you do not de
cide to direct the elements that
change you, you will get run over by
it."
Looking to the future of the black
movement, he said "hopefully a lot
of the energies which were expres
sed nationally (in the past) will be
expressed locally now."
He emphasized the need for local
action to solve problems because, he
said, "problems start locally and are
different in different places."
Rebuilding
"We have recently gone through a
period when we have lost a lot of
generals," he said, adding "we have
to always be preparing ourselves;
ready to take up the battle when a
challenge comes along.
"Our point is no one can do every
thing, but everyone can do some
thing," he said.
The performance received a stand
ing ovation. It was the first of a series
of events to mark Black Liberation
Month which are currently being or
ganized by the Black Student Union.

the past few years. His hit songs
"Johannesburg," "The Bottle" and
"The Revolution Will Not Be Tele
vised" brought him to national atten
tion a few years ago. He has also pub
lished several novels dealing with the
black situation in America.
Interpretation
Scott-Heron described his work as
"trying to interpret the black experi
ence; exposing and receiving ideas,
serving as an educator." He quoted
black singer Paul Robeson, who said,
"The artist always has the choice of
liberation or repression.
"I have made my choice," he said.
In an interview he said he sees his
music as continuing the traditional
Griot music of Africa; showing
blacks their past, putting their prob
lems and frustrations into words. But
the modern "culture figure," he
said, "has a much larger responsibil
ity to an extent, because we have a
much larger audience, and can throw
ideas out a lot further."
Those "ideas," for Scott-Heron,
have to do with reviving the African
roots of black culture in America,
and emphasizing its solidarity and
responsibility for shaping its own fu
ture.
Change
Speaking to the audience, he said
"change is inevitable and gradual
and constant, and if you do not de
cide to direct the elements that
change you, you will get run over by
it."
Looking to the future of the black
movement, he said "hopefully a lot
of the energies which were expres
sed nationally (in the past) will be
expressed locally now."
He emphasized the need for local
action to solve problems because, he
said, "problems start locally and are
different in different places."
Rebuilding
"We have recently gone through a
period when we have lost a lot of
generals," he said, adding "we have
to always be preparing ourselves;
ready to take up the battle when a
challenge comes along.
"Our point is no one can do every
thing, but everyone can do some
thing," he said.
The performance received a stand
ing ovation. It was the first of a series
of events to mark Black Liberation
Month which are currently being or
ganized by the Black Student Union.
