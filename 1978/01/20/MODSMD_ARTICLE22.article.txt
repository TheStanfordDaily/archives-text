# Stanford cagers rout Alaska, 108-98
## 5 Cards hit double figures in high scoring battle; McHugh scores career high 23 
### David Georgette 
In a game in which the team
defense was left in the locker
room, Stanford had five
players score in double figures
as the Cards routed the Alaska
Sea-Wolves, 108-98, last night
at Maples Pavilion.
Center Jeff McHugh scored a
career-high 23 points to pace
Stanford. Wolfe Perry
Checked-in with 22 points,
equaling his career high, and
Kimberly Belton added 20.
The game's high score with
31 points was Bo Jackson of
Alaska, who made 10 of 21
shots from the floor.
Stanford led the entire
game, running out to a 12-3
early margin. The Sea-Wolves

twice closed within two late in
the first half, but McHugh
scored four points in the last
two minutes of the half to give
Stanford a 52-47 lead at inter
mission.
Stanford made 73 percent of
its shots from the floor in the
first half. McHugh made all
seven of his shots and went to
the locker room with 15 points
while Perry was five-for-five
and had 13.
"Most of my shots were
pretty wide open," said
McHugh. Perry had a lot of
open shots, too, especially
after he went on his spin move
in the lane and up for the
jumper. "The guards were
playing a gambling type de

fense," he said. "They were
going for the steal, and once I
got by them, I was home free."
And the Cards were home
free in the second half as they
consistently extended their
lead. They hit 100, the first time
a Dick Dißiaso-coached team
has hit the century mark in
Maples, when Tom Schmal
zried banked home a shot with
about two minutes to go.
Then Belton followed with a
lay-in, and Stanford had its
biggest bulge of the night 20
points.
"The score indicated it was a
run-and-shoot game," said Di-
Biaso, "but I don't think it
was." Dißiaso said the Cards
showed patience on Offense

and were waiting for the good
shot. "We wanted the tempo
the way it was from the offen
sive standpoint," said Dißiaso.
One of the reasons the Cards
got the good shots was the lack
of defense on the part of the
Sea-Wolves. Alaska had quick
players, but the Cards fre
quently were able to get open
and take a jump shot without
having an opponent's hand
waving in their faces.
Stanford finished with a 62
percent shooting effort for the
game, helped not only by the
open outside shots, but also by
plenty of chances near the
hoop. Over 20 of Stanford's 43
field goals were lay-in or
dunks.

But Stanford did not provide
a clinic on defense, either. Di-
Biaso called the defense "not
good," with the exception of
the first eight minutes of the
second half during which
Alaska managed only 11 points.
The loss dropped the
limegreen-clad Sea-Wolves to
9-11 while the Cards improved
their mark to 10-6. If they want
to get their 11th win Saturday
night against St. Mary's, the de
fensive effort will have to be
better. "They're going to run
and shoot it," said Dißiaso of
the Gaels.
St. Mary's will be playing the
first game in new McKeon Bas

ketball Pavilion. The arena is
the largest enclosed building
of its kind in Contra Costa
County, seating nearly 4000
fans for basketball.
Tomorrow's game will be
Stanford's final nonconference
match of the year. The Cards
resume Pacific-8 action next
Saturday at home against
California.
