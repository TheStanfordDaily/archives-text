An inspired medley relay
team from Stanford edged out
Long Beach State's star stud
ded foursome, setting the tone
for a 59-41 defeat of the
talented but depth-lacking
49er squad.
Jack Connelly led off the re
lay, the first event of the meet,
with an impressive 53.9, just
tenths behind Bob Jackson,
Long Beach State's Olympic
bronze medalist in the
backstroke.
Rob Weber, enjoying his te
nure on the medley relay, kept
the race close, splitting 1:00.3
for the breaststroke leg.
Sophomore Ail-American Bob
Hagberg, one of the Cardinals
outstanding sprint butterfliers,
meted out a quick 51.2, keep
ing the Cards within striking
distance despite Greg Jagen

berg, who increased the49'ers
lead to two seconds.
Responding to cheers of
"KNARL! KNARL! KNARL!,"
senior Jon Powell quickly dis
persed any doubt as to which
relay would emerge victorious.
Known for his tremendous
psych-jobs, Powell swam a
sizzling 44.85 anchor leg, leav
ing Long Beach State swim
mers in awe.
Said Powell after the race, "I
was tired of catching up in
every relay, just to lose by a few
tenths."
Although the meet's out
come was decided by the first
relay, Stanford did not ease up.
Rather, the natators swam their
best dual meet to date. In th&
next event, two Olympic dis
tance specialists matched
strokes for 500 yards before
Long Beach's Tim Shaw took

command of the gruelling 1000
yard freestyle. Stanford's Paul
Hartloff finished the4o lap race
in a seasonal best, 9:23.8 to
take second place.
Cardinal coach Jim Gaug
hran, pleased with Hartloff's
effort, said, "Paul is considera
bly ahead of the times he swam
at the same stage of the season
last year. We expect him to
place high at this year's nation
als, judging from his consistent
improvement this season."
In the 200 yard butterfly, one
of the best duels of deGuerrc
annals was witnessed, as Mike
Bruner took on upset minded
Greg Jagenberg, one of the top
butterfliers in the world. As
eight lengths of machine-like
swimming drew to a finish, it
was Jagenberg who touched
first, breaking Bruner's pool
record with an incredible
1:47.7.
Bruner will defend his NCAA
200 yard fly title in March, and
Jagenberg will undoubtedly be
a leading challenger to the
Stanford star.
Summed up Gaughran after
the concluding event: "It was a
very encouraging meet. We
have been training hard since
the weekend meets, but
everyone performed well de
spite the fatigue level."

In the 200 yard butterfly, one
of the best duels of deGuerrc
annals was witnessed, as Mike
Bruner took on upset minded
Greg Jagenberg, one of the top
butterfliers in the world. As
eight lengths of machine-like
swimming drew to a finish, it
was Jagenberg who touched
first, breaking Bruner's pool
record with an incredible
1:47.7.
Bruner will defend his NCAA
200 yard fly title in March, and
Jagenberg will undoubtedly be
a leading challenger to the
Stanford star.
Summed up Gaughran after
the concluding event: "It was a
very encouraging meet. We
have been training hard since
the weekend meets, but
everyone performed well de
spite the fatigue level."
An inspired medley relay
team from Stanford edged out
Long Beach State's star stud
ded foursome, setting the tone
for a 59-41 defeat of the
talented but depth-lacking
49er squad.
Jack Connelly led off the re
lay, the first event of the meet,
with an impressive 53.9, just
tenths behind Bob Jackson,
Long Beach State's Olympic
bronze medalist in the
backstroke.
Rob Weber, enjoying his te
nure on the medley relay, kept
the race close, splitting 1:00.3
for the breaststroke leg.
Sophomore Ail-American Bob
Hagberg, one of the Cardinals
outstanding sprint butterfliers,
meted out a quick 51.2, keep
ing the Cards within striking
distance despite Greg Jagen

berg, who increased the49'ers
lead to two seconds.
Responding to cheers of
"KNARL! KNARL! KNARL!,"
senior Jon Powell quickly dis
persed any doubt as to which
relay would emerge victorious.
Known for his tremendous
psych-jobs, Powell swam a
sizzling 44.85 anchor leg, leav
ing Long Beach State swim
mers in awe.
Said Powell after the race, "I
was tired of catching up in
every relay, just to lose by a few
tenths."
Although the meet's out
come was decided by the first
relay, Stanford did not ease up.
Rather, the natators swam their
best dual meet to date. In th&
next event, two Olympic dis
tance specialists matched
strokes for 500 yards before
Long Beach's Tim Shaw took

command of the gruelling 1000
yard freestyle. Stanford's Paul
Hartloff finished the4o lap race
in a seasonal best, 9:23.8 to
take second place.
Cardinal coach Jim Gaug
hran, pleased with Hartloff's
effort, said, "Paul is considera
bly ahead of the times he swam
at the same stage of the season
last year. We expect him to
place high at this year's nation
als, judging from his consistent
improvement this season."
