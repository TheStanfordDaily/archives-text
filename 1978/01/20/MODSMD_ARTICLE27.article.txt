## 
### Chris Haft 
The Stanford women's bas
ketball team showed a lot of
character Wednesday night,
quelling a couple of threaten
ing San Francisco State rallies
in defeatingthevisitingGators,
63-54,
Stanford held leads of 11 and
12 points in the second half,
and each time the advantage
appeared to be a safe one.
However, SF surged back to
within four points in both in
stances, and Stanford needed a
late scoring flurry to finally seal
the win.
Nevertheless, Cards coach
Dotty McCrea was pleased.
"We didn't panic in the end,
and I was happy to see that,"
she said. "They're a good team
one of the best in their
league and they blew us out
last year."
"Stanford is a good team,"
said Gator coach Gooch Fos
ter. "They passed well and
didn't make many turnovers.
But we sure passed lousy and
shot free throws lousy."
The mistakes Foster referred
to cost the Gators the game.
Harassed by Stanford's aggres
sive man-to-man defense, SF
committed 27 turnovers, com
pared to the Cards' 16.
The Gators also shot poorly
from fhe free thrpw line, con
verting only 10 of 22 attempts
(45 percent). Several of these
misses came in the midst of the
Gators' two big comeback
tries.
Stanford center Maggie Nel
son had another strong effort,
leading all scorers with 25
points. Besides hitting eight of
14 shots from the field, Maggie
sunk all nine of her free throw
attempts and had seven re

bounds. Freshman Kathy Mur
phy also contributed, scoring
15 points and grabbing a
game-high 11 rebounds.
It was a battle from the be
ginning. The lead changed
hands four times and the game
was tied three times before
Nelson took control late in the
first half, scoring eight quick
points to put the Cards on top,
31-22, at intermission.
Nelson began the second
half with yet another short
jumper to put Stanford up by
11, but the Gators, led by for
ward Karen Gai, soon cut it to
35-31.
A jumper by Barb Boylan and
two more hoops by Ann
Cooper gave the Cards some
breathing room, and with 8:17
to go, Murphy hit a 15-footer
for a 50-38 Stanford lead.
However, 5:16 passed be
fore Stanford scored again,
and SF took advantage of this
skein to come within 52-48. But
then Stanford found the range
again, and Boylan's jumper,
Stephanie Galef's fine driving
layup, and Nelson's two free
throws put the Cards out of
danger.
The Cards will be in action
again tonight, as they travel to
Santa Clara for a 7 p.m. en
counter.

Nelson took control late in the
first half, scoring eight quick
points to put the Cards on top,
31-22, at intermission.
Nelson began the second
half with yet another short
jumper to put Stanford up by
11, but the Gators, led by for
ward Karen Gai, soon cut it to
35-31.
A jumper by Barb Boylan and
two more hoops by Ann
Cooper gave the Cards some
breathing room, and with 8:17
to go, Murphy hit a 15-footer
for a 50-38 Stanford lead.
However, 5:16 passed be
fore Stanford scored again,
and SF took advantage of this
skein to come within 52-48. But
then Stanford found the range
again, and Boylan's jumper,
Stephanie Galef's fine driving
layup, and Nelson's two free
throws put the Cards out of
danger.
The Cards will be in action
again tonight, as they travel to
Santa Clara for a 7 p.m. en

ing San Francisco State rallies
in defeatingthevisitingGators,
63-54,
Stanford held leads of 11 and
12 points in the second half,
and each time the advantage
appeared to be a safe one.
However, SF surged back to
within four points in both in
stances, and Stanford needed a
late scoring flurry to finally seal
the win.
Nevertheless, Cards coach
Dotty McCrea was pleased.
"We didn't panic in the end,
and I was happy to see that,"
she said. "They're a good team
one of the best in their
league and they blew us out
last year."
"Stanford is a good team,"
said Gator coach Gooch Fos
ter. "They passed well and
didn't make many turnovers.
But we sure passed lousy and
shot free throws lousy."

to cost the Gators the game.

misses came in the midst of the
Gators' two big comeback
tries.

son had another strong effort,
leading all scorers with 25
points. Besides hitting eight of
14 shots from the field, Maggie

15 points and grabbing a
game-high 11 rebounds.
It was a battle from the be
