# Men's, women's teams in Maples tonight
## Gymnasts building for future 
### Dean Eyre 
The Stanford gymnastics
program hosts an evening of
competition in Maples Pavilion
at 7:30 p.m. tonight. In x the sea
son's only combined meet, the
men debut against UCLA and
California while the women
confront San Jose State and UC
Santa Barbara.
For gymnastics on the Farm,
1978 could figure as an impor
tant step towards a highly
competitive future. Stanford's
women gymnasts, in their first
year of varsity status, are rela
tively young (two up
perclassmen and five under
classmen). However, the addi
tion of Jackie Walker, AIAW
Region 4 Coach of the Year for
the past three seasons at
Louisiana State, offers the
needed experience and gui
dance for the Cards.
The upcoming season forthe
Cardinal men figures to be cen
tered upon rebuilding. While
finishing seventh in last sea
son's Pacific-8 championships,
coach Sadao Hamada has a
mixture of returning veterans
and many capable freshmen
recruited for the team to im
prove upon past perfor
mances.

Among Hamada's returning
competitors are Tad Bostick,
Ken Gorman and Chris
Takimoto. Bostick, a sopho

more hailing from Austin,
Texas, is the team's top all
around gymnast and specialist
in the parallel bars, the event
where he earned fifth in last
year's Pac-8 competition.
Stanford's pommel horse
standout, Takimoto, placed
third at the 1977 conference
championship. The junior
from Los Angeles also finished
11th in NCAA competition last
season.
As the team leader in the
rings, floor exercise and vault
ing events, Gorman should be
among the top of Pac-8
athletes, according to Hamada.
The Stonybrook, New York,
native is in his last season with
the Cards.
Hamada said that senior
Bobby Farb will not see action
this season. Rather than strain
his injured wrist, Farb will con
dition himself for international
meets later this year.
Leading the women's team
are Saundra "Sam" Muramatsu
and Dana Padden. Although a
senior, Muramatsu begins her
first intercollegiate season. A>
strong background of
exhibition/club experience
gives her the best shot at the
all-around title and the region
al.
Padden, a sophomore from
Los Angeles, will compete in
all-around with Muramatsu.

Her strongest events are the
uneven parallel bars and side
horse vaulting.
Hamada explained that ap
proval for two scholarships will
be discussed very soon. If the
program receives the pair of
stipends, a total of three would
become available for next year.
"Scholarships allow recruiting
of talented athletes we
would be able to replace the
five seniors (leaving after the
1978 season)," he said.
The financial assistance, plus
"a lot of freshman with good
talent will make a good team
within a few years," Hamada
said. Of the 20 men listed on
the roster, 10 are incoming
freshmen, so as they gain col
legiate experience, Stanford
should have a stronger team in
the near future.
Hamada's basic philosophy
of coaching is that academics
and the individual come first,
then the program and team. He
sees his role as helping "each
individual up to their
maximum potential," he said.
With their first varsity win re
corded, Stanford's women
show much promise, but not
without dedicated effort. "Last
year there were three or four
girls working out, not really a
team," Walker said.
Rather than having intercol
legiate meet situations prior to
this season, the club sport level
has temporarily hurt the gym

nasts. Walker said, "They're
not in the physical condition
they should be in and set back
psychologically" because the
women haven't trained with
the pressure of college meets.
"We make a lot of mistakes,
but they're the kind of things
you learn from experience,"
she added.
Walker left a nationally
ranked program in Louisiana,
but in California she feels there
is "more interest and more ta
lent to draw from."
She has two scholarships av
ailable to use and is contacting
prospective team members for
nextyear. "The future depends
upon what students get into
Stanford. We'll be nationally
ranked in the top 20 if the in
terested girls join the prog
ram," she said.
The women's varsity prog
ram has a bright future like
their male counterparts, and
for the same reasons coach
ing, potential talent and assis
tance from the athletic de
partment. "Stanford has done
a very good job it's given us
the things we need," Walker
said. "The men's program has
given fantastic cooperation.
Sadao did a lot to help even
before I got here," she added.
And as for tonight's meet,
Walker cautions spectators not
to expect Comanecis and Kor
buts, but they will see good
college gymnastics.
