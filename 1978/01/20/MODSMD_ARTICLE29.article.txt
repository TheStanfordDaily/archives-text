# Cards adopt more serious attitude
## Women's ski team tops Cal, Davis 
### 
Last weekend's ski team meet against Davis,
Berkeley and Sierra College unveiled Stanford's
potential as a competitive unit.
Stanford women took first place overall with
Jan Flaherty capturing third place in both Slalom
and Cross-Country events, entitling her to the
meet's Ski Master Award for women. Women's
captain, Laurie Graham also placed well in the
slalom event.
Dave Herbert received the Ski Master Award
as he led Stanford men to second place behind
Berkeley. A new team member, Howie Rosen
performed outstandingly as he skied to second
place in men's slalom.
Alpine coach Tom Hutton feels that this year's
women have a good chance of going to the
nationals in March. The women are trainable
and energetic and the majority of them will still
be here next year. The women's cross-country

team needs strengthening, but Don Dubain, as
nordic coach states that there exists real poten
tial for the development of a powerful cross
country squad.
Due to increased interest and funds the team
has been able to purchase its own nordic
equipment this year which facilitates training.
The coaches plan to implement a vigorous train
ing program both during the week on campus as
well as on the slopes.
With new standing as a varsity club sport and
the potential exhibited by team members at the
start of this season the ski team has adopted a
more serious attitude. Enthusiasm appears high
as they prepare to face Berkeley in a dual meet
this Saturday at Heavenly Valley. The following
weekend the team will compete in the Vander
bilt Cup Race.
