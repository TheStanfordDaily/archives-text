# Enrollment on the increase
## Foreign language: a close look 
### Kathy Andrews 
"It's generally true that when you compare Americans
with people from European countries, you find we do
not have their knowledge of foreign languages," said
Dean of Humanities and Sciences Halsey Royden.
According to a study recently conducted by the U.S.
Commission on European Security and Cooperation,
the level of interest in foreign language study in this
country has dropped, with declines in both course en
rollment and quality.
Concerned about the decline in foreign language
study here, French and Italian Department Chairman
Alphonse Juilland last February introduced a motion in
the Faculty Senate to study "the place and function of
foreign languages in the Stanford undergraduate cur
riculum, considering ways by which their study might be
encouraged and strengthened."
The Faculty Senate has briefly discussed foreign lan
guage in the context of the distribution requirements.
Discussions will continue after Royden submits the
study's recommendations to the Faculty Senate. Royden
is to complete the report before the end of this academic
year.
Juilland says the drop in enrollment referred to in the
motion occurred in first- and second-year enrollments.
This decline followed eliminating introductory courses
fulfilling the Humanities distribution requirement in
1969.
This year's enrollment figures, however, are increas
ing. "We are having quite a bit of increase in both Italian
and French enrollments," Juilland said.
According to Juilland, Italian course enrollments are
receiving large increases. "This winter quarter's enroll
ment has increased approximately 18-20 percent over
last winter quarter's enrollment."
Prof. Jean Franco, Chairman of the Spanish and Por
tuguese Department, characterized her department's
enrollment figures as "fairly steady" and in fact increas
ing for last quarter. In an effort to stimulate student
interest, "we tried to streamline language learning to a
two-year course. This allows students more time in their
third year to read literature and other kinds of texts."
Before 1969, proficiency in a foreign language through

the fifth quarter introductory level was a graduation
requirement.
Bob Beyers, director of the news and publications
service, recalls, "Students got involved on the SES (The
Study of Education at Stanford) committees. They were
successful in lobbying the faculty in eliminating the
foreign language requirement."
The SES report explains the basis for the revision: "We
believe that the time has come to abandon this self
defeating approach and to place on the students a grea
ter share of the responsibility for profiting from the
University's educational resources. A freer market for
both teacher and student is likely to lead, we think, to
better teaching and better learning. . . . It will be for the
departments, under our scheme, to decide what they
wish to ask of their students in this respect."
Prof. Juilland favors the reinstitution of the foreign
language requirement. "It is highly desirable," Juilland
said. "For a liberal education, every Stanford student
should have a command of a foreign language."
According to Juilland, a second language "contributes
very powerfully to giving one insight and command in
using one's native language. You also can understand
systems of communications and languages in general
from knowing a second language.
"Every discipline is intimately related to language,"
Juilland continued. "Language relates to psychology,
literature, sociology and mathematics. An understand
ing of a foreign language is very important for every
aspect of one's education."
Franco, on the other hand, does not favor the
reinstatement of the foreign language requirement.
"The problem with having things required is that it
makes them burdensome," Franco said. "I would like to
see a greater emphasis and encouragement on the
whole question of languages."
Royden expressed a similar concern for publicity of
foreign language criteria to potential humanities majors.
He would like to make these students aware of their
department's foreign language requirement early so
they may adjust their schedules to accommodate the
required courses.
