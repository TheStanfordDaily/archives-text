Begin refuses to reopen talks
Jerusalem Prime Minister Menahem Begin
lashed out at Egypt yesterday for "chutzpah"
brazenness in its peace demands, and he re
jected for the moment Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat's proposal to resume military negotiations in
Cairo this weekend.
Israel stands ready to reopen peace talks, Begin
said, but the next move is "up to Egypt."
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance met with Begin
and is to fly to Cairo today to talk with Sadat in an
effort to revive the Jerusalem negotiations, which
were suspended abruptly by the Egyptian leader
Wednesday.
After meeting with Vance, Begin told reporters
Israel was declining Egypt's invitation for Defense
Minister Ezer Weizman to return to Cairo tomor
row for renewed talks on military aspects of a
peace.
The prime minister, speaking to a group of
French Jews earlier yesterday, said it was "incon
ceivable" that the United States would pressure
him to make concessions to Egypt.
Webster named FBI director
Washington President Jimmy Carter yesterday
named appeals court Judge William Webster, a
Republican from Missouri, to become the third
director of the FBI.
"I think he will bring a level of intellect and
imagination to his new role that will help it per
form its duties better than ever," said Attorney
General Griffin Bell, who announced the presi
dent's choice.
Webster, 53, has been a circuit judge in St. Louis
since 1973, serving on the Bth Circuit Court of
Appeals. He will succeed Clarence Kelley, who is
retiring Feb. 15.
The attorney general said Carter decided Mon
day to choose Webster over the other finalist, fed
eral Judge Frank McGarr of Chicago, and asked
Bell to inform Webster.
Bell said he hoped Webster's confirmation hear
ings before the Senate Judiciary Committee could
begin in two or three weeks, and added he found
nothing in Webster's background that could
threaten his confirmation.
Webster will report to the attorney general, not
to the president, because "I do not want the head
of the FBI involved in White House operations,"
Bell said.
Black squatter camp leveled
Cape Town, South Africa Black squatters rac

ing to stay ahead of government bulldozers hur
riedly dismantled their flimsy homes at the Unibell
shantytown yesterday. The camp that housed
20,000 blacks just a week ago was expected to be
flattened by the weekend.
Before the demolition of the illegal camp began
Monday, defiant squatters had vowed to stay in
their shacks even when the bulldozers arrived. But
yesterday they were working with makeshift
crowbars to pry apart the corrugated iron,
cardboard and wooden structures.
Where they failed, two huge bulldozers plowed
through, leveling what had been a community
complete with shops, a school, churches and a
community-run police force.
Streams of cars and trucks stacked high with
people, baggage and building materials crowded
the few sandy roads out of the camp site in the
Cape Flats area, 15 miles northeast of Cape Town.
PacTel proposes rate boost
San Francisco Pacific Telephone Co. revealed
yesterday it would seek to boost nearly all its rates
by more than 20 percentthe biggest increase in
California history.
The state's largest telephone company detailed
its plans for the giant rate increase in documents
filed with the Public Utilities Commission, which
will rule on the matter. A final decision is not
expected this year.
The proposed rates would take effect in 1979.
The increased payments by PacificTelephone's6.l
million customers would boost the company's in
come by $471 million a year.
Under the proposal, the basic residential
monthly telephone bill would balloon from $5.70
to $7, a 22 percent increase. The flat rate for busi
ness customers would climb from $7 to $8.70, a 24
percent jump.
Pacific Telephone stated it was in a "critical"
financial situation. The company had a net income
of $351.8 million in 1976, $4O million more than it
earned in the previous year.

fended the Ford Motor Co.'s decision to stay in

ress."

day visit to this white-ruled nation his first in 10
years where he met with both white and black
political leaders and toured Ford Motor Co. opera

tions.

withdraw from South Africa because of the Pre
toria government's racial separation policy of
apartheid. But Ford said his firm "intends to stay in
South Africa."
Ford emphasized that his company's employ
ment policies have not been influenced by apar
theid, and said "the doors to equal opportunity"
are open to the company's 4700 South African

Webster named FBI director
Washington President Jimmy Carter yesterday
named appeals court Judge William Webster, a
Republican from Missouri, to become the third
director of the FBI.
"I think he will bring a level of intellect and
imagination to his new role that will help it per
form its duties better than ever," said Attorney
General Griffin Bell, who announced the presi
dent's choice.
Webster, 53, has been a circuit judge in St. Louis
since 1973, serving on the Bth Circuit Court of
Appeals. He will succeed Clarence Kelley, who is
retiring Feb. 15.
The attorney general said Carter decided Mon

eral Judge Frank McGarr of Chicago, and asked
Bell to inform Webster.
Bell said he hoped Webster's confirmation hear
ings before the Senate Judiciary Committee could
begin in two or three weeks, and added he found
nothing in Webster's background that could
threaten his confirmation.
Webster will report to the attorney general, not
to the president, because "I do not want the head
of the FBI involved in White House operations,"
Bell said.
Black squatter camp leveled
Cape Town, South Africa Black squatters rac

ing to stay ahead of government bulldozers hur
riedly dismantled their flimsy homes at the Unibell
shantytown yesterday. The camp that housed
20,000 blacks just a week ago was expected to be
flattened by the weekend.
Before the demolition of the illegal camp began
Monday, defiant squatters had vowed to stay in
their shacks even when the bulldozers arrived. But
yesterday they were working with makeshift
crowbars to pry apart the corrugated iron,
cardboard and wooden structures.
Where they failed, two huge bulldozers plowed
through, leveling what had been a community
complete with shops, a school, churches and a
community-run police force.
Streams of cars and trucks stacked high with
people, baggage and building materials crowded
the few sandy roads out of the camp site in the
Cape Flats area, 15 miles northeast of Cape Town.

Black squatter camp leveled
Cape Town, South Africa Black squatters rac

ing to stay ahead of government bulldozers hur
riedly dismantled their flimsy homes at the Unibell
shantytown yesterday. The camp that housed
20,000 blacks just a week ago was expected to be
flattened by the weekend.
Before the demolition of the illegal camp began
Monday, defiant squatters had vowed to stay in
their shacks even when the bulldozers arrived. But
yesterday they were working with makeshift
crowbars to pry apart the corrugated iron,
cardboard and wooden structures.
Where they failed, two huge bulldozers plowed
through, leveling what had been a community
complete with shops, a school, churches and a
community-run police force.
Streams of cars and trucks stacked high with
people, baggage and building materials crowded
the few sandy roads out of the camp site in the
Cape Flats area, 15 miles northeast of Cape Town.
