Correction
The article "The comic that toppled Al
lende"(Daily, Jan. 13) was incorrectly edited so
that it stated in its opening paragraphs that a book
"How To Read Donald Duck" may have played
some role in the overthrow of the Allede govern
ment in Chile in 1973.
The story originally stated that the book's co
author, Ariel Dorfman, gave a talk in which he
discussed a serialized children's comicwhich he
considered to exhibit "surprising parallelism
s"with real events, and helped to effect identifica
tion with the Chilean coup. Dorfman quipped that
his talk might have been called "The comic that
toppled Allende."
The Daily's article incorrectly said the comic was
Dorfman's book, and thereby incorrectly implied
that Dorfman was in someway connected with the
coup. In fact, Dorfman has said the present Chi
lean regime is "repressive and barbaric." '
