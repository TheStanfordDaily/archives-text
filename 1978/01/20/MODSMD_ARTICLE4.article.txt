Washington (AP) President
jimmy Carter held out the promise of
income tax cuts for 96 percent of the
nation's taxpayers last night in a State
of the Union message that chided
Congress for an energy deadlock he
said is becoming intolerable.
". . . On energy legislation we
have failed the American people,"
Carter said. ". .'. Not much longer
can we tolerate this stalemate."
His first address on the State of the
Union produced no major surprises,
nor did the separate 50-page written
catalog of administration programs
he presented to the reconvened 95th
Congress.
Still, he presented a hefty agenda
to an election year Congress he had
said he would not overload with
proposals.
Interruptions
Carter was interrupted 43 times by
applause during the speech which
took nearly an hour to deliver. His
Cabinet, the Supreme Court and
members of the diplomatic commun
ity were in the House chamber for
the speech.
Carter acknowledged the pre
sence in Washington of farmers who
are protesting farm prices they say

are far below their production costs.
The president inserted a section in
his prepared speech in which he
said:
"It's incumbent on us to monitor
very carefully the farm situation and
continue to work harmoniously with
the farmers of our country.
"What's best for the farmers, the
farm families in the long run, is also
best for the consumers of our coun
try."
Despite the frequent applause, the
initial reaction contained a number
of critical comments.
'Sound'
"Militarily, politically, economi
cally, and in spirit, the state of our
union is sound," Carter said in his
nationally broadcast appearance at a
joint session of Congress.
While saying the United States
faces "no single overwhelming
crisis," the president told the
curtain-raising session of the 1978
Congress that, nevertheless, "pro
found national interests are at
stake," notably in the realm of the
economy.
After first again appealing for
enactment of his stalled energy prog
ram, Carter sketched in broad out
line a forthcoming proposal to revise
and simplify the tax laws and at the
same time "reduce the tax burden on
American citizens by $25 billion.
Tax cuts
"Almost $l7 billion in income tax
cuts will go to individuals," he said.
"Ninety-six percent of American tax

payers will see their taxes go down.
For a typical family of four this will
mean an annual saving of more than
$250 a tax reduction of about 20
percent."
The president did not explain what
he meant by a typical family of four.
Carter also said he will submit to
morrow a plan to cut federal excise
taxes by $2 billion, which he said
would "directly reduce the rate of
inflation." In addition, he called for
"strong additional i ncentives for bus
iness investment through substantial
cuts in corporate tax rates and im
provements in the investment tax
credit."
Taking the wraps off the gist of a
new anti-inflation program, the pres
ident restated his opposition towage
and price controls and said:
"I am therefore asking govern
ment, business, labor and other
groups to join in a voluntary program
to moderate inflation by holding
wage and price increases in each sec
tor of the economy during 1978
below the average increases of the
last two years."
Education Dept.
Carter also made a strong pitch for
civil service reform and said he will
call for the creation of a separate
"Department of Education."
Touching briefly on foreign affairs,
Carter said his administration "has
restored a moral basis for our foreign
policy" and declared, "the world
must know that in support of human
