# Fac Sen discusses investment policy
## 
### Peter Brett 
Faculty members bombarded Pres
ident Richard Lyman with questions
about Board of Trustees-alterations
in the "Statement on Investment Re
sponsibility" during a Faculty Senate
meeting yesterday.
Assoc. Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy directed several broad
questions to Lyman concerning the
interpretation of the statements in
the recently adopted statement.
Abernethy asked how many
fiduciary obligations the Board of
Trustees has, and what they are.
Lyman replied that the trustees
would be considered to only have
one fiduciary obligation, if this
meant only a responsibility for keep
ingthe University as healthy as it can.
"Do economic obligations always
take precedence over other respon
sibilities?" asked Abernethy.
"No, they do not," said Lyman.
Whenever the trustees are con
fronted with a proxy vote involving
social responsibility the trustees will
have to ask themselves whether the
size of the financial effects and social
effects can be predicted, said Lyman.
The reason for the revision of the
language in the newly adopted trus
tee statement, according to Lyman,
was that the original language was

just too strong. "I'm sure (the trus
tees) feel in an everyday sense an
obligation to act," said Lyman. "Th
ese guidelines don't preclude initia
tive."
Several faculty members felt dis
turbed by the new language of the
trustee statement. Asst. Political Sci
ence Prof. Nannerl Keohane said the
language removed the moral under
pinning of the statement, while As
soc. English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
said, "The document has returned to
the negative and defensive tone of
that in 1971."
The Committee on Committees
members yesterday nominated sev
eral people to the Committee on In
vestment Responsibility. The Com
mittee's consensus was that it was
not their prerogative to block nomi
nations to the Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility, regardless of
their opinion on the wording of the
trustee statement.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Herant Katchadourian presented a
statistical report on undergraduate
education at the University. A survey
of 1975-76 graduating seniors, con
cerning their opinions on all aspects
of academic life at the University,
was included. Academic profiles of
undergraduates were prepared, as
well as were departmental surveys.
