' "Zionism is a political movement
organically related to world im
perialism and hostile to all move
ments of liberation and progress in
the world. It is a racist and fanatical
movement in its formation; aggres
sive, expansionist and colonialist in
its aims, and fascist and Nazi in its
means, Israel is the tool of the Zionist
movement and a human and geog
raphical base for world imperialism
. . . the liberation of Palestine will
liquidate the Zionist and imperialist
presence and bring about the stabili
zation of peace in the Middle East."
-Article 22, The Palestinian National
Covenant

In her Daily column of Jan. 16,
"Echoes of Vietnam," Rachelle Mar
shall draws an analogy between
American attitudes toward Ho Chi
Minh, the Vietnamese national
leader and the leader of the Palesti
nian Liberation Organization (al
though she omits his name), Yassir
Arafat. To the extent that these two
men can be labelled "radical" lead
ers the analogy is true. However, I
suggest it ends there.
While Ho Chi Minh was a popular
leader, representative of his people
in a struggle against successive colo
nial regimes, the same cannot be said
about Arafat. To begin with, Arafat is
not a legitimate representative of all
the Palestinian people. He is only the
leader of the Fatah terrorist group,
one of many splinter groups among
the various Palestinian terrorist fac
tions, which assumed control over
-the PLO in 1968. Moreover, the PLO
-has never been chosen by the Pales
tinians as their representatives in a
Tree election. (Most Palestinians liv
ing on the West Bank are Jordanian
T- Secondly, Arafat is not calling for
the end of colonial domination of his
people as did Ho Chi Minh; he is
-eraMing for the destruction of the
State of Israel and of the Jews who
Jive there.

I agree with Marshall's assessment
that "the concern is not simply
whether the Palestinians are entitled
to a nation of their own, but over the
nature of their leadership and of the
society they would presumably es

tablish." Self-determination does
not confer the right to set up an ap
paratus designed to destroy another
people, and this goal is explicitly
spelled out in the PLO Covenant.
Civil autonomy
Menahem Begin's proposal does
not approach "a total rejection of the
Palestinians' demand for indepen
dence," as Marshall claims. Rather, it
grants the Palestinians on the West
Bank civil autonomy, while maintain
ing an Israeli military presence for a
period of time.
When the Palestinians controlled
the West Bank in 1967, the Arab na
tions and the Palestinian terrorists
prepared to attack Israel, which re
sponded in self defense. Is it there
fore unreasonable to call for at least a
temporary military presence to as
sure Israeli security when we return
to that situation?
According to Marshall, it would be
unreasonable, for she has been di
vining "unmistakable signals that the
PLO leadership would adopt a con
ciliatory attitude toward Israel."
Does the murder of Israeli athletes
constitute such a signal? Does the
murder of Israeli schoolchildren at
Maalot? Do the countless bombings
in markets, in buses, in toystores?
Are the Israelis so unreasonable in
light of the atrocities committed
against them, in the face of the PLO's
refusal at this very moment to adopt
U.N. Resolution 242, which would
constitute r ecognition of Israel, or its
refusal to renounce the heinous pas
sages in its charter?
Apparently, to those like Marshall,
the PLO should not be tempered by
such ideals as decency, flexibility, or
an appreciation of reality.
Inhumane
No doubt, her motivation in part is
derived from the belief that Israel's
regime on the West Bank is funda
mentally inhumane in its treatment
of the Palestinians. Her charge that
"Israel has already resorted to tor
ture and other brutalities in the oc
cupied territories" is extremely seri
ous. It is true that Israel does not like
the role of occupying a resentful
population, but given the alternative
of PLO occupation or their occupa
tion, Israelis feel they have no

choice.
As far as the reports of torture, it is
essential to remember that almost all
of the Arab prisoners in Israeli jails
were caught committing acts of ter
rorism. Their apprehension will un
avoidably be forceful, and in their
initial detention Israeli police will not
calmly ask where bombs have been
planted or where compatriot ter
rorists are moving at large. If there is
torture, then it is not excusable. But
one cannot expect the Israelis to
treat these terrorists with kid gloves.
Finally, I would like to point out
that repeated support of the PLO, at a
time when their influence is on the
wane, when it is once again splitting
into divisive factions, threatens the
inchoate emergence of a truly mod
erate Palestinian leadership.
This summer, a group of moderate
West Bank Palestinian patriarchs and
businessmen began to make their
opinions heard. They did this despite
threats of violence from the PLO. It
seems to me that the hope for peace
is best aided by supporting men who
have the courage to speak out in
favor of harmonious relations with
the Jews and for control of their own
affairs, rather than those who make
self-determination conditional on
genocide.

-Article 22, The Palestinian National
Covenant

In her Daily column of Jan. 16,
"Echoes of Vietnam," Rachelle Mar
shall draws an analogy between
American attitudes toward Ho Chi
Minh, the Vietnamese national
leader and the leader of the Palesti
nian Liberation Organization (al
though she omits his name), Yassir
Arafat. To the extent that these two
men can be labelled "radical" lead
ers the analogy is true. However, I
suggest it ends there.
While Ho Chi Minh was a popular
leader, representative of his people
in a struggle against successive colo
nial regimes, the same cannot be said
about Arafat. To begin with, Arafat is
not a legitimate representative of all
the Palestinian people. He is only the
leader of the Fatah terrorist group,
one of many splinter groups among
the various Palestinian terrorist fac
tions, which assumed control over
-the PLO in 1968. Moreover, the PLO
-has never been chosen by the Pales
tinians as their representatives in a
Tree election. (Most Palestinians liv
ing on the West Bank are Jordanian
T- Secondly, Arafat is not calling for
the end of colonial domination of his
people as did Ho Chi Minh; he is
-eraMing for the destruction of the
State of Israel and of the Jews who
Jive there.

I agree with Marshall's assessment
that "the concern is not simply
whether the Palestinians are entitled
to a nation of their own, but over the
nature of their leadership and of the
society they would presumably es

tablish." Self-determination does
not confer the right to set up an ap
paratus designed to destroy another
people, and this goal is explicitly
spelled out in the PLO Covenant.
Civil autonomy
Menahem Begin's proposal does
not approach "a total rejection of the
Palestinians' demand for indepen
dence," as Marshall claims. Rather, it
grants the Palestinians on the West
Bank civil autonomy, while maintain
ing an Israeli military presence for a
period of time.
When the Palestinians controlled
the West Bank in 1967, the Arab na
tions and the Palestinian terrorists
prepared to attack Israel, which re
sponded in self defense. Is it there
fore unreasonable to call for at least a
temporary military presence to as
sure Israeli security when we return
to that situation?
According to Marshall, it would be
unreasonable, for she has been di
vining "unmistakable signals that the
PLO leadership would adopt a con
ciliatory attitude toward Israel."
Does the murder of Israeli athletes
constitute such a signal? Does the
murder of Israeli schoolchildren at
Maalot? Do the countless bombings
in markets, in buses, in toystores?
Are the Israelis so unreasonable in
light of the atrocities committed
against them, in the face of the PLO's
refusal at this very moment to adopt
U.N. Resolution 242, which would
constitute r ecognition of Israel, or its
refusal to renounce the heinous pas
sages in its charter?
Apparently, to those like Marshall,
the PLO should not be tempered by
such ideals as decency, flexibility, or
an appreciation of reality.
Inhumane
No doubt, her motivation in part is
derived from the belief that Israel's
regime on the West Bank is funda
mentally inhumane in its treatment
of the Palestinians. Her charge that
"Israel has already resorted to tor
ture and other brutalities in the oc
cupied territories" is extremely seri
ous. It is true that Israel does not like
the role of occupying a resentful
population, but given the alternative
of PLO occupation or their occupa
tion, Israelis feel they have no

choice.
As far as the reports of torture, it is
essential to remember that almost all
of the Arab prisoners in Israeli jails
were caught committing acts of ter
rorism. Their apprehension will un
avoidably be forceful, and in their
initial detention Israeli police will not
calmly ask where bombs have been
planted or where compatriot ter
rorists are moving at large. If there is
torture, then it is not excusable. But
one cannot expect the Israelis to
treat these terrorists with kid gloves.
Finally, I would like to point out
that repeated support of the PLO, at a
time when their influence is on the
wane, when it is once again splitting
into divisive factions, threatens the
inchoate emergence of a truly mod
erate Palestinian leadership.
This summer, a group of moderate
West Bank Palestinian patriarchs and
businessmen began to make their
opinions heard. They did this despite
threats of violence from the PLO. It
seems to me that the hope for peace
is best aided by supporting men who
have the courage to speak out in
favor of harmonious relations with
the Jews and for control of their own
affairs, rather than those who make
self-determination conditional on

' "Zionism is a political movement
organically related to world im
perialism and hostile to all move
ments of liberation and progress in
the world. It is a racist and fanatical
movement in its formation; aggres
sive, expansionist and colonialist in
its aims, and fascist and Nazi in its
means, Israel is the tool of the Zionist
movement and a human and geog
raphical base for world imperialism
. . . the liberation of Palestine will
liquidate the Zionist and imperialist
presence and bring about the stabili
zation of peace in the Middle East."
-Article 22, The Palestinian National
Covenant

In her Daily column of Jan. 16,
"Echoes of Vietnam," Rachelle Mar
shall draws an analogy between
American attitudes toward Ho Chi
Minh, the Vietnamese national
leader and the leader of the Palesti
nian Liberation Organization (al
though she omits his name), Yassir
Arafat. To the extent that these two
men can be labelled "radical" lead
ers the analogy is true. However, I
suggest it ends there.
While Ho Chi Minh was a popular
leader, representative of his people
in a struggle against successive colo
nial regimes, the same cannot be said
about Arafat. To begin with, Arafat is
not a legitimate representative of all
the Palestinian people. He is only the
leader of the Fatah terrorist group,
one of many splinter groups among
the various Palestinian terrorist fac
tions, which assumed control over
-the PLO in 1968. Moreover, the PLO
-has never been chosen by the Pales
tinians as their representatives in a
Tree election. (Most Palestinians liv
ing on the West Bank are Jordanian
T- Secondly, Arafat is not calling for
the end of colonial domination of his
people as did Ho Chi Minh; he is
-eraMing for the destruction of the
State of Israel and of the Jews who
Jive there.

I agree with Marshall's assessment
that "the concern is not simply
whether the Palestinians are entitled
to a nation of their own, but over the
nature of their leadership and of the
society they would presumably es

tablish." Self-determination does
not confer the right to set up an ap
paratus designed to destroy another
people, and this goal is explicitly
spelled out in the PLO Covenant.
Civil autonomy
Menahem Begin's proposal does
not approach "a total rejection of the
Palestinians' demand for indepen
dence," as Marshall claims. Rather, it
grants the Palestinians on the West
Bank civil autonomy, while maintain
ing an Israeli military presence for a
period of time.
When the Palestinians controlled
the West Bank in 1967, the Arab na
tions and the Palestinian terrorists
prepared to attack Israel, which re
sponded in self defense. Is it there
fore unreasonable to call for at least a
temporary military presence to as
sure Israeli security when we return
to that situation?
According to Marshall, it would be
unreasonable, for she has been di
vining "unmistakable signals that the
PLO leadership would adopt a con
ciliatory attitude toward Israel."
Does the murder of Israeli athletes
constitute such a signal? Does the
murder of Israeli schoolchildren at
Maalot? Do the countless bombings
in markets, in buses, in toystores?
Are the Israelis so unreasonable in
light of the atrocities committed
against them, in the face of the PLO's
refusal at this very moment to adopt
U.N. Resolution 242, which would
constitute r ecognition of Israel, or its
refusal to renounce the heinous pas
sages in its charter?
Apparently, to those like Marshall,
the PLO should not be tempered by
such ideals as decency, flexibility, or
an appreciation of reality.
Inhumane
No doubt, her motivation in part is
derived from the belief that Israel's
regime on the West Bank is funda
mentally inhumane in its treatment
of the Palestinians. Her charge that
"Israel has already resorted to tor
ture and other brutalities in the oc
cupied territories" is extremely seri
ous. It is true that Israel does not like
the role of occupying a resentful
population, but given the alternative
of PLO occupation or their occupa
tion, Israelis feel they have no

choice.
As far as the reports of torture, it is
essential to remember that almost all
of the Arab prisoners in Israeli jails
were caught committing acts of ter
rorism. Their apprehension will un
avoidably be forceful, and in their
initial detention Israeli police will not
calmly ask where bombs have been
planted or where compatriot ter
rorists are moving at large. If there is
torture, then it is not excusable. But
one cannot expect the Israelis to
treat these terrorists with kid gloves.
Finally, I would like to point out
that repeated support of the PLO, at a
time when their influence is on the
wane, when it is once again splitting
into divisive factions, threatens the
inchoate emergence of a truly mod
erate Palestinian leadership.
This summer, a group of moderate
West Bank Palestinian patriarchs and
businessmen began to make their
opinions heard. They did this despite
threats of violence from the PLO. It
seems to me that the hope for peace
is best aided by supporting men who
have the courage to speak out in
favor of harmonious relations with
the Jews and for control of their own
affairs, rather than those who make
self-determination conditional on
genocide.
