# Stanford students very repressed
## 
### David Strom 
"It was a beach party to which we
were invited .... Young and beauti
ful people were lying about. But the
astonishing, the shocking, the appal
ling thing to me was that they were all
silent, without gaiety or interest in
each other. No smiles, no laughter,
no exuberance, none of that hungry
curiosity about each other I was used
to. They barely answered us, sullen
ajid detached. It was as if they had
drunk a potion of indifference . . .
no sparkle, no ignition, no life ....
>"/ remembered Haitian parties,
bohemian parties in Paris, Italian par
ties ... I remembered exuberance,
the sensuous delight, the embracing,
the spiritedness, the physical vibra
tions. (At the beach) there was plenty
of music, plenty of wine, such a
dreamlike setting, and no life. It
never came to life .... The disillu
sion was so great that I left early."
4-from the Diary of Anais Nin, vol. 6
This past weekend, I tried. I tried
to gather together many different
types of people spontaneously, to
enjoy one another's company, to ex
perience something new. I ap
proached people I have never met
and invited them (on the spot) to
meet other strangers. This past
weekend, I tried to break out of my
narrow Cro Mem existence and seek
some diversion.
I failed miserably, and in the at
tempt, learned a great deal. It ap
pears Stanford students are ex
tremely repressed, narrow-minded,
short-sighted, and guarded. In trying
to provide honest entertainment and
an alternative to the usual, one is
greeted with distrust and many artifi
cial barriers.
Perhaps it would have been easier
if one suggested some sort of even
tual sexual outcome the 'tease,' as
it were. In going to other parties that
evening, this was apparently the
situation that made them successful,
i.e., crowded. This, and other social
situations on this campus, seem to
be lacking any real interaction
among people on any complex level.
Someone, that night at our dismal
party here at Cro Mem, continually
asked me what my fall grades were.
Perhaps my expectations were a lit
tle too great spontaneity is not
eaSy for everyone. Yet it is easy to sit
in'one's room, watch TV, speak to
the few people on your floor, and be
as passive as possible.
T guess I am disappointed. Disap
pointed in people quite willing to
remain behind quickly erected bar
ricades of smiling superficiality,
never interested in probing the
depths of any subject for fear of actu
ally finding something interesting,
challenging, thought provoking, or
consuming. Now, being identified
wifh an engineering student, one has

often heard these very same descrip
tions applied to oneself. It is unfor
tunate to see the rest of the campus
in a similar predicament.
I want to stress that in the time I've
been here I have met many interest
ing people, have made some friends,
and enjoy my position here on the
whole. But for some reason, I be
came possessed that Saturday night
in Stern's dining hall and felt a need
for some stimulation of new faces.
It's so easy to hide behind one's
books and work to death. Many opt
for this choice passivity.
My only suggestion: talk to some
one you've never met before. Just
one. Smile and introduce yourself. I
found it quite easy to walk into a
strange dorm and initiate a conversa
tion. Most everyone here is interest
ing in some way or another, and
would welcome the idea of meeting
someone new.
Without intellectual and social
stimulation, we all might as well go
home and save our money (or our
parents'). Seven thousand dollars
could just as easily pay for a private
tutor, where one would never meet
another soul during one's instruc
tion.
