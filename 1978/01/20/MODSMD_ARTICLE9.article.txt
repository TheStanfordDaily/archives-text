Native Americans
Four bills in Congress, if passed,
will result in the final and complete
termination of native Americans. HR
9054, introduced in the House in
September by Rep. Jack Cunnin
gham (R-Wash.), directs the Presi
dent of the U.S. to "abrogate all
treaties with the American Indians."
HR9950 ends all native American
claims to water rights and HR 9951
stops all fishing and hunting rights of

Native Americans. Both of these bills
are sponsored by Rep. Lloyd Meads
(R-Wash.).
Senate Bill 1437, introduced by
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), a
criminal code reform bill, gives the
federal government jurisdiction over
tribal government to prosecute
crimes in native American country
(i.e. driving five miles over the speed
limit will bea major crime underfed
eral jurisdiction).
Since this anti-native American
legislation has been introduced,
there has been a noticeable black
out of information in the news
media. There is considerable disbe
lief about HR 9054: "You mean this
bill will wipe out all the treaties with
American Indians?"
My family at the Wind River Reser
vation does not understand this at
tack to take away the few remaining
rights from a nation with settlements
agreed upon through treaties. We
have suffered many kinds of
genocide as a people and now we
hear Meads proclaim: "Indians have
gone too far."
And now we hear of a bill which
says to us: "This is your chance to
have equal opportunity with other
Americans. Those treaties were
signed long ago. We didn't know
we'd need the oil, coal and uranium
on your land. We didn't know big
fishing corporations would want
control of the waters and we didn't
know that The National Wildlife As
sociation would want to control the
hunting. So you'll have to find
another place to live just like
everyone else."
The Stanford Survival Ministry
pledges to defeat anti-native Ameri
can legislation and other forms of
repressive acts directed against
people.
