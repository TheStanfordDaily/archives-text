# Students to revive 'Stanford Review'
## 
### Becki Bridges 
Three years after its demise, the
Stanford Review, a student-run
academic journal containing under
graduate essays and research papers,
may begin publication again soon.
Former ASSU senator Pat Flinn said
he believes it is "really important to
have a scholarly publication on cam
pus." The journal's director, Greg
Mc Elveen, remarked that he was
"dissatisfied with the state of news
magazine reporting on campus" and
consequently favored the Review's
reappearance.
To get an idea of student interest in
a publication such as the Review, Mc
Elveen conducted a random tele
phone survey of 100 undergraduate
and graduate students. Seventy per
cent indicated an interest in reading
the publication while 58 percent said
they would consider purchasing one
at a price of $2.
Mc Elveen said he feels this is suffi
cient interest to support a comeback.
The Undergraduate Studies
funded .the publication from 1970 to
1975. According to Mc Elveen, James
Cibbs, then dean of undergraduate
studies, became "disenchanted with
the Review and quietly eliminated
the funds." Because there was no
student opposition, the publication
was discontinued.
Mc Elveen said that the dean's of
fice is now hesitant to become finan
cially involved with the project
though they "agreed to supply the
Review with an initial funding as a last
resort."
The journal's supporters are cur
rently looking into other sources for
funding, though nothing is definite
as yet. Two promising contributors
are the Office of Development,
which would provide contributions
from places not connected with the

University, and also the Publications
Board, whose function is to supply
funding for campus publications.
The projected cost for one publica
tion of the Review is $1600, though
Flinn said that the journal "will get
some of it back for subscriptions."
He also said the Review formerly had
a world-wide following; one of its
ardent subscribers was the People's
Republic of China.
Mc Elveen remarked that the Stan
ford Review was originally "the pet
project of Dean Cibbs who initiated
it to turn the student body more to
ward academics."
The bound journal, which should
be available at the end of this quar
ter, will consist of seven or eight
papers and perhaps some pictures,
said Mc Elveen. hie added that the
staff is still open to more papers, and
that students can submit papers by
leaving them in the Stanford Review
box at the ASSU office.
Unless there is an excess of good
papers submitted, there will be only
one issue of the Stanford Review this
year.

Elveen conducted a random tele
phone survey of 100 undergraduate
and graduate students. Seventy per
cent indicated an interest in reading
the publication while 58 percent said
they would consider purchasing one
at a price of $2.
Mc Elveen said he feels this is suffi
cient interest to support a comeback.
The Undergraduate Studies
funded .the publication from 1970 to
1975. According to Mc Elveen, James
Cibbs, then dean of undergraduate
studies, became "disenchanted with
the Review and quietly eliminated
the funds." Because there was no
student opposition, the publication
was discontinued.
Mc Elveen said that the dean's of
fice is now hesitant to become finan
cially involved with the project
though they "agreed to supply the
Review with an initial funding as a last
resort."
The journal's supporters are cur
rently looking into other sources for
funding, though nothing is definite
as yet. Two promising contributors
are the Office of Development,
which would provide contributions
from places not connected with the

University, and also the Publications
Board, whose function is to supply
funding for campus publications.
The projected cost for one publica
tion of the Review is $1600, though
Flinn said that the journal "will get
some of it back for subscriptions."
He also said the Review formerly had
a world-wide following; one of its
ardent subscribers was the People's
Republic of China.
Mc Elveen remarked that the Stan
ford Review was originally "the pet
project of Dean Cibbs who initiated
it to turn the student body more to
ward academics."
The bound journal, which should
be available at the end of this quar
ter, will consist of seven or eight
papers and perhaps some pictures,
said Mc Elveen. hie added that the
staff is still open to more papers, and
that students can submit papers by
leaving them in the Stanford Review
box at the ASSU office.
Unless there is an excess of good
papers submitted, there will be only
one issue of the Stanford Review this
year.
