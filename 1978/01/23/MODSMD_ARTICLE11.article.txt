# Stanford employees are ignored again

Last spring, in response to one of
the Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP)
demands of the May sit-in, the trus
tees former an ad hoc committee to
advise them on the future composi
tion of the Committee on Investment
Responsibility. This committee, in
keeping with Board of Trustees Pres
ident Peter Bing's concept of "com
munity consensus" on Stanford's in
vestment policy toward South Africa,
was composed of trustees, faculty,
students and alumni. It had no rep
resentation from Stanford's
employees.
Not surprising
This was not surprising. Hardly a
decision-making body in the Univer
sity does have such representation.
Even though Stanford's 7500 non

faculty, non-administrative
employees form the largest consti
tuency right after the student body,
they are seldom thought of as full
fledged members of the University
community.
Like the waitress in the restaurant,
they are essential, but generally un
seen and preferably not heard from
except in the execution of their
duties, and not made party to the
diners' deliberations. They are the
only constituency — unlike trustees,
administration, faculty or students
(and consequently alumni) — to be
preponderantly female, and they
have the largest share of minorities.
This denial of an identity to so large
a constituency is unconscious on the
part of some, quite conscious on the
part of others. The apparent over

sight of granting it a voice in the
"community consensus" was, in ef
fect, a rejection — all the more flag
rant because Stanford's employees,
being workers themselves, should
have the right to help determine how
their institution uses its considerable
influence and power over the situa
tion of their fellow workers
elsewhere, whether it be over the
miserable working conditions at J.P.
Stevens or the monstrous oppres
sion of apartheid.
United Stanford Employees (USE),
Stanford's union, requested the in
clusion of employees on the commit
tee. President Lyman replied that he
could not alter the composition of
the committee, "even if I were dis
posed to, which I am not." The trus
tees on the committee kindly offered
to represent the employees' in
terests for them. It was an offer one
could refuse.
Apparently lost on the administra
tion was the irony of denying a say to
a large chunk of its own community
in deliberations aimed at arriving at
an appropriate attitude toward a
country where one of the gravest
problems is a systematic denial of
voice to a substantial portion of its
population. *But then, our adminis
trators, hand-on-heart defenders of
the democratic processes — beyond
Stanford's confines — take it as a
given that in the corporate structure
of the University its employees leave
at the door when they come to work
most of the basic rights they take for
granted in their civic lives.
Tribute
It was doubtless a tribute to the
steadfastness and persuasiveness of
the three student members of the ad
hoc Committee who insisted on
employee representation, that it was
included in the Committee's final re
commendations for the CIR, and it
was adopted by the trustees.
But it was a hollow victory. First,
the representatives are to be ap
pointed by President Lyman.
Presidentially appointed represen
tatives are not representatives. The
administration's usual excuse is that
there is "no mechanism" for choos
ing staff representation. This is fee
ble indeed. For one, there is a union
representing a sizable group of
them. As for the rest, it would seem

an assignment well within the capac
ity of the University's best brains to
devise a system of elections that
would require just a little time, paper
and the inter-departmental mail — so
freely used, for instance, on solicita
tions tor the United Fund.
Guidelines
Perhaps even more important in
this case is the fact that the trustees'
guidelines for the new CIR effec
tively stifle the motivating concerns
that gave rise to it in the first place —
to make Stanford's investment policy
an instrument for social justice. Re
sponsibility in investment has mean
ing only if it can be exercised. If it is

inevitably subordinated to the
maximization of profits, a committee
for it becomes a sham, and
employees should follow the stu
dents' lead and boycott it.
We should indeed be meaning
fully represented in all decisions that
in any way affect us. But it should be
true decision-making that we share
in, not in window-dressing. By taking
part in a process that makes princi
pled decisions a priori impossible,
we merely lend ourselves to making
a mockery of the whole thing.
