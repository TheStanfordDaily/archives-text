# Indian treaties to be violated soon?

Two years ago national opposition
stopped the "Criminal Code Reform
Act of 1975," better known as S-1.
People recognized that the bill re
cklessly endangered the civil rights
of every American and opened the
way for making the United States into
a police state. But proponents of the
bill did not give up.
On May 2, 1977, Senator Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) introduced Se
nate Bill 1437 (S-1437) to be known as
the "Criminal Code Reform Act of
1977." This bill was pushed through
committee before opposition could
develop and was scheduled to reach
the floor of the Senate last Friday.
Kennedy claims that S-1437, a revi
sion of S-1, has been cleaned of
negative features but examination of
the bill shows that many remain.
Opposition to S-1 was based on
the fact that it. shielded the govern
ment from the impact of political op
position such as was expressed in the
civil rights and anti-war movements
of the 1960s and early 19705. Senate
Bill 1437 will do the same.
No picketing
It would be illegal to picket an in
duction center or to counsel a con

scientious objector not to register for
the draft. A forcefully written anti
war article which might possibly
reach the hands of a member of the
armed forces would be prohibited
under, "Inciting or aiding mutiny, in
subordination or desertion."
Tampering with a witness is so
broadly defined that organizing a
demonstration against a legislative
committee like the House Un-
American Activities Committee
would be banned. Demonstrating
within 200 feet of any building used
by a judicial official would also be
banned.
Section 3111 denies a citizen be
fore a grand jury of his express con
stitutional right, the right to remain
silent.
Blackmail will include the gaining
of property "by threatening . . .
economic loss or injury to one's bus
iness." This makes striking or picket
ing by labor unions illegal because of
the losses businesses will have.
Sabotage is so broadly defined that
any incidental damage which occurs
at a demonstration at a government
building or company under govern
ment contract would be a federal of
fense. (This included Stanford!)
No warning
It would be a crime to warn a per
son that he/she is being sought for
arrest. Likewise a person would face
a one to three year sentence for
warning an illegal alien that he/she is
being sought for deportation.
Section 3715 would permit any
evidence to be used in sentencing a
person convicted of a crime whether
it was admissable in the trial or not.
According to this section, it would
also be a crime to make a false state
ment to a law enforcement officer,
even if not under oath.
Senate Bill 1437 also increases fed
eral and state encroachment on the
rights of native Americans. Section
203 A would abolish the distinction
between reservations and other fed
eral enclaves. Section 6858 expands
state jurisdiction over Indian territ
ory. This is in direct violation of the
U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1968 which
expressly forbids any further spread
of state jurisdiction over Indian re
servations.
The preceding examples are all
unnecessary infringements on
Americans' civil rights and further
examples of the federal govern
ment's attempts to violate treaties
between the U.S. and Indian tribes. I
urge people to phone or telegraph
their senator and express opposition
to this bill.
