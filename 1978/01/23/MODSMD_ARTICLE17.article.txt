San Francisco (AP) — The
American art collection of John
Rockefeller lll—one of the
largest of its kind in private
hands—is going to the Fine
Arts Museums of San Fran
cisco, it was announced last
week.
Rockefeller said he is making*
the gift to San Francisco be
cause he feels that Eastern
museums already have excel
lent collections of American
art.
Rockerfeller, 71, first discus
sed his plans with Walter
Neuman, president of the
museums' board of trustees,
and museums director lan
White more than a year ago.
The gift was confirmed in
January.
Nueman said the collection
has an estimated value of $10
million.
In a letter to Neuman, Roc
kefeller said he deliberated
over his decision for a long

time with art historian Dr.
Edgar Richardson of Detroit.
"We increasingly became
convinced that a gift of our col
lection to your museums
would have greater impact
than elsewhere," he wrote.
The art collection dates from
the early 17th century and in
cludes artists such as Copley,
Stuart, Peale, Eakins, Sargent
and Homer.
Under the terms of the be
quest, Rockefeller will retain
ownership of the collection
until his death. Thus, the paint
ings will remain in his New
York home and offices, in stor
age and on loan to other
museums until they can be
gradually transferred to San
Francisco.
Rockefeller said he was mak
ing the announcement at this
time to help the museum's
long-range planning and pos
sibly encourage other poten
tial donors.
