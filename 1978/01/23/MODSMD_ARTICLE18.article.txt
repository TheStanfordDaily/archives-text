# Belton's 22 points lift Stanford
## Cards survive Gaels' stall, 62-61 
### David Georgette 
Moraga — For 26 minutes Saturday night, Stanford and St.
Mary's had pounded their way up and down the floor and into a
51-51 tie. Then suddenly, like a speeding car screeching to a halt,
St. Mary's stopped running and went to a slowdown strategy.
In the last 14 minutes of the game, the Gaels scored 10 points.
Stanford scored 11, the last two on a lay-in by Kimberly Belton
with 1:41 to play, and the Cards came out of the inaugural game in
McKeon Basketball Pavilion with a 62-61 win and an 11-6 record.
For a team which thrives on the fast break like St. Mary's,
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso said the slowdown "shows a lack of
confidence in your ability to score."
But St. Mary's coach Frank LaPorte had his reasons for trying to
bring Stanford out of its zone defense. "Basically, we lost our top
rebounder," he said. "They're killing us on the boards, and I
figure they couldn't keep with us man-to-man. Notre Dame goes
to four-corners, it's strategy. St. Mary's goes to it, it's bullshit."
The Gaels had lost their top rebounder, Kenny Jones, 18 mi
nutes before the slowdown began. The Gaels were on a 10-0
scoring streak at the time, and had an 18-10 lead, when Jones was
fouled on the way to the hoop at the end of a fast break. He
injured his ankle, and was on crutches after the game.
"If we had Kenny the whole way, I think we would tear 'em up,"
said LaPorte. "We had the momentum. We were running good.
But that's not an excuse."
Reasons or excuses for a loss would not have been needed,
though, had the Gaels scored in the last three minutes of the
game. After Nick Pappageorge had a short jumper bounce off the
rim and through the hoop for a 61-60 lead, the Gaels got the ball
three more times. The first time Norm Kelly was whistled for
charging into Belton, a call that was as dubious as some of the
others the officials came up with during the evening.
After Belton had put the Cards in front, Pappageorge missed a
shot. But the Gaels regained the ball with 55 seconds left when
the Cards lost a rebound out of bounds.
Pappageorge whipped a long pass downcourt, but then the
Gaels went into their slowdown to play for the last shot. When
Pappageorge drove to the hoop with eight seconds left, though,
his pass was deflected, and Belton came up with it. Belton was
tied up for a jump ball, but Wolfe Perry grabbed the ball off the tip
and the Cards grabbed the win.
That the game was even close the entire second half was an
accomplishment for the Cards. They had trailed 33-21 with five
minutes to play in the first half as tne Gaels repeatedly beat the
Cards up the floor on the fast break.
"We were spread out all over the court," said Dißiaso. "We
were crashing the boards from too far out."
But Stanford pulled into a 35-35 tie at half on the strength of a
14-2 scoring spree. During the streak, the Cards got two hoops
each from Belton and guards Mark Pitchford and Paul Giovac
c hini.
Belton's points gave him 10 at half after he had been limited to
two field goals in the first 18 minutes of the game. "Early in the
game we weren't running our offense too effectively," he said.
Stanford made only 33 percent of its shots before half.
Belton, the only Card to score in double figures, finished with a
game-high 22 points, along with 13 rebounds. The Gaels were led
by their backcourt duo of Pappageorge, who scored 17 points,
and Rick Bernard, who scored 16.
"I thought we overcame a lot of adversity to win," said Dißiaso.
For St. Mary's, now 9-5, the adversity of an injured Ken Jones
proved to be too much to overcome.

Belton's points gave him 10 at half after he had been limited to
two field goals in the first 18 minutes of the game. "Early in the
game we weren't running our offense too effectively," he said.
Stanford made only 33 percent of its shots before half.
Belton, the only Card to score in double figures, finished with a
game-high 22 points, along with 13 rebounds. The Gaels were led
by their backcourt duo of Pappageorge, who scored 17 points,
and Rick Bernard, who scored 16.
"I thought we overcame a lot of adversity to win," said Dißiaso.
For St. Mary's, now 9-5, the adversity of an injured Ken Jones
proved to be too much to overcome.

Stanford forward Kimberly Bolton is in a familiar position — closest
to the basket — Saturday night against St. Mary's. Belton was the
game's top scorer with 22 points and the top rebounder with 13.
Moraga — For 26 minutes Saturday night, Stanford and St.
Mary's had pounded their way up and down the floor and into a
51-51 tie. Then suddenly, like a speeding car screeching to a halt,
St. Mary's stopped running and went to a slowdown strategy.
In the last 14 minutes of the game, the Gaels scored 10 points.
Stanford scored 11, the last two on a lay-in by Kimberly Belton
with 1:41 to play, and the Cards came out of the inaugural game in
McKeon Basketball Pavilion with a 62-61 win and an 11-6 record.
For a team which thrives on the fast break like St. Mary's,
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso said the slowdown "shows a lack of
confidence in your ability to score."
But St. Mary's coach Frank LaPorte had his reasons for trying to
bring Stanford out of its zone defense. "Basically, we lost our top
rebounder," he said. "They're killing us on the boards, and I
figure they couldn't keep with us man-to-man. Notre Dame goes
to four-corners, it's strategy. St. Mary's goes to it, it's bullshit."
The Gaels had lost their top rebounder, Kenny Jones, 18 mi
nutes before the slowdown began. The Gaels were on a 10-0
scoring streak at the time, and had an 18-10 lead, when Jones was
fouled on the way to the hoop at the end of a fast break. He
injured his ankle, and was on crutches after the game.
"If we had Kenny the whole way, I think we would tear 'em up,"
said LaPorte. "We had the momentum. We were running good.
But that's not an excuse."
Reasons or excuses for a loss would not have been needed,
though, had the Gaels scored in the last three minutes of the
game. After Nick Pappageorge had a short jumper bounce off the
rim and through the hoop for a 61-60 lead, the Gaels got the ball
three more times. The first time Norm Kelly was whistled for
charging into Belton, a call that was as dubious as some of the
others the officials came up with during the evening.
After Belton had put the Cards in front, Pappageorge missed a
shot. But the Gaels regained the ball with 55 seconds left when
the Cards lost a rebound out of bounds.
Pappageorge whipped a long pass downcourt, but then the
Gaels went into their slowdown to play for the last shot. When
Pappageorge drove to the hoop with eight seconds left, though,
his pass was deflected, and Belton came up with it. Belton was
tied up for a jump ball, but Wolfe Perry grabbed the ball off the tip
and the Cards grabbed the win.
That the game was even close the entire second half was an
accomplishment for the Cards. They had trailed 33-21 with five
minutes to play in the first half as tne Gaels repeatedly beat the
Cards up the floor on the fast break.
"We were spread out all over the court," said Dißiaso. "We
were crashing the boards from too far out."
But Stanford pulled into a 35-35 tie at half on the strength of a
14-2 scoring spree. During the streak, the Cards got two hoops
each from Belton and guards Mark Pitchford and Paul Giovac
c hini.
Belton's points gave him 10 at half after he had been limited to
