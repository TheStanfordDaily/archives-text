# Traffic gate to keep cars out of Quad
## 
### Alfred Nakatsuma 
Because of the increase in unau
thorized car traffic in the the Quad, a
special card-operated gate is being
installed at the north end of Duena
Street, behind Memorial Church.
The gate is being built to reduce
the nuisance traffic and for aesthetic
reasons. The geology, language and
engineering departments have com
plained of noise and fumes from the
excess traffic.
In addition, the gate is being built
because of the danger to bicyclists
and pedestrians near the Quad's
blind intersections from vehicular
traffic.
The electronically controlled gate
will open only to persons with spe
cial cards bearing magnetically
coded tape.
The cards will be given exclusively
to University service vehicles, or
those of which the president's office
approves.
No criteria for exceptions have yet
been established. The two people in
charge of the operation are Captain
Walter Konar of the Department of
Public Safety and Amy Blue of the
Provost's Office. Cards can be ob
tained only through them.
Because of problems with contrac
tors and the rain during construc
tion, completion has been delayed.
It is set to be finished Feb. 6.
