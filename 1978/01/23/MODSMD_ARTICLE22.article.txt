## Individuals show improvement 
### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's men and women
gymnasts, in their only joint
appearance of the season, lost
out to the visitors despite excit
ing and improved perfor
mances Friday evening before
an estimated crowd of 1300 at
Maples Pavilion.
In thewomen'scompetition,
San lose State took first with a
team score of 124.05, while
UC-Santa Barbara and Stanford
followed with 113.30 and
109.90, respectively. Spartan
Kris Klepfer led entrants in the
all-around scores with 34.25.
Stanford senior Sam
Muramatsu placed second,
only 1.4 points behind, while
San )ose's Lorie Olson finished
third with an even 30.00 tally.
Klepfer took firsts in uneven
bars, floor exercise, and vault
ing. Muramatsu won the ba
lance beam event, nosing out
Klepfer, and also took second
in floor exercise and third in
both vaultingand uneven bars.
While Stanford's team score
dropped about 10 points from
the Cal State-Northridge meet,
improvement showed in the
individual scores.
"They improve when they're
up against harder competi
tion," said head coach Jackie
Walker. "Vaulting, floor exer
cise were stronger, beam
about as bad (as last week) and
bars improved slightly."

In particular, Walker said,
Muramatsu and sophomore
Dana Padden had fine perfor
mances. "I was really proud of
her (Muramatsu)," said
Walker. "On the bars, she fell
off but fought hard to come
back with the best floor exer
cise I've seen her do."
Walker added, "I was very
pleased with Dana. She's im
proved rapidly in each event
over the last three weeks."
Although the women's team
scores were close, Walker
thought Stanford would fare
better. "San )ose was a little
stronger than I expected. I
knew that Santa Barbara would
be close to us. I'm not disap
pointed — we were beaten by
two better teams," she said.
To prepare for the upcoming
meet with California and
Fresno State the team will
"work on improving perfor
mances — if we can eliminate
the falls we can improve," said
Walker.
"It should be a close meet.
Northridge beat Cal and we
have a chance to win. They are
both in our conference — if we
can beat Cal and Fresno we
would be second," she added.
Men
In the men's competition,
California took first honors
with 200.1 points, narrowly
beating UCLA's score of
198.30. Stanford's team score

totaled 189.10.
As with the women gym
nasts, there were some bright
individual showings. Tad Bos
tick placed second in all
around behind Cal's Moham
med Azerpy. Bostick took sec
ond in floor exercise and third
in both parallel bars and pom
mel horse.
Shep Kinsman finished sixth
in all-around competition in
cluding a sixth place in parallel
bars. Chris Takimoto won the
pommel horse event with a
9.75, a point ahead of the next
finisher. Other Card highlights
included Ken Gorman's two
firsts in floor exercise and long
horse vaulting, Al Nemcek's
strong vaulting (tying him with
Gorman for first) and Steve
Waichler's sixth in floor exer
cise.
Men's head coach Sadao
Hamada gave a positive as
sessment of the meet results.
"There was a big improvement
since the intrasquad meet. I'm
very pleased. Our good events
were floor exercise and vault
ing. As I expected our high bar
was very bad," he said.
As for individual perfor
mances, Hamada praised Al
Nemcek's vaulting and Ken
Gorman's performances on
vaulting and floor exercise.
"Chris Takimoto's 9.75 on the
sidehorse probably put him in
first runner-up position in the
NCAA standings. No one has
scored higher than 9.7 (in the

event this season)," he said.
Based on the meet perfor
mances, Hamada will be able
to concentrate on the weak
nesses of the individual's
routines. "We had an intras
quad meet a week and a half
ago to see who can do what.
We had a 174 team score (15
points less than Friday's score).
Then we concentrated on im
provement and difficulty, also
on improving consistency and
execution," he said. Instead of
adding new moves to the

routines, Hamada will "get
ready tor Pacific-8 competition
in March and develop compul
sory routines."
Despite having a young
team, Hamada is confident of a
good season. "I don't see any
problems (with the gymnasts'
youth). They are all very intelli
gent and know how to take self
discipline. They know what I
can do to help them as a coach.
I am very proud — they work
hard,'' he said.
