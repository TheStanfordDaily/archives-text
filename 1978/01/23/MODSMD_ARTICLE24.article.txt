Mideast peace drive stalled
Jerusalem — The 2'/i-month-old Egyptian-
Israeli peace drive, caught in a cross-current of
distrust and bitterness, came to a virtual
standstill yesterday as Israel decided to sus
pend the talks on a troop pullback in the Sinai
Peninsula.
The Israeli Cabinet met tor 3Vi hours and
voted not to rejoin the Cairo talks, which had
begun earlier this month after the Christmas
day summit meeting of Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister
Menahem Begin in Ismailia, Egypt.
The Israeli action, coupled with Egypt's
withdrawal last Wednesday from parallel polit
ical talks in )erusalem, brought the peace cam
paign started by Sadat last November to its
lowest ebb, and it seemed to leave the United
States with the task of trying to resuscitate the
talks.
That job appeared to fall to U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Alfred Atherton, who arrived
here Saturday for talks aimed at persuading
both sides to rein in their rhetoric and resume
serious negotiations.
Begin, reading a statement to reporters, left
room for later resumption of the Cairo talks,
and the Defense Ministry said there were no
plans to recall lower-level Israeli military offi
cials already in the Egyptian capital for the
negotiations.
Begin indicated Egypt would first have to
soften the tone of its public statements.
He said Sadat made "ultimatums that are
totally unacceptable" to Israel in his speech
Saturday to the Egyptian Peoples' Assembly.
In that speech, Sadat accused Israel of
sabotaging the lerusalem talks and said he
would not back down from demands for total
Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab lands
and for establishment of a Palestinian state.
Begin accused Egypt of waging a "campaign
of vilification" against Israel, and said he
hoped the Cairo government would "act to
prevent repetition of statements injurious to
the dignity of the jewish people and the Jewish
state."
Arabs voice criticism ot U.S.
Beirut, Lebanon — Arab hard-liners and
moderates alike sharply criticized the United
States yesterday following the break-off in
Egyptian-Israeli peace talks, and some looked
toward Washington for the next move in the
Mideast deadlock.

"It is up to the Americans now to speak to
the world," said the Saudi Arabian daily news
paper Al-Kiyadh, echoing Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat's appeal in a speech Saturday for a
massing of public opinion against Israel.
A Kuwaiti newspaper called for reactivation
of the Arab oil weapon.
The conservative Arab monarchies of the
Persian Gulf refrained from open attacks on
Sadat's solo peace initiative, saving their edito
rial censure for the United States, which was
accused of failing to extract sufficient conces
sions from Israel.
"If it (the United States) wants to be a friend
of the countries in the area that are not influ
enced by Russia, then it must break the hand
that insists on aggression and usurpation,
using American supplied rifles," Al-Riyadh
said, referring to Israel.
Kuwait's Al-Siyassah newspaper said the Un
ited States "is secretly shuttling the cards for
an international game that will involve the
Middle East and Red Sea areas."
The Al-Rai Al-Am newspaper of Kuwait said
the Arab oil states should launch a joint initia
tive "now that it is confirmed that Israel and
America want a peace that would enslave the
Arabs."
Carter proposes tax changes
Washington — President (immy Carter, while
calling for income tax reductions, is asking
Congress to takeaway deductions for state and
local gasoline, sales and personal-property
taxes and to reduce the allowance for medical
expenses.
But even with those changes, the Carter ad
ministration says, the president's total prog
ram proposals would mean lower taxes for vir
tually all taxpayers earning less than $100,000 a
year.
When the tax cuts and the reduced deduc
tions are combined, the effect would be to
lower the tax bill of a typical $10,000-a-year
four-member family by $i 12; at the $20,000
level, the cut would be $270. A single person
earning $10,000 would pay $i4 less; the $25,000
earner would realize a $245 reduction.
In a message to Congress on Saturday, Car
ter recommended tax cuts for businesses and
individuals to keep the economy growing, and
urged significant changes in the tax laws to
promote fairness, simplification and invest
ment.

Carter said the tax cuts are necessary to
offset higher Social Security taxes and the ef
fects of inflation and to help prevent the
economy from slipping into another reces
sion.
But to pay for those tax cuts without massive
increases in the federal deficit will require that
Congress also approve his "tax reforms" —
that is, elimination of some of the deductions
available to individuals «nd businesses.
Redwood vandalism debated
Eureka — As a hearing approaches on
whether the Kedwood National Park should be
expanded, loggers and environmentalists are
blaming each other for a rash of chainsaw van
dalism to the majestic trees.
The trunks of 16 state-protected giant red
woods in groves about 55 miles south of here
have been hacked and ripped by a chainsaw's
gnawing teeth the past month.
The rash of vandalism comes just as debate is
heating up over an attempt in Congress to add
48,000 acres of nearby northern California
mountain timberland to the Redwood National
Park.
A hearing is scheduled Wednesday on a bill
sponsored by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.).
The proposed legislation has been hailed by
conservationists because it would protect the
2000 year old redwoods and fought by logging
interests who want the trees for lumber.
'Sesame St.' debuts in Rome
Rome — "Sesame Street," the world's most
popular children's program, makes its debut
on Italian television today — and program di
rectors are braced for criticism.
In a country where one in every three per
sons voted Communist in the last national
election, the commercialism associated with
the program here and its Madison Avenue
style teaching techniques are expected to
anger leftists.
The U.S.-produced program, which has
spread to some 90 countries in the past de
cade, will go under the title "Open Sesame" in
the Italian version, and Ernie and Bert will be
rebaptized "Ernesto e Berto."
Wilmington 10 may get pardon
Raleigh, N.C. — Gov. James Hunt will go on
state-wide television today to announce a de
cision on pardoning or reducing the sentences
of the Wilmington 10, whose case has drawn

attention internationally and become politi
cally volatile at home.
The case of those charged in a firebombing
during a 1971 racial disturbance puts the first
term Democratic governor between interna
tional opinion and his constituency at home.
Amnesty International, which last year won
the Nobel Peace Prize, has called the Wil
mington 10 "prisoners of conscience." The
Soviet government has cited the case as an
example of human rights violations in the iJn
ited States.
The East German press has sent representa
tives to North Carolina to report on the case,
and rallies have been held in Paris and East
European cities as well as the United States in
support of the defendants.
In North Carolina, petitions have been circu
lated urging the 40-year-old Hunt not to inter
vene in the case, leaving the defendants to
serve out their sentences.
The case arose out of the firebombing of a
grocery store during racial disturbances in
Wilmington, a city of about 45,000 located on
an inlet along the North Carolina coast.
Supply capsule docks in space
Moscow — Soviet space scientists achieved
another first yesterday when an unmanned
supply capsule docked at the Salyut 6 space
station to bring fresh supplies to two cos
monauts who have been orbiting the Earth for
six weeks, the official news agency Tass re
ported.
The supply capsule Progress 1 apparently
used the second docking port on the space
station, alongside the Soyuz 27 space capsule
that the cosmonauts used to reach the Salyut
station.
The current Soviet mission aims to de
monstrate the feasibility of lengthy manned
space flights. Cosmonauts Yuri Romanenko
and Georgi Grechko have been in space for 43
days and Western experts say the pair may try
to break both the Soviet 61-day space endur
ance record and the U.S. 84-day record.
"For the first time in the history of cos
monautics, a transportation operation was car
ried out with the use of an automatic space
ship" to ferry supplies to a manned orbital
station, Tass said.
Today's weather
Fair through tonight. Partly cloudy tomor
row. Lows mid-50s to mid-40s. Highs mid-50s«
to low 60s. Northwest winds 5 to 15 mph.
