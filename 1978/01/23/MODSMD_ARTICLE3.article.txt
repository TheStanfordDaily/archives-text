# Suit filed to halt PA construction

### Cheryl Eschbach 
Two Palo Alto residents have filed
suit in Palo Alto Superior Court to
halt construction of the Sand Hill
Road project, charging that its en
vironmental effect violates provi
sions of the California Environmental
Quality Act.
The residents, Joseph Carleton
and Ellie Giomousis, objected to re
cent changes in the project which
were not covered by the approved
1975 environmental impact report.
These changes, which include a
new alignment with El Camino Real
and an additional frontage road,
necessitate a new environmental im
pact report, they claim.
The modified project, approved by
a city council vote last month, effec
tively completes a four-lane
throughway connecting Interstate
280 with El Camino Real. According
to Carleton, the additional traffic
generated by this will "encourage
unnecessary petroleum consump
tion and aggravate air pollution."

The suit also accuses two Palo Alto
City Council members of violating
governmental conflict of interest
codes. Council member Scott Carey,
the general partner in an investment
group located near Sand Hill Road,
"knew or should have known" that
his decision would "materially be
nefit" his business, according to
Carleton and Giomousis.
They also claim council member
Anne Witherspoon, a fundraiser
employed by the University, partici
pated in the vote even though Stan
ford has a "clear financial interest" in
the construction. The University
plans to develop a 1000 to 1200 unit
housing project along Sand Hill
Road.
However, both Carey and With
erspoon abstained in the City Coun
cil vote last month.
The suit's charges are "completely
ridiculous," according to Withers
poon, who said her actions were
"entirely consistent" with guidelines
of the Fair Practices Commission.
Carey, who said he had evaluated
potential conflicts of interest with an
assistant city attorney, also claimed
his participation was legal.
According to Asst. City Attorney
Louis Green, Palo Alto will contest
the suit. Green said the changes in
construction plans were "very
minor."
The Sand Hill Road project will link
Willow Road to El Camino Real along
a four-lane thoroughfare north of the
Stanford Shopping Center. Final ap
proval for the $6.6 million construc
tion was secured in a city council
meeting Jan. 10.
The University looks forward to
the project's completion, according
to William Massy, vice president for
business and finance, because the
new road w !l alleviate the traffic
congestion problems in the shop
ping center and on campus
thoroughfares.
Carleton and other opponents dis
agree. The project "widens lanes but
leaves the bottleneck" at the interse
ction of Santa Cruz, Sand Hill and
Alpine Roads, he said.
According to Carleton, construc
tion won't solve the immediate traffic
problem and "only attracts greater
problems" such as more industry
and increased gas consumption.

erspoon abstained in the City Coun
cil vote last month.
The suit's charges are "completely
ridiculous," according to Withers
poon, who said her actions were
"entirely consistent" with guidelines
of the Fair Practices Commission.
Carey, who said he had evaluated
potential conflicts of interest with an
assistant city attorney, also claimed
his participation was legal.
According to Asst. City Attorney
Louis Green, Palo Alto will contest
the suit. Green said the changes in
construction plans were "very
minor."
The Sand Hill Road project will link
Willow Road to El Camino Real along
a four-lane thoroughfare north of the
Stanford Shopping Center. Final ap
proval for the $6.6 million construc
tion was secured in a city council
meeting Jan. 10.
The University looks forward to
the project's completion, according
to William Massy, vice president for
business and finance, because the
new road w !l alleviate the traffic
congestion problems in the shop
ping center and on campus
thoroughfares.
Carleton and other opponents dis
agree. The project "widens lanes but
leaves the bottleneck" at the interse
ction of Santa Cruz, Sand Hill and
Alpine Roads, he said.
According to Carleton, construc
tion won't solve the immediate traffic
problem and "only attracts greater
problems" such as more industry
and increased gas consumption.

Sand Hill Road (above) is slated for widening and other improvements. But two
Palo Alto residents oppose the project and have filed suit to stop it.
Two Palo Alto residents have filed
suit in Palo Alto Superior Court to
halt construction of the Sand Hill
Road project, charging that its en
vironmental effect violates provi
sions of the California Environmental
Quality Act.
The residents, Joseph Carleton
and Ellie Giomousis, objected to re
cent changes in the project which
were not covered by the approved
1975 environmental impact report.
These changes, which include a
new alignment with El Camino Real
and an additional frontage road,
necessitate a new environmental im
pact report, they claim.
The modified project, approved by
a city council vote last month, effec
tively completes a four-lane
throughway connecting Interstate
280 with El Camino Real. According
to Carleton, the additional traffic
generated by this will "encourage
unnecessary petroleum consump
tion and aggravate air pollution."

The suit also accuses two Palo Alto
City Council members of violating
governmental conflict of interest
codes. Council member Scott Carey,
the general partner in an investment
group located near Sand Hill Road,
"knew or should have known" that
his decision would "materially be
nefit" his business, according to
Carleton and Giomousis.
They also claim council member
Anne Witherspoon, a fundraiser
employed by the University, partici
pated in the vote even though Stan
ford has a "clear financial interest" in
the construction. The University
plans to develop a 1000 to 1200 unit
housing project along Sand Hill
Road.
However, both Carey and With
erspoon abstained in the City Coun
cil vote last month.
