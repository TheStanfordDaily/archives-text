# Survey of students planned
## How does advising system stack up? 
### Brad Brockbank 
"There's no incentive for the fa
culty to study and to learn how to
become good advisers and there's
no real incentive for students to use
their advisers," said ASSU Co
president Greg Larson. "It's got
problems on both ends of the spec
trum/'
Criticisms of the University's advis
ing system are as common in student
conversation as gripes about the
food service.
"My adviser never comes to our
dorm."
"My adviser doesn't know any
thing about my field of interest."
"My adviser doesn't know the
course requirements."
"My adviser doesn't know the
major requirements."
Commission
The dissatisfaction with advising
on the part of students here promp
ted Larson to create a 20-student
commission on advisers. Larson said
that the commission, which met four
or five times last quarter, has not
come up with any recommendations
yet, but he said it is in the process of
preparing a survey to uncover major
student complaints.
"The survey will ask students what
they think advising should be doing
for them and how well it's doing it
now," Larson explained. "Once we
know what students want, then we
can model the program so it meets
those needs."
Larson pointed to two possible
improvements: institutionalization
of peer advising and an incentive
program for faculty advisers. The
ASSU set up a trial peer-advising
program in all-freshman Larkin and
Madera houses in the fall and Larson
the programs were fairly suc
cessful.
Defending his peer-advising idea,
Larson referred to a study made in
the winter 1974 which concluded that
students preferred to get help from
persons in their own age group.
"What we'd like to see done, for all
freshman houses, would be to have
one student associated with every fa
culty member. They'd become kind
of an advising team," Larson

explained.
Larson said that the ASSU commis
sion has also been receiving informa
tion frryn schools such as UC-
Riverside which have successful
peer-advising programs.
In addition to the 1974 study, Lar
son quoted a recent national survey
which said that 60 percent of the re
sponding students indicated that the
quality of advising needed improve
ment.
"It seems that the problem is kind
of a national trend," said Larson.
"This suggests that either advising
cannot be improved whatsoever or a
creative approach is needed to make
it better."
Further, Larson quoted a survey
done by the Undergraduate Studies
Office of seniors graduating last
spring.
In the 47-question survey,
freshman advisers received low
est ratings compared to other topics.
The ninth lowest rating was given to
major advisers.
In response to complaints about
the advising problem, the Under
graduate Studies Office modified the
procedure for recruiting advisers
two years ago. Before the change,
advisers were recruited voluntarily
by the office and the dean.
Proportion
Now, however, each department
is responsible for supplying the of

fice with a number of advisers prop
ortional to the number of students
declaring majors in their depart
ments.
Assoc. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Alexander Fetter said that
while some kind of incentive may be
helpful, he felt there would be a lot
of resistance to monetary compensa
tion.
"All the faculty are expected to do
some sort of work within the de
partment," Fetter said. "There are all
sorts of committees that need to be
run. I'm trying very hard to get
freshman advising recognized as one
way to fulfill a part of the general
obligation to th*> department."
Larson, however, supports the
idea of monetary incentive.
"If (the University) were to take the
$200,000, or whatever, that's going to
be pumped into Western Culture,
and pump that into improving the
advising system, they'd be doing a lot
more for the quality of under
graduate education than by creating
a requirement that everybody has to
take," Larson said.
Attitude changes
Volume Five of "The Study of Edu
cation at Stanford," which was re
leased several years ago, proposed a
$500 salary supplement for freshman
advisers. The study concluded that
less is needed in the way of structural
changes than in the way of attitude
changes. The study stated that a sal
dry supplement will cause faculty
members to recognize the impor
tance of advising.
Though Fetter does not foresee
much support for the idea of monet
ary incentive, he said that the faculty
does agree that the improvement of
the advising system is a faculty re
sponsibility.
"One thing we are trying to do
about it is to emphasize the idea of an
advising team," he said. "In each re
sidence, there is at least one adviser
from each one of the five general
areas: natural science, social sci
ence, humanities, pre-med and en
gineering.
"I've tried very hard, it doesn't al
ways work, to have the advisers in
troduced as a team at the beginning

of the year, to all the freshmen in that
residence," he explained.
"In some cases it works well, the
advisers think of themselves as a
team so that if they can't answer a
question, they will urge the student
to get together with one of the other
advisers. This depends very much on
the 'esprit de corps' that is created by
the Resident Fellow."
RAs' role
In addition, Fetter said the RAs play
an important role in making sure the
advisers are aware when the adviser
will be visiting the dorm.
"It's very discouraging for an ad
viser to come and find nobody
there," Fetter explained. "The advis
ers think of themselves as guests
when they come into a dormitory.
After a couple of times, if they're
made to feel unwelcome, they'll
withdraw and not come so often."
Fetter said he felt it should be an
adviser's duty to ask the students
about what they see themselves
doing in four years.
"The students should be strongly
urged to draw up written sample
schedules of what kinds of things
they would like to have done by the
time they get out of Stanford. That's
really the kind of thing the adviser
ought to be doing," Fetter said.
"It's not clear to me that it's
reasonable to expect the faculty ad
viser to have specific, detailed in-
