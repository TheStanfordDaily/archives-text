# Prof urges improved computer safeguards

### Richard Bowditch 
The national standard for protecting com
puter information from theft is inadequate,
Assoc. Electrical Engineering Prof. Martin
Hellman has charged.
Hellman said the coding method adopted
by the National Bureau of Standards, called
the data encryption standard (DES), will not
keep data secure from unauthorized use,
and said the bureau maintains the in
adequate standard because it has "been in
filtrated by the National Security Agency
(NSA)," which does not want to lose the
ability to examine private data.
For this reason, Hellman said, the bureau
has ignored the fact that he, along with
graduate students Whitfield Diffie and Ralph
Merkle, have developed a virtually unbreak
able system for limiting access to computer
files.
Concern
The increasing use of computers has
caused concern about theft of sensitive in
formation, and coding or encryption is a way
of safeguarding the data.
As Hellman noted in a speech outline
?[iven to the Daily, "The non-military need
or encryption was great enough for IBM to
institute a research etfort in 1968, and for the
National Bureau of Standards to promulgate
(the) . . . DES in 1976."

But Hellman and Diffie maintain the DES
56-bit key, a string of 56 "o"sand 'T'swhich
tells the computer how to encode and de
code data, could be broken by what they call
"brute force" alone. They said a wealthy
agency or corporation could build a
machine to search all the possible 100 billion
keys for the correct one.
When the two men sent their comments
on the system to the bureau, NBS officials
replied to all except the criticism of the key's
vulnerability. '
'Schizophrenic'
Of the NSA, Hellman wrote, . . it is
schizophrenic — trying to give our military
and diplomatic corps the best possible
codes, but trying to keep them from other
countries. It would therefore resist a pub
licly available cipher that it cannot break."
Hellman and his associates' work has itself
been scrutinized by the NSA. Their method
also offers a means of generating a unique
digital signature.
In July, the Institute of Electrical and Elec
tronic Engineers received a letter from
Joseph Meyer, a NSA employee, charging
that some of the Institute's members' publi
cations and some presentations scheduled
for an information theory symposium last
November could be prosecuted under the
Arms Export Control Act.

In his letter, Meyer cited three publica
tions containing articles by Hellman on cryp
tography. "It was quite clear he was refering
to me," said Hellman.
Denial
Through spokesperson Norman
Boardman, the NSA has denied any know
ledge of or hand in the letter. Science
magazine quotes Boardman as saying, "I can
state for the agency that we had nothing to
do with that letter. . . . Meyer wrote that
letter as a private citizen. But with respect to
any letter of that nature this agency would
not prompt anyone to do it."
Hellman said his initial reaction to the NSA
statement was that the agency had put
Meyer up to it, but "it may be that he did
write the letter as a citizen, in which case he
might be as much of an embarassment to the
NSA as he is a nuisance to us."
However, the question of legality has not
yet been resolved. According to staff coun
sel Mike Hudnall, the regulations were
examined with respect to Hellman's appear
ance at the November symposium, and
Hellman did speak there. But because of
questions about whether Stanford could
legally support two of the professor's
graduate students, he read their papers for
them, although the students were available
for questions.

statement was that the agency had put
Meyer up to it, but "it may be that he did
write the letter as a citizen, in which case he
might be as much of an embarassment to the
NSA as he is a nuisance to us."
However, the question of legality has not
yet been resolved. According to staff coun
sel Mike Hudnall, the regulations were
examined with respect to Hellman's appear
ance at the November symposium, and
Hellman did speak there. But because of
questions about whether Stanford could
legally support two of the professor's
graduate students, he read their papers for
them, although the students were available
for questions.
The national standard for protecting com
puter information from theft is inadequate,
Assoc. Electrical Engineering Prof. Martin
Hellman has charged.
Hellman said the coding method adopted
by the National Bureau of Standards, called
the data encryption standard (DES), will not
keep data secure from unauthorized use,
and said the bureau maintains the in
adequate standard because it has "been in
filtrated by the National Security Agency
(NSA)," which does not want to lose the
ability to examine private data.
For this reason, Hellman said, the bureau
has ignored the fact that he, along with
graduate students Whitfield Diffie and Ralph
Merkle, have developed a virtually unbreak
able system for limiting access to computer
files.
Concern
The increasing use of computers has
caused concern about theft of sensitive in
formation, and coding or encryption is a way
of safeguarding the data.
As Hellman noted in a speech outline
?[iven to the Daily, "The non-military need
or encryption was great enough for IBM to
institute a research etfort in 1968, and for the
National Bureau of Standards to promulgate
(the) . . . DES in 1976."

But Hellman and Diffie maintain the DES
56-bit key, a string of 56 "o"sand 'T'swhich
tells the computer how to encode and de
code data, could be broken by what they call
"brute force" alone. They said a wealthy
agency or corporation could build a
machine to search all the possible 100 billion
keys for the correct one.
When the two men sent their comments
on the system to the bureau, NBS officials
replied to all except the criticism of the key's
vulnerability. '
'Schizophrenic'
Of the NSA, Hellman wrote, . . it is
schizophrenic — trying to give our military
and diplomatic corps the best possible
codes, but trying to keep them from other
countries. It would therefore resist a pub
licly available cipher that it cannot break."
Hellman and his associates' work has itself
been scrutinized by the NSA. Their method
also offers a means of generating a unique
digital signature.
In July, the Institute of Electrical and Elec
tronic Engineers received a letter from
Joseph Meyer, a NSA employee, charging
that some of the Institute's members' publi
cations and some presentations scheduled
for an information theory symposium last
November could be prosecuted under the
Arms Export Control Act.

In his letter, Meyer cited three publica
tions containing articles by Hellman on cryp
tography. "It was quite clear he was refering
to me," said Hellman.
Denial
Through spokesperson Norman
Boardman, the NSA has denied any know
ledge of or hand in the letter. Science
magazine quotes Boardman as saying, "I can
state for the agency that we had nothing to
do with that letter. . . . Meyer wrote that
letter as a private citizen. But with respect to
any letter of that nature this agency would
not prompt anyone to do it."
Hellman said his initial reaction to the NSA
statement was that the agency had put
Meyer up to it, but "it may be that he did
write the letter as a citizen, in which case he
might be as much of an embarassment to the
NSA as he is a nuisance to us."
