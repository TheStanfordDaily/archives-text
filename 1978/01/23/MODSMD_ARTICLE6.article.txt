# Service organization declining

### Robin Millington 
Students who want to hang onto
textbooks after courses are finished,
along with the "buy-back" service at
the Bookstore, have been responsi
ble for declining interest in the Alpha
Phi Omega book exchange, the ser
vice organization's president says.
The number of students leaving
unwanted books at the A-Phi-O table
in White Plaza to await buyers has
been dwindling in recent years, ac
cording to A-Phi-O President, Char
lie Parker, and only nine people par
ticipated in this quarter's exchange.
Parker said rainy weatherwas a fac
tor in making this quarter's turnout
especially small — 16 persons ex
changed books during fall quarter —
but said the two longer-range prob
lems have kept participation low for
several years.
Students are unwilling to sell their
books because they believe they will
need them in the future, Parker said.
In most cases this is irrational, he
said, because the books soon be
come out of date or the students
move on to other interests and never
reopen the texts.
The other long-range problem, the
"buy-back service," did not exist
when the exchange began. An inde
pendent used books firm buys texts
in front of the Bookstore every Fri
day, marks up the price, and sells the
recycled books to bookstores.
"The book exchange is essentially
in competition with the Bookstore's
'buy-back' man who can offer
guaranteed prices at the end of the
quarter to people who want to be
sure they can sell their books,"
Parker said.
The exchange, on the other hand,
takes books on consignment, adding
25 cents to the price the book's
owner asks for the exchange's adver
tising fund. The exchange itself is
fully volunteer-staffed.
A-Phi-O is a service organization
growing out of the Boy Scout move
ment about 50 years ago. In addition
to staffing the exchange, the organi
zation recruits volunteers for the
campus bloodmobile.
