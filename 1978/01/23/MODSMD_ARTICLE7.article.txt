# Examining society's goals
##

Allan Chen

Society changes. However,
change is a very neutral descriptive
term and so not very useful to the
human race in its search for goals. To
say that society progresses is better,
but the meaning of the word prog
ress is open to question. There are as
many ways of defining progress as
there are people. Vet society does
exist and it does change, and so we
probably agree enough on the mean
ing of the word to develop a useful
basis for survival and community
building.
This observer's last column (Daily,
Jan. 4) examined one view of prog
ress, a view that has come to domi
nate the thinking of a large portion of
the human race. This kind of prog
ress, it seems, is a steadily rising
standard of living. It is a transforma
tion from the agricultural to the in
dustrial, and if some social theorists
are to be believed, the post
industrial state. It means more ad
vanced health care, education, con
sumer goods, wealth, industrial de
velopment and economic growth. It
is a chicken in every pot, a car in
every garage.
Progress
Progress, of course, is much more,
and many of its faces are at odds. In
spite of this, most of us share certain
ideals: alleviation of human misery,
and concomitantly, increasing
human comfort and happiness by in
creasing everyone's wealth.
One could also add the goal of
liberating the human spirit from its
prejudices, racism and sexism, and
freeing those who need it from au
thoritarian rule thatcurtails the rights
of the individual. Unfortunately, not
all ideologies or governments are in
agreement with this, so we cannot
really add it to our list.
These goals share two common
features. With the exception of the
last, which we aren't really counting,
they are all peculiarly materialistic.
Their origin is a worldview which
equates human needs and happiness
with material prosperity. Secondly,
they are needs of the body rather
than the mind — food, shelter,
health care, etc. Beyond basic survi
val needs, the minimum of which is
open to question, material goods
become luxiries for a society which
can afforrd to squander its re
sources. But no society can afford to
do this.
Self-defeating
Purely materialistic progress is des
iarable only up to a certain point.

Beyond this, our concern with com
fort, our desire for greater wealth,
our drive to achieve, and to build
prestige in the eyes of our peers is
self-defeating. Prosperity and
achievement no longer comfort and
nurture; out of control, they force us
to relinquish our ability to think
clearly, and to enjoy what we ac
complish as individuals and as a soci
ety. Furthermore, a society in such
an advanced state of economic pros
perity only sets the stage for its fall —
we have a long way to fall.
Perhaps, as a goal for society,
progress should be redefined. In
stead of making choices on a very
narrow basis, such as developing and
commercializing more capital inten
sive technology merely because it
boosts the economy, we should be
willing to consider all the positives
and negatives of a particular course
of action. This, so that we may arrive
at policy decisions from a more holis
tic, global point of view.
Extreme point
Ultimately, society may have to
consider a more extreme point of
view. No society, no matter how
small or prosperous, can luxuriate in
rapid material growth forever. Re
sources grow scarce, and an or
ganism that grows too large to care
forall its parts must readjust ordie. It
may be time to seriously consider a

steady-state society, one which
changes but does not grow.
We could end our headlong,
lemming-like onward rush into the
future, and begin a more thoughtful,
careful growth of a different kind.
Physical prosperity is, after all, an
ephemeral thing. It is easily swept
away by nature and bad fortune.
It might be time to counterbalance
this concern with the material for
something less tangible: the dignity
of the individual, the exaltation of
the differences among people so that
we may broaden ourselves through
those differences, and most of all, a
concern for the wealth that we carry
within us — curiosity, wisdom, a de
sire to learn, love and compassion —
the qualities of humanity.

is a chicken in every pot, a car in
every garage.
Progress
Progress, of course, is much more,
and many of its faces are at odds. In
spite of this, most of us share certain
ideals: alleviation of human misery,
and concomitantly, increasing
human comfort and happiness by in
creasing everyone's wealth.
One could also add the goal of
liberating the human spirit from its
prejudices, racism and sexism, and
freeing those who need it from au
thoritarian rule thatcurtails the rights
of the individual. Unfortunately, not
all ideologies or governments are in
agreement with this, so we cannot
really add it to our list.
These goals share two common
features. With the exception of the
last, which we aren't really counting,
they are all peculiarly materialistic.
Their origin is a worldview which
equates human needs and happiness
with material prosperity. Secondly,
they are needs of the body rather
than the mind — food, shelter,
health care, etc. Beyond basic survi
val needs, the minimum of which is
open to question, material goods
become luxiries for a society which
can afforrd to squander its re
sources. But no society can afford to
do this.
Self-defeating
Purely materialistic progress is des
iarable only up to a certain point.

Beyond this, our concern with com
fort, our desire for greater wealth,
our drive to achieve, and to build
prestige in the eyes of our peers is
self-defeating. Prosperity and
achievement no longer comfort and
nurture; out of control, they force us
to relinquish our ability to think
clearly, and to enjoy what we ac
complish as individuals and as a soci
ety. Furthermore, a society in such
an advanced state of economic pros
perity only sets the stage for its fall —
we have a long way to fall.
Perhaps, as a goal for society,
progress should be redefined. In
stead of making choices on a very
narrow basis, such as developing and
commercializing more capital inten
sive technology merely because it
boosts the economy, we should be
willing to consider all the positives
and negatives of a particular course
of action. This, so that we may arrive
at policy decisions from a more holis
tic, global point of view.
Extreme point
Ultimately, society may have to
consider a more extreme point of
view. No society, no matter how
small or prosperous, can luxuriate in
rapid material growth forever. Re
sources grow scarce, and an or
ganism that grows too large to care
forall its parts must readjust ordie. It
may be time to seriously consider a

steady-state society, one which
changes but does not grow.
We could end our headlong,
lemming-like onward rush into the
future, and begin a more thoughtful,
careful growth of a different kind.
Physical prosperity is, after all, an
ephemeral thing. It is easily swept
away by nature and bad fortune.
It might be time to counterbalance
this concern with the material for
something less tangible: the dignity
of the individual, the exaltation of
the differences among people so that
we may broaden ourselves through
those differences, and most of all, a
concern for the wealth that we carry
within us — curiosity, wisdom, a de
sire to learn, love and compassion —
the qualities of humanity.

Society changes. However,
change is a very neutral descriptive
term and so not very useful to the
human race in its search for goals. To
say that society progresses is better,
but the meaning of the word prog
ress is open to question. There are as
many ways of defining progress as
there are people. Vet society does
exist and it does change, and so we
probably agree enough on the mean
ing of the word to develop a useful
basis for survival and community
building.
This observer's last column (Daily,
Jan. 4) examined one view of prog
ress, a view that has come to domi
nate the thinking of a large portion of
the human race. This kind of prog
ress, it seems, is a steadily rising
standard of living. It is a transforma
tion from the agricultural to the in
dustrial, and if some social theorists
are to be believed, the post
industrial state. It means more ad
vanced health care, education, con
sumer goods, wealth, industrial de
velopment and economic growth. It
is a chicken in every pot, a car in
