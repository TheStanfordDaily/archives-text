Building
Rose-lavender, fancy frilly and made
up
to a tee. Coy, coquettish and gaming,
it seems a likely compliment to be.
The image faded, tattered and
shelved, is no longer
a guarantee, of soft complying will,
tenderness, or tamed sentimentality.
From the submissive role antici
pated,
is wrought and brought forth from
the fire trued,
a new stature taken up, assumed.
Loosed from the corsette of tradi
tional modes
and manly inventions, she is more
cognisant
of. the position she has earnestly at-
I tained.
Yet the struggle to be accepted as a
person must be a private battle
waged and won.
Meleanna Meyer
I was moved to write this poem
called "Building," in response to
what was said by Rita Mae Brown in
her keynote-address given on Oc
tober 18, 1977. Revisiting today,
those "visions and revisions" of the
women's movement discussed that

particular night left me doubtful as to
where I belong in the feminist
movement â€” if at all.
I do not feel an urgency or need to
"fit in" to any group per se, but I do
feel a commitment to certain beliefs
and ideals and only need to find a
voice of strength and consciousness
that can carry my concerns.
I would be pleased to find a wo
men's middle-ground collective; a
group of dedicated individuals de
voted to researching flexible alterna
tives to dealing with men and better
handling the feminist situation. It is
near to impossible to overlook the
discrimination that has gone on his
torically against women, but equally
as ludicrous to continue those same
tactics, using a reverse prejudice to
deal with men.
Greater perspective of the situa
tion and continued tolerance will
hopefully enable women to develop
viable working alternatives to their
interpersonal relationships with
men. The old adage of "treating fire
with fire" is a foolish thought to pur
sue in this discussion because
everyone will get "burned" in the
end. Let's take on water to bring the
fire under control. As water seems

the most likely in dealing with a fire,
perhaps a new approach is called for
to ameliorate our predicament.
Need to reassess
We need to reassess the basic
problem of inequality and take
charge of it as it is first and foremost,
our problem because it affects us di
rectly. Instead of first trying to
change another's image of us, we
first have to make those changes
ourselves. In the poem "Building,"
there is mention of a "private battle"
that needs to be waged and won. In
my estimation insightful direction,
leadership, input and backing from
others will augment the feminist pos
ition, but in the final analysis the suc
cess each individual makes in effect
ing change will determine the ulti
mate success of the feminist move
ment.
Any realistic change on a grand
iose scale is difficult to effect simply
because problems of this scope are
outside the arena of workable and
realistic change. Water is the most
effective combatant to fire, but it
takes many committed and know
ledgeable fire-fighters working to
gether to bring a raging fire under
control. Analagous to fire-fighting
should be our approach to dealing
with the problem of inequality; first,
on a level of individual commitment
towards an agreed upon goal. Sec
ondly, as a group, people must rally
around those basic ideals and perse
vere, keeping those final aspirations
always in mind.
Continual effort
Equality becomes a reality only
through continual effort and striving
for the development of trust and re
spect which are embodied in integ
rity. All of these "tools" take time to
build on. It is this process of building
that is so important; a private under
taking that each of us has to assume.
We have come a far distance and
can not afford to jeopardize those
steps gained inthis march. Wewould
no longer have to feel boxed in or
stereotyped by others if we could
just free ourselves from this "mental
bondage." Improved self-image and
greater self-confidence is a constant
effort. There is a greater freedom
that we have earned from out of this
struggle, but greater responsibilities
are ours if we are to continue in this
slow evolution of change.
We have become more cognizant
of our position and need to maintain
this awareness, and tenaciously st
rive towards the ultimate end of ac
ceptance . . . not so much as man or
woman, but acceptance as a person.
