Berlin article
An unfortunate set of misun
derstandings led to the publication
of several inaccurate and misleading
statements in the article (Daily, )an.
16} entitled "Mancall hosts Berlin
studies center opening." I would like
to set the record straight.
Classes and office space for the
Berlin Program are located in the
Villa Muthesius, which Stanford
rentsfrom the city of Berlin. The villa,
which is of architectural significance,
was in disrepair and it has been ex
tensively renovated by the city of Ber
lin at its own initiative. The building
also houses up to 20 students per
quarter. Every effort has been made
to house both Stanford and Berlin
university students in the Villa
Muthesius in order to create a
German-American student commun
ity. At present, 13 Americans and
seven German students live in the
villa. Some Stanford students still live
in private homes, in families, and in
student dormitories in Berlin. The
use of the Villa Muthesius was of
fered Stanford after long negotia
tions on the part of many Germans

and Americans both in the academic
and diplomatic communities.
Stanford representatives who
travelled from California to Berlin for
the opening ceremonies were Pro
fessor Mark Mancall, director of
overseas studies, Provost William
Miller and Professor Walter Lohnes,
chairman, German studies.
History Professor Gordon Craig
has been a member of the faculty of
the Berlin Free University since 1962,
is an honorary member of the Berlin
Historical Commission, and is a
member of the Friedrich-Meinecke
Institut. He has offered invaluable
advice and consultation on the for
mation of the academic program in
Berlin, and many of his German col
leagues have taught Stanford stu
dents in Berlin.
Faculty for 1977-78 include Craig,
History Professor Paul Robinson,
German Professors Gerhard Huber
and Franz Neckenig, and riewly
appointed language coordinator
Gregory Mico.
