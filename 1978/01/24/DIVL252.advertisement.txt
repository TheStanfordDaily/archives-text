TO THE CIRCULATION MANAGER,
STANFORD DAILY
Although complaints may seem to rival cheers
There must be those, who out there these last years,
Would like to tell you thanks — you see, they care.
("The Da"ies ... are they late? They're wet. They're
where?")
And campus-wide from Mayfield, Welch, and Serra
The days without a paper are a terror.
They bless their Dailies, curse the rains that wet em,
And silently rejoice those days they get em.
Thomas Wyatt burned and froze in vain —
Indifferent silence, adoration's pain —
And by example, we know love's not fair.
("The Dailies ... are they late? They're wet. They're
where?")
While offices are yawning every A.M.
The secretaries' phone calls speak of mayhem;
Professors, students, staff can all be surly
If Dailies are not circulating early.
Now see as praise the calls you thought were bitter.
(Plant Services see papers more as litter.)
A Circulation Czar is loved by many . . .
And so are Stanford Dailies. ("Are there any?")
