If you are over 25 and have re
turned to study here, you are a pros
pective member of SMARTS.
The newly formed organization,
Students Making a Return to Stan
ford, is designed to "establish a net
work" between returning students
and to "have fun," said Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Leah Kaplan, who is
working with the group.
SMARTS will attempt to function as
a "support group" to counter feel
ings of isolation many returning stu
dents may have, SMARTS Co
chairperson Betty Belle Smith Knox
said.
Knox said at an organizational bag
lunch Thursday SMARTS will provide
"nonprofessional group therapy"
where "an exchange of ideas can oc
cur" between people who have
"nonacademic responsibilities"
such as businesses, spouses or chil
dren in common.
Co-chairperson Lois Foyt told the
meeting she hopes SMARTS will be
"an ongoing social organization"
which will continue after the current
members have completed their de
gree programs.
Knox, a grandmother of two who
has returned after a 29-year absence
as a graduate student in education,
said she is involved in a study of
female returnees over 30 and hopes
the idea of returning to study can be
"demystified."
Some of the 35 members who at
tended the initial meeting discussed
problems associated with returning
to school after a prolonged absence.
Many expressed an initial feeling
of awkwardness in class. But they
added they soon realized these feel
ings were usually self imposed, and
there were easily accepted by tellow
students.
However, some members said
there are social barriers which isolate
the returnees. There is the fear of
"trading the isolation of homemaker
for isolation on campus," added one
member.
