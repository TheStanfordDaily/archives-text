# 'The truth about how it is in Chile'

Michael von Gortler

jorge Heine's commentary (Daily,
Jan. 9) that "Chilean support of (the)
military (is) meaningless" is a weak
attempt to show that the Chileans are
unsatisfied with the present gov
ernment. Perhaps I can erase a few of
his misleading ideas with my own
observations. I may not be a graduate
student in political science, but I
think I can say a few things about
Chile: I lived there for three years
before, during and after the coup
d'etat of Sept. 11, 1973.
To understand the present attitude
of the Chilean people we must go
back to the election of President Sal
vador Allende. Americans are so
quick to lament the overthrow of a
"freely elected, democratic govern
ment." The truth of the matter is that
Allende was no more the choice of
the people than Fidel Castro was the
choice of the people in Cuba.
Fact: Allende received only ap
proximately 37 percent of the elec
toral vote in 1970; his two oppo
nents, )orge Alessandri and Radom

iro Tomic, received approximately 35
percent and 28 percent of the vote,
respectively. Because no candidate
won the majority, Congress held a
special session and voted in Allende.
'Down the path'
Opponents of the junta bitterly
decry the totalitarian form of gov
ernment. Yet Allende publicly de
clared that he would lead Chile
"down the path to socialism." His
Plan Zeta (Operation "Z"), to have
occurred on Sept. 12, 1973, was to
allow his communist and socialist
supporters take to arms and institute
Allende as absolute dictator in Chile.
Fact: After the coup thousands of
secret caches were found through
out the country, containing literally
hundreds of thousands of rtfles,
machine guns, mortars and gre
nades. These weapons were smug
gled into Chile by none other than
Allende himself, who disguised them
in crates as works of art for his presi
dential palace. Heine can never

argue with me about the reality of
these caches: I witnessed their dis
covery in places as little as two blocks
from my home in Santiago.
Those who denigrate the junta
speakofviolationsof human rights in
Chile. But what of the rights of the
people under Allende? No one
seems to remember that there was
no food or oil; that the schools had
to be shut down because of the vio
lent confrontations between student
political groups; that innocent
people were gunned down in the
streets by the warring political fac
tions; that Marxist beliefs were
forced upon all students in the uni
versities of Chile; lest anyone doubt
the truth of these things, let me as
sure you that they did not come out
of any propagandist pamphlets dis
tributed by the junta; I saw them
happen with my own eyes as a stu
dent at the University of Chile.
In brief, Chile under Allende was a
country on a self-destruct course. At
the time of his deposition the infla
tion rate was a solid 300 percent, and
fast approaching 1000 percent.
Chile's foreign credit was destroyed
by Allende's inept economic
policies. National industry became a
shambles as his working-class sup
porters forcefully took over busines
ses in the private economic sector,
and his detractors rallied with
nationwide general strikes designed
to force Allende out of office.
Oppressive
I don't deny that the junta is op
pressive, is totalitarian. But it must be
understood that very drastic condi
tions were necessary to restore
peace and order to Chile, and to get
the country back on its feet. In his
article Heine says that "in Chile to
day, all political parties are ban
ned . . does he really find this so
surprising? Given the conditions of
terrorism, anarchy and chaos which
prevailed in Chile it is no wonder that
the junta had to end political activity
in order for any progress to be made
at all.
Heine also states that "the country
is under state of siege, and a curfew
is effective." This is merely a lame
attempt to make it seem as though all
Chileans live in a terrorized police
state. The truth is that the "estado de
sitio" is simply an official designa

tion, much as a governor may declare
a certain country a "disaster area."
People work and go about their bus
iness as they normally would.
As for the curfew, I think it was one
of the best actions the junta has ever
taken. Though it is now in effect for
only a few hours in the early morn
ing, it once lasted the better part of
the night. Terrorists were finally har
nessed and their activities brought to
an end. The citizens no longer need
live in fear of senseless acts of de
struction and killing. I should know:
a bomb was once heaved over the
fence into my front yard. (My father
is an American government official in
Chile.) Human rights, did I hear you
say?
Five remain
Heine claims that there is strict
press censorship, and that of 11
dailies, only five remain. Both state
ments are true. But his reasoning is
deceitful. First of all, the six papers
that no longer exist were the party
publications of the various political
factions that existed at the time. It
should be rather obvious that if the
parties themselves are gone (as
Heine explains), then so, too, will
their publications disappear. Heine
goes on to say that of the remaining
five dailies, three belong to El Mer
curio. He claims they are all "subser
viently pro-regime."
Fact: El Mercurio has been in Chile
for some 90 years and has always
been the leader in conservative jour
nalism in that country. So why
shouldn't we expect it to still be
around?
Heine then coyly notes that the
fourth remaining daily is one that be
longs "to the government." He tries
to make it seem that this paper is
some sort of propagandist publica
tion put out by the junta. Fact: The
daily, known as "El Diario Oficial," is
simply a publication of all the official
government proceedings; in it are
published the texts of legislation, tax
information, and official transac
tions; it is similar in nature to our
own Congressional Record.
Heine is further deceptive in that
he does not even list the name of the
fifth remaining daily. Why does he
fail to mention it? Because the paper,
"El Cronista," was established after
the junta had been in power for some
time. If Heine were to be candid it
would destroy his whole point: that
Chilean papers are puppets of the
junta. I have destroyed this myth for
him.
Attitude
I don't think Americans really un
derstand what attitude the Chileans
take towards the junta. My father re
cently wrote me a long letter in which
he summed up some of the common
feelings in Chile right now. From his
perspective in Chile, "I am mentally
and emotionally exhausted with the
Washington-Santiago political
vomit. The USA and Cuba together
voted against Chile in the U.N. on
the Human Rights issue. I just can't
help but feel that our government
has lost its moral reserve; or has its
eyes shut, or its head up its ass, or
something."
As I was leaving Chile, every one of
my classmates and friends (from all
economic and social classes â€” uni
versity education was then free),
came up to me and asked me to tell
the truth about how it is in Chile;
how they sighed with relief when the
junta took control of their be
leaguered country; how they have
faith that Chile will one day rise again
to its feet after the nightmare of Al
lende and his socialist failure. I hope
I have not let them down.
