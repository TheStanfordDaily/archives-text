When Jane Stanford founded Stanford Memo
rial Church in memory of her husband, she "de
finitely intended it to be the center of the Uni
versity," said Ralph Hansen, University Ar
chivist.
As the church prepares to celebrate its 75th
anniversary tomorrow, some of its friends have
taken a look at its role in the Stanford commun
ity.
Mrs. Stanford felt that "knowledge without
spiritual rootage is dangerous," said Robert
Hamerton-Kelly, Dean of the Chapel. "She was
interested in the moral use of knowledge."
Jane and Leland Stanford were regular
church-goers, but belonged to no particular de
nomination. Mrs. Stanford expressly requested
that the church be non-sectarian.
"In that day it was an important new step,"
said Rev. Robert Minto, chaplain of the Univer
sity from 1950 to 1966. "Nearly all the colleges at
the time had definite denominational ties. There
were acute rivalries — the denominations were
not as broad-minded and brotherly toward each
other as they are today.
"It is a church that wanted to promote coop
eration," Minto said.
When the University opened in 1891, chapel
services were held daily in Building 100 of the
Inner Quad, said Minto.
Mrs. Stanford carefully watched every step of
the church's construction which started in 1899.
She personally approved the designs for its
mosaics and stained-glass windows. Memorial
Church held its first services in January, 1903.
The original church had a high tower with
chimes and four clocks, each facing a point of
the compass. The congregation looked up from
inside the church at a huge "all-seeing eye" at
the tower's base.
The earthquake of 1906 badly damaged the
building. The spire with its chimes and all
seeing eye were destroyed and never replaced.
The mosaid facade has to be restored. The
church was rebuilt around a steel frame and
reopened in 1913.

Through the years since its opening in 1903,
the churrh has "provided a witness to the
spiritual dimension of life," said Hamerton-
Kelly.
"We try to provide people with a community
where they can experience friendship, support,
and in that context explore not only human rela
tionships but also the deeper areas of ethics,
religion, and ultimately the relationship with
Cod," he said.
Hamerton-Kelly teaches, leads discussion
groups, counsels .and lectures. Rev. Ernie W.D.
Young, associate dean, works at the Stanford
Hospital, visiting patients and leading seminars
on medical ethics. Rev. Wendy Smith, asst.
dean, also has counseling duties.
A crucial aspect of the church's ministry is its
involvement with the outside community. The
tradition began with Rev. David Gardner, who
served as chaplain from 1902 to 1936. Gardner
started the Stanford Convalescent Home (now
the Children's Hospital) as a way to relate stu
dents to the community in the form of social
service, said Minto.
Hamerton-Kelly became dean in 1973, "just
when the war ended. There was a period of
cooling off and resting for a year or two when
people were just not interested. Now it's gone
back to a sort of balanced involvement in social
issues, personal issues and spiritual issues,"
said Hamerton-Kelly.
A chapel Board of about 30 students has or
ganized ongoing service projects in East Palo
Alto and fundraising for charities, and adminis
ters a scholarship program for students who
want to do religious and humanitarian work dur
ing the summer.
Memorial Church "means a lot to people who
come here for weddings, funerals and bap
tisms," said Minto, who has married several
generations of student families there.
"Mrs. Stanford deserves credit for building
such a huge church which js still relevant to the
demands of 1978," said Minto. "It was quite a
vision, and a big architectural accomplish
ment."

When Jane Stanford founded Stanford Memo
rial Church in memory of her husband, she "de
finitely intended it to be the center of the Uni
versity," said Ralph Hansen, University Ar
chivist.
As the church prepares to celebrate its 75th
anniversary tomorrow, some of its friends have
taken a look at its role in the Stanford commun
ity.
Mrs. Stanford felt that "knowledge without
spiritual rootage is dangerous," said Robert
Hamerton-Kelly, Dean of the Chapel. "She was
interested in the moral use of knowledge."
Jane and Leland Stanford were regular
church-goers, but belonged to no particular de
nomination. Mrs. Stanford expressly requested
that the church be non-sectarian.
"In that day it was an important new step,"
said Rev. Robert Minto, chaplain of the Univer
sity from 1950 to 1966. "Nearly all the colleges at
the time had definite denominational ties. There
were acute rivalries — the denominations were
not as broad-minded and brotherly toward each
other as they are today.
"It is a church that wanted to promote coop
eration," Minto said.
When the University opened in 1891, chapel
services were held daily in Building 100 of the
Inner Quad, said Minto.
Mrs. Stanford carefully watched every step of
the church's construction which started in 1899.
She personally approved the designs for its
mosaics and stained-glass windows. Memorial
Church held its first services in January, 1903.
The original church had a high tower with
chimes and four clocks, each facing a point of
the compass. The congregation looked up from
inside the church at a huge "all-seeing eye" at
the tower's base.
The earthquake of 1906 badly damaged the
building. The spire with its chimes and all
seeing eye were destroyed and never replaced.
The mosaid facade has to be restored. The
church was rebuilt around a steel frame and
reopened in 1913.

Through the years since its opening in 1903,
the churrh has "provided a witness to the
spiritual dimension of life," said Hamerton-
Kelly.
"We try to provide people with a community
where they can experience friendship, support,
and in that context explore not only human rela
tionships but also the deeper areas of ethics,
religion, and ultimately the relationship with
Cod," he said.
Hamerton-Kelly teaches, leads discussion
groups, counsels .and lectures. Rev. Ernie W.D.
Young, associate dean, works at the Stanford
Hospital, visiting patients and leading seminars
on medical ethics. Rev. Wendy Smith, asst.
dean, also has counseling duties.
A crucial aspect of the church's ministry is its
involvement with the outside community. The
tradition began with Rev. David Gardner, who
served as chaplain from 1902 to 1936. Gardner
started the Stanford Convalescent Home (now
the Children's Hospital) as a way to relate stu
dents to the community in the form of social
service, said Minto.
Hamerton-Kelly became dean in 1973, "just
when the war ended. There was a period of
cooling off and resting for a year or two when
people were just not interested. Now it's gone
back to a sort of balanced involvement in social
issues, personal issues and spiritual issues,"
said Hamerton-Kelly.
A chapel Board of about 30 students has or
ganized ongoing service projects in East Palo
Alto and fundraising for charities, and adminis
ters a scholarship program for students who
want to do religious and humanitarian work dur
ing the summer.
Memorial Church "means a lot to people who
come here for weddings, funerals and bap
tisms," said Minto, who has married several
generations of student families there.
"Mrs. Stanford deserves credit for building
such a huge church which js still relevant to the
demands of 1978," said Minto. "It was quite a
vision, and a big architectural accomplish
ment."
