# May I have this dance?

When was the last time you
got the chance to polish your
glass slippers and tune up that
old rusty pumpkin carriage? A
Stanford committee of Prince
Charmings and Cinderellas is
making it easier by bringing
their fairy tale to Stanford. Glit
tering candlelight, flowing
gowns and a ballroom full of
wining and waltzing romantics
will set an elegant scene for the
Farm's first Viennese Ball.
On Friday night, Toyon Hall
will be enchanted in Viennese
style, complete with orches
tras, exhibition dancing and
honored dignitaries. The only
difference between the Stan
ford fantasy and that of Cin
derella is that our Fairy God
mother has agreed to extend
the "magic hour" past mid
night to the stroke of 3 a.m.
While Cinderella would have
been delighted with such a rad
ical proposition, however, the
waltzing Viennese of the real
world might only be half
satisfied.
"It's going to be a relatively
short ball," said Melanie Nap
per, one of the Stanford-in-
Vienna returnees who spent
the Fasching (carnival) season
of 1977 in Austria swirling until
dawn. "It's kind of romantic,
dancing ail night — a fairy tale
type of situation."
A Stanford replica of the
traditional Austrian fete was
dreamed up by the Vienna
group of winter quarter 1976-
77, after several Stanford stu
dents were able to dance
among the aristocrats of Vie
nna during Fasching season.
"It's an exhilarating experi
ence," said Jeff Ryan, chairman
of the ball committee. "It's
positively unreal."
The "unreal" task of organiz
ing a ball — and possibly a new
tradition — at Stanford has
been achieved through inspi
ration, research and a lot of
help from local groups which
include Stanford's Music De
partment and many of the local

merchants who have agreed to
donate food, drinks, decora
tions, tuxedos and talent.
Why all for a break
in the Stanford tradition of Fri
day night beer, and Jack's
runs?
"Because it's cultural, it's
something different," answers
Napper. "Waltzing is
beautiful. It's so smooth and
the dresses flow . . . and it's
fun!"
Strauss waltzes won't be the
only break in Stanford's
hustle-and-bump dancing trad
ition. Through the urging of
music student Debbie Rutter,
the Music Department agreed
to purchase $800 worth of
music and to furnish two alter
nating musical groups. The
Stanford Chamber Orchestra,
directed by Walter Ducloux
will open the ball. The Stanford
)azz Ensemble and the Stan
ford Festival Orchestra will
provide dance music.
In addition to floating along
to Strauss' score the "Die
Fledermaus" dancers will also
be doing the cha-cha, the fox
trot, the tango and perhaps a
few polkas.
Practice dancing sessions are
held at 7 p.m. Tuesday and
Thursday nights in Toyon Hall.
"Last week, dance lessons
went crazy," Ryan said. "We
had about 70 people Tuesday
night and then another 150 on
Thursday." These sessions are
open to all individuals who
plan to attend the ball.
"We had lessons like this in
Vienna," Napper said. "It was
great listening to the teacher
counting 'eins-zwei-drei!"
The ball will open at 8:30
p.m. with a gala ceremony
conducted by committee
members and there will be a
midnight show of exhibition
dancing by the Imogene
Woodruff Ballroom Dance
Studio. Throughout the even
ing, donated beverages and
hors d'oeuvres will be served
to refresh and re-energize
dancing guests.

Invitations to the ball have
been sent to Austrian and
other international officials
throughout the Bay Area, in
cluding the honorary Austrian
Consul and Swiss Consul.
Other dignitaries on the invi
tation list include Overseas
Studies Director Mark Man
call; Bechtel International
Center Chairman Lee Ziegler,
and Austrian campus faculty
members such as Kurt Steiner
of political science, Fritz Fell
ner, visiting professor of his
tory, Anthony Sokol, professor
emeritus of political science
and Woltram Fischer, visiting
professor of history from Ger
many.
Response to the ball has
been good, said Ryan. All of
the 350 tickets priced at $4
apiece have been sold. No tic
kets will be sold at the door.
