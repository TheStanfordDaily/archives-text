# New Directions
## Group looks at foreign policy 
### Hardy Iredale 
"New Directions," a na
tional citizen's organiza
tion, is working to influence
the role of the United States
in solving world problems.
It aims to lobby for "world
security through political,
economic, social and en
vironmental justice" and
Stanford boasts the first
chapter to be started on a
university campus.
It sounds like an ambiti
ous goal. However its im
mediate aims are more li
mited. According to Mike
Barzelay, a member of the
Stanford New Directions
steering-committee, it is
currently undertaking a
campaign to inform and
educate a large section of
the public about important
foreign policy issues.
"A major problem in the
past has been that people
are generally ignorant about
our foreign policy," Bar
zelay said.
"For that reason there has
been very little public pres
sure in Congress and most
of the influence on foreign
policy has been exerted by
corporate lobbyists with
special interests," he said.'
Coalition
The national New Direc
tions organization was
formed in Octoberl976, out
of a broad coalition of per
sons from various political
leanings.
Its first members in
cluded Paul Warnke, direc
tor of the U.S. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency;
Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance and anthropologist
Margaret Mead. Sam
Brown, who headed the
Vietnam Moratorium
movement in the late '60s
was also among its mem
bers, as was Anthony Lake,
who was on former Secret

ary of State Henry Kissing
er's National Security
Council before resigning in
1970 to protest the invasion
of Cambodia.
The national New Direc
tions organization has taken
a general position on a vari
ety of issues. It proposes a
speed-up in the SALT
negotiations and voluntary
moves by the U.S. to slow
down arms research and
development.
The national organization
is working on similar prop
osals for energy policy,
American policy toward
third-world countries as
well as plans to alleviate
U.S. poverty and support
human rights. All these
proposals are based on de
tailed research, said Bar
zelay.
Liberals' list
New Directions proposals
cover such a wide range
they are inclined to make
the organization look
somewhat unrealistic. To
anyone with a liberal bent
they read like a list of the
'right views' on every topic
of international impor
tance.

But the organization tries
to be more than just the
voice of educated
liberalism. As a national
political voice, it stands out
as advocating views which
are impartial toany business
interest or pre-conceived

political bias.
In addition, its proposals
try to take all sides of an
issue into account. Pete
Stamos, a member of Stan
ford New Directions, said
the proposals on arms con
trol, for example, also re
commend "moves to aid
workers whose jobs might
be affected.
In essence, New Direc
tions advocates a new ap
proach to American foreign
policy formulation. Tradi
tionally, American foreign
policy has been based on
what are considered the
"American" interests. New
Directions proposes that
our foreign policy should
try and serve broader and
more long-term interests;
those of all mankind.
"This is necessitated by
the increasing inter
dependency of our world,"

said Larry Diamond, one of
the initial members of Stan
ford New Directions. "The
best interests of the world
are really in our own long
term best interests," he
said.
As an example he pointed
to the affect of Japanese
steel imports on American
jobs. "What was once an ex
tremely esoteric issue has
become very important be
cause it causes American
unemployment," he said.
The chief aim of the Stan
ford chapter is to make
foreign policy information
easily accessible to people
with limited time or in
terest, Barzelay said.
"Our newsletter, which is
published three times a
quarter, tries to present in a
short and concise way the
underlying ideas which are
necessary to understand the
issues," he said.
New Directions is also or
ganizing a series of sym
posiums to give an in-depth
look at current issues. Last
night's symposium con
cerned Euro-Communism.
"Even for people who are
well informed it is hard to
make sense of the swing,
the complications and the
subtleties of most of these
issues," Diamond said.
New Directions also
holds noon bag lunches
each Thursday at the
Graham Stewart Lounge in
the political science build
ing. Guest speakers are in
vited to give presentations
on selected topics.
The Stanford organiza
tion will try to branch out to
other universities in the
near future, Stamos said.
"We are trying to set an
example of how a university
organization of this kind can
work," he said.
