# Another new cut for McCoy Tyner
## 
### 
McCoy Tyner's past several albums
have featured him in a variety of con
texts. He has recorded a live album, a
solo album, with a string orchestra,
one with his present group, and one
with three all-star trios. His latest album
from Milestone, "Innervoices," fea
tures Tyner, supported by several name
musicians and a small choir. It is
perhaps the most unusual album of
Tyner's long career.
The few attempts in the past at com
bining a top jazz artist with vocal sup
port have been largely unsuccessful.
The vocal album, which Charlie Parker
recorded late in his life, started a tradi
tion which can be seen as recently as
last year with Horace Silver's "Silver 'n
Voices" album. The general problem
with vocal-jazz collaborations in the
past has been the often cloying, un
abashed sentimentality of the choral

background. Even the biting melodic
lines of a Charlie Parker sound like
Musak when supported by a sickly
sweet choral score.
More than sickly-sweet
McCoy Tyner's album avoids this pit
fall, and in doing so presents some ex
citing and engaging music. The vocal
parts are wordless; for the most part
the choir sustains rich harmonies in the
background. The depth of the chords
they sing make it impractical for them
to back up an instrumentalist — more
often one or more of the higher voices
will contrast a simple chordal melody
with the support of the other voices.
What this means, in effect, is that the
playing alternates between the musi
cians and the singers — the interplay
between the two groups is limited.
One of the most surprising aspects of
the album is the appearance of guitarist

Earl Klugh. Klugh, who is known as a
jazz-rock musician, plays straight
ahead jazz on this album and does an
excellent job. His duet with Tyner on
the opening to "Festival in Bahia" is
perhaps the highlight of the album.
Here, Klugh plays long, flowing
melodic lines over the slow harmonic
pulse created by Tyner.
Style of logical conclusions
It has become clear in the past two
years that Tyner's style has reached its,
logical conclusion; it is highly unlikely
thai Tyner's playing will undergo any
more drastic changes. The rich har
monies and vibrating tremolos give
Tyner's music the power and scope of
the natural elements. It is not unusual
that so many of Tyner's album covers
should depict large mountain ranges or
ocean waves. The similarity between

his music and the rhythmic flow of the
ocean is cryptically difficult to explain,
yet undoubtedly present. He is, it must
be admitted, the most distinct stylist
today in jazz.
Tyner will be bringing his superb sex
tet to the Keystone Korner this month
and it will be interesting to see whether
he performs any of the music on "In
nervoices" without the choral
background. The compositions are ex
cellent and could easily stand on their
own without voices.
Tyner has recorded only one album
with his present group, although it has
been together nearly three years.
Hopefully, his next album will feature
Tyner and his group — it is ironic that
one of the best small groups in jazz (in
my opinion the best) should be so ig
nored.

that so many of Tyner's album covers
should depict large mountain ranges or
ocean waves. The similarity between

his music and the rhythmic flow of the
ocean is cryptically difficult to explain,
yet undoubtedly present. He is, it must
be admitted, the most distinct stylist
today in jazz.
Tyner will be bringing his superb sex
tet to the Keystone Korner this month
and it will be interesting to see whether
he performs any of the music on "In
nervoices" without the choral
background. The compositions are ex
cellent and could easily stand on their
own without voices.
Tyner has recorded only one album
with his present group, although it has
been together nearly three years.
Hopefully, his next album will feature
Tyner and his group — it is ironic that
one of the best small groups in jazz (in
my opinion the best) should be so ig
nored.

McCoy Tyner's past several albums
have featured him in a variety of con
texts. He has recorded a live album, a
solo album, with a string orchestra,
one with his present group, and one
with three all-star trios. His latest album
from Milestone, "Innervoices," fea
tures Tyner, supported by several name
musicians and a small choir. It is
perhaps the most unusual album of
Tyner's long career.
The few attempts in the past at com
bining a top jazz artist with vocal sup
port have been largely unsuccessful.
The vocal album, which Charlie Parker
recorded late in his life, started a tradi
tion which can be seen as recently as
last year with Horace Silver's "Silver 'n
Voices" album. The general problem
with vocal-jazz collaborations in the
past has been the often cloying, un
abashed sentimentality of the choral

background. Even the biting melodic
lines of a Charlie Parker sound like
Musak when supported by a sickly
sweet choral score.
More than sickly-sweet
McCoy Tyner's album avoids this pit
fall, and in doing so presents some ex
citing and engaging music. The vocal
parts are wordless; for the most part
the choir sustains rich harmonies in the
background. The depth of the chords
they sing make it impractical for them
to back up an instrumentalist — more
often one or more of the higher voices
will contrast a simple chordal melody
with the support of the other voices.
What this means, in effect, is that the
playing alternates between the musi
cians and the singers — the interplay
between the two groups is limited.
One of the most surprising aspects of
the album is the appearance of guitarist

Earl Klugh. Klugh, who is known as a
jazz-rock musician, plays straight
ahead jazz on this album and does an
excellent job. His duet with Tyner on
the opening to "Festival in Bahia" is
perhaps the highlight of the album.
Here, Klugh plays long, flowing
melodic lines over the slow harmonic
pulse created by Tyner.
Style of logical conclusions
It has become clear in the past two
years that Tyner's style has reached its,
logical conclusion; it is highly unlikely
thai Tyner's playing will undergo any
more drastic changes. The rich har
monies and vibrating tremolos give
Tyner's music the power and scope of
the natural elements. It is not unusual
that so many of Tyner's album covers
should depict large mountain ranges or
ocean waves. The similarity between

his music and the rhythmic flow of the
