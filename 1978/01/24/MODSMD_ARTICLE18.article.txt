# World's Greatest Lover'
## Trying too hard to make 'em laugh 
### 
Gene Wilder is afraid of
smiles.
"I don't want viewers to
smile," he has said, "I want
them to laugh. I'm afraid of
smiles, unless it's very broad
smiles."
This insistence on laughs
over mere smiles motivates the
frantic comedy of "The
World's Greatest Lover," Wil
der's latest film, which he
wrote, directed and in which
he's starring. It's a funny
movie, but not as funny as Wil
der tries so hard to make it.
That's his problem: ne tries too
hard.
Given a choice between a
possible guffaw and a sure-fire
smile, Wilder will go for the
guffaw every time.
For instance, early in
"Lover" Wilder performs what
is, in his mind, a version of the
classic routine in which an as
sembly line bakery worker gets
caught on a moving conveyor
belt. It is the sort of slapstick in
which physical comedians
from Chaplin to Lucille Ball
have reveled. Except with Wil
der, this scene fast and furious
turns into frantic and ridicul
ous.
The trouble is that not every

single invention that Wilder
can think up is hilariously
funny. According to some, this
is where he fails to measure up
to his mentor, Mel Brooks, in
whose films Wilder got his
start. I don't agree, because I
think Brooks suffers from the
same smile-phobia and falls on
his face just as often.
It is hard to say why a particu
lar comedy routine does not
work. In the case of the bakery
conveyor belt, all the classic
elements are present. Wilder,
playing the hopelessly neuro
tic Rudy Valentine, pushes the
wrong levers while daydream
ing and somehow ends up on
the moving belt along with the
cakes, being pelted with pastel
icings and sugar glitter.
Even though the film speed
is accelerated, the gag goes on
forever. Wilder finally passes
through a big machine, emerg
ing with a box around his head
tied with a red ribbon, ready
for delivery. Another worker, a
fat lady, screams at the sight.

(Wilder thinks fat ladies are ter
ribly funny and has them
around as much as possible.)
Wilder is fired by his fore
man, but somehow manages to
leave his mark by pulling
another lever which dumps an
avalanche of flour on the man's
head.
All of this should be unbear
ably funny. It is moderately
amusing. What's unbearable is
how hard Wilder is working to
make us roll in the aisles. The
essence of comedy is surprise,
and humans are perverse crea
tures. If you telegraph the
message, "Watch this, I'm
gonna make you scream with
laughter!" you're in trouble
before you begin.
Once this disappointing as
sembly line scene is over,
however, Wilder recoups with
a strange, touching and often
funny story about the need for
success, the search for fame
and the promise that Hol
lywood stardom provides both
these things. The now un
employed baker heads for Hol

lywood with his mousy but en
dearing wife Annie, beautifully
played by Carol Kane. It is 1926
and the search is on for a sc
reen lover to rival Rudolph
Valentino. Wilder, who sticks
his tongue out compulsively
whenever he's nervous,
somehow wins the contest
after improbable and funny
adventures, but gives up his
chance at movie fame to win
back Annie's affections.
Dom DeLuise, who plays
Adolph Zitz, the movie mogul
sponsoring the search for the
world's greatest lover, does a
brilliant job in what has to be a
difficult role — that of an amus
ing psychotic. Calm and
businesslike one moment, to
tally crazy the next, DeLuise
manages to make schizop
hrenia a laughing matter.
He is aided by one of the
many fine supporting actors in
the'Tilm, Michael Huddleston,
who plays Zitz' barber, the only
person honest and stupid
enough to disagree with Zitz'
pronouncements. Every time
the barber confounds the
yes-men by telling the boss the
truth, Zitz goes crazy and beats
the poor fellow up.

This is basic Three Stooges
stuff, but in DeLuise's hands, it
continues to be funny. And,
since Wilder is also the direc
tor, we must say that he too is
successful here, unlike the
bakery scene. Why the differ
ence? I doubt that the greatest
living comedian, whoever that
is, could explain why.
There are some nice touches
that stick in the memory. For
instance, at one point Rudy
impersonates the great Valen
tino to win back his wife, who
has taken it into her empty
head that the Sheik is in love
with her. Wearing the famous
lover's black veil, Rudy
lounges on a pile of cushions
and nonchalantly tosses grapes
into his mouth. Without re
moving the veil.
It sounds — and looks —
somewhat gross, but the ab
surdity of the gesture takes us
by surprise and makes us laugh
in spite of ourselves. It is such
moments that m._ke "The
World's Greatest Lover" a very
entertaining film, in spite of its
creator's efforts to make it the
funniest movie you've ever
seen.
