# Great playing, conducting but not always at same time
## 
### 
There was some great play
ing last week at the symphony,
and some great conducting;
unfortunately, these two never
coincided enough to convince
me that what I was seeing
was the definitive performance
of either piece on the program.
The evening began with
Brahms' Third Symphony; (ac
tually, the evening began with
Irish Coffee downstaris, but
that's another story . . .) This is
an old (1883) standard of the
symphonic repertoire that
many of the players could have
probably performed from
memory, and its melodies are
so well known that the audi
ence knew most of it before
the show began.
Perhaps it was the recogni
tion of this familiarity of the lis
tener and performer alike that
caused Seiji Ozawa to give a
Brahms that was so trans
formed that it was no longer
familiar. Such a transformation
was brought about through a
sort of musical "free associa
tion" process on the part of
Ozawa, in which lyrical
melodies of the second and
third movements were
schmalzed in something that
even Tchaikovsky would have
grimaced at.
Playing down the original
It seemed as if Ozawa played
down the original nature of the
piece, such as the heroic qual
ity of the opening movement,
in order to show us the associa
tive implications of where else
the music could fit.
In this way, the organ-like
qualities of the woodwind writ
ing took on a Mahlerian prom
inence that didn't quite be
long.
And yet the performers
played beautifully, delivering
every bit of schmaltz that
Ozawa was demanding of
them. Notable among the or
chestra was the string section,
which was tighter than it has
been in a long while, and nota
ble among the strings were the
'celli, who once again proved
the most consistent group in
the orchestra.
The only dark spot of the
performance was the playing
of the first clarinetist, who
sounded as if he were swallow
ing razor-blades in the middle
of his solos.
The second half of the con
cert was the series' premiere of
Roger Sessions' setting of Walt
Whitman's poem, "When

Lilacs Last in Dooryard
Bloom'd." It featured soprano
Esther Hinds, mezzo-soprano
|an de Caetani and baritone
Douglas Lawrence, backed up
by the glorious San Francisco
Chorus.
Roger Sessions is one of the
old men of American music.
He has been an important
theorist, teacher of compos
ers, and a quality composer in
his own right, being one of the
most prolific and most hon
ored American musicians. He
has taught all across the United
States, including UC-Berkeley,
which commissioned "Lilacs"
for its centennial in 1968.
Choral masterpiece
"Lilacs" is touted around the
world as America's foremost
choral masterpiece, and I
agree with such a distinction.
However, many reviewers and
critics point to its subtler as
pects, such as its organization,
and use of motives as being the
basis of its masterpiece status,
and this I agree with.
Such intricacies are not the
factors that move the audi
ence; they are merely the craft.
What moves the audience is
the raw power of the orchestral
writing and the monolithic
quality of Sessions' conception
of bleakness and suffering.
This is why the choral sec
tions prove so important:
when sheer power is what is
needed there is nothing so
convincing as a-hundred-and
some singers shouting in your
direction. Realizing this Ses
sions chose to make the solo
parts more florid, while keep
ing the choral part straightfor
ward and declamatory.
In last week's performance,
the San Francisco Chorus was
in every respect the best en
semble on stage, showing itself
to be equal to any demand Ses
sions could have made; in fact,
the diction of the chorus
members was more easily un
derstood than that of the sol
oists singing by themselves,
who had several problems.
Esther Hinds was very good,
but maybe too operatic. Jan de
Caetani, famous for excellent
work in chamber music situa
tions, had a beautiful voice but
just couldn't fill the hall with it.
Douglas Lawrence was great.
Violins off
The worst thing about the
performance was the violin
section; their part was very dif
ficult, with jagged skips and

leaps throughout most of the
piece, but instead of looking at
it as a welcome challenge they
saw it as a useless bother, and
showed us their feelings by
slouching back in their chairs,
thus inspiring some audience
members to do likewise. Then
they hit a lot of wrong notes,
also ....
Ozawa was really fantastic
on this piece, and if you ever
want to hear him and it without
ghastly violins may I suggest
then the record, recently re
leased on New World Record
ings, with the Boston Sym
phony Orchestra, and soloists
Esther Hinds, Florence Quivar
and Dominic Cossa.
This is a powerful recording
of a powerful performance of
what is truly a powerful piece.
