The Medical Center has expanded its cancer and fam
ily medicine departments, officials announced recently.
The Debbie Probst Oncology Day Care Center, a new
treatment center for cancer patients, was formally dedi
cated Saturday, though it had been receiving patients
since last fall.
The new center more than doubled the hospital's
cancer clinic facilities. Included equipment, the oncol
ogy unit cost approximately $300,000 and was funded by
various individuals and organizations, including the Na
tional Cancer Institute.
Containing 5000 square feet of space, the center is
equipped with two special injection rooms, two long
term holding rooms, seven examination rooms and a
pharmacy.
The unit also houses a hematology laboratory, a social
worker's station and patient records rooms.
Thirteen patients can be treated simultaneously in the
enlarged center and more than 14,000 patients are ex
pected to use the unit.
"Our concern is not only for the patient's survival, but
also the quality of survival," said center Director Dr. Saul
Rosenberg.
Dr. Charlotte )acobs will be working as chief of the
oncology center.
While the hospital increased cancer facilities, the
Medical School concentrated its efforts on family

medicine instruction, and now a new division of family
medicine has been established in the Department of
Family, Community and Preventive Medicine.
"The creation of a division of family medicine at Stan
ford is the culmination of efforts over the past 10 years,"
said Dr. Count Gibson, department chairman.
He added that all other California medical schools
have committed themselves to teaching family
medicine.
Dr. Lee Blanchard, clinical associate professor at the
Medical School, emphasized the difference between a
general practicioner and a family physician.
"The old GP was concerned about taking care of all
disease processes. Family practice, on the other hand,
emphasizes the person rather than the disease pro
cess," he said.
He added that the family physician is expected to
provide "continuous, comprehensive care for every
member of the family, from infant to the aged."
The department recently received a $106,000 renewal
grant from the U.S. Department of Health, Education
and Welfare to support a preceptorship program, in
which medical students can work with family physicians
in various communities.
The division of family medicine will be directed by Dr.
William Fowkes, associate professor of clinical family
medicine and clinical medicine.
