# Carol (Dolly) Channing's back
## 
### 
After 11 years, Carol Chan
ning is back where she be
longs. She is once again play
ing the title role in "Hello,
Dolly!"
Though moviegoers may as
sociate Barbra Streisand with
the role of Dolly Levi, theater
buffs are quick to remember
that Channing was the original
Dolly in the 1963 production,
which ran 1273 times. And, in
1978, Channing is "still glo
win', still goin' strong."
Channing's greatest asset is
her magnificent stage pre
sence. From the moment she
steps onstage, the audience is
aware of every move. She has a
natural sense of timing and can
get a laugh by just blinking her
wide china doll eyes. Though
Channing's vocal ability is pos
sibly below expectation, her
style is comic and quite accept
able for musical comedy. What
she lacks in tone she makes up
for in energy.
Like his leading lady, Eddie
Bracken's (Horace Vandergel
der) talent lies mostly in his
sense of timing and flair for the
comic. He brings a special sort
of dignity to his role; he is
forceful and irrascible, yet un
deniably lovable. Skillfully, he
avoids being overshadowed by
Channing — no easy trick, in
deed.
The supporting cast is an ex
ceptional group of vocalists.
Florence Lacy, a mature yet
pleasing Irene Molloy, is a re

cording artist as well as an ac
tress. Exceedingly talented is
Lee Roy Reams (Cornelius)
who is no newcomer to the
musical stage. Even Alexandra
Kory (Minnie Fay), whose in
cessant giggling proved most
annoying, can really belt out a
tune.
The most disappointing as
pect of the show is its choreog
raphy. Though extremely col
orful, the dance numbers lack
vitality. "Put on Your Sunday
Clothes," usually the first-act
showstopper, is nothing more
than a parade of costumes. The
opening number, "I Put My
Hand In," lacks continuity and
precision: perhaps the
choreographer did not wish to
upstage the leading lady.
For those unfamiliar with the
show, "Hello Dolly!" is based
on Thorton Wilder's engaging
play, "The Matchmaker."
"Dolly" is the story of the
scheming, mischievous
matchmaker, Dolly Levi, who is
commissioned by Horace Van
dergelder, the "well known,
unmarried half-a-millionaire"
to find a suitable bride. After
matching up Vandergelder's
niece, his clerks and anyone
else who happens to cross her
path, Dolly manages to find
Horace the perfect wife — her
self, of course.
Like most musical comedies,
the show makes no attempt to
reflect reality, is contrived and

based on coincidence. Direc
tor Lucia Victor rightfully con
cerns herself with conveying
an impression of the mood and
tempo of old New York, rather
than depicting a slice of life.
The backdrops are purpose
fully one-dimensional, the sets
polished and pretty, the acting
deliberately stylized. The sole
purpose of the production is to
entertain, and it entertains de
lightfully.
When Channing takes her
final bow, the audience jumps
to its feet, whistling and cheer
ing. Streisand can sing, but
Channing can charm.
