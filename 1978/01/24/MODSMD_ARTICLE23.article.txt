# Margaret Fabrizio and J.S. Bach
## 
### 
Harpsichord artist Margaret
Fabrizio will celebrate the
tenth anniversary of her first
performance of J.S. Bach's
masterwork, "The Art of
Fugue," with a performance
of the work in its entirety at 8
p.m. tonight, in Annenberg
Auditorium.
Nonreserved admission
for the concert, which is pre
sented by the Department of
Music is $2 general, $1 for
students.
Fabrizio's original perfor
mance, to a sold-out hall at
the Palance of the Legion of
Honor in San Francisco,
marked the first occasion an
American harpsichordist had

performed the work on that
instrument.
"The Art of Fugue" —
series of fugues and canons
all on the same theme — is
Bach's last work. Left un
finished at his death, it rep
resents the culmination of
his prodigious inventiveness
and mastery of the art of
counterpoint.
No specific instrument is
indicated by Bach, and the
work is often performed by
instrumental ensemble. But
it was apparently intended
for keyboard — most likely
harpsichord or possibly or
gan.
