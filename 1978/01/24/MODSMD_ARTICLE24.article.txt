Carter sends budget to Congress
Washington — President jimmy Carter sent Congress a
1979 budget yesterday calling for $25 billion in tax cuts,
higher spending on defense, energy and education, but
no big outlays for wholly new programs.
Even so, the magnitude of the proposed spending,
$500.2 billion, brought critical comment from some key
members of Congress.
Rep. George Mahon (D-Tex.) applauded Carter's an
nounced intention of working with the private sector of
the economy to reduce unemployment. But he said ac
companying proposals for spending and large tax cuts to
stimulate the economy involve considerable risks and
"the greatest risk appears to be inflation."
T he budget estimates $4 J9.6 billion in receipts against
the outlays. This would leave the government operating
in the red by $60.6 billion, only a little less than the
estimated $61.8 billion deficit for the present year.
Carter reiterated his commitment to a balanced
budget but acknowledged that the target date of 1981,
which he set during his presidential campaign, might be
missed if the economy needed more tax-cut tonic during
the intervening years.
European industrialist kidnapped
Paris — Masked gunmen ambushed an automobile
carrying Baron Fdouard-jean Empain yesterday and ab
ducted the Belgian nobleman, who is one of Europe's
richest industrialists and heads a giant conglomerate
with interests in the United States.
Hours after the late-morning abduction in central
Paris, the 40-year-old baron's family still had not re
ceived a ransom demand, authorities said.
Empain's automobile was found in a parking lot in
north-west Paris. There was no firm clue to whether he
was kidnapped for money or for political motives.
Empain is president and managing director of the
French-Belgian Empain-Schneider industrial group of
150 companies that has an annual turnover of $4.5 bill
ion.
Egypt reneged on plan says Israel
Jerusalem — Israel charged yesterday that Egypt re
neged on a Sinai demilitarization pledge, but Prime
Minister Menahem Begin said his country could decide
next week to resume peace negotiations if Cairo softens
what he called its strident anti-Semitic tone.
Egyptian foreign Minister Mohammed Kamel told
newsmen in Cairo it was not possible for Egypt to be
anti-Semitic when "Egyptians are themselves Semites.
Egyptians have nothing in their hearts against lews and
this is a fact."
Speaking after a six-hour debate on his policies in
Parliament, Begin said, "I hope that next week we can

decide to renew the talks," referring to military negotia
tions in Cairo on a troop pull-back in the Sinai Peninsula.
Israel withdrew from those negotiations when Egypt
broke off political talks in Jerusalem. Cairo accused the
Begin government of sabotaging those negotiations.
Rich diet may be related to disease
Washington — A Senate panel that incited an argument
with the American Medical Association and major food
industry groups is sticking to its advice that consumers
can lessen their chances of getting killer diseases by
changing their diets.
The Committee on Nutrition released yesterday the
second edition of its staff study, "Dietary Goals for the
United States," after making only minor changes from
the earlier report issued a year ago.
The new version again recommends that Americans
decrease consumption of processed sugars, eggs and
salt. It suggests substituting skim milk for whole milk
and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables and
whole grains.
The most important change came in a recommenda
tion to decrease consumption of meat, a proposal that
brought heavy criticism from cattle producers. The new
edition changed this to "decrease consumption of ani
mal fat." This would allow for consumption of lean
meats, but not such foods as the thick, juicy steak.
The report said that cancer, heart disease, diabetes
and hypertension are associated with the rich American
diet.
An attack on the report came from the AMA, which
said there is no proof that diet is related to disease. It
also said that changing American eating habits might
lead to economic dislocation.
'Wilmington 10' sentences reduced
Raleigh, N.C. — Gov. James Hunt reduced the sen
tences of nine imprisoned members of the Wilmington
10 yesterday, making all but one of them eligible for
parole this year, but denied petitions seeking a full par
don for members of the group.
The sentence of the Rev. Ben Chavis, leader of the
group, was reduced to permit parole eligibility on jan. 1,
1980 — two years earlier than before the governor's
action.
Chavis and eight other black men were convicted of
firebombing Mike's Grocery, a white-owned store in a
black neighborhood of Wilmington, N.C., during racial
violence in that port city in February 1971.
