From the Associated Press
Stanford alumnus and defending
champion Tom Watson made it two
years in a row yesterday when he
holed a four-foot putt on the second
hole of a sudden death playoff to de
feat Ben Crenshaw in the Bing
Crosby National Pro-Am Golf Tour
nament.
Watson, who became the first man
to make a successful defense of a
tour title since johnny Miller won his
second Bob Hope Desert Classic in
1976, collected $45,000. Earlier this
year, Watson captured the Tucson
Open and has earned $87,600 already
this season.
Watson had a chance to win on the
tournament's 72nd hole, but his 12-
foot putt lipped the hole before rol
ling away. Watson shot a 30 on the
front nine and had enjoyed a three
stroke lead earlier in the afternoon.
Crenshaw and Watson both parred
the first hole of the sudden death
playoff â€” the 16th. On the 218-yard
17th, Watson drove to the green and
sank his second putt while Crenshaw
had to pitch out of a trap and then

missed a 10-foot putt. It was the first
bogey of the day for Crenshaw.
"I thought I'd made the birdie putt
on 18," said Watson, "but the gods
weren't with me. Golf is like that.
Thankfully, they were with me on the
17th."
