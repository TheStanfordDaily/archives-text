# New panel reviewing retirement policy
## 
### Barbie Fields 
A University panel has been
formed to look into the effects of a
new state law prohibiting mandatory
retirement at age 65.
Assembly Bill 586 was passed after
much debate last fall in an attempt to
abolish age discrimination. Passage
of the bill was opposed by President
Richard Lyman, who sent Gov. Jerry
Brown a telegram last September
urging the governor to veto the bill.
Brown signed the bill into law the
next day despite the protest.

"The Administration Panel on Re
tirement will advise on when and
how Stanford policies should be
changed in response to California's
mandatory retirement legislation
and any relevant federal legislation,"
Lyman noted.
Provost William Miller will serve as
chairman on the panel.
According to a staff opinion issued
by the Fair Employment Practices
Commission ( F EPC), private
employers can be exempted for up to
two years from complying with the

law.
Nancy Shaw, FEPC counsel, said
"the language of the law is carefully
vague. The commission will hold
hearings in February and vote March
2,1978 on when the law actually takes
effect."
Some, including the bill's author,
Assemblyman Richard Alatorre
(D-Los Angeles), interpret the law to
mean that employees who reach 65
after Jan. 1 are protected from man
datory retirement, though the
employer still has up to two years to
change retirement plans.
The FEPC staff, however, agreed
with the opposing opinion which
calls for existing plans to remain in
effect until jan. 1, 1980 at the latest.
Shaw said that if or when the fed
eral legislation comes through on the
matter, "it will probably cut down on
the two year grace period anyway."
The panel will be dealing with
problems like hiring, compensation,
performance assessment, benefits,
retirement and part-time work
policies.
Robert Parker, a member of the
panel and University personnel di
rector, said "there are so many issues
involved here. The effects of what
ever is decided will definitely be far
reaching. A lot of clarifications are
needed.
"One significant aspect will be
how the rigor of performance evalua
tions will be affected.
"Our first tv/o panel meetings have
been exploratory in nature. We hope
we can reach some conclusions or
have some recommendations ready
within six months."
Rita Campbell, a senior feilow at
the Hoover Institution, said eliminat
ing mandatory retirement could
mark "the beginning of the end of

tenure." About 25 percent of the
Tenure, like union seniority,
"tends to reward time on the job, not
the quality of work. Younger persons
will fight for more merit increases
than ever before," she said.
A national survey conducted by
Profs. Everett Ladd and David Palmer
of the University of Connecticut and
Hoover Fellow Seymour M. Lipset
revealed that among faculty age 55 to
62, those of highest scholarly stand
ing and performance are the ones
who most want late retirement.
