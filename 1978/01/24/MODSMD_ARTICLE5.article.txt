# Social Security tax hike hits University

Stanford will be paying $288,00(1
more for Social Security this year as a
result of Social Security legislation
passed last month by Congress.
The new law calls for tax increases
over the next 10 years, although the
biggest tax increases have been
postponed by Congress until 1979.
The University's Social Security
costs will increase $638,000 in 1979,
$1.1 million the following year, and
$1.5 million in 1981, compared to
previous projections.
According to Frank Riddle, as
sociate controller, the new law will
add nearly $2.3 million annually to
University costs by the end of the
10-year period.
In relation to other costs, Riddle
said the added Social Security costs
amount to about one-tenth of one
percent of total University expendi
tures.
However, the new laws "are going

to create a cost pressure for the Uni
versity," said Riddle.
"When costs go up, we either have
to reduce costs somewhere else or
increase tuition," explained Riddle,
adding that this is "a mode we're in
continually."
According to Riddle, the Univer
sity was "much more concerned
about the Senate bill. It would have
been much more costly and much
more difficult to handle."
The Senate version of the bill cal
led for the employer to contribute
more toward Social Security than the
employee, while ihe House version
kept the contributions equal for
employers and employees.
Stanford was actively involved in
lobbying for the House bill in con
nection with several associations of
colleges based in Washington, and
sent telegrams to conference com
mittee members, said Larry Horton,
deputy director of government rela
tions.
Horton explained that the Univer
sity would be greatly affected if the
Senate bill had passed, adding that
the administration was "satisfied
when the conference did maintain
parity" between what employers and
employees contribute.
Horton said the Social Security
issue will probably be reopened and
if so, "we will watch it and take an
active interest if it will affect the Uni
versity."
The new law is intended to restore
financial stability to the Social Sec
urity system, which has been losing
revenue since 1975 because of high
unemployment and increases in be
nefits to keep up with inflation.
Last year the system ran a deficit of
