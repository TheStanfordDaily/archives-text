# Walsh confirms plans to remain at Stanford
## 
### 
Stanford head coach Bill Walsh
made official yesterday what the
Daily reported last Thursday — he
will remain at Stanford and has re
moved himself from consideration
for the head coaching position of the
Los Angeles Rams of the National
Football League.
"I appreciate the Rams' interest in
me," Walsh said. "The job is one of
the best in pro football because of
the quality of both the organization
and the team's personnel. (Owner)
Carroll Rosenbloom and (general
manager) Don Klosterman are two of
the finest people I've met in athle
tics."
Walsh conferred with the Rams'
executives last Tuesday in Los
Angeles.
"However, I want to set the record
straight and remove any uncertainty
about my future at this time," said

Walsh. "We are in the middle of re
cruiting, and the prospects we are
talking to want to know who Stan
ford's coach will be next year.
"I will not be leaving Stanford. We
are very happy at Stanford, and we're
looking forward to another good
season this fall," said Walsh.
In his first season as Stanford head
coach last year, Walsh directed the
Cards to a 9-3 mark — the best overall
record in the Pacific-8 — and a 24-14
Sun Bow! triumph over Louisiana
State University.
Walsh's three-year revolving con
tract with Stanford earns him approx
imately $50,000 a year. In December,
he signed the year's renewal.
The new Ram coach is expected to
receive a contract package worth
over $100,000 a year. Former Ram
coach Chuck Knox left Los Angeles
earlier this month to become head
coach of the Buffalo Bills.
