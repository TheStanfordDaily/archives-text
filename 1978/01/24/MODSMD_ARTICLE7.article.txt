Sayings of Sophocles, discourses of
Descartes and maxims of Marx may flow
from the lipsof all freshmen here within a
few years. Whether they like it or not.
The Western Culture task force prop
osal, soon to be presented to the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies, will
suggest the reinstatement of the Western
Culture requirement dropped here in
1969.
While the details of how it hopes to
implement the requirement are still un

certain pending the return of a faculty
interest questionnaire, the task force has
issued a report which concludes that a
freshman requirement in Western cul
ture is desirable.
"Western culture is not the sole prop
erty of some single contemporary ethnic
group," reads the task force's fourth
statement.
"It is a rich and complex intellectual
experience that is part of the heritage of
all our students in addition to any other
that they may enjoy. An education that
fails to provide some fairly systematic
study of this heritage is not serving stu
dents well."
The suggested reinstatement of a re
quirement dropped just nine years ago
may be surprising. But a consideration of
factors at work then and today sheds light
on this new development in under
graduate education here.
On June 5, 1969, the Faculty Senate
voted to simplify undergraduate course
requirements. Western culture and
foreign languages were no longer univer
sally required for a bachelor's degree.
The senate vote came as a response to
suggestions made by the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford (SES), and a group of 40
students, the Student Education Council,
formed to hear and discuss SES recom
mendations.
SES was the first general review of the
University's educational programs since
1954 and the scope of its study included
financial aid, University government and
campus environment.
Chaired by then-Vice Provost Herbert
Packer, SES suggested a new concept of
undergraduate education which would
place more responsibility on the indi

vidual student to determine his own edu
cation and encourage faculty members to
teach in their areas of greatest interest
and specialization.
"At the present time, and for the past 10
years, the 'general education' part of the
Stanford student's program has been
guided by a set of highly detailed rules
called General Studies requirements,"
wrote Packer in 1968.
"I won't bore you with a recitation of
them; it takes three columns of closely
packed prose simply to set them out in

'I can remember the debates in
the faculty at the time. People in
economics and psychology got
up and said that those subjects
were more necessary to modern
life than history.' â€”Prof. Paul
Seaver

Courses and Degrees. The intent, of
course, is to see to it that students get a
well-rounded exposure to lots of diffe
rent fields of knowledge.
"The result, unhappily, is that the letter
kills the spirit, and the fulfillment of Gen
eral Studies requirements becomes an
end in itself rather than a means of guid
ing students to rational choice."
The SES findings were not the only fac
tors to influence senate voting in 1969.
Ron Rebholz, chairman of the Western
Culture task force, said the SES
philosophy that education is most suc
cessful when teachers teach what they
want to teach and students learn what

they want to learn catered to an attitude
of anti-authoritarianism.
"It was killed because of the climate of
the times along with a lot of other re
quirements," said Paul Seaver, associate
history professor, who headed the West
ern Civilization course teaching team in
the late 19605.
"Fundamentally the whole concept of
requirements was inimical to the pursuit
of free education."
According to some professors, the
Western Civilization course nad
weakened even before it was dropped as
a requirement.
"U/ider the fair amount of chaos at the
time, I don't think the Western Civiliza
tion requirement was in quite as good
shape as it once had been," said Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Halsey Royden.
"Instructors began drifting from the
central focus of the course into a stress on
the modern," he said. -
Assoc. English Prof. William Chace, ag
reed.
"The History Department wasn't really
sponsoring it anymore," he said.
"I think that it was a soft victim which
might have deserved victimization but
which was victimized for different social
and cultural reasons."
Seaver rejected the idea that the course
was responsible for its own downfall.
Faculty pressure was more important in
ending the requirement than either stu
dent protest or course unpopularity, Sea
ver said.
Other departments were hoping to
have their funds increased when the
Western Civilization budget was low
ered, agreed Lewis Spitz, history profes
sor and associate dean of humanities and

sciences.
"We had a nice little fat budget for
Western Civilization," Spitz added.
After 1969, fewer students received the
basic historical training provided by the
Western Civilization course, and some
professors said they noticed a drop in
educational standards.
Rebholz called the students' ignorance
of historical figures "astounding" and
said that extra time had to be spent at the
beginning of each quarter to provide a
simple foundation.
