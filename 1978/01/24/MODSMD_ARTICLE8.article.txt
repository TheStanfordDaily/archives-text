# Amtrak unique experience

To many, Amtrak (our national
train service) has become a symbol of
big government and bureaucracy; its
inefficiencies and failures. Undoub
tedly, irate friends or relatives have
told you their horror stories of Am
trak's lateness, derailments and de
couplings. Well, I feel that the record
needs to be set straight, or at least
modified. Last year I rode some three
dozen trains across 15,000 miles of
track. As a result, I now nostalgically
crave to repeat the whole experi
ence. I am hopelessly in love with
trains. Masochism? Vou be the
judge.
No matter how hard Amtrak tries
to ruin a trip, it cannot denigrate the
indisputable fact that trains are a
fundamentally superior form of
traveling cross-country. Unlike
highways, train tracks cut through
the heart of lush scenery without de
stroying the surrounding eco
systems. No billboards, mileage
signs, or artificial landscapes clutter
your view. Moreover, you can con
centrate on the mountains, forests or
rivers, instead of on whether some
clandestine highway patrolperson
waits around the next bend to arrest
you for speeding at 56 miles per
hour.
Unlike buses, train passengers
tend to be pacifists and cheerful. Just
for reference, I took one bus from
West Virginia to Ohio. In front of me,
some battered Vietnam heroes
showed off their wounds the whole
way. Behind me, a fist fight erupted
between an obese lady wrestler and a
drunken manure farmer. Mean
while, the driver kept announcing,
"Relax, err, we'll be there in a few
minutes." At the Cleveland bus sta
tion, I was hit for drug purchases
three times. Buses are three ring Fel
lini movies.
Unlike planes, trains allow more
time to meet and enjoy the company
of your fellow passengers. Too often
our caffeine-addicted selves are
overly concerned with the speed of
travel, not the quality. But a good
social journey makes the rest of a
vacation far more enjoyable. Vou can
slowly mentally prepare foryour next
destination.
Diverse beasts
On the train, I was able to party
with people as diverse as the beasts
in the Star Wars saloon: a nuclear
reactor plumber, a baseball mound
builder, a French ultraradical, elderly
gold prospectors, eager barber stu
dents, marine drill sergeants, and
even an entire Irish rugby team.
Amateur musicians would frequently
lead carloads full of us crazies in
drunken cacophonies. Any group of
people cooped up in such small

space for two or three days must be
cheery, lest it go mad.
Unity was cemented by the shared
feeling that Amtrak was the common
enemy. Passengers saw themselves
worthy of purple hearts after surviv
ing the ordeals of each trip. But Am
trak seemed to encourage such so
cial interaction. At meals, I was al
ways seated with three other stran
gers. Sometimes, however, the
combinations were hopeless. For
example, the sleepy synergism of
eating with a senile Yiddish grand
mother, a pompous New York stage
director and the Fonz' older brother
caused nearly terminal indigestion.
It's hard to believe how hard Am
trak tried (and failed!) to make my
trip miserable. On my first evening, I
slept in my new Antarctic sleeping
bag when my coach car became
slightly chilly. By morning, the heat
ing had gone berserk and the temper
ature soared info the high 90s. I
awoke 10 pounds thinner.
I sought financial revenge and
brought my own meals on board to
undercut the dining car's overpriced
food. I carried a suitcase full of
granola, pineapple juice, peanut but
ter, jelly, soft drinks, rum, beer, etc.
Waiters were unamused when I
would only order a cup of ice for
breakfast or lunch. Other passengers
took notice — some resenting my
crumbs, and others begging for lef
tovers.
Exorbitance
But Amtrak was not easily flus
tered. One evening, I finally gave in
to the dining car's exorbitance and
shared a flounder dinner with a tele
phone £scecutive, who gave me some
pointers on howtovoid my outstand
ing bills. Shortly after dessert, I
sensed that something was amiss. I
ran back to my seat, only to discover
that my entire car had vanished. I
learned from the chuckling conduc
tor that the car had been uncoupled
in Albany. "Gee, we was wonderin'
whose things those were."
Consequently, I made an unex
pected stop in Rochester at 3 a.m. I
quote my crusty journal: "I may be
seeing things, but assuming I'm
sane, we were just unloaded in a pile
of debris which they call the con
struction site of a new luxurious $2
million station. Broken bricks, splin
ters, smashed glass. I sat under
fluorescent lights that projected
nowhere — mere white specks on a
dismal black canvas. A policeman
herded me into a bunker downstairs
while he ordered a stubby Amtrak
attendant to lock up the doors. "You
wouldn't have lasted long out
there." Below is an empty wasteland
of dusty concrete and long benches

painted in dull shades of flesh. "Are
you locking me in?" No reply. . . .
Immunity
By the time I was on my final
eastbound trip, I had developed
something of an immunity to Am
trak's bag of tricks. But I hardly ex
pected the sound of breaking glass to
wake me up on my last morning. As I
rubbed the sleep out of my eyes, I
watched two conductors pathetically
sweeping a flaming laundry bag
overboard. The smoke cleared and
their assistants quietly put their axes
back into the cabinet above my head.
Business as usual.
That train was late, but only by
eight hours. I was stuck in Chicago
for a night and in the true spirit of
compassion, Amtrak agreed to buy
me a free meal, even though I didn't
qualify for a hotel room. The next
morning, I smiled a toothy grin as I
received a $24 rebate for my mid
night snack. "Look buster, you get
hungry sleeping on your streets!"
Well, there you have it. A beautiful
trip that I will hold forever dear in my
annals. I sincerely urge every daring
Stanford student to try Amtrak at
least once. It will be one of the most
unique experiences of your life, pro
viding you survive.
