Mem Chu gate
Someone obviously believes that
the new card-operated gate being in
stalled behind Memorial Church will
reduce hazards to bicyclists and
pedestrians traveling by that route.
We cannot agree with this.
We do not dispute the fact that ex
cess automobile traffic around
Memorial Church has been a prob
lem for those on bicycles or on foot.
We've dodged cars in a hurry to get
in or out of the area behind the
church countless times, while simul
taneously avoiding pedestrians and
other bikes.
The alleged purpose of the gate is
to reduce auto congestion and in
crease safety for members of the
Stanford community choosing other
forms of transport. To this, we can
only reply, "The road to the
emergency room is paved with good
intentions."
According to an announcement in
Campus Report, "Bicyclists will be
able to pass the barrier." Apparently
none of those who approved the in
stallation have ever stood out t+iere
during the 10-minute passing
periods between classes during the
day. Since the gates will be on the
orderof eight feet long, judging from
similar barriers already on campus,
16 feet of road space would no longer
be available for walking or biking
along this heavily-traveled route.
Trying to squeeze hundreds of
people through the remaining in
adequate space is inviting serious in
jury.
The question of a possible alterna
tive to the proposed gate is a thorny
one. Unfortunately, at this point, we
can offer no ideas without spending
a considerable amount of time look
ing into the matter.
However, we urge those in author
ity to reconsider, and re-examine,
any alternatives they turned down
previously, in light of the questions
we have raised.

PLO column
Alex Alben's column (Daily, Jan.
20) contained several inaccurate or
misleading statements. He claimed,
for instance, that "the PLO has never
been chosen by the Palestinians as

their representatives in a free elec
tion." Since the Palestinians do not
have a country of their own, they can
hardly hold elections.
However, when the Israeli gov
ernment permitted local elections to
be held on the West Bank in the
spring of 1976, PLO-backed candi
dates won overwhelmingly. A recent
Associated Press poll of West Bank
citizens showed similar support.
Broad and amorphous as it is, the
PLO happens to be the only organi
zation that has brought the Palesti
nians' case before the world and that
can claim to represent them.
As for terrorist acts, which Alben
claims belie the PLO's willingness to
live in peace with Israel, the leader
ship renounced such tactics in 1970
and condemned the individuals and
organizations responsible. Tragi
cally, if there is no possibility of a
settlement that recognizes Palesti
nian rights to nationhood there may
well be further acts of violence â€” the
last resort of desperate people, as
Menahem Begin can testify.
Declarations
Alben insists that the PLO would
use an independent state to destroy
Israel. But time and again there have
been declarations that the PLO
would recognize Israel if Israel made
any move toward granting Palestinian
independence. This month Yasser
Arafat announced that if a Palestinian
state were established the PLO
would welcome an international
peace keeping force on the territory,
made up of armed forces from
member-nations of the U.N. Security
Council.
It is just not true, as Alben says,
that "almost all of the Arab prisoners
in Israeli jails were caught commit
ting acts of terrorism." Among the
more than 3000 Arab prisoners held
by Israel are those who protested
forced eviction from their homes,
those who distributed anti-Israeli lit
erature, and suspected members of
proscribed organizations. In at least
one case a group was arrested for
singing an anti-Israeli song at a wed
ding.
Referring to Israeli use of torture,
Alben declares that it is "not excusa
ble" if true, and then proceeds to
justify it. His statement condemns it
self and is only further evidence that
forced occupation brutalizes the oc
cupiers and those who support
them, as well as their victims.

ASSU refusal
On )an. 9, the ASSU Nominations
Committee refused to nominate stu
dents to the new Committee on In
vestment Responsibility. The next
night, the ASSU Senate upheld the
nominations committee's decision.
Needless to say, the boycott of a Uni
versity committee by the ASSU is cal
led for only in the most extreme cir
cumstances. It is the belief of the
governing body of the ASSU that the
time has come for the question of
investment responsibility at Stanford
to be taken out of the committee
quagmire, and brought directly be
fore the Stanford community.
Tonight there will be an informa
tional meeting to explain the ASSU's
refusal to appoint students to the
CIR, and to answer any questions
you may have regarding the ASSU's
position on investment responsibil
ity. We are asking you to encourage
the members of your organization,
group, or residence to attend this
meeting.
It is important to remember that
the University's investment policies
and practices affect not only the qual
ity of our education at Stanford, but
also the lives of the people whose
work produces profits for the com
panies in which Stanford invests. Be
cause we benefit from the returns on
Stanford's investments, we must
take some share of responsibility for
how those returns are generated.
For the ASSU to effectively repre
sent students' concerns on this im
portant issue, we need to hear from
you, and other organizations. We are
also holding meetings with dorms
and organizations to discuss the is
sue. If you are interested in arranging
a meeting with your organization or
dorm, please contact us at the ASSU.
Thanks much for your help! Hope
to hear from you!

Latvians
As members of Stanford's Latvian
"community," we feel compelled to
respond to |oe Sweeney's column
(Daily, Nov. 29) concerning his view
of Latvian self-respect. We feel that
his callous and flippant attitude is
certainly not a respectful view of an
oppressed people. He lists some ac
curate facts concerning Latvia's lost
independence, but unfortunately
does not find cause to treat Latvia's

past and present ordeal seriously.
Throughout their "long and proud
heritage," the Latvian people have
only had the opportunity to exercise
their own sovereignty for a mere 22
years, from 1918 to 1940. That
Sweeney should find humor in Lat
via's predicament and ridicule the
"many cries" of other minorities
shows his insensitivity to the basic
struggle for all ethnic groups to de
termine their own fate.
The fact that this column seems to
have been intended as a joke bet
ween two fraternity brothers does lit
tle to justify its appearance on the
Daily editorial page.
