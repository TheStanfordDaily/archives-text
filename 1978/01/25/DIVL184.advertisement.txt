It's your page!
Do you have a compelling (or not-so-compelling) opinion that you would like to
share with other members of the Stanford community? Do you have a legitimate
complaint you would like others to hear? Do you enjoy writing satire?
If you answered affirmatively to any of these questions, the Daily invites you to
contribute to the opinions page. The only requirements are that you type your
material double-spaced on a 57-space-line and not exceed 80 lines.
If you especially enjoy conveying your opinions, you may apply to be a columnist.
The Daily will accept a limited number of new columnists for the next volume. To
apply to be a columnist, you merely need to submit an example of your writing by
Friday, Feb. 3.
All contributions to the opinions page are subject to editing. The Daily regrets that
the return of any material cannot be guaranteed. Contributions may be submitted in
person at the Daily in the Storke Publications Building or mailed to: Opinions, The
Stanford Daily, Storke Publications Building, Stanford, CA 94305.
