Although many faculty opposed abolishing the West
ern Civilization requirement in 1969, the first major push
for reinstatement did not come until January 1976.
The Committee on Reform and Renewal, appointed
by Dean of Humanities and Sciences Halsey Royden in
fall 1975 to review undergraduate education, published
a list of five suggestions.
Reinstatement of a Western Culture requirement was
the first recommendation.
After several meetings that spring, the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US) decided not to endorse a
formal requirement, although the value of studying
Western culture was recognized.
Despite the C-US recommendation, the Faculty Se
nate voted December 2,1976, to begin development of a
new Western Culture requirement.
Brad Krevoy, a senior and member for C-US for two
years, said he was surprised by the vote.
"I was disappointed because the committee system
here is supposedly important but they passed right over
our recommendation," he said.
Faculty support?
Faculty support wavered during debates, said Krevoy,
and the pressure of influential members was important
in determining the final vote.
Krevoy said the senate vote did not mandate
reinstatement, but only opened the way for develop
ment. If a satisfactory means of implementing the course
is not found, the requirement will not be reinstated, he

said.
The task force, selected in lanuary 1977 by C-US in
consultation with the deans, set out to investigate possi
ble ways of satisfying the requirement.
After almost a year of work, the task force has issued a
fourth preliminary statement for discussion.
Premises
Certain premises have been established. The course is
generally envisioned as a three-quarter sequence of
five-unit courses covering Western culture from ancient
Greece to the modern age.
A single course to be taken by all students has been
suggested.
Task force members agreed that unless a high-quality
course can be designed, the requirement would be a
mistake, but they must still agree on the best way to
implement the course.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Herant Katchadou
rian summarized some of the questions which still face
the task force:
1) How should the question of giving all students a
common educational experience be reconciled with al
lowing for student choice?
2) Should faculty be asked to teach outside their field
of specialization?
3) How will the ratio of faculty members to outside
teachers be determined?
4) Would the course cover only historical humanities
or should sciences and technology be included?
5) Should the course be narrowly defined as Western
Culture or should other cultures be included?

The many questions which remain are clear from the
alternate proposals which have been submitted by
members of the faculty outside the task force.
Such proposals are encouraging, said Asst. Political
Science Prof. Nannerl Keohane, a member of the task
force.
Andy Brown, a junior and member of both C-US and
the task force, said he is less optimistic.
The failure of faculty members to agree on a general
outline for the course is indicative ot the problems that
will eventually face the requirement, he said.
"The priorities at Stanford are not in humanities and
social sciences and not in undergraduate studies," said
Brown. "Without that kind of faculty interest, the prop
osals won't work."
Just how great faculty interest is will be known when
the results of the faculty survey questionnaire now being
completed are compiled.
In addition to tabulating the survey, members of the
task force plan to work on the details of a multiple-track
proposal which would allow for greater student choice,
before presenting a final proposal to C-US by the end of
the quarter.
Recommendations either for or against the task force
proposal will be carried by C-US io the senate where a
vote on the proposal will be made.
If the proposal is adopted, a suggested two-year pilot
program with volunteer students could go into effect as
early as next fall.
Gauging student response to the task force proposals
has been difficult, said Rrown, because no current stu

dents will be affected by the decision.
Brown said he opposes the idea of a University-wide
requirement.
"I feel that you can give a pretty strong rationale for
the study of Western culture, but you don't need a
requirement," he said.
Better advising
Krevoy agreed and said that with better under
graduate advising, students would be more likely to
voluntarily select a well-balanced curriculum.
Both Brown and Krevoy are members of the recently
formed ASSU ad hoc Panel on Western Culture created
by the Council of Presidents.
This group of 10 students will present criticisms of the
models being suggested along with an evaluation of the
Western Culture requirement to the ASSU and the se
nate.
Whatever surfaces in the meetings ahead, a final deci
sion on the requirement should be reached by )une.
The motives of faculty members who support the
reinstatement of the requirement are mixed, said Assoc.
History Prof. Paul Seaver, who headed the old Western
Civilization course.
Some noticed a decline in standards which led them to
push for the reinstatement of the requirement, he said.
' Other people, I think, resented the '60s and see this
as a return to normalcy," he added.
Whether the course is required, said Seaver, students
should actively seek classes that will serve them best.
"I think it's a tragedy that bright people become ac
customed to a passive education."

Undergraduate Studies (C-US) decided not to endorse a
formal requirement, although the value of studying
Western culture was recognized.
Despite the C-US recommendation, the Faculty Se
nate voted December 2,1976, to begin development of a
new Western Culture requirement.
Brad Krevoy, a senior and member for C-US for two
years, said he was surprised by the vote.
"I was disappointed because the committee system
here is supposedly important but they passed right over
our recommendation," he said.
Faculty support?
Faculty support wavered during debates, said Krevoy,
and the pressure of influential members was important
in determining the final vote.
Krevoy said the senate vote did not mandate
reinstatement, but only opened the way for develop
ment. If a satisfactory means of implementing the course
is not found, the requirement will not be reinstated, he

said.
The task force, selected in lanuary 1977 by C-US in
consultation with the deans, set out to investigate possi
ble ways of satisfying the requirement.
After almost a year of work, the task force has issued a
fourth preliminary statement for discussion.
Premises
Certain premises have been established. The course is
generally envisioned as a three-quarter sequence of
five-unit courses covering Western culture from ancient
Greece to the modern age.
A single course to be taken by all students has been
suggested.
Task force members agreed that unless a high-quality
course can be designed, the requirement would be a
mistake, but they must still agree on the best way to
implement the course.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Herant Katchadou
rian summarized some of the questions which still face
the task force:
1) How should the question of giving all students a
common educational experience be reconciled with al
lowing for student choice?
2) Should faculty be asked to teach outside their field
of specialization?
3) How will the ratio of faculty members to outside
teachers be determined?
4) Would the course cover only historical humanities
or should sciences and technology be included?
5) Should the course be narrowly defined as Western
Culture or should other cultures be included?

The many questions which remain are clear from the
alternate proposals which have been submitted by
members of the faculty outside the task force.
Such proposals are encouraging, said Asst. Political
Science Prof. Nannerl Keohane, a member of the task
force.
Andy Brown, a junior and member of both C-US and
the task force, said he is less optimistic.
The failure of faculty members to agree on a general
outline for the course is indicative ot the problems that
will eventually face the requirement, he said.
"The priorities at Stanford are not in humanities and
social sciences and not in undergraduate studies," said
Brown. "Without that kind of faculty interest, the prop
osals won't work."
Just how great faculty interest is will be known when
the results of the faculty survey questionnaire now being
completed are compiled.
In addition to tabulating the survey, members of the
task force plan to work on the details of a multiple-track
proposal which would allow for greater student choice,
before presenting a final proposal to C-US by the end of
the quarter.
Recommendations either for or against the task force
proposal will be carried by C-US io the senate where a
vote on the proposal will be made.
If the proposal is adopted, a suggested two-year pilot
program with volunteer students could go into effect as
early as next fall.
Gauging student response to the task force proposals
has been difficult, said Rrown, because no current stu

dents will be affected by the decision.
Brown said he opposes the idea of a University-wide
requirement.
"I feel that you can give a pretty strong rationale for
the study of Western culture, but you don't need a
requirement," he said.
Better advising
Krevoy agreed and said that with better under
graduate advising, students would be more likely to
voluntarily select a well-balanced curriculum.
Both Brown and Krevoy are members of the recently
formed ASSU ad hoc Panel on Western Culture created
by the Council of Presidents.
This group of 10 students will present criticisms of the
models being suggested along with an evaluation of the
Western Culture requirement to the ASSU and the se
nate.
Whatever surfaces in the meetings ahead, a final deci
sion on the requirement should be reached by )une.
The motives of faculty members who support the
reinstatement of the requirement are mixed, said Assoc.
History Prof. Paul Seaver, who headed the old Western
Civilization course.
Some noticed a decline in standards which led them to
push for the reinstatement of the requirement, he said.
' Other people, I think, resented the '60s and see this
as a return to normalcy," he added.
Whether the course is required, said Seaver, students
should actively seek classes that will serve them best.
"I think it's a tragedy that bright people become ac
customed to a passive education."

Faculty support?
Faculty support wavered during debates, said Krevoy,
and the pressure of influential members was important
in determining the final vote.
Krevoy said the senate vote did not mandate
reinstatement, but only opened the way for develop
ment. If a satisfactory means of implementing the course
is not found, the requirement will not be reinstated, he

said.
The task force, selected in lanuary 1977 by C-US in
consultation with the deans, set out to investigate possi
ble ways of satisfying the requirement.
After almost a year of work, the task force has issued a
fourth preliminary statement for discussion.
Premises
Certain premises have been established. The course is
generally envisioned as a three-quarter sequence of
five-unit courses covering Western culture from ancient
Greece to the modern age.
A single course to be taken by all students has been
suggested.
Task force members agreed that unless a high-quality
course can be designed, the requirement would be a
mistake, but they must still agree on the best way to
implement the course.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Herant Katchadou
rian summarized some of the questions which still face
the task force:
1) How should the question of giving all students a
common educational experience be reconciled with al
lowing for student choice?
2) Should faculty be asked to teach outside their field
of specialization?
3) How will the ratio of faculty members to outside
teachers be determined?
4) Would the course cover only historical humanities
or should sciences and technology be included?
5) Should the course be narrowly defined as Western
Culture or should other cultures be included?

The many questions which remain are clear from the
alternate proposals which have been submitted by
members of the faculty outside the task force.
Such proposals are encouraging, said Asst. Political
Science Prof. Nannerl Keohane, a member of the task
force.
Andy Brown, a junior and member of both C-US and
the task force, said he is less optimistic.
The failure of faculty members to agree on a general
outline for the course is indicative ot the problems that
will eventually face the requirement, he said.
"The priorities at Stanford are not in humanities and
social sciences and not in undergraduate studies," said
Brown. "Without that kind of faculty interest, the prop
osals won't work."
Just how great faculty interest is will be known when
the results of the faculty survey questionnaire now being
completed are compiled.
In addition to tabulating the survey, members of the
task force plan to work on the details of a multiple-track
proposal which would allow for greater student choice,
before presenting a final proposal to C-US by the end of
the quarter.
Recommendations either for or against the task force
proposal will be carried by C-US io the senate where a
vote on the proposal will be made.
If the proposal is adopted, a suggested two-year pilot
program with volunteer students could go into effect as
early as next fall.
Gauging student response to the task force proposals
has been difficult, said Rrown, because no current stu

dents will be affected by the decision.
Brown said he opposes the idea of a University-wide
requirement.
"I feel that you can give a pretty strong rationale for
the study of Western culture, but you don't need a
requirement," he said.
Better advising
Krevoy agreed and said that with better under
graduate advising, students would be more likely to
voluntarily select a well-balanced curriculum.
Both Brown and Krevoy are members of the recently
formed ASSU ad hoc Panel on Western Culture created
by the Council of Presidents.
This group of 10 students will present criticisms of the
models being suggested along with an evaluation of the
Western Culture requirement to the ASSU and the se
nate.
Whatever surfaces in the meetings ahead, a final deci
sion on the requirement should be reached by )une.
The motives of faculty members who support the
reinstatement of the requirement are mixed, said Assoc.
History Prof. Paul Seaver, who headed the old Western
Civilization course.
Some noticed a decline in standards which led them to
push for the reinstatement of the requirement, he said.
' Other people, I think, resented the '60s and see this
as a return to normalcy," he added.
Whether the course is required, said Seaver, students
should actively seek classes that will serve them best.
"I think it's a tragedy that bright people become ac
customed to a passive education."
