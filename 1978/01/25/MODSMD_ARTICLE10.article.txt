# Profs speak on eurocommunism
## 
### Rob Lempert 
Eurocommunism was the
topic of discussion Monday
night in Terman Auditorium
with three professors debat
ing the subject at a forum
sponsored by Stanford New
Directions.
Alexander Dallin, Stan
ford professor of history,
Giovanni Sartori, professor
of political science and
Richard Lowenthal,
emeritus professor of inter
national relationsat the Free
University of Berlin, di
rected their comments
mostly at Italy which they
said has the largest and
most powerful communist
party in the history of the
free world.
Lowenthal, who was ex
pelled from the German
communist party 50 years
ago, opened the forum by
addressing the question,
what is eurocommunism?
He said traditional Rus
sian communism is a mix
ture of Marx's western
philosophy and an eastern,
anti-czarist revolutionary
zeal forced together by Le
nin. He said no developed
country has ever had a
communist revolution and
after 1945 Western Euro
pean communists were in a
ridiculous position because
the proletariat was integ
rated into a democratic soc
iety.
Lowenthal said
eurocommunism is a break
with the Soviet model and
stresses free elections and
individual rights, including
the right of opposition to
the government. He said
however, that each coun
try's party is very different in
situation and philosophy.
Dallin stressed that each
party "adapts to its own
political environment" and

used the term "topless
communism" to describe
the fragmentation of Mos
cow's role as the leader of
world communism.
Sartori said the Italian
communist party is "unpre
cedented" in its power. He
said that if it does form a
coalition government with
the ruling Christian Democ
rats, it will become the do
minant member of the al
liance ruling Italy.
Sartori said the com
munists, with 34 percent of

the voters behind them,
could enter the government
at anv time but have not
chosen to do so yet. He said
Italians have a right to feel
troubled.
Lowenthal said com
munist coalition in Italy
might pose "a real danger of
weakening the Western Al
liance (NATO)." But he ad
ded, citing the country's
terrible economic situation,
decay of democracy in Italy
or to try to stabilize it with
the help of the com
munists."

Dallin said the com
munists are already a vital
part of Italian government
and seem very genuine in
their devotion to
eurocommunism. "Their
stance is the real thing, its
not ordained by Moscow."
Lowenthal said a com
munist coalition would be
fairly conservative econom
ically and would stay in
NATO to counter the War
saw Pact, but that they
would not support the
United States in the Middle
East or Africa.
All three speakers
criticized U.S. foreign pol
icy for making enemies with
European communists by
speaking out against them.
Dallin said eurocom
munism is a great threat to
the Soviets and should be
an opportunity for the U.S.
to foster a progressive im
age. But it hasn't been. "We
can't believe it's real," he
said.
Lowenthal said the U.S.
should wt?igh the risks, and
if it sees the communists as
dangerous he said it would
be justified in pursuing
measures, such as sending
vast amounts of aid to sup
port the Christian Democ
rats, to stop the spread of
communism.
Sartori, who said the risk
is enormous with or without
the communists, also said
the U.S. should not cut off
aid to Italy if the com
munists take power for fear
of driving them closer to the
Soviets.
Lowenthal said that due
to Brezhnev's illness, a
major generation change is
on hand in the Soviet Un
ion, and the future of
eurocommunism might
help determine who next
leads Russia.

age. But it hasn't been. "We
can't believe it's real," he
said.
Lowenthal said the U.S.
should wt?igh the risks, and
if it sees the communists as
dangerous he said it would
be justified in pursuing
measures, such as sending
vast amounts of aid to sup
port the Christian Democ
rats, to stop the spread of
communism.
Sartori, who said the risk
is enormous with or without
the communists, also said
the U.S. should not cut off
aid to Italy if the com
munists take power for fear
of driving them closer to the
Soviets.
Lowenthal said that due
to Brezhnev's illness, a
major generation change is
on hand in the Soviet Un
ion, and the future of
eurocommunism might
help determine who next
leads Russia.

Eurocommunism was the
topic of discussion Monday
night in Terman Auditorium
with three professors debat
ing the subject at a forum
sponsored by Stanford New
Directions.
Alexander Dallin, Stan
ford professor of history,
Giovanni Sartori, professor
of political science and
Richard Lowenthal,
emeritus professor of inter
national relationsat the Free
University of Berlin, di
rected their comments
mostly at Italy which they
said has the largest and
most powerful communist
party in the history of the
free world.
Lowenthal, who was ex
pelled from the German
communist party 50 years
ago, opened the forum by
addressing the question,
what is eurocommunism?
He said traditional Rus
sian communism is a mix
ture of Marx's western
philosophy and an eastern,
anti-czarist revolutionary
zeal forced together by Le
nin. He said no developed
country has ever had a
communist revolution and
after 1945 Western Euro
pean communists were in a
ridiculous position because
the proletariat was integ
rated into a democratic soc
iety.
Lowenthal said
eurocommunism is a break
with the Soviet model and
stresses free elections and
individual rights, including
the right of opposition to
the government. He said
however, that each coun
try's party is very different in
situation and philosophy.
Dallin stressed that each
party "adapts to its own
political environment" and

used the term "topless
communism" to describe
the fragmentation of Mos
cow's role as the leader of
world communism.
Sartori said the Italian
communist party is "unpre
cedented" in its power. He
said that if it does form a
coalition government with
the ruling Christian Democ
rats, it will become the do
minant member of the al
liance ruling Italy.
Sartori said the com
munists, with 34 percent of

the voters behind them,
could enter the government
at anv time but have not
chosen to do so yet. He said
Italians have a right to feel
troubled.
Lowenthal said com
munist coalition in Italy
might pose "a real danger of
weakening the Western Al
liance (NATO)." But he ad
ded, citing the country's
terrible economic situation,
decay of democracy in Italy
or to try to stabilize it with
the help of the com
munists."

Dallin said the com
munists are already a vital
part of Italian government
and seem very genuine in
their devotion to
eurocommunism. "Their
stance is the real thing, its
not ordained by Moscow."
Lowenthal said a com
munist coalition would be
fairly conservative econom
ically and would stay in
NATO to counter the War
saw Pact, but that they
would not support the
United States in the Middle
East or Africa.
All three speakers
criticized U.S. foreign pol
icy for making enemies with
European communists by
speaking out against them.
Dallin said eurocom
munism is a great threat to
the Soviets and should be
an opportunity for the U.S.
to foster a progressive im
age. But it hasn't been. "We
can't believe it's real," he
said.
Lowenthal said the U.S.
should wt?igh the risks, and
