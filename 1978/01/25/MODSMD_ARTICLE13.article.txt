Childcare, while not a
pressing concern for most
undergraduates, is a prob
lem for many graduate
students. The question of
how their children will be
cared for causes many a
headache.
Good childcare
facilities, particularly
those with after-school
programs, are limited in
the Stanford community.
Some have waiting lists of
120 families. The facilities
located on campus in
clude the Children's
Center of the Stanford
Community (CCSC) on
Pampas Lane, the Escon
dido Village Nursery
School and Bing Nursery
School on Escondido
Road.
Parent involvement is a
basic part of CCSD's
philosophy. Parents de
cide on policy, maintain
the buildings on work days
and spend a certain
number of hours each
month with the kids.
Additionally, parent par
ticipation centers enable
parents to give each other
support. Big Kid's Place,
for 3- and 4-year-olds, has
50 kids and Little Kid's
Place, for children 9
months to 3 years old, has
45. CCSC is open five days
a week from 7:30 to 5:30
and costs 90 cents a child

per hour.
Parent reaction to CCSC
has been quite favorable.
Medical student Kathy
Steiner's 4-year-old
daughter attends Big kid's
Place, and she is quite
satisfied with the center.
"I've been most pleased
with the quality of care,
especially at Big Kid's
Place," Steiner said. "The
people are very warm and
the programs are well
conducted and interest
ing. Mv daughter's verv
happy there The 4-year
old concurred saying she
likes her school just
fine."
"The facilities here
make it a lot easier for me
to study. It means every
thing to me to have my
kids well cared for,"
Steiner added.
Bing Nursery School,
with a clientele of 250 chil
dren," is open for infants
up to 5 year olds, and has
morning (9 to 11:30) and
afternoon (1:30 to 4) ses
sions. As of )anuary 9, a
new after-school program
has been added for kids
4Vi to 7'/i years old.
The Stanford New
After-school Program
(SNAP) project was
housed in the Lucille
Nixon School from 1975 to
1976, and has been look
ing for a space ever since
their room was taken away

by the Nixon School for
necessary school ac
tivities.
The after-school prog
ram is open five days a
week, including most
holidays, from noon to
5:30. It costs $1.25 per
child per hour. Bing Nur
sery School is affiliated
with the Psychology De
partment in researching
child development.
International
Escondido Village Nur
sery S( hool accommodates
75 kids ages _d' j to 5 and,
like Bing, has morning
(8:30 to noon) and after
noon (1 to 4:30) sessions.
Like CCSC, it is run by a
parent board and parent
participation is required. It
is unique, however, be
cause of its international
flavor. Twenty five diffe
rent nationalities are rep
resented.
To enroll a child at CCSC
or at Escondido Village
Nursery School, the pa
rent must be a Stanford
student or a member of
the faculty or staff. If the
hours, requirements, oi
diffcrm programs of
these facilities don't meet
the lamiiy s needs, alter
natives such as tamily day
care (women who take
large numbers of children
into their homes), or a pri
vate sitter are available.
However, this option is
more expensive than or
ganized group childcare
which costs $7 a day on the
average.
Even with reduced rates
for students, childcare can
gobble up as much of the
budget as the rent. Stan
ford provides the build
ings for tfiese facilities, but
furnishings, equipment,
salaries and upkeep are
paid for by the children's
tuition, parent's work (in
cooperatives) and fund
raising.
For working parents,

good childcare has to be
counted as one of the
necessities of life. Good
facilities are available in
the Stanford community,
but more are needed.
Dorothea Almong, presi
dent of the Council on
Childcare at Stanford,
feels strongly about this.
"It is so important to get
very good care for
younger children," she
stated. "We hope there
will be an increasing reali
zation of the need for
childcare by institutions.
Stanford should be in the
vanguard."
