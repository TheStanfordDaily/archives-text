# Doctors argue desirability of midwifery
## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
A dictionary defines the term
midwife as a woman who helps
women in childbirth, yet this
seemingly simple concept
arouses much controversy.
The basic question is, which
is preferable in childbirth —
modern techno'ogy or
psychological well-being?
Opinions vary and the debate
continues among all members
of the birthing community.
Midwives are not presently
permitted to practice at Stan
ford Hospital, but Dr. Donald
Creevy, a Palo Alto obstetri
cian, claims, "Within the next
six months Stanford must ac
cept midwifery."
To this, Dr. LeRoy Heinrichs,
chairman of gynecology and
obstetrics at Stanford Medical
Center responds, "That's his
opinion. About a third of the
staff at Stanford would not par
ticipate in alternative methods
of birth."
"The concept of midwifery is
foreign to American
medicine," Heinrichs said.
Heinrichs emphasized that
Stanford Hospital is a medical
school hospital, training to
morrow's physicians, and
there is no mandate for mid
wifery.
"I don't know why a woman
would prefer a midwife. As for
the health of the fetus, one
should want the verv best, not

a less experienced midwife,
but someone practiced in med
ical surveillance," Heinrichs
continued.
"It is the obstetrician's re
sponsibility to make sure no
thing is abnormal," he said,
emphasizing the double nega
tive. "Technology is required
to recognize the baby in trou
ble, and electronic monitoring
is unavailable to lay midwives."
Creevy, on the other hand,
asserts, "Midwives are viewed
as incompetent and as far as
I'm concerned, that's a bunch
of baloney. They provide bet
ter care psychologically be
cause physicians are trained to
view pregnancy pathologi
cally."
According to Heinrichs,
"American women have always
demanded anesthesia and
midwives can't apply it."
But Harriet Palmer, a Bay
Area nurse midwife, disagrees.
"Because the woman has
been educated and knows
what's happening, she doesn't
usually require medication.
However, a nurse midwife can
apply small amounts of medi
cation if necessary."
Sensitivity
Ann Robinson, who recently
gave birth with the assistance
ot a midwife and Dr. Creevy,
holds a different view.
"It's not just hippies who
can't afford hospitals who use

midwives," she said. "It's a
matter of sensitivity."
Robinson said she believes it
is difficult for a man to under
stand how a woman feels dur
ing labor and that he is apt to
misinterpret her feelings.
Robinson had planned a
home birth, but because her

child was 23 days premature,
she had to go to the hospital.
"To use a midwife, a woman
must plan two births; a home
birth, and, in case anything
goes wrong, a hospital birth,''
she said.
"During labor I asked for an
ice chip to chew on and Dr.
Creevy game me one. When I
said it was too big, he thought I
meant the baby, but my mid
wife understood and gave me a
smaller piece of ice.
"Women who go only to
male doctors can't appreciate
the gentleness and under
standing of a midwife. Mid
wives have it over men in mak
ing delivery comfortable,"
Robinson said.
'Totally appropriate'
While Stanford does not
allow midwives in the delivery
room, a third person besides
the doctor and the mother may
attend the delivery.
"Midwifery is a totally ap
propriate and sophisticated
arm of the profession," Creevy
said. He said he sees no reason
why a midwife can 't be as effec
tive as a physician.
While "any complication of a
serious nature requires a doc
tor," the capability of a mid

wife depends largely on the
culture. "I've seen Guatemalan
midwives perform caesarean
sections, but in our culture a
doctor may be called in the
case of a breech birth," Creevy
said.
Nurse midwives must go
through two to three years of
nursing training and an addi
tional year of midwife training.
"But midwifery is not a nurs
ing skill," claims nurse midwife

JuneWhitson. "Nursingcomes
in sickness — midwifery comes
in health."
Discussing the differences
between midwifery and
obstetrics, Palmer explained,
"It's mostly a matter of
philosophy. Midwives view
birth as a totally natural event,
while doctors look at birth as a
pathological rather than a
normal occurrence
Heinrichs expressed a diffe

rent view. "I've dedicated my
life and career to the protec
tion of the next generation,
and it's both aggravating and
maddening to witness ignor
ance shooting down this pro
cess. It's interesting that illegal
lay midwifery is condoned
when human lives are jeopar
dized or even worse. With a
midwife, the risksof damage to
the child go unrecognized."
Dr. Creevy analyzes doctors

opposed to midwifery, claim
ing, "There is more than the
welfare of mother and child in
the minds of some doctors.
Some doctors hold an unspo
ken concern about midwifery
as competition."
The com lusion? Ann Robin
son who has experienced
both sides of the coin, sum
med it up best when she said,
Public education needs to be
done in this area."
