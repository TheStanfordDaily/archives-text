# Prof kids thrive in academia-land

### Paulette Truman 
Ten-year-old Michael Robinson already knows that he wants to
study at Stanford when he grows up because places like Harvard
"just don't sound right.'' Michael, son of Linguistics Prof. Orrin
Robinson, is one of many "faculty brats" on campus.
Children born to professors are usually so Stanford-oriented
that being accepted to the school is not the big thing other
students make it out to be.
"My going to Stanford was only natural. I didn't think twice
about it," said Julie Bonini, daughter of Business School Assoc.
Prof. Charles Bonini.
Family affair
For William and Carolyn Manning, children of Electrical En
gineering Prof. Larry Manning, the reason for attending Stantord
was strongly influenced by the fact that practically all their rela
tives — aunts, uncles, a grandfather (a Stanford professor of
mathematics for 45 years), and the father — studied here.
Besides being "natural" to sudy here, faculty children choose
Stanford over other universities because of the financial discount
on tuition, the convenient location or because of family tradition.
A main reason for Stephen Spitz' decision to enroll at Stantord
was because "the financial difference between Stanford and a
comparable institution was very great."
Exposure
To Elizabeth kays, whose father is the dean of engineering, not
having to worry about paying the bill for tuition every quarter, is a
big advantage. "I don't feel that my parents have put an invest
ment in me by sending me to Stanford and as su h I don't have to
perform for them," she said.
"One of the main advantages of being a faculty kid is being
exposed to some of the professors my parents know. When I
came to Stanford, I wasn't in awe of them like other students,"
she added.
"I used to go to more frat parties and drink a lot of beer when I
was in the sixth grade than I do now," said Claire Duignan, whose
father is Prof. Peter Duignan, Afraican and Middle East curator at
the Hoover Institution. "I used to love flirting with those big
football players, too," she added.
Living close to home carries some benefits, according to |ohn
Lamb, son of a Stanford Medical Center doctor. "I don't like to go
home a lot, but I like being close in case of an emergency." For
Lamb, it is also convenient because "I can still go home to get my
laundry done."
Pressure
There are also some disadvantages that counter the advantages
for faculty children here.
"Everyone thinks you got accepted because of your dad. It puts
added pressure on a faculty brat because he has to show people

that he wasn't accepted to Stanford just because his parents are
on the faculty," Lamb said.
It's possible to be labeled — in my case, as Professor Spitz'
kid. Before they know me, people start off seeing some kind of
label on me rather than a blank. But nobody hates me because
they got a 'C' in Modern Europe," Spitz said.
Becki Bridges, whose dad is a professor of education, however,
teels that her being a faculty brat probably did help her in being
accepted to Stanford. "Sometimes I feel like the people that are
here got here on their own merit totally and I know that I had a
little extra pull since my father's a professor. I sometimes wonder
it my dad weren't a professor if I still would have gotten in," she
said.

After two years of living at Lagunita Court with his parents who
are resident fellows, Michael Robinson said, "I don't really like
going to the food service all that much. The choices aren't very
good — meat loaf and red snapper I don't like." To his eight
year-old brother, Brian, "living so far away from people our age to
play with," is a drawback to growing up as a faculty brat.
Being so close to home can be hard. "Since my parents' house
is right on campus, they don't see any need for me to live in a
dorm after the first year since it's virtually free to live at home,"
Bridges said.
"It would be hard after having so much freedom freshman year
to go back home and live by iny parents' rules," she said.
isays feels living so close to home did not seem to hinder her
feelings of independence. "It didn't seem to make as much
difference as I thought it would be being a faculty kid, because
after all, being independent trom home is a state of mind, right?"

"I used to go to more frat parties and drink a lot of beer when I

Living close to home carries some benefits, according to |ohn
Lamb, son of a Stanford Medical Center doctor. "I don't like to go
home a lot, but I like being close in case of an emergency." For
Lamb, it is also convenient because "I can still go home to get my
laundry done."
Pressure
There are also some disadvantages that counter the advantages
for faculty children here.
"Everyone thinks you got accepted because of your dad. It puts
added pressure on a faculty brat because he has to show people

that he wasn't accepted to Stanford just because his parents are
on the faculty," Lamb said.
It's possible to be labeled — in my case, as Professor Spitz'
kid. Before they know me, people start off seeing some kind of
label on me rather than a blank. But nobody hates me because
they got a 'C' in Modern Europe," Spitz said.
Becki Bridges, whose dad is a professor of education, however,
teels that her being a faculty brat probably did help her in being
accepted to Stanford. "Sometimes I feel like the people that are
here got here on their own merit totally and I know that I had a
little extra pull since my father's a professor. I sometimes wonder
it my dad weren't a professor if I still would have gotten in," she
said.

After two years of living at Lagunita Court with his parents who

good — meat loaf and red snapper I don't like." To his eight
year-old brother, Brian, "living so far away from people our age to
play with," is a drawback to growing up as a faculty brat.
Being so close to home can be hard. "Since my parents' house
is right on campus, they don't see any need for me to live in a

Family affair
For William and Carolyn Manning, children of Electrical En
gineering Prof. Larry Manning, the reason for attending Stantord
was strongly influenced by the fact that practically all their rela
tives — aunts, uncles, a grandfather (a Stanford professor of
mathematics for 45 years), and the father — studied here.
Besides being "natural" to sudy here, faculty children choose
Stanford over other universities because of the financial discount
on tuition, the convenient location or because of family tradition.
A main reason for Stephen Spitz' decision to enroll at Stantord
was because "the financial difference between Stanford and a
