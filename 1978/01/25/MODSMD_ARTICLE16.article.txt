Radioactivity feared from spy satellite
Yellowknife, Northwest Territories — A nuclear-powered
Soviet spy satellite fell from orbit into the atmosphere above
this remote region of northwest Canada yesterday, streaking
vividly and soundlessly across the pre-dawn sky and raising
some tears of radioactive contamination.
Canadian and U.S. officials said there was probably no seri
ous danger.
A U.S. U-2 reconnaisance plane and a military Boeing 707
carrying radiation detectors circled "the estimated impact
area" last night, but had not detected any radiation, said Adm.
R.H. Falls, chief of the Canadian defense staff.
Falls said the center of the search area was about 34 miles east
of the eastern tip of Great Slave Lake and about 200 miles east of
Yellowknife, which is 850 miles north of the U.S. border.
In Moscow, the official Soviet news agency said the Cosmos
954 satellite had been designed to self-destruct in the event of
such a fall. It has "ceased to exist," the agency said.
Canadian Defense Minister Barney Danson said he was "98
percent or more" certain the satellite, carrying 100 pounds of
highly radioactive enriched uranium 235, had burnec. .Ip in the
atmosphere.
Carter reshapes intelligence groups
Washington — President Jimmy Carter ordered a major reor
ganization of the U.S. intelligence community yesterday, term
ing his action a "major step forward" in safeguarding both the
national interest and civil liberties.
Carter signed at a White House ceremony a bulky executive
order designed not only to streamline the intelligence setup
but also to put strict new curbs on covert activities that drew fire
from congressional investigators. The restrictions include an
outright ban on attempted political assassinations.
The president took the occasion to express his "sincere and
complete confidence" in Adm. Stansfield Turner, an Annapolis
classmate he named as director of the Central Intelligence
Agency.
Turner emerges from the reorganization with enhanced au
thority, particularly over the preparation of budgets not only
for CIA but also for the Pentagon's National Security Agency
and Defense Intelligence Agency. However, administration of
ficials ac knowledged Turner did not get all the expanded pow
ers he sought.
Israel blamed for peace talk cut-off
Cairo, Egypt — Most Egyptians blame Israel rather than Anwar

Sadat for the abrupt halt in peace negotiations and analysts say
the limping economy, rather than the Mideast crisis, continues
to be the president's chief problem at home.
"I believe Sadat can rule Egypt as long as he wants. There is
no organized opposition in Egypt and Egyptians tend to wor
ship their leader," a leading leftist politics professor said yes
terday.
"He would not be toppled by the handling of the negotia
tions with Israel but by the economy."
Sadat met with U.S. Ambassador Herman Eilts yesterday, and
Foreign Minister Mohamed Ibrahim Kamel said Egypt may re
sume peace talks if Israel sets no pre-conditions.
Cigarettes and the Pill threaten lives
Washington — Food and Drug Commissioner Donald Ken
nedy said yesterday the nation's 3 to 4 million women who
smoke cigarettes and take birth control pills should quit smok
ing or find another method of contraception.
The message is simple, Kennedy said: "If you take the pill,
don't smoke. If you do smoke while on the pill you increase
dramatically your chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke."
He added: "If you must smoke, find another method of con
traception."
Kennedy said women who both smoke and use the pill are 10
times more likely to die of a heart attack or other circulatory
disorder than women who neither smoke nor take the pill.
Kennedy, a Stanford biologist, gave the advice in announcing
his agency will require new, updated and more informative
brochures for women who purchase the pill after April 3, the
day the new regulation takes effect.
AC Transit strike may end soon
Oakland — Assemblyman Tom Bates of Oakland announced
yesterday that a "tentative settlement" was reached toward
ending the 65-day-old AC Transit strike of the system's 1850
drivers, clerks and mechanics.
Bates' report came amid accounts from both sides that it had
been quietly agreed by the union and AC Transit that the words
"tentative agreement" woulo not be used.
But management sources said a new package would be pre
sented for ratification to the union's rank-and-file. The source
said it was a tentative agreement but that language was taboo.
The strike, which started Nov. 21, left 115,000 daily riders to
find other means to travel the system's 600 square miles —
including the main commute routes between the East Bay and

San Francisco.
The union's old contract expired last June 30. A key issue in
the strike had been pension benefits.
Bates said he received his information of an agreement from
John Wesley, president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local
192.
"There has been a tentative settlement and a recommenda
tion to take it back to the membership" later this week, Bates
said.
Police ask proof of baron's capture
Paris — Police demanded yesterday that kidnappers ot Bel
gian industrialist Baron Edouard-Jean Empain deliver any of his
personal possessions "to prove they are indeed holding hin
hostage."
The message was issued following anonymous telephone
calls claiming leftist groups were responsible for the abduction
of the 40-year-old nobleman.
One caller demanded release of two imprisoned members of
the notorious Baader-Meinhof gang in what was believed to be
the first information linking the abduction to the West German
terrorists.
Two callers purporting to be from the French leftist group
Armed Nucleus for Popular Autonomy telephoned French
news agencies early yesterday and threatened to execute the
baron and "other bosses" unless three of their comrades were
released from prison.
They set a deadline of noon today.
A statement purporting to be from the French revolutionary
group, delivered later to the Paris leftist newspaper Liberation,
said it had "no link whatsoever with the individuals who kid
napped the baron."
Anonymous telephone calls also were received yesterday
night by the Paris office of Radio Luxembourg and the leftist
daily newspaper Rouge.
"We, the Armed Nucleus for Popular Autonomy, claim re
sponsibility for the kidnapping of Baron Empain. We demand
the liberation of our comrades before Wednesday noon. If not
we will kill the baron. Other bosses will follow," a caller told
Radio Luxembourg.
Today's weather
Fair today and tonight. Variable high clouds tomorrow. Mild
afternoon temperatures. Lows in the high 20s and 30s to low
40s. Highs in the mid 50s to mid 60s.
