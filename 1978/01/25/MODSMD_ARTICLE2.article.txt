# Frosh study finds split in political views
## 
### James Petrila 
Freshmen here are more likely to
he liberal than students nationally,
and in general do not consider them
selves holding "middle of the road"
political views, a new survey shows.
More than 1000 of 1500 first-year
students here participated in the sur
vey, part of a cooperative research
program conducted nationally by the
American Council on Education and
UCLA.
Nearly 95 percent of freshmen plan
to receive advanced degrees, accord
ing to the recently issued national
survey. Though over 20 percent said
they are undecided in career goals,
nearly one-fifth aspire to be physi
cians, and I} percent aim at becom
ing lawyers.
While the percentages of first-year
men and women aspiring to be doc
tors and lawyers are quite similar (20
percent and 18 percent for the
former and 14 percent and 12 percent
for the latter), twice as many men as
women want to be engineers.
Six percent of the women, as op
posed to two percent of the men,
were interested in writing or jour
nalism.
The survey also shows that
freshmen here come from a more di
verse racial background than do uni
versity freshmen nationally. Though
five percent of the freshmen class is
black, compared to six percent na
tionally, only 85 percent ot the
treshmen are white, compared to 91
percent nationwide.
Nine of 10 freshmen here expect
that they "will be satisfied with col
lege" and over 75 percent feel that
they "will find a job in (their) prefer
red field." Only two percent antici
pate transferring to another college,
while one in three expects to change
both major field and career choice
during the next four years.
Some differences between men
and women occurred in their re
sponses to "reasons noted as very
important in deciding to go to col
lege." A greater percentage of
women seem more concerned with
intangibles, such as becoming a
more cultured person (57 percent
women, 44 percent men) and learn
ing more about things (95 percent
women, 85 percent men). Over 53
percent of the men surveyed, as op
posed to 43 percent of the women,
listed "making more money."
Freshmen here are less likely to
describe their political orientation as
middle of the road" than are their
counterparts at universities nation
ally (39 percent to 53 percent). More
Stanford freshmen consider them
selves to be liberal (40 percent to 28
percent nationally) and conservative
(18 percent to 17 percent). Two per
cent of Stanford's freshmen charac
terize themselves as "far left," and
one percent claim they belong on the
"far right" of the political spectrum.
Nearly six in 10 believe that
marijuana should be legalized.
On attitudinal questions, the
greatest disparity between Stanford
men and women is in their response
to the statement "sex (is) ok if the
people like each other." Some b4
percent of male freshmen agreed,
compared with only 42 percent of
female freshmen.
Differences in opinion on "living
together before marriage" are not as
great: 57 percent of the men and 52
