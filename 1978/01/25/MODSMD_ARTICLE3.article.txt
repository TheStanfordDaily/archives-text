# The 						Food Service: a Stanford tradition
## 
### Joel Dickholtz 
Stanford has a wealth of traditions.
Among the most popular are: be
coming a Stanford man or woman
during a full moon in front of Mem
Chu, battling with Berkeley for the
Big Game Axe, and, the subject of
this story . . . complaining about the
University Food Service.
Even the Stanford Observer, the
monthly newspaper sent to alumni,
staff and parents, reported with
some incredulity that some ex
change students from Tokyo actually
liked the dorm food. The Observer
concluded that "they can't be from
Stanford."
Other than complaining and eat
ing, however, most students have lit
tle idea how the food service works,
what is involved in preparing 18,000
to 21,000 meals per day or where
their food dollar goes.
Maxine Anderson, director of food
services, explained how expenses
break down in residences managed
by the Stanford Commissary. "We
handle the food for Florence Moore,
Lagunita, Roble, Wilbur, Branner,
Stern, Durand, Ross, Hurlburt,
Grove House, Storey House and 558
Mayfield," she said. "In those
houses 42 percent of each student's
food dollar pays for the food itself, 54
percent covers labor and 24 percent
covers other costs such as utilities,
insurance and miscellaneous ex
penses."
Confronted with questions about
the dubious reputations of some re
sidences on campus — Stern, for
example — Anderson seemed puz
zled. "I don't understand how some
houses get that kind of reputation,"
she said.
"I've eaten there several times and
I've found the food to be just fine. A
place like Stern runs into a lot of
problems because of the number of
people they serve. Dishes for dinner
have to be cooked early in the day
and reheated later. There's really no
way to get around it."
She places some of the blame for
student opinion on the building it
self. "Stern is not an attractive build

ing. It doesn't create a pleasant at
mosphere. But I think the Stern staff
does a very good job under the cir
cumstances."
Commissary unknown
Something students never see is
the food commissary. "We're deal
ing here with almost $3 million a
year," explained Sterling Silver,
buyer for the commissary.
In addition to buying food in large
quantities and distributing it all over
campus, the commissary runs a meat
processing plant.
"This is a top quality operation

here," Silver said.
Silver also said no other university
food service in the nation supplies
food to its fraternities. "They buy as
much or as little as they want."
Costs to jump
Edward Scoles, director of housing
and food services, explained what
caused the 9.8 percent jump in the
cost of food next year. "Of course
part of the jump is due to inflation —
expenses are expected to rise a little
over 7.5 percent. We'll also have to
raise rates to cover for losses this
year.

"It turned out that expenses for
incidentals such as insurance and fire
and police department protection
ran about $50,000 more than we had
anticipated. When we made up the
budget we underestimated some ex
penses such as utilities and insur
ance. That will be absorbed into next
year's costs."
The food service has been plagued
with breakage in recent years. In the
period of one year, from March 1976
to March 1977 over $18,500 was spent
to replace stolen or broken china,
glassware and silverware.

caused the 9.8 percent jump in the
cost of food next year. "Of course
part of the jump is due to inflation —
expenses are expected to rise a little
over 7.5 percent. We'll also have to
raise rates to cover for losses this
year.

"It turned out that expenses for
incidentals such as insurance and fire
and police department protection
ran about $50,000 more than we had
anticipated. When we made up the
budget we underestimated some ex
penses such as utilities and insur
ance. That will be absorbed into next
year's costs."
The food service has been plagued
with breakage in recent years. In the
period of one year, from March 1976
to March 1977 over $18,500 was spent
to replace stolen or broken china,
glassware and silverware.
Stanford has a wealth of traditions.
Among the most popular are: be
coming a Stanford man or woman
during a full moon in front of Mem
Chu, battling with Berkeley for the
Big Game Axe, and, the subject of
this story . . . complaining about the
University Food Service.
Even the Stanford Observer, the
monthly newspaper sent to alumni,
staff and parents, reported with
some incredulity that some ex
change students from Tokyo actually
liked the dorm food. The Observer
concluded that "they can't be from
Stanford."
Other than complaining and eat
ing, however, most students have lit
tle idea how the food service works,
what is involved in preparing 18,000
to 21,000 meals per day or where
their food dollar goes.
Maxine Anderson, director of food
services, explained how expenses
break down in residences managed
by the Stanford Commissary. "We
handle the food for Florence Moore,
Lagunita, Roble, Wilbur, Branner,
Stern, Durand, Ross, Hurlburt,
Grove House, Storey House and 558
Mayfield," she said. "In those
houses 42 percent of each student's
food dollar pays for the food itself, 54
percent covers labor and 24 percent
covers other costs such as utilities,
insurance and miscellaneous ex
penses."
Confronted with questions about
the dubious reputations of some re
sidences on campus — Stern, for
example — Anderson seemed puz
zled. "I don't understand how some
houses get that kind of reputation,"
she said.
"I've eaten there several times and
I've found the food to be just fine. A
place like Stern runs into a lot of
problems because of the number of
people they serve. Dishes for dinner
have to be cooked early in the day
and reheated later. There's really no
way to get around it."
She places some of the blame for
student opinion on the building it
self. "Stern is not an attractive build

ing. It doesn't create a pleasant at
mosphere. But I think the Stern staff
does a very good job under the cir
cumstances."
Commissary unknown
Something students never see is
the food commissary. "We're deal
ing here with almost $3 million a
year," explained Sterling Silver,
buyer for the commissary.
In addition to buying food in large
quantities and distributing it all over
campus, the commissary runs a meat
processing plant.
"This is a top quality operation

here," Silver said.
Silver also said no other university
food service in the nation supplies
food to its fraternities. "They buy as
much or as little as they want."
Costs to jump
Edward Scoles, director of housing
and food services, explained what
caused the 9.8 percent jump in the
