### Sara Lessley 
A student informational meeting
concerning investment responsibil
ity held last night resulted in "good
suggestions and questions" despite
a "disappointing" audience turnout,
according to ASSU Co-president
Anne FHenkels.
The ASSU-sponsored meeting was
designed to explain why students
were not nominated to the Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility,
according to Henkels.
About 45 people attended the
meeting in Cubberley.
Henkels said she believes the low
turnout demonstrates that "students
don't feel committees are that impor
tant to individuals and that students
also feel that investment responsibil
ity is not their concern."
But Henkels added the "people
here are really concerned, and the
questions, statements and sugges
tions are really good."

Responsibility explained recent ac
tions taken by their groups. Ques
tions and statements from the audi
ence followed.
Henkels said students should
question whether the language of
trustee revisions in the ad hoc com
mittee's report on investment re
sponsibility is "strong assurance that
the trustees have an obligation to be
socially responsible."
"It's important that the trustees
come to campus and enunciate what
that language means," said ad hoc
committee member Ellen Byrne. "It's
the trustees' turn now."
Answer charges
ASSU Senate Chairperson Fred
Grethel said he wanted to answer
charges that ASSU support of Norn
Com refusal to nominate students
only represented the viewpoint of a
few students, and that the senate's
resolution was not "weil-thought
out."
Grethel added that the Nom Com
itself represents many student view
points, and its refusal to nominate
was debated in the senate.
Chuck Smith, a member of the au
dience, commented that the meeting
was "helpful, it gave me a better
overall picture of the problem."
'The way to go'
He added he was concerned with
investment responsibility, but he
was "not sure divestment was the
way to go."
Smith said trustee participation
would have made the meeting "more
interesting."
Another audience member, Heidi
Schellman, asserted that it's "very
hard to get trustees or administration
to voice opinion."
Henkels said the senate and Nom
Com members plan to solicit student
opinion by going to dorms for small
group discussion on investment re
sponsibility.
