# Lively Arts plans intensive campaign
## 
### 
A visit by playwright Edward Albee and an intensive season subscrip
tion campaign will highlight next year's Lively Arts program, according
to Vicki Holt, director of the Office of Public Events.
Albee will spend two days here, Holt said last night on KZSU's
"Campus Conference." He will lecture on playwriting and will direct
productions of his "The Sandbox" and"The American Dream."
The Lively Arts will start a season-subscription system to give the
public the opportunity to hold guaranteed seats throughout the series,
she said.
Even without subscriptions, the Lively Arts has been averaging 20,000
to 22,000 spectators a season, 60 percent of them from the Stanford
community. Holt said the program is rated one of the nation's 10 best.
In addition to its public performances, the Public Events office spon
sors community outreach and artist-in-residence programs which allow
performer and student/spectator to interact, Holt said. The
community-based side has been strengthened by a $12,238 grant from
the San Francisco Foundation.
Despite such financial help, Holt said the Lively Arts runs a |uggler's
battle against "astronomical" artists' fees and production costs.
She said the new federal copyright law also may create problems
since it increases royalties on campus performances of popular music.
Though attempts to fight the ruling are still on a "day-to-day" basis,
Holt said it appears that the music publishing societies advocating the
law may relent, because they would have to enforce the measure
college by college.
In her first year as public events director. Holt said she is satisfied
with the program so far but looks ahead to more involvement with
popular music (jazz, rock), live acting companies (mime and conven
tional theater) and improvements in the campus entertainment setup,
including, perhaps, a new performing arts complex.
