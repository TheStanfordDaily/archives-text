# Need to define goals
## Undergrad education in chaos 
### 
Allan Chen

When I first came to Stanford, I
expected philosophy. After all, I
thought, philosophy is what the Uni
versity is all about. The University
communicates knowledge, and
philosophy is both the foundation
and the pinnacle of knowledge. In
stead, I found requirements.
Requirements are also what a uni
versity is about. It is the accepted
procedure for insuring that we stu
dents learn something within a cohe
sive, unified framework. It also
guarantees, in theory, that students
receive exposure to a broad cross
section ot knowledge, in order that
we may receive what is quaintly
termed a well-rounded education.
These ideas are sound in principle,
but there are some legitimate ques
tions to be raised about the effec
tiveness of requirements in meeting
these goals. For the past two or more
years, undergraduate education at
Stanford has been in a state of rapid
flux, also commonly known as chaos.
Distribution requirements
changed for the incoming freshman
of the class of '80. Some departments
tightened major requirements. A
Western Civ requirement was prop
osed; teachingevaluation becamean
.ssue A great hue and cry developed
over the plight of foreign languages
instruction, and in various other
fields as well.
Some programs shut down, others
were curtailed, some new ones were
started, still others expanded. In
novative programs and related agen
cies such as the Stanford Committee
for Innovation in Research and Edu
cation continued, unsuccessfully, to
try to strengthen themselves in the
face of flagging student interest and
lower levels of funding. Pervading
this flurry of activity was a small but
fortunately vocal group of voices
wondering how all of this was, and is,
affecting undergraduate learning.
State of flux
Education must always be in a state
of flux, of course. That is the nature
ofthe beast: knowledge pushes back
the edge of night little by little, and
what new wonder we uncover must
affect both the content of knowledge
and the way in which knowledge as a
whole is perceived and taught. Vet
there also exists a threshold zone
where the changes made in teaching
practice reach the point of diminish
ing returns.
Too many changes in major and
distribution requirements plunge us

into a maelstrom of uncertainty.
Don't the instructors know what we
should know, and what we might like
to know? If we do an about face every
decade or so on distribution re
quirements, then does either way,
having or not having them, make any
difference whatsoever? Is there any
reason to learn, beyond the emi
nently practical one of getting a luc
rative job afterward?
At the very core of the question is
student and professorial motivation.
The Study of Education at Stanford
asserted that the faculty should be
free to teach what it wished, and the
students should be free to learn what
it wished. Of course, such an i
dealistic attitude, if put into practice
literally, would send undergraduate
learning into a tailspin. Distribution
and major requirements are braces
against this possibility, and so they
are necessary, along with good advis
ing. At the other extreme, too many
requirements, sometimes redundant
and sometimes just plain dead
weight, stifle the urge to explore and
dream independently.
Obligation
The University has an obligation to
provide a framework of knowledge
that establishes competence in some
field and an acquaintance with the
general modes of human thinking. It
has an equally important responsibil
ity to provide sufficient latitude for
the independent exploration of
knowledge. This means not over
burdening the student community
with excessive requirements, provid
ing for and even encouraging excur
sions, through course work and in
novative forms of learning, into
other areas of human thought. It
should guide, but not yoke its stu
dents.
The situation now does not look
promising. Every student I've ever
known has felt some lack of educa
tional direction. The expectations of
the University in the form of re
quirements and other factors are re
ally no help. Too many students have
no total picture of human know
ledge, or its interrelationships.
Distribution requirements only
serve to confuse the individual's
educational goal-forming process.
We are required to take three
courses in each of three arbitrarily
compartmentalized areas. We are
not taught the rationale behind this
structure, nor are we taught about
the cross-disciplinary character of

these required studies. We are riot
told what the faculty perceives as the
goals of education, nor are we taught
a process by which we may come to
formulate our own educational go
als.
We may soon be saddled by a Wes
ten Civ requirement which, in its
very narrowness and broadness, is
self-defeating. It is broad because it
is a diffuse, mammoth culture that
pervades our lives, and a worldview
whose underlying principles and
deepest routes are too extensive to
cover in a brief sequence of courses.
Despite its broadness, it is narrow
because other cultures have de
veloped equally valid, equally useful
philosophies of universe and soci
ety.
What should we students be learn
ing, what do we want to learn, and
how do we want to learn it? What
should professors teach, what do
they wish to teach and how should
they teach it? Perhaps we should take
a long, hard look at these questions
before we take any more steps like
that of the Western Civ requirement.
