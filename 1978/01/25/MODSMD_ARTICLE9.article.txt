# By South Africans
## Carter's efforts being recognized 
### 
William Gould

While in South Africa last summer,
I spoke with a good many people,
cutting across a fairly wide political
spectrum — black and white ranging
from banned trade unionists to gov
ernment officials. Some of the most
memorable meetings were with indi
viduals who play very different roles
in the struggle against the Vorster
government policy of repression.
One was Dr. Nthato Motlana who
is now in detention. He has been the
leader of the Soweto Ten, which at
tempted unsuccessfully to negotiate
with the Nationalist government on
effective local government for the
black residents of Soweto. Another
was Chief Catsha Butelezi, the con
troversial leader of five million Zulu
peoples, as well as the main force in
its "cultural" organization, Inkatha,
the only remaining voice of black
opposition which is not presently
banned.
And perhaps most important of all
was a discussion that I had with Mrs.
Winnie Mandela, wife of African Na
tional Congress leader Nelson Man
dela, who is imprisoned for life on
Robben Island. Mrs. Mandela had
become a civil rights leader in her
own right in Soweto before being
banned in May of this year. Despite
the variety of views and per
sonalities, there was one common
thread to the remarks — a recogni
tion of the critical role that America
plays in effectuating change in South
Africa and a hopefulness about the
intentions of the Carter administra
tion in this effort.
Soon after I lunched with Motlana
in late August, I recall telling an
American friend in lohannesburg
how fortunate South Africa was to
have such a moderate and sensible
black leader in a society where every
black is subjected to daily indignity.
He spent much time speaking to me
of the Soweto student boycott
against Bantu education, a system
which provides blacks with one
sixteenth the financial aid given to
whites and deliberately attempts to
cripple them by teaching a tribal ver
nacular which is ill-suited to the
modern industrial centers where En
glish is the prerequisite. Motlana did
not speak of black majority rule —

although I have no doubt that he
supports this idea, but rather fo
cused on local government as well as
education.
Butelezi — so fiercely criticized by
the Black Consciousness Movement,
of which Steve Biko was a leader,
primarily because he accepted lead
ership in the Kwazulu government,
the "homeland" for Zulus in South
Africa — told me that he would
"never" accept independence under
the government's separate de
velopment policy as others have
done. He told me that he could not
support disinvestment or other
economic sanctions because he has a
responsibility for employment op
portunities for his people.
But Butelezi strongly advocated
other forms of pressure. Now he
alone retains a platform on which to
speak out to South African blacks.
Said Butelezi of the government's
October bannings, "It is an admis
sion that the government of this
country is by jackboot as far as blacks
are concerned."
My meeting with Mrs. Mandela
dramatized more than all else the
position of blacks who dare protest
government policy. Mrs. Mandela is
under house arrest in Brandfort,
banished to this remote town deep in
the flat and uninteresting coun
tryside of the Orange Free State, the
heartland of Africanerdom, where
the ruling Nationalist Party is
strongest. She lives undercurfew in a

black township where no one speaks
her languages i.e., English and
Xosha.
I drove out to Brandfort alone in a
rented car in the early afternoon of
Aug. 17, and arrived just on time for
our 2 p.m. meeting. I did not know
what to expect that day in a country
where government surveillance is
commonplace, and in a part,of the
nation where English — particularly
with an American accent — can at
tract attention. I stood waitingon the
sidewalk of this two-horse town,
which seemed out of wild west
movie — but there was no Mrs. Man
dela to meet me.
However, the Security Branch of
the South African police were there
— equipped with earphones, which I
am advised can monitor any conver
sation within half a mile. A friendly
lewish woman, whose family had
come to Brandfort from Lithuania in
1958, helped me in my search for
Mrs. Mandela, as the police sat in
their car across the street. "Are you a
Carter man?" she said. "Yes," I re
sponded. "Well, he doesn't under
stand our situation here." And later,
when I thanked her foi her help, she
said, "I hope that you will tell Ameri
cans that we are civilized here in
South Africa."
An hour or so later, I found Mrs.
Mandela. She had received a mes
sage stating that our meeting had
been postponed. Both of us sus
pected that the Security Branch,

whose officers sat behind us in a
parked car during our entire meet
ing, were responsible.
For a woman who is in such isola
tion — she had been jailed fre
quently, and like Motlana, was im
prisoned last year after Soweto, and
is now being charged with and tried
for violations of her banning orders
— she was in remarkably good
spirits. She told me that the Af
ricaaner did not believe that blacks
"had evolved" and that a "clash"
over black-white inequities was
made more likely by the degradation
of Soweto and similar black town
ships throughout the country, whose
tiny homes are now the living quar
ters for blacks of any economic sta
tion.
These three individuals, Motlana,
Butelezi, and Mandela, differ in
temperament and appoaches. But
they seem in agreement on one
point, i.e., that the Carter administ
ration had provided some measure
of confidence to South African
blacks which was not there previ
ously. "Does Carter really mean it?"
said Mrs. Mandela hopefully. "He
must keep the pressure up," said
Butelezi of the Carter administra
tion s call for full political participa
tion. And I shall never forget Motla
na's last comment as we parted,
"You Americans must pick the win
ners for a change."

black residents of Soweto. Another
was Chief Catsha Butelezi, the con
troversial leader of five million Zulu
peoples, as well as the main force in
its "cultural" organization, Inkatha,
the only remaining voice of black
opposition which is not presently
banned.
And perhaps most important of all
was a discussion that I had with Mrs.
Winnie Mandela, wife of African Na
tional Congress leader Nelson Man
dela, who is imprisoned for life on
Robben Island. Mrs. Mandela had
become a civil rights leader in her
own right in Soweto before being
banned in May of this year. Despite
the variety of views and per
sonalities, there was one common
thread to the remarks — a recogni
tion of the critical role that America
plays in effectuating change in South
Africa and a hopefulness about the
intentions of the Carter administra
tion in this effort.
Soon after I lunched with Motlana
in late August, I recall telling an
American friend in lohannesburg
how fortunate South Africa was to
have such a moderate and sensible
black leader in a society where every
black is subjected to daily indignity.
He spent much time speaking to me
of the Soweto student boycott
against Bantu education, a system
which provides blacks with one
sixteenth the financial aid given to
whites and deliberately attempts to
cripple them by teaching a tribal ver
nacular which is ill-suited to the
modern industrial centers where En
glish is the prerequisite. Motlana did
not speak of black majority rule —

although I have no doubt that he
supports this idea, but rather fo
cused on local government as well as
education.
Butelezi — so fiercely criticized by
the Black Consciousness Movement,
of which Steve Biko was a leader,
primarily because he accepted lead
ership in the Kwazulu government,
the "homeland" for Zulus in South
Africa — told me that he would
"never" accept independence under
the government's separate de
velopment policy as others have
done. He told me that he could not
support disinvestment or other
economic sanctions because he has a
responsibility for employment op
portunities for his people.
But Butelezi strongly advocated
other forms of pressure. Now he
alone retains a platform on which to
speak out to South African blacks.
Said Butelezi of the government's
October bannings, "It is an admis
sion that the government of this
country is by jackboot as far as blacks
are concerned."
My meeting with Mrs. Mandela
dramatized more than all else the
position of blacks who dare protest
government policy. Mrs. Mandela is
under house arrest in Brandfort,
banished to this remote town deep in
the flat and uninteresting coun
tryside of the Orange Free State, the
heartland of Africanerdom, where
the ruling Nationalist Party is
strongest. She lives undercurfew in a

black township where no one speaks
her languages i.e., English and
Xosha.
I drove out to Brandfort alone in a
rented car in the early afternoon of
Aug. 17, and arrived just on time for
our 2 p.m. meeting. I did not know
what to expect that day in a country
where government surveillance is
commonplace, and in a part,of the
nation where English — particularly
with an American accent — can at
tract attention. I stood waitingon the
sidewalk of this two-horse town,
which seemed out of wild west
movie — but there was no Mrs. Man
dela to meet me.
However, the Security Branch of
the South African police were there
— equipped with earphones, which I
am advised can monitor any conver
sation within half a mile. A friendly
lewish woman, whose family had
come to Brandfort from Lithuania in
1958, helped me in my search for
Mrs. Mandela, as the police sat in
their car across the street. "Are you a
Carter man?" she said. "Yes," I re
sponded. "Well, he doesn't under
stand our situation here." And later,
when I thanked her foi her help, she
said, "I hope that you will tell Ameri
cans that we are civilized here in
South Africa."
An hour or so later, I found Mrs.
Mandela. She had received a mes
sage stating that our meeting had
been postponed. Both of us sus
pected that the Security Branch,

whose officers sat behind us in a
parked car during our entire meet
ing, were responsible.
For a woman who is in such isola
tion — she had been jailed fre
quently, and like Motlana, was im
prisoned last year after Soweto, and
is now being charged with and tried
for violations of her banning orders
— she was in remarkably good
spirits. She told me that the Af
ricaaner did not believe that blacks
"had evolved" and that a "clash"
over black-white inequities was
made more likely by the degradation
of Soweto and similar black town
ships throughout the country, whose
tiny homes are now the living quar
ters for blacks of any economic sta
tion.
These three individuals, Motlana,
Butelezi, and Mandela, differ in
temperament and appoaches. But
they seem in agreement on one
point, i.e., that the Carter administ
ration had provided some measure
of confidence to South African
blacks which was not there previ
ously. "Does Carter really mean it?"
said Mrs. Mandela hopefully. "He
must keep the pressure up," said
Butelezi of the Carter administra
tion s call for full political participa
tion. And I shall never forget Motla
na's last comment as we parted,
"You Americans must pick the win
ners for a change."

While in South Africa last summer,
I spoke with a good many people,
cutting across a fairly wide political
spectrum — black and white ranging
from banned trade unionists to gov

the variety of views and per
sonalities, there was one common
thread to the remarks — a recogni
tion of the critical role that America
plays in effectuating change in South
Africa and a hopefulness about the
intentions of the Carter administra
tion in this effort.
Soon after I lunched with Motlana
in late August, I recall telling an
American friend in lohannesburg
how fortunate South Africa was to
have such a moderate and sensible
black leader in a society where every
black is subjected to daily indignity.
He spent much time speaking to me
of the Soweto student boycott
against Bantu education, a system
which provides blacks with one
sixteenth the financial aid given to
whites and deliberately attempts to
cripple them by teaching a tribal ver
nacular which is ill-suited to the
modern industrial centers where En
glish is the prerequisite. Motlana did
not speak of black majority rule —

although I have no doubt that he
supports this idea, but rather fo
cused on local government as well as
education.
Butelezi — so fiercely criticized by
the Black Consciousness Movement,
of which Steve Biko was a leader,
primarily because he accepted lead
ership in the Kwazulu government,
the "homeland" for Zulus in South
Africa — told me that he would
"never" accept independence under
the government's separate de
velopment policy as others have
done. He told me that he could not
support disinvestment or other
economic sanctions because he has a
responsibility for employment op
portunities for his people.
But Butelezi strongly advocated
other forms of pressure. Now he
alone retains a platform on which to
speak out to South African blacks.
Said Butelezi of the government's
October bannings, "It is an admis
sion that the government of this
country is by jackboot as far as blacks
are concerned."
My meeting with Mrs. Mandela
dramatized more than all else the
position of blacks who dare protest
government policy. Mrs. Mandela is
under house arrest in Brandfort,
banished to this remote town deep in
the flat and uninteresting coun
tryside of the Orange Free State, the
heartland of Africanerdom, where
the ruling Nationalist Party is
strongest. She lives undercurfew in a

black township where no one speaks
her languages i.e., English and
Xosha.
I drove out to Brandfort alone in a
rented car in the early afternoon of
Aug. 17, and arrived just on time for
our 2 p.m. meeting. I did not know
what to expect that day in a country
where government surveillance is
commonplace, and in a part,of the
nation where English — particularly
with an American accent — can at
tract attention. I stood waitingon the
sidewalk of this two-horse town,
which seemed out of wild west
movie — but there was no Mrs. Man
dela to meet me.
However, the Security Branch of
the South African police were there
— equipped with earphones, which I
am advised can monitor any conver
sation within half a mile. A friendly
lewish woman, whose family had
come to Brandfort from Lithuania in
1958, helped me in my search for
Mrs. Mandela, as the police sat in
their car across the street. "Are you a
Carter man?" she said. "Yes," I re
sponded. "Well, he doesn't under
stand our situation here." And later,
when I thanked her foi her help, she
said, "I hope that you will tell Ameri
cans that we are civilized here in
South Africa."
An hour or so later, I found Mrs.
Mandela. She had received a mes
sage stating that our meeting had
been postponed. Both of us sus
pected that the Security Branch,

whose officers sat behind us in a
parked car during our entire meet
ing, were responsible.
For a woman who is in such isola
tion — she had been jailed fre
quently, and like Motlana, was im
prisoned last year after Soweto, and
is now being charged with and tried
for violations of her banning orders
— she was in remarkably good
spirits. She told me that the Af
ricaaner did not believe that blacks
"had evolved" and that a "clash"
over black-white inequities was
made more likely by the degradation
of Soweto and similar black town
ships throughout the country, whose
tiny homes are now the living quar
ters for blacks of any economic sta
tion.
These three individuals, Motlana,
Butelezi, and Mandela, differ in
temperament and appoaches. But
they seem in agreement on one
point, i.e., that the Carter administ
ration had provided some measure
of confidence to South African
blacks which was not there previ
ously. "Does Carter really mean it?"
said Mrs. Mandela hopefully. "He
must keep the pressure up," said
Butelezi of the Carter administra
tion s call for full political participa
tion. And I shall never forget Motla
na's last comment as we parted,
"You Americans must pick the win
ners for a change."

While in South Africa last summer,
I spoke with a good many people,
cutting across a fairly wide political
spectrum — black and white ranging
from banned trade unionists to gov
ernment officials. Some of the most
memorable meetings were with indi
viduals who play very different roles
in the struggle against the Vorster
government policy of repression.
One was Dr. Nthato Motlana who
is now in detention. He has been the
leader of the Soweto Ten, which at
tempted unsuccessfully to negotiate
with the Nationalist government on
effective local government for the
black residents of Soweto. Another
was Chief Catsha Butelezi, the con
troversial leader of five million Zulu
peoples, as well as the main force in
its "cultural" organization, Inkatha,
the only remaining voice of black
opposition which is not presently
banned.
And perhaps most important of all
was a discussion that I had with Mrs.
Winnie Mandela, wife of African Na
tional Congress leader Nelson Man
dela, who is imprisoned for life on
Robben Island. Mrs. Mandela had
become a civil rights leader in her
own right in Soweto before being
banned in May of this year. Despite
the variety of views and per
sonalities, there was one common
thread to the remarks — a recogni
tion of the critical role that America
plays in effectuating change in South
