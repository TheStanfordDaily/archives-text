# The 						student athlete stereotype

lames Thurber's fictional lineman
Bolenciecwcz, the quintessential
dumb jock, is a stereotype present in
virtually every mode of literature,
from Shakespeare to the Sunday
comics. It is also a label that is often
applied to a strata of a university's
population with as much reckless
abandon as the catchy collegiate
tags, "red-hot" and "nerd."
"Unfortunately., the student
athlete often gets stereotyped," Fred
Hargadon, dean of admissions said.
"Some people feel he must have
been admitted by a preference, be
cause of his superior athletic ability."
Hargadon, however, feels that Stan
ford, and other schools such as Har
vard and Yale defy this stereotype.
A potential Stanford athlete goes
through the same admission process
as every other applicant. "Basically,

there are two criteria we use when
evaluating an applicant; academic
ability and energy level," said Harga
don. "We do however ask the Music,
Art and Athletic departments to rate
applicants skilled in their areas so we
can weigh the students' talents more
accurately. This office makes the
final admission decision — some of
the very best high school athletes
won't be admitted here," Hargadon
stated. "Unfortunately, we end up
playing against them later."
175 scholarships
The Stanford University Athletic
Department awards 175 full athletic
scholarships to student-athletes ad
missible to the University. However,
more students than that number are
receiving aid from the department
every year because the scholarships
are often div:ded between two or
more athletes. Currently there are
146 scholarships for men, and 29 for
women, totalling $939,000.
The number of athletic scholar
ships awarded here is considerably
lower than the number allowed by

the National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation (NCAA) because the athle
tic grant-in-aids program is funded
solely by gifts to the department, and
not subsidized by the Athletic De
partment or the University.
"We just can't afford to give athle
tic scholarships to students who
can't make it here academically,"
Hargadon explained. "We have li
mited resources in that area."
Alabama head football coach Bear
Bryant has some interesting things to
say about the collegiate career of the
student-athlete: "I used to go along
with the idea that football players
were 'student-athletes' which is what
the NCAA calls them. Meaning a stu
dent first, an athlete second. We
were kidding ourselves, trying to
make it more palatable to the
academic ians. We don't have to say
that and we shouldn't."
All kinds
Hargadon challenged Bryant's
stance, stating that there are those
individuals who can excel at both ath
letics and academics. "Granted,

there are exceptional athletes who
are marginal students at Stanford,
but there are also non-athletes here
who are marginal students."
Since 1949 the Department of Ath
letics has analyzed the graduation
records of Stanford's male athletes.
Traditionally, the athletes have al
ways graduated at a higher rate than
the rest of the male student body.
James Michener, in his book,
"Sports in America," made the fol
lowing observation: "Stanford Uni
versity which is rather hard to get
into and even harder to get out of
with a degree, made a study of its
athletes who played during the
academic year 1969-70 and found that
taking 223 young men who partici
pated in the five major sports —
baseball, basketball, football,
swimming and track — 88.3 percent
graduated, which is a remarkable
achievement, especially since only
82.5 percent of the total student body
did so. (Of the 14 basketball players,
all graduated; of the 61 football

colleges and universities. The male athletes here traditionally are graduated at a

players, 56 did, with one likely to do
so later.)"
The Department's most recent
study focused on the highly re
cruited male athletes who signed let
ters of intent to Stanford or received
scholarships, and who entered in
1972. The study also included junior
college transfers who began junior
college in 1972 but entered Stanford
later. They determined how many of
these athletes were graduated at the
end of five years and compared their
graduation rates with other males
who entered in 1972. Ninety-three
percent of the intercollegiate
athletes graduated, including 93 per
cent of all football players.
In addition, all minority student
athletes were graduated. The gradu
ation rate of the rest of the male stu
dent body within five years was 86.4

percent.
The study also investigated the
academic range of athletes and non
athletes who matriculated in 1972
and were graduated by 1977, and
concluded that the athletes involved
themselves in the same range of
majors as their peers.
"These studies should 'correct'
anyone who believes that athletic
programs, at least at Stanford, are
not being conducted with a rep
resentative sample of the student
body," stated Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz.
The Department will continue
studies of this nature, and will now
be including a separate survey for
women athletes. Also in the planning
stages is a study that will focus on the
post-graduate career activities of
former Stanford athletes.

The Department's most recent
study focused on the highly re
cruited male athletes who signed let
ters of intent to Stanford or received
scholarships, and who entered in
1972. The study also included junior
college transfers who began junior
college in 1972 but entered Stanford
later. They determined how many of
these athletes were graduated at the
end of five years and compared their
graduation rates with other males
who entered in 1972. Ninety-three
percent of the intercollegiate
athletes graduated, including 93 per
cent of all football players.
In addition, all minority student
athletes were graduated. The gradu
ation rate of the rest of the male stu

percent.
The study also investigated the
academic range of athletes and non
athletes who matriculated in 1972
and were graduated by 1977, and
concluded that the athletes involved
themselves in the same range of
majors as their peers.
"These studies should 'correct'
anyone who believes that athletic
programs, at least at Stanford, are
not being conducted with a rep

be including a separate survey for
women athletes. Also in the planning
stages is a study that will focus on the
post-graduate career activities of
former Stanford athletes.

175 scholarships
The Stanford University Athletic
Department awards 175 full athletic
scholarships to student-athletes ad
missible to the University. However,
more students than that number are
receiving aid from the department
every year because the scholarships
are often div:ded between two or
more athletes. Currently there are
146 scholarships for men, and 29 for
women, totalling $939,000.
The number of athletic scholar
ships awarded here is considerably
lower than the number allowed by

the National Collegiate Athletic As

solely by gifts to the department, and
not subsidized by the Athletic De

175 scholarships
The Stanford University Athletic
Department awards 175 full athletic
scholarships to student-athletes ad
missible to the University. However,
more students than that number are
receiving aid from the department
every year because the scholarships
are often div:ded between two or
more athletes. Currently there are
146 scholarships for men, and 29 for
women, totalling $939,000.
The number of athletic scholar
ships awarded here is considerably
lower than the number allowed by

the National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation (NCAA) because the athle
tic grant-in-aids program is funded
solely by gifts to the department, and
not subsidized by the Athletic De
partment or the University.
"We just can't afford to give athle
tic scholarships to students who
can't make it here academically,"
Hargadon explained. "We have li
mited resources in that area."
Alabama head football coach Bear
Bryant has some interesting things to
say about the collegiate career of the
student-athlete: "I used to go along
with the idea that football players
were 'student-athletes' which is what
the NCAA calls them. Meaning a stu
dent first, an athlete second. We
were kidding ourselves, trying to
make it more palatable to the
academic ians. We don't have to say
that and we shouldn't."
All kinds
Hargadon challenged Bryant's
stance, stating that there are those
individuals who can excel at both ath
letics and academics. "Granted,

there are exceptional athletes who
are marginal students at Stanford,
but there are also non-athletes here
who are marginal students."
Since 1949 the Department of Ath
letics has analyzed the graduation
records of Stanford's male athletes.
Traditionally, the athletes have al
ways graduated at a higher rate than
the rest of the male student body.
James Michener, in his book,
"Sports in America," made the fol
lowing observation: "Stanford Uni
versity which is rather hard to get
into and even harder to get out of
with a degree, made a study of its
athletes who played during the
academic year 1969-70 and found that
taking 223 young men who partici
pated in the five major sports —
baseball, basketball, football,
swimming and track — 88.3 percent
graduated, which is a remarkable
achievement, especially since only
82.5 percent of the total student body
did so. (Of the 14 basketball players,
all graduated; of the 61 football

players, 56 did, with one likely to do
so later.)"
The Department's most recent
study focused on the highly re
cruited male athletes who signed let
ters of intent to Stanford or received
scholarships, and who entered in
1972. The study also included junior
college transfers who began junior
college in 1972 but entered Stanford
later. They determined how many of
these athletes were graduated at the
end of five years and compared their
graduation rates with other males
who entered in 1972. Ninety-three
percent of the intercollegiate
athletes graduated, including 93 per
cent of all football players.
In addition, all minority student
athletes were graduated. The gradu
ation rate of the rest of the male stu
dent body within five years was 86.4

percent.
The study also investigated the
academic range of athletes and non
athletes who matriculated in 1972
and were graduated by 1977, and
concluded that the athletes involved
themselves in the same range of
majors as their peers.
"These studies should 'correct'
anyone who believes that athletic
programs, at least at Stanford, are
not being conducted with a rep
resentative sample of the student
body," stated Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz.
The Department will continue
studies of this nature, and will now
be including a separate survey for
women athletes. Also in the planning
stages is a study that will focus on the
post-graduate career activities of
former Stanford athletes.

with his studies, a very difficult mat

than an ox, he was not any smarter."
lames Thurber's fictional lineman
Bolenciecwcz, the quintessential
dumb jock, is a stereotype present in
virtually every mode of literature,
from Shakespeare to the Sunday
comics. It is also a label that is often
applied to a strata of a university's
population with as much reckless
abandon as the catchy collegiate
tags, "red-hot" and "nerd."
"Unfortunately., the student
athlete often gets stereotyped," Fred
Hargadon, dean of admissions said.
"Some people feel he must have
been admitted by a preference, be
cause of his superior athletic ability."
Hargadon, however, feels that Stan
ford, and other schools such as Har
vard and Yale defy this stereotype.
A potential Stanford athlete goes
through the same admission process
as every other applicant. "Basically,

there are two criteria we use when
evaluating an applicant; academic
ability and energy level," said Harga
don. "We do however ask the Music,
Art and Athletic departments to rate
applicants skilled in their areas so we
can weigh the students' talents more
accurately. This office makes the
final admission decision — some of
the very best high school athletes
won't be admitted here," Hargadon
stated. "Unfortunately, we end up
playing against them later."
