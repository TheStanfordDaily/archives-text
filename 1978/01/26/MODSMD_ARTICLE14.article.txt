# 1.2 million acres set aside
## Conferees approve wilderness bill 
### 
Washington (AP) — House
and Senate conferres ap
proved a compromise bill yes
terday that would set aside 1.2
million acres in several western
states as part of the federal wil
derness preservation system.
Members of the conference
committee had been dead
locked for months over two
wilderness areas on federal
forest land in southwestern
Oregon.
They settled on adding
92,000 acres to the current
77,000-acre Kalmiopsis Wil
derness and creating another
wilderness zone of about
37,000 acres in the watershed
of the Rogue River.
Other provisions of the legis
lation would, by state, create
these wilderness areas:
— Arizona, a 56,000-acre
wilderness at Pusch Ridge in
the Coronado National Forest.
— California, a 306,000-acre
Golden Trout Wilderness in
the Inyo and Sequoia national
forests; a 21,000-acre Santa
Lucia wilderness in Los Padres
National Forest; and add
61,000 acres to the present
95,000-acre Ventana Wilder
ness in the Big Sur area.
—Colorado, a 72,000 acre
Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness
near Aspin.
—Idaho, a 206,000-acre Cos
pel Hump Wilderness.
—Montana, a 28,000-acre
Welcome Creek Wilderness.
—New Mexico, a Chama
River Canyon Wilderness of
50,000 acres, a 31,000-acre wil
derness zone at Sandia Moun

tain, and a Manzano Mountain
Wilderness of 37,000 acres.
—Utah, establish a Lone
Peak Wilderness of 29,000
acres.
In Oregon the House had
approved adding 280,000 acres
to the Kalmiopsis Wilderness,
and creating another 38,000-
acre wilderness zone in the
watershed of the Rogue River.
The Senate version of the bill
governing that part of Oregon
would have added only 82,000
acres to Kalmiopsis.
The author of the Senate
provision, Sen. Mark Hatfield
(R-Ore.), sought to keep as
much of the forest land as pos
sible open for mineral and
timber exploitation and the
jobs this would bring. He said
his proposal protected the es
sential wilderness values.
Rep. Jim Weaver, an Oregon
Democrat representing the
district which includes the
Kalmiopsis, pushed for the
larger figure, saying a larger
zone was vital to protecting the
watershed of the Illinois River,
and its salmon runs.
Conferees agreed that the
lands held out of the Kalmiop
sis would be studied further by

the Forest Service, which
would then make recommen
dations to Congress on
whether to expand wilderness
zones.
While the study is underway
the land would be withheld
from development. The Rogue
wilderness was trimmed by
1000 acres to allow a planned
timber sale to proceed in Lake
County.
Conferees had already ap
proved these other Oregon

wilderness provisions: adding
45,000 acres to the established
Three Sisters Wilderness near
the town of Bend, a Zig Zag
wilderness of 33,000 acres and
a Wenaha-Tucannon wilder
ness zone on the border with
Washington of 180,000 acres.
All development is banned
in federal wilderness zones.
Vehicles are also banned, ex
cept in emergencies.
The legislation goes back to
botn houses for final approval.
