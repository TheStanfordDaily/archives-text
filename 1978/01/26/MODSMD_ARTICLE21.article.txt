# Wertmuller & Giannini
## 
### 
Lina Wertmuller. (unexpec
tedly accompanied by the star
of most of her films, Giancarlo
Giannini) held last Saturday an
hour-long question and ans
wer session presented by the
ASSU Speakers Bureau. Prior
to the talk, the packed Mem
Aud audience had watched the
Wertmuller film, All Screwed
Up.
I talked to Wertmuller and
Giannini during a drive from
San Francisco to Stanford. The
pair made up for the language
problems and cramped condi
tions with their willingness to
discuss anything about them
selves and their movies. Lina
was without the services of her
translator (who was stuck in
the New York snow), so she re
lied on her basic understand
ing of English and on Giancar
lo's limited translating ability.
Lina is small (5 foot), but she
has the energy and spirit of
three or four people. To say the
least, she dresses with style;
she wears rings on most of her
fingers along with other
jewelry, fur-covered boots
with silk pants, and white plas
tic glasses with small slits for
lenses of blue-tinted glass.
Giannini
Giancarloisfarsimpler. Heis
almost Lina's opposite physi
cally. He is quiet, reserved,
thoughtful. There is a deep
friendship between he and
Lina that is quite evident.
They've been through a lot to
gether.
Unlike many stories in the
movie business, Lina Wertmul
ler's is a unique one. Lina is a
woman, she is political, but,
unlikely enough, she is suc
cessful — especially in this
country. The movie business is
a male-dominated, largely
nonpolitical industry; this fact
makes Lina's success all the
more remarkable. Her last film,
Seven Beauties (the story of a
man who survives — no matter
what the cost — but in the pro
cess loses his soul), was very
successful in America and led
to a contract with Warner

Brothers. She has just com
pleted her first film for the
studio, entitled The End of the
World in Our Usual Bed in a
Night Full of Rain.
Wertmuller said that there
were "many difficulties" for
her in making A Night Full of
Rain. Besides being financed
by an American studio, the film
is her first English language
film. "The script was written in
Italian and English at the same
time," she explained. Both
Lina and Giancarlo had to im
prove their English for the film;
"Giancarlo studied . . .for four
months before the beginning
of shooting.
"Another difference was the
sound, because it was directly
sound for the first time in my
life, in general, I prefer the
dubbing after. In this case we
made an English version —
only an English version — and
directly sound. After we dub in
Italian. It's different."
Making cuts?
I had heard rumors that
Warner Brothers, after seeing
the film, had asked Lina to re
edit it. She told me that after
finishing the picture on July 30,
she had gone "to Los Angeles.
I hey (the studio) see the movie
and after we speak about the
movie. They asked for some
cuts." And she did edit the
film, "not as terribly ... as
they want . . . two little cuts,
that's all."
On working with Warner
Brothers: "For me, it's okay;
not as okay for the studio.
Maybe they are not used to
working like the Italians."
Working conditions in Italy are
"much freer," she said. In
general, she enjoyed working
with vVarner, and will probably
make two more pictures for the
studio.
Candice Bergen plays the
female lead in A Night Full of
Rain. I pointed out that
Bergen's acting ability has
often been criticized and I
asked Lina why she chose her.
"I chose Candy because, for
me, it's a face of America. She

is very beautiful and she's also
a good soldier. In Carnal Know
ledge, she is good. I don't
knovnr (about) the critics. But
you know, I don't work for cri
tics. With Candy, we had a
wonderful relationship. In the
beginning, a relation full of
(she didn't elaborate) . . .
Candy was not easy because
with us it is not easy. Together
we are terrible to work with
. . . we are different from' Ho
llywood style.' Ciancarlo
helped us very much . . . After
beginning to understand, she
realized that this is an interest
ing way for an actress (to
work)."
Many of Lina's movies fea
ture the grotesque (a good
example is the female com
mandant in Seven Beauties). A
Night Full of Rain represents a
change in this aspect: "In this
last picture we have a picture a
little different from the others
because we don't work in the
grotesque ... I don't know
exactly why I don't feel grotes
que (at this time). I feel around
me many crises. This type of
crisis make this movie nearer
to a sort of reality . . . that for
me doesn't (have the) grotes
que." She has used the grotes
que in the past because she
feels she can reach the audi
ence by utilizing it, and be
cause: "I enjoy the grotesque.
I myself am grotesque."
Same star
A Night Full of Rain is similar
to Wertmuller's other movies
in one respect; Ciancarlo
Giannini is once again the star.
Lina says of Giancarlo: "It is
clear that I like actor. He's very
important . . . it's very easy to
work together." Ciancarlo on
Lina: "I prefer to work with
Lina. We work in a different
way, a particular way. I'll give
you an example. When we de
cide to make Seven Beauties,
we think for four years before
filming." This kind of hard
work and determination is all
too-familiar to them; as Lina
puts it: "We work more — and
too much — together."
If there is a particular theme
in Wertmuller's work, it is
man's need to be in "harmony
with society and nature. This is
an urgent need — for a man to
become civilized. If man
doesn't realize this need, I'm
afraid society, every society,
will go to hell. Man has almost
destroyed nature . . .There is a
tendency to fault society when
man (is at) fault."
Seven Beauties explores part
of this theme; specifically, the
need to be civilized, to have a
soul. This theme is rep
resented in the character Pas
qualino, played by Ciancarlo.
Giancarlo explained that Pas
qualino by "the end of the
movie amounts to nothing. At
the end of this movie, this man
looks at himself in the mirror.
He says 'Yes, I am alive,' but he
doesn't realize that he is a dead
man. This is dangerous for that
man."
"If you live," Lina says, "no
matter what the cost, in any

way, you are not a man. If your
life (costs) the death of another
man, if you are ready to do any
thing— I don't know what — to
be alive, then you are not a
man ... If every man in the
world do like him (Pasqualino),
the world is finished in five
years. The men who are really
alive in the film are the ones
who chose death" rather than
submit to the degradation that
Pasqualino experienced. Pas
qualino is a man "without a
soul; he's a beast."
Many women go to
Wertmuller movies expecting
to see a "feminist" film, be
cause Lina is a woman. When
they see the way women are
often portrayed in her films, as
grotesques or as servants to
men, they are disappointed
and often deeply offended. At
the question-answer session,
some of the sharpest questions
concerned this.
I asked Lina about the role of
women in her films. She said,
"It is the same thing for me —
the man and the woman. (They
are) the same face of the
human being ... I don't make
the difference in that way."
"Everything for me is a sym
bol. In Swept Away, the
woman is a symbol of the in
dustrial society. It is not a
woman to me; it's a significa
tion of another value. The
woman (who played the Nazi
commandant) in Seven
Beauties is a symbol of Nazi
power ... it is not all women
that are (represented) in this
picture."
Lina is deeply feminist in
views, and is bothered when
attacked for her portrayals of
women. The people in her
films are symbols who deal
with problems and crises; they
are not intended to represent
men or women as a group.
'I feel too much crisis'
I asked her about the pes
simism in her films. "In the last
two years," she said, "I feel too
much crisis around me to be
optimistic. But now (after

finishing the new film), I come
back more optimistic. ! feel
hopeful." She calls her films
"problematical" rather than
pessimistic; A Night Full of
Kairi will be a "problematic"
film.
Even though her films deal
with serious subjects, they are
often wildly funny. Wertmuller
uses comedy "because I think
its a very good (way) to speak to
a big audience about a big
problem. I think its very impor
tant . . . Laughter go easier
with the audience."
This mixture of comedy and
drama has led to success for
Lina in this country. "I'm not
(as) popular as I wish,'' she
said. "I don't know what hap
pened in the Midwest with
Seven Beauties. It's popular,
but not as popular as I wish."
Has success changed her? "I
think no. Absolutely I think no.
I'm afraid always because . . .
success is dangerous. But I'm
full of love as before. We love
the work."
'Difficult to think'
Ciancarlo said it this way:
"Success is not uncomforta
ble, never. But it's difficult to
think like (before). I try in my
life, in my work, to be the same
man, to have the same ideals
. . . maybe change these ideals
for the better. But when I think
about my work, I think I have a
body, a voice. When I start to
work, I start always from the
beginning (before the suc
cess)." He admits that the suc
cess "makes it more difficult"
to get back to this beginning.
The way Lina makes movies
is hard enough without the
added problem of success. She
is constantly thinking about
new projects; she won't dis
cuss them ("I am superstiti
ous"), except to say that she is
considering three right now.
She spoke briefly on her
method of writing: "I have an
idea. I speak to Ciancarlo, to
Roderigo (her husband) about
this idea. And after I write the
script we speak about it. We

make a little room, not so
much, for improvisation." The
script is very often changed
from day to day.
On the watch for scripts
She may not always work this
way; "I'd be very happy" if
someone gave her a prepared,
well-done script ("it would
make work easier"). She is
continually looking for such a
script. At Mem Aud, a woman
asked if she could send a script
to Lina, who immediately
wrote down heraddress in Italy
and gave it to the woman.
The interview ended with a
discussion of Lina's influences.
"I think that every picture that I
see has an influence on my
life," she said. "From the be
ginning, I love very much the
movies. I go every time that it's
possible, from when I was a
baby. Every picture for me was
important because it's part of
my culture. But there is (no pic
ture) in particular" that has in
fluenced her work.
If anyone has influenced
her, it is Frederico Fellini,
whom she worked with in the
early '60s. Lina speaks very
highly of him: "Fellini is a big
artist. I love him very much. He
is like a light in my life, because
he's a wonderful, wonderful
man, a really big poet. The time
I worked with Frederico was
one of the most beautiful in my
life. He taught me one very im
portant thing: 'there is nothing
to learn.' That is absolutely
true, I think. I love very much
Frederico's pictures. For me,
he's really one of the best in
theworld. But, unfortunately, I
think I'm very different from
Frederico; I'm in another
world. We use, for example,
different kinds of grotesques
. . . His is a baroque grotes
que; mine is a psychological
grotesque."
No favorites
Of her films, she has no favo
rite; they are "like my children
... I say always that I love all of
them. Absolutely. In different
ways, but I love all of them."

Giancarlo's favorite is Love
and Anarchy.
No matter what you think
about this woman's pictures,
you have to give her enormous
credit for what she has done.
Lina Wertmuller's wish that "in
10 years I'll he one among
many female directors" is a de
sire that, for the sake of the
movie industry, needs to be
fulfilled.
Such a goal would not have
been conceivable five years
ago, but Lina Wertmuller's
success has created some hope
for women in films, and that
hope in itself is a kind of vic
tory.
