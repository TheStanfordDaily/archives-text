ness, was appointed yesterday to his vacant seat in
the U.S. Senate by Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich.

away. I have no idea," she told reporters.
French police appeal for help
Paris — Kidnappers snatched a millionaire baron
in broad daylight. A 19305-style bandit is on the
loose. Serious crime is increasing in France and
authorities see "a reign of anarchy and violence"
unless the people give police a hand.
Justice Minister Alain Peyrefitte, who is acting
premier while Raymond Barre is abroad, appealed
to his countrymen to help police in the war against
outlaws.
"We do not wish a reign of anarchy and violence
to establish itself in France," Peyrefitte had
warnpd Tuesday night on nationwide television.
"At akness or complacency is unacceptable."
Pol: e stopped 140,000 vehicles and spot
checked 250,000 Frenchmen in the first 24 hours
after mysterious abductors carried off Baron
Fdouard-lean Empain in Paris on Monday.
The Belgian industrialist heads a giant conglom
erate that, among other things, builds nuclear
power plants and manufactures arms.
Future of nuclear power in doubt
Sacramento — The state Energy Commission
struck a major blow to the future of nuclear power
in California yesterday, declaring that no proven,
permanent method exists to store radioactive nuc
lear wastes.
The commissioners, all appointees of Gov. |erry
Brown, made the finding by a 4-1 vote. Under 1976

state laws, until that decision is reversed by the
commission or the Legislature, no new atomic
plants can be built in California.
The commission endorsed a report saying
wastes from nuclear plants should be considered
dangerous for 250,000 years, and no method exists
to keep them secure for that long.
Commissioner Gene Varanini, author of the re
port that the commission adopted, said tests to
demonstrate storage methods could be made by
the mid-1980s. But he said those tests could well
fail.
Planes widen search for satellite
Yellowknife, Northwest Territories — U.S. and
Canadian planes sweeping the skies for radiation
from a fallen Soviet satellite widened their search
yesterday to the Lake Superior area of the United
States, but no fallout has been detected, officials
of the two countries said.
They stressed that air samples were being taken
in that corner of the northern United States as a
precautionary measure. The planes were specially
equipped with gamma-ray detectors.
"There is no indication of any radioactivity so
far," U.S. State Department spokeswoman (ill
Schuker told reporters in Washington.
The crippled Cosmos 954 satellite, powered by a
nuclear reactor containing 100 pounds of highly
radioactive uranium 235, plummeted from space
and reentered the earth's atmosphere early Tues
day, falling apart into dozens of flaming fireballs.
New water regulations proposed
Washington — The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) proposed new regulations yesterday
that are designed to remove cancer-causing chem
icals from the nation's drinking water by requiring
unprecedented levels of water purity.
"We're not suggesting this is a panic situation,"
EPA Administrator Douglas Costle said in an
nouncing the proposed regulations.
However, he warned that EPA has become
"especially concerned about the potential in
crease in cancer risk" resulting from growing
amounts of organic chemicals being found in
drinking water.
The plan would raise the average annual cost for
water for a family of three between $6 and $10 a

year, Costle said.
Effects of saccharin investigated
Washington — The federal government will con
duct a nationwide study of bladder cancer victims
to see if saccharin, alone or with other factors,
causes this kind of cancer in humans as it does in
rats, it was announced yesterday.
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the
Food and Drug Administration said their study will
look at the cases of 3000 bladder cancer patients to
try to determine which factors contribute to the
disease.
The lifestyles of the patients will be contrasted
with those of 6000 persons without cancer to see
what roles such things as drinking water, cigaret
tes, occupational exposures to chemicals, and the
artificial sweeteners saccharin and cyclamate play
in the disease.
Senate against S. Africa policy
Washington —The Carter administration should
forcefully discourage U.S. investment in South Af
rica because of that country's official policy of
racial apartheid, a Senate subcommittee said yes
terday.
We're saying that if the South African govern
mentwantstocontinuedown the roadof legalized
lepression, this country is notgoingtosupportit,"
said Sen. Dick Clark (D-lowa), chairman of the
Senate foreign relations subcommittee on Africa.
The United States has publicly condemned
South Africa's racial policies, and refused to sell
arms to the government of Prime Minister John
Vorster.
The present policy is to neither encourage nor
discourage trade with South Africa.
Theie was no immediate reaction from the
White House on the subcommittee's suggestion
that the Carter administration apply more strin
gent economic pressures to show its disapproval
of South Africa's racial policies.

Planes widen search for satellite
Yellowknife, Northwest Territories — U.S. and
Canadian planes sweeping the skies for radiation
from a fallen Soviet satellite widened their search
yesterday to the Lake Superior area of the United
States, but no fallout has been detected, officials
of the two countries said.
They stressed that air samples were being taken
in that corner of the northern United States as a
precautionary measure. The planes were specially
equipped with gamma-ray detectors.
"There is no indication of any radioactivity so
far," U.S. State Department spokeswoman (ill
Schuker told reporters in Washington.
The crippled Cosmos 954 satellite, powered by a
nuclear reactor containing 100 pounds of highly

New water regulations proposed
Washington — The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) proposed new regulations yesterday
that are designed to remove cancer-causing chem
icals from the nation's drinking water by requiring
unprecedented levels of water purity.
"We're not suggesting this is a panic situation,"
EPA Administrator Douglas Costle said in an
nouncing the proposed regulations.
However, he warned that EPA has become
"especially concerned about the potential in
crease in cancer risk" resulting from growing
amounts of organic chemicals being found in
drinking water.
The plan would raise the average annual cost for
water for a family of three between $6 and $10 a

year, Costle said.
Effects of saccharin investigated
Washington — The federal government will con
duct a nationwide study of bladder cancer victims
to see if saccharin, alone or with other factors,

rats, it was announced yesterday.
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the
Food and Drug Administration said their study will
look at the cases of 3000 bladder cancer patients to
try to determine which factors contribute to the
disease.
The lifestyles of the patients will be contrasted
with those of 6000 persons without cancer to see
what roles such things as drinking water, cigaret
tes, occupational exposures to chemicals, and the
artificial sweeteners saccharin and cyclamate play
in the disease.

in Waverly, Minn., on Jan. 13. He was 66. The

French police appeal for help
Paris — Kidnappers snatched a millionaire baron
in broad daylight. A 19305-style bandit is on the
loose. Serious crime is increasing in France and
authorities see "a reign of anarchy and violence"
unless the people give police a hand.
Justice Minister Alain Peyrefitte, who is acting
premier while Raymond Barre is abroad, appealed
to his countrymen to help police in the war against
outlaws.
"We do not wish a reign of anarchy and violence
to establish itself in France," Peyrefitte had
warnpd Tuesday night on nationwide television.
"At akness or complacency is unacceptable."
Pol: e stopped 140,000 vehicles and spot
checked 250,000 Frenchmen in the first 24 hours
after mysterious abductors carried off Baron
Fdouard-lean Empain in Paris on Monday.

erate that, among other things, builds nuclear
power plants and manufactures arms.
Future of nuclear power in doubt
Sacramento — The state Energy Commission
struck a major blow to the future of nuclear power
in California yesterday, declaring that no proven,
permanent method exists to store radioactive nuc
lear wastes.
The commissioners, all appointees of Gov. |erry
Brown, made the finding by a 4-1 vote. Under 1976

state laws, until that decision is reversed by the
commission or the Legislature, no new atomic
plants can be built in California.
The commission endorsed a report saying
wastes from nuclear plants should be considered
dangerous for 250,000 years, and no method exists
to keep them secure for that long.
Commissioner Gene Varanini, author of the re
port that the commission adopted, said tests to
demonstrate storage methods could be made by
the mid-1980s. But he said those tests could well
fail.
Planes widen search for satellite
Yellowknife, Northwest Territories — U.S. and
Canadian planes sweeping the skies for radiation
from a fallen Soviet satellite widened their search
yesterday to the Lake Superior area of the United
States, but no fallout has been detected, officials
of the two countries said.
They stressed that air samples were being taken
in that corner of the northern United States as a
precautionary measure. The planes were specially
equipped with gamma-ray detectors.
"There is no indication of any radioactivity so
far," U.S. State Department spokeswoman (ill
Schuker told reporters in Washington.
The crippled Cosmos 954 satellite, powered by a
nuclear reactor containing 100 pounds of highly
radioactive uranium 235, plummeted from space
and reentered the earth's atmosphere early Tues
day, falling apart into dozens of flaming fireballs.
New water regulations proposed
Washington — The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) proposed new regulations yesterday
that are designed to remove cancer-causing chem
icals from the nation's drinking water by requiring
unprecedented levels of water purity.
"We're not suggesting this is a panic situation,"
EPA Administrator Douglas Costle said in an
nouncing the proposed regulations.
However, he warned that EPA has become
"especially concerned about the potential in
crease in cancer risk" resulting from growing
amounts of organic chemicals being found in
drinking water.
The plan would raise the average annual cost for
water for a family of three between $6 and $10 a

year, Costle said.
Effects of saccharin investigated
Washington — The federal government will con
duct a nationwide study of bladder cancer victims
to see if saccharin, alone or with other factors,
causes this kind of cancer in humans as it does in
rats, it was announced yesterday.
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the
Food and Drug Administration said their study will
look at the cases of 3000 bladder cancer patients to
try to determine which factors contribute to the
disease.
The lifestyles of the patients will be contrasted
with those of 6000 persons without cancer to see
what roles such things as drinking water, cigaret
tes, occupational exposures to chemicals, and the
artificial sweeteners saccharin and cyclamate play
in the disease.
