# Sex collection created
## 
### Adrian Tamimi 
At the suggestion of Herant Katch
adourian, dean of humanities and
sciences (and Human Sex instruc
tor), Meyer Library is establishing a
Human Sexuality collection.
The 50-title collection will be
housed in area 280 of UGLY, and will
include "The Hite Report (A Nation
wide Study of Human Sexuality),"
"The )oy of Sex," "The Sex Resear
chers," "Human Sexual Inadequ
acy," "Erotic Art of the West," "Sex
Offenders" and "Sexual Behavior in
the 19705" among others.
Many ot the books are already in
the library, and it is felt that most of
the books would be collected by the
library anyway, said Liz Salzer, head
librarian at Meyer.
However, additional copies of
some books have been purchased to
assure that one copy of each book
will be available on regular 4-week

circulation in addition to the copies
in the collection. The human biology
program provided the funds for the
additional copies to be purchased,
according to Katchadourian.
Katchadourian wanted to establish
the collection so his Human Sexual
ity students would be free to "look at
the original source materials" related
to the subject of human sexuality.
Normally such books would be dis
persed throughout the reference
areas ot the library. Students will
now be able to find books on almost
any aspect of sexuality in one area.
One disadvantage of having all the
books together might be that some
students might find it harder to ob
tain some of the books, since the en
tire collection will be non
circulating, Salzer said.
Salzer views the collection as ex
perimental and desires comments
from students on the new collection.
