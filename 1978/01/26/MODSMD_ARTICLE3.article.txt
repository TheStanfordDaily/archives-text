# Profs, TA's discuss grading
## 
### Matt Mettler 
Lack of a clear understanding in a
teaching assistant's mind of what is
expected from students is the cause
of most grading problems, according
to John Goheen, University om
budsman.
Goheen spoke along with Lawr
ence Ryan, professor of English, and
Dow Woodward, professor of biol
ogy at an informal forum forgraduate
teaching assistants on grading earlier
this week.
Participants pointed to the need
for uniformity in grading, which is
particularly difficulty in large classes
with several TA's. Ryan suggested all
the TA's for a given course should
discuss several student papers and
come to an agreement on standards
before grading exams or papers.
Ryan suggested that TA's should
work as a group when preparing
exam questions. He also said instruc
tors should supervise the mechanics
of grading more closely.
A major question discussed but
left unresolved was whether a single
TA should grade all the students on
one exam question or grade all of the
questions for a group of students,
particularly on essay questions.
Uniformity
The former method has the advan
tage of uniformity, and is recom
mended by the University. All stu
dents would receive the same treat
ment on the question.
Ryan indicated, however, that in
the past, TA's have preferred to
grade the students in their own sec
tions. This allows them to get feed
back, see how the student has assimi
lated what he has learned in section,
and evaluate the students individu
ally.
Grading and objectivity
Grading the students individually,
however, brings up questions of ob
jectivity, and how to deal with the

subjectivity of TA's, Ryan said. The
Humanities 60 series TA's have av
oided problems by carefully check
ing each TA's standards before the
submission of final grades.
Woodward addressed the ques
tion of whether a grading system is
meant to differentiate between stu
dents or to establish general levels of
understanding and comprehension.
He claimed it is possible for a teacher
to get any distribution or curve he
wants by the way he makes up the
exam.
Curves
The University officially discour
ages grading on a curve, or deciding
how many A's, B's or C's to give be
fore reviewing class results. Goheen
said that in the past surveys of the
faculty have shown them divided on
whether if all students did A work
they should all receive A's.
The question of how to handle
pre-meds and other students who
feel an added need to achieve high
marks to obtain graduate or profes
sional school admission was also
brought up.
On this subject, Woodward stres
sed two points. First, graduate
school admissions officers give sub
stantial weight to the school which
students come from. Students here
are competing more against each
other than against students from
schools with lesser reputations. It is
important, Woodward said, to con
sider the fraction of students that get
in to the number that apply to medi
cal schools.
Letters are important
Second, Woodward emphasized
the importance of letters of recom
mendation. Grades tend to show,
particularly in the biological sci
ences, how much information a stu
dent can memorize. Imagination,
ability to assimilate new information,
and to intelligently deal with new

facts are as important, and not gen
erally reflected by grades.
Several problems that were men
tioned but not addressed were how
students should be graded relative to
their experience and maturity,
whether more should be expected
from seniors than from freshmen,
and what recourse should be availa
ble for students who feel they have
been treated unfairly.
