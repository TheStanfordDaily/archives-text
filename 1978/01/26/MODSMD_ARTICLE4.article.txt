Cairo (AP) â€” Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat said yesterday he is in
"constant contact" with President
|immy Carter and that behind-the
scenes negotiations were underway
to reopen peace talks with Israel. But
Sadat said he does not know when or
if the talks will resume.
Israel, with U.S. help, reportedly
has drafted a proposed declaration
of principles aimed at restarting
political talks in Jerusalem, which
had begun to deal with the Palesti
nian and other issues before Sadat
broke them off last week.
Israeli officials said their country
was awaiting a response from Cairo
on the proposed declaration.
The officials also predicted that the
Israeli Cabinet this weekend would
decide to renew the parallel military
talks in Cairo, which the cabinet last
Sunday chose not to rejoin.
Assistant U.S. Secretary of State
Alfred Atherton has been trying to
mediate a dispute over wording of
the declaration.
In Tel Aviv, deputy Prime Minister
Yigael Yadin said Israel made an in
formal offer to Egypt for an exchange
of territory to solve the dispute bet
ween the two countries over Jewish
settlements in the Israeli-occupied
Sinai Peninsula. Vadin was the first
senior government official to con
firm an exchange of land had been
proposed.
Vadin said on television the prop
osal was raised in "feelers of an in
formal nature" but Egypt rejected it.
Sadat has said Israel's insistence on
keeping Jewish settlements in the
Sinai caused him to break off the
peace talks last week. Israel has
about 20 settlements in the Rafah Sa
lient in northeastern Sinai.
King Hassan of Morocco called on
Arab countries to rally behind Sadat,
saying such support would put pres
sure on Western leaders to persuade
Israel to withdraw from occupied
Arab territory.
Sadat also received support from
President Tito of Yugoslavia, who
said in a seven-page letter to the
Egyptian president he supports the
peace moves with Israel, the semi
official Cairo newspaper Al Ahram

reported in Thursday editions.
Tito reportedly said all non-aligned
nations should support Sadat to pre
vent Israel from exploiting Arab dif
ferences. The newspaper also said
Tito has urged President Carter to
open a dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
Sadat, speaking with reporters
after reviewing a display by police
academy cadets, said he sent mes
sages Tuesday and Wednesday to
President Carter through U.S. Am
bassador Hermann Eilts and had re
ceived replies. But he would not dis
close the contents.
Sadat said there might be "some
news" in a few days but would not

elaborate, saying matters were "in a
quiet period in which all parties con
cerned re-evaluate their position."
Senior Egyptian sources said they
believe that the political talks, bro
ken off by Egypt last week, could re
sume within 10 days.
"We are looking for a demonstra
tion of flexibility from Israel," said
one Egyptian source.
The political talks were suspended
against a background of hardening
public positions and Israeli objec
tions to Egyptian press remarks it
considered anti-Semitic. Sadat ac
cused Israel of not negotiating in
good faith.
