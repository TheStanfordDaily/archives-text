# Alcohol clinic opened
## 
### Robin Millington 
The medical school has instituted
an alcohol clinic designed to help'
counsel and educate the alcoholic
and his or her family. The program is
to expand the concern about al
coholism to members of a variety of
medical disciplines.
The clinic, which is open by ap
pointment from 8:30-5 on weekdays,
offers individual counseling and
psychotherapy, vocational counsel
ing, family therapy and children's
services.
There is also a free program for
education about alcohol and its ef
fects, which is open to the public.
According to Stephanie Brown, as
sociate director of the clinic, Stan
ford students frequently attend
these classes.
Lectures are held every Monday at
1 p.m. in Room TBI2I at the medical
school. A new series begins on Feb.
13 offering as the topic "What is Too
Much Alcohol?" Other topics in
clude "The Family," "Women and
Alcoholism" and "Teenagers and Al
cohol."
Brown said she sees the clinic as
being very important to "really bring
ing the problem of alcoholism out
into the open." She said she feels it is
important to involve the entire fabric

of the medical school in the study of
alcoholism, and that the clinic has
been influential in creatingagrowing
awareness in the larger medical
community.
"So many more professionals
know about alcoholism than had in
the past — that's important," Brown
said.
Brown also emphasized the impor
tance of helping children of an al
coholic parent cope with many of the
problems stemming from growing
up in this kind of atmosphere. She
stressed that by "children" she is not
only talking about young children
still at home, but adults who have
never really faced the problems from
their childhood. She hopes that
more adults will seek out the clinic to
explore their feelings.
The clinic is funded by two un
named foundations for two years.
Discussions have been started on
the idea of creating a full service
clinic rather than just offering group
therapy for alcohol-related prob
lems.
Within the last year, the clinic has
expanded. Future plans are for start
ing a volunteer counseling program
to be offered free of charge, and to
start an evening educational series to
be offered in the spring.
