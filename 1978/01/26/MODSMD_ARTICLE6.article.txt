# Joggers outlawed in Los Altos Hills?
## 
### Rob Lempert 
A proposal to come before the Los
Altos Hills City Council is designed to
ban or regulate joggers on that city's
streets.
The measure, slated to be read at
the Feb. 1 council meeting, has not
yet been drafted by the city attorney,
so several different plans are being
considered, said Deputy City Clerk
Susan Butler.
However, she said the ordinance
will probably seek to ban any group
of two or more joggers or require
them to carry permits to run on city
roads.
The furor centers around The Sun
day Fun Run, a weekly jog sponsored
by Runner's World magazine. The
Fun Run has met in the Foothill Col
lege parking lot every Sunday morn
ing for the last five years. It attracts
about 150 people a weekend, said
Bob Anderson, the run's organizer.
While most of the runners stay on
campus, about a third of them ven
ture up Moody Road, a narrow resi
dential street without sidewalks.
Butler said there have been several
instances of Fun Runners being abu
sive, by either blocking traffic or dis
obeying the sheriff.
Anderson said that the runners
have a right to be there and are not
required to leave even if the sheriff
asks them.
The city is basing its case .around
safety, Anderson said. The city coun-

cil has told him several times some
one might get hit by a car.
But Anderson said, "If a cargoes 35
mph in a 25 zone, we don't ban cars."
He agrees that the situation is poten
tially dangerous, but argued that it is
possible to pass laws such that both
cars and runners can use the road.
Presently there are no rules gov
erning joggers, said Anderson. "We
agree running on the right side of the
road is dangerous and those who do
it should be cited," he said. The law
should require joggers to run on the
left and not more than two abreast.
This is safe, he said.
The Los Altos Hills proposal might
require runners, if it permits them at
all, to travel single file, according to
Anderson. He said this is clearly im
practical for it is ridiculous to expect
two friends to run in that fashion.
Anderson plans to attend the Feb.
1 council meeting with Runner's
World's lawyer to oppose the city or
dinance. He said city councilmen
have talked to him in the past, object
ing to the Fun Run, but Anderson
feels his organization is doing some
good for the community.
Anderson also said the Sunday
morning Fun Runners often pass in
front of councilmen's houses. He
added that joggers should not be re
quired to carry identification cards
identifying them as licensed to run
on public streets.
