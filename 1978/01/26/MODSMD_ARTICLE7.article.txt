• The sentencing of former Stanford
employee Phillip Peterson has been
continued to Feb. 3, in the sixth con
tinuation of his embezzlement case,
according to Orlando Ereno, chief of
the criminal division of Santa Clara
County Courts.
Peterson, former director of the
language laboratory in Meyer Library
and lecturer in the Spanish and Por
tuguese department, was fired from
both jobs last March 21, following his
March 17 arrest on three counts of
grand theft embezzlement of over
$62,000 from the University.
He had allegedly been collecting
receipts thrown out by a San Mateo
camera store, and turning them in as
records of money spent on supplies
for Stanford. He was then reim
bursed by the University.
According to treno, Peterson pled
"nolo contendre" to all charges last
Aug. 22. The sentencing was sub-

sequently continued to Oct. 6, Oct.
27 and Nov. 27, at which time the no
contest plea was withdrawn and a
"not guilty" plea was entered, with a
trial date set for Dec. 12. On Dec. 12,
however, the no-contest plea was
reinstated, and sentencing was set
for yesterday, )an. 25.
Yesterday the case was again con
tinued, this time to Feb. 3, at 9 a.m
Early difficulties in the proceed
ings were due to problems with
reimbursement of the embezzled
money to the University. According
to Bob Beth, director of risk man
agement, Stanford has been reim
bursed $57,800 under its $5,000 de
ductable policy with Fidelity and De
posit Insurance Company, which
bonds all Stanford employees.
