Today's issue of Thursday, the Dai
ly's weekly features and entertain
ment issue, was canceled yesterday
following the resignation of Thurs
day editor Stephen Crolius. In its
place readers find the regular Daily
broadsheet, with several of Thurs
day's features included.
Thursday was canceled today for a
number of reasons. At the base was
Crolius' resignation; Thursday had
been under his direction and almost
complete control for the entire year,
and there was simply no one on the
Daily staff with the expertise to pro
duce a satisfactory Thursday in a few
hours without his help.
Crolius resigned after working
himself into a Catch 22 situation. He
had declared that either Steve
Hansch's South Africa article run as
the cover story of Thursday, or
Stephen Crolius would leave the
Daily for good.
I was delivered this ultimatum
Wednesday at 1 a.m., when onlyfour
paragraphs of the story had been
produced. The deadline for the story
had already passed two hours be
fore, but only four very disjointed
parag aphs had been produced.
By noon yesterday, more than 12
hours past the theoretical deadline
for the cover story, only four pages of
what would have been a 15-20 page
article had actually been written.
Moreover, in the story (or what I saw
of it) there was apparently no attempt
to give balanced coverage to the
issue of Stanford's divestment of
South Africa stock.
At the time Crolius argued (as he
does in the opinion here entitled
"My reasons for resigning") that
what Steve Hansch was producing
was a simple "statement of fact."
Upon reading the story, I found no
blatant untruths. However, his facts
were selected and marshalled in a
way that could hardly be regarded as
a fair, balanced news analysis by

anyone — be they journalists or the
most disinterested newspaper
reader.
Crolius also charges that the cover
story was vetoed by me because of its
author's political background. Steve
Hansch, while not a regular face at
the Daily, had made contributions to
the paper in the past, mostly through
opinions articles. He has had a long
association with various campus
groups concerned about South Afri
can investment, but certainly his in
volvement alone would never have
caused refusal of his story.
What did matter was the lateness
of the article and its bias. Had the
Thursday deadline been met, I feel
confident even the article's rather
serious problems could have been
adjusted to meet everyone's wishes.
But there was no way any of those
necessary adjustments could have
been made at the late date the story
began trickling in.
Therefore, I pulled the cover story
planned for today's Thursday.
Crolius has chosen to call this "cen
sorship," but in my mind it is merely
a matter of not wanting to give the
Stanford community an article which
suffered from distortion by omission
under the guise of a newspaper's ob
jectivity.

In his opinion, Crolius insists that
there was some sort of conspiracy
afoot to keep out of the pages of the
Daily any advocacy of social or politi
cal change. Given that the opinions
pages of the Daily are open to any
community member and that care
fully written articles of opinion are
constantly being published, Crolius'
claim of "censorship" is ludicrous.
It may be true that Crolius found
what he saw as an attitude of "inflex
ibility and intolerance" in my action
yesterday. I prefer to see it as a
necessary step, given that the Daily
strives to put forth objective cover
age rather than distortion. Had the
story in preparation been printed, I
would have felt that any conceivable
standards of journalistic objectivity
had been compromised completely.
Volume 172 of the Daily will end
with publ.cation tomorrow. Newly
elected editor David Ansley has de
cided not to continue Thursday, so
last week's issue was the final Thurs
day, at least for a while. Cancellation
of today's issue represents a loss for
everyone involved with Thursday —
including myself. It is an unfortunate
end for what was developing into an
excellent publication.
