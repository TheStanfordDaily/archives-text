# My reasons for resigning
## 
### 
Stephen Crolius

My "career" at the Daily ended ab
ruptly yesterday when I resigned in
the face of a prohibition to run a cer
tain article as the cover story for this
week's Thursday. Jacob Young,
editor of Volume 172, told me yes
terday morning that he felt Steve
Hansch's article on South African in
vestment was an "opinions piece"
and as such unsuitable for the cover
story. Later on in the day, I heard
reference made to Steve Hansch's
radical background and the analogy,
"Letting Steve Hansch write an arti
cle about South Africa is like letting
Richard Nixon write an article about
Watergate."
I disagree with this view and am
tempted to explain my reasons why. I
will not however, since I feel that this
is only ostensibly the main issue. Suf
fice it to say that even the most objec
tive journalist is not free from bias
and that it is the function of an editor
to do his best to expunge all traces of
subjectivity from the copy he edits.
This is the first occasion on which my

ability to do so has been questioned.
The main issue in my opinion,
however, is a much more serious one
— censorship. Jacob was exercising
his perogative as editor, it is true, but
in so doing, he was not so much cen
soring words as an entire attitude. At
its root, the question was one of per
sonalities: the one or two per
sonalities in charge preventing the
expression of a personality foreign to
them.
Steve Hansch has certainly been a
controversial figure on campus, but
he is a capable student journalist.
Moreover, he has always taken pains
not to offend when unnecessary. I
believe, nonetheless, that he was
found offensive by the Daily "estab
lishment."
Why? Was it simply a question of
politics, conservative vs. radical? No,
I believe it goes deeper than that. I
believe that it is a clash of fundamen
tal attitudes. On the one hand we
have inflexibility and intolerance.
We have a self-complacent world

view and unwillingness to face the
need for change. We have the at
titude which is swiftly and surely de
stroying mankind and his planet. On
the other hand we have sensitivity
and open-mindedness. We have a
holistic world view which recognizes
the excruciating injustice of main
taining the status quo. We have an
attitude which leaves no choice but
to do everything possible to save our
earth and ourselves.
For the length of my experience
with it, the Daily has tended more
often toward the former attitude
than the latter. Throughout my in
volvement with it, I have tried, with
out being too obnoxiously evangeli
cal, to push it toward the latter at
titude. In this endeavor I have more
often been unsuccessful than suc
cessful and the present situation is
my last defeat. I resigned because I
can no longer work at the Daily in
good conscience. Many thanks to all
who have in any way supported me.

We have a self-complacent world

view and unwillingness to face the
need for change. We have the at
titude which is swiftly and surely de
stroying mankind and his planet. On
the other hand we have sensitivity
and open-mindedness. We have a
holistic world view which recognizes
the excruciating injustice of main
taining the status quo. We have an
attitude which leaves no choice but
to do everything possible to save our
earth and ourselves.
For the length of my experience
with it, the Daily has tended more
often toward the former attitude
than the latter. Throughout my in
volvement with it, I have tried, with
out being too obnoxiously evangeli
cal, to push it toward the latter at
titude. In this endeavor I have more
often been unsuccessful than suc
cessful and the present situation is
my last defeat. I resigned because I
can no longer work at the Daily in
good conscience. Many thanks to all
who have in any way supported me.

My "career" at the Daily ended ab
ruptly yesterday when I resigned in
the face of a prohibition to run a cer
tain article as the cover story for this
week's Thursday. Jacob Young,
editor of Volume 172, told me yes
terday morning that he felt Steve
Hansch's article on South African in
vestment was an "opinions piece"
and as such unsuitable for the cover
story. Later on in the day, I heard
reference made to Steve Hansch's
radical background and the analogy,
"Letting Steve Hansch write an arti
cle about South Africa is like letting
Richard Nixon write an article about
Watergate."
I disagree with this view and am
tempted to explain my reasons why. I
will not however, since I feel that this
is only ostensibly the main issue. Suf
fice it to say that even the most objec
tive journalist is not free from bias
and that it is the function of an editor
to do his best to expunge all traces of
subjectivity from the copy he edits.
This is the first occasion on which my

ability to do so has been questioned.
The main issue in my opinion,
however, is a much more serious one
— censorship. Jacob was exercising
his perogative as editor, it is true, but
in so doing, he was not so much cen
soring words as an entire attitude. At
its root, the question was one of per
sonalities: the one or two per
sonalities in charge preventing the
expression of a personality foreign to
them.
Steve Hansch has certainly been a
controversial figure on campus, but
he is a capable student journalist.
Moreover, he has always taken pains
not to offend when unnecessary. I
believe, nonetheless, that he was
found offensive by the Daily "estab
lishment."
Why? Was it simply a question of
politics, conservative vs. radical? No,
I believe it goes deeper than that. I
believe that it is a clash of fundamen
tal attitudes. On the one hand we
have inflexibility and intolerance.
