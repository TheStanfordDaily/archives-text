...as Freshman Patricia Mutch, who won an Honorable Mention and $100
in last year's Mattel Design Competition. Patricia's clever "Turtle House"
singled her out of the many Stanford Product Design and Engineering

recognition of the toy industry for their creative talents.
This year's competition is on NOW. All Stanford Engineering and Product
Design students are eligible, and invited to invent, design, construct and
demonstrate a new recreational product for children. Entrants will be
judged for a variety of criteria, and will have an opportunity to offer their
entries and other ideas to Mattel. Deadline is January 31st, 1978 - so hurry...
You could be so creative!
