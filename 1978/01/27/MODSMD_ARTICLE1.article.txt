# Study finds small classes predominate

A study of undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford, recently released by
the dean of undergraduate studies
office, shows that two-thirds of un
dergraduate courses have an enroll
ment of 30 or less.
In addition, more than a quarter of
those courses taught by individual
faculty involve eight or fewer stu
dents.
The statistics, according to Assoc.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
David Abernethy, were taken from
all courses numbered one to 199 of
fered by the schools of humanities
and sciences, engineering and earth
sciences.
However, Abernethy noted, these
statistics include directed reading
programs and individual student
work with faculty on honors theses.
A breakdown of the statistics
shows that small group instruction
occurs chiefly during students'
freshman and senior years. For the
Class of 1976, 33 percent were enrol
led in classes of 19 or fewer in their
freshman year.
This compares with 19 percent en
rolled in classes of that size in
sophomore year, 21 percent in junior
year and 23 percent in senior year.
The large number of freshmen tak
ing small classes, according to Aber
nethy, is due to the freshman semi
nar program.
Statistics for senior year show
smaller class size, he said, because of
colloquia and special research semi
nars. About 13 percent of graduating
seniors last year received de
partmental or interdepartmental
honors. Most of these require indi
vidual work with a faculty member
on a thesis.
A survey of last year's seniors
showed that 91 percent of the
graduating class thought Stanford's
faculty was "excellent or above aver
age" in scholarship and research. In
contrast only 41 percent felt the same
way aoout the faculty as teachers.
The dean of undergraduate studies
office is currently determining the
number of students taking advantage
of individual research and faculty
related research programs, he said.
This year, faculty members listed
about 100 research opportunities
with the undergraduate dean's of
fice. SCIRE has 10 projects annually,
which involve 38 students.
Abernethy said many students
"don't take up the special programs,
or don't know about them." The next
studv will try to follow a sample of
freshmen through their four years
here, he said.
"We want to find out how many
students participate in at least one
special program," he said.
A further question, he indicated,
would concern what would happen if
more students wanted to undertake
independent programs with faculty.
The question, Abernethy said, is
"how many faculty would have
time."
