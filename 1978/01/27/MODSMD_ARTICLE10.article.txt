Gil Scott-Heron
To place an article on Gil Scott-
Heron (Daily, Jan. 20) in a position
beneath one on William Shockley is a
glaring offense to blacks
everywhere. However, an even grea
ter, though more subtle, offense is
the content of the Gil Scott-Heron
article. Findingcountless errors in it I
can only point out a few for the sake
of brevity.
First of all to make the assumption
that Gil Scott-Heron is merely a
"singer-songwriter" is evidence of
the pervasive ignorance America has
toward black culture. Scott-Heron is
first and foremost a poet. He has re
ceived a masters degree in English
from )ohn Hopkins University and is
presently a professor at Federal City
College in Washington, D.C. He is an
intellectual, a novelist and a re
volutionary. An articulate man, he
has contributed much to the struggle
for black liberation.

Another grave error in the article
was the misconception that Gil
Scott-Heron is "trying to interpret
the black experience." Although this
quote was attributed to Scott-Heron,
it was taken out of context. There is
no "trying" in his art. Scott-Heron is
living and experiencing blackness
everyday. What he has so eloquently
achieved is the ability to express the
black experience to others through
words and music.
Finally, the article ignored the fact
that Gil Scott-Heron not only put
blacks' "problems and frustrations
into words," but that he also reaf
firmed the sense of unity and
strength which has been the
mainstay of black Americans in this
country for hundreds of years.
These mistakes were in no way in
significant. They are indicative of the
lack of understanding and sensitivity
our society has toward black culture.
Hopefully, by addressing this prob
lem of transubstansive error (on the
part of the Daily and society), non
blacks will realize black culture is a
legitimate part of the American ex
perience and should be treated —
and reported on — in an intelligent
and respectful manner.

I live at Ujamaa, which sponsored
Gil Scott-Heron and Barnett Wil
liams' presentation last week. In the
Daily's coverage of the event, I was
disappointed among other things by
the omission of Williams. Assuming
the reporter was at the event, we
must ask ourselves how Williams
could have been overlooked. Giving
the staff the benefit of the doubt, it
remains that at some level someone
decided Williams was not newswor
thy.
Williams gave a stunning solo per
formance the first half of the even
ing. More than a lead-in to Scott-
Heron, Williams was a vital and in
tegral part of theentire night. During
an animated lesson on African per
cussion, recited traditional
tales, sang African songs with the
help of an enthusiastic audience,
blew an antelope horn non-stop for
several minutes to illustrate circular
breathing (air travels simultaneously
in the nose and out the mouth),
played a calabash while tossing the
same instrument into the air and

catching it on beat — all this while
dancing.
Williams built up a spirit of en
thusiasm, strength and unity which
lasted throughout the evening. Why
wasn't he newsworthy? Assuming
the omission was not intentional,
there isa cultural phenomena known
as transubstantive error which could
account for this mistake. In looking
at a culture other than our own, we
tend to categorize what we see in
terms of our own culture and hence
often distort the true value of what
ever we're looking at. Presumably, at
some level someone looked at Wil
liams in terms of a western-European
musician, i.e., a drummerwho keeps
the beat in a song and backs up the
vocalist.
This role may exist for percus
sionists in western European culture,
but not for Africans. In Africa, drums
are literally the heartbeat of life and a
basic tool in communication of all
kinds. Indeed, talking drums actually
imitate tonal African dialects. Yet
drums are used for more than imita
tion. They are a fundamental part of
African spiritual, emotional and so
cial life.
The drum is in rhythm with the
drummer's own heartbeat. Beyond
that, the drummer is attuned to the
heartbeat of the other drummers,
dancers and spectators. Williams'
performance was an explicit illustra
tion of the inseparability for African
people of dance from music, and
music from percussion. For people
of African heritage, their coming to
gether for music, song and dance is
an immensely important spiritual,
emotional and social communion.
For western European culture,
music is primarily entertainment and
it is mostly the vocals which provide
any real social value. When the Daily
relegated Williams' music to this
subordinate category, it was a trans
ubstantive error. In other words, if
the non-black Daily staff failed to
catch the important over-powering
spirit created by Williams between
himself and the audience, then the
staff missed what really counts for
people of African heritage. As Dr.
Irvin Brown, the Ujamaa resident fel
low explains, "Our music is much
too important to be handled so
carelessly. In fact, it's sacrilegious."

glaring offense to blacks
everywhere. However, an even grea
ter, though more subtle, offense is
the content of the Gil Scott-Heron
article. Findingcountless errors in it I
can only point out a few for the sake
of brevity.
First of all to make the assumption
that Gil Scott-Heron is merely a
"singer-songwriter" is evidence of
the pervasive ignorance America has
toward black culture. Scott-Heron is
first and foremost a poet. He has re
ceived a masters degree in English
from )ohn Hopkins University and is
presently a professor at Federal City
College in Washington, D.C. He is an
intellectual, a novelist and a re
volutionary. An articulate man, he
has contributed much to the struggle
for black liberation.

Another grave error in the article
was the misconception that Gil
Scott-Heron is "trying to interpret
the black experience." Although this
quote was attributed to Scott-Heron,
it was taken out of context. There is
no "trying" in his art. Scott-Heron is
living and experiencing blackness
everyday. What he has so eloquently
achieved is the ability to express the
black experience to others through
words and music.
Finally, the article ignored the fact
that Gil Scott-Heron not only put
blacks' "problems and frustrations
into words," but that he also reaf
firmed the sense of unity and
strength which has been the
mainstay of black Americans in this
country for hundreds of years.
These mistakes were in no way in
significant. They are indicative of the
lack of understanding and sensitivity
our society has toward black culture.
Hopefully, by addressing this prob
lem of transubstansive error (on the
part of the Daily and society), non
blacks will realize black culture is a
legitimate part of the American ex
perience and should be treated —
and reported on — in an intelligent
and respectful manner.

I live at Ujamaa, which sponsored
Gil Scott-Heron and Barnett Wil
liams' presentation last week. In the
Daily's coverage of the event, I was
disappointed among other things by
the omission of Williams. Assuming
the reporter was at the event, we
must ask ourselves how Williams
could have been overlooked. Giving
the staff the benefit of the doubt, it
remains that at some level someone
decided Williams was not newswor
thy.
Williams gave a stunning solo per
formance the first half of the even
ing. More than a lead-in to Scott-
Heron, Williams was a vital and in
tegral part of theentire night. During
an animated lesson on African per
cussion, recited traditional
tales, sang African songs with the
help of an enthusiastic audience,
blew an antelope horn non-stop for
several minutes to illustrate circular
breathing (air travels simultaneously
in the nose and out the mouth),
played a calabash while tossing the
same instrument into the air and

catching it on beat — all this while
dancing.
Williams built up a spirit of en
thusiasm, strength and unity which
lasted throughout the evening. Why
wasn't he newsworthy? Assuming
the omission was not intentional,
there isa cultural phenomena known
as transubstantive error which could
account for this mistake. In looking
at a culture other than our own, we
tend to categorize what we see in
terms of our own culture and hence
often distort the true value of what
ever we're looking at. Presumably, at
some level someone looked at Wil
liams in terms of a western-European
musician, i.e., a drummerwho keeps
the beat in a song and backs up the
vocalist.
This role may exist for percus
sionists in western European culture,
but not for Africans. In Africa, drums
are literally the heartbeat of life and a
basic tool in communication of all
kinds. Indeed, talking drums actually
imitate tonal African dialects. Yet
drums are used for more than imita
tion. They are a fundamental part of
African spiritual, emotional and so
cial life.
The drum is in rhythm with the
drummer's own heartbeat. Beyond
that, the drummer is attuned to the
heartbeat of the other drummers,
dancers and spectators. Williams'
performance was an explicit illustra
tion of the inseparability for African
people of dance from music, and
music from percussion. For people
of African heritage, their coming to
gether for music, song and dance is
an immensely important spiritual,
emotional and social communion.
For western European culture,
music is primarily entertainment and
it is mostly the vocals which provide
any real social value. When the Daily
relegated Williams' music to this
subordinate category, it was a trans
ubstantive error. In other words, if
the non-black Daily staff failed to
catch the important over-powering
spirit created by Williams between
himself and the audience, then the
staff missed what really counts for
people of African heritage. As Dr.
Irvin Brown, the Ujamaa resident fel
low explains, "Our music is much
too important to be handled so
carelessly. In fact, it's sacrilegious."

the content of the Gil Scott-Heron
article. Findingcountless errors in it I
can only point out a few for the sake
of brevity.
First of all to make the assumption
that Gil Scott-Heron is merely a
"singer-songwriter" is evidence of
the pervasive ignorance America has
toward black culture. Scott-Heron is
first and foremost a poet. He has re
ceived a masters degree in English
from )ohn Hopkins University and is
presently a professor at Federal City
College in Washington, D.C. He is an
intellectual, a novelist and a re
volutionary. An articulate man, he
has contributed much to the struggle
for black liberation.

Another grave error in the article
was the misconception that Gil
Scott-Heron is "trying to interpret
the black experience." Although this
quote was attributed to Scott-Heron,
it was taken out of context. There is
no "trying" in his art. Scott-Heron is
living and experiencing blackness
everyday. What he has so eloquently
achieved is the ability to express the
black experience to others through
words and music.
Finally, the article ignored the fact
that Gil Scott-Heron not only put
blacks' "problems and frustrations
into words," but that he also reaf
firmed the sense of unity and
strength which has been the
mainstay of black Americans in this
country for hundreds of years.
These mistakes were in no way in
significant. They are indicative of the
lack of understanding and sensitivity
our society has toward black culture.
Hopefully, by addressing this prob
lem of transubstansive error (on the
part of the Daily and society), non
blacks will realize black culture is a
legitimate part of the American ex
perience and should be treated —
and reported on — in an intelligent
and respectful manner.

No Williams coverage
I live at Ujamaa, which sponsored
Gil Scott-Heron and Barnett Wil
liams' presentation last week. In the
Daily's coverage of the event, I was
disappointed among other things by
the omission of Williams. Assuming
the reporter was at the event, we
must ask ourselves how Williams
could have been overlooked. Giving
the staff the benefit of the doubt, it
remains that at some level someone
decided Williams was not newswor
thy.
Williams gave a stunning solo per
formance the first half of the even
ing. More than a lead-in to Scott-
Heron, Williams was a vital and in
tegral part of theentire night. During
an animated lesson on African per
cussion, recited traditional
tales, sang African songs with the
help of an enthusiastic audience,
blew an antelope horn non-stop for
several minutes to illustrate circular
breathing (air travels simultaneously
in the nose and out the mouth),
played a calabash while tossing the
same instrument into the air and

catching it on beat — all this while
dancing.
Williams built up a spirit of en
thusiasm, strength and unity which
lasted throughout the evening. Why
wasn't he newsworthy? Assuming
the omission was not intentional,
there isa cultural phenomena known
as transubstantive error which could
account for this mistake. In looking
at a culture other than our own, we
tend to categorize what we see in
terms of our own culture and hence
often distort the true value of what
ever we're looking at. Presumably, at
some level someone looked at Wil
liams in terms of a western-European
musician, i.e., a drummerwho keeps
the beat in a song and backs up the
vocalist.
This role may exist for percus
sionists in western European culture,
but not for Africans. In Africa, drums
are literally the heartbeat of life and a
basic tool in communication of all
kinds. Indeed, talking drums actually
imitate tonal African dialects. Yet
drums are used for more than imita
tion. They are a fundamental part of
African spiritual, emotional and so
cial life.
The drum is in rhythm with the
drummer's own heartbeat. Beyond
that, the drummer is attuned to the
heartbeat of the other drummers,
dancers and spectators. Williams'
performance was an explicit illustra
tion of the inseparability for African
people of dance from music, and
music from percussion. For people
of African heritage, their coming to
gether for music, song and dance is
an immensely important spiritual,
emotional and social communion.
For western European culture,
music is primarily entertainment and
it is mostly the vocals which provide
any real social value. When the Daily
relegated Williams' music to this
subordinate category, it was a trans
ubstantive error. In other words, if
the non-black Daily staff failed to
catch the important over-powering
spirit created by Williams between
himself and the audience, then the
staff missed what really counts for
people of African heritage. As Dr.
Irvin Brown, the Ujamaa resident fel
low explains, "Our music is much
too important to be handled so
carelessly. In fact, it's sacrilegious."
