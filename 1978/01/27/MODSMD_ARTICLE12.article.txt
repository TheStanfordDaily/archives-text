About 300 yards south on lunipero Serra from
its intersection with Campus Drive is a gate
which opens up on an asphalt road leading up to
the radio telescope. I'd say at least 100 people a
day hop this gate and run up to the telescope.
Recently, the owner of this land put a sign on
this gate that said: "Private Land - Closed to
Entry." This Sunday, I observed a Stanford
policeman at this gate apparently citing a group
of persons in shorts for trespassing. Who owns
this land and why do they want to keep people
from running on it? -RC
According to George Burtness, Assistant
Manager for Land Resources, that land in the
foothills has for dtecades been leased out for
cattle. It is presently leased to Manuel Piers, of
Piers Dairy.
The University leases the land primarily to
protect it. The owners keep up the fences, and
the cattle keep the grass down, minimizing fire
hazard.
Picnickers and joggers are not particularly wel
come, for many reasons: (1) it is private land; (2)
the fire hazard; (3) some people leave trash be
hind; (4) Piers loses about 20 cattle per year to
family dogs; (5) there is a danger with people
getting into the radio-science equipment.
As a solution, four years ago, the Stanford
Conservation Club sponsored the use of a pass
system. This attempted to regulate land use, so
hikers and joggers could gain access. However,
problems arose, and the system was dropped
after one year, so the land was closed once
again.

This situation, Burtness says, was "fine."
There were a few joggers now and then, but they
really didn't create any problems.
But then the drought came, so the cattle were
moved off the land. As a consequence, people
started using the land again â€” and in increasing
numbers. Some would park their cars along
Junipero Serra, and others would lift their
motorcycles over the fence to ride upon the
land.
The problem was back. So, about six months
ago, the University, in conjunction with the
Police Department, decided to take a tougher
stand. Signs were ordered (like the one you
saw), and police began patrolling the area.
However, Burtness emphasized that they do
not want to keep everyone out, but simply "dis
courage damaging use."
To achieve this, a new system has been set
up. At the office of Land Resources in Encina
Hall, passes will be issued to Stanford people
who wish to use the area. These passes have a
list of DON'T DOs on the back. There is no
charge for a pass, and it will allow joggers and
walkers to use the land. This will continue un
less it is abused. So tread lightly, and don't dis
turb the cattle!
