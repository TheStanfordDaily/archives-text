# Cal, Cards both 1-3 in Pac-8
## Ransom leads Bears into Maples 
### Emilie Deutsch 
The California Bears will be in Maples Pavilion to
morrow night to face Stanford in the first basketball
meeting between the rivals this year. The two teams
have split their pair of games each of the last two
seasons, with the Bears winning the last game, 101 -91,
last season in Berkeley.
Tip-off tomorrow is 8 p.m., and the game will be
carried on KZSU-FM (90.1) and KSFO-AM (560).
This season both teams have engaged in close vic
tories — and defeats. Eleven of Stanford's 17 games
have been decided in the last minute and a half while
Cal has lost two of its last three games by two points
or less.
And those two losses gave the Bears the dubious
distinction of being the only Pacific-8 team to have a
losing record. But their 8-9 record (1-3 in Pac-8) does
not mean the Bears should be taken lightly. They have
four starters back from last season, and are the
second-highest scoring club in the conference.
'The Dream'
The guy responsible for many of Cal's points is

junior guard Gene "The Dream" Ransom. The
5-foot-9 guard is the Pac-B's second-leading scorer at
17.6 points a game and is also the second-leading
assist man at five per game.
"We'll attempt to contain him, not stop him," said
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso. "He assists or passes
when he can't shoot. He's a playmaker."
Sophomore forward Doug True is the team's top
rebounder with 9.7 a game, fourth-best in the confer
ence.
"Cal has a young team, but one with a great deal of
experience. Cal also has a lot of depth, and that ena
bles them to substitute freely," said Dißiaso.
For Stanford, the best rebounder and scorer is the
same player — sophomore forward Kimberly Belton.
Belton is sixth in the conference in both scoring and
rebounding with 14.8 and 8.5 averages. Belton has
made over 57 percent of his shots from the floor.
McHugh's hot
The hottest Card from the outside recently has
been center Jeff McHugh. In Pac-8 play, McHugh has
canned 58 percent of his shots, and his accuracy from

the outside has opened up the middle more for Bel
ton's power attack.
To go along with the Cards' improved inside
outside game, Dißiaso will have a team that is close to
100 percent physically sound. "We're as healthy as
we've been all season," said Dißiaso.
The Cards' improved health has given Dißiaso the
task of choosing among Belton, George Schader and
Jay Carter as his starting forwards.
In the backcourt, Wolfe Perry and Daryle Morgan
are slated to start. Morgan, who moved into the start
ing role when Paul Giovacchini injured his leg during
the Christmas schedule, has kept his starting spot
with good defensive and ball-handling perfor
mances.
With an 11-6 record, Stanford has already equalled
its victory total of each of the past two seasons. The
Cards have a good chance at securing Stanford's first
winning season in basketball since 1972-73 and only
the school's second winning season in 11 years.
Fhe outcome tomorrow could easily be a re-run of
those games won — and lost — in the last seconds.

Cdl's Gene Ransom and Stanford's lay Carter confront each
other in action from Cal's win in Harmon Gym last year.
The California Bears will be in Maples Pavilion to
morrow night to face Stanford in the first basketball
meeting between the rivals this year. The two teams
have split their pair of games each of the last two
seasons, with the Bears winning the last game, 101 -91,
last season in Berkeley.
Tip-off tomorrow is 8 p.m., and the game will be
carried on KZSU-FM (90.1) and KSFO-AM (560).
This season both teams have engaged in close vic
tories — and defeats. Eleven of Stanford's 17 games
have been decided in the last minute and a half while
Cal has lost two of its last three games by two points
or less.
And those two losses gave the Bears the dubious
distinction of being the only Pacific-8 team to have a
losing record. But their 8-9 record (1-3 in Pac-8) does
not mean the Bears should be taken lightly. They have
four starters back from last season, and are the
second-highest scoring club in the conference.
'The Dream'
The guy responsible for many of Cal's points is

junior guard Gene "The Dream" Ransom. The
5-foot-9 guard is the Pac-B's second-leading scorer at
17.6 points a game and is also the second-leading
assist man at five per game.
"We'll attempt to contain him, not stop him," said
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso. "He assists or passes
when he can't shoot. He's a playmaker."
Sophomore forward Doug True is the team's top
rebounder with 9.7 a game, fourth-best in the confer
ence.
"Cal has a young team, but one with a great deal of
experience. Cal also has a lot of depth, and that ena
bles them to substitute freely," said Dißiaso.
For Stanford, the best rebounder and scorer is the
same player — sophomore forward Kimberly Belton.
Belton is sixth in the conference in both scoring and
rebounding with 14.8 and 8.5 averages. Belton has
made over 57 percent of his shots from the floor.
McHugh's hot
The hottest Card from the outside recently has
been center Jeff McHugh. In Pac-8 play, McHugh has
canned 58 percent of his shots, and his accuracy from

the outside has opened up the middle more for Bel
ton's power attack.
To go along with the Cards' improved inside
outside game, Dißiaso will have a team that is close to
100 percent physically sound. "We're as healthy as
we've been all season," said Dißiaso.
The Cards' improved health has given Dißiaso the
task of choosing among Belton, George Schader and
Jay Carter as his starting forwards.
In the backcourt, Wolfe Perry and Daryle Morgan
are slated to start. Morgan, who moved into the start
ing role when Paul Giovacchini injured his leg during
the Christmas schedule, has kept his starting spot
with good defensive and ball-handling perfor
mances.
With an 11-6 record, Stanford has already equalled
its victory total of each of the past two seasons. The
Cards have a good chance at securing Stanford's first
winning season in basketball since 1972-73 and only
the school's second winning season in 11 years.
Fhe outcome tomorrow could easily be a re-run of
those games won — and lost — in the last seconds.
