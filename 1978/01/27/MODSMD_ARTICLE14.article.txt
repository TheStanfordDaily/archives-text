# Jogging injuries can be prevented
## 
### Jay Roach 
Trotting behind today's anti-flab
pro-fitness crusaders, the sport of
recreational running and jogging is
enjoying a burst in popularity that
has gotten more people away from
the front of television sets than
power shortages.
However, the increase in
dressed-out citizens who are run
ning and jogging has corresponded
predictably with an increase in post
jog visits to the doctor. Yes, even
jogging can be hazardous to your
health, but in most cases apparently,
it doesn't have to be.
Dr. K. Cordon Cambell, practicing
in sports medicine at the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic, said that jogging in
juries are common. The most com
mon are stress-related injuries
which he called "overloads on the
system."
"We like to use the analogy of a
mechanical system," explained Dr.
Campbell, who spends a lot of time
repairing Stanford athletes' "sys
tems." "Even a normal, healthy,
lower-leg structure has limits and
can be overloaded like any other sys
tem.
"If a normal system can be over
loaded," Campbell continued,
"then a system with inherent de
ficiencies, such as a fallen arch or a
patella (knee cap) problem, can cer

tainly be overloaded, too. Obvi
ously, the normal system can take
more stress."
According to Campbell, among
the more serious of the common
stress injuries are "stress fractures,"
defined as actual cracks in the bone
resulting from prolonged stress.
The doctor said, "People's bones
are like metal. If they are bent and
rebent, eventually they'll crack."
Stress fractures, which require
casts for proper healing, commonly
occur in the long bones of the foot
— the metatarsals. The fibula and
tibia, the two bones which run from
the ankle to the knee, are also prone
to stress fracture.
These types of fractures are
characterized by localized pain and
soreness, especially under stress.
Campbell said the localized nature
of the pain is distinguishable from
the general soreness typically ac
companyinganothercommon stress
injury, usually called "shin splints."
He said this term refers to an over
stretching of the white, sheath-like
fascia tissue which surrounds the
calf muscle and attaches it to the
tibia. This over-stretching can cause
microhemorrhaging and thus irrita
tion.
The amount of stress a system re
ceives increases as one runs harder
and more often, according to

Campbell. Running down hill on
hard surfaces definitely increases
stress, especially on the knees,
Campbell stated.
To minimize risk of stress frac
tures, shin splints and other related
injuries, such as Achilles' tendinitis
and heel spurs, Campbell pre
scribed running on soft surfaces,
wearing well-padded shoes with
proper arch support, running at a
looser gate, and using proper foot
placement. Rolling the foot upon
impact from heel to toe, instead of
"running up on your toes" like a
sprinter, minimizes the stress on the
metatarsals.
But these warnings should not
dissuade people from running.
Campbell said, "Jogging is a good,
overall fitness exercise to reduce fat
and make you lean. And it makes
you feel better."
Payton Jordan, Stanford's head
track coach, agreed with Campbell.
"Running provides a lot more value
than danger, but the dangers can't
be ignored," he said.
Jordan has authored a booklet en
titled "Running for Fun and Fitness
for Everyone." In this how-to-do-it
guide, Jordan emphasized that
"quality not quantity" of running is
important for conditioning and that
limited stress with efficient, effort

less running "is the best exercise for
anyone."
The dangers coach Jordan wrote
of rangefrom joggers' nipples — "an
irritating chapping or blistering of
the nipple caused by friction with
the cloth of a T-shirt or a warm-up
jacket that can be prevented by ap
plying petroleum jelly" — to stress
injuries and cardiac problems.
Jordan also prescribed systematic
warming up and moderation in gen
eral for everyone who runs.
Kathy Daggett, a conditioning in
structor here, said not only the
warm-up, but the warm-down" is
important. She said warm-downs
should include jogging after run
ning, walking after jogging, and
stretching after anything. In
adequate warm-downs are the cause
of much of the soreness experi
enced by runners.
Dr. Paul Thompson, a cardiology
fellow at the Stanford Medical
Center, stressed that the over-35
runner should be more cautious
than his younger counterparts.
Thompson, who ran in the U.S.
Olympic Trials in 1972, said mem
bers of over-35 age group should al
ways see a doctor before beginning
a conditioning program, especially if
other risk factors are present, such
as high blood pressure or choles
terol levels, and cigarette smoking.
