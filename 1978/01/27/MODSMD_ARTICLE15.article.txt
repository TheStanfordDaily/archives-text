# Trojans face Bruins with a shot for the top
## 
### 
The USC Trojans, the team
that won only two conference
basketball games during the
last two seasons, has an oppor
tunity tomorrow to move into
first place in the Pacific-8.
But to do so, the Trojans will
have to defeat UCLA in the
Bruins' Pauley Pavilion, a feat
USC last accomplished over
seven years ago. And even if
they do down the Bruins, USC
will only be in a tie with them
for the top spot, along with the
surprising Oregon State Beav
ers.
One of the principals re
sponsible for the Trojans' re
surgence is freshman center
Cliff Robinson. The 6-foot-9
Oakland product leads the
Pacific-8 in scoring with a 17.6
average, just ahead of Cal's
Gene Ransom. Last week,
Robinson scored 35 points and
grabbed 28 rebounds as the
Trojan's defeated Portland
State, 87-78. Both totals are
season highs for a Pac-8 player
this year, and the 28 rebounds
are the most by a freshman in
Pac-8 history.
"He's very active, very quick
and very strong," said USC
coach Bob Boyd. "He's got a
nice jump shot which enables
him to score away from the
basket." •
Robinson is also the third
best rebounder in the confer
ence with 9.8 retrievals per
game.
Robinson isn't the only
threat USC has — four other
Trojans have their scoring av
erage in double figures.
Meanwhile, the only
smudges on UCLA's record
this season have come at the
hands of other nations — two
losses against Notre Dame and
a one-point defeat against a
team from the Soviet Union.
The Bruins are rated sixth by
Associated Press.
UCLA's top scorer this sea
son is David Greenwood, the
6-9 frontliner who is averaging
over 17 points and 10 rebounds
a game. Right behind him is

Roy Hamilton, the Bruin guard
who is fourth-best in the con
ference with a 15.7 average and
is the top assist man with 6.1 a
game.
In the television game to
morrow, Washington State in
vades Hec Edmundson Pavilion
to face the Washington Hus
kies. Both teams are 1-3 and
have been bothered by injury
problems.
Kim Stewart, the Huskies'
leading scorer, rebounder and
assist man, suffered a season
ending knee injury last week
against Marquette. The
Cougars could be missing as
many as four regulars — wings
Don Collins and Clarence
Clark have been suspended
indefinitely and two guards are
sidelined with injuries.
Both Oregon schools are tak
ing a break from conference
action this week following
their foul-filled game of last
week. OSU hosts Portland
State and gunning Freeman
Williams tonight while Oregon
will try to get back on the win
ning track against UC-Davis
tomorrow.
