# Spartans stop Card women
## 
### Sukie Jackson 
When two longtime rivals
enter a basketball game with
2-0 records in the Northern
California Athletic League, los
ing hurts and someone is
bound to be disappointed.
That someone was Stanford as
they lost to the San Jose State
Lady Spartans in women's bas
ketball action Wednesday
night, 61-56.
Trailing by only a few baskets
throughout the first half the
Stanford women kept pace
with the talented San Jose
squad and took the lead, 22-21,
on a steal and basket by for
ward Renee Steiner with four
minutes remaining in the first
half. Turnovers and missed
free throw attempts troubled
the Cards all game and allowed
the Spartans to regain a three
point lead, making the score at
halftime, 30-27.
Starting strong in the second
half, San Jose widened its lead
to nine points with a 40-31
score six minutes into the half.
But Stanford's defense kept
the Spartans from running
away with the game. "We
played good defense," coach
Dottie McCrea said, "but we
couldn't generate any offense.
We didn't start playing until the
last seven minutes of the

game.
Inspired by the hustle of
guards Steiner and Beth
Boylan, Stanford rallied to
threaten the Spartan advantage
on several successful 15-foot
jump shots by center Maggie
Nelson. Stanford came within
six points of San Jose several
times in the last five minutes
but couldn't get any closer.
Sloppy, uncontrolled bas
ketball by both teams charac
terized the final minutes of the
game. The succession of steals
and turnovers which occurred
helped neither the Cards nor
the Spartans, though, and at
the final buzzer, Stanford re
mained down by five points.
In spite of the Spartan vic
tory, second-year San Jose
coach Sharon Chatman was
not pleased with her team's
performance. "We're young
like Stanford and at the end of
the game there was no discip
line," she said.
San Jose's 18 turnovers and
7-for-16 effort from the free
throw line seemed like minor
problems compared to Stan
ford's 31 turnovers and 18-for
-30 foul shooting performance
at the line. Assistant coach Sue
Rojcewicz attributed these er
rors to Stanford's "inexperi
ence in big games. It took us 30
minutes to loosen up," she
said.
Nelson made six of 12 from
the field to lead Stanford in
scoring with 17 points and had
seven rebounds. Kathy Mur
phy, the only other scorer in
double figures, added 12
points and 14 rebounds.
Leading San Jose in scoring

was Elinor Banks, the 6-foot-3
freshman from Stockton who
had the game high of 18 points,
along with 10 rebounds and
several well-timed, blocked
shots. Karen Mason, another
freshman added 13 points to
the Spartan total.
Wednesday's victory boosts
the Lady Spartans record to 7-7
overall and 3-0 in Nor-Cal
League. With only one senior
on its squad, San Jose's active
recruiting program has
brought them several talented
freshmen from as far as New
Zealand. Mandy Purnell, a 6-1
center, came to San Jose with
her fiance who plays center on
the men's team. The Spartans
now have four women on par
tial scholarship as compared to
two at Stanford.
Chatman said she consi
dered Stanford a "well
coached team" and noted that
the Cards have "much better
talent than last year." Disap
pointed with its loss, Stanford
will meet the Spartans later in
the season. "We get to play
them again and that's all we can
look for," coach McCrea said
after the game.
