# Swimmers head for Texas

### Andy Lowe 
Hopeful of not too warm a welcome from
Southern Methodist University, Texas and Texas
A&M, 40 members of the men's and women's
swim teams travel to the Lone Star State this
weekend for dual meet competitions today and
tomorrow.
"Those going to Texas have worked hard,
cleaning up the stadium after football games, to
generate funds making the trip possible," said
swim coach Jim Caughran. "We have not taken a
team trip of this sort for several years and we are
all looking forward to it. The opportunity to
swim indoors in fast pools the team excited
and I expect to see good performances in both
meets."
Following a noon arrival and luncheon today,
the Cards will visit the campus of SMU for sepa
rate dual meets between Stanford and SMU
men's and women's teams. The women will be
hosted in an afternoon meet by SMU's female
contingent, who will likely prove no match for
Stanford's highly-ranked team.
There will be no lack of excitement, though,
as numerous attempts at meeting national qual
ifying standards will be made. Native Texans
Laura Raymond and Margot Hagstette will lead
the Cards.
The SMU men's team, which meets Stanford
this evening, has long dominated Southwestern
Conference swimming and it consistently places
in the top 10 nationally. SMU pins its hopes on
captain Andy Veris, an All-American freestyler,
butterflier Bill Classtettler, who placed third at
last summer's AAU Nationals, and breaststroker

David Greenwood.
Once again, pressure will be placed on Stan
ford's Olympic gold medalist Mike Bruner in his
battles against Veris in the 200 yd. and 500 yd.

butterfly.
More than a good performance by Bruner will
be needed to insure a Cardinal victory. Unified
relay efforts, wins in the sprints and distance
free events, and "an upset or two," according to
Caughran, will be requisite.
Longhorns
On Saturday, Stanford will participate in a
double dual meet competition in Austin with the
University of Texas and Texas A&M. Both the
men and women will swim the same events at
the heralded new indoor pool complex at the
University of Texas. Although the women
should outclass both opponents, the men will
receive another tough test from a fast-improving
Texas team.
Picked to challenge SMU for the conference
title, Texas should be emotionally up against
slightly-favored Stanford. Several All-Americans
share the spotlight for the Longhorns: Darell
Fick (1.M., free style), Guy Hagstette (Margot's
brother, a backstroke specialist) and John
McMahon (breaststroke). Balanced relays and
the sprinting ability of freshman Mark Ruble will
also threaten Stanford's victory hopes.
The Cardinals return on Sunday to resume
heavy training in preparation for postseason
championships. Next weekend, Stanford travels
to Los Angeles to swim the nation's leading
teams, UCLA and USC.

meets."
Following a noon arrival and luncheon today,
the Cards will visit the campus of SMU for sepa
rate dual meets between Stanford and SMU
men's and women's teams. The women will be
hosted in an afternoon meet by SMU's female
contingent, who will likely prove no match for
Stanford's highly-ranked team.
There will be no lack of excitement, though,
as numerous attempts at meeting national qual
ifying standards will be made. Native Texans
Laura Raymond and Margot Hagstette will lead
the Cards.
The SMU men's team, which meets Stanford
this evening, has long dominated Southwestern
Conference swimming and it consistently places
in the top 10 nationally. SMU pins its hopes on
captain Andy Veris, an All-American freestyler,
butterflier Bill Classtettler, who placed third at
last summer's AAU Nationals, and breaststroker

David Greenwood.
Once again, pressure will be placed on Stan
ford's Olympic gold medalist Mike Bruner in his
battles against Veris in the 200 yd. and 500 yd.

butterfly.
More than a good performance by Bruner will
be needed to insure a Cardinal victory. Unified
relay efforts, wins in the sprints and distance
free events, and "an upset or two," according to
Caughran, will be requisite.
Longhorns
On Saturday, Stanford will participate in a
double dual meet competition in Austin with the
University of Texas and Texas A&M. Both the
men and women will swim the same events at
the heralded new indoor pool complex at the
University of Texas. Although the women
should outclass both opponents, the men will
receive another tough test from a fast-improving
Texas team.
Picked to challenge SMU for the conference
title, Texas should be emotionally up against
slightly-favored Stanford. Several All-Americans
share the spotlight for the Longhorns: Darell
Fick (1.M., free style), Guy Hagstette (Margot's
brother, a backstroke specialist) and John
McMahon (breaststroke). Balanced relays and
the sprinting ability of freshman Mark Ruble will
also threaten Stanford's victory hopes.
The Cardinals return on Sunday to resume
heavy training in preparation for postseason
championships. Next weekend, Stanford travels
to Los Angeles to swim the nation's leading
teams, UCLA and USC.

Stanford Olympian Mike Bruner will face All-American Andy Veris of
Southern Methodist University this evening in two freestyle events
when the Card men take on the Mustangs.
Hopeful of not too warm a welcome from
Southern Methodist University, Texas and Texas
A&M, 40 members of the men's and women's
swim teams travel to the Lone Star State this
weekend for dual meet competitions today and
tomorrow.
"Those going to Texas have worked hard,
cleaning up the stadium after football games, to
generate funds making the trip possible," said
swim coach Jim Caughran. "We have not taken a
team trip of this sort for several years and we are
all looking forward to it. The opportunity to
swim indoors in fast pools the team excited
and I expect to see good performances in both
meets."
