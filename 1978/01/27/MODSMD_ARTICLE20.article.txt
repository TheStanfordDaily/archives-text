# Stanford begins defense of volleyball crown
## 
### Ken Betts 
Men's volleyball, as a varsity
sport, is beginning its second
year at Stanford; prior to the
1976-77 season volleyball had
only a club sport status.
Last year's team was very
successful and had a 11-3 regu-

lar season record. The Cards
won the Northern California
Collegiate Volleyball League ti
tle. The Cards also won a bid to
the regionals, which is the first
time any northern California
school has been invited.
This year's Card squad is a

great deal younger than last
year's championship team.
Coach Art Lambert has only
three seniors on this team, and
he said, "I expect a great deal
of leadership from them." Ace
Edwards, Wendell Burkhoffer,
and Mike Watt, all seniors,
along with junior Rich Vardley,
are going to be the players who
have to add maturity to a team
loaded with freshmen and
sophomores.
Despite the youth of the
team, coach Lambert is looking
forward to improvement in the
areas of shot blocking and
overall team hustle. Lambert,
however, is not pleased with all
aspects of his team's play. The
Cardinals lost a good setter last
year and have had five different
players trying to master the de
licate art of setting before the
season begins.
Lambert said he feels the
Cardinals will improve
throughout the season as the
players gain experience. "This
team will be very scrappy and
aggressive," he said. "Their
overall attitude is tremend

ous."
Tonight, the Cardinals open
the season against the Stanis
laus State Warriors, a team that
joined the Nor-Cal district this
season. Lambert said he
doesn't know what to expect
from the Warriors, but he is
cognizant of the fact that they
could be extremely tough. "If
they have picked up a lot of
junior college transfers they
could be very, very tough, but
if, on the other hand, if they are
just starting from scratch then
they won't be quite as strong,"
he said.
The Cardinals' future oppo
nents will include conference
members Cal, Davis, Chico
State, Santa Clara, USF and
Fresno State. Of these foes, Cal
probably will offer the most
opposition to the Cardinals'
championship hopes.
The spikers will also face
some tough non-conference
opponents, including UCLA,
USC, Pepperdine and the
Japanese collegiate all-stars.
"We hope to have strong fan
support this year," Lambert
concluded.

joined the Nor-Cal district this
season. Lambert said he
doesn't know what to expect
from the Warriors, but he is
cognizant of the fact that they
could be extremely tough. "If
they have picked up a lot of
junior college transfers they
could be very, very tough, but
if, on the other hand, if they are
just starting from scratch then
they won't be quite as strong,"
he said.
The Cardinals' future oppo
nents will include conference
members Cal, Davis, Chico
State, Santa Clara, USF and
Fresno State. Of these foes, Cal
probably will offer the most
opposition to the Cardinals'
championship hopes.
The spikers will also face
some tough non-conference
opponents, including UCLA,
USC, Pepperdine and the
Japanese collegiate all-stars.
"We hope to have strong fan
support this year," Lambert
concluded.
