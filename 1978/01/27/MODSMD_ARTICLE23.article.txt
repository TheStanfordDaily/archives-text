The Stanford ice hockey team returned home this week from
Squaw Valley following an impressive showing in a round robin
tournament that featured Stanford, San Diego State, Cal North
ridge, and Brigham Young.
Stanford went undefeated in the tournament, beginning with a
6-3 win over Brigham Young in the opener. It was the first athletic
competition between the two schools in over eight years.
Player-coach Pat Baldwin, lay Johnston, Grove Nichols and Jay
Quimby scored for the Cardinals, while goaltender Gervin Peters
registered his first of three excellent games.
The second game proved to be much more physical as both Cal
State-Northridge and. Stanford amassed more penalty minutes
than in any other contest. Henry Dudley and Murray Kinney both
starred for the Cardinals who allowed only two shots on net after
the first period and won 5-2.
In the closest game of the tournament, Sari Diego State held
Stanford scoreless for over 216 periods, despite the fact that the
Cards outshot San Diego 10 to one. Stanford scored twice in the
third period to win, 2-1.
English teacher-defenseman Dave Lougee commented, "Be
fore the third period we just told ourselves not to press too hard,
not to panic, and, in point of fact, this strategy paid off."
"We definitely wanted to win all three games so as to leave no
doubts in anyone's mind who was the best at Squaw Valley this
year," said coach Baldwin. "This is probably the best, most ba
lanced team I've coached."
Yhe ice hockey team has enjoyed considerable success in re
cent years, as defenseman Gary Panton emphasized when he
said, "I've played on this team for three years and we've beaten
every college team we've played. Until some team can come
forward and beat us, I guess Stanford's the best college team on
the West Coast."
