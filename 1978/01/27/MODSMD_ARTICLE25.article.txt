Mideast negotiations may resume
Israel opened the door yesterday for resumption of
Israeli-Egyptian military negotiations next week and
Egypt launched a diplomatic offensive seeking world
support for its Mideast stand.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat told visiting officials
Israel's refusal to "recognize the Palestinians' right to
self-determination" is the major roadblock to peace.
Asst. Secretary of State Alfred Atherton, acting as go
between, said in Israel that he has made "good prog
ress" with the Israelis on drawing up a draft declaration
of principles and will fly to Cairo next week.
Egyptian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Boutros
Ghali summoned 26 African ambassadors to Cairo and
pressed for "African solidarity" with their northern
neighbor. Also being asked for support are envoys from
Latin America, East and West Europe, Asia and Arab
brethren.
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
told reporters he is concerned about a proposal by Sen.
Frank Church (D-ldaho), for the United States to freeze
arms shipments to the Mideast.
Church, high-ranking member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said Wednesday he felt the whole
question of Mideast arms sales should be revised. The
United States is Israel's chief supplier of military
hardware and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat has asked
the Carter administration to supply Cairo with equal
amounts of weapons.
Specialists seek Soviet satellite
Edmonton, Alberta — Defense Minister Barney Danson
said yesterday that debris from a Soviet satellite that fell
from orbit probably is on the ground in the Northwest
Territories emitting "extremely dangerous" levels of
radiation.
Canadian and American nuclear emergency
specialists headed toward a remote trading post in
Canada's far north where airborne scanners found un
usually high radioactivity.
Danson said in Ottawa there was a "90 percent
chance" the radiation came from the disintegrated
nuclear-powered Cosmos 954 orbiter, which carried 100
pounds of enriched uranium 235.
He said debris from the satellite has been tentatively
pinpointed in the Northwest Territories, about 200 miles
west of Baker Lake, an outpost of 1000 people in frozen
tundra country 1100 miles north of the U.S. border in

Minnesota.
A specially equipped Canadian military plane de
tected the radioactivity late Wednesday night while fly
ing over an area about 90 miles outside Baker Lake.
Canadian officials said the area did not appear to be
inhabited and the radiation posed no health hazard to
the Baker Lake community.
Dow jones hits 33-month low
New York — The stock market, giving up on a feeble
mid-week rally attempt, lapsed into a sharp decline yes
terday that left the Dow lones industrial average at a new
33-month low.
The Dow average of 30 industrials, which had crept up
.87 in each of the two previous sessions, fell 9.10 to
763.34.
That marked the average's lowest close since it
finished at 749.22 on April 8, 1975, and extended its loss
since New Year's to 67.83 points.
Experts see lower unemployment
Washington — Congressional economists say the na
tion's persistent unemployment problem is likely to be
solved within the next several years by sharply lower
growth in the labor force.
Such a radical development, they said in a report re
leased yesterday, could result in startling social
changes: less migration from the cold North to the Sun
Belt; more-flexible working conditions; more automa
tion; greater opportunities for under-skilled or older
workers, and, perhaps, a moving away from the
"materialism" of the 19705.
Because of a decline in birth rates since 1960, the study
said, annual growth in the number of Americans work
ing or looking for jobs will drop to less than 1 percent by
the 1980s. In fact, the report said, labor-force growth
peaked in 1977.
Unemployment dropped to 6.4 percent in December.
"Barring substantial future rises in birth rates or im
migration, U.S. population and labor force will virtually
stabilize within about 50 years," the "report stated.
HEW to finance some abortions
Washington — The government said yesterday that it
will help finance abortions for poor women who are
victims of rape or incest if someone reports the incident
to the proper authorities within 60 days of its occurr

ence.
The ruling by Health, Education and Welfare Secretary
Joseph Califano Jr., a personal foe of abortion, was wel
comed by pro-abortion groups as a fair and compassion
ate interpretation of abortion funding restrictions
enacted by Congress.
Spokesmen for the HEW general counsel's office said
Califano "was working against his own principles but
called every shot himself" to ensure that his department
is humane in carrying out the intent of Congress.
The law clearly permitted funding of abortions "where
the life of the mother would be endangered" or if two
physicians determine that her physical health would be
damaged severely and for a long period of time.
The regulations issued yesterday, will go into effect in
about two weeks.
N-plant gets boost from Senate
Sacramento — The state Senate voted yesterday to
exempt the proposed Sundesert nuclear power plant
from California's stringent nuclear safeguard laws.
The vote was the only positive sign in a week of set
backs for proponents of the 1900-megawatt pro|ect on
the Mojave Desert near Blythe.
The 21-10 Senate vote, the minimum needed for pas
sage, sent the bill to the Assembly, which has been much
more hostile than the Senate to nuclear power in recent
years.
The Senate vote came less than 24 hours after the State
Energy Commission refused to end a moratorium on
new atomic plants in California and refused to give an
exemption to the $2.3 billion Sundesert project.
Co-ops could get federal loans
Washington — The Carter administration changed
courses yesterday and announced it would support
legislation to provide federal loans to non-profit
cooperatives formed by consumers to provide them
selves with groceries or other retail services.
The administration's endorsement of the proposal
greatly increased its chances for approval by Congress.
The administration opposed the bill last year when it
passed the House by a single vote.
The legislation would establish a federal bank to ex
tend loans to consumers that band together to establish
a nonprofit grocery store or other type of retail service.
Assistant Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, who had
testified against the bill last year, told a Senate banking

subcommittee, "The administration now has a better
appreciation for the needs of consumer cooperatives
than we did last April."
Altman said the new position came after administra
tion officials visited a number of cooperatives around
the country to find out about their financing difficulties.
Conflict rages on Vietnam's border
Laem Sing, Thailand — While Vietnam has made a big
push in its border war with Cambodia in the Parrot's
Beak west of Saigon, refugees arriving here say the
Cambodians have penetrated into the south-western
corner of Vietnam, inflicting heavy casualties and forc
ing evacuation of the coastal town of Ha Tien.
Their accounts could not be independently con
firmed, but the radio Voice of Vietnam on Wednesday
referred to a Cambodian attack on Ha Tien and a nearby
village on Jan. 18. It gave no details.
Vietnamese and Cambodians fleeing to Thailand from
that area claim Ha Tien was all but deserted and every
day the dead and wounded were ferried on trucks and
boats from the battle areas.
Refugees arriving at this camp aboard small fishing
boats also say that when they escaped Jan. 13 the Cam
bodians had pushed nearly two miles into Vietnam along
a front north of Ha Tien and were shelling the town and
the surrounding areas regularly.
Carter backs transit program
Washington — President )immy Carter asked Congress
yesterday to authorize a five-year, $50-billion program
that he said would make federal aid to highways and
mass transit systems "simpler and more manageable."
In a special message, Carter said he wants to consoli
date more than 30 federal programs and give state and
local governments more flexibility in deciding how to
spend the money.
The complex package envisions five-year authoriza
tions of $35.6 billion for highways and $14.9 billion for
transit activities. However, local officials would have
leeway to use some highway funds for transit, or vice
versa.

Carter backs transit program
Washington — President )immy Carter asked Congress
yesterday to authorize a five-year, $50-billion program
that he said would make federal aid to highways and
mass transit systems "simpler and more manageable."
In a special message, Carter said he wants to consoli
date more than 30 federal programs and give state and
local governments more flexibility in deciding how to
spend the money.
The complex package envisions five-year authoriza
tions of $35.6 billion for highways and $14.9 billion for
transit activities. However, local officials would have
leeway to use some highway funds for transit, or vice
versa.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with occasional high clouds.
Lows in the 30s and 40s. Highs in the mid 50s to low 60s.
Light winds.
Mideast negotiations may resume
Israel opened the door yesterday for resumption of
Israeli-Egyptian military negotiations next week and
Egypt launched a diplomatic offensive seeking world
support for its Mideast stand.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat told visiting officials
Israel's refusal to "recognize the Palestinians' right to
self-determination" is the major roadblock to peace.
Asst. Secretary of State Alfred Atherton, acting as go
between, said in Israel that he has made "good prog
ress" with the Israelis on drawing up a draft declaration
of principles and will fly to Cairo next week.
Egyptian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Boutros
Ghali summoned 26 African ambassadors to Cairo and
pressed for "African solidarity" with their northern
neighbor. Also being asked for support are envoys from
Latin America, East and West Europe, Asia and Arab
brethren.
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
told reporters he is concerned about a proposal by Sen.
Frank Church (D-ldaho), for the United States to freeze
arms shipments to the Mideast.
Church, high-ranking member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said Wednesday he felt the whole
question of Mideast arms sales should be revised. The
United States is Israel's chief supplier of military
hardware and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat has asked
the Carter administration to supply Cairo with equal
amounts of weapons.
Specialists seek Soviet satellite
Edmonton, Alberta — Defense Minister Barney Danson
said yesterday that debris from a Soviet satellite that fell
from orbit probably is on the ground in the Northwest
Territories emitting "extremely dangerous" levels of
radiation.
Canadian and American nuclear emergency
specialists headed toward a remote trading post in
Canada's far north where airborne scanners found un
usually high radioactivity.
Danson said in Ottawa there was a "90 percent
chance" the radiation came from the disintegrated
nuclear-powered Cosmos 954 orbiter, which carried 100
pounds of enriched uranium 235.
He said debris from the satellite has been tentatively
pinpointed in the Northwest Territories, about 200 miles
west of Baker Lake, an outpost of 1000 people in frozen
tundra country 1100 miles north of the U.S. border in

Minnesota.
A specially equipped Canadian military plane de
tected the radioactivity late Wednesday night while fly
ing over an area about 90 miles outside Baker Lake.
Canadian officials said the area did not appear to be
inhabited and the radiation posed no health hazard to
the Baker Lake community.
Dow jones hits 33-month low
New York — The stock market, giving up on a feeble
mid-week rally attempt, lapsed into a sharp decline yes
terday that left the Dow lones industrial average at a new
33-month low.
The Dow average of 30 industrials, which had crept up
.87 in each of the two previous sessions, fell 9.10 to
763.34.
That marked the average's lowest close since it
finished at 749.22 on April 8, 1975, and extended its loss
since New Year's to 67.83 points.
Experts see lower unemployment
Washington — Congressional economists say the na
tion's persistent unemployment problem is likely to be
solved within the next several years by sharply lower
growth in the labor force.
Such a radical development, they said in a report re
leased yesterday, could result in startling social
changes: less migration from the cold North to the Sun
Belt; more-flexible working conditions; more automa
tion; greater opportunities for under-skilled or older
workers, and, perhaps, a moving away from the
"materialism" of the 19705.
Because of a decline in birth rates since 1960, the study
said, annual growth in the number of Americans work
ing or looking for jobs will drop to less than 1 percent by
the 1980s. In fact, the report said, labor-force growth
peaked in 1977.
Unemployment dropped to 6.4 percent in December.
"Barring substantial future rises in birth rates or im
migration, U.S. population and labor force will virtually
stabilize within about 50 years," the "report stated.
HEW to finance some abortions
Washington — The government said yesterday that it
will help finance abortions for poor women who are
victims of rape or incest if someone reports the incident
to the proper authorities within 60 days of its occurr

ence.
The ruling by Health, Education and Welfare Secretary
Joseph Califano Jr., a personal foe of abortion, was wel
comed by pro-abortion groups as a fair and compassion
ate interpretation of abortion funding restrictions
enacted by Congress.
Spokesmen for the HEW general counsel's office said
Califano "was working against his own principles but
called every shot himself" to ensure that his department
is humane in carrying out the intent of Congress.
The law clearly permitted funding of abortions "where
the life of the mother would be endangered" or if two
physicians determine that her physical health would be
damaged severely and for a long period of time.
The regulations issued yesterday, will go into effect in
about two weeks.
N-plant gets boost from Senate
Sacramento — The state Senate voted yesterday to
exempt the proposed Sundesert nuclear power plant
from California's stringent nuclear safeguard laws.
The vote was the only positive sign in a week of set
backs for proponents of the 1900-megawatt pro|ect on
the Mojave Desert near Blythe.
The 21-10 Senate vote, the minimum needed for pas
sage, sent the bill to the Assembly, which has been much
more hostile than the Senate to nuclear power in recent
years.
The Senate vote came less than 24 hours after the State
Energy Commission refused to end a moratorium on
new atomic plants in California and refused to give an
exemption to the $2.3 billion Sundesert project.
Co-ops could get federal loans
Washington — The Carter administration changed
courses yesterday and announced it would support
legislation to provide federal loans to non-profit
cooperatives formed by consumers to provide them
selves with groceries or other retail services.
The administration's endorsement of the proposal
greatly increased its chances for approval by Congress.
The administration opposed the bill last year when it
passed the House by a single vote.
The legislation would establish a federal bank to ex
tend loans to consumers that band together to establish
a nonprofit grocery store or other type of retail service.
Assistant Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, who had
testified against the bill last year, told a Senate banking

subcommittee, "The administration now has a better
appreciation for the needs of consumer cooperatives
than we did last April."
Altman said the new position came after administra
tion officials visited a number of cooperatives around
the country to find out about their financing difficulties.
Conflict rages on Vietnam's border
Laem Sing, Thailand — While Vietnam has made a big
push in its border war with Cambodia in the Parrot's
Beak west of Saigon, refugees arriving here say the
Cambodians have penetrated into the south-western
corner of Vietnam, inflicting heavy casualties and forc
ing evacuation of the coastal town of Ha Tien.
Their accounts could not be independently con
firmed, but the radio Voice of Vietnam on Wednesday
referred to a Cambodian attack on Ha Tien and a nearby
village on Jan. 18. It gave no details.
Vietnamese and Cambodians fleeing to Thailand from
that area claim Ha Tien was all but deserted and every
day the dead and wounded were ferried on trucks and
boats from the battle areas.
Refugees arriving at this camp aboard small fishing
boats also say that when they escaped Jan. 13 the Cam

Conflict rages on Vietnam's border
Laem Sing, Thailand — While Vietnam has made a big
push in its border war with Cambodia in the Parrot's
Beak west of Saigon, refugees arriving here say the
Cambodians have penetrated into the south-western
corner of Vietnam, inflicting heavy casualties and forc
ing evacuation of the coastal town of Ha Tien.
Their accounts could not be independently con
firmed, but the radio Voice of Vietnam on Wednesday
referred to a Cambodian attack on Ha Tien and a nearby
village on Jan. 18. It gave no details.
Vietnamese and Cambodians fleeing to Thailand from
that area claim Ha Tien was all but deserted and every
day the dead and wounded were ferried on trucks and
boats from the battle areas.
Refugees arriving at this camp aboard small fishing
boats also say that when they escaped Jan. 13 the Cam
bodians had pushed nearly two miles into Vietnam along
a front north of Ha Tien and were shelling the town and
the surrounding areas regularly.
Carter backs transit program
Washington — President )immy Carter asked Congress
yesterday to authorize a five-year, $50-billion program
that he said would make federal aid to highways and
mass transit systems "simpler and more manageable."
In a special message, Carter said he wants to consoli
date more than 30 federal programs and give state and
local governments more flexibility in deciding how to
spend the money.
The complex package envisions five-year authoriza
tions of $35.6 billion for highways and $14.9 billion for
transit activities. However, local officials would have
leeway to use some highway funds for transit, or vice
versa.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with occasional high clouds.
Lows in the 30s and 40s. Highs in the mid 50s to low 60s.
Light winds.
Mideast negotiations may resume
Israel opened the door yesterday for resumption of
Israeli-Egyptian military negotiations next week and
Egypt launched a diplomatic offensive seeking world
support for its Mideast stand.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat told visiting officials
Israel's refusal to "recognize the Palestinians' right to
self-determination" is the major roadblock to peace.
Asst. Secretary of State Alfred Atherton, acting as go
between, said in Israel that he has made "good prog
ress" with the Israelis on drawing up a draft declaration
of principles and will fly to Cairo next week.
Egyptian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Boutros
Ghali summoned 26 African ambassadors to Cairo and
pressed for "African solidarity" with their northern
neighbor. Also being asked for support are envoys from
Latin America, East and West Europe, Asia and Arab
brethren.
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
told reporters he is concerned about a proposal by Sen.
Frank Church (D-ldaho), for the United States to freeze
arms shipments to the Mideast.
Church, high-ranking member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said Wednesday he felt the whole
question of Mideast arms sales should be revised. The
United States is Israel's chief supplier of military
hardware and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat has asked
the Carter administration to supply Cairo with equal
amounts of weapons.
Specialists seek Soviet satellite
Edmonton, Alberta — Defense Minister Barney Danson
said yesterday that debris from a Soviet satellite that fell
from orbit probably is on the ground in the Northwest
Territories emitting "extremely dangerous" levels of
radiation.
Canadian and American nuclear emergency
specialists headed toward a remote trading post in
Canada's far north where airborne scanners found un
usually high radioactivity.
Danson said in Ottawa there was a "90 percent
chance" the radiation came from the disintegrated
nuclear-powered Cosmos 954 orbiter, which carried 100
pounds of enriched uranium 235.
He said debris from the satellite has been tentatively
pinpointed in the Northwest Territories, about 200 miles
west of Baker Lake, an outpost of 1000 people in frozen
tundra country 1100 miles north of the U.S. border in

Minnesota.
A specially equipped Canadian military plane de
tected the radioactivity late Wednesday night while fly
ing over an area about 90 miles outside Baker Lake.
Canadian officials said the area did not appear to be
inhabited and the radiation posed no health hazard to
the Baker Lake community.
Dow jones hits 33-month low
New York — The stock market, giving up on a feeble
mid-week rally attempt, lapsed into a sharp decline yes
terday that left the Dow lones industrial average at a new
33-month low.
The Dow average of 30 industrials, which had crept up
.87 in each of the two previous sessions, fell 9.10 to
763.34.
That marked the average's lowest close since it
finished at 749.22 on April 8, 1975, and extended its loss
since New Year's to 67.83 points.
Experts see lower unemployment
Washington — Congressional economists say the na
tion's persistent unemployment problem is likely to be
solved within the next several years by sharply lower
growth in the labor force.
Such a radical development, they said in a report re
leased yesterday, could result in startling social
changes: less migration from the cold North to the Sun
Belt; more-flexible working conditions; more automa
tion; greater opportunities for under-skilled or older
workers, and, perhaps, a moving away from the
"materialism" of the 19705.
Because of a decline in birth rates since 1960, the study
said, annual growth in the number of Americans work
ing or looking for jobs will drop to less than 1 percent by
the 1980s. In fact, the report said, labor-force growth
peaked in 1977.
Unemployment dropped to 6.4 percent in December.
"Barring substantial future rises in birth rates or im
migration, U.S. population and labor force will virtually
stabilize within about 50 years," the "report stated.
HEW to finance some abortions
Washington — The government said yesterday that it
will help finance abortions for poor women who are
victims of rape or incest if someone reports the incident
to the proper authorities within 60 days of its occurr

ence.
The ruling by Health, Education and Welfare Secretary
Joseph Califano Jr., a personal foe of abortion, was wel
comed by pro-abortion groups as a fair and compassion
ate interpretation of abortion funding restrictions
enacted by Congress.
Spokesmen for the HEW general counsel's office said
Califano "was working against his own principles but
called every shot himself" to ensure that his department
is humane in carrying out the intent of Congress.
The law clearly permitted funding of abortions "where
the life of the mother would be endangered" or if two
physicians determine that her physical health would be
damaged severely and for a long period of time.
The regulations issued yesterday, will go into effect in
about two weeks.
N-plant gets boost from Senate
Sacramento — The state Senate voted yesterday to
exempt the proposed Sundesert nuclear power plant
from California's stringent nuclear safeguard laws.
The vote was the only positive sign in a week of set
backs for proponents of the 1900-megawatt pro|ect on
the Mojave Desert near Blythe.
The 21-10 Senate vote, the minimum needed for pas
sage, sent the bill to the Assembly, which has been much
more hostile than the Senate to nuclear power in recent
years.
The Senate vote came less than 24 hours after the State
Energy Commission refused to end a moratorium on
new atomic plants in California and refused to give an
exemption to the $2.3 billion Sundesert project.
Co-ops could get federal loans
Washington — The Carter administration changed
courses yesterday and announced it would support
legislation to provide federal loans to non-profit
cooperatives formed by consumers to provide them
selves with groceries or other retail services.
The administration's endorsement of the proposal
greatly increased its chances for approval by Congress.
The administration opposed the bill last year when it
passed the House by a single vote.
The legislation would establish a federal bank to ex
tend loans to consumers that band together to establish
a nonprofit grocery store or other type of retail service.

about two weeks.
N-plant gets boost from Senate
Sacramento — The state Senate voted yesterday to
exempt the proposed Sundesert nuclear power plant
from California's stringent nuclear safeguard laws.
The vote was the only positive sign in a week of set
backs for proponents of the 1900-megawatt pro|ect on
the Mojave Desert near Blythe.
The 21-10 Senate vote, the minimum needed for pas
sage, sent the bill to the Assembly, which has been much
more hostile than the Senate to nuclear power in recent
years.
The Senate vote came less than 24 hours after the State
Energy Commission refused to end a moratorium on
new atomic plants in California and refused to give an
exemption to the $2.3 billion Sundesert project.
Co-ops could get federal loans
Washington — The Carter administration changed
courses yesterday and announced it would support
legislation to provide federal loans to non-profit
cooperatives formed by consumers to provide them
selves with groceries or other retail services.
The administration's endorsement of the proposal
greatly increased its chances for approval by Congress.
The administration opposed the bill last year when it
passed the House by a single vote.
The legislation would establish a federal bank to ex
tend loans to consumers that band together to establish
a nonprofit grocery store or other type of retail service.
Assistant Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, who had
testified against the bill last year, told a Senate banking

subcommittee, "The administration now has a better
appreciation for the needs of consumer cooperatives
than we did last April."
Altman said the new position came after administra
tion officials visited a number of cooperatives around
the country to find out about their financing difficulties.
Conflict rages on Vietnam's border
Laem Sing, Thailand — While Vietnam has made a big
push in its border war with Cambodia in the Parrot's
Beak west of Saigon, refugees arriving here say the
Cambodians have penetrated into the south-western
corner of Vietnam, inflicting heavy casualties and forc
ing evacuation of the coastal town of Ha Tien.
Their accounts could not be independently con
firmed, but the radio Voice of Vietnam on Wednesday
referred to a Cambodian attack on Ha Tien and a nearby
village on Jan. 18. It gave no details.
Vietnamese and Cambodians fleeing to Thailand from
that area claim Ha Tien was all but deserted and every
day the dead and wounded were ferried on trucks and
boats from the battle areas.
Refugees arriving at this camp aboard small fishing
boats also say that when they escaped Jan. 13 the Cam
bodians had pushed nearly two miles into Vietnam along
a front north of Ha Tien and were shelling the town and
the surrounding areas regularly.
Carter backs transit program
Washington — President )immy Carter asked Congress
yesterday to authorize a five-year, $50-billion program
that he said would make federal aid to highways and
mass transit systems "simpler and more manageable."
In a special message, Carter said he wants to consoli
date more than 30 federal programs and give state and
local governments more flexibility in deciding how to
spend the money.
The complex package envisions five-year authoriza
tions of $35.6 billion for highways and $14.9 billion for
transit activities. However, local officials would have
leeway to use some highway funds for transit, or vice
versa.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with occasional high clouds.
Lows in the 30s and 40s. Highs in the mid 50s to low 60s.

Mideast negotiations may resume
Israel opened the door yesterday for resumption of
Israeli-Egyptian military negotiations next week and
Egypt launched a diplomatic offensive seeking world
support for its Mideast stand.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat told visiting officials
Israel's refusal to "recognize the Palestinians' right to
self-determination" is the major roadblock to peace.
Asst. Secretary of State Alfred Atherton, acting as go
between, said in Israel that he has made "good prog
ress" with the Israelis on drawing up a draft declaration
of principles and will fly to Cairo next week.
Egyptian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Boutros
Ghali summoned 26 African ambassadors to Cairo and
pressed for "African solidarity" with their northern
neighbor. Also being asked for support are envoys from
Latin America, East and West Europe, Asia and Arab
brethren.
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
told reporters he is concerned about a proposal by Sen.
Frank Church (D-ldaho), for the United States to freeze
arms shipments to the Mideast.
Church, high-ranking member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said Wednesday he felt the whole
question of Mideast arms sales should be revised. The
United States is Israel's chief supplier of military
hardware and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat has asked
the Carter administration to supply Cairo with equal
amounts of weapons.
Specialists seek Soviet satellite
Edmonton, Alberta — Defense Minister Barney Danson
said yesterday that debris from a Soviet satellite that fell
from orbit probably is on the ground in the Northwest
Territories emitting "extremely dangerous" levels of
radiation.
Canadian and American nuclear emergency
specialists headed toward a remote trading post in
Canada's far north where airborne scanners found un
usually high radioactivity.
Danson said in Ottawa there was a "90 percent
chance" the radiation came from the disintegrated
nuclear-powered Cosmos 954 orbiter, which carried 100
pounds of enriched uranium 235.
He said debris from the satellite has been tentatively
pinpointed in the Northwest Territories, about 200 miles
west of Baker Lake, an outpost of 1000 people in frozen
tundra country 1100 miles north of the U.S. border in

Minnesota.
A specially equipped Canadian military plane de
tected the radioactivity late Wednesday night while fly
ing over an area about 90 miles outside Baker Lake.
Canadian officials said the area did not appear to be
inhabited and the radiation posed no health hazard to
the Baker Lake community.
Dow jones hits 33-month low
New York — The stock market, giving up on a feeble
mid-week rally attempt, lapsed into a sharp decline yes
terday that left the Dow lones industrial average at a new
33-month low.
The Dow average of 30 industrials, which had crept up
.87 in each of the two previous sessions, fell 9.10 to
763.34.
That marked the average's lowest close since it
finished at 749.22 on April 8, 1975, and extended its loss
since New Year's to 67.83 points.
Experts see lower unemployment
Washington — Congressional economists say the na
tion's persistent unemployment problem is likely to be
solved within the next several years by sharply lower
growth in the labor force.
Such a radical development, they said in a report re
leased yesterday, could result in startling social
changes: less migration from the cold North to the Sun
Belt; more-flexible working conditions; more automa
tion; greater opportunities for under-skilled or older
workers, and, perhaps, a moving away from the
"materialism" of the 19705.
Because of a decline in birth rates since 1960, the study
said, annual growth in the number of Americans work
ing or looking for jobs will drop to less than 1 percent by
the 1980s. In fact, the report said, labor-force growth
peaked in 1977.
Unemployment dropped to 6.4 percent in December.
"Barring substantial future rises in birth rates or im
migration, U.S. population and labor force will virtually
stabilize within about 50 years," the "report stated.
HEW to finance some abortions
Washington — The government said yesterday that it
will help finance abortions for poor women who are
victims of rape or incest if someone reports the incident
to the proper authorities within 60 days of its occurr

ence.
The ruling by Health, Education and Welfare Secretary
Joseph Califano Jr., a personal foe of abortion, was wel
comed by pro-abortion groups as a fair and compassion
ate interpretation of abortion funding restrictions
enacted by Congress.
Spokesmen for the HEW general counsel's office said
Califano "was working against his own principles but
called every shot himself" to ensure that his department
is humane in carrying out the intent of Congress.
The law clearly permitted funding of abortions "where
the life of the mother would be endangered" or if two
physicians determine that her physical health would be
damaged severely and for a long period of time.
The regulations issued yesterday, will go into effect in
about two weeks.
