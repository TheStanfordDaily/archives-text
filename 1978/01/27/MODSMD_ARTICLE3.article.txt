# Congressional bills seek to alter control of native American lands
## 
### Lane Webster 
Native American students are
keeping wary eyes on four bills now
in Congress that aim to alter jurisdic
tion of tribal lands.
"If these bills go through," said
David Eisenberg, a native American
student of the Taos Pueblo tribe,
"any treaties ever signed will be
abolished."
The most controversial bill, intro
duced by Rep. Jack Cunningham
(R-Wash.), orders the president to
"abrogate all treaties entered into
between the United States and any
Indian tribe."
"What it does," said Eisenberg, "is
take away any sovereignty any native
American people have over their
tribes."
'Fill that void'
"The question of land rights has
never been defined," said Drew Pet
tus, legislative assistant to Rep. Lloyd
Meeds (D-Wash). He said the legisla
tion seeks to "fill that void" by quan
tifying land rights, as well as fishing,
hunting, water and civil rights, he
said.
But native Americans feel these
bills are just one more attempt to
squeeze them out of their land and
threaten their culture.
The law will change the category of
the land, said Larry Gorospe, assis
tant dean of student affairs, a native
American himself.

"It'll be taxable land," he said. "If
I'm poor, I'd have to sell my land.
That's how they break the tax base of
the native Americans," he explained.
"They lose the status of trust land."
Eisenberg recalled one example of
the pressure tribes continually face
regarding their land. Without per
mission, a company began to set up
campsites and tours on his
property, said Eisenberg.
"This land was very sacred to us,"
he said. One of the company's spon
sors was Sen. Clinton Anderson of
New Mexico, who "had a definite fi
nancial interest in the land," he
maintained. The plan was to let the
tribe have "one monthly pilgrim
age," until Sen. Henry Jackson (D-
Wash.) stepped in to halt the prop
osal, he said.
'Super citizens'
"The U.S. has always been a coun
try of equals," said Bruce Addison,
Cunningham's assistant. Interpreta
tions of treaties have given native
Americans "special rights," making
them "super citizens," he said.
Addison said the "close relation
ship" necessary to dispense federal
funds between tribal leaders and the
Bureau of Indian Affairs has become
in some instances "almost corrupt."
"It's a complicated subject; it's an
emotional subject," said Pettus. He
added he wants the native Americans
to have enough government power

to preserve their culture.
But problems arise when cities use
water springing from native Ameri
can land, when sportsmen ask to
hunt and fish on tribal land and when
tribes sell portions of their territory
to developers, he said. The difficult
goal, he added, is to "derive equity
on both sides of the situation."
Flipflopping
When asked why such legislation
has come forward now, Addison
said, "We made it as a campaign
promise."
Eisenberg pointed out Cunnin
gham's and Meed's status as
freshman congressmen up for
reelection. He said he believes,
"They have to introduce bills that will
satisfy the great majority of voters.
They're flipflopping, in other
words," he added.
Next month, native Americans ac
ross the United States will participate
in "The Longest Walk," a relay start
ing in San Francisco and ending in
Washington D.C. Gorospe himself
has offered to leg out 10 miles to help
publicize the native American posi
tion.
Native Americans want the option
of enjoying a culture in which
"people sat down and talked with
each other," where it wss a family
chore just to haul water, he said. "It's
a whole different existence," he ad
ded.

The law will change the category of
the land, said Larry Gorospe, assis
tant dean of student affairs, a native
American himself.

"It'll be taxable land," he said. "If
I'm poor, I'd have to sell my land.
That's how they break the tax base of
the native Americans," he explained.
"They lose the status of trust land."
Eisenberg recalled one example of
the pressure tribes continually face
regarding their land. Without per
mission, a company began to set up
campsites and tours on his
property, said Eisenberg.
"This land was very sacred to us,"
he said. One of the company's spon
sors was Sen. Clinton Anderson of
New Mexico, who "had a definite fi
nancial interest in the land," he
maintained. The plan was to let the
tribe have "one monthly pilgrim
age," until Sen. Henry Jackson (D-
Wash.) stepped in to halt the prop
osal, he said.
'Super citizens'
"The U.S. has always been a coun
try of equals," said Bruce Addison,
Cunningham's assistant. Interpreta
tions of treaties have given native
Americans "special rights," making
them "super citizens," he said.
Addison said the "close relation
ship" necessary to dispense federal
funds between tribal leaders and the
Bureau of Indian Affairs has become
in some instances "almost corrupt."
"It's a complicated subject; it's an
emotional subject," said Pettus. He
added he wants the native Americans
to have enough government power

to preserve their culture.
But problems arise when cities use
water springing from native Ameri
can land, when sportsmen ask to
hunt and fish on tribal land and when
tribes sell portions of their territory
to developers, he said. The difficult
goal, he added, is to "derive equity
on both sides of the situation."
Flipflopping
When asked why such legislation
has come forward now, Addison
said, "We made it as a campaign
promise."
Eisenberg pointed out Cunnin
gham's and Meed's status as
freshman congressmen up for
reelection. He said he believes,
"They have to introduce bills that will
satisfy the great majority of voters.
They're flipflopping, in other
words," he added.
Next month, native Americans ac
ross the United States will participate
in "The Longest Walk," a relay start
ing in San Francisco and ending in
Washington D.C. Gorospe himself
has offered to leg out 10 miles to help
publicize the native American posi
tion.
Native Americans want the option
of enjoying a culture in which
"people sat down and talked with
each other," where it wss a family
chore just to haul water, he said. "It's
a whole different existence," he ad
ded.
Native American students are
keeping wary eyes on four bills now
in Congress that aim to alter jurisdic
tion of tribal lands.
"If these bills go through," said
David Eisenberg, a native American
student of the Taos Pueblo tribe,
"any treaties ever signed will be
abolished."
The most controversial bill, intro
duced by Rep. Jack Cunningham
(R-Wash.), orders the president to
"abrogate all treaties entered into
between the United States and any
Indian tribe."
"What it does," said Eisenberg, "is
take away any sovereignty any native
American people have over their
tribes."
'Fill that void'
"The question of land rights has
never been defined," said Drew Pet
tus, legislative assistant to Rep. Lloyd
Meeds (D-Wash). He said the legisla
tion seeks to "fill that void" by quan
tifying land rights, as well as fishing,
hunting, water and civil rights, he
said.
But native Americans feel these
bills are just one more attempt to
squeeze them out of their land and
threaten their culture.
