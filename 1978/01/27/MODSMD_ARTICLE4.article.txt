# Blizzard kills 16 in northern U.S.
## 
### Associated Press 
A deadly blizzard devastated much
of the northern part of the United
States yesterday, while hurricane
force winds swept through the
South. At least 16 persons were killed
in the storms.
The northern blizzard was so se
vere— "one of the strongest in many
years," according to the National
Weather Service — that saving lives
was the top priority of thousands of
rescue workers activated across the
North.
Gov. James Rhodes of Ohio called
out the National Guard for "the most
comprehensive emergency that
we've ever had." He said his greatest
fear was "the elderly and senior citi
zens being stranded without food or
heat."
He asked people to check on el
derly neighbors. "Our fear is some of
these people being trapped. Call the
local armory and we shall get them
out."
'Certain death'
"Being lost in open country during
a blizzard is almost certain death,"
the weather service cautioned.
Wisconsin authorities were
flooded with more requests for help
than they could handle. Hundreds of
residents were stuck in cars, but offi
cials didn't have the manpower to get
them out.
"If you go out, even for an
emergency, you are on your own,"
said Vic Gherke, traffic chief for the
Dodge County, Wis., sheriff's de
partment. "You can expect no help."
An official in another county who
would not give her name over the
telephone said:
'Dollar mightier than safety'
"I've got roads closed. I've got
plows stuck. We're trying to get
people to stay home, but they say
they've got to get to work. The dollar
is mightier than safety, I guess."
Sixteen weather-related deaths
were reported since the storm first
hit Wednesday night: three were in
Alabama, three in Michigan, two in
Georgia, two in Kentucky; one in
North Dakota, and one each in Il
linois, Tennessee, Maine, Minnesota
and Virginia.
Snowfalls ranging from four inches
up to a foot were reported from
North Dakota across the Northern
half of the nation into the Northeast.
The storm was moving into western
Pennsylvania and New York during
the afternoon.
Indiana declared a statewide
emergency, and Indianapolis was
almost a ghost town with businesses
closing and bars, restaurants and
hotels filling up.
Roofs collapsed
Schools, businesses, highways
and back roads were shut down. Air
ports were closed or operated with
reduced flights. Trains ran late.
Power outages were reported. Some
newspapers curtailed publication.
Several roofs collapsed under heavy
snow and strong winds.
The National Weather Service in

Ohio reported that the blizzard with
winds up to 70 mph was the strongest
to pass over the state in the 100 years
that records have been kept.
Record low barometer readings —
indicating wet weather on the way —
were reported from Georgia, north
ern New York and Michigan.
A 3-year-old boy was killed in Vir
ginia when a tornado touched down
at a trailer park near the Quantico
Marine base. Two members of his
family were injured.
Rivers swollen
More than 1000 persons were
evacuated from their homes in West
Virginia as a heavy rain coupled with
melting snow swelled rivers and
streams over their banks.
The state requested that "nones
sential travel be stopped" as the
northern show storm was pushed
into West Virginia by 60-mile-ap
hour winds, adding to the problems
already created by flooding.
Rainand high winds were common
along the East Coast from Florida up
through New England. Many of those
areas braced themselves for an ex
pected onslaught of snow during the
day.
