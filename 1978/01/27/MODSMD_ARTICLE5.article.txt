# Marry a student: get tickets, housing, other spouse benefits

"Two student tickets to the Flicks,
please," Ann requested, sliding her $1.50
through the semicircular window.
"Sure," the ticket-seller smiled oblig
ingly. "Can I see your IDs? Oh, the young
man's not a student? And you're not mar
ried? Sorry then, he'll have to pay the regu
lar price. Two dollars, please."
Ann and Mike (not their real names) have
lived together for over five years. Ann is a
graduate student at Stanford and her boy
friend, Mike, is working off campus, help
ing to support Ann's education. They pre
fer not to get married — at least not for the
time being.
"We feel our relationship is no less
genuine because we haven't gone through
the social ritual," Ann contends. "We just
each prefer to keep our own identities, our
own independence."
Maintaining their independence,
couples like Ann and Mike claim, is one of
the advantages of not getting married. But
there are disadvantages as well. Paying a
higher price for a ticket to the Flicks used to
be one example.
Subsidy
Ann contends that marital status should
not be a factor in determining who should
pay what price for a ticket — or for anything
else. By offering ticket discounts and other
privileges to student spouses, Ann claims,
Stanford is subsidizing marriage.
"Stanford is rewarding a group of people
solely on the basis of the lifestyle they
choose," she maintains.
After checking with several departments
and organizations on campus, it is clear
that Stanford does offer many privileges
and benefits to student spouses. A key to

many of the privileges is the spouse card,
issued quarterly by the registrar's office.
"Our office automatically generates a
spouse card if the student indicates on his
registration card that he's married," Gloria
Caring, assistant registrar, explained. Dur
ing autumn quarter, she said, her office
issued 2376 spouse cards.
Garing emphasized that the registrar's
office issues spouse cards for identification
purposes only. It does not determine how
the card should be used or what benefits
the card entitles spouses to receive. That is
left up to individual organizations, she
said.
Rule changed
Until recently, the ASSU required that a
couple show either a spouse card or a stu
dent ID that indicated the student was mar
ried in order for the couple to purchase
two tickets to the Sunday Flicks at the dis
counted student rate.
When asked recently why a couple had
to be married to receive the discount, Brian
Becker, director of the Sunday Flicks, ad
mitted he'd never really thought about it.
"We've never encountered it before,"
he explained. "Most people do have IDs."
Becker said he could accommodate
more people at the Flicks and that "it
bothers me that I might be turning people
away for that reason." He decided to
change the policy immediately.
With a student ID, a student may now
purchase two tickets to the Flicks at the
discounted price of 75 cents — regardless
of marital status.
An organization that continues to honor
the spouse card is the Stanford athletic de
partment. Bob Young, associate director in
charge of operations, explained that the

card entitles the student spouse to purch
ase tickets to all athletic events at the stu
dent rate. It also entitles spouses to use
swimming pools, the golf course, tennis
courts, and other facilities at no cost during
designated time periods.
"It is our rule at Stanford that we take
care of spouses on all activities at the same
price as the student pays," Young said.
"Our control is the ID card. We go by the
"M" embossed on the card. How that got
there is not my problem, it's someone
else's."
Student spouses with ID cards may also
use facilities at the Career Planning and
Placement Center, although they may not
set up a placement file.
A "Spouse Handbook," issued by the
CPPC, explains some of the services that
spouses may receive: career counseling,
weekly lists of area job openings, and assis
tance with writing resumes and learning
interviewing techniques.
Ralph Keller, CPPC director, explained
the rationale behind offering these
privileges to student spouses.
"We're going to help your husband be
cause you're a student. If we help your
husband, we're helping you. Therefore,
we've attached significance to the fact that
you're married."
Student spouses with IDs may also use
library and Cowell health care facilities.
Cowell offers spouses and children of stu
dents a 15 percent reduction on rates
based on the customary fees charged at the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic.
Housing is another area that offers ad
vantages to married couples. According to
Michael Bever, manager of Escondido Vil
lage, only married couples are eligible to

live in the two-bedroom low-rises. He
stated that couples must be married to re
ceive married student housing, although
couples are not asked to prove that they're
married. He admits that students do sub
vert the system.
Practical standards
Bever and others interviewed, denied
that Stanford is making moral judgments.
Rather, marriage serves as a socially and
legally recognized dividing line between
those who may and those who may not
receive benefits.
"Marriage," Bever said, "is a convenient
handle for us to maximize the number of
students we can house."
"How else can we judge?" he asked. "I'd
rather get around the whole question of
whether they're married or not. Nobody
cares."
Dr. James McClenahan, director of
Cowell Student Health Center, offered
another practical consideration. There are,
he said, certain questions of legality and
liability that are defined by the marriage
contract.
"Who's responsible for payment?" he
asked. "A marriage is a contract in a certain
legal, fiscal sense that living together is
not."
Young explained that the athletic de
partment's policy is partly based on the
Pacific Eight conference contracts Stanford
has with other schools.
"We are allowed, by contract with the
Pac-8 people, a student and spouse at the
student rate," he stated, adding that that
policy extended to events outside the Pac-8
as well.
Justification for offering benefits based
on marital status, thus centers around not

only what's practical at Stanford, but
what's practical for Stanford to do as part of
a larger social system.
"Society is basically pro-natalist and
pro-marriage," Margaret Collins, adminis
trator of the Center for Research on
Women stated.
"Almost all the laws in society protect
married people," she said. "They encour
age marriage; they make it easier to be
married than not married. That's the prob
lem. Stanford is just a single manifestation
of that."
The argument that Stanford conventions
must conform to those of the larger society
may be weakening in light of a growing
trend in America toward cohabitation as an
alternative to marriage.
According to a U.S. Census Bureau re
port released last February, 1.3 million
Americans cohabitated in 1976. (The Cen
sus Bureau defines cohabitation as two
persons, of the opposite sex and unrelated
to each other, living together in the same
household.)
For the population as a whole, the report
states, the number of unmarried couples
living together has doubled in the last
seven years. But among persons under the
age of 45, the increase has been nearly
fivefold.
The courts and legislatures are begin
ning to recognize this trend. Last De
cember, the California Supreme Court up
held the right of singer Michelle Triola
Marvin, who had lived with actor Lee Mar
vin for six years, to sue the actor for breach
of contract. Michelle Marvin alleged that
she and Lee Marvin had entered into an
express oral agreement to pool and share
their earnings and property.
