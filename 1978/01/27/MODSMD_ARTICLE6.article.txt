# Institutional racism and the 'Daily'
## 
### 
David Smith

It is at once evident, even to the
dull observer, that mechanisms exist
within our society that manifest
themselves in our media; and I say
"our" media with grave reservations.
Friday morning's Daily provided an
exclamation mark to a statement of
these mechanisms.
The feature article, appearing,
curiously enough, above the Daily
logo, on William Shockley and his
transistor logic genetics provided the
premise. Crossing over the great di
vide one could read "BSU Brings Gil
Scott-Heron to Kresge," an inaccu
rate headline followed by an even
more misfocused report.
To my mind the first question was:
"Why Shockley?" Hasn't his research
been refuted by all reputable
sources? But the answer lay
elsewhere.
Leaving the answers to those
queries to remain unclear for the
moment, I read through the article
on Gil Scott-Heron, finding, or rather
not finding, any substance which
could be related to the actual per
formance and lecture.
I imagine it is useful to know that
he received a standing ovation, al
though there were more essential
aspects of the presenation which
were overlooked. The most glaring
mistake, and I use the word mistake

kindly, is the omission of Barrett Wil
liams, the Doctor, founder of The
Society for the Preservation of Afri
can Percussion.
The Doctor gave us an unparal
leled lesson in the sounds and uses
of African percussion instruments.
Although this omission has been de
scribed as a matter of news judg
ment, it points to a very important
reality: transubstantive error, a
phrase coined by Dr. Wade Nobles,
which refers to the inability of West
ern culture to understand the sub
stance or essence of African culture
thus causing them to use their own
standards to desrribe the events of
other cultures.
The impositions of American con
ceptions of what is newsworthy is
shrouded within the American
psyche ot what is important. That is
to say it cannot or will not deal with
African culture as an important, vital
and functional entity in and of itself.
This is indeed a narrow view which
indicates to black students what we
have been aware of ever since grade
school when reading American his
tory and coming to believe black
Americans had no impact on
America, no lasting positive effect
other than being slaves. And as such
we were devoid of a culture compar
able to the towering standards of a
Shakespeare. Again the mechanism

shows its face.
But this judgement is not engulfed
in ignorance, although the phrase
"griot music" is a gross misidentifica
tion akin to relating scores on a stan
dardized test to intelligence. The
griot was explained, described and
exhibited by Scott-Heron in the ini
tial minutes of his presentation (not
to mention the information included
in the press packet handed over to
the Daily staff).
To set the record straight, the griot
is a man who related the history of his
people to the people in the oral tradi
tion. Music is not an essential charac
teristic of that process; it is an oral
process handed down from father to
son.
What then can this mistake be at
tributed? . .Dot dot didit dot dot
dash . . . Damn if I know" as Brother
Gil put it.
Looking for the answer I see
Shockley writing on a chalkboard
preaching his insidious nonsense,
three steps removed from the reality
of true scientific investigation on the
subject. Wondering for the longest
time what he had done recently to
merit banner coverage. Oh yes, the
Pioneer fund a "self-funded non
private foundation" dedicated to
"racial betterment." To save babies
from being born "genetically en
slaved" — a state, I imagine, equiva
lent to original sin; only Shockley
preaches genocide rather than bap
tism.
Shockley sees the "wishful think
ing" of our society as being compar
able to the "intellectual atmosphere
of Nazi Germany" and I believe
George Orwell would have some
thing to say about that.
And finally the mere coincidence
of the appearance of Shockley on the
cover of the Daily on the same day as
coverage of the first event of Black
Liberation Month is perfect timing
for controversy if not an all out af
front to every black student on cam
pus. Only the mistake is not in the
mechanism but in the obvious man
ifestations of it.
But you may ask, "What is the
mechanism?" Well, to be perfectly
frank, the mechanism is anotherism:
racism.

Liberation Month is perfect timing
for controversy if not an all out af
front to every black student on cam
pus. Only the mistake is not in the
mechanism but in the obvious man
ifestations of it.
But you may ask, "What is the
mechanism?" Well, to be perfectly
frank, the mechanism is anotherism:
racism.

It is at once evident, even to the
dull observer, that mechanisms exist
within our society that manifest
themselves in our media; and I say
"our" media with grave reservations.
Friday morning's Daily provided an
exclamation mark to a statement of
these mechanisms.
The feature article, appearing,
curiously enough, above the Daily
logo, on William Shockley and his
transistor logic genetics provided the
premise. Crossing over the great di
vide one could read "BSU Brings Gil
Scott-Heron to Kresge," an inaccu
rate headline followed by an even
more misfocused report.
To my mind the first question was:
"Why Shockley?" Hasn't his research
been refuted by all reputable
sources? But the answer lay
elsewhere.
Leaving the answers to those
queries to remain unclear for the
moment, I read through the article
on Gil Scott-Heron, finding, or rather
not finding, any substance which
could be related to the actual per
formance and lecture.
I imagine it is useful to know that
he received a standing ovation, al
though there were more essential
aspects of the presenation which
were overlooked. The most glaring
mistake, and I use the word mistake

kindly, is the omission of Barrett Wil
liams, the Doctor, founder of The
Society for the Preservation of Afri
can Percussion.
The Doctor gave us an unparal
leled lesson in the sounds and uses
of African percussion instruments.
Although this omission has been de
scribed as a matter of news judg
ment, it points to a very important
reality: transubstantive error, a
phrase coined by Dr. Wade Nobles,
which refers to the inability of West
ern culture to understand the sub
stance or essence of African culture
thus causing them to use their own
standards to desrribe the events of
other cultures.
The impositions of American con
ceptions of what is newsworthy is
shrouded within the American
psyche ot what is important. That is
to say it cannot or will not deal with
African culture as an important, vital
and functional entity in and of itself.
This is indeed a narrow view which
indicates to black students what we
have been aware of ever since grade
school when reading American his
tory and coming to believe black
Americans had no impact on
America, no lasting positive effect
other than being slaves. And as such
we were devoid of a culture compar
able to the towering standards of a
Shakespeare. Again the mechanism

shows its face.
But this judgement is not engulfed
in ignorance, although the phrase
"griot music" is a gross misidentifica
tion akin to relating scores on a stan
dardized test to intelligence. The
griot was explained, described and
exhibited by Scott-Heron in the ini
tial minutes of his presentation (not
to mention the information included
in the press packet handed over to
the Daily staff).
To set the record straight, the griot
is a man who related the history of his
people to the people in the oral tradi
tion. Music is not an essential charac
teristic of that process; it is an oral
process handed down from father to
son.
What then can this mistake be at
tributed? . .Dot dot didit dot dot
dash . . . Damn if I know" as Brother
Gil put it.
Looking for the answer I see
Shockley writing on a chalkboard
preaching his insidious nonsense,
three steps removed from the reality
of true scientific investigation on the
subject. Wondering for the longest
time what he had done recently to
merit banner coverage. Oh yes, the
Pioneer fund a "self-funded non
private foundation" dedicated to
"racial betterment." To save babies
from being born "genetically en
slaved" — a state, I imagine, equiva
lent to original sin; only Shockley
preaches genocide rather than bap
tism.
Shockley sees the "wishful think
ing" of our society as being compar
able to the "intellectual atmosphere
of Nazi Germany" and I believe
George Orwell would have some
thing to say about that.
And finally the mere coincidence
of the appearance of Shockley on the
cover of the Daily on the same day as
coverage of the first event of Black
Liberation Month is perfect timing
for controversy if not an all out af
front to every black student on cam
pus. Only the mistake is not in the
