# Ombudsman's report

### 
It would be a gross understate
ment of reality to say that David
Smith's above criticism of last Fri
day's front page struck a nerve both
in the black community and in the
Daily office. The Daily's mistakes, the
public's reaction to them and the en
suing debate and negotiation have
combined both to shed new light on
old problems and to produce some
tentative steps toward solving these
problems.
Smith's specific complaints have a
great deal of validity. For some
reason, Murphy's Law seems to have
triumphed the night of Jan. 19:
—two inexperienced reporters,
working on sensitive stories, made
both factual and writing errors;
—a news editor whose attention
was focused on other matters neg
lected to see that a story he had or
dered be given the least prominent
position on the front page — the
story on Shockley — was instead
placed over the "Stanford Daily" flag
by a first-time night editor;
—a copy editor who earlier in the
week had been elected the Daily's
next editor-in-chief spent too much
time that night worrying about the
next months' editions to edit the two
sensitive stories with care.
And on and on.
The result was that what otherwise
would have been a legitimate minor
story about new (and controversial)
funding for William Shockley's re
search turned into a prominently
placed rehashing of Shockley's
dubious theories printed on the first
day of Black Liberation Month and
that the story on Gil Scott-Heron was
both inaccurate and refected all
too-common white ignorance of
black culture.
And these blunders were only
compounded by the Daily's sub
sequent refusal to admit any but the
most innocuous of its factual errata:
the inaccurate headline indicating
that the Black Students Union had
arranged for Scott-Heron's appear
ance. And a partial result of that
compounding is the above letter.
But today — after a house meeting

in Ujamaa protesting the Daily's ac
tions, a number of phone calls from
angry readers and meetings between
Daily editors including myself and
members of the black community —
it is apparent that Smith's critique ex
tends far beyond last Friday's Daily.
And justly so.
The fact is that the Daily does not
have a single black writer or editor
and has not had one since last spring.
Certainly the Daily has not con
sciously excluded blacks from par
ticipating — it does have two black
opinions columnists and a black
photographer — but there is no get
ting around the reality that, with the
exception of a small number of Asian
Americans, the Daily is almost exclu
sively a caucasian organization. And
that fundamental problem makes
situations such as the above all the
more likely to occur.
There is reason for optimism,
however. As a result of some the
most enlightening discussions on
the Daily I have seen in three years
here, plans are under way both to
recruit black writers on an affirmative
basis for work within the Daily's trad
itional structure and to form a pool of
black writers who want to stay away
from the Daily's orthodox hierarchy
but who are interested in submitting
feature-type stories on issues and
people of interest to the black com
munity.
This two-pronged approach will
help bring the Daily both the diverse
copy it wants and the minority influ
ence and representation it needs.
The next step will be to form simi
lar working arrangements with other
minority groups here, and I under
stand that working out the details of
these plans will consume a large
amount of Editor-elect Dave Ansley's
time once he takes over Sunday. It
will be time well spent in addition to
the more general task of rebuilding
what is currently a skeletal staff at the
Daily, and it is the only sure way to
avoid the compounded blunders
which moved Smith and others to
write.
