# Rain delays campus construction
## 
### Cindi Burrows 
This month's weather has been in
strumental in delaying construction
schedules for various buildings
around campus.
According to Planning Director
Phil Williams, "There is only one
reason that I can think of why any
construction is behind schedule and
that is because of the rain." He also
said that the most serious problem
due to the rain has been the delay in
the construction of the Margaret
Jacks Hall.
The hall, with a total construction
cost of $6,501,000 was originally
scheduled to be completed by next
December, but officials are now un
sure of a completion date.
A reconstruction of an old Quad
sandstone building, Jacks Hall will
house new quarters for the Compu
ter Science Department and the Boys
Town Center for the Study of Youth
Development.
Pouring delayed
The rain has also affected con
struction at the School of Engineer
ing (Bldg. 570), preventing workmen
from pouring a concrete slab. The
ground must be completely dry be
fore the concrete can be poured and
cured. The project has already been
delayed for two weeks and any rains
from now on will delay it further.
The Bechtel International Center is
adding a two-story building at a pro
jected cost of $318,000. The addition,
which will provide more usable
space for the center, was bid in
November but construction was
temporarily held up by the rain.
The $2,819,000 Stanford Bookstore
addition was originally slated to be
completed by the middle of February
but it too has suffered schedule slip

page.
The activation period, during
which time the air and mechanical
systems will be checked for any mal
functions, should be completed by
the end of March, a few weeks off
schedule, and the Bookstore should
be ready for occupancy during the
first weeks in April.
The History Corner renovation,
with a budget of $8 million, is run
ning close to schedule. The corner,
like Jacks Hall, is an old sandstone
building undergoing reconstruction,

and should be ready for use in Sep
tember 1979.
Several University construction
projects are still on schedule: the
Cecil H. Green Library, due to be
completed at the end of 1978; the
Hopkins Marine Station lab remodel
ing, scheduled for completion at the
end of March, 1978; and the Bio-
Behavorial Development Program-
Stanford Outdoor Primate Facility
which will be finished by the end of
next September.

weather has also wreaked havoc with construction
schedules of other campus building projects.
This month's weather has been in
strumental in delaying construction
schedules for various buildings
around campus.
According to Planning Director
Phil Williams, "There is only one
reason that I can think of why any
construction is behind schedule and
that is because of the rain." He also
said that the most serious problem
due to the rain has been the delay in
the construction of the Margaret
Jacks Hall.
The hall, with a total construction
cost of $6,501,000 was originally
scheduled to be completed by next
December, but officials are now un
sure of a completion date.
A reconstruction of an old Quad
sandstone building, Jacks Hall will
house new quarters for the Compu
ter Science Department and the Boys
Town Center for the Study of Youth
Development.
Pouring delayed
The rain has also affected con
struction at the School of Engineer
ing (Bldg. 570), preventing workmen
from pouring a concrete slab. The
ground must be completely dry be
fore the concrete can be poured and
cured. The project has already been
delayed for two weeks and any rains
from now on will delay it further.
The Bechtel International Center is
adding a two-story building at a pro
jected cost of $318,000. The addition,
which will provide more usable
space for the center, was bid in
November but construction was
temporarily held up by the rain.
The $2,819,000 Stanford Bookstore
addition was originally slated to be
completed by the middle of February
but it too has suffered schedule slip

page.
The activation period, during
which time the air and mechanical
systems will be checked for any mal
functions, should be completed by
the end of March, a few weeks off
schedule, and the Bookstore should
be ready for occupancy during the
first weeks in April.
The History Corner renovation,
with a budget of $8 million, is run
ning close to schedule. The corner,
like Jacks Hall, is an old sandstone
building undergoing reconstruction,

and should be ready for use in Sep
tember 1979.
Several University construction
projects are still on schedule: the
Cecil H. Green Library, due to be
completed at the end of 1978; the
Hopkins Marine Station lab remodel
ing, scheduled for completion at the
end of March, 1978; and the Bio-
Behavorial Development Program-
Stanford Outdoor Primate Facility
which will be finished by the end of
next September.
