# Commitment to Honor Code

As a transfer student from another
university that has a strong tradition
of an effective honor code I have
been disillusioned by the Honor
Code here at Stanford. The Honor
Code is an extremely vital compo
nent of the University's continued
status as a preeminent institution of
learning.
The Honor Code is a reflection of
the commitment by both the faculty
and students to knowledge for its
own sake, not for the rewards the
trappings of knowledge might bring.
It is also a recognition of the moral

role that the University has to play.
Knowledge is a neutral item and
without moral direction it can be an
extremely dangerous commodity.
This fact is recognized across the
political spectrum by groups both on
and off campus.
Yet, despite its importance, and
declarations of members of the ASSU
Senate to the contrary, I find that
there is a lack of commitment to the
Honor Code by the student body.
There seems to.be a prevalent at
titude that stretching the Honor
Code is all right because everyone
does it. Often I, and I am sure you
too, have heard people say, "This
problem set's a bitch! Why don't you
come over tonight and we'll work on
it," when they know that collabora
tion on the assignment was specifi
cally prohibited.
If we cannot ourselves be honest
and trustworthy in our academic en
deavors, how can we, as a commun
ity, expect to be a moral force on the
world around us. How can we expect
the leaders of society which this Uni
versity produces to act morally when
the stakes are more than the grade
on an assignment or even in a
course?

I also find fault with the interpreta
tions of the Honor Code at Stanford.
In particular I feel that the restric
tions on take-home work are detri
mental. At present, take-home
exams can be neither closed-book
nor have a time limit imposed on
them. This system inherently hurts
somebody. Everyone is not going to
have the same time to work on the
exam because of differing amounts
of work they have in other courses.
I have known people who have
had to write three 10 page take-home
finals in a weekend. Are these people
being given the same chance to do
quality work as someone who only
has the one take-home to write? The
answer is obviously no, especially
with essay-type exams where time
comes with refinement.
These restrictions are justified as
preventing "undue; temptations" for
the students. Yet what they reflect is
a distrust of the study body's ability
to carry out its obligations to uphold
the Honor Code. It is as if a prof said
that he expected his students to
abide by the Honor Code and not
cheat but proctored the exam so they
would not have a temptation to
cheat.
If the student body cannot be

trusted to abide by its end of the bar
gain embodied in the Honor Code, a
proposition I personally reject, then
the whole concept of an honor code
at Stanford needs to be reexamined.
The solution is not to define away
cheating and in the process hurt in
dividual students according to the
happenstance of what their work
load in other subjects is. What is
needed is a concerted effort to
arouse student interest in, and
commitment to, the idea and ideals
of the Honor Code.
On rereading what I have written, I
realize that it sounds a bit moralizing,
yet this is a question of moral re
sponsibility. In recent weeks, the
ASSU Senate has denounced the fa
culty for not living up to its responsi
bility to embrace the Honor Code
completely. I, however, do not be
lieve that we have heard enough on
student responsibility to be honest,
trustworthy and fair in their relation
to the Honor Code. If this article has
caused you to at least question
and/or re-examine your personal re
lationship with the Honor Code, as
well as the University's as a whole,
then it has succeeded.
