# Chile's social institutions destroyed

Michael von Gortler's column
about Chile (Daily, jan. 24) purports
to tell the truth about the situation
there. It would be useful to dispel the
distortions being propagated by
throwing some of my own "vomit"
(to use Von Gortler's own word), into
the debate.
Having lived in Chile at the time of
the coup, and hence, being directly
subjected to the propaganda of the
junta, it is perhaps understandable
that Von Cortler should consider
President Salvador Allende's regime
to be a plot to institute Allende as
"absolute dictator" of Chile. It is in
teresting to note that this was to
occur exactly one day after Pinochet

took power. Believers in democracy
can indeed be thankful that the lunta
beat Allende to the punch.
In examining the civil rights record
of the Allende regime, Von Cortler
asserts that in the days of Allende
"innocent people were gunned
down in the streets." Thanks to the
coup, and the curfew, "terrorists
were finally harnessed, and their ac
tivities brought to an end."
While it is true that the Allende
years were violent years, it is ques
tionable whether the terrorism has
been brought to an end. Rather, the
government institutionalized terror
after the coup in the Directorate of
National Intelligence (DINA). As
many as 5000 people were assasi
nated and another 5000 "disap
peared." Though DINA no longer
exists, institutionalized terror is still
being carried out by other agencies
of the Chilean government.
As Von Cortler points out, suppor
ters of democracy do indeed lament
the overthrow of the Allende regime.
Von Gortler is also correct in saying
that Allende only received 37 per
cent of the vote and had to be (de
spite the efforts of the United States
government) elected by Congress.
No interference
But in implying that Allende's gov
ernment meant the end of democ
racy, Von Cortler failed to point out
that under Allende, there were
scores of trade union and local elec
tions in which the government did
not interfere, and that in the Con
gressional elections of March 1973,
support for Allende's coalition in
creased dramatically by almost 10 per
cent. Since the coup came to power,
there has been but one election: a
plebiscite in which the government
deliberately rigged the election so as
to insure a victory.
When Von Gortler talks about the
state of freedom of the press under
Pinocet, he asserts that the govern
ment does not censor the press. Yet,
the fact that the government closed
down all non-right wing papers,
whether it be by direct means or by
abolishing the political parties, indi
cates that the junta protects freedom

of the press in a very heavy-handed
way. The appearance of one more
puppet newspaper does not mitigate
this heavy-handedness for the
others.
Perhaps Von Gortler's most impor
tant point has to do with the
economy and domestic instability.
He is correct in saying that inflation
hit 300 per cent under Allende and
that riots and civil disturbances
played a major part in bringing Al
lende down.
Cause
In raising the point, however, Von
Gortler forces one to inquire more
deeply into the causes of these prob
lems. Indeed, by studying the causes
of the economic and social distur
bances, one ends up asking the
question of who, besides the Chilean
military, was instrumental in initiat
ing the coup, for all of these ques
tions are intertwined.
The period of U.S. intervention
can be divided into roughly three
stages. One before the election of
Allende on Sept. 4, 1970; two bet
ween Sept. 4 and Allende's inaugura
tion on Nov. 4, and three, between
Nov. 4 and the coup. In all of these
stages, the CIA deliberately sought
to subvert the democratic process in
Chile.
CIA intervention
Following a long history of CIA in
tervention in Chilean affairs, the Un
ited States decided it could not toler
ate the presence of a freely elected
Marxist government in Chile. The
CIA funded the right wing media in
an effort to scare the Chilean people
into voting against Unidad Popular,
and it subsidized right wing women 's
groups and efforts to pull voters
away from one of the coalition
partners, the Radical party.
Failing to keep Allende from get
ting the plurality, U.S. efforts after
Sept. 4 followed two "tracks." Track
one consisted of an effort to dis
suade the Chilean Congress from
voting Allende into office. Track two
consisted of an effort to subvert the
Chilean economy, fund opposition
groups and activate contacts in the
armed forces so as to investigate the

possibility of a coup.
Track two became especially im
portant after Allende was inaugu
rated. Following the instructions of
the National Security Council to, as
then CIA Director Richard Helms put
it, "Make the economy scream," and
having as much as $10 million at its
disposal, the intelligence community
in Chile went to work.
Hate-scare
The CIA gave the National Party,
the Christian Democrats and several
other groups funds to carry out a
hate-scare propaganda campaign
against Allende. Some CIA funds fil
tered down to groups such as the
striking truck owners, who disrupted
the economy and contributed to the
shortages which helped cause the
300 percent inflation Von Gortler de
scribes.
On the international level, the Un
ited States encouraged the im
plementation of what some have cal
led the "silent blockade" against
Chile. The government used all the
power it had to encourage private
banks and international lending
agencies to curtail their loans and aid
to Chile and not to renegotiate any of
Chile's debts. Thus, for example,
U.S. aid to Chile totaled more than
$1.1 billion in 1964-70 and only $55.7
million between 1971 and 1973, when
Allende was in power, again con
tributing to economic disruption.
U.S. participation in the coup has
not yet been conclusively proven,
but the CIA did monitor the happen
ings in the Chilean military, and did
everything it could to encourage the
coup. U.S. intervention was instru
mental in causing the economic and
social problems which Von Gortler
documents.
As a result, Chile has Pinochet, and
she is beleaguered by a nightmare
which is much worse than the
dreams of Allende: her democracy
and social institutions are destroved.
It's enough to make idealistic and
humanitarian people vomit.

the National Security Council to, as
then CIA Director Richard Helms put
it, "Make the economy scream," and
having as much as $10 million at its
disposal, the intelligence community
in Chile went to work.
Hate-scare
The CIA gave the National Party,
the Christian Democrats and several
other groups funds to carry out a
hate-scare propaganda campaign
against Allende. Some CIA funds fil
tered down to groups such as the
striking truck owners, who disrupted
the economy and contributed to the
shortages which helped cause the
300 percent inflation Von Gortler de
scribes.
On the international level, the Un
ited States encouraged the im
plementation of what some have cal
led the "silent blockade" against
Chile. The government used all the
power it had to encourage private
banks and international lending
agencies to curtail their loans and aid
to Chile and not to renegotiate any of
Chile's debts. Thus, for example,
U.S. aid to Chile totaled more than
$1.1 billion in 1964-70 and only $55.7
million between 1971 and 1973, when
Allende was in power, again con
tributing to economic disruption.
U.S. participation in the coup has
not yet been conclusively proven,
but the CIA did monitor the happen
ings in the Chilean military, and did
everything it could to encourage the
coup. U.S. intervention was instru
mental in causing the economic and
social problems which Von Gortler
documents.
As a result, Chile has Pinochet, and
she is beleaguered by a nightmare
which is much worse than the
dreams of Allende: her democracy
and social institutions are destroved.
It's enough to make idealistic and
humanitarian people vomit.

Michael von Gortler's column
about Chile (Daily, jan. 24) purports
to tell the truth about the situation
there. It would be useful to dispel the
distortions being propagated by
throwing some of my own "vomit"
(to use Von Gortler's own word), into
the debate.
Having lived in Chile at the time of
the coup, and hence, being directly
subjected to the propaganda of the
junta, it is perhaps understandable
that Von Cortler should consider
President Salvador Allende's regime
to be a plot to institute Allende as
"absolute dictator" of Chile. It is in
teresting to note that this was to
occur exactly one day after Pinochet

took power. Believers in democracy
can indeed be thankful that the lunta
beat Allende to the punch.
In examining the civil rights record
of the Allende regime, Von Cortler
asserts that in the days of Allende
"innocent people were gunned
down in the streets." Thanks to the
coup, and the curfew, "terrorists
were finally harnessed, and their ac
tivities brought to an end."
While it is true that the Allende
years were violent years, it is ques
tionable whether the terrorism has
been brought to an end. Rather, the
government institutionalized terror
after the coup in the Directorate of
National Intelligence (DINA). As
many as 5000 people were assasi
nated and another 5000 "disap
peared." Though DINA no longer
exists, institutionalized terror is still
being carried out by other agencies
of the Chilean government.
As Von Cortler points out, suppor
ters of democracy do indeed lament
the overthrow of the Allende regime.
Von Gortler is also correct in saying
that Allende only received 37 per
cent of the vote and had to be (de
spite the efforts of the United States
government) elected by Congress.
No interference
But in implying that Allende's gov
ernment meant the end of democ
racy, Von Cortler failed to point out
that under Allende, there were
scores of trade union and local elec
tions in which the government did
not interfere, and that in the Con
gressional elections of March 1973,
support for Allende's coalition in
creased dramatically by almost 10 per
cent. Since the coup came to power,
there has been but one election: a
plebiscite in which the government
deliberately rigged the election so as
to insure a victory.
When Von Gortler talks about the
state of freedom of the press under
Pinocet, he asserts that the govern
ment does not censor the press. Yet,
the fact that the government closed
down all non-right wing papers,
whether it be by direct means or by
abolishing the political parties, indi
cates that the junta protects freedom

of the press in a very heavy-handed
way. The appearance of one more
puppet newspaper does not mitigate
this heavy-handedness for the
others.
Perhaps Von Gortler's most impor
tant point has to do with the
economy and domestic instability.
He is correct in saying that inflation
hit 300 per cent under Allende and
that riots and civil disturbances
played a major part in bringing Al
lende down.
Cause
In raising the point, however, Von
Gortler forces one to inquire more
deeply into the causes of these prob
lems. Indeed, by studying the causes
of the economic and social distur
bances, one ends up asking the
question of who, besides the Chilean
military, was instrumental in initiat
ing the coup, for all of these ques
tions are intertwined.
The period of U.S. intervention
can be divided into roughly three
stages. One before the election of
Allende on Sept. 4, 1970; two bet
ween Sept. 4 and Allende's inaugura
tion on Nov. 4, and three, between
Nov. 4 and the coup. In all of these
stages, the CIA deliberately sought
to subvert the democratic process in
Chile.
CIA intervention
Following a long history of CIA in
tervention in Chilean affairs, the Un
ited States decided it could not toler
ate the presence of a freely elected
Marxist government in Chile. The
CIA funded the right wing media in
an effort to scare the Chilean people
into voting against Unidad Popular,
and it subsidized right wing women 's
groups and efforts to pull voters
away from one of the coalition
partners, the Radical party.
Failing to keep Allende from get
ting the plurality, U.S. efforts after
Sept. 4 followed two "tracks." Track
one consisted of an effort to dis
suade the Chilean Congress from
voting Allende into office. Track two
consisted of an effort to subvert the
Chilean economy, fund opposition
groups and activate contacts in the
armed forces so as to investigate the

possibility of a coup.
Track two became especially im
portant after Allende was inaugu
rated. Following the instructions of
the National Security Council to, as
then CIA Director Richard Helms put
it, "Make the economy scream," and
having as much as $10 million at its
disposal, the intelligence community
in Chile went to work.

hit 300 per cent under Allende and
that riots and civil disturbances
played a major part in bringing Al
lende down.
Cause
In raising the point, however, Von
Gortler forces one to inquire more
deeply into the causes of these prob
lems. Indeed, by studying the causes
of the economic and social distur
bances, one ends up asking the
question of who, besides the Chilean
military, was instrumental in initiat
ing the coup, for all of these ques
tions are intertwined.
The period of U.S. intervention
can be divided into roughly three
stages. One before the election of
Allende on Sept. 4, 1970; two bet
ween Sept. 4 and Allende's inaugura
tion on Nov. 4, and three, between
Nov. 4 and the coup. In all of these
stages, the CIA deliberately sought
to subvert the democratic process in
Chile.
CIA intervention
Following a long history of CIA in
tervention in Chilean affairs, the Un
ited States decided it could not toler
ate the presence of a freely elected
Marxist government in Chile. The
CIA funded the right wing media in
an effort to scare the Chilean people
into voting against Unidad Popular,
and it subsidized right wing women 's
groups and efforts to pull voters
away from one of the coalition
partners, the Radical party.
Failing to keep Allende from get
ting the plurality, U.S. efforts after
Sept. 4 followed two "tracks." Track
one consisted of an effort to dis
suade the Chilean Congress from
voting Allende into office. Track two
consisted of an effort to subvert the
Chilean economy, fund opposition
groups and activate contacts in the
armed forces so as to investigate the

possibility of a coup.
Track two became especially im
portant after Allende was inaugu
rated. Following the instructions of
the National Security Council to, as
then CIA Director Richard Helms put
it, "Make the economy scream," and
having as much as $10 million at its
disposal, the intelligence community
in Chile went to work.
Hate-scare
The CIA gave the National Party,
the Christian Democrats and several
other groups funds to carry out a
hate-scare propaganda campaign
against Allende. Some CIA funds fil
tered down to groups such as the
striking truck owners, who disrupted
the economy and contributed to the
shortages which helped cause the
300 percent inflation Von Gortler de
scribes.
On the international level, the Un
ited States encouraged the im
plementation of what some have cal
led the "silent blockade" against
Chile. The government used all the
power it had to encourage private
banks and international lending
agencies to curtail their loans and aid
to Chile and not to renegotiate any of
Chile's debts. Thus, for example,
U.S. aid to Chile totaled more than
$1.1 billion in 1964-70 and only $55.7
million between 1971 and 1973, when
Allende was in power, again con
tributing to economic disruption.
U.S. participation in the coup has
not yet been conclusively proven,
but the CIA did monitor the happen
ings in the Chilean military, and did
everything it could to encourage the
coup. U.S. intervention was instru
mental in causing the economic and
social problems which Von Gortler
documents.
As a result, Chile has Pinochet, and
she is beleaguered by a nightmare
which is much worse than the
dreams of Allende: her democracy
and social institutions are destroved.
It's enough to make idealistic and
humanitarian people vomit.

Michael von Gortler's column
about Chile (Daily, jan. 24) purports
to tell the truth about the situation
there. It would be useful to dispel the
distortions being propagated by
throwing some of my own "vomit"
(to use Von Gortler's own word), into
the debate.
Having lived in Chile at the time of
the coup, and hence, being directly
subjected to the propaganda of the
junta, it is perhaps understandable
that Von Cortler should consider
President Salvador Allende's regime
to be a plot to institute Allende as
"absolute dictator" of Chile. It is in
teresting to note that this was to
occur exactly one day after Pinochet

took power. Believers in democracy
can indeed be thankful that the lunta
beat Allende to the punch.
In examining the civil rights record
of the Allende regime, Von Cortler
asserts that in the days of Allende
"innocent people were gunned
down in the streets." Thanks to the
coup, and the curfew, "terrorists
were finally harnessed, and their ac
tivities brought to an end."
While it is true that the Allende
years were violent years, it is ques
tionable whether the terrorism has
been brought to an end. Rather, the
government institutionalized terror
after the coup in the Directorate of
National Intelligence (DINA). As
many as 5000 people were assasi
nated and another 5000 "disap
peared." Though DINA no longer
exists, institutionalized terror is still
being carried out by other agencies
of the Chilean government.
As Von Cortler points out, suppor
ters of democracy do indeed lament
the overthrow of the Allende regime.
Von Gortler is also correct in saying
that Allende only received 37 per
cent of the vote and had to be (de
spite the efforts of the United States
government) elected by Congress.
No interference
But in implying that Allende's gov
ernment meant the end of democ
racy, Von Cortler failed to point out
that under Allende, there were
scores of trade union and local elec
tions in which the government did
not interfere, and that in the Con
gressional elections of March 1973,
support for Allende's coalition in
creased dramatically by almost 10 per
cent. Since the coup came to power,
there has been but one election: a
plebiscite in which the government
deliberately rigged the election so as
to insure a victory.
When Von Gortler talks about the
state of freedom of the press under
Pinocet, he asserts that the govern
ment does not censor the press. Yet,
the fact that the government closed
down all non-right wing papers,
whether it be by direct means or by
abolishing the political parties, indi
cates that the junta protects freedom

of the press in a very heavy-handed
way. The appearance of one more
puppet newspaper does not mitigate
this heavy-handedness for the
others.
Perhaps Von Gortler's most impor
tant point has to do with the
economy and domestic instability.
He is correct in saying that inflation
hit 300 per cent under Allende and
that riots and civil disturbances
