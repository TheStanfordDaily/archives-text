# Considered the 'Daily'?

Yea, that's me. The big one of the left. Yea.
On the phone.
That picture was taken last May while I was
working on a story which you might re
member. It involved an analysis of the
reasons why 294 persons decided to sit-in at
Old Union. Earlier that day I had been in San
Francisco covering what was probably the
most watched Board of Trustees meeting of
the past few years.
And I was only a freshperson.
Now, less than a year later, as a sopho
more, I am managing editor of the volume
which begins today. A prodigy of the news
paper circuit? Hardly. In truth, there was no
one else to fill the position. Oh sure I've put
in hundreds of hours here and I've done a
great deal of work, but there is a serious
shortage of personnel. In fact, all but a few of
the persons in this volume's staff box are
older than I. Three are freshpeople.
And despite the fact that we are drawing
from such a young group, I find myself in the
unenviable position of trying to produce a
newspaper with what could be called, at best,
a skeleton staff.
People find it hard to believe, but only
about 25 people (strange ones known as
Daily groupies and red hots) are responsible
for the day-to-day production of this paper.
We feel we do a pretty good job. We have
high editorial standards (compare us with
other college or even professional newspap
ers just in this area) which we try to maintain.
But with only 25 hardcores, we have a hard
time reporting everything. We are bound,
from time to time, to miss that story or
photograph which would make the front
page the next day truly outstanding. And we
are bound to make a few mistakes.
And so you see the problem. So why does
the problem exist?
There are a number of theories ranging
from the cliquish nature of the hardcores to
thoughts that joining the staff requires the
reporting abilities of one wishing to get a
byline in the Washington Post.
The fact is that many of our senior staffers
do tend to brush off newcomers, if they
acknowledge their presence at all. And this

does tend to frustrate people who are con
sidering joining us.
But Dave Ansley, the new editor, and I have
committed ourselves to making (he Daily a
pleasant place to work. And the rest of the
staff is solidly behind us. I think you may find
a dramatic change from the cold atmosphere
of some past volumes.
No, you don't have to spend 45 hours a
week here, and you don't have to be the best
writer on campus to work here. You do need
to have some enthusiasm and a sense of re
sponsibility. We do have to work on tight
deadlines, and we do require accuracy in our
copy.
When I first started here, people somehow
sensed {hat I really wanted to be a part of the
Daily staff (possibly because I hung around a
lot and bothered the news editors). And
when they realized that fact, they really
opened up. With a little perseverence, I
managed to get into a group of people who I
can truly call friends. And our friendship ex
tends a long way beyond 35 inches of copy on
page 4.
And the experience I'm getting from writ
ing, learning to organize my time and run
ning my portion of this newspaper are things
which just can't be taught in any classroom.
You can join us. Bring us your ideas, en
thusiasm and talents. We want to know what
you'd like to see. And we'd like to see you
help get those ideas executed.
Besides openings in all departments for
writers, we need people to do layout and
wire copy editing, proofreading and headlin
ing.
If you give it a try, you might surprise your
self. You'll gain valuable experience, meet
some incredibly nice people (there are
others here besides me) and learn first hand
what journalism is all about.
We're having new staffer meetings tomor
row and Thursday, both at 2 p.m. at the Daily
office, just across Lomita Mall from the Ter
man Engineering Center. I hope to see you
there.

a dramatic change from the cold atmosphere
of some past volumes.
No, you don't have to spend 45 hours a
week here, and you don't have to be the best
writer on campus to work here. You do need
to have some enthusiasm and a sense of re
sponsibility. We do have to work on tight
deadlines, and we do require accuracy in our
copy.
When I first started here, people somehow
sensed {hat I really wanted to be a part of the
Daily staff (possibly because I hung around a
lot and bothered the news editors). And
when they realized that fact, they really
opened up. With a little perseverence, I
managed to get into a group of people who I
can truly call friends. And our friendship ex
tends a long way beyond 35 inches of copy on
page 4.
And the experience I'm getting from writ
ing, learning to organize my time and run
ning my portion of this newspaper are things
which just can't be taught in any classroom.
You can join us. Bring us your ideas, en
thusiasm and talents. We want to know what
you'd like to see. And we'd like to see you
help get those ideas executed.
Besides openings in all departments for
writers, we need people to do layout and
wire copy editing, proofreading and headlin
ing.
If you give it a try, you might surprise your
self. You'll gain valuable experience, meet
some incredibly nice people (there are
others here besides me) and learn first hand
what journalism is all about.
We're having new staffer meetings tomor
row and Thursday, both at 2 p.m. at the Daily
office, just across Lomita Mall from the Ter
man Engineering Center. I hope to see you
there.
Mike Charlson
Managing Editor

Yea, that's me. The big one of the left. Yea.
On the phone.
That picture was taken last May while I was
working on a story which you might re
member. It involved an analysis of the
reasons why 294 persons decided to sit-in at
Old Union. Earlier that day I had been in San
Francisco covering what was probably the
most watched Board of Trustees meeting of
the past few years.
And I was only a freshperson.
Now, less than a year later, as a sopho
more, I am managing editor of the volume
which begins today. A prodigy of the news
paper circuit? Hardly. In truth, there was no
one else to fill the position. Oh sure I've put
in hundreds of hours here and I've done a
great deal of work, but there is a serious
shortage of personnel. In fact, all but a few of
the persons in this volume's staff box are
older than I. Three are freshpeople.
And despite the fact that we are drawing
from such a young group, I find myself in the
unenviable position of trying to produce a
newspaper with what could be called, at best,
a skeleton staff.
People find it hard to believe, but only
about 25 people (strange ones known as
Daily groupies and red hots) are responsible
for the day-to-day production of this paper.
We feel we do a pretty good job. We have
high editorial standards (compare us with
other college or even professional newspap
ers just in this area) which we try to maintain.
But with only 25 hardcores, we have a hard
time reporting everything. We are bound,
from time to time, to miss that story or
photograph which would make the front
page the next day truly outstanding. And we
are bound to make a few mistakes.
And so you see the problem. So why does
the problem exist?
There are a number of theories ranging
from the cliquish nature of the hardcores to
thoughts that joining the staff requires the
reporting abilities of one wishing to get a
byline in the Washington Post.
The fact is that many of our senior staffers
do tend to brush off newcomers, if they
acknowledge their presence at all. And this

does tend to frustrate people who are con
sidering joining us.
But Dave Ansley, the new editor, and I have
committed ourselves to making (he Daily a
pleasant place to work. And the rest of the
staff is solidly behind us. I think you may find
a dramatic change from the cold atmosphere
of some past volumes.
