# Aggressive Bears dunk Cards, 84-68
## DiBiaso cites lack of defense, rebounding 
### David Georgette 
In terms of the scoreboard,
the key period in Cal's 84-68
win Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion came during a four
minute stretch in the second
half when the Bears outscored
Stanford 13-2. That gave them a
60-50 lead with eight minutes
to play.
But from Card coach Dick
Dißiaso's viewpoint, the big
change had come a lot earlier.
"In the last eight minutes of the
first half, they took control of
the game, and they kept con
trol of the game," he said.
"You have to give the credit to
the way Cal played. They were
the aggressor on offense and
defense. I'd say they also con
trolled the boards."

The Bears did control the
boards, collecting 43 rebounds
to Stanford's 32. And they out
shot the Cards, particularly in
the second half when the Bears
made 55 per cent of their shots
while Stanford was hitting 39
per cent.
What was worse?
But it was more what Stan
ford did not do that frustrated
Dißiaso. "Our defense was ter
rible and our offense was
worse than that," he said.
Even when the Cards had a
42-35 lead early in the second
half? "We were still terrible
then," said Dißiaso. "We were
not doing the things you are
supposed to do to maintain
consistency — executing sc
reens, using them properly,
boxing out on defense."
Despite the Cards' prob
lems, they cut into a 14-point
lead by Cal after going to a full
court press. Kimberly Belton
had a one-on-one situation
with 3:56 to go and Cal ahead
68-60, but his first shot rolled
off. Cal came back with a lay
up, and led by at least seven
points the rest of the way.
"Several times in the last
seven or eight minutes, when
we were in our full court press,
we had a chance to scare them
but couldn't," said Dißiaso. "I
thought we made a good effort

in the last seven or eight mi
nutes."
Forwards Doug True and
Kevin Singleton were the Bears
most responsible for having
Stanford down by 14 with 6V2
minutes to play. Singleton,
who finished with a game-high
23 points, scored seven points
to help Cal to its big lead and
then added seven more to
keep it in front. True, who had
two points in the first half, con
tributed 12 during Cal's surge.
True also led the Bears in re
bounding with 12. Gene Ran
som was Cal's second-leading
scorer with 18 points.
No changes
"I didn't change anything at
halftime," said Cal coach Dick
Edwards. "I just reminded
them of a few things such as
screening on the boards and
doing a few things on offense.
We worked the weak side plays

very well to Singleton."
Both coaches credited the
Bears for their defense. "I
think they played excellent de
fense," said Dißiaso, "but
when the other team's playing
excellent defense, you're sup
posed to take the challenge of
fensively."
"Our defense came along
even in the first half," said Ed
wards. "I thought True did a
good job on Belton, after he
adjusted."

Belton, though, finished as
the Cards' top scorer with 14
points and grabbed a game
high of 13 rebounds.
The win improved Cat's re
cord for the season to 9-9 and
2-3 in the Pacific-8. Stanford's
now 1-4 in conference and 11-7
overall.
"It was nice to come from
behind to win," said Edwards,
whose job security is reported
to be threatened. "It's always
great to win on the road."

to play.
But from Card coach Dick
Dißiaso's viewpoint, the big
change had come a lot earlier.
"In the last eight minutes of the
first half, they took control of
the game, and they kept con
trol of the game," he said.
"You have to give the credit to
the way Cal played. They were
the aggressor on offense and
defense. I'd say they also con
trolled the boards."

The Bears did control the
boards, collecting 43 rebounds
to Stanford's 32. And they out
shot the Cards, particularly in
the second half when the Bears
made 55 per cent of their shots
while Stanford was hitting 39
per cent.
What was worse?
But it was more what Stan
ford did not do that frustrated
Dißiaso. "Our defense was ter
rible and our offense was
worse than that," he said.
Even when the Cards had a
42-35 lead early in the second
half? "We were still terrible
then," said Dißiaso. "We were
not doing the things you are
supposed to do to maintain
consistency — executing sc
reens, using them properly,
boxing out on defense."
Despite the Cards' prob
lems, they cut into a 14-point
lead by Cal after going to a full
court press. Kimberly Belton
had a one-on-one situation
with 3:56 to go and Cal ahead
68-60, but his first shot rolled
off. Cal came back with a lay
up, and led by at least seven
points the rest of the way.
"Several times in the last
seven or eight minutes, when
we were in our full court press,
we had a chance to scare them
but couldn't," said Dißiaso. "I
thought we made a good effort

in the last seven or eight mi
nutes."
Forwards Doug True and
Kevin Singleton were the Bears
most responsible for having
Stanford down by 14 with 6V2
minutes to play. Singleton,
who finished with a game-high
23 points, scored seven points
to help Cal to its big lead and
then added seven more to
keep it in front. True, who had
two points in the first half, con
tributed 12 during Cal's surge.
True also led the Bears in re
bounding with 12. Gene Ran
som was Cal's second-leading
scorer with 18 points.
No changes
"I didn't change anything at
halftime," said Cal coach Dick
Edwards. "I just reminded
them of a few things such as
screening on the boards and
doing a few things on offense.
We worked the weak side plays

very well to Singleton."
Both coaches credited the
Bears for their defense. "I
think they played excellent de
fense," said Dißiaso, "but
when the other team's playing
excellent defense, you're sup
posed to take the challenge of
fensively."
"Our defense came along
even in the first half," said Ed
wards. "I thought True did a
good job on Belton, after he
adjusted."

Belton, though, finished as
the Cards' top scorer with 14
points and grabbed a game
high of 13 rebounds.
The win improved Cat's re
cord for the season to 9-9 and
2-3 in the Pacific-8. Stanford's
now 1-4 in conference and 11-7
overall.
"It was nice to come from
behind to win," said Edwards,
whose job security is reported
to be threatened. "It's always
great to win on the road."
