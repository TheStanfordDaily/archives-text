Instead of being saved by the bell, the
Stanford women's basketball team was
saved by the buzzer in its 55-53 victory over
Fresno State Saturday night in Maples
Pavilion. Although the Cards dominated
the first half and the beginning of the sec
ond half, the Bulldogs bit back in the last
minutes of the game. The Cards barely
held on.
"Five more minutes and they would
have beaten us. The game was poorly
played and it is obvious we need to wdrk
on our poise and control," Stanford coach
Dottie McCrea said.
Inconsistency has troubled the Cards in
previous games but Saturday the Cards
looked either outstanding or lackluster.
Getting off to a slow start, the Cards trailed
Fresno by as many as nine points until five
minutes before halftime when Stanford
came alive.
Forcing Fresno turnovers with a full
court press, the Cards caught up to the
Bulldogs and took the lead on a tip-in by
Maggie Nelson with 3:50 remaining in the

half. Stephanie Calef's drives and two
quick baskets by Barb Boylan widened the
Cards' lead to 33-22 at halftime.
The Cards continued to play well at the
start of the second half, stretching their
lead to 18 points, 43-25, with 14 minutes
left in the game. Then McCrea emptied
her bench, giving all but one Card playing
time. "I tried to play everyone," McCrea
said.
With the subs in, the Cards lead gradu
ally dwindled to five points with five mi
nutes remaining in the game. "When I
went out we were up by 18 points and we
were blowing them out of the game,"
starting guard Galef said. "I wasn't expect
ing to go back in and when we did the
momentum was in their favor. It's hard to
come off the bench and play."
Kathy Kearney lead the Bulldog attack,
scoring on several 15-foot jump shots to
bring her team within four points of the
Cards, 55-51, with 25 seconds left in the
game. She sunk one bucket in the final 10
seconds to make the score 55-53 but then
time ran out.
The win improved the Cards' overall re

cord to 10-6, and gave them a 3-1 mark in
the Northern California Athletic Confer
ence.
Stanford's scoring was distributed
among four of the starters. Nelson had 16
points and 11 rebounds while Galef, Betsy
Lough and Kathy Murphy each added 11
points to the total. Sophomore Kearney
had 24 points for the Bulldogs and Connie
Matson netted 16 points.
The Cardinals hit the road this week,
traveling to San Francisco tomorrow to
meet San Francisco State. Thursday the
Cards will be in Stockton to face the Uni
versity of Pacific Tigers.
