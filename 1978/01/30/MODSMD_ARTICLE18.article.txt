# Spikers win first match

### Ken Betts 
The Stanford men's volleyball team started off
the season on the right foot Friday night, beating
Stanislaus State 15-2, 18-16, 12-15 and 15-8.
Coach Art Lambert was glad to have the first
match behind him, but he added, "It was a dif
ficult way to get it under the belt."
The first game of the match began sluggishly
with both teams committing quite a few offen
sive errors. The Cardinals quickly got un
tracked, however, to reel off seven unanswered
points, and were never threatened.
The second game was closer as the lead
changed hands several times. Stanford started
out quickly and led 8-4, but Stanislaus State
stormed back to take a 13-11 lead. The Warriors
then had four game points, all of which the
Cards fought off. Stanford finally tied the game
at 15-15 and went on to win a hard fought contest
18-16.
In the third game Stanislaus State jumped into
the lead 7-4, and never let up, winning 15-12.
The final contest of the match was all Stan
ford. The Warriors looked tired, and they really
couldn't generate any of the offense with which
they won the third game. The Cards led early
4-2, but then fell behind 8-6. From there, how

ever Stanford displayed aggressive defense and
hit some well placed spikes to win nine straight
points and the match.
Lambert said the Cards "were too inconsis
tent.'' Rod Fletcher, Dave Saeta, and Kim Lum all
played well on the front line with Saeta and
Fletcher supplying some powerful outside hit
ting. But as far as the shot blocking was con
cerned, Lambert said the inconsistency plagued
his team.
The setting by Jack Foxworth and Tom Crimes
was often effective, but did not entirely please
Lambert. "We have an awful lot of work to do on
our setting and a great deal of work to do on our
passing."
Lambert said the defense played better than
the offense, but he was not entirely pleased with
their performance. "We still aren't bringing
balls up the way we should be, and we're cheat
ing an awful lot."
When asked whether or not he was pleased
with his team's overall performance, Lambert
replied, "No, but then I am a hard man to
please."
Stanford's next match will be against the pow
erful UCLA Bruins Friday night in Maples Pavil
ion.
