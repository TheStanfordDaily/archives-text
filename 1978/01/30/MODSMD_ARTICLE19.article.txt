# Men gymnasts end year-long drought
## Cal edges women 
### Dean Eyre 
Encina Gym was the site of
dramatic gymnastics action, as
Stanford's men beat UC-Davis
Friday night and the women
lost by less than a point to
California on Saturday.
For the men, the victory was
the first in over a year. The
Cards' performances were
good for a 188.65 team total,
compared to 179.90 for Davis,
and included strong individual
performances.

Ken Gorman won long horse
vaulting for Stanford, as well as
placing second in floor exer
cise. Other top scorers in
cluded Shep Kinsman, who
won the rings event and
earned third in vaulting and
Chris Takimoto, who won the
pommel horse competition. Al
Nemcek took second in vault
ing and Dan Wessner third on
the rings.
Tad Bostick earned second
places on high bar, parallel

bars and pommel horse, and
finished third in floor exercise.
His total score of 49.2 gave him
all-around honors, followed by
Kris Van Oeveren of Davis with
45.75, and Stanford's Kinsman
with 45.7.
Cardinal head coach Sadao
Hamada was understandably
pleased with the results of the
meet. "We never won a meet
for a long time, never won last
year — it makes us happy. We
worked hard last week — you
should see all the guys' hands
— one or two rips (blisters) on

each hand. But still they kept
working and we did much bet
ter," he said.
"What they did was much
stronger than what we are do
ing, but because they did so
many difficult things beyond
their level they missed a lot.
That's something that I can't af
ford at all this year, so I keep
the routines to the minimum
requirements and they (Stan
ford) have better execution,"
Hamada said.
Women
In thewomen'scompetition,
California won Saturday's meet
with a team score of 117.10,
closely followed by Stanford at
116.20. Fresno State finished
third, scoring 92.10.
Dana Padden and Saundra
Muramatsu were the top indi
viduals for Stanford. Padden
placed third in vaulting and
Muramatsu won the floor
exercise and balance beam
events. She also earned sec
ond in vaulting and took third
on the uneven bars.
Muramatsu's total score of
32.95 gave her the top all
around score, with Melinda
Schmidt of Cal and Stanford's
Linda Park placing second and
third.
In a meet where less than a
point separated winner and

runner-up, a young team will
most likely be the victim. Head
coach Jackie Walker explained,
"Our lack of experience
caused us to lose the meet. We
were a better team — we're not
better competitors, we're bet
ter gymnasts. One point is very
close — it's only two falls off of
beam or bars and we had
plenty of those."
"Hopefully, we'll be able to
improve enough to do better in
the conference meet against
them (Cal) but it will be close
again," Walker added.

events. She also earned sec
ond in vaulting and took third
on the uneven bars.
Muramatsu's total score of
32.95 gave her the top all
around score, with Melinda
Schmidt of Cal and Stanford's
Linda Park placing second and
third.
In a meet where less than a
point separated winner and

runner-up, a young team will
most likely be the victim. Head
coach Jackie Walker explained,
"Our lack of experience
caused us to lose the meet. We
were a better team — we're not
better competitors, we're bet
ter gymnasts. One point is very
close — it's only two falls off of
beam or bars and we had
plenty of those."
"Hopefully, we'll be able to
improve enough to do better in
the conference meet against
them (Cal) but it will be close
again," Walker added.
Encina Gym was the site of
dramatic gymnastics action, as
Stanford's men beat UC-Davis
Friday night and the women
lost by less than a point to
California on Saturday.
For the men, the victory was
the first in over a year. The
Cards' performances were
good for a 188.65 team total,
compared to 179.90 for Davis,
and included strong individual
performances.

Ken Gorman won long horse
vaulting for Stanford, as well as
placing second in floor exer
cise. Other top scorers in
cluded Shep Kinsman, who
won the rings event and
earned third in vaulting and
Chris Takimoto, who won the
pommel horse competition. Al
Nemcek took second in vault
ing and Dan Wessner third on
the rings.
Tad Bostick earned second
places on high bar, parallel

bars and pommel horse, and
finished third in floor exercise.
His total score of 49.2 gave him
all-around honors, followed by
Kris Van Oeveren of Davis with
45.75, and Stanford's Kinsman
with 45.7.
Cardinal head coach Sadao
Hamada was understandably
pleased with the results of the
meet. "We never won a meet
for a long time, never won last
year — it makes us happy. We
worked hard last week — you
should see all the guys' hands
— one or two rips (blisters) on

each hand. But still they kept
working and we did much bet
ter," he said.
"What they did was much
stronger than what we are do
ing, but because they did so
many difficult things beyond
their level they missed a lot.
That's something that I can't af
ford at all this year, so I keep
the routines to the minimum
requirements and they (Stan
ford) have better execution,"
Hamada said.
