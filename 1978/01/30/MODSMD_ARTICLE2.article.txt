# Water-saving efforts continue

The past month's rain has brought back the green
foothills and Lake Lagunita, but campus fountains are
still turned off and drought damage remains.
The University is reducing its water conservation ef
forts slightly but some water saving programs intro
duced for the drought will continue, said University
officials.
According to Plant Services Director )ason Mavis, the
University has "done well" in reducing water usage but
there is no reason to stop conserving now. He said he
has received no official word that the drought is over.
MaVis said that during the drought, plant services offi
cials learned through their minimal watering program
that much less water is needed to keep the campus
green than was used in the past. Even with a plentiful
water supply, the University will continue to water well
below pre-drought levels.
Plant services watered most campus areas until De
cember, Mavis said. When the weather turned cooler
and another dry season seemed likely, watering was
severely curtailed.
This caused insignificant losses of shrubs and grass,
said Herb Fong, plant services grounds supervisor. He
added that regular watering has not resumed because of
the plentiful rain in the last few weeks. When a watering

schedule is set up, most will be done automatically at
night and hand watering limited to early morning.
Most of the water for irrigation will be taken from the
nearly-full Felt and Searsville lakes, instead of taking
drinking water from San Francisco, Fong added.
In campus areas not watered by plant services, the
lack of rain caused most of the problems. Damage is
limited mostly to large eucalyptus trees but Mavis said
"we were on the verge of far more significant losses."
Two to three hundred trees have died and the cost of
cutting them down and replacing them is estimated at
$20,000 to $30,000. Other trees are more susceptible to
disease because of the drought.
Access to Frost Amphitheater, which was closed dur
ing the drought, will remain restricted because of the
abuse it receives when open. However Frost will be
watered more to help growth that was damaged in the
drought, Mavis said.
The "Claw" in White Plaza and other campus foun
tains will be turned on during daylight hours whenever
the University's water suppliers, the County of San Fran
cisco, give their approval.
Piers Dairy will also be bringing their cattle back into
the foothills sometime in the near future, Fong added.
Mavis cautioned against false optimism. "We still
need more rain. Unless we get one or two more good
rains, Lake Lag may start dropping again."
