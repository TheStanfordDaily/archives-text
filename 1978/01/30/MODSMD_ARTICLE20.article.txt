# Swimmers romp in Austin
## 
### Andy Lowe 
The situation was ideal. The
many unique features of the
sparkling new indoor pool
complex at the University of
Texas promised fast times. An
army of female timers, clad in
orange T-shirts and white
shorts, paraded around the
deck. O u 'ckly forgetting
Southern Methodist Universi
ty's 75-37 romp over the men
on Friday, the Cardinal men
and women swimmers decided
to do things Texas style — win
ning big over host Texas and
Texas A&M.
"The new Texas pool is truly
one of the outstanding
facilities in the world," said
coach Jim Gaughran after the
meet. "Our swimmers, as a re
sult, were really up for the
meet and the times were excel
lent. I am quite pleased with
the progress both teams are
making this season. The train
ing we have done is definitely
paying off and will especially
manifest itself at the Nationals
in March."
The women, swimming in

their first dual meet in more
than a month, met with little
opposition as they stroked to
wins and fast mid-season
times. Senior captain Anne
Brodell neared lifetime bests in
the 200 yd. free (1:55.11) and
500 yd. free (4:58.08), qualify
ing her in both events for the
AIAW Championships at Duke
University.
Valerie Lee, Stanford's
Woman Athlete of the Year last
year, has already qualified in
four events for the AIAW
Championship. She posted
impressive times in winning
the 200 yd. fly (2:04.61) and
Ioooyd. free (10:07.32).
Men roll
Winning every swimming
event, the men also dominated
the tri-meet with Texas and
Texas A&M. The freestyle re
lay, which bettered the strin
gent cut-off standard by .05
seconds, culminated the
team's emotional effort.
Sophomores Andy Nichols and
Tom O'Brien led the one-sided
victory as both qualified for the
NCAA Championships.

O'Brien, only slightly rested
for the meet, swam back to
back events, but managed to
overcome his fatigue, winning
the4oo yd. IM (4:03.68) and 200
yd. fly (1:51.79). His 400 IM
swim earned him a new Stan
ford varsity record as well.
Nichols outsped highly touted
Texan John McMahon eclips
ing the 200 yd. breast standard
with a fine 2:06.28.
Arriving three hours late, the
Stanford women were "stood
up" by their SMU counter
parts, and forced to watch the
evening festivities between the
Stanford and SMU men's
teams. The men, as they were
soon to find out, had not been
stood up. SMU was fired up
and rested; Stanford was phys
ically and mentally unpre
pared.
Only sophomores Paul
Hartloff and Andy Nichols
were able to garner wins.
Hartloff took the 500 and 1000
yd. freestyle events (4:32.73
and 9:19.88). Nichols won the
200 yd. breast, far outdistanc
ing opponents with a 2:06.46.

Championship. She posted
impressive times in winning
the 200 yd. fly (2:04.61) and
Ioooyd. free (10:07.32).
Men roll
Winning every swimming
event, the men also dominated
the tri-meet with Texas and
Texas A&M. The freestyle re
lay, which bettered the strin
gent cut-off standard by .05
seconds, culminated the
team's emotional effort.
Sophomores Andy Nichols and
Tom O'Brien led the one-sided
victory as both qualified for the
NCAA Championships.

O'Brien, only slightly rested
for the meet, swam back to
back events, but managed to
overcome his fatigue, winning
the4oo yd. IM (4:03.68) and 200
yd. fly (1:51.79). His 400 IM
swim earned him a new Stan
ford varsity record as well.
Nichols outsped highly touted
Texan John McMahon eclips
ing the 200 yd. breast standard
with a fine 2:06.28.
Arriving three hours late, the
Stanford women were "stood
up" by their SMU counter
parts, and forced to watch the
evening festivities between the
Stanford and SMU men's
teams. The men, as they were
soon to find out, had not been
stood up. SMU was fired up
and rested; Stanford was phys
ically and mentally unpre
pared.
Only sophomores Paul
Hartloff and Andy Nichols
were able to garner wins.
Hartloff took the 500 and 1000
yd. freestyle events (4:32.73
and 9:19.88). Nichols won the
200 yd. breast, far outdistanc
ing opponents with a 2:06.46.
The situation was ideal. The
many unique features of the
sparkling new indoor pool
complex at the University of
Texas promised fast times. An
army of female timers, clad in
orange T-shirts and white
shorts, paraded around the
deck. O u 'ckly forgetting
Southern Methodist Universi
ty's 75-37 romp over the men
on Friday, the Cardinal men
and women swimmers decided
to do things Texas style — win
ning big over host Texas and
Texas A&M.
"The new Texas pool is truly
one of the outstanding
facilities in the world," said
coach Jim Gaughran after the
meet. "Our swimmers, as a re
sult, were really up for the
meet and the times were excel
lent. I am quite pleased with
the progress both teams are
making this season. The train
ing we have done is definitely
paying off and will especially
manifest itself at the Nationals
in March."
The women, swimming in

their first dual meet in more
than a month, met with little
opposition as they stroked to
wins and fast mid-season
times. Senior captain Anne
Brodell neared lifetime bests in
the 200 yd. free (1:55.11) and
500 yd. free (4:58.08), qualify
ing her in both events for the
AIAW Championships at Duke
University.
Valerie Lee, Stanford's
Woman Athlete of the Year last
year, has already qualified in
four events for the AIAW
Championship. She posted
impressive times in winning
the 200 yd. fly (2:04.61) and
Ioooyd. free (10:07.32).
