Israel to resume talks
lerusalem — Israel dec ided yesterday to resume
military talks with Egypt, giving a new push to
Middle East peace negotiations following a cool
ing of the public war of words between the two
countries and intensive backstage U.S. diplomatic
efforts.
The military talks in Cairo between defense
ministers are expected to resume early this week.
But there was no indication after yesterday's regu
lar Israeli cabinet meeting when the parallel politi
cal negotiations in Jerusalem might resume.
"That is up to Egypt," cabinet secretary Aryeh
Naor said after the 3'/i-hour session. "It wasn't
Israel that broke off the talks."
Israeli officials said, however, that agreement is
possible as early as this week — before Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat confers with President
jimmy Carter in Washington — on a joint "declara
tion of principles" to outline future negotiations.
Agreement on the declaration would be the first
breakthrough since Sadat's trip to lerusalem in
November created the first real peace negotia
tions in the 30-year conflict.
Sadat visit has three objectives
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat's upcom
ing trip to the United States appears to have a
three-fold purpose: to ask U.S. leaders to put
political pressure on Israel, lobby Congress for
arms aid and sell his negotiating position to the
American public.
Sadat is scheduled to huddle with President
jimmy Carter in the secluded surroundings of
Camp David, Md., Saturday and Sunday for dis
cussions on the current status of Middle East
peace negotiations. He also plans meetings with
key members of Congress and the media.
Egyptian diplomats, legislators and newspapers
are calling for a change in what they see as Ameri
ca's "blind support" of Israel militarily and its un
willingness to alienate a long-time political ally.
"The trip would be a real success should we
succeed in changing the U.S. position," said a
Sunday editorial in Al Gomhouria, one of Cairo's
three leading daily newspapers.
African chief leads political rally
Soweto, South Africa — Stressing unity and self

reliance, Zulu Chief Gatsha Buthelezi told a throng
of 10,000 blacks yesterday they have "reached the
crossroads" in the fight for racial equality in
white-ruled South Africa.
The leader of the 5.5 million Zulus, the country s
largest tribe, told the roaring crowd who packed a
football stadium: "We owe it to the founding
fathers of the African National Congress, now
banned, and their successors, some deceased,
some exiled and some incarcerated, to uphold the
tradition of this titanic struggle for liberation."
Buthelezi, 49, the most vociferous government
critic within the country who has not been jailed,
attracted what appeared to be the largest black
audience ever at political rally in Soweto, a segre
gated township of 1.5 million, located 10 miles
southwest of Johannesburg. The majority of the
residents are Zulus.
Police are frequently out in force in the restive
township, but there was no sign of them yester
day.
Buthelezi was officially allowed to speak on the
understanding his theme would be upcoming
elections in the tribal homeland he leads,
Kwazulu, some 300 miles south of here.
Coal strike talks collapse again
Washington — Contract talks in the increasingly
bitter 54-day coal strike collapsed again yesterday
after the United Mine Workers union rejected the
industry's latest settlement proposal.
Delicate efforts to put together a settlement fell
apart when union and management negotiators
were unable to narrow their differences over
wages and other economic issues.
A spokesman for the Bituminous Coal
Operators Association, the industry's major bar
gaining group, issued a statement saying that talks
had "recessed indefinitely."
The strike by 160,000 UMW members already
was close to the longest walkout in the history of
the union's relationship with the coal operators
association. The longest previous .strike was in
1946, and lasted 59, days
. malpractice awards drop
Los Angeles — The number of malpractice
awards to California patients dropped 10 per cent

in 1977, but the amount of the average award rose
by 30 per cent, a state Board of Medical Quality
Assurance report says.
The report, released Friday, said 691 payments
of $3000 or more were reported in 1977, compared
to 773 the previous year. However, the amount of
the average award rose to $54,196, up from $41,705
in 1976.
There was one award of $1 million during 1977,
and none of that size in 1976, the report said.
The report was released during the board s reg
ular monthly meeting, held here Friday and Satur
day.
Inmates release more hostages
New Westminister, British Columbia — Inmates
holding 12 hostages after an abortive escape at
tempt at British Columbia Penitentiary released
two more women hostages yesterday in exchange
for food and drugs, authorities said.
"There was no trouble whatsoever with the ex
change," said Royal Canadian Mounted Police
spokesman Roy Picked. "They were released, they
appear to be okay. They will be examined medi
cally if they want, then they will be debriefed.'
He said the inmates issued new demands later
yesterday, but he refused to elaborate.
Five women remained among the 10 hostages
still being held yesterday.

Israel to resume talks
lerusalem — Israel dec ided yesterday to resume
military talks with Egypt, giving a new push to
Middle East peace negotiations following a cool
ing of the public war of words between the two
countries and intensive backstage U.S. diplomatic
efforts.
The military talks in Cairo between defense
ministers are expected to resume early this week.
But there was no indication after yesterday's regu
lar Israeli cabinet meeting when the parallel politi
cal negotiations in Jerusalem might resume.
"That is up to Egypt," cabinet secretary Aryeh
Naor said after the 3'/i-hour session. "It wasn't
Israel that broke off the talks."
Israeli officials said, however, that agreement is
possible as early as this week — before Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat confers with President
jimmy Carter in Washington — on a joint "declara
tion of principles" to outline future negotiations.
Agreement on the declaration would be the first
breakthrough since Sadat's trip to lerusalem in
November created the first real peace negotia
tions in the 30-year conflict.
Sadat visit has three objectives
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat's upcom
ing trip to the United States appears to have a
three-fold purpose: to ask U.S. leaders to put
political pressure on Israel, lobby Congress for
arms aid and sell his negotiating position to the
American public.
Sadat is scheduled to huddle with President
jimmy Carter in the secluded surroundings of
Camp David, Md., Saturday and Sunday for dis
cussions on the current status of Middle East
peace negotiations. He also plans meetings with
key members of Congress and the media.
Egyptian diplomats, legislators and newspapers
are calling for a change in what they see as Ameri
ca's "blind support" of Israel militarily and its un
willingness to alienate a long-time political ally.
"The trip would be a real success should we
succeed in changing the U.S. position," said a
Sunday editorial in Al Gomhouria, one of Cairo's
three leading daily newspapers.
African chief leads political rally
Soweto, South Africa — Stressing unity and self

reliance, Zulu Chief Gatsha Buthelezi told a throng
of 10,000 blacks yesterday they have "reached the
crossroads" in the fight for racial equality in
white-ruled South Africa.
The leader of the 5.5 million Zulus, the country s
largest tribe, told the roaring crowd who packed a
football stadium: "We owe it to the founding
fathers of the African National Congress, now
banned, and their successors, some deceased,
some exiled and some incarcerated, to uphold the
tradition of this titanic struggle for liberation."
Buthelezi, 49, the most vociferous government
critic within the country who has not been jailed,
attracted what appeared to be the largest black
audience ever at political rally in Soweto, a segre
gated township of 1.5 million, located 10 miles
southwest of Johannesburg. The majority of the
residents are Zulus.
Police are frequently out in force in the restive
township, but there was no sign of them yester
day.
Buthelezi was officially allowed to speak on the
understanding his theme would be upcoming
elections in the tribal homeland he leads,
Kwazulu, some 300 miles south of here.
Coal strike talks collapse again
Washington — Contract talks in the increasingly

after the United Mine Workers union rejected the

were unable to narrow their differences over
wages and other economic issues.
A spokesman for the Bituminous Coal
Operators Association, the industry's major bar
gaining group, issued a statement saying that talks
had "recessed indefinitely."
The strike by 160,000 UMW members already

of 10,000 blacks yesterday they have "reached the
crossroads" in the fight for racial equality in
white-ruled South Africa.
The leader of the 5.5 million Zulus, the country s
largest tribe, told the roaring crowd who packed a
football stadium: "We owe it to the founding
fathers of the African National Congress, now
banned, and their successors, some deceased,
some exiled and some incarcerated, to uphold the
tradition of this titanic struggle for liberation."
Buthelezi, 49, the most vociferous government
critic within the country who has not been jailed,
attracted what appeared to be the largest black
audience ever at political rally in Soweto, a segre
gated township of 1.5 million, located 10 miles
southwest of Johannesburg. The majority of the
residents are Zulus.
Police are frequently out in force in the restive
township, but there was no sign of them yester
day.
Buthelezi was officially allowed to speak on the
understanding his theme would be upcoming
elections in the tribal homeland he leads,
Kwazulu, some 300 miles south of here.
Coal strike talks collapse again
Washington — Contract talks in the increasingly
bitter 54-day coal strike collapsed again yesterday
after the United Mine Workers union rejected the
industry's latest settlement proposal.
Delicate efforts to put together a settlement fell
apart when union and management negotiators
were unable to narrow their differences over
wages and other economic issues.
A spokesman for the Bituminous Coal
Operators Association, the industry's major bar
gaining group, issued a statement saying that talks
had "recessed indefinitely."
The strike by 160,000 UMW members already
was close to the longest walkout in the history of
the union's relationship with the coal operators
association. The longest previous .strike was in
1946, and lasted 59, days

of $3000 or more were reported in 1977, compared
to 773 the previous year. However, the amount of
the average award rose to $54,196, up from $41,705
in 1976.
There was one award of $1 million during 1977,
and none of that size in 1976, the report said.

ular monthly meeting, held here Friday and Satur

Israel to resume talks
lerusalem — Israel dec ided yesterday to resume
military talks with Egypt, giving a new push to
Middle East peace negotiations following a cool
ing of the public war of words between the two
countries and intensive backstage U.S. diplomatic
efforts.
The military talks in Cairo between defense
ministers are expected to resume early this week.
But there was no indication after yesterday's regu
lar Israeli cabinet meeting when the parallel politi
cal negotiations in Jerusalem might resume.
"That is up to Egypt," cabinet secretary Aryeh
Naor said after the 3'/i-hour session. "It wasn't
Israel that broke off the talks."
Israeli officials said, however, that agreement is
possible as early as this week — before Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat confers with President
jimmy Carter in Washington — on a joint "declara
tion of principles" to outline future negotiations.
Agreement on the declaration would be the first
breakthrough since Sadat's trip to lerusalem in
November created the first real peace negotia
tions in the 30-year conflict.
Sadat visit has three objectives
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat's upcom
ing trip to the United States appears to have a
three-fold purpose: to ask U.S. leaders to put
political pressure on Israel, lobby Congress for
arms aid and sell his negotiating position to the
American public.
Sadat is scheduled to huddle with President
jimmy Carter in the secluded surroundings of
Camp David, Md., Saturday and Sunday for dis
cussions on the current status of Middle East
peace negotiations. He also plans meetings with
key members of Congress and the media.
Egyptian diplomats, legislators and newspapers
are calling for a change in what they see as Ameri
ca's "blind support" of Israel militarily and its un
willingness to alienate a long-time political ally.
"The trip would be a real success should we
succeed in changing the U.S. position," said a
Sunday editorial in Al Gomhouria, one of Cairo's
three leading daily newspapers.
