# Random process used
## Lyons to oversee selection of student CIR members 
### Craig Dennis 
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons announced Friday that the
selection of three students to serve
on the Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR) will begin today
and be completed by the end of this
week.
Lyons, acting on behalf of Univer
sity administrators, will oversee
selection of students to serve on the
CIR.
The ASSU Senate and Nominations
Committee have refused to nomi
nate students in protest of the Board
of Trustees modifications of the ad
hoc Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility's guidelines for the CIR
at their Dec. 13 meeting.
Lyons said a random process will
be used to select 12 students by
Wednesday who will meet privately
by the end of the week to recom
mend three of their group to serve
on the CIR.
Student response to the action was
quick and heavily critical of Univer
sity administrators.
Lloyd Dixon, a student member of
the ad hoc commission, called Presi
dent Richard Lyman a "dictator and
tyrant" for deciding to have students
appointed.
"I can't believe it," Dixon added.
"It shows how little power the ASSU
has. It exists only at the whim of the
administration."
"It is not what we like to do, but it
is a necessity," Vice President for
Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig
said. The CIR must make decisions
about upcoming proxy votes soon,
he continued.
"It would be far less preferable" to
go ahead without student input on
the CIR, Rosenzweig said.

"There is work to be done," Lyons
added. "The only virtue of this pro
cess is that it allows some students to
choose ... It is a two dimensional
choice â€” students choosing stu
dents."
Fred Grethel, chairperson of the
ASSU Senate, said, "I think there is
no possible way the Stanford com
munity could consider this legitimate
according to the (ASSU) constitu
tion."
Ellen Byrne, another student
member of the ad hoc commission,
said she was not surprised at the ac
tion. "I think it is indicative of the
role he (Lyman) plays in making sure
the students do not get through to
the trustees."
Noting the initial selection will be
done randomly by computers,
Rosenzweig said, "I think it will be
obvious to the students they (the
student CIR members)-will be cho
sen fairly without any regard to their

views."
The CIR may still recommend di
vestiture if it chooses, Lyons em
phasized.
Detailing the procedure, he said
an initial pool of 120 names will be
chosen at random, roughly one out
of every 49 enrolled students.
The list will then be divided into
four quartiles, alphabetically. Start
ing with the first name in each quar
tile, students will be called until 12
students are found who are willing to
serve on the CIR and participate in a
selection meeting.
Lyons or Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Dan Williams will convene the
meeting, make tentative suggestions
on the processes which might be
used to make a final recommenda
tion, then leave.
The final process will be deter
mined by the students themselves,
who then will make their recom
mendation to Lyman.
