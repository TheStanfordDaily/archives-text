# University's move on CIR expected
## 
### Craig Dennis News Analysis 
The decision by University ad
ministrators to set in motion the
selection process for nominating
students to the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) was
expected by most student leaders,
but met with angry opposition im
mediately.
Senate chairperson Fred Grethel
said Friday a resolution will be intro
duced at tomorrow's ASSU Senate
meeting condemning the action. The
senate had voted 11-6 Jan. 10 to sup
port the ASSU Nominations Commit
tee in its refusal to nominate stu
dents to the restructured CIR.
ASSU Co-president Anne Henkels,
one of three student members of the
ad hoc commission that had made
recommendations to the Board of
Trustees, said the only thing that
surprised her was the self-selection
process, calling it "very clever."
Final authority
Speaking on KZSU's Campus Con
ference on Jan. 17, President Richard
Lyman said, "My own opinion is
there ought to be students on this
council." Even with the senate's re
fusal to nominate, Lyman has the
final authority over student commit
tee appointments.
"I knew Lyman wanted students
on the committee," ASSU Co
president and Nominations Commit
tee Chairman Steve Westly said.
"They were in a very embarrassing
position in having to override the
ASSU Constitution which they them
selves certified."
The action by the administration is

not unprecedented. In 1971 Lyman
had students appointed to a new jud
icial pane! after the senate refused to
nominate students to the existing
judicial body.
However, this is the first time the
senate has opposed student nomina
tion to a committee having direct in
volvement with the Board of Trus
tees.
Apparently when Lyman returned
from a business trip Friday morning,
he gave the final go-ahead to Dean of
Student Affairs fames Lyonstoset the
selection process in motion.
Notification
Lyman's office received official
notification from Crethel of the se
nate's action Thursday.
Ironically, a conciliatory letter
from Westly probably reached
Lyman after Friday's decision. West
ly's letter was sent to the president's
office by inter-departmental mail late
Thursday afternoon:
In that letter, Westly said, "I hope
at this time we can keep the lines of
communication open for dialogue
concerning this issue. I would ask
you to secure time to discuss where
we go from here with me and other
student leaders and to talk about
concessions we might both make."
After hearing of the decision Friday
afternoon, Westly said, "We had
hoped we could have met with
Lyman and at least some of the trus
tees, including Dr. Peter Bing (board
president), before such action
needed to be taken."
But Lyman had expressed doubt
