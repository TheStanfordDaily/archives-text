# University's move on CIR expected
## 
### Craig Dennis News Analysis 
The decision by University ad
ministrators to set in motion the
selection process for nominating
students to the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) was
expected by most student leaders,
but met with angry opposition im
mediately.
Senate chairperson Fred Grethel
said Friday a resolution will be intro
duced at tomorrow's ASSU Senate
meeting condemning the action. The
senate had voted 11-6 Jan. 10 to sup
port the ASSU Nominations Commit
tee in its refusal to nominate stu
dents to the restructured CIR.
ASSU Co-president Anne Henkels,
one of three student members of the
ad hoc commission that had made
recommendations to the Board of
Trustees, said the only thing that
surprised her was the self-selection
process, calling it "very clever."
Final authority
Speaking on KZSU's Campus Con
ference on Jan. 17, President Richard
Lyman said, "My own opinion is
there ought to be students on this
council." Even with the senate's re
fusal to nominate, Lyman has the
final authority over student commit
tee appointments.
"I knew Lyman wanted students
on the committee," ASSU Co
president and Nominations Commit
tee Chairman Steve Westly said.
"They were in a very embarrassing
position in having to override the
ASSU Constitution which they them
selves certified."
The action by the administration is

not unprecedented. In 1971 Lyman
had students appointed to a new jud
icial pane! after the senate refused to
nominate students to the existing
judicial body.
However, this is the first time the
senate has opposed student nomina
tion to a committee having direct in
volvement with the Board of Trus
tees.
Apparently when Lyman returned
from a business trip Friday morning,
he gave the final go-ahead to Dean of
Student Affairs fames Lyonstoset the
selection process in motion.
Notification
Lyman's office received official
notification from Crethel of the se
nate's action Thursday.
Ironically, a conciliatory letter
from Westly probably reached
Lyman after Friday's decision. West
ly's letter was sent to the president's
office by inter-departmental mail late
Thursday afternoon:
In that letter, Westly said, "I hope
at this time we can keep the lines of
communication open for dialogue
concerning this issue. I would ask
you to secure time to discuss where
we go from here with me and other
student leaders and to talk about
concessions we might both make."
After hearing of the decision Friday
afternoon, Westly said, "We had
hoped we could have met with
Lyman and at least some of the trus
tees, including Dr. Peter Bing (board
president), before such action
needed to be taken."
But Lyman had expressed doubt
on Campus Conference that the trus
tees would reconsider their changes
in the ad hoc committee's report. "I
don't think they'd be in a hurry to do
anything, no, because I think there
would be a feeling on the board's
part, with some justification, that
they had gone the extra mile."
When he heard of Westly's letter
late Friday afternoon, Vice President
for Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig
said, "We would be willing to talk to
them. Setting the process in motion
does not mean its irreversible."
Lyons placed uncertainty into the
plans of some students who had
planned to lobby the 12 selectees. He
said Saturday he was "undecided"
on whether their names would be
released publicly before the 12 meet
to nominate the three student CIR
members.
Crethel had said Friday, "We will
try to encourage students not to par
ticipate on the committee. We think
we have a persuasive argument why
this would be a waste of their time."
However, Henkels said, "I feel if
students have read the document,
considered the questions and have
made a judgment that it would be
worth their while to serve on th 3 CIR,
I would not pressure that student to
change their judgement."
The conflict between the ASSU
and the Board of Trustees resulted
from modifications the trustees
made in the ad hoc commission's re
commendations on guidelines for
the CIR at their Dec. 13 meeting.
Differences center on how much
social responsibility the trustees
must consider under the new
guidelines and the "primarily
fiduciary responsibility" the trustees
have under current trust law.
Lyman has said the board's discus
sion on the CIR, which Assistant to
the President Robert Hamrdla said
lasted 4Vi hours, was the longest he
has ever seen on one subject.
Hamrdla said last Wednesday,

"The new statement adds considera
ble amounts of social responsibil
ity." But he said the trustees were
concerned the ad hoc commission's
report "would bind them too much."
"We cannot avoid what the (trust)
law says. That's not a realistic: view
point," he said.
Ellen Bryne, an ad hoc commission
member, said as far as her under
standing of trust law goes, "There is a
lot of flexibility and power to weigh
and absorb the costs of social re
sponsibility. The document comes
out as reading as trust law instead of
social responsibility."
The CIR was originally formed in
1971. After last May's Old Union
sit-in the trustees agreed to form the
ad hoc committee that would rede
fine the ClR's guidelines.
The sit-in and subsequently the ad
hoc committee grew out of protests
of the University's ownership of
stocks of companies with invest
ments in South Africa.
Back-up support
Last week, the Stanford Commit
tee for a Responsible Investment Pol
icy (SCRIP), the organizer of last
year's sit-in, backed the senate for its
refusal to nominate students to the
CIR.
In late November SCRIP de
manded that the trustees divest the
University's stock in nine corpora
tions with South Africa investments
by the board's next meeting on Feb.
14
Lyman said on Campus Confer
ence it is "reasonable to assume" the
trustees will not meet the Feb. 14
deadline set by SCRIP.
Last year 294 were arrested at Old
Union. Yet just last week only 45 per
sons showed up for an ASSU
sponsored informational meeting on
the CIR.
A confrontation between SCRIP
and the Board of Trustees is looming
in two weeks. Unless negotiations
occur soon, what happens next is a
very large question.

deadline set by SCRIP.
Last year 294 were arrested at Old
Union. Yet just last week only 45 per
sons showed up for an ASSU
sponsored informational meeting on
the CIR.
A confrontation between SCRIP
and the Board of Trustees is looming
in two weeks. Unless negotiations
occur soon, what happens next is a
very large question.
The decision by University ad
ministrators to set in motion the
selection process for nominating
students to the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) was
expected by most student leaders,
but met with angry opposition im
mediately.
Senate chairperson Fred Grethel
said Friday a resolution will be intro
duced at tomorrow's ASSU Senate
meeting condemning the action. The
senate had voted 11-6 Jan. 10 to sup
port the ASSU Nominations Commit
tee in its refusal to nominate stu
dents to the restructured CIR.
ASSU Co-president Anne Henkels,
one of three student members of the
ad hoc commission that had made
recommendations to the Board of
Trustees, said the only thing that
surprised her was the self-selection
process, calling it "very clever."
Final authority
Speaking on KZSU's Campus Con
ference on Jan. 17, President Richard
Lyman said, "My own opinion is
there ought to be students on this
council." Even with the senate's re
fusal to nominate, Lyman has the
final authority over student commit
tee appointments.
"I knew Lyman wanted students
on the committee," ASSU Co
president and Nominations Commit
tee Chairman Steve Westly said.
"They were in a very embarrassing
position in having to override the
ASSU Constitution which they them
selves certified."
The action by the administration is

not unprecedented. In 1971 Lyman
had students appointed to a new jud
icial pane! after the senate refused to
nominate students to the existing
judicial body.
However, this is the first time the
senate has opposed student nomina
tion to a committee having direct in
volvement with the Board of Trus
tees.
Apparently when Lyman returned
from a business trip Friday morning,
he gave the final go-ahead to Dean of
Student Affairs fames Lyonstoset the
selection process in motion.
Notification
Lyman's office received official
notification from Crethel of the se
nate's action Thursday.
Ironically, a conciliatory letter
from Westly probably reached
Lyman after Friday's decision. West
ly's letter was sent to the president's
office by inter-departmental mail late
Thursday afternoon:
In that letter, Westly said, "I hope
at this time we can keep the lines of
communication open for dialogue
concerning this issue. I would ask
you to secure time to discuss where
we go from here with me and other
student leaders and to talk about
concessions we might both make."
After hearing of the decision Friday
afternoon, Westly said, "We had
hoped we could have met with
Lyman and at least some of the trus
tees, including Dr. Peter Bing (board
president), before such action
needed to be taken."
But Lyman had expressed doubt
on Campus Conference that the trus
tees would reconsider their changes
in the ad hoc committee's report. "I
don't think they'd be in a hurry to do
anything, no, because I think there
would be a feeling on the board's
part, with some justification, that
they had gone the extra mile."
When he heard of Westly's letter
late Friday afternoon, Vice President
for Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig
said, "We would be willing to talk to
them. Setting the process in motion
does not mean its irreversible."
Lyons placed uncertainty into the
plans of some students who had
planned to lobby the 12 selectees. He
said Saturday he was "undecided"
on whether their names would be
released publicly before the 12 meet
to nominate the three student CIR
members.
Crethel had said Friday, "We will
try to encourage students not to par
ticipate on the committee. We think
we have a persuasive argument why
this would be a waste of their time."
However, Henkels said, "I feel if
students have read the document,
considered the questions and have
made a judgment that it would be
worth their while to serve on th 3 CIR,
I would not pressure that student to
change their judgement."
The conflict between the ASSU
and the Board of Trustees resulted
from modifications the trustees
made in the ad hoc commission's re
commendations on guidelines for
the CIR at their Dec. 13 meeting.
Differences center on how much
social responsibility the trustees
must consider under the new
guidelines and the "primarily
fiduciary responsibility" the trustees
have under current trust law.
Lyman has said the board's discus
sion on the CIR, which Assistant to
the President Robert Hamrdla said
lasted 4Vi hours, was the longest he
has ever seen on one subject.
Hamrdla said last Wednesday,

"The new statement adds considera
ble amounts of social responsibil
ity." But he said the trustees were
concerned the ad hoc commission's
report "would bind them too much."
"We cannot avoid what the (trust)
law says. That's not a realistic: view
point," he said.
Ellen Bryne, an ad hoc commission
member, said as far as her under
standing of trust law goes, "There is a
lot of flexibility and power to weigh
and absorb the costs of social re
sponsibility. The document comes
out as reading as trust law instead of
social responsibility."
The CIR was originally formed in
1971. After last May's Old Union
sit-in the trustees agreed to form the
ad hoc committee that would rede
fine the ClR's guidelines.
The sit-in and subsequently the ad
hoc committee grew out of protests
of the University's ownership of
stocks of companies with invest
ments in South Africa.

Last week, the Stanford Commit
tee for a Responsible Investment Pol
icy (SCRIP), the organizer of last
year's sit-in, backed the senate for its
refusal to nominate students to the
CIR.
In late November SCRIP de
manded that the trustees divest the
University's stock in nine corpora
tions with South Africa investments
by the board's next meeting on Feb.

refusal to nominate students to the
CIR.
In late November SCRIP de
manded that the trustees divest the
University's stock in nine corpora
tions with South Africa investments
by the board's next meeting on Feb.
14
Lyman said on Campus Confer
ence it is "reasonable to assume" the
trustees will not meet the Feb. 14
deadline set by SCRIP.
Last year 294 were arrested at Old
Union. Yet just last week only 45 per
sons showed up for an ASSU
sponsored informational meeting on
the CIR.
A confrontation between SCRIP
and the Board of Trustees is looming
in two weeks. Unless negotiations
occur soon, what happens next is a
very large question.
The decision by University ad
ministrators to set in motion the
selection process for nominating
students to the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) was
expected by most student leaders,
but met with angry opposition im
mediately.
Senate chairperson Fred Grethel
said Friday a resolution will be intro
duced at tomorrow's ASSU Senate
meeting condemning the action. The
senate had voted 11-6 Jan. 10 to sup
port the ASSU Nominations Commit
tee in its refusal to nominate stu
dents to the restructured CIR.
ASSU Co-president Anne Henkels,
one of three student members of the
ad hoc commission that had made
recommendations to the Board of
Trustees, said the only thing that
surprised her was the self-selection
process, calling it "very clever."
Final authority
Speaking on KZSU's Campus Con
ference on Jan. 17, President Richard
Lyman said, "My own opinion is
there ought to be students on this
council." Even with the senate's re
fusal to nominate, Lyman has the
final authority over student commit
tee appointments.
"I knew Lyman wanted students
on the committee," ASSU Co
president and Nominations Commit
tee Chairman Steve Westly said.
"They were in a very embarrassing
position in having to override the
ASSU Constitution which they them
selves certified."
The action by the administration is

not unprecedented. In 1971 Lyman
had students appointed to a new jud
icial pane! after the senate refused to
nominate students to the existing
judicial body.
However, this is the first time the
senate has opposed student nomina
tion to a committee having direct in
volvement with the Board of Trus
tees.
Apparently when Lyman returned
from a business trip Friday morning,
he gave the final go-ahead to Dean of
Student Affairs fames Lyonstoset the
selection process in motion.
Notification
Lyman's office received official
notification from Crethel of the se
nate's action Thursday.
Ironically, a conciliatory letter
from Westly probably reached
Lyman after Friday's decision. West
ly's letter was sent to the president's
office by inter-departmental mail late
Thursday afternoon:
In that letter, Westly said, "I hope
at this time we can keep the lines of
communication open for dialogue
concerning this issue. I would ask
you to secure time to discuss where
we go from here with me and other
student leaders and to talk about
concessions we might both make."
After hearing of the decision Friday
afternoon, Westly said, "We had
hoped we could have met with
Lyman and at least some of the trus
tees, including Dr. Peter Bing (board
president), before such action
needed to be taken."
But Lyman had expressed doubt
on Campus Conference that the trus
tees would reconsider their changes
in the ad hoc committee's report. "I
don't think they'd be in a hurry to do
anything, no, because I think there
would be a feeling on the board's
part, with some justification, that
they had gone the extra mile."
When he heard of Westly's letter
late Friday afternoon, Vice President
for Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig
said, "We would be willing to talk to
them. Setting the process in motion
does not mean its irreversible."
Lyons placed uncertainty into the
plans of some students who had
planned to lobby the 12 selectees. He
said Saturday he was "undecided"
on whether their names would be
released publicly before the 12 meet
to nominate the three student CIR
members.
Crethel had said Friday, "We will
try to encourage students not to par
ticipate on the committee. We think
we have a persuasive argument why
this would be a waste of their time."
However, Henkels said, "I feel if
students have read the document,
considered the questions and have
made a judgment that it would be
worth their while to serve on th 3 CIR,
I would not pressure that student to
change their judgement."
The conflict between the ASSU
and the Board of Trustees resulted
from modifications the trustees
made in the ad hoc commission's re
commendations on guidelines for
the CIR at their Dec. 13 meeting.
Differences center on how much
social responsibility the trustees
must consider under the new
guidelines and the "primarily
fiduciary responsibility" the trustees
have under current trust law.
Lyman has said the board's discus
sion on the CIR, which Assistant to
the President Robert Hamrdla said
lasted 4Vi hours, was the longest he
has ever seen on one subject.
Hamrdla said last Wednesday,

"The new statement adds considera
ble amounts of social responsibil
ity." But he said the trustees were
concerned the ad hoc commission's
report "would bind them too much."
"We cannot avoid what the (trust)
law says. That's not a realistic: view
point," he said.
Ellen Bryne, an ad hoc commission
member, said as far as her under
standing of trust law goes, "There is a
lot of flexibility and power to weigh
and absorb the costs of social re
sponsibility. The document comes
out as reading as trust law instead of
social responsibility."
The CIR was originally formed in
1971. After last May's Old Union
sit-in the trustees agreed to form the
ad hoc committee that would rede
fine the ClR's guidelines.
The sit-in and subsequently the ad
hoc committee grew out of protests
of the University's ownership of
stocks of companies with invest
ments in South Africa.
