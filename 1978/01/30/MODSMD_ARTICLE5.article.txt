# Six sororities plan spring rush
## 
### Cheryl Eschbach 
Up to six sororities here will host rush functions
this spring, organizers of sorority groups say.
Since the trustees' ban of sororities was lifted last
December, interest in sororities has been picking up
and is likely to culminate in the University's first rush
season in 34 years.
Altogether, six of the University's nine original
sorority chapters have indicated they want to return,
including Alphi Phi, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Delta
Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Pi Beta Phi and Delta
Delta Delta.
Rush is already underway for the Alpha Phi sorority.
Its function last Tuesday attracted about 25 under
graduate women. The most organized of the fledgl
ing sorority groups so far, Alpha Phi is a 10 pledge
member colony waiting to gain recognition from the
national sorority.
Alpha Phi pledge Janice Kimball said the sorority
hopes its rush activities will increase its, jmbership
to 30, thus making it eligible for chapter status.
Undergraduate women associated with Kappa
Kappa Gamma, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta and
Pi Beta Phi sororities are also recruiting potential
pledges and planning spring rush functions.
Forming colonies
Attracting about 40 women to an informational
meeting last Saturday, the Kappa Kappa Gamma
sorority group anticipates a "very successful" rush
season, according to organizer Lola Nashashibi. Stu
dents already committed to the sorority will form a
colony tomorrow night so they can later petition for
chapter status.
Delta Gamma and Kappa Alpha Theta organizers
Sue Schiller and Nancy Hoffman said they plan to
colonize and conduct spring rush as well. The Delta
Gamma group had its first rush party yesterday.
In addition, alumnae from the Pi Beta Phi and

Kappa Delta sororities have expressed interest in re
turning to the campus, and will be holding informa
tional meetings next week.
Organizers of each sorority say they want spring
rush to be a Panhellenic effort, which emphasizes
cooperation rather than competition.
Unpromising prospects for immediate housing ar
rangements have led alumnae and student organizers
to consider alternatives such as an off-campus lodge.
All sororities would hold meetings and social func
tions there, but the building would not house soror
ity members.
If a chapter obtains campus housing, its activities
will be subject to University sorority policy, which
includes a ban on alumnae recommendations as an
eligibility requirement, Norm Robinson, associate
dean of residential education, said.
The University recognizes neither sororities now
being formed nor national sorority chapters, but rec
ognizes resident sorority'organizations "in name
only," he added. .
The University's goal of minimizing national inter
ference seems to be shared by campus sorority
groups.
"We don't want to be tied to each other through
our mother's friends' recommendations," stated
Kappa affiliate Ann Murphy.
Nashashibi added, "We want sororities here to be
as casual as possible — something that will add to
college life rather than change it."
At a student-alumnae meeting last Wednesday,
alumnae said they were sensitive to the Administra
tion's concerns, and aware of the "grass roots"
character of the University's sorority movement.
Alumnae from the Delta Gamma, Pi Beta Phi, and
Kappa Delta sororities, stressed the changes in na
tional organization which permit more campus au
tonomy.

Up to six sororities here will host rush functions
this spring, organizers of sorority groups say.
Since the trustees' ban of sororities was lifted last
December, interest in sororities has been picking up
and is likely to culminate in the University's first rush
season in 34 years.
Altogether, six of the University's nine original
sorority chapters have indicated they want to return,
including Alphi Phi, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Delta
Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Pi Beta Phi and Delta
Delta Delta.
Rush is already underway for the Alpha Phi sorority.
Its function last Tuesday attracted about 25 under
graduate women. The most organized of the fledgl
ing sorority groups so far, Alpha Phi is a 10 pledge
member colony waiting to gain recognition from the
national sorority.
Alpha Phi pledge Janice Kimball said the sorority
hopes its rush activities will increase its, jmbership
to 30, thus making it eligible for chapter status.
Undergraduate women associated with Kappa
Kappa Gamma, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta and
Pi Beta Phi sororities are also recruiting potential
pledges and planning spring rush functions.
Forming colonies
Attracting about 40 women to an informational
meeting last Saturday, the Kappa Kappa Gamma
sorority group anticipates a "very successful" rush
season, according to organizer Lola Nashashibi. Stu
dents already committed to the sorority will form a
colony tomorrow night so they can later petition for
chapter status.
Delta Gamma and Kappa Alpha Theta organizers
Sue Schiller and Nancy Hoffman said they plan to
colonize and conduct spring rush as well. The Delta
Gamma group had its first rush party yesterday.
In addition, alumnae from the Pi Beta Phi and

Kappa Delta sororities have expressed interest in re
turning to the campus, and will be holding informa
tional meetings next week.
Organizers of each sorority say they want spring
rush to be a Panhellenic effort, which emphasizes
cooperation rather than competition.
Unpromising prospects for immediate housing ar
rangements have led alumnae and student organizers
to consider alternatives such as an off-campus lodge.
All sororities would hold meetings and social func
tions there, but the building would not house soror
ity members.
If a chapter obtains campus housing, its activities
will be subject to University sorority policy, which
includes a ban on alumnae recommendations as an
eligibility requirement, Norm Robinson, associate
dean of residential education, said.
The University recognizes neither sororities now
being formed nor national sorority chapters, but rec
ognizes resident sorority'organizations "in name
only," he added. .
The University's goal of minimizing national inter
ference seems to be shared by campus sorority
groups.
"We don't want to be tied to each other through
our mother's friends' recommendations," stated
Kappa affiliate Ann Murphy.
Nashashibi added, "We want sororities here to be
as casual as possible — something that will add to
college life rather than change it."
At a student-alumnae meeting last Wednesday,
alumnae said they were sensitive to the Administra
tion's concerns, and aware of the "grass roots"
character of the University's sorority movement.
Alumnae from the Delta Gamma, Pi Beta Phi, and
Kappa Delta sororities, stressed the changes in na
tional organization which permit more campus au
tonomy.
