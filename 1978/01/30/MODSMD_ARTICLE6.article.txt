It's long been a tradition
for an editor to offer up a few
random thoughts on the first
day of his or her volume, and
as this column indicates, I'm
hardly one to deny tradition.
Besides, neither am I one to
turn down the chance to see
my thoughts set in 11 point
type. (For those of you who
don't know the buzz-words,
that means the easy-read print
you're looking at right now.)
It's also traditional for a new
editor to set down some of the
goals that have been set for
the volume.
Well: welcome to Vol. 173.
Please help me restaff this
newspaper.
Take a look at the staff box
down there. Even if you're a
Daily groupie, you probably
won't recognize a few names.
Don't be ashamed; a week
ago I didn't recognize a few of
those names, and I'm the one
who hired them.
The reason you don't rec
ognize them: one's a certified
rookie, three are freshmen
and the managing editor is a
sophomore.
It's quite a strain for a basi
cally volunteer organization
with a small, inexperienced
staff to put out a daily news
paper. It occasionally amazes
me that we actually get the
paper out each morning. (It
always amazes me when one
of our staff members actually
graduates.)
For a variety of reasons, the
staffing situation here is the
worst I have ever seen. So if
you're at all interested in writ
ing, layout, editing or running
a darkroom, this is probably
your best chance ever to join
the madhouse.

The opportunities for ad
vancement are great; there's
no one to get in your way. And
the paper will be better for
your being here. Maybe you
can help us avoid such mis
takes as running a front page
story on William Shockley on
the first day of Black Libera
tion Month.
I know part of the Daily's
image is that we're a small
clique, roughly analogous to
the COP/ASSU clique, living
in our own little world, suffer
ing from tunnel vision and
writing only about what in
terests us.
That's probably correct.
But the only sure way for
stories that interest you to ap
pear in the Daily is for you to
write them. The only answer is
a bigger, more diverse staff.
If you'd like to write for the
Daily, be it once a week, twice
a week or 10 times a week like
our incurable addicts, please
attend a staff meeting this
Tuesday or Thursday. Or call
Karen Wada or Mike Charlson
at 497-4632.
If I've still got your atten
tion, I'd like to discuss some
of the changes I'd like to see in
this newspaper's coverage.
Self-aggrandizement is out.
And if one of the staff mem
bers resigns a day earlier than
planned, don't look for a
Point/Counterpoint on page
two.
We'll serve readers better
and make better use of your
dollars by writing much more
about you.
If you hear of a good story
that we might have missed,
give us a call and let us know.
Sorry, we can't offer toasters
or Kawasakis for the best news

tip of the week, but we can
offer finer reading with your
cornflakes.
Thursday, sad to say, will
not appear as a magazine this
volume. Stephen Crolius,
former Thursday editor, had
always intended to resign last
week, although not quite as
abruptly.
Because the Daily is so
short-staffed, no qualified
editor was available to put the
magazine together. Its two
most popular aspects, news
features and Bay Area Events,
will be included in the regular
format.
The Daily has no plans to
launch a separate weekly. Two
former staffers, however, are
considering publishing an in
dependent weekly on cam
pus, and we wish them the
best of luck.
