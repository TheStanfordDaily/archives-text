# Quality of education declining
##

Of all the occupations which pre
sently contribute to the integrity of
the American capitalist system,
teaching is by far the most important.
At levels from elementary school
through post-graduate work, but
particularly with regard to children,
its influence on the character of fu
ture society is second only to parent
hood. Nevertheless, recent years
have witnessed an apparent decline
in the quality of American education,
reflecting failure to recognize it as a
vital entity.
Based upon their average duration
of training, instructors at all levels are
among the lowest paid members of
our society — provided they can find
work. Thousands of qualified
elementary and secondary school
teachers are presently unemployed,
doing unrelated menial work, serv
ing as substitutes, or earning
mediocre salaries.
At the college level, the untenured
proressor can expect to earn less
than the unionized factory employee
after training for as long as a physi
cian or lawyer. This lack of financial
incentive in American education
tends to detract from the individual's
enthusiasm for teaching, and the
student suffers in the long run.
Limitations
Financial limitations on education
have come directly from both local
budget cutbacks and skyrocketing
college costs. Many city schools have
been threatened with curtailment of
such valuable extracurricular ac
tivities as interscholastic athletics,
which are clearly as important to
educa'ional development as tradi
tional academic disciplines.
Crowded classrooms, equipment
limitations, overworked teachers,
and depersonalized students are the
rule in many instances, simply due to
lack of adequate fund allocation.
Higher education presently runs the
risk of pricing itself into extinction,
as more students come to realize that
the returns may not justify the in
vestment. Scholarship and loan
money has become more scarce
from all sources in recent years, and
were it not for libraries, few students
could afford to glance at a textbook.
The most tragic effect of these
trends is the simple fact that our edu
cational system is failing to achieve
its purpose. Numerous studies have
revealed that shocking numbers of
American children and adolescents
have grossly deficient trading skills.
Others despise school and sub
sequently develop behavior patterns
which force their instructors to func
tion instead as disciplinarians. While
it is tempting to blame the individual
student for failure in school, a sig
nificant number of these people
might be aided by optimal learning
conditions from the outset.

The decline of American education
is reflected in other equally shameful
statistics. A recent government study
revealed that among young people,
three of five males, two of five
females, and one of four children
under age 12 are "heavy drinkers."
Extrapolation of these findings to
smoking, marijuana, and drugs
points a grim overall picture of
American society in the future.
Lacking inspiration and often op
portunity for participation in ex
tracurricular school activities, and
unable to find part-time after-school
employment, it becomes difficult to
blame delinquency entirely on the
individual. Rather, our society may
be justly criticized for negligent care
of youth, its most valuable asset.
More emphasis
It is clear from the preceding re
marks that a greater emphasis —
both attitudinally and financially — is
needed on improving and maintain
ing the quality of American educa
tion. While presently attempting to
solve our many domestic and inter
national problems directly, we run
the risk of paradoxical failure by
slighting the training of our succes
sors.
Stated somewhat differently, it
may be possible to build a better soc
iety only by starting from scratch and
performing each critical step without

cutting corners. Essential to success
is the kind of financial commitment
of which Americans seem perfectly
capable when it comes to building
nuclear weapons, fighting a foreign
war, or exploring the cosmos.
