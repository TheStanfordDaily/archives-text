Q: When will the 'Daily'
start running stories
I want to read??
A: When you start
writing them.
A common fallacy around campus is that the Daily can publish any
story on campus, cover every event, any time it may happen. But
the Daily can only cover those stories and events for which it can
get reporters. We want to make the Daily an even better news
paper, but we need your help. People talented in writing or
layout, proofreading or general copy editing are all needed.
Sound interesting? Then try us. New staff meetings are being held
today and Thursday at the Daily office. We're easy to find â€” just
across the mall from Terman Engineering Center. So join us!
