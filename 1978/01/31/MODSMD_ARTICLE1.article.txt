# I thought they only picked brains in Organic Chem

### Andrea James 
I had never seen an operation per
formed so I didn't know what to ex
pect last Thursday morning when I
watched a tumor being removed
from the brain of a 69-year-old
female Stanford University Hospital
patient. Before Thursday I imagined
Stanford's operating rooms to be like
the Hollywood versions of operating
rooms — filled with overdramatic,
egotistical surgeons, faulty medical
equipment and patients suffering
from numerous complications.
Don't believe Hollywood versions
of operating rooms. In the case I saw,
the surgeons were cool and assisting
medical personnel efficient. The
equipment didn't break down and
the patient didn't have a cardiac ar
rest.
Dr. Gerald Silverberg, Stanford
neurosurgeon, and Dr. Richard Britt,
resident in neurosurgery, performed
the operation. In December the pa
tient saw them, complaining of
numbness on the left side of her
face, from cheek to lower jaw. Diag
nosis revealed the numbness was
being caused by a tumor pressing on
the fifth nerve of the brain.
The symptoms had begun earlier
that year, in April and May. A few
weeks prior to surgery, the patient
began complaining of lossof equilib
rium. The surgeons found that the
tumor was beginning to hollow out a
cup in the brain stem, causing the
patient's loss of balance. Had the

tumor not been removed, it would
have eventually interfered with the
stem to the extent that the body's
respiratory and circulatory action
would have stopped, Silverberg said.
Spectators
The hospital has no observation
rooms so spectators have to be in
surgery, standingdirectly behind the
surgeon. I walked into the operating
room about 9 a.m., dressed in bulky
surgical garb. The patient had been
wheeled into surgery about 7:30 so
the scalp and skull over the tumor
had already been removed.
At first, it was hard to distinguish
the position of the patient on the
operating table. The entire body was
covered with layers of protective
cloths; only a small area of head was
bare. The surgeons were cutting
open a section of brain about the size
ol a silver dollar. They were working
directly behind the patient's right
ear, so the patient was lying on her
left side facing the far wall of the
operating room. A needle extended
from her lower back, draining the
spinal fluid.
Surgery steps
One of the most time-consuming
steps in brain surgery is stopping the
excessive bleeding. Flannel, cel
lulose fiber and bone wax were used
during the operation to speed up
clotting and control blood flow. Elec
tric impulses were used to cauterize
or "cook" as the surgeons said, veins
and smaller blood vessels. The drug

Manitol had been injected into the
patient prior to surgery to cause
temporary brain shrinkage and pre
vent the brain from swelling during
surgery.
Before cutting into the dura (the
outer membrane protecting the
brain), the, surgeons first smoothed
the raw bone around the incision,
using an electric drill. The skull had
originally been cut with a brace and
bit.
The dura was pulled back from the
brain and pinned to the protective
material and plastic surrounding the
incision. This exposed the cerebel
lum, which Silverberg described as a
"cauliflower-like mass" covering the
brain stem and cranial nerves.
Cerebellum cut
In many cases, an observing intern
told me, a portion of the cerebellum
is cut away to gain access to the
tumor. Here, however, the tissue
was merely pushed over to expose
the tumor.
"Removing parts of the cerebel
lum often results in unsteadiness,"
said Silverberg. "However, this
symptom often goes away. The cere
bellum is a very redundant organ. It
seems that its function of controlling
balance, coordination and motor
movements overlap so that often the
motor movements lost by taking
away parts of the cerebellum can be
releamed."
The brain tumor was about the size
of a large olive, and was encased in a

firm capsule. In order to remove it,
surgeons needed magnification. A
large microscope and television
camera, most of which was wrapped
in sterilized plastic, was placed over
the incision. I watched the rest of the
operation from a closed circuit color
television inside the operating room.
The surgeons peered through the
microscopic lenses and performed
the surgery with 10 times magnifica
tion. Parts of the surgery were filmed
to show medical students at a later
date.
"We pull the tumor away from the
brain," Silverberg explained during
surgery. "We shell out the mucoid
interior, forcing the tumor to col
lapse on itself."
Diagnosis
Bits of the tumor's interior were
sent to pathology and diagnosis re
vealed the tumor was benign.
"We had a good idea that it was
benign because most tumors in that
location are not malignant," Silver
berg said. "Had the tumor been
malignant and reaching down far
into the brain, we wouldn't have
been able to remove it all."
Unless all of the tumor is removed,
it usually grows back and the patient
is never cured the surgeon added.
After most of the tumor's interior
had been shelled out, surgeons
began cutting away the adhesions ex
tending from the tumor to surround
ing brain matter. It was necessary for

as they snipped the adhesions he
cause the mass began pushing down
on another nerve.
The tumor had wrapped itself
around two veins and the surgeons
were forced to cauterize the vessels
in order to assure c omplete removal
of the tumor.
Last pieces
At 11:30 a.m. the surgeons re
moved the last pieces of tumor from
the brain. Everyone in theoperationg
room felt release of tension as Sil
verberg held up the last piece of
tumor.
Because the skull in that area of the
head is not thick and therefore does
not provide considerable protection
for the brain, surgeons did not re
place it. Instead, the incision was co
vered with the neck muscles re
moved at the beginning of surgery
which were soaking in a saline
antibiotic solution.
Total surgery time was about four
hours and 15 minutes.
"This tumor came out tairly eas
ily," Silverberg said. "I've been in
surgery for as much as 14 hours get
ting out more tenacious tumors.
Silverberg commented yesterday
that he felt the surgery went ver\
well. He said the patient has already
regained considerable sensation on
the left side of her face and feels
more secure walking. She will prob
ably go home this weekend.

Last pieces
At 11:30 a.m. the surgeons re
moved the last pieces of tumor from
the brain. Everyone in theoperationg
room felt release of tension as Sil
verberg held up the last piece of
tumor.
Because the skull in that area of the
head is not thick and therefore does
not provide considerable protection
for the brain, surgeons did not re
place it. Instead, the incision was co
vered with the neck muscles re
moved at the beginning of surgery
which were soaking in a saline
antibiotic solution.
Total surgery time was about four
hours and 15 minutes.
"This tumor came out tairly eas
ily," Silverberg said. "I've been in
surgery for as much as 14 hours get
ting out more tenacious tumors.

I had never seen an operation per
formed so I didn't know what to ex
pect last Thursday morning when I
watched a tumor being removed
from the brain of a 69-year-old
female Stanford University Hospital
patient. Before Thursday I imagined
Stanford's operating rooms to be like
the Hollywood versions of operating
rooms — filled with overdramatic,
egotistical surgeons, faulty medical
equipment and patients suffering
from numerous complications.
Don't believe Hollywood versions
of operating rooms. In the case I saw,
the surgeons were cool and assisting
medical personnel efficient. The
equipment didn't break down and
the patient didn't have a cardiac ar
rest.
Dr. Gerald Silverberg, Stanford
neurosurgeon, and Dr. Richard Britt,
resident in neurosurgery, performed
the operation. In December the pa
tient saw them, complaining of
numbness on the left side of her
face, from cheek to lower jaw. Diag
nosis revealed the numbness was
being caused by a tumor pressing on
the fifth nerve of the brain.
The symptoms had begun earlier
that year, in April and May. A few
weeks prior to surgery, the patient
began complaining of lossof equilib
rium. The surgeons found that the
tumor was beginning to hollow out a
cup in the brain stem, causing the
patient's loss of balance. Had the

tumor not been removed, it would
have eventually interfered with the
stem to the extent that the body's
respiratory and circulatory action
would have stopped, Silverberg said.
Spectators
The hospital has no observation
rooms so spectators have to be in
surgery, standingdirectly behind the
surgeon. I walked into the operating
room about 9 a.m., dressed in bulky
surgical garb. The patient had been
wheeled into surgery about 7:30 so
the scalp and skull over the tumor
had already been removed.
At first, it was hard to distinguish
the position of the patient on the
operating table. The entire body was
covered with layers of protective
cloths; only a small area of head was
bare. The surgeons were cutting
open a section of brain about the size
ol a silver dollar. They were working
directly behind the patient's right
ear, so the patient was lying on her
left side facing the far wall of the
operating room. A needle extended
from her lower back, draining the
spinal fluid.
Surgery steps
One of the most time-consuming
steps in brain surgery is stopping the
excessive bleeding. Flannel, cel
lulose fiber and bone wax were used
during the operation to speed up
clotting and control blood flow. Elec
tric impulses were used to cauterize
or "cook" as the surgeons said, veins
and smaller blood vessels. The drug

Manitol had been injected into the
patient prior to surgery to cause
temporary brain shrinkage and pre
vent the brain from swelling during
surgery.
Before cutting into the dura (the
outer membrane protecting the
brain), the, surgeons first smoothed
the raw bone around the incision,
using an electric drill. The skull had
originally been cut with a brace and
bit.
The dura was pulled back from the
brain and pinned to the protective
material and plastic surrounding the
incision. This exposed the cerebel
lum, which Silverberg described as a
"cauliflower-like mass" covering the
brain stem and cranial nerves.
Cerebellum cut
In many cases, an observing intern
told me, a portion of the cerebellum
is cut away to gain access to the
tumor. Here, however, the tissue
was merely pushed over to expose
the tumor.
"Removing parts of the cerebel
lum often results in unsteadiness,"
said Silverberg. "However, this
symptom often goes away. The cere
bellum is a very redundant organ. It
seems that its function of controlling
balance, coordination and motor
movements overlap so that often the
motor movements lost by taking
away parts of the cerebellum can be
releamed."
The brain tumor was about the size
of a large olive, and was encased in a

firm capsule. In order to remove it,
surgeons needed magnification. A
large microscope and television
camera, most of which was wrapped
in sterilized plastic, was placed over
the incision. I watched the rest of the
operation from a closed circuit color
television inside the operating room.
The surgeons peered through the
microscopic lenses and performed
the surgery with 10 times magnifica
tion. Parts of the surgery were filmed
to show medical students at a later
date.
"We pull the tumor away from the
brain," Silverberg explained during
surgery. "We shell out the mucoid
interior, forcing the tumor to col
lapse on itself."
Diagnosis
Bits of the tumor's interior were
sent to pathology and diagnosis re
vealed the tumor was benign.
"We had a good idea that it was
benign because most tumors in that
location are not malignant," Silver
berg said. "Had the tumor been
malignant and reaching down far
into the brain, we wouldn't have
been able to remove it all."
Unless all of the tumor is removed,
it usually grows back and the patient
is never cured the surgeon added.

the tumor.
"Removing parts of the cerebel
lum often results in unsteadiness,"
said Silverberg. "However, this
symptom often goes away. The cere
bellum is a very redundant organ. It
seems that its function of controlling
balance, coordination and motor
movements overlap so that often the
motor movements lost by taking
away parts of the cerebellum can be
releamed."
The brain tumor was about the size
of a large olive, and was encased in a

firm capsule. In order to remove it,
surgeons needed magnification. A
large microscope and television
camera, most of which was wrapped
in sterilized plastic, was placed over
the incision. I watched the rest of the
operation from a closed circuit color
television inside the operating room.
The surgeons peered through the
microscopic lenses and performed
the surgery with 10 times magnifica
tion. Parts of the surgery were filmed
to show medical students at a later
date.
"We pull the tumor away from the
brain," Silverberg explained during
surgery. "We shell out the mucoid
interior, forcing the tumor to col
lapse on itself."
Diagnosis
Bits of the tumor's interior were
sent to pathology and diagnosis re

"We had a good idea that it was
benign because most tumors in that
location are not malignant," Silver
berg said. "Had the tumor been
malignant and reaching down far
into the brain, we wouldn't have
been able to remove it all."
Unless all of the tumor is removed,
it usually grows back and the patient
is never cured the surgeon added.

cause the mass began pushing down
on another nerve.
The tumor had wrapped itself
around two veins and the surgeons
were forced to cauterize the vessels
in order to assure c omplete removal
of the tumor.
Last pieces
At 11:30 a.m. the surgeons re
moved the last pieces of tumor from
the brain. Everyone in theoperationg
room felt release of tension as Sil
verberg held up the last piece of
tumor.
Because the skull in that area of the
head is not thick and therefore does
not provide considerable protection
for the brain, surgeons did not re
place it. Instead, the incision was co
vered with the neck muscles re
moved at the beginning of surgery
which were soaking in a saline
antibiotic solution.
Total surgery time was about four
hours and 15 minutes.
"This tumor came out tairly eas
ily," Silverberg said. "I've been in
surgery for as much as 14 hours get
ting out more tenacious tumors.
Silverberg commented yesterday
that he felt the surgery went ver\
well. He said the patient has already
regained considerable sensation on
the left side of her face and feels
more secure walking. She will prob

I had never seen an operation per
formed so I didn't know what to ex
pect last Thursday morning when I
watched a tumor being removed
from the brain of a 69-year-old
female Stanford University Hospital
patient. Before Thursday I imagined
Stanford's operating rooms to be like
the Hollywood versions of operating
rooms — filled with overdramatic,
egotistical surgeons, faulty medical
equipment and patients suffering
from numerous complications.
Don't believe Hollywood versions
of operating rooms. In the case I saw,
the surgeons were cool and assisting
medical personnel efficient. The
equipment didn't break down and
the patient didn't have a cardiac ar
rest.
Dr. Gerald Silverberg, Stanford
neurosurgeon, and Dr. Richard Britt,
resident in neurosurgery, performed
the operation. In December the pa
tient saw them, complaining of
numbness on the left side of her
face, from cheek to lower jaw. Diag
nosis revealed the numbness was
being caused by a tumor pressing on
the fifth nerve of the brain.
The symptoms had begun earlier
that year, in April and May. A few
weeks prior to surgery, the patient
began complaining of lossof equilib
rium. The surgeons found that the
tumor was beginning to hollow out a
cup in the brain stem, causing the
patient's loss of balance. Had the

tumor not been removed, it would
have eventually interfered with the
stem to the extent that the body's
respiratory and circulatory action
would have stopped, Silverberg said.
Spectators
The hospital has no observation
rooms so spectators have to be in
surgery, standingdirectly behind the
surgeon. I walked into the operating
room about 9 a.m., dressed in bulky
surgical garb. The patient had been
wheeled into surgery about 7:30 so
the scalp and skull over the tumor
had already been removed.
At first, it was hard to distinguish
the position of the patient on the
operating table. The entire body was
covered with layers of protective
cloths; only a small area of head was
bare. The surgeons were cutting
open a section of brain about the size
ol a silver dollar. They were working
directly behind the patient's right
ear, so the patient was lying on her
left side facing the far wall of the
operating room. A needle extended
from her lower back, draining the
spinal fluid.
Surgery steps
One of the most time-consuming
steps in brain surgery is stopping the
excessive bleeding. Flannel, cel
lulose fiber and bone wax were used
during the operation to speed up
clotting and control blood flow. Elec
tric impulses were used to cauterize
or "cook" as the surgeons said, veins
and smaller blood vessels. The drug

Manitol had been injected into the
patient prior to surgery to cause
temporary brain shrinkage and pre
vent the brain from swelling during
surgery.
Before cutting into the dura (the
outer membrane protecting the
brain), the, surgeons first smoothed
the raw bone around the incision,
using an electric drill. The skull had
originally been cut with a brace and
bit.
The dura was pulled back from the
brain and pinned to the protective
material and plastic surrounding the
incision. This exposed the cerebel
lum, which Silverberg described as a
"cauliflower-like mass" covering the
brain stem and cranial nerves.
Cerebellum cut
In many cases, an observing intern
told me, a portion of the cerebellum
is cut away to gain access to the
tumor. Here, however, the tissue
was merely pushed over to expose
the tumor.
"Removing parts of the cerebel
lum often results in unsteadiness,"
said Silverberg. "However, this
symptom often goes away. The cere
bellum is a very redundant organ. It
seems that its function of controlling
balance, coordination and motor
