# Time to find out about UFO's

We hear a lot about UFO's these
days. What, you haven't watched the
movie "Close Encounters of the Third
Kind" yet? Should we believe in
UFO's? I believe this is an extremely
badly phrased question. But before
attempting to deal with this problem,
I must quote Woody Allen:
" .. .Up until now, the entire sub
ject of flying saucers has been mostly
associated with kooks or oddballs.
Frequently, in fact, observers will
admit to being a member of both
groups. Still, persistent sightings by
responsible individuals have caused
the Air Force and the scientific com
munity to reexamine a once skeptical
attitude. The sum of $200 (two
hundred) has now been allocated for
a comprehensive study of the
phenomenon. The question is: Is
anything out there? And if so, do they
have ray guns?
"All UFO's may not prove to be of
extraterrestrial origin, but experts do
agree that any glowing cigar-shaped
aircraft capable of rising straight up
at 12 miles per second would require
the kind of maintenance and spark
plugs available only on Pluto. If these
objects are indeed from another
planet, then the civilization that de
signed them must be millions of
years more advanced that our own.
Either that or they are very lucky.
"Prof. Leon Speciman postulates a
civilization in outer space that is
more advanced than ours by approx
imately 15 minutes. This, he feels,
gives them a great advantage over us,

since they needn't rush to get ap
pointments." (Woody Allen, in The
Washington Post, 26 )une 77).
The UFO's, (if they exist), are
natural phenomena. One does
believe in them, in the same way that
one does not believe in trees or
rocks. According to the scientific
method, one holds facts (or theories)
to be true if there exists reproducible
scientific evidence to corrorborate 4
them. Our approach to the UFO
problem should be simple and down
to earth, without mixing in "psychic
phenomena," "alterations of con
sciousness," "salvation of human
ity," or anything of the like.
Is there right now enough scien
tific, reproducible evidence which
proves tFiat UFO's exist! 1 And if there
exists such evidence, does it explain
what UFO's realy are? It looks to me
that the answer to both of these
questions is negative. At least, this is
what the Air Force claims, in "Project
Blue Book," which attempted to in
vestigate UFO sightings.
The problem is, the Air Force never
investigated UFO phenomena as
they happened; "Project Blue Book"
mainly involved interviewing eye
witnesses after the fact, and
pigeon-holing their stories into pos
sible mundane explanations. The
most common ones: meteorites, satel
lites, aircraft, meteoroligical bal
loons and swamp gas phenomena.
The Air Force admits that there is a
sizable percentage of cases (about 15
to 25 per cent) which simply cannot
be explained. (I would say explained
away).
The most exciting explanation, of
course, is that UFO's are spacecraft
built and manned by aliens belong
ing to a civilization from outer space.
But no scientist, engineer, or Air
Force officer will stake his reputation
or career on such an explanation. It is
much easier to invoke meteorologi
cal balloons or falling meteorites.
(Swamp gas is more difficult, since
you need a swamp. Will Lake
Lagunita do? I wonder.)
Well documented rumors say that
the famous Austrian astronomer and
astrophysicist Flermann Oberth be
lieved in the extraterrestrial explana

tion tor UFO s, but he communi
cated that to his close friends only.
Still, there exists an overwhelming
amount of testimony, from all over
the world, by people who cannot be
suspected of being kooks or
oddballs, of UFO sightings which
cannot be conventionally explained.
These include President (immy Car
ter himself who sighted a UFO while
being the governor of Georgia. Car
ter recently wrote a letter to the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration asking the dgency
whether it would be teasibL 1 to inves
tigate the UFO phenomenon. The
agency's answer was that until
further evidence is accumulated, it
does not seem feasible to investigate
UFO's. (Catch 22).
In my opinion it may be possible
to investigate UFO's relatively
cheaply in the following way. The
government should supply every
university which has a physics or en
gineering department with instru
ments capable of producing the
proper evidence. These instruments
would likelv be a telescopic movie
camera with a time base recorder on
th film, and a theodolite (an instru
ment which registers the azimuth
and elevation of the camera on the
tilm while pictures are taken).
Magnetic field and ionization
monitors can be added. The equip
ment is regularly used by NASA and
the Air Force in flight test work and
should cost about $4000 only, per
university.
If the equipment is supplied to,
say, 200 universities across the na
tion, we can have a reasonable
coverage of the country. Each time a
rash of UFO sightings is reported,
researchers (mostly students, I sup
pose) should rush to the scene and
try to register the evidence. The total
cost would be around $800,000,
which is small change compared to
any agency budget (NASA, Air Force,
NSF, etc.)
Or, maybe the Air Force already
knows a loi more about UFO's than it
is willing to admits
(Mnshc Aelion, a foreign graduate
student in physics, is a Daily colum
nist.)
