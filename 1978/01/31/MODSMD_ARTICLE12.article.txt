# Safety guidelines discussed
## DNA panel views local research 
### David Lampe 
The Administrative Recom
binant DNA Panel held a public
meeting last Friday in the
Meyer Library Forum Room to
discuss whether recombinant
DNA research proposed here
conforms to the safety
guidelines established by the
National Institutes of Health.
Of the nine projects cur
rently up for review, special at
tention was given to the five
proposed by Paul Berg, profes
sor of biochemistry and one of
the 16 panel members.
Recombinant DNA research
deals with the manipulation of
the molecule responsible for
the transmission of genetic in
formation from generation to
generation.
A segment of the DNA
molecule of one organism can
be isolated and spliced into the
DNA of a different one, result
ing in an entirely new organism
with characteristics of both.
Berg is interested in modify
ing the DNA of SV4O, a primate
virus, so it can be used safely in
recombinant experiments.
Tough survival
To date, most of the work

has involved E. coli K 12, a
common strain of bacteria
which has been modified so
that it would have difficulty
surviving outside of artificial
laboratory conditions.
The NIH guidelines provide
an extensive set of rules con
cerning what levels of biologi
cal and physical containment
are necessary for different
types of experiments.
"Ultimately we want to in
troduce animal DNA and study
its expression in this (SV4O)
host," Berg said. This recom
bining of animal DNA is the
next step in understanding the
application of recombinant
DNA techniques to higher
forms of life, he said.
The panel was established in
November 1976, as required by
the guidelines, to advise the
University on policies concern
ing this research. The 16 mem
bers were drawn from
throughout the University and
the community "to provide a
diversity of disciplines relevant
to recombinant DNA technol
ogy, biological safety and en
gineering."
The panel includes members

from the ASSU and the
economics, law and chemistry
departments as well as from
the biology and biochemistry
departments In addition,
SLAC Prof. Burton Richter and
Lockheed engineer Richard
Rosenbloom, who represents
the public sector, serve on the
panel.
Meetings open
Although only every fourth
meeting is open to the public,
the guidelines require that the
minutes for all meetings be
made available for public in
spection.
According to )ack Sidlow,
manager of safety and health
and organizer of the meetings,
"the meetings are held as often
as necessary to conduct busi
ness, which depends on the
research in progress and the
number of new proposals —
usually once a month."
Berg was among the scien
tists who, in 1974, requested a
voluntary moratorium on po
tentially dangerous experi
ments.
The following February, an
international group of scien
tists met at the Asilomar Con

ference Center near Pacific
Grove to assess the dangers of
this new line of research. The
recommendations of this
group led directly to the crea
tion of the NIH guidelines.
Controversy raged
Controversy has raged ac
ross the country in the scien
tific community, among the
public and in the legislatures
concerning the regulation of
this research.
Opponents have fears of a
new and possibly uncontrolla
ble bacteria strain escaping
from a laboratory and causing a
widespread epidemic. Many
are concerned about the moral
implications of tampering with
the evolution of plants, ani
mals and man, or the political
implications of a government
or terrorist group in control of
genetics.
On the other hand, many see
bright promise for mankind in
the fruits of this research.
Plants may be genetically al
tered to eliminate the need for
artificial fertilizer, and heredit
ary diseases could be treated
by tinkering with the genes re
sponsible for their transmis
sion, researchers say.
Kennedy bill
Senator Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), author of a bill gen
erally regarded by the scientific
community as excessively re
strictive, met with researchers
at the Medical School last fall to
discuss the risks of DNA re
search.
Action on the bill has been
deferred as a result of new evi
dence from Clinical Phar :
macology Prof. Stanley Cohen
confirming the safety of these
experiments, and active lobby
ing by scientists concerned
about unprecedented restric
tions on the freedom of scien
tific inquiry.
Much of the public attention
on the matter seems to have
died down.
"At the first meeting last
November there was a lot of
concern by the public over this
type of research," said Sidlow.
"It was really just a forum
where the public could air their
views."
Fairchild Auditorium at the
Medical Center was filled to
capacity for the meeting.
Some 20 people showed up
at last Friday's meeting.
All of the proposed research
was judged by the panel to be
in agreement with the NIH
guidelines and was unanim
ously approved by the quorum
or 12.

generation.
A segment of the DNA
molecule of one organism can
be isolated and spliced into the
DNA of a different one, result
ing in an entirely new organism
with characteristics of both.
Berg is interested in modify
ing the DNA of SV4O, a primate
virus, so it can be used safely in
recombinant experiments.
Tough survival
To date, most of the work

has involved E. coli K 12, a
common strain of bacteria
which has been modified so
that it would have difficulty
surviving outside of artificial
laboratory conditions.
The NIH guidelines provide
an extensive set of rules con
cerning what levels of biologi
cal and physical containment
are necessary for different
types of experiments.
"Ultimately we want to in
troduce animal DNA and study
its expression in this (SV4O)
host," Berg said. This recom
bining of animal DNA is the
next step in understanding the
application of recombinant
DNA techniques to higher
forms of life, he said.
The panel was established in
November 1976, as required by
the guidelines, to advise the
University on policies concern
ing this research. The 16 mem
bers were drawn from
throughout the University and
the community "to provide a
diversity of disciplines relevant
to recombinant DNA technol
ogy, biological safety and en
gineering."
The panel includes members

from the ASSU and the
economics, law and chemistry
departments as well as from
the biology and biochemistry
departments In addition,
SLAC Prof. Burton Richter and
Lockheed engineer Richard
Rosenbloom, who represents
the public sector, serve on the
panel.
Meetings open
Although only every fourth
meeting is open to the public,
the guidelines require that the
minutes for all meetings be
made available for public in
spection.
According to )ack Sidlow,
manager of safety and health
and organizer of the meetings,
"the meetings are held as often
as necessary to conduct busi
ness, which depends on the
research in progress and the
number of new proposals —
usually once a month."
Berg was among the scien
tists who, in 1974, requested a
voluntary moratorium on po
tentially dangerous experi
ments.
The following February, an
international group of scien
tists met at the Asilomar Con

ference Center near Pacific
Grove to assess the dangers of
this new line of research. The
recommendations of this
group led directly to the crea
tion of the NIH guidelines.
Controversy raged
Controversy has raged ac
ross the country in the scien
tific community, among the
public and in the legislatures
concerning the regulation of
this research.
Opponents have fears of a
new and possibly uncontrolla
ble bacteria strain escaping
from a laboratory and causing a
widespread epidemic. Many
are concerned about the moral
implications of tampering with
the evolution of plants, ani
mals and man, or the political
implications of a government
or terrorist group in control of
genetics.
On the other hand, many see
bright promise for mankind in
the fruits of this research.
Plants may be genetically al
tered to eliminate the need for
artificial fertilizer, and heredit
ary diseases could be treated
by tinkering with the genes re
sponsible for their transmis
sion, researchers say.
Kennedy bill
Senator Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), author of a bill gen
erally regarded by the scientific
community as excessively re
strictive, met with researchers
at the Medical School last fall to
discuss the risks of DNA re
search.
Action on the bill has been
deferred as a result of new evi
dence from Clinical Phar :
macology Prof. Stanley Cohen
confirming the safety of these
experiments, and active lobby
ing by scientists concerned
about unprecedented restric
tions on the freedom of scien
tific inquiry.
Much of the public attention
on the matter seems to have
died down.
"At the first meeting last
November there was a lot of
concern by the public over this
type of research," said Sidlow.
"It was really just a forum
where the public could air their
views."
Fairchild Auditorium at the
Medical Center was filled to
capacity for the meeting.
Some 20 people showed up
at last Friday's meeting.
All of the proposed research
was judged by the panel to be
in agreement with the NIH
guidelines and was unanim
ously approved by the quorum
or 12.

an extensive set of rules con
cerning what levels of biologi
cal and physical containment
are necessary for different
types of experiments.
"Ultimately we want to in
troduce animal DNA and study
its expression in this (SV4O)
host," Berg said. This recom
bining of animal DNA is the
next step in understanding the
application of recombinant
DNA techniques to higher
forms of life, he said.
The panel was established in
November 1976, as required by
the guidelines, to advise the
University on policies concern
ing this research. The 16 mem
bers were drawn from
throughout the University and
the community "to provide a
diversity of disciplines relevant
to recombinant DNA technol
ogy, biological safety and en
gineering."
The panel includes members

from the ASSU and the
economics, law and chemistry
departments as well as from
the biology and biochemistry
departments In addition,
SLAC Prof. Burton Richter and
Lockheed engineer Richard
Rosenbloom, who represents
the public sector, serve on the
panel.
Meetings open
Although only every fourth
meeting is open to the public,
the guidelines require that the
minutes for all meetings be
made available for public in
spection.
According to )ack Sidlow,
manager of safety and health
and organizer of the meetings,
"the meetings are held as often
as necessary to conduct busi
ness, which depends on the
research in progress and the
number of new proposals —
usually once a month."
Berg was among the scien
tists who, in 1974, requested a
voluntary moratorium on po
tentially dangerous experi
ments.
The following February, an
international group of scien
tists met at the Asilomar Con

ference Center near Pacific
Grove to assess the dangers of
this new line of research. The
recommendations of this
group led directly to the crea
tion of the NIH guidelines.
Controversy raged
Controversy has raged ac
ross the country in the scien
tific community, among the
public and in the legislatures
concerning the regulation of
this research.
Opponents have fears of a
new and possibly uncontrolla
ble bacteria strain escaping
from a laboratory and causing a
widespread epidemic. Many
are concerned about the moral
implications of tampering with
the evolution of plants, ani
mals and man, or the political
implications of a government
or terrorist group in control of
genetics.
On the other hand, many see
bright promise for mankind in
the fruits of this research.
Plants may be genetically al
tered to eliminate the need for
artificial fertilizer, and heredit
ary diseases could be treated
by tinkering with the genes re
sponsible for their transmis
sion, researchers say.
Kennedy bill
Senator Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), author of a bill gen
erally regarded by the scientific
community as excessively re
strictive, met with researchers
at the Medical School last fall to
discuss the risks of DNA re
search.
Action on the bill has been
deferred as a result of new evi
dence from Clinical Phar :
macology Prof. Stanley Cohen
confirming the safety of these
experiments, and active lobby
ing by scientists concerned
about unprecedented restric
tions on the freedom of scien
tific inquiry.
Much of the public attention
on the matter seems to have
died down.
"At the first meeting last
November there was a lot of
concern by the public over this
type of research," said Sidlow.
"It was really just a forum
where the public could air their
views."
Fairchild Auditorium at the
Medical Center was filled to
capacity for the meeting.
Some 20 people showed up
at last Friday's meeting.
All of the proposed research
was judged by the panel to be
in agreement with the NIH
guidelines and was unanim
ously approved by the quorum
or 12.
