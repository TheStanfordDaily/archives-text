# Senator Gregorio: four more-and no more—years
## 
### Caryn Coulter 
After a 12-year climb to senior status
in the state Senate, taking your
nameplate off the office door in Sac
ramento wouldn't be easy. For Uni
versity alumnus Arlen Gregorio
(D-San Mateo), however, such a step
is a necessary one — not only politi
cally but personally as well.
As he seeks his third 4-year term in
the state Capitol, Cregorio assures his
constituents that he plans to take time
off after his next four years in the legis
lature. "I love this area," he said, "but
in the future, I'll either do something
very different or go into another area
... or another country!"
What's more, Gregorio, a 46-year
native of California's 10th senatorial
district, said he hopes his colleagues
will take kindly to the same sort of
re-evaluation of their own political
careers. In fact, he has recently prop
osed a constitutional amendment
which imposes a 12-year limit upon
the terms of all California legislators.
Re-evaluating his own political
career, Cregorio said he would even
tually like to return to working with
the people, rather than for them. He
said one of his future goals might be
personally founding a rehabilitation
community rather than simply allocat
ing funds for other founders.
Raised and educated in the mid
peninsula region, Gregorio's

perspective is largely a reflection of
his background here, although his
undergraduate lifestyle might have
seemed a bit unusual to the average
Stanford "pre-politician." For in
stance, he said he never had the time
to participate in politics as an under
graduate or as a law student because
he was too busy financing his educa
tion with part-time jobs, including
one in a mortuary and another as a fry
cook.
Meanwhile, he said a number of his
friends who did have the time to be
come "politicos" changed their
career objectives before leaving
school. "Of my friends who were in
volved in campus politics, very few
are now involved in the political pro
cess."
Today, however, Cregorio said he is
more concerned with the outlook of
college students and the rest of
American youth. "What I see resem
bles 'pabulum,' " he laments.
"Somehow people in this state want
to keep teenagers in a dependent
role. Young people don't have Ihe
opportunity to have the responsibility
early enough."
Possibly as an offshoot of the "great
cynicism since Watergate," he exp
lains, "there's a great tendency to sit
around and let people entertain you."
In his role as "entertainer" at the
state Capitol, Gregorio's proposals

number over 200, and reflect in part,
his concern for providing "a longer
leash' for dependent youths.
Another of his "legislative themes" is
the reduction of bureaucratic ineffec
tiveness in Sacramento.
He currently chairs the Committee
on Health and Welfare and sits with
committees on Education, Finance,
Governmental Organization as well as
the Senate- Select Committee on
Housing. Senate subcommittees
which he chairs include Alcoholism,
the Arts and Educational Reform.
The 12-day filing period during
which Gregorio's opponents must
announce their intentions to run in
the June primary began last Saturday.
The senator is still puzzled as to the
race ahead. "I've heard that the Re
publicans have been searching for a
candidate," he said, "but no one I
know of has agreed to run."
If and when someone does decide,
that person will be up against quite a
contestant. Despite Cregorio's soft
spoken and mild-mannered approach
to his legislative role, he has firmly
established himself as a proponent of
Gov. )erry Brown's brand of politics.
He said he admires the governor's
style: "He is a truly slick politician,
along with Roosevelt and Kennedy.
Styles change with time, but these
men's talent lies in their great ability
to manage people's perceptions.

Brown's going to be re-elected again
unless a political miracle occurs."
Among the bills highlighting Gre
gorio's efforts over the past eight
years is one which would amend the
state constitution to provide for a 99-
representative, one-house legisla
ture, aimed at localization of state
government and reduction of the cur
rent rivalry between houses.
The senator is an advocate of the
18-year-old minimum drinking age,
but has proposed a bill which would

counteract the dangers of drunk driv
ing by creating a legal maximum
blood alcohol level of .10 for drivers.
He has successfully proposed an in
centive system for participation in a
one-year program for treatment of al
cohol abuse, whereby persons with
two or more drunk-driving convic
tions may retain their drivers' licenses
if they agree to participate in Ihe prog
ram.
He has authored legislation favor
ing a prohibition of smoking in public
places and providing for state Medi-
Cal funds to finance abortions for wel
fare recipients.
Gregorio also authored a bill which
revised the state Departments of
Health and Benefit Payments and the
Office of Alcoholism into five sepa
rate departments: Developmental
Services, Mental Health, Social Ser
vices, Alcoholism and Drug Abuse
and Health Services.
With its proper implementation,
Cregorio said, in reference to the
reorganized agencies, "this massive
bureaucracy should become much
more accountable to the legislature
and the people."
The question remains, then,
whether the people will remain ac
countable to Gregorio as incumbent
in 1978. While things are looking good
for the senator from Stanford, his final
answer may have to wait until Nov. 7.
