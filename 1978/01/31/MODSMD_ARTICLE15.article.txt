# Pregnancy rises among teenagers
## 
### 
New York (AP) — A nation
wide report on adolescent sex
shows a one-third increase be
tween 1971 and 1976 in both
premarital sexual activity and
pregnancy among girls 15 to 19
years old.
However, the authors of the
report said that learning about
the dimensions of sexual be
havior among female teena
gers does not help to explain
that behavior.
"Far more study is required
before we can hope to explain
and understand the sexual and
reproductive behavior of
young Americans," they con
cluded.
The study, directed by
sociologists Melvin Zelnik and
John kantner of lohns Hopkins
University, was published yes
terday in Family Planning
Perspectives — the journal of
the Alan Cuttmacher Institute,
an affiliate of Planned Parent
hood.
The percentage of white girls
15 to 19 who had experienced
premarital intercourse rose

from 26. J in the 1971 group to
37.2 in the 1976 group, the re
port said. The percentage of
whites having a first pregnancy
rose from 6.4 to 9.3.
The 1976 study also re
ported:
—Eight out of 10 premarital
pregnancies among teenagers
who did not marry before the
outcome of the pregnancy
were unintended, about the
same as among the 1971 group,
lust one in seven of those in
terviewed used contraception.
—The proportion of first
pregnancies terminated by
abortion about doubled from
the 1971 group to the 1976
group.
—Adoption and foster
placement declined substan
tially from an already low level.
Among the sexually active
teens, out-of-wedlock
childbearing declined by more
than one-fifth between the two
survey periods. The principle
factor in this decline appeared
to be the wider availability of
abortion, the authors said.
