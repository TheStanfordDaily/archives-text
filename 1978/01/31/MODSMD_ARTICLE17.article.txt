# Senior Casino Night offers gambling, gamboling

### 
A spinning roulette wheel. Two crowded craps
tables. A very tall dean of admissions dealing
blackjack. Lots and lots of booze. Hundreds of
chips pushed at a dozen gamesmen hired in
from Lake Tahoe.
112 hat was the scene Friday at the Menlo Circus
Club in Atherton where the Stanford Alumni
Association held their first party for an outgoing
senior class. Billed as Senior Casino Night, there
was a atmosphere afoot rarely found outside the
frats: society.
Society was the theme of the weekend. With
both the Casino Night and the Toyon Viennese
Ball on the same night, one might have felt it was
graduation at Princeton or Winter Carnival at
Dartmouth. Formal wear was almost standard.
Some people shifted back and forth from the
Viennese Ball to Casino Night, and could be
distinguished 112 rom the rest of the crowd by their
formal dresses and flashy tuxedos.
Interest in Casino Night had run high. Tickets
for the event went on sale for $5.50 per couple
near the beginning of the quarter and were all
sold by noon last Wednesday. Some 500 tickets
were sold, and many seniors trecked to the
Alumni Association Thursday and Friday in an
attempt to get in after all the billets were gone.
Its hard to get the flavor of a party without
knowing who was there. Fred Hargadon was.
Herant Katchadourian, dean of Undergraduate

Studies, was too. So were Greg Larson and Steve
Westly from the ASSU Council of Presidents.
George Montgomery was there. So were
Simone Cox, Bonnie McColl and Brad krevoy.
It was also significant who was not there. Few,
it any, Stanford Organizing Committee ASSU
senators were there. Most people from The
Daily were not there.
fhe dance floor was extremely crowded and
effectively illuminated by light reflected off of a
spinning mirrored ball.
In addition to the plentiful supply of mixed
drinks there was a lavish assortment of tasty hors
d'oeuvres.
The Alumni Association set up the party "be
cause we have so little to do with the present
students," a spokesperson for the Association
said. In general the feeling was that some sort of
service to the present students might help build
support for the Association in the future.
"However good the administrators are at deal
ing with tuition figures, they're not very good at
dealing cards," remarked one student.
But the party was a success. The band was less
than stellar (taking long breaks between
marathon jam session songs) and the prizes
were given away all too fast, but the gambling,
gamboling and society should be re-

The band drew a lively crowd onto the dance floor, and later in the evening even persuaded a female
student to join the lead singer and tonga player on stage to perform the "alligator" dance.


Many students chose to gamble away their chips at the blackjack
tables, where professional dealers sent in from Lake Tahoe dealt the

cards. The blackjack fables were the most popular of the gambling
attractions.
