The Stanford Heritage Fund (SHF), a
volunteer fundraising organization,
gives students here "the < hance to get
more in tune with the University at
large, because instead of just fundrais
ing, they get closer to other aspects
and gain new outlooks," said Scott
O'Connor, co-chairman of SHF.
Formed as a senior class project in
1955, SHF raises money for scholar
ships to incoming freshmen and has
collected $375,000 over the past 12
years. Last year, $25,000 was distri
buted among 10 scholars.
"In determining the recipients of
the scholarships, the primary criteria
are demonstrated financial need and
potential tor leadership in political
fields," according to O'Connor.
Many students here do not realize
that "the tuition we pay as students
covers less than half of the cost at
tributal to our education," said
O'Connor.
"Despite the high costs involved
with attending Stanford, unawareness
of the financial facts of life is prevalent
on campus," he said.
SHF is a unique scholarship organi
zation as all money is collected by stu
dents. Why would a group of finan
cially secure students be concerned
about the education of others?
O'Connor thinks such motivation var
ies with the individual.
"There is a great deal of satisfaction
that comes from helping other stu
dents. The contacts made with the
business world through this project
are great and there is always the
thought that an activity such as this

one will look good on a resume,"
O'Connor said with a wry grin.
From the standpoint of the indi
vidual, the experience gained in deal
ing on the corporation level is an
added motivation.
"I think many times the people who
volunteer as undergrads to aid the
school go on to become contributers
in the future as they realize the need
for financial support," added O'Con
nor.
The Heritage Fund gathers its sup
port from businesses in the Bay Area
and Los Angeles Transamerica,
based in San Franc is< o. and the Alpine
Beer Garden i/ot s) in Palo Alto are
among the moit* tamiliar donors
According to O'Connor, the SHF
members have an advantage in dealing
with the corporations because they
are students.
"Many times the people who you
are talking to are genuinely interested
in your impressions of Stanford as well
as your own goals. I think they have a
sense of responsibility for the com
munity they serve and regard private
higher education as something worth
preserving," O'Connor explained.
From a financial standpoint, it is
gratifying for the companies to donate
money to the fund because there is no
overhead â€” 100 per cent of the dona
tion goes directly to the students.
"Never has there been an unfriendly
contact. Even if the business in ques
tion is not prepared to contribute to
the organization, people are always
enthusiastic about Stanford and con
cerned with your personal ideas,"
commented O'Connor.

Before approaching a company, the
solicitors are given plenty of
background information. All calls are
based on the buddy system and each
pair, usually a male and temale, is as
signed three to six appointments.
Local soliciting occurs annually dur
ing winter quarter, beginning in late
February and March.
One of the more highly regarded
events is the spring trip to Los Angeles
during which the group contacts big
name companies in southern Califor
nia.
Although SFIF is separate from the
Administration Financial Aid Program,
it is highly supported by President
Richard Lyman.
"Stanford Heritage Fund is valuable
not only lor the actual dollars it brings,
but also for the good experience
gained by the students," commented
Lyman.
"It is the one organized effort to in
volve students in Stanford tundraising;"
he added.
The fund is now preparing for its
thirteenth season. Last year 40 stu
dents participated, but the group is
hoping to expand some this year. Op
portunities are open to ail under
graduates, however freshmen are not
encouraged because an important fac
tor in the interview is the student's
experiences at Stantord and personal
direction
The first organizational meeting will
be held tonight at 7:30 in Law School,
room 180. Anyone interested in be
coming a part of SHF can obtain
further information from Shirley Pep
pers in room 302, Encina Hall.
