Strange characters stalked
Lily Tomlin's one-person Ges
talt comedy session at The
Palace of Fine Arts. There's
Glenna for example — child
of the '60s, erstwhile I Love
Lucy Groupie and consumer of
dangerous drugs.
There's also the immortal
Bobbie Jean, known wide and
far for her "dynamic rendition
of 'Flight of the Bumble Bee,'
using foot pedals only." And
Crystal, the world's only parap
legic hang glider pilot, and the
Boogie Woman, a certified dis
simulator of the only true
boogie. Like Glenna, they all
appear and reappear at unpre
dictable intervals — like Lily
they appear to be living, brea
thing beings.
Very strange
It's all very strange. Lily Tom
lin's Palace show was magnifi
cent, to be sure, but it also was
very strange. It was not what you
expect comedy to be, and it took
some getting used to.
I should stick in a few stan
dard disclaimers at this point.
Everybody knows that every
comedian worth his or her
plumes is at root a serious per
son — they know just as well
that anyone that claims to have
discovered a unique ironic un
dercurrent in a favorite com
edy act deserves to be drawn
and quartered, or ignored. All
comedians have a flip side, and
the fastest way to ruin the ef
fectiveness of an act is to pay
undo attention to the misery

inherent in every element
thereof.
Very good
Vou should keep this stuff in
mind, because I intend to ig
nore it. As far as I'm concerned
Lily Tomlin ain't the same.
She's an actress, is what she is,
and that's the talent that distin
guishes her from everybody
else in the business. She's
obscenely funny, but she's also
a genuine dramatic dynamo.
If I may be permitted to beat
a metaphor senseless, it seems
only fitting to re-insist that Li
ly's performances are more
therapy than anything else.
She purposefully makes us
aware of the connection bet
ween herself and the selves of
her characters and, frequently,
ends sketches on a dead seri
ous note — the effect inspires a
feeling that they were trying to
tell us something. She gets you
thinking about the purpose of
her comedy, and she makes
you uneasy when you laugh at
the woman in the CB-equipped
wheelchair. It's not the
Ready-Whipped pathos that
people like Jackie Gleason
used to do, either — the feel
ings that Lily exposed were
complex and often painful.
Glenna's father dies, and there
is a long and sobering scene
centered on a long and sober
ing night at a singles bar. It is
not what you expect, and it
makes you nervous.
Yet Lily Tomlin is capable of
taking a caricature to hell and

back again. Her finest mo
ments came when she success
fully changed emotional direc
tions in midstream; when she
turned on the audience after
making them nervous, and
took a veritable jackhammer to
its collective funny-bone. The
Boogie Woman, who came on
last, had everybody roaring
and standing, and stomping
(and beaming). That night they
brought Lily back onstage six
or seven times, and she re
sponded by beaming back and
doing handstands. People
were going nuts at the end of
that show — it was the best
arranged finish I think I've ever
seen.
And the Boogie Woman was
only the last of several such in
spirations. After unfamiliar
moments early on, she would
shatter us with a ritualistic de
livery of unrelated one-liners
("I'm worried that the person
who thought up Muzak is
thinking up something else,"
or "Did you ever wonder
whether drugs are making us
more creative than we really
are?"); often, a single charac
ter suddenly became unbeara
bly funny.
Very funny
We sat and watched Glenna
become more and more de
pressed, and we feel thought
ful and quiet, then she goes
and calls her friend and exp
lains that nothing has been
right since she found from the
cover of Abbey Road that Paul

was dead. People were in the
aisles watching Glenna's drugs
take effect, when seconds be
fore they felt her in an entirely
different situation. I don t
think anybody but Lily could
bring that kind of thing off —
certainly nobody but she could
get away with something as
strange as a raving idealist
crippled for life.
Lily Tomlin deserves multi
ple hosannas for the way she
has marketed her product.
Since her Laugh-In days (what
she does now is decidedly dif
ferent), she has consistently
managed to resist the tempta
tion to produce other than the
highest quality stuff. She was
on Broadway for a million years
or so, and she was in a couple
of run-of-the-mill Academy
Award sweeping greatest
movie events of all time and,
most importantly, she has
done relatively little television.
A pearl
That last phrase is the opera
tive one, I think — the fact that
Lily Tomlin is rarely seen in the
vicinity of The Cong Show (or
in the vicinty of Saturday Night
Live, for that matter) — but
don't get me wrong, has kept
her from becoming a truly big
star.
This is good, and not only
because it keeps Lily in reach of
her life's ambition, which she
says is to be a waitress in How
ard Johnson's. It meant that
her audience was composed
primarily of non-Gong Show

variety human beings (Cong
show crowds seem to be the
inevitable tate of famous com
edy people).
It just might be that Lily Tom
lin's Palace of 112 ine Arts show
featured one of the finest com
edians extant at the height of
her creative glory. "Let me
hear you get boogie" is not a
household phrase, and as such
it shows no signs of rotting —
she's got room to manuever
and a mind that insures that
she'll find the right place to go.
And goddamn, but she's
funny.
