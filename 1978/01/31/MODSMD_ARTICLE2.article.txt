The defeat of Indira Gandhi last
March and the subsequent rebirth of
democracy in India show that "free
dom and democracy are not merely
for the elite and affluent. A poor na
tion can be as committed to democ
racy as the richest under the sun,"
according to Indian Ambassador to
the United States Nani Pafkhivala.
Palkhivala addressed an audience
of nearly 100 persons Monday after
noon in the Meyer Forum Room.
The issue of freedom is "of great
relevance to a developing country
like ours," Palkhivala said. While the
process of development may be
longer and more arduous under a
democracy, "the other system does
such damage to the human spirit I
cannot imagine adopting it," Pal
khivala stated.
The results of the March elections
which swept Morarji Desai and the
lanata party into power de
monstrated that India's voters "may
be illiterate, but they are not ignor
ant," he said.
The defeat of Indira Gandhi was
also the first electoral defeat for the
Congress party, founded when India
was part of the British empire. Ac
cording to the ambassador, Desai's
election was a victory for constitu
tional supremacy and human rights
in India.
The present government is restor
ing the constitutional balance of

power that was destroyed during the
emergency period, he maintained.
Parliament will soon receive a mea
sure to repeal laws of the Gandhi
period which made parliamentary
law supreme.
The recent visit of President Jimmy
Carter to India underscores India's
return to a "genuine" policy of
nonalignment. Referring to Gandhi's
close friendship with the Soviet Un
ion, Palkhivala said her foreign policy
tilted "no more than the Leaning
Tower of Pisa," in spite of her claims
of nonalignment.
Correction of this tilt has brought
the United States and India closer to
gether, he stated. "We now consider
the United States as much of a friend
as Russia. We treat both with equal
warmth and friendship."
Carter's visit was a "seal of friend
ship between the two largest democ
racies in the world." The heart of
friendship between the two coun
tries is in the mutual belief that
"moral values of the two peoples will
govern and regulate state policies,"
Palkhivala said.
Promises of cooperation in nuclear
research, agricultural technology
and foreign aid are important, but
"friendship is not to be measured in
terms of material benefits," he said.
"It is something which transcends
this and is characterized by an
abstract sympathy and affinity bet
ween the two countries. This was

cemented by Jimmy Carter."
Palkhivala was appointed by the
Desai government as ambassador
just over three months ago. He was a
senior advocate of the Indian Sup
reme Court and served as a member
of the first and second law commis
sions.
He was engaged as Gandhi's attor- y
ney to argue before the Supreme
Court, but withdrew from the case
when Gandhi declared a state of
emergency in the spring of 1975.

Correction of this tilt has brought
the United States and India closer to
gether, he stated. "We now consider
the United States as much of a friend
as Russia. We treat both with equal
warmth and friendship."
Carter's visit was a "seal of friend
ship between the two largest democ
racies in the world." The heart of
friendship between the two coun
tries is in the mutual belief that
"moral values of the two peoples will
govern and regulate state policies,"
Palkhivala said.
Promises of cooperation in nuclear
research, agricultural technology
and foreign aid are important, but
"friendship is not to be measured in
terms of material benefits," he said.
"It is something which transcends
this and is characterized by an
abstract sympathy and affinity bet
ween the two countries. This was

cemented by Jimmy Carter."
Palkhivala was appointed by the
Desai government as ambassador
just over three months ago. He was a
senior advocate of the Indian Sup
reme Court and served as a member
of the first and second law commis
sions.
He was engaged as Gandhi's attor- y
ney to argue before the Supreme
Court, but withdrew from the case
when Gandhi declared a state of
emergency in the spring of 1975.
The defeat of Indira Gandhi last
March and the subsequent rebirth of
democracy in India show that "free
dom and democracy are not merely
for the elite and affluent. A poor na
tion can be as committed to democ
racy as the richest under the sun,"
according to Indian Ambassador to
the United States Nani Pafkhivala.
Palkhivala addressed an audience
of nearly 100 persons Monday after
noon in the Meyer Forum Room.
The issue of freedom is "of great
relevance to a developing country
like ours," Palkhivala said. While the
process of development may be
longer and more arduous under a
democracy, "the other system does
such damage to the human spirit I
cannot imagine adopting it," Pal
khivala stated.
The results of the March elections
which swept Morarji Desai and the
lanata party into power de
monstrated that India's voters "may
be illiterate, but they are not ignor
ant," he said.
The defeat of Indira Gandhi was
also the first electoral defeat for the
Congress party, founded when India
was part of the British empire. Ac
cording to the ambassador, Desai's
election was a victory for constitu
tional supremacy and human rights
in India.
The present government is restor
ing the constitutional balance of

power that was destroyed during the
emergency period, he maintained.
Parliament will soon receive a mea
sure to repeal laws of the Gandhi
period which made parliamentary
law supreme.
The recent visit of President Jimmy
Carter to India underscores India's
return to a "genuine" policy of
nonalignment. Referring to Gandhi's
close friendship with the Soviet Un
ion, Palkhivala said her foreign policy
tilted "no more than the Leaning
Tower of Pisa," in spite of her claims
of nonalignment.
