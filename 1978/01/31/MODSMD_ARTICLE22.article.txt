## New Parker releases out 
### 
For those who have carefully
listened to his music there can
be little doubt that Charlie
Parker is the greatest
saxophonist jazz has pro
duced. Even so Parker's musi
cal genius is often obscured by
the fascinating, and often
puzzling, circumstances of his
life.
It is almost too tempting to
talk about Charlie Parker the
man instead of Charlie Parker
the musician. He was a man of
fierce appetites: he would eat
20 hamburgers at one sitting;
he could drink eight Manhat
tan cockails in a half-hour and
feel no adverse effects; he
would frequently go to bed
with two women at once. One
could go on forever — the
number of Parker anecdotes
far exceeds the number of re
cordings he made in his sadly
brief life.
Whether one likes it or not
Charlie Parker's life has be
come inextricably intertwined
with his musical output. It is
hard not to hear Charlie Parker
talking about himself in the
hard and biting lines he would
create on his alto-saxophone.
In the past year Parker's
music has had somewhat of a
revival. Savoy has re-released
his recordings with them; Col
umbia has released previously
unavailable live performances;
in addition several very
scratchy "basement" record
ings have just come to life. This
kind of popularity is impressive
for an artist who has been dead
for over 20 years; yet it is dif
ficult to imagine Charlie Parker
remaining obscure for long.
His music has a power and
sculpted beauty which, for me,
is unmatched in the rest of
twentieth century music.
The most recent release of
Parker material has been by
Verve, which has just made av

ailable the third and final vol
ume of Parker's recordings on
that label. The record is very
interesting; it chronicles an at
tempt by Norman Cranz
(Parker's producer) to make
Parker's music accessible to a
wider public. The album fea
tures Parker playing with string
orchestras, big bands, vocal
groups, latin groups and the
like. But even when the sup
porting musicians may be un
impressive, Parker is always
fantastic.
Of the big band numbers
Parker's playing of "Night and
Day" is one of the best. The
numbers played by Parker with
arrangements by Gil Evan's
also have some stunning mo
ments. It one could just some
how remove the annoying
vocal group on the Evan's
numbers, their quality would
be intintely improved.
Fortunately there are among
these recordings, which were
incidentally the last which
Parker recorded in his life, sev
eral excellent small group ses

sions. These present Parker in
a more natural and more fruit
ful setting, and he has with him
some of the best musicians of
the time (Max Roach, Walter
Bishop, and Percy Heath
among others). These record
ings show that Parker had be
come, in the mid-fifties, less
driven; at times his music takes
on the more placid aspect one
associates with Lester Young.
One can only speculate
whether this change was con
sciously achieved by Parker, or
was, rather, the result of his
rapidly deteriorating physical
health. For the closing years of
his life show that Parker's con
stant use of heroin, alcohol, as
well as his other appetites, had
taken their toll. At his death at
age 35 the doctor in attendance
estimated his age at 50 years.
These late Verve recordings
are also remarkable for the
music which Parker uses. For
most of his life Parker would
play only bop and jazz stan
dards; a typical Parker con
cert or club date would consist

of almost all Parker originals. In
these recordings Parker uses
more popular songs; the
album features songs by Cole
Porter and George Gershwin
among others. For this reason
C.ranz's attempt at "populariz
ing" Parker had some benefi
cial effects. It torced Parker
to delve into material which he
would have otherwise ignored
and, thus, gives present day lis
teners a better idea of his con
siderable musical talents.
Now that almost all of
Parker's major recordings are
available (with the exception ot
his fantastic recordings for Dial
Records), it will be interesting
to see what effect this has on
the contemporary jazz scene.
Several critics have already
noted a tendency back towards
be-bop. If this is the case, these
re-issues of Parker's work will
certainly be influential. The
ironic aspect of this is that the
most important records in jazz
for the late '70s may very well
have been recorded 25 years in
the past.
