## '12th Night' to open in PA 
### 
In a unique collaboration of
the visual and performing arts,
the peninsula's Theatre Works
company will open Shakes
peare's romantic comedy
Twelfth Night Feb. 12 at 8:30
p.m. in the Palo Alto Cultural
Center's Main Gallery.
Two arts organizations have
joined for a cooperative mid
winter t elebration, as the Cul
tural Center Gallery's exhibi
tion by day becomes a fantasti
cal Shakespearean world by
night, the setting for one of the
Bard's most charming com
edies.
Twelfth Night is the third
production of Theatre Works'
Winter Festival '78. Repeat per
formances are scheduled Feb.
U>, 17. IH, 23. 24. 25, March 3,4,
10. 11, 17, 18 24, 25, 31 and
April I.
I he exhibition itself is a con
ceptual environment created

by local artist Pamel McCor
mick. It debuts Feb. 14 and will
be open to the public through
April 1.
Shakespeare's masterful
Twelfth Night weaves a fabric
of fantasy from his familiar
themes of love lost and won,
self-deception and self
knowledge, all sparkling with
the outrageous pranks and re
velries of a band of festive fools
and jaded jesters.
The itinerant fools of the
medieval courts, jesters have
provided the inspiration for
Theatre Works new produc
tion, according to Artistic Di
rector Robert Kelley. "Our in
terpretation will be informal,"
Kelley said. "In the tradition of
jesters our small troupe will
bring Shakespeare's poetry,
songs and foolery directly to
the audience, sometimes per
forming in their midst."

As Feste the Jester, Teirrah
McNair leads the cast as a mys
terious mistress of revels. To
her falls the task of sorting out
a quartet of mismatched lov
ers, bamboozling a lovelorn
duke and a forlorn duchess
(Tom Woosnam and Molly
Mayock) into the waiting arms
of lookslike lovers Viola and
Sebastian (Michelle Casey and
Mark Kemp).
Love triumphs despite the
efforts of Malvolio (Burton
Suchoff and Ralph Berger
share the role), whose purtian
ical posings are thwarted by
the ooisterous Sir Toby Belch
(Steven Young and Douglas
Markkannon) and his
jestmates Maria (Nancy Jones)
and Sir Andrew Aquecheek, a
flaxen-haired fool played by di
rector Robert Kelley. W. Truett
Roberts completes the cast as
the rakish pirate Antonio.

In a unique collaboration of
the visual and performing arts,
the peninsula's Theatre Works
company will open Shakes
peare's romantic comedy
Twelfth Night Feb. 12 at 8:30
p.m. in the Palo Alto Cultural
Center's Main Gallery.
Two arts organizations have
joined for a cooperative mid
winter t elebration, as the Cul
tural Center Gallery's exhibi
tion by day becomes a fantasti
cal Shakespearean world by
night, the setting for one of the
Bard's most charming com
edies.
Twelfth Night is the third
production of Theatre Works'
Winter Festival '78. Repeat per
formances are scheduled Feb.
U>, 17. IH, 23. 24. 25, March 3,4,
10. 11, 17, 18 24, 25, 31 and
April I.
I he exhibition itself is a con
ceptual environment created

by local artist Pamel McCor
mick. It debuts Feb. 14 and will
be open to the public through
April 1.
Shakespeare's masterful
Twelfth Night weaves a fabric
of fantasy from his familiar
themes of love lost and won,
self-deception and self
knowledge, all sparkling with
the outrageous pranks and re
velries of a band of festive fools
and jaded jesters.
The itinerant fools of the
medieval courts, jesters have
provided the inspiration for
Theatre Works new produc
tion, according to Artistic Di
rector Robert Kelley. "Our in
terpretation will be informal,"
Kelley said. "In the tradition of
jesters our small troupe will
bring Shakespeare's poetry,
songs and foolery directly to
the audience, sometimes per
forming in their midst."

As Feste the Jester, Teirrah
McNair leads the cast as a mys
terious mistress of revels. To
her falls the task of sorting out
a quartet of mismatched lov
ers, bamboozling a lovelorn
duke and a forlorn duchess
(Tom Woosnam and Molly
Mayock) into the waiting arms
of lookslike lovers Viola and
Sebastian (Michelle Casey and
Mark Kemp).
Love triumphs despite the
efforts of Malvolio (Burton
Suchoff and Ralph Berger
share the role), whose purtian
ical posings are thwarted by
the ooisterous Sir Toby Belch
(Steven Young and Douglas
Markkannon) and his
jestmates Maria (Nancy Jones)
and Sir Andrew Aquecheek, a
flaxen-haired fool played by di
rector Robert Kelley. W. Truett
Roberts completes the cast as
the rakish pirate Antonio.
