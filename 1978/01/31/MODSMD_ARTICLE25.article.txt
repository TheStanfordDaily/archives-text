## Spanish piece fails 
### 
A remarkable production of
that seldom-seen play "Life is a
Dream," written by Pedro
Calderon de la Barca, is cur
rently running in the Zeller
bach Playhouse at UC-Ber
keley thanks to their University
Theatre Workshop.
Although it is perhaps the
most famous Spanish dramatic
piece of the Medieval period,
this play is not often per
formed. Two of the main
reasons for said ostracization
are the difficult staging re
quirements (due to the some
what over-long speeches) and
the unfamiliarity of contem
porary audiences with the old
system of Honor in Spain. The
director, Anthony Taccone,
has attempted to rectify these
flaws by altering the script and
inserting extra reactions, ges
tures, and movements to the
stage directions.
By slicing the longer
dialogues and adding more de
tailed explanations of the
characters' thoughts, Taccone
has succeeded in making the
production clearly under
standable to any audience. At
the same time, however, the
original points of Calderon

have been lost.
The play relates the climactic
point in the life of Segis
mundo, the Prince of Poland,
whose father had at his birth
imprisoned him in order that
the country might be spared
the revolution the stars pre
dicted he would cause. The
theme of the play is that when
man tries to evade his destiny
by questionable methods he
cannot. This is repeated often
in the performance through
the use of parallels. There is
also a subplot concerning the
priorities and consanguinities
of Honor.
Technically the highpoints of
the play coexist with the poor
ones. The impressive fade-out
of a single spotlight on the face
of a character before each of
the intermissions contrasts
with bothersome and inconsis
tent music. The excellence of
the makeup is lost in the
multitude of sins of the cos
tumes; namely, nonperiod,
non Poland, Hamlet-stylized
noble dress. There are pan
niers (hip extensions) and
low-cut necklines; Rosaura
nearly bounces out of hers
several times. There is also a

lack of creases and signs of
normal wear. Segismundo's
rags are obviously just ill-cut
rather than dirty castoffs.
The contrasts in this play do
nor rebound to its favor. The
smooth tiean scene changes
are lost in Disney-like sets, and
the choreographed fights are
overcome by the poorly timed
movements elsewhere. Segis
mundo's first entrance directly
out at the audience is poten
tially strong, but practically
poor. Also, the clash of acting
styles completely subjugates
the few good performances;
that of David Kahn as Clotaldo
the jailer, Erin Lanagan as Es
tre 11 a Segismundo's cousin,
and Robin Schild as Astolpho,
Fstrella s cousin The best
charactei izatiun is by Steve
LeCrand as Clarin the clown
whose part now resembles the
Scapino figure in the old Com
edia del Arte fashion and
nearly turns the play from
melodrama to farce.
In the final analysis, this pro
duction is enjoyable to all who
treasure Bugs Bunny car
toons, but needs work in order
that it might return to real
drama.
