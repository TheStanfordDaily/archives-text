## Bloch unmistakably Russian 
### 
With so many young pianists
coming onto the concert stage
today, boasting of pheno
menal technique and diverse
repertoire, I was amazed to find
a bit of "freshness" in Boris
Bloch, both in character and in
his piano playing. Bloch, a shy,
tall, dark-haired Russian
pianist, who left the Soviet
Union in 1975 impressed me
with his devotion to music and
his elan for playing. Perform
ing informally at Lathrop Hall
on Thursday, he seemed at
home sharing music with en
thusiastic Stanford students.
With a list of impressive cre
dentials, including a silver
medal in the Arthur Rubinstein
Piano Competition in 1977 and
First Prize in the Piccola Scala in
Milan, Bloch has the begin
nings of a budding career.
Beginningpianoat theageof
six, Bloch continued his musi
cal education in the U.S.S.R.
until graduation from the
Tchaikovsky Conservatory in
Moscow. While speaking with
him, I could not help but
notice his Russian
background; his fondness for

Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev,
his innate sense of
nationalism, even his slight
Russian accent. All in all he
seemed to live and breathe
music; as he put it, "playing is
not a profession, it is my life."
Playing the piano in Bloch's
opinion has a duel effect: it
brings him pleasure as well as it
brings his audiences satisfac
tion. Assuming an overwhelm
ingly positive attitude about
music, he feels the need for
each individual to integrate the
"beauty of the great compos
ers' music" into their lives.
With an appreciation of all
types of music Bach to Broad
way, Bloch believes people
should be more open-minded
about listening to new, diffe
rent types of music. In his
words, "Music opens the soul
and goes hand in hand with
love."
Clearly, Bloch embodies a
great deal ot enthusiasm to
ward his profession as a con
cert pianist.
As a product ot many piano
competitions, Bloch still has

many reservations about the
subjectivity of judging young
pianists; the role of
nationalism, the partiality of
judges to a charismatic per
former, and the inherent
commercialism stemming
from publicity. Using piano
competitions to break into his
career, Bloch confesses it is the
"only way for a pianist to be
come known." To date, he pre
fers to play on a modern Stein
way for reasons of clarity and
brilliance of sound. He enjoys
playing most when he is prac

ticing alone (as he puts it,"the
time of creation and
craftsmanship for the pianist")
as well as for small groups of
musical friends.
Young, talented, and en
thusiastic ovei his career,
Bloch has quite a future as a
pianist. One can only hope he
will return soon to the Stanford
campus to play again He like
many other young artists of
today may someday end up as a
very famous concert pianist.
Time will tell.
