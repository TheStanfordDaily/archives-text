## 'Volpone' funny 
### 
Hilarity at its finest is an ap
propriate phrase to describe
the current production of Ben
Jonson's farce "Volpone" by
the Palo Alto Players at the
Community Center Theatre.
Any show which receives a
round of applause after each
and every scene is obviously
fantastic.
Thedirector, David Motroni,
is to be congratulated for his
use of Morris Carnovsky's
modernized interpretation of
this classic play in a Commedia
dell Arte style. This style of pre
sentation, which was common
in 15th century fcurope, in
volves the use of stock charac
ters with individual shticks
bright costumes ot the period
clever dialogue, minimum
sets, and a livelv pace.
The play deals with an av
aricious Levantine merchant,
Volpone, who desires gold for
its own sake and the power of
its possession. His servant
Mosca, yearns for his freedom.
The two entice Volpone's
greedy and gullible friends to
bring gifts to a supposedly
dying Volpone in hopes be
coming his heir.
Performers excel
All the performers excel in
the way they play off each other
and keep the audience in
terested throughout the entire
performance. Especially
superb is Douglas Gruehl in
the role of the creative, pas

sionate, witty servant Mosca,
who dances across the stage
with ease.
One of the funniest charac
ters was William Swift as Cor
bacci the userer, who gleefully
swipes Volpone's money chest
checking its fullness and then
swiping Volpone himself. )ohn
Mercer played the captain of
the local police, who attempts
to display his prowess with his
sword and fails in the great trad
ition of the Capitane Glorioso
stock character. Mercer also de
lighted the audience.
C>oo<l support
Enhan< mg lirst-classsupport
from the < >ther < asÂ» members is
Leon Foibes as Volpone,
Marinn.i DeVv'itf as Cloumba, a
dumb-blonde stereotype, and
John Ciammona as the sea
captain with a hoarse voice
who recalls his condition (sup
posedly drunk) only near the
end of the play. Although her
breasts are nearly the most
comic props in the play, the
repetitious gestures and facial
expressions of Linda Morrissey
as Canina the prostitute be
come tiresome.
The technical details are all
generally good and continue
the Commedia style.
(The play continues through
Feb. 11 on Friday and Satur
day at (i: iO p.m., with a special
afternoon matinee on Sunday,
Feb. 5 at 2: iO p.m. in the Palo
Alto Community Theatre.)
