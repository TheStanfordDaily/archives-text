# New woman astronaut gets instant fame

On the office walls: a Star Wars
poster, a chart depicting every star
visible from Earth and a button:
Darth Vadar Lives.
On the desk top: a rat's nest of
paoers, printouts, the Annual Review
of Astronomy and Astrophysics, a
vase holding a single red rose and an
unopened bottle of champagne.
On the book shelf: a jar of Tang.
Behind the desk, leaning back in a
chair, clad in jeans and a wool plaid
shirt, chatting with her mother on
the phone, is one of America's
newest astronauts, Sally Ride.
She's been getting calls all after
noon, from reporters, old college
friends, NASA officials and "even
people I didn't know I knew."
She hangs up the phone and
points to an unobtrusive figure in the
corner holding a camera. "He's been
following me around for two days —
he's just part of the furniture."
"Things haven't been too bad to
day, though. Yesterday was a
madhouse."
That day, she — and the press —
heard that the 26-year-old physics
graduate student had been named as
a mission specialist astronaut to fly
aboard the Space Shuttle.
Ride heard from NASA at 8 a.m. "I
was asleep until halfway through the
call. I woke up in a hurry."
Two hours later the rest of the
world heard the news, and, Ride re
calls, "I started getting phone calls
fast and furious."
She faced a barrage of cameras,
lights and microphones at a 2 p.m.
press conference, answering a lot of
questions like, "Aren't you afraid of

being in orbit with all those men?"
and "What's the highest you've ever
been before?"
Later, "there were four TV cameras
in here. They wanted me to go out
running. (Ride runs five miles a day.)
So I went out and ran."
Ride says she doesn't feel at all like
a superhero — that her new job was
almost a logical progression from her
first interest in astronomy.
"I was interested in science in
junior high and high school, But I
never owned a telescope. I never
made one. I read some books —
that's about all.
"I was definitely known in high
school for my scientific bent."
What were her parents' reactions
to the interest in science?
"My parents never pushed me;
they were really good about it. But I
just found out recently that my dad,
who's z orofessor of political science
at Monica College, doesn't
knowanythingaboutscience. Hegot
a D in high school chemistry, I think.
He doesn't know what happened to
me."
Ride was accepted at MIT, "but it
wasn't a very appealing place."
She spent two years at Swarthmore
College in Philadelphia, then trans
ferred to Stanford, where she com
pleted degrees in English and physics
in 1973.
"I didn't spend all my time in the
lab, but I did spend a lot of time in the
library. I was always kidded about my
interest in astrophysics — people
who didn't know what it was would
ask me if I was planning on becoming
an astronaut."
But it took four years and a mas

ter's degree before it occurred to her
to try.
"I've always followed the space
program closely. I could tell you
exactly where I was when |ohn Glenn
went into space and when Neil
Armstrong walked on the moon. But
I never thought about being an as
tronaut until I saw an article in the
Daily last year that mentioned NASA
was looking for women."
After NASA winnowed down the
original group of about 7000 would
be astronauts to a more manageable
group, the 200 remaining candidates
were invited to Houston last October
for interviews and physical tests.
"We flew down in groups of 20. All
the people I met were scientists, but
they certainly were a wide range
physically. Some guys were two in
ches shorter than I am — and I'm
5-foot-5. They weren't exactly your
typical image of an astronaut."
After returning from Houston,
Ride felt she had "about a 50-50
chance" of becoming an astronaut.
Then came the Monday morning
phone call.
"I just filed my post-doc job appli
cations Sunday."
Her new job means putting off a
career in astrophysics research by a
decade or so. But her immediate
concern is to complete her Ph.D.
work, interpreting data from X-ray
detectors in earth orbit.
"It was perfect timing. The training
program begins in July and I should
complete my Ph.D. in )une."
But Ride will visit Houston again
even earlier. "We have an orienta
tion program coming up. They
needed an excuse for a big party.

We'll also fill out a few forms."
Ride glances at her watch.
"And in a few minutes I'm flying
out for L.A. to go home."
A companion has walked into the
office to accompany Ride to the air
port. Suddenly the unobtrusive
piece of furniture (who, it turns out,
is a photographer for Time-Life)
stands up and says, "If you want a
private moment before you leave, let
me pick a good spot."
The phone starts ringing again.

"We flew down in groups of 20. All
the people I met were scientists, but
they certainly were a wide range
physically. Some guys were two in
ches shorter than I am — and I'm
5-foot-5. They weren't exactly your
typical image of an astronaut."
After returning from Houston,
Ride felt she had "about a 50-50
chance" of becoming an astronaut.
Then came the Monday morning
phone call.
"I just filed my post-doc job appli
cations Sunday."
Her new job means putting off a
career in astrophysics research by a
decade or so. But her immediate
concern is to complete her Ph.D.
work, interpreting data from X-ray
detectors in earth orbit.
"It was perfect timing. The training
program begins in July and I should
complete my Ph.D. in )une."
But Ride will visit Houston again
even earlier. "We have an orienta
tion program coming up. They
needed an excuse for a big party.

We'll also fill out a few forms."
Ride glances at her watch.
"And in a few minutes I'm flying
out for L.A. to go home."
A companion has walked into the
office to accompany Ride to the air
port. Suddenly the unobtrusive
piece of furniture (who, it turns out,
is a photographer for Time-Life)
stands up and says, "If you want a
private moment before you leave, let
me pick a good spot."
The phone starts ringing again.


Sally Ride, a physics graduate student from Stanford, has ~ AP Lf,s «"P' lo,o coune** ot Pam ano iimes
recently been named as a mission specialist astronaut to fly aboard the NASA Space Shuttle.
On the office walls: a Star Wars
poster, a chart depicting every star
visible from Earth and a button:
Darth Vadar Lives.
On the desk top: a rat's nest of
paoers, printouts, the Annual Review
of Astronomy and Astrophysics, a
vase holding a single red rose and an
unopened bottle of champagne.
On the book shelf: a jar of Tang.
Behind the desk, leaning back in a
chair, clad in jeans and a wool plaid
shirt, chatting with her mother on
the phone, is one of America's
newest astronauts, Sally Ride.
She's been getting calls all after
noon, from reporters, old college
friends, NASA officials and "even
people I didn't know I knew."
She hangs up the phone and
points to an unobtrusive figure in the
corner holding a camera. "He's been
following me around for two days —
he's just part of the furniture."
"Things haven't been too bad to
day, though. Yesterday was a
madhouse."
That day, she — and the press —
heard that the 26-year-old physics
graduate student had been named as
a mission specialist astronaut to fly
aboard the Space Shuttle.
Ride heard from NASA at 8 a.m. "I
was asleep until halfway through the
call. I woke up in a hurry."
Two hours later the rest of the
world heard the news, and, Ride re
calls, "I started getting phone calls
fast and furious."
She faced a barrage of cameras,
lights and microphones at a 2 p.m.
press conference, answering a lot of
questions like, "Aren't you afraid of

being in orbit with all those men?"
and "What's the highest you've ever
been before?"
Later, "there were four TV cameras
in here. They wanted me to go out
running. (Ride runs five miles a day.)
So I went out and ran."
Ride says she doesn't feel at all like
a superhero — that her new job was
almost a logical progression from her
first interest in astronomy.
"I was interested in science in
junior high and high school, But I
never owned a telescope. I never
made one. I read some books —
that's about all.
"I was definitely known in high
school for my scientific bent."
What were her parents' reactions
to the interest in science?
"My parents never pushed me;
they were really good about it. But I
just found out recently that my dad,
who's z orofessor of political science
at Monica College, doesn't
knowanythingaboutscience. Hegot
a D in high school chemistry, I think.
He doesn't know what happened to
me."
Ride was accepted at MIT, "but it
wasn't a very appealing place."
She spent two years at Swarthmore
College in Philadelphia, then trans
ferred to Stanford, where she com
pleted degrees in English and physics
in 1973.
"I didn't spend all my time in the
lab, but I did spend a lot of time in the
library. I was always kidded about my
interest in astrophysics — people
who didn't know what it was would
ask me if I was planning on becoming
an astronaut."
But it took four years and a mas

ter's degree before it occurred to her
to try.
"I've always followed the space
program closely. I could tell you
exactly where I was when |ohn Glenn
went into space and when Neil
Armstrong walked on the moon. But
I never thought about being an as
tronaut until I saw an article in the
Daily last year that mentioned NASA
was looking for women."
After NASA winnowed down the
original group of about 7000 would
be astronauts to a more manageable
group, the 200 remaining candidates
were invited to Houston last October
for interviews and physical tests.
"We flew down in groups of 20. All
the people I met were scientists, but
they certainly were a wide range

ches shorter than I am — and I'm

that's about all.
"I was definitely known in high
school for my scientific bent."
What were her parents' reactions
to the interest in science?
"My parents never pushed me;
they were really good about it. But I
just found out recently that my dad,
who's z orofessor of political science
at Monica College, doesn't
knowanythingaboutscience. Hegot
a D in high school chemistry, I think.
He doesn't know what happened to
me."
Ride was accepted at MIT, "but it
wasn't a very appealing place."
She spent two years at Swarthmore
College in Philadelphia, then trans
ferred to Stanford, where she com
pleted degrees in English and physics
in 1973.
"I didn't spend all my time in the
lab, but I did spend a lot of time in the
library. I was always kidded about my
interest in astrophysics — people
who didn't know what it was would
ask me if I was planning on becoming
an astronaut."
But it took four years and a mas

ter's degree before it occurred to her
to try.
"I've always followed the space
program closely. I could tell you
exactly where I was when |ohn Glenn
went into space and when Neil
Armstrong walked on the moon. But
I never thought about being an as
tronaut until I saw an article in the
Daily last year that mentioned NASA
was looking for women."
After NASA winnowed down the
original group of about 7000 would
be astronauts to a more manageable
group, the 200 remaining candidates
were invited to Houston last October
for interviews and physical tests.
"We flew down in groups of 20. All
the people I met were scientists, but
they certainly were a wide range
physically. Some guys were two in
ches shorter than I am — and I'm
5-foot-5. They weren't exactly your
typical image of an astronaut."
After returning from Houston,
Ride felt she had "about a 50-50
chance" of becoming an astronaut.
Then came the Monday morning
phone call.
"I just filed my post-doc job appli
cations Sunday."
Her new job means putting off a
career in astrophysics research by a
decade or so. But her immediate
concern is to complete her Ph.D.
work, interpreting data from X-ray
detectors in earth orbit.
"It was perfect timing. The training
program begins in July and I should
complete my Ph.D. in )une."
But Ride will visit Houston again
even earlier. "We have an orienta
tion program coming up. They
needed an excuse for a big party.

We'll also fill out a few forms."
Ride glances at her watch.
"And in a few minutes I'm flying
out for L.A. to go home."
A companion has walked into the
office to accompany Ride to the air
port. Suddenly the unobtrusive
piece of furniture (who, it turns out,
is a photographer for Time-Life)
stands up and says, "If you want a
private moment before you leave, let
me pick a good spot."
The phone starts ringing again.

recently been named as a mission specialist astronaut to fly aboard the NASA Space Shuttle.
On the office walls: a Star Wars
poster, a chart depicting every star
visible from Earth and a button:
Darth Vadar Lives.
On the desk top: a rat's nest of
paoers, printouts, the Annual Review
of Astronomy and Astrophysics, a
vase holding a single red rose and an
unopened bottle of champagne.
On the book shelf: a jar of Tang.
Behind the desk, leaning back in a
chair, clad in jeans and a wool plaid
shirt, chatting with her mother on
the phone, is one of America's
newest astronauts, Sally Ride.
She's been getting calls all after
noon, from reporters, old college
friends, NASA officials and "even
people I didn't know I knew."
She hangs up the phone and
points to an unobtrusive figure in the
corner holding a camera. "He's been
following me around for two days —
he's just part of the furniture."
"Things haven't been too bad to
day, though. Yesterday was a
madhouse."
That day, she — and the press —
heard that the 26-year-old physics
graduate student had been named as
a mission specialist astronaut to fly
aboard the Space Shuttle.
Ride heard from NASA at 8 a.m. "I
was asleep until halfway through the
call. I woke up in a hurry."
Two hours later the rest of the
world heard the news, and, Ride re
calls, "I started getting phone calls
fast and furious."
She faced a barrage of cameras,
lights and microphones at a 2 p.m.
press conference, answering a lot of
questions like, "Aren't you afraid of

being in orbit with all those men?"
and "What's the highest you've ever
been before?"
Later, "there were four TV cameras
in here. They wanted me to go out
running. (Ride runs five miles a day.)
So I went out and ran."
Ride says she doesn't feel at all like
a superhero — that her new job was
almost a logical progression from her
first interest in astronomy.
"I was interested in science in
junior high and high school, But I
never owned a telescope. I never
made one. I read some books —
that's about all.
"I was definitely known in high
school for my scientific bent."
