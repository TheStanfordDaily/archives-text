Trade deficit hits record total
Washington — Fhe nation s trade deficit soared
to a record $26.7 billion last year, the government
reported yestercJay, and a top administration offi
cial predicted a deficit nearly as large this year.
Imports of costlv foreign oil were a major cause
of the 1977 deficit, draining $42.1 billion from
American banks and pocketbooks, an increase of
$10 billion from a year earlier.
The huge trade deficit has been a chief reason
for the decline of the dollar on world money mar
kets in the past year. If the deficit continues as
predicted, further declines in the dollar appear
likely in 1978.
Both imports and exports set new highs during
1977, although imports grew much faster. I he
Commerce Department said imports of all goods
totaled $146.8 billion, a 22 per cent increase, while
exports totaled $120.1 billion, a 5 percent advance
from 1976.
The resulting deficit of $26.7 billion was more
than four times larger than the previous record
deficit of nearly $6.4 billion in 1972. The deficit a
year ago was just under $5.9 billion.
President Carter's chief economic adviser,
Charles Schultze, told reporters that the deficit in
1978 will be in "the neighborhood" of the 1977
deficit, although he forecast an improving trend
over the next few years.
Rhodesian talks still unsettled
Rabat, Malta — The United States and Britain
failed to persuade black guerrilla leaders yester
day to abandon their bloody five-year war against
Rhodesia's white government and accept a plan
for a peaceful settlement leading to black majority
rule.
U.S. Ambassador Andrew Young and British
Foreign Secretary David Owen said that the talks
with Robert Mugabe and )oshua Nkomo — co
leaders of the militant Patriotic Front — yielded no
agreements on major issues.
"The divisions are on important issues," Young
told reporters after emerging from a two-hour
morning conference on this Mediterranean island
nation. The talks will continue today.
Despite their intensive efforts, Young and
Owen acknowledged that thev failed to shift the

Patriotic Front leaders, who represent an esti
mated 20,000 guerrillas tighting inside and outside
Rhodesia, away from their pledge to oust Prime
Minister lan Smith's white government by force.
Senate passes new crime bill
Washington — The Senate passed a massive bill
last night that would consolidate and overhaul the
entire body of federal criminal law that has de
veloped piecemeal during the last 200 years.
One major goal of the legislation is to provide
greater uniformity and certainty in punishment for
federal crimes. But the bill also has a host of other
provisions, including a sharp reduction in penal
ties for possession of small amounts of
marijuana.
In two previous Congresses, the bill — known
then as "S-1" — became bogged down in disputes
over provisions that critics assailed as regressive
and repressive. The present compromise version,
stripped of the most controversial sections, was
introduced in April of last year by the late Sen.
)ohn McClellan (D-Ark.), and Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.).
Passage of the recodific ation measure, by a vote
of 72-15, came after eight days of debate. It was the
culmination of nearly 12 years of effort.
Atomic satellite pact discussed
Washington — President Jimmy Carter promised
yesterday to ask the Soviet Union not to send up
any more atomic satellites like the one that fell on
Canada and said "we would be glad to forego the
deployment of such satellites altogether.
Calling tor more rigid precautions among all
nations, the president said the United States and
the Soviet Union should try to develop a sure
fire" safety system to keep such nuclear-powei
satellites from falling to earth or into the atmos
phere.
"If we cannot evolve those failsafe methods,'
Carter said, "then I think there ought to be a tota
prohibition against earth-orbiting satellites,
would favor at this moment an agreement with the
Soviets to prohibit earth-orbiting satellites with
atomic or radiation material in them.
Carter spoke at a nationally-televised news con
ference, his second this year. He pledged to pur

sue the "failsafe" system and the atomic-satellite
ban with the Soviet Union.
Congress receives tax-cut bill
Washington — Treasury Secretary Michael Blu
menthal, carrying President jimmy Carter's tax
program to Capitol Hill yesterday, learned quickly
that Congress has a soft spot in its heart for middle
America and the expense accounts of
businessmen.
Few members of the tax-writing House Ways
and Means Committee volunteered support for
the package of tax cuts and revisions as the panel
opened hearings on the proposals. And few
vowed to oppose it.
However, Rep. Al Ullman (D-Ore.), chairman of
the committee, repeated his contention that the
$25-billion net tax cut proposed by Carter for 1979
is too large.
"I am still going to do my best to hold the reduc
tion to $15 billion to $20 billion net, but we are
going to have to give and take in all areas, so it will
be a different mix altogether" from what Carter
recommended, Ullman told reporters.
The Carter plan contains tax cuts for individuals
and business that are aimed at helping offset
higher Social Security taxes and some effects of
inflation.

Rhodesian talks still unsettled
Rabat, Malta — The United States and Britain
failed to persuade black guerrilla leaders yester
day to abandon their bloody five-year war against
Rhodesia's white government and accept a plan
for a peaceful settlement leading to black majority
rule.
U.S. Ambassador Andrew Young and British
Foreign Secretary David Owen said that the talks
with Robert Mugabe and )oshua Nkomo — co
leaders of the militant Patriotic Front — yielded no
agreements on major issues.
"The divisions are on important issues," Young
told reporters after emerging from a two-hour
morning conference on this Mediterranean island
nation. The talks will continue today.
Despite their intensive efforts, Young and
Owen acknowledged that thev failed to shift the

Patriotic Front leaders, who represent an esti
mated 20,000 guerrillas tighting inside and outside
Rhodesia, away from their pledge to oust Prime
Minister lan Smith's white government by force.
Senate passes new crime bill
Washington — The Senate passed a massive bill
last night that would consolidate and overhaul the
entire body of federal criminal law that has de
veloped piecemeal during the last 200 years.
One major goal of the legislation is to provide
greater uniformity and certainty in punishment for
federal crimes. But the bill also has a host of other
provisions, including a sharp reduction in penal
ties for possession of small amounts of
marijuana.
In two previous Congresses, the bill — known
then as "S-1" — became bogged down in disputes
over provisions that critics assailed as regressive
and repressive. The present compromise version,
stripped of the most controversial sections, was
introduced in April of last year by the late Sen.
)ohn McClellan (D-Ark.), and Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.).
Passage of the recodific ation measure, by a vote
of 72-15, came after eight days of debate. It was the
culmination of nearly 12 years of effort.
Atomic satellite pact discussed
Washington — President Jimmy Carter promised
yesterday to ask the Soviet Union not to send up
any more atomic satellites like the one that fell on
Canada and said "we would be glad to forego the
deployment of such satellites altogether.
Calling tor more rigid precautions among all
nations, the president said the United States and
the Soviet Union should try to develop a sure
fire" safety system to keep such nuclear-powei
satellites from falling to earth or into the atmos
phere.
"If we cannot evolve those failsafe methods,'
Carter said, "then I think there ought to be a tota
prohibition against earth-orbiting satellites,
would favor at this moment an agreement with the
Soviets to prohibit earth-orbiting satellites with
atomic or radiation material in them.
Carter spoke at a nationally-televised news con
ference, his second this year. He pledged to pur

sue the "failsafe" system and the atomic-satellite
ban with the Soviet Union.
Congress receives tax-cut bill
Washington — Treasury Secretary Michael Blu
menthal, carrying President jimmy Carter's tax
program to Capitol Hill yesterday, learned quickly
that Congress has a soft spot in its heart for middle
America and the expense accounts of
businessmen.
Few members of the tax-writing House Ways
and Means Committee volunteered support for
the package of tax cuts and revisions as the panel
opened hearings on the proposals. And few
vowed to oppose it.
However, Rep. Al Ullman (D-Ore.), chairman of
the committee, repeated his contention that the
$25-billion net tax cut proposed by Carter for 1979
is too large.
"I am still going to do my best to hold the reduc
tion to $15 billion to $20 billion net, but we are
going to have to give and take in all areas, so it will
be a different mix altogether" from what Carter
recommended, Ullman told reporters.
The Carter plan contains tax cuts for individuals
and business that are aimed at helping offset
higher Social Security taxes and some effects of
inflation.

Rhodesian talks still unsettled
Rabat, Malta — The United States and Britain
failed to persuade black guerrilla leaders yester
day to abandon their bloody five-year war against
Rhodesia's white government and accept a plan
for a peaceful settlement leading to black majority
rule.
U.S. Ambassador Andrew Young and British
Foreign Secretary David Owen said that the talks
with Robert Mugabe and )oshua Nkomo — co
leaders of the militant Patriotic Front — yielded no
agreements on major issues.
"The divisions are on important issues," Young
told reporters after emerging from a two-hour
morning conference on this Mediterranean island
nation. The talks will continue today.
Despite their intensive efforts, Young and
Owen acknowledged that thev failed to shift the

Patriotic Front leaders, who represent an esti
mated 20,000 guerrillas tighting inside and outside
Rhodesia, away from their pledge to oust Prime
Minister lan Smith's white government by force.
Senate passes new crime bill
Washington — The Senate passed a massive bill
last night that would consolidate and overhaul the
entire body of federal criminal law that has de
veloped piecemeal during the last 200 years.
One major goal of the legislation is to provide
greater uniformity and certainty in punishment for
federal crimes. But the bill also has a host of other
provisions, including a sharp reduction in penal
ties for possession of small amounts of
marijuana.
In two previous Congresses, the bill — known
then as "S-1" — became bogged down in disputes
over provisions that critics assailed as regressive
and repressive. The present compromise version,
stripped of the most controversial sections, was
introduced in April of last year by the late Sen.
)ohn McClellan (D-Ark.), and Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.).
Passage of the recodific ation measure, by a vote
of 72-15, came after eight days of debate. It was the
culmination of nearly 12 years of effort.
Atomic satellite pact discussed
Washington — President Jimmy Carter promised
yesterday to ask the Soviet Union not to send up
any more atomic satellites like the one that fell on
Canada and said "we would be glad to forego the
deployment of such satellites altogether.
Calling tor more rigid precautions among all
nations, the president said the United States and
the Soviet Union should try to develop a sure
fire" safety system to keep such nuclear-powei
satellites from falling to earth or into the atmos
phere.
"If we cannot evolve those failsafe methods,'
Carter said, "then I think there ought to be a tota
prohibition against earth-orbiting satellites,
would favor at this moment an agreement with the
Soviets to prohibit earth-orbiting satellites with
atomic or radiation material in them.
Carter spoke at a nationally-televised news con
ference, his second this year. He pledged to pur

sue the "failsafe" system and the atomic-satellite
ban with the Soviet Union.
Congress receives tax-cut bill
Washington — Treasury Secretary Michael Blu
menthal, carrying President jimmy Carter's tax
program to Capitol Hill yesterday, learned quickly
that Congress has a soft spot in its heart for middle
America and the expense accounts of
businessmen.
Few members of the tax-writing House Ways
and Means Committee volunteered support for
the package of tax cuts and revisions as the panel
opened hearings on the proposals. And few
vowed to oppose it.
However, Rep. Al Ullman (D-Ore.), chairman of
the committee, repeated his contention that the
$25-billion net tax cut proposed by Carter for 1979
is too large.
"I am still going to do my best to hold the reduc
tion to $15 billion to $20 billion net, but we are
going to have to give and take in all areas, so it will
be a different mix altogether" from what Carter
recommended, Ullman told reporters.
The Carter plan contains tax cuts for individuals
and business that are aimed at helping offset
higher Social Security taxes and some effects of
inflation.

Trade deficit hits record total
Washington — Fhe nation s trade deficit soared
to a record $26.7 billion last year, the government
reported yestercJay, and a top administration offi
cial predicted a deficit nearly as large this year.
Imports of costlv foreign oil were a major cause
of the 1977 deficit, draining $42.1 billion from
American banks and pocketbooks, an increase of
$10 billion from a year earlier.
The huge trade deficit has been a chief reason
for the decline of the dollar on world money mar
kets in the past year. If the deficit continues as
predicted, further declines in the dollar appear
likely in 1978.
Both imports and exports set new highs during
1977, although imports grew much faster. I he
Commerce Department said imports of all goods
totaled $146.8 billion, a 22 per cent increase, while
exports totaled $120.1 billion, a 5 percent advance
from 1976.
The resulting deficit of $26.7 billion was more
than four times larger than the previous record
deficit of nearly $6.4 billion in 1972. The deficit a
year ago was just under $5.9 billion.
President Carter's chief economic adviser,
Charles Schultze, told reporters that the deficit in
1978 will be in "the neighborhood" of the 1977
deficit, although he forecast an improving trend
over the next few years.
