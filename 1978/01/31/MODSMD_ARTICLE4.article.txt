After surviving three years in Chi
lean prisons, ASSU Guest Prof. Fer
nando Flores declared, "Each minute
of my life I am aware that I am alive
because I nearly lost my life three or
four times after the coup.''
Flores, a former cabinet minister in
the government of Salvador Allende,
is currently teaching a course on Chi
lean politics here.
Democracy in Chile ended in Sep
tember 1973 when the dictatorship of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet ousted Al
lende's regime.
Flores' class offers a personal ac
count which sheds some light on
political repression.
"To be in a political jail is a very

strange experience which marks you
forever because you learn about the
capacity people have for evil," Flores
said.
Flores was held without charges
for three years in Chilean prisons
after the overthrow of the social
democratic Allende government. He
held several cabinet positions in that
government including minister of fi
nance and general secretary of the
government. He is the highest rank
ing Allende government official in
the United States today.
"After the coup the world learned
about all the barbaric acts the fascists
in Chile committed and a preoccupa
tion began to grow for the arrested
and disappeared," Flores added.

He was freed by the Chilean junta
over a year ago after Stanford, Am
nesty International and a number of
international rights groups lobbied
for his release.
Hearrived in Palo Altoon August 6,
1976 and began teaching in the Com
puter Science Department. He is cur
rently teaching "Chilean Politics" as
an ASSU Guest Professor.
Flores accepts living in the United
States despite this country's role in
destabilization of the Chilean
economy during the Allende years.
"I believe the United States is part
of the reality of the world and speci
fically a part of the reality of Chile,"
he said as he shrugged his shoulders
and added, "We are all Americans in
the true sense of the word."
Flores, now 35, was only 29 when
he was appointed to his first post in
the Allende cabinet as under secret
ary of economics.
In 1973 Flores was active in dealing
with the problems created by a gen
eral truckers' strike as well as plan
ning strategies to reactivate a sagging
economy.
During this time Flores had close
working relations with Allende, who
is considered to be steadfastly de
voted to his socialist principles.
"I had a lot of discussions with Al
lende that made me realize he was
the type of person who never
