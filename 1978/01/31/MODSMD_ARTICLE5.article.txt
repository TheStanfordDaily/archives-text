### Andrea James 
The president of a doctor's union
here has been asked to supply the
state attorney general's office with
information regarding the Universi
ty's alleged double billing practices,
the Daily learned yesterday.
Dr. Robert Weinmann, president
of the Union of American Physicians

Local 7402, was asked to supply Al
Cordon, information officer of the
attorney general's office, with that
intormation after Weinmann quiz
zed Atty. Gen Evelle Younger when
Younger appeared on a radio station
panel news show last week.
During that show, Younger said he
knew nothing about investigation of
the University's alleged double
billing procedure.
The attorney general's office
serves as counsel for the Bureau of
Medical Quality Assurance (BMQA),
a state organization which recently
subpoenaed Stanford for all informa

tribution of physicians' professional
fees.
Weinmann said he believes the at
torney general's office should have
already been aware of the BMQA in
vestigation.
"The BMQA was definitely the ap
propriate way to go," Gordon said.
"But to the best of my knowledge,
the attorney general's office had no
prior knowledge ot Stanford's al
leged double billing practices."
He added that although Wein
mann had been asked to supply in
formation, the attorney general's of
fice was pursuing no formal investi
gation.
Weinmann has also sent letters to
all state legislators pointing out the
fact that Robert Rowland, executive
director of the BMQA, was formerly
the business manager for the De
partment of Medicine at Stanford.
"Is it fair to require him to investi
gate his own past business practices
which he presumably felt were hon
est at the time he worked there?"
Weinmann wrote in his letter.
In the letter, Weinmann also said
he is concerned because the benefit
payments branch of the State De
partment of Health is allegedly "con
sidering passing retroactive rules
