## CIR appointments wrong 
### 
Following the refusal of the ASSU
Senate and Nominations Committee
to nominate students to the new
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility, President Richard Lyman has
decided to initiate the administra
tion's own selection of student
commission members. Lyman's de

cision is both wrong and dangerous,
for it mishandles more than the CIR
controversy.
The system of selection under the
Dean of Student Affairs' supervision,
which was recently announced, fea
tures a computer generating a large
random list of students. That system

overrides the ASSU Constitution and
vitiates the system of student gov
ernment to which the University has
agreed for 10 years.
Lyman made a similar override in
1971 when the senate refused to
nominate students to the Stanford
judicial Council. Then Lyman cited
the large backlog of campus judicial
cases and the seriousness of the
charges involved in those cases. No
such imminent danger to campus
security and safety exists with the
senate's refusal to nominate stu
dents to a commission which will
discuss investment policies.
Currently, the only committee to
which the Dean of Student Affairs
can randomly select students, under
a system which he establishes, is the
SJC. The Dean can take that action
only in the event the senate doesn't
nominate student SJC members. Vet
Lyman, who has apparently forgot
ten the controversy and animosity
over the methods of choosing stu
dent members for the SJC, doesn't
seem to realize that students voted
on an SJC charter which specified
those methods. Students have yet to
ratify in an election such a selection
process for any other committee, in
cluding the CIR.
Furthermore, Lyman's initiation
of an administration process for
selecting the ClR's student members
does not answer the questions which
we and others have raised about the
efficacy of the trustee-revised CIR.
One of our editorial concerns arising
from the trustees' alterations to the
CIR is that the trustees could use
these changes to stifle the ClR's dis
cussion. By his action, Lyman has
stifled discusssion about the mean
ing of those changes.
Lyman's action also raises the
question of why a normally cautious
and lethargic administration is ram
rodding through the selection of the
ClR's student members. Adminis
trators might be attaching impor
tance to a Feb. 14 deadline for stock
divestiture set by the Stanford Com
mittee for a Responsible Investment
Policy. That deadline notwithstand
ing, administrators would do better
to negotiate with elected student
leaders now rather than worry about
deadlines.
Any students who would consider
serving on the CIR after being "ap
pointed" through the University's
system should at least realize that
they will be participating in a trans
gression of the ASSU Constitution,
and that they will most certainly
be referred to as representing "the
student body's opinion" in the fu
ture.
And those students who would
consider serving should know,
among other things, that ASSU offi
cials are concerned about this matter
and are attempting to resolve it with
administrators. Until the senate
nominates students, no students
should participate in this process
which the administration alone
creates and desires. Aside from the
present CIR controversy, a refusal to
participate is the best way to prevent
the administration from using its
own methods in the future to decide
the student representation on com
mittees.

ratify in an election such a selection
process for any other committee, in
cluding the CIR.
Furthermore, Lyman's initiation
of an administration process for
selecting the ClR's student members
does not answer the questions which
we and others have raised about the
efficacy of the trustee-revised CIR.
One of our editorial concerns arising
from the trustees' alterations to the
CIR is that the trustees could use
these changes to stifle the ClR's dis
cussion. By his action, Lyman has
stifled discusssion about the mean
ing of those changes.
Lyman's action also raises the
question of why a normally cautious
and lethargic administration is ram
rodding through the selection of the
ClR's student members. Adminis
trators might be attaching impor
tance to a Feb. 14 deadline for stock
divestiture set by the Stanford Com
mittee for a Responsible Investment
Policy. That deadline notwithstand
ing, administrators would do better
to negotiate with elected student
leaders now rather than worry about
deadlines.
Any students who would consider
serving on the CIR after being "ap
pointed" through the University's
system should at least realize that
they will be participating in a trans
gression of the ASSU Constitution,
and that they will most certainly
be referred to as representing "the
student body's opinion" in the fu
ture.
And those students who would
consider serving should know,
among other things, that ASSU offi
cials are concerned about this matter
and are attempting to resolve it with
administrators. Until the senate
nominates students, no students
should participate in this process
which the administration alone
creates and desires. Aside from the
present CIR controversy, a refusal to
participate is the best way to prevent
the administration from using its
own methods in the future to decide
the student representation on com
mittees.
Following the refusal of the ASSU
Senate and Nominations Committee
to nominate students to the new
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility, President Richard Lyman has
decided to initiate the administra
tion's own selection of student
commission members. Lyman's de

cision is both wrong and dangerous,
for it mishandles more than the CIR
controversy.
The system of selection under the
Dean of Student Affairs' supervision,
which was recently announced, fea
tures a computer generating a large
random list of students. That system

overrides the ASSU Constitution and
vitiates the system of student gov
ernment to which the University has
agreed for 10 years.
Lyman made a similar override in
1971 when the senate refused to
nominate students to the Stanford
judicial Council. Then Lyman cited
the large backlog of campus judicial
cases and the seriousness of the
charges involved in those cases. No
such imminent danger to campus
security and safety exists with the
senate's refusal to nominate stu
dents to a commission which will
discuss investment policies.
Currently, the only committee to
which the Dean of Student Affairs
can randomly select students, under
a system which he establishes, is the
SJC. The Dean can take that action
only in the event the senate doesn't
nominate student SJC members. Vet
Lyman, who has apparently forgot
ten the controversy and animosity
over the methods of choosing stu
dent members for the SJC, doesn't
seem to realize that students voted
on an SJC charter which specified
those methods. Students have yet to
ratify in an election such a selection
process for any other committee, in
cluding the CIR.
