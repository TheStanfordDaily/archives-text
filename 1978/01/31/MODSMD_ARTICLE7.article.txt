# New Direction's view
## Treaty supported 
### 
Steve Schiller

Within the next month a vitally im
portant foreign policy issue will
come to a vote in the Senate: the
Panama Canal Treaties. We in Stan
ford New Directions urge you to
counter the tide of pressure for de
feat of these treaties and exhort you
to write to your senator this week
supporting ratification.
Stanford New Directions is a cam
pus organization dedicated to study
ing and influencing issues and
policies which affect people
throughout the international system.
We seek to educate ourselves on the
global problems of our day and then
to take informed stands on issues,
lobbying decision-makers to adopt
humane and generous foreign
policies.
Such an issue currently at the
forefront of the United States foreign
policy agenda is the recently
negotiated treaties. After publishing
information and debate on the issue
and sponsoring a speech by History
Prof. John Wirth on the Treaties,
Stanford New Directions took a vote
of its membership and the ballots re
turned unanimously supported
ratification.
We are participating in the drive to
secure Senate ratification because
the issue is both timely and signific
ant. Timely because the Senate will
soon consider the two treaties — one
concerned with the the operation
and transition to Panamanian juris
diction and the other with the perma
nent neutrality of the canal. In addi
tion, these come at a time when the
U.S. is fighting to re-establish its credi
bility in Latin America and all de
veloping countries.
The issue is significant because it
forms a test case of our willingness to
deal with smaller nations on an equal
basis. The Canal represents a vestige

of American colonialism, and failure
to obtain Senate approval will de
monstrate American intransigence to
the rest of the world.
Furthermore, the treaties do not
abdicate US. "sovereignty;" the orig
inal 1903 document never gave us
such a windfall, and the Supreme
Court in 1948 described the area as
"admittedly territory over which we
do not have sovereignty." The ag
reements merely transfer control of
the area to Panama and provide for
its permanent neutrality.
Opponents of the treaties have
been very loud in expressing their
views to the Senate. The American
Conservative Union has been active
since last summer and has broadcast
a documentary over 75 television sta
tions through the country. A number
of other powerful conservative
groups oppose ratification, includ
ing the American Legion. Conserva
tive mail campaign expert Richard
Viguerier will be sending five million
anti-treaty letters in coming weeks,
according to the New Republic.
Many senators remain undecided,
including Sens. Howard Baker (R-
Tenn), Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex), Ed
ward Brooke (R-Mass.), Dennis De-
Concini and Barry Goldwater (D and
R-Ariz.), Floyd Haskell ID-Colo.),
Charles Percy (R-lll.) and Richard
Schwciker (R-Penn.), among others.
Expressions of support for the ratifi
cation will be vital to secure their
votes for passage. In addition,
senators who have already come out
for approval should be reinforced by
their constituents since mail is cur
rently running strongly against the
treaties.

tional relations, submitted this in be

mittee of Stanford New Directions.)

Viguerier will be sending five million
anti-treaty letters in coming weeks,
according to the New Republic.
Many senators remain undecided,
including Sens. Howard Baker (R-
Tenn), Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex), Ed
ward Brooke (R-Mass.), Dennis De-
Concini and Barry Goldwater (D and
R-Ariz.), Floyd Haskell ID-Colo.),
Charles Percy (R-lll.) and Richard
Schwciker (R-Penn.), among others.
Expressions of support for the ratifi
cation will be vital to secure their
votes for passage. In addition,
senators who have already come out
for approval should be reinforced by
their constituents since mail is cur
rently running strongly against the
treaties.

Within the next month a vitally im
portant foreign policy issue will
come to a vote in the Senate: the
Panama Canal Treaties. We in Stan
ford New Directions urge you to
counter the tide of pressure for de
feat of these treaties and exhort you
to write to your senator this week
supporting ratification.
Stanford New Directions is a cam
pus organization dedicated to study
ing and influencing issues and
policies which affect people
throughout the international system.
We seek to educate ourselves on the
global problems of our day and then
to take informed stands on issues,
lobbying decision-makers to adopt
humane and generous foreign
policies.
Such an issue currently at the
forefront of the United States foreign
policy agenda is the recently
negotiated treaties. After publishing
information and debate on the issue
and sponsoring a speech by History
Prof. John Wirth on the Treaties,
Stanford New Directions took a vote
of its membership and the ballots re
turned unanimously supported
ratification.
We are participating in the drive to
secure Senate ratification because
the issue is both timely and signific
ant. Timely because the Senate will
soon consider the two treaties — one
concerned with the the operation
and transition to Panamanian juris
diction and the other with the perma
nent neutrality of the canal. In addi
tion, these come at a time when the
U.S. is fighting to re-establish its credi
bility in Latin America and all de
veloping countries.
The issue is significant because it
forms a test case of our willingness to
deal with smaller nations on an equal
basis. The Canal represents a vestige

of American colonialism, and failure
to obtain Senate approval will de
monstrate American intransigence to
the rest of the world.
Furthermore, the treaties do not
abdicate US. "sovereignty;" the orig
inal 1903 document never gave us
such a windfall, and the Supreme
Court in 1948 described the area as
"admittedly territory over which we
do not have sovereignty." The ag
reements merely transfer control of
the area to Panama and provide for
its permanent neutrality.
Opponents of the treaties have
been very loud in expressing their
views to the Senate. The American
Conservative Union has been active
since last summer and has broadcast
a documentary over 75 television sta
tions through the country. A number
of other powerful conservative
groups oppose ratification, includ
ing the American Legion. Conserva
