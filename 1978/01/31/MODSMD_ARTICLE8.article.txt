# Letters to the 'Daily' editor
## 
### 
Thursday
I will miss the weekly Thursday
section of the Daily. Its format gave
writers a unique opportunity to un
wind and build a really detailed
perspective into a long article.
Stephen Crolius, former Thursday
editor, has made a fine addition to
the usual media fare on campus. If
the conflict was merely over the ina
bility to satisfy a deadline, then
surely this could have been sur
mounted without a resignation. But
both former Daily editor )acob
Young and Crolius reflect a deeper
antagonism in their published view
points, and it seems to surface in a
fuzzy debate about objectivity in the
Daily
I am astounded. Does it really
need to be stated that newspapers
are never objective? That the selec
tion of wording, hidden generaliza
tions, the selection of sources, and
the decision of what to print all lend a
coloring to its portrayal of world
events?
The job of both writer and editor is
to see that columns are not man
ipulative in their use of words and
concepts (I cite the blatant overuse
of the word "terrorist"), and that the
tacts on which a story or "opinion
piece" hinge and which shape the
writer's bias are clearly stated. The
task is to advance a coherent
perspective to the reader, rather
than simply imparting a prejudice.
The information one considers
important (and therefore worth
printing) differs depending on politi
cal outlook and personal experience,
for writer, editor and every reader. If
a newspaper doesn't desire to reflect
a specific political orientation, the
obvious recourse is to print the work
of many writers with differing, but
well-developed perspectives.
Instead we hear editors invoking
their newspaper's "objectivity" as
the basis for decisions and ensuing

disagreement. It is like listening to
Nixon talk about national security.

Marriage, Cohabitation and
Benefits
There appear to be several implica
tions of Cynthia Lehigh's article in
last Friday's Daily, which deserve
recognition. The basic point at issue
is whether the benefits of marriage
should be extended to couples who
prefer to be living together without
going through the marriage process.
First consider the case in which
one man "cohabitates" with six
women at the same time in the same
household. If this man were a stu
dent at Stanford, would all six
women have privileges to fhe Stan
ford facilities? Polygamy is consi
dered illegal thereby providing legal
prevention of such a situation hap
pening in the case of marriage.
But what about cohabitation? The
spouse card process in which only
one card is issued prevents such a
situation. The inverse to this is the
case where the husband and wife
elect not to live in the same house
hold. There are many examples
where each individual of a marriage
live in separate dwellings.
In comparing these two paradoxi
cal cases, there seems to be a con
siderable difference between
cohabitation and marriage.
Cohabitating has nothing to do with
the issue, but rather the issue is the
legality and liability just as Dr.
McClenahan states.
Herein seems to lie the dichotomy
of the issue. Take for example the
student health center case. Under
what condition does a person be
come liable for the debts incurred by
another person.
In reality Ann and Mike after hav
ing lived together for over 5 years

might be considered legally married
via common law in which case Ann
and Mike are kidding no one but
themselves. However, common law
marriage requires both cohabitation
and mutual consent.
The case of Lee Marvin and
Michelle Triola which Lehigh cites as
evidence that "courts and legisla
tures are beginning to recognize this
trend" had little to do with the fact
that they were cohabitating for six
years, but was based on the fact that
an "expressed oral agreement" or
contract had been made between
two people. The state of California
doesn't recognize common law mar
riages.
Ann and Mike seem to desire to
exist in two opposing states simul
taneously. But how can they expect
to have the legality and liability which
marriage offers and still avoid the lia
bility and legality which cohabitation
offers?

Symphony review
No material appearing in the Daily
has ever prompted me to write a let
ter of protest until now. I was appal
led by David Lang's review (Daily,
|an. 24) of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra's performance last
week. Never have I disagreed more
with a review.
Lang's main criticism was that
Conductor Seiji Ozawa (in his last
brilliant concert of the season at San
Francisco) and the orchestra were
out of time. I was sitting less than 15
feet from Ozawa throughout the per
formance and not once did I notice
the slightest disparity between Oza
wa's famed conducting and the or
chestra's professional interpreta
tion. But I suppose I could have been
wrong.
Nor would I say (for I disapprove ot
slander) that the first clarinetist

"sounded as it he were swallowing
razor blades in (he middle ot his
solos," as his playing sounded flaw
lessly competent to me. Lang's simile
seems particularly inappropriate
when one notes that there was no
audible gurgling or visible blood,
which, it seems to me, would result
from having eaten those razor
blades. But then again, iang may
have heard something in the
clarinetist s performance that I did
not. No, mine is not the simple case
ot aesthetic disagreement.
Langs review is a classic case ot
dilettantish criticism throughout
particularly when he dares to belittle
Brahms sublime talent in the
slightest: "The evening began with
Brahms Third Symphony. . This is
an old 1188b standard of the sym
phonic repertoire that manv ot the
plavers could have probably pei
formed trom memory, and its
melodies are so well known that the
audience knew most of it before the
show began."
First of all, Mr. Lang, thank you tor
reminding us that 188? is indeed
quite old. Beethoven's Fifth and
Ninth Symphonies are even older
standard symphonic repetoires with
even more familiar melodies. Obvi
ously, since they are both so old and
well known they should not be per
formed either.
It is too often forgotten that a critic
needn't criticize simply to show that
he has seen and feels he understands
a work of art. Gratuitous and
sophomoric comments like, "(the)
lyrical melodies of the second and
third movements were schmalzed in
something that even Tchaikovsky
would have grimaced at," have no
place in an intelligent criticism All
involved, including the Daily's read
ers, deserve better than that.
