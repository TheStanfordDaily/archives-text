THINKING ABOUT
PEACE CORPS OR VISTA?
It's a completely new day for people interested in be
coming Peace Corps or VISTA volunteers, and recruiters
will be on campus next week to tell Stanford students all
about it. They're especially anxious to meet with seniors
and grad students.
What's the new day all about? It simply means that
while Peace Corps still welcomes those with specialized
disciplines, more people with liberal arts degrees can
qualify. And if you have any kind of degree or experi
ence in community organizing work, chances are good
you can become a VISTA.
The Peace Corps/VISTA reps will be at White Memorial
Plaza from 10:00 am to 3 pm, Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday, Feb. 7-9. And plan also to see a variety of
Peace Corps/VISTA films, which will be shown in Tresid
der Union on Feb. 7, in room 270, and on Feb. 8, in room
132.
THINK ABOUT IT.
