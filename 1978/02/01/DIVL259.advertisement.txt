Tired of the mundane?
Bored with classwork?
Then break out of your routine and join the Daily staff. Writers, proofread
ers, layout people and wire editors are needed now, and you can help do it.
There's no required time committment and the pay isn't too good, but the
rewards are numerous. And best of all - we train you. There is no experi
ence required, outside of a basic knowledge of the English language. There
is a new staff meeting tomorrow at 2 p.m. in the Daily office. We're easy to
find -just across Lomita Mall from Terman Engineering Center.
