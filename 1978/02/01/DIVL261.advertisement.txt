That's what Doug Gait, Finance Manager of the Phi Delt Fraternity
said to Mark Triska, the Stanford Community Representative for
Northern California Savings and Loan Association.
"Probably the biggest plus factor of a NCS savings account is the
Telephone Transfer Service, allowing our house to make the highest
interest rate possible up to the date at which we'll need our money
transferred to our checking account. It makes money for us and
saves me time. The Palo Alto branch office is one of the closest
savings and loans around, and its hours are great. It's also nice to
have an on-campus representative available, to help us set up
further accounts and to fill me in on the many different accounts and
services that NCS has to offer our house."
Remember, Mark is just a phone call away.
