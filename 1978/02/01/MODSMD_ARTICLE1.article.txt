# 'Overt neglect of senate's authority'
## ASSU denounces University move to nominate students to CIR 
### Sara Lessley 
The ASSU Senate charged last
night that the administration's recent
decision to appoint students to the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility was "a clear attempt to usurp
the constitutionally delegated power
of the ASSU."
The senate had earlier refused to
nominate students for the CIR, in
protest of the ClR's guidelines. On
Friday, President Richard Lyman an
nounced a plan for placing students
on the CIR.
That plan, according to last night's
resolution, represents "overt neg
lect" of the senate position as rep
resentative of the student body.
The resolution requests that Ly
man, Dean of Students Affairs James
Lyons, Vice President for Public Af
fairs Robert Rosenzweig and Vice
President for Business and Finance
William Massy come to the next se
nate meeting to discuss CIR nomina
tions.
The senate asked the administra
tion to stop its selection process until
that time.
The resolution also urged students
contacted by the administration to
refuse to participate on the proposed
committee.
'Impersonated search'
Introducing the proposal, Par
liamentarian Mike Veiluva called Ly
man's action a "mechanized, imper
sonalized search, and a slap in the
face to the ASSU."
Sen. Wayne Herriford said he ag
reed in "principle and spirit" with
the resolution. But he said "deliver
ing emotional and rhetorical
speeches condemning individuals"
are not productive. Herriford urged
the senate to act in a "more produc
tive and professional" way.
"The senate has the right to say we
disagree and choose not to nominate
students," Herriford said.

But he added, the language of the
original resolution, which "con
demned" Lyman's action, was a
threat, and he said threats have to be
carried out.
Sen. Tom McCormack urged the
senate to take the "opportunity to
rise above all the pettiness inherent
in this situation."
McCormack added he thought the
University had overreacted in this
"crisis." But, he maintained, the se
nate too, acted in haste in supporting
refusal to nominate students to the
CIR.
Bad policy measure
Sen. Howard Wolf said he thought
the resolution was a bad policy mat
ter. He said h« felt students need to
serve on the CIR to have any com
munication with the administration
and trustees.
The amended measure passed by a
vote of 14-0-2, with Sens. Kenneth
Nunn and Howard Wolf abstaining.
Nunn urged passage of a stronger
resolution while Wolf called for a
weaker resolution.
In his opening remarks, Chairper
son Fred Grethel announced the res
ignation of Sen. Marvin Anderson
from the senate, and the appoint
ment of Alternate Sen. Lori Hunter to
full senator.
Turning to the senate's legislative
productivity, Grethel said, "The time
has come for the senate to decide
what it's going to do. The chair is
tired of generating legislation so the
senate has something to do.
"If Lyman had not done what he
has done, we would not have any
thing to talk about tonight," he said.
'Recommitment'
Sen. Steve Buckley called for a "re
commitment" on the part of
senators. Most of the work done by
the senate has been "paper legisla
tion," he said. There has been very
little of substance, he maintained.

The senate dissolved into argu
ments and side discussion several
times. Herriford objected to the
"rude and inappropriate conduct."
Grethel asked senators to sign up
for participation in the dorm out
reach program, designed to improve
communications between the senate
and the student body.
Grethel said, "We are bound to do
it, because we resolved to do it." The
dorm outreach measure was passed
last quarter.
Report on its way
In other business, Grethel an
nounced that the Elections Review
Board (ERB) report will be released

soon.
Grethel read a Faculty Senate
statement which agreed in spirit with
the ASSU Senate resolution on sexist
language.
Grethel said receiving a mere "ag
reement in spirit" was another
example of the "senate noting
its impotence." Faculty Senate
members could have passed a
stronger resolution on language
without "any great sacrifice on their
part," Grethel said.
Their failure to do so indicates
"they don't want to take us seri
ously."

The ASSU Senate charged last
night that the administration's recent
decision to appoint students to the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility was "a clear attempt to usurp
the constitutionally delegated power
of the ASSU."
The senate had earlier refused to
nominate students for the CIR, in
protest of the ClR's guidelines. On
Friday, President Richard Lyman an
nounced a plan for placing students
on the CIR.
That plan, according to last night's
resolution, represents "overt neg
lect" of the senate position as rep
resentative of the student body.
The resolution requests that Ly
man, Dean of Students Affairs James
Lyons, Vice President for Public Af
fairs Robert Rosenzweig and Vice
President for Business and Finance
William Massy come to the next se
nate meeting to discuss CIR nomina
tions.
The senate asked the administra
tion to stop its selection process until
that time.
The resolution also urged students
contacted by the administration to
refuse to participate on the proposed
committee.
'Impersonated search'
Introducing the proposal, Par
liamentarian Mike Veiluva called Ly
man's action a "mechanized, imper
sonalized search, and a slap in the
face to the ASSU."
Sen. Wayne Herriford said he ag
reed in "principle and spirit" with
the resolution. But he said "deliver
ing emotional and rhetorical
speeches condemning individuals"
are not productive. Herriford urged
the senate to act in a "more produc
tive and professional" way.
"The senate has the right to say we
disagree and choose not to nominate
students," Herriford said.

But he added, the language of the
original resolution, which "con
demned" Lyman's action, was a
threat, and he said threats have to be
carried out.
Sen. Tom McCormack urged the
senate to take the "opportunity to
rise above all the pettiness inherent
in this situation."
McCormack added he thought the
University had overreacted in this
"crisis." But, he maintained, the se
nate too, acted in haste in supporting
refusal to nominate students to the
CIR.
Bad policy measure
Sen. Howard Wolf said he thought
the resolution was a bad policy mat
ter. He said h« felt students need to
serve on the CIR to have any com
munication with the administration
and trustees.
The amended measure passed by a
vote of 14-0-2, with Sens. Kenneth
Nunn and Howard Wolf abstaining.
Nunn urged passage of a stronger
resolution while Wolf called for a
weaker resolution.
In his opening remarks, Chairper
son Fred Grethel announced the res
ignation of Sen. Marvin Anderson
from the senate, and the appoint
ment of Alternate Sen. Lori Hunter to
full senator.
Turning to the senate's legislative
productivity, Grethel said, "The time
has come for the senate to decide
what it's going to do. The chair is
tired of generating legislation so the
senate has something to do.
"If Lyman had not done what he
has done, we would not have any
thing to talk about tonight," he said.
'Recommitment'
Sen. Steve Buckley called for a "re
commitment" on the part of
senators. Most of the work done by
the senate has been "paper legisla
tion," he said. There has been very
little of substance, he maintained.

The senate dissolved into argu
ments and side discussion several
times. Herriford objected to the
"rude and inappropriate conduct."
Grethel asked senators to sign up
for participation in the dorm out
reach program, designed to improve
communications between the senate
and the student body.
Grethel said, "We are bound to do
it, because we resolved to do it." The
dorm outreach measure was passed
last quarter.
Report on its way
In other business, Grethel an
nounced that the Elections Review
Board (ERB) report will be released

soon.
Grethel read a Faculty Senate
statement which agreed in spirit with
the ASSU Senate resolution on sexist
language.
Grethel said receiving a mere "ag
reement in spirit" was another
example of the "senate noting
its impotence." Faculty Senate
members could have passed a
stronger resolution on language
without "any great sacrifice on their
part," Grethel said.
Their failure to do so indicates
"they don't want to take us seri
ously."
