# Constitution ignored
## CIR: University out of bounds 
### 
Larson et al.

Several weeks ago, the ASSU
Nominations Committee unanim
ously decided, with the support of
the majority of the ASSU Senate and
Council of Presidents, to not take any
action regarding the nomination of
students to serve on the newly
formed Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR).
That decision, as has been articu
lated elsewhere, was based on a
strong sense of dissatisfaction with
the statement on investment respon
sibility approved by the Board of
Trustees. To have nominated stu
dents to serve on the CIR would have
legitimized that committee and the
statement which created it. The Stan
ford Daily, in its editorial of |an. 13,
supported the decision reached by
the ASSU.
Late last Friday afternoon, the Uni
versity announced its plans to nomi
nate and appoint students to the new

CIR without the involvement of
ASSU. To accomplish this, the ad
ministration has decided to ran
domly generate a list of 12 students
who are willing to serve on the com
mission. These 12 students will then
be brought together to be given an
introduction to the CIR by members
of the University administration, and
then left to decide among them
selves who will be appointed to the
commission.
While the method chosen by the
University to nominate and appoint
students is unique and creative (par
ticularly the use of self-selection),
the University is nevertheless reject
ing ASSU and ignoring the issues
raised by our student government —
an action which we cannot support.
The ASSU Constitution, and all
amendments to it, must be accepted
by two-thirds of the student body
voting in an election, and then ap-

proved by the Board of Trustees.
Since Sept. 26, 1969, when President
K.S. Pitzer (acting for the Board of
Trustees) approved our Constitu
tion, the University has respected
the rights and responsibilities of stu
dents and our student government
as outlined in that document. In its
recent action however, the Univer
sity has disregarded the constitution
which they had previously approved.
Article 11, Section 8A of the con
stitution states that all students
nominated for any University com
mittee, including those of the Board
of Trustees, shall be selected by the
Nominations Committee, subject to
the approval of the senate. Hence, it
is the mandated power of ASSU, and
only of ASSU, to nominate students
to serve on the CIR.
Representatives
Secondly, the constitution states
that all students are members of
ASSU (Article I, Section 2) and that
students on committees are rep
resentatives of ASSU (Article 11, Sec
tion 8A). To tie it all together, Article
I, Section 3A states, "Only the As
sociation and its designees shall rep
resent the entire Stanford student
body in any dealings with other ele
ments of the University."
Consequently, since students on
committees are representatives of
ASSU and the entire student body,
and therefore must be designated as
such by ASSU, it follows that stu
dents serving on the CIR must be
chosen by ASSU, not by the Univer
sity.
The University, however, in its re
sponse to ASSU's refusal to nomi
nate students to the CIR, has violated
the constitution as outlined above.
First, they are going to nominate stu
dents to serve on the CIR through a
partially random, partially self
selection method which is in direct
conflict with the method stated in the
constitution. Second, the students
on the CIR, once nominated and ap
pointed in the proposed manner,
will not be designees of the ASSU
and the student body, but rather, of
the University.
One must then ask, what is the

purpose of the constitution, and of
student government in general, if the
University can change the rules to
meet its own needs? This disregard
for the Constitution of the As
sociated Students of Stanford Uni
versity can only be interpreted as a
lack of willingness to grant students a
meaningful voice in the operation of
the University, and as a lack of faith in
the students which they purport to
be among the best anywhere.
The University, in its decision to
appoint students in an extra-ASSU
fashion, is ignoring the issues raised
by ASSU, and is using its resources
and influence to literally overpower
the previously recognized legitimate
form of student government at Stan
ford University.
We urge that students who are ap
proached by the administration to
serve on the CIR be aware of three
salient points:
First, that the ASSU refused to
exercise its constitutional right and
authority to nominate students in the
belief that the guidelines under
which the CIR is charged to operate
will render the commission ineffec
tual. Further, weurgeyou toseekout
members of the ASSU who were in
volved in the decision-making on
this issue, as it is unlikely the ad
ministration will present our view.
Second, your involvement would
legitimize the University administra
tion's circumvention of the accepted
mechanism for student representa
tion, as outlined in the ASSU Con
stitution.
Third, student participation in this
extra-constitutional process would
obscure the issue raised by the ASSU
in its boycott, and would serve to
stifle discussion, rather than to pro
mote it.
For the reasons outlined above, we
request that students carefully con
sider their role in this process before
agreeing to participate.

be among the best anywhere.
The University, in its decision to
appoint students in an extra-ASSU
fashion, is ignoring the issues raised
by ASSU, and is using its resources
and influence to literally overpower
the previously recognized legitimate
form of student government at Stan
ford University.
We urge that students who are ap
proached by the administration to
serve on the CIR be aware of three
salient points:
First, that the ASSU refused to
exercise its constitutional right and
authority to nominate students in the
belief that the guidelines under
which the CIR is charged to operate
will render the commission ineffec
tual. Further, weurgeyou toseekout
members of the ASSU who were in
volved in the decision-making on
this issue, as it is unlikely the ad
ministration will present our view.
Second, your involvement would
legitimize the University administra
tion's circumvention of the accepted
mechanism for student representa
tion, as outlined in the ASSU Con
stitution.
Third, student participation in this
extra-constitutional process would
obscure the issue raised by the ASSU
in its boycott, and would serve to
stifle discussion, rather than to pro
mote it.
For the reasons outlined above, we
request that students carefully con
sider their role in this process before
agreeing to participate.

Several weeks ago, the ASSU
Nominations Committee unanim
ously decided, with the support of
the majority of the ASSU Senate and
Council of Presidents, to not take any
action regarding the nomination of
students to serve on the newly
formed Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR).
That decision, as has been articu
lated elsewhere, was based on a
strong sense of dissatisfaction with
the statement on investment respon
sibility approved by the Board of
Trustees. To have nominated stu
dents to serve on the CIR would have
legitimized that committee and the
statement which created it. The Stan
ford Daily, in its editorial of |an. 13,
supported the decision reached by
the ASSU.
Late last Friday afternoon, the Uni
versity announced its plans to nomi
nate and appoint students to the new

CIR without the involvement of
ASSU. To accomplish this, the ad
ministration has decided to ran
domly generate a list of 12 students
who are willing to serve on the com
mission. These 12 students will then
be brought together to be given an
introduction to the CIR by members
of the University administration, and
then left to decide among them
selves who will be appointed to the
commission.
While the method chosen by the
University to nominate and appoint
students is unique and creative (par
ticularly the use of self-selection),
the University is nevertheless reject
ing ASSU and ignoring the issues
raised by our student government —
an action which we cannot support.
The ASSU Constitution, and all
amendments to it, must be accepted
by two-thirds of the student body
voting in an election, and then ap-

proved by the Board of Trustees.
Since Sept. 26, 1969, when President
K.S. Pitzer (acting for the Board of
Trustees) approved our Constitu
tion, the University has respected
the rights and responsibilities of stu
dents and our student government
as outlined in that document. In its
recent action however, the Univer
sity has disregarded the constitution
which they had previously approved.
Article 11, Section 8A of the con
stitution states that all students
nominated for any University com
mittee, including those of the Board
of Trustees, shall be selected by the
Nominations Committee, subject to
the approval of the senate. Hence, it
is the mandated power of ASSU, and
only of ASSU, to nominate students
to serve on the CIR.
Representatives
Secondly, the constitution states
that all students are members of
ASSU (Article I, Section 2) and that
students on committees are rep
resentatives of ASSU (Article 11, Sec
tion 8A). To tie it all together, Article
I, Section 3A states, "Only the As
sociation and its designees shall rep
resent the entire Stanford student
body in any dealings with other ele
ments of the University."
Consequently, since students on
committees are representatives of
ASSU and the entire student body,
and therefore must be designated as
such by ASSU, it follows that stu
dents serving on the CIR must be
chosen by ASSU, not by the Univer
sity.
The University, however, in its re
sponse to ASSU's refusal to nomi
nate students to the CIR, has violated
the constitution as outlined above.
First, they are going to nominate stu
dents to serve on the CIR through a
partially random, partially self
selection method which is in direct
conflict with the method stated in the
constitution. Second, the students
on the CIR, once nominated and ap
pointed in the proposed manner,
will not be designees of the ASSU
and the student body, but rather, of
the University.
One must then ask, what is the

purpose of the constitution, and of
student government in general, if the
University can change the rules to
meet its own needs? This disregard
for the Constitution of the As
sociated Students of Stanford Uni
versity can only be interpreted as a
lack of willingness to grant students a
meaningful voice in the operation of
the University, and as a lack of faith in
the students which they purport to

tion 8A). To tie it all together, Article
I, Section 3A states, "Only the As
sociation and its designees shall rep
resent the entire Stanford student
body in any dealings with other ele
ments of the University."
Consequently, since students on
committees are representatives of
ASSU and the entire student body,
and therefore must be designated as
such by ASSU, it follows that stu
dents serving on the CIR must be
chosen by ASSU, not by the Univer
sity.
The University, however, in its re
sponse to ASSU's refusal to nomi
nate students to the CIR, has violated
the constitution as outlined above.
First, they are going to nominate stu
dents to serve on the CIR through a
partially random, partially self
selection method which is in direct
conflict with the method stated in the
constitution. Second, the students
on the CIR, once nominated and ap
pointed in the proposed manner,
will not be designees of the ASSU
and the student body, but rather, of
the University.
One must then ask, what is the

purpose of the constitution, and of
student government in general, if the
University can change the rules to
meet its own needs? This disregard
for the Constitution of the As
sociated Students of Stanford Uni
versity can only be interpreted as a
lack of willingness to grant students a
meaningful voice in the operation of
the University, and as a lack of faith in
the students which they purport to
be among the best anywhere.
The University, in its decision to
appoint students in an extra-ASSU
fashion, is ignoring the issues raised
by ASSU, and is using its resources
and influence to literally overpower
the previously recognized legitimate
form of student government at Stan
ford University.
We urge that students who are ap
proached by the administration to
serve on the CIR be aware of three
salient points:
First, that the ASSU refused to
exercise its constitutional right and
authority to nominate students in the
belief that the guidelines under
which the CIR is charged to operate
will render the commission ineffec
tual. Further, weurgeyou toseekout
members of the ASSU who were in
volved in the decision-making on
this issue, as it is unlikely the ad
ministration will present our view.
Second, your involvement would
legitimize the University administra
tion's circumvention of the accepted
mechanism for student representa
tion, as outlined in the ASSU Con
stitution.
Third, student participation in this
extra-constitutional process would
obscure the issue raised by the ASSU
in its boycott, and would serve to
stifle discussion, rather than to pro
mote it.
For the reasons outlined above, we
request that students carefully con
sider their role in this process before
agreeing to participate.

Several weeks ago, the ASSU
Nominations Committee unanim
ously decided, with the support of
the majority of the ASSU Senate and
Council of Presidents, to not take any
action regarding the nomination of
students to serve on the newly
formed Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR).
That decision, as has been articu
lated elsewhere, was based on a
strong sense of dissatisfaction with
the statement on investment respon
sibility approved by the Board of
Trustees. To have nominated stu
dents to serve on the CIR would have
legitimized that committee and the
statement which created it. The Stan
ford Daily, in its editorial of |an. 13,
supported the decision reached by
the ASSU.
Late last Friday afternoon, the Uni
versity announced its plans to nomi
nate and appoint students to the new

CIR without the involvement of
ASSU. To accomplish this, the ad
ministration has decided to ran
domly generate a list of 12 students
who are willing to serve on the com
mission. These 12 students will then
be brought together to be given an
introduction to the CIR by members
of the University administration, and
then left to decide among them
selves who will be appointed to the
commission.
While the method chosen by the
University to nominate and appoint
students is unique and creative (par
ticularly the use of self-selection),
the University is nevertheless reject
ing ASSU and ignoring the issues
raised by our student government —
an action which we cannot support.
The ASSU Constitution, and all
amendments to it, must be accepted
by two-thirds of the student body
voting in an election, and then ap-

proved by the Board of Trustees.
Since Sept. 26, 1969, when President
K.S. Pitzer (acting for the Board of
Trustees) approved our Constitu
tion, the University has respected
the rights and responsibilities of stu
dents and our student government
as outlined in that document. In its
recent action however, the Univer
sity has disregarded the constitution
which they had previously approved.
Article 11, Section 8A of the con
stitution states that all students
nominated for any University com
mittee, including those of the Board
of Trustees, shall be selected by the
Nominations Committee, subject to
the approval of the senate. Hence, it
is the mandated power of ASSU, and
only of ASSU, to nominate students
to serve on the CIR.
Representatives
Secondly, the constitution states
that all students are members of
ASSU (Article I, Section 2) and that
students on committees are rep
resentatives of ASSU (Article 11, Sec
tion 8A). To tie it all together, Article
I, Section 3A states, "Only the As
sociation and its designees shall rep
resent the entire Stanford student
body in any dealings with other ele
ments of the University."
Consequently, since students on
committees are representatives of
ASSU and the entire student body,
and therefore must be designated as
such by ASSU, it follows that stu
dents serving on the CIR must be
chosen by ASSU, not by the Univer
sity.
