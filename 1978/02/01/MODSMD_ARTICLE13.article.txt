### Charlie Smith 
The Stanford Circle K club, a recently
formed service organization sponsored by
Kiwanis International, became an official
chapter of International Circle K last week
at a banquet in Tresidder Union.
The program began with a four-course
meal followed by a performance by a bar
bershop quartet. Jay Wren, lieutenant
governor of the San Andreas division of
Circle K, presented the charter to the club
and delivered a speech.
Hal Forbes, president of the Palo Alto
Kiwanis presented the club with the offi
cial pin, certificate and banner. Forbes
spoke about the need of the Kiwanis to
"reach out and help humanity." He stres
sed democracy, good leadership and par
ticipation as important goals for the new
chapter. Forbes closed his speech by wish
ing the club luck and promising that the
Palo Alto Kiwanis would continue to sup
port them.

Kristen Powell, president, gave a brief
history of the club. Some 15 students first
met to form a Circle K chapter here last
September. The group dwindled to about
five members who continued their efforts
to establish an official club.
Powell said their dreams were finally
realized at the banquet and acknowledged
the help of Ralph White, club adviser and
former president of the Palo Alto Kiwanis
Club, and Ray Young, faculty adviser.
Powell introduced the keynote speaker,
Randy Swing, vice president of Circle K
International.
Swing stressed the need for faith in the
face of one's failures and said the impor
tant people are those who try to help. "Ay
Kiwanis, you have the opportunity to try."
Forbes added, "through Circle K you
can do something other than follow; you
can try to reach out, to lead."
Dan Germain, the governor of the
California-Nevada-Hawaii district of Circle

K, gave an example of the way in which the
organization has reached out to help.
When he was president of the club at San
Diego State University he said he heard on
the radio that a girl was fighting a long
illnessand that her parents needed money
to pay her medical bills. His club raised
$1000 in the community through rallies
and telethons.
The meeting was adjourned after Ger
main's speech and a benediction.
The Circle K club currently has 41 clubs
with 640 members in the district. It was
founded in 194b as a sponsored youth pro
ject of Kiwanis Club International, the
third-largest service organization in
America.
Students interested in the Circle K club
should come to the weekly meetings at 7

The Stanford Circle K club, a recently
formed service organization sponsored by
Kiwanis International, became an official
chapter of International Circle K last week
at a banquet in Tresidder Union.
The program began with a four-course
meal followed by a performance by a bar
bershop quartet. Jay Wren, lieutenant
governor of the San Andreas division of
Circle K, presented the charter to the club
and delivered a speech.
Hal Forbes, president of the Palo Alto
Kiwanis presented the club with the offi
cial pin, certificate and banner. Forbes
spoke about the need of the Kiwanis to
"reach out and help humanity." He stres
sed democracy, good leadership and par
ticipation as important goals for the new
chapter. Forbes closed his speech by wish
ing the club luck and promising that the
Palo Alto Kiwanis would continue to sup
port them.

Kristen Powell, president, gave a brief
history of the club. Some 15 students first
met to form a Circle K chapter here last
September. The group dwindled to about
five members who continued their efforts
to establish an official club.
Powell said their dreams were finally
realized at the banquet and acknowledged
the help of Ralph White, club adviser and
former president of the Palo Alto Kiwanis
Club, and Ray Young, faculty adviser.
Powell introduced the keynote speaker,
Randy Swing, vice president of Circle K
International.
Swing stressed the need for faith in the
face of one's failures and said the impor
tant people are those who try to help. "Ay
Kiwanis, you have the opportunity to try."
Forbes added, "through Circle K you
can do something other than follow; you
can try to reach out, to lead."
Dan Germain, the governor of the
California-Nevada-Hawaii district of Circle

K, gave an example of the way in which the
organization has reached out to help.
When he was president of the club at San
Diego State University he said he heard on
the radio that a girl was fighting a long
illnessand that her parents needed money
to pay her medical bills. His club raised
$1000 in the community through rallies
and telethons.
The meeting was adjourned after Ger
main's speech and a benediction.
The Circle K club currently has 41 clubs
with 640 members in the district. It was
founded in 194b as a sponsored youth pro
ject of Kiwanis Club International, the
third-largest service organization in
America.
Students interested in the Circle K club
should come to the weekly meetings at 7
p.m. Monday evenings in room 132 in Tre
sidder Union, or call Kristen Powell at
329-8953.
