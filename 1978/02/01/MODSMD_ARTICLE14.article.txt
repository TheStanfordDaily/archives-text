# Stanford battles Bruins tomorrow at UCLA
## Cards must reduce errors, says DiBiaso 
### David Georgette 
They have talent at every
position, and not just the five
on the floor. The UCLA Bruins
have so many gifted basketball
players on their team that many
of the guys who are relegated
to a reserve role would be start
ing for most other teams.
But Kiki Vandeweghe, Dar
rell Allums, Chris Lippert and
Brad Holland begin the game
with their sweats on because
first-year head coach Garry
Cunningham has a starting five
that is the best in the Pacific-8.
Those five players have led
the Bruins to a 5-0 record in the
Pac-8 this season and their ac
customed spot atop the league
standings. Overall, UCLA is
14-2 and is ranked fifth by As
sociated Press.
"All their players are tough
to stop," said Stanford coach
Dick Dißiaso, whose 11-7 Car
dinals (1-4 in Pac-8) take on the
Bruins tomorrow night in Los
Angeles.
The toughest Bruin to stop
will probably be 6-foot-9 center
David Greenwood. The junior
is the leading rebounder in
conference play with over 13 a
game, and for the season is av
eraging almost 17 points a
game. "He's playing extremely
well," said Dißiaso. "No team
has been able to shut him off."
Roy Hamilton, a high school
teammate of Greenwood's at
Verbum Dei in Los Angeles, is
the Bruins' driving force in the
backcourt. The 6-2 southpaw
leads the Pac-8 in assists with
over six a game, and when he's
not passing, he's driving or
shooting. Hamilton is fourth in
scoring in the conference,

right behind Greenwood at a
15.9 clip.
But Greenwood and Hamil
ton aren't the only Uclans for
an opponent to be concerned
with. Senior Raymond
Townsend from San Jose, the
other starting guard, has the
conference's best field goal
percentage at 58.4. He's av
eraging 13.6 points a game.
And the other two starters?
Forward James Wilkes has
made over half of his shots,
and center Gig Sims has an av
erage of 5.2 rebounds a game.
So how does a team stop the
Bruins: "Those that have been
most successful, though not
necessarily having won, have
been able to contain the
guards Hamilton and
Townsend," said Dißiaso.
Even if the Cards managed to
contain the Bruins' starters,
there's all that talent on the
UCLA bench to contend with.
"UCLA has more depth than
most people give them credit

for," said Dißiaso.
UCLA is the only team in the
conference averaging over 80
points a ballgame. "Everyone
talks about UCLA's defense,
but we think they execute their
offense as well as anyone in the
country," Dißiaso said.
The Bruins can shred teams
with their fast break, and the
Cards have had difficulty
against some running teams
this season. "We have to re
bound and get back on de
fense," said Dißiaso. That en
tails designating certain people
to crash the boards and others
— like guards Daryle Morgan
or Wolfe Perry — to stay back.
That'll leave the forwards —
Kimberly Belton and either
George Schader or Jay Carter
— to help center Jeff McHugh
on the boards against Green
wood and company. Belton is
Stanford's best rebounderwith
an average of 8.7 a game, with
McHugh and Carter each
grabbing an average of 5.2 a

game.
Belton remains the Cards'
top scorer with a 14.7 average,
sixth best in the Pac-8. The only
other Card averaging in double
figures is McHugh at 11.6.
"To be successful, we'll have
to sharply reduce our mistakes
and turnovers, both mental
and physical," said Dißiaso.
Last year in the Cards' visit to
Pauley Pavilion, they got
turned inside out as the Bruins
rolled to a 114-83 win. But two
years ago in Dißiaso's first visit
there as Stanford coach, the
Cards scared the Bruins before
losing, 68-67.
That's the closest the Cards
have ever come to UCLA in
Pauley Pavilion. They've never
beaten the Bruins there, and
the last Stanford win over
UCLA in Los Angeles came 26
years ago — 73-71 in the UCLA
Men's Gymnasium.
It's doubtful the result to
morrow night will change that
fact.
