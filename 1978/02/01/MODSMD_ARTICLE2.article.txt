# Brings end to legal proceedings
## Stanford employees withdraw from upcoming union election 
### Jon Hornsby 
United Stanford Employees (USE) withdrew yesterday
from the union representation elections scheduled Feb.
2 through 4 at the University Hospital and Clinics.
The election will proceed, according to the Medical
Center News Bureau, but will not involve the 1200 ser
vice, technical and patient care meployees and pharma
cists. They would have voted on whether to select USE as
their exclusive bargaining representative, or no union at
all.
The election will now involve 33 licensed vocational
nurses (LVNs) who will chose as bargaining agents USE,
the California Licensed Vocational Nurses Association
(CLVNA), or neither.
Granted request
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) granted
USE's request to withdraw although decision earlier in
the month by the NLRB Regional Director Michael Taylor
instructed the hospital to proceed with the elections.
Jim Burke, a USE employee, said Taylor's decision did
not provide USE with at least 30 days notice of the elec
tion and therefore violated NLRB rules.
Burke added that the University also failed to deliver
the names of the voters until Jan. 16 — three days late by
NLRB rules. According to the Medical Center News Ser
vice, the NLRB rejected these contentions.
'Blocking charge'
Burke cited a "blocking charge," filed last spring, as
one of the sources of contention in the disagreement.
This charge claimed that a 1976 employee survey con
ducted by the hospital personnel department consti

tuted unfair labor practice.
Anne Schlagenhaft, USE president, said the survey
"tried to ask employees already in the union how they
felt about wages and working conditions."
Burke called it an attempt to substitute for collective
bargaining. He said that the University should have gone
through USE rather than question individual employees.
Ordinary survey
Spyros Andeopoulos, information officer at the Medi
cal Center, said this was an ordinary survey to get input
from employees about general operations.
The NLRB referred the survey charge to Taylor, who
considered postponing the election. But he later de
cided the survey would not have affected the
employees' free choice in the balloting, and declared
the complaint "meritless."
Burke said the survey affected everybody.
"Workers can choose the most propitious time for
elections," he said. "We don't want one where man
agement has had time to campaign."
Ramrodding
"They're just ramrodding the whole thing through,"
said Burke. "We have the right to stop them and to
petition for another election."
USE will have to wait six months before they can peti
tion for another election. Burke said it would take that
long to provide for a fair election.
According to Priscilla Wheeler, associate staff counsel
at the University, the withdrawal by USE "brings an end
to legal proceedings which have been ongoing between
USE and the University since 1975."

the complaint "meritless."
Burke said the survey affected everybody.
"Workers can choose the most propitious time for
elections," he said. "We don't want one where man
agement has had time to campaign."
Ramrodding
"They're just ramrodding the whole thing through,"
said Burke. "We have the right to stop them and to
petition for another election."
USE will have to wait six months before they can peti
tion for another election. Burke said it would take that
long to provide for a fair election.
According to Priscilla Wheeler, associate staff counsel
at the University, the withdrawal by USE "brings an end
to legal proceedings which have been ongoing between
USE and the University since 1975."
United Stanford Employees (USE) withdrew yesterday
from the union representation elections scheduled Feb.
2 through 4 at the University Hospital and Clinics.
The election will proceed, according to the Medical
Center News Bureau, but will not involve the 1200 ser
vice, technical and patient care meployees and pharma
cists. They would have voted on whether to select USE as
their exclusive bargaining representative, or no union at
all.
The election will now involve 33 licensed vocational
nurses (LVNs) who will chose as bargaining agents USE,
the California Licensed Vocational Nurses Association
(CLVNA), or neither.
Granted request
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) granted
USE's request to withdraw although decision earlier in
the month by the NLRB Regional Director Michael Taylor
instructed the hospital to proceed with the elections.
Jim Burke, a USE employee, said Taylor's decision did
not provide USE with at least 30 days notice of the elec
tion and therefore violated NLRB rules.
Burke added that the University also failed to deliver
the names of the voters until Jan. 16 — three days late by
NLRB rules. According to the Medical Center News Ser
vice, the NLRB rejected these contentions.
'Blocking charge'
Burke cited a "blocking charge," filed last spring, as
one of the sources of contention in the disagreement.
This charge claimed that a 1976 employee survey con
ducted by the hospital personnel department consti

tuted unfair labor practice.
Anne Schlagenhaft, USE president, said the survey
"tried to ask employees already in the union how they
felt about wages and working conditions."
Burke called it an attempt to substitute for collective
bargaining. He said that the University should have gone
through USE rather than question individual employees.
Ordinary survey
Spyros Andeopoulos, information officer at the Medi
cal Center, said this was an ordinary survey to get input
from employees about general operations.
The NLRB referred the survey charge to Taylor, who
considered postponing the election. But he later de
cided the survey would not have affected the
employees' free choice in the balloting, and declared
the complaint "meritless."
Burke said the survey affected everybody.
"Workers can choose the most propitious time for
elections," he said. "We don't want one where man
agement has had time to campaign."
Ramrodding
"They're just ramrodding the whole thing through,"
said Burke. "We have the right to stop them and to
