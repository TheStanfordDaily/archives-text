(AP) — George Allen is expected to be named coach of the Los
Angeles Rams at a press conference today, the Los Angeles
Herald-Examiner reported yesterday.
Herald-Examiner sports writer Doug Krikorian quoted a source
high in the Rams organization as saying, "Allen is our man. He's
the coach we feel can get us to the Super Bowl the fastest."
If Rams owner Carroll Rosenbloom does name Allen, it will
return Allen to the National Football League team he coached
from 1966 to 1970. His Los Angeles teams were successful by most
yardsticks — although they failed to win an NFL Championship —
but he was fired by Dan Reeves, the late Rams owner.
Allen, who has a 116-47-5 record during his 12 years as an NFL
head coach, was the Washington Redskins' coach until last
month when he was fired by team owner Edward Bennett Wil
liams following a contract dispute.
Teams coached by Allen, who is 56, have appeared in seven NFL
playoff games.
The Rams job came open when Chuck Knox resigned to be
come head coach of the Buffalo Bills.
