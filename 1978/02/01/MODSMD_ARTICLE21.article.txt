# Ruggers split two against XO's
## 
### Claire Duignan 
Rugby is supposed to be a
game of strength and speed,
finesse and power. But to the
uninitiated, it appears at times
to be more like a supervised
riot. It looks like nothing more
than a street brawl where the
participants show either cour
age or, commonly, suicidal
tendencies.
On Saturday, a melee of this
sort ensued which resulted in
Stanford's top two rugby teams
splitting a pair of games against
the nationally ranked XO's.
As for the game itself, the
observer must learn a few
terms of the game to really
enjoy the sport.
Rugby looks like it was plan
ned by a committee who
couldn't decide whether to
play football or soccer, so they
ended up playing both at once.
Some of the common terms

used in rugby are:
LINE OUTS —A ball thrown
from out-of-bounds in bet
ween the two teams which are
lined up facing each other.
SCRUM — Eight players from
each team butt and push
against each other in a group
and can only use their feet to
free the ball, which rests on the
ground between them.
LOOSE RUCK OR MALL —
)ust what it sounds like; two
scrums "mauling" each other
over the ball.
SPINNING IT OUT — The
backfield, which consists of six
men, passes the ball along the
backline.
POP KICK — A player kicks
the ball over the opponents'
heads and tries to retrieve it.
The Stanford Rugby team
plays every Saturday after
noon. Next Saturday, they take
on a strong San Francisco team
at Maloney Field.
