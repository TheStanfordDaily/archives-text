Card baseball opens
The Stanford baseball team
will make its season premiere
this afternoon in a 2:30 p.m.
game against the University of
San Francisco Dons at Sunken
Diamond.
The Cards finished with a
43-23 overall record last year,
but finished tied for third in the
Pacific-B's Southern Division
with a 5-13 record.
Other than the pitchers, the
Cards have all the starters for
the bulk of last year returning.
"My biggest concern at this
point is our pitching staff," said
coach Mark Marquess. "Be
cause of the rain this winter,
the pitchers are not at the stage
they should be at this time of
year."
