Chavez halts wine boycott
Los Angeles — An organized boycott that
kept some California wine off the liberal
cocktail party circuit for more than four
years and drew support from politicians and
trade unionists was called to a halt yesterday
by Cesar Chavez.
The leader of the United Farm Workers
Union said boycotts against California's let
tuce, table-grape and wine industries were
no longer necessary.
Chavez said he was stopping the boycotts
because of the effectiveness of a state law
enacted in 1975 that provides for secret bal
lot elections on whether farm workers want
a union to represent them.
More than 550 such elections have been
held. Chavez' union holds contracts with 117
growers and is negotiating with 100 more
following victories in certification elections.
Chavez' announcement at his headquar
ters in Keene, 120 miles north of Los
Angeles, capped the second round of prot
racted and often bitter boycotts headed by
the charismatic union leader. Most of the
boycotts ended with achievement of the an
nounced goals of the UFW, formed by
Chavez to improve working conditions for
migrant laborers.
Redwood Park to expand
Washington — The Senate, heeding a call
to protect the majestic redwood trees,
voted, 74-20, yesterday to expand the Red
woods National Park in Northern California
from 28,000 acres to 76,000 acres.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), the bill's
sponsor, appealed for passage on the
grounds that the redwoods were part of the
nation's heritage — "part of our tap roots to
eternity."
Three of four amendments proposed by
Sen. S.I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.), designed to
reduce the effect of expansion, were de
feated.
In opposing park expansion, Hayakawa
said some of the best timber in the country
would be lost for cutting and as many as 2000

jobs could be affected. He added that the
expansion would amount to "an enormous
land grab" by the federal government.
The Senate bill also provides for the In
terior Department to take over another
30,000 acres south of the park if physical
damage there affects the park itself.
Cranston and others said the park's pre
sent 28,000 acres were threatened by ero
sion because of continued logging on land
adjacent to the park.
Rough Mideast talks forseen
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat
warned yesterday that despite the resump
tion of Egyptian-Israeli military talks, "every
thing will collapse" unless the two nations
agree on self-determination for the Palesti
nians living in the occupied lands.
The Egyptian leader predicted that future
negotiations would be a "heavy and difficult
job." He urged the Carter administration to
take "a clear position" on the Mideast.
Sadat made his remarks to reporters a few
hours before the resumption of joint military
talks focusing on an Israeli pullback from the
Sinai Peninsula. They are the first direct
negotiations between Egypt and Israel since
Sadat broke off political talks in Jerusalem
|an. 18.
Earlier in the day, hopes for another
Mideast breakthrough grew dim when Egyp
tian Foreign Minister Mohamed Ibrahim
Kamel refused to accept an Israeli-American
draft declaration of principles on the
Mideast.
"There are many points on which we don't
see eye to eye," Kamel said after meeting
with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Alfred
Atherton, who worked out the draft with
Israeli leaders last week.
Blacks reject Rhodesia offer
Rabat, Malta — Black guerrilla leaders said
yesterday they want to share power with Bri
tain during Rhodesia's transition to black
majority rule and rejected a proposal for a

British commissioner to head an interim
government. They claimed he would have
dictatorial powers.
Meanwhile, in Salisbury, moderate black
leaders agreed to resume informal talks with
the white government today on the
framework for a one-man, one-vote con
stitution.
Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo, co
leaders of the Patriotic Front, said at the
Malta meeting that they opposed the
British-American plan tor Field Marshal Lord
Carver to head an interim government from
the day Prime Minister lan Smith leaves of
fice until Rhodesia is legally recognized as
being an independent state by Britain.
Rhodesia unilaterally declared its inde
pendence from Britain in 1965.
But Mugabe and Nkomo appeared to
move toward the Anglo-American position
on the issue of holding country-wide elec
tions before — not after — Rhodesia is
granted full legal independence by Britain.
Nuclear fragments located
Edmonton, Alberla — A Canadian nuclear
response team headed for Canada's Great
Slave Lake yesterday to recover from the ice
two tiny, potentially hazardous pieces of a
nuclear-powered Soviet spy satellite located
electronically.
Canadian Atomic Energy Control Board
spokesman Roger Eaton told a news confer
ence earlier the two fragments were giving
off radiation that could be dangerous to liv
ing beings exposed at close range for a
number of hours.
The latest fragments from the satellite,
which fell from orbit Jan. 24, were located
near the Reliance weather station on the
northeast end of the frigid lake about 240
miles east of Yellowknife, capital of the
Northwest Territories.
On Saturday two members of a group re
tracing a 1927 explorer's route found the first
satellite debris at Warden's Grove, a remote
Arctic weather outpost 150 miles northeast
of Reliance.

Stronger economy predicted
Washington — The government index
used to calculate future economic trends in
creased by a substantial 0.7 per cent in De
cember, and that may mean the economy
will be stronger in the coming months, fed
eral officials said yesterday.
The so-called composite index of leading
indicators, the final important economic
statistic left over from 1977, had advanced
0.1 per cent in November. And December's
rise supports the Carter administration's
predictions that the economy will continue
to expand at least through mid-1978.
The index attempts to assess the outlook
for the economy on the basis of the perfor
mance o various economic trends in the
previous months.
"This month's index happens to be quite
consistent with our view of the economy,
which is for continued pretty healthy

Sacco-Vanzetti questions
Cambridge, Mass. — Documents from the
final days of the Sa r co-Vanzetti case — un
veiled yesterday after 50 years — pose new
questions about the haste and certainty with
which a Harvard president and two other
men helped send two anarchists to the elec
tric chair.
Historians are divided on whether Nicola
Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were proven
guilty.
Two questions arise from ambiguously
dated drafts of an 11th-hour report to then-
Gov. Alvan Fuller and from a phrase appear
ing in an early draft of the report but not in
the final report.
The ambiguous dates could indicate the
authors wrote their conclusions before hear
ing out the defense.
The phrase could indicate they were less
certain about Vanzetti's guilt than about
Sacco's.
Sacco and Vanzetti were executed Aug.

23,1927, for a payroll robbery and two mur
ders in South Braintree in 1920. They main
tained their innocence to the end, claiming
they were persecuted because they were
Italian-born anarchists. Their case became a
"cause celebre" to radicals around the
world.
Dow Jones down 2.52
New York — U.S. Steel shares fell sharply
on a dividend cut and an adverse earnings
report, but the rest of the stock market held
steady in a relatively quiet session yesterday.
The Dow )ones average of 30 industrials
posted a 2.52 loss to 769.92.
The average would have shown a .17 gain,
however, had it not been for the slide in U.S.

Chavez halts wine boycott
Los Angeles — An organized boycott that
kept some California wine off the liberal
cocktail party circuit for more than four
years and drew support from politicians and
trade unionists was called to a halt yesterday
by Cesar Chavez.
The leader of the United Farm Workers
Union said boycotts against California's let
tuce, table-grape and wine industries were
no longer necessary.
Chavez said he was stopping the boycotts
because of the effectiveness of a state law
enacted in 1975 that provides for secret bal
lot elections on whether farm workers want
a union to represent them.
More than 550 such elections have been
held. Chavez' union holds contracts with 117
growers and is negotiating with 100 more
following victories in certification elections.
Chavez' announcement at his headquar
ters in Keene, 120 miles north of Los
Angeles, capped the second round of prot

the charismatic union leader. Most of the
boycotts ended with achievement of the an

Redwood Park to expand
Washington — The Senate, heeding a call
to protect the majestic redwood trees,
voted, 74-20, yesterday to expand the Red
woods National Park in Northern California
from 28,000 acres to 76,000 acres.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), the bill's
sponsor, appealed for passage on the
grounds that the redwoods were part of the
nation's heritage — "part of our tap roots to
eternity."
Three of four amendments proposed by
Sen. S.I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.), designed to
reduce the effect of expansion, were de
feated.
In opposing park expansion, Hayakawa
said some of the best timber in the country
would be lost for cutting and as many as 2000

jobs could be affected. He added that the
expansion would amount to "an enormous
land grab" by the federal government.
The Senate bill also provides for the In
terior Department to take over another
30,000 acres south of the park if physical
damage there affects the park itself.
Cranston and others said the park's pre
sent 28,000 acres were threatened by ero
sion because of continued logging on land
adjacent to the park.
Rough Mideast talks forseen
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat
warned yesterday that despite the resump

thing will collapse" unless the two nations
agree on self-determination for the Palesti
nians living in the occupied lands.
The Egyptian leader predicted that future
negotiations would be a "heavy and difficult
job." He urged the Carter administration to
take "a clear position" on the Mideast.
Sadat made his remarks to reporters a few
hours before the resumption of joint military
talks focusing on an Israeli pullback from the
Sinai Peninsula. They are the first direct
negotiations between Egypt and Israel since
Sadat broke off political talks in Jerusalem
|an. 18.
Earlier in the day, hopes for another
Mideast breakthrough grew dim when Egyp
tian Foreign Minister Mohamed Ibrahim
Kamel refused to accept an Israeli-American
draft declaration of principles on the
Mideast.
"There are many points on which we don't
see eye to eye," Kamel said after meeting
with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Alfred
Atherton, who worked out the draft with
Israeli leaders last week.
Blacks reject Rhodesia offer
Rabat, Malta — Black guerrilla leaders said
yesterday they want to share power with Bri

majority rule and rejected a proposal for a

British commissioner to head an interim
government. They claimed he would have
dictatorial powers.
Meanwhile, in Salisbury, moderate black
leaders agreed to resume informal talks with
the white government today on the
framework for a one-man, one-vote con
stitution.
Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo, co
leaders of the Patriotic Front, said at the
Malta meeting that they opposed the
British-American plan tor Field Marshal Lord
Carver to head an interim government from
the day Prime Minister lan Smith leaves of
fice until Rhodesia is legally recognized as
being an independent state by Britain.
Rhodesia unilaterally declared its inde

But Mugabe and Nkomo appeared to
move toward the Anglo-American position
on the issue of holding country-wide elec

Nuclear fragments located
Edmonton, Alberla — A Canadian nuclear
response team headed for Canada's Great
Slave Lake yesterday to recover from the ice
two tiny, potentially hazardous pieces of a
nuclear-powered Soviet spy satellite located
electronically.
Canadian Atomic Energy Control Board
spokesman Roger Eaton told a news confer
ence earlier the two fragments were giving
off radiation that could be dangerous to liv
ing beings exposed at close range for a
number of hours.
The latest fragments from the satellite,
which fell from orbit Jan. 24, were located
near the Reliance weather station on the
northeast end of the frigid lake about 240
miles east of Yellowknife, capital of the
Northwest Territories.
On Saturday two members of a group re
tracing a 1927 explorer's route found the first
satellite debris at Warden's Grove, a remote
Arctic weather outpost 150 miles northeast
of Reliance.

Stronger economy predicted
Washington — The government index
used to calculate future economic trends in
creased by a substantial 0.7 per cent in De
cember, and that may mean the economy
will be stronger in the coming months, fed
eral officials said yesterday.
The so-called composite index of leading
indicators, the final important economic
statistic left over from 1977, had advanced
0.1 per cent in November. And December's
rise supports the Carter administration's
predictions that the economy will continue
to expand at least through mid-1978.
The index attempts to assess the outlook
for the economy on the basis of the perfor
mance o various economic trends in the
previous months.
"This month's index happens to be quite
consistent with our view of the economy,
which is for continued pretty healthy
growth,'' said Courtenay Slater, chief
economist for the Commerce Department,
which released the index report.
Sacco-Vanzetti questions
Cambridge, Mass. — Documents from the
final days of the Sa r co-Vanzetti case — un
veiled yesterday after 50 years — pose new
questions about the haste and certainty with
which a Harvard president and two other
men helped send two anarchists to the elec
tric chair.
Historians are divided on whether Nicola
Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were proven
guilty.
Two questions arise from ambiguously
dated drafts of an 11th-hour report to then-
Gov. Alvan Fuller and from a phrase appear

Sacco-Vanzetti questions
Cambridge, Mass. — Documents from the
final days of the Sa r co-Vanzetti case — un
veiled yesterday after 50 years — pose new
questions about the haste and certainty with
which a Harvard president and two other
men helped send two anarchists to the elec
tric chair.
Historians are divided on whether Nicola
Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were proven
guilty.
Two questions arise from ambiguously
dated drafts of an 11th-hour report to then-
Gov. Alvan Fuller and from a phrase appear
ing in an early draft of the report but not in
the final report.
The ambiguous dates could indicate the
authors wrote their conclusions before hear
ing out the defense.
The phrase could indicate they were less
certain about Vanzetti's guilt than about
Sacco's.
Sacco and Vanzetti were executed Aug.

23,1927, for a payroll robbery and two mur
ders in South Braintree in 1920. They main
tained their innocence to the end, claiming
they were persecuted because they were
Italian-born anarchists. Their case became a
"cause celebre" to radicals around the
world.

Chavez halts wine boycott
Los Angeles — An organized boycott that
kept some California wine off the liberal
cocktail party circuit for more than four
years and drew support from politicians and
trade unionists was called to a halt yesterday
by Cesar Chavez.
The leader of the United Farm Workers
Union said boycotts against California's let
tuce, table-grape and wine industries were
no longer necessary.
Chavez said he was stopping the boycotts
because of the effectiveness of a state law
enacted in 1975 that provides for secret bal
lot elections on whether farm workers want
a union to represent them.
More than 550 such elections have been
held. Chavez' union holds contracts with 117
growers and is negotiating with 100 more
following victories in certification elections.
Chavez' announcement at his headquar
ters in Keene, 120 miles north of Los
Angeles, capped the second round of prot

the charismatic union leader. Most of the
boycotts ended with achievement of the an

Redwood Park to expand
Washington — The Senate, heeding a call
to protect the majestic redwood trees,
voted, 74-20, yesterday to expand the Red
woods National Park in Northern California
from 28,000 acres to 76,000 acres.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), the bill's
sponsor, appealed for passage on the
grounds that the redwoods were part of the
nation's heritage — "part of our tap roots to
eternity."
Three of four amendments proposed by
Sen. S.I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.), designed to
reduce the effect of expansion, were de
feated.
In opposing park expansion, Hayakawa
said some of the best timber in the country
would be lost for cutting and as many as 2000

jobs could be affected. He added that the
expansion would amount to "an enormous
land grab" by the federal government.
The Senate bill also provides for the In
terior Department to take over another
30,000 acres south of the park if physical
damage there affects the park itself.
Cranston and others said the park's pre
sent 28,000 acres were threatened by ero
sion because of continued logging on land
adjacent to the park.
Rough Mideast talks forseen
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat
warned yesterday that despite the resump

thing will collapse" unless the two nations
agree on self-determination for the Palesti
nians living in the occupied lands.
The Egyptian leader predicted that future
negotiations would be a "heavy and difficult
job." He urged the Carter administration to
take "a clear position" on the Mideast.
Sadat made his remarks to reporters a few
hours before the resumption of joint military
talks focusing on an Israeli pullback from the
Sinai Peninsula. They are the first direct
negotiations between Egypt and Israel since
Sadat broke off political talks in Jerusalem
|an. 18.
Earlier in the day, hopes for another
Mideast breakthrough grew dim when Egyp
tian Foreign Minister Mohamed Ibrahim
Kamel refused to accept an Israeli-American
draft declaration of principles on the
Mideast.
"There are many points on which we don't
see eye to eye," Kamel said after meeting
with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Alfred
Atherton, who worked out the draft with
Israeli leaders last week.
Blacks reject Rhodesia offer
Rabat, Malta — Black guerrilla leaders said
yesterday they want to share power with Bri
tain during Rhodesia's transition to black
majority rule and rejected a proposal for a

British commissioner to head an interim
government. They claimed he would have
dictatorial powers.
Meanwhile, in Salisbury, moderate black
leaders agreed to resume informal talks with
the white government today on the
framework for a one-man, one-vote con
stitution.
Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo, co
leaders of the Patriotic Front, said at the
Malta meeting that they opposed the
British-American plan tor Field Marshal Lord
Carver to head an interim government from
the day Prime Minister lan Smith leaves of
fice until Rhodesia is legally recognized as
being an independent state by Britain.
Rhodesia unilaterally declared its inde
pendence from Britain in 1965.
But Mugabe and Nkomo appeared to
move toward the Anglo-American position
on the issue of holding country-wide elec
tions before — not after — Rhodesia is
granted full legal independence by Britain.
Nuclear fragments located
Edmonton, Alberla — A Canadian nuclear
response team headed for Canada's Great
Slave Lake yesterday to recover from the ice
two tiny, potentially hazardous pieces of a
nuclear-powered Soviet spy satellite located
electronically.
Canadian Atomic Energy Control Board
spokesman Roger Eaton told a news confer
ence earlier the two fragments were giving
off radiation that could be dangerous to liv
ing beings exposed at close range for a
number of hours.
The latest fragments from the satellite,
which fell from orbit Jan. 24, were located
near the Reliance weather station on the
northeast end of the frigid lake about 240
miles east of Yellowknife, capital of the
Northwest Territories.
On Saturday two members of a group re
tracing a 1927 explorer's route found the first
satellite debris at Warden's Grove, a remote
Arctic weather outpost 150 miles northeast
of Reliance.

Malta meeting that they opposed the
British-American plan tor Field Marshal Lord
Carver to head an interim government from
the day Prime Minister lan Smith leaves of
fice until Rhodesia is legally recognized as
being an independent state by Britain.
Rhodesia unilaterally declared its inde
pendence from Britain in 1965.
But Mugabe and Nkomo appeared to
move toward the Anglo-American position
on the issue of holding country-wide elec

granted full legal independence by Britain.
Nuclear fragments located
Edmonton, Alberla — A Canadian nuclear
response team headed for Canada's Great
Slave Lake yesterday to recover from the ice
two tiny, potentially hazardous pieces of a
nuclear-powered Soviet spy satellite located
electronically.
Canadian Atomic Energy Control Board
spokesman Roger Eaton told a news confer
ence earlier the two fragments were giving
off radiation that could be dangerous to liv
ing beings exposed at close range for a
number of hours.
The latest fragments from the satellite,
which fell from orbit Jan. 24, were located
near the Reliance weather station on the
northeast end of the frigid lake about 240
miles east of Yellowknife, capital of the
Northwest Territories.
On Saturday two members of a group re
tracing a 1927 explorer's route found the first
satellite debris at Warden's Grove, a remote
Arctic weather outpost 150 miles northeast
of Reliance.

Stronger economy predicted
Washington — The government index
used to calculate future economic trends in
creased by a substantial 0.7 per cent in De
cember, and that may mean the economy
will be stronger in the coming months, fed
eral officials said yesterday.
The so-called composite index of leading
indicators, the final important economic
statistic left over from 1977, had advanced
0.1 per cent in November. And December's
rise supports the Carter administration's
predictions that the economy will continue
to expand at least through mid-1978.
The index attempts to assess the outlook
for the economy on the basis of the perfor
mance o various economic trends in the
previous months.
"This month's index happens to be quite
consistent with our view of the economy,
which is for continued pretty healthy
growth,'' said Courtenay Slater, chief
economist for the Commerce Department,
which released the index report.
Sacco-Vanzetti questions
Cambridge, Mass. — Documents from the
final days of the Sa r co-Vanzetti case — un
veiled yesterday after 50 years — pose new
questions about the haste and certainty with
which a Harvard president and two other
men helped send two anarchists to the elec
tric chair.
Historians are divided on whether Nicola
Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were proven
guilty.
Two questions arise from ambiguously
dated drafts of an 11th-hour report to then-
Gov. Alvan Fuller and from a phrase appear
ing in an early draft of the report but not in
the final report.
The ambiguous dates could indicate the
authors wrote their conclusions before hear
ing out the defense.
The phrase could indicate they were less
certain about Vanzetti's guilt than about
Sacco's.
Sacco and Vanzetti were executed Aug.

23,1927, for a payroll robbery and two mur
ders in South Braintree in 1920. They main
tained their innocence to the end, claiming
they were persecuted because they were
Italian-born anarchists. Their case became a
"cause celebre" to radicals around the
world.
Dow Jones down 2.52
New York — U.S. Steel shares fell sharply
on a dividend cut and an adverse earnings
report, but the rest of the stock market held
steady in a relatively quiet session yesterday.
The Dow )ones average of 30 industrials
posted a 2.52 loss to 769.92.
The average would have shown a .17 gain,
however, had it not been for the slide in U.S.
Steel, which was down 3% at 28Vi as of the 4
p.m. close of the New York Stock Fxchange.

Chavez halts wine boycott
Los Angeles — An organized boycott that
kept some California wine off the liberal
cocktail party circuit for more than four
years and drew support from politicians and
trade unionists was called to a halt yesterday
by Cesar Chavez.
The leader of the United Farm Workers
Union said boycotts against California's let
tuce, table-grape and wine industries were
no longer necessary.
Chavez said he was stopping the boycotts
because of the effectiveness of a state law
enacted in 1975 that provides for secret bal
lot elections on whether farm workers want
a union to represent them.
More than 550 such elections have been
held. Chavez' union holds contracts with 117
growers and is negotiating with 100 more
following victories in certification elections.
Chavez' announcement at his headquar
ters in Keene, 120 miles north of Los
Angeles, capped the second round of prot
racted and often bitter boycotts headed by
the charismatic union leader. Most of the
boycotts ended with achievement of the an
nounced goals of the UFW, formed by
Chavez to improve working conditions for
migrant laborers.
Redwood Park to expand
Washington — The Senate, heeding a call
to protect the majestic redwood trees,
voted, 74-20, yesterday to expand the Red
woods National Park in Northern California
from 28,000 acres to 76,000 acres.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), the bill's
sponsor, appealed for passage on the
grounds that the redwoods were part of the
nation's heritage — "part of our tap roots to
eternity."
Three of four amendments proposed by
Sen. S.I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.), designed to
reduce the effect of expansion, were de
feated.
In opposing park expansion, Hayakawa
said some of the best timber in the country
would be lost for cutting and as many as 2000

jobs could be affected. He added that the
expansion would amount to "an enormous
land grab" by the federal government.
The Senate bill also provides for the In
terior Department to take over another
30,000 acres south of the park if physical
damage there affects the park itself.
Cranston and others said the park's pre
sent 28,000 acres were threatened by ero
sion because of continued logging on land
adjacent to the park.
Rough Mideast talks forseen
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat
warned yesterday that despite the resump
tion of Egyptian-Israeli military talks, "every
thing will collapse" unless the two nations
agree on self-determination for the Palesti
nians living in the occupied lands.
The Egyptian leader predicted that future
negotiations would be a "heavy and difficult
job." He urged the Carter administration to
take "a clear position" on the Mideast.
Sadat made his remarks to reporters a few
hours before the resumption of joint military
talks focusing on an Israeli pullback from the
Sinai Peninsula. They are the first direct
negotiations between Egypt and Israel since
Sadat broke off political talks in Jerusalem
|an. 18.
Earlier in the day, hopes for another
Mideast breakthrough grew dim when Egyp
tian Foreign Minister Mohamed Ibrahim
Kamel refused to accept an Israeli-American
draft declaration of principles on the
Mideast.
"There are many points on which we don't
see eye to eye," Kamel said after meeting
with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Alfred
Atherton, who worked out the draft with
Israeli leaders last week.
Blacks reject Rhodesia offer
Rabat, Malta — Black guerrilla leaders said
yesterday they want to share power with Bri
tain during Rhodesia's transition to black
majority rule and rejected a proposal for a

British commissioner to head an interim
government. They claimed he would have
dictatorial powers.
Meanwhile, in Salisbury, moderate black
leaders agreed to resume informal talks with
the white government today on the
framework for a one-man, one-vote con
stitution.
Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo, co
leaders of the Patriotic Front, said at the
Malta meeting that they opposed the
British-American plan tor Field Marshal Lord
Carver to head an interim government from
the day Prime Minister lan Smith leaves of
fice until Rhodesia is legally recognized as
