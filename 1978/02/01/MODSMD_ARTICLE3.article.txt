## Twelve students to meet for CIR appointments 
### Emily Sachar 
Twelve students have agreed to
meet to appoint three members to
the Committee on Investment Re
sponsibilities (CIR), lames Lyons,
dean of student affairs, announced
yesterday.
However, Lyons said the names of
thel2 volunteers will not be released
until after they meet. He did not say
when that initial meeting would oc
cur.
"If this process is to remain inde
pendent from the pressures which
have been mounting in regard to this
issue, we must keep the names of the
students silent," Lyons said.

The Office of Student Affairs ran
domly contacted by telephone 27
University students until 12 persons
agreed to participate in the appoint
ment procedure, Lyons said.
The ASSU Senate and Nominations
Committee in December refused to
appoint the three CIR members in
protest of modifications made by the
Board of Trustees of the ad hoc
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility.
15 decline
The 15 students who declined to
participate in the appointment pro
cess did so because they weren 't able
to attend meetings, were not in
terested or were on medical leave,
said Lyons.
"One other person wouldn't par
ticipate out of agreement with the
ASSU position on the subject,"
Lyons said.
Steven Westley and other student
leaders said they had hoped to meet
privately with President Richard
Lyman to discuss recent develop
ments and "to keep the lines of
communication open for dialogue
concerning the issue," according to
Westley, COP co-president and
chairman of the ASSU Committee on
Nominations.
"We were under the impression
that we would have a personal meet
ing with Lyons Thursday," Westley
said. "Now I've found out that other
administrators will be there as well.
We really wanted to avoid that. Meet
ings before haven't done much,
probably because of personal prob
lems dealing with certain adminis
trators."
Lyman feels that the best way of
keeping dialogue going, however, is
for students to meet with more than
one administrator, lean Fetter, assis
tant to the president, said.

"The students have said them
selves .that they want to keep
dialogue going. The president is wil
ling to discuss any issues regarding
CIR if he knows of them prior to the
meeting," Fetter said.
Although no agenda has been pre
pared for the Thursday meeting of
student leaders and University ad
ministrators, Westley said he hopes
new options to the problems will be
discussed.
"I am hoping that Lyman, through
his own expertise and knowledge in
handling matters such as these, can
present some positive suggestions
rather than giving a close-minded
picture from the start," Westley said.
Students wrong
Lyman said in a )an. 30 letter to
Westley that students are wrong in
believing that trustees will "come to
see a public forum as a productive
way of formulating policy."
"There are a number of reasons
why this is not so, including, of
course, their (the Board's) reliance
on the many regular and systematic
ways in which student views now
reach the Board," Lyman stated in
the letter.
He also suggested the ASSU dis
cuss voting student representation
on Board committees and other ways
student opinions are brought before
the board.
Westley said he hopes small, but
symbolic changes can be made to
improve the status of the CIR docu
ment.
"We also must discuss the con
stitutionality of the president over
riding the ASSU Constitution which
he himself actually certified. It strikes
me as ironic that when we really op
pose the University they go right
over our head,even though they say
we have the control," Westley said.
