## 
### Randy Keith 
A former Stanford student who was involved in
the anti-war movement during the 19605, and a
State Department employee, were arrested by the
FBI yesterday in Washington, D.C. on charges of
spying tor the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.
Truong Dinh Hung and Ronald Humphrey have
been accused in a seven-count federal grand jury
indictment of stealing and transmitting "docu
ments, writings, notes and information relating to
the national defense of the United States . . . hav
ing reason to believe that same would be used to
the advantage of a foreign nation."
Hung graduated in 1968 with a bachelor's de
gree in political science and has been working for
the Animal Health Institute in Washington. Hum
phrey works for the State Department's United
States Information Agency (USIA) and served from
1969 to 1971 in Saigon.
Five other Vietnamese were named as co
conspirators in what the justice Department said
was a scheme to give classified documents to the
Vietnamese government through a contact in
Paris.
The Justice Department said Humphrey appa
rently used his position at the USIA to obtain sec

ret material which he then supposedly passed to
Hung. Hung is charged with passing it along to the
Paris contact.
The justice Department refused to say what was
included in the material the two men allegedly
gave to the Vietnamese.
Confession
A federal prosecutor told the arraignment judge
in Alexandria, Va., that Humphrey had "confessed
to the crime for which he was arrested," but Hum
phrey told reporters as he arrived for the proceed
ings, "I am not a spy, and I did not know he (Hung)
was a spy."
The prosecutor also said the government has a
confidential informant who will supply details of
the espionage arrangement described in the in
dictment.
Hung, who came to America in 1964 but who just
recently applied for permanent U.S. resident
status, is the son of Vietnamese politician Truong
Dinh Dzu.
Dzu was known as the leader of the South Viet
namese peace platform in the 1967 election which
he narrowly lost to Nguyen Van Thieu.
Dzu was offered the post of prime minister but
refused it when Thieu would not accept his six

point peace plan. The plan contained many of the
conditions the U.S. and North Vietnam finally ag
reed to in the Paris peace talks.
Thieu eventually placed Hung's father under
house arrest, claiming he urged a North-South
coalition government.
Requested help
Hung first became associated with the Stanford
anti-war movement when he requested help in
writing a group of letters to the State Department.
The letters asked that the State Department pres
sure Thieu to release Dzu, according to Hung's
political science advisor Charles Drekmeir.
Drekmeir said Hung was important to the
movement because he "brought kinds of informa
tion to the group which we wouldn't have gotten
otherwise."
"He was a good source of information and never
misled us," Drekmeir said.
Hung spoke throughout the U.S. on his father's
behalf and finally asked for political asylum in April
1969.
Hung and Humphrey are being held in lieu of
$250,000 bond. The espionage charge carries a
maximum sentence of life in prison.

"He was a good source of information and never
misled us," Drekmeir said.
Hung spoke throughout the U.S. on his father's
behalf and finally asked for political asylum in April
1969.
Hung and Humphrey are being held in lieu of
$250,000 bond. The espionage charge carries a
maximum sentence of life in prison.
A former Stanford student who was involved in
the anti-war movement during the 19605, and a
State Department employee, were arrested by the
FBI yesterday in Washington, D.C. on charges of
spying tor the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.
Truong Dinh Hung and Ronald Humphrey have
been accused in a seven-count federal grand jury
indictment of stealing and transmitting "docu
ments, writings, notes and information relating to
the national defense of the United States . . . hav
ing reason to believe that same would be used to
the advantage of a foreign nation."
Hung graduated in 1968 with a bachelor's de
gree in political science and has been working for
the Animal Health Institute in Washington. Hum
phrey works for the State Department's United
States Information Agency (USIA) and served from
1969 to 1971 in Saigon.
Five other Vietnamese were named as co
conspirators in what the justice Department said
was a scheme to give classified documents to the
Vietnamese government through a contact in
Paris.
The Justice Department said Humphrey appa
rently used his position at the USIA to obtain sec

ret material which he then supposedly passed to
Hung. Hung is charged with passing it along to the
Paris contact.
The justice Department refused to say what was
included in the material the two men allegedly
gave to the Vietnamese.
Confession
A federal prosecutor told the arraignment judge
in Alexandria, Va., that Humphrey had "confessed
to the crime for which he was arrested," but Hum
phrey told reporters as he arrived for the proceed
ings, "I am not a spy, and I did not know he (Hung)
was a spy."
The prosecutor also said the government has a
confidential informant who will supply details of
the espionage arrangement described in the in
dictment.
Hung, who came to America in 1964 but who just
recently applied for permanent U.S. resident
status, is the son of Vietnamese politician Truong
Dinh Dzu.
Dzu was known as the leader of the South Viet
namese peace platform in the 1967 election which
he narrowly lost to Nguyen Van Thieu.
Dzu was offered the post of prime minister but
refused it when Thieu would not accept his six

point peace plan. The plan contained many of the
conditions the U.S. and North Vietnam finally ag
reed to in the Paris peace talks.
Thieu eventually placed Hung's father under
house arrest, claiming he urged a North-South
coalition government.
Requested help
Hung first became associated with the Stanford
anti-war movement when he requested help in
writing a group of letters to the State Department.
The letters asked that the State Department pres
sure Thieu to release Dzu, according to Hung's
political science advisor Charles Drekmeir.
Drekmeir said Hung was important to the
movement because he "brought kinds of informa
tion to the group which we wouldn't have gotten
otherwise."
"He was a good source of information and never
misled us," Drekmeir said.
