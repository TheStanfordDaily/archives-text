# CUS to recommend dropping existing humanities sequences
## 
### Peter Brett 
The Committee on Under
graduate Studies (C-US) will re
commend to the Faculty Senate
the abolishment of the
Humanities distribution require
ment sequence, said Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies Herant
Katchadourian during last night's
KZSU Campus Conference.
"The sequence aspect was first

made part of the requirement . . .
to create more coherence in the
fulfillment of the requirement,"
said Katchadourian. "But in fact
what has happened is that a very
large number of sequences has
been offered every year. This be
wildering variety of choices
makes the original intent of the
requirement virtually meaning
less."
The dean's office recently asked
C-US to consider dropping the
sequence aspect of the
Humanities requirement, and in
stead to have each department
offer the sequences as guidelines,
not as requirements, according to
Katchadourian.
"Once the matter gets settled,"
said Katchadourian, "we will
probably turn to an alternative to
the present situation — to restrict
the number of sequences that de
partments can offer.
"Hopefully a faculty body, with
people who know something
about the field, will be able to
look into the content of these
courses and make some intelli
gent judgements as to whether
these sequences make sense or
not beyond the department sim
ply saying so," said Katchadou

rian.
The next and most important
issue to face the Western culture
task force and the office of Un
dergraduate Studies, istocompile
results of the Western Culture
Requirement survey which was
sent to every undergraduate fa
culty member, according to
Katchadourian.
"One of the key determinants
as to what kind of course we will
have has to do with what kind of
courses the faculty are going to
want to teach. So we need to
know what the existing faculty
thinks about it," Katchadourian
said.
"The money question is impor
tant, but we should not make too
much of it. On the other hand one
can't minimize the importance of
money, because it's (implement
ing the requirement) going to cost
a gre«t deal. The figures range
upwards from half a million dol
lars," said Katchadourian.
Although last year's seniors
rated the freshman advising sys
tem as very poor (9 per cent excel
lent, 46 per cent poor), Katch
adourian said, "We have reason
to think that things are bt-tter now
than they were four years ago."
