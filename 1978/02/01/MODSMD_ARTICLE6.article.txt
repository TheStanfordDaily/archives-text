# Ruthless murders
## Vietnamese 'liberation' 
###

As we approach the third anniver
sary of the fall of Vietnam and Cam
bodia to a combination of indigen
ous guerrillas and exogenous com
munist imperialists, it would do well
to look and see what benefits have
accrued from "liberation."
Vietnam and Cambodia again find
themselves at war, as centuries of
rivalry and mistrust, dampened dur
ing U.S. involvement, have flared up.
Vietnam, apparently frustrated by
the barbaric and intrasigent Cambo
dians, with their numerous border
attacks, invaded the infamous Par
rot's Beak and other border areas.
Thousands have already died in the
struggle, and the end does not ap
pear to be near.
Cambodia has clearly suffered the
most from "liberation." Though the
Cambodian people suffered under
the inefficient and ineffectively au
thoritarian Lon Nol regime, the fac
tionalized and xenophobic bandits
who took control in April, 1975, have
effectively declared war on their own
people.
Thousands of Cambodians have
fled to Thailand and Vietnam, de
spite the threat of ambush and
slaughter by the Khmer Rouge.
Cambodians who escape and then
decide to return also face death; the
price of leaving this paradise is high.
The Khmer Rouge have also sys
tematically murdered thousands of
loyalists of the Lon Nol regime. Milit
ary and government personnel,
along with their families, have been
executed; even enlisted men, and
petty officials like clerks and
teachers, have died — many from
beatings by shovels and clubs. The
new Cambodian regime has not de
nied these facts; rather, it has simply
noted, "We deal harshly with our
enemies."
Border war
The Cambodians have waged a
ferocious border war with Thailand
as well as Vietnam. Hundreds of vil
lagers, along with soldiers, have
been killed, and thousands more
have been forced to evacuate their
homes in the face of constant Cam
bodian border attacks.
After one particularly brutal
episode, when men, women and
children were murdered (no sexists,
these Khmer Rouge), the Cambo
dians explained that it was all a sim
ple misunderstanding: actually the
villages were in Cambodian territory,
and the Khmer Rouge regime was
simply "arranging its internal af
fairs."
Early on after the takeover by the
Khmer Rouge, three to four million
people were forced out of the cities.
The young, the old, the sick and the
wounded — hospitalized or not —

no one was exempt. The Khmer
Rouge provided neither explanation,
nor food, water or medicine.
Thousands perished.
Spying encouraged
The Khmer Rouge followed by
breaking up families, closing
schools, eliminating the educated,
and encouraging spying on one
another. Among other things, prom
iscuity, listening to a radio and prac
ticing Buddhism, are punishable by
death.
The communists have even set a
new record for exploitation — peas
ants work from dawn to dusk with no
holidays or other days off. In return
they receive two meager meals of
rice gruel a day. This pitiful existence
has been further ravaged by disease
and starvation.
The sheer magnitude of the loss of
life is awesome. Estimates of the
human carnage range from a conser
vative 800,000 to two million. How do
the Khmer Rouge justify this land
without education, science, art,
freedom, business or hope? The eg
regious violation of all economic,
political and human rights?
Khieu Samphan, head of the Pres
idium, acknowledged to an Italian
journalist that a million Cambodians
had died since the communists had
come to power, and commented that
"it's incredible the way you wester
ners worry about war criminals."
Vietnam
Vietnam has fared somewhat bet
ter. An estimated 1500 refugees try to
flee Vietnam every month; unfortu
nately, the Vietnamese, like their
Cambodian, Soviet, East German and
other communist brethren, try to kill
as many putative refugees seeking to
flee paradise as possible.
The North Vietnamese regime is
also faced by scattered, though
growing, resistance from Montag
nard tribesmen, Hoa Hao and Cao
Dai Buddhists, disgruntled peasants,
and former soldiers under the Thieu
government.
The North Vietnamese imperialists
have been ruling the conquered
South as just that — conquered ter
ritory. North Vietnamese have all the
key leadership positions; only a few
minor posts have gone to the South
Vietnamese communists. Vast
amounts of goods have been confis
cated and shipped north, and re
fugees and the North Vietnamese
press have complained of rampant
corruption.
Beatings
Though the many executions after
the takeover did not result in a full
scale "bloodbath," thousands of Vie
tnamese have been consigned to
hard-labor, indoctrination and beat
ings at "reeducation camps." Intel-

lectuals and many others who had
been active opponents of the Thieu
regime have been arrested; dissi
dents are now shipped straight to
northern prisons.
Civil liberties are nori-existent —
there is no freedom of the press, as
sociation, religion or personal opin
ion. The conquered South is doing
even worse economically than under
the Thieu regime; many workers and
peasants are starving, since the rice
rations in some parts of the South
have dipped under a kilogram a
month.
Things have gotten so bad that a
group of more than 90 prominent an
tiwar activists, including loan Baez,
have appealed to the North Viet
namese regime to halt its "grievous
and systematic violation of human
rights."
Southeast Asia deserves our
prayers; the result of 2Vi years of
communist rule in Cambodia and
Vietnam has been worse than had
been predicted. South Korea, Chile,
the Philippines, repressive though
they are, are paragons of humanity,
freedom and democracy compared
with Cambodia and Vietnam —
whose heartless and totalitarian mis
rulers have ruthlessly and efficiently
murdered thousands.
