# An open letter to the faculty

Professor Robert Cohn of the
French department wrote recently in
Campus Report of the inanity of stu
dent evaluation of teaching. He
wrote, "the primary dimension of a
university's teaching is qualitative —
the deep changes in, and lasting ef
fect on, a talented few as opposed to
the shallower effect on the mass." I
think most students here would find
the elitist tone of this remark totally
out of place.
We do not come to a $7500 per year
university to be affected shallowly.
We could be affected shallowly any
where. But we need help for the
deep changes to occur.

We can't do it on our own, else we
would not need universities. We
need the help of a strong faculty
which has paved the way to new
knowledge, in the past and which is
willing tospend time trying to pass on
its knowledge to those who will fol
low.
You, the faculty, were once in our
shoes; we will someday be in yours
— but only with your help. If the fa
culty is willing to give us its concern,
we will not settle for a shallow effect
in our learning.
We do not want "flattening,
crowd-pleasing, mediocrization"
any more than you. We got that in

high school. Neither do we want dry,
stratospheric lectures that we cannot
understand. We are not yet your col
leagues, and you must not try to
teach us as if we were.
Cohn implied that improvement of
teaching has "nothing to do with the
advanced levels of teaching" and
that undergraduates look for "slick
performances." Good teaching and
interesting "performances" tend to
go together, and you will find, if you
take the time to look into it, that the
most important factor in student
evaluation is not "are you a crowd
pleaser," but "did you teach me in
such a way that I was able to learn."

I, or any member of Committee on
Evaluation and Improvement of
Teaching, would be glad to furnish
you with literature on thevalidity and
reliability of student evaluation as
one measure of teaching quality.
Do you recall what it was like to be
on the other end of a bureaucracy
that didn't seem to care? It is a painful
experience, every bit as painful as
the occasional sarcastic remark you
receive on your evaluations. We
have nowhere to go, no recourse
when we are subjected to poor
teaching. We often cannot even con
vey the message of poor teaching via
evaluation forms, since many profes
sors refuse to use them. And even
then it seems like too little, too late.
What a waste, it seems, to let any
part of our precious, short stay at
Stanford be blighted by poor teach
ing and its unfortunate corollary,
poor learning. Yet we have no re
course. Is it any surprise that an oc
casional student gets so frustrated,
so despairing of change, that he
loses consideration for the feelings
of those he evaluates? Not that this
makes cutting remarks justified, but
there is a give and take at work here.
We want to help you improve your
teaching; are you willing to let us
help you? Many of you are excellent
teachers, and we recognize and ap
preciate your efforts. But we want to
help the worst teachers among you
and the best, just as you want to im
prove the capabilities of the worst
and best students.
You may be concerned about our
education, you may be concerned
about improvement of teaching;
sometimes it does not appear to us
that that is the case. Clear away the
bitterness of our frustration; show us
your concern concretely. Only then
will all student evaluations become
hopeful, considerate and construc
tive critiques.
Implement universal course
evaluation, make a visible effort to
ward improvement, listen to and act
on our concerns about the portions
of teaching here which is poorly
done. Then our sarcasm born of
frustration will no longer be the only
voice heard.
