# Live life, don't study it

Monika Guttman

The most basic aspects of the
human soul are often totally ignored
by the majority of college students.
While all will acknowledge the
need for love and support, it is rare
that someone will venture beyond
the dictates of convention and reach
out to another student. The worst
part of the problem is that if there is
anywhere where students need
some basic love and support, it is in
college.
Here we are confronted by some
of the toughest problems we will
ever have to encounter, and to find
only competition and rivalry among
your peers is devastating. Yet this is a
fact of life in the late '70s, and the
only solution is to learn to deal with
it.
It may seem unnecessary and
ridiculous for sensitive, intelligent
human beings to stifle their basic in
stincts. It frustrates the most callous
of observers. Why should people
shun the companionship of their
classmates to spend the evening
alone in the library? The only answer
this 112 reshperson can find is pressure.
Pressure, whether internal or ex
ternal, drives these students daily,
and creates barriers which are rarely
overcome. The student finds himself
searching for a meaning to his educa
tion, and in the confusion of grades
and grad school applications he must

find that situation where he will be
happiest.
Why is it that everything is done in
such a hurry? We hurry through
these creative, exploratory years of
our lives just to situate ourselves in
the security of a career, where we
become (often) bitter and resentful
and bored.
Vet, if an individual decides to take
off a few years and "discover life," he
is accused of loafing, and is frowned
upon by the majority. It seems
paradoxical — everyone should find
his or her happiness, but he or she
should find it in four years in college
and then be certain about it!
Perhaps I am just trying to find an
excuse for the fact that I don't really
know what I want to do. Perhaps I am
an outcast — I find this atmosphere
absurd and superficial. Why should
human beings, gifted with creative
imagination, be forced to confine
themselves at so young an age?
Practically every person I have
spoken with has the desire to explore
other things beyond their concen
trated field of study. Yet there is
never enough "time." Cod forbid
you don't get a steady job! You'll
never be able to retire, for you'll have
no pension. . . .
Don't get me wrong. I seriously
realize the practical reasons for such
condensed periods of study, and I

also realize that if everyone were to
take as long as they liked in studying
just what they liked, there would be
very few people left to run society.
But I do object to this isolated
method of study.
It seems there is much more to life
than memorizing a textbook theory
about humanity. Whatever hap
pened to the good old philosophy of
living life instead of studying it?
The only thing I am suggesting is
that students be given the opportun
ity to find what it is they really want to
do. I know this is idealistic — not
everyone can afford (monetarily) the
leisure in which to explore those
things they find interesting.
If only the demands of deciding
upon a "major" were a little less in
tense, perhaps people would feel
freer to expand their horizons. In
evitably everyone would branch off
— certain people just don't enjoy
things as much as others do.
But this way students wouldn't feel
so "locked into" one course of
study. Maybe they would find time to
open up and explore themselves and
others and what they really enjoy do
ing.
I know, I know, I might as well
suggest that everyone in the world
join hands and sing of brotherhood,
love and peace....

searching for a meaning to his educa
tion, and in the confusion of grades
and grad school applications he must

find that situation where he will be
happiest.
Why is it that everything is done in
such a hurry? We hurry through
these creative, exploratory years of
our lives just to situate ourselves in
the security of a career, where we
become (often) bitter and resentful
and bored.
Vet, if an individual decides to take
off a few years and "discover life," he
is accused of loafing, and is frowned
upon by the majority. It seems
paradoxical — everyone should find
his or her happiness, but he or she
should find it in four years in college
and then be certain about it!
Perhaps I am just trying to find an
excuse for the fact that I don't really
know what I want to do. Perhaps I am
an outcast — I find this atmosphere
absurd and superficial. Why should
human beings, gifted with creative
imagination, be forced to confine
themselves at so young an age?
Practically every person I have
spoken with has the desire to explore
other things beyond their concen
trated field of study. Yet there is
never enough "time." Cod forbid
you don't get a steady job! You'll
never be able to retire, for you'll have
no pension. . . .
Don't get me wrong. I seriously
realize the practical reasons for such
condensed periods of study, and I

also realize that if everyone were to
take as long as they liked in studying
just what they liked, there would be
very few people left to run society.
But I do object to this isolated
method of study.
It seems there is much more to life
than memorizing a textbook theory
about humanity. Whatever hap
pened to the good old philosophy of
living life instead of studying it?
The only thing I am suggesting is
that students be given the opportun
ity to find what it is they really want to
do. I know this is idealistic — not
everyone can afford (monetarily) the
leisure in which to explore those
things they find interesting.
If only the demands of deciding
upon a "major" were a little less in
tense, perhaps people would feel
freer to expand their horizons. In
evitably everyone would branch off
— certain people just don't enjoy
things as much as others do.
But this way students wouldn't feel
so "locked into" one course of
study. Maybe they would find time to
open up and explore themselves and
others and what they really enjoy do
ing.
I know, I know, I might as well
suggest that everyone in the world
join hands and sing of brotherhood,
love and peace....

The most basic aspects of the
human soul are often totally ignored
by the majority of college students.
While all will acknowledge the
need for love and support, it is rare
that someone will venture beyond
the dictates of convention and reach
out to another student. The worst
part of the problem is that if there is
anywhere where students need
some basic love and support, it is in
college.
Here we are confronted by some
of the toughest problems we will
ever have to encounter, and to find
only competition and rivalry among
your peers is devastating. Yet this is a
fact of life in the late '70s, and the
only solution is to learn to deal with
it.
It may seem unnecessary and
ridiculous for sensitive, intelligent
human beings to stifle their basic in
stincts. It frustrates the most callous
of observers. Why should people
shun the companionship of their
classmates to spend the evening
alone in the library? The only answer
this 112 reshperson can find is pressure.
Pressure, whether internal or ex
ternal, drives these students daily,
and creates barriers which are rarely
overcome. The student finds himself
searching for a meaning to his educa
tion, and in the confusion of grades
and grad school applications he must

find that situation where he will be
happiest.
