This story takes place in the deep dark forests of
Ouebec Down in the deep dark forest there
were 2 grand old trees One day these trees were
swaying from side to side in the wind Suddenly
they looked down and saw a little sapling bet
ween them Anna 1 said the first tree that tree
is a son-of-a beech' An non non insisted the
other tree That little tree >s a son-of-a-birch
The two trees began to argue until suddenly
along flew a woodpecke r They asked to wood
pecker to determine the type of the lift '- tree
below
So the woodpecker took a little nibble trom the
big beech and then a little morsel from the birch
tree Then he lighted on the small tree in ques
tion Welt! T * jreat trees roared together
Is it a son-of-a-beech or a son ot-a-birch' I
dont know the woodpecker answered gutter
ally but that is the best piece of asn Ive sunk my
pecker into m a long time
Why are bankmq and sex similar ■> Once you
