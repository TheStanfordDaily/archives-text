Running track
I'm somewhat puzzled by the lack
of a well-maintained, fully accessible
running track at Stanford. The track
inside the football stadium is availa
ble at only very restricted hours (and
even these not on all days). Although
a project was planned to upgrade this
facility, nothing, as far as I know, has
been proposed with regard to Angell
Field.
Angell Field is open all the time,
but the poorly-kept dirt track makes
running unpleasant and even
dangerous. Not only has the grass
around and inside the oval become
little more than dried-up hay, but the
teeminggopher holes in the track are
quite conducive to ankle and knee
injuries.
I think these problems I have
briefly described are especially dif
ficult to rationalize when one con
siders the extent of running interest
at Stanford. It seems to me that the
large number of students, faculty
members, and staff personnel par
ticipating in this activity warrants the
maintenance of adequate facilities.

Sun Bowl
I have just read Bruce Anderson's
|an. 6 column about the Sun Bowl in
which he says "free booze flowed all
week for Stanford alumni in El Paso."

I can testify that nobody poured
me a single free drink in El Paso.
Either you should fire Anderson for
printing such a wild untruth, or lead
an editorial campaign for the head of
the Stanford administrator who so
foully neglected to inform us where
the free booze was.
And as long as I'm venting spleen,
I'd like to congratulate the Athletic
Department on its wise judgement in
refusing to fund the Band and the
Dollies at the Sun Bowl. After all, the
Athletic Department cleared a mere
530,000 on the game — a bare pit
tance. <And anyway, the Stanford
football team so routinely appears in
bowl games that I'm sure the whole
country is bored to death with the
band by now.)
I was going to donate a dormitory
with my next week's paycheck, but
the hell with it.

The Congress is presently consid
ering legislation of unprecedented
magnitude — legislation which
would set aside significant areas of
natural beauty and wilderness lo
cated in Alaska for the enjoyment not
only of today's Americans, but for
future generations as well.
Having spent a little time in "our
last frontierland," I understand the
basic human need for the sen ,e of

tranquility that seems to be attaina
ble only when one can feel free from
the pressures of time, crowds and
noise. This quality lends itself to both
an inner peace and a peace with
one's surroundings.
We cannot long survive as a
species without taking the time and
the effort to observe, contemplate
and yes, even to listen to the mes
sages for our natural surroundings.
The "Alaska National Interest
Lands" bill (H.R. 39) submitted by
Representative Morris Udall ID-
Arizona) would designate Alaska's
finest remaining wildlands as Na
tional Parks, Wildlife Refuges, or
Wild and Scenic Rivers, thereby af
fording these lands protection from
exploitation by developers. This bill
is the result of a long process of data
collections and analysis, and a series
of public hearings held throughout
the country, and represents a
reasoned compromise between the
goals of wilderness preservation and
jobs for Alaskans.
Approximately two-thirds of
Alaska would still be open for possi
ble development under the provi
sions of H.R. 39. Several substitute
bills have been submitted, including
one by the Carter administration;
but each of these provides only
weaker protection for wilderness
areas than does H.R. 39.
