# Building aesthetics subject to costs

The proliferation of building pro
jects on campus the past three years
has made me quite uncomfortable.
It's almost as if Stanford buildings
were capable of mating. (I have, in
fact, seen the law school sneaking up
behind Cubberley late one night.)
My discomfort has spurred me into
tackling a formidable investigation,
the findings of which I'll reveal pre
sently. This article, by the way, has
not been copyrighted â€” I didn't want
to delay disclosing the facts, and the
$1.35 filing charge was a little too
steep.
Anyway, I have learned that the de
luge of building projects on the Stan
ford campus is due to the overpower
ing wealth of certain eccentric
alumni. It seems that the committee
which gives the go-ahead on campus
construction is often at the mercy of
enormously wealthy contributors
who want to have their names im
mortalized on buildings.
Construction
For example, my investigations re
vealed that the main library is being
expanded because the money is
coming from an alumnus whose
name was too large to fit onto the
original building. I've also found that
the bookstore is being annexed for
similar motives of self-glorification.
It seems that the money for this pro
ject is being donated by an alumnus
who made his fortune perfecting an
assembly line method of "fixing"
torn cats. Apparently, when the
bookstore annex opens it will sell
only contraceptives for pets, or offer
them lessons in the rhythm method.
I also discovered that the construc
tion of the quadrangle was funded by
one of the Parker Brothers and that
the structure was originally intended
to resemble a Monopoly board, with
the math corner as "Do Not Pass Co"
and Memorial Church structured like
a hotel on Park Place. Unfortunately,
the project never materialized be
cause administration officials would
not accept the Parker Brothers'

monopoly money.
However, the most shocking con
struction project here is still in the
planning stages. Apparently, the
money is coming from Caleb
Cornwell, an alumnus who made his
fortune in the fertilizer business and
is an avid outdoorsman. He, like the
others, wishes to be immortalized in
some structure, but his unusual re
quest is causing some difficulty at the
Department of Campus Develop
ment. The following is a transcript of
a conversation I overheard while re
searching this upcoming project at
the offices of the department. (The
names have been changed to protect
me.)
Conversation
"Bill, I realize we were able to get
away with sticking a huge fountain in
the busiest road on campus and dur
ing the worst drought in history, but I
doubt the community will appreciate
Cornwell's demands."
"Now be reasonable, Sarah. If
the man is giving us $5 million, he
deserves to see his dream come
true."
"Agreed, but where are we going
to put a 45-foot high replica of rac
coon droppings?"
"I don't know. The proctology de
partment at the Medical Center has
expressed an interest in the
sculpture, but they've already com
missioned Cristo to construct an
alimentary canal from here to San
lose."
"What about the primate center?
Maybe they'd want it."
"I've already asked. They said,
'What do we need a 45-foot high re
plica when we nearly have the real
thing?' "
"(Expletive), this is ridiculous.
Why should we have to submit to the
whims of some loaded old goat?"
" Cause if we don't, he's
threatened to repossess the earth
sciences building and three human
biology professors."
"Oh."

So you see, the University is
caught in a difficult bargaining posi
tion, constantly having to choose be
tween financial support and on
campus aesthetics. And when the
cranes begin lowering bronze that

resembles raccoon droppings, you'll
know that a man named Caleb is
grinning like a Chessie cat.
