Infectious mononucleosis —
popularly known as the kissing dis
ease. What is it? How is it contracted?
What are its effects? According to Dr.
Gene Phillips of Stanford Universi
ty's student health center, many
people at Stanford and across the
country have misconceptions about
mononucleosis. Not only are there
many more people who come into
the center thinking they have mono
and don't, but less than half of the 60
or so blood tests taken each month
for mono turn up positive.
Why do misconceptions about
mono exist? According to Phillips,
the reason lies in the extreme varia
bility of the symptoms and severity of
the illness. Misconceptions concern
how and why one gets it, methods of
treatment — namely what can be
done and what can't be done — how
long it lasts, and whether there are
likely to be relapses or reoccurrences
from it.
The full name for the illness is in
fectious mononucleosis — the two
words indicating first that it is a con
tagious disease, and secondly there
occurs a change in blood count. As
pointed out by Phillips however,
mono is not as contagious as other
viral infections such as measles and
chicken pox, nor even as catching as
the common cold. There is no evi
dence thatworkingtoo hard, not get
ting enough sleep, makes one more
susceptible. Vou get mono simply
because you had the bad luck of
being in contact with someone who
has mono, and you are susceptible
only if you haven't previously had the
virus.

Mono is aonce-in-a-lifetime llness.
Once you've had it you develop an
tibodies to that virus and are immune
for the rest of your life.
For some, mono may mean only a
feeling of fatigue and a scratchy
throat. No fever may be present. For
others, it may mean an extremely
painful throat and high fever. What
ever the degree of severity, most
people are over the symptoms in two
to three weeks, not two to three
months as is widely believed to be
the case. There are no relapses or
reoccurrences of the disease.
Because antibiotics are ineffectual
for viruses, the treatment of mono is
strictly for the symptoms: aspirin for
fever, gargling for the throat. Accord
ing to Phillips, even bedrest will not
help one get over the virus more
quickly. How you feel is the best
guide to activity.
Most students continue to go to
classes and are able to keep up with
everyday activities.
As for spreading the disease, Dr.
Phillips points out it is impractical to
isolate or quarantine individuals with
mono. Statistics show that only 10-30
percent of people who have not pre
viously had mono will actually get it
when in contact with someone who
has it.
As for being called the kissing dis
ease, there is no misconception
here. Vou can get mono in many
ways, but because the virus is in the
throat, and in the saliva of the throat,
it can easily be spread by kissing.

fectious mononucleosis — the two
words indicating first that it is a con
tagious disease, and secondly there
occurs a change in blood count. As
pointed out by Phillips however,
mono is not as contagious as other
viral infections such as measles and
chicken pox, nor even as catching as
the common cold. There is no evi
dence thatworkingtoo hard, not get
ting enough sleep, makes one more
susceptible. Vou get mono simply
because you had the bad luck of
being in contact with someone who
has mono, and you are susceptible
only if you haven't previously had the
virus.

Mono is aonce-in-a-lifetime llness.
Once you've had it you develop an
tibodies to that virus and are immune
for the rest of your life.
For some, mono may mean only a
feeling of fatigue and a scratchy
throat. No fever may be present. For
others, it may mean an extremely
painful throat and high fever. What
ever the degree of severity, most
people are over the symptoms in two
to three weeks, not two to three
months as is widely believed to be
the case. There are no relapses or
reoccurrences of the disease.
Because antibiotics are ineffectual
for viruses, the treatment of mono is
strictly for the symptoms: aspirin for
fever, gargling for the throat. Accord
ing to Phillips, even bedrest will not
help one get over the virus more
quickly. How you feel is the best
guide to activity.
Most students continue to go to
classes and are able to keep up with
everyday activities.
As for spreading the disease, Dr.
Phillips points out it is impractical to
isolate or quarantine individuals with
mono. Statistics show that only 10-30
percent of people who have not pre
viously had mono will actually get it
when in contact with someone who
has it.
As for being called the kissing dis
ease, there is no misconception
here. Vou can get mono in many
ways, but because the virus is in the
throat, and in the saliva of the throat,
it can easily be spread by kissing.

Infectious mononucleosis —
popularly known as the kissing dis
ease. What is it? How is it contracted?
What are its effects? According to Dr.
Gene Phillips of Stanford Universi
ty's student health center, many
people at Stanford and across the
country have misconceptions about
mononucleosis. Not only are there
many more people who come into
the center thinking they have mono
and don't, but less than half of the 60
or so blood tests taken each month
for mono turn up positive.
Why do misconceptions about
mono exist? According to Phillips,
the reason lies in the extreme varia
bility of the symptoms and severity of
the illness. Misconceptions concern
how and why one gets it, methods of
treatment — namely what can be
done and what can't be done — how
long it lasts, and whether there are
likely to be relapses or reoccurrences
from it.
