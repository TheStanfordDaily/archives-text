# Japan hosts Stanford students
## 
### Jean Kimmel 
Are you ready for the
cheapest overseas program
Stanford has to offer?
How about a two-month trip
to Japan for only $600 including
room, board and airfare?
The Stanford Keio Commit
tee is a student-run organiza
tion that sponsors such foreign
exchanges with Keio University
in Tokyo, Japan.
"The program has been
around for 25 years," said
committee chairman Gerald
Hane. It started in 1953 as a
friendship exchange and
evolved into an academic ex
change in 1960. Since 1970 it
has been a strictly cultural ex
change.

Students from Keio Univer
sity will be here from Feb. 28 to
May 1. Then Stanford students
get their chance to see Japan
tor 2 months during the sum
mer.
International
The summer exchange in
Keio sponsors students from
Canada, Finland and Hong
Kong as well as America. It or
ganizes activities for all stu
dents during the first month
only. The activities include two
special trips, one to Kyoto, a
traditional city of )apan with
temples and shrines, and the
other to Tohuka where
lapanese festivals can be seen.
Other excursions include a
trip to Mt. Fuji, tours of fac
tories such as Soni, a stay on a
lapanese farm and lectures on
cultural differences at Keio.
"After the first month the
students are on their own to
decide what they want to do,
but by then they've made so
many friends and seen so
much that it is easy to find
plenty to do," said Fujio
Harada, chairman of the ex
change chapter in Tokyo.
"This program allows you to
really see |apan because you
aren't tied down to classes and
the host Keio students who
take you around are on their
summer break," Hane said.
"There is plenty of free time
and many students go over to

Hong Kong or other parts of
Asia," Hane said.
Berkeley
Activities are centered at
Keio University with its 50,000
students, and Harada said it is
similar to Berkeley.
"You'd be surprised how
westernized Tokyo is; we saw
many Kentucky Fried Chicken
and Baskin Robbins," said
Nakada.
"Tokyo is an exciting city,
but hectic. There's always so
much going on," said Tom
Yamashita, participant in the
1976 exchange.
Students stay with host
families for the full two
months. "There is no language
requirement because Keio
students speak English,"
Nakada said.
Many host families do not
know English, yet they "treat
you as part of the family,"
Harada said.
Most host families live out
side of Tokyo in rural areas.
"Public transportation is really
extensive so there is no prob
lem getting around," said
Nakada.
"My family lived a half hour
out of Tokyo. By taking the
train you get to see a lot more
of Japan," Yashita said.
Local hosts
In return for the Japanese
hospitality, the students of the

Stanford Keio Committee ar
range for the Japanese stu
dents to stay with local host
families in Palo Alto until
spring break when they move
in to the dorms.
The committee is now or
ganizing an itinerary for the
students which includes a bus
tour of California and seminars
on cultural differences. An
added attraction is the chance
to experience daily life on the
Farm. One student last year
remarked for the Stanford Ob
server that he even enjoyed
Stern food.
"The students from Japan
are a fun bunch. Last year they
were really into western music;
we got tired of hearing the
Carpenters," said Hane.
The Stanford Keio Commit
tee will have applications avail
able for the |apan exchange in
mid-April, and 10 students will
be chosen. This opportunity is
open to all students here, there
is no ethnic requirement, and
you need not be a member of
the comm'ttee to apply.
However, "it helps to join
the committee because it gives
you a chance to interact with
the exchange students before
you go over," Nakada said.
It is a cheap and exciting trip,
and "you can get by without
spending much unless you
start buying cameras and audio
sets/' Nakada said.


Keio University, in Tokyo, |apan, will enroll about 10 Stanford students this summer through a foreign
exchange program sponsored^by the Stanford Keio Committee. Japanese students in the program will be
here from Feb. 28 to May 1.
