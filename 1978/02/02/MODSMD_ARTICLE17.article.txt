# Intellectual job sharing at ARLO
## 
### Emily Sachar 
Job sharing is no novel
phenomenon. Secretaries
and librarians have prac
ticed the tradition for years.
One works the morning
shift; another replaces the
first, working until closing
time.
But another interpreta
tion of theconcept, dividing
substantive, intellectual
large-task responsibilities
among two or more indi
viduals, is now emerg
ing.
Stanford's Action Re
search Liaison Office
(ARLO) operates under the
job-sharing plan, and each
of its two directors works
just over half time coor
dinating ARLO functions.
"One of the most basic
points about job sharing,
and one that must be con
tinually emphasized to the
public, is that neither one of

us is the director. We have
made a conscious effort to
see that our role as director
is seen as a cooperative
one," said Co-director Wil
liam Leland.
Duet
Leland's partner in the job
sharing duet is Edith Eddy.
She also views the job
sharing role as more than an
effort to slice respon
sibilities.
"Though we have divided
up specific areas of primary
responsibility, we each
carry the responsibility for
the total ARLO program —
to shape, direct it and fulfill
our goals," Eddy said. "We
deliberate jointly, share in
formation and planning
ideas, and also carry out
specific tasks on our own."
Leland and Eddy share a
one-room cubby-holed of
fice above the ASSU offices
in Tresidder.
Interaction
"We've been able to use
the interaction of this situa
tion to our own advantage,
reflecting off one another.
I'll suggest contacts to Edie
for use in dealing with her
students and projects. And
I'll inquire when I need con
tacts. We double our re
sources," Leland said.
"This interchange also
requires that we are suppor
tive of one another when
particularly stressful situa
tions arise," Leland con
tinued.
job sharing produces ad
vantages for an individual's
outside life as well, allowing
more family or interaction
than might be otherwise av
ailable.

Both participants in the
endeavor have families and
outside avocations. "It is
significant and somewhat
rare that I can be a profes
sional woman, a mother,
and a community particip
ant," Eddy said.
Although it sounds like an
ideal alternative for main
taining sanity in a maze-like
world, job sharing certainly
has not created a domino ef
fect in the United States.
Nearly all large professional
organizations function in
the t-aditional presidential
hierarchy.
")ob sharing hasn't
caught on mainly because
there is some irregularity in
the flow of management.
The directors need to have
discussions involving
creativity. Also we now see
new ways to divide tasks
that haven't existed before.
This can make people un
comfortable," Leland said.
'Fringe jobs'
"Actually, 'fringe jobs'
like clerk or librarian job
sharing have been around.
But the new 'line jobs'
where people are reporting
directly to the job sharers in
their directorship, are a
whole new idea. ARLO, for
example depends on col
laboration and cooperation.
It seems appropriate that
the directorship should as
well," Eddy said.
ARLO brings together its
own expertise through
community-proposed,
student-researched and
faculty-advised projects.
"ARLO's nature is particu
larly receptive to the con
cept, more than some or

ganizations. Bill and I must
always bring together things
we've learned, not only
from each other, but from
community people and stu
dents as well," Eddy said.
To spread the concept of
job sharing nationwide,
KQED, the Bay Area's edu
cational television station,
featured Leland and Eddy in
a half-hour segment Tues
day night. The show will be
repeated tonight at 8:30
p.m. on channel 9.
According to Leland, the
program is "showing men
and women doing different
things with their lives, with
more emphasis on the wo
men."
The main focus of the
women on the show, said
Leland, "is that they're able
to devote themselves to
their professions and their
families."

"One of the most basic
points about job sharing,
and one that must be con
tinually emphasized to the
public, is that neither one of

us is the director. We have
made a conscious effort to
see that our role as director
is seen as a cooperative
one," said Co-director Wil
liam Leland.
Duet
Leland's partner in the job
sharing duet is Edith Eddy.
She also views the job
sharing role as more than an
effort to slice respon
sibilities.
"Though we have divided
up specific areas of primary
responsibility, we each
carry the responsibility for
the total ARLO program —
to shape, direct it and fulfill
our goals," Eddy said. "We
deliberate jointly, share in
formation and planning
ideas, and also carry out
specific tasks on our own."
Leland and Eddy share a
one-room cubby-holed of
fice above the ASSU offices
in Tresidder.
Interaction
"We've been able to use
the interaction of this situa
tion to our own advantage,
reflecting off one another.
I'll suggest contacts to Edie
for use in dealing with her
students and projects. And
I'll inquire when I need con
tacts. We double our re
sources," Leland said.
"This interchange also
requires that we are suppor
tive of one another when
particularly stressful situa
tions arise," Leland con
tinued.
job sharing produces ad
vantages for an individual's
outside life as well, allowing
more family or interaction
than might be otherwise av
ailable.

Both participants in the
endeavor have families and
outside avocations. "It is
significant and somewhat
rare that I can be a profes
sional woman, a mother,
and a community particip
ant," Eddy said.
Although it sounds like an
ideal alternative for main
taining sanity in a maze-like
world, job sharing certainly
has not created a domino ef
fect in the United States.
Nearly all large professional
organizations function in
the t-aditional presidential
hierarchy.
")ob sharing hasn't
caught on mainly because
there is some irregularity in
the flow of management.
The directors need to have
discussions involving
creativity. Also we now see
new ways to divide tasks
that haven't existed before.
This can make people un
comfortable," Leland said.
'Fringe jobs'
"Actually, 'fringe jobs'
like clerk or librarian job
sharing have been around.
But the new 'line jobs'
where people are reporting
directly to the job sharers in
their directorship, are a
whole new idea. ARLO, for
example depends on col
laboration and cooperation.
It seems appropriate that
the directorship should as
well," Eddy said.
ARLO brings together its
own expertise through
community-proposed,
student-researched and
faculty-advised projects.
"ARLO's nature is particu
larly receptive to the con
cept, more than some or

ganizations. Bill and I must
always bring together things
we've learned, not only
from each other, but from
community people and stu
dents as well," Eddy said.
To spread the concept of
job sharing nationwide,
KQED, the Bay Area's edu
cational television station,
featured Leland and Eddy in
a half-hour segment Tues
day night. The show will be
repeated tonight at 8:30
p.m. on channel 9.
According to Leland, the
program is "showing men
and women doing different
things with their lives, with
more emphasis on the wo
men."
The main focus of the
women on the show, said
Leland, "is that they're able
to devote themselves to
their professions and their
families."

Job sharing is no novel
phenomenon. Secretaries

One works the morning
shift; another replaces the
first, working until closing
time.

substantive, intellectual
large-task responsibilities
among two or more indi
viduals, is now emerg

Stanford's Action Re

just over half time coor
