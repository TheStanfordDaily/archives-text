# Teens ignorant about gov't
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Nearly all teenagers know
who the president is, but for many that's where
their knowledge of government stops. Less than
half can name even one of their senators or
representatives in Congress, a nationwide sur
vey has found.
During the first half of the 19705, an era that
included the Vietnam War, campus distur
bances and the Watergate scandal, understand
ing of the way democracy works declined
among American youth aged 13 and 17, the Na
tional Assessment of Education Progress re
ported yesterday.
The federally sponsored survey tested 145,000
teenagers in 1970, 1972 and 1976 to chart their
political knowledge and attitudes.
Basic concept
It found that among 17-year-olds, the ability to
explain the basic concept of democracy —
namely, that the people elect their leaders —
declined from 86 per cent to 74 per cent. Among
13-year-olds, it fell from 53 to 42 per cent.
More than 96 per cent of both age groups
could name the president, but only about 20 per
cent of the 1 i-year-olds could name any of their
representatives in Congress. That was about the
same as 13-year-olds fared in 1970, but it was
down from 57 per cent for 17-year-olds.
Disappointing
Experts who took part in the study called the
results disappointing but not surprising. They
blamed it on a shift from civics courses to elec
tives.

"Social studies is receiving very low priority in
the curriculum and the attrition rate of these
courses is very high," said Anna Ochoa, an In
diana University education professor and presi
dent of the National Council for the Social
Studies.
Electives
"Electives are being substituted tor hard-core
government classes," she said, adding that the
number of students in civics courses was more
than 700,000 in 1961, but only 450,000 in 1973.
The report also said, "The pressure to return
to the 'basics' at the elementary level has in
many cases reduced the time available for social
studies."
The report said students showed mixed re
sults on recognizing and valuing constitutional
rights. It said 13-year-olds showed more con
cern about the rights of persons accused of
crimes, possibly because they have watched so
many television shows featuring police and
lawyers.
Religion
Among 13-year-olds, 49 per cent said they
were willing to allow someone who did not be
lieve in God to hold a public office; 59 per cent
were willing in the past. The percentage of those
who felt the press should be able to publish
criticism of elected officials rose from 49 per
cent to 54 per cent.
About 80 per cent of both groups said they
were willing to allow persons of another race to
live in their neighborhood. The youths also
were asked if they were willing to have such a
person "be your barber or beauty operator,"
and 82 per cent or more said yes.

political knowledge and attitudes.
Basic concept
It found that among 17-year-olds, the ability to
explain the basic concept of democracy —
namely, that the people elect their leaders —
declined from 86 per cent to 74 per cent. Among
13-year-olds, it fell from 53 to 42 per cent.
More than 96 per cent of both age groups
could name the president, but only about 20 per
cent of the 1 i-year-olds could name any of their
representatives in Congress. That was about the
same as 13-year-olds fared in 1970, but it was
down from 57 per cent for 17-year-olds.
Disappointing
Experts who took part in the study called the
results disappointing but not surprising. They
blamed it on a shift from civics courses to elec
tives.

"Social studies is receiving very low priority in
the curriculum and the attrition rate of these
courses is very high," said Anna Ochoa, an In
diana University education professor and presi
dent of the National Council for the Social
Studies.
Electives
"Electives are being substituted tor hard-core
government classes," she said, adding that the
number of students in civics courses was more
than 700,000 in 1961, but only 450,000 in 1973.
The report also said, "The pressure to return
to the 'basics' at the elementary level has in
many cases reduced the time available for social
studies."
The report said students showed mixed re
sults on recognizing and valuing constitutional
rights. It said 13-year-olds showed more con
cern about the rights of persons accused of
crimes, possibly because they have watched so
many television shows featuring police and
lawyers.
Religion
Among 13-year-olds, 49 per cent said they
were willing to allow someone who did not be
lieve in God to hold a public office; 59 per cent
were willing in the past. The percentage of those
who felt the press should be able to publish
criticism of elected officials rose from 49 per
cent to 54 per cent.
About 80 per cent of both groups said they
were willing to allow persons of another race to
live in their neighborhood. The youths also
were asked if they were willing to have such a
person "be your barber or beauty operator,"
and 82 per cent or more said yes.
Washington (AP) — Nearly all teenagers know
who the president is, but for many that's where
their knowledge of government stops. Less than
half can name even one of their senators or
representatives in Congress, a nationwide sur
vey has found.
During the first half of the 19705, an era that
included the Vietnam War, campus distur
bances and the Watergate scandal, understand
ing of the way democracy works declined
among American youth aged 13 and 17, the Na
tional Assessment of Education Progress re
ported yesterday.
The federally sponsored survey tested 145,000
teenagers in 1970, 1972 and 1976 to chart their
political knowledge and attitudes.
