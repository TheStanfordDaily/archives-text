# Western culture proposals
## Student panel to blast requirement 
### Craig Dennis 
A student ad hoc panel report will
express great concern over the
numerous western culture require
ment proposals, two panel members
said this week.
The report is due out within two
weeks, the members added.
"The notion of a requirement must
be rejected," said Steve Westly,
chairman of the student panel and an
ASSU Council of Presidents
member.
"We would like to see a western
culture course offering, but we want
it to be optional," said Andy Brown,
another panel member. Brown is
also a member of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US) and
its task force on the Western Culture
requirement.
The ad hoc student panel was
formed last November. The 10 mem
bers include student leaders in
volved in the issue of reinstating the
western civilization requirement of
three quarters which was dropped in
the late 19605.
The purpose of the panel is to in
form students of the proposed re
quirement, lobby them, make them
understand the issue and keep a
constant line of communication

open between students and faculty
members debating the requirement,
according to Westly.
"It is clear if we are to have student
input, we have to organize now,"
Westly added.
The task force on western culture
is tentatively scheduled to deliver its
final recommendations to C-US be
fore the end of this quarter, and the
Faculty Senate will accept or reject
the idea of a western culture re
quirement by the end of this year.
Brown said the grandfather clause
in all the proposals has hindered the
arousal of student interest. All cur
rently enrolled students would be
exempted from the requirement if it
is approved by the Faculty Senate.
"The new requirement will be de
termined by a power struggle that
will make the final recommendation
unsatisfactory," Westly said.
He said thead hoc panel report will
argue persuasively against a re
quirement by showing the Faculty
Senate has no statistical data to back
up the need for a requirement."
Westly claimed there has been "no
statistical study by faculty" of what
students need academically. Brown
said the evidence some faculty
members have used in calling for a

requirement has been "insulting to
students."
"The relative influence of western
culture today is less than it was 50 to
100 years ago," Brown said. "This
type of education might be in
adequate."
Brown said there is a concern by
task force members that their re
commendations will be toned down
by the Faculty Senate. Politics of for
mat and finance is being developed
in the alternative proposals offered
by various faculty, he said.
"Everyone seems to agree that
there is something students should
know, but no one agrees what that
subject is," Brown said.
"You better be saying this is the
best course that can be taken,"
Westly commented. "Why western
culture is going to shape anyone's
life more than anything else is
beyond me."
Brown said there must be "a com
mitment to teach western culture
well," but with the aJternate multi
tract proposals now being
suggested, he said this might not
happen.
It would take $500,000 to $800,000
to financially support the preferred
model. Brown said there is a lack of

commitment by faculty and adminis
trators to appropriate that amount.
Brown added, "The Faculty Senate
has not committed itself to the re
quirement yet, but just to the idea of
exploring its possibilities."
The student panel menpbers will
"test the feedback on our report and
see where we go from there," said
Westly.

best course that can be taken,"
Westly commented. "Why western
culture is going to shape anyone's
life more than anything else is
beyond me."
Brown said there must be "a com
mitment to teach western culture
well," but with the aJternate multi
tract proposals now being
suggested, he said this might not
happen.
It would take $500,000 to $800,000
to financially support the preferred
model. Brown said there is a lack of

commitment by faculty and adminis
trators to appropriate that amount.
Brown added, "The Faculty Senate
has not committed itself to the re
quirement yet, but just to the idea of
exploring its possibilities."
The student panel menpbers will
"test the feedback on our report and
see where we go from there," said
Westly.
A student ad hoc panel report will
express great concern over the
numerous western culture require
ment proposals, two panel members
said this week.
The report is due out within two
weeks, the members added.
"The notion of a requirement must
be rejected," said Steve Westly,
chairman of the student panel and an
ASSU Council of Presidents
member.
"We would like to see a western
culture course offering, but we want
it to be optional," said Andy Brown,
another panel member. Brown is
also a member of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US) and
its task force on the Western Culture
requirement.
The ad hoc student panel was
formed last November. The 10 mem
bers include student leaders in
volved in the issue of reinstating the
western civilization requirement of
three quarters which was dropped in
the late 19605.
The purpose of the panel is to in
form students of the proposed re
quirement, lobby them, make them
understand the issue and keep a
constant line of communication

open between students and faculty
members debating the requirement,
according to Westly.
"It is clear if we are to have student
input, we have to organize now,"
Westly added.
The task force on western culture
is tentatively scheduled to deliver its
final recommendations to C-US be
fore the end of this quarter, and the
Faculty Senate will accept or reject
the idea of a western culture re
quirement by the end of this year.
Brown said the grandfather clause
in all the proposals has hindered the
arousal of student interest. All cur
rently enrolled students would be
exempted from the requirement if it
is approved by the Faculty Senate.
"The new requirement will be de
termined by a power struggle that
will make the final recommendation
unsatisfactory," Westly said.
He said thead hoc panel report will
argue persuasively against a re
quirement by showing the Faculty
Senate has no statistical data to back
up the need for a requirement."
Westly claimed there has been "no
statistical study by faculty" of what
students need academically. Brown
said the evidence some faculty
members have used in calling for a

requirement has been "insulting to
students."
"The relative influence of western
culture today is less than it was 50 to
100 years ago," Brown said. "This
type of education might be in
adequate."
Brown said there is a concern by
task force members that their re
commendations will be toned down
by the Faculty Senate. Politics of for
mat and finance is being developed
in the alternative proposals offered
by various faculty, he said.
"Everyone seems to agree that
there is something students should
know, but no one agrees what that
subject is," Brown said.
"You better be saying this is the
best course that can be taken,"
Westly commented. "Why western
culture is going to shape anyone's
life more than anything else is
beyond me."
