# Lady behind the costumes
## 
### Alison Smale 
Buried at the back of Memo
rial Auditorium is a large room
overcrowded with a wonderful
display of cloaks, wigs, model
ing busts, sewing machines,
delicate lace, feathers and
paste rubies.
At first sight, all appears to
be a big colorful chaos. But to
Barbara Cleveland, costume
technician for Stanford's
Drama Department, this is her
office, and the fake jewelry in
tiny drawers fills her filing
cabinet.
Cleveland is currently work
ing on the costumes for the
Drama Department's main
production this quarter. The
play is Edward Bond's The Sea,
which takes place in England in
the early 1900s. Performances
are Feb. 15-18, 21-25 in the Lit
tle Theater.
Corsets
"We have our corsets all cut
out and we're getting them put
together," Cleveland says with
evident joy, explaining that she
relishes the prospect of work
ing on costumes from this
period.
"Nineteen hundred is my
favorite period. I really think

the bustle period is lovely to
look at."
Thecostumes for The Sea are
of a slightly later period and
will not have bustles, but
bulges will be added in other
directions. Pouches will make
the student playing the Vicar
look as if he has been drinking
beer for the last four decades,
and pads have to be added to
sag an aged character's
bustline.
Cleveland finds changing
the shape of a person's body
one of the most interesting as
pects of her work. For a show
some years ago, built-up
shoulders had to be con
structed to give the appear
ance of a weird and wonderful
human being with no neck.
23 years
As she talks about the pro
ductions she has worked on in
her 23 years with the Drama
Department, the 44-year-old
costume technician refers
more often to the costumes
each play required than the
name of the play.
"Some shows with war
scenes are difficult," Cleve
land says. "A soldier has to be
beautiful in one scene, then

stagger back out of battle a few
moments later in rags and tat
ters. We make two garments.
Both have to be made so they
fit perfectly. Then we take one
and rip it apart."
More frustrating was a cos
tume for a music student in an
opera at Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium a few years ago.
Cleveland recalls fitting ses
sions at her home, and the
hours she worked to make the
folds in the dress hang per
fectly.
"I went to see the show —
and all we saw of the girl was
her face," Cleveland says with
a smile.
Usually Cleveland is not in
volved in costume design,
either for the main produc
tions, or for the one-act plays
directed by second-year Ph.D.
students each quarter.
"I think it's far better to have
someone else design,"' com
ments Cleveland. "That way
I'm free to do the supervising.
It's awfully hard to do both."
As she talks, Cleveland bus
tles around inspecting the
work of student helpers
hunched over their sewing
machines.

The students are members of
a costume construction class
which Cleveland teaches with
Douglas Russell, a Drama De
partment faculty member and
costume designer for The Sea.
"By the time the students get
out of here," Cleveland says,
"they should be able to draft,
construct and finish a gar
ment."
She learned the same slow
way. Cleveland originally came
to Stanford to help out with the
costumes for a Ram's Head
student production. At that
time she only knew how to use
a sewing machine. Over the
years she learned everything
she could about the history of
costume, both from classes
and trial and error.
And of course there were er
rors. The story of a beautifully
fitting sleeve sewn into the
neckhole is Cleveland's favo
rite anecdote for despairing
students.
Cleveland also supervises
more experienced student
crews who work on the diffe
rent productions. The turnover
of people — and garments — is
as voluminous as the yardage
of an eighteenth-century cos
tume hanging idly in a corner.
Cleveland says she would
have "no way of telling" how
many thousands of costumes
gather dust in the costume
store below her workshop.
Perfection
With four weeks between
the beginning of the quarter
and the first dress rehearsal,
that adds up to a lot of braid to
be stitched, wigs to be curled,
bonnets, hats and bustles to be
constructed.
Everything must be perfect
— for the designer, the direc
tor, the actor, and of course
Cleveland herself. She clearly
loves her task. An extra show
last spring meant more work,
but she likes it that way.
"If I have time, I love to do it.
As a matter of fact you know,
it's much betterto keep busy."
Leaving the workshop and
the world of the nineteenth
century, the last glimpse is of
Barbara Cleveland cutting a
dress which in four weeks'
time will grace the stage of the
Little Theater as an elegant cos
tume.

Perfection
With four weeks between
the beginning of the quarter
and the first dress rehearsal,
that adds up to a lot of braid to
be stitched, wigs to be curled,
bonnets, hats and bustles to be
constructed.
Everything must be perfect
— for the designer, the direc

Cleveland herself. She clearly
loves her task. An extra show
last spring meant more work,
but she likes it that way.
"If I have time, I love to do it.
As a matter of fact you know,

Cleveland stitches bustles for 19th century costumes

Costume wizard has clothed actors here for years.
Buried at the back of Memo
rial Auditorium is a large room
overcrowded with a wonderful
display of cloaks, wigs, model
ing busts, sewing machines,
delicate lace, feathers and
paste rubies.
At first sight, all appears to
be a big colorful chaos. But to
Barbara Cleveland, costume
technician for Stanford's
Drama Department, this is her
office, and the fake jewelry in
tiny drawers fills her filing
cabinet.
Cleveland is currently work
ing on the costumes for the
Drama Department's main
production this quarter. The
play is Edward Bond's The Sea,
which takes place in England in
the early 1900s. Performances
are Feb. 15-18, 21-25 in the Lit
tle Theater.
Corsets
"We have our corsets all cut
out and we're getting them put
together," Cleveland says with
evident joy, explaining that she
relishes the prospect of work
ing on costumes from this
period.
"Nineteen hundred is my
favorite period. I really think

the bustle period is lovely to
look at."
Thecostumes for The Sea are
of a slightly later period and
will not have bustles, but
bulges will be added in other
directions. Pouches will make
the student playing the Vicar
look as if he has been drinking
beer for the last four decades,
and pads have to be added to
sag an aged character's
bustline.
Cleveland finds changing
the shape of a person's body
one of the most interesting as
pects of her work. For a show
some years ago, built-up
shoulders had to be con
structed to give the appear
ance of a weird and wonderful
human being with no neck.
23 years
As she talks about the pro
ductions she has worked on in
her 23 years with the Drama
Department, the 44-year-old
costume technician refers
more often to the costumes
each play required than the
name of the play.
"Some shows with war
scenes are difficult," Cleve
land says. "A soldier has to be
beautiful in one scene, then

stagger back out of battle a few
moments later in rags and tat
ters. We make two garments.
Both have to be made so they
fit perfectly. Then we take one
and rip it apart."
More frustrating was a cos
tume for a music student in an
opera at Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium a few years ago.
Cleveland recalls fitting ses
sions at her home, and the
hours she worked to make the
folds in the dress hang per
fectly.
"I went to see the show —
and all we saw of the girl was
her face," Cleveland says with
a smile.
Usually Cleveland is not in
volved in costume design,
either for the main produc
tions, or for the one-act plays
directed by second-year Ph.D.
students each quarter.
"I think it's far better to have
someone else design,"' com
ments Cleveland. "That way
I'm free to do the supervising.
It's awfully hard to do both."
As she talks, Cleveland bus
tles around inspecting the
work of student helpers
hunched over their sewing
machines.

The students are members of
a costume construction class
which Cleveland teaches with
Douglas Russell, a Drama De
partment faculty member and
costume designer for The Sea.
"By the time the students get
out of here," Cleveland says,
"they should be able to draft,
construct and finish a gar
ment."
She learned the same slow
way. Cleveland originally came
to Stanford to help out with the
costumes for a Ram's Head
student production. At that
time she only knew how to use
a sewing machine. Over the
years she learned everything
she could about the history of
costume, both from classes
and trial and error.
And of course there were er
rors. The story of a beautifully
fitting sleeve sewn into the
neckhole is Cleveland's favo
rite anecdote for despairing
students.
Cleveland also supervises
more experienced student
crews who work on the diffe
rent productions. The turnover
of people — and garments — is
as voluminous as the yardage
of an eighteenth-century cos
tume hanging idly in a corner.
Cleveland says she would
have "no way of telling" how
many thousands of costumes
gather dust in the costume
store below her workshop.

hunched over their sewing
machines.

The students are members of
a costume construction class
which Cleveland teaches with
Douglas Russell, a Drama De
partment faculty member and
costume designer for The Sea.
"By the time the students get
out of here," Cleveland says,
"they should be able to draft,
construct and finish a gar
ment."
She learned the same slow
way. Cleveland originally came
to Stanford to help out with the
costumes for a Ram's Head
student production. At that
time she only knew how to use
a sewing machine. Over the
years she learned everything
she could about the history of
costume, both from classes
and trial and error.
And of course there were er
rors. The story of a beautifully
fitting sleeve sewn into the
neckhole is Cleveland's favo
rite anecdote for despairing
students.
Cleveland also supervises
more experienced student
crews who work on the diffe
rent productions. The turnover
of people — and garments — is
as voluminous as the yardage
of an eighteenth-century cos
tume hanging idly in a corner.
Cleveland says she would
have "no way of telling" how
many thousands of costumes
gather dust in the costume
store below her workshop.
Perfection
With four weeks between
the beginning of the quarter
and the first dress rehearsal,
that adds up to a lot of braid to
be stitched, wigs to be curled,
bonnets, hats and bustles to be
constructed.
Everything must be perfect
— for the designer, the direc
tor, the actor, and of course
Cleveland herself. She clearly
loves her task. An extra show
last spring meant more work,
but she likes it that way.
"If I have time, I love to do it.
As a matter of fact you know,
it's much betterto keep busy."
Leaving the workshop and
the world of the nineteenth
century, the last glimpse is of
Barbara Cleveland cutting a
dress which in four weeks'
time will grace the stage of the
Little Theater as an elegant cos
tume.

Buried at the back of Memo
rial Auditorium is a large room
overcrowded with a wonderful
display of cloaks, wigs, model
ing busts, sewing machines,
delicate lace, feathers and
paste rubies.
At first sight, all appears to
be a big colorful chaos. But to
Barbara Cleveland, costume
technician for Stanford's
Drama Department, this is her
office, and the fake jewelry in
tiny drawers fills her filing
cabinet.
Cleveland is currently work
ing on the costumes for the
Drama Department's main
production this quarter. The
play is Edward Bond's The Sea,
which takes place in England in
the early 1900s. Performances
are Feb. 15-18, 21-25 in the Lit
tle Theater.
Corsets
"We have our corsets all cut
out and we're getting them put
together," Cleveland says with
evident joy, explaining that she
relishes the prospect of work
ing on costumes from this
period.
"Nineteen hundred is my
favorite period. I really think

the bustle period is lovely to
look at."
Thecostumes for The Sea are
of a slightly later period and
will not have bustles, but
bulges will be added in other
directions. Pouches will make
the student playing the Vicar
look as if he has been drinking
beer for the last four decades,
and pads have to be added to
sag an aged character's
bustline.
Cleveland finds changing
the shape of a person's body
one of the most interesting as
pects of her work. For a show
some years ago, built-up
shoulders had to be con
structed to give the appear
ance of a weird and wonderful
human being with no neck.
23 years
As she talks about the pro
ductions she has worked on in
her 23 years with the Drama
Department, the 44-year-old
costume technician refers
more often to the costumes
each play required than the
name of the play.
"Some shows with war
scenes are difficult," Cleve
land says. "A soldier has to be
beautiful in one scene, then

stagger back out of battle a few
moments later in rags and tat
ters. We make two garments.
Both have to be made so they
fit perfectly. Then we take one
and rip it apart."
More frustrating was a cos
tume for a music student in an
opera at Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium a few years ago.
Cleveland recalls fitting ses
sions at her home, and the
hours she worked to make the
folds in the dress hang per
fectly.
"I went to see the show —
and all we saw of the girl was
her face," Cleveland says with
a smile.
Usually Cleveland is not in
volved in costume design,
either for the main produc
tions, or for the one-act plays
directed by second-year Ph.D.
students each quarter.
"I think it's far better to have
someone else design,"' com
ments Cleveland. "That way
I'm free to do the supervising.
It's awfully hard to do both."
As she talks, Cleveland bus
tles around inspecting the
