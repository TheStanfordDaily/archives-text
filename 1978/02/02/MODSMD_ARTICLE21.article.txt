# Rain damage repaired

The heavy rains that poured down onto the
Bay Area recently left the campus strewn with
tree and ground damage.
To date the repair, which consists primarily of
clearing away fallen trees and cleaning storm
sewers in preparation for the next rain, has
come to less than $1000. Herb Fong, supervisor
of grounds, estimated that the total cost of repa
ration will be about $2000.
The total amount of rainwater that has fallen
this year is "about average — nothing unusual."
Damages ociirred as precipitation fell consis
tently over a long period of time.
Many trees were lost due to the combination
of wind and rain that gutted the campus inter
mittently for more than a month. The rain satu
rated the soil, and those trees without estab
lished root systems toppled with the force of the
wind. To prevent this from recurring, the trees

are being thinned so the wind will blow through
them rather than meeting their resistance.
The wood from the fallen trees will be kept by
the grounds maintenance department. There is
"difficulty keeping outsiders from stealing the
wood," Fong said.
The campus roads were alsc impaired since
the normal potholes were enlarged on account
of the storms.
"The water gets in and breaks up the asphalt,"
Fong said. "Compounded with the traffic
through these areas, the holes become larger
and deeper."
The road work will be included in the total
repairs which should be finished within two
weeks.
Although the rains were not severe," the
facilities storm sewers and drainage ditches
— are not large enough to accommodate that
volume of water," Fong said.
