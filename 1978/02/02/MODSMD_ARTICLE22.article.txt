## ballet/julianne koehne On new productions of the S.F.B. 
### 
Last Sunday the San Fran
cisco Ballet performed Filling
Station, first performed by
Balanchine's Ballet Caravan in
1938, and the first ballet to in
troduce American audiences
with a work completely em
phasizing native talent and
subject matter. It's about
comic strip characters at a gas
station and though it was an
important piece, well
thought-out, it no longer re
tains a raison d'etre.
It was said that Jew Christen
sen (now co-director of the S.F.
Ballet) received the title role
because he "needed suitable
roles in a heroic genre —
within developed American
balletic style." The composer,
Vergil Thomson, decided to
write a score. Vane Vest played
the attendant with amicable
jauntiness but our heroes are
no longer gas station atten
dants who rescue their cus
tomer from gangsters; they are
ballet dancers instead. Though
the company never satirizes
any work that they asked to
perform, their talents as dan
cers are best seen in other
works. Still, it is vital that the
San Francisco Ballet perform
older works not currently in
New York City Ballet Com
pany's repertoire; it's not that
their function is to be a secon
dary museum, because every
dance is always refracted
through the prism of a particu
lar company's style.
Last Sunday, ending the sec
ond week of their season, they
also performed Moves, (1959)
by Jerome Robbins, with such
ferocious bite and self
conscious vulnerability that it
is one of their signature roles.
Robbins managed to isolate,
abstract, and then intensify a
series of human encounters
with candid accuracy and little
regard for courteous conven
tion.
Part of its excitement comes
from the pace of the action; it
eddies, whirls, spurts, and
then quite unexpectedly
crashed in on our conscious
recognition. During the finale
one person darts into the
center of the stage, followed
by another and another, each
one groping in a different di
rection. They are all together,
very close but they don't see
each other, even when they
walk around like blind bugs
searching with antenna-like
arms over their heads. It is not
until they form a line across the
back of the stage and approach

us with accusing, mirroring
palms that we feel self
conscious, somehow uneasy.
Ballet seems to develop in a
widening gyre; it circles but
never returns to exactly the
same place. La Fille Mai Cardee
(1789) was the first ballet to
deal with real people, not
mythological creatures, and,
then Concerto Barocco (1940)
was one of the first ballets to
disregard human emotions
and to instead emphasize the
music's tempo and texture.
Concerto Barocco was pre
sented the first week of the
Company's season; instead of
NYCB's black leotards with lit
tle skirts the SF Ballet wore all
white which makes it seem less
taut and wintry, more seraphic.
Because the dance does not
exactly synchronize with the
music, we notice each of them
more and anyway, more im
portantly, it is the quality of
fine frenzy within a closed
space in Baroque music that
Balanchine achieves.
La Fille Mai Cardee (The
Badly Guarded Daughter) is a
Rococo representation of Sir
Frederick Ashton's (of the
Royal Ballet) English version of
pastel French peasant life on

the eve of the Revolution. It is
one of Ashton's finest pieces
still in the Royal's repertory.
Though hardly anyone is
naughty or wicked anymore
(the protagonist's, Lise, only
vice is her love for a bright
country boy), there are phallic
symbols, occasionally, like
maypoles with fruit on top,
butterchurns, and the um
brella the stupid rich boy rides.
The curtain opens on a
backdrop: a semi-nude draped
is on one side, a dove pulling
the painted curtains, the
bucolic symbols of bliss: wine,
bread, scythe and a plow
amidst the countryside.
Roosters dance raucously,
and (Lise) Anita Paciotti enters
and turns on one leg, the other
bent at her calf, and after every
small turn, a pink ribbon that
she holds in her hand ripples
after her. The corps is hearty,
happy peasantry, each one as
exuberant as if alone; this is
one manifestation of the great
care that has been taken in re
storing this ballet. Lise and
Colas (Tomm Ruud), her true
love, play a game of horsey
with another pink ribbon.
There is difficulty — a storm —
but finally the lovers unite.

Paciotti is unusual in that she
doesn't overdo her role as
mischief-making daughter.
She is more fluid in her solo
than many Royal Ballet princi
pals; though the footwork may
not be as intricate, she seems
far more spontaneous, re
laxed, and younger.
Smuin's Mass in C Minor
premiered this season; the
dancers as well as the SF Sym
phony Chorus drew a deserved
standing ovation and bravos.
The dancer's movements are
either low, touching the
ground, or directed upwards
offering themselves to God.
Laurie Cowden was the only
dancer with a trance-like, al
most medieval mysticism and it
is this supernatural other
worldly quality that all must
have. Smuin's gestures of wor
ship and offering are so bold
that, without the choir, the
dancers alone should shock us
with their intensity.
At the end, during the cum
sancto spiritu, 24 dancers'
white and golden legs re
peatedly move sideways or in
very tight, gathering steps;
against the black backdrop a
thousand candles flickered last
Sunday afternoon.
