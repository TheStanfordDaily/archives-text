## 'Portrait': a basic sense 
### 
Joseph Stick's "A Portrait of
the Artist as a Young Man" is
more notable for what it
doesn't do than for what it
does. This literate and tasteful
version of the lames Joyce au
tobiographical novel does not
pander to the usual Hollywood
treatment of classic novels (i.e.
established stars, simplified
dialogue, changes in em
phasis). "Portrait" is not a big
budget, epic recreation.
Tough subject
Instead, "Portrait" is a small
scale, simple and direct
cinematic version of an incred
ibly tough subject. It is no acci
dent that Joyce has rarely.been
transferred to film. His "stream
of consciousness" style pre
sents the same problems
Faulkner does for filmmakers;
problems such as interpreta
tion and trying to convey word
images through visual means.
The films made from Joyce
novels have been, up to now,
unremarkable. Stick's own
"Ulysses," made 10 years ago,
is a case in point. "Ulysses" isa
respectable work, -but the
words and symbolism of the

novel are almost impossible to
translate into film, and the
movie was stilted and superfi
cial.
To a lesser extent, "Portrait"
has the same problems "Ulys
ses" had; for one thing, it suf
fers at times from lack of
energy. The movie explores
the passions of the young artist
Stephen Dedalus' (a character
who represents Joyce) mind as
he grows up. But Strick doesn't
totally convey the feeling, the
emotion of the tortured
Stephen's early life , the ban
kruptcy of his family; the re
ligious battles between his de
vout mother and cynical father
which cause sexual repression
and anxiety in Stephen.
Good intentions
Strick, with admirable inten
tions, also uses a largely un
known Irish cast with the film
set almost entirely in Ireland),
rather than name stars. But
their acting is only adequate.
John Cielgud, in a cameo as a
preacher and T.P. McKenna as
Stephen's father Simon rise
above the rest of the cast and
give strong, sure professional

performances. Bosco Hogan,
as Stephen, gives a studied
performance; but he's too
tight, too stiff; he should
loosen up a bit.
All the same, Strick should
be complimented for doing
this project at all, and for being
as successful as he is with it.
"Portrait," despite its flaws,
conveys a basic sense of the
Joyce novel — a remarkable
achievement.
Brimstone
There is one scene where the
movie captures Joyce per
fectly. John Gielgud delivers a
fire and brimstone sermon the
nature of sin and Hell with such
force that it moves Stephen
deeply and almost pushes him
into priesthood. If Strick had
gone all the way with the rest of
the film as he does in this
scene, he would have created a
masterwork.
As it stands, "Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man" is a
praiseworthy and worthwhile
attempt, and everyone in
volved (especially Joe Strick,
with his artist's integrity still in
tact) should be commended
for it.

with his artist's integrity still in
tact) should be commended
for it.
Joseph Stick's "A Portrait of
the Artist as a Young Man" is
more notable for what it
doesn't do than for what it
does. This literate and tasteful
version of the lames Joyce au
tobiographical novel does not
pander to the usual Hollywood
treatment of classic novels (i.e.
established stars, simplified
dialogue, changes in em
phasis). "Portrait" is not a big
budget, epic recreation.
Tough subject
Instead, "Portrait" is a small
scale, simple and direct
cinematic version of an incred
ibly tough subject. It is no acci
dent that Joyce has rarely.been
transferred to film. His "stream
of consciousness" style pre
sents the same problems
Faulkner does for filmmakers;
problems such as interpreta
tion and trying to convey word
images through visual means.
The films made from Joyce
novels have been, up to now,
unremarkable. Stick's own
"Ulysses," made 10 years ago,
is a case in point. "Ulysses" isa
respectable work, -but the
words and symbolism of the

novel are almost impossible to
translate into film, and the
movie was stilted and superfi
cial.
To a lesser extent, "Portrait"
has the same problems "Ulys
ses" had; for one thing, it suf
fers at times from lack of
energy. The movie explores
the passions of the young artist
Stephen Dedalus' (a character
who represents Joyce) mind as
he grows up. But Strick doesn't
totally convey the feeling, the
emotion of the tortured
Stephen's early life , the ban
kruptcy of his family; the re
ligious battles between his de
vout mother and cynical father
which cause sexual repression
and anxiety in Stephen.
Good intentions
Strick, with admirable inten
tions, also uses a largely un
known Irish cast with the film
set almost entirely in Ireland),
rather than name stars. But
their acting is only adequate.
John Cielgud, in a cameo as a
preacher and T.P. McKenna as
Stephen's father Simon rise
above the rest of the cast and
give strong, sure professional

performances. Bosco Hogan,
as Stephen, gives a studied
performance; but he's too
tight, too stiff; he should
loosen up a bit.
All the same, Strick should
be complimented for doing
this project at all, and for being
as successful as he is with it.
"Portrait," despite its flaws,
conveys a basic sense of the
Joyce novel — a remarkable
achievement.
Brimstone
There is one scene where the
movie captures Joyce per
fectly. John Gielgud delivers a
fire and brimstone sermon the
nature of sin and Hell with such
force that it moves Stephen
deeply and almost pushes him
into priesthood. If Strick had
gone all the way with the rest of
the film as he does in this
scene, he would have created a
masterwork.
As it stands, "Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man" is a
praiseworthy and worthwhile
attempt, and everyone in
volved (especially Joe Strick,
with his artist's integrity still in
tact) should be commended
for it.
