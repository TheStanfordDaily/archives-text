The 20-odd students in the Stanford |azz ensemble have next to nothing in common. They are
students, yes, and jazz maniacs with a craving for prolonged exposure to the medium; other than that
they are as similar as a tennis ball and a banana.
But never mind that. The Stanford Jazz Ensemble, under the direction of Bruce Pennycock, is really
rather good. They travel to major jazz festivals in the area, and they will be performing in Berkeley in
March â€” most importantly they will be in Dinkelspiel this Saturday at 8 p.m. They will play a
program divided into two parts. The first will feature the traditional jazz of the big-band era; and the
second will be devoted to contemporary works.
Its free.
