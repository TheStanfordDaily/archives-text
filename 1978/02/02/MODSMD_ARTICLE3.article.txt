# Alumni nominees slated for election to fill Board of Trustees
## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
Eight alumni have been chosen to
run for four vacancies on the Univer
sity's Board of Trustees, the Stanford
Alumni Almanac has reported.
Elections will take place this
spring.
Candidates this year include Nel
son Dong, Joyce Kobayashi, Philip
Taubman, W. lames Ware, William
Kartozian, Barbara Maxwell, John
Packard and Edith Weiss.
The nominating committee, con
sisting of 13 members appointed by
the Alumni Executive Board, started
reviewing all candidate applications
last fall. About 100 persons applied.
Candidates for the trustee posi
tions filled out an application stating
their services to the University as
alumni, present formal study, club
affiliations, community services and
honors received here.
Candidates also wrote essays and
included references in their applica
tions.
The nominating committee mem
bers then read the applications, and,
in three consecutive weekends, read
applications and checked refer
ences.
Elections take place every two
years and elected board members
serve a four-year term.
"People occasionally hear com
ments to the effect that the Board of

Trustees is all chosen under the con
trol of the present board. Vet this
mechanism does exist for alumni to
participate in the highest level of the
University by choosing alumni rep
resentative to serve on the board,"
said William Stone, director of the
alumni association.
Clark Sterling, student representa
tive to the nominating committee,
said, "I don't know if this process
appeases the students, but the diver
sity it creates on the board helps."
Although there is no requirement
for the number of years passed since
the alumnus attended the University,
most nominees have graduated over
five years ago. This is because the
nominating committee wants to slate
candidates who have a chance to be
elected, according to Sterling.
"The longer an alumnus is out of
school, the more contact he has with
other alumni, who comprise the vot
ing population," Sterling explained.
Sterling further expressed that this
system is very "pleasing" because
many different types of people are
considered, and "not just the Board
of Trustees stereotype."
Reflecting the alumni population,
four of the candidates are age 35 or
younger, while the other four are age
36 or older. "This makes for a
broadened composition of the
Board," Stone commented. "Stu

dents may not believe a 29- or 30-year
old can express their views but they
may be surprised," Sterling claimed.
The voters, who must have at
tended the University for three quar
ters and cannot be present Stanford
students, vote for two candidates in
each age group.
When asked his predictions for the
outcome of the election, Stone re
marked, "We can never tell be
forehand because all the candidates
are so strong."
The elected board members func
tion as any other trustee, and are not
treated any differently. In fact, after
serving alumni terms, some board
members have been appointed to
serve additional terms.
Stone lamented that the numberof
eligible voters who exercise their vot
ing right is decreasing. In 1974 only
19 per cent of the eligible voters ac
tually voted, and in 1976 this figure
decreased to 17 per cent. However,
Stone comments, "This low percen
tage of voting is not particular to
Stanford. Still, the concern of the
alumni has diminished."
During the late '60s and early '70s
there was greater alumni concern,
probably due to the Vietnam War,
but, said Stone, "The answer to
building up the vote is not to create
controversy."
