Carter: U.S. to defend Canal
Washington — President )immy Carter said
yesterday night he would not hesitate to send
U.S. troops to defend the Panama Canal —
"and I have no doubt that even in sustained
combat we would be successful."
But Carter said the treaty to yield control of
the waterway to Panama in the year 2000 would
diminish the risk of any need for armed inter
vention to defend it.
In a nationally broadcast and televised
"fireside chat,"the second in his year-old
presidency, Carter said approval of the treaty is
"in the highest national interest of the United
States and will strengthen our position in the
world."
He said opposition to the treaty, due to
come up for debate in the Senate next week,
"is based on misunderstanding and misinfor
mation."
Labor Dept. sues Teamsters
Washington — Teamsters President Frank
Fitzsimmons and 18 other former officials of
the union's troubled Central States Pension
Fund were sued yesterday in a Labor Depart
ment effort to recover millions of dollars in
allegedly bad loans.
They were accused of having "caused great
financial harm" to the $1.7 billion fund and its
480,000 beneficiaries through "a series of
questionable loan transactions."
Some of the loans were made to individuals
linked to organized crime and were used to
finance gambling casinos, race tracks and risky
real estate ventures, government officials said.
Fitzsimmons issued a statement saying he
would appear in court"and fully answer the
charges with every confidence that my per
formance as a trustee has met the highest
fiduciary standards."
The Labor Department's civil suit, filed in
U.S. District Court in Chicago, culminated a
massive investigation of the Central States
fund begun in 1975 following reports of mis
management and alleged ties to organized
crime. It was the largest action ever brought
under the 1975 federal pension reform law.

Israeli oranges poisoned
The Hague, The Netherlands — Western
Europe issued an alert yesterday for Israeli
grown oranges poisoned with mercury in a
purported Arab-Palestinian scheme to sabot
age Israel's economy.
U.S. government officials said there was no
evidence that any of the tainted fruit had
reached the United States, and the Israeli Em
bassy in Washington claimed none of the
oranges were for sale in U.S. stores.
The Dutch and German governments said
they received identical letters pinning respon
sibility on "The Arab Revolutionary Army
Palestinian Commando.'
A PLO spokesperson in Beirut said he had
never heard of the group and called the re
ports "a mischievous propaganda ploy.'
The letters, mailed from Stuttgart, West
Germany, and dated )an. 21, warned officials:
"It is not our aim to kill the population, but to
sabotage the Israeli economy which is based
on suppression, racial discrimination and col
onial occupation."
UMW ties own strike record
Charleston, W.Va. — The strike by 160,000
United Mine Workers (UAW) members goes
into its 59th day today, tying a record for the
union's longest nationwide walkout as it drains
the nation's energy reserves and evokes
memories of the longest strike of the past.
Even if a settlement is reached immediately,
the walkout will set a new record, because the
UMW ratification process requires 10 days.
The issues are similar to those in 1946, the
year a 59-day walkout won the union a pay
increase and its first health and welfare fund.
Today, too, the miners want better wages
and health and pension benefits. Meanwhile,
as in 1946, their strike has cut the nation's coal
production and is creating energy shortages.
The terms under discussion when negotia
tions broke off have not been made public, but
a previous company proposal would have
boosted wages, now ranging from $6.25 to
$7.80 an hour, by $1.53 over 40 months.

The meeting in Sadat's Nile-side villa in Giza
"provided the opportunity for a broad review
of a full range ot issues'' that the Egyptian
leader will be discussing with President |immy
Carter this weekend, an American spokesper
son said.
The Egyptians have indicated they would
welcome a U.S. proposal to unlock the appa
rent stalemate on the issues of Israeli with
drawal and the Palestinians.
Carter said a Mideast settlement should be
based on establishing normal relations bet
ween the Arab states and Israel, Israeli with
drawal to 1967 boundaries, and a role for the
Palestinians in determining their future.
States want program control
Washington — The nation's governors say
state governments must be granted greater
control over federal urban programs or Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's urban policy will be
"doomed to failure."
Carter's still-evolving urban strategy cannot
succeed unless states abandon policies that
contribute to suburban sprawl, according to
Gov. Michael Dukakis ot Massachusetts.
The plan being pushed by the influential Na
tional Governors' Association would rely on a
system of federal incentives for states which
coordinate and target federal money to dis
tressed areas.
The states could direct aid to all areas in
distress instead of simply focusing on large
hardship cities.
The state-incentive concept is certain to be
resisted by many big-city mayors who have had
a lifetime of bad experiences in rural
dominated legislatures, but sources say it has
won favor at the White House.
Heart patient care cited
Boston—Many heart attack patients could
safely be sent home from the hospital after one
week instead of the current average of more
than two weeks, aiding their psychological re
covery and saving the nation $360 million in
medical costs annually, a study says.

Besides having smaller medical bills, the
heart attack victims will be psychologically bet
ter able to resume their normal lives if they
spend less time in hospitals, concluded the
study, which was conducted at the Duke Uni
versity Medical Center. It was published in to
day's issue of the New England lournal of
Medicine.
According to a national survey, 394,000
Americans have heart attacks each year. If 45
per cent — 177,300 — were discharged after
one week, the researchers estimate this would
save $360 million annually.
Grocery prices higher
The first month of the new year brought
higher bills to grocery shoppers who found a
widespread and predicted boost in the cost of
hamburger along with scattered increases in
the prices of other items, an Associated Press
marketbasket survey shows.
The AP survey showed that the total bill for
14 commonly purchased food and nonfood
products priced at one supermarket in each of
13 cities rose an average of 1.2 per cent during
lanuary. That compared with a 2.3 per cent
boost in December.
The latest survey showed the marketbasket
bill rose at the checklist store in nine cities last
month, up an average of 2.8 per cent. The bill
dropped in four cities, down an average of 1.7
per cent.
Dow Jones up 4.42
New York — The stock market bounced back
from the jolt of U.S. Steel's dividend reduction
to post a broad gain yesterday in the heaviest

The Dow (ones average of 30 industrials
gained 4.42 points to 774.34.
