# Hospital awards privileges; physician agrees to end lawsuit
## 
### Andrea James 
Dr. William Hayden has agreed to
drop his lawsuit against Stanford
Hospital, and consequently, he will
be recommended for appointment
to the medical staff.
Hayden, a Palo Alto radiologist,
filed suit against the Hospital last
March claiming he was denied a fair
hearing before the board of hospital
directors when he applied for mem
bership on the hospital staff and re
quested privileges in the division of
diagnostic radiology.
The agreement with the hospital
directors was ratified Tuesday, about
a week before extensive hearings
were scheduled on the Hayden is
sues. Last November, a superior
court judge ruled that Hayden be
granted a hearing before the board.
Under the agreed settlement,
Hayden will receive certain clinical
privileges after his professional
competence is certified by the Hos
pital's Credentials Committee and
Medical Board.
Hayden will cooperate in de
partmental research and will teach
students, interns, residents and fel
lows as requested by the Department
of Radiology.
Hayden was originally denied ac
cess to the medical staff because of
the hospital's "closed staff rule," ac
cording to Cale Mondry, assistant
counsel for medical affairs.
)ohn Schwartz, University coun
sel, said the closed staff rule means
"the staff is not open to every physi
cian wanting to be on the staff. Par

ticipating community physicians
have to meet certain conditions to be
admitted."
He declined to detail those condi
tions.
Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the
School of Medicine, said the board
"wants to reassess the closed staff
rules in all Hospital-based services,
including pathology, anesthesiology
and radiology."
He added, however, that the board
wants to perform this reassessment
"outside the context of an adversa
rial hearing."

The board issued a statement say
ing it would not accept applications
for hospital privileges until its review
of the closed staff issue is completed
which it estimated will be in about
four months.
"The issue of a closed staff is cru
cial to the people and doctors of Palo
Alto," Hayden has said. "It concerns
the right of the physician to practice
medicine and the right of the people
to pick the doctor they want as op
posed to a system of doctor of the
day.' "
