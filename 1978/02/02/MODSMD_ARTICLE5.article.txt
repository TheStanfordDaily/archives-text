# ERB busy finishing final election report
## 
### Rob Lempert 
The Election Review Board's report
on last quarter's ASSU Senate cam
paign irregularities has been de
layed, but is due to come out some
time this month.
The report was to be completed
last quarter, said Senate Chairperson
Fred Crethel, but the massive
amount of paperwork involved
caused the delay. Dave Carlson, ERB
member, said the report is still in the
hands of the five individual board
members.
They could not start writing until
the minutes of the ERB's proceedings
had been checked and typed,
Carlson said.
Carlson said he only received his
five-pound package of minutes a
week and a half ago.
Carlson said the ERB "feels bad
about taking so long'' and that it
hopes to have the report out by the
end of February. Grethel said he has
not put too much pressure on them
to finish the report because when
writing without notes, "there is only
so much they can do."
The report will contain recom
mended revisions of the election
process to avoid similar problems in
the future. Once it is finished, the
report will either be simply read to
the Senate or ERB members will first
meet with COP members and
selected senators to discuss the

proposals, said ERB member Deric
Jennings.
The Senate will use the ERB report,
as well as that of their Rules Commit
tee and the elections commissioner
to consider future election reform,
Grethel said.
Jennings said each member of the
ERB will write sections of the report,
which he will combine before the
final draft is turned in to be typed.
The introduction will contain a dis
cussion of the problems the ERB con
fronted and procedures it used in its
investigation, Jennings said. r
The last part of the report will in
clude a review of the general issues
and "problems that gave rise to the
situation," Jennings said.
Problems included the absence of
specific rules for the election pro
cess, lack of communication with
those involved and a strict time limit,
according to Jennings.
Another section is "a review of var
ious alternatives that we (ERR) talked
about considered," and will con
tain the board's recommendations
for election reform.
The third section will consider
what. Jennings called "minor adjust
ments and needed definitions within
the current system" while the last
section is a "fundamental set of re
commendations that deal much
more with the basic system."
