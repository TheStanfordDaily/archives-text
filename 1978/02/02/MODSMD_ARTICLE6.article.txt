# Hours, notoriety cited
## Encina's beer sales uncommon 
### James Petrila 
Six months ago, after several years of struggle with
opposition and bureaucratic procedures, beer became
available for public consumption in Encina Commons.
Since that time, The Commons has been something less
than a Mecca for suds seekers on the Stanford campus.
For example, this reporter was only the tenth person
to plunk down 35 cents for a frosty glass-full of Olympia
or Olympia dark yesterday afternoon.
One employee of The Commons estimated average
sale of beer to be "around 20 glasses a day." She expres
sed surprise that more people did not frequent The
Commons.
Insufficient communication
A basic problem for the sale of beer has been "insuffi
cient communication. We haven't succeeded in getting
the word out," according to George Elliott, director of
food services for TDS, the firm that runs The Commons
as well as the Coffee House, Transition and the Poli Sci
Lounge.
The Commons has retained the same hours as in its
pre-beer selling days, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Beer has been sold
essentially as a lunch item to complement pizza or
sandwiches.

Several "happy hours'' have been held on Thursdays
and Fridays but Elliott said "insufficient publicity and
inconsistency in scheduling" were primary causes of the
"less than overwhelming" response.
Expanded hours
Some students have expressed interests expanding
hours at The Commons, Elliott added. Proposals include
opening The Commons evenings from 8 to 11.
' Elliott said that if hours are expanded, a trial period of
several weeks would be initiated in March or April to see
if response is favorable.
Before attempting to change business times, the TDS
will consider menu changes and try to decide whether
business will sufficiently support expanded hours.
On-going evaluation
Examination of the beer-selling experiment at The
Commons is only part of an on-going evaluation of the
total food service picture, Elliott added. The possibility
of'selling beer at the Coffee House has not been elimi
nated from TDS planning.
Should such a decision be made, it would be neces
sary to "go through the whole process of obtaining a
license once again. But it that is what is needed, and is
what it takes," an attempt to obtain a license will be
made, Elliott said.
