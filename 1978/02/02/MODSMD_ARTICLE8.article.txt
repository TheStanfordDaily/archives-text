# 'Western' Civ too limited
## 
### 
Nicholas Benes

Ves, that is what I would like to
know. Why should this university in
stitute a specifically Western Civ re
quirement? The whole idea shocks
my senses. No one would argue that
the study of civilization is not impor
tant for mankind, and no one could
argue that western civilization is not
a vital area for this study; but likewise
no one could claim that Asian, or
Near Eastern, or African civilization is
of no importance.
Several months ago at a meeting in
Stern Hall with members of the
Western Culture Task Force, I argued
against limiting the proposed civili
zation requirement to the "western"
area. Why not simply have a civ re
quirement and stipulate that the stu
dent concentrate in one of perhaps
four subdivisions under that head
ing?
For instance, a minimum of three
courses in Western, Eastern, African,
or American civilization fields might
be required. At that time, as still is
the case, the members of the task
force raised several objections to jus
tify a solely western requirement:
Objections
(1) Western culture affects our
lives more than say, Asian culture; or
in the words of the recently printed
task force statement, it has "shaped
our society." What a marvelous gen
eral statement. Obviously, it all de
pends on which society one chooses
to represent "our society," and what
aspects of that society one analyzes.
To a resident of Chinatown whose
parents are first-generation immig
rants, the task force's opinion is an
extremely debatable one. Well, we
haven't many students of that sort of
background here at Stanford, have
we? To which I reply that I could
sympathize with such a person; my
own father is a first-generation im
migrant from Czechoslovakia.
What about those different aspects
of society that can be analyzed? Se
eing that the world is daily becoming
more international, and in accor
dance with our president's policy of
human rights, (which I assume must
include the 14th Amendment, since
the Constitution is a vital Western
document), I define the society to be
the modern world.
Let's look at that society from the
standpoint of population. After all,
civilization is the study of organized
mankind. Roughly speaking, the
population of Asia is double that of
the "western" world. Let's look at it
from the standpoint of gross national

product (CNP). Japan is now the
world's second largest free-world
economy, and the CNP of China may
be greater than that of Britain.
Let's look at it from your
standpoint. The car you drove to
school in today might be Japanese;
the cloth of the pants you're wearing
might have been produced in
Taiwan; the loudspeaker piping in
your music may be Korean or
Japanese; and chances are the gas
you bought yesterday came from
Asia or the Middle East. The very
paper you read now has been pro
duced using a concept developed in
China. It's rather thought provoking
to ruminate on the fact that perhaps
the greater part of recorded Western
Civilization has been printed using
an Asian invention.
Definitional disease
(2) Lack of a requirement has led to
an "impoverishment of the intellec
tual horizons of our graduates."
Again, this statement is afflicted by a
definitional disease, one that seems
to stem from the fact that the task
force members are almost exclu
sively west-oriented. The task force
has defined intellectual knowledge
to be knowledge of the West. If this is
so, I truly wonder what role the Black
Studies, Asian Languages, East Asian
Studies, or Chicano Studies program
fulfill. Do these topics now become
"non-intellectual"? Actually, if
forced to define "intellect," I would
say that the driving curiosity which
makes a person continuously batter
down the walls surrounding his
greatest ignorance should at least fi
gure high on the list of characteris
tics.
Since Asian, African, or Middle
Eastern culture and civilization is
clearly to my view the area of the
most abysmal ignorance among the
students of this university, I might
even argue in favor of a non-Western
Civ requirement. Quite honestly, I
am surprised the various ethnic
groups on campus have not actively
protested this brazen insult to their
backgrounds; after reading this col
umn, I hope some of them will.
Alternatives
(3) "Understanding some aspects
of the past that have not so obviously
shaped the present can expand our
conception of the possible, making
us aware of alternatives to the con
temporary and the immediately
applicable." How I chuckled when I
read this absurd sentence, and saw
how the task force had dug its own

grave. If it's "alternatives" or "the
possible" that you seek, it's good
common sense to quit hanging
around your back door and head for
new places. If it's a long traditional
past you want, you should leave
Europe and strike out for Egypt, In
dia, or China.
My own field is Japanese politics.
In that study I have spent nearly one
and a half years out of the last four in
Japan, during which time my mind
was expanded far faster and further
than it ever did here. I value the new
perspective gained from my depar
ture from my own cultural cocoon (of
which Europe is a part) more than
anything else I have profited from at
Stanford, and I do not wish to see this
requirement deny the same experi
ence tootherstudents. Rather, I wish
to see a civilization requirement that
will open up further opportunities
like mine, fairly and justly.
The statement recently published
in the Daily describing the proposed
requirement claimed that, "Western
culture is not the sole property of
some single contemporary ethnic
group." This may be true, but it
surely is overwhelmingly the sole
property of a race that is normally
classified in this country as "white."

Let's look at it from your
standpoint. The car you drove to
school in today might be Japanese;
the cloth of the pants you're wearing
might have been produced in
Taiwan; the loudspeaker piping in
your music may be Korean or
Japanese; and chances are the gas
you bought yesterday came from
Asia or the Middle East. The very
paper you read now has been pro
duced using a concept developed in
China. It's rather thought provoking
to ruminate on the fact that perhaps
the greater part of recorded Western
Civilization has been printed using
an Asian invention.
Definitional disease
(2) Lack of a requirement has led to
an "impoverishment of the intellec
tual horizons of our graduates."
Again, this statement is afflicted by a
definitional disease, one that seems
to stem from the fact that the task
force members are almost exclu
sively west-oriented. The task force
has defined intellectual knowledge
to be knowledge of the West. If this is
so, I truly wonder what role the Black
Studies, Asian Languages, East Asian
Studies, or Chicano Studies program
fulfill. Do these topics now become
"non-intellectual"? Actually, if
forced to define "intellect," I would
say that the driving curiosity which
makes a person continuously batter
down the walls surrounding his
greatest ignorance should at least fi
gure high on the list of characteris
tics.
Since Asian, African, or Middle
Eastern culture and civilization is
clearly to my view the area of the
most abysmal ignorance among the
students of this university, I might
even argue in favor of a non-Western
Civ requirement. Quite honestly, I
am surprised the various ethnic
groups on campus have not actively
protested this brazen insult to their
backgrounds; after reading this col
umn, I hope some of them will.
Alternatives
(3) "Understanding some aspects
of the past that have not so obviously
shaped the present can expand our
conception of the possible, making
us aware of alternatives to the con
temporary and the immediately
applicable." How I chuckled when I
read this absurd sentence, and saw
how the task force had dug its own

grave. If it's "alternatives" or "the
possible" that you seek, it's good
common sense to quit hanging
around your back door and head for
new places. If it's a long traditional
past you want, you should leave
Europe and strike out for Egypt, In
dia, or China.
My own field is Japanese politics.
In that study I have spent nearly one
and a half years out of the last four in
Japan, during which time my mind
was expanded far faster and further
than it ever did here. I value the new
perspective gained from my depar
ture from my own cultural cocoon (of
which Europe is a part) more than
anything else I have profited from at
Stanford, and I do not wish to see this
requirement deny the same experi
ence tootherstudents. Rather, I wish
to see a civilization requirement that
will open up further opportunities
like mine, fairly and justly.
The statement recently published
in the Daily describing the proposed
requirement claimed that, "Western
culture is not the sole property of
some single contemporary ethnic
group." This may be true, but it
surely is overwhelmingly the sole
property of a race that is normally
classified in this country as "white."

Ves, that is what I would like to
know. Why should this university in
stitute a specifically Western Civ re
quirement? The whole idea shocks
my senses. No one would argue that
the study of civilization is not impor
tant for mankind, and no one could
argue that western civilization is not
a vital area for this study; but likewise
no one could claim that Asian, or
Near Eastern, or African civilization is
of no importance.
Several months ago at a meeting in
Stern Hall with members of the
Western Culture Task Force, I argued
against limiting the proposed civili
zation requirement to the "western"
area. Why not simply have a civ re
quirement and stipulate that the stu
dent concentrate in one of perhaps
four subdivisions under that head
ing?
For instance, a minimum of three
courses in Western, Eastern, African,
or American civilization fields might
be required. At that time, as still is
the case, the members of the task
force raised several objections to jus
tify a solely western requirement:
Objections
(1) Western culture affects our
lives more than say, Asian culture; or
in the words of the recently printed
task force statement, it has "shaped
our society." What a marvelous gen
eral statement. Obviously, it all de
pends on which society one chooses
to represent "our society," and what
aspects of that society one analyzes.
To a resident of Chinatown whose
parents are first-generation immig
rants, the task force's opinion is an
extremely debatable one. Well, we
haven't many students of that sort of
background here at Stanford, have
we? To which I reply that I could
sympathize with such a person; my
own father is a first-generation im
migrant from Czechoslovakia.
What about those different aspects
of society that can be analyzed? Se
eing that the world is daily becoming
more international, and in accor
dance with our president's policy of
human rights, (which I assume must
include the 14th Amendment, since
the Constitution is a vital Western
document), I define the society to be
the modern world.
Let's look at that society from the
standpoint of population. After all,
civilization is the study of organized
mankind. Roughly speaking, the
population of Asia is double that of
the "western" world. Let's look at it
from the standpoint of gross national

product (CNP). Japan is now the
world's second largest free-world
economy, and the CNP of China may
be greater than that of Britain.

and a half years out of the last four in
Japan, during which time my mind
was expanded far faster and further
than it ever did here. I value the new
perspective gained from my depar
ture from my own cultural cocoon (of
which Europe is a part) more than
anything else I have profited from at
Stanford, and I do not wish to see this
requirement deny the same experi
ence tootherstudents. Rather, I wish
to see a civilization requirement that
will open up further opportunities
like mine, fairly and justly.
The statement recently published
in the Daily describing the proposed
requirement claimed that, "Western
culture is not the sole property of
some single contemporary ethnic
group." This may be true, but it
surely is overwhelmingly the sole
property of a race that is normally
classified in this country as "white."

Ves, that is what I would like to
know. Why should this university in
stitute a specifically Western Civ re
quirement? The whole idea shocks
my senses. No one would argue that
the study of civilization is not impor
tant for mankind, and no one could
argue that western civilization is not
a vital area for this study; but likewise
no one could claim that Asian, or
Near Eastern, or African civilization is
of no importance.
Several months ago at a meeting in
Stern Hall with members of the
Western Culture Task Force, I argued
against limiting the proposed civili
zation requirement to the "western"
area. Why not simply have a civ re
quirement and stipulate that the stu
dent concentrate in one of perhaps
four subdivisions under that head
ing?
For instance, a minimum of three
courses in Western, Eastern, African,
or American civilization fields might
be required. At that time, as still is
the case, the members of the task
force raised several objections to jus
tify a solely western requirement:
Objections
(1) Western culture affects our
lives more than say, Asian culture; or
in the words of the recently printed
task force statement, it has "shaped
our society." What a marvelous gen
eral statement. Obviously, it all de
pends on which society one chooses
to represent "our society," and what
aspects of that society one analyzes.
To a resident of Chinatown whose
parents are first-generation immig
rants, the task force's opinion is an
extremely debatable one. Well, we
haven't many students of that sort of
background here at Stanford, have
we? To which I reply that I could
sympathize with such a person; my
own father is a first-generation im
migrant from Czechoslovakia.
What about those different aspects
of society that can be analyzed? Se
eing that the world is daily becoming
more international, and in accor
dance with our president's policy of
human rights, (which I assume must
include the 14th Amendment, since
the Constitution is a vital Western
document), I define the society to be
the modern world.
Let's look at that society from the
standpoint of population. After all,
civilization is the study of organized
mankind. Roughly speaking, the
population of Asia is double that of
the "western" world. Let's look at it
from the standpoint of gross national

product (CNP). Japan is now the
world's second largest free-world
economy, and the CNP of China may
be greater than that of Britain.
Let's look at it from your
standpoint. The car you drove to
school in today might be Japanese;
the cloth of the pants you're wearing
might have been produced in
Taiwan; the loudspeaker piping in
your music may be Korean or
Japanese; and chances are the gas
you bought yesterday came from
Asia or the Middle East. The very
paper you read now has been pro
duced using a concept developed in
China. It's rather thought provoking
to ruminate on the fact that perhaps
the greater part of recorded Western
Civilization has been printed using
an Asian invention.
Definitional disease
(2) Lack of a requirement has led to
an "impoverishment of the intellec
tual horizons of our graduates."
Again, this statement is afflicted by a
definitional disease, one that seems
to stem from the fact that the task
force members are almost exclu
sively west-oriented. The task force
has defined intellectual knowledge
to be knowledge of the West. If this is
so, I truly wonder what role the Black
Studies, Asian Languages, East Asian
Studies, or Chicano Studies program
fulfill. Do these topics now become
"non-intellectual"? Actually, if
forced to define "intellect," I would
say that the driving curiosity which
makes a person continuously batter
down the walls surrounding his
greatest ignorance should at least fi
gure high on the list of characteris
tics.
Since Asian, African, or Middle
Eastern culture and civilization is
clearly to my view the area of the
most abysmal ignorance among the
students of this university, I might
even argue in favor of a non-Western
Civ requirement. Quite honestly, I
am surprised the various ethnic
groups on campus have not actively
protested this brazen insult to their
backgrounds; after reading this col
umn, I hope some of them will.
Alternatives
(3) "Understanding some aspects
of the past that have not so obviously
shaped the present can expand our
conception of the possible, making
us aware of alternatives to the con
temporary and the immediately
applicable." How I chuckled when I
read this absurd sentence, and saw
how the task force had dug its own

grave. If it's "alternatives" or "the
possible" that you seek, it's good
common sense to quit hanging
around your back door and head for
new places. If it's a long traditional
past you want, you should leave
Europe and strike out for Egypt, In
dia, or China.

In that study I have spent nearly one
and a half years out of the last four in
