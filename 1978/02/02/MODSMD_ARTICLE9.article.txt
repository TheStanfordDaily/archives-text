In reference to the article by Susan
Wels headed "It's not child's play
down on the Farm'' (Daily, |an. 25), I
have several comments.
The key phrase in the sentence
stating "that home births are an ac
ceptable, even an attractive alterna
tive, if properly supervised" is if
properly supervised. This condition
is seldom met in the United States,
including the Stanford area, because
most physicians are unwilling to at
tend birthing women at home and
because highly trained, licensed
midwives are generally unavaila
ble. Someobstetriciansargue that it is
nol possible to make home birth ac
ceptably safe for mother and baby
under any circumstances; but I be
lieve that more research needs to be
done in the area of the relative risks
of home and hospital birth before
this can be accepted as fact.
Nevertheless, I believe that having
been given a full explanation and
understanding of the known risks as
sociated with various birth atten
dants and environments, a family
should have the right to make its own
choices about birth.
At a time when adequate profes
sional care for home birth is unavail
able, increasing numbers of mid-
Peninsula families are insisting on
giving birth at home. Some estimates
run as high as 10 to 20 home births
per month in the Palo Alto area at the
present time. The fact that many of
these women have kaiser insurance
is proof that economic factors are not
the primary reason for home delivery
in many (I believe most) of these
cases.
It is my strongly held belief that the
physicians and other health profes
sionals in a given community have an
obligation to provide modern health
care to all residents of that area, not
just to those who are willing to ac
cept the care on terms dictated by
the professionals. In the case of
childbirth on the mid-Peninsula, this
means that either physicians and
professional midwives should estab
lish home birth programs, or more
realistically and practically, hospitals
and physicians should modify their
birthing practices in such ways that
virtually all families desirous of home
birth at present will avail themselves
of hospital (or birth center) care, with
all of the safety advantages that they
should be able to offer.
Progress at Stanford and other
local hospitals in the direction of
liberalized birthing practices has
been painfully slow. A family due to
have a baby in the next month is not
helped by the hospital's explanation
that "we are working on it, please be

patient" and may choose an unat
tended home birth at considerable
peril to mother and baby. This has
happened literally hundreds of times
in our area over the past several
years, and several obstetrical disas
ters have occurred that could have
been averted had local hospitals and
physicians been more responsive to
the expressed needs of birthing
families.
I certainly believe that an indi
vidual physician has the right to re
fuse care to a couple desirous of
home birth if it is his or her belief that
home birth is unsafe. I also believe
that we physicians have a collective
responsibility to all such couples,
and that at present in this area, we
are ignoring the "home birth prob
lem'' and simply hoping that it will go
away if we all refuse to provide care.

birthing practices in such ways that
virtually all families desirous of home
birth at present will avail themselves
of hospital (or birth center) care, with
all of the safety advantages that they
should be able to offer.
Progress at Stanford and other
local hospitals in the direction of
liberalized birthing practices has
been painfully slow. A family due to
have a baby in the next month is not
helped by the hospital's explanation
that "we are working on it, please be

patient" and may choose an unat
tended home birth at considerable
peril to mother and baby. This has
happened literally hundreds of times
in our area over the past several
years, and several obstetrical disas
ters have occurred that could have
been averted had local hospitals and
physicians been more responsive to
the expressed needs of birthing
families.
I certainly believe that an indi
vidual physician has the right to re
fuse care to a couple desirous of
home birth if it is his or her belief that
home birth is unsafe. I also believe
that we physicians have a collective
responsibility to all such couples,
and that at present in this area, we
are ignoring the "home birth prob
lem'' and simply hoping that it will go
away if we all refuse to provide care.

In reference to the article by Susan
Wels headed "It's not child's play
down on the Farm'' (Daily, |an. 25), I
have several comments.
The key phrase in the sentence
stating "that home births are an ac
ceptable, even an attractive alterna
tive, if properly supervised" is if
properly supervised. This condition
is seldom met in the United States,
including the Stanford area, because
most physicians are unwilling to at
tend birthing women at home and
because highly trained, licensed
midwives are generally unavaila
ble. Someobstetriciansargue that it is
nol possible to make home birth ac
ceptably safe for mother and baby
under any circumstances; but I be
lieve that more research needs to be
done in the area of the relative risks
of home and hospital birth before
this can be accepted as fact.
Nevertheless, I believe that having
been given a full explanation and
understanding of the known risks as
sociated with various birth atten
dants and environments, a family
should have the right to make its own
choices about birth.
At a time when adequate profes
sional care for home birth is unavail
able, increasing numbers of mid-
Peninsula families are insisting on
giving birth at home. Some estimates
run as high as 10 to 20 home births
per month in the Palo Alto area at the
present time. The fact that many of
these women have kaiser insurance
is proof that economic factors are not
the primary reason for home delivery
in many (I believe most) of these
cases.
It is my strongly held belief that the
physicians and other health profes
sionals in a given community have an
obligation to provide modern health
care to all residents of that area, not
just to those who are willing to ac
cept the care on terms dictated by
the professionals. In the case of
childbirth on the mid-Peninsula, this
means that either physicians and
professional midwives should estab
lish home birth programs, or more
realistically and practically, hospitals
and physicians should modify their
birthing practices in such ways that
virtually all families desirous of home
birth at present will avail themselves
of hospital (or birth center) care, with
all of the safety advantages that they
