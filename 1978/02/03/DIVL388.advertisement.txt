This slory takes place in the deep dark forests of
Quebec Down in the deep dark forest there
were 2 grand old trees One day these trees were
swaying from side to side in the wind Suddenly
they looked down and saw a little sapling bet
ween them Ah ha' said the first tree that tree
isa son-of-a-beech 1 Ah non. non insistedthe
other tree That little tree is a son-of-a-birch
The two trees begar to argue until suddenly
along flew a woodpecker They asked to wood
pecker to determine the type of the little tree
below
So the woodpecker took a little nibble from the
big beech and then a little morsel from the birch
tree Then he lighted on the small tree in ques
tion Well' The two great trees roared together
Is it a son of a-beech. or a son-of-a-birch 7 I
don t know the woodpecker answered gutter
ally but that is the best piece of ash Ive sunk my
pecker into in a Jong time
Why are banking and sex similar 7 Once you
