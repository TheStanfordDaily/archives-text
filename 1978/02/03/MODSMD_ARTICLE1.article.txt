# SCRIP drops demand for Feb. 14 divestment
## 
### Will Nixon 
SCRIP has dropped demands that
the Board of Trustees begin divest
ment from eight corporations by
Feb. 14, Stanford Committee for a
Responsible Investment Policy
spokespersons announced yester
day.
"The trustees and President
Richard Lyman have said there is ab
solutely no possibility whatsoever of
the trustees acceding to these de
mands," said Vice President for Pub
lic Affairs Robert Rosenzweig.
"We're asking that they state the
reasons for their position by the
14th," said SCRIP spokesperson Eric
Boysen, "and that they come to cam
pus for some kind of public forum."
Intensive petitioning began last
week, Boysen said, and SCRIP has
given nearly 20 dorm and house pre
sentations. The petition calls for Uni
versity divestment from eight corpo

rations: Union Carbide, Ford, Gen
eral Motors, Goodyear, General
Electric, IBM, Mobil Oil and Bank of
America. The petition also asks the
trustees to come here to state their
position on divestment.
Boysen estimated that half of the
people asked to sign the petition. He
said the petition will be presented to
the trustees on the 14th, although
the petition drive will continue past
that date since it supports divest
ment in general. SCRIP hopes to col
lect 5000 to 10,000 names, Boysen
added.
Given the trustees' level of infor
mation on the issue, Boysen said, the
earlier call for a divestment policy by
the middle of February was an "un
realistic demand."
"The trustees have never wanted
to come to campus," Rosenzweig
said. "The board feels they have set
up adequate machinery for getting
student views," he added, citing
several existing committees.
"The trustees came here in the late
'60s and early '70s, the net results
which was to put them on the spot
and not really to do anything else,"
said Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the
president, giving his impressions of a
meeting yesterday which included
Lyman.
The students are not the same
peopleas before, Hamrdla said, buta
residue of bad feelings may still exist
on the board.
"The big thing now is to set up a
forum with the trustees," Boysen
said. When asked what the reaction
would be if the trustees did not ag

ree to such a meeting with stu
dents, Boysen said it would be "an
insult to the students who are being
neglected in the whole process."
It would be hard "to sustain the
view" that the trustees are ignoring
the students on the issue of South
Africa and investment responsibility,
said Rosenzweig.
"They have spent a hell of a lot of
time on this issue," Rosenzweig said.
"They just do not feel that coming to
campus and getting into a debate
would be a very productive way of
doing business."
The trustees spent more than four
hours discussing the Commission on
Investment Responsibility at their
December meeting, Hamrdla said.
He added that the board particularly
wants CIR input on the South Africa
question.
"The trustees are not addressing
the issue of South Africa," said
Boysen, "and the CIR as they have
presented it, does not allow that dis
cussion.
"We feel our position is well
documented. If the trustees come
here and give a good explanation of
their position, that's all we're asking
at this point."
Laura Carlsen, a spokesperson for
SCRIP, said that based on responses
from dormitory meetings, "Students
are fairly convinced corporations
shouldn't be in South Africa, but
they're less sure about divestment."
"Last spring none of us would have
expected the amount of community
support we now have for divest
ment," Boysen said.

their position, that's all we're asking
at this point."
Laura Carlsen, a spokesperson for
SCRIP, said that based on responses
from dormitory meetings, "Students
are fairly convinced corporations
shouldn't be in South Africa, but
they're less sure about divestment."
"Last spring none of us would have
expected the amount of community
support we now have for divest
ment," Boysen said.

SCRIP has dropped demands that
the Board of Trustees begin divest
ment from eight corporations by
Feb. 14, Stanford Committee for a
Responsible Investment Policy
spokespersons announced yester
day.
"The trustees and President
Richard Lyman have said there is ab
solutely no possibility whatsoever of
the trustees acceding to these de
mands," said Vice President for Pub
lic Affairs Robert Rosenzweig.
"We're asking that they state the
reasons for their position by the
14th," said SCRIP spokesperson Eric
Boysen, "and that they come to cam
pus for some kind of public forum."
Intensive petitioning began last
week, Boysen said, and SCRIP has
given nearly 20 dorm and house pre
sentations. The petition calls for Uni
versity divestment from eight corpo

rations: Union Carbide, Ford, Gen
eral Motors, Goodyear, General
Electric, IBM, Mobil Oil and Bank of
America. The petition also asks the
trustees to come here to state their
position on divestment.
Boysen estimated that half of the
people asked to sign the petition. He
said the petition will be presented to
the trustees on the 14th, although
the petition drive will continue past
that date since it supports divest
ment in general. SCRIP hopes to col
lect 5000 to 10,000 names, Boysen
added.
Given the trustees' level of infor
mation on the issue, Boysen said, the
earlier call for a divestment policy by
the middle of February was an "un
realistic demand."
"The trustees have never wanted
to come to campus," Rosenzweig
said. "The board feels they have set
up adequate machinery for getting
student views," he added, citing
several existing committees.
"The trustees came here in the late
'60s and early '70s, the net results
which was to put them on the spot
and not really to do anything else,"
said Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the
president, giving his impressions of a
meeting yesterday which included
Lyman.
The students are not the same
peopleas before, Hamrdla said, buta
residue of bad feelings may still exist
on the board.
"The big thing now is to set up a
forum with the trustees," Boysen
said. When asked what the reaction
would be if the trustees did not ag

ree to such a meeting with stu
dents, Boysen said it would be "an
insult to the students who are being
neglected in the whole process."
It would be hard "to sustain the
view" that the trustees are ignoring
the students on the issue of South
Africa and investment responsibility,
said Rosenzweig.
"They have spent a hell of a lot of
time on this issue," Rosenzweig said.
"They just do not feel that coming to
campus and getting into a debate
would be a very productive way of
doing business."
The trustees spent more than four
hours discussing the Commission on
Investment Responsibility at their
December meeting, Hamrdla said.
He added that the board particularly
wants CIR input on the South Africa
question.
"The trustees are not addressing
the issue of South Africa," said
Boysen, "and the CIR as they have
presented it, does not allow that dis
cussion.
"We feel our position is well
documented. If the trustees come
here and give a good explanation of
their position, that's all we're asking
at this point."
Laura Carlsen, a spokesperson for
SCRIP, said that based on responses
