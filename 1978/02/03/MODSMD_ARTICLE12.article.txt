# Letters to the 'Daily' editor

Gross out
Do you realize that most of us read
the Daily over breakfast? Do you
think we like to look at brains while
digging into an omelet?
Well we do, and we don't — but
just in case you don't get the point let
us recreatewhat happened. We were
all in the dining room having a won
derful time, and then we heard the
thunk of the Daily being delivered at
the back door. We assume you de
liver it to the back door because you
want to be sure we get enough exer
cise each day when we walk the
equivalent of four city blocks neces
sary to get there and back from the
dining room.
Anyway, Mike Levinson went out
to get it, and we were doing just fine
with our meals, when suddenly a
blood-curdling scream arose from
approximately four city blocks away.
"AAAAAAAAARG!" was the cry, and
as we heard it we were shocked and
dismayed beyond our wildest
dreams.
Steve Reade, for example, drop

ped his grapefruit into the Raisin
Bran — at the same time Dan
Neuman put his fork through the
only part of the Chron we all read
(Spiderman). It was disconcerting,
to say the least. We are mad as hell,
and we are not going to take it any
more. No more brains, OK?

Aurora
When the first issue of Aurora, "A
Women's Newspaper For The Stan
ford Community," came out, it gave
a categorical listing of women's
groups available to women here. I feel
that the editors made a noticeable exc
lusion, the mentioning of sororities.
Interestingly enough, the Aurora
editorial proposes that its organiza
tion is "bound by a mutual desire to
provide the Stanford community
with a publication serving as a forum
for the expression of women's ideas
and concerns."
Perhaps the women responsible
view sororities only as fledgling en
tities. Perhaps they consider
sororities to be at opposition with
their personal philosophies of
womanhood.
If the last reason is true, then Au
rora begins its journalistic career
with a prejudiced outlook. Women
here cannot be stereotyped, so
neither should certain interest
groups be ignored, or worse, scored
by omission. Though I am not per
sonally committed to any movement
on campus, I believe if a group sees
the need for a women's magazine,
then they should considerall types of
women. If not, in my opinion, they
defeat their purpose; they will not
create a complete "Women's News
paper For The Stanford Commun
ity."

Angell Field
For the past several years there
have been a number of letters from
faculty/staff and students deploring
the recreational running conditions
at Angell Field. Their recommenda
tions for rehabilitation have ranged
all the way from a regular mainte
nance of the track surface only, to

the installation of an all weather sur
face including a removal of the as
phalt runways on the indoor field
and a complete reseeding of that
area and installation of an automatic
sprinkler system.
The Department of Athletics has
surveyed Angell Field to determine
what might be done, first to rehabili
tate the facility, and second to estab
lish a maintenance pattern that can
sustain reasonable quality for recrea
tional running.
The cost of installation of an all
weather surface is prohibitive as is a
complete redo of the infield includ
ing an automatic sprinkler sytem. An
all weather surface would require a
major gift specifically for that pur
pose.
However, the Department plans to
do the following at Ange/I Field as
expeditiously as possible — depen
dent of course on weather condi
tions.
—Gopher control ar Angell, as well
as other playing fields, is already un
derway.
—Replacement of an old and de
teriorating water line inside the track
header board together with couplers
to allow for adequate watering of
both the track and the field.
—Installation of a new inside
perimeter header board.
—The "trucking in" of additional
decomposed granite to raise the
level of the track surface and enable a
downward slope from the outside to
the inside perimeter board and
sumps (which also have to be
cleaned out).
—The "trucking in" of additional
pea gravel to permit recreational
running when the main track surface
itself is unusuable during the rainy
season.
—The harrowing, dragging and
rolling of the track surface to estab
lish an appropriately sloped surface
for adequate drainage.
—A continual pattern of harrow
ing, dragging and rolling on an e.-tib
lisned maintenance schedule so as to
sustain the surface.
This onetime rehabilitative effort
will require considerable funds and
will also require the appointment of a
new full-time equivalent grounds
person to assure adequate and
proper maintenance.
