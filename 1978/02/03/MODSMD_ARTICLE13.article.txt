# South Africa working conditions poor

In the Jan. 4 issue of the Daily, Hoover senior
fellow Dr. Lewis Cann engaged in a silly,
sophomoric discourse that was presented as a
serious critique of a column i wrote on the South
African Krugerrand (Daily, Dec. 2). I had originally
intended to ignore his comments, thinking no one
in the community would take him seriously.
Anyone who possesses even a minimal know
ledge of the economic and political history of the
South Africa region knows that South African
blacks do not work in the mines because they like
to; nor do Africans from surrounding areas mig
rate to the "land of apartheid" to bask in its
niceties.
There are very real historical, structural reasons
for this immigration â€” a fact any "expert" on the
region, including of course, Cann, knows well.
Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland, Malawi and
Mozambique have served for decades as labor
exporting countries. The major reason they have
exported labor to South Africa (and frequently to
Rhodesia) is that they have few alternatives if they
are to keep their dependent economies afloat.
Even a child could see that this has nothing to do

with Gann's silly, ideological conceptualization of
Africans "voting with their feet," but with the fact
that the South Africa area was integrated into the
world system in such a way as to insure that some
regions in it would be relatively "developed"
while others would essentially serve as reservoirs
of potential laborers.
Regarding working conditions, it is interesting
to note that even the South African government
has begun abandoning the hope of convincing
intelligent people that "things are just fine." The
more recent Pretoria line goes something like this:
"Yes, things are bad. But what do you prefer, us or
chaos and communism?" This line is obviously
reactionary, but it is actually more liberal than the
argument Gann's lette r makes.
Since Gann's statement mentions Nazi Germany
in a negative light, one might ask how a German
Jewish emigrant could so overtly support a regime
headed by an individual (Vorster) who has openly
declared his admiration of Hitler.
Perhaps', Gann views the "scholarly" defense of
the reactionary white South Africans as part of his

mission in life. If so, this would help to explain the
blatantly reactionary book, White Settlers in Trop
ical Africa, he co-authored with Hoover fellow
Peter Duignan.
This book contains such jewels of wisdom as:
"Nothing is to be gained by ejecting the Por
tuguese at the present time. Who is to take their
place? None of the African organizations has as yet
established a clear right to rule, nor have they the
trained personnel to do so. ... If we are not to
repeat the tragedies of the Congo, Indochina, and
Laos, this war of national liberation must be stop
ped. The West, and Africans as well, are better
served if the chaos of tribal rivalry and
communist-inspired wars of national liberation do
not summarily replace Pax et Imperium."
Perhaps, the above-referred-to sense of historic
mission would explain why Cann was in South
Africa during the past summer. For what? At whose
expense? In whose interest? And it might also exp
lain the content of a position paper on South Africa
that Cann and Duignan will be publishing shortly.
