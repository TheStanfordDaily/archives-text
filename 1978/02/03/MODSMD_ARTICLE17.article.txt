# Committee studies bike safety here

### Beth Connor 
Interested students and Uni
versity employees have joined
forces to try to alleviate the
problems of crisscrossing, col
liding bikes in crowded cam
pus centers.
Since November, 10 rep
resentatives from the presi
dent's office, the office of pub
lic safety, plant services and
the planning office have met
regularly with 10 students to
discuss options for bike safety.
The informal, 20-member
committee was organized by
Diana Conklin, service man
ager of Tresidder Union. The
committee is currently divided
into four subgroups, with each
subgroup addressing a particu
lar aspect of the University's
bicycle problem.
Gerry Bernstein, a graduate
student in Civil Engineering
and a memberof the education
subgroup, said he is con
cerned about the danger and
confusion of all the bikes on
campus. He is now working to
teach the Stanford community
some basic rules of the road,

including safety and attentive
ness.
Other subgroups are
equipment, which stresses the
importance of lights, reflectors
and other safety tools; circula
tion, which plans the routing
and engineering of bicycle
thoroughfares; and enforce
ment, which sees that bicycle
laws and regulations are
adhered to.
Bernstein said he is con
cerned with soliciting student
opinions regarding bicycle
regulations.
"It's notall donethroughen
forcement. It's got to be a stu
dent supported movement,"
he said.
The committee plans a
March "bicycle fair" and hopes
to create bicycle barriers, walk
zones, road markings and
signs throughout the Stanford
community, Bernstein said.
According to Bernstein, the
majority of accidents occur be
cause, "there's no convention.
People don't know what to
do."
