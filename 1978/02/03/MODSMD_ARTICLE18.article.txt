As one who frequently runs (he radio tele
scope route south of Junipero Serra (and now I
run with a pass from the University), ! wonder
about the possible radiation damage one can
receive by running near the radio-science
equipment. There is a sign by the "dish" that
warns motorists that the radiation may be harm
ful to the tint on windshields - is that the only
thing it harms?
-DL
The type of radiation emitted by the Dish is
microwave radiation, and there are federal regu
lations governing this, said Von Eshleman, a
professor in Electrical Engineering. He said the
Dish is now, "almost completely on stand-by,"
and that even when it was in full operation, it
was not a health hazard.
Who lives in the house at Angell Field?
-JY
Two students and their spouses live in that
house, according to Robert Young, associate
director of athletics.
The house was originally used to house Sam
McDonald, a staff member in the Athletic De
partment. When he died, the house was rented
out to students.
The house has housed students since the
early 19505. The Athletic Department controls
the house, and it is rented mostly to student

athletes and their wives.
The couples keep the plate clean and provide
lighting and security for the area.
I am presently a junior but when/if I pass five
units this quarter, I will officially become a
senior (130 units or more according to the Regis
trar).
My question is: "When does this become ef
fective-on the last day of exams? When I get my
grades?
This is important because the last day of
exams, March 25th (and Good Friday), is a full
moon and I'd hate to miss the opportunity. Do I
have to wait until April 22nd (Passover - it seems
like no matter what, it'll be a religious kiss)?
-RO
I don't know why there is so much interest in
moonlight kissing this quarter. . . . Anyway, I
think it would be okay as soon as you arecertain
you have passed five units worth of course work
(could be March 25). So, just make sureyou pass
your classes!
Something "bugging you?" Just bop on by the
