# Spawning our 'deathdenying culture'
## 
### Lane Webster 
America's affluence and its high
caliber of health care have
spawned our "death-denying cul
ture," author Joe Bayly told a
crowd of 100 persons in Kresge
Auditorium Monday night.
Such a culture can't cope with
death and needs to learn how, said
the vice president of the David C.
Cook Publishing Company of
Chicago.
"Many people as old as I am have
never seen anyone die," he said.
But the 57-year-old Bayly has —
three of his sons died before they
were 20.
Our"cosmetic embalming" tries
to gloss the raw fact that "we are all
terminal cases," he said. The cus
tom of shunting the elderly off to
rest homes further divorces us
from the process of dying, he said.
Society's shrinking before the
reality of mortality has left grieving
relatives, friends, doctors and the
dying themselves emotionally fro
zen when death threatens them,
said Bayly.

Bayly described one typical reac
tion that reinforces a dying man's
despair. "His wife kisses him first
on the lips, then on the cheek,
then on the forehead and finally
blows him a kiss."
Doctors often react awkwardly
too when death approaches. "The
patient nearing death the doctor
somehow misses on his rounds,"
said Bayly.
Whether it's due to a broken en
gagement, a divorce or death,
"grief is grief," he said.
"To feel one's emotion of loss is
not a feminine but a human charac
teristic," said Bayly. "We've been
sold this 'macho image' of the
American male. We haven't
learned how to grieve," he added.
Stilted attitudes
In learning to cut through our
stilted attitudes about death, said
Bayly, we master processes that
apply to all of life.
"Caring for a person means first
of all caring," he explained. He
specifically counselled premeds
not to let case histories become

more important than persons.
Bayly told a story of a hospital
cleaning lady who baffled doctors
by boosting the morale of every pa
tient whose room she cleaned. Her
secret was simply patting the per
son on the shoulder and whisper
ing, "It's not so bad, it's not so
bad."
Becoming "the peer of a power
less person" — like the cleaning
lady did — eases any relationship
with him, said Bayly. Enlarging on
that, he said he believes both
feminists and minorities seek to be
met not "from above," but as peers
entitled to dignity and respect.
One way to meet that need is to
sit down when you're in a sick per
son's room no matter how short
the visit, he said.
Touching them
Another way to care for people,
something hard for Americans, is
touching them, said Bayly.
He recalled a woman who ad
mired hf/ doctor because he let
her know she was another human
like himself. "He's the greatest,"

she decided, "because everytime
he passes by my bed, he tweaks my
toe."
A third way to respond to others'
sorrow is to listen, said Bayly. In
stead of jabbering your senti
ments, "encourage the surfacing
of emotion," he advised. Give both
the dying and their friends "per
mission to grieve in front of you"
by asking if they feel like sobbing,
he said.
Avoid ready-made methods of
carying for the grieving, because
they may come across as artificial
and insincere. Just be yourself,
said Bayly. "There are no wrong
plays, it's just sitting on the bench
that we have to worry about," he
added.
Above all, spend time with a per
son, said Bayly, because loneliness
presents the worst hazard. He
mentioned one patient who kept a
telephone on his pillow just to hear
the comforting sound of the dial
tone.
Whenever possible, let people
die at home among friends instead

of leaving them with the "good
people, but sterile strangers" hos
pitals offer, he said.
Bayly said he thinks the book,
"On Death and Dying" merits a
good reading. Written by Elizabeth
Kubler-Ross, pioneer in the field of
the psychology of death, the book
outlines the five stages a dying per
son usually passes through: de
nial, resentment, bargaining, de
pression and final acceptance.
But because it applies to hu
mans, said Bayly, the process is
subject to limitless variation.
"Don't force this on anybody," he
said.
He added that he believes in a
sixth step — life after death. He
said he cherished the comment
Pope John XXXIII made right be
fore he died: "My bags are
packed; I am ready for the jour
ney."
"My job now," Bayly said, "is to
pack the bags of the dying."
One student who listened to the
talk said, "He spoke in a very relev
ant way. He didn't mess around."
