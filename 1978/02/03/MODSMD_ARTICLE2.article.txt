# Humanities sequence rule axed
## 
### 
By Peter Brett

The Faculty Senate voted yesterday
to eliminate the sequence aspect of
the humanities distribution re
quirement.
Departments will be asked merely
to designate certain courses as
applicable toward the humanities
requirement. Students will be re
quired to take any three
humanities-designated courses.
To encourage coherence in a stu
dent's program, departments will
also be asked to suggest two or three
sequences particularly suitable for
introductory purposes.
These modifications will apply to
all students who entered the Univer
sity in or after the academic year
1976-77.
In presenting the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US)
proposal, Political Science Prof. Jan
Triska said the present humanities

requirement is unworkable. The ex
tremely long list of possible
humanities sequences confuses
both students and faculty, he
explained.
Furthermore, Dean of Under
graduate Studies Herant Katchadou
rian feels it is "near impossible to
monitor and administer the re
quirement in its present form," ac
cording to Triska.
President Richard Lyman, how
ever, said, "I regard this proposal as a
step backward." The solution to a
more workable humanities require
ment is to limit the number of sequ
ences offered, according to Lyman.
He said, "There will be a probable
loss of momentum if we do away with
the sequence." The national trend is
toward providing "more coherence
in undergraduate education," he
added.
Lyman introduced an alternate re

solution to send the original resolu
tion back to the C-US, instructing it
to look at limiting the number of
sequences offered. The alternative
resolution lost by a close vote.
In the long range financial fore
cast, Provost William Miller reported
that per capita personal income has
been going up faster than the Uni
versity's tuition over the long run.
"People can pay if they so choose,"
said Miller.
Furthermore, financial aid con
tinues to beavital offset to the cost of
tuition, ensuring that people can af
ford to enroll, according to the pro
vost's report.
The original Steering Committee
resolution to agree in spirit with a
recently passed ASSU Senate resolu
tion to discourage the use of sexist
language among faculty and students
met with significant opposition.
Geology Prof. Tjeerd VanAndel said

if there is to be a change it should be
more fundamental. "We should not
try to legislate how people speak and
write," he added.
Asst. Political Science Prof. Nan
nerl Keohane said, however, that
"changes in language are not purely
cosmetic."
An alternative resolution was pas
sed, reaffirming the senate's position
in favor of the "social and economic
equality of women and men."
