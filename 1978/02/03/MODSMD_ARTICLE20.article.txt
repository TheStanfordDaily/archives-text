# Carilloneurs captivate campus audience
## 
### Teresa Blasberg 
High atop Hoover Tower,
tucked just below the observa
tion platform is a room
crowded with dust, piled-up
boxes and shelves of books. A
single bare lightbulb lights the
platform in the center of the
room directly below the great
bells of the tower. The carillon
that can be heard all over cam
pus and beyond is controlled
from a keyboard by Professor
James Angell, associate chair
man, electrical engineering
dept. and his students.
The 35 bells were made in
Belgium, cast slightly thick and
tuned by shaving down the
metal. They first appeared in
the 1930-40 New York World's
Fair and were later donated to
Stanford by the Belgian Ameri
can Education Foundation.
The entire set weighs 15,000
lbs.; the largest bell (a flat) is
four feet wide by four feet high
and weights 1400 lbs. The caril
lon is composed of wooden
bars that resemble broom
handles arranged like a piano
keyboard, and organ-like foot
pedals.
The touch required to play
the carillon is very different
from that of the organ or of the
piano. Up to four of the bars

are struck at once with the
fists; the force with which the
handles are struck determines
the number of times the clap
per will strike the bell.
Organ experience is helpful
in manipulating the pedals, but
Margie Weisz, a senior in Ger
man Studies and Music, has
mastered the technique
though she has never played
the organ. The other two caril
lons on the west coast, at the
University of California cam
puses at Santa Barbara and
Riverside, have practice
keyboards that make bell-like
sounds, but Weisz must prac
tice on the actual keyboard
without sound.
The carillon may also be
played mechanically by means
of a large drum similar to that
of a music box. Its repertoire
consists of Handel's "Har
monious Blacksmith" and
"Come Join the Band." The
drum is not often used, as
there has been sufficient stu
dent interest in learning to play
the carillon.
Weisz prefers a human per
formance. "The drum doesn't
have the human mistakes, but
it doesn't have the human feel
ing either," she said.
Human hands display the

bells' incredible range of ex
pression. The carillon is capa
ble of producing great varia
tions of volume. The bells have
a resonance and full sound
quality a piano doesn't have;
each individual note is impor
tant.
The unusually beautiful
sound of the carillon is due
largely to the harmonics of the
bells: they have a major third
overtone. This somewhat
limits the range of music ap
propriate for the carillon, be
cause music written in a major
key tends to sound dissonant.
The best music written for
the carillon, like that of Leen
T'Hart, the world's foremost
carilloneur, uses the overtone
structure of the bells to display
the varied expression of which
the carillon is capable.
Angell's direction keeps the
bells a pleasure and not a nui
sance. The carillon is played
only at noon, 5 p.m. and spe
cial occasions to avoid disturb

ing classes, but never when the
observation platform is open.
He encourages students not to
play with sound until a piece is
flawless; pieces must be
played flowingly without
pauses, and nerves are a factor
when the bells can be heard by
so many people.
One of Angell's students was
practicing a recital for admis
sion to the Guild of Caril
loneurs and played the piece
several times to perfect it. A
Crothers Hall resident re
ported that the performance
was excellent, but the repeti
tion was unfortunate. Angell is
"sensitive to what people
think" and is careful to see tht
the carillon as a public instru
ment is not misused.
The Guild of Carilloneurs
provides contact among caril
loneurs and is a major source
of music. Angell primarily
writes music for the First
Methodist Church of Palo Al

to's handbell choir that he has
directed since 1963, but he oc
casionally adapts such pieces
for the carillon. One piece
which began as a practice exer
cise for the handbell choir was
put in a minor key and became
a three point fugue for the
carillon; this is about as elabo
rate as carillon music gets.
Angell is an accomplished
carilloneur and several of his
former students have been
quite successful: Margo
Halstead is Carilloneur at U.C.
Riverside, and lames Walsh is
University Organist at U.C.
Santa Barbara.
As far as the noise is con
cerned, Angell feels, "it's not
as bad as the worst rock
group." The clatter of the
keyboard when playing is actu
ally louder than the sound of
the bells. Weisz tires of exp
laining to people that the deci
bel level will not make her go
deaf.

The 35 bells of Hoover Tower are controlled by a keyboard located in a room directly below the tower
observation platform.
High atop Hoover Tower,
tucked just below the observa
tion platform is a room
crowded with dust, piled-up
boxes and shelves of books. A
single bare lightbulb lights the
platform in the center of the
room directly below the great
bells of the tower. The carillon
that can be heard all over cam
pus and beyond is controlled
from a keyboard by Professor
James Angell, associate chair
man, electrical engineering
dept. and his students.
The 35 bells were made in
Belgium, cast slightly thick and
tuned by shaving down the
metal. They first appeared in
the 1930-40 New York World's
Fair and were later donated to
Stanford by the Belgian Ameri
can Education Foundation.
The entire set weighs 15,000
lbs.; the largest bell (a flat) is
four feet wide by four feet high
and weights 1400 lbs. The caril
lon is composed of wooden
bars that resemble broom
handles arranged like a piano
keyboard, and organ-like foot
pedals.
The touch required to play
the carillon is very different
from that of the organ or of the
piano. Up to four of the bars

are struck at once with the
fists; the force with which the
handles are struck determines
the number of times the clap
per will strike the bell.
Organ experience is helpful
in manipulating the pedals, but
Margie Weisz, a senior in Ger
man Studies and Music, has
mastered the technique
though she has never played
the organ. The other two caril
lons on the west coast, at the
University of California cam
puses at Santa Barbara and
Riverside, have practice
keyboards that make bell-like
sounds, but Weisz must prac
tice on the actual keyboard
without sound.
The carillon may also be
played mechanically by means
of a large drum similar to that
of a music box. Its repertoire
consists of Handel's "Har
monious Blacksmith" and
"Come Join the Band." The
drum is not often used, as
there has been sufficient stu
dent interest in learning to play
the carillon.
Weisz prefers a human per
formance. "The drum doesn't
have the human mistakes, but
it doesn't have the human feel
ing either," she said.
Human hands display the

bells' incredible range of ex
pression. The carillon is capa
ble of producing great varia
tions of volume. The bells have
a resonance and full sound
quality a piano doesn't have;
each individual note is impor
tant.
The unusually beautiful
sound of the carillon is due
largely to the harmonics of the
bells: they have a major third
overtone. This somewhat
limits the range of music ap
propriate for the carillon, be
cause music written in a major
key tends to sound dissonant.
The best music written for
the carillon, like that of Leen
T'Hart, the world's foremost
carilloneur, uses the overtone
structure of the bells to display
the varied expression of which
the carillon is capable.
Angell's direction keeps the
bells a pleasure and not a nui
sance. The carillon is played
only at noon, 5 p.m. and spe
cial occasions to avoid disturb

ing classes, but never when the
observation platform is open.
He encourages students not to
play with sound until a piece is
flawless; pieces must be
played flowingly without
pauses, and nerves are a factor
when the bells can be heard by
so many people.
One of Angell's students was
practicing a recital for admis
sion to the Guild of Caril
loneurs and played the piece
several times to perfect it. A
Crothers Hall resident re
ported that the performance
was excellent, but the repeti
tion was unfortunate. Angell is
"sensitive to what people
think" and is careful to see tht
the carillon as a public instru
ment is not misused.
The Guild of Carilloneurs
provides contact among caril
loneurs and is a major source
of music. Angell primarily
writes music for the First
Methodist Church of Palo Al

to's handbell choir that he has
directed since 1963, but he oc
casionally adapts such pieces
for the carillon. One piece
which began as a practice exer
cise for the handbell choir was
put in a minor key and became
a three point fugue for the
carillon; this is about as elabo
rate as carillon music gets.

played flowingly without
pauses, and nerves are a factor
when the bells can be heard by
so many people.
One of Angell's students was
practicing a recital for admis
sion to the Guild of Caril
loneurs and played the piece
several times to perfect it. A
Crothers Hall resident re
ported that the performance
was excellent, but the repeti
tion was unfortunate. Angell is
"sensitive to what people
think" and is careful to see tht
the carillon as a public instru
ment is not misused.
The Guild of Carilloneurs
provides contact among caril
loneurs and is a major source
of music. Angell primarily
writes music for the First
Methodist Church of Palo Al

to's handbell choir that he has
directed since 1963, but he oc
casionally adapts such pieces
for the carillon. One piece
which began as a practice exer
cise for the handbell choir was
put in a minor key and became
a three point fugue for the
carillon; this is about as elabo
rate as carillon music gets.
Angell is an accomplished
carilloneur and several of his
former students have been
quite successful: Margo
Halstead is Carilloneur at U.C.
Riverside, and lames Walsh is
University Organist at U.C.
Santa Barbara.
As far as the noise is con
cerned, Angell feels, "it's not
as bad as the worst rock
group." The clatter of the
keyboard when playing is actu
ally louder than the sound of
the bells. Weisz tires of exp
laining to people that the deci
bel level will not make her go
deaf.
