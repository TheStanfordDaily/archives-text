## 'Knowledge Engineers' take first 
### Matt Mettler 
The "Knowledge Engineers"
decisively defeated "New
Wave" to win the College Bowl
competition here Monday
night by a score of 325 to 115.
The winning team will prob
ably go intact to represent

However, an all-star team may

Twenty teams competed in

teams expressed interest in
participating.

The winning team members

Jon Reider. Their majors are
computer science, English,
applied physics, and the his
tory of social theory, respec
tively. All but Gioia are
graduate students.
The early elimination rounds
were 15 minutes long, and the
final rounds had two 10-minute
halves. The questions,
supplied by the National Col
lege Bowl Organization, co
vered a wide range of topics
including literature, history,
geography, grammer, spelling
and mathematics.

Questions could be
answered at any time, but a
team was penalized five points
if they interrupted a question
and then answered incorrectly.
The members of the four-man
teams had to answer toss-up
questions individually but
could confer on bonus ques
tions.
Eligibility
Only students who are cur
rently registered here were
eligible. One law school team
was disqualified for including a
member who graduated last
year.
The "Knowledge Engineers"
competed in the first round

with only three members. Col
lege Bowl rules prohibit the
use of substitutes.
Lyons was called upon to set
tle disputes that arose, particu
larly in the more intense final
rounds.
The semi-finals runner ups
were the "Donner Party" and
"Romp and Stomp."
