# UCLA blows Cards off court
## Cards shoot 32.3 per cent in 101-64 loss 
### David Georgette 
Los Angeles — The last time a
Stanford sports team ventured
south to the city of smog, it ran
up against a bigger, faster and
stronger squad and was
routed.
That was in November when
the USC Trojans did a 49-0
number on the Cardinal foot
ball team. Last night, UCLA did
a similar thing to coach Dick
Dißiaso's basketball team, de
stroying Stanford, 101-64, in
Pauley Pavilion.
UCLA dominated the game
from the outset, running out to
a 12-2 lead and then stretching
that margin to 21-8 halfway
through the first half.
The Bruins came out so fast
that the UCLA rooters were
chanting "Pour it on" with
more than two minutes left to
go in the half.
Tough on defense
"We played such good de
fense," said Cunningham.
"We worked hard on the man
to-man defense. I thought we
took them out of their passing
game."
The Cards managed to make
only seven of 25 field goal at
tempts in the first half. UCLA,
meanwhile, sizzled at 64 per
cent, netting 22 of 34 before
half.
Forthegame, UCLA hit on 59
per cent of its shots while Stan
ford finished at 32 per cent.
The Bruins also dominated
the Cards on the boards, out

rebounding them 48-29. "We
had a lot of respect for Stanford
on the boards, but I think this
might have been our best
board game of the year," said
Cunningham.
Forward David Greenwood,
the game's top scorer with 21
points — 15 in the second half
— led the Bruins on the
boards also, grabbing 13 re
bounds.
Slammer
And before leaving the
game, Greenwood treated the
fans to a flying two-handed
slam dunk on a pass from Kiki
Vandeweghe to culminate a
fast break. That hoop gave the
Bruins a 83-40 margin with
more than eight minutes to
play, their biggest lead of the
game.
"Coming into Los Angeles to
play UCLA, I know now how
the Christians felt coming into
Rome," said Dißiaso. "UCLA is
the best team in our league and
they should win. I think they'll
be pretty tough to catch."
Four other Bruins besides
Greenwood scored in double
figures. Guards Ray Townsend
and Roy Hamilton had 14 and
15 points, respectively, and
Vandewegheand Holland each
had 12.
Kimberly Belton led Stanford
with 15 while Tom Schmalzried
added 10 in a second-half relief
effort.
The win kept the sixth
ranked Bruins untainted in

Pacific-8 play with a 6-0 mark.
The Cards are now 1-5 in the
Pac-8, and also in last place by
themselves because
Washington State defeated
Oregon State last night, 63-58.
Tomorrow Stanford will face
USC in the Sports Arena at 4
p.m. in a televised contest
(KRON-4). USC dropped Cal
last night, 87-81.

ford's loss to California last Saturday. The Cardinal captain leads
Stanford on its annual southern swing this weekend. The Cards lost to
UCLA last night, 101-64, but will seek redemption against USC Satur
day.
Los Angeles — The last time a
Stanford sports team ventured
south to the city of smog, it ran
up against a bigger, faster and
stronger squad and was
routed.
That was in November when
the USC Trojans did a 49-0
number on the Cardinal foot
ball team. Last night, UCLA did
a similar thing to coach Dick
Dißiaso's basketball team, de
stroying Stanford, 101-64, in
Pauley Pavilion.
UCLA dominated the game
from the outset, running out to
a 12-2 lead and then stretching
that margin to 21-8 halfway
through the first half.
The Bruins came out so fast
that the UCLA rooters were
chanting "Pour it on" with
more than two minutes left to
go in the half.
Tough on defense
"We played such good de
fense," said Cunningham.
"We worked hard on the man
to-man defense. I thought we
took them out of their passing
game."
The Cards managed to make
only seven of 25 field goal at
tempts in the first half. UCLA,
meanwhile, sizzled at 64 per
cent, netting 22 of 34 before
half.
Forthegame, UCLA hit on 59
per cent of its shots while Stan
ford finished at 32 per cent.
The Bruins also dominated
the Cards on the boards, out

rebounding them 48-29. "We
had a lot of respect for Stanford
on the boards, but I think this
might have been our best
board game of the year," said
Cunningham.
Forward David Greenwood,
the game's top scorer with 21
points — 15 in the second half
— led the Bruins on the
boards also, grabbing 13 re
bounds.
Slammer
And before leaving the
game, Greenwood treated the
fans to a flying two-handed
slam dunk on a pass from Kiki
Vandeweghe to culminate a
fast break. That hoop gave the
Bruins a 83-40 margin with
more than eight minutes to
play, their biggest lead of the
game.
"Coming into Los Angeles to
play UCLA, I know now how
the Christians felt coming into
Rome," said Dißiaso. "UCLA is
the best team in our league and
they should win. I think they'll
be pretty tough to catch."
Four other Bruins besides
Greenwood scored in double
figures. Guards Ray Townsend
and Roy Hamilton had 14 and
15 points, respectively, and
Vandewegheand Holland each
had 12.
Kimberly Belton led Stanford
with 15 while Tom Schmalzried
added 10 in a second-half relief
effort.
The win kept the sixth
ranked Bruins untainted in

Pacific-8 play with a 6-0 mark.
The Cards are now 1-5 in the
Pac-8, and also in last place by
themselves because
Washington State defeated
Oregon State last night, 63-58.
Tomorrow Stanford will face
USC in the Sports Arena at 4
p.m. in a televised contest
(KRON-4). USC dropped Cal
last night, 87-81.
