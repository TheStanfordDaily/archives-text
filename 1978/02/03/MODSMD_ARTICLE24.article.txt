# Jon Powell: Sprinting into the spotlight
## 
### Andy Lowe 
Three years under the shadow and tutelage of
NCAA freestyle champion Dave Fairbank, senior Jon
Powell has sped to the forefront of national 100 yard
free rankings and has emerged the newest of Stan
ford's long line of class sprinters.
"Dave has been both a good friend and an inspira
tion to me," said Powell of his mentor and former
teammate. "He had great natural speed and fantastic
psychological preparation for competition."
Powell's profile, in and out of the water, is not
unlike that of Fairbank's. Easygoing, modest, but
self-confident, Powell's success has stemmed from a
mixture of natural ability and his determined mental
approach toward competition. Now expected, as a
matter of course, to provide first place finishes and
tremendous relay anchor legs, Powell has met the
challenge with seeming ease. Having won all but one
100 yard freestyle race, Powell is awed by teammates
for his consistency and ability to motivate those
around him.
Head swimming coach Jim Gaughran attributes
Powell's sudden rise to sprinting prominence to sev
eral factors. "Jon has always been an extremely tough
competitor, but until this year he was never exposed
to the kind of pressure such as was on Dave Fairbank
last year. He has become a national 100 free conten
der and a team leader, in response to our increased
dependence on him in the sprints. This season, he's

been almost unbeatable in the 100 and is a great relay
swimmer. He is definitely one of our most consistent
and tenacious performers."
Admits Powell, "I don't think of myself as a leader,
although I take my competition seriously and hate to
let the team down in close races. But sprinters don't
need the kind of discipline in practicing that other
swimmers must have. There is no way I could handle
the yardage that the distance people are doing. It
would hurt rather than help my swimming."
Thirteen years of competitive experience has pro
vided the Stanford,co-captain with many interesting
insights into swimming. "I came from pretty intense
AAU and high school programs," Powell explained.
"I chose Stanford over colleges such as Tennessee
and USC because I didn't want that same kind of
intensity and dedication to swimming while at col
lege. I knew that my academic and social interests
would be most important and my future goals would
be best served by Stanford.
"While at Stanford, my attitudes toward swimming
have changed considerably," he continued. "I do
less yardage now, but swim more intensely and intel
ligently." Powell's continual drop in times over his
four year tenure on the team, support his training
methods.
Clutch performances in dual meet and champion
ship competition is a Powell trademark, earning him

the respect and friendship of his teammates.
Spoke backstroker John Kingery of Powell, "He is a
hell of a psych swimmer and a super person, too.
Everybody has a lot of faith in his ability and the team
enjoys the kind of rapport with him that makes effec
tive his role as captain and team leader. Along with
Stu Corliss, he has been responsible, to a large ex
tent, for the team's high motivation level this sea
son."
Noted another teammate, a member of the wo
men's squad, "You would never figure from Jon's
easygoing nature that he was such a tough com
petitor. I've been impressed with his ability to get
along well with everybody and with his efforts at
unifying the men's and women's teams."
"Initially I was opposed to the integration of the
two teams," Powell said. "Soon, though, I agreed
that Gaughran s decision was the right one as I disco
vered what an impressive group of athletes and
people they were. There are days when some of them
kick my ass in practice."
Majoring in Economics and graduating in June,
Powell hopes to accomplish some goals in the re
mainder of his final season. Highest among the
priorities is his wish for fired up team efforts at the
NCAA (men's) and AIAW (women's) championships.
"I would like to place at the Nationals and help our
relays qualify for finals," he said.
