# Swimmers gear for Bruins
## 
### Andy Lowe 
USC, whose men's team has
dominated NCAA swimming
for half a decade, hosts Stan
ford's men's and women's
teams tonight in Pac-8 dual
meet competition. While the
women can expect their first
tough test of the season, the
men have little likelihood of
upending last year's NCAA
champs, a team rich in quality
and depth.
Plagued by schedule
changes which precluded
them from swimming Arizona,
Arizona State, and SMU, Stan
ford's female natators will be
hard pressed by their talented
opponents at USC's ancient
pool.
Ahead of last year's pace, the
Cardinal women will provide
plenty of competition for their
Southern rivals. Olympic gold
medalist Kim Peyton and new
comer Laura Raymond will be
heavily counted on in the
sprints. They will be chal
lenged by USC's Sue Hin
deraker, who has emerged one
of the nation's premiere frees
tylers.
Freshmen Lisa Mehoff and
Peggy Haslach, hoping for sea
sonal best times and possible
upset victories, will duel world
class breaststrokers Debby
Rudd, an Olympic finalist from
Great Britain, and Laura Sier
ing, a Santa Clara Swim Club
product.
Sweeps of the endurance

events by Valerie Lee, )o Har
shbarger, Anne Brodell, and
Margot Hagstette may give
Stanford the points needed to
overcome the powerful Trojan
team.
"We ai-e swimming right
through these meets. This
does not mean there won't be
any good swims. Our meets
with UCLA and USC are usually
good, whether the team score
is close or not," said coach |im
Caughran of the men's
weekend competition.
Several match-ups should
generate plenty of adrenalin in
the competitors and excite
ment for the spectators. All-
American Jon Powell battles
Scott Findorff, the highest plac
ing returnee from last year's
NCAA 50 yard free final.
Mike Bruner will be pres
sured by Canadian Olympian
Steve Pickell in the 200 yard fly
and by world record-holder
Bruce Furniss in the 200 yard
free.
Saturday, the men travel to
nearby UCLA, this year a lead
ing contender for the NCAA
team title. Again, Stanford
swims as the underdog be
cause of the Bruins' depth and
superior freshman group.
Leading UCLA is Brian
Goodell, a freestyler who col
lected three gold medals at the
Montreal Olympiad, Kip Virts,
third in last year's 200 yard
breastfinal, and Steve Austin, a
20.4 second 50 yard free
sprinter.

Plagued by schedule
changes which precluded
them from swimming Arizona,
Arizona State, and SMU, Stan
ford's female natators will be
hard pressed by their talented
opponents at USC's ancient
pool.
Ahead of last year's pace, the
Cardinal women will provide
plenty of competition for their
Southern rivals. Olympic gold
medalist Kim Peyton and new
comer Laura Raymond will be
heavily counted on in the
sprints. They will be chal
lenged by USC's Sue Hin
deraker, who has emerged one
of the nation's premiere frees
tylers.
Freshmen Lisa Mehoff and
Peggy Haslach, hoping for sea
sonal best times and possible
upset victories, will duel world
class breaststrokers Debby
Rudd, an Olympic finalist from
Great Britain, and Laura Sier
ing, a Santa Clara Swim Club
product.
Sweeps of the endurance

events by Valerie Lee, )o Har
shbarger, Anne Brodell, and
Margot Hagstette may give
Stanford the points needed to
overcome the powerful Trojan
team.
"We ai-e swimming right
through these meets. This
does not mean there won't be
any good swims. Our meets
with UCLA and USC are usually
good, whether the team score
is close or not," said coach |im
Caughran of the men's
weekend competition.
Several match-ups should
generate plenty of adrenalin in
the competitors and excite
ment for the spectators. All-
American Jon Powell battles
Scott Findorff, the highest plac
ing returnee from last year's
NCAA 50 yard free final.
Mike Bruner will be pres
sured by Canadian Olympian
Steve Pickell in the 200 yard fly
and by world record-holder
Bruce Furniss in the 200 yard
free.
Saturday, the men travel to
nearby UCLA, this year a lead
ing contender for the NCAA
team title. Again, Stanford
swims as the underdog be
cause of the Bruins' depth and
superior freshman group.
Leading UCLA is Brian
Goodell, a freestyler who col
lected three gold medals at the
Montreal Olympiad, Kip Virts,
third in last year's 200 yard
breastfinal, and Steve Austin, a
20.4 second 50 yard free
sprinter.
