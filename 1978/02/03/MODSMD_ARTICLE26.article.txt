# Scholarships for gymnasts
## 
### Dean Eyre 
With the high cost of athletic
equipment and supplies, good
sports programs need strong
financial support, and gymnas
tics is no exception. However,
with the approval of three
scholarships for men, two for
women, and the launching of
the new Cardinal Club organi
zation, the future for Stan
ford's gymnasts looks quite
promising.
Assistant Director of Athle
tics Ray Young said, "As far as
scholarships for '78-'79, the
men's gymnastics team has
been allotted, out of the total
Buck Club budget, the equiva
lent of three full rides which is
approxima ely $21,900. The
women have been allotted the
equivalent of two full rides, or
$14,600."
The women presently re
ceive their scholarship money

from the student aid reserve
fund. "This was money that
had been put aside over past
years out of any game receipts
that would normally go into the
operating budget reserve or
Buck Club reserve," Young
said.
Rather than remain depen
dent upon the reserve fund, an
alternative source for women's
athletic scholarships been
approved.
"We've got the beginnings
of what's going to be a parallel
organization to the Buck Club,
the Cardinal Club," explained
head women's gymnastics
coach Jackie Walker. "It will be
for people who are supporting
women's athletics — just as the
men get a lot of their scholar
ship money from the Buck
Club, we're going to have fun
draising for the Cardinal
Club," she said.

When asked about the im
pact of the Cardinal Club,
Young replied, "It's mandatory
that it have a very strong im
pact, because that reserve
fund, at the rate we are going,
will not last beyond the next
two or three years."
Young summarized the goal
of athletic funding, saying that
"what we are trying to do is,
out of the Buck Club and Car
dinal Club budgets, make par
ity within all of our sports."
The men's gymnastics team
hosts its last home meet of the
season tonight in Maples Pavil
ion at 7:30 p.m. against San
Jose State, Chico State and
Washington State. The women
travel Saturday to Fresno State
for a dual meet at 1 p.m. LSU
and Stanford face California in
Berkeley's Harmon Gym at
7:30 p.m. Saturday.
