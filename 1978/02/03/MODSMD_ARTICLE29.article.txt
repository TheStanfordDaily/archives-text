"Buy me some peanuts and Cracker-Jack . . . and it's root root
root for the home team. . That's right, it's time for Stanford
baseball to begin, and the Cards started the season off on the
right foot Wednesday afternoon with an 8-1 victory over the
University of San Francisco here in Sunken Diamond.
Brian Harrison, Mark Abbondola, and Larry Kuhn pitched
three innings apiece in Wednesday's contest and held the Dons
to only one earned run which came in the fourth inning on an RBI
single by USF catcher Pat Cremin. Back-to-back homeruns by
Dave Perez and Tom Guardino quickly put the Cards on top in the
bottom of the inning, however, and from there Stanford didn't
look back.
Rightfielder Mike Codiroli singled in one run in the fifth inning
and two more of the Cards' four in the sixth for his three RR!s
which made the score 7-1 in favor of the Cardinals. That wasn't
enough, though, and in the eighth inning Larry Reynolds ;eached
first base on a walk, stole second and was singled home by third
baseman Gary Scott, for run number eight. The game marked the
start of the 60-game 1978 season for the Cardinals.
"This is one of the few years we've ever had good depth
everywhere," coach Marquess pointed out; which means less
worry over injuries and more needed rests available to starters as
the season progresses. "We've especially got a lot of depth in our
pitching staff," he went on to say. "All we need is one or two of
them to come out and establish themselves early in the season.
Four or five of them have the potential to have great years."
Though the rest of the league is going to be talented, optimism
on the Stanford team is evident. Larry Kuhn summarized the
team's positive attitude when he said, "They're going to be
tough, but we're just going to have to go out and beat them."
