# Frats here prepare for rush
## 
### Gary Fremerman 
Tentative planning for spring
fraternity rush has been completed,
according to this year's Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFC) Rush Chair
man, Mark Triska.
The fraternity group, which as a
whole has failed two of the last three
years to reach its housing quota, will
launch its annual drive to recruit
pledges April 10, and wind up the
rush May 5 and 6, with formal frater
nity bid parties, Triska said.
After two weeks of "open
houses," the third week of rush will
be changed this year to a more "per
sonal or intimate" format because by
then fraternities will have some idea
of individuals' fraternity prefer
ences.
By the third week, "the effective
ness of handshaking has worn out,"
noted Reid Butler, IFC President.
"Fraternities will be encouraged to
schedule their activities on their
own." This anticipated change is sub
ject to final IFC approval, he added.
Since the establishment of the
University's Guaranteed Housing
Plan (CHP) in 1975, the fraternity sys
tem has failed twice to reach its set
quotas of non-freshmen housing
spaces. Eight fraternities were un
able to reach their quotas last spring,
and the Alpha Delts have failed two
years in a row.
If a fraternity fails to meet its hous-

ing responsibilities three of four
consecutive years, "members of the
Office of Residential Education will
meet with house officers and alumni
representatives and then determine
whether the house should enter the
draw system," according to CHP
guidelines.
"If the fraternity system as a whole
fails to meet its shares for two con
secutive years," the CHP continues,
"then the Office of Residential fdu
cation will decide if the house with
the greatest share deficit over the
previous two years should enter the
draw system."
Butler said the sophomore equiva
lent formula (based on members'
remaining years of guaranteed hous
ing) used to establish the quota
count is not an accurate reflection of
fraternity housing status.
About the same number of people
have been entering the fraternities
each year, even though the official
CHP quota has not been met, he ad
ded.
"We're missing the University
guidelines, but the frats haven't been
suffering," Butler said.
Tom Hornbeak, assistant director
of residential education and frater
nity adviser, said he believes the CHP
rules are flexible. However, he ex
pressed concern over the outcome
of the Alpha Delts' rush, and s*id
they would need to consider other

options if they failed again to reach
their housing quota.
Triska said it did not seem fair the
Alpha Delts (who have 14 open
spaces this quarter) should "get the
shaft after two bad years. They've
had an unfair reputation as being a
drug frat," he said. "The reputation
is bogus. They've gotten an unneces
sary share of bad press.
"They've got really responsible
leaders this year," he said, and
added that if Lake Lagunita filled,
their location near the lake would
benefit their rush effort.
'If one frat fails it shows the weak
ness of the system," he said, "but
houses are responsible themselves
for having or not having a good rush.
The IFC in the past hasn't taken an
active role in supporting individual
frats."
Triska said fraternities don't like
the guaranteed housing system "be
cause it leaves very little individuality
in the houses. It's a kind of forced
rent we're paying."
Fraternities will work closer to
gether this spring to try to reduce
bidding overlap which has weakened
rush results in th»> past, Butler said.
Bidding overlap occurs when several
fraternities bid for the same person.
Bids, the formal invitations to join
the national fraternities, will be is
sued about May 3 or 4, Triska said.

Only 11.6 per cent of the U.S.S.R.'s
foreign trade is with developing
countries where, Smyslov said, the
Soviets maintain a policy of
"sovereignty, equality and nori
iiiterference in internal affairs."
He said the new Russian five-year
economic plan provides for further
development of foreign trade in rec
ognition of "international divisions
of labor."

fails to meet its shares for two con
secutive years," the CHP continues,
"then the Office of Residential fdu
cation will decide if the house with
the greatest share deficit over the
previous two years should enter the
draw system."
Butler said the sophomore equiva
lent formula (based on members'
remaining years of guaranteed hous
ing) used to establish the quota
count is not an accurate reflection of
fraternity housing status.
About the same number of people
have been entering the fraternities
each year, even though the official
CHP quota has not been met, he ad
ded.
"We're missing the University
guidelines, but the frats haven't been
suffering," Butler said.
Tom Hornbeak, assistant director
of residential education and frater
nity adviser, said he believes the CHP
rules are flexible. However, he ex
pressed concern over the outcome
of the Alpha Delts' rush, and s*id
they would need to consider other

options if they failed again to reach
their housing quota.
Triska said it did not seem fair the
Alpha Delts (who have 14 open
spaces this quarter) should "get the
shaft after two bad years. They've
had an unfair reputation as being a
drug frat," he said. "The reputation
is bogus. They've gotten an unneces
sary share of bad press.
"They've got really responsible
leaders this year," he said, and
added that if Lake Lagunita filled,
their location near the lake would
benefit their rush effort.
'If one frat fails it shows the weak
ness of the system," he said, "but
houses are responsible themselves
for having or not having a good rush.
The IFC in the past hasn't taken an
active role in supporting individual
frats."
Triska said fraternities don't like
the guaranteed housing system "be
cause it leaves very little individuality
in the houses. It's a kind of forced
rent we're paying."
Fraternities will work closer to
gether this spring to try to reduce
bidding overlap which has weakened
rush results in th»> past, Butler said.
Bidding overlap occurs when several
fraternities bid for the same person.
Bids, the formal invitations to join
the national fraternities, will be is
sued about May 3 or 4, Triska said.

Only 11.6 per cent of the U.S.S.R.'s
foreign trade is with developing
countries where, Smyslov said, the
Soviets maintain a policy of
"sovereignty, equality and nori
iiiterference in internal affairs."
He said the new Russian five-year
economic plan provides for further
development of foreign trade in rec
ognition of "international divisions
of labor."
Smyslov said he hopes the
Tentative planning for spring
fraternity rush has been completed,
according to this year's Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFC) Rush Chair
man, Mark Triska.
The fraternity group, which as a
whole has failed two of the last three
years to reach its housing quota, will
launch its annual drive to recruit
pledges April 10, and wind up the
rush May 5 and 6, with formal frater
nity bid parties, Triska said.
After two weeks of "open
houses," the third week of rush will
be changed this year to a more "per
sonal or intimate" format because by
then fraternities will have some idea
of individuals' fraternity prefer
ences.
By the third week, "the effective
ness of handshaking has worn out,"
noted Reid Butler, IFC President.
"Fraternities will be encouraged to
schedule their activities on their
own." This anticipated change is sub
ject to final IFC approval, he added.
Since the establishment of the
University's Guaranteed Housing
Plan (CHP) in 1975, the fraternity sys
tem has failed twice to reach its set
quotas of non-freshmen housing
spaces. Eight fraternities were un
able to reach their quotas last spring,
and the Alpha Delts have failed two
years in a row.
If a fraternity fails to meet its hous-

ing responsibilities three of four
consecutive years, "members of the
Office of Residential Education will
meet with house officers and alumni
representatives and then determine
whether the house should enter the
draw system," according to CHP
guidelines.
"If the fraternity system as a whole
fails to meet its shares for two con
secutive years," the CHP continues,
"then the Office of Residential fdu
cation will decide if the house with
the greatest share deficit over the
previous two years should enter the
draw system."
