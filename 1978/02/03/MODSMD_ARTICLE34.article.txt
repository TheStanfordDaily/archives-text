Hearst appeals to High Court
Washington — Newspaper heiress Patty Hearst
asked the Supreme Court yesterday to review her
conviction for taking part in a 1974 bank robbery
with members of the radical Symbionese Libera
tion Army.
Hearst, now 23, was sentenced to seven years in
prison in 1976 and is currently free on a $1 million
bond under the condition that she live with her
parents, Mr. and Mrs. Randolph Hearst.
In his brief filed with the high court, Hearst's
lawyer, F. Lee Bailey, said her conviction was
based in part on evidence of participation in a later
holdup at a Los Angeles sporting goods store.
Bailey said the facts of that crime should not
have been admitted during the bank robbery trial.
Bailey also contested a ruling by the U.S. Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals that Hearst waived her
Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.
Soviets eye break with Cambodia
Moscow — The Soviet Union appears headed
toward a final break with Cambodia, the radical
Indochinese nation whose take-over by the Com
munists in the 1975 war was first applauded by the
Kremlin.
Cambodia's border war with Vietnam, a close
Soviet ally, has hastened the deteriorating in rela
tions. But Soviet diplomats had been hinting since
early December — well before the border fighting
peaked — that relations were headed downhill for
a variety of other reasons as well.
Since 1975, Cambodia has reportedly spurned
Soviet offers of economic aid, citing the Kremlin's
past recognition of the pro-Western Cambodian
government of Lon Nol, ousted by the Communist
rebels.
The Cambodian Communists never permitted
the Soviets to open an embassy in Phnom Penh,
the Cambodian capital, and pulled all their dip
lomats out of Moscow last summer.
When the long-simmering Cambodian-
Vietnamese border squabble escalated late last
year, the Russian media began reprinting foreign
reports accusing Cambodia of aggression and of
receiving help from Communist China, Moscow's
arch-enemy.

Defense spending hike sought
Washington — Secretary of Defense Harold
Brown said yesterday the United States must in
crease its defense spending by $56 billion over the
next five years in order to stay up with Russia.
He said also that Soviet advances in satellite
destroying weapons are leaving the United States
with little choice but to get into a space weapons
race with Russia.
The report was issued the same day Brown went
to Congress to ask for $126 billion in military
spending for next year.
The total spending authority requested is up
$9.2 billion from the authority voted by Congress
for the current fiscal year. Brown said the Penta
gon is planning for growth to a total budget of
$172.7 billion in fiscal 1983 to keep the United
States from falling behind Russia.
The budget request brought prompt criticism
from a group of House liberals.
The congressmen charged that the budget was a
violation of President Jimmy Carter's statement
during the 1976 presidential campaign that de
fense expenditures could be reduced by about $5
billion to $7 billion per year without danger.
Progress seen in coal strike
Washington — United Mine Workers President
Arnold Miller summoned his union's bargaining
council to Washington yesterday as negotiators
neared agreement on contract terms which could
end the 59-day-old coal strike.
But as the talks continued, fresh violence was
reported in the coal fields and new steps were
announced to deal with the effect that dwindling
coal supplies are having on electrical capacity. '
Negotiators for the UMW and the Bituminous
Coal Operators Association met through the day
to narrow their differences on wages and other
economic issues and were "very close" to agree
ment, sources said.
Miller scheduled a meeting this morning of the
union's bargaining council, which must approve
any contract before a ratification vote can be taken
by the rank and file.

Hearst appeals to High Court
Washington — Newspaper heiress Patty Hearst
asked the Supreme Court yesterday to review her
conviction for taking part in a 1974 bank robbery
with members of the radical Symbionese Libera
tion Army.
Hearst, now 23, was sentenced to seven years in
prison in 1976 and is currently free on a $1 million
bond under the condition that she live with her
parents, Mr. and Mrs. Randolph Hearst.
In his brief filed with the high court, Hearst's
lawyer, F. Lee Bailey, said her conviction was
based in part on evidence of participation in a later
holdup at a Los Angeles sporting goods store.
Bailey said the facts of that crime should not
have been admitted during the bank robbery trial.
Bailey also contested a ruling by the U.S. Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals that Hearst waived her
Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.
Soviets eye break with Cambodia
Moscow — The Soviet Union appears headed
toward a final break with Cambodia, the radical
Indochinese nation whose take-over by the Com
munists in the 1975 war was first applauded by the
Kremlin.
Cambodia's border war with Vietnam, a close
Soviet ally, has hastened the deteriorating in rela
tions. But Soviet diplomats had been hinting since
early December — well before the border fighting
peaked — that relations were headed downhill for
a variety of other reasons as well.
Since 1975, Cambodia has reportedly spurned
Soviet offers of economic aid, citing the Kremlin's
past recognition of the pro-Western Cambodian
government of Lon Nol, ousted by the Communist
rebels.
The Cambodian Communists never permitted
the Soviets to open an embassy in Phnom Penh,
the Cambodian capital, and pulled all their dip
lomats out of Moscow last summer.
When the long-simmering Cambodian-
Vietnamese border squabble escalated late last
year, the Russian media began reprinting foreign
reports accusing Cambodia of aggression and of
receiving help from Communist China, Moscow's
arch-enemy.

Defense spending hike sought
Washington — Secretary of Defense Harold
Brown said yesterday the United States must in
crease its defense spending by $56 billion over the
next five years in order to stay up with Russia.
He said also that Soviet advances in satellite
destroying weapons are leaving the United States
with little choice but to get into a space weapons
race with Russia.
The report was issued the same day Brown went
to Congress to ask for $126 billion in military
spending for next year.
The total spending authority requested is up
$9.2 billion from the authority voted by Congress
for the current fiscal year. Brown said the Penta
gon is planning for growth to a total budget of
$172.7 billion in fiscal 1983 to keep the United
States from falling behind Russia.
The budget request brought prompt criticism
from a group of House liberals.
The congressmen charged that the budget was a
violation of President Jimmy Carter's statement
during the 1976 presidential campaign that de
fense expenditures could be reduced by about $5
billion to $7 billion per year without danger.

toward a final break with Cambodia, the radical
Indochinese nation whose take-over by the Com
munists in the 1975 war was first applauded by the
Kremlin.
Cambodia's border war with Vietnam, a close
Soviet ally, has hastened the deteriorating in rela
tions. But Soviet diplomats had been hinting since
early December — well before the border fighting
peaked — that relations were headed downhill for
a variety of other reasons as well.
Since 1975, Cambodia has reportedly spurned
Soviet offers of economic aid, citing the Kremlin's
past recognition of the pro-Western Cambodian
government of Lon Nol, ousted by the Communist
rebels.
The Cambodian Communists never permitted
the Soviets to open an embassy in Phnom Penh,
the Cambodian capital, and pulled all their dip
lomats out of Moscow last summer.
When the long-simmering Cambodian-
Vietnamese border squabble escalated late last
year, the Russian media began reprinting foreign
reports accusing Cambodia of aggression and of
receiving help from Communist China, Moscow's
arch-enemy.

Defense spending hike sought
Washington — Secretary of Defense Harold
Brown said yesterday the United States must in
crease its defense spending by $56 billion over the
next five years in order to stay up with Russia.
He said also that Soviet advances in satellite
destroying weapons are leaving the United States
with little choice but to get into a space weapons
race with Russia.
The report was issued the same day Brown went
to Congress to ask for $126 billion in military
spending for next year.
The total spending authority requested is up
$9.2 billion from the authority voted by Congress
for the current fiscal year. Brown said the Penta
gon is planning for growth to a total budget of
$172.7 billion in fiscal 1983 to keep the United
States from falling behind Russia.
The budget request brought prompt criticism
from a group of House liberals.
The congressmen charged that the budget was a
violation of President Jimmy Carter's statement
during the 1976 presidential campaign that de
fense expenditures could be reduced by about $5
billion to $7 billion per year without danger.
Progress seen in coal strike
Washington — United Mine Workers President
Arnold Miller summoned his union's bargaining
council to Washington yesterday as negotiators
neared agreement on contract terms which could
end the 59-day-old coal strike.
But as the talks continued, fresh violence was
reported in the coal fields and new steps were
announced to deal with the effect that dwindling
coal supplies are having on electrical capacity. '
Negotiators for the UMW and the Bituminous
Coal Operators Association met through the day
to narrow their differences on wages and other
economic issues and were "very close" to agree
ment, sources said.
Miller scheduled a meeting this morning of the
union's bargaining council, which must approve
any contract before a ratification vote can be taken
by the rank and file.
