# CIR selections discussed
## 
### Bill Burger 
Several students met with Presi
dent Richard Lyman and other ad
ministrators yesterday to discuss the
nomination of students to the Com
mission on Investment Responsibil
ity (CIR).
Both Lyman and ASSU Senate
Chairperson Fred Crethel said no
substantive agreements were
reached at the meeting but said the
airing of the groups' respective vie
wpoints was encouraging.
The meeting was "constructive, in
the sense people were hearing each
other's opinions," Lyman said. "Of
course, that doesn't mean they were
agreeing with each other."
Crethel said he was "encouraged
by the tenor of the meeting." He
cautioned, however, that it "was not
all that productive. We still have
basic differences of opinion that
exist that have not been resolved."
Crethel also said Lyman told stu
dents at the meeting that the three
students selected to serve on the CIR
would not represent the student
body but would simply act as indi
viduals.
Lyman told the Daily last night he
"fully expects to confirm the three
students selected to serve on the
CIR." He warned that "no presiden
tial appointment is automatic but
one doesn't ask people to go
through this type of procedure and
not confirm them" for trivial reasons.
He added the burden of proof
would be on him if he were not to
confirm any or all of the three.
Crethel said he wanted the 12 stu
dents who will meet Saturday to
select the three CIR student mem
bers to know they don't have to
choose three to serve. Crethel said
Lyons agreed that the students have
the option of not selecting CIR
members.
Grethel said Lyons told those at the
meeting that the 12 students would
be given a packet of information on
the CIR controversy which will pre
sent both sides' views.

Lyman indicated an interest in
meeting with theASSU Senatesome
time after the Board of Trustees' Feb.
14 meeting, Grethel added. Crethel
said he would arrange for such a
meeting.
Lyman told the Daily that he would
attend if invited.
Crethel said Lyman also gave sev
eral reasons explaining why the trus
tees might not agree to meet with
students. Those reasons, according
to Crethel, included: the historical
unproductivity of such meetings, the
board's belief in the effectiveness of
the current methods of communica
tion between students and trustees,
and the trustees' belief that the
board acts as a group and does not
like to have individuals speak for it.
Administrators present included
Lyman; Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president for public affairs; James
Lyons, dean of student affairs; Jean
Fetter and Robert Hamrdla, assis
tants to the president.
