"Foreign economic relations are
becoming more and more important
for the Soviet economy," said Dmitri
Smyslov yesterday in a talk to the In
ternational Business Association.
Smyslov, a senior researcher at the
Institute of World Economics and In
ternational Relations of the U.S.S.R.,
addressed the topic of foreign
economic relations of the Soviet
Union during a three-day visit to
Stanford that ended yesterday.
The Soviet Union currently trades
with 117 countries. Smyslov said
Soviet trade is predominantly with
socialist nations, but added that
Soviets actively engage in trade with
industrially developed, "shall we say
. . . capitalist countries."

U.S.S.R. will increase its present
share in U.S. foreign trade, which is
less than one per cent.
Russia's program for foreign trade
includes three major aims, he said.
The first one is to improve the quality
of Soviet-produced goods to make
them competitive on world markets
and bring in much needed foreign
currency.
The seconH is to make "more ef
fective use of imported com
modities," and the third, to change
the organizational structure of the
foreign ministry of trade. The overall
purpose of the program is aimed at

improving Soviet living standards.
Smyslov has just completed his
second book, "Gold Exchange Stan
dard: Formation, Crisis and Re
form." He has also written several
articles and translated works from
English to Russian.
He is spending two months in the
United States vis'ting major univer
sities, banks and economic research
institutes.
In an interview Wednesday, the
Soviet economist said the purpose of
his visit is to meet authors of works
he has read, to exchange ideas and to
obtain literature not yet published.
