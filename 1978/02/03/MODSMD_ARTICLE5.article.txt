# ...as Hillel committee presents him with appeal
## 
### 
An appeal on behalf of five Soviet
Jewish economists was presented to
visiting Soviet economist Dimitri
Smyslov yesterday afternoon by the
Hillel Oppressed Jewry Committee.
The letter, signed by three mem
bers of the ASSU Council of Presi
dents, campus religious leaders and
Economics Department members,
was offered by Brian Rosmar,, a
member of the committee, and four
others during a 20-minute meeting
with Smyslov at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
Rosman said Smyslov disagreed
with the appeal but accepted the let
ter. "He said he is not in a position to
accept and he said he has no influ
ence with his government," Rosman
added.
Smyslov, a senior researcher at the
Institute of World Economics and In

ternational Relations of the U.S.S.R.,
ended his three-day Stanford visit
last night.
The appeal stated that the issue of
Soviet anti-semitism is a humanita
rian issue that affects U.S.-U.S.S.R.
relations. The five economists are
"refuseniks" — meaning they have
been denied permission to emigrate.
"We feel we accomplished some
thing," Rosman said, "because this
attention will help the oppressed
Soviet Jews." He quoted Smyslov
saying there was "no Soviet anti
semitism."
Signers of the petition include
COP members Steve Westly, Anne
Henkels and Greg Larson, Hillel Di
rector Mark Cartun, Dean of the
Chape! Robert Hamerton-Kelly,
Episcopal chaplain Donald Fox and
Economics Profs. Victor Fuchs and
Mordecai Kurz.
