Washington (AP) â€” Negotiators
for the United Mine Workers
union and the coal industry, re
ported at one point "very close"
to a deal, recessed their talks early
today without settling on terms
that could end a record 60-day
strike.
Chief federal mediator Wayne
Horvitz announced shortly after
midnight that 14 hours of talks had
failed to produce an accord.
