# How the cost of being a student outpaces rising income
## 
### Emily Sachar News Analysis 
Student budget costs here have been ris
ing faster than median lamily income for the
past five years, according tc a set of figures
compiled by Raymond Bacchetti, vice pro
vost of budget and planning.
However, a separate report, "Budget and
Financial Planning at Stanford," published
under Bacchetti's direction, neglects to use
these figures. Thus it does not state that over
the past four years, growth of student
budgets has been higher than growth of
median family income.
Student budgets include costs of tuition,
room, board, books, supplies and spending
money.
The report indicates that over a 12-year
period student budget costs as a per cent of
median family income have remained fairly
constant.
The report draws this conclusion after
comparing two years, 1965-66, and 1975-76.
According to the report, tuition comprised

29.3 per cent of income in 1%5-66 and only
29.0 per cent in 1975-76.
However, when using statistics of median
family income growth and student budget
costs from the last four years, a different
picture emerges.
When questioned, Bacchetti revealed the
following statistics:
— In 1975-76, student budgets grew 12.2
per cent compared with an increase of only
8.4 per cent in median family income.
— In 1976-77, student costs grew 9.5 per
cent while family income grew 8.8 per cent.
— And in 1977-78, figures of 8.9 per cent
and 8.5 per cent were given for student costs
and family income, respectively.
Only in the last year has growth of stu
dents costs been at a rate slow enough to
approach family income.
"Our expenses simply have been rising
and we must level the growth rates over
time, not overnight," Bacchetti said.
Bacchetti estimates that growth of student
budgets for 1978-79 will be close to 8.6 per

cent and median family income will be near
that at 8.5 per cent.
One index used to measure costs here is
the Stanford Price Index. The index indicates
the cost to buy the same goods and services
from year to year. The index does not reflect
growth, quality improvements and shrin
kage in programs and services, according to
B icchetti.
Over the last four years Stanford's price
index has also been growing more rapidly
than the nationwide higher education price
index.
"We can explain the Stanford increase by
saying that the mix of things we buy to oper
ate our University is more expensive than
the mix used in general education nation
wide," Bacchetti said.
"Most universities don't buy their books
overseas. We buy 60 per cent of ours over
seas. We also have overseas campuses and
inflation is rising faster in those spots than it
is here," Bacchetti continued.
In 1975-76 Stanford's index rose 10.7 per

cent while the nationwide index grew only
b.6 per cent. The following year, Stanford's
index indicated growth of 11.2 per cent,
compared to a 6.3 per cent national increase.
According to Bacchetti, income to the
University must increase when costs, such
as those described, rise.
"In the '50s and '60s inflation rose at a rate
of under four per cent, while it increases at
more than six per cent now. Basic costs to
operate the University then were not rising
nearly as much as they are today. Also, the
PACE program, an endowment collection,
stopped in the mid-'6os," Bacchetti said.
"Further, University enrollment was grow
ing until 1971-72 and bringing in more
money than it was increasing costs. Now we
aren't growing so we are hit harder by infla
tion and other factors," Bacchetti said.
Presently 51 per cent of the $108.7 million
operating budget of the University comes
through tuition income, and 12 per cent of
the income comes from endowments. A
combination of other sources comprises the

additional 37 per cent of University income,
according to Bacchetti.
"We have an ambitious program to raise
money," surpassed only by Harvard and the
University of California, Bacchetti said.
"But there has been a tremendous change
in national priorities with respect to higher
education. There is tremendous competi
tion for public resources with environmen
tal concerns, medical care and other ex
penses. These are new forces with which we
must contend," Bacchetti said.
Provost William Miller has analyzed the
hardships these trends can cause families,
according to Bacchetti. The University in
tends to continue meeting the de
monstrated need of any undergraduate by
supplying appropriate financial aid, Bac
chetti said.
Because growth of college costs and fam
ily income are beginning to meet one
another, costs alone will not be a barrier to
college choice, Bacchetti said.
