# ASSU dawdling
## CIR with students is better 
### 
Richard Lyman

The decision of the ASSU Senate to
"boycott" the reconstituted CIR by
refusing to nominate student mem
bers and my decision to use a diffe
rent method of selecting student
members have evoked a controversy
that combines "constitutional" law
and social policy in a mixture that
may well obscure all of the issues
from clear view. Let me try to de
scribe the issues as I see them.
The heart of the matter is, of
course, the new policy on invest
ment responsibility, adopted by the
Board of Trustees in December,
1977. That this is a controversial
document should surprise no one.
There are very real and quite honest
differences about the extent to
which a university should be en
gaged in matters of social policy that
do not substantially affect its main
purposes of teaching and research.
It's important to recognize that
those differences are not between
the Trustees and everyone else. They
exist among the Trustees, among fa
culty, and, I have found, among stu
dents as well.
The previous policy, adopted in
1971, was the first attempt at Stanford
to deal with that controversy, and
one of the first in the country. It was
itself controversial; so much so that
an effort was undertaken last Sum
mer to see if a better formulation of
policy could be found. The product
of that effort was again controversial;
so much so that the three student
members of the Bracewell Commit
tee substantially disavowed the
Committee report even as they ag
reed to sign it.
The Board of Trustees, in its consi
dered view of the matter — and their
consideration of it was both serious
and lengthy — amended the
Bracewell Committee recommenda
tions so as to give explicit recogni
tion to their duties — unavoidable in
any case under the law — as holders
of the Stanford trust.
Boycott pointless
Not surprisingly, that action is con
troversial. There is no way to avoid
controversy over a subject on which
there are differing points of view.
Nor would it be desirable to try to
avoid it. The question is, how do we
deal with it?
The student government has cho
sen to deal with the controversy by
boycotting the entire process. They
apparently believe that their refusal
to nominate students to the CIR will
paralyze that body and thereby cause
the Trustees to change the policy in
ways that are acceptable to the Se
nate and the Council of Presidents.
But if paralysis of the CIR were in
fact to occur, the immediate and
main effect would not be a change of

policy, but the inability of the Uni
versity to deal, in a thoughtful and
orderly manner, with the agenda of
proxy votes and other investments
responsibility matters now before it.
The entire institution — students, fa
culty, staff, alumni, and trustees —
would be deprived of that opportun
ity. To me, that is not an acceptable
outcome.
My own approach to dealing with
the controversy is to recognize that it
exists and that changes of a word
here and phrase there will not make
it disappear. After a great deal of hard
work and serious thought we now
have a poiicy and a process which,
while flawed in some respects from
almost everyone's point-of-view, is a
substantial improvement over its
predecessor. Indeed, there is hardly
any dispute over that proposition.
I want the poiicy and the process to
be tested by action on specific cases.
Both the policy and the process will
evolve over time, at least through in
terpretation and perhaps by
amendment. (That possibility is
explicitly referred to in the conclud
ing provision of the CIR guidelines.) I
am certain that 'he Board of Trustees'
commitment to weigh issues of so
cial responsibility was thoughtfully
made and will be conscientiously
prosecuted.
This line of reasoning led me to
conclude that it is necessary for the
CIR to work, and that a CIR with stu
dents is better than a CIR without
them.
Emergency powers
The decision to choose students
for the CIR by random process has
precedent within the University. It
was last done in connection with the
judicial system and the analogy to the
present situation is not especially
apt. That previous action was clearly
based on emergency powers given to
the President by the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. There are no such
specifications — including, as I shall
make clear, the ASSU Constitution
— governing the selection of stu
dents to University Committees.
It is important now to see what the
ASSU Constitution actually says, for
that is a bit different from the de
scriptions of what it says that have
recently appeared in print. Article I,
Section 2, says "All registered stu
dents of Stanford University and only
such persons, shall be members of
this Association. . . Article I, Sec
tion 3, says, in relevant part, "The
Association shall be the sole rep
resentative of the entire, Stanford
student body. A. Only the Associa
tion and its designees shall represent
the entire Stanford student body in
any dealings with other elements of
the University."

Article 11, Section 8, speaks specifi
cally to the matter of nominations,
and says, "All representatives of the
Association on ad hoc and standing
committees ot the University Presi
dent and of the Academic Senate . . .
shall be selected by the ASSU Com
mittee on Nominations, subject to
the approval of the Senate."
Appointments consistent
In fact, nothing that has been
done, or is proposed to be done,
contravenes the language and mean
ing of the ASSU Constitution. The
ASSU was asked to nominate "rep
resentatives of the Association" to
serve on the CIR. It refused to do so.
There is nothing in the Constitu
tion, nor in logic could there be, to
prevent the President from appoint
ing individual students to serve in
their capacity as individuals. The
ASSU Constitution speaks to the
powers of the ASSU, not to the pow
ers and duties of the President, the
faculty, or individual members of the
student body.
Furthermore, the proposed ap
pointment of students is entirely
consistent with the policy on invest
ment responsibility. That policy does
not speak of "representation."
Rather, it establishes a CIR "to be
composed of persons appointed by
the President from each of the com
ponents of the University commun
ity. .
There are many reasons why it
would be preferable for the ASSU
Senate to nominate student mem
bers. By custom and tradition that is
the preferred method of selection.
But that preference cannot, in my
view, override the interests of other
members of the University, or the
requirements of sound policy, gen
erally.
Nor is there time, after alt of the
ASSU's obstruction and delay, for
further dawdling; proxies come in
with short deadlines, and some (for
tunately not the most significant)
have already passed us by.
The main issue before us is not one
of constitutional interpretation, or of
the "power" of the ASSU Senate ver
sus the "power" of the President of
the University. For me to arrange for
the random selection of students is
hardly an awesome exercise of
"power" in any event!
The issue now is whether we will
get on with the business of trying to
work out in practice what it means
for a university to be a responsible
investor. I believe that there is wide
spread support within the University
community for doing just that.

University.)
