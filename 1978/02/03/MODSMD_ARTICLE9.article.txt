# Rising costs no excuse
## Doctors should not advertise services 
### 
David Sartoris

The Federal Trade Commission is
currently debating the issue of
whether or not American physicians
should be allowed to advertise their
services. At present, the American
Medical Association as well as
numerous local medical societies
prohibit such activities by their
members, regarding it as a flagrant
violation of medical ethics. The FTC,
on the other hand, maintains that the
advertising ban transgresses anti
trust laws by encouraging uniform
fees ana discouraging competition
among physicians.
The moven.ent promoting physi
cian advertising has been initiated
primarily by consumer groups whose
legions have become disgruntled
with the rising costs of medical ser
vices, particularly fees charged by
private doctors. By introducing
capitalism into medical practice, they
hope to simultaneously increase the
quality of health care and reduce its
impact on the patient's pocketbook.
However, legal medical advertising

would not only fail to achieve these
goals Out would also wreak havoc on
the health care system in America.
In the first place, the current de
mand for doctors is such that few
physicians would find advertising
necessary to attract patients even if it
were permitted. Those likely to
utilize the media would be individu
als with a previous record of poor
patient care who find it difficult to
build and maintain a clientele —
"quacks," in consumer jargon. Un
like most, these doctors might be wil
ling to lower their fees and foster the
competition desired by much of the
public. However, increased visits to
such physicians as a result of advertis
ing would inevitably lead to more pa
tient dissatisfaction and a greater
number of malpractice suits.
Secondly, advertising is likely to
evolve into solicitation, manifested
as testimonials or claims that a par
ticular physician provides superior
treatment at lower cost. Such
"hucksterism," as labelled by AMA

Executive Vice-President James
Sammons, would instill an aura of
the bygone tonic salesman into
modern medical practice. More im
portantly, legal problems focusing
on the issue of false advertising,
which presently affect numerous
consumer products, would further
complicate the situation.
Finally, anti-trust action against the
medical profession is likely to foster
just that — diminished trust and
cooperation between physicians.
While many patients may feel that
the existing camaraderie among doc
tors is detrimental to the cost and
delivery of health care, the opposite
is actually true. Willingness to refer
patients, seek colleague consulta
tion, and transfer patient records
would be considerably hampered by
the competitive consequences of
legal medical advertising.
Consumer goals of higher quality
health care at lower prices might be
better attained via measures which
allow greater patient access to physi
cian credentials. Aside from the edu
cational history gleaned from office

wall diplomas, most Americans pre
sently know very little about their
doctors. Information regarding per
formance during medical training,
post-certification educational ex
periences, previous patient impres
sions (including malpractice suits),
and level of competence in handling
specific medical problems would re
lieve much of the present anxiety as
sociated with choice of a new physi
cian. In addition, it would allow for
greater consumer selectivity, more
conscientious patient care, and
fewer malpraci're conflicts.
The American public and the FTC
are clearly justified in their desire for
improved health care at lower cost.
However, support of physician ad
vertising constitutes the wrong
means to the right end. Use of the
media by private doctors should be
restricted to newly-certified indi
viduals in i!ie process of establishing
practice, and then only as an alerting
device.

The Federal Trade Commission is
currently debating the issue of
whether or not American physicians
should be allowed to advertise their
services. At present, the American
Medical Association as well as
numerous local medical societies
prohibit such activities by their
members, regarding it as a flagrant
violation of medical ethics. The FTC,
on the other hand, maintains that the
advertising ban transgresses anti
trust laws by encouraging uniform
fees ana discouraging competition
among physicians.
The moven.ent promoting physi
cian advertising has been initiated
primarily by consumer groups whose
legions have become disgruntled
with the rising costs of medical ser
vices, particularly fees charged by
private doctors. By introducing
capitalism into medical practice, they
hope to simultaneously increase the
quality of health care and reduce its
impact on the patient's pocketbook.
However, legal medical advertising

would not only fail to achieve these
goals Out would also wreak havoc on
the health care system in America.
In the first place, the current de
mand for doctors is such that few
physicians would find advertising
necessary to attract patients even if it
were permitted. Those likely to
utilize the media would be individu
als with a previous record of poor
patient care who find it difficult to
build and maintain a clientele —
"quacks," in consumer jargon. Un
like most, these doctors might be wil
ling to lower their fees and foster the
competition desired by much of the
public. However, increased visits to
such physicians as a result of advertis
ing would inevitably lead to more pa
tient dissatisfaction and a greater
number of malpractice suits.
Secondly, advertising is likely to
evolve into solicitation, manifested
as testimonials or claims that a par
ticular physician provides superior
treatment at lower cost. Such
"hucksterism," as labelled by AMA

Executive Vice-President James
Sammons, would instill an aura of
the bygone tonic salesman into
modern medical practice. More im
portantly, legal problems focusing
on the issue of false advertising,
which presently affect numerous
consumer products, would further
complicate the situation.
Finally, anti-trust action against the
medical profession is likely to foster
just that — diminished trust and
cooperation between physicians.
While many patients may feel that
the existing camaraderie among doc
tors is detrimental to the cost and
delivery of health care, the opposite
is actually true. Willingness to refer
patients, seek colleague consulta
tion, and transfer patient records
would be considerably hampered by
the competitive consequences of
legal medical advertising.
Consumer goals of higher quality
health care at lower prices might be
better attained via measures which
allow greater patient access to physi
cian credentials. Aside from the edu
cational history gleaned from office

wall diplomas, most Americans pre
sently know very little about their
doctors. Information regarding per
formance during medical training,
post-certification educational ex
periences, previous patient impres
sions (including malpractice suits),
and level of competence in handling
specific medical problems would re
lieve much of the present anxiety as
sociated with choice of a new physi
cian. In addition, it would allow for
greater consumer selectivity, more
conscientious patient care, and
fewer malpraci're conflicts.
