# Students selected for CIR
## 
### Bill Burger 
Three students were selected
Saturday to serve on the controver
sial Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR) during an eight
hour meeting.
Susan Burrus, a junior, Lee
Goldman, a law student and Ron
Johnson, a graduate student in
economics were chosen by the 14
students randomly selected to par
ticipate in the process.
In a statement released last night,
the three newly selected CIR student
members stated, "there was mutual
agreement (among the 14) that the
for student input on the CIR
outweighed the disadvantages of
temporarily foregoing the traditional
representative selection process.
An ASSU Council of Presidents'
(COP) statement released yesterday,
though reiterating their "dismay with
the methods President Richard
Lyman has used to place students on
the CIR," said, "the statements made
by the group of 14 show a clear un
derstanding of the political implica
tions of the selection process in
itiated by President Lyman, and of
their participation in that process."
ASSU Senate Chairperson Fred

Grethel, said "the whole process was
weighed towards the administra
tion's side."
He added he was "not happy" but
not surprised by the decision to
select three students.
"If they made the decision to par
ticipate they were obviously willing
to serve," Grethel said.
Another statement, unanimously
adopted by the 14, notes that, "given
the present nomination process,
these three students are not rep
resentatives of the student body, but
are acting in their individual
capacities."
The statement further says the
three will "strive to:
—"carry out their duties responsi
bly as members of the CIR;
—"maintain communication with
the Stanford student community;
—"analyze the effectiveness of the
CIR;
—"report to the student commun
ity on CIR activities; and
—"work towards student body
representation on the CIR."
The statement adds that three CIR
members "will consider yielding
their positions on the CIR to students
recommended through the regular

nominating and appointment proce
dures."
Lloyd Dixon, a member of the ad
hoc committee on the CIR, said he
felt the 14 did not consider the fact
that the .Board of Trustees had
changed the ClR's guidelines to
make the commission less effective.
The statement by the three stu
dents, however, said they believed
"the language in the policy state
ment (of the CIR) is sufficiently broad
to allow for significant participation
by the CIR."
Graduate student William Scott,
one of the 14, said the students spent
considerable time deciding whether
to select three students or to follow
the ASSU Senate and Nomination
Committee in not appointing stu
dents to serve on the CIR.
Scott termed the 14 "biased in that
(Dean of Student Affairs James)
Lyons stressed the fact that you
should be willing to serve if you
come to the meeting (on Saturday)."
He added that only "seven or
eight" of the 14 "wanted to run for
the three commission positions."
The others disqualified themselves
before the voting, he said.
The secret ballot voting took only
one-half hour. Each member wrote
the names of the three they believed
should serve. The three members
with the highest vote totals were
those selected to the CIR.
Fourteen students attended the
selection meeting instead of 12 as
originally planned.
The two alternate CIR members
are Kim Doren, a freshman and John
(Wes) Hutchinson, a graduate stu
dent.
The remaining nine students
were: Dean Arashiro, Harry Chen,
Darcy Hallberg, John Levy, Michael
Mellenthin, Mohamed Mujtaba,
Robert (Tim) Reagan, William Scott
and Carol Toliver.
