# New Right in the spotlight

There seem to be some people
around who have nothing better to
do than predict and discern trends in
society. It's nice to know what's
going on as well as what's going to
happen. According to many of those
trend-watchers, the U.S. is entering a
more conservative era. We seem to
have discarded the apathy of the
early '70s and are emerging as more
conservative.
The growth of the New Right is
considered so important an issue
that CBS News recently conducted a
poll to find out if people are really
more conservative now than in re
cent history. And sure enough, more
people consider themselves conser
vative now than in a similar poll con
ducted a few years ago. Fewer
people consider themselves liberal.
That would be evidence enough if
CBS hadn't asked a few more ques
tions just to make sure.
When questioned on the issues,
issues which presumably should eas
ily divide liberals and conservatives,
the results were ambiguous. Often
people who called themselves con
servative took traditionally liberal
stances on key issues, such as the
need for a national health care prog
ram.
To make the results of this poll
even less meaningful, 45 per cent of
those questioned could not say what
the difference was between a con
servative and a liberal. It's hard to
understand how people can label
themselves without really under
standing the labels they use.
So, we need to ask if a New Right
exists at all. One way to answer that
question is to consider why we seem
to think conservativism is in fashion.
It isn't enough to merely go by unin
telligent statistics, or the feeling that
the people down the hall give you a
harder time now about smoking
dope than they did when you were a
freshman. Or that the class of '81
looks much more straight and clean
cut than the class of '79.
Perhaps the main reason we feel
the air to be less liberal than it used to

be is that suddenly conservatives
have jumped out of the background
and into the center spotlight. They
have organized and have become
more vocal.
A prime example of such organiza
tion is the national fight against ratifi
cation of the Panama Canal treaties.
Ronald Reagan, with the help of Sen.
Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), has organized a
"truth squad" whose duty it is to
travel the United States and convince
the American people of the folly of
the treaties.
They have just recently completed
a tour of selected parts of the coun
try, attempting to mobilize the Vete
rans of Foreign Wars and others in
herently opposed to giving away our
own little piece of Latin America.
Another example of conservative
influence is the strong re-emergence
of the right-to-lifeis. They are not
satisfied with their recent victory in
Congress, whereby they severely re
stricted the use of federal monies for
abortion. Rather, they have pledged
to see that no Congressman or
Senator who has voted for abortion
will be re-elected. No small task, but
some Congressmen are not resting
easy.
Little needs to be said of Anita
Bryant's crusade against homosexu
als and just how far her antics have
set back the drive for civil rights for
all Americans, a goal that seemed
about to be realized.
Regrouping
Shouldn't this alone prove that
people tend to be more conserva
tive? Is the United States in the pro
cess of making the famed one step
backwards after two forward? The
answers are not easy. It would be
easy to reply yes to both questions
and the temptations are great, but
the evidence is just not conclusive.
There are two other possible expla
nations.
First, there is no New Right at all,
but simply a regrouping of the Old
Right, and not necessarily along
party lines. After putting up with
years of liberal decisions by the

courts, watching support of the
"fight against Communism" dwin
dle, and the liberalization of per
sonal sexual mores, the conserva
tives have said, "Enough.",
They've gotten together the funds
they need and have instituted prog
rams to return the country to the
road they believe it should be on.
And in becoming more vocal, they
feel they might be able to attract new
recruits.
Meanwhile, the left has suffered
considerably since the end of the war
in terms of organization and unifica
tion. The void they left open has
been filled by what appears to be the
New Right.
Second, people just don't under
stand the labels they apply to them-

selves. I think that's about the only
thing the CBS poll shows. Since there
are labels for about everything, "
people can define themselves in
terms of readily available tags.
But one needs to remember that
the meanings of words tend to
change, and that this is especially
true of words which attempt to en
compass very broad areas of feelings
and beliefs. In view of what the Un
ited States and its citizens have gone
through in the last 15 years, it's easy
to see how we can be confused about
the meanings and applications of
words so amenable to change as
labels.
