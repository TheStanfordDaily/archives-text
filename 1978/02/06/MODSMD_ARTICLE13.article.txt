# For federal judges
## Research facilities poor 
### 
Washington (AP) — The typical federal judge
has poorer research facilities available to him
than a beginning law student — a predicament
that can cause delays, errors, retrials and addi
tional expense, an unreleased government
study shows.
The study, conducted for the Federal Judicial
Center, concludes that if the information defi
ciency could be cleared up there probably
would be no need for many of the 100 or more
new federal judgeships about to be created by
Congress to relieve overworked courts. The
center is an administrative arm of the federal
court system.
"If they were operating efficiently, there
might be no necessity for any new judges, and
certainly not on the appellate level," Raymond
Taylor, author of the report, said in an interview.
The House will vote tomorrow on a bill that
would add 110 district judges and 35 appeals
judges to the federal judiciary system. The Se
nate already has authorized the creation of 113

new judgeships.
"It's going to take $75,000 to $85,000 to set up
the simplest library for each one of those new
judges," he said. "Add to that a secretary, a
couple of law clerks, and if he's a trial judge,
he'll require an assignment clerk, a probation
officer.
"You don't just create 125 new judgeships.
You're creating 500 or 700 or perhaps more new
jobs to help a person to continue to operate in
an archaic, inefficient, wasteful manner."
The essential problem, Taylor's study
suggests, is that law research is still done today
essentially the way it was in Abraham Lincoln's
time — by the judge or his clerk looking up cases
and statutes in bound volumes, which very
likely won't be readily available.
At the heart of Taylor's recommendations is a
call for a central law facility which any federal
judge could contact by a toll-free long distance
telephone line or through a small, even porta
ble, computer terminal.
