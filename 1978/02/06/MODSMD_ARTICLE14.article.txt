A majorchange in Chinese-American re
lations is "less likely to be opposed to
American interests," said Douglas Murray,
director of U.S.-China Relations Program,
in a speech at the political science depart
ment here Thursday.
According to Murray, despite the death
of former communist party chairman, Mao
Tse-tung, the rise of the Gang of Four, and
a wide range of new domestic policies and
other events of the past 15 months, there
has been no reasessment of China-
American relations.
"The basic issue in U.S.-China relations
is Taiwan — the fact that there are three
conditions set out by Peking for normali
zation," Murray said. Those conditions are
that the U.S. withdraw recognition of the

government of Taiwan, remove the few
remaining troops there, and terminate the
mutual defense treaties of 1954.
However there is much debate in this
country over whether or not the United
States should abide by all three demands.
"Conservative forces here say that we
cannot abandon Taiwan. Why not go part
way and show some progress rather than
stand still?"
Murray made references to his recent
trip to China as a member of a delegation
from the U.S.-China Relations Program, a
private organization that works with the
State Department. It is considered to be
"quasi-official" by the Chinese.
"If ever a group would be able to discuss
issues, we were it,"he said.
"We could not get a discussion of

U.S.-China relations going and it was
pretty evident that before we arrived
someone had said 'put the lid on it.' "
It appears that the Chinese have given
up on the administration of President
jimmy Carter. "They (the Chinese) don't
see any desire or any likelihood of early
action toward normalization," said Mur
ray. "The Chinese just loved Richard Ni
xon," and it is more likely that they will
respond better to a Republican administ
ration. The attitude now is one of 'all in
the fullness of time," he said.
China is in a "period of relaxation." For
example the old puritanism beliefs are
subsiding, Murray said. "Each year more
and more reports about people cuddling
on the bun in Shanghai and people found
under the bushes inPeking are coming in.'
