# Southern teams spoil Stanford's weekend
## Men lose two

Proving themselves a contender for this year's NCAA team title,
UCLA easily outswam Stanford, 73-39.
Last year only one position ahead of Stanford at the NCAA
championships (6th and 7th respectively), the Bruins are now a
much improved team owing to an outstanding freshman group.
Only UCLA's Olympic gold medalist Brian Goodell was able to
capture two races, winning the 1000 yard (9:14.46) and 500 yard
(4:26.03) freestyle events.
Stanford was paced by first place finishers Mike Bruner (200
free 1:41.60), Tom O'Brien (200 fly 1:51 02), Jon Powell (100 free
46.68) and Andy Nichols (200 breast 2:09.45). Excellent times also
came from Ken Shilling, Bill Chao and Stu Corliss, who is return
ing from a bout with mononucleosis.
Losing needed points in relay and diving events, the Cards
were unable to keep the meet a close one. "They were simply a
better team," said coach Jim Caughran about UCLA. "We swam
tired and hoped for a few good times, of which there were some.
All factors considered, we swam well."
An even stronger USC squad hosted Stanford Friday evening,
and ran away with a 71-40 victory. In the first individual event,
however, Bruner set a Trojan pool record in the 1000 yard free,
cruising to an unchallenged 9:15.20, a length ahead of his nearest
competitor.
Several other Card efforts highlighted the meet. O'Brien,
swimming the event for the first time this season, powered to a
fine 4:39.7 in the 500 freestyle. Nichols (2:10.2) and Shilling
(2:11.8) posted fine times in the 200 breast. The Cardinal 400 free
relay quartet, anchored by a fast-closing Powell, nearly upset
their Trojan opponents, who currently hold the NCAA record in
the event.
"There were many good individual swims, despite the fact we
had no chance to win the meet," commented Caughran. "I am
optimistic about how we will do at the NCAA's."

co-captain has qualified for the NCAAs in both the 100 and the 200 breast.
