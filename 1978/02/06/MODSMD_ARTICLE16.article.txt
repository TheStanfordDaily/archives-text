Rising at the crack of dawn for an early morning meet with Long
Beach State, the women's swim team thrashed a weak 49er squad,
106-28.
"It really wasn't much of a meet," said assistant coach Claudia
Thomas of Saturday's competition. "We did not have to swim
very well to beat them."
The previous day's confrontation with USC, however, found
Stanford the loser, 74-57, with the outcome of the meet decided
in the final two events. Capitalizing on their home pool advan
tage, the highly regarded Trojan contingent outstarted and out
turned the unbeaten Cards, winning most of the close races.
Diver Carol Noonan and former American record holder Val
erie Lee were double winners for Stanford. Noonan, in winning
the one meter competition, qualified for the AIAW Champion
ships to be held at Duke University in March. Lee led 1-2 sweeps
in the 200 yard fly (2:06.1) and 500 yard freestyle (4:59.4). Lee is
favored to retain individual crowns at the AlAW's in the 200 fly,
500 free and 1650 and her times this year seem to support the
contention.
Stanford's gold medalist Kim Peyton faced her toughest tests
thus far this season, as she battled USC's Sue Hinderaker in the
100 free, 200 free and 400 free relay.
Peyton copped the first meeting, sprinting to a very fast 1:51.62
in the 200. Unable to close the gap on a fast starting Hinderaker,
she was touched out in the 100 free, 52.2 to 52.4. Again behind at
the start, Peyton could not overcome her USC opponent on the
final lap of the 400 free relay, although anchoring it with a fantas
tic 51.6.
The two will undoubtedly duel for the 100 and 200 freestyle
titles at the AlAW's with the nod possibly going to Peyton because
of her greater experience in championship meets.
Freshman Kim Shettle was another event winner, as she de
feated Olympian Miriam Smith in her specialty, the 400 IM
(4:39.0). Also cited for good performances were co-captain Anne
Brodell, Jo Harshbarger, and Margot Hagstette, who took the 200
IM (2:12.7).
"I think we may have the edge over USC's team at the AlAW's,"
conjectured coach Jim Gaughran after the meet. "We were
swimming without Laura Raymond and have more depth than
they."
