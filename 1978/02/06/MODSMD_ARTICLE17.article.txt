# Trojans sneak past erring Cards in final seconds, 76-74
## USC intercepts two passes, erase four point Stanford lead 
### Dave Georgette 
Los Angeles — For the USC
Trojans, it was a dream finish.
For Stanford, it was a night
mare.
After leading 74-70, with 1:14
to play Saturday in the sports
arena, the Cards twice could
not get the ball past the USC
press and ended up watching
theTrojans' Cliff Robinson hita
jumper in the lane with two
seconds left for a stunning
76-74 victory.
Twenty minutes after he had
seen his team lose its sixth con
ference game in seven starts,
Stanford coach Dick DiBiaso
said, "This is the best game
we'veplayed inquiteawhile. It
was just a matter of some un
timely mistakes."
Two of the mistakes came on
passes by Kimberly Belton.
After George Ratkovich had
canned a jumper, Belton was
double-teamed in the back
court. His errant pass was in
tercepted by Don Carfino, who
fed Purvis Mfller in the lane for
a short jumper that knotted the
score at 74-74.
Then, in trying to inbound
the ball, Belton whipped it
out-of-bounds over Mark
Pitchford's head at half court
with 48 seconds left.
USC played for the last shot,
getting the ball to Robinson in
the lane in the final seconds.
He rolled to his right, got a
half-step on Belton and sank
the shot, sending the USC
fans, band and some broadcas

ters into an unrestrained, pi
rated celebration of "All Right
Now."
"We expected the press,"
said DiBiaso. "And we ex
pected them to go inside to
Robinson."
"We were definitely going to
Robinson on the last play,"
said USC coach Bob Boyd. "We
decided to run the clock down
to about 10 seconds, then have
Cartino go to the wing, and
Cliff start high and slide low
toward the basket. The only
problem was, when he started,
Paul Henderson didn't vacate
the area, and he (Robinson)
had to zig away from Paul and
then make the basket."
But for the turnovers at the
end, Belton would have been
the game's star. A flying dunk,
his third of the half, had given
the Cards their seemingly sec
ure four point lead after they
had trailed by five points with
less than 10 minutes to play.
Belton finished with a
game-high 23 points — 17 of
those coming in the second
half — and he topped the re
bounders with 14.
The Cards also got a good
game out of flu-weakened Jay
Carter, who had 11 points and
five rebounds in 22 minutes of
action.
"I think it's apparent the
more he plays, the better we
play as a unit," said DiBiaso.
"I'm surprised he managed to
piay 22 minutes."
Robinson, one of three Tro

jans hampered by foul diffi
culty in the second half, also
made the most of his time on
the court, scoring 15 points
and collecting a Trojan game
high of 11 rebounds. "They
can't guard him," said Boyd.
Carfino lead the Trojans with
18 points and Miller added 17.
"We didn't change our basic
strategy after Robinson got
into four trouble," said Di-
Biaso. "We just continued with
our game plan and it was work
ing successfully until the last
minute."
The game plan had helped
the Cards into a 34-34 deadlock
at half. To pull even, though,
Stanford had to outscore the
Trojans 15-8 in the final six mi
nutes of the half. Stanford's
poor shooting evident Thurs
day evening against UCLA con
tinued during the first half as
they managed to make only 38
per cent of their field goal at
tempts.
In the second half the Cardi
nals made over 60 per cent of
their shots. "I was critical of
our team's defense," said
Boyd. "They went by us far too
often and made some impres
sive slam dunks.
"I think we played a little
flat," said Boyd. "I also think
we weren't necessarily as bad
as Stanford was good. I think
the game didn't have the piz
zazz for us of the one the other
night against Cal. We played
uninspired, but I repeat, Stan
ford was very good."

The win boosted USC's re
cord to 5-2 in conference and
12-8 overall. Stanford is 11-9
overall.
"Our team should take a lot
of credit for the win," said
Boyd, "but I'm also the first to
admit you need some luck and
we got some."
Along with some miscues by
the other team.
"We just made some mis
takes that shouldn't be made at
thistimeof year," said DiBiaso.

jumper in the lane with two
seconds left for a stunning
76-74 victory.
Twenty minutes after he had
seen his team lose its sixth con
ference game in seven starts,
Stanford coach Dick DiBiaso
said, "This is the best game
we'veplayed inquiteawhile. It
was just a matter of some un
timely mistakes."
Two of the mistakes came on
passes by Kimberly Belton.
After George Ratkovich had
canned a jumper, Belton was
double-teamed in the back
court. His errant pass was in
tercepted by Don Carfino, who
fed Purvis Mfller in the lane for
a short jumper that knotted the
score at 74-74.
Then, in trying to inbound
the ball, Belton whipped it
out-of-bounds over Mark
Pitchford's head at half court
with 48 seconds left.
USC played for the last shot,
getting the ball to Robinson in
the lane in the final seconds.
He rolled to his right, got a
half-step on Belton and sank
the shot, sending the USC
fans, band and some broadcas

ters into an unrestrained, pi
rated celebration of "All Right
Now."
"We expected the press,"
said DiBiaso. "And we ex
pected them to go inside to
Robinson."
"We were definitely going to
Robinson on the last play,"
said USC coach Bob Boyd. "We
decided to run the clock down
to about 10 seconds, then have
Cartino go to the wing, and
Cliff start high and slide low
toward the basket. The only
problem was, when he started,
Paul Henderson didn't vacate
the area, and he (Robinson)
had to zig away from Paul and
then make the basket."
But for the turnovers at the
end, Belton would have been
the game's star. A flying dunk,
his third of the half, had given
the Cards their seemingly sec
ure four point lead after they
had trailed by five points with
less than 10 minutes to play.
Belton finished with a
game-high 23 points — 17 of
those coming in the second
half — and he topped the re
bounders with 14.
The Cards also got a good
game out of flu-weakened Jay
Carter, who had 11 points and
five rebounds in 22 minutes of
action.
"I think it's apparent the
more he plays, the better we
play as a unit," said DiBiaso.
"I'm surprised he managed to
piay 22 minutes."
Robinson, one of three Tro

jans hampered by foul diffi
culty in the second half, also
made the most of his time on
the court, scoring 15 points
and collecting a Trojan game
high of 11 rebounds. "They
can't guard him," said Boyd.
Carfino lead the Trojans with
18 points and Miller added 17.
"We didn't change our basic
strategy after Robinson got
into four trouble," said Di-
Biaso. "We just continued with
our game plan and it was work
ing successfully until the last
minute."
The game plan had helped
the Cards into a 34-34 deadlock
at half. To pull even, though,
Stanford had to outscore the
Trojans 15-8 in the final six mi
nutes of the half. Stanford's
poor shooting evident Thurs
day evening against UCLA con
tinued during the first half as
they managed to make only 38
per cent of their field goal at
tempts.
In the second half the Cardi
nals made over 60 per cent of
their shots. "I was critical of
our team's defense," said
Boyd. "They went by us far too
often and made some impres
sive slam dunks.
"I think we played a little
flat," said Boyd. "I also think
we weren't necessarily as bad
as Stanford was good. I think
the game didn't have the piz
zazz for us of the one the other
night against Cal. We played
uninspired, but I repeat, Stan
ford was very good."

The win boosted USC's re
cord to 5-2 in conference and
12-8 overall. Stanford is 11-9
overall.
"Our team should take a lot
of credit for the win," said
Boyd, "but I'm also the first to
admit you need some luck and
we got some."
Along with some miscues by
the other team.
"We just made some mis
takes that shouldn't be made at
thistimeof year," said DiBiaso.
