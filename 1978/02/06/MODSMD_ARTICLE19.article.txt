# Spikers beat Broncos, then lose to UCLA
## 
### Ken Betts 
Stanford's Men's volleyball
team split two contests this
weekend, beating Santa Clara
while losing to UCLA. The Car
dinals won their second
straight Nor-Cal conference
game by defeating the Broncos
13-15, 15-8, 15-11 and 15-8.
However, on Saturday, Stan
ford did not fare so well, falling
to the Bruins 6-15, 1-15 and
8-15.
Coach Lambert reiterated his
earlier comments by saying,
"Inconsistency continues to
plague this team." But he ad
ded, "It has to be expected
from such a young team."
The whole Stanford front
line turned in a good perfor
mance against the Broncos
with Rod Fletcher leading the
group. Well placed spikes and

timely blocks enabled the
Cards to up their conference
record to 2-0. Against UCLA the
only bright spots in the dark
morass of Stanford's play were
again front liners, this time
Rich Vardley and Dave Carico.
Coach Lambert was, again,
not too pleased with the per
formance of his team. Many of
the same problems he has had
to deal with thus far this season
haunted the Cardinals last
weekend. Lambert explained,
"the passing is still not what I
had hoped it would be, and I
expect we will spend a lot of
time this week working on it."
The defense, which ap
peared to be relatively consis
tent against Stanislaus State,
was not to Lambert's liking, "I
was not pleased with the de
fense in either game this

weekend."
But the most vexing problem
appears to be setting. Lambert,
who realized that it would be a
problem before the season be
gan, has apparently decided
that his original offensive
line-up with three alternate
setters was not working very
well. So he has decided, "to
change rotations into a 5-1,
which means we will now have
only one setter as opposed to
three. I hope this will add more
consistency to our setting."
While Lambert is certainly
not pleased with losing in three
straight games to UCLA, he
does feel that "some of the
things we are working on are
improving." However, he can
didly added that, "we started
out so low that what improve
ment we had was certainly not
enough against UCLA."
Lambert did not expect to
beat UCLA, but he said, "I
thought we could do better,
and there was a complete
breakdown in the second
game. I think we did well con
sidering how young we are,
and I was impressed with the
team's attitude."
When asked whether the
match with UCLA might have
taught the Cards something,
he replied, "When you play the
best it is always worthwhile. It
can help your confidence
when you play against people
better than you, and it certainly
teaches you a lot."
Stanford's next match is
against Pepperdineon Feb. 9at
Pepperdine.

straight Nor-Cal conference
game by defeating the Broncos
13-15, 15-8, 15-11 and 15-8.
However, on Saturday, Stan
ford did not fare so well, falling
to the Bruins 6-15, 1-15 and
8-15.
Coach Lambert reiterated his
earlier comments by saying,
"Inconsistency continues to
plague this team." But he ad
ded, "It has to be expected
from such a young team."
The whole Stanford front
line turned in a good perfor
mance against the Broncos
with Rod Fletcher leading the
group. Well placed spikes and

timely blocks enabled the
Cards to up their conference
record to 2-0. Against UCLA the
only bright spots in the dark
morass of Stanford's play were
again front liners, this time
Rich Vardley and Dave Carico.
Coach Lambert was, again,
not too pleased with the per
formance of his team. Many of
the same problems he has had
to deal with thus far this season
haunted the Cardinals last
weekend. Lambert explained,
"the passing is still not what I
had hoped it would be, and I
expect we will spend a lot of
time this week working on it."
The defense, which ap
peared to be relatively consis
tent against Stanislaus State,
was not to Lambert's liking, "I
was not pleased with the de
fense in either game this

weekend."
But the most vexing problem
appears to be setting. Lambert,
who realized that it would be a
problem before the season be
gan, has apparently decided
that his original offensive
line-up with three alternate
setters was not working very
well. So he has decided, "to
change rotations into a 5-1,
which means we will now have
only one setter as opposed to
three. I hope this will add more
consistency to our setting."
While Lambert is certainly
not pleased with losing in three
straight games to UCLA, he
does feel that "some of the
things we are working on are
improving." However, he can
didly added that, "we started
out so low that what improve
ment we had was certainly not
enough against UCLA."
Lambert did not expect to
beat UCLA, but he said, "I
thought we could do better,
and there was a complete
breakdown in the second
game. I think we did well con
sidering how young we are,
and I was impressed with the
team's attitude."
When asked whether the
match with UCLA might have
taught the Cards something,
he replied, "When you play the
best it is always worthwhile. It
can help your confidence
when you play against people
better than you, and it certainly
teaches you a lot."
Stanford's next match is
against Pepperdineon Feb. 9at
Pepperdine.
