Hyatt Corporation or one of five
other nationwide companies may as
sist in the management of Stanford
affiliated Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center (VMC), the Daily learned Fri
day.
The University works closely with
the financially-troubled hospital in
internship and resident programs.
According to Linda Hargrove,
spokesperson for the University
house staff office, Stanford has 58 in
terns and residents working at VMC.
Robert ]ensen, budget director of
VMC, said the six corporations com
pleted interviews with county execu
tive Bill Siegal. Siegal and a selection
committee will make recommenda
tions to the Santa Clara County Board
of Supervisors as to which corpora
tion is most suitable for assisting in
the hospital's management.
Other corporations which submit
ted bids for the management assist
ing position include Hospital Corpo
ration of America, Hospital Affiliates
International, National Medical En
terprises, Hospital Financial Services
and Delta Health Management Cor
poration, Jensen said.
The Board of Supervisors is
scheduled to take up the matter of
management assistance Feb. 14, Jen
sen said.
"So far, the board's votes concern
ing hospital management have been
i-2, and if this vote continues, the
board will direct Dr. Yvonne Russell
(current 1 director of medical institu
tions at VMC) to negotiate a contract
for the management assistance."
Jensen has said in the past that
"there are many advantages to pri
vate management assistance," ad
ding that the corporations "have
many specialists who can be called in
to do various tasks."
The management assistance plan
insures that all decisions made by the
corporation will be approved by Rus
sell.

"Private management is certainly
not taking over VMC," Jensen said.
"Minor policy decisions must be ap
proved by both Russell and the man
agement personnel, and major pol
icy decisions will require the agree
ment of Russell, management, the
county executive and the board of
supervisors."
