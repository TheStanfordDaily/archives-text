### Sukie Jackson 
Stanford's and Berkeley's
women's basketball teams
complement each other well.
The Cards are strong in the
center and forward positions
while Berkeley has several ex
cellent guards. In Saturday
night's contest between the
rival schools, the lead changed
hands four times before the
Stanford forwards led their
team to a 72-67 victory.
"The teams were evenly
matched," Bear coach Marcie
Cantrell said. "We have the
smallest average height in the
league (5-foot-7) so Stanford
had a height advantage but we
were strong where they are
weak." When Stanford jumped
to a 10 point lead at the start of
the game, Bear guards Cheryl
Johnson and Colleen Galloway
started hitting outside shots
giving Berkeley a 30-22 lead
with three minutes remaining
in the half.
Not to be outdone by Ber
keley guards, though, Card
center Maggie Nelson con
nected on two 15 foot jump
shots and forward Kathy Mur
phy sunk a basket right before
the halftime buzzer tying the
score, 34-34.
In the second half the two
teams exchanged baskets rais
ing the score to Stanford 56,
Berkeley 57. With six minutes
left in the game, good defense
by the Cards stopppd Ber-

keley's outside shooting vxhile
Nelson and Murphy continued
scoring, giving Stanford a nine
point lead that they never re
linquished.
Nelson had the game high of
25 points while Murphy added
21 points and 11 rebounds to
the totals. For Berkeley, Callo
way led the Bears with 22
points and Johnson netted 16.
Saturday's victory lifts the
Cards' record to 6-1 in the
Northern California Athletic
League and drops the Bears to
a 2-4 mark. Stanford coach Dot
tie McCrea was pleased with
the "patience and poise" the
Cards showed at the contest.
Before the game, Stanford
players and McCrea ran a half
hour clinic to help high school
girls from nine Bay Area teams
with drills and shooting.
The Cards travel to Davis to
morrow where they meet the
Aggies for a non-league match
at 6:30.
