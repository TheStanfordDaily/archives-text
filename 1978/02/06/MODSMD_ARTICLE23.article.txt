# Gymnasts fare well over busy weekend

### Dean Eyre 
Fresno — A full schedule of
gymnastics kept both of Stan
ford's teams busy over the past
weekend. In the first of three
meets held in two days, the
men defeated visiting
Washington State, Chico State
and San lose State.
In Saturday's confronta
tions, the women came in sec
ond to Cal Poly-Pomona, while
in Berkeley the men finished
fourth behind the Japanese
third national team, LSU and
California.
Less than 15 points separated
all four teams in Friday's meet,
the last home meet of the sea
son. Stanford's 193.70, highest
team score yet for Sadao
Hamada's gymnasts this year,
was followed closely by the
192.25 sum for Washington
State. Chico and San Jose had
scores of 189 and 179.05.
The Cardinals won four of
the six events and also had the
first and fourth highest scores

in all around tabulations. Top
individual performers in
cluded Ken Gorman, winner of
the long horse vaulting event
and finishing fourth in floor
exercise, and Shep Kinsman,
who placed fourth in parallel
bars, fifth on high bar and
fourth in all around.
Steve Waichler earned third
in floor exercise, Dan Wessner
took second on rings and Al
Nemcek placed second in vau
lting. Chris Takimoto won the
pommel horse event to remain
undefeated in competition this
season.
Tad Bostick won the floor
exercise and parallel bar
events, placed second on high
bar and third on pommel
horse. His total score of 50.90
was good for first place in the
all-around competition.
Behind the purely objective
scores of the meet, a rather
dramatic contest developed
between Stanford and the
Cougars. "The most exciting

thing was that we were behind
two times and we came back,"
said Hamada. "They (Stan
ford's gymnasts) were aware
that we were only .4 of a point
behind (with only parallel bars
left). I was afraid of them get
ting nervous and I told them
just to do their regular
routines," he said.
Improvement, especially on
the parallel bars, resulted in
the better overall scores and
kept Stanford within striking
range.
"We've been working so
hard and finally things are com
ing together," said Hamada.
"So far we've done really great
— much better than I expected
because I've never had such a
hard working group in my life.
Every week they improve
dramatically," he added.
While obviously much ot the
improvement comes from the
gymnasts themselves, coach
ing can easily make or break a
competition class team.

"The team owes just about
all its success to Sadao. He's
probably the best coach on the
west coast. He took a bunch of
guys who really were walk-ons,
didn't have a lot of talent, like
myself, and turned us into a re
spectable team. Personally, I
would have been nowhere if it
hadn't been for Sadao," said
Gorman.
For the women, the trip to
Fresno had one major surprise
— Pomona. The Stanford
schedule listed Fresno State as
the host of a dual meet, but
there was no mention until
right before the meet that a
third team was included.
"I think I didn'twork quite as
hard this week becausc I
thought we could beat Fresno
(a previous opponent) easily.
We've been working out be
fore and I think everybody just
needed a break and relaxed.
But in reality we really did need
the workout," said Linda Park.
Despite the lack of advance
warning, the Cardinal women
put on performances to be
proud of. Highlights of the
meet included Park's vaulting,
placing third in the event, and
an 8.5 routine on balance beam
by Cindy Sedlund, earning her
second place.
Saundra Muramatsu,
bothered by an old ankle in
jury, didn't compete in vault
ing and had to leave out her
harder tumbling moves. How
ever, she still placed third in
the floor exercise, and won
both the uneven parallel bar

and beam competition.
Dana Padden, taking on the
pressure as top Card all
around competitor because of
Muramatsu's injury, placed
third in the uneven bar event
and won in vaulting. Her best
performances of the day were
in a different event — dedica
tion.
Despite badly injuring her
ankle during her floor exercise
routine, she continued, and
received the second highest
score for Stanford. Later, in
stead of sitting out the beam
competition, she performed
her routine as if nothing had
happened, again scoring well.
The team scores for the meet
were 120.30 for Pomona, 115.35
for Stanford and 105.65 for
Fresno State.
In Saturday's competition at
Berkeley's Harmon Gym, Japan
finished first with 223.35, fol
lowed by LSU at 216.65.
California and Stanford
finished with 210.65 and
185.70.
All around competition was
dominated by the Japanese,
team members Ikutaro
Kawaguchi and Haruyasu
Taguchi taking first and second
and LSU's Ron Galimore
finished third.
Stanford's Chris Takimoto
finished first on pommel horse
with a 9.6 and Gorman placed
third on vaulting scoring 9.35'.
Bostick had an all around total
of 50.0, but did not place.

ing together," said Hamada.
"So far we've done really great
— much better than I expected
because I've never had such a
hard working group in my life.
Every week they improve
dramatically," he added.
While obviously much ot the
improvement comes from the
gymnasts themselves, coach
ing can easily make or break a
competition class team.

"The team owes just about
all its success to Sadao. He's
probably the best coach on the
west coast. He took a bunch of
guys who really were walk-ons,
didn't have a lot of talent, like
myself, and turned us into a re
spectable team. Personally, I
would have been nowhere if it
hadn't been for Sadao," said
Gorman.
For the women, the trip to
Fresno had one major surprise
— Pomona. The Stanford
schedule listed Fresno State as
the host of a dual meet, but
there was no mention until
right before the meet that a
third team was included.
"I think I didn'twork quite as
hard this week becausc I
thought we could beat Fresno
(a previous opponent) easily.
We've been working out be
fore and I think everybody just
needed a break and relaxed.
But in reality we really did need
the workout," said Linda Park.
Despite the lack of advance
warning, the Cardinal women
put on performances to be
proud of. Highlights of the
meet included Park's vaulting,
placing third in the event, and
an 8.5 routine on balance beam
by Cindy Sedlund, earning her
second place.
Saundra Muramatsu,
bothered by an old ankle in
jury, didn't compete in vault
ing and had to leave out her
harder tumbling moves. How
ever, she still placed third in
the floor exercise, and won
both the uneven parallel bar

and beam competition.
Dana Padden, taking on the
pressure as top Card all
around competitor because of
Muramatsu's injury, placed
third in the uneven bar event
and won in vaulting. Her best
performances of the day were
in a different event — dedica
tion.
Despite badly injuring her
ankle during her floor exercise
routine, she continued, and
received the second highest
score for Stanford. Later, in
stead of sitting out the beam
competition, she performed
her routine as if nothing had
happened, again scoring well.
The team scores for the meet
were 120.30 for Pomona, 115.35
for Stanford and 105.65 for
Fresno State.
In Saturday's competition at
Berkeley's Harmon Gym, Japan
finished first with 223.35, fol
lowed by LSU at 216.65.
California and Stanford
finished with 210.65 and
185.70.
All around competition was
dominated by the Japanese,
team members Ikutaro
Kawaguchi and Haruyasu
Taguchi taking first and second
and LSU's Ron Galimore
finished third.
Stanford's Chris Takimoto
finished first on pommel horse
with a 9.6 and Gorman placed

Fresno — A full schedule of
gymnastics kept both of Stan
ford's teams busy over the past
weekend. In the first of three
meets held in two days, the
men defeated visiting
Washington State, Chico State
and San lose State.
In Saturday's confronta
tions, the women came in sec
ond to Cal Poly-Pomona, while
in Berkeley the men finished
fourth behind the Japanese
third national team, LSU and
California.
Less than 15 points separated
all four teams in Friday's meet,
the last home meet of the sea
son. Stanford's 193.70, highest
team score yet for Sadao
Hamada's gymnasts this year,
was followed closely by the
192.25 sum for Washington
State. Chico and San Jose had
scores of 189 and 179.05.
The Cardinals won four of
the six events and also had the
first and fourth highest scores

in all around tabulations. Top
individual performers in
cluded Ken Gorman, winner of
the long horse vaulting event
and finishing fourth in floor
exercise, and Shep Kinsman,
who placed fourth in parallel
bars, fifth on high bar and
fourth in all around.
Steve Waichler earned third
in floor exercise, Dan Wessner
took second on rings and Al
Nemcek placed second in vau
lting. Chris Takimoto won the
pommel horse event to remain
undefeated in competition this
season.
Tad Bostick won the floor
exercise and parallel bar
events, placed second on high
bar and third on pommel
horse. His total score of 50.90
was good for first place in the
all-around competition.
Behind the purely objective
scores of the meet, a rather
dramatic contest developed
between Stanford and the
Cougars. "The most exciting

thing was that we were behind
two times and we came back,"
said Hamada. "They (Stan
ford's gymnasts) were aware
that we were only .4 of a point
behind (with only parallel bars
left). I was afraid of them get
ting nervous and I told them
just to do their regular
routines," he said.
Improvement, especially on
the parallel bars, resulted in
the better overall scores and
kept Stanford within striking
range.
"We've been working so

Fresno — A full schedule of
gymnastics kept both of Stan
ford's teams busy over the past
weekend. In the first of three
meets held in two days, the
men defeated visiting
Washington State, Chico State
and San lose State.
In Saturday's confronta
tions, the women came in sec
ond to Cal Poly-Pomona, while
in Berkeley the men finished
fourth behind the Japanese
third national team, LSU and
California.
Less than 15 points separated
all four teams in Friday's meet,
the last home meet of the sea
son. Stanford's 193.70, highest
team score yet for Sadao
Hamada's gymnasts this year,
was followed closely by the
192.25 sum for Washington
State. Chico and San Jose had
scores of 189 and 179.05.
The Cardinals won four of
the six events and also had the
first and fourth highest scores

in all around tabulations. Top
individual performers in
cluded Ken Gorman, winner of
the long horse vaulting event
and finishing fourth in floor
exercise, and Shep Kinsman,
who placed fourth in parallel
bars, fifth on high bar and
fourth in all around.
Steve Waichler earned third
in floor exercise, Dan Wessner
took second on rings and Al
Nemcek placed second in vau
lting. Chris Takimoto won the
pommel horse event to remain
undefeated in competition this
season.
Tad Bostick won the floor
exercise and parallel bar
events, placed second on high
bar and third on pommel
horse. His total score of 50.90
was good for first place in the
all-around competition.
Behind the purely objective
scores of the meet, a rather
dramatic contest developed
between Stanford and the
Cougars. "The most exciting

thing was that we were behind
two times and we came back,"
said Hamada. "They (Stan
ford's gymnasts) were aware
that we were only .4 of a point
behind (with only parallel bars
left). I was afraid of them get
ting nervous and I told them
just to do their regular
routines," he said.
Improvement, especially on
the parallel bars, resulted in
the better overall scores and
kept Stanford within striking
range.
"We've been working so
hard and finally things are com
ing together," said Hamada.
"So far we've done really great
— much better than I expected
because I've never had such a
hard working group in my life.
Every week they improve
dramatically," he added.
While obviously much ot the
improvement comes from the
gymnasts themselves, coach
ing can easily make or break a
competition class team.

"The team owes just about
all its success to Sadao. He's
probably the best coach on the
west coast. He took a bunch of
guys who really were walk-ons,
didn't have a lot of talent, like
myself, and turned us into a re
spectable team. Personally, I
would have been nowhere if it
hadn't been for Sadao," said
Gorman.
For the women, the trip to
Fresno had one major surprise
— Pomona. The Stanford
schedule listed Fresno State as
the host of a dual meet, but
there was no mention until
right before the meet that a
third team was included.
"I think I didn'twork quite as
hard this week becausc I
thought we could beat Fresno
(a previous opponent) easily.
We've been working out be
fore and I think everybody just
needed a break and relaxed.
But in reality we really did need
the workout," said Linda Park.
Despite the lack of advance
warning, the Cardinal women
put on performances to be
proud of. Highlights of the
meet included Park's vaulting,
placing third in the event, and
an 8.5 routine on balance beam
by Cindy Sedlund, earning her
second place.
Saundra Muramatsu,
bothered by an old ankle in
jury, didn't compete in vault
ing and had to leave out her
harder tumbling moves. How
ever, she still placed third in
the floor exercise, and won
both the uneven parallel bar

and beam competition.
Dana Padden, taking on the
pressure as top Card all
around competitor because of
Muramatsu's injury, placed
third in the uneven bar event
and won in vaulting. Her best
performances of the day were
in a different event — dedica
tion.
Despite badly injuring her
ankle during her floor exercise
routine, she continued, and
received the second highest
score for Stanford. Later, in
stead of sitting out the beam
competition, she performed
her routine as if nothing had
happened, again scoring well.
The team scores for the meet
were 120.30 for Pomona, 115.35
for Stanford and 105.65 for
Fresno State.
