## Report from a rugger hugger 
### 
A S.F. Rugby player's mother
called him before the Stanford
game Saturday and exhorted,
"Kick ass Johnny!" Well the
S.F. I's barely did, 12 to 11 in a
savagely contested game.
An experienced, interna
tional S.F. Rugby team had its
hands full with a young, all fire
and muscle Stanford team.
Stanford's brave challenge fell
short in the last two minutes
when an indiscretion near its
goal led to a S.F. try and con
version.
Stanford scored first with a
penalty kick by Marenzi. S.F.'s
inside center then made a de
vastating burst from 40 yards
out, wrong-footed the defense
and scored a try. The conver
sion was good and S.F. led 6-3.
Near the end of the first half
Shanagher's pop kick was
picked up by Dodd who ran
with a revivalist's fervor then
passed back to Shenagher who
scored the try. The conversion

was missed.
The second half was like a
small war. There was savage
tackling, quick attacks by the
wings and exciting forays out
of defense. A hard tackle by
fullback Duignan saved a try
and the defense smashed back
repeated assaults. Stanford's
final try came from the storm
ing forwards who kicked the
ball to mid field where the
wings, in dazzling celebration,
put Morris into score.
But the victory was denied
the gallant Stanford defense
when S.F. launched an oppor
tunistic counter attack.
For Stanford's ll's johnny's
mother was right. S.F. 34 Stan
ford 6. But the Ill's led by
Donald, Van Cortler and Light
foot won 13 to 12.
