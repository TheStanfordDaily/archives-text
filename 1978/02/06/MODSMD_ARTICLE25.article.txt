The Stanford baseball team

ternoon for their second game
of the 1978 season with USF at
2:30 p.m. at Stanford's Sunken
Diamond.
Fresh off an 8-1 defeat of the
Dons last Wednesday after
noon, theCardswill belooking
for their second pre-season
victory.
"I was surprised by the pitch
ing (in Wednesday's game),"
said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess. "I thought that with the
lack of live action (due to the
rain during the first part of the
quarter) they'd be behind the
hitting, but they all did a great
job."

Pitchers Bruce Fiala, Rick
Hallsted, Gerry korulofske and
Joe LoPresti are scheduled to
see action this afternoon, with
the rest of the lineup remain
ing essentially the same as in
Wednesday's game. Marquess
also plans to soot start some of
the younger players soon while
it's still early in the preseason.
Tuesday, Brian Harrison,
Mark Abbondola and Larry
Kuhn will pitch against Santa
Clara in the first away game of
this year. Harrison, who Mar
quess said, "did an outstand
ing job on Wednesday," struck
out five batters in his three in
nings on the mound against
the Dons and gave up only one
hit.
