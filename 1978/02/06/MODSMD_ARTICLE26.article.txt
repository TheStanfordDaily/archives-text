Students are being billed for ex
cessive amounts of breakage of
chemistry laboratory materials dur
ing class, according to Asst. Chemis
try Prof. James LuValle.
Bills for $5 for the use of laboratory
materials were sent to all students
who took Chemistry 130, "Theory
and Practice of Identification,'' fall
quarter.
According to the chemistry de
partment, students paid a $20 de
posit at the beginning of the quarter,
but the laboratory division still has
more than $10,000 deficit.
The deficit has been caused by the
increases in breakage and lab mate
rials cost, so the bills are being sent
to make up the loss, LuValle added.
At the end of each quarter a lab
material breakage report for each
course is sent to the Student Financ
ing Office, LuValle said. The office
determines the cost of damage and
subtracts the total from the deposits.
In the past students have received
small refunds from the Chemistry

Department, when damage to lab
materials has been minimal.
The Chemistry Department pays for
all chemicals and 25 per cent of the
breakage costs incurred during
washing of the glassware, according
to department spokespeople. The
students pay the remaining 75 per
cent.
Instead of billing individually for
broken materials, the bills and de
posits are pro-rated among students
because the equipment isn't issued
individually, LuValle said. Every stu
dent is charged equally for any loss.
The bills were sent on )an. 30 and
31 and must be paid within 30 days or
an additional $5 fee will be charged,
according to the Student Accounting
Office.
Several students questioned said
they were unaware they could be
charged more, or given a refund after
the course.
Sophomore Shireen Mulla said she
feels she is paying for others' broken
materials, and she has no choice but
to pay.
