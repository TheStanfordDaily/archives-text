Congressmen may face criminal charges
Washington — Special counsel Leon Jaworski said yesterday
that a few congressmen may face criminal charges in the South
Korean influence-buying affair, while as many as two dozen
may be punished or possibly expelled by their colleagues.
Jaworski, a former Watergate prosecutor brought to
Washington to head the House ethics committee's investiga
tion of the alleged influence-buying, reiterated his view that the
probe may result in criminal indictments against some sitting
congressmen.
He said his staff has not turned all of their evidence over to
the Justice Department, which has said it expects few indict
ments against present members of Congress.
In response to a question about how many congressmen
might be vulnerable to charges of breaching ethical standards,
he said, "I would say that certainly you would be able to place
those in the category of let's say two dozen."
Jaworski also said he anticipates that some congressmen will
be reprimanded and perhaps expelled, saying that perjury is
one of the possible charges.
31 senators will vote against Canal treaty
Washington — A new survey shows that 31 U.S. Senators are
either opposed to the Panama Canal treaty or are leaning
against it, only three votes shy of the 34 needed to block
ratification.
A questionnaire sent to all senators shows that 41 favor the
pact and eight are leaning toward ratification. Twenty-four
senators indicated they are opposed to the treaty, while seven
others said they were leaning against it.
That means the fate of the pact may rest with 20 senators who
are not ready to take a public position.
Among them are some of the Senate's most influential and
senior members. Most of them are Democrats, some of whom
chair key committees and key subcommittees and often decide
the fate of legislation.
They include Henry Jackson and Warren Magnuson, both
Washington Democrats; Howard Cannon (D-Nev.); William

Proxmire (D-Wis.); Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.); Thomas Mcln
tyre (D-N.H.); Jennings Randolph (D-W.Va.) and Herman Tal
madge (D-Ga.).
Most treaty foes are believed to have declared themselves
already, and Senate observers suggest that most uncommitted
members are potential backers of the treaty who are not willing
to promise Jimmy Carter their votes without getting something
in return.
Vietnam recalling U.N. Ambassador
Tokyo — Vietnam said yesterday it is recalling United Nations
Ambassador Dinh Ba Thi. The announcement came two days
after Thi, accused by the United States of spying and ordered
out of the country, said he would not leave.
Official Vietnam radio, in a broadcast monitored in Tokyo,
said Hanoi recalled Thi because "the U.S. government is trying
to disturb activities of the Vietnamese ambassador."
In Washington, state department spokesman Charles Shap
iro said of the reported recall, "We welcome it, if it is true. We
have assumed all along that Thi would leave."
Thi was not available for comment yesterday and there was
no immediate indication when he will leave.
He became the first U.N. chief of mission ordered out by the
United States after a grand jury named him an unindicted co
conspirator in a federal spy case involving a U.S. Information
Agency employee and a Vietnamese expatriate.
Women fight Creek Orthodox tradition
Athens, Greece — Feminist leaders will go before parliament
this week to fight a Greek Orthodox Church order that con
tinues a 150-year-old tradition forbidding women from serving
on local church councils.
The Center Party Women's Group has denounced the ruling
as an example of "the worst and most outdated male chauvinist
mentality," since women are tapped only for menial jobs and
not administrative posts.
The issue arose last week when Bishop Eleftherios ruled that
in his diocese there would be one woman on the five-member

council of each church. He said this was logical since 75 per
cent of those who attend worship services in Greece are wo
men. He added that women's opinions would generally im
prove the handling of church affairs.
The bishop's colleagues reacted by pressuring Archbishop
Serapheim to convene a meeting of the Holy Synod, the
church's supreme ruling body. The archbishop, appointed in
1973 by the military government then in power, issued a circular
after the meeting forbidding the appointment of women to
church councils throughout Greece.
Nicaragua paralyzed by dissenters
Managua, Nicaragua — Municipal elections in cities outside
the capital began yesterday with indications that voters by the
thousands were boycotting the voting to push demands for
President Anastasio Somoza's resignation.
Members of the national guard, the country's army, were
braced for more anti-government demonstrations and re
newed attacks by Marxist guerrillas. But no significant incidents
were reported.
The only legal opposition group, the Conservative Party, said
52 of its 132 candidates had withdrawn voluntarily in an anti-
Somoza protest.
Polling stations in two major provincial cities, Leon and
Granada, were virtually deserted three hours after the
scheduled 12 hours of polling opened early Sunday.
Observers consider that the voter turnout, rather than the
results, will indicate what support remains for Somoza, whose
family has ruled since 1933.
The country is virtually paralyzed by a two-week-old, nation
wide anti-government strike by business and labor leaders.
Today's Weather
Rain likely at times through today. Chance of showers tonight
and tomorrow. Little temperature change. Lows both days in
the upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs in the upper 50s to low 60s.
Chance of rain 70 per cent today and 40 per cent tonight.

Congressmen may face criminal charges
Washington — Special counsel Leon Jaworski said yesterday
that a few congressmen may face criminal charges in the South
Korean influence-buying affair, while as many as two dozen
may be punished or possibly expelled by their colleagues.
Jaworski, a former Watergate prosecutor brought to
Washington to head the House ethics committee's investiga
tion of the alleged influence-buying, reiterated his view that the
probe may result in criminal indictments against some sitting
congressmen.
He said his staff has not turned all of their evidence over to
the Justice Department, which has said it expects few indict
ments against present members of Congress.
In response to a question about how many congressmen
might be vulnerable to charges of breaching ethical standards,
he said, "I would say that certainly you would be able to place
those in the category of let's say two dozen."
Jaworski also said he anticipates that some congressmen will
be reprimanded and perhaps expelled, saying that perjury is
one of the possible charges.
31 senators will vote against Canal treaty
Washington — A new survey shows that 31 U.S. Senators are
either opposed to the Panama Canal treaty or are leaning
against it, only three votes shy of the 34 needed to block
ratification.
A questionnaire sent to all senators shows that 41 favor the
pact and eight are leaning toward ratification. Twenty-four
senators indicated they are opposed to the treaty, while seven
others said they were leaning against it.
That means the fate of the pact may rest with 20 senators who
are not ready to take a public position.
Among them are some of the Senate's most influential and
senior members. Most of them are Democrats, some of whom
chair key committees and key subcommittees and often decide
the fate of legislation.
They include Henry Jackson and Warren Magnuson, both
Washington Democrats; Howard Cannon (D-Nev.); William

Proxmire (D-Wis.); Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.); Thomas Mcln
tyre (D-N.H.); Jennings Randolph (D-W.Va.) and Herman Tal
madge (D-Ga.).
Most treaty foes are believed to have declared themselves
already, and Senate observers suggest that most uncommitted
members are potential backers of the treaty who are not willing
to promise Jimmy Carter their votes without getting something
in return.
Vietnam recalling U.N. Ambassador
Tokyo — Vietnam said yesterday it is recalling United Nations
Ambassador Dinh Ba Thi. The announcement came two days
after Thi, accused by the United States of spying and ordered
out of the country, said he would not leave.
Official Vietnam radio, in a broadcast monitored in Tokyo,
said Hanoi recalled Thi because "the U.S. government is trying
to disturb activities of the Vietnamese ambassador."
In Washington, state department spokesman Charles Shap
iro said of the reported recall, "We welcome it, if it is true. We
have assumed all along that Thi would leave."
Thi was not available for comment yesterday and there was
no immediate indication when he will leave.
He became the first U.N. chief of mission ordered out by the
United States after a grand jury named him an unindicted co
conspirator in a federal spy case involving a U.S. Information
Agency employee and a Vietnamese expatriate.
Women fight Creek Orthodox tradition
Athens, Greece — Feminist leaders will go before parliament
this week to fight a Greek Orthodox Church order that con
tinues a 150-year-old tradition forbidding women from serving
on local church councils.
The Center Party Women's Group has denounced the ruling
as an example of "the worst and most outdated male chauvinist
mentality," since women are tapped only for menial jobs and
not administrative posts.
The issue arose last week when Bishop Eleftherios ruled that
in his diocese there would be one woman on the five-member

council of each church. He said this was logical since 75 per
cent of those who attend worship services in Greece are wo
men. He added that women's opinions would generally im
prove the handling of church affairs.
The bishop's colleagues reacted by pressuring Archbishop
Serapheim to convene a meeting of the Holy Synod, the
church's supreme ruling body. The archbishop, appointed in
1973 by the military government then in power, issued a circular
after the meeting forbidding the appointment of women to
church councils throughout Greece.
Nicaragua paralyzed by dissenters
Managua, Nicaragua — Municipal elections in cities outside
the capital began yesterday with indications that voters by the
thousands were boycotting the voting to push demands for
President Anastasio Somoza's resignation.
Members of the national guard, the country's army, were
braced for more anti-government demonstrations and re
newed attacks by Marxist guerrillas. But no significant incidents
were reported.
The only legal opposition group, the Conservative Party, said
52 of its 132 candidates had withdrawn voluntarily in an anti-
Somoza protest.
Polling stations in two major provincial cities, Leon and
Granada, were virtually deserted three hours after the
scheduled 12 hours of polling opened early Sunday.
Observers consider that the voter turnout, rather than the
results, will indicate what support remains for Somoza, whose
family has ruled since 1933.
The country is virtually paralyzed by a two-week-old, nation
wide anti-government strike by business and labor leaders.
