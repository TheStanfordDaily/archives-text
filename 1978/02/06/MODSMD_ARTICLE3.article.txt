# Liberal arts majors approach faltering American job market

### Hardy Iredale 
Job prospects for students holding
liberal arts degrees are not promis
ing, according to Ralph Keller, direr
tor of the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC).
The situation has not been helped
by the unencouraging job prospects
for students with graduate degrees.
"As a result of this," Keller said,
"fewer students are seeking ad
vanced degrees."
He said only about 40 per cent of
last year's graduating class went di
rectly on to graduate or professional
schools.
Keller said "more and more we are
going to need to find jobs for people
who are graduating with bachelor's
degrees."
However, he said, the task is get
ting more difficult because of
changes in the national labor force.
The recently published annual report
of the CPPC states that as a result of
inflation more people are entering
the job market, including many who
haven't sought employment before.
"Large numbers of people hold
more than one job," Keller said. "Re
tired people are returning to full
time employment, and there is an
appreciable increase in the number

of two-member families where both
are employed."
Keller also noted that the number
of bachelor's degrees given each
year has doubled in the past 10 years,
to a current one million annually.
"Yet," he said, "there are only 10 to
15 per cent more jobs available."
With this situation in view, the
CPPC is setting up pilot programs
with companies, in which liberal arts
graduates are given on-the-job train
ing in management.
Keller said pilot programs exist at
IBM and Price-Waterhouse.
"They're willing to experiment
with hiring liberal arts graduates to
work in such areas as marketing, per
sonnel management and program
ming," he said.
"The existing pattern," Keller said,
"is to hire people with business ad
ministration degrees, either at the
bachelor's or master's level."
The CPPC program, he said, will try
to establish a trend toward business
hiring at the bachelor's degree level.
Similar programs are available at
other universities across the country,
usually under the label of "Co-op."
The Stanford program, Keller said,
is "different than a Co-op program
because it is worked on a carefully

controlled, carefully tailored plan."
"Representatives are coming in
and sitting down and actually talking
to students," he said.
In addition, the CPPC maintains
continual contact with companies
with which it has programs. Keller
said that IBM has reported that the
current arrangement, in which it has
taken on graduates from last quarter,
is working very well.
Questioned about future pros
pects for liberal arts graduates, Keller
said, "I am optimistic, but up until
now we really haven't been doing
too well in the liberal arts area."
However, placement of Stanford
graduates as a whole has improved
every year during the past decade
except for 1974-75. "This trend has
continued even though placement of
college graduates generally has not
been encouraging during most of the
19705," he said.
Prospects for engineering and sci
ence graduates are, in contrast, quite
good, with those coming from highly
regarded schools having "an addi
tional edge," he added.
Starting salaries for Stanford en
gineers continue to increase, and in
every field exceed the national aver
age.

to a current one million annually.
"Yet," he said, "there are only 10 to
15 per cent more jobs available."
With this situation in view, the
CPPC is setting up pilot programs
with companies, in which liberal arts
graduates are given on-the-job train
ing in management.
Keller said pilot programs exist at
IBM and Price-Waterhouse.
"They're willing to experiment
with hiring liberal arts graduates to
work in such areas as marketing, per
sonnel management and program
ming," he said.
"The existing pattern," Keller said,
"is to hire people with business ad
ministration degrees, either at the
bachelor's or master's level."
The CPPC program, he said, will try
to establish a trend toward business
hiring at the bachelor's degree level.
Similar programs are available at
other universities across the country,
usually under the label of "Co-op."
The Stanford program, Keller said,
is "different than a Co-op program
because it is worked on a carefully

controlled, carefully tailored plan."
"Representatives are coming in
and sitting down and actually talking
to students," he said.
In addition, the CPPC maintains
continual contact with companies
with which it has programs. Keller
said that IBM has reported that the
current arrangement, in which it has
taken on graduates from last quarter,
is working very well.
Questioned about future pros
pects for liberal arts graduates, Keller
said, "I am optimistic, but up until
now we really haven't been doing
too well in the liberal arts area."
However, placement of Stanford
graduates as a whole has improved
every year during the past decade
except for 1974-75. "This trend has
continued even though placement of
college graduates generally has not
been encouraging during most of the
19705," he said.
Prospects for engineering and sci
ence graduates are, in contrast, quite
good, with those coming from highly
regarded schools having "an addi
tional edge," he added.
Starting salaries for Stanford en
gineers continue to increase, and in
every field exceed the national aver
age.
Job prospects for students holding
liberal arts degrees are not promis
ing, according to Ralph Keller, direr
tor of the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC).
The situation has not been helped
by the unencouraging job prospects
for students with graduate degrees.
"As a result of this," Keller said,
"fewer students are seeking ad
vanced degrees."
He said only about 40 per cent of
last year's graduating class went di
rectly on to graduate or professional
schools.
Keller said "more and more we are
going to need to find jobs for people
who are graduating with bachelor's
degrees."
However, he said, the task is get
ting more difficult because of
changes in the national labor force.
The recently published annual report
of the CPPC states that as a result of
inflation more people are entering
the job market, including many who
haven't sought employment before.
"Large numbers of people hold
more than one job," Keller said. "Re
tired people are returning to full
time employment, and there is an
appreciable increase in the number

of two-member families where both
are employed."
Keller also noted that the number
of bachelor's degrees given each
year has doubled in the past 10 years,
to a current one million annually.
"Yet," he said, "there are only 10 to
15 per cent more jobs available."
