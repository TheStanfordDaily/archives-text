# Ex-employee Petersen gets jail sentence
## 
### Joel Dickholtz 
Former Stanford employee Phillip
Petersen was sentenced Friday to
one year in the Santa Clara County
jail. Petersen was sentenced for em
bezzling more than $62,000 from the
University last spring.
Petersen, former director of the
language laboratory in Meyer Library
and lecturer in the Spanish and Por
tuguese Department, will begin serv
ing his sentence Feb. 24.
Superior Court Judge William Fer
nandez also placed Petersen on five
years probation, and suspended his
state prison sentence.
Fernandez directed Petersen to
repay Stanford's bonding agent,
Fidelity and Deposit Company of Bal
timore, $150 per month until the sum
of $57,000 is reached. This is the
amount the bonding company reim
bursed the University on its $5000
deductible policy.
Petersen was fired from the Uni
versity March 21, following his March
17 arrest.
Petersen allegedly collected re
ceipts from the trash bin of a San
Mateo camera store and turned them
in as records of money spent on Uni
versity supplies. He was reimbursed
by the University from the language
laboratory's petty cash fund.
Petersen originally pleaded "no
contest," changed to a plea of inno
cent and then back to a plea of "no
contest" before he was finally sen
tenced.
Petersen was contacted by the
Daily, but refused to comment.
