# Nurses vote against unions
## 
### Jon Hornsby 
Voting by licensed vocational
nurses (LVNs) ended Saturday at
University Medical Center with an 80
per cent decision against union rep
resentation.
In an election reduced in size by
thevoting withdrawal of United Stan

ford Employees (USE), 20 out of 35
nurses noted to select neither the
California Licensed Vocational
Nurses Association (CLVNA) nor USE
as bargaining agents. Three nurses
voted for CLVNA and two voted for
USE.
Hospital administrators said they
were pleased with the outcome.
"I won't say that we're perfect,"
said Ron Twomey, medical center
personnel director, "but I think the
results were a reflection that
employees think we are doing as well
as can be reasonably expected and
they don't think they could do any
better with a union."
USE Secretary Jim Berk said he was
not too surprised by the results. He
said that USE organizers had not
concentrated their campaign on the
LVNs prior to Monday, because the
LVNs represented only 33 out of 800
possible voters.
Before USE withdrew Tuesday, the
elections had been scheduled to in
volve 765 service, technical, patient
care employees and pharmacists.
They would have voted to select USE
as their exclusive bargaining agent,
or for no union at ail.
Berk cited lack of proper cam
paigning time as a major reason for
USE withdrawal.
He said they weren't prepared to
run a two-week campaign. They
wanted a longer time to inform all
voters of the issues.
"We could have gotten more votes
if we'd had more time," Berk said.
In the case of the 765 other
employees who would have voted
for or against USE, Berk said he
wasn't sure of a large majority vote.
"We don't want a divided vote. By
postponing the election six months,

we can win bigger."
Twomey disagreed. "I think USE
recognized they didn't have a
chance. Rather than face that tre
mendous defeat, they withdrew
from the election."
Berk said there were those in the
union who felt they would have been
in "hot water" if they had won the
LVN support. These people felt that
the LVNs would be too small a unit
to successfully bargain for in negotia
tions.
"If they went on strike, they would
probably hardly be missed," Berk
said.
He said five years ago there were
125 LVNs and their number is de
creasing.
"They're being replaced at the top
end by registered nurses, and at the
bottom by nursing assistants."
He speculated that their numbers
would dwindle more in the future.
Gary Mecklenburg, deputy direc
tor of the University Hospital and
Clinic, and Twomey denied this pos
sibility. Both said there were no plans
to phase out LVNs.
"My own opinion," said Twomey,
"is that, if anything, we will be ex
panding their role."
USE must wait six months before
they can petition for an election in
volving the 765 other employees.
USE will start organizing and cam
paigning next week to "buiid a net
work of informed union suppor
ters," Berk said.
The National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) granted USE's request
to withdraw although a decision
early in January by NLRB Regional Di
rector Michael Taylor instructed the
hospital to proceed with the elec
tions.

better with a union."
USE Secretary Jim Berk said he was
not too surprised by the results. He
said that USE organizers had not
concentrated their campaign on the
LVNs prior to Monday, because the
LVNs represented only 33 out of 800
possible voters.
Before USE withdrew Tuesday, the
elections had been scheduled to in
volve 765 service, technical, patient
care employees and pharmacists.
They would have voted to select USE
as their exclusive bargaining agent,
or for no union at ail.
Berk cited lack of proper cam
paigning time as a major reason for
USE withdrawal.
He said they weren't prepared to
run a two-week campaign. They
wanted a longer time to inform all
voters of the issues.
"We could have gotten more votes
if we'd had more time," Berk said.
In the case of the 765 other
employees who would have voted
for or against USE, Berk said he
wasn't sure of a large majority vote.
"We don't want a divided vote. By
postponing the election six months,

we can win bigger."
Twomey disagreed. "I think USE
recognized they didn't have a
chance. Rather than face that tre
mendous defeat, they withdrew
from the election."
Berk said there were those in the
union who felt they would have been
in "hot water" if they had won the
LVN support. These people felt that
the LVNs would be too small a unit
to successfully bargain for in negotia
tions.
"If they went on strike, they would
probably hardly be missed," Berk
said.
He said five years ago there were
125 LVNs and their number is de
creasing.
"They're being replaced at the top
end by registered nurses, and at the
bottom by nursing assistants."
He speculated that their numbers
would dwindle more in the future.
Gary Mecklenburg, deputy direc
tor of the University Hospital and
Clinic, and Twomey denied this pos
sibility. Both said there were no plans
to phase out LVNs.
"My own opinion," said Twomey,
"is that, if anything, we will be ex
panding their role."
USE must wait six months before
they can petition for an election in
volving the 765 other employees.
USE will start organizing and cam
paigning next week to "buiid a net
work of informed union suppor
ters," Berk said.
The National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) granted USE's request
to withdraw although a decision
early in January by NLRB Regional Di
rector Michael Taylor instructed the
hospital to proceed with the elec
tions.
Voting by licensed vocational
nurses (LVNs) ended Saturday at
University Medical Center with an 80
per cent decision against union rep
resentation.
In an election reduced in size by
thevoting withdrawal of United Stan

ford Employees (USE), 20 out of 35
nurses noted to select neither the
California Licensed Vocational
Nurses Association (CLVNA) nor USE
as bargaining agents. Three nurses
voted for CLVNA and two voted for
USE.
Hospital administrators said they
were pleased with the outcome.
"I won't say that we're perfect,"
said Ron Twomey, medical center
personnel director, "but I think the
results were a reflection that
employees think we are doing as well
as can be reasonably expected and
they don't think they could do any
better with a union."
