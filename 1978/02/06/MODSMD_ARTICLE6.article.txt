# Peace Corps and VISTA representatives recruit students

### Robin Millington 
Peace Corps and VISTA representatives will be on
campus this week in an effort to recruit 3000 people
for the summer.
Under the Carter administration, more funds are
being made available to the Peace Corps, according
to representative Linda Borst.
The program is expanding to another 1000 mem
bers in addition to the more than 10,000 volunteers
now serving in 65 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin
America, Borst said.
"We are in these countries because they've asked
us to be there." The Peace Corps is purely for the aid
of countries that desire it, Borst added.
The Peace Corps offers services including medical
care, health care education, small business advising
and teaching agricultural techniques.
VISTA, which has 1400 volunteers in all 50 states, is
a one-year volunteer program designed to help in
areas such as community organization, housing,
senior citizen problems, legal aid services and adult
education.
Both the Peace Corps and VISTA are looking for
volunteers with a college degree and experience in
their area of interest. In addition, VISTA encourages
people who have volunteered for community ser
vice. A college degree is not necessary if the volun
teer work has been extensive enough, said VISTA
representative Nona Bailey.
Borst, who worked in Belize (former British Hon
duras) as a math teacher, said "what I really liked
about the Peace Corps is that I went over there as me,

an individual, not a representative of the United
States government."
She said she felt that working to help other indi
viduals was the most rewarding aspect of her experi
ence. She added "one of the nicest things about
being with the Peace Corps is the opportunity to learn
another language."
Peace Corps volunteers are given a place to live,
excellent medical care and about $120 a month which
is more than sufficient because the standards of living
are much lower in most Peace Corps countries, she
added.
In addition, $125 a month is put away for adjust
ment pay after the volunteer returns to the states, and
a volunteer gets a month vacation each year. Borst
said another advantage "is that you get to travel."
Bailey, who worked as a VISTA volunteer in
Phoenix teaching English and working with women
prison inmates, said her experience was "rewarding
but frustrating."
"I would like to stress the importance of living in
the community you work in." The people in the
community accepted her only after they learned that
she was experiencing the same living frustrations
they were, she said.
VISTA gives a maximum living allowance of $275 a
month. "Living on $275 a month is different for a
non-student than it is for a student," Bailey said.
VISTA only sets aside $50 a month for the volun
teers after they leave, but, with the change in ad
ministration, that amount may increase, Bailey ad
ded.

"I would like to stress the importance of living in
the community you work in." The people in the
community accepted her only after they learned that
she was experiencing the same living frustrations
they were, she said.
VISTA gives a maximum living allowance of $275 a
month. "Living on $275 a month is different for a
non-student than it is for a student," Bailey said.
VISTA only sets aside $50 a month for the volun
teers after they leave, but, with the change in ad
ministration, that amount may increase, Bailey ad
ded.

representative Linda Borst are on campus this week to recruit students for their volunteer programs.
Peace Corps and VISTA representatives will be on
campus this week in an effort to recruit 3000 people
for the summer.
Under the Carter administration, more funds are
being made available to the Peace Corps, according
to representative Linda Borst.
The program is expanding to another 1000 mem
bers in addition to the more than 10,000 volunteers
now serving in 65 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin
America, Borst said.
"We are in these countries because they've asked
us to be there." The Peace Corps is purely for the aid
of countries that desire it, Borst added.
The Peace Corps offers services including medical
care, health care education, small business advising
and teaching agricultural techniques.
VISTA, which has 1400 volunteers in all 50 states, is
a one-year volunteer program designed to help in
areas such as community organization, housing,
senior citizen problems, legal aid services and adult
education.
Both the Peace Corps and VISTA are looking for
volunteers with a college degree and experience in
their area of interest. In addition, VISTA encourages
people who have volunteered for community ser
vice. A college degree is not necessary if the volun
teer work has been extensive enough, said VISTA
representative Nona Bailey.
Borst, who worked in Belize (former British Hon
duras) as a math teacher, said "what I really liked
about the Peace Corps is that I went over there as me,

an individual, not a representative of the United
States government."
She said she felt that working to help other indi
viduals was the most rewarding aspect of her experi
ence. She added "one of the nicest things about
being with the Peace Corps is the opportunity to learn
another language."
Peace Corps volunteers are given a place to live,
excellent medical care and about $120 a month which
is more than sufficient because the standards of living
are much lower in most Peace Corps countries, she
added.
In addition, $125 a month is put away for adjust
ment pay after the volunteer returns to the states, and
a volunteer gets a month vacation each year. Borst
said another advantage "is that you get to travel."
Bailey, who worked as a VISTA volunteer in
Phoenix teaching English and working with women
prison inmates, said her experience was "rewarding
but frustrating."
"I would like to stress the importance of living in
the community you work in." The people in the
community accepted her only after they learned that
she was experiencing the same living frustrations
they were, she said.
VISTA gives a maximum living allowance of $275 a
