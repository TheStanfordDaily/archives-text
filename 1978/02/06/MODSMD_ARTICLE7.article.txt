; Herewith installment
number two in the Daily's new
"whip me, beat me" brand of
reader relations. The topic
this morning . . . no, not
brains on page one . . . but:
how we find the news.
Now, you may think we
have some sort of inside line
intoall the nooksand crannies
of University life and that we
sooner or later get all the im
portant stuff onto page one.
But if you think that, you're
probably not a member of
Theta Chi. Or a student at an
overseas campus. Or an
employee at the Med Center.
Because those people
probably know that in the past
few weeks, this paper has mis
sed some newsworthy stories
involving them.
Granted, the most accurate
definition of what is newswor
thy is "that which actually ap
pears in print." But I think you
would have been interested in
knowing that the overseas
campus charter flight, with
many of your friends aboard,
had some nervous moments
just before the landing in
Amsterdam. In fact, they
landed on a runway lined with
emergency vehicles.
But we missed the story.
; No one at the Daily is par

ticularly at fault for our mis
sing stories: no one is. But I
think you should know just
where we do get the news,
and why your particular in
terest gets overlooked some
times.
The news department here
has several chief sources. The
University's News and Publi
cations Service gives us much
of our administration/ trus
tees/ professors/ guest speak
ers information. The Med
Center has a similar outlet for
its affairs.
Connections with the ASSU
Senate and COP provide sev
eral stories each week, as do
sporadic ties with other cam
pus groups.
And of course the news
editors wrack their brains
constantly in pursuit of a new
angle or a fresh subject.
But while we're at the office
working with this material, we
can't be out on campus,
searching out injustice with
Clark Kent's X-ray vision. We
have to rely on students, staff,
faculty and the community to
flesh out our coverage.
For example, the recent
bomb threat in Meyer Library:
we ran a photo and caption
the next day. How did we
know to send a photo

grapher? We didn't hear it
over the police radio, we
didn't get a press release —
we received a call from some
one upset because the police
wouldn't let them into the lib
rary to study. If we'd never
gotten the call, the photo
would most likely never have
seen print.
The point of this rambling
tirade: if you know/ hear/ sus
pect that something "news
worthy" is happening some
where, give us a call. Sure,
maybe we won't use it. But
maybe we can get to the bot
tom of something that's been
bugging you for a long time.
Perhaps we can improve our
ability to inform "the public."
I've been telling the staff
repeatedly that there's a
wealth of information out
there we're missing; I hope
you prove me right.

faculty and the community to
flesh out our coverage.
For example, the recent
bomb threat in Meyer Library:
we ran a photo and caption
the next day. How did we
know to send a photo

grapher? We didn't hear it
over the police radio, we
didn't get a press release —
we received a call from some
one upset because the police
wouldn't let them into the lib
rary to study. If we'd never
gotten the call, the photo
would most likely never have
seen print.
The point of this rambling
tirade: if you know/ hear/ sus
pect that something "news
worthy" is happening some
where, give us a call. Sure,
maybe we won't use it. But
maybe we can get to the bot
tom of something that's been
bugging you for a long time.
Perhaps we can improve our
ability to inform "the public."
I've been telling the staff
repeatedly that there's a
wealth of information out
there we're missing; I hope
you prove me right.

; Herewith installment
number two in the Daily's new
"whip me, beat me" brand of
reader relations. The topic
this morning . . . no, not
brains on page one . . . but:
how we find the news.
Now, you may think we
have some sort of inside line
intoall the nooksand crannies
of University life and that we
sooner or later get all the im
portant stuff onto page one.
But if you think that, you're
probably not a member of
Theta Chi. Or a student at an
overseas campus. Or an
employee at the Med Center.
Because those people
probably know that in the past
few weeks, this paper has mis
sed some newsworthy stories
involving them.
Granted, the most accurate
definition of what is newswor
thy is "that which actually ap
pears in print." But I think you
would have been interested in
knowing that the overseas
campus charter flight, with
many of your friends aboard,
had some nervous moments
just before the landing in
Amsterdam. In fact, they
landed on a runway lined with
emergency vehicles.
But we missed the story.
; No one at the Daily is par

ticularly at fault for our mis
sing stories: no one is. But I
think you should know just
where we do get the news,
and why your particular in
terest gets overlooked some
times.
The news department here
has several chief sources. The
University's News and Publi
cations Service gives us much
of our administration/ trus
tees/ professors/ guest speak
ers information. The Med
Center has a similar outlet for
its affairs.
Connections with the ASSU
Senate and COP provide sev
eral stories each week, as do
sporadic ties with other cam
pus groups.
And of course the news
editors wrack their brains
constantly in pursuit of a new
angle or a fresh subject.
But while we're at the office
working with this material, we
can't be out on campus,
searching out injustice with
Clark Kent's X-ray vision. We
have to rely on students, staff,
faculty and the community to
flesh out our coverage.
