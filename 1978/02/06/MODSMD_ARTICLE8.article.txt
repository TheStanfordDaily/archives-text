# Yell leaders try

Now that the football season and
half the basketball season have pas
sed, I feel that some observations
and suggestions can be made regard
ing the Stanford yell leaders.
Crowd reaction to date has
seemed mixed. There have been a
few examples of great fan en
thusiasm, most notably for the Stan
ford speH out. Mostly, though, or
ganized cheering has been moderate
to poor. I've encountered few com
pletely negative reactions. Overall, I
believe reaction has been positive
enough to merit the reappearance of
yell leaders next season.
In this light, I make the following
observations:
— The yell leaders have shown that
they can be creative, i.e. the forming
of the letters in the spell out.
— The crowd has reacted favorably
to creativity, e.g. the spell out.
— The spell out was practically the
only creative cheer the yell leaders
came up with all year.
—The spell out seemed to be the
only cheer of any kind the yell lead
ers led all year.
—More importantly, I know the
yell leaders have done other cheers.
However, they have either attemp
ted to do so while sitting, backs to
the crowd, as at last week's Cal bas
ketball game, or standing in front of
20,000 people without making effec
tive use of microphones or
megaphones. Consequently, fans
have either been ignorant of the fact
that a cheer was in progress, or been
unable to hear what the yell leaders
were saying.
While making plans for next year, I
urtje the new yell leaders to consider

the following suggestions:
—Veil leaders lead cheers. That
means they get up and face the
crowd. They should stand out in the
open where the fans can see and
hear them.
—For football games they should
use microphones and megaphones.
Megaphones and loud voices should
be used at the basketball games.
—Cheers can be creative, but not
overdone. A good mix of the tradi
tional and the original will probably
get the best response. People won't
react as favorably if cheers are too
complex or corny.
—The yell leaders selected should
be representative of the student
sports audience, and be leaders off
the field as well as on.
—Make use of the Dollies. While
all cheers should be planned and
coordinated by the yell leaders, tak
ing advantage of the Dollies' estab
lished popularity and ability to attract
attention can only help. (The Dollies
should continue to concentrate on
their traditional roles. I refer here to
occasional use.)
—A strickly personal suggestion
would be to abandon the cute cos
tumes. I was embarrassed to see our
duck-tailed leaders on national TV
over the holidays.
While this is not an exhaustive Ibt
of suggestions, I feel it covers the
most basic points. I've made these
suggestions not because this year's
group has done a bad job, indeed
they are to be congratulated for help
ing to reestablish a valuable aspect of
Stanford sports.
