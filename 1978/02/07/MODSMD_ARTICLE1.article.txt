# CIA changes to bolster public trust, Turner says
## 
### Randy Keith 
CIA Director Adm. Stansfield
Turner called for a "modicum of con
fidence" in the American intelli
gence community at a speech inter
rupted several times by a hostile au
dience here last night.
Turner also confirmed that the
agency maintains loose ties to the
government intelligence agencies in
South Africa and Iran.
Citing criticism during the last
three years arising out of past intelli
gence agency abuses, Turner said
"we are beginning to turn the corner
on that criticism and the country is
beginning to take a very healthy and
constructive approach to intelli
gence."
Speaking to an overflow crowd in
Kresge Auditorium, Turner said four
changes have occurred at the CIA
which should increase public confi
dence in the agency.
Turner saidtheClA has changed its
focus from military intelligence
about the Soviet Union alone to
"what's going on in the 150-some
countries in the world."
He also said that the agency no

longer collects just military informa
tion but has begun to gather more
economic and political data from
other countries.
Terming the agency's attitude to
ward covert political operations
quite different today from its attitude
when the CIA was established in
1947, Turner said covert operations
are used "more judiciously than in
the past."
Turner said that there are several
operations underway today but
downplayed them, saying they are
"not that exciting."
The CIA has also begun to operate
with more openness, Turner said,
but he criticized recent disclosures
of CIA operations by former CIA
employee Frank Schnepp.
Schnepp recently wrote a book de
tailing the ClA's activities during the
1975 fall of Saigon and he published it
without receiving CIA clearance.
Clearance is required of any past or
present agency employee before
publication.
"There is a lack of respect for clas
sified information in our country to
day," Turner said.

He said the agency is trying to "re
duce the amount of classified infor
mation to a minimum," and added
the agency is releasing an average of
two unclassified reports per week to
the public.
The agency has also seen a "re
volution" in the way it collects intel
ligence data. Turner added those
methods include using technical sys
tems that "boggle one's imagina
tion."
Turner said that a variety of checks
have been set up in the last few years
to watch overtheClA. "Avery impor
tant change in the U.S. intelligence
community is the process of over
sight.
"We must keep some secrets and
therefore we cannot have full public
oversight in the U.S., but we have a
surrogate oversight process."
He said this process includes the
president, vice president, National
Security Council, Intelligence Over
sight Board and congressional com
mittees.
"I assure you that we report much
more rigorously and much more

forthrightly today than ever before in
our activities to these surrogate
oversight bodies," he said.
Turner warned that the danger of
this process was that the CIA might
end up conducting "intelligence by
timidity" if the close scrutiny re
duced the desires of the agency to
take risks.
Following his 45-minute speech,
Turner was bombarded with ques
tions while protesters walked
through the auditorium.
A brief guerrilla theater was staged
in which one questioner was es
corted out of the auditorium by a
group of protesters carrying large
"I'm a CIA agent" signs.
Turner answered questions on CIA
relations with government intelli
gence agencies in South Africa and
Iran.
"We will follow the dictates of the
(policies of the) United States of
America, as long as the country main
tains relations with those countries,

we will maintain intelligence liaisons
with those countries," Turner said.
"We will not in any way do things
to assist them in their internal sec
urity measures in their country or in
any way make agreements with them
to do intelligence work inside our
country.
"We merely maintain contact with
those intelligence services about
what happens in third areas of the
world," he added.
Turner also said that the agency is
undergoing a period of "rebuilding
morale" following the decision to
fire 820 of the agency's covert service
employees.
So far, 212 of the employees have
been fired, creating widespread dis
satisfaction with Turner inside the
agency.
Turner acknowledged that several
covert operations are being con
ducted but said they had been
cleared through the National Sec
urity Council, the president and
congressional committees.

satisfaction with Turner inside the
agency.
Turner acknowledged that several
covert operations are being con
ducted but said they had been
cleared through the National Sec
urity Council, the president and
congressional committees.
CIA Director Adm. Stansfield
Turner called for a "modicum of con
fidence" in the American intelli
gence community at a speech inter
rupted several times by a hostile au
dience here last night.
Turner also confirmed that the
agency maintains loose ties to the
government intelligence agencies in
South Africa and Iran.
Citing criticism during the last
three years arising out of past intelli
gence agency abuses, Turner said
"we are beginning to turn the corner
on that criticism and the country is
beginning to take a very healthy and
constructive approach to intelli
gence."
Speaking to an overflow crowd in
Kresge Auditorium, Turner said four
changes have occurred at the CIA
which should increase public confi
dence in the agency.
Turner saidtheClA has changed its
focus from military intelligence
about the Soviet Union alone to
"what's going on in the 150-some
countries in the world."
He also said that the agency no

longer collects just military informa
tion but has begun to gather more
economic and political data from
other countries.
Terming the agency's attitude to
ward covert political operations
quite different today from its attitude
when the CIA was established in
1947, Turner said covert operations
are used "more judiciously than in
the past."
Turner said that there are several
operations underway today but
downplayed them, saying they are
"not that exciting."
The CIA has also begun to operate
with more openness, Turner said,
but he criticized recent disclosures
of CIA operations by former CIA
employee Frank Schnepp.
Schnepp recently wrote a book de
tailing the ClA's activities during the
1975 fall of Saigon and he published it
without receiving CIA clearance.
Clearance is required of any past or
present agency employee before
publication.
"There is a lack of respect for clas
sified information in our country to
day," Turner said.

He said the agency is trying to "re
duce the amount of classified infor
mation to a minimum," and added
the agency is releasing an average of
two unclassified reports per week to
the public.
The agency has also seen a "re
volution" in the way it collects intel
ligence data. Turner added those
methods include using technical sys
tems that "boggle one's imagina
tion."
Turner said that a variety of checks
have been set up in the last few years
to watch overtheClA. "Avery impor
tant change in the U.S. intelligence
community is the process of over
sight.
"We must keep some secrets and
therefore we cannot have full public
oversight in the U.S., but we have a
surrogate oversight process."
He said this process includes the
president, vice president, National
Security Council, Intelligence Over
sight Board and congressional com
mittees.
"I assure you that we report much
more rigorously and much more

forthrightly today than ever before in
our activities to these surrogate
oversight bodies," he said.
Turner warned that the danger of
this process was that the CIA might
end up conducting "intelligence by
timidity" if the close scrutiny re
duced the desires of the agency to
take risks.
Following his 45-minute speech,
Turner was bombarded with ques
tions while protesters walked
through the auditorium.
A brief guerrilla theater was staged
in which one questioner was es
corted out of the auditorium by a
group of protesters carrying large
"I'm a CIA agent" signs.
Turner answered questions on CIA
relations with government intelli
gence agencies in South Africa and
Iran.
"We will follow the dictates of the
(policies of the) United States of
America, as long as the country main
tains relations with those countries,

we will maintain intelligence liaisons
with those countries," Turner said.
"We will not in any way do things
to assist them in their internal sec
urity measures in their country or in
any way make agreements with them
to do intelligence work inside our
country.
"We merely maintain contact with
those intelligence services about
what happens in third areas of the
world," he added.
Turner also said that the agency is
undergoing a period of "rebuilding
morale" following the decision to
fire 820 of the agency's covert service
employees.
So far, 212 of the employees have
been fired, creating widespread dis
satisfaction with Turner inside the
agency.
