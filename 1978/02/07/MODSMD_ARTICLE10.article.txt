Questionnaires ineffective
In his "Open Letter to the Faculty"
(Daily, Feb. 1) Tom Faletti defends
the present student evaluation ques
tionnaires and states that when sub
jected to poor teaching, "We have
nowhere to go, no recourse. . .
Not true. When students feel they
are subjected to poor teaching they
should not wait until the quarter is
over to anonymously fill out a ques
tionnaire. They should go directly to
the instructor and talk about the
course and the problems they are
having. If there is one thing students
should learn, it is to speak out di
rectly to the people and issues they
are critical of. This is a crucial prep
aration for life in the "real world" if
you will.
Faletti asks if faculty "recall what it
was like to be on the other end of a
bureaucracy that didn't seem to
care? ' We do because there are
times when some of us feel we are.
Try and get a phone call returned or a
letter answered, or a decision on a
proposal from several key adminis
trators.
Professor Robert Cohn's view of
the impact of teaching on a few is
said by Faletti to be in an "elitist
tone" that "most students would
find out of place." !t is time students
here faced up to the fact that by the
very nature of the selection process
and the definition of the word (the
carefully chosen, the best), they and
the faculty are the elitist.
I find the student evaluation forms
of little help in trying to improve a

course because with rare exceptions
they are done in haste and are super
ficial. In terms of educating our stu
dents to more effectively involve
themselves in the critical process,
anonymous computer analyzed
questionnaires are counter
productive. I don't buy the argument
that faculty here are inaccessible. If
anything, it is the students who are
inaccessible to the faculty; too many
don't show up for meetings of de
partmental majors, or check with ad
visers before registration, or take ad
vantage of office hours or offers to
meet after class and'for dinners in the
dorms.

Not representative
In bypassing the legal authority of
the ASSU to appoint students to the
CIR, President Richard Lyman is blat
antly violating basic student rights to
self-representation.
We believe that the ASSU is the
sole representative of the student
body by popular vote and thus, the
only legitimate authority to appoint
students to the CIR.
Under these circumstances, stu
dents that participate in the CIR
should be made aware that they do
not have the support of the stu
dent community and that the views
they express are solely their own.
