Childbirth in America is a complex
event. With the help of medical
technology, the modern woman has
been freed from much of birth's dis
comfort and uncertainty. She has her

baby not at home but in a big, effi
cient hospital. Drugs relieve her of
the pain of labor, and amniocentesis
or ultrasound scans have assured her
that her baby is well. Any further an
xieties may be put to rest by the fetal
heart monitor, a frequent compan
ion in the labor room. If need be,
doctors can even attach electrodes to
the baby's scalp in utero to avoid po
tential mishaps.
An impressive state of affairs? Pos
sibly. Childbirth in America is cer
tainly "easier" and more convenient
than ever before, but claims that it is
safer are simply not substantiated. It
is an alarming fact that, though 90
percent of our births take place in a
hospital, this country has one of the
worst infant mortality rates in the
western world (we rank 15th accord
ing to the World Health Organiza
tion).
When Dr. Leßoy Heinrichs says,
therefore, that the health of the fetus
is best assured by "someone prac
ticed in medical surveillance," and
that "technology is required to rec
ognize the baby in trouble," it is
worth taking a second look.
As part of his argument against lay
midwifery, Heinrichs said, "Ameri
can women have always demanded
anesthesia and midwives can't apply
it." Perhaps that is a good thing. A
1973 study showed that babies whose
mothers had received anesthesia in
labor were born drugged and depre
ssed. Some of them even had trouble
sucking. While it is true that anesthe
tic drugs diminish pain, very little is
known about their other effects, par
ticularly on the fetus.
Heinrichs also complains that
"electronic monitoring is unavaila
ble to lay midwives." It is also unin
telligible to many doctors. Fetal heart
monitors have become standard
hardware in many hospitals, but doc
tors often do not know how to inter
pret the electronic information they
provide. Dr. John Bunker of Stanford
Medical Center has even said that
"fetal monitoring has doubled the
rate of Caesarean sections because
nobody knows what the blips
mean." If doctors see a blip which
looks unusual, they decide to deliver
surgically, "just in case."
There have been far too few studies
on the effects of technological inter
ference in childbirth to say, confi
dently, that it is a good thing. In many
cases, such intervention may be
necessary and desirable for the

health of the mother and child.
When the risks of interference are
balanced against the dangers of not
treating a difficult pregnancy, they
may seem inconsequential. But
when unnecessary treatment and
technology are applied to a normal
childbirth, the risks may actually in
crease.
What is unnecessary treatment?
That depends largely on the pre
gnancy and personalities involved;
but it is certain that on the merry-go
round of hospital routines and medi
cal fixation with new wonder toys
and weapons, many women are
given far more doctoring than they
actually need.
Statistically, only four percent of
all births require emergency inter
vention. If a woman with a demon
strably healthy pregnancy decides
that she would rather forego the trip
to the hospital, the medication, the
strange hands, the abrupt transfer in
mid-delivery from labo.' room to de
livery room, and the subsequent
separation from her child, she
should have that choice; not only the
choice, but the assurance that there
will be someone to look after and
assist her in a heme birth.
Few doctors are willing to apply
their expertise to home deliveries. It
is costly and inconvenient, and there
is also the übiquitous threat of mal
practice suits. Midwives are the only
professionals who generally assist
home births, and I say "profession
als" because, like Heinrichs, they too
have dedicated their lives and
careers "to the protection of the next
generation."
The midwife was an integral part of
family medicine in this country and is
still a respected and necessary health
worker in most countries in the
world, including Great Britain and
the Netherlands. It serves few but
obstetricians to deny the midwives
the right to practice and parents the
right to choose, responsibly, how
their children will be born.
