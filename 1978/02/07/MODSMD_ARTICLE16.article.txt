## Film/ron lillejord What's playin' at the Roxy in '78 
### 
Last year was a relatively
good year for quality Hol
lywood films; at the box-office,
it was a great one. "Star Wars"
has made $100 million plus,
and "Close Encounters" made
$39 million in one month.
"Julia" and "The Turning
Point," which may represent
the return of women to good
roles, are also doing great bus
iness.
So what does this mean for
1978 movies? It should mean
that better films will be made.
When Hollywood has more
money, more movies are
made, and directors get more
freedom and more dollars to
spend. Movies in 1978 will be
the recipient of this good for
tune, with many major direc
tors and stars to have pictures
released.
Fonda visible
Jane Fonda will be very visi
ble this year. Sometime in the
next two months, "Coming
Home" starring Fonda, Jon
Voigt and Bruce Dern, will be
released. The film explores the
effect the return to society has
upon Vietnam war veterans,
and is directed by the talented
Hal Ashby ("Shampoo," "The
Last Detail," "Bound for
Glory").
And "Coming Home" is just
the first of three '78 pictures for
Fonda. In late spring, Alan J.
Pakula will direct her in a film
called "Comes a Horseman."
The film will also star James
Caan and Jason Robards, and is
set in the 1380s West. "Comes
a Horseman" sounds like an
offbeat project for all involved,
but under the firm hand of
Pakula ("All the President's
Men") it will be a film to watch
for.
Finally, in December Jane
will star with Jack Lemmon in a
thriller called "The China Syn
drome," concluding a very
busy year for this superb ac
tress.
Vietnam
Besides "Coming Home,"
two other movies, "The Deer
Hunter" and "Apocalypse
Now," wi'l have Vietnam as a
major part of their plots.
"The Deer Hunter" will star
Robert DeNiro and John Cazale
in a tale of war veterans who go
hunting and find that they still
haven't lost the taste of killing.
Things soon get out of control.
The film is scheduled for a
probable August release.
But Francis Ford Coppola's
mammoth movie "Apocalypse

Now" is probably the most ea
gerly awaited film of the year.
"Apocalypse" is loosely based
on Conrad's "Heart of Dark
ness," and relates the story of a
commander, played by Marlon
Brando, in Vietnam. The film's
budget is rumored to be $31
million. Originally, George
Lucas was to make the film, but
he sold the rights to his friend
Coppola and went on to an
easier project, "Star Wars."
It took Coppola nearly a year
to make the film, and the prob
lems were staggering. It was
shot in the Philippine jungles;
Harvey Keitel quit after a
month of filming; the weather
wouldn't cooperate, and Bran
do's scenes had to be filmed in
a way that wouldn't show his
overweight (260 lb.) body.
Coppola spent all of his
"Godfather" profits on
"Apocalypse Now"; if it fails (it
has to make $60 million to re
coup production costs alone),
it may bankrupt him.
"Apocalypse Now" may be for
Coppola what "Intolerance"
was for Griffith; a work of art,
butacripplingfinancial failure.
After long delays, "Apocalypse
Now" will premiere in April.
Major directors
In addition to Coppola,
other major directors will have
movies released in 1978. In Ap
ril, Robert Altman will be rep
resented by "A Wedding." The
film features the typical Altman
ensemble casting, which in
cludes such unlikely names as
Carol Burnett, Desi Arnaz Jr.,
and delightfully, Lillian Gish
(who's long career started with
Griffith and a starring role in
the 1915 "Birth of a Nation").
Sam Peckinpah, the bizarre
and temperamental filmmaker,
will have "Convoy," based on
the C.W. McCall song, re
leased in midsummer. "Con
voy" will star Kris Kristofferson
and Ali MacGraw in her "come
back" performance. The film
could well be a disaster, but
with Peckinpah directing,
"Convoy" will at least be in
teresting.
Forman and Lumet
Two other talented direc
tors, Milos Forman and Sidney
Lumet, will each attempt a
musical for the first time. For
man, a Czech who came to the
U.S. and promptly made two
very fine films ("Taking Off"
and "One Flew Over the Cuc
koo's Nest") has completed
work on "Hair," to be released
in July. Forman's problem, ob

viously, is to make this essen
tially '60s musical work now
without appearing dated.
The energetic Lumet ("Net
work," "Dog Day Afternoon")
is taking on the long-running
Broadway musical, "The Wiz,"
in big-budget ($lB million)
style. The film, an all-black ver
sion of "The Wizard of Oz,"
will star Diana Ross as an adult
Dorothy. Lumet has handled
big-budget entertainments be
fore ("Murder on the Orient
Express"), and he is expected
to infuse "The Wiz" with his
customary energy and style.
Neil Simon
Other epic or all-star pro
ductions for '78 include Neil
Simon's "The Cheap Detec
tive" with Peter Falk in a
Bogart-style role surrounded
by a cast that includes Ann
-Margaret, Madelaine Kahn,
Louise Fletcher and Marsha
Mason.
The producers of "Murder
on the Orient Express" will
bring another Agatha Christie
mystery to the screen, "Death
on the Nile." The film is
budgeted at $14 million and
will have an all-star cast headed
by Peter Ustinov as detective
Hercule Poirot.
'Superman'
The big blockbuster,
though, has to be the $30 mill
ion production of "Super

man." This film is trying very
hard to be the most hyped of all
time; the latest ream of public
ity concerns a special effect
where Superman will be pro
jected into the audience in
life-like form. Technology
marches on.
Besides super productions,
two other not-so-new movie
trends will be in evidence. One
is actors who double as direc
tors. Warren Beatty will star in
and direct "Heaven Can Wait"
(a remake of the 1943 Lubitsch
film); Dustin Hoffman will do
the same in "Straight Time";
Burt Reynolds will direct him
self in the black comedy "The
End"; and Jack Nicholson is
just about finished with "Goin'
South," his second effort as a
director.
Sequels
The other trend is not. par
ticularly welcome. It is the
sequel. And there will be a
number of them this year, in
cluding "Omen II," "Other
Side of the Mountain II," "In
ternational Velvet" (with
Tatum O'Neal taking up where
Elizabeth Taylor left off) and,
inevitably, "Jaws II" (which will
not be directed by Steven
Spielberg, the director of
"Jaws"). The bottom of the
sequel bucket will doubtless
be reached by "The Bad News
Bears Go to Japan."

set in the 1380s West. "Comes
a Horseman" sounds like an
offbeat project for all involved,
but under the firm hand of
Pakula ("All the President's
Men") it will be a film to watch
for.
Finally, in December Jane
will star with Jack Lemmon in a
thriller called "The China Syn
drome," concluding a very
busy year for this superb ac
tress.
Vietnam
Besides "Coming Home,"
two other movies, "The Deer
Hunter" and "Apocalypse
Now," wi'l have Vietnam as a
major part of their plots.
"The Deer Hunter" will star
Robert DeNiro and John Cazale
in a tale of war veterans who go
hunting and find that they still
haven't lost the taste of killing.
Things soon get out of control.
The film is scheduled for a
probable August release.
But Francis Ford Coppola's
mammoth movie "Apocalypse

Now" is probably the most ea
gerly awaited film of the year.
"Apocalypse" is loosely based
on Conrad's "Heart of Dark
ness," and relates the story of a
commander, played by Marlon
Brando, in Vietnam. The film's
budget is rumored to be $31
million. Originally, George
Lucas was to make the film, but
he sold the rights to his friend
Coppola and went on to an
easier project, "Star Wars."
It took Coppola nearly a year
to make the film, and the prob
lems were staggering. It was
shot in the Philippine jungles;
Harvey Keitel quit after a
month of filming; the weather
wouldn't cooperate, and Bran
do's scenes had to be filmed in
a way that wouldn't show his
overweight (260 lb.) body.
Coppola spent all of his
"Godfather" profits on
"Apocalypse Now"; if it fails (it
has to make $60 million to re
coup production costs alone),
it may bankrupt him.
"Apocalypse Now" may be for
Coppola what "Intolerance"
was for Griffith; a work of art,
butacripplingfinancial failure.
After long delays, "Apocalypse
Now" will premiere in April.
Major directors
In addition to Coppola,
other major directors will have
movies released in 1978. In Ap
ril, Robert Altman will be rep
resented by "A Wedding." The
film features the typical Altman
ensemble casting, which in
cludes such unlikely names as
Carol Burnett, Desi Arnaz Jr.,
and delightfully, Lillian Gish
(who's long career started with
Griffith and a starring role in
the 1915 "Birth of a Nation").
Sam Peckinpah, the bizarre
and temperamental filmmaker,
will have "Convoy," based on
the C.W. McCall song, re
leased in midsummer. "Con
voy" will star Kris Kristofferson
and Ali MacGraw in her "come
back" performance. The film
could well be a disaster, but
with Peckinpah directing,
"Convoy" will at least be in
teresting.
Forman and Lumet
Two other talented direc
tors, Milos Forman and Sidney
Lumet, will each attempt a
musical for the first time. For
man, a Czech who came to the
U.S. and promptly made two
very fine films ("Taking Off"
and "One Flew Over the Cuc
koo's Nest") has completed
work on "Hair," to be released
in July. Forman's problem, ob

viously, is to make this essen
tially '60s musical work now
without appearing dated.
The energetic Lumet ("Net
work," "Dog Day Afternoon")
is taking on the long-running
Broadway musical, "The Wiz,"
in big-budget ($lB million)
style. The film, an all-black ver
sion of "The Wizard of Oz,"
will star Diana Ross as an adult
Dorothy. Lumet has handled
big-budget entertainments be
fore ("Murder on the Orient
Express"), and he is expected
to infuse "The Wiz" with his
customary energy and style.
Neil Simon
Other epic or all-star pro
ductions for '78 include Neil
Simon's "The Cheap Detec
tive" with Peter Falk in a
Bogart-style role surrounded
by a cast that includes Ann
-Margaret, Madelaine Kahn,
Louise Fletcher and Marsha
Mason.
The producers of "Murder
on the Orient Express" will
bring another Agatha Christie
mystery to the screen, "Death
on the Nile." The film is
budgeted at $14 million and
will have an all-star cast headed
by Peter Ustinov as detective
Hercule Poirot.
'Superman'
The big blockbuster,
though, has to be the $30 mill
ion production of "Super

man." This film is trying very
hard to be the most hyped of all
time; the latest ream of public
ity concerns a special effect
where Superman will be pro
jected into the audience in
life-like form. Technology
marches on.
Besides super productions,
two other not-so-new movie
trends will be in evidence. One
is actors who double as direc
tors. Warren Beatty will star in
and direct "Heaven Can Wait"
(a remake of the 1943 Lubitsch
film); Dustin Hoffman will do
the same in "Straight Time";
Burt Reynolds will direct him
self in the black comedy "The
End"; and Jack Nicholson is
just about finished with "Goin'
South," his second effort as a
director.
Sequels
The other trend is not. par
ticularly welcome. It is the
sequel. And there will be a
number of them this year, in
cluding "Omen II," "Other
Side of the Mountain II," "In
ternational Velvet" (with
Tatum O'Neal taking up where
Elizabeth Taylor left off) and,
inevitably, "Jaws II" (which will
not be directed by Steven
Spielberg, the director of
"Jaws"). The bottom of the
sequel bucket will doubtless
be reached by "The Bad News
Bears Go to Japan."

Last year was a relatively
good year for quality Hol
lywood films; at the box-office,
it was a great one. "Star Wars"
has made $100 million plus,
and "Close Encounters" made
$39 million in one month.
"Julia" and "The Turning
Point," which may represent
the return of women to good
roles, are also doing great bus
iness.
So what does this mean for
1978 movies? It should mean
that better films will be made.
When Hollywood has more
money, more movies are
made, and directors get more
freedom and more dollars to
spend. Movies in 1978 will be
the recipient of this good for
tune, with many major direc
tors and stars to have pictures
released.
Fonda visible
Jane Fonda will be very visi
ble this year. Sometime in the
next two months, "Coming
Home" starring Fonda, Jon
Voigt and Bruce Dern, will be
released. The film explores the
effect the return to society has
upon Vietnam war veterans,
and is directed by the talented
Hal Ashby ("Shampoo," "The
Last Detail," "Bound for
Glory").
And "Coming Home" is just
the first of three '78 pictures for
Fonda. In late spring, Alan J.
Pakula will direct her in a film
called "Comes a Horseman."
The film will also star James
Caan and Jason Robards, and is
set in the 1380s West. "Comes
a Horseman" sounds like an

shot in the Philippine jungles;
Harvey Keitel quit after a
month of filming; the weather
wouldn't cooperate, and Bran
do's scenes had to be filmed in
a way that wouldn't show his
overweight (260 lb.) body.
Coppola spent all of his
"Godfather" profits on
"Apocalypse Now"; if it fails (it
has to make $60 million to re
coup production costs alone),
it may bankrupt him.
"Apocalypse Now" may be for
Coppola what "Intolerance"
was for Griffith; a work of art,
butacripplingfinancial failure.
After long delays, "Apocalypse
Now" will premiere in April.
Major directors
In addition to Coppola,
other major directors will have
movies released in 1978. In Ap
ril, Robert Altman will be rep
resented by "A Wedding." The
film features the typical Altman
ensemble casting, which in
cludes such unlikely names as
Carol Burnett, Desi Arnaz Jr.,
and delightfully, Lillian Gish
(who's long career started with
Griffith and a starring role in
the 1915 "Birth of a Nation").
Sam Peckinpah, the bizarre
and temperamental filmmaker,
will have "Convoy," based on
the C.W. McCall song, re
leased in midsummer. "Con
voy" will star Kris Kristofferson
and Ali MacGraw in her "come
back" performance. The film
could well be a disaster, but
with Peckinpah directing,
"Convoy" will at least be in
teresting.
Forman and Lumet
Two other talented direc
tors, Milos Forman and Sidney
Lumet, will each attempt a
musical for the first time. For
man, a Czech who came to the
U.S. and promptly made two
very fine films ("Taking Off"
and "One Flew Over the Cuc
koo's Nest") has completed
work on "Hair," to be released
in July. Forman's problem, ob

viously, is to make this essen
tially '60s musical work now
without appearing dated.
The energetic Lumet ("Net
work," "Dog Day Afternoon")
is taking on the long-running
Broadway musical, "The Wiz,"
in big-budget ($lB million)
style. The film, an all-black ver
sion of "The Wizard of Oz,"
will star Diana Ross as an adult
Dorothy. Lumet has handled
big-budget entertainments be
fore ("Murder on the Orient
Express"), and he is expected
to infuse "The Wiz" with his
customary energy and style.
Neil Simon
Other epic or all-star pro
ductions for '78 include Neil
Simon's "The Cheap Detec
tive" with Peter Falk in a
Bogart-style role surrounded
by a cast that includes Ann
-Margaret, Madelaine Kahn,
Louise Fletcher and Marsha
Mason.
The producers of "Murder
on the Orient Express" will
bring another Agatha Christie
mystery to the screen, "Death
on the Nile." The film is
budgeted at $14 million and
will have an all-star cast headed
by Peter Ustinov as detective
Hercule Poirot.
'Superman'
The big blockbuster,
though, has to be the $30 mill
ion production of "Super

man." This film is trying very
hard to be the most hyped of all
time; the latest ream of public
ity concerns a special effect
where Superman will be pro
jected into the audience in
life-like form. Technology
marches on.
Besides super productions,
two other not-so-new movie
trends will be in evidence. One
is actors who double as direc
tors. Warren Beatty will star in
and direct "Heaven Can Wait"
(a remake of the 1943 Lubitsch
film); Dustin Hoffman will do
the same in "Straight Time";
Burt Reynolds will direct him
self in the black comedy "The
End"; and Jack Nicholson is
just about finished with "Goin'
South," his second effort as a
director.
Sequels
The other trend is not. par
ticularly welcome. It is the
sequel. And there will be a
number of them this year, in
cluding "Omen II," "Other
Side of the Mountain II," "In
ternational Velvet" (with
Tatum O'Neal taking up where
Elizabeth Taylor left off) and,
inevitably, "Jaws II" (which will
not be directed by Steven
Spielberg, the director of
"Jaws"). The bottom of the
sequel bucket will doubtless
be reached by "The Bad News
Bears Go to Japan."

Last year was a relatively
good year for quality Hol
lywood films; at the box-office,
it was a great one. "Star Wars"
has made $100 million plus,
and "Close Encounters" made
$39 million in one month.
"Julia" and "The Turning
Point," which may represent
the return of women to good
roles, are also doing great bus
iness.
So what does this mean for
1978 movies? It should mean
that better films will be made.
When Hollywood has more
money, more movies are
made, and directors get more
freedom and more dollars to
spend. Movies in 1978 will be
the recipient of this good for
tune, with many major direc
tors and stars to have pictures
released.
Fonda visible
Jane Fonda will be very visi
ble this year. Sometime in the
next two months, "Coming
Home" starring Fonda, Jon
Voigt and Bruce Dern, will be
released. The film explores the
effect the return to society has
upon Vietnam war veterans,
and is directed by the talented
Hal Ashby ("Shampoo," "The
Last Detail," "Bound for
Glory").
And "Coming Home" is just
the first of three '78 pictures for
Fonda. In late spring, Alan J.
Pakula will direct her in a film
called "Comes a Horseman."
The film will also star James
Caan and Jason Robards, and is
set in the 1380s West. "Comes
a Horseman" sounds like an
offbeat project for all involved,
but under the firm hand of
Pakula ("All the President's
Men") it will be a film to watch
for.
Finally, in December Jane
will star with Jack Lemmon in a
thriller called "The China Syn
drome," concluding a very
busy year for this superb ac
tress.
Vietnam
Besides "Coming Home,"
two other movies, "The Deer
Hunter" and "Apocalypse
Now," wi'l have Vietnam as a
major part of their plots.
"The Deer Hunter" will star
Robert DeNiro and John Cazale
in a tale of war veterans who go
hunting and find that they still
haven't lost the taste of killing.
Things soon get out of control.
The film is scheduled for a
probable August release.
But Francis Ford Coppola's
mammoth movie "Apocalypse

Now" is probably the most ea
gerly awaited film of the year.
"Apocalypse" is loosely based
on Conrad's "Heart of Dark
ness," and relates the story of a
commander, played by Marlon
Brando, in Vietnam. The film's
budget is rumored to be $31
million. Originally, George
Lucas was to make the film, but
he sold the rights to his friend
Coppola and went on to an
easier project, "Star Wars."
It took Coppola nearly a year
to make the film, and the prob
lems were staggering. It was
shot in the Philippine jungles;
Harvey Keitel quit after a
month of filming; the weather
wouldn't cooperate, and Bran
do's scenes had to be filmed in
