## Sonny R: no sell-out 
### 
The Sonny Rollins of today is
less daring than he was some
20 years ago. Then, Rollins
would hypnotize his nightclub
crowds with fantastically cont
rived and executed sets which
would often span many styles
and songs in one giant musical
statement.
He may no longer take the
risks he once did, but Rollins
still has the intensity and depth
he always displayed. Even the
most skeptical critics have to
rank him among the three or
four most important tenor sax

players in the last 20 years.
Rollin's latest album, "Easy
Living," is a case in point. The
album, make no doubt about
it, is designed to sell. The ver
sion of Stevie Wonder's "isn't
She Lovely" (which is excel
lently played here) should be
itself responsible for many
sales.
But Rollins has not really
"sold out," to use a phrase
common to much of today's
jazz criticism. Several of the
songs, including the title cut
and the beautiful "My One and

Only Love" have great depth
and are among Rollin's best re
cordings. In effect the bad
press (or even worse, the neg
lect) which Rollins has lately
received is undeserved.
Rollins' solos and beautiful
tonal colorings rank him above
many of the far more popular
sax players; and also above
most of the more critically
acclaimed. I would, for in
stance, rank Rollins without
hesitation above Dexter Cor
don, John Klemmer (even
though Klemmer's playing on
Roy Haynes latest album is the
best thing he has done in
years), Tom Scott and a host of
others. Rashaan Roland Kiiks'
untimely death may have left
Rollins as the premier tenor sax
player in jazz.
It has been pointed out that
Rollins has rarely recorded as
well as he has performed. A
live recording of Rollins in a
good club with plenty of room
to stretch out (much like Dex
ter Cordon's "Homecoming"
album) would be the perfect
outlet for Rollins right now.
But there is also the question
of what Rollins wants to do.
Right now he seems torn bet
ween gaining a popular audi
ence and playing music. So far,
he has been moderately suc
cessful at doing both, but the
mixturestill isn'tasmoothone.
