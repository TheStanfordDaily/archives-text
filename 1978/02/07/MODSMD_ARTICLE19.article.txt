## Lousy programming hits the SFSO 
### 
There is more to program
ming a successful concert than
simply finding nice pieces for
the orchestra to play; such an
approach is an important part
of the picture, but the true art
of programming lies in the
consideration of the subtler
psychological elements that
can unify three or four dispa
rate works into something that
the audience can relate to as a
complete entity.
This is, in fact, the way that
the listener relates to a prog
ram, regardless of how its
programmers see it: the lis
tener is at a concert, an even
ing, an event, not just an arbit
rary sampling of unsolicited
sounds.
Because of this built-in bias
the programmers must be
careful to consider the affect

and duration of each piece, so
as to arrive at an ordering that
will show the work in its best
light, with as little interference
as possible from the works that
surround it on the program.
Obvious guidelines
The San Francisco Sym
phony failed last week to
satisfy even the most obvious
of these guidelines; this be
came apparent upon hearing
the first work of the evening,
that being Mozart's "Serenade
in D Major, K. 204." This piece
was written as the 18th century
counterpart of muzak.
"Ridiculously pompous," you
say, but true: this music was
carefully designed to be light,
entertaining, and almost com
pletely unobtrusive to the
weddings, anniversaries, bar
mitzvahs, etc., that were occur

ring simultaneously with it.
Mozart's care in this work,
then, was to organize skillfully
his musical ideas into some
thing that was amusing
background, unburdened with
interruptive melodies; he did a
fine job, but the result is not
very listenable in a concert
situation. The piece lasted an
ungodly 45 minutes, not be
cause the musical content de
manded it, but simply because
the party lasted that long. . . .
Not exactly
What the program needed
next was one major, impres
sive work to convince the au
dience that the first half was
not endured in vain. Unfortu
nately, this was not exactly
what we received. The second
half opened with the "Three
Orchestra Pieces" by Alban
Berg, which seemed only to
alienate the audience further,
their alienation expressed in a
series of coughs, sneezes,
sniggers, and problems in bre
athing that had been forgotten
in the Mozart, but now
hopelessly remembered.
These pieces are dark,
somber, and beautifully put
together, but difficult to listen
to because of their density; al
though they are Mahlerian in

flavor you must concentrate to
hear it, which's something the
audience didn't really feel like
doing.
Clean-up
This placed Beethoven's
"First Symphony" in the dif
ficult position of batting
clean-up for the entire concert.
This is tremendously unfair,
mostly because it is a light
piece that would have done
better in place of the opening
Mozart, with a more successful
crowd pleaser, substituted at
the end.
Perhaps this is unfair to Edo
de Waart, in that the orchestra
actually played very well
throughout, with superlative
performances turned in by the
entire woodwind section
(especially flautist Paul Renzi
and oboist Marc Lifshey), once
again the cellos, and even the
brass sounded good.
Patty melts
It must have been the quality
of the playing that made me so
frustrated about the program
ming: each of these pieces was
played well enough to justify
its inclusion on other more
balanced programs. It was like
a meal made up of foods you
aren't particularly crazy about,
all beautifully prepared.
