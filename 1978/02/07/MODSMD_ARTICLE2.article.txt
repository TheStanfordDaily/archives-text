# UMW hits tentative accord
## 
### 
Washingon (AP) â€” Negotiators
reached a tentative agreement yes
terday on contract terms that could
end a record 63-day nationwide coal
strike that has shrunk winter coal
stockpiles and forced cutbacks in
electrical power.
The tentative pact was announced
at a news conference by United Mine
Workers (UMW) President Arnold
Miller and chief federal mediator
Wayne Horvitz.
"I think this is a good tentative ag
reement," said Miller, emphasizing
that it would restore pension and
health benefits that have been cut off
to some UMW workers.
The proposed settlement would
mean an increase of almost 37 per
cent in wages and fringe benefits for
miners over a three-year period.

Miller said he would present the
tentative agreement to his 39-
member bargaining council this
morning and would urge its ap
proval.
The bargaining council's consider
ation of the proposed contract is the
first step in a ratification process that
normally takes about 10 days. Even
after ratification, it likely will be sev
eral more days before coal moves
again through the supply pipeline.
Approval not assured
Approval by the bargainingcouncil
is not a foregone conclusion. Its
members rejected one proposed
contract agreement in 1974 before
accepting a second one.
Miller declined to predict whether
the council would approve the terms
but he appealed to all UMW mem
bers to urge their representatives to
accept the proposed pact.
The Bituminous Coal Operators
Association declined comment on
the tentative agreement. Its 130
members also must ratify any con
tract, but that process is viewed
largely as a formality.
Labor Secretary Ray Marshall said
in a statement that he was delighted
at the tentative settlement and said
"this is a fair contract, genuinely
good for both parties."
Strike caused 'suffering'
"The strike has meant great suffer
ing from UMW members and their
families," Marshall said. "The losses
to the coal companies are reckoned
in the tens of millions of dollars and
the strike has brought the country

perilously close to widespread coal
shortages in the midst of a severe
winter,"
Horvitz emphasized that the ac
cord was only tentative, pending ap
proval by the bargaining council and
the UMYV's rank and file.
Horvitz also thanked West Virginia
Gov. Jay Rockefeller for his "prot
racted efforts" in assisting the
negotiations.
Rockefeller made an unexpected
appearance at the news conference
and put in a pitch for ratification of
the contract. He said the proposed
terms meet the "human needs" of
union members, thousands of whom
live in his state.
Officials push ratification
The statements by Horvitz, Miller
and Rockefeller appeared to be the
first push by officials to win ratifica
tion of the tentative contract.
The union chief omitted details of
concessions the UMW is widely re
ported to have agreed to concerning
other issues. Theseinclude requiring
miners on wildcat strikes to reim
burse their benefit funds for money
lost and steps to discipline miners
who are repeatedly absent from
work.
News of the tentative settlement
was greeted with cautious optimism
by one UMW district leader.
"I think our miners are ready to go
back to work, provided they get what
they want," said Valerio Scarton of
UMW District 2 in Western Pennsyl
vania. "If they don't, I'm sure they'll
stick it out some more."
