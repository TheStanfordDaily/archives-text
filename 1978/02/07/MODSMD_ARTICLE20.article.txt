"S. Miles is Me" is an au
tobiographical one-person
musical written by Sarah Miles.
Sarah Miles plays Sarah Miles
in the play, as well as Sarah
Miles' parents, family, hus
band, and theater teacher.
Sarah Miles wrote the lyrics of
"S. Miles," and she wrote all of
the script. The press release for
this play says that "S. Miles"
puts Miles' life on the line, and
they claim that the production
is above all else "a vision of
truth and theater."
Oh please, stop
I have a lot of trouble with
those final assertions, I had a lot
of trouble with this play. Even
though Sarah Miles is an ex
tremely talented actress with a
long list of sometimes very im

pressive film and theater cre
dits, "S. Miles" is a dumb
show, and it is likely to be sav
aged by most conscionable cri
tics. The music is not memora
ble, the staging is only passa
ble, and the whole thing seems
more a promotional stunt than
a life story. It is overly cute, and
crammed to the gills with em
barassingly rotten
"philosophy" on the meaning
of S. Miles' life.
She hit me
It is a very embarrassing
thing to watch.
And I do realize that because
the thing claims to be the story
of an actress playing herself,
criticism of this kind smells of
manslaughter. I keep wanting
to re-stress the talent S. Miles
has shown elsewhere, and to
mention the qualifications of
the people who helped her
stage herself (In "Term of
Trial" they say Miles' outplayed
Sir Laurence Olivier, and she
did well for herself at England's
National Theater — Peter

Hunt, her director, got his start
with Whitmore's "Give 'Em
Hell, Harry").
So I killed her
Every time I mention those
things, though, I feel dow
nright dishonest. Though it's
important to stress the differ
ence between the act and the
actress, that kind of thing
might foster an idea that my
feplings on the whole were
mixed. And this is not true. I
thought "S. Miles is Me" was
thoroughly bad, and a big mis
take. I would not recommend
seeing it, and I think that know
ledge of the achievements of
those involved only serves to
make things worse. Sarah
Miles wrote a bad script for
herself, and bad lyrics, and it is
embarrassing to watch her re
duce herself to such a collec
tion of two line ditties
("whenever I think of death/ I
lose my breath. . ."). The play
wastes a lot of talent: if I lost
my temper I'd call it an ar
chetypal tour de farce.

the thing claims to be the story
of an actress playing herself,
criticism of this kind smells of
manslaughter. I keep wanting
to re-stress the talent S. Miles
has shown elsewhere, and to
mention the qualifications of
the people who helped her
stage herself (In "Term of
Trial" they say Miles' outplayed
Sir Laurence Olivier, and she
did well for herself at England's
National Theater — Peter

Hunt, her director, got his start
with Whitmore's "Give 'Em
Hell, Harry").
So I killed her
Every time I mention those
things, though, I feel dow
nright dishonest. Though it's
important to stress the differ
ence between the act and the
actress, that kind of thing
might foster an idea that my
feplings on the whole were
mixed. And this is not true. I
thought "S. Miles is Me" was
thoroughly bad, and a big mis
take. I would not recommend
seeing it, and I think that know
ledge of the achievements of
those involved only serves to
make things worse. Sarah
Miles wrote a bad script for
herself, and bad lyrics, and it is
embarrassing to watch her re
duce herself to such a collec
tion of two line ditties
("whenever I think of death/ I
lose my breath. . ."). The play
wastes a lot of talent: if I lost
my temper I'd call it an ar
chetypal tour de farce.
One-person shows — in
vogue these days — are gener
ally one of two varieties. The
first group includes Twains,
Holmeses, Wildes, Dicken
sons and the like, and is usually
an attempt to revive and
simplify dead or near-dead
persons for the benefit of an
audience not fortunate to
catch the genuine article.
Then there are the wholesale
displays of talent, in which a
Liza Minelli type takes to the
stage and gives a thinly-veiled
concert. Plot is dispensed with,
and Theme, and continuity. Vet
in the hands of a large enough
talent such displays can be
overpowering.

"S. Miles is Me" is an au
tobiographical one-person
musical written by Sarah Miles.
Sarah Miles plays Sarah Miles
in the play, as well as Sarah
Miles' parents, family, hus
band, and theater teacher.
Sarah Miles wrote the lyrics of
"S. Miles," and she wrote all of
the script. The press release for
this play says that "S. Miles"
puts Miles' life on the line, and
they claim that the production
is above all else "a vision of
truth and theater."
Oh please, stop
I have a lot of trouble with
those final assertions, I had a lot
of trouble with this play. Even
though Sarah Miles is an ex
tremely talented actress with a
long list of sometimes very im

pressive film and theater cre
dits, "S. Miles" is a dumb
show, and it is likely to be sav
aged by most conscionable cri
tics. The music is not memora
ble, the staging is only passa
ble, and the whole thing seems
more a promotional stunt than
a life story. It is overly cute, and
crammed to the gills with em
barassingly rotten
"philosophy" on the meaning
of S. Miles' life.
