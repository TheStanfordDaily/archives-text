## A
						restored '110' 
### 
To put my evaluation of the
production of "110 in the
Shade" which is playing in the
Sequoia-Fox Theatre of Red
wood City into the dialect of
the script itself, I will say that
this play nearly made me break
out in shingles. The theater has
recently been restored to its
original function of showing
live performances versus
movies, and provides an excel
lent opportunity for people to
see this entertaining musical
done in a style similar to that of
vaudeville.
The well-known characteris
tics of that period are hence in
this production; namely, stock
sets, uncontrolled or miscon
trolled lighting, individualized
use of makeup (amounts vary
ing radically), colorful cos
tumes, professional orchestra
tion, and crystal-clear sub
plots.
The play itself
The play itself was adapted
by N. Richard Nash from"The
Rainmaker," which gives it a
plotline both more poignant
and comic than "Oklahoma"
together with the songs of
Schmidt and (ones, who
created the score and lyrics for

"The Fantastiks."
Director Muriel Older is to
be commended for her fine
casting of the roles and also for
not trying to make the play
more complex or more mean
ingful than it is. It is a pure mus
ical; simple, lively and a joy to
behold. Notable professionals
in the cast are Linda Bergen as
Lizzie, Ed Sherry as Starbuck,
and Hank McGuckin as Sheriff
File.
Each of.the above players is a
guest artist from the Actor's
Equity Association. While their
technique is excellent the
enthusiasm of the "amateur"
members of the cast in such
songs as "Everything Beautiful
Happens at Night," is what
holds the attention of the audi
ence. This describes the situa
tion exactly in the cases of
Kevin Minkoff as Jim and Tam
ara Weinstein as Snookie.
Their duet, "Little Red Hat," is
delightful and Minkoff's
characterization cf Lizzie's
simpleton brother brought
much applause. Together
these two endow the perfor
mance with youthful zest
sadly absent from the perfor
mances of the professionals.
