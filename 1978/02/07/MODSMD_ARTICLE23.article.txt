Sadat seeks pressure on Israel
Washington — Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said
yesterday that there could be peace in the Middle East
"in less than a week" if Israel agreed to return to its old
borders and make Jerusalem an open city.
But he foresaw little prospect of that unless the United
States exerted pressure on Israel.
So far, there has been no indication that Sadat has
persuaded President Jimmy Carter to lean harder on
Israel. A White House statement issued at the conclu
sion of Carter's weekend talks with Sadat at Camp David,
Md., said the U.S. role was that of a "friend of both
sides."
At the same time, though, the administration ap
peared to be nearing a decision to sell a squadron of F-5E
jets to Egypt.
"It is my belief he (Carter) is close to a decision," Sen.
Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.) said, "and I would like to see him
delay it."
Once Congress is formally notified, it has 30 days to
veto a weapons sale. Javits wants Congress to have the
chance to consider the proposal without a deadline.
Heavy snowfall cripples Northeast
New York — Heavy snow driven by high winds swept
through the Northeast yesterday, crippling road, rail and
air traffic and bringing business and government to a
near standstill for the second time in 17 days.
Offices closed early and workers struggled to fight
their way home. Snow emergencies were declared in
New York City, Baltimore and dozens of other cities and
towns throughout the region.
Governors Milton Shapp of Pennsylvania and J.
Joseph Garrahy of Rhode Island proclaimed states of
emergency, allowing them to call out National Guard
units to help stranded motorists and road-clearing
crews. Pennsylvania's Civil Defense headquarters was
activated.
The snow stretched from Washington through the
Middle Atlantic states and up into parts of New England.
Unlike last month's blizzard, which had not been pre
dicted, yesterday's storm had been forecast since early
in the weekend. But the impact did not seem to be
lessened by the advance warning.
The Midwest, still digging out from a blizzard that hit a
little more than a week ago, reported relatively few prob
lems yesterday, but the West Coast was suffering torren
tial rains. Five people in Southern California died Sun
day in traffic accidents caused by rain and mudslides,
and forecasters predicted heavy rain for Northern
California during the coming week.
Airlines discontinue use of life rafts
Miami — Three airlines have cut costs by removing life
rafts from passenger jets flying routes over stretches of
water. And the Federal Aviation Administration says at
least four other carriers have been told they can do the
same.
Braniff and National confirmed yesterday that life rafts
have been removed from their aircraft flying the Atlantic
coastal corridor linking Miami and the Northeast and
Gulf routes between South Florida and the West. Alaska
Airlines flies over water on its Seattle-Anchorage route
without life rafts on its 7275.
Transoceanic routes are not affected by the FAA's ap
proval of the removal of life rafts from airliners flying
over stretches of water.
The airlines had asked for the exemptions of the life
raft requirements on certain overwater routes on
grounds that they could save fuel without the extra
weight of the life rafts and that the requirement was not
necessary for modern aircraft.
Costa Rica elects new president
San )ose, Costa Rica — As tiny Costa Rica, one of Latin
America's few civilian governments, elected an opposi

tion leader as its president, neighboring Nicaragua faced
mounting protests yesterday against the strong-arm rule
of President Anastasio Somoza.
Two other nearby Latin American nations, El Salvador
and Columbia, were troubled by peasant unrest or guer
rilla attacks.
With the vote count from Sunday's election in Costa
Rica nearing an end, opposition leader Rodrigo Carazo
has what political analysts say is an irreversible winning
edge. Carazo has more than 51 per cent of the vote as
compared to 46 per cent for his nearest challenger, Luis
Albert Monge of the ruling National Liberation Party.
The remainder was divided among six other candidates.
Humphrey takes oath as senator
Washington — Muriel Buck Humphrey took the oath
of office as U.S. senator yesterday and promised to help
pass the legislative program left behind at the death of
lier husband, Hubert.
She told reporters after the brief ceremony on the
Senate floor that she has not decided whether to seek
election in her own right in a special election to be held
10 months from now.
She said she will make that decision within two
months.
She inherits a legislative agenda that ranges from the
Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment bill to legislation
that would structure U.S. foreign aid and set policy and
create new programs in such fields as international
trade, agriculture, child nutrition, small business and
urban and rural development.
Japanese erect pyramid in Egypt
Cairo — Egyptian workers in flowing robes laid the
cornerstone yesterday of what will be a Japanese-built,
36-foot-high pyramid, the first in the lanJ of the
pharaohs in nearly 4500 years.
Chanting "pray to the Prophet" as sand whipped their
faces, 20 workers strained at the ropes and moved a
one-ton limestone block into place. Nearly 3000 blocks,
some weighing 2.5 tons, will be needed.
The Nippon Television Network is sponsoring the pro
ject, estimated to cost about $1 million and involve
about 10,000 local workers.
Chinese 'Year of the Horse' begins
Hong Kong — The Year of the Horse replaced the Year
of the Snake at midnight last night and millions began
lunar New Year festivities here and in China, Vietnam,
Thailand, Korea, Burma and Taiwan.
The Chinese lunar calendar classifies 12 years as a
cycle and names them after animals in the following
order: rat, cow, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse,
goat, monkey, cock, dog and pig.
The Chinese consider the Year of the Horse to be
better than most years. Horses, they say, are spirited,
alert, obedient, loyal and hard-working, but others note
they also can be stubborn and unpredictable.
Dow Jones average slips 2.34
New York — The stock market gave ground in slow
trading yesterday in a session shortened by two hours at
New York exchanges because of a severe snowstorm.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had
struggled to a 6.84 gain last week, pulled back 2.34 to
768.62.
Volume on the Big Board totaled 11.63 million shares
in the four-hour session, against 19.40 million in the full
six-hour day last Friday.
Today's Weather
Periods of rain likely through tomorrow. Lows in
upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs both days in the upper 50s
and low 60s. Gale warning for gusty southerly winds
increasing to 20 to 35 mph this morning. Chance of rain
70 per cent today and 70 per cent tonight.

Chinese 'Year of the Horse' begins
Hong Kong — The Year of the Horse replaced the Year
of the Snake at midnight last night and millions began
lunar New Year festivities here and in China, Vietnam,
Thailand, Korea, Burma and Taiwan.
The Chinese lunar calendar classifies 12 years as a
cycle and names them after animals in the following
order: rat, cow, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse,
goat, monkey, cock, dog and pig.
The Chinese consider the Year of the Horse to be
better than most years. Horses, they say, are spirited,
alert, obedient, loyal and hard-working, but others note
they also can be stubborn and unpredictable.
Dow Jones average slips 2.34
New York — The stock market gave ground in slow
trading yesterday in a session shortened by two hours at
New York exchanges because of a severe snowstorm.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had
struggled to a 6.84 gain last week, pulled back 2.34 to
768.62.
Volume on the Big Board totaled 11.63 million shares
in the four-hour session, against 19.40 million in the full
six-hour day last Friday.
Today's Weather
Periods of rain likely through tomorrow. Lows in
upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs both days in the upper 50s
and low 60s. Gale warning for gusty southerly winds
increasing to 20 to 35 mph this morning. Chance of rain
70 per cent today and 70 per cent tonight.
Sadat seeks pressure on Israel
Washington — Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said
yesterday that there could be peace in the Middle East
"in less than a week" if Israel agreed to return to its old
borders and make Jerusalem an open city.
But he foresaw little prospect of that unless the United
States exerted pressure on Israel.
So far, there has been no indication that Sadat has
persuaded President Jimmy Carter to lean harder on
Israel. A White House statement issued at the conclu
sion of Carter's weekend talks with Sadat at Camp David,
Md., said the U.S. role was that of a "friend of both
sides."
At the same time, though, the administration ap
peared to be nearing a decision to sell a squadron of F-5E
jets to Egypt.
"It is my belief he (Carter) is close to a decision," Sen.
Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.) said, "and I would like to see him
delay it."
Once Congress is formally notified, it has 30 days to
veto a weapons sale. Javits wants Congress to have the
chance to consider the proposal without a deadline.
Heavy snowfall cripples Northeast
New York — Heavy snow driven by high winds swept
through the Northeast yesterday, crippling road, rail and
air traffic and bringing business and government to a
near standstill for the second time in 17 days.
Offices closed early and workers struggled to fight
their way home. Snow emergencies were declared in
New York City, Baltimore and dozens of other cities and
towns throughout the region.
Governors Milton Shapp of Pennsylvania and J.
Joseph Garrahy of Rhode Island proclaimed states of
emergency, allowing them to call out National Guard
units to help stranded motorists and road-clearing
crews. Pennsylvania's Civil Defense headquarters was
activated.
The snow stretched from Washington through the
Middle Atlantic states and up into parts of New England.
Unlike last month's blizzard, which had not been pre
dicted, yesterday's storm had been forecast since early
in the weekend. But the impact did not seem to be
lessened by the advance warning.
The Midwest, still digging out from a blizzard that hit a
little more than a week ago, reported relatively few prob
lems yesterday, but the West Coast was suffering torren
tial rains. Five people in Southern California died Sun
day in traffic accidents caused by rain and mudslides,
and forecasters predicted heavy rain for Northern
California during the coming week.
Airlines discontinue use of life rafts
Miami — Three airlines have cut costs by removing life
rafts from passenger jets flying routes over stretches of
water. And the Federal Aviation Administration says at
least four other carriers have been told they can do the
same.
Braniff and National confirmed yesterday that life rafts
have been removed from their aircraft flying the Atlantic
coastal corridor linking Miami and the Northeast and
Gulf routes between South Florida and the West. Alaska
Airlines flies over water on its Seattle-Anchorage route
without life rafts on its 7275.
Transoceanic routes are not affected by the FAA's ap
proval of the removal of life rafts from airliners flying
over stretches of water.
The airlines had asked for the exemptions of the life
raft requirements on certain overwater routes on
grounds that they could save fuel without the extra
weight of the life rafts and that the requirement was not
necessary for modern aircraft.
Costa Rica elects new president
San )ose, Costa Rica — As tiny Costa Rica, one of Latin
America's few civilian governments, elected an opposi

tion leader as its president, neighboring Nicaragua faced
mounting protests yesterday against the strong-arm rule
of President Anastasio Somoza.
Two other nearby Latin American nations, El Salvador
and Columbia, were troubled by peasant unrest or guer
rilla attacks.
With the vote count from Sunday's election in Costa
Rica nearing an end, opposition leader Rodrigo Carazo
has what political analysts say is an irreversible winning
edge. Carazo has more than 51 per cent of the vote as
compared to 46 per cent for his nearest challenger, Luis
Albert Monge of the ruling National Liberation Party.
The remainder was divided among six other candidates.
Humphrey takes oath as senator
Washington — Muriel Buck Humphrey took the oath
of office as U.S. senator yesterday and promised to help
pass the legislative program left behind at the death of
lier husband, Hubert.
She told reporters after the brief ceremony on the
Senate floor that she has not decided whether to seek
election in her own right in a special election to be held
10 months from now.
She said she will make that decision within two
months.
She inherits a legislative agenda that ranges from the
Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment bill to legislation
that would structure U.S. foreign aid and set policy and
create new programs in such fields as international
trade, agriculture, child nutrition, small business and
urban and rural development.
Japanese erect pyramid in Egypt
Cairo — Egyptian workers in flowing robes laid the
cornerstone yesterday of what will be a Japanese-built,

without life rafts on its 7275.
Transoceanic routes are not affected by the FAA's ap
proval of the removal of life rafts from airliners flying
over stretches of water.
The airlines had asked for the exemptions of the life
raft requirements on certain overwater routes on
grounds that they could save fuel without the extra
weight of the life rafts and that the requirement was not
necessary for modern aircraft.
Costa Rica elects new president
San )ose, Costa Rica — As tiny Costa Rica, one of Latin
America's few civilian governments, elected an opposi

tion leader as its president, neighboring Nicaragua faced
mounting protests yesterday against the strong-arm rule
of President Anastasio Somoza.
Two other nearby Latin American nations, El Salvador
and Columbia, were troubled by peasant unrest or guer
rilla attacks.
With the vote count from Sunday's election in Costa
Rica nearing an end, opposition leader Rodrigo Carazo
has what political analysts say is an irreversible winning
edge. Carazo has more than 51 per cent of the vote as
compared to 46 per cent for his nearest challenger, Luis
Albert Monge of the ruling National Liberation Party.
The remainder was divided among six other candidates.
Humphrey takes oath as senator
Washington — Muriel Buck Humphrey took the oath
of office as U.S. senator yesterday and promised to help
pass the legislative program left behind at the death of
lier husband, Hubert.
She told reporters after the brief ceremony on the
Senate floor that she has not decided whether to seek
election in her own right in a special election to be held
10 months from now.
She said she will make that decision within two
months.
She inherits a legislative agenda that ranges from the
Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment bill to legislation
that would structure U.S. foreign aid and set policy and
create new programs in such fields as international
trade, agriculture, child nutrition, small business and
urban and rural development.
Japanese erect pyramid in Egypt
Cairo — Egyptian workers in flowing robes laid the
cornerstone yesterday of what will be a Japanese-built,
36-foot-high pyramid, the first in the lanJ of the
pharaohs in nearly 4500 years.
Chanting "pray to the Prophet" as sand whipped their
faces, 20 workers strained at the ropes and moved a
one-ton limestone block into place. Nearly 3000 blocks,
some weighing 2.5 tons, will be needed.
The Nippon Television Network is sponsoring the pro
ject, estimated to cost about $1 million and involve
about 10,000 local workers.
Chinese 'Year of the Horse' begins
Hong Kong — The Year of the Horse replaced the Year
of the Snake at midnight last night and millions began
lunar New Year festivities here and in China, Vietnam,
Thailand, Korea, Burma and Taiwan.
The Chinese lunar calendar classifies 12 years as a
cycle and names them after animals in the following
order: rat, cow, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse,
goat, monkey, cock, dog and pig.
The Chinese consider the Year of the Horse to be
better than most years. Horses, they say, are spirited,
alert, obedient, loyal and hard-working, but others note
they also can be stubborn and unpredictable.
Dow Jones average slips 2.34
New York — The stock market gave ground in slow
trading yesterday in a session shortened by two hours at
New York exchanges because of a severe snowstorm.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had
struggled to a 6.84 gain last week, pulled back 2.34 to
768.62.
Volume on the Big Board totaled 11.63 million shares
in the four-hour session, against 19.40 million in the full
six-hour day last Friday.
Today's Weather
Periods of rain likely through tomorrow. Lows in
upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs both days in the upper 50s
and low 60s. Gale warning for gusty southerly winds
increasing to 20 to 35 mph this morning. Chance of rain
70 per cent today and 70 per cent tonight.
Sadat seeks pressure on Israel
Washington — Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said
yesterday that there could be peace in the Middle East
"in less than a week" if Israel agreed to return to its old
borders and make Jerusalem an open city.
But he foresaw little prospect of that unless the United
States exerted pressure on Israel.
So far, there has been no indication that Sadat has
persuaded President Jimmy Carter to lean harder on
Israel. A White House statement issued at the conclu
sion of Carter's weekend talks with Sadat at Camp David,
Md., said the U.S. role was that of a "friend of both
sides."
At the same time, though, the administration ap
peared to be nearing a decision to sell a squadron of F-5E
jets to Egypt.
"It is my belief he (Carter) is close to a decision," Sen.
Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.) said, "and I would like to see him
delay it."
Once Congress is formally notified, it has 30 days to
veto a weapons sale. Javits wants Congress to have the
chance to consider the proposal without a deadline.
Heavy snowfall cripples Northeast
New York — Heavy snow driven by high winds swept
through the Northeast yesterday, crippling road, rail and
air traffic and bringing business and government to a
near standstill for the second time in 17 days.
Offices closed early and workers struggled to fight
their way home. Snow emergencies were declared in
New York City, Baltimore and dozens of other cities and
towns throughout the region.
Governors Milton Shapp of Pennsylvania and J.
Joseph Garrahy of Rhode Island proclaimed states of
emergency, allowing them to call out National Guard
units to help stranded motorists and road-clearing
crews. Pennsylvania's Civil Defense headquarters was
activated.
The snow stretched from Washington through the
Middle Atlantic states and up into parts of New England.
Unlike last month's blizzard, which had not been pre
dicted, yesterday's storm had been forecast since early
in the weekend. But the impact did not seem to be
lessened by the advance warning.
The Midwest, still digging out from a blizzard that hit a
little more than a week ago, reported relatively few prob
lems yesterday, but the West Coast was suffering torren
tial rains. Five people in Southern California died Sun
day in traffic accidents caused by rain and mudslides,
and forecasters predicted heavy rain for Northern
California during the coming week.
Airlines discontinue use of life rafts
Miami — Three airlines have cut costs by removing life
rafts from passenger jets flying routes over stretches of
water. And the Federal Aviation Administration says at
least four other carriers have been told they can do the
same.
Braniff and National confirmed yesterday that life rafts
have been removed from their aircraft flying the Atlantic
coastal corridor linking Miami and the Northeast and
Gulf routes between South Florida and the West. Alaska
