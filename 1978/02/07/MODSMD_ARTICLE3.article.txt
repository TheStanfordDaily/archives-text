# The 						CIA: secrecy and books
## 
### Randy Keith 
The ClA's secrecy oath may not
provide enough basis for the agency
to prosecute former employees who
publish books exposing agency per
sonnel and operations, according to
the agency's public affairs director,
Herbert Hetu.
"That's one of the things we're try
ing to test right now, particularly for
instance in the Schnepp case," Hetu
said in an interview yesterday.
Every person hired by the agency
must sign an oath of secrecy includ
ing a section specifying that all
employees and former employees
must agree to show all material to be
published to the CIA before publica
tion.
Hetu contends that Schnepp viol
ated this oath when he published his
book, "A Decent Interval," which
detailed the ClA's actions as
Saigon fell in 1975.
Hetu said that Schnepp had agreed
"to meet with Adm. Turner (the CIA
director) before the book was even

finished, and promised in the com
pany of witnesses that he would
submit the book."
Schnepp never submitted the
book. Its publication was secret until
it was released last fall.
Hetu said that whether the oath
could be considered a contract has
"never been tested in court,"and
added, "it's a matter of honor.
There's some sort of personal moral
obligations, you either have personal
integrity or you don't."
He said the U.S. Justice Depart
ment has not decided whether to

prosecute Schnepp.
Hetu also said the CIA has placed
great emphasis on anti-terrorist intel
ligence gathering in the last few
years, and said despite the rise in ter
rorist action, the CIA has been "very
effective.
"I can't tell you about our succes
ses," he said. "We've been very suc
cessful on a number of occasions in
thwarting terrorist activity. The prob
lem is that I can't tell you where and
when and how because foreign
agents' covers would be blown.
"Our mission is to find out what is
going on and then nip it in the bud
before it happens," Hetu added.
