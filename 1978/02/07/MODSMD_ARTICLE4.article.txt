# Ronald Davis enters race for 12th district
## 
### Arlene Kishi 
Primary elections this November
will pose two Stanford alumni against
each other for the 12th Congres
sional District seat — incumbent
Rep. Paul McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo
Park) and Ronald Davis, a Palo Alto
Democrat.
McCloskey received a bachelor's
degree here in 1950 and a law degree
in 1953. Davis eceived his master's in
mathematics from Stanford in 1969.
Davis said he decided to run only
three weeks ago, reacting to "objec
tions within the district because Pete
wasn't listening to his constituents.
Now his political base is weaker and
the timing is better to unseat him.
"He has isolated many of his con
stituents because of his unrespon
siveness to their concerns," Davis
said. "He's a policy salesman trying
to sell them a certain point of view."
Panama Canal treaty
Davis cited the Panama Canal tre
aty, which McCloskey favors which
"most people in the district would
vote against," he said.
If faced with this type of conflict,
Davis said he would vote in accor
dance with his constituents
"whenever possible" and vote
against them "only if it were a ques
tion of personal ethics."
McCloskey represents a "maverick
branch" of the Republican Party,
Davis said. "A substantial segment of
the party both within the district and
nationally are fed up with his arro
gance," he added.
McCloskey is a principal spokes
person for the Panama Canal treaty,
which Davis opposes in its present
form.
Favors two revisions
"No treaty should put the U.S. in a
subordinate position," Davis argues.
He favors two revisions before ratifi
cation. One is a guarantee that the
United States could build another
canal in a different location, such as
Nicaragua. The second argument is
for the sale of the canal in which the
United States would get a "return on
its investment in the form of cash
flow from the tolls over a period of
time," he said.
Davis is a systems analyst for Con
trol Analysis Corporation. He at
tended Cubberley High School in
Palo Alto and graduated magna cum
laude from Harvard with a bachelor's
degree in applied mathematics.
Davis studied operations research
here under a National Science Foun
dation grant and received his mas
ter's degree in 1969.

Davis has been working on a doc
toral thesis on linear control theory
which is "about one month away
from completion," he said.
"It may never get done if I get
elected, or it may get done after the
election," he said.
Federal Reserve System
Over the past six years Davis has
also studied the Federal Reserve Sys
tem and is advocating reforms of the
system in his campaign. Davis said he
has formulated a plan that would
"substantially reduce both taxes and
inflation."
The plan, according to Davis,
would include an audit of the Federal
Reserve, formation of a national or
ganization of economists, political
scientists, businessmen, bankers to
promote monetary reform and even
tual conversion to the 100 per cent
reserve system advocated by
economists Milton Friedman and Irv
ing Fisher.
The Federal Reserve is part of the
"nucleus in the government power
structure," said Davis.
"I perceive a drift towards to
talitarianism, a trend that will con
tinue unless it's reversed," said
Davis.
"We are in danger of losing human
rights in this country," he added,
"and we need to establish popular
measures for government control
and government measures to control
bureaucracy."
Educational institutions
Davis said he believes educational
institutions "should be free of gov
ernment control and able to formu
late their own policies, educational
or otherwise." He said this."included
investment policy," but added that
he "wasn't prepared" to comment
on South Africa and the divestment
issue.
He added he wasn't prepared to
discuss the question of tuition tax
credit, but said "if forced to vote
now, I would vote for it."
Although Davis said he favors in
creases in job opportunities and
training for youth, he refused to
comment on the minimum wage.
Davis said he seeks "concrete sol
utions" to national problems and
favors "less emphasis on govern
ment spending to solve problems."
With U.S. dependence on foreign
energy sources at a "dangerously
high" level, Davis said he advocated
"aggressive development" of
domestic energy sources. He
suggested, at the same time, the
"promotion of new technology, in

addition to regulations, to minimize
the environmental effects of indus
try.
"I favor minimizing environmental
damage consistent with the healthy
growth of energy production," said
Davis, "and the two don't necessarily
have to conflict."
Davis said he advocates "freedom
of choice with drugs and medicines"
and added he will "pursue any inno
vations to reduce the cost of medical
care and improve the quality of ser
vice."
He said he would like to see elimi

nation of the electoral college system
because it "distorts the voting tally."
'Respect for the people'
Davis said his campaign themes in
clude "respect for the people" and
urging people to "stop looking to
Washington to solve problems."
Initial campaign funds to get on
the ballot will come from "small con
tributions" solicited door-to-door,
according to Davis. Major financing
is expected from the "national and
local Democratic parties, labor un
ions, and organizations which share
our issues and views," Davis added.

Although Davis said he favors in
creases in job opportunities and
training for youth, he refused to
comment on the minimum wage.
Davis said he seeks "concrete sol
utions" to national problems and
favors "less emphasis on govern
ment spending to solve problems."
With U.S. dependence on foreign
energy sources at a "dangerously
high" level, Davis said he advocated
"aggressive development" of
domestic energy sources. He
suggested, at the same time, the
"promotion of new technology, in

addition to regulations, to minimize
the environmental effects of indus
try.
"I favor minimizing environmental
damage consistent with the healthy
growth of energy production," said
Davis, "and the two don't necessarily
have to conflict."
Davis said he advocates "freedom
of choice with drugs and medicines"
and added he will "pursue any inno
vations to reduce the cost of medical
care and improve the quality of ser
vice."
He said he would like to see elimi

nation of the electoral college system
because it "distorts the voting tally."
'Respect for the people'
Davis said his campaign themes in
clude "respect for the people" and
urging people to "stop looking to
Washington to solve problems."
Initial campaign funds to get on
the ballot will come from "small con
tributions" solicited door-to-door,
according to Davis. Major financing
is expected from the "national and
local Democratic parties, labor un
ions, and organizations which share
our issues and views," Davis added.
Primary elections this November
will pose two Stanford alumni against
each other for the 12th Congres
sional District seat — incumbent
Rep. Paul McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo
Park) and Ronald Davis, a Palo Alto
Democrat.
McCloskey received a bachelor's
degree here in 1950 and a law degree
in 1953. Davis eceived his master's in
mathematics from Stanford in 1969.
Davis said he decided to run only
three weeks ago, reacting to "objec
tions within the district because Pete
wasn't listening to his constituents.
Now his political base is weaker and
the timing is better to unseat him.
"He has isolated many of his con
stituents because of his unrespon
siveness to their concerns," Davis
said. "He's a policy salesman trying
to sell them a certain point of view."
Panama Canal treaty
Davis cited the Panama Canal tre
aty, which McCloskey favors which
"most people in the district would
vote against," he said.
If faced with this type of conflict,
Davis said he would vote in accor
dance with his constituents
"whenever possible" and vote
against them "only if it were a ques
tion of personal ethics."
McCloskey represents a "maverick
branch" of the Republican Party,
Davis said. "A substantial segment of
the party both within the district and
nationally are fed up with his arro
gance," he added.
McCloskey is a principal spokes
person for the Panama Canal treaty,
which Davis opposes in its present
form.
Favors two revisions
"No treaty should put the U.S. in a
subordinate position," Davis argues.
He favors two revisions before ratifi
cation. One is a guarantee that the
United States could build another
canal in a different location, such as
Nicaragua. The second argument is
for the sale of the canal in which the
United States would get a "return on
its investment in the form of cash
flow from the tolls over a period of
time," he said.
Davis is a systems analyst for Con
trol Analysis Corporation. He at
tended Cubberley High School in
Palo Alto and graduated magna cum
laude from Harvard with a bachelor's
degree in applied mathematics.
Davis studied operations research
here under a National Science Foun
dation grant and received his mas
ter's degree in 1969.

Davis has been working on a doc
toral thesis on linear control theory
which is "about one month away
from completion," he said.
"It may never get done if I get
elected, or it may get done after the
election," he said.
Federal Reserve System
Over the past six years Davis has
also studied the Federal Reserve Sys
tem and is advocating reforms of the
system in his campaign. Davis said he
has formulated a plan that would
"substantially reduce both taxes and
inflation."
The plan, according to Davis,
would include an audit of the Federal
Reserve, formation of a national or
ganization of economists, political
scientists, businessmen, bankers to
promote monetary reform and even
tual conversion to the 100 per cent
reserve system advocated by
economists Milton Friedman and Irv
ing Fisher.
The Federal Reserve is part of the
"nucleus in the government power
structure," said Davis.
"I perceive a drift towards to
talitarianism, a trend that will con
tinue unless it's reversed," said
Davis.
"We are in danger of losing human
rights in this country," he added,
"and we need to establish popular
measures for government control
and government measures to control
bureaucracy."
Educational institutions
Davis said he believes educational
institutions "should be free of gov
ernment control and able to formu
late their own policies, educational
or otherwise." He said this."included
investment policy," but added that
he "wasn't prepared" to comment
on South Africa and the divestment
issue.
He added he wasn't prepared to
discuss the question of tuition tax
credit, but said "if forced to vote
now, I would vote for it."
Although Davis said he favors in

training for youth, he refused to
comment on the minimum wage.

elected, or it may get done after the
election," he said.
Federal Reserve System
Over the past six years Davis has
also studied the Federal Reserve Sys
tem and is advocating reforms of the
system in his campaign. Davis said he
has formulated a plan that would
"substantially reduce both taxes and
inflation."
The plan, according to Davis,
would include an audit of the Federal
Reserve, formation of a national or
ganization of economists, political
scientists, businessmen, bankers to
promote monetary reform and even
tual conversion to the 100 per cent
reserve system advocated by
economists Milton Friedman and Irv
ing Fisher.
The Federal Reserve is part of the
"nucleus in the government power
structure," said Davis.
"I perceive a drift towards to
talitarianism, a trend that will con
tinue unless it's reversed," said
Davis.
"We are in danger of losing human
rights in this country," he added,
"and we need to establish popular
measures for government control
and government measures to control
bureaucracy."
Educational institutions
Davis said he believes educational
institutions "should be free of gov
ernment control and able to formu
late their own policies, educational
or otherwise." He said this."included
investment policy," but added that
he "wasn't prepared" to comment
on South Africa and the divestment
issue.
He added he wasn't prepared to
discuss the question of tuition tax
credit, but said "if forced to vote
now, I would vote for it."
Although Davis said he favors in
creases in job opportunities and
training for youth, he refused to
comment on the minimum wage.
Davis said he seeks "concrete sol
utions" to national problems and
favors "less emphasis on govern
ment spending to solve problems."
With U.S. dependence on foreign
energy sources at a "dangerously
high" level, Davis said he advocated
"aggressive development" of
domestic energy sources. He
suggested, at the same time, the
"promotion of new technology, in

addition to regulations, to minimize
the environmental effects of indus
try.
"I favor minimizing environmental
damage consistent with the healthy
growth of energy production," said
Davis, "and the two don't necessarily
have to conflict."
Davis said he advocates "freedom
of choice with drugs and medicines"
and added he will "pursue any inno
vations to reduce the cost of medical
care and improve the quality of ser
vice."
He said he would like to see elimi

nation of the electoral college system
because it "distorts the voting tally."
'Respect for the people'
Davis said his campaign themes in
clude "respect for the people" and
urging people to "stop looking to
Washington to solve problems."
Initial campaign funds to get on
the ballot will come from "small con
tributions" solicited door-to-door,
according to Davis. Major financing
is expected from the "national and
local Democratic parties, labor un
ions, and organizations which share
our issues and views," Davis added.
