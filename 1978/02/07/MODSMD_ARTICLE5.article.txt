# The
						Farm: everyone wants a portion
## Varied pressures affect land use decisions 
### James Petrila News analysis 
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's
first president, was known to wax
eloquent over "this valley of Santa
Clara" with its unforgettable "two
mountain ranges overarched by a
soft blue Grecian sky."
Since Jordan's tenure, the once
pastoral Santa Clara Valley has
turned urban and suburban. In
fact, one of the region's few sig
nificant parcels of land that has
not been overwhelmed entirely
by the Bay Area's post-World War
II growth is that bequeathed by
Leland Stanford to the University.
This is not to say that Stanford,
which holds enough land to cover
two-thirds of Manhattan Island,
has remained free of pressure
from outside forces with various
ideas on how best to use Stan
ford's land. Quite the opposite
has been the case.
The original endowment which
gave the University more than
8800 acres has been reduced by
some 700 acres through condem
nation, nearly all of it in the last
two decades. The construction of
Interstate Highway 280 required
225 acres of Stanford land, the
Veterans Administration Hospital
took 87, and the city of San Fran
cisco condemned 80 more for the
Hetch-Hetchy water line right of
way.
In recent years, Menlo Park has
turned its eyes without success on
a large tract it wished to turn intoa
golf course, and the Army Corps

of Engineers had grandiose plans,
unrealized, for a flood control
project that would have used
acres of Stanford's land.
The problem that faces Univer
sity planners is how to make the
best use of the remaining land.
According to John Breedlove,
manager of land resources, Uni
versity land-use policy operates
under guidelines established by
the trustees in 1974.
That document states "the pur
pose of the Stanford land en
dowment is to provide adequate
land, on a continually renewing
basis, for facilities and space for
the instructional and research ac
tivities of the University."
Breedlove added "we consider
Stanford's land to be an academic
resource rather than a financial
one."
Emphasis is now on preserva
tion rather than development; it
was not always this way. Since Var
ian Associates was given a 10 acre
lease for a research and engineer
ing plant in 1951, land has been
leased to numerous firms in the
Stanford Industrial Park, the Stan
ford Shopping Center has
flourished, the Oak Creek apart
ments have been built, and the
"faculty ghetto" has been de
veloped.
Various pressures resulted in
the development of these sec
tions of Stanford's land holdings.
Increasing property taxes could
not be covered by income gained
