# The 						Farm: everyone wants a portion
## Varied pressures affect land use decisions 
### James Petrila News analysis 
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's
first president, was known to wax
eloquent over "this valley of Santa
Clara" with its unforgettable "two
mountain ranges overarched by a
soft blue Grecian sky."
Since Jordan's tenure, the once
pastoral Santa Clara Valley has
turned urban and suburban. In
fact, one of the region's few sig
nificant parcels of land that has
not been overwhelmed entirely
by the Bay Area's post-World War
II growth is that bequeathed by
Leland Stanford to the University.
This is not to say that Stanford,
which holds enough land to cover
two-thirds of Manhattan Island,
has remained free of pressure
from outside forces with various
ideas on how best to use Stan
ford's land. Quite the opposite
has been the case.
The original endowment which
gave the University more than
8800 acres has been reduced by
some 700 acres through condem
nation, nearly all of it in the last
two decades. The construction of
Interstate Highway 280 required
225 acres of Stanford land, the
Veterans Administration Hospital
took 87, and the city of San Fran
cisco condemned 80 more for the
Hetch-Hetchy water line right of
way.
In recent years, Menlo Park has
turned its eyes without success on
a large tract it wished to turn intoa
golf course, and the Army Corps

of Engineers had grandiose plans,
unrealized, for a flood control
project that would have used
acres of Stanford's land.
The problem that faces Univer
sity planners is how to make the
best use of the remaining land.
According to John Breedlove,
manager of land resources, Uni
versity land-use policy operates
under guidelines established by
the trustees in 1974.
That document states "the pur
pose of the Stanford land en
dowment is to provide adequate
land, on a continually renewing
basis, for facilities and space for
the instructional and research ac
tivities of the University."
Breedlove added "we consider
Stanford's land to be an academic
resource rather than a financial
one."
Emphasis is now on preserva
tion rather than development; it
was not always this way. Since Var
ian Associates was given a 10 acre
lease for a research and engineer
ing plant in 1951, land has been
leased to numerous firms in the
Stanford Industrial Park, the Stan
ford Shopping Center has
flourished, the Oak Creek apart
ments have been built, and the
"faculty ghetto" has been de
veloped.
Various pressures resulted in
the development of these sec
tions of Stanford's land holdings.

through renting the land for ag
ricultural purposes, and the land
was becoming a financial liability.
The trustees decided to lease
portions of the land to pay taxes
and generate revenue for
academic programs. Selling land
for development was never an op
tion, since terms of the be
queathmenl prohibited sale of the
land.
In addition to internal pressures
for the need to generate funds,
there was some pressure for de
velopment from the city of Palo
Alto, according to Breedlove.
Stanford was encouraged to de
velop the land in part as a means
of increasing Palo Alto's tax base.
Both Stanford and Palo Alto
continue to benefit from this ar
rangement. In the initial years,
Stanford earned a substantial part
of its $7 million operating budget

from land development. In 1960,
earnings topped $1 million for the
first time. In addition, property
taxes on the leased lands are paid
by the lessees.
Palo Alto annexed the areas
which were developed, with the
exception of the "faculty ghetto,"
enabling the city to collect prop
erty tax revenue and utility re
venues which were more than $15
million last year. University lands
thus generate nearly one-third of
Palo Alto's revenue.
As land has become less plenti
ful, pressures have grown to keep
the land undeveloped. In addi
tion, during the late '60s and early
'70s various interest groups at
tempted to force Stanford to use
some of the land for such things as
low income housing.
Breedlove said the housing
issue is still a prominent one.
Stanford "feels no social obliga

tion to provide housing for citi
zens of surrounding com
munities," Breedlove said. He
added the Oak Creek addition on
Willow Road will be undertaken
"not from an obligation to solve
local community housing needs,
but provide housing first for Stan
ford students, faculty and staff,
and hopefully, others as well."
Since the proposed area for the
1000-1500 units has already been
annexed to Palo Alto, the Univer
sity has every intention of provid
ing some units for low and mod
erate incomes, as required by Palo
Alto ordinances, Breedlove said.
Nearly three-fourths of Stan
ford's land has been placed in
academic reserve. The cost of
keeping this land undeveloped is
$150,000 per year in real estate
taxes, "a reasonable price to pay
for continued flexibility," Breed
love said

Leland Stanford to the University.
This is not to say that Stanford,
which holds enough land to cover
two-thirds of Manhattan Island,
has remained free of pressure
from outside forces with various
ideas on how best to use Stan
ford's land. Quite the opposite
has been the case.
The original endowment which
gave the University more than
8800 acres has been reduced by
some 700 acres through condem
nation, nearly all of it in the last
two decades. The construction of
Interstate Highway 280 required
225 acres of Stanford land, the
Veterans Administration Hospital
took 87, and the city of San Fran
cisco condemned 80 more for the
Hetch-Hetchy water line right of
way.
In recent years, Menlo Park has
turned its eyes without success on
a large tract it wished to turn intoa
golf course, and the Army Corps

of Engineers had grandiose plans,
unrealized, for a flood control
project that would have used
acres of Stanford's land.
The problem that faces Univer
sity planners is how to make the
best use of the remaining land.
According to John Breedlove,
manager of land resources, Uni
versity land-use policy operates
under guidelines established by
the trustees in 1974.
That document states "the pur
pose of the Stanford land en
dowment is to provide adequate
land, on a continually renewing
basis, for facilities and space for
the instructional and research ac
tivities of the University."
Breedlove added "we consider
Stanford's land to be an academic
resource rather than a financial
one."
Emphasis is now on preserva
tion rather than development; it
was not always this way. Since Var
ian Associates was given a 10 acre
lease for a research and engineer
ing plant in 1951, land has been
leased to numerous firms in the
Stanford Industrial Park, the Stan
ford Shopping Center has
flourished, the Oak Creek apart
ments have been built, and the
"faculty ghetto" has been de
veloped.
Various pressures resulted in
the development of these sec
tions of Stanford's land holdings.
Increasing property taxes could

through renting the land for ag
ricultural purposes, and the land
was becoming a financial liability.
The trustees decided to lease
portions of the land to pay taxes
and generate revenue for
academic programs. Selling land
for development was never an op
tion, since terms of the be
queathmenl prohibited sale of the
land.
In addition to internal pressures
for the need to generate funds,
there was some pressure for de
velopment from the city of Palo
Alto, according to Breedlove.
Stanford was encouraged to de
velop the land in part as a means
of increasing Palo Alto's tax base.
Both Stanford and Palo Alto
continue to benefit from this ar
rangement. In the initial years,
Stanford earned a substantial part
of its $7 million operating budget

from land development. In 1960,
earnings topped $1 million for the
first time. In addition, property
taxes on the leased lands are paid
by the lessees.
Palo Alto annexed the areas
which were developed, with the
exception of the "faculty ghetto,"
enabling the city to collect prop
erty tax revenue and utility re
venues which were more than $15
million last year. University lands
thus generate nearly one-third of
Palo Alto's revenue.
As land has become less plenti
ful, pressures have grown to keep
the land undeveloped. In addi
tion, during the late '60s and early
'70s various interest groups at
tempted to force Stanford to use
some of the land for such things as
low income housing.
Breedlove said the housing
issue is still a prominent one.
Stanford "feels no social obliga

tion to provide housing for citi
zens of surrounding com
munities," Breedlove said. He
added the Oak Creek addition on
Willow Road will be undertaken
"not from an obligation to solve
local community housing needs,
but provide housing first for Stan
ford students, faculty and staff,
and hopefully, others as well."
Since the proposed area for the
1000-1500 units has already been
annexed to Palo Alto, the Univer
sity has every intention of provid
ing some units for low and mod
erate incomes, as required by Palo
Alto ordinances, Breedlove said.
Nearly three-fourths of Stan
ford's land has been placed in
academic reserve. The cost of
keeping this land undeveloped is
$150,000 per year in real estate
taxes, "a reasonable price to pay
for continued flexibility," Breed
love said
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's
first president, was known to wax
eloquent over "this valley of Santa
Clara" with its unforgettable "two
mountain ranges overarched by a
soft blue Grecian sky."
Since Jordan's tenure, the once
pastoral Santa Clara Valley has
turned urban and suburban. In
fact, one of the region's few sig
nificant parcels of land that has
not been overwhelmed entirely
by the Bay Area's post-World War
II growth is that bequeathed by
Leland Stanford to the University.
