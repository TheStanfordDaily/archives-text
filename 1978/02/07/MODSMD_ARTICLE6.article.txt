# ASSU actions assessed

Beginning the year in the midst of a
significant scandal, the ASSU Senate
has charted a course somewhere be
tween the mediocre and the abo
minable. This may change, but it is
not likely to.
However, there have been a
number of positive, constructive
pieces of legislation, especially ear
lier in the year, these are:
—Creation of a task force on rape
prevention and the establishment of
a rape crisis center. This bill, prop

osed by Meriel Burtle, Fred Crethel
and Lynn Rubinett also mandated re
search into the attitudes towards
rape victims, and will attempt to im
prove communication on the sub
ject.
—Creation of two task forces to
investigate the operations of the
Bookstore and Tresidder. There have
been a lot of complaints about the
prices of these two concerns, and the
senatorial efforts in investigating
them seem worthwhile.
—Beginning to institute some long
term planning for the ASSU. This is in
reaction to substantial increases in
the senate discretionary funds, plan
ned expenditures that may perma
nently imbalance the ASSU budget,
and possible withdrawal of the ASSU
trust fund out of university "merged
pool B." The administration appa
rently saw fit to approve the senate
budget, unless such long term plan
ning was instituted. While the ad
ministration interference (although
constitutional) is irritating, it did
prompt a measure long overdue.
Three bills dealing with communi
cation were also quite positive.
These bills, by David Catanzarite and
Ken Nunn respectively proposed:
—An "outreach" program to have
senate members go out in terms to
'invade" a dorm and extract opin
ions from the residents.
—The establishment of a weekly
senate column in the Daily where all
senators could take turns speaking to
students. Parenthetically, while a
good idea, I wonder why senators
could not do this individually on
their own? The bill's implementation
is taking forever.
—The establishment of an R.A.
network to efficiently and quickly
poll or inform students of senate ac
tivities.
The timely bill by Tom McCormack
calling for the Board of Trustees to

rescind the ban on sororities, shortly
before the trustee committee de
cided to do just that. Fortunately, a
Stanford Organizing Committee
(SOC) sponsored motion to amend
the bill to ban fraternities was av
erted.
Perhaps less positive, but in my
opinion still constructive, was a bill
by Rubinett, Crethel and Rich Levy
for increasing restrictions on obtain
ing an abortion.
At the risk of being presumptious,
or immodest at the least, may I in
clude two proposals by myself, both
as yet unrealized.
First, in accordance with a cam
paign promise, I introduced the first
step in my proposal for a low-rate
long distance (WATS) phone service
for students. This is currently bogged
down in committee for various ab
surd reasons to be explained later.
This is unfortunate, as the proposal
seems increasingly feasible and de
sirable.
Second, I have introduced a con
stitutional amendment, hopefully to
be voted on this spring, that would
prevent domination of the ASSU Se
nate by large slates. In effect it would
prevent relatively small groups (of
about 500 students) from obtaining
overwhelming majorities on the Se
nate by block voting. However, it
should allow strong minority {both
ethnic and ideological) representa
tion.
The final positive remark to be
made about the senate so far con
cerns the chairperson. Grethel has
become one of the most respected
people involved with ASSU, and jus
tifiably so. He has applied tact, wit
and fairness to his job and that de
mands admiration.
