# Nuclear energy guarded?

Randall Schutt

In June 1976, just before the Nuc
lear Safeguard Initiative was de
feated, the state legislature passed
three nuclear safeguard measures.
These measures were not as strin
gent as the initiative, but they did
demand that two important condi
tions be met before any new nuclear
power plants could be approved for
construction.
First, that there is means to safely
store the radioactive waste material
from the plants for the several
thousand years that it takes for the
wastes to decay to a safe level. Sec
ond, that there are facilities for re
processing the wastes to extract the
unburned uranium for re-use.
Neither of these conditions has yet
been met in spite of many years of
development and numerous prom
ises of solutions "just around the
corner."
Even though these conditions
can't be met, a new nuclear plant cal
led Sundesert has been proposed for
construction 16 miles from Blythe
near the Arizona border. In order to
circumvent the safeguard measures
and allow Sundesert to be built, a
special bill, SB 1015, has been put
forward to exempt the plant.
Because of the controversy sur
rounding this plant, the State Energy
Commission was directed to make a
thorough study of Sundesert includ
ing energy needs, economic factors,
and alternative sources. Just a few
weeks ago the commission issued
the recommendation that Sundesert
not be exempted from the safeguard
measures. In the accompanying re
port on alternatives, they stated that
with a few simple conservation mea
sures and power pooling of southern
California utilities' reserve generat
ing capacity, no new generating
plants Would be needed until at least
1989. And they cited four alternative
power sources that are now com
mercially feasible and three that
would be so by the 1980s, including
combined cycle oil facilities, con
generation, and geothermal.
In spite of this recommendation,
the state senate went ahead and pas
sed SB 1015 and sent it on to the As
sembly. The Assembly Committee
on Resources, Land Use, and Energy,
chaired by Victor Calvo (D-Mountain
View), will now consider the bill be
fore it goes to the full Assembly.
Hopefully, the bill will die in commit
tee, but it may not. San Diego Gas &
Electric has already spent $100 mill
ion just to design the plant, and they
are lobbying heavily for its exemp
tion. Whenever nuclear power is
being considered, the impossible
and the unreasonable manage to
occur quite frequently.
