Wednesday, Feb. 15 marks the
birthday of one of the great radicals
in American history, Susan B. An
thony.
Born in 1820, this daughter of
Quaker parents went on to become
one of the foremost leaders of her
time. Taking to heart the Quaker be
lief that all people — black as well as
white, female as well as male — were
created equal in the eyes of Cod. An
thony never let the nation forget it.
From 1856 to 1960 she worked in New
York for the American Antislavery
Society, suffering the wrath of mobs
when she spoke publicly in favor of
abolitionism. But it was in the wo
men's rights movement that Anthony
was to gain her greatest fame and
achieve her greatest accomplish
ments, forever changing the course
of American history.
Perhaps the highlight of Anthony's
life — and a milestone in the wo
men's suffrage movement as well —
occurred in 1873 when she was tried
and found guilty for voting in the
1872 national election. As in many
other political trials, judge and pro
secutor alike attempted to keep the
real issues from surfacing in the
courtroom. Thanks to Anthony's
persistence, however, surface they
did in a memorable statement al
lowed her before sentencing was
pronounced.
Anthony's trial was held in Canan
daigua, New York ir. June 1873. Dur
ing the months preceding the case,
she gave over 50 speeches in upstate
New York, charging that the Four
teenth Amendment enfranchised

women. The stage was thus set for a
political trial of high drama, and the
nation was not disappointed.
Supreme Court justice Ward Hunt
presided over the courtroom and re
fused to let Anthony say a single
word in her own defense, ruling that
she was incompetent as a witness.
He refused to let her lawyer enter the
Fourteenth Amendment in evidence
to support her case. When Anthony
requested that she be allowed to act
as her own attorney so that she could
speak directly to the jury, the judge
refused to let her do that as well.
Then, in an unheard-of action, he
ordered the jury to find her guilty.
Finally, however, Anthony was
permitted to speak, when the judge
asked her if she had anything to say
before sentencing. Anthony deli
vered a scathing attack: "Yes, your
honor, I have many things to say; for
in your ordered verdict of guilty, you
have trampled under foot every vital
principle of our government. My
natural rights, my civil rights, my
political rights, my judicial rights are
all alike ignored. Robbed of the fun
damental privilege of citizenship, I
am degraded from the status of citi
zen to that of a subject; and not only
myself individually but all my sex are,
by your honor's verdict, doomed to
political subjection under this so
called republican form of govern
ment."
"The Court cannot allow the pris
oner to go on," the judge declared,

but the defendant would not be si
lenced: "But your honor will not
deny me this one and only poor
privilege of protest against this
high-handed outrage upon my citi
zen's rights."
Again the judge interrupted: "The
Court must insist — the prisoner has
been tried according to the estab
lished forms of law."
Again the defendant answered:
"Yes, your honor, but by forms of
law all made by men, interpreted by
men, administered by men, in favor
of men against women."
Finally the judge imposed sen
tence: $100. The suffragist would not
be initimidated: "I shall earnestly
and persistently continue to urge all
women to the practical recognition
of the old revolutionary maxim, 'Re
sistance to tyranny is obedience to
Cod.' " She never paid a cent.
Anthony gained political victory in
judicial defeat, for the blatant rep
ression of her trial aroused sympathy
and support throughout the land for
the right of women to vote. By carry
ing the battle for equality into the
traditional American arena, thecour
troom, Anthony had pushed forward
a struggle that was to culminate a
half-century later in the Nineteenth
Amendment and to have repercus
sions down to the present day.

courtroom. Thanks to Anthony's
persistence, however, surface they
did in a memorable statement al
lowed her before sentencing was
pronounced.
Anthony's trial was held in Canan
daigua, New York ir. June 1873. Dur
ing the months preceding the case,
she gave over 50 speeches in upstate
New York, charging that the Four
teenth Amendment enfranchised

women. The stage was thus set for a
political trial of high drama, and the
nation was not disappointed.
Supreme Court justice Ward Hunt
presided over the courtroom and re
fused to let Anthony say a single
word in her own defense, ruling that
she was incompetent as a witness.
He refused to let her lawyer enter the
Fourteenth Amendment in evidence
to support her case. When Anthony
requested that she be allowed to act
as her own attorney so that she could
speak directly to the jury, the judge
refused to let her do that as well.
Then, in an unheard-of action, he
ordered the jury to find her guilty.
Finally, however, Anthony was
permitted to speak, when the judge
asked her if she had anything to say
before sentencing. Anthony deli
vered a scathing attack: "Yes, your
honor, I have many things to say; for
in your ordered verdict of guilty, you
have trampled under foot every vital
principle of our government. My
natural rights, my civil rights, my
political rights, my judicial rights are
all alike ignored. Robbed of the fun
damental privilege of citizenship, I
am degraded from the status of citi
zen to that of a subject; and not only
myself individually but all my sex are,
by your honor's verdict, doomed to
political subjection under this so
called republican form of govern
ment."
"The Court cannot allow the pris
oner to go on," the judge declared,

but the defendant would not be si
lenced: "But your honor will not
deny me this one and only poor
privilege of protest against this
high-handed outrage upon my citi
zen's rights."
Again the judge interrupted: "The
Court must insist — the prisoner has
been tried according to the estab
lished forms of law."
Again the defendant answered:
"Yes, your honor, but by forms of
law all made by men, interpreted by
men, administered by men, in favor
of men against women."
Finally the judge imposed sen
tence: $100. The suffragist would not
be initimidated: "I shall earnestly
and persistently continue to urge all
women to the practical recognition
of the old revolutionary maxim, 'Re
sistance to tyranny is obedience to
Cod.' " She never paid a cent.
Anthony gained political victory in
judicial defeat, for the blatant rep
ression of her trial aroused sympathy
and support throughout the land for
the right of women to vote. By carry
ing the battle for equality into the
traditional American arena, thecour
troom, Anthony had pushed forward
a struggle that was to culminate a
half-century later in the Nineteenth
Amendment and to have repercus
sions down to the present day.

Wednesday, Feb. 15 marks the
birthday of one of the great radicals
in American history, Susan B. An
thony.
Born in 1820, this daughter of
Quaker parents went on to become
one of the foremost leaders of her
time. Taking to heart the Quaker be
lief that all people — black as well as
white, female as well as male — were
created equal in the eyes of Cod. An
thony never let the nation forget it.
From 1856 to 1960 she worked in New
York for the American Antislavery
Society, suffering the wrath of mobs
when she spoke publicly in favor of
abolitionism. But it was in the wo
men's rights movement that Anthony
was to gain her greatest fame and
achieve her greatest accomplish
ments, forever changing the course
of American history.
Perhaps the highlight of Anthony's
life — and a milestone in the wo
men's suffrage movement as well —
occurred in 1873 when she was tried
and found guilty for voting in the
1872 national election. As in many
other political trials, judge and pro
secutor alike attempted to keep the
real issues from surfacing in the
courtroom. Thanks to Anthony's
persistence, however, surface they
did in a memorable statement al
