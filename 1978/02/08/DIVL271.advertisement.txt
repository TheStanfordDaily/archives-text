LOOKING FOR A
PLACE TO BEGIN?
Maybe you should look into Peace Corps and VISTA.
Peace Corps and VISTA volunteers are people pretty
much like you. People with commitment and skills
who have assessed their lives and decided there
must be more to life than just holding down a job.
The problems our volunteers deal with both overseas
and here at home aren't new. Such as the cycle of
poverty that traps one generation after another be
cause they're too busy just holding on to get ahead.
The debilitating effects of malnutrition and disease.
Education that's either too little or none. Skills that are
lacking and the means to get them, too.
Your college training qualifies you to handle more of
these problems than you might think. Such as teach
ing nutrition and health practices. Organizing com
munities to work on problems ranging from neighbor
hood stop signs to utility rates and tax reforms. Advis
ing small business. Introducing better agricultural
techniques. Building classrooms and roads or work
ing on reforestation programs. The number of jobs to
do is nearly as great as the number of volunteers who
have served since 1961; over 150,000.
The pay is nothing to write home about, but there's
one thing we CAN promise you. There will be plenty
to write home about.
Look into the Peace Corps and VISTA. There's no
better place to begin.
