# Bicycle accidents increase
## 
### Emily Sachar 
In January of this year, six bike ac
cidents involving cars and seven bike
mishaps occurring off the roadways
have been reported to the Stanford
Police Department, according to De
tective Carl Gielitz.
All six accidents involving autos
took place when the cyclists were
crossing Campus Drive.
"I have no idea how this compares
to a comparable period last year be
cause I just logging these ac
cidents last November," Cielitz said.
Between Nov. 6 and Dec. 31, six
motor vehicle-bike accidents were
reported, along with six
emergency-medicals. An emergency
medical is any kind of accident not
involving a crime or a motor vehicle,
according to Gielitz.
"If an individual falls down the
stairs in a dorm and medics are called
in to look at the individual, we call
the event an emergency medical,"
Gielitz said.
"Similarly, any bike accident off
the roadway in which a person or
persons fall off bikes can be termed
an emergency medical," he added.
Gielitz partly attributes the large
number of bike accidents to rain. He
also claims many bicyclists are not
observing the rules and regulations
of the vehicle code when they ride in
the streets.
"Many riders run stop signs and
this creates a large number of acci
dents. People just don't pay atten
tion to where they're going," Gielitz
said.
"But we've had a lot of people
showing concern about the acci
dents and so we're going to try to
find out if there's any kind of a pat
tern," Gielitz said.
By logging bike accidents, Gielitz
hopes to accumulate statistics which
will reveal the places and times most
conducive to bike accidents.
"Then we'll be able to decide
whether we should be cracking
down on the drivers or the riders.
Bicyclists don't have protection
against cars. And oftentimes pedest
rians don't have protection against
bikes," Gielitz said.

There were 13 accidents reported on campus during January which involved
bicycles, according to police detective Carl Gielitz. He said the large number of
accidents was due to recent rain and to bike riders who ignore the traffic laws.
