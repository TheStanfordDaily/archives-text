# Serving as individuals
## Meet new CIR members 
### 
Burrus, Goldman, Johnson

Recognizing the importance of the
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR) and the controversy in
volving our selections as nominees
to the CIR, we feel it is important to
inform the Stanford community of
the process used, our reflections on
the nomination meeting itself, and
our perceived relationship with the
ASSU.
While of course the people in
volved in the selection process had
their own reasons for participating,
there was mutual agreement that the
need for student input on the CIR
outweighed the disadvantages of
temporarily foregoing the traditional
representative selection process.
Our major concerns were that any
uciion on our part would be con
strued as circumventing the ASSU
and/or interpreted as implicit ap
proval of the University Trustees' in
vestment policy guidelines.

We do not see ourselves, or intend
to be, a circumvention of the ASSU
Senate, but rather an alternative to
insure some mode of student input
on the CIR following the Senate's
denial to nominate candidates.
We strongly prefer a representa
tive selection process and want to
emphasize the fact that we are serv
ing merely as individual studentsand
not representatives of the student
body. Nevertheless, we desire to
have open communications with the
ASSU and intend to report on CIR
activities to the student body.
Judgment deferred
Nor do we feel that our acjions are
implicit approval of the Trustees' in
vestment policy. The language in the
policy statement is sufficiently broad
to allow for significant participation
by the CIR. Whether the implemen
tation of the policy will reflect such a
broad interpretation of the language
is unclear at this time.
Therefore, we defer judgment on
this matter until the extent of CIR
powers are determined. Similarly,
we defer judgment on whether the
student component of the CIR will
have an effective voice in the com
missions' decisions until we gain ex
perience as CIR members.
Nevertheless, we join the CIR op
timistically and enthusiastically look
forward to working on the CIR with
our fellow commission members.
Process outlined
The internal procedures of our
decision-making process may be of
interest to the Stanford community.
Once the group that was originally
contacted by Dean Lyons and As
sociate Dean Williams assembled at
Tresidder Saturday morning, the 14
of us (including two alternates), pro
ceeded independently without any
guidelines established by the ad
ministration.
To establish an organizational
structure for the meeting a chairper
son was selected to preside over dis
cussions. The initial decision in
cluded the two alternates as equal
participants in all deliberations and
as potential nominees to the CIR.
It was felt that to exclude two stu
dents selected as randomly as the
first 12 would be illogical. Future de-

cisions were made by majority vote
except in the case of the nominating
committee's official statement which
was felt to require unanimous ap
proval. All decisions were made fol
lowing lengthy discussions, if
needed, in which each individual
was given the opportunity to explain
his/her viewpoint.
Ironically, the selection of the
three nominees and two alternates
chosen by the 14 student participants
required less than the final one half
hour of the eight hour meeting. The
bulk of the time was spent discussing
the merits and ramifications of the
committee's actions.
Concern unexpected
When we were called to partici
pate in the nominating process we
had our own preconceptions of what
would transpire in a meeting as un
ique as Saturday's. None of us how
ever, expected the thoroughness
and concern that was shown for is
sues outside the committee's in
tended responsibility of selecting
nominees to the CIR.
Given the unusual nature of this
meeting, we feel that it would have
been difficult to exceed the amount
of interest and degree of thought
given to the issues discussed. We
hope that our performance in the fu
ture as members of the CIR will re
flect the high caliber of Saturday's
decision-making process.
