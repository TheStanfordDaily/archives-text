# Rafting dangerous but fun
## 
### Nancy Rivenburgh 
The raft glides down river between tall firs
offering candid views of watering deer and
beavers on rocks — views of wilderness not
often seen, a tranquility not often felt.
Anticipation invades the calm as the raft
moves faster with the current. Soon cries of
rushing whitewater permeate the air and the
river takes on a new menacing character.
Entering the main channel, the raft thrusts
forward into churning, swirling whiteness.
Strength and alertness must guide the raft
through frothy waves and spray — ferrying left
to sweep by rocks, throwing weight forward
over holes.
Up and down over wild, tossing rapids the raft
is worked madly toward the inside of a sharp
bend to avoid being snapped out of control —
and then around. Suddenly all is calm again.
Only the thrill of conquest remains.
Wilderness
River rafting has grown in popularity in recent
years. Adventurous people drawn to the seren
ity of wilderness and the challenge of whitewa
ter are riding the rivers.
Rafting requires less skill than canoeing or
kayaking as rafts are more difficult to overturn
because of their flexible nature.
Many novices' first trips are taken with com
mercial outfitters because they introduce the
techniques of rafting and safer ways to run more
challenging rivers.
Outfitted trips run anywhere from one to 21
days at relatively expensive prices. The most
common trips are four to five days for about
$400.
Do-it-yourself
The alternative to this is do-it-yourself rafting.
Although private rafting is less expensive, it can
be dangerous and requires good equipment
and basic knowledge.
)ames Koons, a five-year veteran guide for
Sundance Expeditions in Oregon, stresses raft

ing safety. He said that too often inexperienced
rafters think, "I've seen Deliverance' — all I
need is a boat." Such rafters end up buying a
cheap "rubber ducky" which is not maneuvera
ble and is easily destroyed or lost in difficult
rapids, Koons said.
As good quality rafts are both expensive and
difficult to rent, Koons suggested going through
school or wilderness clubs, or accompanying
equipped, experienced rafters. This is the way
to run rivers safely and avoid outfitter prices.
Informative
When deciding to raft one should contact the
National Park or Forest Service near the river to
obtain current water level and grade (difficulty)
of the river, topographic maps and a river per
mit, if required.
No two rivers are the same and the condition
of each river changes several times during the
year.
California offers a variety of good rafting riv
ers including the American, Fel, Klamath, Sac
ramento, Stanislaus and Tuolumne rivers.
Safety
To thoroughly enjoy the challenge of running
river rapids certain safety rules need to be fol
lowed:
—Familiarize yourself with the water, scout
ing rapids by foot if necessary.
—Do not raft in bad weather or low visibility.
—Be prepared for cold river conditions.
—Do not raft alone.
—Know basic paddling and oar techniques.
—Be confident of your swimming ability.
—Always wear a full life preserver.
—Don't overload the raft with people or
equipment.
—Don't be overconfident.
—Have all the proper equipment: throw
lines, bailers, air pump, repair kit, first aid and
survival kits, life preservers and soft-edged
watertight containers.
