# Aggies upend women, 61-54
## 
### Sukie Jackson 
First, the UC-Davis women's
basketball team beat Stanford
at a preseason tournament.
Then, at Stanford, the Cards
defeated the Aggies. Last
night, in the two teams' third
match of the season, Davis
came out on top again, 61-54.
The non-conference loss
dropped the Card's overall re
cord to 12-7.
The quicker and sharper
Davis team led nearly the
whole game, but Stanford pul
led within three points in the
second half. Center Maggie
Nelson fouled out with seven
minutes left in the game,
though, and the Cards couldn't
catch up to the Aggies. "Our
defense broke down which is
our strength," assistant coach
Sue Rojcewicz said.
Although Stanford out
rebounded Davis, the Cards
shot a cold 29 per cent for the
evening compared to the Ag
gies'4s per cent from the field.
Leading Davis was Theresa
Cardinet who made seven of 15
from the field and two of five

from the line for 16 points.
For the Cards, freshman
Kathy Murphy scored 13 points
and pulled down 16 rebounds.
But Davis' two-three defense
held leading scorer Maggie
Nelson to 10 points and 12 re
bounds and guards Betsy
Lough and Beth Boylan to eight
points each.
In its next home game, Stan
ford will have to shoot better
than 29 per cent. It faces UCLA,
a team ranked eighth in the
country in women's basketball
by Sports Illustrated. Led by
Ann Meyers, sister of present
NBA player and former UCLA
star Dave Meyers, the Bruins
will challenge the Cards Satur
day night at 5:45 in Maples
Pavilion.
