## Women gymnasts face Spartans 
### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's women gymnasts
travel to San lose for a North
ern California Athletic Confer
ence dual meet at 6 to
night. The Spartans outscored
the Cardinals 124.05 to 110.40
in Maples Pavilion Jan. 20, the
last time the two teams met.
Although Stanford brings an
improved squad to the re
match, injuries will lessen its
chances against the strong host
gymnasts.
"We're going to compete
just about like we did Saturday
for the same reason — with
Dana (Padden) and Sam
(Muramatsu) still injured,"
explained head coach Jackie
Walker.
"Sam's not going to do vault
ing and she will do a modified
floor exercise routine. Dana
will definitely go on bars. I en
tered her in all events but I may
scratch her — we'll see how it
(her ankle) feels tomorrow.
"I know that even at full
strength San jose is a better
team, so I'm not worried about

winning or losing. We're just
going to try to clean up the per
formances and do our best,"
she added.
The Spartans' top com
petitors, Cathy Santa Lucia and
Kris Klepfer, are favored in all
around competition, but Pad
den should place in the top
three, provided her injury im
proves before the meet.
Muramatsu has the strength
and form to win the three
events that she's entered in,
but the floor exercise routine
lacks her usual difficult moves.
"I hope that San Jose does
even better tomorrow because
I want them to qualify for reg
ional so we'll have a represen
tative from our conference,"
Walker said. The Spartans
need four more points than
their 124 total last month to
qualify.
The Cardinals go into to
night's meet following their
improved performance Satur
day. "Overall our vaulting was
very good (last Saturday). We
were first in vaulting in the

meet as a team even without
Sam," Walker said.
Cindy Sedlund and
Muramatsu "were the only two
gymnasts in the meet that
stayed on the beam" according
to Walker. "That's something

we've been working on all
year."
The improvement and a re
spectable 3-4 record in their
first varsity season reflect the
hard work of the women gym
nasts and their coaching staff.
