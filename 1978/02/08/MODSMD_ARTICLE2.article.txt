Lyman's appointment of these
members to the commission com
pletes the CIR. Last weekend, amid
much controversy, 14 students self
selected three student members to
the commission. They named Susan
Burrus, junior in economics; Lee
Goldman, graduate in law; and
Ronald Johnson, graduate in
economics.
The self selection process was
used by Lyman when the ASSU Se
nate refused to name students to the
CIR. The students were protesting
changes the Board of Trustees made
in the ad hoc commission's recom
mended guidelines on the CIR.
The senate has scheduled a special
meeting for tonight at 7:30 in
Graduate School of Business room 75
to discuss the naming of students to
the CIR.
