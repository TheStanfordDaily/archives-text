Carter plans aid to college students
Washington — President Jimmy Carter will announce a
major program today to provide at least $700 million to
college students from middle-income families because
he fears a 71 per cent jump in college costs has put their
chances for higher education in jeopardy.
Press Secretary Jody Powell did not specify what
families Carter would include in the middle class. Under
the government's current $2.2 billion program, most
basic grants go to students from families earning less
than $10,000.
The grants drop to a minimum of $50 as income and
assets increase. The cutoff point for a family of four with
one child in college is roughly $17,500 in income.
For fiscal 1979, Carter has proposed $4 billion for exist
ing programs to help college students and has proposed
raising the maximum grant from $1600 to $1800. He also
has proposed making more students eligible.
Between 1967 and 1975, Powell said, college costs
have increased by about 71 per cent, putting the average
cost of tuition, room and board for each student attend
ing private school at more than $4000 a year.
Energy compromise anticipated
Washington — An anticipated Senate compromise
proposal calling for phased natural gas deregulation is
"salable" in the House and appears to have the support
of President Jimmy Carter, House Speaker Thomas
O'Neill said yesterday.
O'Neill said that Carter, in a breakfast meeting with
Democratic leaders, voiced optimism that the long im
passe on his energy plan may soon be broken.
O'Neill told reporters that Carter, Vice President Wal
ter Mondale and Energy Secretary James Schlesinger all
said they hoped that "before the end of the week, the
whole package will be put together."
He spoke as Senate energy conferees, whose inability
to agree among themselves has stalled action on Carter s
energy bill since December, inched toward a com
promise calling for gradual lifting of price controls on
natural gas.
A majority of the Senate negotiators appeared on the
verge of settling their differences with a proposal that
would lift price controls no later than 1985 and possibly
as early as 1983.
Sadat not shy, threatens Congress
Washington — Egyptian President Anwar Sadat told
members of Congress yesterday that he will not be shy in
askingfor U.S. weapons, adding that "I shall raise hell" if
Congress does not approve them.
Although the comment was made with a laugh after a
meeting with members of the House of Representatives,
he seemed more somber as he emerged later from a
similar session with a Senate group.
"I threatened them," Sadat said after his closed door
talks with the senators.
Strike continues; coal dwindling
Washington — Regional leaders of the United Mine
Workers failed to take action Tuesday on a tentative
industry contract offer that could end the 65-day-old

coal strike.
The union's 39-member bargaining council recessed
without taking a vote and ordered negotiators to de
velop final contract language before the panel acts on
the proposal.
This could take several days, meaning that the strike
will continue to reduce coal stockpiles in several Ap
palachian states where plans are already being made to
curtail electrical output.
Cuban troops fighting in Ethiopia
Mogadishu, Somalia — Thousands of Cuban soldiers
are steaming toward the Horn of Africa aboard Soviet
ships to help Ethiopia in its war against ethnic Somali
rebels, diplomatic sources claimed yesterday.
The reports said about 3000 to 6000 Cuban troops left
their Caribbean homeland for Ethiopia sometime last
week and would "triple or double" the number of Cu
bans said to be fighting in southeastern Ethiopia's dis
puted Ogaden Desert on the Somalia border.
The sources said most of the Cuban troops are be
lieved slated for a major role in Ethiopia's long-expected
counter-offensive to drive out ethnic Somali rebels who
now control about 97 per cent of the Ogaden and are
trying to annex it to Somalia.
Soviets may have built nuclear ship
Washington — The Navy's top admiral said yesterday
that the Russians may have built their first nuclear
powered surface warship.
Adm. James Holloway, chief of naval operations, told
the House Armed Services Committee that "the Soviet
Union has recently launched a large ship, apparently a
combatant which is fitting out at the Baltic shipyard in
Leningrad."
In carefully chosen words, Holloway said, "We cannot
rule out the possibility that this may be the Soviets' first
nuclear-powered surface warship." He described the
vessel as over 600 feet long and well over 20,000 tons in
displacement, but gave no other details.
The United States is far ahead of the Soviet Union with
10 nuclear-propelled aircraft carriers and cruisers, some
of them nearly 20 years old. Three more are being pre
pared for commissioning.
Dow Jones advances 10.23
New York — The stock market rolled up its best gain in
nearly three months yesterday, undeterred by a snow
storm that delayed the start of trading in New York.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 10.23
to 778.85 for its sharpest advance since last Nov. 10,
when it climbed 14.12.
Volume on the Big Board came to 14.73 million shares
against 11.63 million the day before.
