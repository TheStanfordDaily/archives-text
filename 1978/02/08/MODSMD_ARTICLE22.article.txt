# Diamond: sit-ins rally liberals
## 
### Willy Leber 
The major function of last May's
sit-in at Old Union was to "basi
cally get us liberals off our asses,"
Larry Diamond, an initial or
ganizer of Stanford New Direc
tions said last night on KZSU's
Campus Conference.
"The biggest single impact sit
ins of the '60s had was moving the
broad mass of the liberal com
munity on campus," he con
tinued.
Diamond described New Direc
tions as "internationalist." The
organization, formally estab
lished here this fall, is designed to
educate students on domestic
and foreign policy.
In the area of foreign affairs,
Diamond said he feels "people
are ignorant." He added that he
doesn't "think it's correct to label
the campus as apathetic. I think
it's mainly that people are una
ware."
New Directions is presently
going door to door asking stu
dents to write state senators in
support of the Panama Canal tre
aty. A unanimous vote of the or
ganization's membership recently
endorsed lobbying for ratification
of the treaty.
"We feel this is the single most
important foreign policy issue,
and without question the most
important symbolic issue since
the end of the Vietnam War," said
Diamond.
Diamond said he believes the
United States and the western

world could "bring South Africa
to its knees economically, if they
(western countries) were willing
to suffer the consequences."
On the role of multinational
corporations in the development
of the Third World, Diamond saw
profit as the corporate incentive
for development.

"At the same time we have to
monitor their (corporation's) ac
tivities carefully enough so their
profits aren't so excessive that it
makes their presence more harm
ful than beneficial."
In third world countries where
"one of the most urgent goals is to
expand the number of employed
people" it doesn't make sense to
transfer such advanced technol
ogy as a steel mill, according to
Diamond.

When asked if New Directions
would attempt to foster similar
organizations on other college
campuses, Diamond replied that
he thinks "there's going to be an
interest in replicating this kind of
organization across the country.''
He added that other colleges
have been "extraordinarily im
pressed" with the success of the
organization.
New Directions presently has
275 subscribers to their monthly
newsletter.
Funding of the organization has
been from diverse sources. It
charges $3 subscription fee per
year for a monthly newsletter,
which generally deals with a
specific foreign policy issue. They
recently received a grant from
Stanford Center for Innovation in
Research and Education (SCIRE).
According to Diamond, the or
ganization "will from time to time
seek funding from outside
sources such as corporations."
Kaiser Cement of Oakland re
cently contributed $750 to Stan
ford New Directions.
Upcoming events sponsored by
Stanford New Directions include
a forum on multinational corpora
tions and their role in the de
velopment of the third world.
They sponsor bag lunches with
guests discussing foreign policy
issues every Thursday.
Future newsletters will deal
with energy and the world politi
cal turmoil surrounding South Af
rica.

The major function of last May's
sit-in at Old Union was to "basi
cally get us liberals off our asses,"
Larry Diamond, an initial or
ganizer of Stanford New Direc
tions said last night on KZSU's
Campus Conference.
"The biggest single impact sit
ins of the '60s had was moving the
broad mass of the liberal com
munity on campus," he con
tinued.
Diamond described New Direc
tions as "internationalist." The
organization, formally estab
lished here this fall, is designed to
educate students on domestic
and foreign policy.
In the area of foreign affairs,
Diamond said he feels "people
are ignorant." He added that he
doesn't "think it's correct to label
the campus as apathetic. I think
it's mainly that people are una
ware."
New Directions is presently
going door to door asking stu
dents to write state senators in
support of the Panama Canal tre
aty. A unanimous vote of the or
ganization's membership recently
endorsed lobbying for ratification
of the treaty.
"We feel this is the single most
important foreign policy issue,
and without question the most
important symbolic issue since
the end of the Vietnam War," said
Diamond.
Diamond said he believes the
United States and the western

world could "bring South Africa
to its knees economically, if they
(western countries) were willing
to suffer the consequences."
On the role of multinational
corporations in the development
of the Third World, Diamond saw
profit as the corporate incentive
for development.

"At the same time we have to
monitor their (corporation's) ac
tivities carefully enough so their
profits aren't so excessive that it
makes their presence more harm
ful than beneficial."
In third world countries where
"one of the most urgent goals is to
expand the number of employed
people" it doesn't make sense to
transfer such advanced technol
ogy as a steel mill, according to
Diamond.

When asked if New Directions
would attempt to foster similar
organizations on other college
campuses, Diamond replied that
he thinks "there's going to be an
interest in replicating this kind of
organization across the country.''
He added that other colleges
have been "extraordinarily im
pressed" with the success of the
organization.
New Directions presently has
275 subscribers to their monthly
newsletter.
Funding of the organization has
been from diverse sources. It
charges $3 subscription fee per
year for a monthly newsletter,
which generally deals with a
specific foreign policy issue. They
recently received a grant from
Stanford Center for Innovation in
Research and Education (SCIRE).
According to Diamond, the or
ganization "will from time to time
seek funding from outside
sources such as corporations."
Kaiser Cement of Oakland re
cently contributed $750 to Stan
ford New Directions.
