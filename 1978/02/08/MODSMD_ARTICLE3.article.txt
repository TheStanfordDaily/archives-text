# Panama Canal: controversy runs deep
## 
### Jill Stewart News analysis 
The issues surrounding the two
Panama Canal treaties seem to get
more and more complex the closer
you look at them.
Two major advocacy groups are in
volved in the Panama Canal con
troversy. One group urges con
tinued U.S. intervention in issues
concerning the vital waterway, while
another faction advocates giving
Panama control of the canal. Along
with these two clear-cut sides are a
myriad of middle-of-the-road ideas
and suggestions.
A member of the former group is
retired Navy Capt. Paul Ryan, a re
search associate at Hoover Institu
tion.
Ryan, author of a recently pub
lished book, "The Panama Canal
Controversy," sees trouble ahead if
the new treaties are adopted in pre
sent form.
Ryan's criticisms of the treaties are
based partly on what he called a
major misunderstanding between
the U.S. and Panama in interpreting
the proposed treaties.
President Jimmy Carter's fireside
chat last week sharply contrasted
Ryan's views. Carter said the treaties
make it obvious the U.S. can take
whatever military action is necessary
to assure the canal's safety.
He also said the treaties guarantee
that U.S. ships will always have ex
peditious transit through the canal.
A second concern of Ryan's is that
the more cooperative attitude of the
U.S. toward Panama is part of a pat
tern of concessions by the U.S. to
Third World nations.
"It is not apparent to Washington
that there are problems down the
road," Ryan said. "Panamanians will
come forward with new demands.
One might come up that we get out
before 1999. New demands, new
concessions. This is a pattern that
will continue in the future."
On the other side of the debate is
Larry Diamond, member of New Di
rections at the University, a nation
wide organization designed to edu
cate people about foreign issues.
The changing foreign policy is a
long needed step toward more equal
relations with Third World countries,
Diamond said.

"This treaty is going to be a symbol
to the world of how we are going to
relate to Third World countries in the
remainder of this century," he said.
Ryan's stand stems from an out
moded conception that the U.S.
should control the world like it did in
the 19505, Diamond said.
"We are continuing to retreat from
what 50 years ago no one would be
embarrassed to describe as our man
ifest destiny," he said "Most of the
strong sentiment for keeping the
canal is . . . jingoistic â€” a mindless
kind of nationalism."
But Ryan cautioned that a ten

dency for Third World nations to act
without impunity against world
powers has developed. He cited the
Bay of Pigs and Pueblo incidents as
times when the U.S. acted with a les
ser show of strength than was
needed.
This lack of aggression has added
to the public's increasing opinion
thatthe U.S. is not handling thecanal
treaty problems as well as it should,
Ryan said.
Diamond agreed that Americans
are uneasy about the canal issue.
The building of the canal was an
extraordinary technological feat that

is really not appreciated by college
age people, but their parents
strongly identify with the achieve
ment, Diamond said.
"And now a lot of people see us as
giving away this precious thing," he
said. "There is a peculiar attachment
to the canal in the American psyche."
But Diamond stands firm.
"A lively great nation has to learn
how to be generous and cooperating
and understanding in living with its
neighbors. You need to be aggres
sive only in the face of aggression,"
he said.
