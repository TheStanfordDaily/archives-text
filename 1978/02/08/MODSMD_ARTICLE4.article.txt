# Don Luce accuses Carter of having Vietnam mentality
## 
### Jonathan Slater 
Amidst references to a return to a Kissinger-Nixon
style foreign policy, Don Luce, the prominent anti
war activist who exposed Saigon's "tiger cages," ac
cused President Jimmy Carter and his administration
of continuing to exercise a "Vietnam mentality"
which prevailed during the Johnson and Nixon eras.
At a forum yesterday afternoon, Luce spoke with
Ron Ridenhour, who was instrumental in exposing
the My Lai Massacre, about the impact of the Vietnam
War on American domestic and foreign policy.
Ridenhour, who left the army in 1968 after serving
in Vietnam, opened the forum with a talk about
domestic intelligence operations designed to supress
anti-war and political dissension movements bet
ween 1968 and 1972.
He explained that the Army collaborated with city
and state law enforcement agencies to disrupt what
authorities had termed "revolutionary" activist or
ganizations.
Specifically, Ridenhour spoke of courses on civil
emergency operations involving "war games" and
strategies which were "imported wholesale from Vie
tnam." The five-day courses taught local law en
forcement agencies to reorganize themselves on a
model consistent with army organization and proce
dure. Therefore, in the event of a significant uprising
the army could join with local authorities and create
one massive organization, he said.
Vet Ridenhour said he did not feel that the country
was just going through a phase as a reaction to a
potential crisis. He stressed that the atmosphere of
suppression and abuse has not receded.

"You create something like that (an oppressive sys
tem) and you turn it on: it develops a life of its own,"
commented Ridenhour.
Luce, international representative for Clergy and
Laity Concerned and former executive chairman of
that humanitarian organization, spoke about the U.S.
government's persistent refusal to share in the rede
velopment of a country (Vietnam) whose productive
capacity it is responsible for having destroyed.
Having returned from Vietnam last May, Luce de
scribed the barren land destroyed by American
weapons — of farmers who spend their time digging
for land mines before they could begin to till the soil.
In Luce's opinion, "it is very clear that the govern
ment is unwilling to move towards reconciliation with
Vietnam." He said he was disturbed that the U.S.
continues to deny its own citizens permission to aid
the present Vietnamese regime.
He also expressed dissatisfaction at the compla
cency and lack of participation by Americans, and
students in particular, towards the deteriorating situ
ation in the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
"In the Philippines there is a lot of torture; that is
well documented. In Thailand, 3000-4000 people have
been arrested on charges of 'endangering society,' "
stated Luce.
He did remark that the peace movement, although
missing the spirit and intensity which once charac
terized it, still plays a vital role in world affairs.
He credits peace efforts as the force which is re
sponsible for keeping the U.S. out of Angola.
"I think that what we're limited by is (not enough)
courage and energy," concluded Luce.

Amidst references to a return to a Kissinger-Nixon
style foreign policy, Don Luce, the prominent anti
war activist who exposed Saigon's "tiger cages," ac
cused President Jimmy Carter and his administration
of continuing to exercise a "Vietnam mentality"
which prevailed during the Johnson and Nixon eras.
At a forum yesterday afternoon, Luce spoke with
Ron Ridenhour, who was instrumental in exposing
the My Lai Massacre, about the impact of the Vietnam
War on American domestic and foreign policy.
Ridenhour, who left the army in 1968 after serving
in Vietnam, opened the forum with a talk about
domestic intelligence operations designed to supress
anti-war and political dissension movements bet
ween 1968 and 1972.
He explained that the Army collaborated with city
and state law enforcement agencies to disrupt what
authorities had termed "revolutionary" activist or
ganizations.
Specifically, Ridenhour spoke of courses on civil
emergency operations involving "war games" and
strategies which were "imported wholesale from Vie
tnam." The five-day courses taught local law en
forcement agencies to reorganize themselves on a
model consistent with army organization and proce
dure. Therefore, in the event of a significant uprising
the army could join with local authorities and create
one massive organization, he said.
Vet Ridenhour said he did not feel that the country
was just going through a phase as a reaction to a
potential crisis. He stressed that the atmosphere of
suppression and abuse has not receded.

"You create something like that (an oppressive sys
tem) and you turn it on: it develops a life of its own,"
commented Ridenhour.
Luce, international representative for Clergy and
Laity Concerned and former executive chairman of
that humanitarian organization, spoke about the U.S.
government's persistent refusal to share in the rede
velopment of a country (Vietnam) whose productive
capacity it is responsible for having destroyed.
Having returned from Vietnam last May, Luce de
scribed the barren land destroyed by American
weapons — of farmers who spend their time digging
for land mines before they could begin to till the soil.
In Luce's opinion, "it is very clear that the govern
ment is unwilling to move towards reconciliation with
Vietnam." He said he was disturbed that the U.S.
continues to deny its own citizens permission to aid
the present Vietnamese regime.
He also expressed dissatisfaction at the compla
cency and lack of participation by Americans, and
students in particular, towards the deteriorating situ
ation in the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
"In the Philippines there is a lot of torture; that is
well documented. In Thailand, 3000-4000 people have
been arrested on charges of 'endangering society,' "
stated Luce.
He did remark that the peace movement, although
missing the spirit and intensity which once charac
terized it, still plays a vital role in world affairs.
He credits peace efforts as the force which is re
sponsible for keeping the U.S. out of Angola.
"I think that what we're limited by is (not enough)
courage and energy," concluded Luce.
