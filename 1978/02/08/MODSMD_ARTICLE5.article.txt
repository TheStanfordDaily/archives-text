# Blizzard buries U.S. from Midwest to East
## 
### Associated Press 
Snow, winds and floodwaters
brought a second day of misery to
millions in the blizzard-plagued
Northeast yesterday, while residents
of some Midwestern areas suffered
bitter cold and new storms.
Trouble spots ranged from Mas
sachusetts — where a power black
out and some looting in Boston
compounded the blizzard problems
— to Montana, which was struck by
snow on Monday and faced con
tinued blizzard warnings yesterday.
Even Anchorage, Alaska, had to
close its schools, for the first time
since 1964, because of snow which
started Saturday and was still falling
heavily.
President )immy Carter declared
emergencies for Massachusetts,
Rhode Island and Connecticut, and
the Federal Disaster Assistance Ad
ministration said 1200 U.S. Army
troops were being flown to New Eng
land to help with snow removal.
Cooperation
Like most disasters, the storms
brought out good and bad. New Jer
sey officials described public coop
eration as "marvelous." In Boston,
however, police arrested 43 persons
in 20 incidents of looting, primarily in
the Roxbury and Dorchester areas.
Boston Police Commissioner
Joseph Jordan ordered all off-duty
policemen to report to divisions with
full riot gear yesterday afternoon.
The snow in the Northeast began
Sunday night — barely two weeks
after the last blizzard — and was still
falling in some parts at midday yes
terday, although it was less severe
than earlier and was expected to
taper off during the day. The storm in
New York City was officially declared
ended at 3:30 p.m., about 40 hours
after it began. Accumulations ranged
from one to two feet.
No flights
Transportation was at a near
standstill. Airports in the Northeast
were shut down Monday, and air
ports in other parts of the country
were jammed with passengers un
able to reach snowbound destina
tions.
Officials of the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey said
LaCuardia, Kennedy and Newark
airports would reopen today — Ne

wark at 10 a.m. and LaGuardia and
Kennedy at noon.
Philadelphia International Airport
officially reopened at 6 p.m. yester
day, 23 hours after it was shut down
by 14.1 inches of snow, the heaviest
snowfall in the city in 17 years.
As the snow stopped, the cleanup
started. The New York City Sanita
tion Department had 3700 men on
the streets working a 12-hour shift.
They used 1300 major pieces of
snowfighting equipment and were
supplied with 42,000 tons of salt.
About 600 state snow plows, aided by
1000 private trucks and scores of
county and municipal crews, worked
to clear roads in New Jersey.
In California
Flood warnings were issued yes
terday for three Northern California
rivers and, although officials ex
pected waters to recede by morning,
they warned another heavy rain
could put them over the edge.
Bill Clark of the state's flood in
formation said levels on the Russian
River, Napa River and Eel River were
expected to reach the warning level
by late last night, then recede this
morning.
"We've got no problems here,"
said Clark. "But — however — if it
rains, things could change very
rapidly."
A tornado struck a school in a rural
area north of Sacramento yesterday
afternoon and damaged some

nearby buildings, although only one
minor injury was reported. The
winds tore roofs and siding off Rio
Linda's Vineland Elementary School,
leveled several barns, and de
molished a mobile home, according
to witnesses.
Interstate 5
Near L.A., road crews finally suc
ceeded in clearing the mud-blocked
south-bound lanes of I-5 as a new
storm began battering Southern
California, threatening still more
mudslides.
Crews from the California De
partment of Transportation worked
about two days scrapping and haul
ing some 40,000 tons of mud from the
south-bound lanes of I-5 near
Grapevine. The four south-bound
lanes had been blocked by a half
mile-long mudslide since Sunday,
when a Pacific storm drenched the
area and loosened the hillside soil.
That storm was blamed for six traf
fic deaths.
Six tons of cement, wood and mud
threatened to slide onto the Pacific
Coast Highway in Santa Monica last
night, forcing closure of a five-mile
stretch of road during evening
rush-hour traffic, police said.
Both lanes of the coastal road were
closed from the end of the
westbound Santa Monica Freeway to
Chautauqua Road, where West Los
Angeles begins, said Santa Monica
police Lt. Robert Taylor.
