# Sophomore women
## Sex habits surveyed 
### Matt Mettler 
A detailed questionnaire concerning the nature and extent of communica
tion between mothers and their college-age daughters about female sexuality
was sent to half the sophomore women Monday, according to Wenda Brews
ter, a graduate student research assistant working on the project.
The project is being sponsored by the Center for Research on Women
(CROW).
Because the survey is long and detailed, women polled will be reimbursed
$3 in an effort to encourage participation.
All information is provided anonymously, Brewster said.
The questionnaire examines such issues as how freely mothers and
daughters discuss female sexuality, what specific topics they have covered
and what daughters feel their mothers expect. It also asks how daughters
think their mothers would react to a variety of hypothetical situations.
To help "understand better the communication" between daughters and
their mothers, the survey also questions women about past sexual experi
ences, changes in sexual attitudes and behavior between high school and
college, and women's general fears, if any, about female sexuality.
The project grew out of a SWOPSI course on female sexuality last year
taught by Marilyn Yalom, associate director of CROW.
CROW has also received questionnaires from a similar survey sent to a
group of mothers with college-age daughters.
Results from the mother's questionnaire were somewhat surprising ac
cording to Brewster.
"The mothers were much more liberal than we expected, especially regard
ing their daughters having an abortion or using contraceptives," Brewster
explained.
Brewster said they were particularly interested in correlating the results
with the religious background, college living situation, mother's background
and with the geographical area where the daughter was raised.
She also indicated that neither the mothers polled, nor women at the
University, are representative of the population as a whole.
"However, young educated women tend to be indicative of what later
develops as a general trend," Brewster added.
Any group or individual who is interested in discussing the topic of female
sexuality or the results of the survey is welcome to call Yalom or Brewster at
CROW.
