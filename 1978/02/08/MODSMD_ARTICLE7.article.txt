Milton Friedman, the economist
from Hoover, has recently com
plained to Business Week that he has
been hounded by protestors at the
University of Chicago and at other
appearances he has made around the
country.
He laments that he has been dep
rived of his freedom of speech and
other democratic rights.
We are asked to pity this man who
aided the Chilean junta in formulat
ing its economic policies.
The facts: Witnesses before the
U.S. Senate Select Committee on In
telligence Activities in December
1975 testified that several of Fried
man's "Chicago Gang" (those
economists who have collected at
Friedman's home base, the Univer
sity of Chicago economics depart
ment) received money from the CIA
to write a 300-page economic prog
nosis for the Chilean generals in pre
paration for the military coup. (Busi
ness Week, 1/12/76).
On March 21, 1975 Friedman and
another of the "Chicago Gang" met
General Augusto Pinochet, head of
the Chilean junta, for a discussion of
economic affairs. At that meeting
Friedman stated: "Don't worrvabout
your international image anymore,
Mr. President, just make sure that
the international corporations find it
profitable to invest, nothing more."
Just after Friedman left, the junta
chose a new cabinet including a

number of members of the "Chicago
Gang," in order to develop Fried
man's "shock treatment" economic
program for Chile. Over a year later,
Business Week reported that infla
tion in Chile was over 200 percent
annually and unemployment stood
at over 18 percent.
With characteristic understate
ment Friedman admitted that his
"shock treatment" program "would
mean a tough period ahead for the
poorer section of the population."
We think Friedman's economic
program fits well with the brutal
political repression which the junta
uses to extract the most profit out of
the Chilean working people.
Friedman has not been elevated to
his pinnacle of success simply for his
heroics abroad. His theories have
also legitimized attacks on the
American people. As the capitalist
system has sunk into another of its
recurring economic crises, deeper
this time than the last one, the corpo
rate owners have been forced to
squeeze more and more profits out
of the working class.
One way they save money for
needed new investment (a la Carter's
investment tax proposal) is through
cutbacks in social services needed by
the people. Friedman has performed
an invaluable service for the
capitalists by pushing the legitimacy
and necessity of these policies under
the rhetoric of getting government's

"cotton-picking" hands off private
enterprise. For this good turn,
Friedman has been brought into the
mainstream of bourgeois
economics.
What do Friedman's theories mean
for the American people? Take un
employment — in the February 7,
1977 Newsweek Friedman argues
that high unemployment is related to
the availability of unemployment in
surance. (. . . "sometimes it pays to
be unemployed")
So who are the unemployed? Ac
cording to government statistics, the
million or so who were just cut off
unemployment benefits (when the
federal benefits were cut from 65 to
39 weeks) were mainly 40 years old or
older. People that age will have a
hard time ever getting a decent job
again. Does cutting off unemploy
ment insurance give them "incen
tive" or simply drive them and their
families into the dirt?
Friedman applies his same reac
tionary arguments everywhere. "If
each of us had to pay directly the full
cost of energy ... we would indi
vidually have incentive to dispense
with the least valued uses of energy"
— the poor could simply go without
heat when rates go skyhigh after de
regulation.
Unfortunately, Friedmaniac
economics is no fantasy world. In
this country today welfare is being
cut back, health care services are get
ting worse for everyone but the rich,
social security is going bankrupt;
Friedman would have us believe that
all these are steps in the right direc
tion.
The capitalists can't hold onto their
empire simply by dint of the fact that
they own most of the wealth and can
use armed force, the police and
military to defend their interests.
They must find ways to steal peoples'
minds as well as their labor and
money.
Friedman is not simply a profes
sional economist who can marshal
"theory" and figures well. He's a
hired intellectual gun of the corpo
rate ruling class. That's why he's at
Hoover, resthome for aging reac
tionaries. And that's why we must
oppose him, and more importantly,
the corporate ruling class he serves.
The American working people,
who Friedman treats as simply statis
tics on his charts, are beginning to
organize and will one day make re
volution and do away with the ideas
of the servile savants of moneyed
capital like Friedman.

volutionary Communist Youth
Brigade.)
