Rape
The number of attempted rapes
during the daytime is increasing. The
police have reported to us three day
time rape attempts within the last
two weeks. We are writing to remind
people to take reasonable safety pre
cautions, including traveling (and
jogging) in pairs, and using well
trafficked, well-lighted paths.
If you have information concern
ing assault attempts, please contact
the Dept. of Public Safety at 497-3444
or Leah Kaplan, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs, at 497-2733. All reports
are confidential and can be made
anonymously.
A training session for people in
terested in facilitating rape educa
tion discussion groups on campus
will take place on Feb. 11 from9:3oto
4. Persons interested in participating
in this program should call Marcia
Quackenbush at the Dean of Student
Affairs Office, 497-2733, by Monday,
Feb. 6.
A booklet, Working Against Rape,
prepared by area women, will be dis
tributed through the discussion
groups.

Doctors advertise
In his letter to the Daily (Feb. 3,
1978), David Sartoris does his best to
perpetuate the exalted and untouch
able status of doctors. Although he
acknowledges that, "The American
public and the Federal Trade Com
mission are clearly justified in their
desire for improved health care at
lower cost,"he nevertheless
criticizes any means that may bring
about that improvement.
Doctors are indispensable to soci
ety, and many of us literally owe our
lives to them, but must we acknow
ledge our debt by meekly handing
over our money to men who enjoy a
Cod-like role that somehow makes
their ways beyond criticism?
The American public for some time
now has been tired of the closed
ranks, inner-circle sanctimonious
ness of doctors and have long felt

manipulated and exploited as per
petual money-making machines for
the doctors.
So". . . most Americans presently
know very little about their doctors."
It would seem to me that the doctors
have withheld this information be
cause it helps enhance their mys
tique of overall superiority. This at
titude is demonstrated by Sartoris'
statement that only "quacks" would
want to advertise.
Why is it so incredible that qual
ified, competent, compassionate
doctors might want to advertise,
perhaps notifying the public that
they have reduced rates for low
income persons or that they have
certain specialties at which they are
proficient?
I think it is unethical for doctors
not to be able to advertise.

Story inaccurate
Lane Webster's article, "Congres
sional bills seek to alter control of
native American lands," (Daily, Jan.
27) is faulted by serious errors of fact
and omission.
Factually inaccurate is the descrip
tion of Lloyd Meeds as a freshman
congressman. Meeds, chairman of
the House Subcommittee on Indian
Affairs, is in his seventh term. More
importantly, Meeds has recently an
nounced that this will be his last
term. Therefore it seems we can infer
motives other than pandering for
votes as the reason for Meeds' legis
lation.
Cunningham's proposal, however,
is a political response to a Northwest
dispute over native American fishing
rights. This issue is too complex to
detail here, but it is unquestionably
at the very heart of Cunningham's
legislation.
Neglecting the fishing rights im
broglio is perhaps conceivable con
sidering the article's focus on effects
of proposed legislation, but allowing
the quote concerning Meeds to pass
uncorrected points to either sloppy
editing or slight research on the part
of the Daily.
