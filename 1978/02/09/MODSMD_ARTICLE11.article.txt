# Hunger march appealing

Be forewarned. This article is an attempt to get you to
do something. As if you don't have enough to do,
enough demands on your time, here is another request
to do something, simply because it is just, because it is
humane, because your efforts are greatly needed, and
because you simply may have a good time.
On Saturday morning, Feb. 25, many people who
care about hunger will go for a walk. The organizers call
it a walkathon, and it is intended to raise money to help
keep various hunger relief agencies going. One of those
agencies is the Ecumenical Hunger Project (EHP) located
here in Palo Alto.
Yes, in Palo Alto. Because like everywhere else, Palo
Alto has hungry people; i.e., people on fixed incomes
who can't afford proper nutrition, people in emergency
situations who can't get food stamps, and senior citizens
whose social security checks are not sufficient.
Fverv vear, the EHP's 80-100 volunteers collect and
distribute about4o tons of food, and the money raised by
the march will help keep the effort going for another
year.
Other development or overseas relief agencies will
receive funds as well, including CARE, or virtually any
other group that the walker or donor designates.
Feed Palo Alto poor
But the key ingredient to this effort is you, people in
this community. There must be people here that are

willing to donate a Saturday morning to participate in the
walk, or willing to sponsor a walker.
If you would like to walk the ten-mile circuit through
Palo Alto and Menlo Park (or part of it), get a group of
friends together and call the Stanford Committee on
Hunger for information (497-3114). And if you would like
to sponsor a walker (for any amount), but haven't been
able to find one, again please call the hunger committee.
When one considers the enormity of the world
hunger problem, and is confronted with the staggering
numbers of the world's malnourished, it is difficult to
believe that an individual effort or small sacrifice on your
part will have any impact. But it can. And it makes a
difference here in this community.
At least 25 percent of the money raised this year
($12,000 last year) will go to local programs like the EHP.
The "difference" the march makes is food for the hun
dreds of poor and elderly in the Palo Alto area that rely
on such programs for nourishment.
Here is something in which everyone can participate.
Please join the effort, even if only for one Saturday
morning. Do it, because it is just, because it is humane,
because your efforts are needed. And because, you may
just have a good time.

believe that an individual effort or small sacrifice on your
part will have any impact. But it can. And it makes a
difference here in this community.
At least 25 percent of the money raised this year
($12,000 last year) will go to local programs like the EHP.
The "difference" the march makes is food for the hun
dreds of poor and elderly in the Palo Alto area that rely
on such programs for nourishment.
Here is something in which everyone can participate.
Please join the effort, even if only for one Saturday
morning. Do it, because it is just, because it is humane,
because your efforts are needed. And because, you may
just have a good time.

Hunger, is a co-terminal economics major.)
