Western civ advocated
We are very disappointed by reac
tions to the proposed Western Civ
requirement recently published. The
University is doing the students a
profound disservice by not demand
ing such minimal breadth require
ments for graduation.
Our student "leaders" (Daily,
I eh 2) rejec i the suggestion of any
requirement with such statements as
"the relative influence of western
culture is less today than it was SO to
100 years ago." Nonsense! We live in
a society which is firmly and inextric
ably based in western civilization and
culture.
Stanford should offer a liberal
education, This is not excessive
specialized training in a narrow field
aimed only at preparing the graduate
for a trade or profession. "Rather, a
liberal education equips the
graduate for pursuing a richer per
sonal and professional life through
enlargement of mind and spirit."
(Courses & Degrees '78)
A liberal arts degree should be
earned. If a graduate is to be certified
as "educated" by Stanford, there
must be some guarantee (s)he has
been exposed to the principles on
which our society operates. If the
student has not met the basic re
quirements of a liberal education, no
baccalaureate degree should be gi
ven.
We suggest that only a "certificate
of attendance" is in order for those
who demand complete freedom in
choosing courses and who reject
breadth requirements. A western
civilization requirement should be
considered one of the basic breadth
requirements of a liberal education
and therefore required for the bac
calaureate degree.
Our student "leaders" should be
ashamed of their inexcusable lack of
commitment to a meaningful under
graduate education. We register our
dissent from publicized student
opinion and hope for reinstatement
for basic requirements. Only then
will students be closer to earning a
meaningful degree. And that degree
will be much more significant than
the "certificate of attendance" it im
plies today. Tom „ ichfonl

Yell leaders respond
Where was the author of "Veil
Leaders Try" (Kevin O'Leary, Daily,

Feb. 6) all football season? I realize
some fans were so blitzed on sun
shine, beer and other substances
that the only thing which could pos
sibly attract their attention was six
people groveling around on the
stadium track However, more alert
fans did join in with several of our
other yells, some traditional and
some unusual
Getting people's attention and
teaching yells is definitely a chal
lenge to the other yell leaders and
me, mainly because the average
Stanford student does not enjoy a
yell leader's voice booming over a
microphone throughout a game.
So, at football games we alternated
leading yells from up in the stands
with hand held electric megaphones
and using the main microphone at a
bearable volume.
Basketball is a different story, since
the best time for a yeil to be or
ganized is during time outs when our
band or the opposing school's band
usually plays. The "Stanford stomp"
has gained some acceptance, and we
will try to make our other basketball
cheers heard too.
And further:
— If O'Leary can come up with some
"creative, not overdone, traditional

yet original, not too complex or
corny cheers," we'll gladly try them
out.
— The Dollies have been enthusias
tic and helpful to us from the start. As
for "making use of them," they have
treelv loaned us their pom-poms
and dresses whenever we needed
them.
— The band has come a long way in
their support of yell leading since the
Colorado football game when we re
ceived this encouragement before
entering the stadium: "Veil leaders
— this is the beginning of the end,
en|oy your brief notoriety!" (Now
they can even be caught stomping
and spelling along with us at away
games.)
— So as not to embarrass anyone
with our "duck tail" uniforms at the
Sun Bowl on national TV, we really
should have borrowed either the
USC cheerleaders nuvo-flares and
wool sweaters, or the Menlo Ather
ton pleated skirts ....
Kidding and comments aside, it's
good to hear someone wants us
doing more instead of less, and be
lieves that yell leading this year has
not been the beginning of the end.

A liberal arts degree should be
earned. If a graduate is to be certified
as "educated" by Stanford, there
must be some guarantee (s)he has
been exposed to the principles on
which our society operates. If the
student has not met the basic re
quirements of a liberal education, no
baccalaureate degree should be gi
ven.
We suggest that only a "certificate
of attendance" is in order for those
who demand complete freedom in
choosing courses and who reject
breadth requirements. A western
civilization requirement should be
considered one of the basic breadth
requirements of a liberal education
and therefore required for the bac
calaureate degree.
Our student "leaders" should be
ashamed of their inexcusable lack of
commitment to a meaningful under
graduate education. We register our
dissent from publicized student
opinion and hope for reinstatement
for basic requirements. Only then
will students be closer to earning a
meaningful degree. And that degree
will be much more significant than
the "certificate of attendance" it im
plies today. Tom „ ichfonl

Yell leaders respond
Where was the author of "Veil
Leaders Try" (Kevin O'Leary, Daily,

Feb. 6) all football season? I realize
some fans were so blitzed on sun
shine, beer and other substances
that the only thing which could pos
sibly attract their attention was six
people groveling around on the
stadium track However, more alert
fans did join in with several of our
other yells, some traditional and
some unusual
Getting people's attention and
teaching yells is definitely a chal
lenge to the other yell leaders and
me, mainly because the average
Stanford student does not enjoy a
yell leader's voice booming over a
microphone throughout a game.
So, at football games we alternated
leading yells from up in the stands
with hand held electric megaphones
and using the main microphone at a
bearable volume.
Basketball is a different story, since
the best time for a yeil to be or
ganized is during time outs when our
band or the opposing school's band
usually plays. The "Stanford stomp"
has gained some acceptance, and we
will try to make our other basketball
cheers heard too.
And further:
— If O'Leary can come up with some
"creative, not overdone, traditional

yet original, not too complex or
corny cheers," we'll gladly try them
out.
— The Dollies have been enthusias
tic and helpful to us from the start. As
for "making use of them," they have
treelv loaned us their pom-poms
and dresses whenever we needed
them.
— The band has come a long way in
their support of yell leading since the
Colorado football game when we re
ceived this encouragement before
entering the stadium: "Veil leaders
— this is the beginning of the end,
en|oy your brief notoriety!" (Now
they can even be caught stomping
and spelling along with us at away
games.)
— So as not to embarrass anyone
with our "duck tail" uniforms at the
Sun Bowl on national TV, we really
should have borrowed either the
USC cheerleaders nuvo-flares and
wool sweaters, or the Menlo Ather
ton pleated skirts ....
Kidding and comments aside, it's
good to hear someone wants us
doing more instead of less, and be
lieves that yell leading this year has
not been the beginning of the end.

We are very disappointed by reac

Our student "leaders" (Daily,

"the relative influence of western

100 years ago." Nonsense! We live in

Stanford should offer a liberal
education, This is not excessive
specialized training in a narrow field
aimed only at preparing the graduate

enlargement of mind and spirit."
