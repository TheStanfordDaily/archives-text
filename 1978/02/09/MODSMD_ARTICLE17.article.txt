## Preview/john nielsen Larry Lane on Bond's The Sea' 
### 
"As a piece of playwriting,
'The Sea' is incredibly skillfull.
It is economical, visual, and ex
tremely actable. It offers a rich
variety of roles within the
range of student actors, each
role beautifully crafted. I think
it is a play which speaks with
unusual clarity and keeness
about our lives."
Thus spake Larry Lane, the
third-year doctoral candidate
directing the Drama Depart
ment's production of Edward
Bond's tale of grotesque en
counters in an English seaside
town. "The Sea" which for
some strange reason is not oft
performed in these parts, fol
lows the effects of the drown
ing of a young man on the in
habitants of the town.
"It isn't easy to direct," said
Lane "in that it is fragmented,
with a wide range of styles —
but just the same it is enorm
ously stageworthy, and an ex
citing piece to be working on."
"The Sea" has been properly
desribed as "a comedy of ter
rors." Taking place near the
turn of the century, it begins,
again, with the drowning of a
yoL«;g man. Needless to say,
though, Bond writes about
more than the effect of mass
quantities of saltwater on the
lungs of a human being. To
Larry Lane, the play is primarily
concerned with "the invasion
into other people's lives of
death, of the unknowable, of
the power and mystery of the
sea itself.
"It is no accident thai Bond
has chosen 1907 as the year in
which the play takes place. At
that time the old Victorian
order was in swift decline, and
industrialization and labor and
feminist movements were
making inroads into the old so
cial order. Society was dying,
and no new worldview had
come into being to replace it.
"The Sea," then, is a play
about social forms — about
terriblv nervous, insecure,
proper people trying to deal
with the 'big questions' of
love, death, and the vast of
nature. The characters -lost
notably the aging, domineer
ing Mrs. Rafi, the mertectual
Vicar and the ladies who are
practicing an amateur theatri
cal to raise money for the < oast
guard; all of these people are
trapped in a rigid, uptight way
of living that simply cannot ac
comodate the realities of living
and changing and dying.

Another — Hatch, the draper
— is so intent on mastering
situations and maintaining the
status quo that he has fabri
cated a wild, implausible exp
lanation for the drowning: he
sees boating accidents at sea as
an attempt by creatures from
other planets to get ashore and
invade the town. Hatch is pet
rified, and he sets out to kill
one who has survived such an
occurance.
Admittedly such an action
does not reek of normalcy, but
such is the nature of Edward
Bond (the New York Times cal
led him "the playwrite gener
ally regarded abroad as the
finest now working in Britain).

His first major play, "Saved,"
caused an enormous con
troversy because of a "notori
ous scene in which a group of
young hoodlums stoned a
baby to death in a London
park. That scene fostered ar
guments to the effect that
Bond was crude and sen
sationalists," said Lane, "even
though its defenders were
quick to point to its fundamen
tally compassionate stance and
implicit social commitment.
"This combination of ex
treme violent action, together
with that deeply compassion
ate depiction of the characters
involved; well, it certainly isn't
missing from 'The Sea.' In 'The
Sea' Bond presents his 'terrors'

in a wildly comic way, though.
"The funeral scene tor
example — in which the mour
ners end up pelting each other
with the ashes of the deceased
— is crazy, comic, off-the-wall
and very physical. We're work
ing to preserve the wild ex
travagance of that humor."
Lane went on to mention
that in addition to being beaut
iful, grotesque, comical, ter
rifying, political and persona,
"The Sea" is also a love story.
But we'll let that rest. SufficetH
to say he seems confident, and
the production looks good.
"The Sea" will be performed
February 15 to 18 and 21 to 28,
at 8 p.m., in the Little Theater.
