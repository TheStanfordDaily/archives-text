## Herb and Chick: hot stuff 
### 
Jazz pianists Chick Corea
and Herbie Hancock gave two
fine performances last Thurs
day night at the Masonic Au
ditorium in San Francisco. Both
shows were taped for albums.
Playing acoustic piano alone
and in duet, Chick and Herbie
paid tribute to traditional jazz
and emphasized the roots from
which their current progres
sive styles have sprung.
Standards "Someday My Pr
ince Will Come" and "Liza"
high-lighted the first set. BoÂ»h
songs opened with a splendid
romantic, free-floating intro
duction. As they were to do
throughout the evening, Chick
dominated the tone of each
number with his melodic effer
vescence, while Herbie tem
pered their rhythms with var
ied meters. "Improvisation
with a Hook'' was also
noteworthy for the way the
pianists interwove their vivid
improvisations in a cohesive
series of musical images. In all
three numbers Chick and Her
bie showed respect for but not
fear of musical standardiza

tion: their repeated exchanges
of spontaneous ideas always
resolved in harmonious refer
ence to the original theme of
the number.
Bela Bartok's "Mikrokos
mos" No. 7 for four hands
began the second set. Playing
this short sketch from sheet
music, the duo pointed out the
similarities between modern
classical musicand progressive
jazz and demonstrated their
classical training. Chick then
reminded the enthusiastic au
dience that Herbie had to learn
jazz ideas note-for-note from
records because originally he
could not Intuit them, while he
had drifted naturally and easily
toward Latin rhythms.
Nowhere were these roots
more obvious than in the solo
improvisations they next
played. Chick based his on
"Armanda's Rumba" from "My
Spanish Herat." In a smooth
though unexpected transition
he moved from his well-known
ephemeral wanderings along
the keyboard to the more con

centrated, vigorous Latin
dance, in which he stomped
his foot and clapped his hands.
Herbie, on the other hand,
skipped from an applied and
effective impressionism into
funkified jazz and back again.
One wonders where his heart
lies.
Both pianists played the final
number, a dynamic medley of
Herbies' "Maiden Voyage"
and Chick's "La Fiesta." In so
successfully joining pieces
representative of such diffe
rent strains of music as the con
templative jazz of the '60s and
the more upbeat, fusion jazz ot
the early '70s, the duo proc
laimed the viability of their ex
perimentation with new forms.
Chick Corea and Herbie
Hancock last week created in
novation through variation. If
exciting performances across a
wide field of styles make up the
perfect model for a jazz con
cert, then this was perhaps the
jazz concert of the year in the
Bay Area. Wait patiently for the
album.
