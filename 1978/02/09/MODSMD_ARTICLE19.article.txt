## The 						Cleveland 4: stela 
### 
On Sunday, February 5,
the Cleveland Quartet
reaffirmed its reputation
as one of the most musical
ensembles to appear in
the last decade. The Quar
tet, consisting of Donald
Weilerstein and Peter
Salaff, violins; Martha
Strongin Katz, viola; and
Paul Katz, cello, opened its
program with the "Quar
tet in C Minor," Op. 18,
No. 4 by Beethoven, and
followed this with Quar
tets No. 2 and No. 1 by
Rachmaninoff. After in
termission the Quartet
concluded with the Quar
tet No. 2 in E major, Op. 92
by Prokofiev.
Unfortunately, the
program was occasionally
marred by minor technical
imperfections. Attacks
were sometimes slightly
ragged, and a few runs did

not project with as much
clarity as one would have
liked.
Happily, the Quartet
more than made up for
this with the tremendous
sensitivity and warmth of
their playing. In each
number on the program
and the encore, the sec
ond movement from the
Quartet in A Minor by
Brahms, the Cleveland
Quartet paid great atten
tion to dynamic levels,
lures, and tone.
The dynamic
were the highlight of the
