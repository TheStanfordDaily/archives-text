# Student loan defaults on rise

### Kathy Andrews 
The rate of default on student
loans at the University and through
out the nation is on an increasing
trend, according to Joseph Jedd,
manager of student accounting in
the Controller's Office.
"We have about 1.50 loan funds,"
Jedd said. "The NDSL (National Di
rect Student loan) fund is our
largest."
The NDSL is designed to benefit
students whose families' annual in
comes are in the low economic range
(less than $16,000).
Ninety per cent of the funds for the
NDSL are paid for by the govern
ment, with the remaining 10 per cent
met by the University.
The rate of delinquency (payments
being overdue 121 days or more) on
the NDSL is 8.5 per cent this year.
"That is lower than the average
throughout the country," said Jedd.
"University loans have a default rate
around 7 per cent."
Repayment difficulties
"This is not necessarily a lost
amount," Jedd insisted. He cited
some difficulties students can face in
meeting their payment obligations.
Some have trouble finding employ
ment, and others who do work find
that their present commission does
not allow them enough money to
meet the terms of the agreement.
Some just simply try to avoid paying,
according to Jedd.
"If students can document that
they are unable to pay with evidence,
such as copies of their welfare forms
or income tax returns, the govern

ment allows us to grant them a hard
ship deferment. This allows the stu
dents more time to make the pay
ment," Jedd explained.
When students do not provide the
necessary proof or do not stay in con
tact with the Controller's Office, they
are turned over to the Commercial
Collection Agency. The University
deals with collection agencies lo
cated in Oakland and Dallas.
Court action
If the agency is unsuccessful in col
lecting from the student, it will take
the student to court. Judgments usu
ally cover both court costs and the
loaned amount by claiming part of
the students' earnings or property.
The agency retains one-third of this
amount and pays the rest to the Uni
versity, according to |edd.
ledd said the number of delin
quent borrowers increased by 7.4
per cent between 1974 and 1975.
"It happened because we changed
our computer program. It was very
sophisticated and it took some time
for us to adjust. . . . The minute you
stop, the people try to get away," he
said.
In contrast to the 1974-75 increase
in default, 1976 and 1977 percentages
decreased by 9.4 points. )edd attri
buted the lower percentages to his
office personnel's increased familiar
ity with its computer and an enlarged
staff of persons working on defaults.
Bankruptcy
ledd said bankruptcy is the worst
case he deals with.
"Then we can kiss the loan good
bye," he said. "Last year we lost

$71,000 due to bankruptcies."
On Jan. 31, the Houseof Represen
tatives amended the Bankruptcy
Code Revision of 1977. The bill now
bars student loan borrowers from
declaring bankruptcy until five years
after the beginning of the repayment
period, except in cases of severe
hardship. The Senate Subcommittee
on Improvements in Judicial
Machinery held hearings iri
November on a similar bill.
"Stanford is keenly interested in
this legislation," said Larry Horton,
of government relations.
Horton expressed concern about
the acceptability of the loan prog
rams to the public and the Congress.
"The credibility of the loan programs
has been tarnished," Horton said.
"We want to make sure that does not
happen."
According to Jedd, "The main
thing is what people have acquired in
their brains, and that can not be re
possessed."
