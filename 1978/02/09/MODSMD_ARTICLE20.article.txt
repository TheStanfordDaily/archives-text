## Aldo Ciccolini: a master

A recent recital here by
Italian pianist Aldo Cicco
lini came as a welcome
reminder that artists may

their selection of music as

tried, Ciccolini remains
the only pianist success
fully to perform Satie. He
has not, however, re
stricted himself to one
composer. It speaks for
Ciccolini's genius that his
recordings of Chopin,
Debussy and Ravel (to
name a few) have since
outsold those of Satie.
Despite his renown,
Ciccolini has made few
tours outside of Europe.

He simply cannot take the
hassles, he says. When his
hotel reservation ended a
day earlier than expected
he took his bags to the
lobby and sat for several
hours until the Office of
Public Events employee
here chanced upon him.
Ciccolini apologized, say
ing he hadn't wished to
bother anyone.
Yet once on stage his
timidity vanishes. In his
performance at Memorial
Auditorium he displayed
tremendous versatility of
style, an unbelievably fine
touch and a somewhat un
settling "organized crime"
smile. He presented the
audience with new in
terpretations of his Satie
numbers and a rendition
of Chabrier's "Dix Pieces
and Patoresques," which
laid to rest one of the few
criticisms leveled against
him — that he was too
much a virtuoso to play
piano humorously.
In any event, Mr. Cicco
lini was tremendous — so
good, in fact, he should be
assured that next time he
arrives here he'll get a full
reservation at his hotel.
