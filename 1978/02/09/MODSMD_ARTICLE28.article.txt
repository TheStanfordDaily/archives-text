Army troops join in cleanup
With help from Army troops, with equip
ment flown from Midwestern and Southern
states, with shovels and determination, the
Northeast began a massive cleanup yesterday
of the up to 2 feet of snow that buried the
region. In the midst of it, Boston was hit by a
second power failure in two days, this one
stretching over seven hours.
In other areas, roadways remained impassa
ble because of snow or thousands of stranded
vehicles, transportation was slowed and
businesses were closed.
"Even with the Army troops, it's going to be a
long haul," said a spokesman for the governor
of Rhode Island.
The death toll from the storm in the East,
which began Sunday night, 17 days after an
earlier blizzard, was about 50, including 27 vic
tims in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode
Island. There were nine storm-related deaths
in Pennsylvania and more than a dozen in the
New York City area.
Sadat ends talks with Carter
Washington — Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat ended his talks here yesterday without
an immediate decision by President jimmy
Carter to sell him jet fighters. But the United
States leveled new criticism at Israel for send
ing settlers into occupied Arab lands.
"Further settlement activity would be incon
sistent with the effort to reach a peace settle
ment," the White House said after a final meet
ing between the two leaders.
At the same time, it reaffirmed that the U.S.
"will remain faithful to its historic commit
ments to the security of Israel."
Carter, in an emotional farewell, called
Sadat "the world's foremost peacemaker" and
noted the Bible calls peacemakers "the sons of
Cod."
UMW proposed pact doubtful
Charleston, W. Va. — Two United Mine
Workers district leaders said yesterday that a
tentative agreement , with the coal industry
probably will be rejected by the membership,
but UMW President Arnold Miller said he
doesn't think a better contract can be
negotiated.

In fact, Miller said, if union negotiators re
turn to the bargaining table with representa
tives of the Bituminous Coal Operators As
sociation, industry concessions won earlier
may be lost.
The embattled union leader, who returned
to Charleston from negotiating sessions in
Washington, D.C., criticized the UMW bar
gaining council for refusing to act on the prop
osed pact Tuesday.
Senate debates canal rights
Washington — The Senate opened debate
yesterday on the future of the Panama Canal —
a subject one lawmaker called "the most in
tensive foreign policy issue for the United
States since the Vietnam war."
That judgment was offered by Sen. Clifford
Case (R-N.J.) as he joined others in backing a
proposal by the Carter administration to turn
the 64-year-old waterway over to Panama by
the year 2000.
As the politically-charged issue reached the
Senate floor for an expected month or more of
debate, both backers and opponents of the
agreement still were looking for decisive
votes. Neither side had the votes to swing the
outcome their way.
House kills consumer agency
Washington — The House gave business in
terests a major victory yesterday by decisively
defeating a bill to establish a government
agency to advocate consumer viewpoints be
fore federal regulators. The bill was defeated
227 to 181 — and possibly killed for good —
after a long lobbying campaign by major busi
ness groups to defeat it and strong appeals by
consumer groups to pass it.
The bill would have established an agency
with authority to make arguments before fed
eral reguiatory bodies on behalf of consumers.
Although it would have had no regulatory
powers of its own, the consumer agency could
have appealed regulatory decisions it opposed
through the courts.
Gas deregulation debated
Washington — Efforts to break a longstand
ing stalemate over the lifting of federal con
trols on natural gas prices hit a new snag yes

terday as Senate energy conferees disagreed
sharply over terms of a proposed compromise.
The setback in negotiations keeps President
Jimmy Carter's energy plan on ice and raises
doubts that agreement on the gas-pricing por
tion can be reached before Congress returns
from a 10-day mid-February recess, which be
gins Saturday.
Highways wearing out
Washington — The interstate highway net
work is wearing out faster than anyone ex
pected, and may require nearly $19 billion for
repair and rehabilitation through 1995, the
chairman of a congressional watchdog panel
said yesterday.
The gloomy assessment was delivered by
Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.) chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee's over
sight subcommittee.
Inflation increase predicted
Washington — Prices are likely to increase
between 6 to 7 per cent a year for the next
several years unless the government acts to
restrain them, the head of the Carter administ
ration's anti-inflation agency said yesterday.
"The current outlook for inflation is ex
tremely dismal," Barry Bosworth, director of
the Council on Wage and Price Stability, told
the House Budget Committee.
He said the risk that inflation could get even
worse is greater than the possibility it could
improve especially if there is another
economic shock, such as an increase in oil
prices.
"Once we came to accept 6 per cent as nor
mal, the same pressures that drove the rate of
inflation from zero to 6 would inevitably drive
it from 6 up to 10 or even 12 per cent," Bos
worth said.
Hold onto canal: Reagan
Washington — Ronald Reagan, in a point
by-point assault on President Jimmy Carter's
plan to give up control of the Panama Canal,
said last night the cost of such a move "may
one day be our own freedom."
Reagan, a former California governor who
raised the Panama Canal issue in his unsuc
cessful bid for the 1976 Republican presiden
tial nomination, urged the nation to "preserve

our basic rights. We must not shrink from it,
tor the ultimate price we pay may one day he
our own freedom.
"The new treaties would, in a single stroke,
eliminate the foundation on which our right —
and our ability — to permanently use the canal
has been based for more than six decades,''
said Reagan.
Mondanaro regains job
San Francisco — Josette Mondanaro, fired by
the governor over a profanity-filled letter on
state stationery, won her job back as state drug
abuse director yesterday in a ruling by the state
Personnel Board.
The board voted 4-1 to accept the reinstate
ment recommendation of hearing officer
lames Waller, who took five days of testimony
last month in her appeal.
"I think it's good news. I'm really happy,"
said the 32-year-old pediatrician. She said she
wanted to return to her $42,000-a-year job "as
soon as possible."
Gov. Edmund Brown )r. said he would not
appeal the board's ruling and had no comment
on Waller's recommendation.
Brown met with Dr. Mondanaro and other
state officials for 90 minutes after the board
decision and determined she would resume
her job Thursday morning, his press secretary
said.

Sadat ends talks with Carter
Washington — Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat ended his talks here yesterday without
an immediate decision by President jimmy
Carter to sell him jet fighters. But the United
States leveled new criticism at Israel for send
ing settlers into occupied Arab lands.
"Further settlement activity would be incon
sistent with the effort to reach a peace settle
ment," the White House said after a final meet
ing between the two leaders.
At the same time, it reaffirmed that the U.S.
"will remain faithful to its historic commit
ments to the security of Israel."
Carter, in an emotional farewell, called
Sadat "the world's foremost peacemaker" and
noted the Bible calls peacemakers "the sons of
Cod."
UMW proposed pact doubtful
Charleston, W. Va. — Two United Mine
Workers district leaders said yesterday that a
tentative agreement , with the coal industry
probably will be rejected by the membership,
but UMW President Arnold Miller said he
doesn't think a better contract can be
negotiated.

In fact, Miller said, if union negotiators re
turn to the bargaining table with representa
tives of the Bituminous Coal Operators As
sociation, industry concessions won earlier
may be lost.
The embattled union leader, who returned
to Charleston from negotiating sessions in
Washington, D.C., criticized the UMW bar
gaining council for refusing to act on the prop
osed pact Tuesday.
Senate debates canal rights
Washington — The Senate opened debate
yesterday on the future of the Panama Canal —
a subject one lawmaker called "the most in
tensive foreign policy issue for the United
States since the Vietnam war."
That judgment was offered by Sen. Clifford
Case (R-N.J.) as he joined others in backing a
proposal by the Carter administration to turn
the 64-year-old waterway over to Panama by
the year 2000.
As the politically-charged issue reached the
Senate floor for an expected month or more of
debate, both backers and opponents of the
agreement still were looking for decisive
votes. Neither side had the votes to swing the
outcome their way.
House kills consumer agency
Washington — The House gave business in
terests a major victory yesterday by decisively
defeating a bill to establish a government
agency to advocate consumer viewpoints be
fore federal regulators. The bill was defeated
227 to 181 — and possibly killed for good —
after a long lobbying campaign by major busi
ness groups to defeat it and strong appeals by
consumer groups to pass it.
The bill would have established an agency
with authority to make arguments before fed
eral reguiatory bodies on behalf of consumers.
Although it would have had no regulatory
powers of its own, the consumer agency could
have appealed regulatory decisions it opposed
through the courts.
Gas deregulation debated
Washington — Efforts to break a longstand
ing stalemate over the lifting of federal con
trols on natural gas prices hit a new snag yes

terday as Senate energy conferees disagreed
sharply over terms of a proposed compromise.
The setback in negotiations keeps President
Jimmy Carter's energy plan on ice and raises
doubts that agreement on the gas-pricing por
tion can be reached before Congress returns
from a 10-day mid-February recess, which be
gins Saturday.
Highways wearing out
Washington — The interstate highway net
work is wearing out faster than anyone ex
pected, and may require nearly $19 billion for
repair and rehabilitation through 1995, the
chairman of a congressional watchdog panel
said yesterday.
The gloomy assessment was delivered by
Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.) chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee's over
sight subcommittee.
Inflation increase predicted
Washington — Prices are likely to increase
between 6 to 7 per cent a year for the next
several years unless the government acts to
restrain them, the head of the Carter administ
ration's anti-inflation agency said yesterday.
"The current outlook for inflation is ex
tremely dismal," Barry Bosworth, director of
the Council on Wage and Price Stability, told
the House Budget Committee.
He said the risk that inflation could get even
worse is greater than the possibility it could
improve especially if there is another
economic shock, such as an increase in oil
prices.
"Once we came to accept 6 per cent as nor
mal, the same pressures that drove the rate of
inflation from zero to 6 would inevitably drive
it from 6 up to 10 or even 12 per cent," Bos
worth said.
Hold onto canal: Reagan
Washington — Ronald Reagan, in a point
by-point assault on President Jimmy Carter's
plan to give up control of the Panama Canal,
said last night the cost of such a move "may
one day be our own freedom."
Reagan, a former California governor who
raised the Panama Canal issue in his unsuc
cessful bid for the 1976 Republican presiden
tial nomination, urged the nation to "preserve

our basic rights. We must not shrink from it,
tor the ultimate price we pay may one day he
our own freedom.
"The new treaties would, in a single stroke,
eliminate the foundation on which our right —
and our ability — to permanently use the canal
has been based for more than six decades,''
said Reagan.
Mondanaro regains job
San Francisco — Josette Mondanaro, fired by
the governor over a profanity-filled letter on
state stationery, won her job back as state drug
abuse director yesterday in a ruling by the state
Personnel Board.
The board voted 4-1 to accept the reinstate
ment recommendation of hearing officer
lames Waller, who took five days of testimony
last month in her appeal.
"I think it's good news. I'm really happy,"
said the 32-year-old pediatrician. She said she
wanted to return to her $42,000-a-year job "as
soon as possible."
Gov. Edmund Brown )r. said he would not
appeal the board's ruling and had no comment

Army troops join in cleanup
With help from Army troops, with equip
ment flown from Midwestern and Southern
states, with shovels and determination, the
Northeast began a massive cleanup yesterday
of the up to 2 feet of snow that buried the
region. In the midst of it, Boston was hit by a
second power failure in two days, this one
stretching over seven hours.
In other areas, roadways remained impassa

vehicles, transportation was slowed and
businesses were closed.
"Even with the Army troops, it's going to be a
long haul," said a spokesman for the governor
of Rhode Island.
The death toll from the storm in the East,
which began Sunday night, 17 days after an

doesn't think a better contract can be
negotiated.

In fact, Miller said, if union negotiators re
turn to the bargaining table with representa

sociation, industry concessions won earlier
may be lost.
The embattled union leader, who returned
to Charleston from negotiating sessions in
Washington, D.C., criticized the UMW bar
gaining council for refusing to act on the prop
osed pact Tuesday.
Senate debates canal rights
Washington — The Senate opened debate
yesterday on the future of the Panama Canal —
a subject one lawmaker called "the most in
tensive foreign policy issue for the United
States since the Vietnam war."
That judgment was offered by Sen. Clifford
Case (R-N.J.) as he joined others in backing a
proposal by the Carter administration to turn
the 64-year-old waterway over to Panama by
the year 2000.
As the politically-charged issue reached the
Senate floor for an expected month or more of
debate, both backers and opponents of the
agreement still were looking for decisive
votes. Neither side had the votes to swing the
outcome their way.
House kills consumer agency
Washington — The House gave business in
terests a major victory yesterday by decisively
defeating a bill to establish a government
agency to advocate consumer viewpoints be
fore federal regulators. The bill was defeated
227 to 181 — and possibly killed for good —
after a long lobbying campaign by major busi
ness groups to defeat it and strong appeals by
consumer groups to pass it.
The bill would have established an agency
with authority to make arguments before fed
eral reguiatory bodies on behalf of consumers.
Although it would have had no regulatory
powers of its own, the consumer agency could
have appealed regulatory decisions it opposed
through the courts.
Gas deregulation debated
Washington — Efforts to break a longstand
ing stalemate over the lifting of federal con
trols on natural gas prices hit a new snag yes

terday as Senate energy conferees disagreed
sharply over terms of a proposed compromise.
The setback in negotiations keeps President
Jimmy Carter's energy plan on ice and raises
doubts that agreement on the gas-pricing por
tion can be reached before Congress returns
from a 10-day mid-February recess, which be
gins Saturday.
Highways wearing out
Washington — The interstate highway net
work is wearing out faster than anyone ex
pected, and may require nearly $19 billion for
repair and rehabilitation through 1995, the
chairman of a congressional watchdog panel
said yesterday.
The gloomy assessment was delivered by
Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.) chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee's over
sight subcommittee.
Inflation increase predicted
Washington — Prices are likely to increase
between 6 to 7 per cent a year for the next
several years unless the government acts to
restrain them, the head of the Carter administ
ration's anti-inflation agency said yesterday.
"The current outlook for inflation is ex
tremely dismal," Barry Bosworth, director of
the Council on Wage and Price Stability, told
the House Budget Committee.
He said the risk that inflation could get even
worse is greater than the possibility it could
improve especially if there is another
economic shock, such as an increase in oil
prices.
"Once we came to accept 6 per cent as nor
mal, the same pressures that drove the rate of
inflation from zero to 6 would inevitably drive
it from 6 up to 10 or even 12 per cent," Bos
worth said.
Hold onto canal: Reagan
Washington — Ronald Reagan, in a point
by-point assault on President Jimmy Carter's
plan to give up control of the Panama Canal,
said last night the cost of such a move "may
one day be our own freedom."
Reagan, a former California governor who
raised the Panama Canal issue in his unsuc
cessful bid for the 1976 Republican presiden
tial nomination, urged the nation to "preserve

our basic rights. We must not shrink from it,
tor the ultimate price we pay may one day he
our own freedom.
"The new treaties would, in a single stroke,
eliminate the foundation on which our right —
and our ability — to permanently use the canal
has been based for more than six decades,''
said Reagan.
Mondanaro regains job

the governor over a profanity-filled letter on
state stationery, won her job back as state drug
abuse director yesterday in a ruling by the state
Personnel Board.

ment recommendation of hearing officer
lames Waller, who took five days of testimony
last month in her appeal.
"I think it's good news. I'm really happy,"
said the 32-year-old pediatrician. She said she
wanted to return to her $42,000-a-year job "as
soon as possible."
Gov. Edmund Brown )r. said he would not
appeal the board's ruling and had no comment
on Waller's recommendation.
Brown met with Dr. Mondanaro and other

Army troops join in cleanup
With help from Army troops, with equip
ment flown from Midwestern and Southern
states, with shovels and determination, the
Northeast began a massive cleanup yesterday
of the up to 2 feet of snow that buried the
region. In the midst of it, Boston was hit by a
second power failure in two days, this one
stretching over seven hours.
In other areas, roadways remained impassa
ble because of snow or thousands of stranded
vehicles, transportation was slowed and
businesses were closed.
"Even with the Army troops, it's going to be a
long haul," said a spokesman for the governor
of Rhode Island.
The death toll from the storm in the East,
which began Sunday night, 17 days after an
earlier blizzard, was about 50, including 27 vic
tims in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode
Island. There were nine storm-related deaths
in Pennsylvania and more than a dozen in the
New York City area.
Sadat ends talks with Carter
Washington — Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat ended his talks here yesterday without
an immediate decision by President jimmy
Carter to sell him jet fighters. But the United
States leveled new criticism at Israel for send
ing settlers into occupied Arab lands.
"Further settlement activity would be incon
sistent with the effort to reach a peace settle
ment," the White House said after a final meet
ing between the two leaders.
At the same time, it reaffirmed that the U.S.
"will remain faithful to its historic commit
ments to the security of Israel."
Carter, in an emotional farewell, called
Sadat "the world's foremost peacemaker" and
noted the Bible calls peacemakers "the sons of
Cod."
