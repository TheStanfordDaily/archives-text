# East Timor warring threatens to expand

Warfare in East Timor could spread
throughout the other islands of In
donesia unless the Indonesian gov
ernment withdraws from its occupa
tion of the island, a United Nations
representative told about 50 students
in Annenberg Auditorium Tuesday
night.
lose Ramos Horta, U.N. represen
tative of the Democratic Republic of
East Timor and a leading member of
East Timor's guerrilla movement,
Fretelin (Revolutionary Front for the
Independence of Eastern Timor),
spoke with Don Luce on "The U.S. is
down but not out: Southeast Asia
after Vietnam."
Luce, a Vietnam anti-war activist,
discussed human rights in the
Philippines, Thailand and Iran, while
Horta concentrated on the situation
in East Timor.
For 400 years prior to 1975, East
Timor was a colony of Portugal. With
the collapse of Portuguese
hegemony in Angola and Mozam
bique came the opportunity for East
Timor to claim independence from
Portugal.
In August 1975 the forces of Frete
lin took over the island and estab
lished the Democratic Republic of
East Timor on November 28, 1975.
On December 7, 24 hours after
Henry Kissinger and Gerald Ford had
left Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, the
U.S.-equipped forces of Indonesia
invaded East Timor. Horta claimed
that the Indonesian army massacred
50,000 to 100,000 Timorese, while the
Indonesians themselves lost bet

ween 10,000 to 20,000.
Repeated condemnation
In spite of repeated condemnation
by the General Assembly and the
Security Council of the United Na
tions, Indonesia continues to occupy
East Timor, controlling the capital,
Dili, and other towns. Horta claimed
however that 85 per cent of East
Timor has been liberated by Fretelin
and that 90 to 95 per cent of the popu
lation live in this independent area.
In explaining the policies of Frete
lin, Horta denied that his organiza
tion was basically Communist, as
serting that "We are East Timorese
patriots" and that "most of the lead
ership within Fretelin have a Catholic
background.
Intervention 'counterproductive'
Horta criticized U.S. support of
Indonesian intervention, saying
America is being self seeking and
"counterproductive." He accused
the U.S. of denying independence to
East Timor for reasons of global
strategy because it fears that an in
dependent East Timor could compli
cate the movements of the U.S.
Pacific fleet.
The real danger to America lies,
Horta asserted, in the spread of re
volution to other parts of Indonesia.
If the U.S. does not encourage the
lakarta government to grant inde
pendence to East Timor, Indonesia
might well fragment, Horta claims.
This fragmentation would proba
bly have more of an effect on Ameri
can global strategy than would an in
dependent East Timor, Horta con
cluded.
