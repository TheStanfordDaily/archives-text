# Police nab suspect in Hillside murders
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — A "very religi
ous" Hollywood actor, who police at
first didn't take seriously, was ar
rested yesterday in the Hillside
Strangler case after he provided in
vestigators with "enough probable
cause to book him," police said.
A balding, mustachioed Ned Terr
ence York, 37, told police he knew
kristina Weckler, the ninth victim in
the series of strangulation murders
that began last September, a police
source said. Though York was being
investigated forall 12 of the murders,
he was booked under Weckler's case
number.
York, 6-foot-4 and 240 pounds,
played mostly small roles in televi
sion shows. His last known appear
ance came earlier this month in a
rerun episode of the hit ABC series,
"Starsky and Hutch."
York also was closely associated
with the Hollywood Free Theater, a
Baptist-sponsored group that pre
sents religious plays. The actor had
been set to appear in a production
there last night entitled "Let Your
Spirit Shine."
'Very religious'
Bill Devroe, head of the talent
agency that used to handle York, said
the actor "was very religious, every
thing was 'God bless you' and )esus
Loves You.'
"He was one of the nicest people
we had," Devroe recalled. "As he
walked out the door, he always said
God Bless You.' "
The autumn murder of Weck
ler, 20, had been particularly puzzl
ing to investigators because, unlike
most of the other victims, she was
apparently not connected with the
Hollywood street scene. She at
tended an exclusive art school in
Pasadena and lived in a quiet cour
tyard apartment in nearby Glendale,
where she seldom received visitors,
her neighbors said.
Weckler was found nude and
strangled Nov. 20 on a residential
hillside a few miles from her apart
ment.
York was arrested at his Hollywood
Hills home after telephoning police
and telling them he had information
about the Hillside Strangler case.

"He made certain statements that
provided investigators enough cause
to make the arrest," Assistant Police
Chief Daryl Gates said at a hastily cal
led news conference.
When arrested, York was wearing
a bathing suit and an arm sling, exp
laining to the officers that he'd been
hurt in a scuffle with his dog.
'A nice person'
A neighbor, Juan Lazcano, de
scribed York as a "normal man, a
nice person." He said York was mar
ried.
After York called police yesterday
morning and rambled incoherently
about the much publicized strangler
case, he was taken to headquarters
and fell asleep during questioning,
police said.
At that time police Cmdr. William
Booth said, "This is rapidly develop
ing into nothing."
But, Booth said later, "When they
called him (York) down and got him
upstairs, that's when he started talk
ing."
Booth would not reveal what in
formation it was that prompted
police to book York.
"Don't get too excited about this
closing the book on the whole inves
tigation," Booth said. At the news
conference, Gates said, "I caution
everyone not to have their expecta
tions raised too high."
Probable cause
But Booth said, "Probable cause
was developed" before York was ar
rested. "There were definite reasons
for taking this action."
The arrest came one day after
police released part of the contents
of a six-page hand-written letter sent
last month to Mayor Tom Bradley and
appealed again for the strangler to
surrender.
Police had said they were not sure
whether the letter was authored by
the strangler, but Bradley promised
the author full protection should the
person turn himself in.
York apparently did not write the
letter, police said.
The body of the first victim was
discovered Sept. 9 and the last was
found Dec. 14, one day after the vic
tim was killed.

the author full protection should the
person turn himself in.
York apparently did not write the
letter, police said.
The body of the first victim was
discovered Sept. 9 and the last was
found Dec. 14, one day after the vic
tim was killed.
Los Angeles (AP) — A "very religi
ous" Hollywood actor, who police at
first didn't take seriously, was ar
rested yesterday in the Hillside
Strangler case after he provided in
vestigators with "enough probable
cause to book him," police said.
A balding, mustachioed Ned Terr
ence York, 37, told police he knew
kristina Weckler, the ninth victim in
the series of strangulation murders
that began last September, a police
source said. Though York was being
investigated forall 12 of the murders,
he was booked under Weckler's case
number.
York, 6-foot-4 and 240 pounds,
played mostly small roles in televi
sion shows. His last known appear
ance came earlier this month in a
rerun episode of the hit ABC series,
"Starsky and Hutch."
York also was closely associated
with the Hollywood Free Theater, a
Baptist-sponsored group that pre
sents religious plays. The actor had
been set to appear in a production
there last night entitled "Let Your
Spirit Shine."
'Very religious'
Bill Devroe, head of the talent
agency that used to handle York, said
the actor "was very religious, every
thing was 'God bless you' and )esus
Loves You.'
"He was one of the nicest people
we had," Devroe recalled. "As he
walked out the door, he always said
God Bless You.' "
The autumn murder of Weck
ler, 20, had been particularly puzzl
ing to investigators because, unlike
most of the other victims, she was
apparently not connected with the
Hollywood street scene. She at
tended an exclusive art school in
Pasadena and lived in a quiet cour
tyard apartment in nearby Glendale,
where she seldom received visitors,
her neighbors said.
Weckler was found nude and
strangled Nov. 20 on a residential
hillside a few miles from her apart
ment.
York was arrested at his Hollywood
Hills home after telephoning police
and telling them he had information
about the Hillside Strangler case.

"He made certain statements that
provided investigators enough cause
to make the arrest," Assistant Police
Chief Daryl Gates said at a hastily cal
led news conference.
When arrested, York was wearing
a bathing suit and an arm sling, exp
laining to the officers that he'd been
hurt in a scuffle with his dog.
'A nice person'
A neighbor, Juan Lazcano, de
scribed York as a "normal man, a
nice person." He said York was mar
ried.
After York called police yesterday
morning and rambled incoherently
about the much publicized strangler
case, he was taken to headquarters
and fell asleep during questioning,
police said.
At that time police Cmdr. William
Booth said, "This is rapidly develop
ing into nothing."
But, Booth said later, "When they
called him (York) down and got him
upstairs, that's when he started talk
ing."
Booth would not reveal what in
formation it was that prompted
police to book York.
"Don't get too excited about this
closing the book on the whole inves
tigation," Booth said. At the news
conference, Gates said, "I caution
everyone not to have their expecta
tions raised too high."
Probable cause
But Booth said, "Probable cause
was developed" before York was ar
rested. "There were definite reasons
for taking this action."
The arrest came one day after
police released part of the contents
of a six-page hand-written letter sent
last month to Mayor Tom Bradley and
appealed again for the strangler to
surrender.
Police had said they were not sure
whether the letter was authored by
the strangler, but Bradley promised
the author full protection should the
person turn himself in.
York apparently did not write the
letter, police said.
