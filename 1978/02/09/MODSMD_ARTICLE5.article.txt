# $1.2 billion requested
## College aid package unveiled 
### 
Washington (AP) — President
jimmy Carter called upon Congress
yesterday to provide a record $1.2
billion in new aid to college students,
including $250 grants to at least two
million students from families with
gross incomes between $16,500 and
$25,000.
"No one should be denied the op
portunity for a college education for
financial reasons alone," the presi
dent declared as he unveiled an aid
package designed to head off moves
in Congress to provide tax credits of
$250 or more to parents of all college
students, regardless of income.
In addition to making two million

students from middle-income
families eligible for direct federal
grants for the first time, the Carter
plan also would provide subsidized
loans to students with family in
comes as high as $45,000 before
taxes, and expand federally sub
sidized work-study programs.
The extra money would be availa
ble for the school year starting in the
fall of 1979. Students in families with
incomes below $25,000 would apply
individually to the government for
the grants as part of the Basic Educa
tional Opportunity Grant Program.
Grants are credited directly to stu
dents' accounts at the colleges.

Carter wants to add $1 billion to
the $2.16 billion basic grant program,
which now aids 2.2 million students
primarily from low-income families.
The president already proposed
$250 million in extra student aid last
month. The entire $1.46 billion pac
kage would boost federal spending
on college student aid programs in
fiscal 1979 to $5.2 billion, an increase
of almost 40 per cent.
Carter said more than five million
college students could get federal
aid in the school year starting in the
fall of 1979, an increase of at least two
million.
Senate reactions
Rep. William Ford (D-Mich.), who
heads the House Education and
Labor subcommittee on higher edu
cation, called it"the biggest single
infusion of funding for middle
income college students since the
adoption of the Gl bill at the end of
World War II."
Five other leaders of House and
Senate committees that handle edu
cation legislation joined Carter and
Health, Education and Welfare Sec
retary Joseph Califano Jr. at the
White House for the announcement
of the program.
The six lawmakers all hailed the
administration's proposal, but some
later expressed reservation about
limiting the grants to $250 for all stu
dents in the $16,000 to $25,000 range.
On Capitol Hill, Sen. William Roth
(R-Del.), author of the $250 college
tuition tax credit bill, said the Carter
proposal was "a desperate, last ditch
attempt to derail the college tax cre
dit, but it won't work."

In addition to making two million

students from middle-income
families eligible for direct federal
grants for the first time, the Carter
plan also would provide subsidized
loans to students with family in
comes as high as $45,000 before
taxes, and expand federally sub
sidized work-study programs.
The extra money would be availa
ble for the school year starting in the
fall of 1979. Students in families with
incomes below $25,000 would apply
individually to the government for
the grants as part of the Basic Educa
tional Opportunity Grant Program.
Grants are credited directly to stu
dents' accounts at the colleges.

Carter wants to add $1 billion to
the $2.16 billion basic grant program,
which now aids 2.2 million students
primarily from low-income families.
The president already proposed
$250 million in extra student aid last
month. The entire $1.46 billion pac
kage would boost federal spending
on college student aid programs in
fiscal 1979 to $5.2 billion, an increase
of almost 40 per cent.
Carter said more than five million
college students could get federal
aid in the school year starting in the
fall of 1979, an increase of at least two
million.
Senate reactions
Rep. William Ford (D-Mich.), who
heads the House Education and
Labor subcommittee on higher edu
cation, called it"the biggest single
infusion of funding for middle
income college students since the
adoption of the Gl bill at the end of
World War II."
Five other leaders of House and
Senate committees that handle edu
cation legislation joined Carter and
Health, Education and Welfare Sec
retary Joseph Califano Jr. at the
White House for the announcement
of the program.
The six lawmakers all hailed the
administration's proposal, but some
later expressed reservation about
limiting the grants to $250 for all stu
dents in the $16,000 to $25,000 range.
On Capitol Hill, Sen. William Roth
(R-Del.), author of the $250 college
tuition tax credit bill, said the Carter
proposal was "a desperate, last ditch
attempt to derail the college tax cre
dit, but it won't work."
