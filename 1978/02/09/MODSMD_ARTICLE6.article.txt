# Energy consumption decreases markedly
## 
### Jonathan Slater 
Energy consumption among Uni
versity residences has declined by
over 20 per rent from last year, ac
cording to Karl Johnson, director of
the Energy Conservation Center
(ECC) here.
The Center has been conducting
conservation programs in the dorms
since last January. The programs in
clude placing charts detailing daily
electric use in food service lines so
that students can see tangible results
from their efforts to save energy.
Florence Moore Hall and Lagunita
Court have sustained reductions of
over 30 per cent since January 1977,
an amount which Johnson terms as
"quite remarkable." He credits
much of these reductions to an in
creased awareness of conservation
methods among students.
The ECC's most recent major pro
ject has been the insulating of Phi Psi
and Hammarskjold houses. Three
weeks ago, 134 bags of insulation
were installed between the third
floor ceiling and the attic at Phi Psi.
The project covered 4400 square feet
and cost $1600.
Consumption dropped
Electric and natural gas consump
tion dropped by 37 per cent for the
first week following the project's
completion. This decline "really
seemed odd" to Johnson who esti

mated a probable savings of only 23
per cent. He did add that an eight to
10 hour electrical failure must have
contributed somewhat to this reduc
tion.
A further surprise arose when sec
ond week figures showed a return to
the pre-)anuary 13 level of consump
tion. Figures for the third week have
not yet been determined, lohnson
does not know the reason for the
fluctuation, but insists that monthly
statistics will be much more reveal
ing.
At Hammarskjold House, the
Center insulated the attic using a re
cycled cellulose fiber which Johnson
feels is more effective per inch than
fiberglass. This process creates a
dead air space which contains heat
and saves energy. Because electricity
is the primary heating source for the
third floor, )ohnson predicts yearly
savings of $705. The project cost
$850-900.
As for the future, lohnson intends
to employ student labor in an exten
sive project that would involve in
sulating all the Row houses and many
of the dorms by this fall. The ECC is
also installing a solar water heater for
Roth House.
The Center is operated under the
authority of Ed Scoles, director of
University Housing.

product design division here in 1977,
has been working with the Center for
over a year and a half and has served
