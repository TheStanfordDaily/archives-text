# Energy consumption decreases markedly

Energy consumption among Uni
versity residences has declined by
over 20 per rent from last year, ac
cording to Karl Johnson, director of
the Energy Conservation Center
(ECC) here.
The Center has been conducting
conservation programs in the dorms
since last January. The programs in
clude placing charts detailing daily
electric use in food service lines so
that students can see tangible results
from their efforts to save energy.
Florence Moore Hall and Lagunita
Court have sustained reductions of
over 30 per cent since January 1977,
an amount which Johnson terms as
"quite remarkable." He credits
much of these reductions to an in
creased awareness of conservation
methods among students.
The ECC's most recent major pro
ject has been the insulating of Phi Psi
and Hammarskjold houses. Three
weeks ago, 134 bags of insulation
were installed between the third
floor ceiling and the attic at Phi Psi.
The project covered 4400 square feet
and cost $1600.
Consumption dropped
Electric and natural gas consump
tion dropped by 37 per cent for the
first week following the project's
completion. This decline "really
seemed odd" to Johnson who esti

mated a probable savings of only 23
per cent. He did add that an eight to
10 hour electrical failure must have
contributed somewhat to this reduc
tion.
A further surprise arose when sec
ond week figures showed a return to
the pre-)anuary 13 level of consump
tion. Figures for the third week have
not yet been determined, lohnson
does not know the reason for the
fluctuation, but insists that monthly
statistics will be much more reveal
ing.
