# Senate asks trustees for meeting next week

### Sara Lessley 
After calling a special ASSU Senate
meeting, senate criticism of a Com
mission on Investment Responsibil
ity (CIR) resolution caused the mea
sure's withdrawal last night. The se
nate did pass, by a narrow margin,
another CIR-rHated resolution.
Sen. Lynn Rubinett sponsored a
motion calling for a meeting next
week among the senate, ASSU
Council ot Presidents, President
Richard Lyman and the Board of Trus
tees, either in San Francisco or on
campus, depending on the trustees'
preference.
The vote tied at 6-6, with the decid
ing vote cast by the chair in favor of
Rubmett's resolution.
Severe criticism of the "CIR special
action" resolution introduced by
Sen. John Pavel caused him to with
draw it after an hour of debate.
Pavel said his resolution was "an
attempt to set up a position for
reasonable negotiation" with the
administration and trustees.
Pavel's resolution called for the
newly-selected student members of
the CIR to "refrain from statements
which might be interpreted as repre
senting the opinion" of the entire
student body.

The resolution also asked that re
ports from ClR's meetings be made
available 1o the senate, and called for
a meeting among Lyman, the senate
and at least four trustee members, in
a public forum.
Objections to the measure were
numerous.
Sen. Tom McCormack said he
thought the senate "exercised re
markable restraint" in last week's ac
tion asking the administration to wait
on the CIR selection process until the
senate could discuss the issue with
the administration.
McCormack added, however, that
the University's "complete refusal to
wait" on that selection process was
"high-handed action" and he could
not "support a resolution that even
slightly supported the administration
position."
Concern was also voiced about
Rubinett's proposal.
Sen. Al Miner said if the senate
meets with the trustees, "we've got
to go with an open frame of mind.
"We've got to be willing to bar
gain, not just clarify statements," he
added.
The special meeting, called by
Chairperson Fred Crethel, just
barely made quorum. Eleven to four
teen senators attended.
