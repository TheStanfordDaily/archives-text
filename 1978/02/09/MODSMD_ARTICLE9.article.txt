On a rustic campus in the near fu
ture:
"Uh ... Hi there. Didn't I see you
in lab last Saturday, miss? Re
member, I let you have my place in
line at the spectrometer?"
"Urn . . . Oh yea, yea, you were
the guy who had sulfuric acid poured
into your backpack."
"Not exactly. That was my ex-lab
partner. But you're close. I'm Mel
vin. Say, I just happened to glance at
your answers to last week's problem
set and was wondering if you wanted
to do some computing this
weekend?"
"|ust for the record, I'm Nellie,
and frankly, my Texas instrument is
on the blink."
"Who's Frank?"
"Huh?"
"Ahem, . . . uh, it just so happens
I'm an electronics buff, and I'd love
to fiddle with your keyboard. I've got
just the right tool for adjusting your
input processor."
"Well Mel, I . . . uh, sure. Why
not?"
"Fine, we can grab our meals and
eat them in your room. No sense
wasting any time. Oh, make sure you
charge up that little mathbox be
forehand; it's easier to work on if it's
warm."
"Swell. See you around dinner
time on Friday."
The above conversation charac
terizes a prospective subculture of
the nerd kind. Members share a
paranoia based on the fear that ad
missions policies intentionally dis
favor them.
Our desires to liquidate people
like Mel and Nel just push them
closer to the above scenario; con
tinual hatred only causes them to
seek fellow nerds more feverishly.
By uniting them against a common

foe, namely us, their stronghold on
academic life becomes more en
trenched. This allows them to strike
back by demanding that the chemis
try department boost their catering
service to pre-meds, for instance.
Rather, freshly diagnosing nerds as
psychologically insecure beings (as
opposed to terminally antisocialitic
fungi) opens the way for a new, sub
tler treatment. TLC (Tender loving
care, not thin layer chromatography)
is what these fearful people need.
Only through our consolation can
we hope to clear their blurred vision
of campus life by focusing their at
tention away from mirages of thick
envelopes.
What more profitable tradeoff
than to have them help us "peak"
our exams? (Reader's note on nerd
lingo: A "peak" is an A. Vou get
"mounded" with a B. AC is a viscious
"hook," and being "dumped" refers
to a D.) We can reciprocate by
cooperatively culturing them in the
ways and means of the social scenes.
Let me clarify my intent with some
Do's and Don'ts.
Do NOT:
—Form Motobecane vigilante troops
to mow down people with calculator
holsters on their belts
—Drop a dictionary on a shaving
cream-filled envelope that has been
slipped under their study cubical
door.
—Attach fly-paper to old exams.
—Replace their favorite calculator
brochures by sneaking the real fold
outs back into their Playboys (or
Playgirls).
—Invite them to "Niffty Fifties"
sock-hops and forget to mention the
freshly-waxed dance floor.
—Kidnap them and hang them from
Sather Gate; Cal is infested with
numerous nerd cults. Our dangling
nerds would easily be rescued, and
you may find yourself brewing in a

test tube.
—Major in biology in hopes of con
verting them. The majority of nerds
are presently posing as social science
majors. This trend represents their
efforts to fool admissions boards into
thinking they are "well-rounded, lit
erate" people.
These measures could easily
catalyze them toward doing some
thing radical, like collectively rush
ing one fraternity and then having
pledges plant "anti-Delt" mines
(triggered automatically by anything
weighing over 240 pounds).
Or more deviously, they might rig
the housing lottery computers, so
every beautiful girl gets a guaranteed
off-campus slot.
Cure for nerds
Instead, the following ideas offer a
more effective nerd-therapy.
Do:
—Throw a post-exam "megakegger"
funded by lab deposit rebates. This
obviously provides incentives for
saving on glassware etc. Our atten
tiveness would encourage them to
chat about more than extra credit
solutions and science fiction
plausabilities. Only by developing
communication can we hope to
nurse them back to health.
—Sponsor them in a fashion show
If Britain fancied pimpish Punk,
they'll line up in droves for nostalgic
Nerd. )ust look at Elvis Costello.
—Set-up coaching clinics to build
their confidence in sports. For
example, beginning cyclists could
culminate their training by pedaling
their clunkers up La Honda road, and
having a problem set luncheon on
Skyline Blvd. Then, all would race
back down as a final exam.
—Help them throw spitwads at the
Dollies while the Band is playing on
UCLY's second floor. By temporarily
joining their forces we can infiltrate
their intricate communications net

work. Only then can we begin to
challenge their pervasive "gospel of
the grade.''
ABC helicopter crews could tele
vise the event. After-race interviews
would introduce these nerds
turned-superstars to the thrill and
agony of commercialized sports. The
University could solicit conglomer
ates in South Africa to sponsor the
event. A feature film clip during pre
race coverage could highlight cur
rent construction around campus,
especially student housing.
Finally, winners would receive a
full scholarship for Howard Cosell's
Institue of Commentating Etiquette,
and would be invited to handle fu
ture play-by-plays.
As you can imagine, the alterna
tives within the TLC treatment
framework simply abound. Begin by
taking a nerd to a rock concert. . .
"Close Encounters" is an open
ended series eagerly awaiting your
continuing scenarios. Barbie Fields
and I warmly appreciate your re
sponses to this, as well as your com
ments on general campus lifestyle is
sues (e.g. creative dating methods,
dorm bloopers, cosmic California
lingo, full-moon-in-the-Quad high
lights, etc.)
We're dedicated to helping you
amuse yourselves, as well as to aiding
discussion of more serious topics.

On a rustic campus in the near fu
ture:
"Uh ... Hi there. Didn't I see you
in lab last Saturday, miss? Re
member, I let you have my place in
line at the spectrometer?"
"Urn . . . Oh yea, yea, you were
the guy who had sulfuric acid poured
into your backpack."
"Not exactly. That was my ex-lab
partner. But you're close. I'm Mel
vin. Say, I just happened to glance at
your answers to last week's problem
set and was wondering if you wanted
to do some computing this
weekend?"
"|ust for the record, I'm Nellie,
and frankly, my Texas instrument is
on the blink."
"Who's Frank?"
"Huh?"
"Ahem, . . . uh, it just so happens
I'm an electronics buff, and I'd love
to fiddle with your keyboard. I've got
just the right tool for adjusting your
input processor."
"Well Mel, I . . . uh, sure. Why
not?"
"Fine, we can grab our meals and
eat them in your room. No sense
wasting any time. Oh, make sure you
charge up that little mathbox be
forehand; it's easier to work on if it's
warm."
"Swell. See you around dinner
time on Friday."
The above conversation charac
terizes a prospective subculture of
the nerd kind. Members share a
paranoia based on the fear that ad
missions policies intentionally dis
favor them.
Our desires to liquidate people
like Mel and Nel just push them
closer to the above scenario; con
tinual hatred only causes them to
seek fellow nerds more feverishly.
By uniting them against a common

foe, namely us, their stronghold on
academic life becomes more en
trenched. This allows them to strike
back by demanding that the chemis
try department boost their catering
service to pre-meds, for instance.
Rather, freshly diagnosing nerds as
psychologically insecure beings (as
opposed to terminally antisocialitic
fungi) opens the way for a new, sub
tler treatment. TLC (Tender loving
care, not thin layer chromatography)
is what these fearful people need.
Only through our consolation can
we hope to clear their blurred vision
of campus life by focusing their at
tention away from mirages of thick
envelopes.
What more profitable tradeoff
than to have them help us "peak"
our exams? (Reader's note on nerd
lingo: A "peak" is an A. Vou get
"mounded" with a B. AC is a viscious
"hook," and being "dumped" refers
to a D.) We can reciprocate by
cooperatively culturing them in the
ways and means of the social scenes.
Let me clarify my intent with some
Do's and Don'ts.
Do NOT:
—Form Motobecane vigilante troops
to mow down people with calculator
holsters on their belts
—Drop a dictionary on a shaving
cream-filled envelope that has been
slipped under their study cubical
door.
—Attach fly-paper to old exams.
—Replace their favorite calculator
brochures by sneaking the real fold
outs back into their Playboys (or
Playgirls).
—Invite them to "Niffty Fifties"
sock-hops and forget to mention the
freshly-waxed dance floor.
—Kidnap them and hang them from
Sather Gate; Cal is infested with
numerous nerd cults. Our dangling
nerds would easily be rescued, and
you may find yourself brewing in a

test tube.
—Major in biology in hopes of con
verting them. The majority of nerds
are presently posing as social science
majors. This trend represents their
efforts to fool admissions boards into
thinking they are "well-rounded, lit
erate" people.
These measures could easily
catalyze them toward doing some
thing radical, like collectively rush
ing one fraternity and then having
pledges plant "anti-Delt" mines
(triggered automatically by anything
weighing over 240 pounds).
Or more deviously, they might rig
the housing lottery computers, so
every beautiful girl gets a guaranteed
off-campus slot.
Cure for nerds
Instead, the following ideas offer a
more effective nerd-therapy.
Do:
—Throw a post-exam "megakegger"
funded by lab deposit rebates. This
obviously provides incentives for
saving on glassware etc. Our atten
tiveness would encourage them to
chat about more than extra credit
solutions and science fiction
plausabilities. Only by developing
communication can we hope to
nurse them back to health.
—Sponsor them in a fashion show
If Britain fancied pimpish Punk,
they'll line up in droves for nostalgic
Nerd. )ust look at Elvis Costello.
—Set-up coaching clinics to build
their confidence in sports. For
example, beginning cyclists could
culminate their training by pedaling
their clunkers up La Honda road, and
having a problem set luncheon on
Skyline Blvd. Then, all would race
back down as a final exam.
—Help them throw spitwads at the
Dollies while the Band is playing on
UCLY's second floor. By temporarily
joining their forces we can infiltrate
their intricate communications net

work. Only then can we begin to
challenge their pervasive "gospel of
the grade.''
ABC helicopter crews could tele
vise the event. After-race interviews
would introduce these nerds
turned-superstars to the thrill and
agony of commercialized sports. The
University could solicit conglomer
ates in South Africa to sponsor the
event. A feature film clip during pre
race coverage could highlight cur
rent construction around campus,
especially student housing.
Finally, winners would receive a
full scholarship for Howard Cosell's
Institue of Commentating Etiquette,
and would be invited to handle fu
ture play-by-plays.
As you can imagine, the alterna

On a rustic campus in the near fu
ture:
"Uh ... Hi there. Didn't I see you
in lab last Saturday, miss? Re
member, I let you have my place in
line at the spectrometer?"
"Urn . . . Oh yea, yea, you were
the guy who had sulfuric acid poured
into your backpack."
"Not exactly. That was my ex-lab
partner. But you're close. I'm Mel
vin. Say, I just happened to glance at
your answers to last week's problem
set and was wondering if you wanted
to do some computing this
weekend?"
"|ust for the record, I'm Nellie,
and frankly, my Texas instrument is
on the blink."
"Who's Frank?"
"Huh?"
"Ahem, . . . uh, it just so happens
I'm an electronics buff, and I'd love
to fiddle with your keyboard. I've got
just the right tool for adjusting your
input processor."
"Well Mel, I . . . uh, sure. Why
not?"
"Fine, we can grab our meals and
eat them in your room. No sense
wasting any time. Oh, make sure you
charge up that little mathbox be
forehand; it's easier to work on if it's
warm."
"Swell. See you around dinner
time on Friday."
The above conversation charac
terizes a prospective subculture of
the nerd kind. Members share a
paranoia based on the fear that ad
missions policies intentionally dis
favor them.
Our desires to liquidate people
like Mel and Nel just push them
closer to the above scenario; con
tinual hatred only causes them to
seek fellow nerds more feverishly.
By uniting them against a common

foe, namely us, their stronghold on
academic life becomes more en
trenched. This allows them to strike
back by demanding that the chemis
try department boost their catering
service to pre-meds, for instance.
Rather, freshly diagnosing nerds as
psychologically insecure beings (as
opposed to terminally antisocialitic
fungi) opens the way for a new, sub
tler treatment. TLC (Tender loving
care, not thin layer chromatography)
is what these fearful people need.
Only through our consolation can
we hope to clear their blurred vision
of campus life by focusing their at
tention away from mirages of thick
envelopes.
What more profitable tradeoff
than to have them help us "peak"
our exams? (Reader's note on nerd
lingo: A "peak" is an A. Vou get
"mounded" with a B. AC is a viscious
"hook," and being "dumped" refers
to a D.) We can reciprocate by
cooperatively culturing them in the
ways and means of the social scenes.
Let me clarify my intent with some
Do's and Don'ts.
Do NOT:
—Form Motobecane vigilante troops
to mow down people with calculator
holsters on their belts
—Drop a dictionary on a shaving
cream-filled envelope that has been
slipped under their study cubical
door.
—Attach fly-paper to old exams.
—Replace their favorite calculator
brochures by sneaking the real fold
outs back into their Playboys (or
Playgirls).
—Invite them to "Niffty Fifties"
sock-hops and forget to mention the
freshly-waxed dance floor.
—Kidnap them and hang them from
Sather Gate; Cal is infested with
numerous nerd cults. Our dangling
nerds would easily be rescued, and
you may find yourself brewing in a

test tube.
—Major in biology in hopes of con
verting them. The majority of nerds
are presently posing as social science
majors. This trend represents their
efforts to fool admissions boards into
thinking they are "well-rounded, lit
erate" people.
These measures could easily
catalyze them toward doing some
thing radical, like collectively rush
ing one fraternity and then having
pledges plant "anti-Delt" mines
(triggered automatically by anything
weighing over 240 pounds).
Or more deviously, they might rig
the housing lottery computers, so
every beautiful girl gets a guaranteed
off-campus slot.
Cure for nerds
Instead, the following ideas offer a
more effective nerd-therapy.
Do:
—Throw a post-exam "megakegger"
funded by lab deposit rebates. This
obviously provides incentives for
saving on glassware etc. Our atten
tiveness would encourage them to
chat about more than extra credit
solutions and science fiction
plausabilities. Only by developing
communication can we hope to
nurse them back to health.
—Sponsor them in a fashion show
If Britain fancied pimpish Punk,
they'll line up in droves for nostalgic
Nerd. )ust look at Elvis Costello.
—Set-up coaching clinics to build
their confidence in sports. For
example, beginning cyclists could
culminate their training by pedaling
their clunkers up La Honda road, and
having a problem set luncheon on
Skyline Blvd. Then, all would race
back down as a final exam.
—Help them throw spitwads at the
Dollies while the Band is playing on
UCLY's second floor. By temporarily
joining their forces we can infiltrate
their intricate communications net

work. Only then can we begin to
challenge their pervasive "gospel of
the grade.''
