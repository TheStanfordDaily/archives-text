# Friedman urges free-enterprise cure for poverty
## 
### Lane Webster 
"Never in history has there been a
more effective machine for eliminat
ing poverty than the free enterprise
system/' world-renowned economist
Milton Friedman declared last night.
Addressing a packed Kresge Au
ditorium, the 1976 Nobel laureate
warned that governments coerce out
of habit and create problems they are
intended to solve.
Friedman attacked the U.S.
minimum wage law, calling it"the

most anti-Negro law on the books."
The statute leads to unemployment
because many employers shy away
from paying minimum wages to
people with low productivity, Fried
man said.
Over 1000 persons heard Fried
man's speech, with hundreds watch
ing the address on closed-circuit
television in overflow rooms.
Turning to Chile, Friedman
acknowledged the unemployment
there. Demonstrators outside the
auditorium claimed the unemploy
ment has been caused by the ex
treme cutbacks in government
spending that he has advocated.
However, Friedman called such con
ditions "growing pains.
"Chile was extremely sick," he
explained. Any country that gets so
sick will have to "pay the price" to
recover, he said.
Already Chile's inflation has been
cut from 20 per cent a month to 3 per
cent and industrial and agricultural
production have risen, he said.
In Chile's economic sphere, the
results have been "healthy" and
economic conditions have been im
proving for "the great mass of
people," he claimed.
Time and again, regional conflicts

in Chile, Quebec, the North Sea and
the United States result when coun
tries rely more on the political system
than on the market mechanisms, he
asserted.
Market failure is the common ex
cuse for government intervention,
Friedman said. "But there is also
such a thing as a government fai
lure," he said.
Government cures can be worse
than the diseases because unlike the
market, thegovernment makes up its
own rules. Regulations can backfire,
he said, citing the time nightwear
manufacturers were required to
weave in a fireproofing ingredient
that later turned out to cause cancer.
"We've neglected a whole host of
intermediate voluntary arrange
ments," he said. One of them is the
private subsidization of science re
search, he said.
Friedman claimed universities sell
three things: schooling, research
and monuments which often serve to
finance research. Monuments elimi
nate the need for federal subsidies,
he maintained.
Friedman reminded his listeners
that he believes "government is a
means through which we can jointly
serve some of our ends, though it is

not an end in itself.
"If men are going to live in a soci
ety, there is no way you are going to
have absolute freedom," he said,
noting the distance he can extend his
fist is limited by "the proximity to
your chin."
Government does have the re
sponsibility to take care of irrespon
sible people, said Friedman. He li
mited those people to "children and
the insane."
But he allowed other people their
definitions. "After all, there are two
classes of people: ourselves and all
those other irresponsible people,' "
he said with a smile.
He added he thinks laws such as
those requiring motorcyclists to
wear helmets are "ridiculous." Only
if others are injured by an action
should the government step in to
prevent it, Friedman said.
The freedom we should have is not
the freedom from want as Franklin
Roosevelt used to say, nor the free
dom in the sense of "absence from
cost," said Friedman.
Freedom should simply be the
"absence of coercion," preventing
the use of physical force to make one
person the agent of another person's
will, he said.

Regarding South Africa, Friedman
opposed forcing corporations to
withdraw. The way to help South Af
rica is not to cut off the corporate
expansion that can provide jobs for
blacks, he said.
Earlier, Friedman stated that lack of
understanding has often led those
who believe in freedom to acciden
tally "collaborate with their enemies.
"Our humility must ultimately rest

on the limitations of our know
ledge," he said. "We cannot know,
we never can be sure we're right."
Nevertheless, governments often
assume they are right, and espouse a
paternalism that too often leads to
coercion, he said.
"I think free societies are very rare
things," Friedman said. A free mar
ket may not be the sufficient condi
tion for a free society, said Friedman,
but it is a necessary one.
