# Senate accomplishments pointed out

I keep reading in the Daily that the
ASSU Senate isn't doing anything,
lumping Jeepers! Maybe the senate
isn't doing everything, but by
gonads, it is doing a whole big
bunch! Even though we got started
slower than molasses on Ronald
Reagan's teeth in January, we have
already produced more significant
legislation than any senate in years.
)ust get a load of this:
—One of the most important and
controversial issues faced this year
(to which the Daily gave very little
attention) was the decision to in
crease the crucial senate discretio
nary fund by over 150 per cent (at no
extra cost to the ASSU).
Working closely with ASSU Finan

cial Manager Miles White, the senate
finance committee is drafting a
long-range budget for the next few
years. This will provide continuity in
senate spending from year to year,
enabling students to undertake more
long-term projects. But the senate
isn't doing anything.
Sens. Meriel Burtle and Lynn
Rubinett introduced legislation to
eliminate sexist language from the
senate and its by-laws. For the first
time the presence of women in the
ASSU is being acknowledged by our
language — and hopefully can be re
flected in our thinking as well.
Rubinett and Burtle helped create a
task force to work on a rape crisis/
prevention center, and cosponsored
a resolution to be sent to Sac
ramento, supporting continuance of
MediCal funding for abortions in
California. The senate has been
abominable.
We recently began work in special
committees, to investigate opera
tions of Tresidderand the Bookstore,
and explore the ramifications of ex
tracting ASSU from investments in
racist South Africa. In the next few
weeks, some fellow senators and I
hope to work out a plan for a major
overhaul of the presently pathetic
Off-Campus Student Center, despite
the fact that somebody told me the
senate is impotent.
Kenneth Nunn, Chairperson Fred
Crethel and I have worked out a five
point plan in the past few weeks,
which we hope will encourage
students-at-large to get more in
volved in ASSU: Your unsuspecting
house associate (RA) is part of a
phone list/network for gathering and
disseminating info on major issues;
your dorm will soon be visited by
smiling senators; individual senators
have been assigned weekly hours in

the senate office, in order to keep it
open more (come up and see us
some time); we've arranged with the
Daily that we will attempt to stuff it
(yuk yuk) every second Friday with a
column reporting on and analyzing
our activities. I'm writing this first
one, but keep your eyes open for
word from your favorite senator.
Also, agendas of senate and commit
tee meetings will be published here
in the Daily. If you have some time,
and an agenda looks interesting,
please come to a meeting! Especially
if you have ideas on how to replace
the pernicious, time-wasting
"Robert's Rules" of boredom.
So, why has this year's senate been
so utterly worthless, especially com
pared to the last three or four years of
almost exclusively white, male, pre
law senates. Perhaps it is because of
our unprecedented close working
relationship with the activist Council
of Presidents.
Perhaps it is because the team of 14

senators and chairperson from the
SOC Slate turned out not to be a
clone of Trotskyite terrorists after all.
In fact, except for Tom McCormack's
sorority ban bill, the SOC slate has
introduced every major piece of
legislation so far this year. (That was a
subtle plug for the SOC Slate.)
You know what? I thinkwe have 20
thoroughly abominable senators,
and I hope they get even more abo
minable for the next two thirds of the
year. Maybe we can even abominate
President Richard Lyman for uncon
stitutionally picking students for the
C!R.
I'm having a good time on the se
nate, bully, bully! even though I'm
not going to law school or biz school
or anything. Senate meetings are
weird! Sometimes we have
fireworks! You ought to come sit in
on at least one befohe yon graduate.

students-at-large to get more in
volved in ASSU: Your unsuspecting
house associate (RA) is part of a
phone list/network for gathering and
disseminating info on major issues;
your dorm will soon be visited by
smiling senators; individual senators
have been assigned weekly hours in

the senate office, in order to keep it
open more (come up and see us
some time); we've arranged with the
Daily that we will attempt to stuff it
(yuk yuk) every second Friday with a
column reporting on and analyzing
our activities. I'm writing this first
one, but keep your eyes open for
word from your favorite senator.
Also, agendas of senate and commit
tee meetings will be published here
in the Daily. If you have some time,
and an agenda looks interesting,
please come to a meeting! Especially
if you have ideas on how to replace
the pernicious, time-wasting
"Robert's Rules" of boredom.
So, why has this year's senate been
so utterly worthless, especially com
pared to the last three or four years of
almost exclusively white, male, pre
law senates. Perhaps it is because of
our unprecedented close working
relationship with the activist Council
of Presidents.
Perhaps it is because the team of 14

senators and chairperson from the
SOC Slate turned out not to be a
clone of Trotskyite terrorists after all.
In fact, except for Tom McCormack's
sorority ban bill, the SOC slate has
introduced every major piece of
legislation so far this year. (That was a
subtle plug for the SOC Slate.)
You know what? I thinkwe have 20
thoroughly abominable senators,
and I hope they get even more abo
minable for the next two thirds of the
year. Maybe we can even abominate
President Richard Lyman for uncon
stitutionally picking students for the
C!R.
I'm having a good time on the se
nate, bully, bully! even though I'm
not going to law school or biz school
or anything. Senate meetings are
weird! Sometimes we have
fireworks! You ought to come sit in
on at least one befohe yon graduate.

I keep reading in the Daily that the
ASSU Senate isn't doing anything,
lumping Jeepers! Maybe the senate
isn't doing everything, but by
gonads, it is doing a whole big
bunch! Even though we got started
slower than molasses on Ronald
Reagan's teeth in January, we have
already produced more significant
legislation than any senate in years.

—One of the most important and
controversial issues faced this year
(to which the Daily gave very little
attention) was the decision to in
crease the crucial senate discretio
nary fund by over 150 per cent (at no
extra cost to the ASSU).
Working closely with ASSU Finan

cial Manager Miles White, the senate
finance committee is drafting a
long-range budget for the next few
years. This will provide continuity in
senate spending from year to year,
enabling students to undertake more
long-term projects. But the senate
isn't doing anything.
Sens. Meriel Burtle and Lynn
Rubinett introduced legislation to
eliminate sexist language from the
senate and its by-laws. For the first
time the presence of women in the
ASSU is being acknowledged by our
language — and hopefully can be re
flected in our thinking as well.
Rubinett and Burtle helped create a
task force to work on a rape crisis/
prevention center, and cosponsored
a resolution to be sent to Sac
ramento, supporting continuance of
MediCal funding for abortions in
California. The senate has been
abominable.
We recently began work in special
committees, to investigate opera
tions of Tresidderand the Bookstore,
and explore the ramifications of ex
tracting ASSU from investments in
racist South Africa. In the next few
weeks, some fellow senators and I
hope to work out a plan for a major
overhaul of the presently pathetic
Off-Campus Student Center, despite
the fact that somebody told me the
senate is impotent.
Kenneth Nunn, Chairperson Fred
Crethel and I have worked out a five
point plan in the past few weeks,
