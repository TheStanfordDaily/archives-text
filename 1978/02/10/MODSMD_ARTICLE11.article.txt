The members of the Council of
Presidents would like to reiterate our
dismay with the methods President
Lyman has used to place students of
the CIR. It is an insult to the student
body that the University administra
tion would actively seek out students
who are willing to circumvent a deci
sion made by the elected representa
tives of the students.
Although the students who have
agreed to serve on the CIR disagree
with the ASSU's judgment that stu
dent participation on the CIR would
be counter-productive at this point,
we feel that the statements made by
the group of 14 show a recognition of
the important issues which the ASSU
is raising, and a clear understanding
of the political implications of the
selection process initiated by Presi
dent Lyman and of their participation
process.
By agreeing to serve on the CIR
only as long as their participation on
the committee is effective, or until
the issue is resolved such that the
ASSU decides to nominate regular
student representatives, the stu
dents demonstrate a strong sense of
responsibility to their fellow stu
dents.
The Council of Presidents is most
willing to provide Ron, Susan, and
Lee with any information they may
require for their work on the CIR. We
wish them luck, and hope they will
hold firm in their resolve to resign
from the CIR if and when their par
ticipation proves a waste of time.
May they have better success than
the 20-odd students who have served
on the CIR in the past 6 years.
