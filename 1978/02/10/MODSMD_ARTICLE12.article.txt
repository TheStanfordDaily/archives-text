# Rhetoric criticized
##

One hoped that with the removal
of Richard Nixon and the fall of South
Vietnam Cold War rhetoric might
fade gently into oblivion. Instead,
three years later, we find it alive,
well, and fervent in, of all places, the
editorial page bf the Stanford Daily.
The fact that Bandow de
monstrates himself remarkably be
reft of historical sense is not the
primary issue here, although it is ap
parent enough. Perhaps he really
does believe that centuries of rivalry
and mistrust between Vietnam and
Cambodia were dampened during
U.S. involvement in Indochina.
Perhaps he even believes that the
people there long for a return to the
golden age of peace which occurred
roughly between, say, 1964 and 1975.
I leave such sticky questions of fact to
the historians. Since Bandow is obvi
ously not numbered among them I
suggest that he do the same.
What one objects to most is his
language, not a syllable of which is
fresh and most of which resembles
remarkably that found in such
weighty works as "Masters of De

ceit" and "None Dare Call It
Treason." "The barbaric and intrans
igent Cambodians . . . the fac
tionalized and xenophobic bandits
. . . the Vietnamese . . .Cambodian,
Soviet, East German and other com
munist brethren who try to kill as
many putative refugees seeking to
flee paradise as possible" are, in
Bandow's eyes, clearly responsible
for the world's, or at least their own,
ills.
All of this without the slightest ap
parent realization that while parrot
ing the anti-communist hysteria of a
hopefully bygone age, he speaks in a
tongue greatly resembling the offi
cial language of the communist gov
ernments he so deeply seems to de
spise. To paraphrase H.L. Mencken,
one almost longs for a return to the
more seemly bosh of Nixon.
One also longs for the Daily to
clean up its act and cease to foist
such ignorant blather upon us in the
name of "presenting both sides of an
issue."
