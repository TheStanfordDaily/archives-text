# Spry professor teaching at ninety
## 
### Janet Bailey 
Not only is George Polya a
world-famous mathematician,
but he is a livelyand well-loved
professor here as well. That
may not be so unusual, except
that Emeritus Professor Polya
turned 90 in December.
Polya is officially teaching
here for the first time in 25 years.
He is filling in tor a colleague
by teaching Computer Science
150, Introducticn to Combina
tional Theory, with Professor
Tarjan of the Comp. Sci. De
partment.
"I'd read some of his books
on problem solving, and I was
really excited to find out he was
teaching the class," said a stu
dent in CS 150. "He describes
abstract concepts in concrete
terms — it makes things really
clear."
Research
Polya's research has
"touched on everything," says
colleague Harold Bacon,
Emeritus Prof, of Mathematics.
His research in mathematical
areas includes probability,
combinatorics, and number
theory; his ideas have influ
enced such fields outside of
mathematics as chemistry and
computer science.
The Hungarian-born Polya
couples his theoretical work
"with a great love for explain
ing things to people," said
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Halsey Royden. "He has
always been full of very clever
examples and ways of looking
at things." Royden was a stu
dent of Polya's 20 years ago
when he was an undergraduate
mathematics major.
In the classroom, Polya
reaches high to write an equa
tion on the blackboard, then
scurries to another board to
sketch a diagram. Speaking in a

husky, heavily-accented voice,
he illustrates his points with
anecdotes and personal exam
ples.
Birthdays
"You are a group of n
people," he tells his class.
"You are at home, you don't
wish to associate with anybody
else, so you are a subset."
Royden remembers when
Polya had a class work out the
probability that two of the 25
people in the room would have
the same birthday. The odds
are surprisingly high. Armed
with this discovery, an enter
prising student made money
by going from fraternity to
fraternity betting that among
the residents, at least two had
birthdays in common.
Results
"It's intriguing to watch him
teach," says Don Woods,
teaching assistant for CS 150.
"Results seem to pop out like
magic on the board. He'll start
with a seemingly unrelated
example, and lead the class

along showing an approach."
Polya taught at the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology
in Zurich for 26 years and came
to America in 1940 because
"Hitler was too close." He then
lectured at such institituions as
Princeton, Cambridge and the
University of Paris.
Polya joined the Stanford fa
culty in 1942. Since his retire
ment in 1953, he has continued
to write and has taught high
school mathematics teachers
in programs sponsored by
such organizations as the Na
tional Science Foundation.
Modest
Polya is modest about his
many accomplishments, which
include 250 papers, a number
of influential theorems, and
memberships in prestigious
academic societies as well as
the several widely-translated
books.

Polya was featured in an
award-winning educational
film called "Let Us Teach Gues
sing," which he said was
"made in Hollywood" in the
late I%o's. "Teaching gues
sing" is an important part of
Polya's approach to problem
solving. He spots a pattern in a
problem and comes up with an
answer before he attempts to
prove it.
When Polya learned in the
1960s that the Dept. of Compu
ter Science was planning to
name its new building after
him, he told them Chairman
George Forsythe, "If the build
ing is named after me people
will think one of two things —
either I am dead or I gave half a
million dollars to the Univer
sity." Forsythe laughingly ag
reed to post a notice declaring
that Polya had not contributed
a cent.

"It's intriguing to watch him
teach," says Don Woods,
teaching assistant for CS 150.
"Results seem to pop out like
magic on the board. He'll start
with a seemingly unrelated
example, and lead the class

along showing an approach."
Polya taught at the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology
in Zurich for 26 years and came
to America in 1940 because
"Hitler was too close." He then
lectured at such institituions as
Princeton, Cambridge and the
University of Paris.
Polya joined the Stanford fa
culty in 1942. Since his retire
ment in 1953, he has continued
to write and has taught high
school mathematics teachers
in programs sponsored by
such organizations as the Na
tional Science Foundation.
Modest
Polya is modest about his
many accomplishments, which
include 250 papers, a number
of influential theorems, and
memberships in prestigious
academic societies as well as
the several widely-translated
books.

Polya was featured in an
award-winning educational
film called "Let Us Teach Gues
sing," which he said was
"made in Hollywood" in the
late I%o's. "Teaching gues
sing" is an important part of
Polya's approach to problem
solving. He spots a pattern in a
problem and comes up with an
answer before he attempts to
prove it.
When Polya learned in the
1960s that the Dept. of Compu
ter Science was planning to
name its new building after
him, he told them Chairman
George Forsythe, "If the build
ing is named after me people
will think one of two things —
either I am dead or I gave half a
million dollars to the Univer
sity." Forsythe laughingly ag
reed to post a notice declaring
that Polya had not contributed
a cent.


George Polya
Not only is George Polya a
world-famous mathematician,
but he is a livelyand well-loved
professor here as well. That
may not be so unusual, except
that Emeritus Professor Polya
turned 90 in December.
Polya is officially teaching
here for the first time in 25 years.
He is filling in tor a colleague
by teaching Computer Science
150, Introducticn to Combina
tional Theory, with Professor
Tarjan of the Comp. Sci. De
partment.
"I'd read some of his books
on problem solving, and I was
really excited to find out he was
teaching the class," said a stu
dent in CS 150. "He describes
abstract concepts in concrete
terms — it makes things really
clear."
Research
Polya's research has
"touched on everything," says
colleague Harold Bacon,
Emeritus Prof, of Mathematics.
His research in mathematical
areas includes probability,
combinatorics, and number
theory; his ideas have influ
enced such fields outside of
mathematics as chemistry and
computer science.
The Hungarian-born Polya
couples his theoretical work
"with a great love for explain
ing things to people," said
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Halsey Royden. "He has
always been full of very clever
examples and ways of looking
at things." Royden was a stu
dent of Polya's 20 years ago
when he was an undergraduate
mathematics major.
In the classroom, Polya
reaches high to write an equa
tion on the blackboard, then
scurries to another board to
sketch a diagram. Speaking in a

husky, heavily-accented voice,
he illustrates his points with
anecdotes and personal exam
ples.
Birthdays
"You are a group of n
people," he tells his class.
"You are at home, you don't
wish to associate with anybody
else, so you are a subset."
Royden remembers when
Polya had a class work out the
probability that two of the 25
people in the room would have
the same birthday. The odds
are surprisingly high. Armed
with this discovery, an enter
prising student made money
by going from fraternity to
fraternity betting that among
the residents, at least two had
birthdays in common.
