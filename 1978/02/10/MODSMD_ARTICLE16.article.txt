# Women publish newspaper

"Providing a means of communication to the
women in the Stanford community as to wo
men's issues and women's ideas, locally as well
as nationwide," is the primary objective of Au
rora, a new women's newspaper here.
Approximately 5000 copies of Aurora's first
issue were distributed around campus last
week. The issue included a collection of news
items, feature articles, reviews, poetry and
artwork by women from all sections of the Stan
ford community.
Aurora is run by a group of about 16 women
who are divided into three collectives: produc
tion, business and editorial.
The group prefers to be run by collectives
because "hierarchies are a negative thing and
they create negative feelings among the group,"
said Phyllis Brown, co-director of the Women's
Center and Aurora collective member.
The Aurora collective was formed last quarter
through the Women's Center and as an exten
sion of Women's Week "to try to create a con
tinual awareness of women's needs," said
Brown.
The Aurora staff members were primarily re
cruited through an ad in the Daily and by word
of-mouth, said Brown.
The women in the collective "really represent
a good range of ideas," said Margaret Jensen, an

Aurora staff member. "Some joined for political
reasons, some joined for personal reasons and
some joined strictly because they wanted to
write for a newspaper without going through
the hierarchy of the Daily," Jensen said.
"Most of the women involved are feminists,
but it's not strictly a feminist paper," com
mented Aurora member Debbie Demott.
"Our contacts were more with the feminists
and they also seem to be the ones who want to
write," explained Jensen. "Hopefully next time
we'll come up with a greater variety of articles,"
she added.
According to Brown, Aurora received an ini
tial sum of $320 from the ASSU Publications
Board and collected an additional $400 in adver
tisements.
The main problem in getting started "was that
very few of us had any previous experience in
putting out a publication, so we were pretty
much starting from scratch," commented staff
member Lisa Atlas.
Several collective members said they have
gotten "really positive feedback" on the news
paper.
"Not everyone agrees with everything we've
written, but they think it's a good idea," com
mented Demott.
The staff hopes to publish Aurora as a monthly
newspaper.
