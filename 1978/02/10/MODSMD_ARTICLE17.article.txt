# Glee Club provides 'special niche' but lacks campus support
## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
In Dinkelspiel Auditorium
on Thursday afternoons, the
harmony of 60 cherubic voices
wafts up through the floor as
the Stanford Glee Club re
hearses.
The club performs songs
both A Capella and with an or
chestra, from a myriad of eras.
Their repertoire includes clas
sical, religious, show tunes,
jazz and big band selections.
The club includes two sub
groups. The Axidentals, a
group of 12 men, sing every
thing from Beatles tunes to
1920's barbershop quartets,
according to member Dennis
toun Brown. The Naturals, a
group of 12 women, sing an
equally varied selection of
songs. These two subgroups
and the orchestra perform and
tour with the Glee Club.
Enjoyment
Enjoyment is the key reason
students join this group. "Glee
Club is very unique on cam
pus," said Rich Henderson,
former president and present
public relations chairman of
the club.
"It fills a role that nothing
else could do for me. We don't
get a lot of music majors be
cause of the light atmosphere,
but that atmosphere is just
what I'm looking for.
Brad Jones, formerpresident
and manager of the club, has
been a member for six years.
"The greatest thing about Glee

Club is the friendships I've
made over the years," he said.
Problems
Yet for such a supposedly
gleeful group, the club has
several problems. It is virtually
separate from the music de
partment, and it lacks the sup
port that glee clubs at univer
sities such as Harvard and Vale
thrive upon. Although the
music department gives each
glee club member one unit of
credit per quarter, participa
tion in the club is not counted
towards the performing group
requirement for music majors.
Peter Bensinger, club presi
dent, says he believes the
music department harbors bad
feelings towards the Glee
Club."The music department
doesn't sanction or support
the club. They think we do too
much pop music and not
enough serious material," he
said.
"I have no bitter feelings to
ward the music department,"
Henderson said. "We just go
our own way and we're grateful
for any support they give us.
But we don't expect it, and we
function independently of the
department."
The music department does
furnish pianos and rehearsal
halls for the group, however,
and is helpful when problems
arise, according to Glee Club
director Robert MacKinnon.
The majority of financial
support for the club comes

from the Student Activities di
vision of the Dean of Students
Office, MacKinnon said.
Money to pay for salaries,
music, office supplies and long
distance phone calls come out
of this budget.
In addition, a dues account is
used to pay for social events
and maintenance of uniforms,
and a concert fees account is
used to finance tours.
Tours
The club goes on tour every
other year, either to Southern
California or through Northern
California, Oregon and
Washington.
"Glee Club is at its best on
tour, when we're not only sing
ing together, but eating to
gether and living together,"
Jones said.
Because tours consolidate
the club, "an increasingly im
possible amount of work" goes
into planning them, according
to Bensinger. A typical tour is
set up in the summer by Mac-
Kinnon, who goes on the road
to find alumni and service club
support. Thealumni house and
feed members, and service or
ganizations sponsor the con
certs.
Members usually sing in a
high school in exchange for
lunch and perform in the even
ing for $750, which pays for the
day's bus charge.
"We don't go on tour to
make money. We go on tour to
have a good time and break

even," MacKinnon said.
A Southern California tour
was scheduled this year, but
due to a lack of alumni support
in some of the cities, the tour
fell through. It would be too
expensive for the club to stay in
hotels and pay for meals, Mac-
Kinnon said.
"Because the tour was can
celled, the great amount of
spirit among members was
temporarily drenched," Ben
singer said. "Sure, the club has
fun the years we don't tour, but
not as much fun."
In comparison to Eastern
glee clubs, the Glee Club re
ceives considerably less sup
port. "It is disheartening,"
Henderson said, "to see the
Vale Glee Club fly all over the
country and to Europe. I guess
Stanford places their public re
lations priorities elsewhere."
Bensinger said he feels the
Glee Club here is considered
"insignificant." Despite the big
difference in financial backing,
the musical quality of the Glee
Club is comparable to that of
the Eastern clubs, Bensinger
said.
The club is unusual in its
emphasis on social activities.
In addition to performing four
or five concerts a quarter, the
club maintains an active social
calendar. Members are also
encouraged to use their talents
in dormitory plays and other
outside activities.
This varied emphasis is a

positive aspect of the Club, be
cause it attracts a diversity of
people, from varsity athletic
team members to graduate
students, lones said.
With so much diversity, the
club has a surprisingly large
turnover rate.
"The turnover rate must be
viewed in context. Member
ship is consistent throughout
the year, )ones said.
Bensinger said he believes
the general club attitude is "It's
worthwhile to stay in, but I
don't know about next year."

The turnover rate can be
explained in a number of ways,
Bensinger said. Non-tour years
are usually not as fun, so many
members drop out. Students
time here is limited and many
people may want to vary their
activities.
Some members complain
that Glee Club is too many
hours of the same thing, and
"thereare thosewho just don't
like it," Bensinger added.
"A long-lasting fund raising
effort is the only way to make it
as a preeminant club," Mac-

Kinnon said. The Glee Club is
presently trying to get an ASSU
fee assessment and is compil
ing a list of potential suppor
ters to contaci.
The Glee Cub is run by a
staff that meet} once a week to
discuss the grioes and sugges
tions of the members, fi
nances, publicity, social
events and the concert
schedule. Concerts in the near
future include a performance
on February 21 at American
Studies House,and on March 7
at Wilbur.

"Because the tour was can
celled, the great amount of
spirit among members was
temporarily drenched," Ben
singer said. "Sure, the club has
fun the years we don't tour, but
not as much fun."
In comparison to Eastern
glee clubs, the Glee Club re
ceives considerably less sup
port. "It is disheartening,"
Henderson said, "to see the
Vale Glee Club fly all over the
country and to Europe. I guess
Stanford places their public re
lations priorities elsewhere."
Bensinger said he feels the
Glee Club here is considered
"insignificant." Despite the big
difference in financial backing,
the musical quality of the Glee
Club is comparable to that of
the Eastern clubs, Bensinger
said.
The club is unusual in its
emphasis on social activities.
In addition to performing four
or five concerts a quarter, the
club maintains an active social
calendar. Members are also
encouraged to use their talents
in dormitory plays and other
outside activities.
This varied emphasis is a

positive aspect of the Club, be
cause it attracts a diversity of
people, from varsity athletic
team members to graduate
students, lones said.
With so much diversity, the
club has a surprisingly large
turnover rate.
"The turnover rate must be
viewed in context. Member
ship is consistent throughout
the year, )ones said.
Bensinger said he believes
the general club attitude is "It's
worthwhile to stay in, but I
don't know about next year."

The turnover rate can be
explained in a number of ways,
Bensinger said. Non-tour years
are usually not as fun, so many
members drop out. Students
time here is limited and many
people may want to vary their
activities.
Some members complain
that Glee Club is too many
hours of the same thing, and
"thereare thosewho just don't
like it," Bensinger added.
"A long-lasting fund raising
effort is the only way to make it
as a preeminant club," Mac-

Kinnon said. The Glee Club is
presently trying to get an ASSU
fee assessment and is compil
ing a list of potential suppor
ters to contaci.
The Glee Cub is run by a
staff that meet} once a week to
discuss the grioes and sugges
tions of the members, fi
nances, publicity, social
events and the concert
schedule. Concerts in the near
future include a performance
on February 21 at American
Studies House,and on March 7
at Wilbur.


â€”Daily pholo by Bonnie Dean
The Stanford Glee Club, led by Director Robert MacKinnon, can be found rehearsing beneath Dinkelspiel
Auditorium in preparation for concerts and tours.
In Dinkelspiel Auditorium
on Thursday afternoons, the
harmony of 60 cherubic voices
wafts up through the floor as
the Stanford Glee Club re
hearses.
The club performs songs
both A Capella and with an or
chestra, from a myriad of eras.
Their repertoire includes clas
sical, religious, show tunes,
jazz and big band selections.
The club includes two sub
groups. The Axidentals, a
group of 12 men, sing every
thing from Beatles tunes to
1920's barbershop quartets,
according to member Dennis
toun Brown. The Naturals, a
group of 12 women, sing an
equally varied selection of
songs. These two subgroups
and the orchestra perform and
tour with the Glee Club.
Enjoyment
Enjoyment is the key reason
students join this group. "Glee
Club is very unique on cam
pus," said Rich Henderson,
former president and present
public relations chairman of
the club.
"It fills a role that nothing
else could do for me. We don't
get a lot of music majors be
cause of the light atmosphere,
but that atmosphere is just
what I'm looking for.
Brad Jones, formerpresident
and manager of the club, has
been a member for six years.
"The greatest thing about Glee

Club is the friendships I've
made over the years," he said.
Problems
Yet for such a supposedly
gleeful group, the club has
several problems. It is virtually
separate from the music de
partment, and it lacks the sup
port that glee clubs at univer
sities such as Harvard and Vale
thrive upon. Although the
music department gives each
glee club member one unit of
credit per quarter, participa
tion in the club is not counted
towards the performing group
requirement for music majors.
Peter Bensinger, club presi
dent, says he believes the
music department harbors bad
feelings towards the Glee
Club."The music department
doesn't sanction or support
the club. They think we do too
much pop music and not
enough serious material," he
said.
"I have no bitter feelings to
ward the music department,"
Henderson said. "We just go
our own way and we're grateful
for any support they give us.
But we don't expect it, and we
function independently of the
department."
The music department does
furnish pianos and rehearsal
halls for the group, however,
and is helpful when problems
arise, according to Glee Club
director Robert MacKinnon.
The majority of financial
support for the club comes

from the Student Activities di
vision of the Dean of Students
Office, MacKinnon said.
Money to pay for salaries,
music, office supplies and long
distance phone calls come out
of this budget.
In addition, a dues account is
used to pay for social events
and maintenance of uniforms,
and a concert fees account is
used to finance tours.
Tours
The club goes on tour every
other year, either to Southern
California or through Northern
California, Oregon and
Washington.
"Glee Club is at its best on
tour, when we're not only sing
ing together, but eating to
gether and living together,"
Jones said.
Because tours consolidate
the club, "an increasingly im
possible amount of work" goes
into planning them, according
to Bensinger. A typical tour is
set up in the summer by Mac-
Kinnon, who goes on the road
to find alumni and service club
support. Thealumni house and
feed members, and service or
ganizations sponsor the con
certs.
Members usually sing in a
high school in exchange for
lunch and perform in the even
ing for $750, which pays for the
day's bus charge.
"We don't go on tour to
make money. We go on tour to
have a good time and break

even," MacKinnon said.
A Southern California tour
was scheduled this year, but
due to a lack of alumni support
in some of the cities, the tour
fell through. It would be too
expensive for the club to stay in
hotels and pay for meals, Mac-
Kinnon said.
"Because the tour was can
celled, the great amount of
spirit among members was
temporarily drenched," Ben
singer said. "Sure, the club has
fun the years we don't tour, but

separate from the music de
partment, and it lacks the sup
port that glee clubs at univer
sities such as Harvard and Vale
thrive upon. Although the
music department gives each
glee club member one unit of
credit per quarter, participa
tion in the club is not counted
towards the performing group
requirement for music majors.
Peter Bensinger, club presi
dent, says he believes the
music department harbors bad
feelings towards the Glee
Club."The music department
doesn't sanction or support
the club. They think we do too
much pop music and not
enough serious material," he
said.
"I have no bitter feelings to
ward the music department,"
Henderson said. "We just go
our own way and we're grateful
for any support they give us.
But we don't expect it, and we
function independently of the
department."
The music department does
furnish pianos and rehearsal
halls for the group, however,
and is helpful when problems
arise, according to Glee Club
director Robert MacKinnon.
The majority of financial
support for the club comes

from the Student Activities di
vision of the Dean of Students
Office, MacKinnon said.
Money to pay for salaries,
music, office supplies and long
distance phone calls come out
of this budget.
In addition, a dues account is
used to pay for social events
and maintenance of uniforms,
and a concert fees account is
used to finance tours.
Tours
The club goes on tour every
other year, either to Southern
California or through Northern
California, Oregon and
Washington.
"Glee Club is at its best on
tour, when we're not only sing
ing together, but eating to
gether and living together,"
Jones said.
Because tours consolidate
the club, "an increasingly im
possible amount of work" goes
into planning them, according
to Bensinger. A typical tour is
set up in the summer by Mac-
Kinnon, who goes on the road
to find alumni and service club
support. Thealumni house and
feed members, and service or
ganizations sponsor the con
certs.
Members usually sing in a
high school in exchange for
lunch and perform in the even
ing for $750, which pays for the
day's bus charge.
"We don't go on tour to
make money. We go on tour to
have a good time and break

even," MacKinnon said.
A Southern California tour
was scheduled this year, but
due to a lack of alumni support
in some of the cities, the tour
fell through. It would be too
expensive for the club to stay in
hotels and pay for meals, Mac-
Kinnon said.
"Because the tour was can
celled, the great amount of
spirit among members was
temporarily drenched," Ben
singer said. "Sure, the club has
fun the years we don't tour, but
not as much fun."
In comparison to Eastern
glee clubs, the Glee Club re
ceives considerably less sup
port. "It is disheartening,"
Henderson said, "to see the
Vale Glee Club fly all over the
country and to Europe. I guess
Stanford places their public re
lations priorities elsewhere."
Bensinger said he feels the
Glee Club here is considered
"insignificant." Despite the big
difference in financial backing,
the musical quality of the Glee
Club is comparable to that of
the Eastern clubs, Bensinger
said.
The club is unusual in its
emphasis on social activities.
In addition to performing four
or five concerts a quarter, the
club maintains an active social
calendar. Members are also
encouraged to use their talents
in dormitory plays and other
outside activities.
This varied emphasis is a

positive aspect of the Club, be
cause it attracts a diversity of
people, from varsity athletic
team members to graduate
students, lones said.
With so much diversity, the
club has a surprisingly large
turnover rate.
"The turnover rate must be
viewed in context. Member
ship is consistent throughout
the year, )ones said.
Bensinger said he believes
the general club attitude is "It's
worthwhile to stay in, but I
don't know about next year."

The turnover rate can be
explained in a number of ways,
Bensinger said. Non-tour years
are usually not as fun, so many
members drop out. Students
time here is limited and many
people may want to vary their
activities.
Some members complain
that Glee Club is too many
hours of the same thing, and
"thereare thosewho just don't
like it," Bensinger added.
"A long-lasting fund raising
effort is the only way to make it
as a preeminant club," Mac-

Kinnon said. The Glee Club is
presently trying to get an ASSU
fee assessment and is compil
ing a list of potential suppor
ters to contaci.
The Glee Cub is run by a
staff that meet} once a week to
discuss the grioes and sugges
tions of the members, fi
nances, publicity, social
events and the concert
schedule. Concerts in the near
future include a performance
on February 21 at American
Studies House,and on March 7
at Wilbur.

The Stanford Glee Club, led by Director Robert MacKinnon, can be found rehearsing beneath Dinkelspiel
Auditorium in preparation for concerts and tours.
In Dinkelspiel Auditorium
on Thursday afternoons, the
harmony of 60 cherubic voices
wafts up through the floor as
the Stanford Glee Club re
hearses.
The club performs songs
both A Capella and with an or
chestra, from a myriad of eras.
Their repertoire includes clas
sical, religious, show tunes,
jazz and big band selections.
The club includes two sub
groups. The Axidentals, a
group of 12 men, sing every
thing from Beatles tunes to
1920's barbershop quartets,
according to member Dennis
toun Brown. The Naturals, a
group of 12 women, sing an
equally varied selection of
songs. These two subgroups
and the orchestra perform and
tour with the Glee Club.
Enjoyment
Enjoyment is the key reason
students join this group. "Glee
Club is very unique on cam
pus," said Rich Henderson,
former president and present
public relations chairman of
the club.
"It fills a role that nothing
else could do for me. We don't
get a lot of music majors be
cause of the light atmosphere,
but that atmosphere is just
what I'm looking for.
Brad Jones, formerpresident
and manager of the club, has
been a member for six years.
"The greatest thing about Glee

Club is the friendships I've
made over the years," he said.
