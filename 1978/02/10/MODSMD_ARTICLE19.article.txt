What is the "Stanford University Traffic De
partment," and what do they do with all those
white vans which are everywhere on campus?-
DF
The white vans with the red University emblems
on the doors belong to the Plant Services
Maintenance Department.
A "Traffic Department" doesn't exist within
the Police Department. All they have is a De
partment of Public Safety which controls park
ing and night security.
Hmm, I wonder . . .
At the recent opening of the new overseas
campus building in Berlin, several university
administrators were in attendance.
Aside from those who are working there this
quarter, who paid the expenses for this junket? If
it was the University, how much did it cost and
how is it justified?
-CC
Mark Mancall, director of Overseas Studies,
said his expenses were paid by Overseas
Studies, and that Provost Miller's expenses were
probably paid by the Provost's office.
According to Mancall, the Berlin Government
requested his presence, and that of either the
President or the Provost.
The Berlin Government spent 1.6 million DM
to renovate the villa, and they wanted a formal

opening ceremony, so they requested the pre
sence of University officials.
Mancall said "the expense is definitely jus
tified," and noted that other business was per
formed during the trip. Mancall said "once a
twice a year," he makes a trip to all the overseas
campuses. After the Berlin opening, he went to
Vienna, and then to London, attending to over
seas campus business.
According to Corb Smith, assoc. director of
Overseas Studies, Provost Miller combined his
trip with meetings in Bonn, while Walter
Lohnes, Chairman of German Studies was there
on separate business.
Over on Old Page Mill Road there is a watch
tower reminiscent of medieval Europe. Could
you find out who built it, and for whatreason(s)?
-DD
Roxanne Nilan at University Archives has the
answers for questions such as these. She said
the tower was built by the Frenchman Peter
Coutts. Coutts owned most of the land in this
area before the Stanfords came.
Despite rumors, Coutts did not kill someone
and seal them in the tower. Rather, it is a water
tower, part of an irrigation system Coutts was
setting up for his farm. He returned to France,
but the tower remains.
