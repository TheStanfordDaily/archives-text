# Anti-rape workshop scheduled

As the threat of rape continues on
campus, several programs are being
instituted here to educate people
about rape.
Leah Kaplan, asst. dean of .tudent
affairs, and Captain Raoul Niemeyer
of the Department of Public Safety,
have scheduled a rape awareness
workshop Saturday. Its purpose is to
educate interested people, Kaplan
said.
Three Stanford policemen will also
attend to gain insight in dealing with
rape victims
ASSU Sen. Lynn Rubinett said
there will be ASSU Senators at Satur
day's session. Rubinett said she
hopes those senators can be the core
of a task force on rape.
"They will participate in general
outreach programs on campus by
leading discussions and distributing
a booklet, 'Working Against Rape.' "
Rubinett also said she plans to
speak to the police department
about being more lenient in releas
ing rape reports to the press. This
would help warn students about
rape, she added.
She said the task force is also con
sideringthe possibility of a rape crisis
line. Women often report rapes to
agencies other than the police de
partment, Kaplan noted.
Kaplan also leads counseling ses
sions on rape at Houston House here
on campus. She said she believes
that counseling restores self esteem
lost after the damaging experience of
rape. She explained that she at
tempts to assuage the guilt women
feel after being raped.
"Women feel they must have done
something stupid like jog alone or
take a hitchhiking ride, but human
nature makes it difficult to be dis
trustful," she said.
Students tend to open up to one
another, she added. If a rapist poses
as a student, he isn't asked for his
1.D., he's |ust trusted. It is important
to remember that "we are vulnerable
if we assume complete safety," Kap
lan said.
Kaplan and Niemeyer helped in
troduce the Rape Prevention Educa
tion Program here, modeled after a
similar Berkeley program. The prog
ram is designed to educate people
before rapes occur, according to
Kaplan.
Kaplan stressed the need for male,
as well as female, awareness. "When
a rape takes place, there are really
two victims; the woman and her
husband or boyfriend," Kaplan said.
The break-up rate after a rape is
very high and often the woman suf
fers sexual dysfunction, she said.
"Male awareness is needed so that
women don't feel foolish about their
fears," Kaplan added.
Niemeyer has set up an emergency
response group at the police de
partment. University staff members
are available around the clock to aid
police in the case of assault. This
staff, primarily female, can aid in
psychiatric counseling and give addi
tional support.
Kaplan said a common misconcep
tion among rape victims concerns fil
ing police reports. If a report is filed,
it does not mean the woman must
press charges, Kaplan said. Reports
can be made anonymously, she ad
ded.
