Savoy Tivoli
1438 Grant Avenue
San Francisco
Oh, the shock of it. After
nearly three weeks of being
treated as prodigals, fatted
calves, not to mention the ob
ligatory Christmas turkey and
the almost-as-obligatory New
Year's ham, to return to food
service.
Some of us were contemplat
ing this seeming impossibility
and had we not been seated at
the time, we should have
reeled. Sending the problem
to committee we arrived at a
solution. We would go to the
city and review some restaur
ants.
Feeling a need for economy,
we went to the Savoy Tivoli
where we ran up a bill in excess
of twenty dollars. Not very
economic, vou say. Well, there

were'two of us and we ate like
horses.
The Savoy isunlikeany place
we had ever been in. Vou may
have seen a sidewalk terrace,
you may have seen a dining
room with plain tables covered
with butcher paper and you
may have seen a cabaret
theater, where incidentally the
show "What a Marvelous
Party" is still playing, but surely
you have never seen all these
things together with silver
palm trees supporting the ceil
ing and a blue fountain.
We were told to choose our
table ourselves, and we think
we chose the second-best table
in the room. The best is tucked
into an alcove with mock mar
ble partitions, and was already
taken.
Our table was next to the
mock fireplace, a theatrical
thing with blue and silver
wooden fire in it, and deco
rated with a bust that looks

something like Virginia
Woolf, and was the best table
because it had an elaborate
floral design worked into its
top and therefore had no
butcher paper.
We did not order anything to
drink for as I have said before,
we were hungry as bears, and
did not want to delay our meal.
The bar, however is quite ex
tensive. One can order every
thing from a Pimm's Cup, the
thing the English drink at the
Henley Regatta, to a Ricard,
what the French drink as they
play Boules.
We stepped right to the food
part of the menu. The menu is
divided into hot and cold dis
hes, and while most of the hot
side are entrees, the cold por
tion can be either appetizers or
smallish meals, good for a light
lunch.
The most interesting of the

cold side were Salad Nicoise
($3.95) a salad with eggs, an
chovies and olives, Ratatouille
Vinaigrette ($2.25), and Steak
Tartare ($4.95). From this side
we ordered Pate Campagne
($2.50), and salad. ($.75).
We then sent the waiter away
and consulted the wine list.
This listcontainsagreatvariety
of American, and European
wines ranging in price from $3
a bottle to around $20 a bottle.
We ordered a 1964 Alsatian
Rielsing ($5). It was delicious,
light, dry and plenty of flavor.
It also went well with our two
tasty slices of pate, served with
artichoke hearts, pimento,
pickles and lettuce, and was
eaten on French bread, not
sour dough, with unsalted but
ter.
The salad that arrived soon
after the pate included
romaine lettuce, tomatoes,

cucumbers and fresh chives
with a creamy vinaigrette dres
sing.
From the hot side of the
menu we ordered French
onion soup ($1.95), cauliflower
soup ($1.50), Paella ($4.95) and
filet of sole Florentine ($4.95).
The onion soup came piping
hot and covered with cheese
and had an entire slice of
French bread floating in it. The
cauliflower soup was a good
cream soup, but some of us
kept stealing spoonfuls of
onion soup while neglecting
the cauliflower soup.
The Paella and sole were
quite magnificent. The Paella
had plenty of fresh clams,
shrimp, fish, peppers, and ar
tichokes, a good piece of chic
ken and not too much saffron
on the rice. The sole was
steeped in an herb and butter
sauce, rested on a bed of
spinach and rice and was co
vered with fresh chives.

When we had downed the
last bit of chicken and fish, and
swallowed the last of that peer
less wine, we started our walk
back to the car. This was
parked nearly at Coit Tower;
parking in this district is a prob
lem. The walk to the car proved
to be enough exercise to ena
ble us to contemplate desert at
Just Desserts. We hauled the
car doors closed and were off.
Just Desserts
1469 Pacific
San Francisco
This time we pulled into a
space right in front of the re
staurant just as some well-fed
people were pulling out.
lust Desserts is a high, bright
room with a mezzanine floor
where one can smoke while
eating. One stands in line wait
ing to give one's order while
looking at all manner of lu
scious confections protected

by glass. All the offerings look
rich and good.
Cheesecake seems to be a
specialty so we ordered a slice
of Kahlua cheesecake, and a
slice of banana nut cake. We
collected these along with two
small bottles of natural fruit
juice and set off to find a table.
We found one of the butcher
block variety near two recorder
players who were playing
medieval tunes. Our desserts
turned out very well, especially
the cheesecake. It had just the
right hint of liqueur. The
banana cake was a careful con
struction of different flavors,
walnut, banana and stawberry
jam. Of these the jam was a bit
too rich.
Fortunately, this time when
we staggered out the door our
car was just across the
sidewalk. We would never
have made it up any hill.
