Mazzocco's
2808 Middlefield Road
Redwood City
Mazzocco's has been serv
ing home-style Italian cooking
in Redwood City for 30 years
now and I have yet to find a
restaurant that can match it in
price for a satisfying meal. My
favorite meal here consists of
their dinner salad with an
tipasto ($1.25) and spaghetti
with white clam sauce ($2.95).
A large portion of spaghetti
arrives that can suffice as a
meal in itself. Garlic lovers
should ask for additional garlic
in the white clam sauce as the
cook will oblige. Spaghetti
here is cooked longer to
American taste and Italians ac

cusomed to spaghetti "al de
nte" may be better off toiling
over their own stoves.
A choice of dressing is of
fered with the salad and since I
find their oil and vinegar heavy
on the vinegar, I ask for the
roquefort.
The atmosphere at Mazzoc
co's is friendly and warm as be
fits a neighborhood
restaurant-bar. The juke box is
the ethnic leveler, providing a
choice of pop, country and
hispanic tunes in tribute to the
cross section of Mazzocco's
clientel.
Liquor is served as well as
wine, and the wines are all
California. The house wine is
California Reserve at $.60 a

glass, $1.15 a half bottle and $2
a bottle. Chablis, Rose and
Burgundy are the house wine
choices.
Six red wines from Mondavi
and Sebastiani are available
from $2.25 to $5.75, one Sebas
tiani Rose at $3.75, and two
Wente white wines at $3.50 and
$4.50, as well as one cham
pagne at $5.
Dining at Mozzocco's with
two friends Monday night pro
vided an opportunity to stray
slightly from established favo
rites. One of us tried the chic
ken noodle soup ($.75) and we
all had the dinner salad with
antipasto ($1.25), which
everyone agreed was excel
lent. Dividing an order of

spaghetti with white clam
sauce ($2.95) between us, we
all managed to taste this de
lectable dish
One of my friends chose one
of the specials — meat loaf with
spaghetti ($2.75) accompanied
with mixed vegetables cooked
to a nice crunch. Portions were
generous and, I was told, tasty.
In the future she said she
would prefer to have the
spaghetti with oil, butter and
garlic and the meat loaf with
tomato sauce, since both the
spaghetti and the meat loaf
were served with tomato
sauce. Another friend decided
on the a la carte pot roast with
ravioli ($3.75) and mixed veget
ables.

I picked the larger a la carte
sirloin steak ($4.70) served with
mixed vegetables. Mazzocco's
steaks are U.S.D.A. choice
beef with no tenderizer added
and I found mine rare as or
dered and savory.
Complementing our dinner
was a pleasant Sebastiani
Cabernet Sauvignon ($5.75).
Service was excellent and our
waitress, Candy, who was
thoughtful, patient and unob
trusive, provided, in combina
tion with the hearty cooking, a
happy departure from the
lackluster combination that is
the staple of so many higher
priced, "moderate" restaur
ants.

Mazzocco's
2808 Middlefield Road
Redwood City
Mazzocco's has been serv
ing home-style Italian cooking
in Redwood City for 30 years
now and I have yet to find a
restaurant that can match it in
price for a satisfying meal. My
favorite meal here consists of
their dinner salad with an
tipasto ($1.25) and spaghetti
with white clam sauce ($2.95).
A large portion of spaghetti
arrives that can suffice as a
meal in itself. Garlic lovers
should ask for additional garlic
in the white clam sauce as the
cook will oblige. Spaghetti
here is cooked longer to
American taste and Italians ac

cusomed to spaghetti "al de
nte" may be better off toiling
over their own stoves.
A choice of dressing is of
fered with the salad and since I
find their oil and vinegar heavy
on the vinegar, I ask for the
roquefort.
The atmosphere at Mazzoc
co's is friendly and warm as be
fits a neighborhood
restaurant-bar. The juke box is
the ethnic leveler, providing a
choice of pop, country and
hispanic tunes in tribute to the
cross section of Mazzocco's
clientel.
Liquor is served as well as
wine, and the wines are all
California. The house wine is
California Reserve at $.60 a

glass, $1.15 a half bottle and $2
a bottle. Chablis, Rose and
Burgundy are the house wine
choices.
Six red wines from Mondavi
and Sebastiani are available
from $2.25 to $5.75, one Sebas
tiani Rose at $3.75, and two
Wente white wines at $3.50 and
$4.50, as well as one cham
pagne at $5.
Dining at Mozzocco's with
two friends Monday night pro
vided an opportunity to stray
slightly from established favo
rites. One of us tried the chic
ken noodle soup ($.75) and we
all had the dinner salad with
antipasto ($1.25), which
everyone agreed was excel
lent. Dividing an order of

spaghetti with white clam
sauce ($2.95) between us, we
all managed to taste this de
lectable dish
One of my friends chose one
of the specials — meat loaf with
spaghetti ($2.75) accompanied
with mixed vegetables cooked
to a nice crunch. Portions were
generous and, I was told, tasty.
In the future she said she
would prefer to have the
spaghetti with oil, butter and
garlic and the meat loaf with
tomato sauce, since both the
spaghetti and the meat loaf
were served with tomato
sauce. Another friend decided
on the a la carte pot roast with
ravioli ($3.75) and mixed veget
ables.

I picked the larger a la carte
sirloin steak ($4.70) served with
mixed vegetables. Mazzocco's
steaks are U.S.D.A. choice
beef with no tenderizer added
and I found mine rare as or
dered and savory.
Complementing our dinner
was a pleasant Sebastiani
Cabernet Sauvignon ($5.75).
Service was excellent and our
waitress, Candy, who was
thoughtful, patient and unob
trusive, provided, in combina
tion with the hearty cooking, a
happy departure from the
lackluster combination that is
the staple of so many higher
priced, "moderate" restaur
ants.

Mazzocco's
2808 Middlefield Road
Redwood City
Mazzocco's has been serv
ing home-style Italian cooking
in Redwood City for 30 years
now and I have yet to find a
restaurant that can match it in
price for a satisfying meal. My
favorite meal here consists of
their dinner salad with an
tipasto ($1.25) and spaghetti
with white clam sauce ($2.95).
A large portion of spaghetti
arrives that can suffice as a
meal in itself. Garlic lovers
should ask for additional garlic
in the white clam sauce as the
cook will oblige. Spaghetti
here is cooked longer to
American taste and Italians ac

cusomed to spaghetti "al de
nte" may be better off toiling
over their own stoves.
A choice of dressing is of
fered with the salad and since I
find their oil and vinegar heavy
on the vinegar, I ask for the
roquefort.
The atmosphere at Mazzoc
co's is friendly and warm as be
fits a neighborhood
restaurant-bar. The juke box is
the ethnic leveler, providing a
choice of pop, country and
hispanic tunes in tribute to the
cross section of Mazzocco's
clientel.
Liquor is served as well as
wine, and the wines are all
California. The house wine is
California Reserve at $.60 a

glass, $1.15 a half bottle and $2
a bottle. Chablis, Rose and
Burgundy are the house wine
choices.
Six red wines from Mondavi
and Sebastiani are available
from $2.25 to $5.75, one Sebas
tiani Rose at $3.75, and two
Wente white wines at $3.50 and
$4.50, as well as one cham
pagne at $5.
Dining at Mozzocco's with
two friends Monday night pro
vided an opportunity to stray
slightly from established favo
rites. One of us tried the chic
ken noodle soup ($.75) and we
all had the dinner salad with
antipasto ($1.25), which
everyone agreed was excel
lent. Dividing an order of

spaghetti with white clam
sauce ($2.95) between us, we
all managed to taste this de
lectable dish
One of my friends chose one
of the specials — meat loaf with
spaghetti ($2.75) accompanied
with mixed vegetables cooked
to a nice crunch. Portions were
generous and, I was told, tasty.
In the future she said she
would prefer to have the
spaghetti with oil, butter and
garlic and the meat loaf with
tomato sauce, since both the
spaghetti and the meat loaf
were served with tomato
sauce. Another friend decided
on the a la carte pot roast with
ravioli ($3.75) and mixed veget
ables.

I picked the larger a la carte
sirloin steak ($4.70) served with
mixed vegetables. Mazzocco's
steaks are U.S.D.A. choice
beef with no tenderizer added
and I found mine rare as or
dered and savory.
Complementing our dinner
was a pleasant Sebastiani
Cabernet Sauvignon ($5.75).
Service was excellent and our
waitress, Candy, who was
thoughtful, patient and unob
trusive, provided, in combina
tion with the hearty cooking, a
happy departure from the
lackluster combination that is
the staple of so many higher
priced, "moderate" restaur
ants.
