# Football recruiting — the year-long effort nears its payoff
## 
### Emilie Deutsch 
Recruiting is a year-round
occupation.
This year it culminates Feb.
15 at 8 a.m. when hundreds of
high school and junior college
football players can first sign
their national letters of intent,
promising to play for a specific
university. Most of them have
been hounded by coaches,
wined and dined at the ex
pense of athletic departments,
and shown the social,
academic and athletic virtues
of several institutions. The
coaches have done all they can
to persuade, entertain and
convince the athlete. Now it's
up to him.
Doug Single is Stanford's re
cruiting coordinator and over
sees the different geographic
recruiting areas and coordi
nates the number of scholar
ships with the number of ad
missions.
It's no small task.
The investigatory work starts
in the spring with the mailing
of a prospect questionnaire to
every high school football
coach in the country.
Single said the return rate on
the questionnaire is about 70
per cent, and includes each
coach's top three prospects.
Transcripts are then requested
and by July the football office
has 500 to 700 prospects from
which to weed out the ones
that will undoubtedly be de
nied admission to Stanford.
"We don't try to do the job of
the Admissions Office," said
Single, "but we know the ones
who definitely will not be ad
mitted."
By the first of August, the list

has been cut to about 200
players and the real examina
tion of talent begins.
"By the middle of our regular
season, we have a workable
number of about 150 pros
pects. Then we start the con
centration," said Single.
By winter the 150 has dwin
dled to about 45 prospects the
coaches are actively recruiting.
"Some may not pick Stan
ford," said Single, "and some
may not get in, but we rate
them on a scale of one through
45 and if the top 20 are ac
cepted, they get scholarships.
If they turn down our offer, we
go on down the line."
This year almost all of the 20
scholarships Stanford can offer
will be given to high school
athletes rather than junior col
lege transfers. Often students
that attended a JC have high
school grade problems and,
though the NCAA grade point
average has a bottom limit of
2.0, Stanford's requirements
are more stringent.
"We have no stated GPA re
quirement," said Single, "but
we have certain requirements
we set in our department here.
Anyone under a 3.9 should
have SAT scores that offset that
CPA or must be one of the top
two people we're recruiting.
"We have certain paramet
ers that aren't stated. But we
can't get a 2.0 with 200-200 SAT
scores in here. No matter how
good he is on the football field,
we cannot get him into
school."
As in other years, the geog
raphic emphasis is nationwide,
"although southern California
has such a great pool of

athletes we find ourselves
down there all the time. Due to
Stanford's high reputation na
tionally, we find ourselves
being able to recruit favorably
on a national basis."
Does the football staff place
more emphasis on a good
athlete or simply filling a posi
tion?

"The best athletes are re
cruited," said Single, "but we
don't want to stock ourselves
with 15 defensive backs just
because they're all great
athletes. We'll sacrifice a poor
offensive lineman for a great
running back, even though we
need an offensive lineman, if it
comes to that."

The recruit has no obligation
to tell any of the schools where
he's going but "it's always to
their benefit to have made up
their minds," said Single.
"Otherwise they'll have six
coaches in their living room
that morning on the 15th of
February, each hoping they'll
sign with them."
You mean they'd send a
coach all the way across the
country to get one signature?
"You bet," replied Single.
"We'll send out a coach on cer
tain important cases or with
someone that hasn't made up
his mind."
And once the athlete accepts
Stanford, the coaches remain
actively interested in him.
"The spring follow-up is ex
tremely important so the
player feels he is going to be a
part of that team next fall," said
Single.
Obviously, recruits decide
not to come to Stanford, no
matter how diligently they
were sought after or how im
pressive the campus is.

Single said he feels the prim
ary reason behind an athlete
turning down the University is
the fear of not being able to
compete academically.
"Other coaches tell them,
'You can't do the work at Stan
ford.' And that's ridiculous,"
said Single.
Buck Club
The money for the scholar
ship comes from the Buck
Club. It's a private organization
formed through the athletic
department, made up of
donors interested in Stanford
athletics. Most of the members
are alumni who contribute
"anywhere from $1 to an en
dowed scholarship of
$125,000." Although some
alums feel they should have
more voice in the recruiting
process because of this
monetary support, Single said
"on the whole our alums are
very knowledgeable and qual
ified. They don't call us up and
say, 'Why aren't you recruiting
so-and-so?' because usually if
we're not recruiting him,

neither are (JSC or UCLA."
On Feb. 15 hundreds of
young men will sign a binding
contract designed to protect
the athlete and the school. If
they decide, once they've
signed, not to honor their let
ter of intent and to transfer to
another school, they must sit
out two years before playing
ball. It's a big decision. And
Single has an inherent under
standing of their position.
"We try to be human about
this but it's tough sometimes.
You work and work on an
athlete and up until the 14th he
says 'I think I'm coming to
Stanford,' then on the day of
the letter, BOOM! — 'I'm
going to USC.' It takes a lot out
of you and it makes you see
that 18-year-old kids don't re
ally know what they want."
But recruiting also has its re
wards.
"It does give you some satis
faction when you have a good
year," said Single. "Then
you've got something to look
forward to."


A prep player's signature on a letter of intent can mean many vic
tories in the future.

that morning on the 15th of
February, each hoping they'll
sign with them."
You mean they'd send a
coach all the way across the
country to get one signature?
"You bet," replied Single.
"We'll send out a coach on cer
tain important cases or with
someone that hasn't made up
his mind."
And once the athlete accepts
Stanford, the coaches remain
actively interested in him.
"The spring follow-up is ex
tremely important so the
player feels he is going to be a
part of that team next fall," said
Single.
Obviously, recruits decide
not to come to Stanford, no
matter how diligently they
were sought after or how im
pressive the campus is.

Single said he feels the prim
ary reason behind an athlete
turning down the University is
the fear of not being able to
compete academically.
"Other coaches tell them,
'You can't do the work at Stan
ford.' And that's ridiculous,"
said Single.
Buck Club
The money for the scholar
ship comes from the Buck
Club. It's a private organization
formed through the athletic
department, made up of
donors interested in Stanford
athletics. Most of the members
are alumni who contribute
"anywhere from $1 to an en
dowed scholarship of
$125,000." Although some
alums feel they should have
more voice in the recruiting
process because of this
monetary support, Single said
"on the whole our alums are
very knowledgeable and qual
ified. They don't call us up and
say, 'Why aren't you recruiting
so-and-so?' because usually if
we're not recruiting him,

neither are (JSC or UCLA."
On Feb. 15 hundreds of
young men will sign a binding
contract designed to protect
the athlete and the school. If
they decide, once they've
signed, not to honor their let
ter of intent and to transfer to
another school, they must sit
out two years before playing
ball. It's a big decision. And
Single has an inherent under
standing of their position.
"We try to be human about
this but it's tough sometimes.
You work and work on an
athlete and up until the 14th he
says 'I think I'm coming to
Stanford,' then on the day of
the letter, BOOM! — 'I'm
going to USC.' It takes a lot out
of you and it makes you see
that 18-year-old kids don't re
ally know what they want."
But recruiting also has its re
wards.
"It does give you some satis
faction when you have a good
year," said Single. "Then
you've got something to look
forward to."


A prep player's signature on a letter of intent can mean many vic
tories in the future.
Recruiting is a year-round
occupation.
This year it culminates Feb.
15 at 8 a.m. when hundreds of
high school and junior college
football players can first sign
their national letters of intent,
promising to play for a specific
university. Most of them have
been hounded by coaches,
wined and dined at the ex
pense of athletic departments,
and shown the social,
academic and athletic virtues
of several institutions. The
coaches have done all they can
to persuade, entertain and
convince the athlete. Now it's
up to him.
Doug Single is Stanford's re
cruiting coordinator and over
sees the different geographic
recruiting areas and coordi
nates the number of scholar
ships with the number of ad
missions.
It's no small task.
The investigatory work starts
in the spring with the mailing
of a prospect questionnaire to
every high school football
coach in the country.
Single said the return rate on
the questionnaire is about 70
per cent, and includes each
coach's top three prospects.
Transcripts are then requested
and by July the football office
has 500 to 700 prospects from
which to weed out the ones
that will undoubtedly be de
nied admission to Stanford.
"We don't try to do the job of
the Admissions Office," said
Single, "but we know the ones
who definitely will not be ad
mitted."
By the first of August, the list

has been cut to about 200
players and the real examina
tion of talent begins.
"By the middle of our regular
season, we have a workable
number of about 150 pros
pects. Then we start the con
centration," said Single.
By winter the 150 has dwin
dled to about 45 prospects the
coaches are actively recruiting.
"Some may not pick Stan
ford," said Single, "and some
may not get in, but we rate
them on a scale of one through
45 and if the top 20 are ac
cepted, they get scholarships.
If they turn down our offer, we
go on down the line."
This year almost all of the 20
scholarships Stanford can offer
will be given to high school
athletes rather than junior col
lege transfers. Often students
that attended a JC have high
school grade problems and,
though the NCAA grade point
average has a bottom limit of
2.0, Stanford's requirements
are more stringent.
"We have no stated GPA re
quirement," said Single, "but
we have certain requirements
we set in our department here.
Anyone under a 3.9 should
have SAT scores that offset that
CPA or must be one of the top
two people we're recruiting.
"We have certain paramet
ers that aren't stated. But we
can't get a 2.0 with 200-200 SAT
scores in here. No matter how
good he is on the football field,
we cannot get him into
school."
As in other years, the geog
raphic emphasis is nationwide,
"although southern California
has such a great pool of

athletes we find ourselves
down there all the time. Due to
Stanford's high reputation na
tionally, we find ourselves
being able to recruit favorably
on a national basis."
Does the football staff place
more emphasis on a good
athlete or simply filling a posi
tion?

"The best athletes are re
cruited," said Single, "but we
don't want to stock ourselves
with 15 defensive backs just
because they're all great
athletes. We'll sacrifice a poor
offensive lineman for a great
running back, even though we
need an offensive lineman, if it
comes to that."

The recruit has no obligation
to tell any of the schools where
he's going but "it's always to
their benefit to have made up
their minds," said Single.
"Otherwise they'll have six
coaches in their living room
that morning on the 15th of

which to weed out the ones
that will undoubtedly be de
nied admission to Stanford.
"We don't try to do the job of
the Admissions Office," said
Single, "but we know the ones
who definitely will not be ad
mitted."
By the first of August, the list

has been cut to about 200
players and the real examina
tion of talent begins.
"By the middle of our regular
season, we have a workable
number of about 150 pros
pects. Then we start the con
centration," said Single.
By winter the 150 has dwin
dled to about 45 prospects the
coaches are actively recruiting.
"Some may not pick Stan
ford," said Single, "and some
may not get in, but we rate
them on a scale of one through
45 and if the top 20 are ac
cepted, they get scholarships.
If they turn down our offer, we
go on down the line."
This year almost all of the 20
scholarships Stanford can offer
will be given to high school
athletes rather than junior col
lege transfers. Often students
that attended a JC have high
school grade problems and,
though the NCAA grade point
average has a bottom limit of
2.0, Stanford's requirements
are more stringent.
"We have no stated GPA re
quirement," said Single, "but
we have certain requirements
we set in our department here.
Anyone under a 3.9 should
have SAT scores that offset that
CPA or must be one of the top
two people we're recruiting.
"We have certain paramet
ers that aren't stated. But we
can't get a 2.0 with 200-200 SAT
scores in here. No matter how
good he is on the football field,
we cannot get him into
school."
As in other years, the geog
raphic emphasis is nationwide,
"although southern California
has such a great pool of

athletes we find ourselves
down there all the time. Due to
Stanford's high reputation na
tionally, we find ourselves
being able to recruit favorably
on a national basis."
Does the football staff place
more emphasis on a good
athlete or simply filling a posi
tion?

"The best athletes are re
cruited," said Single, "but we
don't want to stock ourselves
with 15 defensive backs just
because they're all great
athletes. We'll sacrifice a poor
offensive lineman for a great
running back, even though we
need an offensive lineman, if it
comes to that."

The recruit has no obligation
to tell any of the schools where
he's going but "it's always to
their benefit to have made up
their minds," said Single.
"Otherwise they'll have six
coaches in their living room
that morning on the 15th of
February, each hoping they'll
sign with them."
You mean they'd send a
coach all the way across the
country to get one signature?
"You bet," replied Single.
"We'll send out a coach on cer
tain important cases or with
someone that hasn't made up
his mind."
And once the athlete accepts
Stanford, the coaches remain
actively interested in him.
"The spring follow-up is ex
tremely important so the
player feels he is going to be a
part of that team next fall," said
Single.
Obviously, recruits decide
not to come to Stanford, no
matter how diligently they
were sought after or how im
pressive the campus is.

Single said he feels the prim
ary reason behind an athlete
turning down the University is
the fear of not being able to
compete academically.
"Other coaches tell them,
'You can't do the work at Stan
ford.' And that's ridiculous,"
said Single.
Buck Club
The money for the scholar
ship comes from the Buck
Club. It's a private organization
formed through the athletic
department, made up of
donors interested in Stanford
athletics. Most of the members
are alumni who contribute
"anywhere from $1 to an en
dowed scholarship of
$125,000." Although some
alums feel they should have
more voice in the recruiting
process because of this
monetary support, Single said
"on the whole our alums are
very knowledgeable and qual
ified. They don't call us up and
say, 'Why aren't you recruiting
so-and-so?' because usually if
we're not recruiting him,

neither are (JSC or UCLA."
On Feb. 15 hundreds of
young men will sign a binding
contract designed to protect
the athlete and the school. If
they decide, once they've
signed, not to honor their let
ter of intent and to transfer to
another school, they must sit
out two years before playing
ball. It's a big decision. And
Single has an inherent under
standing of their position.
"We try to be human about
this but it's tough sometimes.
You work and work on an
athlete and up until the 14th he
says 'I think I'm coming to
Stanford,' then on the day of
the letter, BOOM! — 'I'm
going to USC.' It takes a lot out
of you and it makes you see
that 18-year-old kids don't re
ally know what they want."
But recruiting also has its re
wards.
"It does give you some satis
faction when you have a good
year," said Single. "Then
you've got something to look
forward to."


A prep player's signature on a letter of intent can mean many vic
tories in the future.
Recruiting is a year-round
occupation.
This year it culminates Feb.
15 at 8 a.m. when hundreds of
high school and junior college
football players can first sign
their national letters of intent,
promising to play for a specific
university. Most of them have
been hounded by coaches,
wined and dined at the ex
pense of athletic departments,
and shown the social,
academic and athletic virtues
of several institutions. The
coaches have done all they can
to persuade, entertain and
convince the athlete. Now it's
up to him.
Doug Single is Stanford's re
cruiting coordinator and over
sees the different geographic
recruiting areas and coordi
nates the number of scholar
ships with the number of ad
missions.
It's no small task.
The investigatory work starts
in the spring with the mailing
of a prospect questionnaire to
every high school football
coach in the country.
Single said the return rate on
the questionnaire is about 70
per cent, and includes each
coach's top three prospects.
Transcripts are then requested
and by July the football office
has 500 to 700 prospects from
which to weed out the ones
that will undoubtedly be de
nied admission to Stanford.
