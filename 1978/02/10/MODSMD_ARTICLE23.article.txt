# How the Cardinals lure 'em to the Farm

They come to Palo Alto and
descend upon the Stanford
campus, attending the basket
ball games, experiencing the
frat parties, and getting treated
to breakfast, lunch and dinner
by some of the top professors,
coaches and football players in
the nation.
Football recruiting season is
in full swing and on several
weekends during winter quar
ter, Stanford's top high school
prospects come to visit the
campus. Many also happen to
be the top national prospects
as well, so the campus visit is
often the deciding factor in the
athlete's choice of a school.
And it's true — many schools
will do anything to please, ap
pease, and satisfy their 18-
year-old guests.
"I had one school try to re
cruit my girlfriend," said quar
terback Steve Dils who is hous
ing some of the recruits during
their stays.
At one southern school 30
college girls from a field of 300
applicants were chosen to help
recruit the players. Dates were
arranged during the visit, and
letters were written before and
after.
"It's nothing but a big busi
ness," commented one Stan
ford ballplayer. "Having a win
ning team adds to the prestige
of the school. And prestige
draws more support, and more
money."
But the ballplayers that
choose Stanford aren't impre
ssed by the monetary — or
female — enticements. "It's a
different individual that comes
to play for Stanford," said Dave
Morze, a prospect from San
Carlos.
Nonetheless, no matter
which school a player eventu
ally signs with, the time bet
ween the initial contact in the
spring of his junior year and
the time he makes that final
decision is one of great pres
sure and inward speculation.

"The trip itself is nice," said
Morze, "but if you visit six
schools in as many weeks,
you're exhausted by the end."
And the campus visit hardly
signifies the end of the pres
sure.
"I used to hide out at my
girlfriend's," said Dils. "They'd
even call me there and ask if I
wanted to go get a Coke or
something."
Always around
"The coaches are coming
around constantly," said
Morze, who has narrowed his
choices down to the Bay Area
Pacific-8 rivals. "They flash
their school rings or watches
and talk in your ear for an
hour."
Morze, who is less than a
week away from making his
final decision is confused and
uptight. "I'm trying to decide
myself," he said. "I list the
points of the two schools and
compare them. But it gets to
you after a while. I get asked
'where are you going' 10 times
a day. I'd rather just put it out
of my mind."
Unfortunately, he won't be
able to do that until Feb. 15.
Stanford recruiting trips are
organized by the coaches who
arrange meetings or meals with
alumni and professors to clear
up any questions or erase any
doubts the prospects might
have about any aspect of the
University.
Morze's schedule started
Saturday afternoon with lunch
at the Faculty Club. After
watching a film of football
highlights and meeting the
alumni at Rickey's Hyatt
House, he went to dinner at
the Sundance Mining Com
pany. Other weekends, the re
cruits might meet with profes
sors who share an academic in
terest such as business, law or
medical school. They go over
offense and defense with the
coaches, go to basketball
games, and meet Stanford
alums that have gone on to be

professional athletes.
And as for the players which
host the recruits, they're given
$27 to "show him a good time,
keep him busy, and teach him
something about the school,
not only the ball club," said
Dils.
"If you get good recruits,"
he said, "you don't mind hav
ing them at all, plus you get to
eat in good places. But with
others, it's like babysitting for

48 hours."
And when the visit's over,
the veterans report back to the
coaches, telling them about
the recruits impressions and
feelings. "Only if a recruiter's
comments are very negative
could it possibly influence a
coach's decision," said Dils.
The recruiting trips are es
sential for an athlete to make
the decision he will be hap

piest with.
"It's good to have a good
time," said Morze, "but you're
really here to find out what the
school's all about."
As for how Stanford's re
cruiting is run, Morze feels
"it's not low-key, but it's not
hard-sell. They don't come on
to you, although they're in
terested in being successful.
Besides," he added, "the Uni
versity speaks for itself."
