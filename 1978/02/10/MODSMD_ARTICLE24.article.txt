# DiBiaso tries to turn it around

When a team is 1-6 in conference and in last
place, one gets the feeling somewhere things
went wrong.
But in the case of the tumbling fortunes of the
Stanford basketball team, the patient would not
be in intensive care "had we won a couple of
close games we lost," said coach Dick Dißiaso.
The closest of those losses came in Los
Angeles Sports Arena last Saturday when Cliff
Robinson hit a jumper with two seconds left to
deal the Cards a gut-ripping 76-74 defeat. De
spite the loss, Dißiaso said he thought his team
had played its best game of recent weeks.
"If we would have played that well against
some other teams," he said, "we would have
beaten them."
But before the Cards worry about any other
teams, they'll again have to cope with the Tro
jans, who they host tonight in Maples Pavilion.
Tip-off is 8 p.m. (KZSU 90.1 FM, KSFO 560 AM).
USC coach Bob Boyd has his team in second
place with a 5-2 conference record, and he
promised this week the Trojans will be more
inspired than they were Saturday. "We had to
struggle at home to beat both those teams (Cal
and Stanford), so there's no doubt in our
players' minds that we'll have to play well," said
Boyd. "There's one good thing: because it was
so hard for us last weekend, there's no chance
for a letdown this weekend."
Besides game-winner Robinson, the Pacific
-B's top scorer with 18.3 average and the player of
the week, the Trojans have three other players
averaging in double figures.
Tomorrow the Bruins
But the considerable talent the Trojans have
pales in comparison to the star-studded UCLA
roster. From the conference's top guard combi
nation of Roy Hamilton (first in assists and fourth
in scoring) and Ray Townsend (top field goal
shooter) to the Bruins' big and quick front court,

the Bruins are unparalleled, and also unde
feated, in the Pacific-8.
With that solid of a team, what chance will
Stanford have against UCLA tomorrow night?
"We have to make play well and contribute to
them not playing well," said Dißiaso.
Last Thursday UCLA did not play poorly. The
Bruins played nearly perfect and ripped Stan
ford, 101-64. "We felt disappointed about losing
and how we lost," said Dißiaso.
But the one-sidedness of the loss did not have
a permanent effect on the Cards. "It's not easy
to be on the road and lose like we did on Thurs
day and then play emotionally on Saturday,"
said Dißiaso. "Some teams would have said,
'Hey, let's cash this in.' "
No big changes
Dißiaso doesn't plan any major changes, even
though forward Kimberly Belton, the team's top
scorer and rebounder with 15.2 and 8.9 aver
ages, has been bothered by his sore knee.
"What you have to guard against is making
drastic changes just cause you lost," said Di-
Biaso. "We are tryingnot to think likea 1-6 team.
We realize we are, but we could easily not be."
Whereas Stanford thrived on winning the
close games of the non-conference schedule,
four of its Pac-8 losses have come in games that
weren't decided until the final two minutes.
"We have tried not to get too technical or
make excuses for it," said Dißiaso. "For in
stance, there is no play that has Jeff McHugh
tipping the ball in at the buzzer." McHugh's
last-second bucket against Santa Clara gave the
Cards a 69-67 victory in November.
But the hopes for a successful conference
season nurtured by wins over good non-confer
ence opponents have withered in the wake of
two three-game losing streaks in the Pac-8.
"We've said we're into a seven-game season
and four of them are at home," said Dißiaso.
"Let's see what we can do."

last-second bucket against Santa Clara gave the
Cards a 69-67 victory in November.
But the hopes for a successful conference
season nurtured by wins over good non-confer
ence opponents have withered in the wake of
two three-game losing streaks in the Pac-8.
"We've said we're into a seven-game season
and four of them are at home," said Dißiaso.
"Let's see what we can do."
When a team is 1-6 in conference and in last
place, one gets the feeling somewhere things
went wrong.
But in the case of the tumbling fortunes of the
Stanford basketball team, the patient would not
be in intensive care "had we won a couple of
close games we lost," said coach Dick Dißiaso.
The closest of those losses came in Los
Angeles Sports Arena last Saturday when Cliff
Robinson hit a jumper with two seconds left to
deal the Cards a gut-ripping 76-74 defeat. De
spite the loss, Dißiaso said he thought his team
had played its best game of recent weeks.
"If we would have played that well against
some other teams," he said, "we would have
beaten them."
But before the Cards worry about any other
teams, they'll again have to cope with the Tro
jans, who they host tonight in Maples Pavilion.
Tip-off is 8 p.m. (KZSU 90.1 FM, KSFO 560 AM).
USC coach Bob Boyd has his team in second
place with a 5-2 conference record, and he
promised this week the Trojans will be more
inspired than they were Saturday. "We had to
struggle at home to beat both those teams (Cal
and Stanford), so there's no doubt in our
players' minds that we'll have to play well," said
Boyd. "There's one good thing: because it was
so hard for us last weekend, there's no chance
for a letdown this weekend."
Besides game-winner Robinson, the Pacific
-B's top scorer with 18.3 average and the player of
the week, the Trojans have three other players
averaging in double figures.
Tomorrow the Bruins
But the considerable talent the Trojans have
pales in comparison to the star-studded UCLA
roster. From the conference's top guard combi
nation of Roy Hamilton (first in assists and fourth
in scoring) and Ray Townsend (top field goal
shooter) to the Bruins' big and quick front court,

the Bruins are unparalleled, and also unde
feated, in the Pacific-8.
With that solid of a team, what chance will
Stanford have against UCLA tomorrow night?
"We have to make play well and contribute to
them not playing well," said Dißiaso.
Last Thursday UCLA did not play poorly. The
Bruins played nearly perfect and ripped Stan
ford, 101-64. "We felt disappointed about losing
and how we lost," said Dißiaso.
But the one-sidedness of the loss did not have
a permanent effect on the Cards. "It's not easy
to be on the road and lose like we did on Thurs
day and then play emotionally on Saturday,"
said Dißiaso. "Some teams would have said,
'Hey, let's cash this in.' "
No big changes
Dißiaso doesn't plan any major changes, even
though forward Kimberly Belton, the team's top
scorer and rebounder with 15.2 and 8.9 aver
ages, has been bothered by his sore knee.
"What you have to guard against is making
drastic changes just cause you lost," said Di-
Biaso. "We are tryingnot to think likea 1-6 team.
We realize we are, but we could easily not be."
Whereas Stanford thrived on winning the
close games of the non-conference schedule,
four of its Pac-8 losses have come in games that
weren't decided until the final two minutes.
"We have tried not to get too technical or
make excuses for it," said Dißiaso. "For in
stance, there is no play that has Jeff McHugh
tipping the ball in at the buzzer." McHugh's
last-second bucket against Santa Clara gave the
Cards a 69-67 victory in November.
