# Women lose in gymnastics
##

San Jose â€” A healthier and
improved version of San Jose's
women gymnastics team
dominated Wednesday night's
meet, outscoring Stanford by a
125.65 to 107.05 margin.
Looking even stronger than
they had in their appearance in
Maples Pavilion last month, the
Spartans assembled nine indi
vidual season high scores to
reach a new team total record
for the year.
"We were suffering from in
juries and mental fatigue," said
Stanford's head coach Jackie
Walker. "We've had four
meets in three and a half
weeks; before that some of the
girls hadn't competed for two
years. I think it's taken its toll."
Top finishers for the Cardi
nals were Linda Park, who
placed third in vaulting, and
Saundra Muramatsu, who
earned third on uneven bars
and fourth on beam.
"There were some high
points. Overall the general im
pression was bad because we
had a few more breaks than we
expected and a few more mis
takes than expected. Linda did
her best vault of the year and
we had 32 points overall on

vaulting. We had a nationally
rated judge on vaulting, so that
was really a high point, but the
whole feeling of the meet was a
down feeling," Walker said.
The men's gymnastics team
continues its season, facing
UCLA and the 49ers at Long
Beach State tonight at 8 p.m.
The Cardinals also compete
tomorrow night against an
injury-weakened USC team at
7:30 p.m.
