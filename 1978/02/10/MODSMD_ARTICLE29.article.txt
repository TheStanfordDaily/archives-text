# Halftime show
## Band ready for Trojans 
### John Nielsen 
Good evening Mr. and Mrs. America, and all
the ships at sea.
University officials are having trouble under
standing how it came to pass that LSJUMB was
allowed to prepare a halftime show for the USC
basketball game tonight. Since the Band has a
reputation as a smelly and disgusting organiza
tion, it was not surprising that many showed
considerable concern.
"They'll wreck the floor," said non-existent
scorekeeper Sid Bloch. "They'll probably wear
black-soled hospital shoes out there, or else use
pogo sticks. As far as I'm concerned this will be a
dark day in Stanford basketball history, perhaps
the darkest since we lost to those scummy Tro
jan mongrels last weekend."
"I can't figure it out either," said athletic de
partment yell leader Gary Cavalli, who was
nevercontacted. "The papers have my signature
on them, but I don't remember ever spelling my
name with three v's. I don't believe they'll actu
ally do a show, since I don't believe that anyone
in the Band has control of their legs by halftime,
but if they do make it out it couldn't be worse
than what those loathesome Cal weenies did last
month with their pointy little weenie boots.
"I must admit it upsets my schedule of
obscure halftime entertainments to allow them
out there, but I guess the midget women
wrestlers will just have to wait until next week."
Cavalli was convincing, but several positively
undivulgable sources expressed doubts that he
had told the whole story. President Lyman, for

example (I could be lying about this), was heard
to utter something about "Korean influence
peddling, which is a real pain, because nobody
ever calls me about these things."
And basketball coach Dick Dißiaso, whose
name cannot be disclosed for similar reasons
(we never talked to him), expressed a hope that
"the whole crummy organization would just dry
up and blow away," promising as well that he
would replace them instantly if they make the
slightest mistake.
Within the Band itself opinions are somewhat
divided as to the type of show to be performed.
Drum Major Dard Farb favors an all-nude re
enactment of the recent Old Union sit-in, while
more traditional factions claim that the show will
consist of pictoral interpretations of Crendel's
dismemberment in Beowulf. Manager Al )ar
detzky locked himself in office and would give
no comment.
Yet despite the multifariousness of the above
pronouncements, most wizened observers ex
pect that the Band will, indeed, sponsor a full
regalia performance this evening in Maples
Pavilion. "I expect that the Band will, indeed,
sponsor a full regalia performance," said one,
who added later that he expected it to be in
Maples this evening.
And so it goes. The empire is crumbling, and
the battlements are afire, but LSJUMB continues
to cater nimbly in its chamber to the lascivious
pleasings of a lute. Nobody knows how they did
it, but they have arranged to — tonight,
halftime, at the USC basketball game. So long.

to utter something about "Korean influence
peddling, which is a real pain, because nobody
ever calls me about these things."
And basketball coach Dick Dißiaso, whose
name cannot be disclosed for similar reasons
(we never talked to him), expressed a hope that
"the whole crummy organization would just dry
up and blow away," promising as well that he
would replace them instantly if they make the
slightest mistake.
Within the Band itself opinions are somewhat
divided as to the type of show to be performed.
Drum Major Dard Farb favors an all-nude re
enactment of the recent Old Union sit-in, while
more traditional factions claim that the show will
consist of pictoral interpretations of Crendel's
dismemberment in Beowulf. Manager Al )ar
detzky locked himself in office and would give
no comment.
Yet despite the multifariousness of the above
pronouncements, most wizened observers ex
pect that the Band will, indeed, sponsor a full
regalia performance this evening in Maples
Pavilion. "I expect that the Band will, indeed,
sponsor a full regalia performance," said one,
who added later that he expected it to be in
Maples this evening.
And so it goes. The empire is crumbling, and
the battlements are afire, but LSJUMB continues
to cater nimbly in its chamber to the lascivious
pleasings of a lute. Nobody knows how they did
it, but they have arranged to — tonight,
halftime, at the USC basketball game. So long.
Good evening Mr. and Mrs. America, and all
the ships at sea.
University officials are having trouble under
standing how it came to pass that LSJUMB was
allowed to prepare a halftime show for the USC
basketball game tonight. Since the Band has a
reputation as a smelly and disgusting organiza
tion, it was not surprising that many showed
considerable concern.
"They'll wreck the floor," said non-existent
scorekeeper Sid Bloch. "They'll probably wear
black-soled hospital shoes out there, or else use
pogo sticks. As far as I'm concerned this will be a
dark day in Stanford basketball history, perhaps
the darkest since we lost to those scummy Tro
jan mongrels last weekend."
"I can't figure it out either," said athletic de
partment yell leader Gary Cavalli, who was
nevercontacted. "The papers have my signature
on them, but I don't remember ever spelling my
name with three v's. I don't believe they'll actu
ally do a show, since I don't believe that anyone
in the Band has control of their legs by halftime,
but if they do make it out it couldn't be worse
than what those loathesome Cal weenies did last
month with their pointy little weenie boots.
"I must admit it upsets my schedule of
obscure halftime entertainments to allow them
out there, but I guess the midget women
wrestlers will just have to wait until next week."
Cavalli was convincing, but several positively
undivulgable sources expressed doubts that he
had told the whole story. President Lyman, for

example (I could be lying about this), was heard
to utter something about "Korean influence
peddling, which is a real pain, because nobody
ever calls me about these things."
