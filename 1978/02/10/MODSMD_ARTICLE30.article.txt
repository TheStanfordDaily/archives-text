# There's more to fencing than jabbing opponents
## Stanford's program enjoys success 
### Julia Johnson 
Precision, agility, temperament —
even nobility — are words used by
Stanford fencers to describe their
sport. "Most people come in with a
conception of the Errol Flynn-type
thing," said junior varsity team
member Karen Krinsky. Even with
the continuing interest in fencing
classes here, many people are not
quite sure what to make of the 16 or
so men and women often found
dancing back and forth in Roble
Gym, skillfully jabbing one another
with swords.
The romantic tradition of fencing
peaked in the 15th and 16th cen
turies, when swordsmanship was a
part of every gentleman's education.
With the development of firearms,
fencing faded out and was only re
vived in England and the United
States early in the 20th century.
Fencing h?s been at Stanford for
many years. )ean Helliwell, the head
coach of the fencing team for the
past 14 years, fenced at Stanford
from 1940-42. Until 1947 she fenced
in the Amateur Fencing League, and
is now involved in several profes
sional fencing organizations. In 1964
she accepted a position at Stanford,
teaching first-year fencing classes.
She developed the program and
began to take the fencers to meets in
the area.
Until then only women had been
allowed in the classes, but men
began to show a strong interest in
the sport. Overcoming the lack of
facilities and equipment, Helliwell
coached them, too. The men en
tered the Western Championships

for the first time in 1%8, and have
since added epee and sabre teams to
the foil teams. Fencing began the era
of coed physical education classes
here, and it became a successful
model for the merging of the men's
and women's athletic departments
in 1974-75. In addition to classes and
team fencing, intramural fencing is
held each spring.
Th.ee weapons
Each of the three weapons has its
own particular use and style. The foil
is lighter than the epee or the sabre,
and only the tip may be used to
score. The action is quick and pre
cise, for the target area is confined to
the torso of the opponent.
While epee is described by team
member Dwight Pridham as "the
most realistic" of the weapons, it is
nevertheless the most subdued in
action. In epee the whole body is the
target, and only the point of the
weapon may be used, leading to
cautious jabs between opponents.
Both epee and foil are electrically
scored; enough pressure on the tip
triggers a light to the side of the fenc
ing strip, where the competition
takes place, and the director of the
bout then stops the fencers and tal
lies the point. The first fencer to re
ceive five touches against him loses
the bout.
The origin of sabre comes from
fighting on horseback, and there
fore the target area is from the waist
up. Sabre tencers can use both the
point and the narrow blade of their
weapon to score, commonly by a
cutting motion. The action is lively
and aggressive, described by Bruce
Chan as also being "the noisiest."

Points in a sabre bout are tallied by
the directoi with the help of four
judges, who stand on either side of
the strip watching for touches.
Four teams
Four fencing teams exist at Stan
ford: men's foil, women's foil,
men's epee and men's sabre. Each
varsity team consists of three players
and one alternate, with an additional
four players composing the junior
varsity squad in each weapon.
While team members responded
positively about the program and
indicated their interest in continuing
the sport, many also commented on
the emphasis on technique at Stan
ford, rather than on strategy in the
play. They also agreed that more in
dividual help is needed and that gre
ater depth in competition and
coaching is necessary for the ad
vanced levels. "Coach Helliwell has
to spread herself thin," said Krinsky.
"She is a foil fencer, and can't help
as much with epee or sabre."
With very few U.S. high schools
offering fencing, most fencers at
Stanford must start at the ground
level. Nearly a year of classes is
necessary before the stance and the
movement become more natural.
Many of the top Stanford fencers are
juniors and seniors, having gained
all their experience here.
The team response to Helliwell is
largely warm and appreciative. "Per
sonable" is the word most often
applied by team members, and as
women's foil captain Eva Lohrer
commented, Helliwell has "a good
philosophy, that they (the fencers)
can have the sport be whatever they
want it to be. She can work with the

ideas people have about fencing,
even when those ideas are different
from her own."
Successful season
Stanford has fenced in 14 meets
since October, eight of those being
Northern California Athletic Con
ference meets. All four teams have
earned their way to San loseStatefor
the NCAC Championship tomorrow
and Sunday. Individuals also com
pete in the championships, and 11
Stanford fencer: will be participat
ing. In women s toil, Stephanie
Knott and Eva Lohrer; in men's foil,
Duncan Proudfoot, Mike Saxenian
and Wesley Witte; i:i epee, Ted Bar
tell, Dwight Pridh."n and Rod Tre
vino; and in sabre, flruce Chan,
Scott Manning and Murray Peck.
By virtue of their seasonal records,
all four teams have already qualified
for the Western Intercollegiate
Championships in Mar h hut indi
viduals must qualify fc them in
the competition this weekend.
Helliwell is satisfied with the fenc
ing performance this season. With
three meets in one week on occa
sion, she said that morale is some
times difficult to maintain. "They
would be psyched up for one meet,
and then two days later have to do it
all again," she said.
Helliwell is particularly pleased
with the success of the epee team,
all of whose members competed in
tercollegiately for the first time this
year. And, while shf faces the loss of
several top fencer*- rn\< vear — in
cludingall three top sabre encers —
she is encouraged >>\ ihe broad in
terest in the fencing classes.

Precision, agility, temperament —
even nobility — are words used by
Stanford fencers to describe their
sport. "Most people come in with a
conception of the Errol Flynn-type
thing," said junior varsity team
member Karen Krinsky. Even with
the continuing interest in fencing
classes here, many people are not
quite sure what to make of the 16 or
so men and women often found
dancing back and forth in Roble
Gym, skillfully jabbing one another
with swords.
The romantic tradition of fencing
peaked in the 15th and 16th cen
turies, when swordsmanship was a
part of every gentleman's education.
With the development of firearms,
fencing faded out and was only re
vived in England and the United
States early in the 20th century.
Fencing h?s been at Stanford for
many years. )ean Helliwell, the head
coach of the fencing team for the
past 14 years, fenced at Stanford
from 1940-42. Until 1947 she fenced
in the Amateur Fencing League, and
is now involved in several profes
sional fencing organizations. In 1964
she accepted a position at Stanford,
teaching first-year fencing classes.
She developed the program and
began to take the fencers to meets in
the area.
Until then only women had been
allowed in the classes, but men
began to show a strong interest in
the sport. Overcoming the lack of
facilities and equipment, Helliwell
coached them, too. The men en
tered the Western Championships

for the first time in 1%8, and have
since added epee and sabre teams to
the foil teams. Fencing began the era
of coed physical education classes
here, and it became a successful
model for the merging of the men's
and women's athletic departments
in 1974-75. In addition to classes and
team fencing, intramural fencing is
held each spring.
Th.ee weapons
Each of the three weapons has its
own particular use and style. The foil
is lighter than the epee or the sabre,
and only the tip may be used to
score. The action is quick and pre
cise, for the target area is confined to
the torso of the opponent.
While epee is described by team
member Dwight Pridham as "the
most realistic" of the weapons, it is
nevertheless the most subdued in
action. In epee the whole body is the
target, and only the point of the
weapon may be used, leading to
cautious jabs between opponents.
Both epee and foil are electrically
scored; enough pressure on the tip
triggers a light to the side of the fenc
ing strip, where the competition
takes place, and the director of the
bout then stops the fencers and tal
lies the point. The first fencer to re
ceive five touches against him loses
the bout.
The origin of sabre comes from
fighting on horseback, and there
fore the target area is from the waist
up. Sabre tencers can use both the
point and the narrow blade of their
weapon to score, commonly by a
cutting motion. The action is lively
and aggressive, described by Bruce
Chan as also being "the noisiest."

Points in a sabre bout are tallied by
the directoi with the help of four
judges, who stand on either side of
the strip watching for touches.
Four teams
Four fencing teams exist at Stan
ford: men's foil, women's foil,
men's epee and men's sabre. Each
varsity team consists of three players
and one alternate, with an additional
four players composing the junior
varsity squad in each weapon.
While team members responded
positively about the program and
indicated their interest in continuing
the sport, many also commented on
the emphasis on technique at Stan
ford, rather than on strategy in the
play. They also agreed that more in
dividual help is needed and that gre
ater depth in competition and
coaching is necessary for the ad
vanced levels. "Coach Helliwell has
to spread herself thin," said Krinsky.
"She is a foil fencer, and can't help
as much with epee or sabre."
With very few U.S. high schools
offering fencing, most fencers at
Stanford must start at the ground
level. Nearly a year of classes is
necessary before the stance and the
movement become more natural.
Many of the top Stanford fencers are
juniors and seniors, having gained
all their experience here.
The team response to Helliwell is
largely warm and appreciative. "Per
sonable" is the word most often
applied by team members, and as
women's foil captain Eva Lohrer
commented, Helliwell has "a good
philosophy, that they (the fencers)
can have the sport be whatever they
want it to be. She can work with the

ideas people have about fencing,
even when those ideas are different
from her own."
Successful season
Stanford has fenced in 14 meets
since October, eight of those being
Northern California Athletic Con
ference meets. All four teams have
earned their way to San loseStatefor
the NCAC Championship tomorrow
and Sunday. Individuals also com
pete in the championships, and 11
Stanford fencer: will be participat
ing. In women s toil, Stephanie
Knott and Eva Lohrer; in men's foil,
Duncan Proudfoot, Mike Saxenian
and Wesley Witte; i:i epee, Ted Bar
tell, Dwight Pridh."n and Rod Tre
vino; and in sabre, flruce Chan,
Scott Manning and Murray Peck.
By virtue of their seasonal records,
all four teams have already qualified
for the Western Intercollegiate
Championships in Mar h hut indi
viduals must qualify fc them in
the competition this weekend.
Helliwell is satisfied with the fenc
ing performance this season. With

Helliwell is particularly pleased
with the success of the epee team,

Precision, agility, temperament —
even nobility — are words used by
Stanford fencers to describe their
sport. "Most people come in with a
conception of the Errol Flynn-type
thing," said junior varsity team
member Karen Krinsky. Even with
the continuing interest in fencing
classes here, many people are not
quite sure what to make of the 16 or
so men and women often found
dancing back and forth in Roble
Gym, skillfully jabbing one another
with swords.
The romantic tradition of fencing
peaked in the 15th and 16th cen
turies, when swordsmanship was a
part of every gentleman's education.
With the development of firearms,
fencing faded out and was only re
vived in England and the United
States early in the 20th century.
Fencing h?s been at Stanford for
many years. )ean Helliwell, the head
coach of the fencing team for the
past 14 years, fenced at Stanford
from 1940-42. Until 1947 she fenced
in the Amateur Fencing League, and
is now involved in several profes
sional fencing organizations. In 1964
she accepted a position at Stanford,
teaching first-year fencing classes.
She developed the program and
began to take the fencers to meets in
the area.
Until then only women had been
allowed in the classes, but men
began to show a strong interest in
the sport. Overcoming the lack of
facilities and equipment, Helliwell
coached them, too. The men en
tered the Western Championships

for the first time in 1%8, and have
since added epee and sabre teams to
the foil teams. Fencing began the era
of coed physical education classes
here, and it became a successful
model for the merging of the men's
and women's athletic departments
in 1974-75. In addition to classes and
team fencing, intramural fencing is
held each spring.
Th.ee weapons
Each of the three weapons has its
own particular use and style. The foil
is lighter than the epee or the sabre,
and only the tip may be used to
score. The action is quick and pre
cise, for the target area is confined to
the torso of the opponent.
While epee is described by team
member Dwight Pridham as "the
most realistic" of the weapons, it is
nevertheless the most subdued in
action. In epee the whole body is the
target, and only the point of the
weapon may be used, leading to
cautious jabs between opponents.
Both epee and foil are electrically
scored; enough pressure on the tip
triggers a light to the side of the fenc
ing strip, where the competition
takes place, and the director of the
bout then stops the fencers and tal
lies the point. The first fencer to re
ceive five touches against him loses
the bout.
The origin of sabre comes from
fighting on horseback, and there
fore the target area is from the waist
up. Sabre tencers can use both the
point and the narrow blade of their
weapon to score, commonly by a
cutting motion. The action is lively
and aggressive, described by Bruce
Chan as also being "the noisiest."

Points in a sabre bout are tallied by
the directoi with the help of four
judges, who stand on either side of
the strip watching for touches.
Four teams
Four fencing teams exist at Stan
ford: men's foil, women's foil,
men's epee and men's sabre. Each
varsity team consists of three players
and one alternate, with an additional
four players composing the junior
varsity squad in each weapon.
While team members responded
positively about the program and
indicated their interest in continuing
the sport, many also commented on
the emphasis on technique at Stan
ford, rather than on strategy in the
play. They also agreed that more in
dividual help is needed and that gre
ater depth in competition and
coaching is necessary for the ad
vanced levels. "Coach Helliwell has
to spread herself thin," said Krinsky.
"She is a foil fencer, and can't help
as much with epee or sabre."
With very few U.S. high schools
offering fencing, most fencers at
Stanford must start at the ground
level. Nearly a year of classes is
necessary before the stance and the
movement become more natural.
Many of the top Stanford fencers are
juniors and seniors, having gained
all their experience here.
The team response to Helliwell is
largely warm and appreciative. "Per
sonable" is the word most often
applied by team members, and as
women's foil captain Eva Lohrer
commented, Helliwell has "a good
philosophy, that they (the fencers)
can have the sport be whatever they
want it to be. She can work with the

ideas people have about fencing,
even when those ideas are different
from her own."
Successful season
Stanford has fenced in 14 meets
since October, eight of those being
Northern California Athletic Con
ference meets. All four teams have
earned their way to San loseStatefor
the NCAC Championship tomorrow
and Sunday. Individuals also com
