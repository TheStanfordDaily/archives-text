Oil price increase expected
Tehran, Iran — Prime Minister Jamshid
Amouzegar predicted yesterday that world oil
prices would remain frozen through the end of
1"*78, but that gradual, annual increases should
be expected beginning next year.
Phased increases during the coming decade
will help impress on the mind of consumers
thit oil is a "precious and noble resource that
inust be conserved," Amouzegar told the As
sociated Press in an interview.
Amouzegar said congressional opponents
of President Jimmy Carter's energy conserva
tion program did not sufficiently appreciate
the precariousness of oil reserves and the de
vastating effect the drying up of Middle East oil
fields would have on Western Europe and Ja
pan.
State Dept. criticizes Israel
Washington — Israel, already sensitive about
American opposition to its settlements in oc
cupied Arab lands, was buffeted again yester
day when the State Department criticized it for
violating the rights of Arabs.
The criticism was part of the department's
annual report on human rights in the 105 na
tions that receive American arms or economic
assistance. The report accused some of the
United States' staunchest allies of violations,
including corruption and torture.
The report said the Israelis maintain a
Western-style democracy in their own coun
try, with full human rights assured. But in the
territories occupied by Israel, the report found
evidence that military authorities do not ex
tend the same rights to the Palestinians.
The harshest criticism in the report was re
served for the Philippines, Taiwan, Korea, and
Indonesia, countries where anti-communist
U.S. allies rule by martial law.
Senate debates Canal treaty
Washington — The Panama Canal debate es
calated yesterday as both Democratic and Re
publican leaders conceded they aren't likely to
make any points with the voters back home, no
matter which way they vote.
Relinquishing the Panama Canal "is a killer
issue politically," said Senate Minority Leader
Howard Baker of Tennessee. From a political
standpoint, Baker said, a senator can stay even
or lose, "but you can't profit from it."
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd and
Baker, beginning the second day of an emo
tional, freewheeling debate on the issue,
acknowledged that the specter of relinquish
ing U.S. control over the international water
way is not a popular one with most Americans.
The Panama arguments, carried live by Na
tional Public Radio in an unprecedented
broadcast of a congressional debate, are ex

pected to last several weeks. Hanging in the
balance are the two treaties, which took 14
years to negotiate. One pact would relinquish
the canal to the Panamanians by the 2000
and the other would provide for the continued
neutrality of the Canal Zone after that date.
Intelligence guidelines drafted
Washington — A Senate committee issued a
blueprint for U.S. intelligence gathering yes
terday which would legally bar the use of as
sassination and terrorism and prohibit CIA ef
forts to overthrow "democratic" govern
ments.
The draft proposal, certain to be subjected
to months of hearings and debate, was issued
by the Senate Intelligence Committee in an
attempt to place the FBI and CIA under new
charters with specific guidelines, restraints
and criminal and civil penalties for violations.
Sen. Birch Bayh (D-lnd.), chairman of the
committee, said that introduction of the char
ter legislation means that Congress "wants to
give our intelligence agencies a clear mandate
to carry on their essential work under the rules
of law.
Webster, Carlucci confirmed
Washington — U.S. Appeals Judge William
Webster won Senate confirmation yesterday
to a 10-year term as director of the FBI.
Webster, confirmed by voice vote, will suc
ceed Clarence Kelley, who is retiring.
Webster, 53, has been a judge of theBth U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis.
The Senate also gave voice vote approval to
the nomination of Frank Carlucci to be deputy
director of the CIA. Carlucci, U.S. ambassador
to Portugal until his nomination, will succeed
E. Henry Knoche in the intelligence post.
Miners reject contract
A contract that would settle the 66-day-old
strike by 160,000 United Mine Workers suf
fered a vote of no confidence yesterday when
it was rejected by the presidents of all 52 locals
in an Appalachian district that has 10 per cent
of the union's members.
The vote came as the union's bargaining
council in Washington tentatively scheduled a
meeting today to consider whether to send the
pact reached by negotiators to the rank and file
for a vote.
Meanwhile, coal stockpiles around the
country continued to dwindle. Indiana and
West Virginia already were under "energy
emergencies."
Carter can impose an 80-day, back-to-work
order under the Taft-Hartley Act if he finds the
strike is creating a national emergency, but he
said recently he has no plans to use that power.

Heavy rains soak California
Floods, an avalanche and slides closed
highways in Northern and Central California
yesterday.
Heavy rain caused streams to overflow or
approach flood stage in the San Joaquin Valley
and adjoining Sierra Nevada, but the storm
eased at points to the north.
The second mudslide in four days closed
southbound lanes of Interstate 5 leading from
the San Joaquin Valley over the Tehachapi
Range into Los Angeles.
Other 24-hour rainfall totals included 1.23
inches at San Francisco International Airport
and one inch at Oakland International before
the storm moved south during the morning.

hopes to reinstate it in the conference commit
tee.
