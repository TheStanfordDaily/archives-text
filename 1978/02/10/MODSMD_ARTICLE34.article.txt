## 
### 
A letter on rapes on campus which
appeared in the Feb. 8 Daily, was
substantially inaccurate, according
to Leah Kaplan, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs and a co-signer of the
letter.
Captain Raoul Niemeyer of the
Department of Public Safety said the
only sex crimes which have been re
ported to the police in the recent
past have been indecent exposures.
When contacted by the Daily, Kap
lan explained that there had been a
problem in communication between
her office and the police. Kaplan said
the three attempted rapes men
tioned in the letter had occurred
over the last "couple of years," not
the last two weeks, as stated in the
letter.
According to Marvin Herrington,
director of the Department of Public
Safety, "people misconceive reports
of flashers as attempted rapes. They
are sex crimes but are legally inde
cent exposures, not attempted
rapes."
