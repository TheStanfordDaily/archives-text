# Various issues forseen
## New CIR members surveyed on views 
### Emily Sachar News analysis 
Recently appointed members of the Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR) represent
a variety of backgrounds and interests.
Of the 12 members, three will be professors,
joined by two staff members, one administrator,
three students and three alumni. Two ex-officio
participants will also serve without voting
privileges.
Frederick Hillier, professor of operations re
search, will chair the commission. Hillier, 42, re
ceived bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees
at Stanford. He has also served on a variety of
church councils in the Bay Area.
"I believe I have developed a strong social con
sciousness from serving in these capacities and
dealing with such sensitive issues as the farmwor
kers' movement, and minority issues of oppressed
classes," Hillier said.
Deeply concerned
Hillier said his view is only one among 12 on the
CIR, but he said he thought the commission
should first be deeply concerned with the moral
values in the South African system, "which causea
tremendous injustice to blacks through oppres
sion," he added.
"We need to give great emphasis to social injury
in developing a socially responsible policy. Vet we
shouldn't let our hearts control our minds in
quickly drawing superficial conclusions that really
need finer analysis," Hillier said.
The commission will be facing two types of
questions, according to Hillier. One involves the
specific proxy issues facing the Board of Trustees

between now and May. The other aspect of com
mission responsibility involves developing policy
recommendations regarding South Africa. Then
when proxy issues arise the commission can act
according to its adopted policies.
Policy questions
Hillier said policy questions to consider in
clude: when proxy issues call for withdrawal, how
should we vote? And when considering responses
of companies, under what conditions should di
vestment be considered?
"We'll look at the more basic questions such as
the real effect of divestment, the likely effect of
withdrawal in terms of economic, social and moral
concerns, and the proper role of a multi-national
company in considering these issues to influence
their business practices," Hillier added.
Oneof thestudent CIR members, Lee Goldman,
a graduate law student, said he researched issues
relating to corporate responsibility last summer.
"I am serving to see those ideas in practice, not
just in theory," Goldman said.
Goldman said he sees the student role on the
commission as a vital one.
Actual voice
"I don't know what actual voice will be given to
students. If there's no voice, there's really no
point in having students on the committee, except
perhaps to put the president in a better light after
the selection process," Goldman said.
Another student member, Ronald Johnson,
graduate student in economics, said, "there must
be some clarification of the role of the ASSU Con
stitution in the University community. Is the con
stitution even valid or how must it be clarified? The
ball on the issue is back in the trustees' camp."

He added, "Other reasons for joining the com
mission are that despite the negative aspects of the
student selection process, the CIR faces issues
which are really up front at the University. Also,
because the COP (ASSU Council of Presidents)
were not against the actual formation of the CIR
itself, I feel more interest than I might have other
wise.
"I hope the commission can accomplish some
divestiture of firms that are continually pumping
money into South Africa such as Ford," Johnson
said.
The student members have decided to meet to
seek consensus before each CIR meeting, accord
ing to Goldman.
Stronger voice
"This will give us a stronger voice at the meet
ings," Goldman said. "But most importantly we
are individuals and will express divergent views if
they exist. At least we'll know how the other (stu
dents) feel before attending the CIR meetings."
Three alumni members will also serve on the
CIR. Alumnus Ryland Kelley expressed interest in
participation after reading the full Massy Report,
he said.
"As an alum, I'm interested in serving the Uni
versity, as well as in the ethical problems involved
in this specific issue," Kelley added.
CIR will hold a closed meeting next week to
decide how best to receive input from the Stan
ford community, Hillier said. The commission will
also begin considering some specific questions
relating to investment policy. And the CIR will
select rules of procedure, including whether
meetings will be open or closed to the University
community, Hillier added.

Hillier said policy questions to consider in
clude: when proxy issues call for withdrawal, how
should we vote? And when considering responses
of companies, under what conditions should di
vestment be considered?
"We'll look at the more basic questions such as
the real effect of divestment, the likely effect of
withdrawal in terms of economic, social and moral
concerns, and the proper role of a multi-national
company in considering these issues to influence
their business practices," Hillier added.
Oneof thestudent CIR members, Lee Goldman,
a graduate law student, said he researched issues
relating to corporate responsibility last summer.
"I am serving to see those ideas in practice, not
just in theory," Goldman said.
Goldman said he sees the student role on the
commission as a vital one.
Actual voice
"I don't know what actual voice will be given to
students. If there's no voice, there's really no
point in having students on the committee, except
perhaps to put the president in a better light after
the selection process," Goldman said.
Another student member, Ronald Johnson,
graduate student in economics, said, "there must
be some clarification of the role of the ASSU Con
stitution in the University community. Is the con
stitution even valid or how must it be clarified? The
ball on the issue is back in the trustees' camp."

He added, "Other reasons for joining the com
mission are that despite the negative aspects of the
student selection process, the CIR faces issues
which are really up front at the University. Also,
because the COP (ASSU Council of Presidents)
were not against the actual formation of the CIR
itself, I feel more interest than I might have other
wise.
"I hope the commission can accomplish some
divestiture of firms that are continually pumping
money into South Africa such as Ford," Johnson
said.
The student members have decided to meet to
seek consensus before each CIR meeting, accord
ing to Goldman.
Stronger voice
"This will give us a stronger voice at the meet
ings," Goldman said. "But most importantly we
are individuals and will express divergent views if
they exist. At least we'll know how the other (stu
dents) feel before attending the CIR meetings."
Three alumni members will also serve on the
CIR. Alumnus Ryland Kelley expressed interest in
participation after reading the full Massy Report,
he said.
"As an alum, I'm interested in serving the Uni
versity, as well as in the ethical problems involved
in this specific issue," Kelley added.
CIR will hold a closed meeting next week to
decide how best to receive input from the Stan
ford community, Hillier said. The commission will
also begin considering some specific questions
relating to investment policy. And the CIR will
select rules of procedure, including whether
meetings will be open or closed to the University
community, Hillier added.
Recently appointed members of the Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR) represent
a variety of backgrounds and interests.
Of the 12 members, three will be professors,
joined by two staff members, one administrator,
three students and three alumni. Two ex-officio
participants will also serve without voting
privileges.
Frederick Hillier, professor of operations re
search, will chair the commission. Hillier, 42, re
ceived bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees
at Stanford. He has also served on a variety of
church councils in the Bay Area.
"I believe I have developed a strong social con
sciousness from serving in these capacities and
dealing with such sensitive issues as the farmwor
kers' movement, and minority issues of oppressed
classes," Hillier said.
Deeply concerned
Hillier said his view is only one among 12 on the
CIR, but he said he thought the commission
should first be deeply concerned with the moral
values in the South African system, "which causea
tremendous injustice to blacks through oppres
sion," he added.
"We need to give great emphasis to social injury
in developing a socially responsible policy. Vet we
shouldn't let our hearts control our minds in
quickly drawing superficial conclusions that really
need finer analysis," Hillier said.
The commission will be facing two types of
questions, according to Hillier. One involves the
specific proxy issues facing the Board of Trustees

between now and May. The other aspect of com
mission responsibility involves developing policy
recommendations regarding South Africa. Then
when proxy issues arise the commission can act
according to its adopted policies.
