# Native Americans hold rally to protest pending bills

"The purpose of this rally is to in
form people about anti-Indian
backlash legislation now in the Con
gress and Senate," said David Eisen
berg of the Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO) yesterday at a
rally in White Plaza.
Speakers at the noon rally spoke
out against 11 bills now in Congress
dealing with native American rights.
"Looking at the past 200 to 300
years," said Dennis Banks, a former
leader of the American Indian
Movement, "we have to view these
11 bills as the Indran Removal Act of
1830. (That act forced five tribes to
walk from their home territories in
Georgia to Oklahoma. The march
took four to five years and claimed
40,000 lives.) At that time people
were saying, 'they can't pass such an
act,' but they did."
The pending bills, which have
spurred concern in the native Ameri
can community here, prompted yes
terday's rally concerning tribal land
claims, legal jurisdiction on reserva
tions and native American hunting
and fishing rights.
"The 11 bills ignore three facts,"
said Francis Robert of the SAIO after
the rally.
"The tribes are sovereign nations;
the Indian people are tribal, not U.S.
citizens, and the courts have recog
nized the aboriginal rights of Indians
to water, hunting and fishing."
Five of the bills deal with hunting
and fishing rights. Another bill would
"direct the president to abrogate all
treaties entered into with Indians,"
according to Robert. Rep. Paul
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park), has said
this bill has no chance of getting out
of committee, Robert added.
Three other bills "would abolish

the rights of tribes in Maine and New
York to make land claims/' he ad
ded.
The Criminal Code Reform Act of
1977 sponsored by Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.), would give the fed
eral government all jurisdiction on
native American land. Robert said
this would mean that there wouldn't
be any more native American land.
Another section of Kennedy's bill
would expand the scope of the state
jurisdiction over such land. Robert
said this contradicts the Civil Rights
Act of 1968.
A third section of the bill changes
the present system in which federal
and state law applies on reservations
only when tribal jurisdiction cannot
be proven, Robert said. Under the
proposed change, federal law would
be applied first, then state law, and
there would be notribal jurisdiction.
A mass rally will be held in Sac
ramento this Saturday, said Bill
Wahpepah, head of the Oakland
Survival School, to begin what he cal
led the "longest walk." This walk, in
protest of the 11 bills, will cross the
entire country and take four to five
months, said Wahpepah. He said he
expects 25 people from the Bay Area
to make the walk.
"The reason this walk is so impor
tant," said Banks, a walk organizer,
"is that we know some of the 11 bills
won't make it, but the attitude of
some elected tribal officials is that
the bill won't pass anyway so don't
worry about it."
Statements of solidarity were given
at the rally by Suzy Acevedo of
MEChA, Keith Archuleta of the BSU
and Francis Wong of the Asian Stu
dents Association. English Prof. N.
Scott Momaday sent a statement ex
pressing concern over the pending

legislation and saying that anyone
who educates himself thoroughly
will reject the bills.
Miriam Cherry, Stanford survival
minister, called the bills "11 death
blankets." She described a conversa
tion with a 76-year-old cousin living
on the Wind River reservation in
Wyoming in which her cousin asked,
"What have I done to these people
who are taking the land away?"
"They want our land," said Lee
Brightman, professor at Contra
Costa College, of the sponsors of the
11 bills. He said 85 per cent of the
United States uranium deposits are
on native American land. The largest
coal reserves in this country are
spread over North and South
Dakota, Wyoming, Montana and
Colorado and are largely on native
American land, Brightman said.
"Of all the minorities, the Indians
are the most vulnerable; we have no
power except our lard," said
Brightman.
With only 750,000 native Ameri
cans, Brightman said, it is extremely
important to gain the support of
non-Indian people to defeat the
pending legislation.
