The ASSU recycling center is "now
coming into full operation," accord
ing to recycling project leader Barry
Abramson.
The recycling center, off Pampas
Lane, will now be open from 2 to 6
p.m. on Tuesdays, in addition to the
usual 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday
hours. Abrahamson said he hopes
these hours will make recycling more
convenient for off-campus students,
faculty and staff.
Abramson said recycling bins have
been distributed to most student re
sidences on campus. About a dozen
bins have been placed in libraries
and other areas here, he added.
About $12,000 of the fee assess
ment money has been used to pay for
fencing and paving the site, building
_.ieds, buying a truck and student
labor, he said.
Abramson said student response
has "been tremendous." In addition
to eight paid student workers, 65
representatives have volunteered to
promote recycling and to help ar
range the regular pick-up of full bins
in their residences, he added.
Since its Jan. 14 opening, the
center has recycled 14 tons of news
print, eight tons of glass and 500
pounds of aluminum. Present rates
are $20 per ton of paper, $16 per ton
of glass and 17 cents per pound of
aluminum. This makes aluminum
almost 20 times more valuable than
eitherglassor newspaper, Abramson
said.
The newsprint sold by the center is
used to make cardboard, the glass is
made into recycled wine bottles and
the aluminum is melted down for
reuse, he added.
Abramson said the recycling
center is not yet operating at an
"even break," but increased recycl
ing by students will help.
