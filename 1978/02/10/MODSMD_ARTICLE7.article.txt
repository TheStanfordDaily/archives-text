# Canal rights debated
## Domino effect beginning 
### 
Ronald Hilton

The question of U.S. intervention
in defense of the Panama Canal
under the proposed treaties has not
been squarely faced for fear of en
dangering the treaties' passagp. The
U.S. Administration at first told the
American public that the United
States had the right to intervene. Ar
ticle IV, paragraph 2, of the proposed
Panama Canal Treaty says, "For the
duration of this treaty (until 2000
A.D.) the United States shall have
primary responsibility to protect and
defend the Canal."
The treaty concerning the perma
nent neutrality and operation of the
Panama Canal, which goes into effect
when the first treaty lapses, says (Ar
ticle V), "only the Republic of
Panama shall operate the Canal and
maintain military forces." There is
nothing in the treaty authorizing U.S.
intervention. General OmarTorrijos
objected to President |immy Carter's
assertion that it did.
Issue fuzzy
Therefore, the two met on Oct. 14,
1977, and issued a joint unsigned
statement rejecting Carter's in
terpretation. It was published in the
Weekly Compilation of Presidential
Documents (Oct. 17,1977) but given
no publicity, and the fact that it was
unsigned has some curious implica
tions. The issue is still fuzzy in that
the failure of the United States to
give publicity to the rectification
leaves Panama with doubts about our
intentions, and the statement itself is
not entirely clear.
Parallel noted
There is a strange parallel, which
has not been mentioned in all the
writings about the treaties, with the
issue of the U.S. right to intervene in
Cuba. In 1901, Sen. Orville Piatt in
troduced the famous Piatt Amend
ment which was a necessary pre
requisite for Senate approval of the
granting of Cuban independence in
1902 and of the U.S.-Cuban treaty of
1903. The fears expressed in this
amendment were very similar to the
fears we have today concerning
Panama.
The Cuban Government accepted
the Piatt Amendment in order to get
the treaty passed, but the limitation
on Cuba's freedom of action was one
of the basic causes of the anti-
Americanism which finally brought
Fidel Castro to power. The United

States found itself involved in Cuban
politics.
In 1934, the United States gave up
the right of intervention. However,
despite this abrogation, the United
States intervened with a vengeance,
surreptitiously and disastrously, at
the Bay of Pigs.
Intervention unclear
Is this a scenario for what might
happen in Panama? The U.S. Ad
ministration no longer talks about
the right to intervene (it has been
tacit on the subject), but what the
United States can do is still not clear.
Talk of defending even the ap
proaches to the Canal should take
into account the general claim in
Latin America to sovereignty over 200
miles of territorial waters. Carter
tried to reassure America by saying,
"I would take military action if there
were any attempt to attack the
Canal," but this did not settle the
legal question, as it might mean
another Bay of Pigs.
U.S. reports have been excessively
generous in praising the skill of the
two principal U.S. negotiators. It is
hard to understand how Ellsworth
Bunker achieved his reputation. He
played the key role in the disgraceful
hand-over of West I rian to Indonesia
in 1962 in order to appease a pro-
Communist dictator, whose be
havior was similar to that of Torrijos.
Sol Linowitz got into Latin American
affairs, in which he had no
background, as part of a Democratic
plan to improve relations with Latin
America.
Bunker, e sugar executive by train
ing, served as Ambassador to India,
where he was sent as a symbol of
American nonresistance to force.
Neither Bunker nor Linowitz has
shown much understanding of
geopolitics. This does not mean that
they are necessarily right or wrong
about the Canal issue, and they are
both dedicated, honorable men.
Problems won't end
Let it not be thought that ap
peasement in Panama will end our
troubles in the area; it will increase
them. It is clear that the Moscow-
Havana axis has its dominoes lined
up. After Panama will come, possi
bly, some other Central American
country. It could be Nicaragua,
where the United States has been
supporting Anastasio Somoza De-

bayle, a dictator comparable to
Fulgencio Batista of Cuba.
It could be Belize or Jamaica or any
of the other black Caribbean nations
where Moscow has been promoting
racial hatred to alienate the people
from the United States. It will be
Guantanamo, an enclave like the
Panama Canal Zone, which Castro
has long denounced, as he has the
Zone, but about which he has been
biding his time.
It will be Puerto Rico, where
Soviet-Cuban support of anti-
American violence belies talk of de
tente and peaceful coexistence. It
will be South America, where Mos
cow has only postponed its plans to
establish a focus of anti-American ac
tivity wherever and whenever the
opportunity presents itself. This
does not mean that Moscow's plans
will prosper, but it does mean that
the United States should be pre
pared.
Anything can happen in this un
predictable world, but we should not
forget that in his "History Will Ab
solve Me," Castro promised to estab
lish a Western-style democracy in
Cuba. Are our memories so short?
