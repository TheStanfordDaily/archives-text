# 'Daily' case critical for press
## 
### 
In the nearly seven years since police in Palo Alto,
Cal., ransacked the office of the Stanford Daily, two
federal courts have held that the police had no right to
raid the university paper — and a series of increasingly
threadbare arguments have been advanced to defend
the raid.
Now the case is before the United States Supreme
Court, and the lustice Department has decided to get
into the act. It has filed a "friend of the court" brief in
defense of the Palo Alto police — and in defiance of the
most elemental rules of a free press.
The case arose out of a riot at the Stanford University
Hospital in April, 1971. Nine policemen were injured.
The Daily ran some photographs of the rioting. The
police obtained a search warrant, showed up without
notice, and rummaged through the paper's files in
search of additional photographs or other material that
might help them identify the leading rioters. They found
nothing.
The Daily charged that the raid was an unconstitu
tional violation of the First Amendment because it was
given no opportunity to challenge the propriety of the
search warrant. A federal District and an Appellate Cou rt
agreed. They held that the police must give a news
organization notice, by means of a subpoena, and a
chance to challenge the request, before compelling the
disclosure of confidential information. The courts also
awarded the Daily $47,000 in attorney's fees. Palo Alto
appealed to the Supreme Court.
Now comes the Justice Department with a warmed
over defense of the police raid. It argues that to require a
subpoena in such cases "would create an unjustifiable
risk that valuable evidence would be lost." What it is
asking the Supreme Court to do, therefore, is to give

police everywhere the power to make surprise raids on
newspaper offices with nothing more than a search war
rant issued by a local judge, even when there is no
suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of the paper and
even, quite conceivably, when the police themselves —
or the local judge — are the targets of an investigation by
the newspaper.
The risk that bothers the Justice Department is trivial
compared with the risk that would arise if police and
local courts were given this power. Sources of the confi
dential information that is so essential to a free press
might no longer dare come forward. Newspapers would
be afraid to keep the files that are equally essential to
their function. Some newspapers, alternatively, might
stop even trying to serve as a check upon government
and become nothing but bulletin boards.
In short, it is hard to imagine a surer way of destroying
the ability of the press to serve the public. And what is
especially alarming is that since 1971, there have been at
least six other searches directed against newspapers or
broadcast stations.
We are not suggesting that the rights of the free press
invariably have priority over every other consideration.
What we are saying is that the freedom and indepen
dence of the press is the most effective possible guaran
tee of honest and good government and is essential to
the protection of democracy and human rights. It must
be assured of protection under the First Amendment
except under the rarest and most extreme of cir
cumstances. The suggestion that a handful of local offi
cials have a right to raid a newspaper office without even
giving the paper a chance to protest is incredible.

Cal., ransacked the office of the Stanford Daily, two
federal courts have held that the police had no right to
raid the university paper — and a series of increasingly
threadbare arguments have been advanced to defend
the raid.
Now the case is before the United States Supreme
Court, and the lustice Department has decided to get
into the act. It has filed a "friend of the court" brief in
defense of the Palo Alto police — and in defiance of the
most elemental rules of a free press.
The case arose out of a riot at the Stanford University
Hospital in April, 1971. Nine policemen were injured.
The Daily ran some photographs of the rioting. The
police obtained a search warrant, showed up without
notice, and rummaged through the paper's files in
search of additional photographs or other material that
might help them identify the leading rioters. They found
nothing.
The Daily charged that the raid was an unconstitu
tional violation of the First Amendment because it was
given no opportunity to challenge the propriety of the
search warrant. A federal District and an Appellate Cou rt
agreed. They held that the police must give a news
organization notice, by means of a subpoena, and a
chance to challenge the request, before compelling the
disclosure of confidential information. The courts also
awarded the Daily $47,000 in attorney's fees. Palo Alto
appealed to the Supreme Court.
Now comes the Justice Department with a warmed
over defense of the police raid. It argues that to require a
subpoena in such cases "would create an unjustifiable
risk that valuable evidence would be lost." What it is
asking the Supreme Court to do, therefore, is to give

police everywhere the power to make surprise raids on
newspaper offices with nothing more than a search war
rant issued by a local judge, even when there is no
suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of the paper and
even, quite conceivably, when the police themselves —
or the local judge — are the targets of an investigation by
the newspaper.
The risk that bothers the Justice Department is trivial
compared with the risk that would arise if police and
local courts were given this power. Sources of the confi
dential information that is so essential to a free press
might no longer dare come forward. Newspapers would
be afraid to keep the files that are equally essential to
their function. Some newspapers, alternatively, might
stop even trying to serve as a check upon government
and become nothing but bulletin boards.
In short, it is hard to imagine a surer way of destroying
the ability of the press to serve the public. And what is
especially alarming is that since 1971, there have been at
least six other searches directed against newspapers or
broadcast stations.
We are not suggesting that the rights of the free press
invariably have priority over every other consideration.
What we are saying is that the freedom and indepen
dence of the press is the most effective possible guaran
tee of honest and good government and is essential to
the protection of democracy and human rights. It must
be assured of protection under the First Amendment
except under the rarest and most extreme of cir
cumstances. The suggestion that a handful of local offi
cials have a right to raid a newspaper office without even
giving the paper a chance to protest is incredible.
