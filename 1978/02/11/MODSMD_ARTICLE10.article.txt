# Belton not accustomed to losing record

Kim Belton personifies con
trol.
The 6-foot-7 Cardinal for
ward has a handsome set of
credentials which follow him
everywhere. They range from
scholar-athlete of New York in
1976 to Stanford's leading
scorer and rebounder this sea
son. And they all add up to one
assumption: Belton is good at
what he does.
He's got it under control.
But the team as a whole
seems to be having a little diffi
culty putting it all together
consistently in conference
play. And Belton's not particu
larly pleased about the way it's
gone so far.

"lt could be a lot better," he
said. "We could be winning."
A losing season (so far) is
hardly the norm for most of the
team.
"When we came out of high
school we were all used to
winning," Belton said. "This
sort of brings you back down.
It makes you realize what
you've been doing to other
people."
The other people Belton
played against in high school
had to face a New York prep
school team with the big 219-
pounder leading them to vic
tory.
That taste of victory is hard to
do without.
"It's hard to take a loss," Bel
ton said. "It's like thinking you
did really well on a test, then
finding out you failed. You

tend to remember your los
ses."

Belton feels the school at
titude doesn't help much
either. "Nobody wants to
lose," emphasized the proba
ble communications major.
What would help?
Support lacking
"If the fans would perk up a
little better, that would help
the most. But I guess that all
comes from winning. Some
teams come out on the floor
and the fans stand up and they
never sit down."
Belton feels strongly that
school support boosts a team's
desire to win.
"Some fans literally fight for
their team," Belton said. "I'm
not saying they should get that

fanatical, but a team feels a lot
better when you have
thousands of people behind
you. That's what gets a team
psyched-up."
Although a lot of emotion
stirred beneath those words,
Belton remained soft-spoken.
Definitely in control.
The forward, who is in

terested in commercial adver
tising, is in no way disap
pointed with his choice of
Stanford.

"My mother wasn't gong to
school with me, so it was all my
decision," commented Belton
about parental pressure. And
like most of the Cardinal
athletes, he was looking for
academic as well as athletic
prestige. He's satisfied with the
coach.
Positive attitude
"(Dick) Dißiaso tries to give
us a positive attitude. We all
depend on each other. That's
why it's a team."
But Belton's modesty pre
vented him from praising him
self in any way.
"I know there are things that
I don't do, but should do, and
things I do, but could do bet
ter. I don't think I have a
greatest asset. I'm just trying to
improve all the time."
Belton has refused to let dis
couragement creep into his at
titude.
"I'm just taking each game at
a time. There's no chance we
can win the league, but we
have five or six more games..
We could have a winning re
cord."
And with Belton in control,
they just might.

assumption: Belton is good at
what he does.
He's got it under control.
But the team as a whole
seems to be having a little diffi
culty putting it all together
consistently in conference
play. And Belton's not particu
larly pleased about the way it's
gone so far.

"lt could be a lot better," he
said. "We could be winning."
A losing season (so far) is
hardly the norm for most of the
team.
"When we came out of high
school we were all used to
winning," Belton said. "This
sort of brings you back down.
It makes you realize what
you've been doing to other
people."
The other people Belton
played against in high school
had to face a New York prep
school team with the big 219-
pounder leading them to vic
tory.
That taste of victory is hard to
do without.
"It's hard to take a loss," Bel
ton said. "It's like thinking you
did really well on a test, then
finding out you failed. You

tend to remember your los
ses."

Belton feels the school at
titude doesn't help much
either. "Nobody wants to
lose," emphasized the proba
ble communications major.
What would help?
Support lacking
"If the fans would perk up a
little better, that would help
the most. But I guess that all
comes from winning. Some
teams come out on the floor
and the fans stand up and they
never sit down."
Belton feels strongly that
school support boosts a team's
desire to win.
"Some fans literally fight for
their team," Belton said. "I'm
not saying they should get that

fanatical, but a team feels a lot
better when you have
thousands of people behind
you. That's what gets a team
psyched-up."
Although a lot of emotion
stirred beneath those words,
Belton remained soft-spoken.
Definitely in control.
The forward, who is in

terested in commercial adver
tising, is in no way disap
pointed with his choice of
Stanford.

"My mother wasn't gong to
school with me, so it was all my
decision," commented Belton
about parental pressure. And
like most of the Cardinal
athletes, he was looking for
academic as well as athletic
prestige. He's satisfied with the
coach.
Positive attitude
"(Dick) Dißiaso tries to give
us a positive attitude. We all
depend on each other. That's
why it's a team."
But Belton's modesty pre
vented him from praising him
self in any way.
"I know there are things that
I don't do, but should do, and
things I do, but could do bet
ter. I don't think I have a
greatest asset. I'm just trying to
improve all the time."
Belton has refused to let dis
couragement creep into his at
titude.
"I'm just taking each game at
a time. There's no chance we
can win the league, but we
have five or six more games..
We could have a winning re
cord."
And with Belton in control,
they just might.
