# Nelson floor general for women cagers

### Sukie Jackson 
Maggie Nelson, senior
standout of the Stanford wo
men's basketball team, is not
your typical woman athlete.
Lor her, sports is not a second
priority. As Nelson said her
self, "It is a feminist thing to be
athletic," and she plans to
make sports as much a part of
her future as they have been a
part of her past.
Although her 6-foot-1 frame
makes her a natural for basket
ball, Nelson said she competed
in four or five sports "real seri
ously" in high school. Basket

ball got singled out only be
cause a shoulder injury pre
vented her from spiking the
volleyball or swinging a lac
rosse stick.
"Specializing isn't so bad
though," she added, "I
wouldn't have had the energy
for two sports."
Basketball turned out to be a
good choice for Nelson. She
began by playing on an AAU
women's team in Phoenix,
Ariz. Stanford coach Dottie
McCrea said of the four-year
Card starter, "Maggie is a
much improved player over

last year. Almost every other
coach has told me that. She's
worked very hard to become
what she is now."
Leading scorer
What Nelson is now is Stan
ford's leading scorer with an
average of 18 points and eight
rebounds a game. In her best
effort to date, Nelson scored 30
points in the Card victory over
the University of Pacific.
"She's a great shooter," said
McCrea, referring to Nelson's
70 per cent free throw average
and 55 per cent shooting from
the floor.

Playing basketball at Stan
ford has not always been ideal
for Nelson, who had to deal
with the frustrations and grow
ing pains of a young women's
basketball program. "My first
years here were wasted in
terms of learning," Nelson
said.
Since then the athletic de
partment recruited McCrea.
"Now I feel like I finally know
something about basketball,"
said Nelson. "I have something
to go on rather than athletic
ability like the first years. I love
the sport so much that I would
put up with anything to play,"
she added.
And Nelson's basketball
career may not end with her
last season at Stanford. In
March, Nelson will be scouted
by a French team that has ex
pressed interest in her talent.
She hopes to play several years
in a European basketball
league.
Revolutionary
Maggie's interest in sports
goes beyond competitive bas
ketball, though. Eventually,
she would like to combine her
psychology degree, and in

terest in women's studies and
athletics by teaching women's
sports, or counseling. Nelson
considers basketball and other
sports "revolutionary for wo
men" and she hopes to help
others learn the "strength,
self-confidence and self-trust"
that she experienced.
Speaking about her own ex
perience, Nelson continued,
"Basketball made me feel good
about my height. I didn't go
through the typical female
syndrome of worrying about
being taller than boys."
Nelson has never worried
about not fitting into what she
calls "traditional women's
roles. Men in the stands some
times harrass me for not shav
ing under my arms, instead of
appreciating me for my talent,"
she said.
Maggie Nelson does indeed
have a lot of talent to ap
preciate. If one were to watch
Nelson at a game it would be
her excellent jump shot, her
agility, and her quiet leader
ship of the Cards basketball
team that one would notice be
fore discovering that Nelson
doesn't shave under her arms.

the University of Pacific.
"She's a great shooter," said
McCrea, referring to Nelson's
70 per cent free throw average
and 55 per cent shooting from
the floor.

Playing basketball at Stan
ford has not always been ideal
for Nelson, who had to deal
with the frustrations and grow
ing pains of a young women's
basketball program. "My first
years here were wasted in
terms of learning," Nelson
said.
Since then the athletic de
partment recruited McCrea.
"Now I feel like I finally know
something about basketball,"
said Nelson. "I have something
to go on rather than athletic
ability like the first years. I love
the sport so much that I would
put up with anything to play,"
she added.
And Nelson's basketball
career may not end with her
last season at Stanford. In
March, Nelson will be scouted
by a French team that has ex
pressed interest in her talent.
She hopes to play several years
in a European basketball
league.
Revolutionary
Maggie's interest in sports
goes beyond competitive bas
ketball, though. Eventually,
she would like to combine her
psychology degree, and in

terest in women's studies and
athletics by teaching women's
sports, or counseling. Nelson
considers basketball and other
sports "revolutionary for wo
men" and she hopes to help
others learn the "strength,
self-confidence and self-trust"
that she experienced.
Speaking about her own ex
perience, Nelson continued,
"Basketball made me feel good
about my height. I didn't go
through the typical female
syndrome of worrying about
being taller than boys."
Nelson has never worried
about not fitting into what she
calls "traditional women's
roles. Men in the stands some
times harrass me for not shav
ing under my arms, instead of
appreciating me for my talent,"
she said.
Maggie Nelson does indeed
have a lot of talent to ap
preciate. If one were to watch
Nelson at a game it would be
her excellent jump shot, her
agility, and her quiet leader
ship of the Cards basketball
team that one would notice be
fore discovering that Nelson
doesn't shave under her arms.

Maggie Nelson, senior
standout of the Stanford wo
men's basketball team, is not
your typical woman athlete.
Lor her, sports is not a second
priority. As Nelson said her
self, "It is a feminist thing to be
athletic," and she plans to
make sports as much a part of
her future as they have been a
part of her past.
Although her 6-foot-1 frame
makes her a natural for basket
ball, Nelson said she competed
in four or five sports "real seri
ously" in high school. Basket

ball got singled out only be
cause a shoulder injury pre
vented her from spiking the
volleyball or swinging a lac
rosse stick.
"Specializing isn't so bad
though," she added, "I
wouldn't have had the energy
for two sports."
Basketball turned out to be a
good choice for Nelson. She
began by playing on an AAU
women's team in Phoenix,
Ariz. Stanford coach Dottie
McCrea said of the four-year
Card starter, "Maggie is a
much improved player over

last year. Almost every other
coach has told me that. She's
worked very hard to become
what she is now."
Leading scorer
What Nelson is now is Stan
ford's leading scorer with an
average of 18 points and eight
rebounds a game. In her best
effort to date, Nelson scored 30
points in the Card victory over
the University of Pacific.
