# 'You can't let up
## Former Card Bratz shines as Sun 
### Richard Keller 
One reason Stanford is rent
ing space in the Pacific-8 con
ference cellar is that Mike
Bratz, along with his floor
leadership and his 19.6 points
per game, is in Arizona.
Bratz, the Cardinals'
playmaker during the last three
seasons, is now the Phoenix
Suns' fourth guard. He isn't
getting as much playing time as
he did in Maples Pavilion, but
his salary more than makes up
for the bench sores. His con
tract is for "more than three
years," he said.
Originally from Lompoc,
Bratz started making waves by
leading Allan Hancock College
to the California state junior
college crown in 1974. The fol
lowing three seasons, he wore
number 23 in cardinal red and
white. His senior performance
obviously caused pro scouts to
take notice, as he led Stanford
in scoring (19.6), free-throw
percentage (.814), steals (59)
and assists (113). As a final
laurel, Bratz was selected on
the 1977 Pac-8 first team.
Third round
Bratz was taken in the third
round of the draft, but had no
prior contact with Phoenix. In
fact, Atlanta was the only team
which expressed interest in
advance of the draft. Partially
because Atlanta coach Hubie
Brown is a good friend of Stan
ford coach Dick Dißiaso, Bratz
was seriously considered by
the Hawks. They were pre

pared to draft him, but Phoenix
just beat them to it.
On the morning of the draft,
officials in the Suns' organiza
tion called Dißiaso and asked
him how he felt about Bratz.
He must have done a good sel
ling job. ,

Twenty-five candidates were
invited to the Phoenix rookie
camp last July 5. Nine of those
made the Suns' entry in the Los
Angeles NBA summer league,
and four were granted tryouts
with the veterans in Sep
tember. Bratz cleared all the
hurdles, but said itwasn'teasy.
"I was caught a little bit by
surprise," Bratz said. "I hadn't
really kept in practice. I was
lucky that I was working in
coach Dißiaso's summer camp
when I got the letter telling me
to report.

"There was a lot of pres
sure," continued Bratz.
"Everyone was out to impress.
I knew if I played to my abilities
I would make it. But I knew I
was a long way from a job."
Former Oregon star Ron Lee
was the first person to greet
Bratz at fall camp. The two
played against each other in
school, and still do in practice.
Said Bratz, "We go at it pretty
good. He plays hard all the
time. But we developed a
friendship, and still go out so
cially," he added.
More minutes
The pecking order at guard
starts with Paul Westphal and
Don Buse. Lee is first off the

bench, and Bratz follows. At
the season's outset, Bratz was
used sparingly. Recently, how
ever, Phoenix coach John Mac-
Leon has gained confidence in
him. Bratz now sees action in
the first and second quarters,
and is averaging 15 minutes a
game. He has a 4.7 scoring av
erage that includes a high of 15
against Seattle. His .830 free
throw percentage ranks sec
ond on the Suns.

Phoenix public relations di
rector Tom Ambrose said,
"nobody expected him (Bratz)
to do anything. At the begin
ning of the season he was get
ting in games that were 20
points either way. But Mike's a
very coachable kid. He's very
intelligent and works very
hard.

"Mike has done well to earn
15 minutes a game. If you look
at who he's competing against
you'll understand why. Buse
was an all-star last year and led
the league in steals and assists.
Westphal was on the all-NBA
team and Lee was on the all
rookie team and is leading the
team in steals this year."
Added Ambrose, "Mike's
made a great contribution. And
we could use some more good
free-throw shooters."
Adapted to pros
"I think I have adapted to the
pro game," Bratz said, "and I
think I play a lot better game.
The pro game is a lot quicker
with the 24-second ciock.
There's more contact; people

are bigger and a lot more
talented. You can't let up at
all."
Despite being 6-2, Bratz does
well against the taller guards.
"I've been taking the big
guard, like Frazier and
Maravich," he said. "But they're
not that much taller. I just try
and use anything I can to stop
them. I've done pretty well."
Bratz said that he is less
nervous in the pros than in col
lege.
"I know my role, and I know
when I get to play," he said. "I
try to pick things up if they're
down and try to keep things
going when we're on top. I'd
be a total wreck if I worried
about being nervous."
' The advantages of being a
pro basketball player outweigh
the dragging effects of travel,
according to Bratz.
"We travel a couple weeks
out of the month," he re
marked, "and it's rough. A dif
ferent city and a game every
night."
Bratz said that he isn't used
to the schedule on the road,
but that it didn't really bother
him. His roommate, veteran
center Dennis Awtrey, serves
as Bratz's advisor, making sure
he gets enough sleep and that
"he doesn't eat crap all the
time."
New Orleans is Bratz's favo
rite city to visit. He and former
Stanford center Rich Kelley
(now with the Jazz) always get
together and "do a little bit on

the town," Bratz said.
Stanford basketball has had
only one winning season in the
last 10 years. Bratz elaborated
why.
"It's a lot of different vari
ables," he said. It's something
you build on. You have to have
a tradition. Teams with the
tradition and the big-name
players get the breaks with the
referees.
"And you have to have a
good coach. Coach Dißiaso is a
good coach. I can't say enough
good things about him. He's
really improved my game. He's
a good strategic coach he's
talked a lot to me about the
philosophy of the game. He
pushed me and I'm glad he
did."
Bratz said five of the current
Stanford hoopers could possi
bly go pro "if they get a break."
"Belton's got a lot of talent,"
commented Bratz, "but he's
got a long way to go. He could
be there Wolfe Perry the
same way. Schader, if his leg
keeps improving he could
be there too.* And Jeff
McHugh. People don't think of
him. He's got a lot of the qual
ities that would make a good
pro. And there's Jay Carter too.
"I was lucky to be in the right
spot at the right time,"
philosophized Bratz. "I might
have been on a less talented
team. A scout might have seen
me on a bad night or not
scouted me enough. You have
to have things fall your way."
