## Bruins adopt 'team' style 
### Ivan Maisel 
After last week's 101-64 loss
at UCLA, Stanford head coach
Dick Dißiaso said, "Now I
know how the Christians felt
coming into Rome." Tonight
the Cardinal Christians play
host to the UCLA Romans, with
hopes of a better fate than last
week's disaster at Pauley Pavil
ion.
It will be quite a task for the
Cardinals. UCLA head coach
Gary Cunningham brings with
him a very good basketball
team, with emphasis on the
word team. The highly-rated
Bruins (fourth in UPI, fifth in
AP), have displayed a combina
tion of sound fundamentals
and excellent teamwork. At no
time were these displayed bet
ter than at last week's game
against Stanford. The Bruins
shot 59.7 percent from the
field, and outrebounded Stan
ford 48-29. They also played
tenacious defense, limiting
Stanford to just seven field
goals in the first half, and 32.3
percent from the field for
game. Most importantly, no
man played more than 26 mi
nutes, indicating that the
Bruins have a strong bench
backing up the starting five.
Starting five

The probable starting five for
the Bruins tonight will be
led by 6-foot-2 1 /2 senior
guard Raymond Townsend.
Townsend, averaging 13.9
points this season, leads the
league in field goal percentage
with a 59.5 percent clip.
If he continues at this pace,
he will be the hottest shooting
guard in UCLA history.
At the other guard will be
playmaker Roy Hamilton.
Hamilton, a 6-2 junior, is scor
ing 15.9 per game and leads the
league in assists with 6.2 per
game. At center is Gig Sims, a
6-9 sophomore averaging 7.3
points and six rebounds a
game. Sims also leads the team
in blocked shots with 43.
At one forward is All Pac-8
junior David Greenwood. Green
wood, whom ex-Marquette
coach Al McGuire, has called a
"velvet player," leads the team in
scoring (17.2) and rebounding
(11.1). Currently, Greenwood
has scored at least 14 points in
each of his last 17 games.
Complementing Greenwood
at the other forward is 6-6V2
sophomore James Wilkes, av
eraging 8.4 points and 4.5 re
bounds per game.

Leading the Bruin bench is
sophomore forward Kiki Van
derweghe, sixth in the league
in field-goal percentage, and
junior guard Brad Holland, the
team's leading free throw
shooter.
Near perfect
Indeed, coach Cunningham
admits that his team played a
"near perfect" game against
Stanford, which is as strong a
statement as Cunningham has
made about UCLA. Cunnin
gham is only one of a handful
who have not conceded the
Bruins the Pac-8 title. He says
that "the second round (half of
the season) will be a real test of
how good our team is. We play
five of our next seven games on
the road."
Stanford is 7-3 at Maples
Pavilion, but the homecourt
advantage might not be
enough against UCLA. Execu
tion wins ball games, some
thing which Dißiaso said failed

to occur against UCLA.
The worst thing to happen,
said Dißiaso, was the turnov
ers. Stanford is leading the
Pac-8 in that category.
"I do not mind the turn
overs, where the ball hits your
foot and goes out-of-bounds,"
said Dißiaso. "We were mak
ing ones that UCLA scored easy
layupson. That's why they shot
so well."
Dißiaso said that to win to
night, Stanford "must execute
well on offense and defense.
On. offense, we cannot allow
the game to be a run-and-shoot
contest. We are not going to
stall, we're going to make them
work for their shots."
He does not foresee any
changes being made to play
the Bruins.
"We aren't going to change
in mid-season, we just want to
do what we do well," Dißiaso
said.

league in scoring and rebounding.

Sophomore forward Kimberly Belton will lead
the charge against the Bruins after two stellar
performances in Los Angeles. Belton had 38
points and 21 rebounds in the two games to hike
his team-leading stats to 15.2 points and 8.9 re
bounds per game. He is fifth in the conference
in both categories, and is second in field-goal
percentage at 56.5 percent. Teammate Jay Carter
is third.
As for postseason performances, Cunnin
gham is superstitiously quiet. Yet it is obvious
that this team, barring a sudden collapse, will go
a long way in the NCAA tournament. In last
week's San Francisco Chronicle, Ex-Marquette
Coach Al McCuire said that "Cunningham has
them playing like a team and that'll beat a lot of
talent."
Stanford's opponent, tradition and all, looms
large over Maples Pavilion tonight. Cardinal
loyalists can take heart in knowing that stranger
things have happened. After all, who lasted
longer, the Romans or the Christians?
