The Daily is interested in publishing regular bi
weekly columns written by members of the Stanford
community. To be columnists, persons must want to
write interesting and discussion-provoking columns
on whatever they feel are important topics and prob
lems of today, and also to present the viewpoints of
diverse campus groups. You don't have to be a stu
dent to be a columnist â€” just a good writer. We're
especially interested in hearing from people who
represent and want to write about such groups as
graduate students, women and minorities. Interested
persons should submit one sample column to the
Daily by Friday, Feb. 24.The Daily regrets that submit
ted articles can not be returned. No compensation.
Send columns to: Opinions, The Stanford Daily,
Storke Student Publications Building, Stanford, CA
94305.
