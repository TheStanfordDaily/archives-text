# Inter-Sorority Council forms; interest in sororities growing
## 
### Cheryl Eschbach 
Over 100 University women have
committed themselves to one of six
national sororities chapters coloniz
ing here, and the new Inter-sorority
Council (ISC) has begun weekly
meetings in anticipation of an active
spring rush.
The ISC, composed of representa
tives from each sorority, wants soror
ity development and spring rush to
be a Panhellenic effort, keeping
competition "absolutely minimal,"
said ISC member Bonnie McColl.
With 34 members, the Kappa
Kappa Gamma sorority "unfortu
nately" had to close its colony to or
ganize for rush activities, President
Lola Nashashiki said.
The Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha
Theta, Alpha Phi, Pi Beta Phi and
Kappa Delta sororities are still col
onizing, with memberships varying
from 10 to 20 women. Many of the

sororities have had officer elections
and will soon begin community
philanthropic projects.
Strict University policy on
sororities may pose some problems
to those chapters requiring alumnae
references. Under the lifted ban,
sorority selection "may not in any
manner involve letters of reference
from any source outside the Univer
sity."
This was one of the items which
brought the Kappa Kappa Gamma na
tional president here from Atlanta
last week to discuss with colony
members and administrators.

President Jean Wells said that al
though alumnae references are
"strictly informational," and do not
need to be used for selection, they
are still required by the national
chapter's constitution.
In Wells' meeting with Dean of Re
sidential Education Norm Robinson,
the Kappa policy "did not square"
with the University's provisions for
re-admitting sororities, according to
Nashashibi.
Nashashibi said the University's
stipulation on references was "in
consistent" with freedom to form

Toyon house associates and residents put the finishing touches on an 80-foot-long
ice cream sundae Thursday night. Created inside a metal rain gutter on Toyon's
second floor, the gastronomical delight included 18 gallons of ice cream along
with generous servings of whipped cream, syrups, nuts and fruit. After finishing
their masterpiece, the builders proceeded to mane short work of the confection.
sororities guaranteed under Title IX.
"But references do not matter to us
at all," she added.
Another national sorority with the
same alumnae reference require
ment is considering suspending the
requirement for the Stanford soror
ity. National officers of the Alpha
Phi's will make a final decision at a
meeting in late February.
According to Robinson, the
sororities requiring alumnae refer
ences will continue to remain off
campus organizations unrecognized
by the University. To obtain campus
housing, sororities must de
monstrate that they have no policy
interference from national chapters.
Even in these circumstances, hous
ing will not be available for "at least
several years," Robinson said.
Some sorority pledges say they
prefer not having residential status.
"It allows sororities to grow in a
much.more natural and non
competitive atmosphere," said an
Alphi Phi pledge.

women interested in the sorority. Alpha Phi is among four sororities here which

Toyon house associates and residents put the finishing touches on an 80-foot-long
ice cream sundae Thursday night. Created inside a metal rain gutter on Toyon's
second floor, the gastronomical delight included 18 gallons of ice cream along
with generous servings of whipped cream, syrups, nuts and fruit. After finishing
their masterpiece, the builders proceeded to mane short work of the confection.
sororities guaranteed under Title IX.
"But references do not matter to us
at all," she added.
Another national sorority with the
same alumnae reference require
ment is considering suspending the
requirement for the Stanford soror
ity. National officers of the Alpha
Phi's will make a final decision at a
meeting in late February.
According to Robinson, the
sororities requiring alumnae refer
ences will continue to remain off
campus organizations unrecognized
by the University. To obtain campus
housing, sororities must de
monstrate that they have no policy
interference from national chapters.
Even in these circumstances, hous
ing will not be available for "at least
several years," Robinson said.
Some sorority pledges say they
prefer not having residential status.
"It allows sororities to grow in a
much.more natural and non
competitive atmosphere," said an
Alphi Phi pledge.

Alpha Phi's ice cream social, one of its recent rush functions, attracted about 25
women interested in the sorority. Alpha Phi is among four sororities here which
have begun planning for a spring rush.
Over 100 University women have
committed themselves to one of six
national sororities chapters coloniz
ing here, and the new Inter-sorority
Council (ISC) has begun weekly
meetings in anticipation of an active
spring rush.
The ISC, composed of representa
tives from each sorority, wants soror
ity development and spring rush to
be a Panhellenic effort, keeping
competition "absolutely minimal,"
said ISC member Bonnie McColl.
With 34 members, the Kappa
Kappa Gamma sorority "unfortu
nately" had to close its colony to or
ganize for rush activities, President
Lola Nashashiki said.
The Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha
Theta, Alpha Phi, Pi Beta Phi and
Kappa Delta sororities are still col
onizing, with memberships varying
from 10 to 20 women. Many of the

sororities have had officer elections
and will soon begin community
philanthropic projects.
Strict University policy on
sororities may pose some problems
to those chapters requiring alumnae
references. Under the lifted ban,
sorority selection "may not in any
manner involve letters of reference
from any source outside the Univer
sity."
This was one of the items which
brought the Kappa Kappa Gamma na
tional president here from Atlanta
last week to discuss with colony
members and administrators.

President Jean Wells said that al
though alumnae references are
"strictly informational," and do not
need to be used for selection, they
are still required by the national
chapter's constitution.
In Wells' meeting with Dean of Re
sidential Education Norm Robinson,
the Kappa policy "did not square"
with the University's provisions for
re-admitting sororities, according to
Nashashibi.
Nashashibi said the University's
stipulation on references was "in
consistent" with freedom to form
