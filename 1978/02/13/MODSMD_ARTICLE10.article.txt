Ads demean medicine
While I am in general agreement
that doctors should not advertise, I
do not foresee "quacks" alone ad
vertising. The danger lies in misuse
that demeans the dignity of the pa
tient and the profession. The real
issue is one of providing information
to the public concerning health care
and costs. We must ask ourselves if
advertising is-an adequate forum for
this purpose.
Let's not misconstrue medicine's
reluctance to adopt advertising of
services as an attempt to continue to
dispense health care from an ivory
tower. Rather, one might view this
reluctance as a genuine concern
about the misrepresentation and im
agery that is so much a part of Ameri
can advertising.
The complaint that most Ameri
cans know little about theirdoctors is
a valid one. To think that this situa
tion will improve through advertising
betrays a lack of completeness in at
tacking the problem. Such a partial
solution assumes advertising will
present a forthright source of infor
mation to the American public and
open up medicine to the tenets of
competition.
Advertising might well succeed in
doing the latter although I am not
convinced that the side-effects of
competition in a capitalist economy
do not outweigh the benefits of
competition itself (witness what
competition has done for the pre
ponderance of additives in our food
or the built-in obsolescence of
American cars, for instance). That it
will provide information for use by
the public to discern competent care
at a reasonable price ignores the real
purpose of advertising.
Theater of absurd
Advertising in this country has be
come a theater of the absurd. It is a
game with few rules designed only to
sell a product. Advertisements are
rife with nuances ranging from the
subliminal sexual advance to snob
appeal. If medical advertising were
designed to announce a specialty or
benefits to persons with low income,
I doubt anyone would complain.
There is, however, little control
over the content of an advertise
ment. Anyone watching a few hours
of television would quickly concede
this. There is no guarantee that med
ical advertising would not find itself,
in response to competition, forced
to stoop to the subhuman level of a
Ceritol commercial. And any attempt
to limit the scope of medical advertis
ing would only precipitate anguished
cries of abridgment of free speech.
Referrals reliable
It is not at all incredible that a
"qualified, competent, compassion

ate" doctor might not want to adver
tise even if his/her intentions are
good. Doctors with these qualities
hardly need to worry about filling
their waiting rooms. They, as well as
their patients, can rely on reputation
and referral. Word of mouth in local
communities far outstrips the dubi
ous benefits to be garnered from the
gospel of Madison Avenue.
To give doctors the green light on
advertising, I fear, would give the
minority unsavory element of
medicine an opportunity to cash in
on skills they do not possess. A
happy medium hopefully exists. I for
one do not want to see the public
kept ignorant of the services they de
served. But nor do I wish to see
medicine follow the path blazed by
such successful commodities as
Ultra-Brite toothpaste and Stay Free
Mini-pads.

Friedman unjustly smeared
It almost seems inappropriate to
write a rebuttal to Bruce Hamm's
smear of Milton Friedman (Daily,
Feb. 8). More than anything else, that
editorial was a testimonial to the use
of anti-capitalistic slogans in re
placement of a decent knowledge of
basic economics.
Apparently Mr. Hamm believes
that he can pull quotations out of
context from Newsweek, tack'on a
phrase such as "the poor could sim
ply go without heat. . and
thereby refute all of economic
theory.
But the real reason Hamm's article
is dangerous is that it uses a tactic
which we see too much of today:
guilt by association. Friedman is
guilty because he advised a Chilian
junta. (One wonders if Hamm would
have argued if, say, Angela Davis had
advised the junta.)
Slander heaped high
Certain economists are guilty be
cause they assoiate with the
"Chicago Gang" as Hamm puts it.
Modern economics is guilty because
it is associated with American busi
ness. Etc., etc., etc. Never is there
given what any rational economist
would call proof, just slander piled
on top of slander.
And even what might be called
proof, upon closer inspection says
nothing like what Hamm would want
it to say. He gives us the data that
Friedman advised the Chilian gov
ernment, and then one year later in
flation stood at 200 percent annually.
Vet we are not told what the infla
tion rate was before Friedman ad
vised them, nor to what extent they
followed his advice! So once again
we have guilt by association. (Note:
inflation rates are commonly that
high in South American regimes.)

Lastly, Hamm falls into the most
common trap that guilt-by
association has ever caused: busi
ness is guilty because the economy is
doing poorly. The truth of the mat
ter, and one of Friedman's strongest
points, is that the economy is doing
poorly precisely in proportion to the
amount of meddling that govern
ment does with it.
If government would keep its
"cotton-picking'' hands off private
enterprise, then we could see such
wonders as no inflation with no un
employment: a condition which is
commonly thought impossibleinour
present government-oriented soci
ety.

Aurora apologizes
In response to Shivonne Byrne's
letter (Daily, Feb. 3), the Aurora col
lective would like to apologize for
the omission of sororities in theWsV
ing of women's groups on campus. It
was an unintentional oversight. In re
trospect, we should have included
an open apology to any women's or
ganizations that we inadvertently left
out.
We had intended, indeed sol
icited, an article concerning
sororities for this issue. At the last
minute, we decided not to publish it
only becuase we felt it needed to be
rewritten (the author agreed). This
decision is best for the sororities as
well as for the newspaper. The article
on sororities will be in the next issue
as planned. Perhaps you would like
to make some contributions to that
article, or even write one of your
own. We do, as stated in our issue,
welcome all views.

Abortion funds encouraged
We would like to correct Rob Doc
ters' assessment of the legislation of
the ASSU Senate. The purpose of the
resolution concerning abortions was
to encourage continued funding of
abortions by the State of California
through MediCal funds.
This was necessitated by a decision
of the federal government to discon
tinue Medicaid funding for abor
tions. In no way did this legislation
intend to place further restrictions
on abortions. In fact, the proposal
was written to lobby for the rights of
low income women to obtain abor
tions if they so desire. Rob, where
were you at the meeting?
