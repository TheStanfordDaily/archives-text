# Panel details America's oppressive role in Iran
## 
### Rob Lempert 
"It was almost like going
back to Vietnam. The first thing
I saw after getting off the plane
was a U.S. sergeant in the air
port directing American milit
ary personnel," said Don Luce,
freelance reporter recently re
turned from Iran.
Speaking to about 100
people in Annenberg Au
ditorium last Monday night,
Luce, University professors
Pierre Noyes and Raymond
Ciraud and Sared Kadivar of
the Iranian Students Associa
tion told of the massive Ameri
can influence in the Iranian
Shah's repressive regime.
In 1953 a CIA-backed coup
brought the present Shah to
power after the old premier
tried to nationalize Iranian oil
fields owned by Western cor
porations. Last year there were
over 30,000 Americans in the
country, most of them military
personnel, said Giraud.
"The ruling class in Iran has
created a facist regime with the
help of the United States," said
Kadivar. The regime
safeguards the strategic and oil
interests of America and West
ern Europe, he added.
Luce, who spent several
weeks in the Iranian capital of
Tehran, described the repres
sion he saw in the city. He said
he tried to visit college cam
puses but found them as tightly
restricted as prisons are in
America.
He eventually met some stu
dents outside one university,
but Luce said that before they
could talk politics they had to
make up a cover story. The Ira
nian police officers often stop
groups of people on the street,
separate them, and ask each
individual what the conversa
tion was about. If their stories
don't match, each person is li
able for arrest.
On a 30 minute walk bet
ween the market and his hotel,
Luce said he saw three separate
arrests, two of which were de
finitely political. He tried to
take pictures of one of the ar
rests, but a plainclothes
policeman began to interfere.
A crowd gathered and several
Iranians pushed their way bet
ween Luce and the officer.
Luce said the crowd then
opened long enough for him to
take the photo, and then
closed Red Sea style as the
police turned to chase him.
Recalling Americans' en
roneous estimation that Viet
namese peasants were apoliti
cal, Luce warned, "Don't let
anyone say the people in the
(Iranian) market don't have
political sense."
Noyes was also in Iran in
April last year. He described an
incident where an audience

watching a poetry reading
given by an ex-political pris
oner was attacked by the
police. Members of the audi
ence barricaded themselves
inside the lecture hall for 36
hours until they were prom
ised a safe passage out. As they
left, they were machine gun
ned by plainclothes police.
Noyes said the increased use
of plainclothes police is a
dangerous development be
cause the Shah's regime can
disclaim credit for policemen's
actions.
Noyes said the American
military presence in Iran is
enormous. He said the U.S.
sold the Shah more than $6 bill
ion worth of arms last year. Not
only did the CIA help engineer
the coup that placed the Shah
in power but in 1957 they also
helped him organize SAVAK,
the Iranian secret police.
The new U.S. ambassador to
Iran is William Sullivan, the
man who ran the secret war in
Laos during the sixties.
"It's a little surprising after
the experience we had last de
cade that we don't see the

signs (of impending American
military conflict) more
clearly. . . . We're supporting
a regime against the will of its
people," said Noyes.
Upon his return to the Un
ited States, Luce said he at
tended a $150-a-plate dinner
for the Empress of Iran in New
York City. The dinner was at
tended by trustees of several
major oil companies and
former officials of the U.S.
government. Luce said he and
12 others who stood up to
heckle were dragged from the
room by SAVAK agents and
were detained until the em
p. ess had left.
Luce said one major problem
in Iran and in most other third
world countries influenced by
the U.S. is the forced imigra
tion of farmers to the cities.
"We have countries which
were 80 per cent small farmers
and the major program is
mechanization," he said.
Luce added that this forced
migration impoverishes the
people and is only for indus
trialists' benefit.

tended by trustees of several
major oil companies and
former officials of the U.S.
government. Luce said he and
12 others who stood up to
heckle were dragged from the
room by SAVAK agents and
were detained until the em
p. ess had left.
Luce said one major problem
in Iran and in most other third
world countries influenced by
the U.S. is the forced imigra
tion of farmers to the cities.
"We have countries which
were 80 per cent small farmers
and the major program is
mechanization," he said.
Luce added that this forced
migration impoverishes the
people and is only for indus
trialists' benefit.
"It was almost like going
back to Vietnam. The first thing
I saw after getting off the plane
was a U.S. sergeant in the air
port directing American milit
ary personnel," said Don Luce,
freelance reporter recently re
turned from Iran.
Speaking to about 100
people in Annenberg Au
ditorium last Monday night,
Luce, University professors
Pierre Noyes and Raymond
Ciraud and Sared Kadivar of
the Iranian Students Associa
tion told of the massive Ameri
can influence in the Iranian
Shah's repressive regime.
In 1953 a CIA-backed coup
brought the present Shah to
power after the old premier
tried to nationalize Iranian oil
fields owned by Western cor
porations. Last year there were
over 30,000 Americans in the
country, most of them military
personnel, said Giraud.
"The ruling class in Iran has
created a facist regime with the
help of the United States," said
Kadivar. The regime
safeguards the strategic and oil
interests of America and West
ern Europe, he added.
Luce, who spent several
weeks in the Iranian capital of
Tehran, described the repres
sion he saw in the city. He said
he tried to visit college cam
puses but found them as tightly
restricted as prisons are in
America.
He eventually met some stu
dents outside one university,
but Luce said that before they
could talk politics they had to
make up a cover story. The Ira
nian police officers often stop
groups of people on the street,
separate them, and ask each
individual what the conversa
tion was about. If their stories
don't match, each person is li
able for arrest.
On a 30 minute walk bet
ween the market and his hotel,
Luce said he saw three separate
arrests, two of which were de
finitely political. He tried to
take pictures of one of the ar
rests, but a plainclothes
policeman began to interfere.
A crowd gathered and several
Iranians pushed their way bet
ween Luce and the officer.
Luce said the crowd then
opened long enough for him to
take the photo, and then
closed Red Sea style as the
police turned to chase him.
Recalling Americans' en
roneous estimation that Viet
namese peasants were apoliti
cal, Luce warned, "Don't let
anyone say the people in the
(Iranian) market don't have
political sense."
Noyes was also in Iran in
April last year. He described an
incident where an audience

watching a poetry reading
given by an ex-political pris
oner was attacked by the
police. Members of the audi
ence barricaded themselves
inside the lecture hall for 36
hours until they were prom
ised a safe passage out. As they
left, they were machine gun
ned by plainclothes police.
Noyes said the increased use
of plainclothes police is a
dangerous development be
cause the Shah's regime can
disclaim credit for policemen's
actions.
Noyes said the American
military presence in Iran is
enormous. He said the U.S.
sold the Shah more than $6 bill
ion worth of arms last year. Not
only did the CIA help engineer
the coup that placed the Shah
in power but in 1957 they also
helped him organize SAVAK,
the Iranian secret police.
The new U.S. ambassador to
Iran is William Sullivan, the
man who ran the secret war in
Laos during the sixties.
"It's a little surprising after
the experience we had last de
cade that we don't see the

signs (of impending American
military conflict) more
clearly. . . . We're supporting
a regime against the will of its
people," said Noyes.
Upon his return to the Un
ited States, Luce said he at
tended a $150-a-plate dinner
for the Empress of Iran in New
York City. The dinner was at
tended by trustees of several
major oil companies and
former officials of the U.S.
government. Luce said he and
12 others who stood up to
heckle were dragged from the
