# Reider encourages TAs to solicit student feedback

### Monika Guttman 
"Much emphasis goes into
the evaluation of teaching
rather than the improvement
of it," said Gores award winner
John Reider yesterday at the
second meeting of the work
shop series "Academic Con
cerns of the Teaching Assistant
at Stanford."
Before a group of 50 TAs,
Reider led a "guided discus
sion" about the problems and
insecurities of being a TA at the
University. He emphasized
that there is no set of rules
which make a good teacher,
and the "only way to know
what type of job you're doing"
is to "get as much feedback as
possible from the hardest
people to get feedback from:
your students."
Reider received his
Bachelor's in 1967 from the
University's history depart
ment, and currently works in
the Structured Liberal Educa
tion program here. The Cores
award was given to him for

"excellence in teaching." He is
a member of the task force
studying the proposed West
ern Culture requirement.
One of the major problems
the TA has to deal with, accord
ing to Reider, is lack of gui
dance. He pointed out that the
majority of faculty members
pay little attention to sections,
and concentrate mostly on lec
tures.
"Stanford is not about to
have a revolution in this area,"
he said.
The important thing for a TA
is to "know yourself." This in
volves role definition and an
acceptance of one's own
limits.
"The hardest thing to do,"
said Reider, "is to develop a
professional attitude and yet
not imagine too much distance
between yourself and the stu
dents."
During the presentation,
Reider asked various TAs what
they fHt were the biggest prob
lems they have encountered

while teaching. Some men
tioned student-teacher rela
tionships; others spoke of
handling the course material in
an interesting and informative
way. To all of these, Reider's
response was "try to overcome
your sense of isolation."
He also encouraged com
munication with the students,
with other TAs and with pro
fessors.
Another problem brought
up by many TAs was how to
establish a learning environ
ment and then deal with grad
ing the students. Many felt that
grades were "destructive" to
general enjoyment of the sub
ject. Reider suggested that it
wasn't a "breach of etiquette"
for the TAs to ask their students
to evaluate the course, and
thereby "encourage com
munication and release frustra
tion."
The next workshop in this
series, sponsored by the
Center for Teaching and Learn
ing, will be held Feb. 21.
