# Exchange student tells about experiences in S.Africa
## 
### Claire Oshetsky First of two parts 
I spent 1975 living in South
Africa as an exchange student.
I arrived in South Africa with a
strong sense of moral superior
ity, and an acute lack of under
standing of the country and its
problems.
When I left, I was still unable
to quote figures on the number
of blacks in Soweto living in
homes without indoor plumb
ing; I didn't know anything
about the profit margin of U.S.
companies exploiting cheap
labor.
But I had known individual
South Africans of all races and
economic backgrounds. I
learned that the situation in
South Africa is far more com
plicated than people in the Un
ited States generally assume.
I lived in a white community
just outside of Johannesburg.
The family I lived with would
be considered lower middle
class in this country; the father
was a carpenter, the mother a
secretary. They had two
daughters and a servant named
Cinna who cooked and
cleaned six days a week.
Cinna lived in a small room
behind the garage that had a
bed, a small stove and table
cramped into it. 7"he toilet was
in a small alleyway inside the
fence. Cinna was paid a little
more than $30 a month, plus
room and board.
Xhosa member
A member of the Xhosa
tribe, she often sang in her
own language, and would glare
at me whenever I walked into
the room. I was scared to death
of her. She never used the vac
uum cleaner, believing it to be
something evil, but would get
down on her hands and knees
to clean the carpet.
One day she decided to like
me. I know she didn't consider

me a friend; just someone odd
and white who paid attention
to her.
My South African family was
indulgent of me, but its rela
tionship with Cinna was very
different, and a source of ten
sion between us. They called
Cinna "the girl"; she called
them "Madam" and "Boss."
During dinner Cinna waited
in the kitchen until called to
bring the tea. My family would
heatedly discuss the need to
educate "the Bantu" while
Cinna quietly poured tea.
'Bantu'
"Bantu" is the official term
for members of the black race
living in South Africa. I never
heard the word "black" used.
The "Bantu" do not recognize
themselves as a unified group.
Fierce tribalism still exists,
especially in rural areas and is
reinforced by government pol
icy.
Cinna had Sundays off. Early
Sunday morning I would see
her leaving, wearing a long
flowing yellow robe with a
huge white cross on the back,
and a white turban. Although I
never saw where she worship
ped, I would see small groups
of people in the fields away
from the roads, dancing, sing
ing, practicing their own relig
ion.
One day Cinna disappeared.
My family was not very upset
("They do that all of the time")
and did not even advertise for a
new servant ("Word will get
around"). Two days later, the
new "girl" Christina knocked
on the door. My South African
mother immediately asked to
see her authorization pass al
lowing her to work in johan
nesburg.
Slums
Before the pass system was
adopted, huge slums de
veloped in urban areas. The

Soweto township was a mas
sive attempt to clean up the
slum areas. The government
attempts to restrict non-white
settlement in urban areas, and
blacks'must work for the same
employer 10 years before they
are entitled to a home in Sow
eto, where rent is about $5 a
month. Before the 10 years
have passed, blacks are clas
sified as migrant labor.
Because Christina did not
have a proper pass, she
worked for less pay. She was
married, but her husband was
not allowed to live with her be
cause it is unlawful for a black
family to live in a white area.
Christina was about my age,
and her two children lived with
her sister. One night her hus
band came to see her; they had
a terrible fight and the next day
she had a black eye. She was
fired.
Secret society
All of the domestic help on
the street formed a kind of sec
ret society, devoid of tribalism.
The younger ones had grown
up in Soweto and had lost
much of the tribal feeling;
most of the older ones had
lived in Soweto for years and
knew each other well.
They all knew a great deal
about me. They would smile
and begin to speak English
when they saw me coming.
Sometimes they would ask me
if I wanted to bet a quarter on
the underground lottery they
played that had something to
do with voodoo and dreams. A
"girl" down the road had won
$30 once.
Most of the blacks I met were
poor and uneducated. Al
though education for whites is
mandatory and free, the Bantu
are not considered citizens, so

their education is optional and
they must pay for their books.
Job protection
To protect the unskilled
white labor force, the govern
ment long ago began reserving
jobs for whites, giving non
whites very little chance for ad
vancement.
One white South African

man said the "boys" working
for him had no ambition. "If
you pay them too much, they'll
work for three days instead of
five, and spend it all on kaffir
beer,"he told me.
But what was the good of
ambition when they had
nowhere to advance?
Among the blacks I knew, I
sensed a great despair, but

very little open discontent or
rebellion. I met only one black,
Patrick, with whom I could dis
cuss the "South Africa situa
tion."
I met him at a party which he
attended illegally. Patrick had
managed to get an education,
had spent a year in Minnesota
as an exchange student and

was planning to return on a full
scholarship.
He was very bitter; he was
able to object to the system be
cause he had somewhere bet
ter to go. He asked me to come
to see his family in Soweto, but
I was afraid to go. It is unlawful
for whites to enter Soweto
without a pass.

I was afraid to go. It is unlawful
for whites to enter Soweto
without a pass.
(Continued tomorrow)
I spent 1975 living in South
Africa as an exchange student.
I arrived in South Africa with a
strong sense of moral superior
ity, and an acute lack of under
standing of the country and its
problems.
When I left, I was still unable
to quote figures on the number
of blacks in Soweto living in
homes without indoor plumb
ing; I didn't know anything
about the profit margin of U.S.
companies exploiting cheap
labor.
But I had known individual
South Africans of all races and
economic backgrounds. I
learned that the situation in
South Africa is far more com
plicated than people in the Un
ited States generally assume.
I lived in a white community
just outside of Johannesburg.
The family I lived with would
be considered lower middle
class in this country; the father
was a carpenter, the mother a
secretary. They had two
daughters and a servant named
Cinna who cooked and
cleaned six days a week.
Cinna lived in a small room
behind the garage that had a
bed, a small stove and table
cramped into it. 7"he toilet was
in a small alleyway inside the
fence. Cinna was paid a little
more than $30 a month, plus
room and board.
Xhosa member
A member of the Xhosa
tribe, she often sang in her
own language, and would glare
at me whenever I walked into
the room. I was scared to death
of her. She never used the vac
uum cleaner, believing it to be
something evil, but would get
down on her hands and knees
to clean the carpet.
One day she decided to like
me. I know she didn't consider

me a friend; just someone odd
and white who paid attention
to her.
My South African family was
indulgent of me, but its rela
tionship with Cinna was very
different, and a source of ten
sion between us. They called
Cinna "the girl"; she called
them "Madam" and "Boss."
During dinner Cinna waited
in the kitchen until called to
bring the tea. My family would
heatedly discuss the need to
educate "the Bantu" while
Cinna quietly poured tea.
'Bantu'
"Bantu" is the official term
for members of the black race
living in South Africa. I never
heard the word "black" used.
The "Bantu" do not recognize
themselves as a unified group.
Fierce tribalism still exists,
especially in rural areas and is
reinforced by government pol
icy.
Cinna had Sundays off. Early
Sunday morning I would see
her leaving, wearing a long
flowing yellow robe with a
huge white cross on the back,
and a white turban. Although I
never saw where she worship
ped, I would see small groups
of people in the fields away
from the roads, dancing, sing
ing, practicing their own relig
ion.
One day Cinna disappeared.
My family was not very upset
("They do that all of the time")
and did not even advertise for a
new servant ("Word will get
around"). Two days later, the
new "girl" Christina knocked
on the door. My South African
mother immediately asked to
see her authorization pass al
lowing her to work in johan
nesburg.
Slums
Before the pass system was
adopted, huge slums de
veloped in urban areas. The

Soweto township was a mas
sive attempt to clean up the
slum areas. The government
attempts to restrict non-white
settlement in urban areas, and
blacks'must work for the same
employer 10 years before they
are entitled to a home in Sow
eto, where rent is about $5 a
month. Before the 10 years
have passed, blacks are clas
sified as migrant labor.
Because Christina did not
have a proper pass, she
worked for less pay. She was
married, but her husband was
not allowed to live with her be
cause it is unlawful for a black
family to live in a white area.
Christina was about my age,
and her two children lived with
her sister. One night her hus
band came to see her; they had
a terrible fight and the next day
she had a black eye. She was
fired.
Secret society
All of the domestic help on
the street formed a kind of sec
ret society, devoid of tribalism.
The younger ones had grown
up in Soweto and had lost
much of the tribal feeling;
most of the older ones had
lived in Soweto for years and
knew each other well.
They all knew a great deal
about me. They would smile
and begin to speak English
when they saw me coming.
Sometimes they would ask me
if I wanted to bet a quarter on
the underground lottery they
played that had something to
do with voodoo and dreams. A
"girl" down the road had won
$30 once.
Most of the blacks I met were
poor and uneducated. Al
though education for whites is
mandatory and free, the Bantu
are not considered citizens, so

their education is optional and
they must pay for their books.
Job protection
To protect the unskilled
white labor force, the govern
ment long ago began reserving
jobs for whites, giving non
whites very little chance for ad
vancement.
One white South African

man said the "boys" working
for him had no ambition. "If
you pay them too much, they'll
work for three days instead of
five, and spend it all on kaffir
beer,"he told me.
But what was the good of
ambition when they had
nowhere to advance?
Among the blacks I knew, I
sensed a great despair, but

very little open discontent or
rebellion. I met only one black,
Patrick, with whom I could dis
cuss the "South Africa situa
tion."
I met him at a party which he
attended illegally. Patrick had
managed to get an education,
had spent a year in Minnesota
as an exchange student and

was planning to return on a full
scholarship.
He was very bitter; he was
able to object to the system be
cause he had somewhere bet
ter to go. He asked me to come
to see his family in Soweto, but
I was afraid to go. It is unlawful
for whites to enter Soweto

ter to go. He asked me to come
to see his family in Soweto, but
I was afraid to go. It is unlawful
for whites to enter Soweto
without a pass.
(Continued tomorrow)
I spent 1975 living in South
Africa as an exchange student.
I arrived in South Africa with a
strong sense of moral superior
ity, and an acute lack of under
standing of the country and its
problems.
When I left, I was still unable
to quote figures on the number
of blacks in Soweto living in
homes without indoor plumb
ing; I didn't know anything
about the profit margin of U.S.
companies exploiting cheap
labor.
But I had known individual
South Africans of all races and
economic backgrounds. I
learned that the situation in
South Africa is far more com
plicated than people in the Un
ited States generally assume.
I lived in a white community
just outside of Johannesburg.
The family I lived with would
be considered lower middle
class in this country; the father
was a carpenter, the mother a
secretary. They had two
daughters and a servant named
Cinna who cooked and
cleaned six days a week.
Cinna lived in a small room
behind the garage that had a
bed, a small stove and table
cramped into it. 7"he toilet was
in a small alleyway inside the
fence. Cinna was paid a little
more than $30 a month, plus
room and board.
Xhosa member
A member of the Xhosa
tribe, she often sang in her
own language, and would glare
at me whenever I walked into
the room. I was scared to death
of her. She never used the vac
uum cleaner, believing it to be
something evil, but would get
down on her hands and knees
to clean the carpet.
One day she decided to like
me. I know she didn't consider

me a friend; just someone odd
and white who paid attention
to her.
My South African family was
indulgent of me, but its rela
tionship with Cinna was very
different, and a source of ten
sion between us. They called
Cinna "the girl"; she called
them "Madam" and "Boss."
During dinner Cinna waited
in the kitchen until called to
bring the tea. My family would
heatedly discuss the need to
educate "the Bantu" while
Cinna quietly poured tea.
'Bantu'
"Bantu" is the official term
for members of the black race
living in South Africa. I never
heard the word "black" used.
The "Bantu" do not recognize
themselves as a unified group.
Fierce tribalism still exists,
especially in rural areas and is
reinforced by government pol
icy.
Cinna had Sundays off. Early
Sunday morning I would see
her leaving, wearing a long
flowing yellow robe with a
huge white cross on the back,
and a white turban. Although I
never saw where she worship
ped, I would see small groups
of people in the fields away
from the roads, dancing, sing
ing, practicing their own relig
ion.
One day Cinna disappeared.
My family was not very upset
("They do that all of the time")
and did not even advertise for a
new servant ("Word will get
around"). Two days later, the
new "girl" Christina knocked
on the door. My South African
mother immediately asked to
see her authorization pass al
lowing her to work in johan
nesburg.
Slums
Before the pass system was
adopted, huge slums de
veloped in urban areas. The

Soweto township was a mas
sive attempt to clean up the
slum areas. The government
attempts to restrict non-white
settlement in urban areas, and
blacks'must work for the same
employer 10 years before they
are entitled to a home in Sow
eto, where rent is about $5 a
month. Before the 10 years
have passed, blacks are clas
sified as migrant labor.
Because Christina did not
have a proper pass, she
worked for less pay. She was
married, but her husband was
not allowed to live with her be
cause it is unlawful for a black
family to live in a white area.
Christina was about my age,
and her two children lived with
her sister. One night her hus
band came to see her; they had
a terrible fight and the next day
she had a black eye. She was
fired.
Secret society
All of the domestic help on
the street formed a kind of sec
ret society, devoid of tribalism.
The younger ones had grown
up in Soweto and had lost
much of the tribal feeling;
most of the older ones had
lived in Soweto for years and
knew each other well.
They all knew a great deal
about me. They would smile
and begin to speak English
when they saw me coming.
Sometimes they would ask me
if I wanted to bet a quarter on
the underground lottery they
played that had something to
do with voodoo and dreams. A
"girl" down the road had won
$30 once.
Most of the blacks I met were
poor and uneducated. Al
though education for whites is
mandatory and free, the Bantu
are not considered citizens, so

their education is optional and
they must pay for their books.
Job protection
To protect the unskilled
white labor force, the govern
ment long ago began reserving
jobs for whites, giving non
whites very little chance for ad
vancement.
One white South African

man said the "boys" working
for him had no ambition. "If
you pay them too much, they'll
work for three days instead of
five, and spend it all on kaffir
beer,"he told me.
But what was the good of
ambition when they had
nowhere to advance?
Among the blacks I knew, I
sensed a great despair, but

very little open discontent or
rebellion. I met only one black,
Patrick, with whom I could dis
cuss the "South Africa situa
tion."
I met him at a party which he
attended illegally. Patrick had
managed to get an education,
had spent a year in Minnesota
as an exchange student and

was planning to return on a full
scholarship.
He was very bitter; he was
able to object to the system be
cause he had somewhere bet
ter to go. He asked me to come
to see his family in Soweto, but
I was afraid to go. It is unlawful
