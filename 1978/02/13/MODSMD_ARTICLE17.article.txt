# Rape prevention
## ASSU Task Force alerts students

"One out of 10 women will be sexually
assaulted in her lifetime," according to
Maria Sakovich, coordinator of the Rape
Prevention Education Program at U.C.
Berkeley. Such facts prompted the ASSU
Senate to create the ASSU Task Force on
Rape and co-sponsor an all-day workshop
last Saturday to begin a rape education
process here.
The 15 students and community mem
bers who attended the workshop will be
going to campus living groups to discuss
rape prevention, resistance and the poli
tics of rape.
"Women on the Stanford campus have a
false sense of security concerning rape,"
said ASSU Senator Lynn Rubinett.
Workshop participants agreed that
people here share society's myths about
rape. "Men still view rape as a woman's
problem," said Sakovich. However, six of
the 15 workshop participants were men.
One male resident fellow said the prob
lem is that "people on the Stanford cam
pus don't see rape as a problem." How
ever, over half of the participants had had
some intimate experience with rape,
either themselves or through a close
friend.
"Rape deals with domination and con
trol," noted Sakovich. "It is not so much
sex that is sought as power."
One woman in the group said "sex role

playing, where no means yes, and sexist
attitudes where men presume to tell
women what they want," are scenarios
leading to rape.
"Men define themselves in terms of
sexual potency" and often participate in a
"sexual scoring system" where the
number of sexual encounters with women
is compared between competing males,
commented one man.
The group agreed that many women are
raped by men who do not even realize
they are rapists.
Sakovich said that "where prostitution is
legal, rape occurs no less than where it
isn't." This substantiates that rape is not a
sexual act, but one of domination and vio
lence, the participants agreed.
There are two types of rapists, the
stranger rapist and the rapist already
known to the victim. The stranger rapist
chooses a vulnerable person.
"Vulnerability is the key, not looks,"
remarked Sakovich. Physical vulnerability
involves the person and the environment.
Gaining self-defense skills and securing
one's personal home are essential to
minimizing physical vulnerability, she ad
ded.
All women are vulnerable "because they
are women," according to Sakovich.
There is psychological vulnerability instil
led in the female by traditional upbring
ing, the group members noted.

They said they felt it is important for
women to be clear about their measure of
control in any situation they find them
selves in.
"Don't ever give up your measure of
control in the situation," one woman
commented.
Prevention is synonymous with rape av
oidance. We may become "angry and dis
couraged because we're dealing with
symptoms, and not the problem of rape,"
pointed out Sakovtch. Avoidance can be
restrictive, but is helpful, she noted.
"No one method (of rape resistance)
can be advocated," cautioned Sakovich,
"as situations and emotional states of the
victim change."
Studies on resistance have shown that
women who do resist a rapist have a good
chance of getting away without being
raped," said Sakovich. She cautioned that
passivity does not guarantee there will not
be violence.
In general, she suggests not to panic and
to keep thinking, to evaluate the situation,
and to keep trying whatever one feels
might work. If a person decides to carry a
weapon she should be prepared to use it,
and intend to use it without hesitation,
Sakovich added.
Submitting to the rape can be seen as
effective resistance because "the point of
resisting is to get out of the attack with as
little harm as possible," said Sakovich.

chooses a vulnerable person.
"Vulnerability is the key, not looks,"
remarked Sakovich. Physical vulnerability
involves the person and the environment.
Gaining self-defense skills and securing
one's personal home are essential to
minimizing physical vulnerability, she ad
ded.
All women are vulnerable "because they
are women," according to Sakovich.
There is psychological vulnerability instil
led in the female by traditional upbring
ing, the group members noted.

They said they felt it is important for
women to be clear about their measure of
control in any situation they find them
selves in.
"Don't ever give up your measure of
control in the situation," one woman
commented.
Prevention is synonymous with rape av
oidance. We may become "angry and dis
couraged because we're dealing with
symptoms, and not the problem of rape,"
pointed out Sakovtch. Avoidance can be
restrictive, but is helpful, she noted.
"No one method (of rape resistance)
can be advocated," cautioned Sakovich,
"as situations and emotional states of the
victim change."
Studies on resistance have shown that
women who do resist a rapist have a good
chance of getting away without being
raped," said Sakovich. She cautioned that
passivity does not guarantee there will not
be violence.
In general, she suggests not to panic and
to keep thinking, to evaluate the situation,
and to keep trying whatever one feels
might work. If a person decides to carry a
weapon she should be prepared to use it,
and intend to use it without hesitation,
Sakovich added.
Submitting to the rape can be seen as
effective resistance because "the point of
resisting is to get out of the attack with as
little harm as possible," said Sakovich.
"One out of 10 women will be sexually
assaulted in her lifetime," according to
Maria Sakovich, coordinator of the Rape
Prevention Education Program at U.C.
Berkeley. Such facts prompted the ASSU
Senate to create the ASSU Task Force on
Rape and co-sponsor an all-day workshop
last Saturday to begin a rape education
process here.
The 15 students and community mem
bers who attended the workshop will be
going to campus living groups to discuss
rape prevention, resistance and the poli
tics of rape.
"Women on the Stanford campus have a
false sense of security concerning rape,"
said ASSU Senator Lynn Rubinett.
Workshop participants agreed that
people here share society's myths about
rape. "Men still view rape as a woman's
problem," said Sakovich. However, six of
the 15 workshop participants were men.
One male resident fellow said the prob
lem is that "people on the Stanford cam
pus don't see rape as a problem." How
ever, over half of the participants had had
some intimate experience with rape,
either themselves or through a close
friend.
"Rape deals with domination and con
trol," noted Sakovich. "It is not so much
sex that is sought as power."
One woman in the group said "sex role

playing, where no means yes, and sexist
attitudes where men presume to tell
women what they want," are scenarios
leading to rape.
"Men define themselves in terms of
sexual potency" and often participate in a
"sexual scoring system" where the
number of sexual encounters with women
is compared between competing males,
commented one man.
The group agreed that many women are
raped by men who do not even realize
they are rapists.
Sakovich said that "where prostitution is
legal, rape occurs no less than where it
isn't." This substantiates that rape is not a
sexual act, but one of domination and vio
lence, the participants agreed.
There are two types of rapists, the
stranger rapist and the rapist already
known to the victim. The stranger rapist
chooses a vulnerable person.
"Vulnerability is the key, not looks,"
remarked Sakovich. Physical vulnerability
involves the person and the environment.
