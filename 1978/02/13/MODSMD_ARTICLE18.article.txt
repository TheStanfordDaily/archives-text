# Cards miss their reward once more
## Bruins prevail, 79-63; Trojans win another stunner, 70-68 
### David Georgette 
"I feel disappointed that we lost. I
feel disappointed for the players be
cause they work so hard and don't win.
But there's nothing that says if you work
hard you get the reward at the end."
—Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso
For most of 40 minutes Friday and
Saturday nights at Maples Pavilion, the
Stanford Cardinals played good, hard
basketball against the two top teams in
the Pacific-8. But for their efforts, all the
Cards came away with in terms of the
conference standings were two more
losses that dropped them to 1-8 and
deeper into the basement of the Pac-8.
Maybe worse, though, was the feel
ing the coaches, players and fans had
Friday night when USC's Don Carfino
sank a 26-foot jump shot with two sec
onds left to ruin a Stanford comeback
and lift the Trojans to a 70-68 victory.
Saturday night, the feelings weren't
as bad since the sight of UCLA forward
David Greenwood racing out of
nowhere and leaping high to swat away
a sure lay-in by the Cards' Wolfe Perry
underscored the fact Stanford was
overmatched in its 79-63 loss to the
fifth-ranked Bruins.
"We had to have things go our way
tonight to win," said Dißiaso after the
Bruin game. "We did our part. To beat
UCLA you have to play as well as we did
tonight and get all the calls. To beat
them you either have to stall or have an
all-out, emotional effort."
The Cards sure didn't get the calls
from umpire Bob Sitov or well-known
referee Booker Turner, but they did
play well and consistently kept the
Bruins from turning the game into a
repeat of the 101-64 game two Thurs
days ago.
Stanford trailed 39-31 at half after
UCLA had jumped out to a 27-13 lead
midway through the first half on the

strength of 11 early points by center Gig
Sims.
But then Kimberly Belton and Jeff
McHugh each hit two buckets*, includ
ing a smashing dunk tip by Belton, as
the Cards closed to 47-41 with 14:52 to
play.
That was the closest Stanford got be
cause Roy Hamilton hit two jumpers
and Greenwood added five points to
push the Bruins to a 56-43 lead. They
were up by at least eight the rest of the
way.
Hamilton and backcourt partner Ray
Townsend finished as the game's top
scorers with 24 and 19 points, respec
tively. "We had trouble in the first half
with their zone defense," said UCLA
coach Gary Cunningham, "and our
guards weren't hitting. But we made
adjustments at halftime and we showed
a lot more patience. Our guards Hamil
ton and Townsend did an excellent job
against their defense."
Belton, playing his third straight
strong game, and Perry, with 13 points
in the first half, finished as the Cards'
top scorers with 15 points each. "Belton
was doubtful up until three minutes be
fore the game," said Dißiaso. "He has
tendinitis in his knee and it's very pain
ful."
Sudden silence
More than Belton's knee was hurting
Friday night after Carfino had silenced
the roaring Stanford fans with his
game-winning shot. George Schader,
the Cards' top scorer with 17 points,
took off his shirt in disgust and Perry
just stood in the lane, stunned at the
Cards' second last-second loss to the
Trojans in less than a week.
Perry's two free throws with 11 sec
onds left pulled the Cards into a 68-68
tie after they had been down 67-60 with
2:22 remaining. McHugh hit a jumper,
Schader snuck in for a lay-in on a pass
from Daryle Morgan, and then McHugh

canned two free throws with 1:27 left to
get the Cards back in the game.
"People wonder why you lose close
games like that," said Dißiaso. "If
someone can figure out why we have
lost two straight with two seconds to
go, I'd like to know. Our players again
deserved to win and didn't."
The Cards trailed 41-34 early in the
second half, but scored eight straight
points to go ahead 44-43 on a three
point play by Schader with 13:20 to
play. Then USC ran off a 12-4 scoring
streak and was up by at least four until
Stanford rallied.
"We had no set play for late game
shots," said USC coach Bob Boyd, who
did not call time out after Perry had tied
the game. "I felt it was better to ad
vance quickly, and we were lucky."
But the Trojans were good, too,
especially center Cliff Robinson, who
worked around the basket and scored
most of his2l points witha soft jumper.
During one stretch in the first half,
USC outscored the Cards 20-4 and then
led by six at half. "When they made
their run, we had breakdowns in our
execution," said Dißiaso. "We weren't
setting screens or using them. We
made some turnovers. At the same
time, we didn't play good defense.
Other than that, I thought our guys
played very hard, as hard as is necessary
to win."
But hard work is not always re
warded.

fore the game," said Dißiaso. "He has
tendinitis in his knee and it's very pain
ful."
Sudden silence
More than Belton's knee was hurting
Friday night after Carfino had silenced
the roaring Stanford fans with his
game-winning shot. George Schader,
the Cards' top scorer with 17 points,
took off his shirt in disgust and Perry
just stood in the lane, stunned at the
Cards' second last-second loss to the
Trojans in less than a week.
Perry's two free throws with 11 sec
onds left pulled the Cards into a 68-68
tie after they had been down 67-60 with
2:22 remaining. McHugh hit a jumper,
Schader snuck in for a lay-in on a pass
from Daryle Morgan, and then McHugh

canned two free throws with 1:27 left to
get the Cards back in the game.
"People wonder why you lose close
games like that," said Dißiaso. "If
someone can figure out why we have
lost two straight with two seconds to
go, I'd like to know. Our players again
deserved to win and didn't."
The Cards trailed 41-34 early in the
second half, but scored eight straight
points to go ahead 44-43 on a three
point play by Schader with 13:20 to
play. Then USC ran off a 12-4 scoring
streak and was up by at least four until
Stanford rallied.
"We had no set play for late game
shots," said USC coach Bob Boyd, who
did not call time out after Perry had tied
the game. "I felt it was better to ad
vance quickly, and we were lucky."
But the Trojans were good, too,
especially center Cliff Robinson, who
worked around the basket and scored
most of his2l points witha soft jumper.
During one stretch in the first half,
USC outscored the Cards 20-4 and then
led by six at half. "When they made
their run, we had breakdowns in our
execution," said Dißiaso. "We weren't
setting screens or using them. We
made some turnovers. At the same
time, we didn't play good defense.
Other than that, I thought our guys
played very hard, as hard as is necessary
to win."
But hard work is not always re
warded.

feel disappointed for the players be
cause they work so hard and don't win.
But there's nothing that says if you work
hard you get the reward at the end."
—Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso
For most of 40 minutes Friday and
Saturday nights at Maples Pavilion, the
Stanford Cardinals played good, hard
basketball against the two top teams in
the Pacific-8. But for their efforts, all the
Cards came away with in terms of the
conference standings were two more
losses that dropped them to 1-8 and
deeper into the basement of the Pac-8.
Maybe worse, though, was the feel
ing the coaches, players and fans had
Friday night when USC's Don Carfino
sank a 26-foot jump shot with two sec
onds left to ruin a Stanford comeback
and lift the Trojans to a 70-68 victory.
Saturday night, the feelings weren't
as bad since the sight of UCLA forward
David Greenwood racing out of
nowhere and leaping high to swat away
a sure lay-in by the Cards' Wolfe Perry
underscored the fact Stanford was
overmatched in its 79-63 loss to the
fifth-ranked Bruins.
"We had to have things go our way
tonight to win," said Dißiaso after the
Bruin game. "We did our part. To beat
UCLA you have to play as well as we did
tonight and get all the calls. To beat
them you either have to stall or have an
all-out, emotional effort."
The Cards sure didn't get the calls
from umpire Bob Sitov or well-known
referee Booker Turner, but they did
play well and consistently kept the
Bruins from turning the game into a
repeat of the 101-64 game two Thurs
days ago.
Stanford trailed 39-31 at half after
UCLA had jumped out to a 27-13 lead
midway through the first half on the

strength of 11 early points by center Gig
Sims.
But then Kimberly Belton and Jeff
McHugh each hit two buckets*, includ
ing a smashing dunk tip by Belton, as
the Cards closed to 47-41 with 14:52 to
play.
That was the closest Stanford got be
cause Roy Hamilton hit two jumpers
and Greenwood added five points to
push the Bruins to a 56-43 lead. They
were up by at least eight the rest of the
way.
Hamilton and backcourt partner Ray
Townsend finished as the game's top
scorers with 24 and 19 points, respec
tively. "We had trouble in the first half
with their zone defense," said UCLA
coach Gary Cunningham, "and our
guards weren't hitting. But we made
adjustments at halftime and we showed
a lot more patience. Our guards Hamil
ton and Townsend did an excellent job
against their defense."
Belton, playing his third straight
strong game, and Perry, with 13 points
in the first half, finished as the Cards'
top scorers with 15 points each. "Belton
was doubtful up until three minutes be
fore the game," said Dißiaso. "He has
tendinitis in his knee and it's very pain

"I feel disappointed that we lost. I
feel disappointed for the players be
cause they work so hard and don't win.
But there's nothing that says if you work
hard you get the reward at the end."
—Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso
For most of 40 minutes Friday and
Saturday nights at Maples Pavilion, the
Stanford Cardinals played good, hard
basketball against the two top teams in
the Pacific-8. But for their efforts, all the
Cards came away with in terms of the
conference standings were two more
losses that dropped them to 1-8 and
deeper into the basement of the Pac-8.
Maybe worse, though, was the feel
ing the coaches, players and fans had
Friday night when USC's Don Carfino
sank a 26-foot jump shot with two sec
onds left to ruin a Stanford comeback
and lift the Trojans to a 70-68 victory.
Saturday night, the feelings weren't
as bad since the sight of UCLA forward
David Greenwood racing out of
nowhere and leaping high to swat away
a sure lay-in by the Cards' Wolfe Perry
underscored the fact Stanford was
overmatched in its 79-63 loss to the
fifth-ranked Bruins.
"We had to have things go our way
tonight to win," said Dißiaso after the
Bruin game. "We did our part. To beat
UCLA you have to play as well as we did
tonight and get all the calls. To beat
them you either have to stall or have an
all-out, emotional effort."
The Cards sure didn't get the calls
from umpire Bob Sitov or well-known
referee Booker Turner, but they did
play well and consistently kept the
Bruins from turning the game into a
repeat of the 101-64 game two Thurs
days ago.
Stanford trailed 39-31 at half after
UCLA had jumped out to a 27-13 lead
midway through the first half on the

strength of 11 early points by center Gig
Sims.
But then Kimberly Belton and Jeff
McHugh each hit two buckets*, includ
ing a smashing dunk tip by Belton, as
the Cards closed to 47-41 with 14:52 to
play.
That was the closest Stanford got be
cause Roy Hamilton hit two jumpers
and Greenwood added five points to
push the Bruins to a 56-43 lead. They
were up by at least eight the rest of the
way.
Hamilton and backcourt partner Ray
Townsend finished as the game's top
scorers with 24 and 19 points, respec
tively. "We had trouble in the first half
with their zone defense," said UCLA
coach Gary Cunningham, "and our
guards weren't hitting. But we made
adjustments at halftime and we showed
a lot more patience. Our guards Hamil
ton and Townsend did an excellent job
against their defense."
Belton, playing his third straight
strong game, and Perry, with 13 points
in the first half, finished as the Cards'
top scorers with 15 points each. "Belton
was doubtful up until three minutes be
fore the game," said Dißiaso. "He has
tendinitis in his knee and it's very pain
ful."
Sudden silence
More than Belton's knee was hurting
Friday night after Carfino had silenced
the roaring Stanford fans with his
game-winning shot. George Schader,
the Cards' top scorer with 17 points,
took off his shirt in disgust and Perry
just stood in the lane, stunned at the
Cards' second last-second loss to the
Trojans in less than a week.
Perry's two free throws with 11 sec
onds left pulled the Cards into a 68-68
tie after they had been down 67-60 with
2:22 remaining. McHugh hit a jumper,
Schader snuck in for a lay-in on a pass
from Daryle Morgan, and then McHugh

canned two free throws with 1:27 left to
get the Cards back in the game.
"People wonder why you lose close
games like that," said Dißiaso. "If
someone can figure out why we have
lost two straight with two seconds to
go, I'd like to know. Our players again
deserved to win and didn't."
The Cards trailed 41-34 early in the
second half, but scored eight straight
points to go ahead 44-43 on a three
point play by Schader with 13:20 to
play. Then USC ran off a 12-4 scoring
streak and was up by at least four until
Stanford rallied.
"We had no set play for late game
shots," said USC coach Bob Boyd, who
did not call time out after Perry had tied
the game. "I felt it was better to ad
vance quickly, and we were lucky."
But the Trojans were good, too,
especially center Cliff Robinson, who
worked around the basket and scored
most of his2l points witha soft jumper.
During one stretch in the first half,
USC outscored the Cards 20-4 and then
led by six at half. "When they made
their run, we had breakdowns in our
execution," said Dißiaso. "We weren't
setting screens or using them. We
made some turnovers. At the same
time, we didn't play good defense.
Other than that, I thought our guys
played very hard, as hard as is necessary
to win."
But hard work is not always re
warded.

"I feel disappointed that we lost. I
feel disappointed for the players be
cause they work so hard and don't win.
But there's nothing that says if you work
hard you get the reward at the end."
—Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso
For most of 40 minutes Friday and
Saturday nights at Maples Pavilion, the
Stanford Cardinals played good, hard
basketball against the two top teams in
the Pacific-8. But for their efforts, all the
Cards came away with in terms of the
conference standings were two more
losses that dropped them to 1-8 and
deeper into the basement of the Pac-8.
Maybe worse, though, was the feel
ing the coaches, players and fans had
Friday night when USC's Don Carfino
sank a 26-foot jump shot with two sec
onds left to ruin a Stanford comeback
and lift the Trojans to a 70-68 victory.
Saturday night, the feelings weren't
as bad since the sight of UCLA forward
David Greenwood racing out of
nowhere and leaping high to swat away
a sure lay-in by the Cards' Wolfe Perry
underscored the fact Stanford was
overmatched in its 79-63 loss to the
fifth-ranked Bruins.
"We had to have things go our way
tonight to win," said Dißiaso after the
Bruin game. "We did our part. To beat
UCLA you have to play as well as we did
tonight and get all the calls. To beat
them you either have to stall or have an
all-out, emotional effort."
The Cards sure didn't get the calls
from umpire Bob Sitov or well-known
referee Booker Turner, but they did
play well and consistently kept the
Bruins from turning the game into a
repeat of the 101-64 game two Thurs
days ago.
Stanford trailed 39-31 at half after
UCLA had jumped out to a 27-13 lead
midway through the first half on the

strength of 11 early points by center Gig
Sims.
But then Kimberly Belton and Jeff
McHugh each hit two buckets*, includ
ing a smashing dunk tip by Belton, as
the Cards closed to 47-41 with 14:52 to
play.
That was the closest Stanford got be
cause Roy Hamilton hit two jumpers
and Greenwood added five points to
push the Bruins to a 56-43 lead. They
were up by at least eight the rest of the
way.
Hamilton and backcourt partner Ray
Townsend finished as the game's top
scorers with 24 and 19 points, respec
tively. "We had trouble in the first half
with their zone defense," said UCLA
coach Gary Cunningham, "and our
guards weren't hitting. But we made
adjustments at halftime and we showed
a lot more patience. Our guards Hamil
ton and Townsend did an excellent job
against their defense."
Belton, playing his third straight
strong game, and Perry, with 13 points
in the first half, finished as the Cards'
top scorers with 15 points each. "Belton
was doubtful up until three minutes be
fore the game," said Dißiaso. "He has
tendinitis in his knee and it's very pain
ful."
Sudden silence
More than Belton's knee was hurting
Friday night after Carfino had silenced
the roaring Stanford fans with his
game-winning shot. George Schader,
the Cards' top scorer with 17 points,
took off his shirt in disgust and Perry
just stood in the lane, stunned at the
Cards' second last-second loss to the
Trojans in less than a week.
Perry's two free throws with 11 sec
onds left pulled the Cards into a 68-68
tie after they had been down 67-60 with
2:22 remaining. McHugh hit a jumper,
Schader snuck in for a lay-in on a pass
from Daryle Morgan, and then McHugh

canned two free throws with 1:27 left to
get the Cards back in the game.
"People wonder why you lose close
games like that," said Dißiaso. "If
someone can figure out why we have
lost two straight with two seconds to
go, I'd like to know. Our players again
deserved to win and didn't."
The Cards trailed 41-34 early in the
second half, but scored eight straight
points to go ahead 44-43 on a three
point play by Schader with 13:20 to
play. Then USC ran off a 12-4 scoring
streak and was up by at least four until
Stanford rallied.
"We had no set play for late game
shots," said USC coach Bob Boyd, who
did not call time out after Perry had tied
the game. "I felt it was better to ad
vance quickly, and we were lucky."
But the Trojans were good, too,
especially center Cliff Robinson, who
worked around the basket and scored
most of his2l points witha soft jumper.
During one stretch in the first half,
USC outscored the Cards 20-4 and then
led by six at half. "When they made
their run, we had breakdowns in our
execution," said Dißiaso. "We weren't
setting screens or using them. We
made some turnovers. At the same
time, we didn't play good defense.
Other than that, I thought our guys
played very hard, as hard as is necessary
to win."
But hard work is not always re
warded.
