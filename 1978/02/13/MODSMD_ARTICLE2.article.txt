# Hoover Memorial Building, sole monument to former president, gets finishing touches
## 
### Alfred Nakatsuma 
The Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building, located at the base of
Hoover Tower, is scheduled for
completion next month.
The building, which will serve Uni
versity students and patrons of the
Hoover Institution on War, Revolu
tion and Peace, is situated parallel to
the Lou Henry Hoover Building and

will complete the Hoover Quad
rangle.
The building honors the late Presi
dent Herbert Hoover, a Stanford
graduate, and acknowledges his
humanitarian activities £nd many
years of public service to Stanford
and the nation.
Congress determined that this
complex will be the only federal

memorial to Hoover, and provided
$7 million on a one-for-one matching
basis for construction. The Hoover
Institution has already matched the
$7 million federal grant.
Although the exact cost of con
struction can't be determined now,
the building will be completed for
less than the $9.7 million approved
by the University trustees, according
to Rita Campbell, director of con
struction.
The three-story building also has
two basement floors. It will provide
space for needed facilities, Campbell
said, including staff, conference and
seminar rooms, display rooms, arc
hive reading and processing rooms,
computer facilities, publications of
fices and fumigation and repair
rooms.
Hoover collection
Archives currently stored in
Hoover Tower will be moved to the
new building, Campbell said. She
added that this collection represents
the largest private archive collection
in the United States.

Hoover Institution personnel who
are forced to rent office space be
cause of a lack of office rooms will
soon be able to move into the
Hoover Memorial Building,
Campbell said.
More new buildings
Two pavilion-like structures will be
located in a courtyard between the
three main buildings. One will con
tain an auditorium and a faculty
scholar meeting room, and the
other, closest to Hoover Tower, will
house the archive reading room and
the exhibit room.
The new structures are of modern
design, with exterior accents of red
wood paneling. The center of the
Hoover Quadrangle will hold a large
'fountain fashioned of brick. The new
structures will occupy approximately
102,000 gross square feet.
Groundbreaking for construction
began )uly 22,1976, and the building
is slated to be completed late next
month. However, dedication will not
be until late spring or early summer,
Campbell said.

More new buildings
Two pavilion-like structures will be
located in a courtyard between the
three main buildings. One will con
tain an auditorium and a faculty
scholar meeting room, and the
other, closest to Hoover Tower, will
house the archive reading room and
the exhibit room.
The new structures are of modern
design, with exterior accents of red
wood paneling. The center of the
Hoover Quadrangle will hold a large
'fountain fashioned of brick. The new
structures will occupy approximately
102,000 gross square feet.
Groundbreaking for construction

The Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building, located at the base of
Hoover Tower, is scheduled for
completion next month.
The building, which will serve Uni
versity students and patrons of the
Hoover Institution on War, Revolu
tion and Peace, is situated parallel to
the Lou Henry Hoover Building and

will complete the Hoover Quad
rangle.
The building honors the late Presi
dent Herbert Hoover, a Stanford
graduate, and acknowledges his
humanitarian activities £nd many
years of public service to Stanford
and the nation.
Congress determined that this
complex will be the only federal

memorial to Hoover, and provided
$7 million on a one-for-one matching
basis for construction. The Hoover
Institution has already matched the
$7 million federal grant.
Although the exact cost of con
struction can't be determined now,
the building will be completed for
less than the $9.7 million approved
by the University trustees, according
to Rita Campbell, director of con
struction.
The three-story building also has
two basement floors. It will provide
space for needed facilities, Campbell
said, including staff, conference and
seminar rooms, display rooms, arc
hive reading and processing rooms,
computer facilities, publications of
fices and fumigation and repair
rooms.
