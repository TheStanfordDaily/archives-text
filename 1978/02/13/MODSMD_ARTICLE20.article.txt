# Bruins rout Stanford women
## 
### Sukie Jackson 
Stanford coach Dottie
McCrea called them a "great
team." Player Stephanie Galef
said "they were the best team
we've ever played." Sports Il
lustrated ranked them eighth
in the country and one sur
prised fan called them "awe
some."
UCLA boasts an excellent
women's basketball team and
its 99-69 victory over Stanford
Saturday night didn't surprise
anyone. McCrea was even
pleased that Stanford played as
well as it did. "We did well to
hold them under 100 points.
Everybody played well and
gave 100 per cent," she said.
Stanford did play well and at
half time the Cards trailed the
Bruins by only seven points,
40-33. "We came out flat,"
UCLA coach Billie Moore said,
"and their very patient offense
slowed us down."

By the second half, though,
UCLA had warmed up. With an
effective full court press, the
Bruins forced the Cards to
make turnovers which were
converted into successful fast
breaks. Ann Meyers, who
made several baskets off steals,
paced the Bruins well
balanced attack.
"Usually one or two players
on a team are quick," junior
guard Calef said, "but on
UCLA they're all quick." Play
ing a fast, running game, the
Bruins widened the seven
point lead at halftime to 30
points.
Five UCLA team members hit
double figures in the contest.
Meyers made 12 ot 22 from the
field for 24 points while Diane
Frierson put in 19 points. Anita
Ortega netted 18, Denise Curry
added 16 and Beth Moore had
10.
For Stanford, Maggie Nelson

led with 25 points. Kathy Mur
phy scored 13 points and Galef
had eight before she and Mur
phy fouled out with about 10
minutes remaining in the
game. "We could have stayed a
lot closer if three of us didn't
foul out," Calef said. Betsy
Lough also fouled out with four
minutes left.
UCLA leads the Western Col
legiate Athletic Conference
with a 5-0 record and is 12-3
overall. UCLA's losses came
against Eastern teams in games
that "we should have won,"
Moore said. "But we came
back (from the trip east) a
much better team,'' she added.
But the Bruins, who have
nine women on full or partial
scholarships, dominate the
West. "UCLA is six to seven
years ahead of us in terms of
recruiting," McCrea said. Op
timistic of the future, she ad

ded, "in two or three more
years we hope to be competi
tive with them."
In the immediate future the
Cards (13-8) have to think
about their two upcoming
games. Tomorrow, Stanford
travels to face Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo and Wednesday the
Cards play at Fresno State.
Both games begin at 7 p.m.

Saturday night didn't surprise

hold them under 100 points.
Everybody played well and
gave 100 per cent," she said.
Stanford did play well and at
half time the Cards trailed the
Bruins by only seven points,
40-33. "We came out flat,"
UCLA coach Billie Moore said,
"and their very patient offense
slowed us down."

UCLA had warmed up. With an
effective full court press, the
Bruins forced the Cards to
make turnovers which were
converted into successful fast
breaks. Ann Meyers, who
made several baskets off steals,
paced the Bruins well
balanced attack.
"Usually one or two players
on a team are quick," junior
guard Calef said, "but on
UCLA they're all quick." Play
ing a fast, running game, the
Bruins widened the seven

points.
Five UCLA team members hit
double figures in the contest.
Meyers made 12 ot 22 from the
field for 24 points while Diane
Frierson put in 19 points. Anita
