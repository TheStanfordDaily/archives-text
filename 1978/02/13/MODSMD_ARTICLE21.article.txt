# Rain washes out half of baseball weekend
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Saturday morning was a
beautiful day for a ball game
with spring-like sunshineanda
bright blue sky, so the Stanford
baseball team took advantage
of the weather to play its sec
ond full game of the season.
The Ca r ds defeated the Uni
versity of the Pacific 6-3 in the
first game of Saturday's doub
leheader, then had the second
game halted because of dark
ness with the score tied at 3-3 at
the end of six innings.
The team was scheduled to
conclude the half-finished
second game and play a third
yesterday at Stockton, but
rainy skies put an end to that
plan. Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess said he hopes
to make up the game sometime
in the next couple of weeks,

but that will depend on UOP's
schedule. So, after two wet
weeks of the baseball pre
season, the Cards stand unde
feated at 2-0.
"We didn't play well, but we
won," coach Marquess com
mented after the game. "We
played as if we hadn't played
for 10 days, and that was
exactly what it was. We've only
been on the field two out of the
last 10 days, and that makes it
hard."
In the first game Stanford
held UOP scoreless until the
late innings while the Cardinals
worked their way through four
pitchers, rapping out 12 hits.
Brian Harrison, starting pitcher
for the Cards, threw six good
innings, allowing only two hits
and feeling strong throughout
his stint.

Catcher Bruce Walters sing
led with two men down in the
bottom of the third to start the
Cards three-run inning. Pepe
Hinojosa and Randy Wong
then drew walks to load the
bases with Larry Reynolds com
ing to the plate. Reynolds then
singled in Walters and
Hinojosa for two of his three
RBI for the game.
Wong, who had advanced to
third on a UOP error accom
panying Reynolds' hit, added
the third Stanford tally on Tom
Guardino's single.
Stanford added single runs
in the fourth and sixth innings
making the score 5-0. In the top
of the seventh, Bruce Fiala
came on in relief of Harrison
and UOP capitalized on a
bloop single and two Stanford
errors to score its first run.

With two outs, a third strike got
by catcher Walters and rolled
all the way to the backstop.
Fiala covered home and re
ceived the throw from Walters
in time, but the umpire ruled
the UOP baserunner safe.
UOP rallied again in the top
of the eighth, adding two more
runs on a couple of singles that
had eyes and a cos f ly Stanford
error. Stanford answered in
the bottom of that inning with a
final run on a double by Dave
Perez, a single by Walters, and
a long fly to center by
Hinojosa.
Harrison was pleased with
his performance, picking up
his first win of this year. "With
the exception of the fifth in
ning (when he walked a couple
of batters) I felt really strong,"
Harrison commented. "Right

now I'm throwing pretty well."
Marquess said "both Harri
son and (Larry) Kuhn (who
started the second game)
threw good games."
The Cardinals are hoping for
fair weather throughout the
week, since they meet Santa
Clara and Hayward on Tuesday
and Wednesday and then face
a tough Pepperdine at Sunken
Diamond this weekend.
