# Women collect swim win
## 
### Andy Lowe 
Despite unrelenting twice
a-day workouts, the women's
swim team overwhelmed its
competition at the Northern
California Athletic Conference
Swimming and Diving Champ
ionships over the weekend,
amassing a record 1385 points.
Enjoying the warmest weather
of the winter at deGuerre Pool
Complex, the Cards won 20 of
24 events and qualified several
people for the AIAW Nationals
at Duke University in March.
The highlight of the meet
was the performance of the
Stanford divers, coached by
Kick Schavonne. "They all de

serve a lot of credit," praised
Schavonne after the competi
tion. "Everyone has improved
immensely over the season be
cause of a lot of hard work,
patience and determination."
Both Ann Carey and Carol
Noonan assured themselves of
berths on the AIAW trip, qual
ifying for the one- and three
meter competitions. Pam
Cruzy's one-meter point total
of 359.70 was just short of the
AIAW standard, which she will
attempt to better in the upcom
ing Stanford Invitational.
Montreal Olympian Kim
Peyton swept the freestyle
events, winning the 50-, 100-,

200- and 500-yard races. Valerie
Lee posted a nation-leading
16:49.68 in the gruelling 1650
freestyle, pacing teammates
Laura Raymond (17:11.69) and
Kim Shettle (17:24.54) to post
AIAW standards as well.

Stanford's Margot Hagstette, here swimming the breaststroke leg of
the medley, captured both the 100 and 200 individual medley titles
Saturday.
Despite unrelenting twice
a-day workouts, the women's
swim team overwhelmed its
competition at the Northern
California Athletic Conference
Swimming and Diving Champ
ionships over the weekend,
amassing a record 1385 points.
Enjoying the warmest weather
of the winter at deGuerre Pool
Complex, the Cards won 20 of
24 events and qualified several
people for the AIAW Nationals
at Duke University in March.
The highlight of the meet
was the performance of the
Stanford divers, coached by
Kick Schavonne. "They all de

serve a lot of credit," praised
Schavonne after the competi
tion. "Everyone has improved
immensely over the season be
cause of a lot of hard work,
patience and determination."
Both Ann Carey and Carol
Noonan assured themselves of
berths on the AIAW trip, qual
ifying for the one- and three
meter competitions. Pam
Cruzy's one-meter point total
of 359.70 was just short of the
AIAW standard, which she will
attempt to better in the upcom
ing Stanford Invitational.
Montreal Olympian Kim
Peyton swept the freestyle
events, winning the 50-, 100-,

200- and 500-yard races. Valerie
Lee posted a nation-leading
16:49.68 in the gruelling 1650
freestyle, pacing teammates
Laura Raymond (17:11.69) and
Kim Shettle (17:24.54) to post
AIAW standards as well.

Stanford's Margot Hagstette, here swimming the breaststroke leg of
the medley, captured both the 100 and 200 individual medley titles
Saturday.
Despite unrelenting twice
a-day workouts, the women's
swim team overwhelmed its
competition at the Northern
California Athletic Conference
Swimming and Diving Champ
ionships over the weekend,
amassing a record 1385 points.
Enjoying the warmest weather
of the winter at deGuerre Pool
Complex, the Cards won 20 of
24 events and qualified several
people for the AIAW Nationals
at Duke University in March.
The highlight of the meet
was the performance of the
Stanford divers, coached by
Kick Schavonne. "They all de

serve a lot of credit," praised
Schavonne after the competi
tion. "Everyone has improved
immensely over the season be
cause of a lot of hard work,
patience and determination."
Both Ann Carey and Carol
Noonan assured themselves of
berths on the AIAW trip, qual
ifying for the one- and three
meter competitions. Pam
Cruzy's one-meter point total
of 359.70 was just short of the
AIAW standard, which she will
attempt to better in the upcom
ing Stanford Invitational.
Montreal Olympian Kim
Peyton swept the freestyle
events, winning the 50-, 100-,

200- and 500-yard races. Valerie
Lee posted a nation-leading
16:49.68 in the gruelling 1650
freestyle, pacing teammates
Laura Raymond (17:11.69) and
Kim Shettle (17:24.54) to post
AIAW standards as well.
