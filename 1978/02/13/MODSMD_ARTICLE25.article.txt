# Volleyball loses two

The Stanford men's volleyball team traveled to Los Angeles last
weekend to take on two of the nation's powerhouses, Pepper
dine and UCLA. Unfortunately for the Cards, both teams played
nearly flawless volleyball as Stanford lost to Pepperdine 3-15,6-15
and 10-15, and then to UCLA 6-15, 3-15 and 3-15. Card coach Art
Lambert said, "About the only thing that went right all weekend
was winning the coin toss against UCLA."
While none of the Cards played extremely well, Jack Foxworth
played a good game against Pepperdine. His tremendous hustle
and consistent all-around play gave some inspiration to Stanford
in a losing cause. The Cards' front did not play well, and this was a
contributing factor to the losses. Lambert, though, attributed the
losses to the poor passing and, consequently, the bad setting.
When discussing the team's play, Lambert had the same com
ments and criticisms he has had all year. "These losses can be
explained, to a large part, by the youth of the team. We are very,
very young and have a long way to go. There are mostly freshmen
and sophomores on the team and it will take some time to get
things together."
