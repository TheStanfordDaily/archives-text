Stanford's men dropped
both gymnastics meets during
their weekend trip to southern
California. Friday night the
Cardinals placed third behind
Long Beach State and UCLA
while USC finished ahead in
competition Saturday night in
the final scheduled meets of
the season.
"The main thingwas that Tad
Bostick and Al Nemcek
couldn't go on the vaulting and
floor exercise events," said
head coach Sadao Hamada.
"There I think we lost a few
points on each event." Nem
cek sprained his ankle against
California last Saturday and
Bostick was hurt Thursday in
practice.
In Friday's meet, Stanford
had good individual perfor
mances, but not enough to
upset the Bruins or 49ers. The
team scores were Long Beach
207.8, UCLA 197.0and Stanford
187.20.
"Both UCLA and Long Beach
are much better teams than we
are. We didn't do terribly bad,
we just had a few injuries. 187's
a pretty good score without
those guys (Bostick and Nem
cek),'' Hamada said.
Stanford's individual bright
spots included Chris
Takimoto's 9.5 pommel horse

performance, Ken Gorman's
second-place routine in vault
ing, and Steve Waichler's
showing in floor exercise,
good for third place.
Bostick placed fourth on the
high bar, and Shep Kinsman
earned fourth in vaulting. Tak
ing over as Stanford's top all
around competitor, Kinsman
totaled 45.75 for second place
Against USC, the Cardinals
team performance was close as
the Trojans outpaced Stanford
190.15 to 185.40.
Leading the Cardinals were
Gorman and Waichler who
placed second and third in
floor exericse, Bob Daniels,
taking second on parallel bars,
and Takimoto.who remains
undefeated on pommel horse
this season.
Gorman also placed first in
vaulting, Bostick won the high
bar and parallel bar competi
tion, and Kinsman earned
fourth in all around totals.
Dan Margulies competed in
vaulting and high bar in both
meets. Filling in for Nemcek at
vaulting, Margulies did well,
especially against Long Beach,
when he scored 8.75.
Nevertheless, riamada com
mented that he "couldn't quite
replace those guys — they
would have probably gotten
nines."
