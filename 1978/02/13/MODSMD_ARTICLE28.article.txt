Emergency declared in L.A.
Los Angeles — More rain pounded already storm
battered canyons and hillsides in the Los Angeles area
yesterday, and Mayor Tom Bradley declared a state of
emergency in the city.
Bradley said the vicious storm which struck the area
Friday caused an estimated $22.6 million damage, de
stroyed five homes and severely damaged 120 others.
As Bradley made his proclamation, residents struggl
ing to dig out of the mud and debris deposited by Fri
day's storm braced for more flooding and mudslides.
The National Weather Service is expecting up to an
inch of rain out of the new storm.
About 100 residents of the Pinecrest Estates area of
suburban La Crescenta, about 20 miles north of Los
Angeles, were advised to leave their homes yesterday.
Eleven deaths have been attributed to the storm.
Settlement rejected by UMW
Washington —The bargaining council of the United
Mine Workers union overwhelmingly rejected a prop
osed settlement of the nationwide coal strike yesterday,
ordering President Arnold Miller to commence new
negotiations with the soft coal industry.
The action came in the 69th day of the strike, one day
after the Carter administration ordered that plans be
drawn up for emergency movement of coal to areas
running critically short of fuel needed to produce elec
tric power.
The protracted coal strike by some 160,000 miners —
the longest in the nation's history — is threatening some
mid-western and Appalachian states with critical fuel
shortages.
Israel accuses U.S. of taking sides
Jerusalem — Israel declared yesterday that the United
States was "taking sides" in Mideast peace negotiations
when Secretary of State Cyrus Vance last week con
demned Israeli settlements in occupied Arab lands.
The accusation, contained in an Israeli cabinet resolu
tion, was the sharpest one made so far against
Washington by Prime Minister Menachem Begin's
eight-month-old conservative government.
The resolution, adopted unanimously at the regular
weekly cabinet meeting, was read afterward by Begin to
reporters.
His government declared its "regret and protest" over
Vance's remarks at a news conference Friday. Vance said
Israeli settlements in occupied Arab territories "should
not exist" and he supported a Palestinian homeland on
land now controlled by Israel.
Burger continues attack on lawyers
New Orleans — Chief Justice Warren Burger, already
under fire for questioning the competence of half the
nation's trial lawyers, escalated his attack yesterday by
declaring that all lawyers should have to earn the right to
appear in court.
Calling trial lawyer incompetence "one of the most
serious problems facing our profession," Burger told
the American Bar Association convention:
"Until we establish special standards for the right to
appear in the courts, independent of admissions to the
bar generally, we will not solve our problem. I am per
suaded that one of the major reasons for congestion and
delay in the courts . . . is the inadequate performance of
many lawyers who come into the courts."
Burger, the nation's highest-ranking judge, dedicated
the major portion of his annual State of the judiciary

speech to the controversial issue of trial lawyer compe
tence.
Snowplow causes air crash; 41 die
Cranbrool, British Columbia — The pilot of a jetliner
that crashed in flames while trying to land in a
snowstorm probably was trying to avoid hitting a
snowplow on the runway, Pacific Western Airlines offi
cials said yesterday. Forty-one persons died in the crash.
The twin-engine Pacific Western Boeing 737 overshot
the runway, slammed into a snowbank and broke apart
Saturday. Seven aboard survived. One of the dead was
an infant who was not known to be aboard until the body
was found yesterday.
Kees Fransbergen, the airline's assistant vice presi
dent for flight operations, said investigators didn't know
how or why the snowplow got on the runway in the path
of the incoming jetliner.
Six passengers and a flight attendant, seated in the
plane's tail section, survived, and were taken to Cran
brook District Hospital. Two were in critical condition
yesterday.
ERA setback in S. Carolina, Virginia
Washington — Supporters of the Equal Rights
Amendment are looking for a psychological lift follow
ing setbacks in South Carolina and Virginia, while oppo
nents are hoping they can stall the ratification process
for another year.
Six years after Congress approved the ERA, the
amendment is still three states short of the 38 needed for
ratification. And with the March 22,1979, expiration date
little more than a year away, the opponents believe time
is on their side.
Thirty-five states have approved the amendment since
1972, when it cleared Congress. Idaho, Tennessee and
Nebraska have sought to rescind their ratification votes,
but the Justice Department has said that recisions are
not binding.
Supporters of the ERA are conceding they have deen
disheartened by the developments in South Carolina
and Virginia last week. But they are regrouping and
vowing to work for the defeat of elected officials who
voted against the ERA.
More snow predicted for Sierra
The Sierra, already reporting as much as 14Vi feet of
snow in some locations, braced for another wind
whipped snowstorm yesterday as a Pacific front whisked
across northern California.
Avalanche warnings were posted along the eastern
slope of the central Sierra by the United States Forest
Service.
Three people were presumed to have died in an ear
lier avalanche in the area. On Friday, a wall of snow
swept two men in a truck and one on foot into the Twin
Lakes, Mono County sheriff's officials said.
Bill Denney, National Weather Service forecaster,
predicted the snow would continue through the night in
most mountain areas. "A foot or so of snow" was ex
pected yesterday afternoon and night, officials said.
Today's Weather
Showers likely through this morning. Mostly sunny
this afternoon with decreasing chance of showers. Fair
tonight. Increasing cloudiness tomorrow with chance of
rain before evening. Little temperature change. Lows
upper 30s and 40s. Highs 50s. Chance of rain 60 per cent
today.

Snowplow causes air crash; 41 die
Cranbrool, British Columbia — The pilot of a jetliner
that crashed in flames while trying to land in a
snowstorm probably was trying to avoid hitting a
snowplow on the runway, Pacific Western Airlines offi
cials said yesterday. Forty-one persons died in the crash.
The twin-engine Pacific Western Boeing 737 overshot
the runway, slammed into a snowbank and broke apart
Saturday. Seven aboard survived. One of the dead was
an infant who was not known to be aboard until the body
was found yesterday.
Kees Fransbergen, the airline's assistant vice presi
dent for flight operations, said investigators didn't know
how or why the snowplow got on the runway in the path
of the incoming jetliner.
Six passengers and a flight attendant, seated in the
plane's tail section, survived, and were taken to Cran
brook District Hospital. Two were in critical condition
yesterday.
ERA setback in S. Carolina, Virginia
Washington — Supporters of the Equal Rights
Amendment are looking for a psychological lift follow
ing setbacks in South Carolina and Virginia, while oppo
nents are hoping they can stall the ratification process
for another year.
Six years after Congress approved the ERA, the
amendment is still three states short of the 38 needed for
ratification. And with the March 22,1979, expiration date
little more than a year away, the opponents believe time
is on their side.
Thirty-five states have approved the amendment since
1972, when it cleared Congress. Idaho, Tennessee and
Nebraska have sought to rescind their ratification votes,
but the Justice Department has said that recisions are
not binding.
Supporters of the ERA are conceding they have deen
disheartened by the developments in South Carolina
and Virginia last week. But they are regrouping and
vowing to work for the defeat of elected officials who
voted against the ERA.
More snow predicted for Sierra
The Sierra, already reporting as much as 14Vi feet of
snow in some locations, braced for another wind
whipped snowstorm yesterday as a Pacific front whisked
across northern California.
Avalanche warnings were posted along the eastern
slope of the central Sierra by the United States Forest
Service.
Three people were presumed to have died in an ear
lier avalanche in the area. On Friday, a wall of snow
swept two men in a truck and one on foot into the Twin
Lakes, Mono County sheriff's officials said.
Bill Denney, National Weather Service forecaster,
predicted the snow would continue through the night in
most mountain areas. "A foot or so of snow" was ex
pected yesterday afternoon and night, officials said.
Today's Weather
Showers likely through this morning. Mostly sunny
this afternoon with decreasing chance of showers. Fair
tonight. Increasing cloudiness tomorrow with chance of
rain before evening. Little temperature change. Lows
upper 30s and 40s. Highs 50s. Chance of rain 60 per cent
today.
Emergency declared in L.A.
Los Angeles — More rain pounded already storm
battered canyons and hillsides in the Los Angeles area
yesterday, and Mayor Tom Bradley declared a state of
emergency in the city.
Bradley said the vicious storm which struck the area
Friday caused an estimated $22.6 million damage, de
stroyed five homes and severely damaged 120 others.
As Bradley made his proclamation, residents struggl
ing to dig out of the mud and debris deposited by Fri
day's storm braced for more flooding and mudslides.
The National Weather Service is expecting up to an
inch of rain out of the new storm.
About 100 residents of the Pinecrest Estates area of
suburban La Crescenta, about 20 miles north of Los
Angeles, were advised to leave their homes yesterday.
Eleven deaths have been attributed to the storm.
Settlement rejected by UMW
Washington —The bargaining council of the United
Mine Workers union overwhelmingly rejected a prop
osed settlement of the nationwide coal strike yesterday,
ordering President Arnold Miller to commence new
negotiations with the soft coal industry.
The action came in the 69th day of the strike, one day
after the Carter administration ordered that plans be
drawn up for emergency movement of coal to areas
running critically short of fuel needed to produce elec
tric power.
The protracted coal strike by some 160,000 miners —
the longest in the nation's history — is threatening some
mid-western and Appalachian states with critical fuel
shortages.
Israel accuses U.S. of taking sides
Jerusalem — Israel declared yesterday that the United
States was "taking sides" in Mideast peace negotiations
when Secretary of State Cyrus Vance last week con
demned Israeli settlements in occupied Arab lands.
The accusation, contained in an Israeli cabinet resolu
tion, was the sharpest one made so far against
Washington by Prime Minister Menachem Begin's
eight-month-old conservative government.
The resolution, adopted unanimously at the regular
weekly cabinet meeting, was read afterward by Begin to
reporters.
His government declared its "regret and protest" over
Vance's remarks at a news conference Friday. Vance said
Israeli settlements in occupied Arab territories "should
not exist" and he supported a Palestinian homeland on
land now controlled by Israel.
Burger continues attack on lawyers
New Orleans — Chief Justice Warren Burger, already
under fire for questioning the competence of half the
nation's trial lawyers, escalated his attack yesterday by
declaring that all lawyers should have to earn the right to
appear in court.
Calling trial lawyer incompetence "one of the most
serious problems facing our profession," Burger told
the American Bar Association convention:
"Until we establish special standards for the right to
appear in the courts, independent of admissions to the
bar generally, we will not solve our problem. I am per
suaded that one of the major reasons for congestion and
delay in the courts . . . is the inadequate performance of

Emergency declared in L.A.
Los Angeles — More rain pounded already storm
battered canyons and hillsides in the Los Angeles area
yesterday, and Mayor Tom Bradley declared a state of
emergency in the city.
Bradley said the vicious storm which struck the area
Friday caused an estimated $22.6 million damage, de
stroyed five homes and severely damaged 120 others.
As Bradley made his proclamation, residents struggl
ing to dig out of the mud and debris deposited by Fri
day's storm braced for more flooding and mudslides.
The National Weather Service is expecting up to an
inch of rain out of the new storm.
About 100 residents of the Pinecrest Estates area of
suburban La Crescenta, about 20 miles north of Los
Angeles, were advised to leave their homes yesterday.
Eleven deaths have been attributed to the storm.
Settlement rejected by UMW
Washington —The bargaining council of the United
Mine Workers union overwhelmingly rejected a prop
osed settlement of the nationwide coal strike yesterday,
ordering President Arnold Miller to commence new
negotiations with the soft coal industry.
The action came in the 69th day of the strike, one day
after the Carter administration ordered that plans be
drawn up for emergency movement of coal to areas
running critically short of fuel needed to produce elec
tric power.
The protracted coal strike by some 160,000 miners —
the longest in the nation's history — is threatening some
mid-western and Appalachian states with critical fuel
shortages.
Israel accuses U.S. of taking sides
Jerusalem — Israel declared yesterday that the United
States was "taking sides" in Mideast peace negotiations
when Secretary of State Cyrus Vance last week con
demned Israeli settlements in occupied Arab lands.
The accusation, contained in an Israeli cabinet resolu
tion, was the sharpest one made so far against
Washington by Prime Minister Menachem Begin's
eight-month-old conservative government.
The resolution, adopted unanimously at the regular
weekly cabinet meeting, was read afterward by Begin to
reporters.
His government declared its "regret and protest" over
Vance's remarks at a news conference Friday. Vance said
Israeli settlements in occupied Arab territories "should
not exist" and he supported a Palestinian homeland on
land now controlled by Israel.
Burger continues attack on lawyers
New Orleans — Chief Justice Warren Burger, already
under fire for questioning the competence of half the
nation's trial lawyers, escalated his attack yesterday by
declaring that all lawyers should have to earn the right to
appear in court.
Calling trial lawyer incompetence "one of the most
serious problems facing our profession," Burger told
the American Bar Association convention:
"Until we establish special standards for the right to
appear in the courts, independent of admissions to the
bar generally, we will not solve our problem. I am per
suaded that one of the major reasons for congestion and
delay in the courts . . . is the inadequate performance of
many lawyers who come into the courts."
Burger, the nation's highest-ranking judge, dedicated
the major portion of his annual State of the judiciary

speech to the controversial issue of trial lawyer compe
tence.
Snowplow causes air crash; 41 die
Cranbrool, British Columbia — The pilot of a jetliner
that crashed in flames while trying to land in a
snowstorm probably was trying to avoid hitting a
snowplow on the runway, Pacific Western Airlines offi
cials said yesterday. Forty-one persons died in the crash.
The twin-engine Pacific Western Boeing 737 overshot
the runway, slammed into a snowbank and broke apart
Saturday. Seven aboard survived. One of the dead was
an infant who was not known to be aboard until the body
was found yesterday.
Kees Fransbergen, the airline's assistant vice presi
dent for flight operations, said investigators didn't know
how or why the snowplow got on the runway in the path
of the incoming jetliner.
Six passengers and a flight attendant, seated in the
plane's tail section, survived, and were taken to Cran
brook District Hospital. Two were in critical condition
yesterday.
ERA setback in S. Carolina, Virginia
Washington — Supporters of the Equal Rights
Amendment are looking for a psychological lift follow
ing setbacks in South Carolina and Virginia, while oppo
nents are hoping they can stall the ratification process
for another year.
Six years after Congress approved the ERA, the
amendment is still three states short of the 38 needed for
ratification. And with the March 22,1979, expiration date
little more than a year away, the opponents believe time
is on their side.
Thirty-five states have approved the amendment since
1972, when it cleared Congress. Idaho, Tennessee and
Nebraska have sought to rescind their ratification votes,
but the Justice Department has said that recisions are
not binding.
Supporters of the ERA are conceding they have deen
disheartened by the developments in South Carolina
and Virginia last week. But they are regrouping and
vowing to work for the defeat of elected officials who
voted against the ERA.
More snow predicted for Sierra
The Sierra, already reporting as much as 14Vi feet of
snow in some locations, braced for another wind
whipped snowstorm yesterday as a Pacific front whisked
across northern California.
Avalanche warnings were posted along the eastern
slope of the central Sierra by the United States Forest
Service.
Three people were presumed to have died in an ear
lier avalanche in the area. On Friday, a wall of snow
swept two men in a truck and one on foot into the Twin
Lakes, Mono County sheriff's officials said.
Bill Denney, National Weather Service forecaster,
predicted the snow would continue through the night in
most mountain areas. "A foot or so of snow" was ex
pected yesterday afternoon and night, officials said.
