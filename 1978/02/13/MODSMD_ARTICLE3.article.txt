## 
### Tom Newell 
The destination of a $9 million en
dowment, currently earmarked for
the Hoover Institution, rides on the
outcome of a legal battle to be waged
Feb. 27 in the Circuit Court of Appe
als in Jefferson County, Mo.
The money would come to the
Hoover Institution from the William
Volker Charities Fund. Of the $10.5
million left in the fund at the end of
October, approximately $9 million
was slated for Hoover.
But Missouri Attorney General
John Ashcroft has alleged that the
plan for distribution of the fund in
volved self-interest and self-dealing
by some of the fund's directors, ac
cording toa University news release.
Ashcroft's office went to court to
halt the donation when it was
learned that Morris Cox, chairman of
the Volker Fund's board of trustees,
had been offered a paid position as a
consultant with the Hoover Institu
tion.
University counters Ashcroft
According fo Robert Rosenzweig,
University vice president for public
affairs, "Stanford has now entered
the suit on the side of the Volker

trustees.
"The decision to close out the fu nd
is perfectly legal within the terms of
the trust and consistent with the pat
tern of distribution," he said.
In a letter to Hoover Institution Di
rector W. Glenn Campbell dated
Dec. 4, 1977, Cox said, "If I am ap
pointed to any position either as a
consultant or on any advisory com
mittee, I will not accept any compen
sation from the University or from
the Hoover Institution for my ef
forts."
Citing Cox's letter, Rosenzweig
said, "I think that makes it clear that
there was no quid pro quo involved
in this case."
Funding provisions
The articles of the Fund's incorpo
ration provide that the money be
spent "to care for the sick, aged and
helpless and relieve those who are
distressed in mind, body and es
tate."
The articles also provide for gifts
"to encourage and provide means
for the development and advance
ment of education and educational
facilities."
Volker always used his money to

self, according to Roy Dietrich, one
of the Fund's trustees.
Before Volker attained his mil
lionaire status he had already gar
nered a reputation around Kansas
City as "a generous, soft touch to
anyone needing money," he added.
Dietrich said that virtually all of
Volker's gifts, from the dollar he gave
to a panhandler to the hundreds of
thousands of dollars he donated to
educational and medical facilities,
were people-oriented.

help those less fortunate than him
self, according to Roy Dietrich, one
of the Fund's trustees.
Before Volker attained his mil
lionaire status he had already gar
nered a reputation around Kansas
City as "a generous, soft touch to
anyone needing money," he added.
Dietrich said that virtually all of
Volker's gifts, from the dollar he gave
to a panhandler to the hundreds of
thousands of dollars he donated to
educational and medical facilities,
were people-oriented.
The destination of a $9 million en
dowment, currently earmarked for
the Hoover Institution, rides on the
outcome of a legal battle to be waged
Feb. 27 in the Circuit Court of Appe
als in Jefferson County, Mo.
The money would come to the
Hoover Institution from the William
Volker Charities Fund. Of the $10.5
million left in the fund at the end of
October, approximately $9 million
was slated for Hoover.
But Missouri Attorney General
John Ashcroft has alleged that the
plan for distribution of the fund in
volved self-interest and self-dealing
by some of the fund's directors, ac
cording toa University news release.
Ashcroft's office went to court to
halt the donation when it was
learned that Morris Cox, chairman of
the Volker Fund's board of trustees,
had been offered a paid position as a
consultant with the Hoover Institu
tion.
University counters Ashcroft
According fo Robert Rosenzweig,
University vice president for public
affairs, "Stanford has now entered
the suit on the side of the Volker

trustees.
"The decision to close out the fu nd
is perfectly legal within the terms of
the trust and consistent with the pat
tern of distribution," he said.
In a letter to Hoover Institution Di
rector W. Glenn Campbell dated
Dec. 4, 1977, Cox said, "If I am ap
pointed to any position either as a
consultant or on any advisory com
mittee, I will not accept any compen
sation from the University or from
the Hoover Institution for my ef
forts."
Citing Cox's letter, Rosenzweig
said, "I think that makes it clear that
there was no quid pro quo involved
in this case."
Funding provisions
The articles of the Fund's incorpo
ration provide that the money be
spent "to care for the sick, aged and
helpless and relieve those who are
distressed in mind, body and es
tate."
The articles also provide for gifts
"to encourage and provide means
for the development and advance
ment of education and educational
facilities."
