# Tradition lives on at 'Zott's'
## Senior happy hour at California landmark 
### Cheryl Fujimoto 
Bier hier, bier hier, oder ich fall um.
California registered
landmark No. 825, the plaque reads,
was built by Felix Buelna in the 1850s
"on the earliest trail used by ran
cheros and American settlers cros
sing the peninsula to the coast," and
since 1868, when it was acquired by
an American, "it has continued to
serve under various names as a
roadhouse and saloon."
It was called Rossotti's — hence
the name Zott's — from about 1939 to
1959, when Don Horthur and John

Alexander bought the establishment
and were required to change the
name under the conditions ot the
sale.
Set among the trees in Portola Val
ley, the Alpine Beer Garden has a
rustic atmosphere accenuated by its
wooden walls covered with prints of
1890s belles, old photographs and
deer heads. At the rear are displayed
Zotts' wooden tabletops dating back
to the 19305, monuments to posterity
of hundreds of individuals who
carved their names into them.
A person walking into Zott's on an

average weekday afternoon will find
men of various ages sitting at the un
crowded bar playing Yahtse or scat
tered among the four long tables (re
placing those on the walls) which,
after only six years, have so many
names engraved into them that there
are, literally, carvings upon carvings.
Friday, however, Zott's was trans
formed from a peaceful establish
ment to one of excitement and activ
ity as the Class of 1978 held its last
happy hour of the quarter.
Two students were engrossed in
outmaneuvering each other in a
game of air hockey while adjacent to
them, other Stanfordites were oc
cupying the pinball machines.
At the long tables, members of the
senior class sat drinking beer, con
suming peanuts and carrying on
animatedconversations while four of
their fellow classmates who had
been to overseas campuses at
Beutelsbach and Cliveden provided
the appropriate background music
by giving hearty renditions of Ger
man and English soccer drinking
songs. One of this latter group wore
a plastic-up beard.
At the bar the regulars were oblivi
ous to the commotion and the wall
to-wall people as they continued un
perturbed in their game of Yahtse.
Biggest drinkers
Peter Jones, a senior class presi
dent, was to lead a group on a
seven-mile jog to the inn but ended
up coming alone. "The senior class
does a lot of drinking but not too
much running," he observed rue
fully. "The two guys who run this
place say that this class does more
drinking than any they've had."
Vet, he remains optimistic and in
tends to better publicize the jog to
the next happy hour. "I think they'll
be just as enthusiastic about running
as drinking — I hope."
Although no more senior happy
hours are planned for this quarter,
there will be a beer-pizza-bowling
study break at the Tresidder Bowling
Alley on Thursday, March 2.
Spring quarter events are still ten
tative, according to Clark Sterling,
another senior class president, be
cause it has not yet been decided if
there will be "one large, spectacular

event," such as a boat dance, the
cost of which would limit other large
activities. (The boat rental alone is
$2500.)
Ideas for other activities include a
day on the green with drinking and
pie-eating contests, a dance at a San
Francisco hotel, and happy hours at
the lake.
One thing is definitely, however:
seniors can look forward to at least
one more happy hour at Zott's.

to-wall people as they continued un
perturbed in their game of Yahtse.
Biggest drinkers
Peter Jones, a senior class presi
dent, was to lead a group on a
seven-mile jog to the inn but ended
up coming alone. "The senior class
does a lot of drinking but not too
much running," he observed rue
fully. "The two guys who run this
place say that this class does more
drinking than any they've had."
Vet, he remains optimistic and in
tends to better publicize the jog to
the next happy hour. "I think they'll
be just as enthusiastic about running
as drinking — I hope."
Although no more senior happy
hours are planned for this quarter,
there will be a beer-pizza-bowling
study break at the Tresidder Bowling
Alley on Thursday, March 2.
Spring quarter events are still ten
tative, according to Clark Sterling,
another senior class president, be
cause it has not yet been decided if
there will be "one large, spectacular

event," such as a boat dance, the
cost of which would limit other large
activities. (The boat rental alone is
$2500.)
Ideas for other activities include a
day on the green with drinking and
pie-eating contests, a dance at a San
Francisco hotel, and happy hours at
the lake.
One thing is definitely, however:
seniors can look forward to at least
one more happy hour at Zott's.
Bier hier, bier hier, oder ich fall um.
California registered
landmark No. 825, the plaque reads,
was built by Felix Buelna in the 1850s
"on the earliest trail used by ran
cheros and American settlers cros
sing the peninsula to the coast," and
since 1868, when it was acquired by
an American, "it has continued to
serve under various names as a
roadhouse and saloon."
It was called Rossotti's — hence
the name Zott's — from about 1939 to
1959, when Don Horthur and John

Alexander bought the establishment
and were required to change the
name under the conditions ot the
sale.
Set among the trees in Portola Val
ley, the Alpine Beer Garden has a
rustic atmosphere accenuated by its
wooden walls covered with prints of
1890s belles, old photographs and
deer heads. At the rear are displayed
Zotts' wooden tabletops dating back
to the 19305, monuments to posterity
of hundreds of individuals who
carved their names into them.
A person walking into Zott's on an

average weekday afternoon will find
men of various ages sitting at the un
crowded bar playing Yahtse or scat
tered among the four long tables (re
placing those on the walls) which,
after only six years, have so many
names engraved into them that there
are, literally, carvings upon carvings.
Friday, however, Zott's was trans
formed from a peaceful establish
ment to one of excitement and activ
ity as the Class of 1978 held its last
happy hour of the quarter.
Two students were engrossed in
outmaneuvering each other in a
game of air hockey while adjacent to
them, other Stanfordites were oc
cupying the pinball machines.
At the long tables, members of the
senior class sat drinking beer, con
suming peanuts and carrying on
animatedconversations while four of
their fellow classmates who had
been to overseas campuses at
Beutelsbach and Cliveden provided
the appropriate background music
by giving hearty renditions of Ger
man and English soccer drinking
songs. One of this latter group wore
a plastic-up beard.
