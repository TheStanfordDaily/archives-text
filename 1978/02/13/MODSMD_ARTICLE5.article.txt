The University is considering the
use of a zero-based budgeting prog
ram, said Vice President for Business
and Finance William Massy in a news
release accompanying the 1976-77 fi
nancial report last week.
"Zero-based budgeting involves a
review and justification of existing
programs from the ground up,"
Massy said. "It builds on previous
programs of goal- and objective
setting and output measurements."
Zero-based budgeting is used in
business and government. "The
methodology must be tailored to the
University setting and Stanford in
particular," Massy said.
"This will be a major task, but the
importance of thoroughly evaluating
programs periodically makes it worth
the time md effort."
Surplus expected
Stanford is in "good health" finan
cially, Massy said. More than $10 mill
ion in expenditures have been cut
and $6 million added to operating in
come during the past eight years. A
$246,000 surplus was achieved in
1976-77 and an additional surphs is
expected this year.
