# University looks into zero-based budgeting
## 
### Susan Hart 
The University is considering the
use of a zero-based budgeting prog
ram, said Vice President for Business
and Finance William Massy in a news
release accompanying the 1976-77 fi
nancial report last week.
"Zero-based budgeting involves a
review and justification of existing
programs from the ground up,"
Massy said. "It builds on previous
programs of goal- and objective
setting and output measurements."
Zero-based budgeting is used in
business and government. "The
methodology must be tailored to the
University setting and Stanford in
particular," Massy said.
"This will be a major task, but the
importance of thoroughly evaluating
programs periodically makes it worth
the time md effort."
Surplus expected
Stanford is in "good health" finan
cially, Massy said. More than $10 mill
ion in expenditures have been cut
and $6 million added to operating in
come during the past eight years. A
$246,000 surplus was achieved in
1976-77 and an additional surphs is
expected this year.

"But financial health, like
academic excellence, is a precarious
condition," Massy said. It can be in
fluenced by sometimes controllable
internal conditions as well as exter
nal changes which are more difficult
to accommodate, Massy added.
"Inflation is paramount among
these," Massy said, "as particularly
exemplified by dramatic cost in
creases in construction, book purch
ases and energy." Other external in

fluences include the securities mar
ket and private gift support.
"Today Stanford's monetary en
dowment, with a market value of
$456 million, is one of the largest
among independent universities in
the U.S., Massy said, "but this figure
is easily misunderstood.
"Relative to the universities with
which Stanford is commonly com
pared, endowment per student
($37,000) and per faculty member
($394,000) are well below those of
Harvard, Vale, Princeton, MIT and
Dartmouth," Massy said.
One decade of budget cuts and ad
justments, however, have resulted in
an improved budget base of $16.3
million.
Budget planning each year con
sists of two stages. First, a five-year
forecast is derived which examines
growth rates of all income and ex
penditures. Second, a detailed
budget for ensuing years is pre
pared.
The central goal of maintaining fi
nancial equilibrium is the effective
management of the University's capi
tal assets: the securities and 8200
acres of land deeded the University
by its founders.
Tuition increases are hoped to be
close to the growth of real personal
income, Massy said. Endowment in
creases have consequently lost

ground in meeting all of the Universi
ty's needs.
Some budget increases for next
year include:
—instruction costs, 9 per cent,
—student financial aid, 17 per
cent,
—student services, 9 per cent,
—research, 7.4 per cent,
—administration, 9 per cent, and
—libraries, 2 per cent.

setting and output measurements."
Zero-based budgeting is used in
business and government. "The
methodology must be tailored to the
University setting and Stanford in
particular," Massy said.
"This will be a major task, but the
importance of thoroughly evaluating
programs periodically makes it worth
the time md effort."
Surplus expected
Stanford is in "good health" finan
cially, Massy said. More than $10 mill

and $6 million added to operating in
come during the past eight years. A
$246,000 surplus was achieved in
1976-77 and an additional surphs is
expected this year.

"But financial health, like
academic excellence, is a precarious
condition," Massy said. It can be in
fluenced by sometimes controllable
internal conditions as well as exter
nal changes which are more difficult
to accommodate, Massy added.
"Inflation is paramount among
these," Massy said, "as particularly
exemplified by dramatic cost in
creases in construction, book purch
ases and energy." Other external in

fluences include the securities mar
ket and private gift support.
"Today Stanford's monetary en
dowment, with a market value of
$456 million, is one of the largest
among independent universities in
the U.S., Massy said, "but this figure
is easily misunderstood.
"Relative to the universities with
which Stanford is commonly com
pared, endowment per student
($37,000) and per faculty member
($394,000) are well below those of
Harvard, Vale, Princeton, MIT and
Dartmouth," Massy said.
One decade of budget cuts and ad
justments, however, have resulted in
an improved budget base of $16.3
million.
Budget planning each year con
sists of two stages. First, a five-year
forecast is derived which examines
growth rates of all income and ex
penditures. Second, a detailed
budget for ensuing years is pre
pared.
The central goal of maintaining fi
nancial equilibrium is the effective
management of the University's capi
tal assets: the securities and 8200
acres of land deeded the University
by its founders.
Tuition increases are hoped to be
close to the growth of real personal
income, Massy said. Endowment in
creases have consequently lost

ground in meeting all of the Universi
ty's needs.
Some budget increases for next
year include:
—instruction costs, 9 per cent,
—student financial aid, 17 per
cent,
—student services, 9 per cent,
—research, 7.4 per cent,
—administration, 9 per cent, and
—libraries, 2 per cent.
The University is considering the
use of a zero-based budgeting prog
ram, said Vice President for Business
and Finance William Massy in a news
release accompanying the 1976-77 fi
nancial report last week.
"Zero-based budgeting involves a
review and justification of existing
programs from the ground up,"
Massy said. "It builds on previous
programs of goal- and objective
setting and output measurements."
