# Western civ supported
## Students cut strands of tradition 
### 
Robert Cohn

Many students are wondering why
the faculty is calling for a renewed
requirement in Western Culture.
The students tend to be against re
quirements altogether and, if there is
one in this area, they believe it
should be more universal, equally
open to cultures other than Western.
I, for one, see it this way: life can
not flourish without a fundamental
sense of direction, e.g. the irreversi
bility of time or the phenomenon of
identity (based on selectivity).
Assymetry in this sense — such as
the tilt toward top, right, front, fu
ture — is found in matter and, even
more so, in biological forms as well
as bio-socral forms such as burial
ritual and incest prohibition. There
is a general human "ecology" which
depends on distinguishing this ver
sus that, our ways versus yours, and
so on.
This tends to express itself on the
earth surface through simple laws of
regionality. Accordingly, even Jack
Kennedy, despite his cosmopolitan
bent, recognized that nationality was
a stubborn fact of life, increasingly as
he took on further responsibility.
Thus we should never be surprised
if, for example, the Soviet Union, de

spite its quest for universality, stres
ses Russian language and history be
fore others, at least in the early years
when basics are mastered (e.g. that
which is prior or priviliged in a given
ecological region).
Stalin himself, who would gladly
have steamrolled over everybody
to flatten them into "communist
man," recognized this principle in
his "Essay on the Language Ques
tion" and related writings on nation
ality. Is it possible that he is more
tolerant of national difference than
our Stanford students?
Strands of tradition
We come down through individual
strands of tradition, racial and/or
ethnic, and in America the predo
minant strand is Christian, to take
one category of identity. There a r e
threads such as the Creek and the
Hebrew woven into the core strand,
but they are clearly subsidiary.
I, for example, as an American Jew
never expected that a course on the
history of the United States would
give "equal time" to Judaism. This
can be problematic at certain layers
of the personaltiy, but that's the way
it works: the prevailing strand im
poses itself on the immigrant ances

tors and their progeny who tend to
cleave to it.
Those who refuse to assimilate can
always go back into their specialized
neighborhoods or even back to the
ancestral land. But fortunately most
do accept such acculturation and
further the general bonding as in
France, which is a successful ethnic
unity woven from many races.
Retain identity
Hence it is vital that our people, if
America is to retain some meaningful
identity and sense of direction, de
velop this understanding of what our
ethnic roots are, learning its "lan
guage" of history (semiotically
speaking) — its great names and
ideas ar.d images — just as we must
together learn — and in our univer
sities learn well — the language we
speak in common, English.
By the same token, great works of
art always bear a strong ethnic flavor,
the stronger the better, along with
their universal appeal, even as they
eschew the two narrowly regional
and mere dialect.
Cultural tolerance
The value of a culture depends
largely on its openness and tolerance
toward the others. But it equally de-

pends on its sense of identity which,
to repeat, is a prior consideration.
One appropriately tends to study the
other cultures later: e.g. one goes off
to )apan or Austria for advanced
study. Or one ce-discovers racial
roots.
So, at last, the reason for insisting
on requirements in the basics such as
western culture and English is to in
sure, at a time when our secondary
schools have abdicated this respon
sibility, that our students have a solid
sense of who they are and where
they are going as they plunge into a
bewilderingly complex and polycul
tural world and "broaden them
selves."
