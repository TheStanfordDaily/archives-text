# Sex, doctors, and Stanford

The California Legislature enacted
a measure last year to make sure new
doctors know how to diagnose and
treat patients' sexual problems. That
kind of training is increasingly rec
ognized as important and useful, but
the law is having some unforeseen
mischievous effects. It says too
much.
The statute, the work of Assemb
lyman John Vasconcellos (D-San
lose), empowers the Board of Medi
cal Quality Assurance toestablish the
required curriculum and the number
of hours' instruction in human sexu
ality that medical school graduates
must have received in order to get
their licenses to practice in Califor
nia. That kind of detail is an intrusion
into academic affairs and can be an
obstacle to innovative teaching.
Sexuality is not theonly area where
California law has specific require
ments. The state, like other states,
mentions anatomy, physiology, en
docrinology, drugs, nutirion and the

detection of child abuse among
other subjects. But in none of these
areas does the statute book contain
much detail. It leaves thecurriculum,
the choice of textbooks, and the mix
between laboratory work and lecture
hall up to the faculty and dean of
each accredited school. There is
where the decision-making power
ought to stay.
A look at one proposal for the new
sexuality courses shows why. A re
port to the Legislature by a panel of
experts suggested requiring "at least
one identifiable and separate course
. . . taught by a multidisciplinary fa
culty, 30 hours long." The course
would cover a list of specific sexual
problems and behavior patterns and
would include slide presentations
and case histories.
It sounds like a perfectly adequate
course. But why should it be the only
authorized approach? One medical
school might get better results by
mixing some facets of a sexuality cur-

riculum into phases of other courses.
Another school might find that its
two most effective instructors on
sexual topics were both from the
same field, and therefore not multi
disciplinary.
Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of Stanford
University's medical school, has
been urging the board not to adopt
this kind of detailed regulation. We
agree with Rich and think the law it
self ought to be changed.
Vasconcellos and other legislators
are right to push medical educators
to offer new kinds of courses such as
sexuality, child abuse and helping
patients cope with dying. Such topics
are needed to adapt medical training
to changing circumstances. The trick
is to leave enough room in the regu
lations so that the adaptation process
can continue.
