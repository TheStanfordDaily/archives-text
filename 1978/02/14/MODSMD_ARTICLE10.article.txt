Radicals gunned down
As interested members of the Stan
ford community who attended Mil
ton Friedman's lecture Thursday
night, we would like to express our
extreme disappointment with the
radical groups in attendance (RSB,
SCRIP, Iranian and Turkish stu
dents).
Though Friedman expressed an
individualistic point-of-view, he im
pressed us with his measured, intel
ligent and consistent presentation.
Since we shared common doubts
about his position, we expected in
telligent questioners to challenge
the basic weaknesses in his
philosophy. Our expectations were
not met.
With callous disregard for other
viewpoints, the radical groups (appa
rently organized) immediately grab
bed most of the places in the
question-line. They then proceeded
to follow a dogmatic line of interro
gation, ignoring the clearly contro
versial points: Friedman's admitted
assumption about the utter primacy
of freedom (vs. for example, equal
ity); his total reliance on a simplified
concept of the individual as an inde
pendent actor in society; and his
utopianism (i.e. he ignores inherent
problems of implementation and
political reality in our society).
Despite obvious preparation, the
radicals engaged in redundant, doc
trinaire, unsubstantiated, impolite,
emotional and ultimately impotent
questioning. A purist like Friedman
looked subtle beside them Often
they indulged in soft-core name
calling or dogmatic labeling and
were blind to occasional agreement
between Friedman and themselves
(e.g. on the misdeeds of the state).
They unfortunately gave the impres
sion of fanaticism by using the
question period for impassioned
speeches rather than incisive and
productive queries.
The radicals' rejection of thought
fulness and common courtesy not
only failed to engender mutual re

spect, but turned off most of the au
dience. We were deeply disap
pointed that these campus groups,
seemingly blinded by the opportu
nity to gun for a major conservative,
completely lost their cool.

SCIRE funding clarified
I am writing in order to clarify a
point that was brought up in the arti
cle on New Directions (Daily, Feb. 8).
The story described the group's lob
bying activities, especially in regard
to the Panama Canal treaty, and also
mentioned a grant from SCIRE.

New Directions was indeed a reci
pient of money from the SCIRE Inno
vation Fund; I would like to em
phasize, however, that the funds
awarded were not for lobbying pur
poses, but for the group's educa
tional fund, specifically to help de
fray the costs of the newsletter.
The SCIRE policy board made its
decision to grant the money only
after a statement from a New Direc
tions spokesman that the Stanford
group has no formal ties with the na
tional organization, and an assur
ance that the funds would be
employed for educational purposes
only.
