# Around since Stalin
## Russians poke fun at way of life 
### James Petrila 
During one of his speeches,
Stalin exclaimed: "I am pre
pared to give my blood for the
cause of the working class,
drop by drop."
Suddenly, the crowd stirred
as a note was passed to the
podium. The leader opened it
and read, "Beloved Comrade
Stalin, why drag things out?
Give it all at once."
Such humor, according to
Emil Draitser, a satirical writer
and recent Soviet emigre,
existed even at the height of
the Stalinist purges, and con
tinues to exist today in the form
of countless jokes and anec
dotes that are comments on
the conditions of life and the
aspirations of the people of the
Soviet Union.
Draitser, who now teaches
Russian at UCLA and whose
works have been published in
such widely known Soviet
journals as "Krokodil" and
"Literaturnaia Gazeta," ad
dressed an audience of over 50
people in the Meyer Forum
Room last Thursday on Soviet
satire, official and under

ground.
Official satire exists in the
Soviet Union, Draitser said,
but cannot be called true satire
because it is confined to pre
scribed limits. Some satirical
writers who are published in
official journals resort to Aeso
pian language in their works.
"The use of double meaning is
both a literary weapon and the
object of constant hunt by the
censors," Draitser said.
Approved ridicule
As an example, Draitser cited
a story that ostensibly attacked
alcoholism, an object of offi
cially approved ridicule be
cause of its wide-spread pre
sence in the Soviet Union.
Our drunken hero, unsuc
cessful in attempts to flag
down a number of taxis that
passed him as he weaved his
way home, noticed in the dis
tance a fellow-drunk, also with
his arm extended, trying to
stop a taxi.
Feeling solidarity with a fel
low drunk, our hero, after a
great deal of struggle, man
aged to drag his comrade
home, only to find that he had

instead helped a statue off its
pedestal and into his apart
ment. The second "drunk"
was, Draitser explained, a satir
ical reference to the innumer
able statues of Lenin, all in the
same pose, found everywhere
in the Soviet Union.
"Lenin, it turns out, is no
longer pointing the way to
communism, but is trying to
hail a taxi," Draitser added.
Aside from such Uncle
Remus stories, "true satire
exists in the Soviet Union only
underground, where it is free
and unrestricted.
"It is as satire should be,"
Draitser said. Underground sa
tire often takes the form of
"anecdotes, sharp, uncom
promising, often vulgar, and
always directly to the mark.
"In the last two decades, un
derground satire has
bloomed," Draitser said, in
large part "because of the
slight loosening of the regime,
and mass disenchantment,
scepticism and lack of faith in
the government."
Jokes evolve out of official
slogans and pronouncements

"since actual life is so different
from official propaganda," ac
cording to Draitser. Such offi
cial slogans as "Hail the
worker, down with the
shirker" offer natural targets
for satire. Shortages of goods
and bureaucratic ineptness,
impossible to satirize officially,
provide targets for sharp witti
cisms.
Shots are also taken at party
officials and constant meetings
aimed at increasing "worker
consciousness." Comrade
Bugarov, for example, is ques
tioning workers at a certain fac
tory who have abysmally low
levels of political awareness.
Who's who
"You, Comrade Glinskii, tell
me who comrade Brezhnev
is," Bugarov demands. Glinskii
only shrugs his shoulders, not
knowing the answer. Bugarov
glowers with rage, and points
at Petrov, demanding to know
who Comrade Kosygin is.
Again, the same result.
Bugarov shouts "You should
come to more meetings. If you
came to more meetings you
would know who these true
friends of the working class
and the Soviet people are."
From the back of the room, a
half-intoxicated voice slurred
"Who is Comrade Ivanov?"
After some silence, Bugarov
says"I don't know, who's
Comrade Ivanov?" to which he
hears the reply "If you
wouldn't come to so many
goddamned meetings you'd
know who's sleepingwith your
wife."
Draitser has had first-hand
experience of the pitfalls that
often await Soviet satirists. He
was prevented from publishing
satire for two years after he had
a review in the humor
magazine "Krokodil" that
ridiculed a play written by the
editor of the influential Soviet
magazine "Teatr" (Theatre).
This prohibition, he said,
"was a major strike" in a series
of incidents that led him to
emigrate in 1974. He spent his
time before emigrating collect
ing hundreds of anecdotes that
have recently been published
in a book entitled "Forbidden
Laughter."

Draitser, who now teaches
Russian at UCLA and whose
works have been published in
such widely known Soviet
journals as "Krokodil" and
"Literaturnaia Gazeta," ad
dressed an audience of over 50
people in the Meyer Forum
Room last Thursday on Soviet
satire, official and under

ground.
Official satire exists in the
Soviet Union, Draitser said,
but cannot be called true satire
because it is confined to pre
scribed limits. Some satirical
writers who are published in
official journals resort to Aeso
pian language in their works.
"The use of double meaning is
both a literary weapon and the
object of constant hunt by the
censors," Draitser said.
Approved ridicule
As an example, Draitser cited
a story that ostensibly attacked
alcoholism, an object of offi
cially approved ridicule be
cause of its wide-spread pre
sence in the Soviet Union.
Our drunken hero, unsuc
cessful in attempts to flag
down a number of taxis that
passed him as he weaved his
way home, noticed in the dis
tance a fellow-drunk, also with
his arm extended, trying to
stop a taxi.
Feeling solidarity with a fel
low drunk, our hero, after a
great deal of struggle, man
aged to drag his comrade
home, only to find that he had

instead helped a statue off its
pedestal and into his apart
ment. The second "drunk"
was, Draitser explained, a satir
ical reference to the innumer
able statues of Lenin, all in the
same pose, found everywhere
in the Soviet Union.
"Lenin, it turns out, is no
longer pointing the way to
communism, but is trying to
hail a taxi," Draitser added.
Aside from such Uncle
Remus stories, "true satire
exists in the Soviet Union only
underground, where it is free
and unrestricted.
"It is as satire should be,"
Draitser said. Underground sa
tire often takes the form of
"anecdotes, sharp, uncom
promising, often vulgar, and
always directly to the mark.
"In the last two decades, un
derground satire has
bloomed," Draitser said, in
large part "because of the
slight loosening of the regime,
and mass disenchantment,
scepticism and lack of faith in
the government."
Jokes evolve out of official
slogans and pronouncements

"since actual life is so different
from official propaganda," ac
cording to Draitser. Such offi
cial slogans as "Hail the
worker, down with the
shirker" offer natural targets
for satire. Shortages of goods
and bureaucratic ineptness,
impossible to satirize officially,
provide targets for sharp witti
cisms.
Shots are also taken at party
officials and constant meetings
aimed at increasing "worker
consciousness." Comrade
Bugarov, for example, is ques
tioning workers at a certain fac
tory who have abysmally low
levels of political awareness.
Who's who
"You, Comrade Glinskii, tell
me who comrade Brezhnev
is," Bugarov demands. Glinskii
only shrugs his shoulders, not
knowing the answer. Bugarov
glowers with rage, and points
at Petrov, demanding to know
who Comrade Kosygin is.
Again, the same result.
Bugarov shouts "You should
come to more meetings. If you
came to more meetings you
would know who these true
friends of the working class
and the Soviet people are."
From the back of the room, a
half-intoxicated voice slurred
"Who is Comrade Ivanov?"
After some silence, Bugarov
says"I don't know, who's
Comrade Ivanov?" to which he
hears the reply "If you
wouldn't come to so many
goddamned meetings you'd
know who's sleepingwith your
wife."
Draitser has had first-hand
experience of the pitfalls that
often await Soviet satirists. He
was prevented from publishing
satire for two years after he had
a review in the humor
magazine "Krokodil" that
ridiculed a play written by the
editor of the influential Soviet
magazine "Teatr" (Theatre).
This prohibition, he said,
"was a major strike" in a series
of incidents that led him to
emigrate in 1974. He spent his
time before emigrating collect
ing hundreds of anecdotes that
have recently been published
in a book entitled "Forbidden
Laughter."
During one of his speeches,
Stalin exclaimed: "I am pre
pared to give my blood for the
cause of the working class,
drop by drop."
Suddenly, the crowd stirred
as a note was passed to the
podium. The leader opened it
and read, "Beloved Comrade
Stalin, why drag things out?
Give it all at once."
Such humor, according to
Emil Draitser, a satirical writer
and recent Soviet emigre,
existed even at the height of
the Stalinist purges, and con
tinues to exist today in the form
of countless jokes and anec
dotes that are comments on
the conditions of life and the
aspirations of the people of the
Soviet Union.

As an example, Draitser cited
a story that ostensibly attacked
alcoholism, an object of offi
cially approved ridicule be
cause of its wide-spread pre
sence in the Soviet Union.
Our drunken hero, unsuc
cessful in attempts to flag
down a number of taxis that
passed him as he weaved his
way home, noticed in the dis
tance a fellow-drunk, also with
his arm extended, trying to
stop a taxi.
Feeling solidarity with a fel
low drunk, our hero, after a
great deal of struggle, man
aged to drag his comrade
home, only to find that he had

instead helped a statue off its
pedestal and into his apart
ment. The second "drunk"
was, Draitser explained, a satir
ical reference to the innumer
able statues of Lenin, all in the
same pose, found everywhere
in the Soviet Union.
"Lenin, it turns out, is no
longer pointing the way to
communism, but is trying to
hail a taxi," Draitser added.
Aside from such Uncle
Remus stories, "true satire
exists in the Soviet Union only
underground, where it is free
and unrestricted.
"It is as satire should be,"
Draitser said. Underground sa
tire often takes the form of
"anecdotes, sharp, uncom
promising, often vulgar, and
always directly to the mark.
"In the last two decades, un
derground satire has
bloomed," Draitser said, in
large part "because of the
slight loosening of the regime,
and mass disenchantment,
scepticism and lack of faith in
the government."
Jokes evolve out of official
slogans and pronouncements

"since actual life is so different
from official propaganda," ac
cording to Draitser. Such offi
cial slogans as "Hail the
worker, down with the
shirker" offer natural targets
for satire. Shortages of goods
and bureaucratic ineptness,
impossible to satirize officially,
provide targets for sharp witti
cisms.
Shots are also taken at party
officials and constant meetings
aimed at increasing "worker
consciousness." Comrade
Bugarov, for example, is ques
tioning workers at a certain fac
tory who have abysmally low
levels of political awareness.
Who's who
"You, Comrade Glinskii, tell
me who comrade Brezhnev
is," Bugarov demands. Glinskii
only shrugs his shoulders, not
knowing the answer. Bugarov
glowers with rage, and points
at Petrov, demanding to know
who Comrade Kosygin is.
Again, the same result.
Bugarov shouts "You should
come to more meetings. If you
came to more meetings you
would know who these true
friends of the working class
and the Soviet people are."
From the back of the room, a
half-intoxicated voice slurred
"Who is Comrade Ivanov?"
After some silence, Bugarov
says"I don't know, who's
Comrade Ivanov?" to which he
hears the reply "If you
wouldn't come to so many
goddamned meetings you'd
know who's sleepingwith your
wife."
Draitser has had first-hand
experience of the pitfalls that
often await Soviet satirists. He
was prevented from publishing
satire for two years after he had
a review in the humor
magazine "Krokodil" that
ridiculed a play written by the
editor of the influential Soviet
magazine "Teatr" (Theatre).
This prohibition, he said,
"was a major strike" in a series
of incidents that led him to
emigrate in 1974. He spent his
time before emigrating collect
ing hundreds of anecdotes that
have recently been published
in a book entitled "Forbidden
Laughter."
