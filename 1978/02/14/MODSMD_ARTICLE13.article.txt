### Paulette Truman 
The role of the women's college is to chal
lenge women and to overcome the overwhelm
ing bias that still exists, according to Barbara
White, president of Mills College, a private wo
men's school in Oakland.
"People's ideas and expectations do not
change overnight and there still is an over
whelming bias in our society that somebody
who was born male matters more than someone
born female and that's what women's colleges
exist in part to overcome," White said in a
speech last Monday held at the Center for Edu
cational Research.
Her speech was entitled "Educating Women
in the '80s."
"Sometimes people say a college for women
is more protective and I say I think in many ways
it's more challenging and also more re
enforcing," she said.
There will be far greater opportunities for
women in the '80s, White predicted.
"There are, and will be, greater pressures
upon women in part because of these oppor
tunities," she said.
Among her predictions for education were
the higher costs of obtaining a college degree,
especially in a private school such as Mills Col

lege. Currently, the tuition and living expenses
for one year at Mills is $5550.
"The claim to existence for a private institu
tion is quality and excellence, and quality takes
money," White said.
There will be more opportunities for the stu
dent to finance his or her education through
work in the '80s, she said. Many more students
will stop out of college for a year to work, and
education will be more flexible in how long it
takes to earn a degree.
"I think you study better if you've been out
working. It enhances you r appreciation for what
you're learning. It may even change your ideas
about what you want to major in, about what
you want to do with your life," White said.
White said there will be a trend toward con
sumerism in education because there will be
fewer students due to the smaller population of
the '80s. This will cause increasing competition
between colleges, according to White.
"Private colleges will have to be outstanding
and very competitive in order to survive," she
said.
White, a former U.S. Ambassador to the Un
ited Nations, has been president of Mills Col
lege for Vh years.
