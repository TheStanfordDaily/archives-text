# 'Cod is not down on sex'

Can sexual relations be equated with the tuba
section in a symphony orchestra? Does the Bible
contain a book which some consider X rated?
Can God be described as the benevolent owner
of an orange grove?
All three answers are "yes," according to
Dave Jones, associate pastor of the Los Gatos
Christian Church.
Jones spoke to about 50 persons in Rinconada
lounge Wednesday on "Cod is not Down on
Sex."
Jones, also a marriage counselor, opened his
talk by pointing out that Cod, the creator of sex,
intends it to be used for a distinct purpose. He
added that God's view includes sex as a "pic
ture," a "pleasure" and a "partnership."
Expression of love
The first of sex's purposes, Jones said, is to
create "a picture of the highest physical expres
sion of mutually committed love." He said one
of the greatest misconceptions he has encoun
tered as a marriage counselor is the notion that
love is just a feeling or emotion.
"Love is a commitment, a choice, an action â€”
feelings will come later," he maintained.
According to Jones, God's second purpose
for sex is as the means for a mutually committed
couple to experience pleasure. He added that
the Bible specifically commands a married
couple to "meet each other's needs."
He also explained that the Song of Solomon in
the Old Testament is a description of the joy of
sexual love in marriage.

Jones expressed Cod's third purpose for sex
as a "partnership in the creation of new life." He
said a child should be considered a gift rather
than an accident, the result of the fulfillment of
marital love as expressed in the sex act.
A child should be raised with the same love
with which it was conceived, he added.
Jones confronted one commonly-used ex
cuse for sex: "if God gave me the equipment,
why shouldn't I use it?" Jones used a police
revolver to illustrate his answer, explaining that
the revolver, like the sex organ, is entrusted to
its owner to be used in accordance with certain
guidelines and not indiscriminately.
Getting married, (ones said, is like tuning an
orchestra, with the tubas as the sexual aspect. If
the conductor tunes the tubas first, their sound
will inhibit tuning the other instruments. This
will cause either a dissonant orchestra or a bor
ing solo performance by the tubas.
If the conductor tunes the softer instruments
first, however, beautiful music will result, he
said.
Jones used a quotation from the Bible as a
guide for both expressing premarital love and
preparing for a permanent love relationship:
"Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or
boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does
not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or
resentful . . . Love bears all things, believes all
things, hopes all things, endures all things."
In addition to the Bible, Jones cited for evi
dence his experiences in counseling over 1000
couples, as well as his own marriage.
