# Exchange student observes S. African people, culture

no where to go; South Af
rica is as much their home as
the members of the Bantu
tribes. (The Bantu migrated
into south Africa from the
north at about the same
time as the Cape Colony
was begun by the Dutch.)
The religion of the Af
rikaaner is Dutch Reformed,
which is inherently racist.
Their children go to Afri

Minority
The English-speaking
white minority is stereotyp
ically more liberal than the
Afrikaaners. Their children
go to separate schools, and
there is little cultural or so
cial contact between the
two dominant white
groups.

(Claire spent a year as a
foreign exchange student
living with a family near
Johannesburg, South Af
rica.)
South Africa has several
cultures existing in one
area, but each misun
derstands and fears the
others. The government
policy of separate develop
ment, the vogue term for
"apartheid" in South Africa,
extends to every culture.
Besides separating the 11
tribes of "Bantu" and giving
each its own homeland, the
government also separately
classifies a group of people
known as the "Coloreds"
(people of mixed racial ori
gin), the Indians and people
of Asian ancestry. However,
some wealthy Asians man
age to be classified as hon
orary "whites" if they have
enough money.
The "Europeans" are also
a very divided group. The
majority are Afrikaaners,
from which the government
gets most of its support.
Their culture is uniquely
South African.
If they are forced out of
South Africa they will have

Because I was American, I
was acceptable to both Afri
kaans-and English-speaking
young people, and I found a
great deal of prejudice and
hostility in each group to
wards the other.
Most whites that I talked

to in the Johannesburg area
were against separate de
velopment. They were also
understandably wary of an
overnight change to a com
plete democracy, as the
preponderance of Bantu
still live a tribal life.
The Whites' overwhelm
ing opinion was that the
government should have
begun to educate the Bantu
30 years ago. Instead, the
government was deter
mined to keep a source of
cheap labor.
Catholic school
I attended a private
Catholic school with my two
South African sisters.
Catholic schools are the
only integrated schools in
the country, and there were

three Asians and an Indian
in my class of 20.
The Catholic schools are
tacitly ignored by the gov
ernment; it gives them a
place to send the children of
black ambassadors who still
visit South Africa.

Visiting an Afrikaans
school where government
ideology is imposed made
me appreciate the freedom
of the Catholic school.
I also attended a
German-speaking high
school for a day. The recent
immigrants from Europe
have formed tight com
munities, often keeping
their language and culture
intact into the third and
fourth generation. There
were also French schools
and a Japanese school
within a few miles of my
home.
Soweto
I went to Soweto twice,
legally, on a tour bus. I was
shown the homes of two
"Bantu millionaires," and a
beautiful public swimming
pool with no one in it.
People on the street would
stare back silently at the row
of white faces in the bus
windows. One man ran out
of his home, after the bus,
mimicking the motions of
taking a photograph.
My South African family
had never seen Soweto;
they had no cause to go
there. They were against the
government's policies, and
thought of themselves as

liberal. I asked them once
why they had a servant. My
South African mother grew
very indignant, reminding
me that "the girl" wouldn't
have a job at all if she hadn't
employed her.
Most whites, after hear
ing my accent, would im-

mediately want to discuss
politics. Those who advo
cated separate develop
ment were in a minority.
Their arguments seemed
almost noble on the sur
face; why, they would ask,
should the Bantu give up
their way of life? Why must
they leave their culture to
be a part of the white cul
ture?
Facts
Their arguments avoided
two facts: the Bantu popula
tion has grown too large,
and the soil too poor, for
them to maintain their tribal
way of life; and the "white
culture" in South Africa had
been built upon the acces
sibility and perpetuation of
a cheap labor force.

Because I went to South
Africa as a guest, I was
treated with anxious hospi
tality. White South Africans
would try to explain their
country to me, and would
ask me to explain, when I
returned, that not all whites
were racists.

They showed me a coun
try halfway through the im
plementation of a policy
that most people don't
want; torn internally by
economic, cultural, and so
cial barriers.
They took away my sense
of moral superiority with
pointed questions about
the busing situation in Bos
ton in 1975, and by quietly
reminding me of the way
whole tribes of Indians were
slaughtered in this coun
try's history.
Corruption
They would point to the
corruption in some nations
in Northern Africa, and to
the brutal terrorism blacks
would inflict on blacks of
other tribes. They pointed

out that "their Bantu" have
the highest standard of liv
ing of blacks on the conti
nent.
Many white South Afri
cans I met predicted a
bloody revolution within
the next five years, and the
rise of one dominant tribe
which would gain control of
the military. Others were
quietly preparing to leave
their country.

Most whites that I talked

were against separate de

still live a tribal life.
The Whites' overwhelm
ing opinion was that the
government should have

30 years ago. Instead, the

Catholic school
I attended a private
Catholic school with my two
South African sisters.
Catholic schools are the
only integrated schools in
the country, and there were

three Asians and an Indian
in my class of 20.
The Catholic schools are
tacitly ignored by the gov
ernment; it gives them a
place to send the children of
black ambassadors who still
visit South Africa.

Visiting an Afrikaans
school where government
ideology is imposed made
me appreciate the freedom
of the Catholic school.
I also attended a
German-speaking high
school for a day. The recent
immigrants from Europe
have formed tight com
munities, often keeping
their language and culture
intact into the third and
fourth generation. There
were also French schools
and a Japanese school
within a few miles of my
home.
Soweto
I went to Soweto twice,
legally, on a tour bus. I was
shown the homes of two
"Bantu millionaires," and a
beautiful public swimming
pool with no one in it.
People on the street would
stare back silently at the row
of white faces in the bus
windows. One man ran out
of his home, after the bus,
mimicking the motions of
taking a photograph.
My South African family
had never seen Soweto;
they had no cause to go
there. They were against the
government's policies, and
thought of themselves as

liberal. I asked them once
why they had a servant. My
South African mother grew
very indignant, reminding
me that "the girl" wouldn't
have a job at all if she hadn't
employed her.
Most whites, after hear
ing my accent, would im-

mediately want to discuss
politics. Those who advo
cated separate develop
ment were in a minority.
Their arguments seemed
almost noble on the sur
face; why, they would ask,
should the Bantu give up
their way of life? Why must
they leave their culture to
be a part of the white cul
ture?
Facts
Their arguments avoided
two facts: the Bantu popula
tion has grown too large,
and the soil too poor, for
them to maintain their tribal
way of life; and the "white
culture" in South Africa had
been built upon the acces
sibility and perpetuation of
a cheap labor force.

Because I went to South
Africa as a guest, I was
treated with anxious hospi
tality. White South Africans
would try to explain their
country to me, and would
ask me to explain, when I
returned, that not all whites
were racists.

They showed me a coun
try halfway through the im
plementation of a policy
that most people don't
want; torn internally by
economic, cultural, and so
cial barriers.
They took away my sense
of moral superiority with
pointed questions about
the busing situation in Bos
ton in 1975, and by quietly
reminding me of the way
whole tribes of Indians were
slaughtered in this coun
try's history.
Corruption
They would point to the
corruption in some nations
in Northern Africa, and to
the brutal terrorism blacks
would inflict on blacks of
other tribes. They pointed

out that "their Bantu" have
the highest standard of liv
ing of blacks on the conti
nent.
Many white South Afri
cans I met predicted a
bloody revolution within
the next five years, and the
rise of one dominant tribe
which would gain control of
the military. Others were
quietly preparing to leave
their country.

me appreciate the freedom
of the Catholic school.
I also attended a
German-speaking high
school for a day. The recent
immigrants from Europe
have formed tight com
munities, often keeping
their language and culture
intact into the third and
fourth generation. There
were also French schools
and a Japanese school
within a few miles of my
home.
Soweto
I went to Soweto twice,
legally, on a tour bus. I was
shown the homes of two
"Bantu millionaires," and a
beautiful public swimming
pool with no one in it.
People on the street would
stare back silently at the row
of white faces in the bus
windows. One man ran out
of his home, after the bus,
mimicking the motions of
taking a photograph.
My South African family
had never seen Soweto;
they had no cause to go
there. They were against the
government's policies, and
thought of themselves as

liberal. I asked them once
why they had a servant. My
South African mother grew
very indignant, reminding
me that "the girl" wouldn't
have a job at all if she hadn't
employed her.
Most whites, after hear
ing my accent, would im-

mediately want to discuss
politics. Those who advo
cated separate develop
ment were in a minority.
Their arguments seemed
almost noble on the sur
face; why, they would ask,
should the Bantu give up
their way of life? Why must
they leave their culture to
be a part of the white cul
ture?
Facts
Their arguments avoided
two facts: the Bantu popula
tion has grown too large,
and the soil too poor, for
them to maintain their tribal
way of life; and the "white
culture" in South Africa had
been built upon the acces
sibility and perpetuation of
a cheap labor force.

Because I went to South
Africa as a guest, I was
treated with anxious hospi
tality. White South Africans
would try to explain their
country to me, and would
ask me to explain, when I
returned, that not all whites
were racists.

They showed me a coun
try halfway through the im
plementation of a policy
that most people don't
want; torn internally by
economic, cultural, and so
cial barriers.
They took away my sense
of moral superiority with
pointed questions about
the busing situation in Bos
ton in 1975, and by quietly
reminding me of the way
whole tribes of Indians were
slaughtered in this coun
try's history.
Corruption
They would point to the
corruption in some nations
in Northern Africa, and to
the brutal terrorism blacks
would inflict on blacks of
other tribes. They pointed

out that "their Bantu" have
the highest standard of liv
ing of blacks on the conti
nent.
Many white South Afri
cans I met predicted a
bloody revolution within
the next five years, and the
rise of one dominant tribe
which would gain control of
the military. Others were
quietly preparing to leave
their country.

no where to go; South Af
rica is as much their home as
the members of the Bantu
tribes. (The Bantu migrated
into south Africa from the
north at about the same
time as the Cape Colony
was begun by the Dutch.)
The religion of the Af
rikaaner is Dutch Reformed,
which is inherently racist.
Their children go to Afri
kaans government schools.
Minority
The English-speaking
white minority is stereotyp
ically more liberal than the
Afrikaaners. Their children
go to separate schools, and
there is little cultural or so
cial contact between the
two dominant white
groups.

(Claire spent a year as a
foreign exchange student
living with a family near
Johannesburg, South Af
rica.)
South Africa has several
cultures existing in one
area, but each misun
derstands and fears the
others. The government
policy of separate develop
ment, the vogue term for
"apartheid" in South Africa,
extends to every culture.
Besides separating the 11
tribes of "Bantu" and giving
each its own homeland, the
government also separately
classifies a group of people
known as the "Coloreds"
(people of mixed racial ori
gin), the Indians and people
of Asian ancestry. However,
some wealthy Asians man
age to be classified as hon
orary "whites" if they have
enough money.
The "Europeans" are also
a very divided group. The
majority are Afrikaaners,
from which the government
gets most of its support.
Their culture is uniquely
South African.
If they are forced out of
South Africa they will have

Because I was American, I
was acceptable to both Afri
kaans-and English-speaking
young people, and I found a
great deal of prejudice and
hostility in each group to
wards the other.
Most whites that I talked

to in the Johannesburg area
were against separate de
velopment. They were also
understandably wary of an
overnight change to a com
plete democracy, as the
preponderance of Bantu
still live a tribal life.
The Whites' overwhelm
ing opinion was that the
government should have
begun to educate the Bantu
30 years ago. Instead, the
government was deter
mined to keep a source of
cheap labor.
Catholic school
I attended a private
Catholic school with my two
South African sisters.
Catholic schools are the
only integrated schools in
the country, and there were

three Asians and an Indian
in my class of 20.
The Catholic schools are
tacitly ignored by the gov
ernment; it gives them a
place to send the children of
black ambassadors who still
visit South Africa.

school where government
ideology is imposed made
me appreciate the freedom
of the Catholic school.
