# Food service hashers reveal trials, tribulations
## 
### Susan Larsen 
For third-year hasher Scott
Laurence, "Hashing is hilari
ous; it's a great break because
you don't have to think — it's
totally mindless work." Other
hashers really dislike the
monotony of the job, while
others, like freshman Kevin Ew
ing, look on it as a challenge
"to see what I can do to liven
things up."
Hashers have very different
opinions of their job, depend
ing on where they work —
whether in a dorm or a Row
House — and what they do —
whether they check meal
cards, serve food, scoop ice
cream, replenish the salad ta
bles, work in the dishroom, or
any combination of the above.
In general, hashers most
enjoy their job because of the
people they meet. "Hashing is
a great job for a freshman,"
commented freshman Lydia
Matkovich, "because you meet
a lot more people than most
other freshmen in your dorm."
However, Row House
hashers, who serve only 30-50
people each meal, enjoy work
ing outside their own house or
dorm. (Row Houses usually

employ hashers from other re
sidences due to Food Service
policy). Sophomore Bill New-
Comb, who lives in Hurlburt
House and hashes in Grove
House, remarked that "the
people there have become my
friends — we (the Grove
hashers)have an open invita
tion to all their parties."
Favorite job
For most hashers, serving is
their favorite job "because you
get to see people and some
times you can surprise them by
being really nice," as freshman
Jim Moore commented.
Similarly, Ewing enjoys serv
ing ice cream and "doing out
of-the-ordinary things just to
see people's reactions. I always
used to imitate W.C. Fields or
Walter Brennan," he
explained, "and sometimes I'd
put on an English or a Southern
accent just for fun."
"Most people just serve the
food, but I try to have fun,"
said freshman Joz Gilbert. "If
the lima beans are going really

slow, I try to push the lima
beans."
Serving
Serving is not always fun,
however, and many hashers
share the feeling of Moore,
who said, "Sometimes people
treat hashers like we're real
waiters and waitresses, which
we're not — we're just people,
not servants."
Hashers say they know little
more about the food than any
one else; although one head
hasher commented that "after
a while you learn what to eat
and what not to eat. A lot of
times you'll see people follow
hashers through the line and
take almost exactly what the
hashers do."
Nauseating
Another hasher stated,
"Sometimes serving food for
two hours makes you not hun
gry for it. I see it sitting there in
the pan, and then I see it get
dumped in the dishroom, and
it's kind of nauseating."
"The dishroom is the low job

on the totem pole," explained
Moore, who spends eight to 10
hours a week in the Flo Mo dish
room. "It's not funny, the
dishroom is depressing — you
think too much back there
about things like why do I have
this job, what's the meaning of
life, et cetera.'
Dishroom
"The dishroom is really gross
— your shoes and hands get
covered with spaghetti sauce,
jello, pudding, salad dressing
and gravy. Sometimes it squirts
up in your face and that's really
gross," said Moore.
"The dishroom always
stinks, too," continued
Moore, "and it's usually in
credibly hot. Sometimes it gets
up to 190 degrees around the
dishwasher, and the dishes can
burn your fingers as you take
them out."
The one "semi-advantage"
of working in the dishroom is
that "in the dishroom no one
sees or hears you, and you can
scream, holler, and throw stuff

at each other like rolls or some
times knockwurst sausages,"
explained Ewing.
Boredom
For Joz Gilbert, however, the
dishroom can be boring be*
cause "you see the same dis
hes every day; sometimes the
same tray will come through
two or three times a shift — you
can tell because people have
written things on them.''
"I have fun doing spur-of
the-moment things with the
people I work with," said Ew
ing. "One time before Christ
mas we mado up songs in the
dishrooom to the tune of
'jingle Bells' and 'White
Christmas.' We had a great
time singing them to all the
people in the dining rooms.
"One started out like Bus
your trays, bus your trays/ Bus
them all the way . . . and the
other was I'm dreaming of a
clean dishroom. . . "
Stories
Dishroom workers are not
the only hashers with funny
stories to tell, however. Ac
cording to junior Scott Laur
ence, the checker is the one
who has to deal with "faculty
guests who don't speak En
glish" and "missing milk
machines and salad bowls"
which enterprising dorm resi
dents have hidden across the
hall oron third floor balconies.
Most hashers felt they really
got along well with their co
workers. Many felt as Moore
did, that "the cooks and pot
washeis are really great; and
it's nice to get to know people
who live outside the Stanford
complex."

Few dorm hashers agreed
with Storey House hasher Lonn
Johnston's statement that,
"The biggest difference bet
ween Row hashing and dorm
hashing is that you don't have
any supervisor playing a con
centration camp type role,
making sure you do things
exactly right. We're just four
people working together with
the cook.
"Some people make our
supervisors out to be ogres,"
commented Moore, "but
they're really nice and great to
work for."
Row Houses
However, hashing in the Row
Houses is very different from
hashing in dorms like Stern or
Wilbur. Few dorm hashers
would say, as Johnston did,
that "I actually look forward to
going to work."
Grove House hasher Bill
Newcomb also likes his job and
sees little wrong with it.
The biggest difference bet
ween the two types of hashing
is the difference in size, ac
cording to Row House hashers.
"The food services seem a lot
more institutionalized at larger
places," commented
Johnston. "It's a lot more fun
to work in a smaller, more
pleasant place, without the
sterile, antiseptic atmosphere
of the bigger dorms.
One cook
Most Row houses only have
one cook and some wash all
their dishes by hand. Accord
ing to Newcomb the Grove
House kitchen is "so small and
compressed that two hashers

sometimes have a problem
moving past each other."
Row House hashing avoids
many disadvantages of regular
dorm hashing. "It's not dull or
boring because we all do a lot
of different jobs — serve,
wash, help the cook — not just
one like in a larger dorm."
Also, Row Houses serve no
Friday or Saturday meals, and
hashers only work every other
Sunday brunch, while most
dorm hashers have only one
day off.
Storey House
However, Row House
hashers "don't see a whole lot
of bizarre behavior," accord
ing to Johnston. Storey House
is an all female house, and the
hashers there are all men, "but
there's nothing romantic going
on; we don't have any re
ndezvous after work or any
thing," said Johnston. "I think
the girls get a kick out of being
served by guys, but that's
about it."
Both dorm and Row House
hashers agreed with Johnston,
however, that "hashing would
be a terrible job if I didn't get
along so well with the people I
work with."
In spite of this
"camaraderie," most hashers
would "rather be other places"
or "doing something more in
tellectually stimulating."
Once I figured out that I was
paying $2.50 an hour just for
the privilege of being here at
Stanford, and then I'm getting
paid $2.80 an hour to work in
the dishroom. That's a net gain
of 30 cents an hour," remarked
Fred Burke.

people in the dining rooms.
"One started out like Bus
your trays, bus your trays/ Bus
them all the way . . . and the
other was I'm dreaming of a
clean dishroom. . . "
Stories
Dishroom workers are not
the only hashers with funny
stories to tell, however. Ac
cording to junior Scott Laur
ence, the checker is the one
who has to deal with "faculty
guests who don't speak En
glish" and "missing milk
machines and salad bowls"
which enterprising dorm resi
dents have hidden across the
hall oron third floor balconies.
Most hashers felt they really
got along well with their co
workers. Many felt as Moore
did, that "the cooks and pot
washeis are really great; and
it's nice to get to know people
who live outside the Stanford
complex."

Few dorm hashers agreed
with Storey House hasher Lonn
Johnston's statement that,
"The biggest difference bet
ween Row hashing and dorm
hashing is that you don't have
any supervisor playing a con
centration camp type role,
making sure you do things
exactly right. We're just four
people working together with
the cook.
"Some people make our
supervisors out to be ogres,"
commented Moore, "but
they're really nice and great to
work for."
Row Houses
However, hashing in the Row
Houses is very different from
hashing in dorms like Stern or
Wilbur. Few dorm hashers
would say, as Johnston did,
that "I actually look forward to
going to work."
Grove House hasher Bill
Newcomb also likes his job and
sees little wrong with it.
The biggest difference bet
ween the two types of hashing
is the difference in size, ac
cording to Row House hashers.
"The food services seem a lot
more institutionalized at larger
places," commented
Johnston. "It's a lot more fun
to work in a smaller, more
pleasant place, without the
sterile, antiseptic atmosphere
of the bigger dorms.
One cook
Most Row houses only have
one cook and some wash all
their dishes by hand. Accord
ing to Newcomb the Grove
House kitchen is "so small and
compressed that two hashers

sometimes have a problem
moving past each other."
Row House hashing avoids
many disadvantages of regular
dorm hashing. "It's not dull or
boring because we all do a lot
of different jobs — serve,
wash, help the cook — not just
one like in a larger dorm."
Also, Row Houses serve no
Friday or Saturday meals, and
hashers only work every other
Sunday brunch, while most
dorm hashers have only one
day off.
Storey House
However, Row House
hashers "don't see a whole lot
of bizarre behavior," accord
ing to Johnston. Storey House
is an all female house, and the
hashers there are all men, "but
there's nothing romantic going
on; we don't have any re
ndezvous after work or any
thing," said Johnston. "I think
the girls get a kick out of being
served by guys, but that's
about it."
Both dorm and Row House
hashers agreed with Johnston,
however, that "hashing would
be a terrible job if I didn't get
along so well with the people I
work with."
In spite of this
"camaraderie," most hashers
would "rather be other places"
or "doing something more in
tellectually stimulating."
Once I figured out that I was
paying $2.50 an hour just for
the privilege of being here at
Stanford, and then I'm getting
paid $2.80 an hour to work in
the dishroom. That's a net gain
of 30 cents an hour," remarked
Fred Burke.

While dishroom workers al dorm food services complain about the heat and smell of the automatic
dishwashers, hashers at Row houses have to wash the dishes by hand.
For third-year hasher Scott
Laurence, "Hashing is hilari
ous; it's a great break because
you don't have to think — it's
totally mindless work." Other
hashers really dislike the
monotony of the job, while
others, like freshman Kevin Ew
ing, look on it as a challenge
"to see what I can do to liven
things up."
Hashers have very different
opinions of their job, depend
ing on where they work —
whether in a dorm or a Row
House — and what they do —
whether they check meal
cards, serve food, scoop ice
cream, replenish the salad ta
bles, work in the dishroom, or
any combination of the above.
In general, hashers most
enjoy their job because of the
people they meet. "Hashing is
a great job for a freshman,"
commented freshman Lydia
Matkovich, "because you meet
a lot more people than most
other freshmen in your dorm."
However, Row House
hashers, who serve only 30-50
people each meal, enjoy work
ing outside their own house or
dorm. (Row Houses usually

employ hashers from other re
sidences due to Food Service
policy). Sophomore Bill New-
Comb, who lives in Hurlburt
House and hashes in Grove
House, remarked that "the
people there have become my
friends — we (the Grove
hashers)have an open invita
tion to all their parties."
Favorite job
For most hashers, serving is
their favorite job "because you
get to see people and some
times you can surprise them by
being really nice," as freshman
Jim Moore commented.
Similarly, Ewing enjoys serv
ing ice cream and "doing out
of-the-ordinary things just to
see people's reactions. I always
used to imitate W.C. Fields or
Walter Brennan," he
explained, "and sometimes I'd
put on an English or a Southern
accent just for fun."
"Most people just serve the
food, but I try to have fun,"
said freshman Joz Gilbert. "If
the lima beans are going really

slow, I try to push the lima
beans."
Serving
Serving is not always fun,
however, and many hashers
share the feeling of Moore,
who said, "Sometimes people
treat hashers like we're real
waiters and waitresses, which
we're not — we're just people,
not servants."
Hashers say they know little
more about the food than any
one else; although one head
hasher commented that "after
a while you learn what to eat
and what not to eat. A lot of
times you'll see people follow
hashers through the line and
take almost exactly what the
hashers do."
Nauseating
Another hasher stated,
"Sometimes serving food for
two hours makes you not hun
gry for it. I see it sitting there in
the pan, and then I see it get
dumped in the dishroom, and
it's kind of nauseating."
"The dishroom is the low job

on the totem pole," explained
Moore, who spends eight to 10
hours a week in the Flo Mo dish
room. "It's not funny, the
dishroom is depressing — you
think too much back there
about things like why do I have
this job, what's the meaning of
life, et cetera.'
Dishroom
"The dishroom is really gross
— your shoes and hands get
covered with spaghetti sauce,
jello, pudding, salad dressing
and gravy. Sometimes it squirts
up in your face and that's really
gross," said Moore.
"The dishroom always
stinks, too," continued
Moore, "and it's usually in
credibly hot. Sometimes it gets
up to 190 degrees around the
dishwasher, and the dishes can
burn your fingers as you take
them out."
The one "semi-advantage"
of working in the dishroom is
that "in the dishroom no one
sees or hears you, and you can
scream, holler, and throw stuff

at each other like rolls or some
times knockwurst sausages,"
explained Ewing.
Boredom
For Joz Gilbert, however, the
dishroom can be boring be*
cause "you see the same dis
hes every day; sometimes the
same tray will come through
two or three times a shift — you
can tell because people have
written things on them.''
"I have fun doing spur-of
the-moment things with the
people I work with," said Ew
ing. "One time before Christ
mas we mado up songs in the
dishrooom to the tune of
'jingle Bells' and 'White
Christmas.' We had a great
time singing them to all the
people in the dining rooms.
"One started out like Bus

House — and what they do —
whether they check meal
cards, serve food, scoop ice
cream, replenish the salad ta
bles, work in the dishroom, or
any combination of the above.
In general, hashers most
enjoy their job because of the
people they meet. "Hashing is
a great job for a freshman,"
commented freshman Lydia
Matkovich, "because you meet
a lot more people than most
other freshmen in your dorm."
However, Row House
hashers, who serve only 30-50
people each meal, enjoy work
ing outside their own house or
dorm. (Row Houses usually

employ hashers from other re
sidences due to Food Service
policy). Sophomore Bill New-
Comb, who lives in Hurlburt
House and hashes in Grove
House, remarked that "the
people there have become my
friends — we (the Grove
hashers)have an open invita
tion to all their parties."
Favorite job
For most hashers, serving is
their favorite job "because you
get to see people and some
times you can surprise them by
being really nice," as freshman
Jim Moore commented.
Similarly, Ewing enjoys serv
ing ice cream and "doing out
of-the-ordinary things just to
see people's reactions. I always
used to imitate W.C. Fields or
Walter Brennan," he
explained, "and sometimes I'd
put on an English or a Southern
accent just for fun."
"Most people just serve the
food, but I try to have fun,"
said freshman Joz Gilbert. "If
the lima beans are going really

slow, I try to push the lima
beans."
Serving
Serving is not always fun,
however, and many hashers
share the feeling of Moore,
who said, "Sometimes people
treat hashers like we're real
waiters and waitresses, which
we're not — we're just people,
not servants."
Hashers say they know little
more about the food than any
one else; although one head
hasher commented that "after
a while you learn what to eat
and what not to eat. A lot of
times you'll see people follow
hashers through the line and
take almost exactly what the
hashers do."
Nauseating
Another hasher stated,
"Sometimes serving food for
two hours makes you not hun
gry for it. I see it sitting there in
the pan, and then I see it get
dumped in the dishroom, and
it's kind of nauseating."
"The dishroom is the low job

on the totem pole," explained
Moore, who spends eight to 10
hours a week in the Flo Mo dish
room. "It's not funny, the
dishroom is depressing — you
think too much back there
about things like why do I have
this job, what's the meaning of
life, et cetera.'
Dishroom
"The dishroom is really gross
— your shoes and hands get
covered with spaghetti sauce,
jello, pudding, salad dressing
and gravy. Sometimes it squirts
up in your face and that's really
gross," said Moore.
"The dishroom always
stinks, too," continued
Moore, "and it's usually in
credibly hot. Sometimes it gets
up to 190 degrees around the
dishwasher, and the dishes can
burn your fingers as you take
them out."
The one "semi-advantage"
of working in the dishroom is
that "in the dishroom no one
sees or hears you, and you can
scream, holler, and throw stuff

at each other like rolls or some
times knockwurst sausages,"
explained Ewing.
Boredom
For Joz Gilbert, however, the
dishroom can be boring be*
cause "you see the same dis
hes every day; sometimes the
same tray will come through
two or three times a shift — you
can tell because people have
written things on them.''
"I have fun doing spur-of
the-moment things with the
people I work with," said Ew
ing. "One time before Christ
mas we mado up songs in the
dishrooom to the tune of
'jingle Bells' and 'White
Christmas.' We had a great
time singing them to all the
people in the dining rooms.
"One started out like Bus
your trays, bus your trays/ Bus
them all the way . . . and the
other was I'm dreaming of a
clean dishroom. . . "
Stories
Dishroom workers are not
the only hashers with funny
stories to tell, however. Ac
cording to junior Scott Laur
ence, the checker is the one
who has to deal with "faculty
guests who don't speak En
glish" and "missing milk
machines and salad bowls"
which enterprising dorm resi
dents have hidden across the
hall oron third floor balconies.
Most hashers felt they really
got along well with their co
workers. Many felt as Moore
did, that "the cooks and pot
washeis are really great; and
it's nice to get to know people
who live outside the Stanford
complex."

Few dorm hashers agreed
with Storey House hasher Lonn
Johnston's statement that,
"The biggest difference bet
ween Row hashing and dorm
hashing is that you don't have
any supervisor playing a con
centration camp type role,
making sure you do things
exactly right. We're just four
people working together with
the cook.
"Some people make our
supervisors out to be ogres,"
commented Moore, "but
they're really nice and great to
work for."
Row Houses
However, hashing in the Row
Houses is very different from
hashing in dorms like Stern or
Wilbur. Few dorm hashers
would say, as Johnston did,
that "I actually look forward to
going to work."
Grove House hasher Bill
Newcomb also likes his job and
sees little wrong with it.
The biggest difference bet
ween the two types of hashing
is the difference in size, ac
cording to Row House hashers.
"The food services seem a lot
more institutionalized at larger
places," commented
Johnston. "It's a lot more fun
to work in a smaller, more
pleasant place, without the
sterile, antiseptic atmosphere
of the bigger dorms.
One cook
Most Row houses only have
one cook and some wash all
their dishes by hand. Accord
ing to Newcomb the Grove
House kitchen is "so small and
compressed that two hashers

sometimes have a problem
moving past each other."
Row House hashing avoids
many disadvantages of regular
dorm hashing. "It's not dull or
boring because we all do a lot
of different jobs — serve,
wash, help the cook — not just
one like in a larger dorm."
Also, Row Houses serve no
Friday or Saturday meals, and
hashers only work every other
Sunday brunch, while most
dorm hashers have only one
day off.
Storey House
However, Row House
hashers "don't see a whole lot
of bizarre behavior," accord
ing to Johnston. Storey House
is an all female house, and the
hashers there are all men, "but
there's nothing romantic going
on; we don't have any re
ndezvous after work or any
thing," said Johnston. "I think
the girls get a kick out of being
served by guys, but that's
about it."
Both dorm and Row House
hashers agreed with Johnston,
however, that "hashing would
be a terrible job if I didn't get
along so well with the people I
work with."
In spite of this
"camaraderie," most hashers
would "rather be other places"
or "doing something more in
tellectually stimulating."
Once I figured out that I was
paying $2.50 an hour just for
the privilege of being here at
Stanford, and then I'm getting
paid $2.80 an hour to work in
the dishroom. That's a net gain
of 30 cents an hour," remarked
Fred Burke.

dents have hidden across the
hall oron third floor balconies.
Most hashers felt they really
got along well with their co
workers. Many felt as Moore
did, that "the cooks and pot
washeis are really great; and
it's nice to get to know people
who live outside the Stanford
complex."

Few dorm hashers agreed
with Storey House hasher Lonn
Johnston's statement that,
"The biggest difference bet
ween Row hashing and dorm
hashing is that you don't have
any supervisor playing a con
centration camp type role,
making sure you do things
exactly right. We're just four
people working together with
the cook.
"Some people make our
supervisors out to be ogres,"
commented Moore, "but
they're really nice and great to
work for."
Row Houses
However, hashing in the Row
Houses is very different from
hashing in dorms like Stern or
Wilbur. Few dorm hashers
would say, as Johnston did,
that "I actually look forward to
going to work."
Grove House hasher Bill
Newcomb also likes his job and
sees little wrong with it.
The biggest difference bet
ween the two types of hashing
is the difference in size, ac
cording to Row House hashers.
"The food services seem a lot
more institutionalized at larger
places," commented
Johnston. "It's a lot more fun
to work in a smaller, more
pleasant place, without the
sterile, antiseptic atmosphere
of the bigger dorms.
One cook
Most Row houses only have
one cook and some wash all
their dishes by hand. Accord
ing to Newcomb the Grove
House kitchen is "so small and
compressed that two hashers

sometimes have a problem
moving past each other."
Row House hashing avoids
many disadvantages of regular
dorm hashing. "It's not dull or
boring because we all do a lot
of different jobs — serve,
wash, help the cook — not just
one like in a larger dorm."
Also, Row Houses serve no
Friday or Saturday meals, and
hashers only work every other
Sunday brunch, while most
dorm hashers have only one
day off.
Storey House
However, Row House
hashers "don't see a whole lot
of bizarre behavior," accord
ing to Johnston. Storey House
is an all female house, and the
hashers there are all men, "but
there's nothing romantic going
on; we don't have any re
ndezvous after work or any
thing," said Johnston. "I think
the girls get a kick out of being
served by guys, but that's
about it."
Both dorm and Row House
hashers agreed with Johnston,
however, that "hashing would
be a terrible job if I didn't get
along so well with the people I
work with."
In spite of this
"camaraderie," most hashers
would "rather be other places"
or "doing something more in
tellectually stimulating."
Once I figured out that I was
paying $2.50 an hour just for
the privilege of being here at
Stanford, and then I'm getting
paid $2.80 an hour to work in
the dishroom. That's a net gain
of 30 cents an hour," remarked
Fred Burke.

While dishroom workers al dorm food services complain about the heat and smell of the automatic
dishwashers, hashers at Row houses have to wash the dishes by hand.
For third-year hasher Scott
Laurence, "Hashing is hilari
ous; it's a great break because
you don't have to think — it's
totally mindless work." Other
hashers really dislike the
monotony of the job, while
others, like freshman Kevin Ew
ing, look on it as a challenge
"to see what I can do to liven
things up."
Hashers have very different
opinions of their job, depend
ing on where they work —
whether in a dorm or a Row
House — and what they do —
whether they check meal
cards, serve food, scoop ice
cream, replenish the salad ta
bles, work in the dishroom, or
any combination of the above.
In general, hashers most
enjoy their job because of the
people they meet. "Hashing is
a great job for a freshman,"
commented freshman Lydia
Matkovich, "because you meet
a lot more people than most
other freshmen in your dorm."
However, Row House
hashers, who serve only 30-50
people each meal, enjoy work
ing outside their own house or
dorm. (Row Houses usually

employ hashers from other re
sidences due to Food Service
policy). Sophomore Bill New-
Comb, who lives in Hurlburt
House and hashes in Grove
House, remarked that "the
people there have become my
friends — we (the Grove
hashers)have an open invita
tion to all their parties."
Favorite job
For most hashers, serving is
their favorite job "because you
get to see people and some
times you can surprise them by
being really nice," as freshman
Jim Moore commented.
Similarly, Ewing enjoys serv
ing ice cream and "doing out
of-the-ordinary things just to
see people's reactions. I always
used to imitate W.C. Fields or
Walter Brennan," he
explained, "and sometimes I'd
put on an English or a Southern
accent just for fun."
"Most people just serve the
food, but I try to have fun,"
said freshman Joz Gilbert. "If
the lima beans are going really

slow, I try to push the lima
beans."
Serving
Serving is not always fun,
however, and many hashers
share the feeling of Moore,
who said, "Sometimes people
treat hashers like we're real
waiters and waitresses, which
we're not — we're just people,
not servants."
Hashers say they know little
more about the food than any
one else; although one head
hasher commented that "after
a while you learn what to eat
and what not to eat. A lot of
times you'll see people follow
hashers through the line and
take almost exactly what the
hashers do."
Nauseating
Another hasher stated,
"Sometimes serving food for
two hours makes you not hun
gry for it. I see it sitting there in
the pan, and then I see it get
dumped in the dishroom, and
it's kind of nauseating."
"The dishroom is the low job

on the totem pole," explained
Moore, who spends eight to 10
hours a week in the Flo Mo dish
room. "It's not funny, the
dishroom is depressing — you
think too much back there
about things like why do I have
this job, what's the meaning of
life, et cetera.'
Dishroom
"The dishroom is really gross
— your shoes and hands get
covered with spaghetti sauce,
jello, pudding, salad dressing
and gravy. Sometimes it squirts
up in your face and that's really
gross," said Moore.
"The dishroom always
stinks, too," continued
Moore, "and it's usually in
credibly hot. Sometimes it gets
up to 190 degrees around the
dishwasher, and the dishes can
burn your fingers as you take
them out."
The one "semi-advantage"
of working in the dishroom is
that "in the dishroom no one
sees or hears you, and you can
scream, holler, and throw stuff

at each other like rolls or some
times knockwurst sausages,"
explained Ewing.
Boredom
For Joz Gilbert, however, the
dishroom can be boring be*
cause "you see the same dis
hes every day; sometimes the
same tray will come through
two or three times a shift — you
can tell because people have
written things on them.''
"I have fun doing spur-of
the-moment things with the
people I work with," said Ew
ing. "One time before Christ
mas we mado up songs in the
dishrooom to the tune of
'jingle Bells' and 'White
Christmas.' We had a great
time singing them to all the
people in the dining rooms.
"One started out like Bus
your trays, bus your trays/ Bus
them all the way . . . and the
other was I'm dreaming of a
clean dishroom. . . "
Stories
Dishroom workers are not
the only hashers with funny
stories to tell, however. Ac
cording to junior Scott Laur
ence, the checker is the one
who has to deal with "faculty
guests who don't speak En
glish" and "missing milk
machines and salad bowls"
which enterprising dorm resi
dents have hidden across the
hall oron third floor balconies.
Most hashers felt they really
got along well with their co
workers. Many felt as Moore
did, that "the cooks and pot
washeis are really great; and
