# OCSC: a center in need of students
## 
### Gary Fremerman 
Lack of active student involvement
has been a major problem all year for
the Off-Campus Student Center
(OCSC), according to King Ming
Young, OCSC coordinator.
Young, who is also activities ad
viser for the Office of Student Ac
tivities (OSA), said because of the
OCSC's "low profile" in the past,
students living off-campus haven't
fully taken advantage of the center's
services.
"They need to realize this is their
organization, that it's a vehicle for
activities, a forum for complaints and
grievances, and a means for com
municating with each other," she
added.
The OCSC, located in the Old
Union clubhouse, was established
three years ago as a counterpart to
University programs for students liv
ing on campus, Young said.
"Students living off-campus, while
paying the same tuition, weren't get
ting those benefits, so it was only fair
for the University to do something
extra."
Several students made a proposal
for an off-campus student center and
the dean of student affairs funded
$1000 renewable each year, she said.
This fund is OCSC's sole source of
income, although OSA paid for a re
novation of the center last summer,
she added.
Of the approximately 5600 under
graduate and graduate students liv
ing off-campus, about 200 have
signed up to receive OCSC's new
newsletter, the Informer, Young
said.
"I guess the OCSC is a pretty new
idea and they're not used to it," she

said. "We can't succeed until stu
dents see it as an opportunity to get
involved.
"They expect too much from the
staff and budget. The initiative
should come from students living
off-campus."
OCSC staffer Marie Earl cited some
probable reasons for lack of off
campus student involvement at the
center. Graduate students usually
center their activities on their de
partments, and most off-campus
students tend to view the center
more as a service than an organiza
tion, she said.
"I wouldn't claim that all of them
need our services, but a fairly high
percentage of the off-campus popu
lation could use them," Young said.
Services offered by the center in
clude use of the lounge and lockers,
free telephone calls to San Jose, San
Francisco and the East Bay area, and
information on car pools to and from
campus, she said.
'Home base'
"Students can read, have coffee,
and use the refrigerator. It's a home
base for students off campus," she
added.
Because the OCSC had a smaller
staff and less visibility last year,
"many students didn't know it even
existed," Young said.
"But now different students are
coming to use the center. Our mail
ing list has expanded tremendously
since the news letter was sent out,"
she said.
The first issue of the Informer was
mailed to 2000 people last month,
but now only those on the mailing list
will receive it, she added.
This year is the first the center has

been well-organized, Earl said. "It's
functioning for the first time with a
regular staff and regularly-scheduled
events."
Young said she hopes the OCSC
can establish a program to receive
ticket discounts for theater and con
cert performances, possibly through
joint programs with dormitories.
The center may also co-sponsor,
with the staff of residential educa
tion, a series of workshops spring
quarter for oft'-campus students, she
said.
The workshops would cover sub
jects including the legal ramifications
of signing a lease, community in
volvement in Palo Alto, and personal
budgeting, which could be very val

uable for someone who has not lived
off campus before, she added.
Earl said one of OCSC's problems
is that off-campus students' needs
have not yet been defined.
In an off-campus students' survey
last year 40 per cent of the under
graduates and 32 per cent of
graduate respondents said there was
something the University could do to
make off-campus life more pleasant,
but it was not clear what should be
done, she said.
"Students have demonstrated to
us the need for such a place as the
OCSC," Young said. "With the
cooperation of students in other
University offices the center has a lot
of potential to expand."

"Students living off-campus, while
paying the same tuition, weren't get
ting those benefits, so it was only fair
for the University to do something
extra."
Several students made a proposal
for an off-campus student center and
the dean of student affairs funded
$1000 renewable each year, she said.
This fund is OCSC's sole source of
income, although OSA paid for a re
novation of the center last summer,
she added.
Of the approximately 5600 under
graduate and graduate students liv
ing off-campus, about 200 have
signed up to receive OCSC's new
newsletter, the Informer, Young
said.
"I guess the OCSC is a pretty new
idea and they're not used to it," she

said. "We can't succeed until stu
dents see it as an opportunity to get
involved.
"They expect too much from the
staff and budget. The initiative
should come from students living
off-campus."
OCSC staffer Marie Earl cited some
probable reasons for lack of off
campus student involvement at the
center. Graduate students usually
center their activities on their de
partments, and most off-campus
students tend to view the center
more as a service than an organiza
tion, she said.
"I wouldn't claim that all of them
need our services, but a fairly high
percentage of the off-campus popu
lation could use them," Young said.
Services offered by the center in
clude use of the lounge and lockers,
free telephone calls to San Jose, San
Francisco and the East Bay area, and
information on car pools to and from
campus, she said.
'Home base'
"Students can read, have coffee,
and use the refrigerator. It's a home
base for students off campus," she
added.
Because the OCSC had a smaller
staff and less visibility last year,
"many students didn't know it even
existed," Young said.
"But now different students are
coming to use the center. Our mail
ing list has expanded tremendously
since the news letter was sent out,"
she said.
The first issue of the Informer was
mailed to 2000 people last month,
but now only those on the mailing list
will receive it, she added.
This year is the first the center has

been well-organized, Earl said. "It's
functioning for the first time with a
regular staff and regularly-scheduled
events."
Young said she hopes the OCSC
can establish a program to receive
ticket discounts for theater and con
cert performances, possibly through
joint programs with dormitories.
The center may also co-sponsor,
with the staff of residential educa
tion, a series of workshops spring
quarter for oft'-campus students, she
said.
The workshops would cover sub
jects including the legal ramifications
of signing a lease, community in
volvement in Palo Alto, and personal
budgeting, which could be very val

uable for someone who has not lived
off campus before, she added.
Earl said one of OCSC's problems
is that off-campus students' needs
have not yet been defined.
In an off-campus students' survey
last year 40 per cent of the under
graduates and 32 per cent of
graduate respondents said there was
something the University could do to
make off-campus life more pleasant,
but it was not clear what should be
done, she said.
"Students have demonstrated to
us the need for such a place as the
OCSC," Young said. "With the
cooperation of students in other
University offices the center has a lot
of potential to expand."
Lack of active student involvement
has been a major problem all year for
the Off-Campus Student Center
(OCSC), according to King Ming
Young, OCSC coordinator.
Young, who is also activities ad
viser for the Office of Student Ac
tivities (OSA), said because of the
OCSC's "low profile" in the past,
students living off-campus haven't
fully taken advantage of the center's
services.
"They need to realize this is their
organization, that it's a vehicle for
activities, a forum for complaints and
grievances, and a means for com
municating with each other," she
added.
The OCSC, located in the Old
Union clubhouse, was established
three years ago as a counterpart to
University programs for students liv
ing on campus, Young said.
