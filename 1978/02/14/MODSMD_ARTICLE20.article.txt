# Freshman pianist to perform here
## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
"When you're a musician, your hands
are your life," said Dana Lee, a freshman
from Sacramento.
Indeed, 17-year-old Dana Ann Lee is
quite a musician. She has won over a
dozen awards in the field of piano, and
tonight she will be performing a recital in
Tresidder Lounge at 8 p.m.
Although she aspires to be a concert
pianist, Lee realizes that it is extremely dif
ficult to get into the entertainment field,
"especially with classical music.
"There is an element of luck involved,"
Lee said. "You have to be in the right place
at the right time."
While her supportive parents' and
teachers' influence helped steer her in the
musical direction, Lee claimed she was al
ways encouraged to make her own deci
sions. Concerning piano, she chose to
continue with lessons and practice be
cause of the enjoyment they gave her.
She started lessons at age seven and
learned the basics from a children's music
teacher. At eight she switched to a classical
teacher who taught her the great masters,
and after five years she began studying
with a professor at UC Davis.
Winning
Lee emphasized the necessity of win
ning a big competition to win a big name.
Because her favorite aspects of piano are

competition and performance, she is wil
ling to practice to achieve her goal.
"I don't enjoy the scales and arpeggios,
but I realize they are stepping stones to my
goal. I like to look ahead so I can keep
things in perspective," Lee explained.
Lee spends five to six hours a day prac
ticing in preparation for recitals. Because
of this demanding schedule, Lee says her
time is very "disciplined." When ap
proaching a concert, her first priority is
practice, so her schoolwork tends to slide.
But after the concert, she concentrates on
homework. Lee describes her time budget
as a "constant tug of war.
Education
"There's nothing better than enjoying
what you're doing, but I also feel educa
tion is necessary. It gives me something to
fall back on." Lee said this is one reason
why she chose Stanford over a music con
servatory.
A music major, Lee said she especially
enjoyed one class here, "Physics of
Music," in which she learned how and
why music sounds the way it does.
"However, I'm concentrating on fulfil
ling the University distribution require
ments right now," Lee remarked.
Head start
Lee graduated from high school one
year early to get a head start on her educa
tion and her musical career.

"Competition is really something to
work for — a goal to reach," she com
mented. "It makes me polish and refine
the music with a deadline, and it helps me
to learn my repertoire faster."
Lee explained that her frame of mind
during practice is very important, and be
cause she can only concentrate a limited
amount of time, she usually breaks her
practice time into two sessions.
Concentration
"Three hours of concentrated effort is
much better than six hours of unconcen
trated practice," Lee said. "Practicing is
like a mountain, and the very tip, the
snowcap, is what the audience sees."
Lee's other hobbies include swimming,
jogging, tennis and reading. However, she
commented that sports are difficult for
musicians, since their lives are wrapped
up in their hands. "A teacher of mine once
told me, 'Dana, the best sport you could
ever play is cards.' "
While Lee very much enjoys the com
petitive aspect of piano, the main reason
she plays is for personal satisfaction. "I
enjoy what I'm doing in performance. It
enables me to express myself through
music in a communication flow. And when
I'm successful I get a great feeling of ac
complishment and of making others
happy. Because of this, performance is a
great inspiration."

things in perspective," Lee explained.
Lee spends five to six hours a day prac
ticing in preparation for recitals. Because
of this demanding schedule, Lee says her
time is very "disciplined." When ap
proaching a concert, her first priority is
practice, so her schoolwork tends to slide.
But after the concert, she concentrates on
homework. Lee describes her time budget
as a "constant tug of war.
Education
"There's nothing better than enjoying
what you're doing, but I also feel educa
tion is necessary. It gives me something to
fall back on." Lee said this is one reason
why she chose Stanford over a music con
servatory.
A music major, Lee said she especially
enjoyed one class here, "Physics of
Music," in which she learned how and
why music sounds the way it does.
"However, I'm concentrating on fulfil
ling the University distribution require
ments right now," Lee remarked.
Head start
Lee graduated from high school one
year early to get a head start on her educa
tion and her musical career.

"Competition is really something to
work for — a goal to reach," she com
mented. "It makes me polish and refine
the music with a deadline, and it helps me
to learn my repertoire faster."
Lee explained that her frame of mind
during practice is very important, and be
cause she can only concentrate a limited
amount of time, she usually breaks her
practice time into two sessions.
Concentration
"Three hours of concentrated effort is
much better than six hours of unconcen
trated practice," Lee said. "Practicing is
like a mountain, and the very tip, the
snowcap, is what the audience sees."
Lee's other hobbies include swimming,
jogging, tennis and reading. However, she
commented that sports are difficult for
musicians, since their lives are wrapped
up in their hands. "A teacher of mine once
told me, 'Dana, the best sport you could
ever play is cards.' "
While Lee very much enjoys the com
petitive aspect of piano, the main reason
she plays is for personal satisfaction. "I
enjoy what I'm doing in performance. It
enables me to express myself through
music in a communication flow. And when
I'm successful I get a great feeling of ac
complishment and of making others
happy. Because of this, performance is a
great inspiration."
"When you're a musician, your hands
are your life," said Dana Lee, a freshman
from Sacramento.
Indeed, 17-year-old Dana Ann Lee is
quite a musician. She has won over a
dozen awards in the field of piano, and
tonight she will be performing a recital in
Tresidder Lounge at 8 p.m.
Although she aspires to be a concert
pianist, Lee realizes that it is extremely dif
ficult to get into the entertainment field,
"especially with classical music.
"There is an element of luck involved,"
Lee said. "You have to be in the right place
at the right time."
While her supportive parents' and
teachers' influence helped steer her in the
musical direction, Lee claimed she was al
ways encouraged to make her own deci
sions. Concerning piano, she chose to
continue with lessons and practice be
cause of the enjoyment they gave her.
She started lessons at age seven and
learned the basics from a children's music
teacher. At eight she switched to a classical
teacher who taught her the great masters,
and after five years she began studying
with a professor at UC Davis.
Winning
Lee emphasized the necessity of win
ning a big competition to win a big name.
Because her favorite aspects of piano are

competition and performance, she is wil
ling to practice to achieve her goal.
"I don't enjoy the scales and arpeggios,
but I realize they are stepping stones to my
goal. I like to look ahead so I can keep
things in perspective," Lee explained.
