"A Killing Likeness" is an
apt title for the exhibit of cari
catures at the Stanford Gallery.
Often thought of as a frivolous
outlet, caricature was nonethe
less explored by many great ar
tists. For example, Annibale
Carraci, the 17th century Italian
master, defended his carica
tures as equal to classical art.
"Both see the lasting truth,"
Carraci wrote, "beneath the
surface of outward appear
ance. Both try to help nature
accomplish its plan. The one
strives to visualize the perfect
form . . . the other grasps the
perfect deformity, and thus re
veals the essence of the per
sonality. A good caricature,
like every work of art, is truer
to life than reality itself."
18th century
The rise in caricaturing dur
ing the 18th century coincided
with a growing tolerance for
commentary among new par
liamentary republics, particu
larly France and England. The
work of the Swiss Lavater also
sparked interest, for he argued
that the body and face reveal a
man's nature. His "Physiog

nomical Fragments," a book of
sketches and analysis, acted as
a source for artists as well as
students of behavior.
The show is extensive, rang
ing from rough sketches to all
forms of fine printmaking, as
well as a wide variety of subject
matter. One of the best sec
tions featured parodies of the
extremely cumbersome fash
ions of the 18th century.
Humor was heightened by the
obviously self-serious and pre
tentious dandy or lady of high
fashion who remained oblivi
ous to their ridiculous appear
ance.
Crucial to a rich social com
ment is society itself. Many
works revealed the growing
pains of the modern city. Cent
ral to the humor is the clear
delineation of class and rank;
those who were normally re
spected are now brought down
to the common level. One can
not imagine a similar satire in
America where social status
has never been rigidly set.
Excellent commentary
The caricatures are accom
panied by excellent commen
tary which enhanced the show
tremendously. The shift from
visual to verbal humor, particu
larly pronounced in 19th cen
tury political cartoons, necessi
tates an understanding of the
major figures and issues of the
period. For the most part,
these works retain visual in
terest, while modern cartoons
often depend solely on cap
tions for their humor.
One senses a great social
and political awareness on the
part of these artists. The period
was rich with controversial fi
gures and events. Perhaps the
social memory of a more stable
existence was fresh enough
that the pretensions and am
biguities of modern life could
be seen in sharp contrast.
Henry Monnier
Not all works transcended
caricature, but the drawings by
Henry Monnier were particu
larly fine portraits. Monnier, a
French actor and playwright,
had a remarkable gift for ob
serving and mimicking the ges
ture and attitude of a subject
for his characters. He was able
to capture something of the
individual as well, so his carica
tures are more than types. He
used a sepia wash, creating a
rich atmosphere that is re
markable in contrast to the
work of most caricaturists who
focused on facial or bodily ex
pression to the exclusion of a
setting.
Original drawings by
Ghezzi, Gillray, Rowlandson,
Daumier, and Cruikshank are
among the exhibited works, as
well as 150 prints by most of the
important French, German,
and English satirists of the
period (The Art Gallery, near
Hoover Tower, is open 10
a.m.-4:45 p.m. Tuesday — Fri
day, 1 p.m.-4:45 p.m.
weekends). The display de
votes special attention to cari

catures produced by the
French Revolution and
Napoleonic Wars, and it fol
lows the shaping of "public
images," through hostile cari
cature, of the English politician
Charles Fox, of Napoleon, Wel
lington, and King Louis-
Phillipe of France.
The topicality of caricature,
its specific comment on con
temporary events, makes it

ironically more valuable as his
torica 1 art than the history
paintings that artists valued at
this time. Caricature provides a
multi-layered, if irreverent, in
sight into the society that fos
tered it.
The show continues through
March 5. Gallery hours are
Tuesday through Friday, 10
a.m. to 4:45 p.m., and
weekends from 1 to 4:45 p.m.

ral to the humor is the clear
delineation of class and rank;
those who were normally re
spected are now brought down
to the common level. One can
not imagine a similar satire in
America where social status
has never been rigidly set.
Excellent commentary
The caricatures are accom
panied by excellent commen
tary which enhanced the show
tremendously. The shift from
visual to verbal humor, particu
larly pronounced in 19th cen
tury political cartoons, necessi
tates an understanding of the
major figures and issues of the
period. For the most part,
these works retain visual in
terest, while modern cartoons
often depend solely on cap
tions for their humor.
One senses a great social
and political awareness on the
part of these artists. The period
was rich with controversial fi
gures and events. Perhaps the
social memory of a more stable
existence was fresh enough
that the pretensions and am
biguities of modern life could
be seen in sharp contrast.
Henry Monnier
Not all works transcended
caricature, but the drawings by
Henry Monnier were particu
larly fine portraits. Monnier, a
French actor and playwright,
had a remarkable gift for ob
serving and mimicking the ges
ture and attitude of a subject
for his characters. He was able
to capture something of the
individual as well, so his carica
tures are more than types. He
used a sepia wash, creating a
rich atmosphere that is re
markable in contrast to the
work of most caricaturists who
focused on facial or bodily ex
pression to the exclusion of a
setting.
Original drawings by
Ghezzi, Gillray, Rowlandson,
Daumier, and Cruikshank are
among the exhibited works, as
well as 150 prints by most of the
important French, German,
and English satirists of the
period (The Art Gallery, near
Hoover Tower, is open 10
a.m.-4:45 p.m. Tuesday — Fri
day, 1 p.m.-4:45 p.m.
weekends). The display de
votes special attention to cari

catures produced by the
French Revolution and
Napoleonic Wars, and it fol
lows the shaping of "public
images," through hostile cari
cature, of the English politician
Charles Fox, of Napoleon, Wel
lington, and King Louis-
Phillipe of France.
The topicality of caricature,
its specific comment on con
temporary events, makes it

ironically more valuable as his
torica 1 art than the history
paintings that artists valued at
this time. Caricature provides a
multi-layered, if irreverent, in
sight into the society that fos
tered it.
The show continues through
March 5. Gallery hours are
Tuesday through Friday, 10
a.m. to 4:45 p.m., and
weekends from 1 to 4:45 p.m.

Louis-Alexandre Cosset De Guiness (called Andre Gill) did this pen, ink, wash, and crayon entitled
"Courbet, Self-Portrait and Portrait by Gill" in 1867; it is currently on display in a caricature and satire
exhibition at the Stanford Art Gallery.
"A Killing Likeness" is an
apt title for the exhibit of cari
catures at the Stanford Gallery.
Often thought of as a frivolous
outlet, caricature was nonethe
less explored by many great ar
tists. For example, Annibale
Carraci, the 17th century Italian
master, defended his carica
tures as equal to classical art.
"Both see the lasting truth,"
Carraci wrote, "beneath the
surface of outward appear
ance. Both try to help nature
accomplish its plan. The one
strives to visualize the perfect
form . . . the other grasps the
perfect deformity, and thus re
veals the essence of the per
sonality. A good caricature,
like every work of art, is truer
to life than reality itself."
18th century
The rise in caricaturing dur
ing the 18th century coincided
with a growing tolerance for
commentary among new par
liamentary republics, particu
larly France and England. The
work of the Swiss Lavater also
sparked interest, for he argued
that the body and face reveal a
man's nature. His "Physiog

nomical Fragments," a book of
sketches and analysis, acted as
a source for artists as well as
students of behavior.
The show is extensive, rang
ing from rough sketches to all
forms of fine printmaking, as
well as a wide variety of subject
matter. One of the best sec
tions featured parodies of the
extremely cumbersome fash
ions of the 18th century.
Humor was heightened by the
obviously self-serious and pre
tentious dandy or lady of high
fashion who remained oblivi
ous to their ridiculous appear
ance.
Crucial to a rich social com
ment is society itself. Many
works revealed the growing
pains of the modern city. Cent
ral to the humor is the clear
delineation of class and rank;
those who were normally re
spected are now brought down
to the common level. One can

period (The Art Gallery, near
Hoover Tower, is open 10
a.m.-4:45 p.m. Tuesday — Fri
day, 1 p.m.-4:45 p.m.
weekends). The display de
votes special attention to cari

catures produced by the
French Revolution and
Napoleonic Wars, and it fol
lows the shaping of "public
images," through hostile cari
cature, of the English politician
Charles Fox, of Napoleon, Wel
lington, and King Louis-
Phillipe of France.
The topicality of caricature,
its specific comment on con
temporary events, makes it

ironically more valuable as his
torica 1 art than the history
paintings that artists valued at
this time. Caricature provides a
multi-layered, if irreverent, in
sight into the society that fos
tered it.
The show continues through
March 5. Gallery hours are
Tuesday through Friday, 10
a.m. to 4:45 p.m., and
weekends from 1 to 4:45 p.m.
