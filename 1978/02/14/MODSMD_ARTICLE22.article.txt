## The
						Byrds (and Crosby) were great 
### 
It seems rock and roll history
is being made a couple times a
week these days, with old
bands regrouping (Country )oe
and the Fish, The Animals)
"unexpected" guests drop
ping in to sing a few songs at
their friends' concerts (The
Band's Last Waltz), or two
major talents joining forces for a
joint recording (Ronnie Lane
and Pete Townshend's "Rough
Mix").
This being the case, it would
be easy to write off last week's
Boarding House engagement
by four vets of the mid-sixties
folk rock boom as just another
reunion, probably for the cash.
But this wasn't a burnt out
band trying to recreate an
old spark that may never have
been there in the first place.
This was the Byrds.
Mit Crosby
Well, it was almost the Byrds.
Original drummer Michael
Clarke wasn't there. But no
body seemed to mind the lack
of percussion as Roger
McGuinn, Gene Clark, Chris

Hillman and the obligatory
special guest David Crosby got
together to sing a few old favo
rites.
Clark opened the show
alone with two minor key folk
songs before giving way to
Hillman, who performed two
numbers from his Manassas
days, "Bound to Fall" and"It
Doesn't Matter." Next came
McCuinn with two of his own,
including "Jolly Roger," a pi
rate ballad from his "Cardiff
Rose" album. Widening his
eyes and rocking back and
forth on his heels as he as
sumed the personna of a
"scurvy buccaneer,"
McCuinn had the audience
roaring with joy.
Then with Clark on acoustic
guitar, Hillman on mandolin,
and McCuinn on his
trademark 12-string electric
Rickenbacker, they performed
a rousing version of McCuinn's
"Chestnut Mare."
The inevitable occurred
shortly thereafter as Crosby
materialized from the audi

ence, soaking up the ovation as
the sautered to the stage, and
all of a sudden it was the Byrds
singing "Hey Mr. Tambourine
Man," and the atmosphere was
euphoric. "Tambourine Man,"
penned in 1965 by everybody's
favorite new songewriter, a
Mr. B. Dylan, sounds as good
today as it did then, and even
more importantly, it has lost
none of its credibility. The
lyrics and harmonies are as
moving now as they were then.
Also Mr. Kahn
From that point on it was old
ies night. Clark added a new
verse to another Dylan tune,
"You Ain't Coin' Nowhere,"
parodying the author:
Ghengis Khan could not keep
All his men supplied with sleep
We'll climb that mountain
No matter how deep
When we get up there
"Turn Turn Turn," "Knockin'
On Heaven's Door," and fi
nally "So You Want To Be A
Rock and Roll Star" followed,
with the audience screaming
delightedly during the latter,

filling in for the canned crowd
noise that was used for special
effect on the original 1967 re
cording.
The encore was "Eight Miles
High," a song which was ban
ned from radio airplay in 1966
because it was supposedly
about drugs, though McCuinn
always claimed it was about
airplanes. McCuinn reaffirmed
this claim to the audience as
Crosby shook his head in the
background and pantomimed
various illicit acts, including
smoking pot and eating acid.
No 'shrooms?
Over the years since the orig
inal Byrds splintered apart,
Crosby is the only one who has
achieved real stardom, but it
was obvious this night
McCuinn has always been the
driving force of the band. The
Byrds' vocal sound is actually
produced by the rather pecul
iar mix of four voices in which
one, McCuinn's, dominates
yet blends at the same time.
It was McCuinn who
pioneered the folk rock sound,
and McGuinn who, in a latter
day version of the Byrds that
included the late Cram Par
sons, helped do the same with
the fusion of country and rock.
And it was McCuinn again at
the helm at the Boarding
House. Sounding as good as
ever.
Though "Tambourine Man,"
"Turn Turn Turn" and "Eight
Miles High" drew the biggest
ovations, there was one song
performed early in the show
that really put the evening in
perspective. It was "Train
Leaves Here This Morning," a
classic country lament co
written by Gene Clark and ex-
Eagle Bernie Leadon. The song
was recorded by the Eagles for
their first album in 1972, but it
was evident from Clark's rendi
tion that there never would
have been any Eagles, or any of
the multitude of rock and
country harmonizing im
itators, no matter how good, if
there hadn't been a few other
birds first. Ironically, the house
sound system began playing
"On the Border" as the con
tented audience rose to leave
after "Eight Miles High" and
the lack of comparison was all
too obvious.
No one mentioned whether
the Boarding House reunion
would be used as a
springboard for future record
ings or performances from the
four, and no one should hold
their breath waiting for such an
occurence. But at least for a
few shows last week, it was
good to have the Byrds back.
