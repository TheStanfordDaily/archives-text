(Editor's note: The following is an unexpurgated tes
timonial written by Tom Waits, who'll be appearing Sunday
at the Dinkelspiel Silver Cloud Lounge and Grill. He
sings.)
I wtis conceived one night in April 1949, at the Crossroads
Motel in La Verne, California, amidst the broken bottle of
Four Roses, the smouldering Lucky Strike, half a tuna
salad sandwich, and the Old Spice and the one-eyed Jacks
across the railroad tracks, the drapes hung like trousers
between the drizzle-lit abandoned parking lot, and the
wilted corsage on the night stand; Mr. and Mrs. Private First
Class J. Frank Waits gave me my first big break.
Nine months later on a Sunday morning, I was born in the
back seat of a Yellow Cab in a hospital loading zone and
with the meter still running I emerged needing a shave and
shouted "Times Square and step on it!" Years later on a
snowbound Christmas Eve in Whittier, Calif., but a toddler,
on my way home from work at the factory, crawled past a
pawn shop and noticed a piano hanging up in the window,
amidst the false teeth, the bent saxophones, the cracked
clarinets and cameras, I knew I had to get my hands on that
sucker, so with beers in my eyes, that night tucked into
bed, with visions of Robitussin and Wild Irish Rose in my
head, I disclosed this dream to my mother, and my mother
in housecoat and muckalucks went down to the pawnshop
that night and put a brick through the window and dragged
home the piano for me.
Well the rest is history.
My lirst album entitled "Closing Time" marked the be
ginning of a remarkably promising career, national tour in
1971, bring me to N.Y.C. to open the show for Charlie Rich
for a week at the infamous Max's Kansas City and I was on
my way. Giving way to my second album "The Heart of
Saturday Night" and later "Night Hawks at the Diner" and
then "Small Change." With the release of my latest record,
"Foreign Affairs," I remain extremely transient, living in
hotels 10 months out of the year and on the verge of becom
ing a rumor in my spare time.
When I grow up I want to be a promo man. I've been
everywhere twice, including Belgium and Tokyo. I like
pointed shoes, gum underneath tables at expensive re
staurants, girls who wear brassieres, small lapels, cigaret
tes, luggage, passports, water color prints in motel rooms,
and a wide variety of different things. I enjoy what I do as an
entertainer, it's certainly better than wages.
