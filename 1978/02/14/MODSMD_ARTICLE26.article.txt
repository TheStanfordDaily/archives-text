Canada demands cleanup payment
United Nations — Canada's Foreign Minister Donald
Jamieson said yesterday his government will ask the
Soviet Union to pay more than $1 million as the cost of
recovering radioactive debris from a Russian nuclear
satellite that fell on the Canadian tundra Jan. 24.
Jamieson said Canada has officially concluded the
radioactive metal objects found in the Northwest Ter
ritories were "indeed debris from a Russian satellite"
and has so informed the Soviet Union and U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim — the first steps to
ward demands for compensation.
Since the spy satellite fell from orbit, Canadian and
U.S. scientific teams have been searching for radioactive
fragments.
Canada has recovered several pieces of the satellite
near the Great Slave Lake.
A few lightly radioactive chunks were found Sunday
near the Indian community of Snowdrift.
Power cuts, coal talks continue
Mandatory power cutbacks were ordered in Indiana
because of the 70-day-old nationwide coal strike yester
day.
In Indiana and West Virginia, tens of thousands of
workers feared layoffs as early as this week.
In Washington, Labor Secretary Ray Marshall met with
United Mine Workers President Arnold Miller yester
day. Deputy White House press secretary Rex Granum
said Marshall would meet with representatives of coal
producers today.
Even if a settlement were reached immediately, it
would take at least 10 days for the union membership to
ratify the pact and more time for coal shipments to reach
normal levels.
To deal with this, the staff of the eight-state East Cent
ral Area Reliability Council met at council headquarters
in Canton, Ohio Sunday, to prepare for the arrival of a
task force appointed by President Jimmy Carter to de
velop ways to combat electricity shortages.
The task force was set up Saturday and Owen Lentz,
council manager, said the group's primary goal will be to
find ways of bringing energy from areas of the country
not affected by the strike, and to ensure equitable dis
tribution of that imported energy.
The first meeting is expected tomorrow.
Begin, Sadat willing to negotiate
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin reaf
firmed yesterday that the hotly contested issue of Israeli
settlements was open for negotiation and he welcomed
resumption of U.S. mediation of the Mideast conflict.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, meanwhile, capped
his eight-nation bid for international political support
with a meeting at the Vatican with Pope Paul VI. The
pope urged that international guarantees be provided
for Jerusalem's holy places in any future settlement.
Begin was in a conciliatory mood at a news conference
yesterday after sharply criticizing U.S. Mideast policy
Sunday.
Begin confirmed a weekend report by Israeli radio that

his government has halted its expansion of Sinai settle
ments. He did not elaborate.
Israel was sharply criticized by Egypt for its Jan. 8
decision to "strengthen" existing settlements by in
creasing their size and population during peace talks.
However, Begin left the impression Israel will fight any
move to disband settlements. He said all Israel political
factions, except the minority Moscow-aligned Com
munist Party, opposed removal of the outposts.
Satellites to beam solar power?
Washington — The scientist who first proposed solar
powered satellites called yesterday for an international
effort to construct 112 satellites to beam solar power to
an energy-hungry world by the year 2025.
Dr. Peter Glaser told the annual meeting of the Ameri
can Association for the Advancement of Science that the
solar power satellite (SPS) represents one of the most
promising power generation options that could help
meet global energy demands.
Such a satellite system might provide 25 per cent of the
world's electric power needs.
He said the first commercial SPS could be put in orbit
around 1995, adding that a pilot plant could be assem
bled from components carried to orbit by the space
shuttle, which is to begin flying in 1980.
Plan for ticket service canceled
Washington — A computerized program that would
have set up one-day mail delivery of airline tickets to
those making reservations appears to have been killed
by opposition from travel agents.
Postal Service sources, declining to be publicly iden
tified, said tests had proved the feasibility of the prog
ram. But they said the airlines, which depend on travel
agents to send passengers their way, refused to partici
pate out of fear of alienating the agents.
The sources said the one-day mail service could have
lowered costs for airlines, which might have resulted in
savings for travelers.
The program would have made it unnecessary for a
traveler to visit a travel agent to pick up his airline ticket.
Because of this, the sources said, the idea was vehe
mently opposed by the American Society of Travel
Agents.
Dow Jones drops slightly
New York — The stock market, up against the news of
renewed pressure in the dollar in foreign exchange,
recorded a moderate loss yesterday in slow Lincoln's
Birthday trading.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1.56
to 774.43.
Big Board volume came to 16.81 million shares, the
lightest total for a full six-hour session this year.
Today's Weather
Fair today. Variable cloudiness through tomorrow
morning with chance of light showers. Fair tomorrow
afternoon. Slightly colder. Lows mid-30s to mid-40s.
Highs 50s. West to northwest winds 10 to 20 mph.
Chance of rain 40 per cent tonight.

Power cuts, coal talks continue
Mandatory power cutbacks were ordered in Indiana
because of the 70-day-old nationwide coal strike yester
day.
In Indiana and West Virginia, tens of thousands of
workers feared layoffs as early as this week.
In Washington, Labor Secretary Ray Marshall met with
United Mine Workers President Arnold Miller yester
day. Deputy White House press secretary Rex Granum
said Marshall would meet with representatives of coal
producers today.
Even if a settlement were reached immediately, it
would take at least 10 days for the union membership to
ratify the pact and more time for coal shipments to reach
normal levels.
To deal with this, the staff of the eight-state East Cent
ral Area Reliability Council met at council headquarters
in Canton, Ohio Sunday, to prepare for the arrival of a
task force appointed by President Jimmy Carter to de
velop ways to combat electricity shortages.
The task force was set up Saturday and Owen Lentz,
council manager, said the group's primary goal will be to
find ways of bringing energy from areas of the country
not affected by the strike, and to ensure equitable dis
tribution of that imported energy.
The first meeting is expected tomorrow.
Begin, Sadat willing to negotiate
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin reaf
firmed yesterday that the hotly contested issue of Israeli
settlements was open for negotiation and he welcomed
resumption of U.S. mediation of the Mideast conflict.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, meanwhile, capped
his eight-nation bid for international political support
with a meeting at the Vatican with Pope Paul VI. The
pope urged that international guarantees be provided
for Jerusalem's holy places in any future settlement.
Begin was in a conciliatory mood at a news conference
yesterday after sharply criticizing U.S. Mideast policy
Sunday.
Begin confirmed a weekend report by Israeli radio that

his government has halted its expansion of Sinai settle
ments. He did not elaborate.
Israel was sharply criticized by Egypt for its Jan. 8
decision to "strengthen" existing settlements by in
creasing their size and population during peace talks.
However, Begin left the impression Israel will fight any
move to disband settlements. He said all Israel political
factions, except the minority Moscow-aligned Com
munist Party, opposed removal of the outposts.
Satellites to beam solar power?
Washington — The scientist who first proposed solar
powered satellites called yesterday for an international
effort to construct 112 satellites to beam solar power to
an energy-hungry world by the year 2025.
Dr. Peter Glaser told the annual meeting of the Ameri
can Association for the Advancement of Science that the
solar power satellite (SPS) represents one of the most
promising power generation options that could help
meet global energy demands.
Such a satellite system might provide 25 per cent of the
world's electric power needs.
He said the first commercial SPS could be put in orbit
around 1995, adding that a pilot plant could be assem
bled from components carried to orbit by the space
shuttle, which is to begin flying in 1980.
Plan for ticket service canceled
Washington — A computerized program that would
have set up one-day mail delivery of airline tickets to
those making reservations appears to have been killed
by opposition from travel agents.
Postal Service sources, declining to be publicly iden
tified, said tests had proved the feasibility of the prog
ram. But they said the airlines, which depend on travel
agents to send passengers their way, refused to partici
pate out of fear of alienating the agents.
The sources said the one-day mail service could have
lowered costs for airlines, which might have resulted in
savings for travelers.
The program would have made it unnecessary for a
traveler to visit a travel agent to pick up his airline ticket.
Because of this, the sources said, the idea was vehe
mently opposed by the American Society of Travel
Agents.

Canada demands cleanup payment
United Nations — Canada's Foreign Minister Donald
Jamieson said yesterday his government will ask the
Soviet Union to pay more than $1 million as the cost of
recovering radioactive debris from a Russian nuclear
satellite that fell on the Canadian tundra Jan. 24.
Jamieson said Canada has officially concluded the
radioactive metal objects found in the Northwest Ter
ritories were "indeed debris from a Russian satellite"
and has so informed the Soviet Union and U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim — the first steps to
ward demands for compensation.
Since the spy satellite fell from orbit, Canadian and
U.S. scientific teams have been searching for radioactive
fragments.
Canada has recovered several pieces of the satellite
near the Great Slave Lake.

task force appointed by President Jimmy Carter to de
velop ways to combat electricity shortages.
The task force was set up Saturday and Owen Lentz,
council manager, said the group's primary goal will be to
find ways of bringing energy from areas of the country
not affected by the strike, and to ensure equitable dis
tribution of that imported energy.
The first meeting is expected tomorrow.
Begin, Sadat willing to negotiate
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin reaf
firmed yesterday that the hotly contested issue of Israeli
settlements was open for negotiation and he welcomed
resumption of U.S. mediation of the Mideast conflict.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, meanwhile, capped
his eight-nation bid for international political support
with a meeting at the Vatican with Pope Paul VI. The
pope urged that international guarantees be provided
for Jerusalem's holy places in any future settlement.
Begin was in a conciliatory mood at a news conference
yesterday after sharply criticizing U.S. Mideast policy
Sunday.
Begin confirmed a weekend report by Israeli radio that

his government has halted its expansion of Sinai settle
ments. He did not elaborate.
Israel was sharply criticized by Egypt for its Jan. 8
decision to "strengthen" existing settlements by in
creasing their size and population during peace talks.
However, Begin left the impression Israel will fight any
move to disband settlements. He said all Israel political
factions, except the minority Moscow-aligned Com
munist Party, opposed removal of the outposts.
Satellites to beam solar power?
Washington — The scientist who first proposed solar
powered satellites called yesterday for an international
effort to construct 112 satellites to beam solar power to
an energy-hungry world by the year 2025.
Dr. Peter Glaser told the annual meeting of the Ameri
can Association for the Advancement of Science that the
solar power satellite (SPS) represents one of the most
promising power generation options that could help
meet global energy demands.
Such a satellite system might provide 25 per cent of the
world's electric power needs.
He said the first commercial SPS could be put in orbit
around 1995, adding that a pilot plant could be assem
bled from components carried to orbit by the space
shuttle, which is to begin flying in 1980.
Plan for ticket service canceled
Washington — A computerized program that would
have set up one-day mail delivery of airline tickets to
those making reservations appears to have been killed
by opposition from travel agents.
Postal Service sources, declining to be publicly iden
tified, said tests had proved the feasibility of the prog
ram. But they said the airlines, which depend on travel
agents to send passengers their way, refused to partici
pate out of fear of alienating the agents.
The sources said the one-day mail service could have
lowered costs for airlines, which might have resulted in
savings for travelers.
The program would have made it unnecessary for a
traveler to visit a travel agent to pick up his airline ticket.
Because of this, the sources said, the idea was vehe
mently opposed by the American Society of Travel
Agents.
