Four student lobbyists represent
ing Stanford-ln-Government (SIC)
will leave next week for Washington,
D.C. in an effort to secure more
spaces for Stanford interns this
summer, according to SIC president,
Bill Guns.
The lobbyists, Brian Huntley,
Gretchen Gerwe, Pepe Brown and
Leslie Hornung, will take about 80
applications to Washington. They
will knock on congressional doors
throughout this week trying to get
internships confirmed, Guns said.
Results of the lobbying trip should
be available by the following week,
and final decisions will be made by
congressmen from now until May,
he added.
Although students apply for many
positions, students here most fre
quently seek internships with Sen.
William Proxmire (D-Wis.), Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) and Rep.
Pete Stark (D-Oakland).
The program is sponsored by SIG
so that students have personal re
commendations to submit, which
raise chances of obtaining highly
sought-after internships, Guns ad
ded.
An information service
SIG is a student-run organization
that promotes-student involvement
in government work. It is primarily
an information, not a placement ser
vice, with complete lists of potential
political and governmental summer
internships.
SIG tries to eliminate confusion in
selecting possible internships and to
insure students are made aware of
the most worthwhile positions by

making all kinds of job information
available, Guns added.
Last year nearly 100 Stanford stu
dents found positions of "responsi
bility and interest" in Washington,
according to a SIG brochure.
"The city is dynamic, it seems as
though the world revolves around
D.C. You become immersed in the
politics and fascinated by the
talented people surrounding you,"
said Steve Ruckley, a member of
SlG's board of directors.
The organization is not funded by
the University, but SIG is still able to

provide some financial aid to applic
ants, Guns said.
Many government internships are
voluntary or pay only a nominal
amount, he added, so SIC tries to
give monetary assistance to students
who would otherwise be unable to
work at these jobs. Going to
Washington is not a good way to earn
money o"er the summer, Guns said.
SIG is funded entirely through
alumni contributions. "The alumni
association is very good to us. With
out their support we would not
exist," he added.
