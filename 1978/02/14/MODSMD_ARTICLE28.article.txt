### Helen Nissenbaum 
The Stanford United Jewish Appeal
(UJA) has launched a campus-wide
campaign which includes speakers,
sherry hours, an information booth
on White Plaza and an extensive
drive to contact Jewish students.
The organization's aim is to distri
bute information about the
humanitarian needs of Israel and
world Jewry, and the workings of the
UJA, said Debbie Denenberg, UJA
campaign chairperson here.
UJA provides financial support to
needy Jews and to various Jewish
welfare, health and educational
programs in 30 countries.
It also provides financial support
to agencies which work with immig
rants to Israel. In addition, funds are
provided for scholarships and youth
services.
The UJA also supports local com
munity activities and plans to par
tially fund a new professorship at the
University.
Denenberg said she sees the cam
paign as an "outreach program." It is
aimed primarily at Jewish students
with a wide variety of religious feel
ings and practices, but who share a
sense of responsibility for a Jewish
cause, she said.
Denenberg said the campaign is
"trying to show Jewish students how
they can actually help world Jewry."
She said she hopes the campaign
will "create a Jewish community
(here) that will feel one with
worldwide Jewish communities."
Another major aim of the cam

paign is to raise funds for the UJA.
Denenberg expressed the concern
that "often the talk of money is of
fensive." She added, "We really
want to get away from that."
However, she pointed out that cer
tain achievements, such as immigra
tion to Israel of Soviet Jews, must be
paid for. She said she believes that
Jewish students can share in the re
sponsibility by giving money.
She said this drive is not just for
money, but also for "a pledge." The
campaign is "asking for responsible
commitment" that would not be
"burdensome" to any student.
The Stanford UJA has arranged five
sherry hours this week. They will be
held in major dorms and will involve
discussions with five community
leaders from the University, San Jose
and San Francisco.
