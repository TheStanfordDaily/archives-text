# Phi Psi returning
## 
### Robin Millington 
A new fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi,
was granted permission to rush this
spring at the Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC) meeting last Tuesday.
The Phi Psi's approached the IFC
Tuesday with a charter, a colony of 10
active members and a request to be
allowed to establish on campus as an
active fraternity.
The IFC has no provision in its by
laws for installing new members to
the council. However, the council
decided to admit Phi Psi to the IFC for
a $200 fee.
According to Mark Triska, IFC rush
chairman, the Phi Psi's will have to
make their own arrangements with
the University for houses in which to
hold their rush activities.
Phi Kappa Psi was one of the first
fraternities established here in 1902.
Because of lack of interest, however,
as well as lack of funds for house
upkeep, it was dissolved several
years ago, according to Phi Psi rush
chairman Carlos Hernandez. Last
spring two national members set up a
booth in White Plaza and took the
names of interested persons. The
colony was started with people from
that list.
Hernandez said the Phi Psi's want
their rush to "appeal on a more per
sonal level than the large established
fraternities." He added that one of
the major appeals of pledging with
the Phi Psi's is that it is a "chance to
build a frat and mold its future direc

tion."
The pledges will try to draw hous
ing together as a group. Failing this,
the Phi Psi's hope to move into resi
dence off campus. Hernandez said
the group must stay together as a st
able living group for at least two or
three years before the University will
consider giving them any sort of on
campus living arrangement.
Yvette Sanchez, an administrative
assistant for residential education,
said "the Phi Psi's will have to go
through the same process that any
group who wants to establish a
theme house has to. When the frat
dissolved, the house was sold to the
University. The frat will have to wait
in line for housing like any other
group.
"The University is not planning to
build any more houses," Sanchez
added.
The old Phi Psi house is now the
Phi Kappa Psi Co-op. Though the
group would be interested in even
tually returning to the old house,
Hernandez said he stressed that, we
are not out to threaten anybody,
especially the co-op group.
Triska commented on the appear
ance of a new campus fraternity.
"It shows a strengthening of the
fraternity system. Whereas other
fraternities such as Alpha Sig or
Lambda Nu have been dying as
members of the traditional fraternity
system, here is a fraternity trying to
come back," he said.
