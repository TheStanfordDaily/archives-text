# Storms letting up across the nation

### Associated Press 
The Ohio River Valley braced tor
another winter storm yesterday,
while the northern Midwest dug out
from as much as a foot of new snow.
The threat of mudslides eased in
California, and there was wet but
seasonable weather in the South
east.
In the Northeast, another snowfall
— this time measuring in inches in
stead of in feet — was in store for
snow-weary residents.
Winter storm watches last night
stretched from Southern Illinois to
northern portions of Maryland and
Delaware. Freezing rain and snow
was in the forecast for the region.
Heavy snow warnings were posted
for southern and central Ohio,
where 2 to 4 inches of new snow was
predicted, and travelers' advisories
were posted for northern portions of
the state.
The snowstorm, moving east,
paralyzed Nebraska early yesterday.
Some of the state's highways were
closed and hazardous driving was
reported on those that were open,
the state patrol said. Snowfall aver
aged 8 inches. Schools and airports
were closed all over the state.
Up to a foot of snow was dumped
on the western two-thirds of Mis
souri, and heavy snow warnings or
travelers' advisories were in effect
for the entire state.
Another Pacific storm front is ex
pected late tonight in northwestern
California.
And in southern California, where
Gov. )erry Brown declared much of
the region a disaster area yesterday
because of last week's storms, mud
soaked residents braced for yet
another in a series of storms in the
second wettest season in the area's
history.
Brown said the state of emergency
is in effect retroactively from Feb. 5,
when the rainstorms began, in the
counties of Los Angeles, Ventura,
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino,
Santa Barbara, Kern and Tulare. He
also asked President Jimmy Carter to
declare that a major disaster exists in
California. Brown said damage from

last week's rainstorms reached about
$43 million.
The fifth in the series of storms
since Feb. 5 was headed from the
western Gulf of Alaska, and the Na
tional Weather Service said it would
arrive tomorrow. The four earlier
storms have brought the season's
rainfall total to 21.42 inches in Los
Angeles, making this the second wet
test season since 1889-1890, when
32.55 inches fell.
Ten people still were listed as mis
sing since last Friday's storm.
In the Sierra, the snowpack was
reported at its deepest since the
winter of 1969. More than 170 inches
of snow were reported on the
ground at Norden. An avalanche
warning was issued yesterday for the
east slope of the Sierra.
