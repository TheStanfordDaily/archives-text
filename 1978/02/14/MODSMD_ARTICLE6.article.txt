# Trustees meet today
## No action planned on divestment 
### 
No action is expected on the con
troversial issue of University invest
ment in corporations with assets in
South Africa when the Board of Trus
tees meets at its regular meeting
today in San Francisco.
At yesterday's Committee on In
vestments meeting, trustees did,
however, discuss upcoming proxy
resolutions, according to Vice Presi
dent for Business and Finance Wil
liam Massy.
Massy said the committee heard
"forecast of proxy issues to give
them (the trustees) a sense of what
was coming."
He said the discussion was g "«neral
and was similar to information given
to the Commission on Investment

Responsibility (CIR). "There was no
discussion of substance on that issue
(the South African investment issue)
specifically," Massy said.
"We have a CIR," Massy said. "The
CIR will certainly be cognizant of the
South Africa divestment issue. I
don't see that there is anything else
for them (the trustees) to do at this
time."
The CIR was the center of con
troversy recently because of ASSU
Nominations Committee refusal to
nominate students to the advisory
body, and ASSU Senate support of
that move. Instead, President
Richard Lyman had students ap
pointed to the commission ran
domly, despite strong student objec

tion to the action.
Lyman will report on the issue dur
ing his report to the tull board today,
according to G. Robert Hamrdla, as
sistant to the president for trustee
affairs.
Hamrdla said he could not specu
late on whether the report would
spark a discussion of the matter be
fore the full board, but he said such a
discussion is not currently on the
agenda and no action is planned.
Today was originally to be the
deadline for divestment of such sec
urities set by the Stanford Commit
tee for a Responsible Investment Pol
icy.
However the organization with-
drew its demand last week in light of
administration statements that such
an action was not expected.
In other business to come before
the board, the University plans to es
tablish its first policy concerning use
of real property gifts.
Each year the University receives
gifts of land from donors, and in the
past the gifts have generally been
sold. The new policy would allow for
retention of the property if tnere "is
the prospect of expectation of an
above-average return, including ap
preciation in value," or when there is
possible use of the land for academic
purposes.
