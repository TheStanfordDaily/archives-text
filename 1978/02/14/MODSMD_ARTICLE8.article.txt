# Stanford life destructive
## Is God dead at Stanford? ... anatomy of a dropout 
### 
Michael Jennings

Three weeks before the end of last quarter, I dropped
out of this University with the intention of never return
ing again. Shortly after I made my decision, I was invited
by the editor to discuss my action in these pages. I had to
seriously question whether such a discussion would in
any way benefit the Stanford community or if it would
not perhaps only serve as an exercise in self
gratification.
For, in many ways my decision to leave school has
been a highly personal one; surely many other students
are making such decisions all the time without all the
fanfare of announcing it to the world through the school
paper. Furthermore, many of the things I must necessar
ily say about my decision can ultimately only be expres
sed through my entire being, and not in mere words.
In the end I decided to accept the invitation, however
inadequate my words may be, in the hope that I may be
of some aid toothers consideringa similar move . . .and
perhaps stimulate in those for whom "all's well" at this
University, a little reflection. Finally, I take solace in the
words of anti-war activist Daniel Berrigan, who once
said, "I'd rather be sorry for something I did, than some
thing I didn't do."
Crisis penetrates habits
Each of us has untapped potentials. But we are "crea
tures of habit," and — in Western culture in general, and
at Stanford in particular — of hyper-rationality. Some
times it takes a powerful personal crisis to break through
our walls of habit and rationality in order to realize more
fully our potentials.
It was through just such a crisis that I arrived at the idea
of dropping out of Stanford. Though precipitated by a
human ailment even the most Utopian of societies prob
ably will not be able to cure — shall we say, "matters of
the heart"— I soon found my interior dams crumbling,
and all kinds of things flooded into my awareness at
once.
I had just spent the previous few days writing and
re-writing a "Daily" column on "What It Means to Be a
Radical." I became plagued with a sense of hypocrisy,
feeling I was not fully living up toall the convictions I had
expressed in the article. Like many fellow activists, I had
been feeling a tremendous tension all quarter between
schoolwork and political organizing; I felt I was not
doing either very well.
Haunted by failure
One aspect of schoolwork has always been for me a
tremendous struggle — writing papers — and I was in
the middle of attempting to write one at the time; not
surprisingly, under the conditions, with little success.
Sinking lower and lower, my entire American hyper
success-oriented conditioning rose up to haunt me: I
was feeling like a complete failure.
Failure, of course, is relative to one's standards of
success. But in a profit-maximizing society that keeps
everyone running ever faster by dangling the carrot of
satisfaction just out of reach, where all the "success" in
the world is never really enough, even the smallest step
"backwards" can be traumatic. One feels completely
isolated; for, we are all competing in a poker game in
which no one lets on that they, too, sometimes come up
with a bad hand.
At the bottom of my crisis, in the depths of despair, my
chaotic thoughts finally crystalized into thesequestions:
"Should my personal success be my greatest concern? Is
individual achievement what it is all about? Or is it this
very focus that prevents me from exploring the pos
sibilities in what I feel in fact is most important in life:
sharing with others?" To an extent merely posing such
abstract questions in print cannot convey, I felt my
whole being struggling with them.
Obsessed with success
just when I thought I was at my wits' end, everything
suddenly became clear: it is precisely this whole obses
sion with personal success, and achievement in general,
that is pushing our planet ever and ever closer to the
brink of total disaster. I found myself going beyond
merely "seeing" our mad onrush towards some kind of
holocaust; in a way I cannot really describe, I was "ex
periencing'' apocalyptic visions: everything from T.S.

EHot's "wasteland," to nuclear warfare, to the Fall of
Western Civilization.
Furthermore, I realized more clearly than I ever had
before that Stanford embodies and plays a crucial role in
a global system and a way of life that is destructive to
human flesh and spirit. I saw that not only were others
being harmed, but that I, myself, for all my critical at
titude, could not remain unaffected by the competitive
ness, the grade-grubbing, the obsession with future go
als, the personal ambition, the material extravagance,
the alienation and the passivity one finds at Stanford.
It is the obsession with personal success and
achievement that creates the energy to keep the Big
Wheel turning. Fear is the watchword. Keep everyone
terrified of failing and they will run faster and faster on
the treadmill. In the face of an economic recession, fear
turns into panic; students cling to the biggest, strongest
wooden horses (the "professions"), lest they spin off
the merry-go-round altogether.
Everyone takes only those courses, answers only
those test questions, writes only those papers they are
sure will produce the Almighty "A." Creativity, with its
attendant element of risk, gets thrown out the window
in the frantic search for a safe corner to hide in.
Liberated by dropping out
People tell me I'm crazy to be dropping out of school
when I could be getting my degree in a couple of quar
ters. But something in me, in the midst of that crisis,
snapped, while something else gelled: I found that in
order to be true to myself, I could no longer lend the
legitimacy to this institution that my being enrolled here
provides.
Friends and family pleaded with me to at least finish
out the quarter; but having seen things asclearly as I did,
I felt I must act immediately — before all the old habits,
conditioned fears, and outside pressures pushed me
back into the same old groove where tunnel vision and
narrowly "rational" action prevail.
Time has thus far rewarded me for my decision; drop
ping out of school has been a tremendously liberating
experience. It has clarified and illuminated a great many
things about myself and my relationship to the world
around me. I have never felt such a deep sense of integ
rity, wholeness and peace with myself.
Observing the rat race
I feel I have finally gotten out of the cage I was first put
into back in elementary school. I have removed myself
from the Rat Race: the race in which one has to worry
about one's every move in terms of how it will look on
The Transcript; the race that turns people into com
petitors, functions, stepping stones, cogs, sex objects,
and simple non-persons; the race fueled by alcohol,
valium, cars, caffeine, cocaine, television and other
drugs; the race in which the addicted, the slow, the
weak, the sensitive, the "insane," the old, the crippled,
the lonely, the freaks, the ragged, the impoverished —
all the "Useless Ones," created more often than not by
the race itself — are simply trampled upon; the race
which knows no end until death do us part.
Now that I have dropped out of the race and climbed
up into the grandstands to get an overview of the whole
carnival, I am truly astounded at just what a ghastly,
absurd, and cruel affair it really is. From up here, it
becomes clear that the King truly has no clothes on. Even
at Stanford, the well-protected maze preparing tomor
row's Head Rats for the unreal Real World, one is treated
to the pathetic spectacle of bright, talented people
grovelling in the dust in the most humiliating fashion for
a few extra points on a lousy test. (I've done it too.)
Performing for prizes
The buzzing one hears from those who are not actu
ally in the dust all seems to be about the same subject,
grades, and everyone is always anxiously consulting
their scorecards. One would think this an educational
institution that is supposed to challenge one with the
wisdom of the ages; but apparently it is just a gameshow
where one consumes as many facts as fast as possible,
spits them out on little pieces of paper, and then forgets
them just as quickly. The prizes are sponsored by Pre
stigious Professional Schools and Big Daddy Corpora
tions. A few people are off to the side, trying to avoid the
game, but they are constantly distracted by the din of

competition.
Professors are likewise caught, although in a some
what more advanced game. Tenure must be gotten;
one's professional standing must be kept up; one's
power in the University must be extended. So one cor
ners some minute, "safe" portion of the academic field;
one competes with one's "colleagues"; one staves off
grasping students so one can get back to one's research.
Backstage, families must be supported, taxes paid.
The administrators and trustees coordinate the Little
Came at Stanford with the Big Came of the Real World.
Administrators are simply the managers, the executives
of University Incorporated; the trustees, the stockhol
ders. Stanford trades in technological stock and skilled
bondsmen; "corporate contributions" are its commis
sion for this service. Cone is the "cathedral of learning";
knowledge has become another big business.
Global games of greed
Many of these games might be harmless enough in
and of themselves, but they become deeply disturbing
when, gazing over the entire global field, one observes
that half the participants do not even have enough food
to eat; that the stadium as a whole is overflowing with
people and more keep entering all the time; that despite
repeated announcements over the loudspeaker that we
are running out of resources, 6 per cent of the people
continue consuming a third of them and keep clammer
ing for more; that a thick haze is setting in making
breathing more and more difficult; and that — most
frightening of all — everyone in sight is procuring these
absolutely insane little "toys," a few of which could blow
up the entire stadium.
Apocalypse'has arrived
Why is it that so many of us are resisting the increas
ingly obvious: these "games" we are playing are seri
ously threatening the survival of life on this planet?
Could it be that we are so intent on our own advance
ment that we cannot even conceive of that which might
interfere with it? Could it be that we subconsciously
realize that if we were truly to comprehend present
global trends, we might have to fundamentally change
our plans and lifestyles? Could it be we are unwiliing to
change?
For, change we must, and radically so. To say that we
will change when and if circumstances demand it shows
that we have not even begun to understand what is
going on in the world. For two billion people suffering
from malnutrition or actually starving, the Apocalypse is
not some vague possibility in the distant future; it has
already arrived. If you have been to New York City or any
of the other decaying Northeastern and Midwestern
cities recently, you might say the same about them:
mass neurosis is bordering on mass psychosis.
Solution within self
"Okay, okay," we cry, "What is the solution? What is
the solution?" If that is all we can cry, then I suggest we
look again: obviously, we still have not comprehended
things as they really are. And I do not just mean things as
they appear on the charts, in the books, but the human
costs as well. For once we look at the whole picture, the
human as well as the statistical, and let this knowledge
pervade our whole beings, we shall have been trans
formed, and the solution will become obvious: it lies
within ourselves.
In short, it lies within each and every one of us taking
full responsibility for what is going on in the world. For
the present mess is being caused by our greed and
ambition, by our insistence on buying junk we don't
need, by our driving when we could be bicycling, by our
insistence on eating resource-inefficient meat when we
would probably be doing better without it, and by our
going to work for and profiting from a system hell-bent
on its own and everyone else's destruction.
Realize our unity
Although an audience as supposedly "sophisticated"
as the Stanford one may find it a little silly and simplistic,
it must be said that in the end the only way we are really
going to come to grips with our present dilemma is when
each of us begins to realize his fundamental unity and

connectedness, when each of us begins to grow in love,
godliness, oneness, wholism, or whatever name one
wants to give it.
For only with such a wholistic approach can we hope
to deal with our problems without creating new ones,
While many solutions will have to be in part technical
and utilize professional skills, it is precisely the narrowly
technological outlook and fragmented approach that
have to a great extent brought us to this maelstrom.
We all have it within us not only to grow, but, indeed,
to realize the fullness of love, oneness, "God — again,
whatever you want to call it. It is a lifetime of condition
ing, conditioning in fear, greed, ambition, competitive
ness, nationalism, racism, sexism, future-orientation,
etc., that is preventing that potential from being
realized. Only by coming to see and understand how
deep this conditioning goes and how it operates in our
daily lives, can we begin to liberate ourselves from it. In
the timeless words of Socrates: Know Thyself.
Creative energy sapped
Certainly not everyone needs to drop out of Stanford
to further themselves along the road to self-discovery
... but I did. Only now am I fully realizing just how
destructive the anxiety of grades and the obsession with
personal achievement has been to my natural love of
learning (which I now see has been part of my difficulty
in writing papers). We generally fail to realize how sensi
tive we are to the internal conflict created by being
involved in things (like Stanford) we do not fully believe
in and how much this conflict saps creative energy.
As for the future: I find myself worrying less and less
about it. This mad quest for security most Stanford stu
dents are engaged in is pure illusion. No one is going to
be able to escape the global chaos that seems at this
point inevitable, not to mention the chaos the Rat Race is
wreaking in people's lives every day. There are alterna
tives to working in "the System," and where they do not
exist, we must create them.
Hitchhiking through life
It was through hitchhiking that I first understood the
inherent insecurity of existence, and by embracing this
fact, instead of trying to escape it, that I first experienced
some of the ecstasy of a "be here now" existence.
Life really is like a hitchhiking trip: one has both good
and bad luck, the weather can be fickle and extreme,
and one never knows what kind of experience one's
next "ride" is going to bring. But it is a trip that leads
inexorably to death, so unless one enjoys the scenery
along the way, one finds that one has gone nowhere at
all.
More and more in my "hitchhike" through life, I find
myself wanting to divert the eyes of my "drivers" from
their hypnotic fixation on the macadam highway before
them to point out the incredible vistas all around the
road: the green pastures, the gently rolling hills, and far
off in the distance, the rugged, muscular mountains,
streaming sunlight making their snowy peaks almost too
brilliant to look at.
Road to success?
But the very few drivers who dare to take their eyes off
the road for even a moment, usually snap their gaze
immediately back to the dull gray ribbon before them.
For what I forgot to tell them was that in order to see all
this majestic scenery, they first had to be confronted
with the huge, desperately-pleading eyes of . . . the
wretched, the lonely, the forgotten, and most of all the
dead, staring at us from the gutters alongside the road.
After such a traumatic experience most drivers are
afraid to even look in the rear view mirror lest they catch
sight of themselves and see dancing in their eyes the
same horrors. With renewed concentration and deter
mination, they push down hard on the accelerator, pas
sing every car in sight, hoping to arrive in a nowhere land
beyond the roadside of suffering humanity, the whole
time keeping their eyes riveted on the road ahead, the
road to "success," the "safe" road, the road that really
runs six feet under . . . the road of being a Stanford
student.

not perhaps only serve as an exercise in self
gratification.
For, in many ways my decision to leave school has
been a highly personal one; surely many other students
are making such decisions all the time without all the
fanfare of announcing it to the world through the school
paper. Furthermore, many of the things I must necessar
ily say about my decision can ultimately only be expres
sed through my entire being, and not in mere words.
In the end I decided to accept the invitation, however
inadequate my words may be, in the hope that I may be
of some aid toothers consideringa similar move . . .and
perhaps stimulate in those for whom "all's well" at this
University, a little reflection. Finally, I take solace in the
words of anti-war activist Daniel Berrigan, who once
said, "I'd rather be sorry for something I did, than some
thing I didn't do."
Crisis penetrates habits
Each of us has untapped potentials. But we are "crea
tures of habit," and — in Western culture in general, and
at Stanford in particular — of hyper-rationality. Some
times it takes a powerful personal crisis to break through
our walls of habit and rationality in order to realize more
fully our potentials.
It was through just such a crisis that I arrived at the idea
of dropping out of Stanford. Though precipitated by a
human ailment even the most Utopian of societies prob
ably will not be able to cure — shall we say, "matters of
the heart"— I soon found my interior dams crumbling,
and all kinds of things flooded into my awareness at
once.
I had just spent the previous few days writing and
re-writing a "Daily" column on "What It Means to Be a
Radical." I became plagued with a sense of hypocrisy,
feeling I was not fully living up toall the convictions I had
expressed in the article. Like many fellow activists, I had
been feeling a tremendous tension all quarter between
schoolwork and political organizing; I felt I was not
doing either very well.
Haunted by failure
One aspect of schoolwork has always been for me a
tremendous struggle — writing papers — and I was in
the middle of attempting to write one at the time; not
surprisingly, under the conditions, with little success.
Sinking lower and lower, my entire American hyper
success-oriented conditioning rose up to haunt me: I
was feeling like a complete failure.
Failure, of course, is relative to one's standards of
success. But in a profit-maximizing society that keeps
everyone running ever faster by dangling the carrot of
satisfaction just out of reach, where all the "success" in
the world is never really enough, even the smallest step
"backwards" can be traumatic. One feels completely
isolated; for, we are all competing in a poker game in
which no one lets on that they, too, sometimes come up
with a bad hand.
At the bottom of my crisis, in the depths of despair, my
chaotic thoughts finally crystalized into thesequestions:
"Should my personal success be my greatest concern? Is
individual achievement what it is all about? Or is it this
very focus that prevents me from exploring the pos
sibilities in what I feel in fact is most important in life:
sharing with others?" To an extent merely posing such
abstract questions in print cannot convey, I felt my
whole being struggling with them.
Obsessed with success
just when I thought I was at my wits' end, everything
suddenly became clear: it is precisely this whole obses
sion with personal success, and achievement in general,
that is pushing our planet ever and ever closer to the
brink of total disaster. I found myself going beyond
merely "seeing" our mad onrush towards some kind of
holocaust; in a way I cannot really describe, I was "ex
periencing'' apocalyptic visions: everything from T.S.

EHot's "wasteland," to nuclear warfare, to the Fall of
Western Civilization.
Furthermore, I realized more clearly than I ever had
before that Stanford embodies and plays a crucial role in
a global system and a way of life that is destructive to
human flesh and spirit. I saw that not only were others
being harmed, but that I, myself, for all my critical at
titude, could not remain unaffected by the competitive
ness, the grade-grubbing, the obsession with future go
als, the personal ambition, the material extravagance,
the alienation and the passivity one finds at Stanford.
It is the obsession with personal success and
achievement that creates the energy to keep the Big
Wheel turning. Fear is the watchword. Keep everyone
terrified of failing and they will run faster and faster on
the treadmill. In the face of an economic recession, fear
turns into panic; students cling to the biggest, strongest
wooden horses (the "professions"), lest they spin off
the merry-go-round altogether.
Everyone takes only those courses, answers only
those test questions, writes only those papers they are
sure will produce the Almighty "A." Creativity, with its
attendant element of risk, gets thrown out the window
in the frantic search for a safe corner to hide in.
Liberated by dropping out
People tell me I'm crazy to be dropping out of school
when I could be getting my degree in a couple of quar
ters. But something in me, in the midst of that crisis,
snapped, while something else gelled: I found that in
order to be true to myself, I could no longer lend the
legitimacy to this institution that my being enrolled here
provides.
Friends and family pleaded with me to at least finish
out the quarter; but having seen things asclearly as I did,
I felt I must act immediately — before all the old habits,
conditioned fears, and outside pressures pushed me
back into the same old groove where tunnel vision and
narrowly "rational" action prevail.
Time has thus far rewarded me for my decision; drop
ping out of school has been a tremendously liberating
experience. It has clarified and illuminated a great many
things about myself and my relationship to the world
around me. I have never felt such a deep sense of integ
rity, wholeness and peace with myself.
Observing the rat race
I feel I have finally gotten out of the cage I was first put
into back in elementary school. I have removed myself
from the Rat Race: the race in which one has to worry
about one's every move in terms of how it will look on
The Transcript; the race that turns people into com
petitors, functions, stepping stones, cogs, sex objects,
and simple non-persons; the race fueled by alcohol,
valium, cars, caffeine, cocaine, television and other
drugs; the race in which the addicted, the slow, the
weak, the sensitive, the "insane," the old, the crippled,
the lonely, the freaks, the ragged, the impoverished —
all the "Useless Ones," created more often than not by
the race itself — are simply trampled upon; the race
which knows no end until death do us part.
Now that I have dropped out of the race and climbed
up into the grandstands to get an overview of the whole
carnival, I am truly astounded at just what a ghastly,
absurd, and cruel affair it really is. From up here, it
becomes clear that the King truly has no clothes on. Even
at Stanford, the well-protected maze preparing tomor
row's Head Rats for the unreal Real World, one is treated
to the pathetic spectacle of bright, talented people
grovelling in the dust in the most humiliating fashion for
a few extra points on a lousy test. (I've done it too.)
Performing for prizes
The buzzing one hears from those who are not actu
ally in the dust all seems to be about the same subject,
grades, and everyone is always anxiously consulting
their scorecards. One would think this an educational
institution that is supposed to challenge one with the
wisdom of the ages; but apparently it is just a gameshow
where one consumes as many facts as fast as possible,
spits them out on little pieces of paper, and then forgets
them just as quickly. The prizes are sponsored by Pre
stigious Professional Schools and Big Daddy Corpora
tions. A few people are off to the side, trying to avoid the
game, but they are constantly distracted by the din of

competition.
Professors are likewise caught, although in a some
what more advanced game. Tenure must be gotten;
one's professional standing must be kept up; one's
power in the University must be extended. So one cor
ners some minute, "safe" portion of the academic field;
one competes with one's "colleagues"; one staves off
grasping students so one can get back to one's research.
Backstage, families must be supported, taxes paid.
The administrators and trustees coordinate the Little
Came at Stanford with the Big Came of the Real World.
Administrators are simply the managers, the executives
of University Incorporated; the trustees, the stockhol
ders. Stanford trades in technological stock and skilled
bondsmen; "corporate contributions" are its commis
sion for this service. Cone is the "cathedral of learning";
knowledge has become another big business.
Global games of greed
Many of these games might be harmless enough in
and of themselves, but they become deeply disturbing
when, gazing over the entire global field, one observes
that half the participants do not even have enough food
to eat; that the stadium as a whole is overflowing with
people and more keep entering all the time; that despite
repeated announcements over the loudspeaker that we
are running out of resources, 6 per cent of the people
continue consuming a third of them and keep clammer
ing for more; that a thick haze is setting in making
breathing more and more difficult; and that — most
frightening of all — everyone in sight is procuring these
absolutely insane little "toys," a few of which could blow
up the entire stadium.
Apocalypse'has arrived
Why is it that so many of us are resisting the increas
ingly obvious: these "games" we are playing are seri
ously threatening the survival of life on this planet?
Could it be that we are so intent on our own advance
ment that we cannot even conceive of that which might
interfere with it? Could it be that we subconsciously
realize that if we were truly to comprehend present
global trends, we might have to fundamentally change
our plans and lifestyles? Could it be we are unwiliing to
change?
For, change we must, and radically so. To say that we
will change when and if circumstances demand it shows
that we have not even begun to understand what is
going on in the world. For two billion people suffering
from malnutrition or actually starving, the Apocalypse is
not some vague possibility in the distant future; it has
already arrived. If you have been to New York City or any
of the other decaying Northeastern and Midwestern
cities recently, you might say the same about them:
mass neurosis is bordering on mass psychosis.
Solution within self
"Okay, okay," we cry, "What is the solution? What is
the solution?" If that is all we can cry, then I suggest we
look again: obviously, we still have not comprehended
things as they really are. And I do not just mean things as
they appear on the charts, in the books, but the human
costs as well. For once we look at the whole picture, the
human as well as the statistical, and let this knowledge
pervade our whole beings, we shall have been trans
formed, and the solution will become obvious: it lies
within ourselves.
In short, it lies within each and every one of us taking
full responsibility for what is going on in the world. For
the present mess is being caused by our greed and
ambition, by our insistence on buying junk we don't
need, by our driving when we could be bicycling, by our
insistence on eating resource-inefficient meat when we
would probably be doing better without it, and by our
going to work for and profiting from a system hell-bent
on its own and everyone else's destruction.
Realize our unity
Although an audience as supposedly "sophisticated"
as the Stanford one may find it a little silly and simplistic,
it must be said that in the end the only way we are really
going to come to grips with our present dilemma is when
each of us begins to realize his fundamental unity and

connectedness, when each of us begins to grow in love,
godliness, oneness, wholism, or whatever name one
wants to give it.
For only with such a wholistic approach can we hope
to deal with our problems without creating new ones,
While many solutions will have to be in part technical
and utilize professional skills, it is precisely the narrowly
technological outlook and fragmented approach that
have to a great extent brought us to this maelstrom.
We all have it within us not only to grow, but, indeed,
to realize the fullness of love, oneness, "God — again,
whatever you want to call it. It is a lifetime of condition
ing, conditioning in fear, greed, ambition, competitive
ness, nationalism, racism, sexism, future-orientation,
etc., that is preventing that potential from being
realized. Only by coming to see and understand how
deep this conditioning goes and how it operates in our
daily lives, can we begin to liberate ourselves from it. In
the timeless words of Socrates: Know Thyself.
Creative energy sapped
Certainly not everyone needs to drop out of Stanford
to further themselves along the road to self-discovery
... but I did. Only now am I fully realizing just how
destructive the anxiety of grades and the obsession with
personal achievement has been to my natural love of
learning (which I now see has been part of my difficulty
in writing papers). We generally fail to realize how sensi
tive we are to the internal conflict created by being
involved in things (like Stanford) we do not fully believe
in and how much this conflict saps creative energy.
As for the future: I find myself worrying less and less
about it. This mad quest for security most Stanford stu
dents are engaged in is pure illusion. No one is going to
be able to escape the global chaos that seems at this
point inevitable, not to mention the chaos the Rat Race is
wreaking in people's lives every day. There are alterna
tives to working in "the System," and where they do not
exist, we must create them.
Hitchhiking through life
It was through hitchhiking that I first understood the
inherent insecurity of existence, and by embracing this
fact, instead of trying to escape it, that I first experienced
some of the ecstasy of a "be here now" existence.
Life really is like a hitchhiking trip: one has both good
and bad luck, the weather can be fickle and extreme,
and one never knows what kind of experience one's
next "ride" is going to bring. But it is a trip that leads
inexorably to death, so unless one enjoys the scenery
along the way, one finds that one has gone nowhere at
all.
More and more in my "hitchhike" through life, I find
myself wanting to divert the eyes of my "drivers" from
their hypnotic fixation on the macadam highway before
them to point out the incredible vistas all around the
road: the green pastures, the gently rolling hills, and far
off in the distance, the rugged, muscular mountains,
streaming sunlight making their snowy peaks almost too
brilliant to look at.
Road to success?
But the very few drivers who dare to take their eyes off
the road for even a moment, usually snap their gaze
immediately back to the dull gray ribbon before them.
For what I forgot to tell them was that in order to see all
this majestic scenery, they first had to be confronted
with the huge, desperately-pleading eyes of . . . the
wretched, the lonely, the forgotten, and most of all the
dead, staring at us from the gutters alongside the road.
After such a traumatic experience most drivers are
afraid to even look in the rear view mirror lest they catch
sight of themselves and see dancing in their eyes the
same horrors. With renewed concentration and deter
mination, they push down hard on the accelerator, pas
sing every car in sight, hoping to arrive in a nowhere land
beyond the roadside of suffering humanity, the whole
time keeping their eyes riveted on the road ahead, the
road to "success," the "safe" road, the road that really
runs six feet under . . . the road of being a Stanford
student.

Three weeks before the end of last quarter, I dropped
out of this University with the intention of never return
ing again. Shortly after I made my decision, I was invited
by the editor to discuss my action in these pages. I had to
seriously question whether such a discussion would in
any way benefit the Stanford community or if it would
not perhaps only serve as an exercise in self

ily say about my decision can ultimately only be expres
sed through my entire being, and not in mere words.
In the end I decided to accept the invitation, however
inadequate my words may be, in the hope that I may be
of some aid toothers consideringa similar move . . .and
perhaps stimulate in those for whom "all's well" at this
University, a little reflection. Finally, I take solace in the
words of anti-war activist Daniel Berrigan, who once
said, "I'd rather be sorry for something I did, than some
thing I didn't do."
Crisis penetrates habits
Each of us has untapped potentials. But we are "crea
tures of habit," and — in Western culture in general, and
at Stanford in particular — of hyper-rationality. Some
times it takes a powerful personal crisis to break through
our walls of habit and rationality in order to realize more
fully our potentials.
It was through just such a crisis that I arrived at the idea
of dropping out of Stanford. Though precipitated by a
human ailment even the most Utopian of societies prob
ably will not be able to cure — shall we say, "matters of
the heart"— I soon found my interior dams crumbling,
and all kinds of things flooded into my awareness at
once.
I had just spent the previous few days writing and
re-writing a "Daily" column on "What It Means to Be a
Radical." I became plagued with a sense of hypocrisy,
feeling I was not fully living up toall the convictions I had
expressed in the article. Like many fellow activists, I had
been feeling a tremendous tension all quarter between
schoolwork and political organizing; I felt I was not
doing either very well.
Haunted by failure
One aspect of schoolwork has always been for me a
tremendous struggle — writing papers — and I was in
the middle of attempting to write one at the time; not
surprisingly, under the conditions, with little success.
Sinking lower and lower, my entire American hyper
success-oriented conditioning rose up to haunt me: I
was feeling like a complete failure.
Failure, of course, is relative to one's standards of
success. But in a profit-maximizing society that keeps
everyone running ever faster by dangling the carrot of
satisfaction just out of reach, where all the "success" in
the world is never really enough, even the smallest step
"backwards" can be traumatic. One feels completely
isolated; for, we are all competing in a poker game in
which no one lets on that they, too, sometimes come up
with a bad hand.
At the bottom of my crisis, in the depths of despair, my
chaotic thoughts finally crystalized into thesequestions:
"Should my personal success be my greatest concern? Is
individual achievement what it is all about? Or is it this
very focus that prevents me from exploring the pos
sibilities in what I feel in fact is most important in life:
sharing with others?" To an extent merely posing such
abstract questions in print cannot convey, I felt my
whole being struggling with them.
Obsessed with success
just when I thought I was at my wits' end, everything
suddenly became clear: it is precisely this whole obses
sion with personal success, and achievement in general,
that is pushing our planet ever and ever closer to the
brink of total disaster. I found myself going beyond
merely "seeing" our mad onrush towards some kind of
holocaust; in a way I cannot really describe, I was "ex
periencing'' apocalyptic visions: everything from T.S.

EHot's "wasteland," to nuclear warfare, to the Fall of
Western Civilization.
Furthermore, I realized more clearly than I ever had
before that Stanford embodies and plays a crucial role in
a global system and a way of life that is destructive to
human flesh and spirit. I saw that not only were others
being harmed, but that I, myself, for all my critical at
titude, could not remain unaffected by the competitive
ness, the grade-grubbing, the obsession with future go
als, the personal ambition, the material extravagance,
the alienation and the passivity one finds at Stanford.
It is the obsession with personal success and
achievement that creates the energy to keep the Big
Wheel turning. Fear is the watchword. Keep everyone
terrified of failing and they will run faster and faster on
the treadmill. In the face of an economic recession, fear
turns into panic; students cling to the biggest, strongest
wooden horses (the "professions"), lest they spin off
the merry-go-round altogether.
Everyone takes only those courses, answers only
those test questions, writes only those papers they are
sure will produce the Almighty "A." Creativity, with its
attendant element of risk, gets thrown out the window
in the frantic search for a safe corner to hide in.
Liberated by dropping out
People tell me I'm crazy to be dropping out of school
when I could be getting my degree in a couple of quar
ters. But something in me, in the midst of that crisis,
snapped, while something else gelled: I found that in
order to be true to myself, I could no longer lend the
legitimacy to this institution that my being enrolled here
provides.
Friends and family pleaded with me to at least finish
out the quarter; but having seen things asclearly as I did,
I felt I must act immediately — before all the old habits,
conditioned fears, and outside pressures pushed me
back into the same old groove where tunnel vision and
narrowly "rational" action prevail.
Time has thus far rewarded me for my decision; drop
ping out of school has been a tremendously liberating
experience. It has clarified and illuminated a great many
things about myself and my relationship to the world
around me. I have never felt such a deep sense of integ
rity, wholeness and peace with myself.
Observing the rat race
I feel I have finally gotten out of the cage I was first put
into back in elementary school. I have removed myself
from the Rat Race: the race in which one has to worry
about one's every move in terms of how it will look on
The Transcript; the race that turns people into com
petitors, functions, stepping stones, cogs, sex objects,
and simple non-persons; the race fueled by alcohol,
valium, cars, caffeine, cocaine, television and other
drugs; the race in which the addicted, the slow, the
weak, the sensitive, the "insane," the old, the crippled,
the lonely, the freaks, the ragged, the impoverished —
all the "Useless Ones," created more often than not by
the race itself — are simply trampled upon; the race
which knows no end until death do us part.
Now that I have dropped out of the race and climbed
up into the grandstands to get an overview of the whole
carnival, I am truly astounded at just what a ghastly,
absurd, and cruel affair it really is. From up here, it
becomes clear that the King truly has no clothes on. Even
at Stanford, the well-protected maze preparing tomor
row's Head Rats for the unreal Real World, one is treated
to the pathetic spectacle of bright, talented people
grovelling in the dust in the most humiliating fashion for
a few extra points on a lousy test. (I've done it too.)
Performing for prizes
The buzzing one hears from those who are not actu
ally in the dust all seems to be about the same subject,
grades, and everyone is always anxiously consulting
their scorecards. One would think this an educational
institution that is supposed to challenge one with the
wisdom of the ages; but apparently it is just a gameshow
where one consumes as many facts as fast as possible,
spits them out on little pieces of paper, and then forgets
them just as quickly. The prizes are sponsored by Pre
stigious Professional Schools and Big Daddy Corpora
tions. A few people are off to the side, trying to avoid the
game, but they are constantly distracted by the din of

competition.
Professors are likewise caught, although in a some
what more advanced game. Tenure must be gotten;
one's professional standing must be kept up; one's
power in the University must be extended. So one cor
ners some minute, "safe" portion of the academic field;
one competes with one's "colleagues"; one staves off
grasping students so one can get back to one's research.
Backstage, families must be supported, taxes paid.
The administrators and trustees coordinate the Little
Came at Stanford with the Big Came of the Real World.
Administrators are simply the managers, the executives
of University Incorporated; the trustees, the stockhol
ders. Stanford trades in technological stock and skilled
bondsmen; "corporate contributions" are its commis
sion for this service. Cone is the "cathedral of learning";
knowledge has become another big business.
Global games of greed
Many of these games might be harmless enough in
and of themselves, but they become deeply disturbing
when, gazing over the entire global field, one observes
that half the participants do not even have enough food
to eat; that the stadium as a whole is overflowing with
people and more keep entering all the time; that despite
repeated announcements over the loudspeaker that we
are running out of resources, 6 per cent of the people
continue consuming a third of them and keep clammer
ing for more; that a thick haze is setting in making
breathing more and more difficult; and that — most
frightening of all — everyone in sight is procuring these
absolutely insane little "toys," a few of which could blow
up the entire stadium.
Apocalypse'has arrived
Why is it that so many of us are resisting the increas
ingly obvious: these "games" we are playing are seri
ously threatening the survival of life on this planet?
Could it be that we are so intent on our own advance
ment that we cannot even conceive of that which might
interfere with it? Could it be that we subconsciously
realize that if we were truly to comprehend present
global trends, we might have to fundamentally change
our plans and lifestyles? Could it be we are unwiliing to
change?
For, change we must, and radically so. To say that we
will change when and if circumstances demand it shows
that we have not even begun to understand what is
going on in the world. For two billion people suffering
from malnutrition or actually starving, the Apocalypse is
not some vague possibility in the distant future; it has
already arrived. If you have been to New York City or any
of the other decaying Northeastern and Midwestern
cities recently, you might say the same about them:
mass neurosis is bordering on mass psychosis.
Solution within self
"Okay, okay," we cry, "What is the solution? What is
the solution?" If that is all we can cry, then I suggest we
look again: obviously, we still have not comprehended
things as they really are. And I do not just mean things as
they appear on the charts, in the books, but the human
costs as well. For once we look at the whole picture, the
human as well as the statistical, and let this knowledge
pervade our whole beings, we shall have been trans
formed, and the solution will become obvious: it lies
within ourselves.
In short, it lies within each and every one of us taking
full responsibility for what is going on in the world. For
the present mess is being caused by our greed and
ambition, by our insistence on buying junk we don't
need, by our driving when we could be bicycling, by our
insistence on eating resource-inefficient meat when we
would probably be doing better without it, and by our
going to work for and profiting from a system hell-bent
on its own and everyone else's destruction.
Realize our unity
Although an audience as supposedly "sophisticated"
as the Stanford one may find it a little silly and simplistic,
it must be said that in the end the only way we are really
going to come to grips with our present dilemma is when
each of us begins to realize his fundamental unity and

connectedness, when each of us begins to grow in love,
godliness, oneness, wholism, or whatever name one
wants to give it.
For only with such a wholistic approach can we hope
to deal with our problems without creating new ones,
While many solutions will have to be in part technical
and utilize professional skills, it is precisely the narrowly
technological outlook and fragmented approach that
have to a great extent brought us to this maelstrom.
We all have it within us not only to grow, but, indeed,
to realize the fullness of love, oneness, "God — again,
whatever you want to call it. It is a lifetime of condition
ing, conditioning in fear, greed, ambition, competitive
ness, nationalism, racism, sexism, future-orientation,
etc., that is preventing that potential from being
realized. Only by coming to see and understand how
deep this conditioning goes and how it operates in our
daily lives, can we begin to liberate ourselves from it. In
the timeless words of Socrates: Know Thyself.
Creative energy sapped
Certainly not everyone needs to drop out of Stanford
to further themselves along the road to self-discovery
... but I did. Only now am I fully realizing just how
destructive the anxiety of grades and the obsession with
personal achievement has been to my natural love of
learning (which I now see has been part of my difficulty
in writing papers). We generally fail to realize how sensi
tive we are to the internal conflict created by being
involved in things (like Stanford) we do not fully believe
in and how much this conflict saps creative energy.
As for the future: I find myself worrying less and less
about it. This mad quest for security most Stanford stu
dents are engaged in is pure illusion. No one is going to
be able to escape the global chaos that seems at this
point inevitable, not to mention the chaos the Rat Race is
wreaking in people's lives every day. There are alterna
tives to working in "the System," and where they do not
exist, we must create them.
Hitchhiking through life
It was through hitchhiking that I first understood the
inherent insecurity of existence, and by embracing this
fact, instead of trying to escape it, that I first experienced
some of the ecstasy of a "be here now" existence.
Life really is like a hitchhiking trip: one has both good
and bad luck, the weather can be fickle and extreme,
and one never knows what kind of experience one's
next "ride" is going to bring. But it is a trip that leads
inexorably to death, so unless one enjoys the scenery
along the way, one finds that one has gone nowhere at
all.
More and more in my "hitchhike" through life, I find
myself wanting to divert the eyes of my "drivers" from
their hypnotic fixation on the macadam highway before
them to point out the incredible vistas all around the
road: the green pastures, the gently rolling hills, and far
off in the distance, the rugged, muscular mountains,
streaming sunlight making their snowy peaks almost too
brilliant to look at.
Road to success?
But the very few drivers who dare to take their eyes off
the road for even a moment, usually snap their gaze
immediately back to the dull gray ribbon before them.
For what I forgot to tell them was that in order to see all
this majestic scenery, they first had to be confronted
with the huge, desperately-pleading eyes of . . . the
wretched, the lonely, the forgotten, and most of all the
dead, staring at us from the gutters alongside the road.
After such a traumatic experience most drivers are
afraid to even look in the rear view mirror lest they catch
sight of themselves and see dancing in their eyes the
same horrors. With renewed concentration and deter
mination, they push down hard on the accelerator, pas
sing every car in sight, hoping to arrive in a nowhere land
beyond the roadside of suffering humanity, the whole
time keeping their eyes riveted on the road ahead, the
road to "success," the "safe" road, the road that really
runs six feet under . . . the road of being a Stanford
student.

Three weeks before the end of last quarter, I dropped
out of this University with the intention of never return
ing again. Shortly after I made my decision, I was invited
by the editor to discuss my action in these pages. I had to
seriously question whether such a discussion would in
any way benefit the Stanford community or if it would
not perhaps only serve as an exercise in self
gratification.
For, in many ways my decision to leave school has
been a highly personal one; surely many other students
are making such decisions all the time without all the
fanfare of announcing it to the world through the school
paper. Furthermore, many of the things I must necessar
ily say about my decision can ultimately only be expres
sed through my entire being, and not in mere words.

perhaps stimulate in those for whom "all's well" at this
University, a little reflection. Finally, I take solace in the
words of anti-war activist Daniel Berrigan, who once
said, "I'd rather be sorry for something I did, than some
thing I didn't do."
Crisis penetrates habits
Each of us has untapped potentials. But we are "crea
tures of habit," and — in Western culture in general, and
at Stanford in particular — of hyper-rationality. Some
times it takes a powerful personal crisis to break through
our walls of habit and rationality in order to realize more
fully our potentials.
It was through just such a crisis that I arrived at the idea
of dropping out of Stanford. Though precipitated by a
human ailment even the most Utopian of societies prob
ably will not be able to cure — shall we say, "matters of
the heart"— I soon found my interior dams crumbling,
and all kinds of things flooded into my awareness at
once.
I had just spent the previous few days writing and
re-writing a "Daily" column on "What It Means to Be a
Radical." I became plagued with a sense of hypocrisy,
feeling I was not fully living up toall the convictions I had
expressed in the article. Like many fellow activists, I had
been feeling a tremendous tension all quarter between
schoolwork and political organizing; I felt I was not
doing either very well.
Haunted by failure
One aspect of schoolwork has always been for me a
tremendous struggle — writing papers — and I was in
the middle of attempting to write one at the time; not
surprisingly, under the conditions, with little success.
Sinking lower and lower, my entire American hyper
success-oriented conditioning rose up to haunt me: I
was feeling like a complete failure.
Failure, of course, is relative to one's standards of
success. But in a profit-maximizing society that keeps
everyone running ever faster by dangling the carrot of
satisfaction just out of reach, where all the "success" in
the world is never really enough, even the smallest step
"backwards" can be traumatic. One feels completely
isolated; for, we are all competing in a poker game in
which no one lets on that they, too, sometimes come up
with a bad hand.
At the bottom of my crisis, in the depths of despair, my
chaotic thoughts finally crystalized into thesequestions:
"Should my personal success be my greatest concern? Is
individual achievement what it is all about? Or is it this
very focus that prevents me from exploring the pos
sibilities in what I feel in fact is most important in life:
sharing with others?" To an extent merely posing such
abstract questions in print cannot convey, I felt my
whole being struggling with them.
Obsessed with success
just when I thought I was at my wits' end, everything
suddenly became clear: it is precisely this whole obses
sion with personal success, and achievement in general,
that is pushing our planet ever and ever closer to the
brink of total disaster. I found myself going beyond
merely "seeing" our mad onrush towards some kind of
holocaust; in a way I cannot really describe, I was "ex
periencing'' apocalyptic visions: everything from T.S.

EHot's "wasteland," to nuclear warfare, to the Fall of
Western Civilization.
Furthermore, I realized more clearly than I ever had
before that Stanford embodies and plays a crucial role in
a global system and a way of life that is destructive to
human flesh and spirit. I saw that not only were others
being harmed, but that I, myself, for all my critical at
titude, could not remain unaffected by the competitive
ness, the grade-grubbing, the obsession with future go
als, the personal ambition, the material extravagance,
the alienation and the passivity one finds at Stanford.
It is the obsession with personal success and
achievement that creates the energy to keep the Big
Wheel turning. Fear is the watchword. Keep everyone
terrified of failing and they will run faster and faster on
the treadmill. In the face of an economic recession, fear
turns into panic; students cling to the biggest, strongest
wooden horses (the "professions"), lest they spin off
the merry-go-round altogether.
Everyone takes only those courses, answers only
those test questions, writes only those papers they are
sure will produce the Almighty "A." Creativity, with its
attendant element of risk, gets thrown out the window
in the frantic search for a safe corner to hide in.
Liberated by dropping out
People tell me I'm crazy to be dropping out of school
when I could be getting my degree in a couple of quar
ters. But something in me, in the midst of that crisis,
snapped, while something else gelled: I found that in
order to be true to myself, I could no longer lend the
legitimacy to this institution that my being enrolled here
provides.
Friends and family pleaded with me to at least finish
out the quarter; but having seen things asclearly as I did,
I felt I must act immediately — before all the old habits,
conditioned fears, and outside pressures pushed me
back into the same old groove where tunnel vision and
narrowly "rational" action prevail.
Time has thus far rewarded me for my decision; drop
ping out of school has been a tremendously liberating
experience. It has clarified and illuminated a great many
things about myself and my relationship to the world
around me. I have never felt such a deep sense of integ
rity, wholeness and peace with myself.
Observing the rat race
I feel I have finally gotten out of the cage I was first put
into back in elementary school. I have removed myself
from the Rat Race: the race in which one has to worry
about one's every move in terms of how it will look on
The Transcript; the race that turns people into com
petitors, functions, stepping stones, cogs, sex objects,
and simple non-persons; the race fueled by alcohol,
valium, cars, caffeine, cocaine, television and other
drugs; the race in which the addicted, the slow, the
weak, the sensitive, the "insane," the old, the crippled,
the lonely, the freaks, the ragged, the impoverished —
all the "Useless Ones," created more often than not by
the race itself — are simply trampled upon; the race
which knows no end until death do us part.
Now that I have dropped out of the race and climbed
up into the grandstands to get an overview of the whole
carnival, I am truly astounded at just what a ghastly,
absurd, and cruel affair it really is. From up here, it
becomes clear that the King truly has no clothes on. Even
at Stanford, the well-protected maze preparing tomor
row's Head Rats for the unreal Real World, one is treated
to the pathetic spectacle of bright, talented people
grovelling in the dust in the most humiliating fashion for
a few extra points on a lousy test. (I've done it too.)
Performing for prizes
The buzzing one hears from those who are not actu
ally in the dust all seems to be about the same subject,
grades, and everyone is always anxiously consulting
their scorecards. One would think this an educational
institution that is supposed to challenge one with the
wisdom of the ages; but apparently it is just a gameshow
where one consumes as many facts as fast as possible,
spits them out on little pieces of paper, and then forgets
them just as quickly. The prizes are sponsored by Pre
stigious Professional Schools and Big Daddy Corpora
tions. A few people are off to the side, trying to avoid the
game, but they are constantly distracted by the din of

competition.
Professors are likewise caught, although in a some
what more advanced game. Tenure must be gotten;
one's professional standing must be kept up; one's
power in the University must be extended. So one cor
ners some minute, "safe" portion of the academic field;
one competes with one's "colleagues"; one staves off
grasping students so one can get back to one's research.
Backstage, families must be supported, taxes paid.
The administrators and trustees coordinate the Little
Came at Stanford with the Big Came of the Real World.
Administrators are simply the managers, the executives
of University Incorporated; the trustees, the stockhol
ders. Stanford trades in technological stock and skilled
bondsmen; "corporate contributions" are its commis
sion for this service. Cone is the "cathedral of learning";
knowledge has become another big business.
Global games of greed
Many of these games might be harmless enough in
and of themselves, but they become deeply disturbing
when, gazing over the entire global field, one observes
that half the participants do not even have enough food
to eat; that the stadium as a whole is overflowing with
people and more keep entering all the time; that despite
repeated announcements over the loudspeaker that we
are running out of resources, 6 per cent of the people
continue consuming a third of them and keep clammer
ing for more; that a thick haze is setting in making
breathing more and more difficult; and that — most
frightening of all — everyone in sight is procuring these
absolutely insane little "toys," a few of which could blow
up the entire stadium.
Apocalypse'has arrived
Why is it that so many of us are resisting the increas
ingly obvious: these "games" we are playing are seri
ously threatening the survival of life on this planet?
Could it be that we are so intent on our own advance
ment that we cannot even conceive of that which might
interfere with it? Could it be that we subconsciously
realize that if we were truly to comprehend present
global trends, we might have to fundamentally change
our plans and lifestyles? Could it be we are unwiliing to
change?
For, change we must, and radically so. To say that we
will change when and if circumstances demand it shows
that we have not even begun to understand what is
going on in the world. For two billion people suffering
from malnutrition or actually starving, the Apocalypse is
not some vague possibility in the distant future; it has
already arrived. If you have been to New York City or any
of the other decaying Northeastern and Midwestern
cities recently, you might say the same about them:
mass neurosis is bordering on mass psychosis.
Solution within self
"Okay, okay," we cry, "What is the solution? What is
the solution?" If that is all we can cry, then I suggest we
look again: obviously, we still have not comprehended
things as they really are. And I do not just mean things as
they appear on the charts, in the books, but the human
costs as well. For once we look at the whole picture, the
human as well as the statistical, and let this knowledge
pervade our whole beings, we shall have been trans
formed, and the solution will become obvious: it lies
within ourselves.
In short, it lies within each and every one of us taking
full responsibility for what is going on in the world. For
the present mess is being caused by our greed and
ambition, by our insistence on buying junk we don't
need, by our driving when we could be bicycling, by our
insistence on eating resource-inefficient meat when we
would probably be doing better without it, and by our
going to work for and profiting from a system hell-bent
on its own and everyone else's destruction.
Realize our unity
Although an audience as supposedly "sophisticated"
as the Stanford one may find it a little silly and simplistic,
it must be said that in the end the only way we are really
going to come to grips with our present dilemma is when
each of us begins to realize his fundamental unity and

connectedness, when each of us begins to grow in love,
godliness, oneness, wholism, or whatever name one
wants to give it.
For only with such a wholistic approach can we hope
to deal with our problems without creating new ones,
While many solutions will have to be in part technical
and utilize professional skills, it is precisely the narrowly
technological outlook and fragmented approach that
have to a great extent brought us to this maelstrom.
We all have it within us not only to grow, but, indeed,
to realize the fullness of love, oneness, "God — again,
whatever you want to call it. It is a lifetime of condition
ing, conditioning in fear, greed, ambition, competitive
ness, nationalism, racism, sexism, future-orientation,
etc., that is preventing that potential from being
realized. Only by coming to see and understand how
deep this conditioning goes and how it operates in our
daily lives, can we begin to liberate ourselves from it. In
the timeless words of Socrates: Know Thyself.
Creative energy sapped
Certainly not everyone needs to drop out of Stanford
to further themselves along the road to self-discovery
... but I did. Only now am I fully realizing just how
destructive the anxiety of grades and the obsession with
personal achievement has been to my natural love of
learning (which I now see has been part of my difficulty
in writing papers). We generally fail to realize how sensi
tive we are to the internal conflict created by being
involved in things (like Stanford) we do not fully believe
in and how much this conflict saps creative energy.
As for the future: I find myself worrying less and less
about it. This mad quest for security most Stanford stu
dents are engaged in is pure illusion. No one is going to
be able to escape the global chaos that seems at this
point inevitable, not to mention the chaos the Rat Race is
wreaking in people's lives every day. There are alterna
tives to working in "the System," and where they do not
exist, we must create them.
Hitchhiking through life
It was through hitchhiking that I first understood the
inherent insecurity of existence, and by embracing this
fact, instead of trying to escape it, that I first experienced
some of the ecstasy of a "be here now" existence.
Life really is like a hitchhiking trip: one has both good
and bad luck, the weather can be fickle and extreme,
and one never knows what kind of experience one's
next "ride" is going to bring. But it is a trip that leads
inexorably to death, so unless one enjoys the scenery
along the way, one finds that one has gone nowhere at
all.
More and more in my "hitchhike" through life, I find
myself wanting to divert the eyes of my "drivers" from
their hypnotic fixation on the macadam highway before
them to point out the incredible vistas all around the
road: the green pastures, the gently rolling hills, and far
off in the distance, the rugged, muscular mountains,
streaming sunlight making their snowy peaks almost too
brilliant to look at.
Road to success?
But the very few drivers who dare to take their eyes off
the road for even a moment, usually snap their gaze
immediately back to the dull gray ribbon before them.
For what I forgot to tell them was that in order to see all
this majestic scenery, they first had to be confronted
with the huge, desperately-pleading eyes of . . . the
wretched, the lonely, the forgotten, and most of all the
dead, staring at us from the gutters alongside the road.
After such a traumatic experience most drivers are
afraid to even look in the rear view mirror lest they catch
sight of themselves and see dancing in their eyes the
same horrors. With renewed concentration and deter
mination, they push down hard on the accelerator, pas
sing every car in sight, hoping to arrive in a nowhere land
beyond the roadside of suffering humanity, the whole
time keeping their eyes riveted on the road ahead, the
road to "success," the "safe" road, the road that really
runs six feet under . . . the road of being a Stanford
student.

Three weeks before the end of last quarter, I dropped
out of this University with the intention of never return
ing again. Shortly after I made my decision, I was invited
by the editor to discuss my action in these pages. I had to
seriously question whether such a discussion would in
any way benefit the Stanford community or if it would
not perhaps only serve as an exercise in self
gratification.
For, in many ways my decision to leave school has
been a highly personal one; surely many other students
are making such decisions all the time without all the
fanfare of announcing it to the world through the school
paper. Furthermore, many of the things I must necessar
ily say about my decision can ultimately only be expres
sed through my entire being, and not in mere words.
In the end I decided to accept the invitation, however
inadequate my words may be, in the hope that I may be
of some aid toothers consideringa similar move . . .and
perhaps stimulate in those for whom "all's well" at this
University, a little reflection. Finally, I take solace in the
words of anti-war activist Daniel Berrigan, who once

Each of us has untapped potentials. But we are "crea
tures of habit," and — in Western culture in general, and
at Stanford in particular — of hyper-rationality. Some
times it takes a powerful personal crisis to break through
our walls of habit and rationality in order to realize more
fully our potentials.
It was through just such a crisis that I arrived at the idea
of dropping out of Stanford. Though precipitated by a
human ailment even the most Utopian of societies prob
ably will not be able to cure — shall we say, "matters of
the heart"— I soon found my interior dams crumbling,
and all kinds of things flooded into my awareness at
once.
I had just spent the previous few days writing and
re-writing a "Daily" column on "What It Means to Be a
Radical." I became plagued with a sense of hypocrisy,
feeling I was not fully living up toall the convictions I had
expressed in the article. Like many fellow activists, I had
been feeling a tremendous tension all quarter between
schoolwork and political organizing; I felt I was not
doing either very well.
Haunted by failure
One aspect of schoolwork has always been for me a
tremendous struggle — writing papers — and I was in
the middle of attempting to write one at the time; not
surprisingly, under the conditions, with little success.
Sinking lower and lower, my entire American hyper
success-oriented conditioning rose up to haunt me: I
was feeling like a complete failure.
Failure, of course, is relative to one's standards of
success. But in a profit-maximizing society that keeps
everyone running ever faster by dangling the carrot of
satisfaction just out of reach, where all the "success" in
the world is never really enough, even the smallest step
"backwards" can be traumatic. One feels completely
isolated; for, we are all competing in a poker game in
which no one lets on that they, too, sometimes come up
with a bad hand.
At the bottom of my crisis, in the depths of despair, my
chaotic thoughts finally crystalized into thesequestions:
"Should my personal success be my greatest concern? Is
individual achievement what it is all about? Or is it this
very focus that prevents me from exploring the pos
sibilities in what I feel in fact is most important in life:
sharing with others?" To an extent merely posing such
abstract questions in print cannot convey, I felt my
whole being struggling with them.
Obsessed with success
just when I thought I was at my wits' end, everything
suddenly became clear: it is precisely this whole obses
sion with personal success, and achievement in general,
that is pushing our planet ever and ever closer to the
brink of total disaster. I found myself going beyond
merely "seeing" our mad onrush towards some kind of
holocaust; in a way I cannot really describe, I was "ex
periencing'' apocalyptic visions: everything from T.S.

EHot's "wasteland," to nuclear warfare, to the Fall of
Western Civilization.
Furthermore, I realized more clearly than I ever had
before that Stanford embodies and plays a crucial role in
a global system and a way of life that is destructive to
human flesh and spirit. I saw that not only were others
being harmed, but that I, myself, for all my critical at
titude, could not remain unaffected by the competitive
ness, the grade-grubbing, the obsession with future go
als, the personal ambition, the material extravagance,
the alienation and the passivity one finds at Stanford.
It is the obsession with personal success and
achievement that creates the energy to keep the Big
Wheel turning. Fear is the watchword. Keep everyone
terrified of failing and they will run faster and faster on
the treadmill. In the face of an economic recession, fear
turns into panic; students cling to the biggest, strongest
wooden horses (the "professions"), lest they spin off
the merry-go-round altogether.
Everyone takes only those courses, answers only
those test questions, writes only those papers they are
sure will produce the Almighty "A." Creativity, with its
attendant element of risk, gets thrown out the window
in the frantic search for a safe corner to hide in.
Liberated by dropping out
People tell me I'm crazy to be dropping out of school
when I could be getting my degree in a couple of quar
ters. But something in me, in the midst of that crisis,
snapped, while something else gelled: I found that in
order to be true to myself, I could no longer lend the
legitimacy to this institution that my being enrolled here
provides.
Friends and family pleaded with me to at least finish
out the quarter; but having seen things asclearly as I did,
I felt I must act immediately — before all the old habits,
conditioned fears, and outside pressures pushed me
back into the same old groove where tunnel vision and
narrowly "rational" action prevail.
Time has thus far rewarded me for my decision; drop
ping out of school has been a tremendously liberating
experience. It has clarified and illuminated a great many
things about myself and my relationship to the world
around me. I have never felt such a deep sense of integ
rity, wholeness and peace with myself.
Observing the rat race
I feel I have finally gotten out of the cage I was first put
into back in elementary school. I have removed myself
from the Rat Race: the race in which one has to worry
about one's every move in terms of how it will look on
The Transcript; the race that turns people into com
petitors, functions, stepping stones, cogs, sex objects,
and simple non-persons; the race fueled by alcohol,
valium, cars, caffeine, cocaine, television and other
drugs; the race in which the addicted, the slow, the
weak, the sensitive, the "insane," the old, the crippled,
the lonely, the freaks, the ragged, the impoverished —
all the "Useless Ones," created more often than not by
the race itself — are simply trampled upon; the race
which knows no end until death do us part.
Now that I have dropped out of the race and climbed
up into the grandstands to get an overview of the whole
carnival, I am truly astounded at just what a ghastly,
absurd, and cruel affair it really is. From up here, it
becomes clear that the King truly has no clothes on. Even
at Stanford, the well-protected maze preparing tomor
row's Head Rats for the unreal Real World, one is treated
to the pathetic spectacle of bright, talented people
grovelling in the dust in the most humiliating fashion for
a few extra points on a lousy test. (I've done it too.)
Performing for prizes
The buzzing one hears from those who are not actu
ally in the dust all seems to be about the same subject,
grades, and everyone is always anxiously consulting
their scorecards. One would think this an educational
institution that is supposed to challenge one with the
wisdom of the ages; but apparently it is just a gameshow
where one consumes as many facts as fast as possible,
spits them out on little pieces of paper, and then forgets
them just as quickly. The prizes are sponsored by Pre
stigious Professional Schools and Big Daddy Corpora
tions. A few people are off to the side, trying to avoid the
game, but they are constantly distracted by the din of

competition.
Professors are likewise caught, although in a some
what more advanced game. Tenure must be gotten;
one's professional standing must be kept up; one's
power in the University must be extended. So one cor
ners some minute, "safe" portion of the academic field;
one competes with one's "colleagues"; one staves off
grasping students so one can get back to one's research.
Backstage, families must be supported, taxes paid.
The administrators and trustees coordinate the Little
Came at Stanford with the Big Came of the Real World.
Administrators are simply the managers, the executives
of University Incorporated; the trustees, the stockhol
ders. Stanford trades in technological stock and skilled
bondsmen; "corporate contributions" are its commis
sion for this service. Cone is the "cathedral of learning";
knowledge has become another big business.
Global games of greed
Many of these games might be harmless enough in
and of themselves, but they become deeply disturbing
when, gazing over the entire global field, one observes
that half the participants do not even have enough food
to eat; that the stadium as a whole is overflowing with
people and more keep entering all the time; that despite
repeated announcements over the loudspeaker that we
are running out of resources, 6 per cent of the people
continue consuming a third of them and keep clammer
ing for more; that a thick haze is setting in making
breathing more and more difficult; and that — most
frightening of all — everyone in sight is procuring these
absolutely insane little "toys," a few of which could blow
up the entire stadium.
Apocalypse'has arrived
Why is it that so many of us are resisting the increas
ingly obvious: these "games" we are playing are seri
ously threatening the survival of life on this planet?
Could it be that we are so intent on our own advance
ment that we cannot even conceive of that which might
interfere with it? Could it be that we subconsciously
realize that if we were truly to comprehend present
global trends, we might have to fundamentally change
our plans and lifestyles? Could it be we are unwiliing to
change?
For, change we must, and radically so. To say that we
will change when and if circumstances demand it shows
that we have not even begun to understand what is
going on in the world. For two billion people suffering
from malnutrition or actually starving, the Apocalypse is
not some vague possibility in the distant future; it has
already arrived. If you have been to New York City or any
of the other decaying Northeastern and Midwestern
cities recently, you might say the same about them:
mass neurosis is bordering on mass psychosis.
Solution within self
"Okay, okay," we cry, "What is the solution? What is
the solution?" If that is all we can cry, then I suggest we
look again: obviously, we still have not comprehended
things as they really are. And I do not just mean things as
they appear on the charts, in the books, but the human
costs as well. For once we look at the whole picture, the
human as well as the statistical, and let this knowledge
pervade our whole beings, we shall have been trans
formed, and the solution will become obvious: it lies
within ourselves.
In short, it lies within each and every one of us taking
full responsibility for what is going on in the world. For
the present mess is being caused by our greed and
ambition, by our insistence on buying junk we don't
need, by our driving when we could be bicycling, by our
insistence on eating resource-inefficient meat when we
would probably be doing better without it, and by our
going to work for and profiting from a system hell-bent
on its own and everyone else's destruction.
Realize our unity
Although an audience as supposedly "sophisticated"
as the Stanford one may find it a little silly and simplistic,
it must be said that in the end the only way we are really
going to come to grips with our present dilemma is when
each of us begins to realize his fundamental unity and

connectedness, when each of us begins to grow in love,
godliness, oneness, wholism, or whatever name one
wants to give it.
For only with such a wholistic approach can we hope
to deal with our problems without creating new ones,
While many solutions will have to be in part technical
and utilize professional skills, it is precisely the narrowly
technological outlook and fragmented approach that
have to a great extent brought us to this maelstrom.
We all have it within us not only to grow, but, indeed,
to realize the fullness of love, oneness, "God — again,
whatever you want to call it. It is a lifetime of condition
ing, conditioning in fear, greed, ambition, competitive
ness, nationalism, racism, sexism, future-orientation,
etc., that is preventing that potential from being
realized. Only by coming to see and understand how
deep this conditioning goes and how it operates in our
daily lives, can we begin to liberate ourselves from it. In
the timeless words of Socrates: Know Thyself.
Creative energy sapped
Certainly not everyone needs to drop out of Stanford
to further themselves along the road to self-discovery
... but I did. Only now am I fully realizing just how
destructive the anxiety of grades and the obsession with
personal achievement has been to my natural love of
learning (which I now see has been part of my difficulty
in writing papers). We generally fail to realize how sensi
tive we are to the internal conflict created by being
involved in things (like Stanford) we do not fully believe
in and how much this conflict saps creative energy.
As for the future: I find myself worrying less and less
about it. This mad quest for security most Stanford stu
dents are engaged in is pure illusion. No one is going to
be able to escape the global chaos that seems at this
point inevitable, not to mention the chaos the Rat Race is
wreaking in people's lives every day. There are alterna
tives to working in "the System," and where they do not
exist, we must create them.
Hitchhiking through life
It was through hitchhiking that I first understood the
inherent insecurity of existence, and by embracing this
fact, instead of trying to escape it, that I first experienced
some of the ecstasy of a "be here now" existence.
Life really is like a hitchhiking trip: one has both good
and bad luck, the weather can be fickle and extreme,
and one never knows what kind of experience one's
next "ride" is going to bring. But it is a trip that leads
inexorably to death, so unless one enjoys the scenery
along the way, one finds that one has gone nowhere at
all.
More and more in my "hitchhike" through life, I find
myself wanting to divert the eyes of my "drivers" from
their hypnotic fixation on the macadam highway before
them to point out the incredible vistas all around the
road: the green pastures, the gently rolling hills, and far
off in the distance, the rugged, muscular mountains,
streaming sunlight making their snowy peaks almost too
brilliant to look at.
Road to success?
But the very few drivers who dare to take their eyes off
the road for even a moment, usually snap their gaze
immediately back to the dull gray ribbon before them.
For what I forgot to tell them was that in order to see all
this majestic scenery, they first had to be confronted
with the huge, desperately-pleading eyes of . . . the
wretched, the lonely, the forgotten, and most of all the
dead, staring at us from the gutters alongside the road.
After such a traumatic experience most drivers are
afraid to even look in the rear view mirror lest they catch
sight of themselves and see dancing in their eyes the
same horrors. With renewed concentration and deter
mination, they push down hard on the accelerator, pas
sing every car in sight, hoping to arrive in a nowhere land
beyond the roadside of suffering humanity, the whole
time keeping their eyes riveted on the road ahead, the
road to "success," the "safe" road, the road that really
runs six feet under . . . the road of being a Stanford
student.

Three weeks before the end of last quarter, I dropped
out of this University with the intention of never return
ing again. Shortly after I made my decision, I was invited
by the editor to discuss my action in these pages. I had to
seriously question whether such a discussion would in
any way benefit the Stanford community or if it would
not perhaps only serve as an exercise in self
gratification.
For, in many ways my decision to leave school has
been a highly personal one; surely many other students
are making such decisions all the time without all the
fanfare of announcing it to the world through the school
paper. Furthermore, many of the things I must necessar
ily say about my decision can ultimately only be expres
sed through my entire being, and not in mere words.
In the end I decided to accept the invitation, however
inadequate my words may be, in the hope that I may be
of some aid toothers consideringa similar move . . .and
perhaps stimulate in those for whom "all's well" at this
University, a little reflection. Finally, I take solace in the
words of anti-war activist Daniel Berrigan, who once
said, "I'd rather be sorry for something I did, than some
thing I didn't do."

of dropping out of Stanford. Though precipitated by a
human ailment even the most Utopian of societies prob
ably will not be able to cure — shall we say, "matters of
the heart"— I soon found my interior dams crumbling,
and all kinds of things flooded into my awareness at
once.
I had just spent the previous few days writing and
re-writing a "Daily" column on "What It Means to Be a
Radical." I became plagued with a sense of hypocrisy,
feeling I was not fully living up toall the convictions I had
expressed in the article. Like many fellow activists, I had
been feeling a tremendous tension all quarter between
schoolwork and political organizing; I felt I was not
doing either very well.
Haunted by failure
One aspect of schoolwork has always been for me a
tremendous struggle — writing papers — and I was in
the middle of attempting to write one at the time; not
surprisingly, under the conditions, with little success.
Sinking lower and lower, my entire American hyper
success-oriented conditioning rose up to haunt me: I
was feeling like a complete failure.
Failure, of course, is relative to one's standards of
success. But in a profit-maximizing society that keeps
everyone running ever faster by dangling the carrot of
satisfaction just out of reach, where all the "success" in
the world is never really enough, even the smallest step
"backwards" can be traumatic. One feels completely
isolated; for, we are all competing in a poker game in
which no one lets on that they, too, sometimes come up
with a bad hand.
At the bottom of my crisis, in the depths of despair, my
chaotic thoughts finally crystalized into thesequestions:
"Should my personal success be my greatest concern? Is
individual achievement what it is all about? Or is it this
very focus that prevents me from exploring the pos
sibilities in what I feel in fact is most important in life:
sharing with others?" To an extent merely posing such
abstract questions in print cannot convey, I felt my
whole being struggling with them.
Obsessed with success
just when I thought I was at my wits' end, everything
suddenly became clear: it is precisely this whole obses
sion with personal success, and achievement in general,
that is pushing our planet ever and ever closer to the
brink of total disaster. I found myself going beyond
merely "seeing" our mad onrush towards some kind of
holocaust; in a way I cannot really describe, I was "ex
periencing'' apocalyptic visions: everything from T.S.

EHot's "wasteland," to nuclear warfare, to the Fall of
Western Civilization.
Furthermore, I realized more clearly than I ever had
before that Stanford embodies and plays a crucial role in
a global system and a way of life that is destructive to
human flesh and spirit. I saw that not only were others
being harmed, but that I, myself, for all my critical at
titude, could not remain unaffected by the competitive
ness, the grade-grubbing, the obsession with future go
als, the personal ambition, the material extravagance,
the alienation and the passivity one finds at Stanford.
It is the obsession with personal success and
achievement that creates the energy to keep the Big
Wheel turning. Fear is the watchword. Keep everyone
terrified of failing and they will run faster and faster on
the treadmill. In the face of an economic recession, fear
turns into panic; students cling to the biggest, strongest
wooden horses (the "professions"), lest they spin off
the merry-go-round altogether.
Everyone takes only those courses, answers only
those test questions, writes only those papers they are
sure will produce the Almighty "A." Creativity, with its
attendant element of risk, gets thrown out the window
in the frantic search for a safe corner to hide in.
Liberated by dropping out
People tell me I'm crazy to be dropping out of school
when I could be getting my degree in a couple of quar
ters. But something in me, in the midst of that crisis,
snapped, while something else gelled: I found that in
order to be true to myself, I could no longer lend the
legitimacy to this institution that my being enrolled here
provides.
Friends and family pleaded with me to at least finish
out the quarter; but having seen things asclearly as I did,
I felt I must act immediately — before all the old habits,
conditioned fears, and outside pressures pushed me
back into the same old groove where tunnel vision and
narrowly "rational" action prevail.
Time has thus far rewarded me for my decision; drop
ping out of school has been a tremendously liberating
experience. It has clarified and illuminated a great many
things about myself and my relationship to the world
around me. I have never felt such a deep sense of integ
rity, wholeness and peace with myself.
Observing the rat race
I feel I have finally gotten out of the cage I was first put
into back in elementary school. I have removed myself
from the Rat Race: the race in which one has to worry
about one's every move in terms of how it will look on
The Transcript; the race that turns people into com
petitors, functions, stepping stones, cogs, sex objects,
and simple non-persons; the race fueled by alcohol,
valium, cars, caffeine, cocaine, television and other
drugs; the race in which the addicted, the slow, the
weak, the sensitive, the "insane," the old, the crippled,
the lonely, the freaks, the ragged, the impoverished —
all the "Useless Ones," created more often than not by
the race itself — are simply trampled upon; the race
which knows no end until death do us part.
Now that I have dropped out of the race and climbed
up into the grandstands to get an overview of the whole
carnival, I am truly astounded at just what a ghastly,
absurd, and cruel affair it really is. From up here, it
becomes clear that the King truly has no clothes on. Even
at Stanford, the well-protected maze preparing tomor
row's Head Rats for the unreal Real World, one is treated
to the pathetic spectacle of bright, talented people
grovelling in the dust in the most humiliating fashion for
a few extra points on a lousy test. (I've done it too.)
Performing for prizes
The buzzing one hears from those who are not actu
ally in the dust all seems to be about the same subject,
grades, and everyone is always anxiously consulting
their scorecards. One would think this an educational
institution that is supposed to challenge one with the
wisdom of the ages; but apparently it is just a gameshow
where one consumes as many facts as fast as possible,
spits them out on little pieces of paper, and then forgets
them just as quickly. The prizes are sponsored by Pre
stigious Professional Schools and Big Daddy Corpora
tions. A few people are off to the side, trying to avoid the
game, but they are constantly distracted by the din of

competition.
Professors are likewise caught, although in a some
what more advanced game. Tenure must be gotten;
one's professional standing must be kept up; one's
power in the University must be extended. So one cor
ners some minute, "safe" portion of the academic field;
one competes with one's "colleagues"; one staves off
grasping students so one can get back to one's research.
Backstage, families must be supported, taxes paid.
The administrators and trustees coordinate the Little
Came at Stanford with the Big Came of the Real World.
Administrators are simply the managers, the executives
of University Incorporated; the trustees, the stockhol
ders. Stanford trades in technological stock and skilled
bondsmen; "corporate contributions" are its commis
sion for this service. Cone is the "cathedral of learning";
knowledge has become another big business.
Global games of greed
Many of these games might be harmless enough in
and of themselves, but they become deeply disturbing
when, gazing over the entire global field, one observes
that half the participants do not even have enough food
to eat; that the stadium as a whole is overflowing with
people and more keep entering all the time; that despite
repeated announcements over the loudspeaker that we
are running out of resources, 6 per cent of the people
continue consuming a third of them and keep clammer
ing for more; that a thick haze is setting in making
breathing more and more difficult; and that — most
frightening of all — everyone in sight is procuring these
absolutely insane little "toys," a few of which could blow
up the entire stadium.
Apocalypse'has arrived
Why is it that so many of us are resisting the increas
ingly obvious: these "games" we are playing are seri
ously threatening the survival of life on this planet?
Could it be that we are so intent on our own advance
ment that we cannot even conceive of that which might
interfere with it? Could it be that we subconsciously
realize that if we were truly to comprehend present
global trends, we might have to fundamentally change
our plans and lifestyles? Could it be we are unwiliing to
change?
For, change we must, and radically so. To say that we
will change when and if circumstances demand it shows
that we have not even begun to understand what is
going on in the world. For two billion people suffering
from malnutrition or actually starving, the Apocalypse is
not some vague possibility in the distant future; it has
already arrived. If you have been to New York City or any
of the other decaying Northeastern and Midwestern
cities recently, you might say the same about them:
mass neurosis is bordering on mass psychosis.
Solution within self
"Okay, okay," we cry, "What is the solution? What is
the solution?" If that is all we can cry, then I suggest we
look again: obviously, we still have not comprehended
things as they really are. And I do not just mean things as
they appear on the charts, in the books, but the human
costs as well. For once we look at the whole picture, the
human as well as the statistical, and let this knowledge
pervade our whole beings, we shall have been trans
formed, and the solution will become obvious: it lies
within ourselves.
In short, it lies within each and every one of us taking
full responsibility for what is going on in the world. For
the present mess is being caused by our greed and
ambition, by our insistence on buying junk we don't
need, by our driving when we could be bicycling, by our
insistence on eating resource-inefficient meat when we
would probably be doing better without it, and by our
going to work for and profiting from a system hell-bent
on its own and everyone else's destruction.
Realize our unity
Although an audience as supposedly "sophisticated"
as the Stanford one may find it a little silly and simplistic,
it must be said that in the end the only way we are really
going to come to grips with our present dilemma is when
each of us begins to realize his fundamental unity and

connectedness, when each of us begins to grow in love,
godliness, oneness, wholism, or whatever name one
wants to give it.
For only with such a wholistic approach can we hope
to deal with our problems without creating new ones,
While many solutions will have to be in part technical
and utilize professional skills, it is precisely the narrowly
technological outlook and fragmented approach that
have to a great extent brought us to this maelstrom.
We all have it within us not only to grow, but, indeed,
to realize the fullness of love, oneness, "God — again,
whatever you want to call it. It is a lifetime of condition
ing, conditioning in fear, greed, ambition, competitive
ness, nationalism, racism, sexism, future-orientation,
etc., that is preventing that potential from being
realized. Only by coming to see and understand how
deep this conditioning goes and how it operates in our
daily lives, can we begin to liberate ourselves from it. In
the timeless words of Socrates: Know Thyself.
Creative energy sapped
Certainly not everyone needs to drop out of Stanford
to further themselves along the road to self-discovery
... but I did. Only now am I fully realizing just how
destructive the anxiety of grades and the obsession with
personal achievement has been to my natural love of
learning (which I now see has been part of my difficulty
in writing papers). We generally fail to realize how sensi
tive we are to the internal conflict created by being
involved in things (like Stanford) we do not fully believe
in and how much this conflict saps creative energy.
As for the future: I find myself worrying less and less
about it. This mad quest for security most Stanford stu
dents are engaged in is pure illusion. No one is going to
be able to escape the global chaos that seems at this
point inevitable, not to mention the chaos the Rat Race is
wreaking in people's lives every day. There are alterna
tives to working in "the System," and where they do not
exist, we must create them.
Hitchhiking through life
It was through hitchhiking that I first understood the
inherent insecurity of existence, and by embracing this
fact, instead of trying to escape it, that I first experienced
some of the ecstasy of a "be here now" existence.
Life really is like a hitchhiking trip: one has both good
and bad luck, the weather can be fickle and extreme,
and one never knows what kind of experience one's
next "ride" is going to bring. But it is a trip that leads
inexorably to death, so unless one enjoys the scenery
along the way, one finds that one has gone nowhere at
all.
More and more in my "hitchhike" through life, I find
myself wanting to divert the eyes of my "drivers" from
their hypnotic fixation on the macadam highway before
them to point out the incredible vistas all around the
road: the green pastures, the gently rolling hills, and far
off in the distance, the rugged, muscular mountains,
streaming sunlight making their snowy peaks almost too
brilliant to look at.
Road to success?
But the very few drivers who dare to take their eyes off
the road for even a moment, usually snap their gaze
immediately back to the dull gray ribbon before them.
For what I forgot to tell them was that in order to see all
this majestic scenery, they first had to be confronted
with the huge, desperately-pleading eyes of . . . the
wretched, the lonely, the forgotten, and most of all the
dead, staring at us from the gutters alongside the road.
After such a traumatic experience most drivers are
afraid to even look in the rear view mirror lest they catch
sight of themselves and see dancing in their eyes the
same horrors. With renewed concentration and deter
mination, they push down hard on the accelerator, pas
sing every car in sight, hoping to arrive in a nowhere land
beyond the roadside of suffering humanity, the whole
time keeping their eyes riveted on the road ahead, the
road to "success," the "safe" road, the road that really
runs six feet under . . . the road of being a Stanford
student.

Three weeks before the end of last quarter, I dropped
out of this University with the intention of never return
ing again. Shortly after I made my decision, I was invited
by the editor to discuss my action in these pages. I had to
seriously question whether such a discussion would in
any way benefit the Stanford community or if it would
not perhaps only serve as an exercise in self
gratification.
For, in many ways my decision to leave school has
been a highly personal one; surely many other students
are making such decisions all the time without all the
fanfare of announcing it to the world through the school
paper. Furthermore, many of the things I must necessar
ily say about my decision can ultimately only be expres
sed through my entire being, and not in mere words.
In the end I decided to accept the invitation, however
inadequate my words may be, in the hope that I may be
of some aid toothers consideringa similar move . . .and
perhaps stimulate in those for whom "all's well" at this
University, a little reflection. Finally, I take solace in the
words of anti-war activist Daniel Berrigan, who once
said, "I'd rather be sorry for something I did, than some
thing I didn't do."
Crisis penetrates habits
Each of us has untapped potentials. But we are "crea
tures of habit," and — in Western culture in general, and
at Stanford in particular — of hyper-rationality. Some
times it takes a powerful personal crisis to break through
our walls of habit and rationality in order to realize more
fully our potentials.
It was through just such a crisis that I arrived at the idea
of dropping out of Stanford. Though precipitated by a
human ailment even the most Utopian of societies prob
ably will not be able to cure — shall we say, "matters of
the heart"— I soon found my interior dams crumbling,
and all kinds of things flooded into my awareness at

re-writing a "Daily" column on "What It Means to Be a
Radical." I became plagued with a sense of hypocrisy,
feeling I was not fully living up toall the convictions I had
expressed in the article. Like many fellow activists, I had
been feeling a tremendous tension all quarter between
schoolwork and political organizing; I felt I was not
doing either very well.
Haunted by failure
One aspect of schoolwork has always been for me a
tremendous struggle — writing papers — and I was in
the middle of attempting to write one at the time; not
surprisingly, under the conditions, with little success.
Sinking lower and lower, my entire American hyper
success-oriented conditioning rose up to haunt me: I
was feeling like a complete failure.
Failure, of course, is relative to one's standards of
success. But in a profit-maximizing society that keeps
everyone running ever faster by dangling the carrot of
satisfaction just out of reach, where all the "success" in
the world is never really enough, even the smallest step
"backwards" can be traumatic. One feels completely
isolated; for, we are all competing in a poker game in
which no one lets on that they, too, sometimes come up
with a bad hand.
At the bottom of my crisis, in the depths of despair, my
chaotic thoughts finally crystalized into thesequestions:
"Should my personal success be my greatest concern? Is
individual achievement what it is all about? Or is it this
very focus that prevents me from exploring the pos
sibilities in what I feel in fact is most important in life:
sharing with others?" To an extent merely posing such
abstract questions in print cannot convey, I felt my
whole being struggling with them.
Obsessed with success
just when I thought I was at my wits' end, everything
suddenly became clear: it is precisely this whole obses
sion with personal success, and achievement in general,
that is pushing our planet ever and ever closer to the
brink of total disaster. I found myself going beyond
merely "seeing" our mad onrush towards some kind of
holocaust; in a way I cannot really describe, I was "ex
periencing'' apocalyptic visions: everything from T.S.

EHot's "wasteland," to nuclear warfare, to the Fall of
Western Civilization.
Furthermore, I realized more clearly than I ever had
before that Stanford embodies and plays a crucial role in
a global system and a way of life that is destructive to
human flesh and spirit. I saw that not only were others
being harmed, but that I, myself, for all my critical at
titude, could not remain unaffected by the competitive
ness, the grade-grubbing, the obsession with future go
als, the personal ambition, the material extravagance,
the alienation and the passivity one finds at Stanford.
It is the obsession with personal success and
achievement that creates the energy to keep the Big
Wheel turning. Fear is the watchword. Keep everyone
terrified of failing and they will run faster and faster on
the treadmill. In the face of an economic recession, fear
turns into panic; students cling to the biggest, strongest
wooden horses (the "professions"), lest they spin off
the merry-go-round altogether.
Everyone takes only those courses, answers only
those test questions, writes only those papers they are
sure will produce the Almighty "A." Creativity, with its
attendant element of risk, gets thrown out the window
in the frantic search for a safe corner to hide in.
Liberated by dropping out
People tell me I'm crazy to be dropping out of school
when I could be getting my degree in a couple of quar
ters. But something in me, in the midst of that crisis,
snapped, while something else gelled: I found that in
order to be true to myself, I could no longer lend the
legitimacy to this institution that my being enrolled here
provides.
Friends and family pleaded with me to at least finish
out the quarter; but having seen things asclearly as I did,
I felt I must act immediately — before all the old habits,
conditioned fears, and outside pressures pushed me
back into the same old groove where tunnel vision and
narrowly "rational" action prevail.
Time has thus far rewarded me for my decision; drop
ping out of school has been a tremendously liberating
experience. It has clarified and illuminated a great many
things about myself and my relationship to the world
around me. I have never felt such a deep sense of integ
rity, wholeness and peace with myself.
Observing the rat race
I feel I have finally gotten out of the cage I was first put
into back in elementary school. I have removed myself
from the Rat Race: the race in which one has to worry
about one's every move in terms of how it will look on
The Transcript; the race that turns people into com
petitors, functions, stepping stones, cogs, sex objects,
and simple non-persons; the race fueled by alcohol,
valium, cars, caffeine, cocaine, television and other
drugs; the race in which the addicted, the slow, the
weak, the sensitive, the "insane," the old, the crippled,
the lonely, the freaks, the ragged, the impoverished —
all the "Useless Ones," created more often than not by
the race itself — are simply trampled upon; the race
which knows no end until death do us part.
Now that I have dropped out of the race and climbed
up into the grandstands to get an overview of the whole
carnival, I am truly astounded at just what a ghastly,
absurd, and cruel affair it really is. From up here, it
becomes clear that the King truly has no clothes on. Even
at Stanford, the well-protected maze preparing tomor
row's Head Rats for the unreal Real World, one is treated
to the pathetic spectacle of bright, talented people
grovelling in the dust in the most humiliating fashion for
a few extra points on a lousy test. (I've done it too.)
Performing for prizes
The buzzing one hears from those who are not actu
ally in the dust all seems to be about the same subject,
grades, and everyone is always anxiously consulting
their scorecards. One would think this an educational
institution that is supposed to challenge one with the
wisdom of the ages; but apparently it is just a gameshow
where one consumes as many facts as fast as possible,
spits them out on little pieces of paper, and then forgets
them just as quickly. The prizes are sponsored by Pre
stigious Professional Schools and Big Daddy Corpora
tions. A few people are off to the side, trying to avoid the
game, but they are constantly distracted by the din of

competition.
Professors are likewise caught, although in a some
what more advanced game. Tenure must be gotten;
one's professional standing must be kept up; one's
power in the University must be extended. So one cor
ners some minute, "safe" portion of the academic field;
one competes with one's "colleagues"; one staves off
grasping students so one can get back to one's research.
Backstage, families must be supported, taxes paid.
The administrators and trustees coordinate the Little
Came at Stanford with the Big Came of the Real World.
Administrators are simply the managers, the executives
of University Incorporated; the trustees, the stockhol
ders. Stanford trades in technological stock and skilled
bondsmen; "corporate contributions" are its commis
sion for this service. Cone is the "cathedral of learning";
knowledge has become another big business.
Global games of greed
Many of these games might be harmless enough in
and of themselves, but they become deeply disturbing
when, gazing over the entire global field, one observes
that half the participants do not even have enough food
to eat; that the stadium as a whole is overflowing with
people and more keep entering all the time; that despite
repeated announcements over the loudspeaker that we
are running out of resources, 6 per cent of the people
continue consuming a third of them and keep clammer
ing for more; that a thick haze is setting in making
breathing more and more difficult; and that — most
frightening of all — everyone in sight is procuring these
absolutely insane little "toys," a few of which could blow
up the entire stadium.
Apocalypse'has arrived
Why is it that so many of us are resisting the increas
ingly obvious: these "games" we are playing are seri
ously threatening the survival of life on this planet?
Could it be that we are so intent on our own advance
ment that we cannot even conceive of that which might
interfere with it? Could it be that we subconsciously
realize that if we were truly to comprehend present
global trends, we might have to fundamentally change
our plans and lifestyles? Could it be we are unwiliing to
change?
For, change we must, and radically so. To say that we
will change when and if circumstances demand it shows
that we have not even begun to understand what is
going on in the world. For two billion people suffering
from malnutrition or actually starving, the Apocalypse is
not some vague possibility in the distant future; it has
already arrived. If you have been to New York City or any
of the other decaying Northeastern and Midwestern
cities recently, you might say the same about them:
mass neurosis is bordering on mass psychosis.
Solution within self
"Okay, okay," we cry, "What is the solution? What is
the solution?" If that is all we can cry, then I suggest we
look again: obviously, we still have not comprehended
things as they really are. And I do not just mean things as
they appear on the charts, in the books, but the human
costs as well. For once we look at the whole picture, the
human as well as the statistical, and let this knowledge
pervade our whole beings, we shall have been trans
formed, and the solution will become obvious: it lies
within ourselves.
In short, it lies within each and every one of us taking
full responsibility for what is going on in the world. For
the present mess is being caused by our greed and
ambition, by our insistence on buying junk we don't
need, by our driving when we could be bicycling, by our
insistence on eating resource-inefficient meat when we
would probably be doing better without it, and by our
going to work for and profiting from a system hell-bent
on its own and everyone else's destruction.
Realize our unity
Although an audience as supposedly "sophisticated"
as the Stanford one may find it a little silly and simplistic,
it must be said that in the end the only way we are really
going to come to grips with our present dilemma is when
each of us begins to realize his fundamental unity and

connectedness, when each of us begins to grow in love,
godliness, oneness, wholism, or whatever name one
wants to give it.
For only with such a wholistic approach can we hope
to deal with our problems without creating new ones,
While many solutions will have to be in part technical
and utilize professional skills, it is precisely the narrowly
technological outlook and fragmented approach that
have to a great extent brought us to this maelstrom.
We all have it within us not only to grow, but, indeed,
to realize the fullness of love, oneness, "God — again,
whatever you want to call it. It is a lifetime of condition
ing, conditioning in fear, greed, ambition, competitive
ness, nationalism, racism, sexism, future-orientation,
etc., that is preventing that potential from being
realized. Only by coming to see and understand how
deep this conditioning goes and how it operates in our
daily lives, can we begin to liberate ourselves from it. In
the timeless words of Socrates: Know Thyself.
Creative energy sapped
Certainly not everyone needs to drop out of Stanford
to further themselves along the road to self-discovery
... but I did. Only now am I fully realizing just how
destructive the anxiety of grades and the obsession with
personal achievement has been to my natural love of
learning (which I now see has been part of my difficulty
in writing papers). We generally fail to realize how sensi
tive we are to the internal conflict created by being
involved in things (like Stanford) we do not fully believe
in and how much this conflict saps creative energy.
As for the future: I find myself worrying less and less
about it. This mad quest for security most Stanford stu
dents are engaged in is pure illusion. No one is going to
be able to escape the global chaos that seems at this
point inevitable, not to mention the chaos the Rat Race is
wreaking in people's lives every day. There are alterna
tives to working in "the System," and where they do not
exist, we must create them.
Hitchhiking through life
It was through hitchhiking that I first understood the
inherent insecurity of existence, and by embracing this
fact, instead of trying to escape it, that I first experienced
some of the ecstasy of a "be here now" existence.
Life really is like a hitchhiking trip: one has both good
and bad luck, the weather can be fickle and extreme,
and one never knows what kind of experience one's
next "ride" is going to bring. But it is a trip that leads
inexorably to death, so unless one enjoys the scenery
along the way, one finds that one has gone nowhere at
all.
More and more in my "hitchhike" through life, I find
myself wanting to divert the eyes of my "drivers" from
their hypnotic fixation on the macadam highway before
them to point out the incredible vistas all around the
road: the green pastures, the gently rolling hills, and far
off in the distance, the rugged, muscular mountains,
streaming sunlight making their snowy peaks almost too
brilliant to look at.
Road to success?
But the very few drivers who dare to take their eyes off
the road for even a moment, usually snap their gaze
immediately back to the dull gray ribbon before them.
For what I forgot to tell them was that in order to see all
this majestic scenery, they first had to be confronted
with the huge, desperately-pleading eyes of . . . the
wretched, the lonely, the forgotten, and most of all the
dead, staring at us from the gutters alongside the road.
After such a traumatic experience most drivers are
afraid to even look in the rear view mirror lest they catch
sight of themselves and see dancing in their eyes the
same horrors. With renewed concentration and deter
mination, they push down hard on the accelerator, pas
sing every car in sight, hoping to arrive in a nowhere land
beyond the roadside of suffering humanity, the whole
time keeping their eyes riveted on the road ahead, the
road to "success," the "safe" road, the road that really
runs six feet under . . . the road of being a Stanford
student.
