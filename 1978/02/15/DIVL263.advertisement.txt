Protecting
yourself
against
cancer
is no
big deal.
- Hi-
Ifsa
regular
part
of living.
Even so. many
women refuse to check
their breasts for fear of
finding a lump. What they
don't understand is that
80% of all lumps are not
cancer But if they are.
the earlier the diagnosis
and treatment, the better
the chances of cure.
If breast self
examination is not a
regular part of living for
you, contact your doctor
or your local American
Cancer Society Unit for
information. And remember,
you don't check your
breasts to find lumps, but
to find out you're alright.
