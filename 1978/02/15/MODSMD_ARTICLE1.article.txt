# Protesters get hostile receptions
## 
### 
About 50 Stanford Committee for
Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) members received hostile
receptions at dormitories as they
marched around campus late last
night.
The marchers were protesting the
Board of Trustees position of divest
ment of stocks in companies doing
business in South Africa.
The candle-carrying marchers
finished their march on the front
lawn of President Richard Lyman's
house, where they were met by three
Department of Public Safety officers.
The protesters met with hostile re
ceptions at Larkin, Trancos, Otero
and Junipero dorms. Residents yel
led out windows, calling the mar
chers "Commies" and "fanatics."
One resident said he was upset
because "they're the same people
that disrupted the (CIA Director
Stansfield) Turner speech last
week."
SCRIP members said SCRIP was
not involved in any activities at that
speech.
At Larkin, residents were dis
turbed because protesters were
chanting in the courtyard while they
were having a Valentine's Day party.
After arriving at Lyman's house,
the group formed a circle and heard
SCRIP member Steven Mentor say "I
feel we have to live whatever revolu
tion we're making."
