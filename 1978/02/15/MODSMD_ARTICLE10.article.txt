I shall not try to compete with
Glenn Jordan in the art of names cal
ling or in the use of ad hominem ar
guments. I readily concede that in
both respects he is clearly my
superior.
"White Settlers in Tropical Africa"
was published in 1961, during the era
of decolonization. At that time the
academic establishment, both in Bri
tain and in this country, firmly be
lieved that the newly independent
states of Africa would turn out to be
model democracies. My co-author,
Peter Duignan, and I were more pre
scient.
We predicted the coming of one
party dictatorships and of army
dictatorships. Events have proved us
right. We predicted that ethnic
minorities, especially wealthy or
reputedly wealthy minorities, might
bewidely persecuted. The fateof Ibo
in Northern Nigeria, Arabs in Zan
zibar and Indians in Uganda has
proved us right.
As regards Angola, we unfortu
nately turned out to be even more
correct than we knew at the time. We
feared a Communist-inspired "war
of national liberation" in Angola,
with chaos thereafter. This is pre
cisely what happened. The Popular
Liberation Movement represents at
best one-third of the Angolan
peoples. Its rule has been imposed
solely with the aid of Soviet-backed
Cuban expeditionary forces.
Overseas involvement
One-fourth of the Cuban army
now fights overseas. Angola
threatens to become Cuba's Viet
nam. Villages are being napalmed;
refugees flee across the border into
Southwest Africa; dissidents are tor
tured and massacred. No end of the
war is in sight, and the movement
readily admits that they cannot do
without Cuban assistance in the
shape of some 20,000 Cuban sol
diers.
Jordan is equally ill-informed with
regard to labor conditions in South
African mines. The death rate in the
gold mines of South Africa is 1.2 per
1,000 workers per annum. That is just
a little higher than the figure on U.S.
coal mines of 1.0 per 1000 workers
and is appreciably lower than the rate
in the U.S. lumber industry — 2.4 per

1000.
Wages in South African mines for
Africans stand at $140 per month for
beginners, to which must be added
another $i4O for free transportation,
housing, medical and dental care
and unlimited food. Compare this
with wages for miners in Nigeria of
$75 and in Sierra Leone of $50 a
month. The facts are even admitted
to by Marxists (who then claim they
are irrelevant).
Best educated
South African blacks are the best
educated, most urbanized and
among the best off materially of any
African people on the entire conti
nent of Africa. Black South African
nationalists in fact use these facts in
order to prove that their black coun
trymen are better fitted for self-rule
than Africans in independent African
states.
Samora Machel, the Marxist head

of the Marxist-Leninist republic of
Mozambique, is well aware of the
advantaged derived from collabora
tion with Souh Africa. Mozambique
not only contracts to send black
labor migrants to the South African
mines. South Africans help to run the
Mozambique railways; South Afri
cans help to run the Cabora Bassa
hydro-electric scheme. Disinvest
ment from South Africa is not a popu
lar issue in Mozambique.
As regards the expense of my re
cent trip to South Africa, I traveled
there under the auspices of the
South African Foundation, a liberal
business oriented group — the same
body that showed the leaders of the
NAACP around South Africa last
year.

threatens to become Cuba's Viet
nam. Villages are being napalmed;
refugees flee across the border into
Southwest Africa; dissidents are tor
tured and massacred. No end of the
war is in sight, and the movement
readily admits that they cannot do
without Cuban assistance in the
shape of some 20,000 Cuban sol
diers.
Jordan is equally ill-informed with
regard to labor conditions in South
African mines. The death rate in the
gold mines of South Africa is 1.2 per
1,000 workers per annum. That is just
a little higher than the figure on U.S.
coal mines of 1.0 per 1000 workers
and is appreciably lower than the rate
in the U.S. lumber industry — 2.4 per

1000.
Wages in South African mines for
Africans stand at $140 per month for
beginners, to which must be added
another $i4O for free transportation,
housing, medical and dental care
and unlimited food. Compare this
with wages for miners in Nigeria of
$75 and in Sierra Leone of $50 a
month. The facts are even admitted
to by Marxists (who then claim they
are irrelevant).
Best educated
South African blacks are the best
educated, most urbanized and
among the best off materially of any
African people on the entire conti
nent of Africa. Black South African
nationalists in fact use these facts in
order to prove that their black coun
trymen are better fitted for self-rule
than Africans in independent African
states.
Samora Machel, the Marxist head

of the Marxist-Leninist republic of
Mozambique, is well aware of the
advantaged derived from collabora
tion with Souh Africa. Mozambique
not only contracts to send black
labor migrants to the South African
mines. South Africans help to run the
Mozambique railways; South Afri
cans help to run the Cabora Bassa
hydro-electric scheme. Disinvest
ment from South Africa is not a popu
lar issue in Mozambique.
As regards the expense of my re
cent trip to South Africa, I traveled
there under the auspices of the
South African Foundation, a liberal
business oriented group — the same
body that showed the leaders of the
NAACP around South Africa last
year.

"White Settlers in Tropical Africa"
was published in 1961, during the era
of decolonization. At that time the
academic establishment, both in Bri
tain and in this country, firmly be
lieved that the newly independent
states of Africa would turn out to be
model democracies. My co-author,
Peter Duignan, and I were more pre
scient.
We predicted the coming of one
party dictatorships and of army
dictatorships. Events have proved us
right. We predicted that ethnic
minorities, especially wealthy or
reputedly wealthy minorities, might
bewidely persecuted. The fateof Ibo
in Northern Nigeria, Arabs in Zan
zibar and Indians in Uganda has
proved us right.
As regards Angola, we unfortu
nately turned out to be even more
correct than we knew at the time. We
feared a Communist-inspired "war
of national liberation" in Angola,
with chaos thereafter. This is pre
cisely what happened. The Popular
Liberation Movement represents at
best one-third of the Angolan
peoples. Its rule has been imposed
solely with the aid of Soviet-backed
Cuban expeditionary forces.
Overseas involvement
One-fourth of the Cuban army
now fights overseas. Angola
threatens to become Cuba's Viet
nam. Villages are being napalmed;
