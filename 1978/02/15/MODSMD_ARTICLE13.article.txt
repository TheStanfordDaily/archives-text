# In comparison with past movements
## Student activism changes in focus 
### Alison Smale News Analysis 
In 1971 Bob Beyers, director of the Uni
versity News Service, invited students
from the Stanford Daily to a party with the
Professional Journalism Fellows, working
journalists who come on a year's leave to
the University to study the subject of their
choice. After an hour and a half, the stu
dents got up and left.
"We don't have anything in common
'with these people," they said.
In 1976, the same party — with different
students and journalists — went on until 4
a.m., when Beyers finally asked everyone
to leave.
"Jobs," shrugs the 46-year old news di
rector by way of explanation.
That same explanation may help to de
scribe student activism (or rather the lack
of it) in recent times.
Now well into the 19705, we hear that the
violent campuses of the 1960s are no
more. Students have cut their hair, given
up marches and rock-throwing, and re
turned to the libraries in droves. In an
ever-depleting job market, the fight is on
for the good grades. It's back to the tran
quil, conservative fifties, the media say.
Or so we're told. Last May, 294 students
were arrested for participating in a sit-in at
Old Union.
The students were protesting the Uni
versity's investment policy and its hold
ings of stock in several large corporations
with interests in South Africa. This particu
lar protest centered on the Board of Trus
tees' decision to abstain from a sharehol
ders' vote on a motion calling on Ford
Motor Company to divest itself of its South
African investments. The students wanted
the trustees to vote in favor.
"Apartheid means profit, and Stanford
won't stop it," came the students' rallying
cry.
The forceful words belied the passive
nature of their protest. Dept. of Public
Safety Captain Raoul Niemeyer recalled,
"The students stood in line to get ar
rested."
At the time of the arrests, comparisons
with the protesters of the late sixties
abounded. But this protest was much
more orderly.
"The parallel that I see is with the very

early days of the civil rights movement of
the 19605," says Beyers, who went down
South in 1963 to take part in voter registra
tion drives for blacks in Mississippi.
So what did the students last May think
they could achieve?
"This is a real right-wing place. They
need more things like it,"says Rob
Svikhart, a freshman when arrested last
spring.
Simon Labov, also a freshman at the
time of his arrest, says:"I thought it was
worthwhile, an important issue for people
to know about. A lot of people at Stanford
only know about textbooks."
Asked if they had changed their outlook
in any way since their arrest, several stu
dents said they had become more suspici
ous of the University administration.
Lois Coit, a 26-year old journalism
graduate student at Stanford, saw some of
the most vehement war protests from 1968
to 1972 when she did undergraduate
studies at Simmons, a women's college in
Boston.
"This wasn't apartheid in South Africa,"
she says. "This was the lives of friends and
relatives. You had to be political, because
things were directly affecting you."
Coit recalls friends at Harvard crowding
around the radio when the first draw of
graduating seniors to be drafted was an
nounced.
"Protesters in the sixties weren't all that
altruistic," she says. "People were really
angry. Nobody ever gave them a really
good reason why they should go to Viet
nam. It was an illegal war."
A 32-year old post-doctoral student,
who wishes to remain anonymous, says
Vietnam was not the only issue. Students
questioned University courses, administ
ration, military research done at Stanford,
and the presence of ROTC on campus.
Some protesters, he thinks, were just
"getting out a lot of frustration about their
lives in society."
Both he and Coit stress that students
then were not necessarily united in their
aims. Coit remembers an incident in
which other students surrounded a build
ing at Harvard to prevent the Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS) breaking up a
debate with a speaker they felt should be
banned.

"That never made the papers," she
sighs.
Indeed, the media presented a picture
of the sixties as a time of unrelenting cam
pus violence. "Then," says Lipset, "the
media kind of lost interest in the whole
phenomenon of student activism."
The protest over South African invest
ment at Stanford, and similar protests at
Santa Cruz and Berkeley did not get much
media attention outside California, says
Lipset. He considers this affects a protest's
propensity to escalate and grow.
There are other explanations of sixties
activism. For example, Beyers says he pre
dicted campus unrest as early as 1959.
"In 1964, as a result of the post-war baby
boom, there was a 3.3 per cent increase in
the number of kids reaching college age,"
he says."The colleges made no prepara
tion for this increase."
Another explanation offered by Beyers
is that the "unquestioned acceptance of
excellence in our universities" was under
attack. Students wanted reform of the
grade system and teaching methods, in
addition to the relaxation of rules such as
those prohibiting co-ed dorms.
But Beyers agrees that the biggest trig
ger was the Vietnam war. By comparison,
the South African issue is less direct, and
more complex.
First, Stanford has to vote for divest
ment. Even if the corporations with hold
ings in South Africa withdraw their capital,
under South African law they would have
to sell all of their holdings and then invest
money in South African government sec
urities for five years before removing their
money.
Indeed, it may be that issues which are
as important today as Vietnam was seven
or eight years ago are not the sort of issues
to be resolved or even influenced by vio
lent action on campuses.
Yet protesters like Svikhart and Labov
wanted to make themselves heard last
spring. Dept. of Public Safety Director
Marvin Herrington thinks they were moti
vated by a romantic vision of protest. His
colleague Niemeyer thinks the protesters
were sincere, but that the leaders were out
for media publicity, and "gave a lot of kids
the bum steer."
