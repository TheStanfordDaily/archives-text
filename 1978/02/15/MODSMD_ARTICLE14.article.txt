# Edge magazine pleas to sci fi buffs for articles

### Matt Mettler 
EDGE, a campus science fiction and fantasy
magazine, needs articles, according to editor
George Cole. "We try to put out two editions a
year," he said, "but we are entirely dependent
on submissions from students."
Cole conceded that lack of interest is a prob
lem but this is because "people don't know
about us.
"We are here to encourage people to write
science fiction by giving them an outlet, a way to
see their stuff in print," he said.
Articles typically run about seven pages.
Submitted articles are read by the editor and

staff and the best stories are selected for publi
cation, according to Cole.
The magazine is not directly connected with
the University so no academic credit is given to
editors or writers, Cole said.
The first issue of EDGE was published in 1974
and seven editions running 28-38 pages have
been printed since then.
The magazine has no advertising and all funds
are acquired through sales plus a small subsidy
from the ASSU Publications Board, Cole said.
He added the cost to print 400 copies is about
$130. EDCE sells for 40 cents a copy in the
Bookstore.
