# Local Republican candidates face uphill political battles

University alumnus Greg
Morris may be a healthy man.
He may be well-educated,
energetic, sincere and percep
tive. His reputation may be vir
tually untarnished by sex scan
dal, banking fraud, political
espionage, questionable pri
vate interests or misdirected
conservatism.
Nevertheless, Morris is
plagued with a weakness
which affects many local politi
cal challengers, and he will
probably face a steep uphill
battle in his attempt to uproot
incumbent Assemblyman Vic
tor Calvo (D-Mountain View)
next November.
What is this mysterious
weakness? Morris is a Republi
can.
It is no news to anyone that
the Republican Party is due for
a face lift. In an election year,
the GOP image will be
scrutinized more closely than
ever — both from within the
party and from without.
The problem is particularly
acute in the mid-peninsula reg
ion. In Santa Clara County,
voter registration is nearly 56
per cent Democrat, compared
with the 35 per cent which is
Republican. What is more sig
nificant is that in April of 1970,
the County registered 42 per
cent Republican.
What happened to the 7 per
cent that once called itself Re
publican? Some of the change,
according to the County Regis
trar of Voters, is due to popula
tion growth. More of the
change, however, is a reflec
tion of the increase in voters

who "decline to state" their
party affiliation, up to 8 per
cent from 5 per cent in 1968,
according to Bob Walker, also
a University alum and director
of Republican County head
quarters.
Diversions
Interestingly, Santa Clara
County shows marked diver
sions from the standard
stereotype of Republicans as
being rich, highly influenced
by big business and largely
funded by special interests.
Brian O'Toole, assistant trea
surer of the county GOP com
mittee, explained that Democ
rats outspent Republicans two
to one county-wide in the 1976
elections.
Furthermore, O'Toole said,
statistics in the 1976 report of
the Fair Political Practices
Commission show that Demo
crat candidates received larger
amounts of money from spe
cial interest groups and big
business than did Republicans,
since Democrats control the
state legislature.
The reversed stereotype
applies, as well, to "maverick
Republican" Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park). In
the 1976 race for the 12th Dis
trict Congressional seat,
Democrat David Harris outs
pent incumbent McCloskey by
nearly $50,000. McCloskey's
contributions, totalling
$104,183, were mostly private
contributions, O'Toole said,
but they were enough to defeat
Harris.
McCloskey's two-to-one vic
tory in 1976 is a rare event in the
Republican record in and

around Stanford, however.
"McCloskey is an exception to
the general rule," Walker said.
"People vote tor McCloskey
because he's McCloskey."
McCloskey's party identifi
cation is such that many local
voters do not even realize he is
Republican. One Stanford stu
dent said recently, "I've just
always assumed that he was a
Democrat."
If McCloskey has not helped
the Republican Party, neither
has the COP identity helped
him. Even though he "is
McCloskey," being a Republi
can has caused him some prob
lems. According to Paul

Cheverton, president of the
Stanford Republicans,
McCloskey's nomination in the
1972 primary required the re
gistration or re-registration of
1000 Stanford voters.
Adjustment
Since that time, voter regist
ration here has adjusted itself
to 3262 Democrats and 1327
Republicans, plus a 14 per cent
category of voters who have
"declined to state" their party
affiliation.
Morris has adopted a sort of
"hide-and-seek" campaign
strategy as regards his own af
filiation with the Republican

party, according to his cam
paign workers. The word "Re
publican" has been omitted
from most of his campaign lit
erature. He says he is relying
on himself as a candidate,
rather than his membership in
the party.
When and where, then, will
the GOP face lift begin? Some
Republicans apparently be
lieve it can happen in the mid
peninsula region.
San Diego mayor and guber
natorial contender Pete Wilson
recently chose Santa Clara
County for a saturation cam
paign, partly for the county's
independence from

candidate-infested Los
Angeles and partly for its effi
cient party organization, ac
cording to Morris.
Moderate
"Republicans tend to be
more moderate in northern
California," Cheverton said. In
fact, he added, this county was
the site of a 1976 Young Repub
lican convention which was
"essentially the last battle for
the conservative model of con
trol." Finally, he continued,
with an endorsement for Pres
idential candidate Gerald Ford,
"the moderates were put into
power."

Part of the Young Republican
face lift, Cheverton contends,
lies in the discouraging of
"exclusionary conservative"
attitudes. This involves an
open-mindedness by which,
he explained, "If you like a
more moderate or dynamic
candidate, you can work for
him."
The state and nation appear
more reluctant to change.
While local or county support
may be slightly influential in
Republican re-alignment,
Santa Clara County Republi
cans can not make their com
eback until the national com
mittee "finds itself."

nearly $50,000. McCloskey's
contributions, totalling
$104,183, were mostly private
contributions, O'Toole said,
but they were enough to defeat
Harris.
McCloskey's two-to-one vic
tory in 1976 is a rare event in the
Republican record in and

around Stanford, however.
"McCloskey is an exception to
the general rule," Walker said.
"People vote tor McCloskey
because he's McCloskey."
McCloskey's party identifi
cation is such that many local
voters do not even realize he is
Republican. One Stanford stu
dent said recently, "I've just
always assumed that he was a
Democrat."
If McCloskey has not helped
the Republican Party, neither
has the COP identity helped
him. Even though he "is
McCloskey," being a Republi
can has caused him some prob
lems. According to Paul

Cheverton, president of the
Stanford Republicans,
McCloskey's nomination in the
1972 primary required the re
gistration or re-registration of
1000 Stanford voters.
Adjustment
Since that time, voter regist
ration here has adjusted itself
to 3262 Democrats and 1327
Republicans, plus a 14 per cent
category of voters who have
"declined to state" their party
affiliation.
Morris has adopted a sort of
"hide-and-seek" campaign
strategy as regards his own af
filiation with the Republican

party, according to his cam
paign workers. The word "Re
publican" has been omitted
from most of his campaign lit
erature. He says he is relying
on himself as a candidate,
rather than his membership in
the party.
When and where, then, will
the GOP face lift begin? Some
Republicans apparently be
lieve it can happen in the mid
peninsula region.
San Diego mayor and guber
natorial contender Pete Wilson
recently chose Santa Clara
County for a saturation cam
paign, partly for the county's
independence from

candidate-infested Los
Angeles and partly for its effi

cording to Morris.
Moderate
"Republicans tend to be
more moderate in northern
California," Cheverton said. In
fact, he added, this county was
the site of a 1976 Young Repub
lican convention which was
"essentially the last battle for
the conservative model of con
trol." Finally, he continued,
with an endorsement for Pres
idential candidate Gerald Ford,
"the moderates were put into
power."

Part of the Young Republican
face lift, Cheverton contends,
lies in the discouraging of
"exclusionary conservative"
attitudes. This involves an
open-mindedness by which,
he explained, "If you like a
more moderate or dynamic
candidate, you can work for
him."
The state and nation appear
more reluctant to change.
While local or county support
may be slightly influential in
Republican re-alignment,
Santa Clara County Republi

University alumnus Greg
Morris may be a healthy man.
He may be well-educated,
energetic, sincere and percep

tually untarnished by sex scan
dal, banking fraud, political
espionage, questionable pri
vate interests or misdirected
conservatism.
Nevertheless, Morris is
plagued with a weakness
which affects many local politi
cal challengers, and he will
probably face a steep uphill
battle in his attempt to uproot
incumbent Assemblyman Vic

next November.
What is this mysterious
weakness? Morris is a Republi

It is no news to anyone that
the Republican Party is due for
a face lift. In an election year,
the GOP image will be
scrutinized more closely than
ever — both from within the
party and from without.
The problem is particularly
acute in the mid-peninsula reg
ion. In Santa Clara County,
voter registration is nearly 56
per cent Democrat, compared
with the 35 per cent which is
Republican. What is more sig
nificant is that in April of 1970,
the County registered 42 per
cent Republican.
What happened to the 7 per
cent that once called itself Re
publican? Some of the change,
according to the County Regis
trar of Voters, is due to popula
tion growth. More of the
change, however, is a reflec
tion of the increase in voters

who "decline to state" their
party affiliation, up to 8 per
cent from 5 per cent in 1968,
according to Bob Walker, also
a University alum and director
of Republican County head
quarters.
Diversions
Interestingly, Santa Clara
County shows marked diver

stereotype of Republicans as
being rich, highly influenced
by big business and largely
funded by special interests.
Brian O'Toole, assistant trea

Furthermore, O'Toole said,

the Fair Political Practices
Commission show that Demo

amounts of money from spe

face lift, Cheverton contends,
lies in the discouraging of

open-mindedness by which,

him."

University alumnus Greg
Morris may be a healthy man.
He may be well-educated,
energetic, sincere and percep
tive. His reputation may be vir
tually untarnished by sex scan
dal, banking fraud, political
espionage, questionable pri
vate interests or misdirected
conservatism.
Nevertheless, Morris is
plagued with a weakness
which affects many local politi
cal challengers, and he will
probably face a steep uphill
battle in his attempt to uproot
incumbent Assemblyman Vic
tor Calvo (D-Mountain View)
next November.
What is this mysterious
weakness? Morris is a Republi
can.
It is no news to anyone that
the Republican Party is due for
a face lift. In an election year,
the GOP image will be
scrutinized more closely than
ever — both from within the
party and from without.
The problem is particularly
acute in the mid-peninsula reg
ion. In Santa Clara County,
voter registration is nearly 56
per cent Democrat, compared
with the 35 per cent which is
Republican. What is more sig
nificant is that in April of 1970,
the County registered 42 per
cent Republican.
What happened to the 7 per
cent that once called itself Re
publican? Some of the change,
according to the County Regis
trar of Voters, is due to popula
tion growth. More of the
change, however, is a reflec
tion of the increase in voters

who "decline to state" their
party affiliation, up to 8 per
cent from 5 per cent in 1968,
according to Bob Walker, also
a University alum and director
of Republican County head
quarters.
Diversions
Interestingly, Santa Clara
County shows marked diver
sions from the standard
stereotype of Republicans as
being rich, highly influenced
by big business and largely
funded by special interests.
Brian O'Toole, assistant trea
surer of the county GOP com
mittee, explained that Democ
rats outspent Republicans two
to one county-wide in the 1976
elections.
Furthermore, O'Toole said,
statistics in the 1976 report of
the Fair Political Practices
Commission show that Demo
crat candidates received larger
amounts of money from spe
cial interest groups and big
business than did Republicans,
since Democrats control the
state legislature.
The reversed stereotype
applies, as well, to "maverick
Republican" Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park). In
the 1976 race for the 12th Dis
trict Congressional seat,
Democrat David Harris outs
pent incumbent McCloskey by
nearly $50,000. McCloskey's
contributions, totalling
$104,183, were mostly private
contributions, O'Toole said,
but they were enough to defeat
Harris.
McCloskey's two-to-one vic
tory in 1976 is a rare event in the
Republican record in and

around Stanford, however.
"McCloskey is an exception to
the general rule," Walker said.
"People vote tor McCloskey
because he's McCloskey."
McCloskey's party identifi
cation is such that many local
voters do not even realize he is
Republican. One Stanford stu
dent said recently, "I've just
always assumed that he was a
Democrat."
If McCloskey has not helped
the Republican Party, neither
has the COP identity helped
him. Even though he "is
McCloskey," being a Republi
can has caused him some prob
lems. According to Paul

Cheverton, president of the
Stanford Republicans,
McCloskey's nomination in the
1972 primary required the re
gistration or re-registration of
1000 Stanford voters.
Adjustment
Since that time, voter regist
ration here has adjusted itself
to 3262 Democrats and 1327
Republicans, plus a 14 per cent
category of voters who have
"declined to state" their party
affiliation.
Morris has adopted a sort of
"hide-and-seek" campaign
strategy as regards his own af
filiation with the Republican

party, according to his cam
paign workers. The word "Re
publican" has been omitted
from most of his campaign lit
erature. He says he is relying
on himself as a candidate,
rather than his membership in
the party.
When and where, then, will
the GOP face lift begin? Some
Republicans apparently be
lieve it can happen in the mid
peninsula region.
San Diego mayor and guber
natorial contender Pete Wilson
recently chose Santa Clara
County for a saturation cam
paign, partly for the county's
independence from

candidate-infested Los
Angeles and partly for its effi
cient party organization, ac
cording to Morris.
Moderate
"Republicans tend to be
more moderate in northern
California," Cheverton said. In
fact, he added, this county was
the site of a 1976 Young Repub
lican convention which was
"essentially the last battle for
the conservative model of con
trol." Finally, he continued,
with an endorsement for Pres
idential candidate Gerald Ford,
"the moderates were put into
power."

Part of the Young Republican
face lift, Cheverton contends,
lies in the discouraging of
"exclusionary conservative"
attitudes. This involves an
