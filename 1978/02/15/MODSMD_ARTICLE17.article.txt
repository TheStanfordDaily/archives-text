# Sailing team breezing through competitions

It's late November in Chicago, the
temperature is 26 degrees below zero,
and students Tom Feldstein and Chuck
Lamphere are out sailing.
"We had to throw rock salt in the
bottom of the boat and dip the lines in
salt water so they wouldn't freeze,"
said Felstein, co-captain of Stanford's
sailing team.
Feldstein and Lamphere are two "red
hot" members of the Stanford sailing
team. The team "numbers close to 35,"
including about five women, according
to Feldstein.
"Sailing is the only sport at Stanford, I
believe, where men and women com
pete together," Feldstein said.
Stanford competes in the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Racing Associa
tion, which includes about 30 schools,
Feldstein said. For transportation
reasons, the conference has been split

into a Northern and Southern Califor
nia Intercollegiate Sailing Association.
"I'd say we're one of the three best
teams in California. We can't sail much
against southern California because of
our location, and that has hurt us some
times," Feldstein said.
The team has done well in meets thus
far, Feldstein said. "We placed 15th in
the National championships last year.
We're hoping this May to qualify again
for the Nationals. We think our team is
even better this year," he said.
The team has six top-notch sailors:
co-captains Feldstein and Jeff Merrill,
Peter Skinner, Alan Norman, Bill Keller
and Lamphere.
Only one of these six, Skinner, is a
senior, so the future looks bright, ac
cording to Feldstein.
Most have sailed since they were
children. "I started when I was 10. But
that's kind of late," Feldstein com

merited. Skinner has sailed since he
was seven.
"That's not to discourage people
from starting now," Feldstein said.
Some team members started much
later. ]ohn Friend said he has not been
sailing long, "mostly because I'm from
Phoenix."
Toby Schneider started sailing two
years ago when he took a class here. He
said he joined to "see what racing is
like. It's fun," he added.
The group is coached by Vim Steen
bakker, who has been sailing for 24
years. He also teaches the sailing clas
ses offered by the athletic department
here.
"Sailing is probably one of the more
difficult sports to coach," Feldstein
said. The team has one group who has
sailed for a long time and doesn't need
much help, he added.
Steenbakker helps the newer sailors

with technique, and does organiza
tional work. He said he concentrates on
"making sure the equipment is here
and in good shape. No matter how
good you are, you can't win if your
equipment is bad."
"One problem sailing has is it is so
equipment oriented. There is a prob
lem with maintaining and getting good
equipment," Feldstein said.
The team owns six Chrysler
Parateers, three Flying juniors (two
man boats), and three Lasers (single
man boats). "We're in the process of
replacing the Lasers. We have to re
place boats about every three years,"
said Feldstein.
"Sailing is a very expensive sport. It
takes lots of money," Steenbakker re
marked.
Sailing is a Club sport, and receives
$2300 per year from the Club sports
