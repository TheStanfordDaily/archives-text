## Rugger report 
### 
On a glorious winter after
noon made for rugby, last
Saturday Stanford I romped to
a 32-10 win over UC-Santa
Cruz.
Stanford's first try came
when wing Rich Roux, after a
series of precise passes, broke
through for the score.
A popkick recovered near
the goal produced Stanford's
second try by Denis
Shanagher. Fullback Peter
Duignan continued the assault
with a fine drive over the last 25
yards for another score.
A fullback burst and a feed to
wing Jeff Morris brought Stan
| ford near the try line from
: where Shanagher scored. For
ward Redmond Burke stormed
:£ over from the short side out of
a set scrum near the Santa Cruz
goal for the final try. Stanford
may have also discovered its
kicker — Morris made
four conversions and two pen

alty kicks.
The forwards played an out
standing defensive game,
smothering the Santa Cruz at
tacks before they got coher
ence and commitment.
Cordy Riegel was always
contributing to defense and at
tack. On one amazing drive he
ran with head down and knees
up carrying nearly half the
Santa Cruz team with him.
It was a fine effort by the
pack which won a fair share of
line-out balls and developed
useful drives and service in try
ing to get the ball out of the
ruck and mall.
The Cards proved the old
English saying to be true —
soccer is a gentlemen's game
played by hooligans and rugby
is a hooligan's game played by
gentlemen.
In other action, Stanford II
downed the Palo Alto Rugby
Club, 25-0, and Stanford 111
won its game, 16-4.
