# SCRIP meets with trustees
## 
### 
Eight members of the Stanford
Committee for a Responsible In
vestment Policy (SCRIP) picketed
outside the Board of Trustees office
in San Francisco yesterday, yet the
board took no action on the controv
ersial issue of investment in corpora
tions with South African interests.
After nearly I'/2 hours of picketing,
the group put down their placards
and met with trustees informally to
discuss differences on the issue, ac
cording to Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president for public affairs.
The protestors also had lunch with
trustees before they left. The situa
tion was described as "nothing but
orderly."
"It was all very chummy, good
tempered and good-humored," said
Rosenzweig. "All seemed to be
pleased with the event."
The incident came on the date
originally set by SCRIP as the dead
line for University divestment of sec
urities with interests in South Africa.
The organization recently with
drew its Feb. 14 divestiture deadline
following repeated statements by
administrators that such action was
not likely.
Trustees held discussions con
cerning the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR) during the
meeting, and the subject of invest
ment policy was a topic of discussion
at sherry hours held with trustees
around campus Monday and yester
day.

According to Robert Hamrdla, as
sistant to the president for trustee
affairs, the board held discussions on
President Richard Lyman's recent
move to place students on the CIR
following ASSU Nominations Com
mittee refusal to do so. The board
also discussed how it would receive
CIR recommendations.
Lyman's move was discussed be
fore the Ac ademic Affairs Committee
instead of coming as part of the Pres
ident's Report. In this way, student
membersof the committee would be
able to present their side of the con
troversy, according to Rosenzweig.
Hamrdla said ASSU Co-presidents
Creg Larson and Steve Westly pre
sented statements to the committee,
expressing ASSU conccrns of possi
ble violation of the ASSU Constitu
tion and explaining the reasons stu
dent leaders chose not to nominate
students to the CIR.
Lyman had equal time to present
his side. A "brief but quite active''
discussion followed, according to
Rosenzweig.
"I tend to think Mr. Lyman had
pretty close to unanimous support,"
Hamrdla said. "There was no sig
nificant movement away from what
Mr. Lyman did."
But the only investment issue
related action was a resolution allow
ing Trustee Alan Weeden, chairper
son of the Committee on Invest
ments, to appoint a subcommittee to
receive CIR recommendations, if he

so chooses.
Hamrdla said that though a sub
committee of the board may accept
the direct CIR input, theentire board
wishes to see the CIR reports.
Rosenzweig explained that a sub
committee may be necessary be
cause "timing of proxy votes doesn't
always coincide with board meet
ings. They had to have a way of deal
ing with these issues," he said.
He said the subcommittee could
accept CIR input,.act on it and report
to the board for retroactive approval
or discussion.

chanted in the dorm's courtyard. About 50 students protesting the University's
position on divestment of stocks in companies doing business in South Africa
marched around campus late last night, eventually arriving at President Richard
Lyman's house.
