Women ruggers lose
The Stanford women's rugby team
dropped its first league game of the
season Saturday to Chico State, 4-0.
"They got a fluke try on their kickoff,"
said Card Ellen Merrick. "We played
with one person less, and they kicked
off to where that person was missing."
The Cards are in the women's division
of the Northern California Rugby Foot
ball Union. UC-Davis and San Francisco
City College also have teams in the
league.
The women's next game is Saturday
against Santa Barbara.
Fencer takes second
Stanford's Duncan Proudfoot
finished second in the men's foil com
petition Saturday to top the list of five
Cards who placed high in the Northern
California Athletic Conference Fencing
Championships.
Mike Saxenian grabbed fifth place in
the men's foil and Murray Peck took
sixth in the sabre. Thad Bartell was fifth
and Rod Trevino was sixth in the epee.
In the team competitions, Stanford
finished either third or fourth in all four

categories. "We would have liked to
have done better," said fencing coach
Jean Helliwell. "It was one of the best
Northern California championships
I've ever been to. There was some ex
quisite fencing."
Laxmen triumph
The Stanford lacrosse team staved off
a late rally to down the Palo Alto Lac
rosse Club, 13-9, in the Cards' home
opener Saturday. Stanford was led by
Rick Valentine (4 gods, 2 assists), Kirk
Phelps (3, 1) and Peter Werner (2, 0).
Then Sunday Stanford bombed the
Golden Gate Lacrosse Club, 7-1, be
hind the offense of Stan Allison (2, 0)
and Valentine (0,3). Goaltender Denny
Childs had 15 saves.
The laxmen's next game is Feb. 25 at
UC-Davis.

ketball game at Berkeley March 4. They
are on sale at the Athletic Department.
Walsh denies another rumor
Stanford head football coach Bill
Walsh denied yesterday that he would
become head coach of the Chicago
Bears of the National Football League. A
Tuesday story in the Chicago Tribune
reported Walsh would succeed Jack
Pardee, who left to become head coach
of the Washington Redskins.
"There's no truth to the rumor," said
Walsh. "I haven't even talked to the
Bears about the job."

Correction
Due to an editing oversight in one of
the stories on recruiting in Friday's
sports section, a quote by coach Doug
Single indicated that almost all recruits
with less than a 3.9 grade point average
needed high SAT scores in order to be
admitted to Stanford. The actual quote
was, "Anyone under 3.0 should have
SAT scores that offset that CPA or must
be one of the top two people we're
recruiting.''
Baseball wins
Mark Abbondola pitched six innings,
catcher Bruce Walters collected three
hits and Larry Reynolds had a pair of RBI
yesterday to pace Stanford to a 6-2 win
at Hayward State.
The Cards had been scheduled to
play Santa Clara, but the Broncos had to
make up a league game with St. Mary's.
As a result, Stanford played Hayward
State, St. Mary's originally scheduled
opponent.
The Cards, 3-0-1, host Hayward State
today at 2:30 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
The tie is the result of the second game
of the Saturday doubleheader with the
University of the Pacific, which was cal
led after six innings in a 3-3 tie, and then
rained out Sunday.
The Santa Clara game has been re
scheduled for Monday at Santa Clara at
1 p.m.
Golfers triumph
The Stanford men's golf team de
feated San Francisco State and St.
Mary's in a meet Monday at the San

Francisco Golf Club. The Cards had a

a 419.
The top five golfers were from Stan
ford, led by Steve Schroeder with a 71.
The other four were Doug Clarke (74),
Ken Bakst (74), Mike Peck (76) and Eric
Morse (77).

Women ruggers lose
The Stanford women's rugby team

season Saturday to Chico State, 4-0.
"They got a fluke try on their kickoff,"
said Card Ellen Merrick. "We played
with one person less, and they kicked
off to where that person was missing."
The Cards are in the women's division
of the Northern California Rugby Foot
ball Union. UC-Davis and San Francisco
City College also have teams in the
league.
The women's next game is Saturday
against Santa Barbara.
Fencer takes second
Stanford's Duncan Proudfoot
finished second in the men's foil com
petition Saturday to top the list of five

California Athletic Conference Fencing
Championships.
Mike Saxenian grabbed fifth place in
the men's foil and Murray Peck took
sixth in the sabre. Thad Bartell was fifth
and Rod Trevino was sixth in the epee.
In the team competitions, Stanford
finished either third or fourth in all four

categories. "We would have liked to
have done better," said fencing coach
Jean Helliwell. "It was one of the best
Northern California championships
I've ever been to. There was some ex
quisite fencing."
Laxmen triumph
The Stanford lacrosse team staved off
a late rally to down the Palo Alto Lac

Walsh denies another rumor
Stanford head football coach Bill
Walsh denied yesterday that he would
become head coach of the Chicago
Bears of the National Football League. A
Tuesday story in the Chicago Tribune
reported Walsh would succeed Jack
Pardee, who left to become head coach
of the Washington Redskins.
"There's no truth to the rumor," said
Walsh. "I haven't even talked to the
Bears about the job."

Correction
Due to an editing oversight in one of
the stories on recruiting in Friday's
sports section, a quote by coach Doug
Single indicated that almost all recruits
with less than a 3.9 grade point average
needed high SAT scores in order to be
admitted to Stanford. The actual quote
was, "Anyone under 3.0 should have
SAT scores that offset that CPA or must
be one of the top two people we're
recruiting.''
Baseball wins
Mark Abbondola pitched six innings,
catcher Bruce Walters collected three
hits and Larry Reynolds had a pair of RBI
yesterday to pace Stanford to a 6-2 win
at Hayward State.
The Cards had been scheduled to
play Santa Clara, but the Broncos had to
make up a league game with St. Mary's.
As a result, Stanford played Hayward
State, St. Mary's originally scheduled
opponent.
The Cards, 3-0-1, host Hayward State
today at 2:30 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
The tie is the result of the second game
of the Saturday doubleheader with the
University of the Pacific, which was cal
led after six innings in a 3-3 tie, and then
rained out Sunday.
The Santa Clara game has been re
scheduled for Monday at Santa Clara at
1 p.m.
