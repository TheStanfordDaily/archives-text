# Women's track makes a return
## Meeting set for tomorrow 
### Kelly Raftery 
The Stanford women's track
team is back as a club sport
after several years of nonexis
tence. An organizational meet
ing will be held tomorrow at 9
p.m. in the Toyon Lounge. Ac
cording to coach Holly Hous
ton, "People of all ability levels
are welcome to come out for
the team. Our focus will be on
training for competition in
spring."
Club status, achieved this
january, was the culmination
of much effort on the part of
many interested women run
ners. Last year several women
cross country runners ran to
gether in one of cross country
coach Marshall Clark's track

classes. Ann Thrupp, one of
the runners, found out about
various meets from women's
track coaches at other schools,
and later the Stanford women
and a few others participated in
the meets as a loosely knit
team. However, they had no
coach or University recogni
tion.
"Women's track has been a
long time coming," said senior
Sandy Briscoe, organizer of the
women's cross country team.
She said she feels it is very im
portant for the cross country
team to offer to talented wo
men runners a track team.
Interest in the new team is
running high. A meeting last
week was attended by approx

imately 30 women. Houston
said "there is a lot of talent" at
Stanford. According to
Thrupp, the small group of
women who competed in
meets last year often did as well
as some of the other teams.
Thrupp herself qualified for
the AIAW Nationals in the 3000
meters but had no team with
which she could compete.
With more women having
high school running experi
ence coming to Stanford, it is
expected that the interest de
monstrated sofarwill increase.
As one senior lamented, "I
wish I'd be around next year. I
think this is the year women's
track is going to take off."
