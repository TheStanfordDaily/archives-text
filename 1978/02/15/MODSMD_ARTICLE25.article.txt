Arms sales to Mideast approved
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, in a major pol
icy shift announced yesterday, approved the sale of U.S.
warplanes to Egypt for the first time in a $4.8 billion
Middle East weapons package that also would supply
sophisticated jets to Israel and Saudi Arabia.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, declaring that the
weapons sales would not upset the balance of power in
the region, said the package will be sent to Congress
next week.
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan said in Los
Angeles the decision was "premature." Other Israeli
officials said Egypt may now be less willing to com
promise in negotiations and complained that the jets
sold to Saudi Arabia could be used in a war against Israel.
The proposed sale includes 50 U.S.-made F-5E jet
fighters for Egypt. Sixty of America's most advanced jet
fighters, the F-15, would be sold to Saudi Arabia. Israel
would get 15 of the F-15s and 75 F-16s.
Carter calls for coal negotiations
Washington — As National Guardsmen assembled to
convoy coal in Indiana and automakers warned of layoffs
soon, President Jimmy Carter called for both sides in the
nationwide coal strike to negotiate at the White House
and warned of "stronger measures" if that doesn't end
the strike.
Asked if the "stronger measures" would include in
voking the Taft-Hartley Act, Carter said that would be
"one of my options." Under the law he could ask for a
court order sending miners back to work for an 80-day
cooling-off period.
Carter said he wanted "to end the present stalemate"
in the 71-day-old strike. "The negotiations at the White
House must be viewed as a final opportunity for the
bargaining process to work.
United Mine Workers President Arnold Miller said he
is ready "to negotiate at any time — the sooner the
better." There was no immediate comment from the
industry.
Mud slides continue after L.A. rains
Los Angeles — As mud kept sliding yesterday after last
week's torrential rains, forecasters changed their minds
about storms which had been expected and predicted
no rain through Sunday.
Tom Allen of the city Department of Building and
Safety said mudslides may continue even on sunny days
when the soil is loosened by earlier rains and gradually
pulled down by the force of gravity.
The clear-skies forecast came on the heels of disclo
sure that the county Flood Control District had seeded
clouds six hours last Thursday before torrential rains
caused $43 million damage to eight California counties
and washed one entire community, the mountain ham
let of Hidden Springs, off the map.
County flood control officials denied their cloud seed
ing in San Gabriel Canyon had caused the problems
experienced in Big Tujunga and other canyons to the
west, but said if they had known the storm was going to
be so powerful they would not have seeded.
Poison gas kills seven in Chicago
Chicago — A chemical pumped into the wrong vats
mixed with acid already in the vats and created a cloud of
poisonous gas that swept through a tannery yesterday,
killing seven persons and sickening 28 others, officials
said.
Authorities said the accident occurred at 8:10 a.m.,

while shifts were changing at the block-long Horween
Leather Co. plant. A total of 176 persons were in the
building at the time.
Group opposes canal treaty
Washington — One of the leading groups trying to
defeat the Panama Canal treaty in the Senate conceded
yesterday it lacks the 34 votes needed to reject the pact.
The group, the Conservative Caucus, announced a
new campaign directed at 12 undecided senators.
Howard Phillips, executive director of the self-styled
"new right" organization, said only 22 senators are likely
to vote against the treaty.
The campaign to apply conservative pressure on
senators features an "emergency package" mailed last
week to 200,000 Conservative Caucus members telling
them that "nearly two-thirds of the members of the
Senate have concluded that they have more to fear from
the vested interests pushing the canal surrender and $80
million per year payoff than they have to fear from you."
Subsequent shifts in the Associated Press list have
increased the number supporting or leaning in favor of
the treaties from 49 to 51, with 18 undecided or unde
clared. The treaties need 67 votes if all members are
present and voting.
Employment bill passes committee
Washington — The House Education and Labor Com
mittee yesterday overwhelmingly approved the
Humphrey-Hawkins bill, which sets a national target of
reducing overall unemployment to 4 per cent by 1983.
Rep. Augustus Hawkins (D-Calif.), said he thought the
bill could be before the full House by mid-March. Haw
kins co-sponsored the bill with the late Sen. Hubert
Humphrey of Minnesota.
Abzug loses Congressional election
New York — Former congresswoman Bella Abzug's
early lead in a special congressional election evaporated
late last night, and former state assemblyman William
Green was the winner in the race for Mayor Edward
Koch's East Side Silk Stocking district seat.
With all 337 precincts reported and all absentee ballots
tallied, Green, a Republican, had 29,633 votes to 29,045
for Abzug, the favorite.
It seemed certain there would be a recount.
Soviets protest space proposal
United Nations — A Soviet official said yesterday his
country is against proposals by Canada and other na
tions for a U.N. working group on ways to avoid acci
dents involving nuclear-powered space satellites.
But Eygeni Fedorov, an academician and member of
parliament, said the Soviet Union was prepared to pay
Canada for damage caused by one of its satellites that
broke up over Canada Jan. 24.
If a satellite causes damage to a country, Fedorov told
the U.N. Outer Space Committee's scientific subcom
mittee, "then the launching state is duty bound to com
pensate for this damage."

Mostly cloudy with a chance of brief light showers.
Fair, cool and windy today through tomorrow. Lows at
night in the upper 30s and 40s. High in the 50s. Westerly
