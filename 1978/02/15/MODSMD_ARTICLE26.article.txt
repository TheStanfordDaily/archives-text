# Library cooperation program expanding
## 
### Matt Mettler 
The existing library cooperation
program between UC-Berkeley
and Stanford has been expanded
to allow registered graduate stu
dents reciprocal borrowing
privileges, according to Anne
Seeley, associate librarian and
c6ordinator of the program.
Prior to Feb. 1 only faculty,
academic staff and doctoral can
didates were eligible to borrow
materials from Cal, Seeley said.
Undergraduates may not check
out materials but may use them at
Cal for reference.
The program is "an experiment
toseeifa majorpublicanda major
private institution can cooper
ate," Seeley explained.
The program's primary purpose
is to coordinate long-range collec
tion of specialized library mate
rials to avoid duplication, Seeley
said. This will allow students at Cal
and Stanford easy access to a grea
ter variety of reference materials
and book collections.

An intercampus shuttle bus ser
vice called the "Gutenberg Ex
press" exists to facilitate student
travel between the two campuses.
All students and faculty are eligi
ble to ride the shuttle buses which
make four round trips daily,
Monday through Friday.
Since last March, when the
program began, 700 students
from the two universities have re
gistered for the cooperation prog
ram. This number is expected to
grow because of the increased
eligibility, Seeley said.
Current cooperation program
plans for 1978 also call for a com
bined listing on microfiche of all
periodicals, journals and other se
rials at the two universities.
Registration cards for the prog
ram can be obtained at the circula
tion service desk in the second
floor rotunda of Green Library.
For further information regarding
eligibility, registration or program
services call extension 497-1491 in
the Green Library.
