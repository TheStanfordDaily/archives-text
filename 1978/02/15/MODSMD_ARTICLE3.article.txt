# Valentine Proposal
## 
### 
Kurt Haug's parents became en
gaged one Valentine's Day a few
years back. So Haug, a freshman liv
ing in Donner, thought it would be a
nice idea to officially propose mar
riage to his sweetheart, fudith
Home, a Foothill College freshman,
on Feb. 14 as well. The result was a
public display of affection; a sign on
the Meyer Library bridge. "It really
wasn't that much of a surprise," said
Haug. "We'd already been looking
at rings." She said "yes." So the two
freshmen plan to marry in a couple
of years, as soon as Haug returns
from his "mission" for the Church
of Latter Day Saints. "We've been
together since the first day we met,"
said Home. "That was at church last
Sept. 26." Haug is serious about the
proposal. He's even selling a prized
possession, his 12-string guitar, to
pay for the engagement ring. The
guitar was a gift from his parents
when he made Eagle rank in Boy
Scouts. (Photo courtesy Cupid.)
