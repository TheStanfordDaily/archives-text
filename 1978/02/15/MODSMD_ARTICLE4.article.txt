The trustees do not invest in cor
porations doing business in South
Africa because they think it helps
apartheid, according to Board of
Trustees President Peter Bing at last
night's ASSU Senate meeting.
The view has been that the "con
tinued presence of American corpo
rations has been a moderating influ
ence on apartheid in a positive way,
in diminishing apartheid," Bing ad
ded.
President Richard Lyman added
"honest minds can differ" about the
most effective means of dealing with
the apartheid regime.
"But my own view is that it still
makes more sense for American in
vestors to try to hold their feet in the
fire," he said, and ask the companies
to do all they can do to help explore
how progress might be made, rather
than divest immediately in a "one
shot deal."
Lyman said he does not believe
that selling all stocks would have
"any effect worth mentioning" on
South Africa. There are many prob
lems closer to home, he added.
Lyman and Bing, invited to appear
before the senate, answered ques
tions on topics including trustee re
visions in the Ad Hoc Committee on
Investment Responsibility (CI R)
statement, the power and authority
of the senate in light of the recent
CIR controversy and divestment.
More than 100 persons attended
the meeting.
Lyman said the companies in
South Africa are in a limited position.
"Corporations can only try to im
prove conditions for a small minority
in South Africa, namely those
employed by the companies," said
Lyman.
Bing added that profits are made
from exploiting people all over the
world. Many companies are involved
in exploiting "known weaknesses,"
tor example, selling liquor to al
coholics, he said. However, he
added this isn't a reason to "opt out
of society."
Questions concerning powers of
the senate have arisen following the
recent controversy in which Lyman
initiated a random selection process

to appoint students to the CIR.
Lyman said he was placed in a
"no-win situation." He said he had
the "unhappy choice" of leaving
students off the CIR, or devising
some means of appointing students.
If the ASSU Constitution were the
constitution of the University, the
president and trustees would have
no right to override the senate deci
sion, he said.
However, in this case, when he
said he felt it was important to bring a
student viewpoint to the commis
sion, he did what he "thought was
right" and approved the random
selection process.
"That's about as far as I can go and
about as far as I believe I have gone,"
he said.
He emphasized he cannot nomi
nate anyone to be a representative of

theASSU.
Bing said the ASSULConstitution is
a part of a series of delegated au
thorities from the trustees.
Bing added his own view is that
"the ASSU Constitution has the
power and authority for what it ena
bles you (the ASSU) to do, not what it
enables you not to do.
"If there were a series of events in
which the ASSU Senate refused to
carry out its obligations and respon
sibilities, I think one would have to
consider what indeed was meant by
the delegation of authority," Bing
said.
Turning to the social concerns of
investment responsibility, Bing said
any individual who makes invest
ments accepts partial responsibility
as an owner.
