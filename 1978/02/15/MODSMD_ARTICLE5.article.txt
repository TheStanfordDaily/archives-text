# Kennedy to give commencement speech

Biology Prof. Donald Kennedy, on
academic leave from the University
to serve as commissioner of the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), will
be the featured speaker at the June
18 commencement exercises, Presi
dent Richard Lyman has announced.
A popular teacher and adminis
trator, Kennedy, 46. headed the
human biology program until last
spring when he took the position
with the FDA. From 1965 to 1972 he
was chairman of the department of
biological sciences.
A selection committee composed
of senior class presidents and rep
resentatives from faculty and ad

ministration considered 120 persons
for the address. Names of 70 of the
persons considered were submitted
by seniors.
Last November, the committee
published a nonexclusive list of 11
persons seriously being considered
for the address. Clark Sterling,
senior class co-president, said the
committee was seeking input from
seniors and others involved. Ken
nedy was not on this list.
Sterling said that because of speak
ing ability and availability considera
tions, none of those listed could be
engaged. The committee met with
Lyman fn January and added five
more names to that list.
Sterling said that at this point it was
too late to elicit further student
input because a prominent person
had to be contacted soon to assure a
good speaker.
Lyman made the final decision.
Kennedy accepted the speech invita
tion about 10 days ago, according to
Jean Fetter, selection committee
organizer and assistant to the presi
dent.
"We feel that President Lyman
went out of his way to honor the
seniors' opinions," said Pam Strike,
another senior class co-president.
They said that most of the names
Lyman considered were those sub
mitted by students and "99 per cent
of the suggestions were very seri
ous."
According to Sterling, the ad
ministration stressed that it would
not be appropriate to invite someone
for the sole reason of his or her popu
larity or entertainment background.
"There have been moves in the
past to get people like Woody Al
len," explained Fetter. "But if you
think of the commencement exer
cises as the culmination of an
academic career, such a choice
would not be appropriate to those
involved."
Seniors last year chose Kennedy to
speak at Class Day exercises. At his
presentation, Kennedy said students
were a "corrupting" influence, shift
ing his interest from hard science
toward public policy questions.
"You seduced me into that dread
ful scientific error: the substitution
of important, unanswerable ques
tions for unimportant, answerable
ones," he told the seniors.

Kennedy has played a major role in
the recent controversy over laetrile
and saccharin. Washington col
leagues have called him "the most
intelligent commissioner in recent
memory. . . impatient with bureauc
ratic thinking.''
In his Class Day talk, he said that
one receives a I6t of "ritual abuse'' in
the regulations business.
"Imagine a basketball game in
which the referee is making every
call perfectly according to some ex
ternal definition of reality. Do you

suppose that half the crowd won't
still boo him? And do you suppose
both coaches will stay on the bench?
No way!
"But the experienced referee rec
ognizes that much of this activity has
a special purpose â€” it is not to
change the decision he has just
made, but rather to get him to shade
the next call. . . .
Fetter pointed out that of the
11,000 students receiving degrees, a
large portion will be post bac
calaureate students.
