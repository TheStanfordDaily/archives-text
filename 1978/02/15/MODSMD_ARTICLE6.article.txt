### Rob Lempert 
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, defended the Uni
versity's move on student CIR ap
pointments last night on KZSU's
Campus Conference.
The Board of Trustees wanted stu
dents "that were in some real sense
representative of the views within
the student body," he said, "but that
doesn't necessarily mean ASSU se
nate appointees."
Rosenzweig said there is no doubt
the ASSU Senators are the legitimate
elected representatives of the stu
dent body, but that they have no
claim to be the true voice of student
opinion. That they contend they are
is just prudent politics, much like the
U.S. president claims to always have
the support of the people, he added.
"The trustees think about the
ASSU even less than I do," said
Rosenzweig. They desire student
representatives on the CIR but they
don't care whether they come from
the senate or not, he added.
The University wants the faculty,
staff and students who serve on Uni
versity committees to bring their in
dividual judgments to meetings and
not try to represent any consti
tuency. If the student members of a
committee have gone through the
normal selection procedure, then
they have the added advantage of
being representatives of the senate
as well as being private individuals,
said Rosenzweig. FHowever, the trus
tees don't consider it vital that the

students represent the senate.
Rosenzweig said he believed Pres
ident Lyman appointing student
members to the CIR despite senate
objections will not harm the credibil
ity of the body.
"The CIR doesn't say anything
about the rest of the system. It is an
aberrant case. . . . This is the first
time this has happened for a very
long time," he said.
The CIR membership will stay the
same regardless of the senate's fu
ture action. The students presently
on CIR took the job planning to do
the work and"it would be very unfair
all round to change anything," said
Rosenzweig. Fie added that when
new CIR members are chosen in the
spring, the senate will have every
right to propose its own nominees.
Rosenzweig also spoke on the
proposed donation of $9 million to
the Hoover Institute by the Volker
fund. This donation is being delayed
in court for two reasons: alleged
conflict of interest and legal ques
tions as to whether the donation fits
the terms of the fund's charter.
Rosenzweig also discussed the re
cent repeal of the Health Manpower
Act, which would have required
medical schools to open their
courses to American medical stu
dents enrolled in foreign schools.
"Nothing would have happened
had it not been for the shrill reaction
of universities like Stanford," he
said.

the terms of the fund's charter.
Rosenzweig also discussed the re
cent repeal of the Health Manpower
Act, which would have required
medical schools to open their
courses to American medical stu
dents enrolled in foreign schools.
"Nothing would have happened
had it not been for the shrill reaction
of universities like Stanford," he
said.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, defended the Uni
versity's move on student CIR ap
pointments last night on KZSU's
Campus Conference.
The Board of Trustees wanted stu
dents "that were in some real sense
representative of the views within
the student body," he said, "but that
doesn't necessarily mean ASSU se
nate appointees."
Rosenzweig said there is no doubt
the ASSU Senators are the legitimate
elected representatives of the stu
dent body, but that they have no
claim to be the true voice of student
opinion. That they contend they are
is just prudent politics, much like the
U.S. president claims to always have
the support of the people, he added.
"The trustees think about the
ASSU even less than I do," said
Rosenzweig. They desire student
representatives on the CIR but they
don't care whether they come from
the senate or not, he added.
The University wants the faculty,
staff and students who serve on Uni
versity committees to bring their in
dividual judgments to meetings and
not try to represent any consti
tuency. If the student members of a
committee have gone through the
normal selection procedure, then
they have the added advantage of
being representatives of the senate
as well as being private individuals,
said Rosenzweig. FHowever, the trus
tees don't consider it vital that the

students represent the senate.
Rosenzweig said he believed Pres
ident Lyman appointing student
members to the CIR despite senate
objections will not harm the credibil
ity of the body.
"The CIR doesn't say anything
about the rest of the system. It is an
aberrant case. . . . This is the first
time this has happened for a very
long time," he said.
The CIR membership will stay the
same regardless of the senate's fu
ture action. The students presently
on CIR took the job planning to do
the work and"it would be very unfair
all round to change anything," said
Rosenzweig. Fie added that when
new CIR members are chosen in the
spring, the senate will have every
right to propose its own nominees.
Rosenzweig also spoke on the
proposed donation of $9 million to
the Hoover Institute by the Volker
fund. This donation is being delayed
in court for two reasons: alleged
conflict of interest and legal ques
tions as to whether the donation fits
the terms of the fund's charter.
Rosenzweig also discussed the re
cent repeal of the Health Manpower
Act, which would have required
medical schools to open their
courses to American medical stu
dents enrolled in foreign schools.
"Nothing would have happened
had it not been for the shrill reaction
of universities like Stanford," he
said.
