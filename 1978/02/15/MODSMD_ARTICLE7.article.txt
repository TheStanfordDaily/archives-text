# People should control gov't.
## Initiative process needed 
### 
Doug Bandow

Senators James Abourezk (D-S.D.)
and Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.), and Rep.
James Jones (D-Okla.), have intro
duced legislation into the Senate and
House which would provide for a na
tional initiative process, encompas
sing all areas except the power to
make war, raise troops, and to prop
ose constitutional amendments.
The proposal would require the
collection of the number of signa
tures equal to three per cent of the
total number of persons who voted
in the last presidential election —
which would be 2,450,000 based on
the 1976 election. The signatures
would have to be gathered within 18
months, and would have to include a
minimum of three per cent of the
eligible signers in each of at least ten
states.
Once the signatures had been val
idated, a referendum would be held
in the next even-numbered year. The
law would go into effect 30 days after
a majority "yes" vote. Congress
could then repeal or amend the law
by a two-thirds vote within two years
of its passage, or by a simple majority
vote after two years.
This measure deserves serious
consideration, and should be pas
sed. Among its most important be
nefits would be its assistance in re
medying the declining confidence in
government, by giving the citizenry
at large an important control over
their governmental rulers. As Ralph
Nader has noted, the national initia
tive would leave "no one to blame
but yourself. The best antidote to
cynicism is to endow the cynics with
power."
Complement to system
Such a processwould complement
our system of representative gov
ernment by providing another pro
cedure to bring about change. A re
calcitrant Congress and powerful
special interest groups could be
bypassed, and much needed legisla
tion could be enacted. The practical
value of the process would be even
greater, in that it would force the
Congress to openly deal with con
troversial issues, rather than burying
them.
The experience of the 23 states and
the countless cities that provide for
an initiative process has been quite
positive. The initiative has proved to
be the ultimate tool in the hands of
the voters, occasionally allowing
them to substitute common sense
for legislative irrationality — such as
Ohio's two-to-one vote to repeal the

state's instant registration law. In
other cases, initiatives, even when
they failed, have forced the legisla
ture to act on isses, such as nuclear
power safety standards in California.
Clarity needed
The process has not been problem
free, but the difficulties are not sur
mountable. Frequently the proposed
initiatives have been overly obtuse
and unclear; this could be solved by
providing a screening mechanism to
enforce some minimal standard of
clarity.
Slanted information, simplistic ar
guments, and last minute decision
making have also undermined the
accuracy of the process, but the
same problems arise in the election
of candidates. In addition, no hid
den, but powerful, special interest
groups can buy off a vote; an open
and public debate, however flawed,
is necessary for a measure's passage.
Another problem his been a legis
lative abdication of responsibilities
by the placement of trivial measures
on the ballot. However, this is a legis
lative failure. As long as the require
ments for qualifying an initiative are
reasonably strict, people would not
be willing to waste time, money, and
energy in qualifying frivolous ones.
Criticism faulty
A number of objections have been
raised to the proposal — none of
which seem persuasive. The most
serious criticism is that public policy
is best shaped by a deliberative body.
Otherwise, it is argued, the cam
paign will not be waged on the
merits, but will be taken over by de
magogues. Columnist Ceorge F. Will
has suggested that "any national in
itiative would be dominated by an
intense, unelected minority using di
rect mail, television commercials and
other techniques of mass persua
sion."
However, 1978 finds voters far
more educated than in 1789, and less
susceptible to demagogues. In addi
tion, the voters must be trusted to
choose between slickly-packaged
candidates, with the same dangers.
At some point one must trust the
people to be intelligent and rational.
More importantly, this criticism
ignores the current realities of the
legislative process. State initiatives
have forced debate on issues above
ground; though the electorate may
be erroneous in the judgment it
makes, it is not so easily bought-off
by special interest groups in the back
rooms. Far too many laws have

been passed solely because of covert
special interest pressure, and not by
a decision on their merits, after a fair
and open debate.
No danger
Another objection is that the initia
tive process would lead to an assault
on generally accepted, but controv
ersial, legislation in fields such as
civil rights and labor relations. Peter
Fish of Duke University, among
others, fears the dangers of a
"majoritarian tyranny."
However, this objection ignores
the fact that some of these areas de
serve an assault. Civil rights laws
should be amended to explicitly ban
all racial discrimination, whether di
rected against blacks, whites, or any
other group. And the national labor
laws are a perverse and expensive
boondoggle, which merely serve as a
full-employment act for lawyers.
More importantly, Congress could
still repeal the law by a two-thirds
vote, and the functions and powers
of the judiciary to intervene would
not be circumscribed by the prop
osed process.
Finally, a trivial objection is that
court challenges would be engen
dered over the validity of signatures
and the constitutionality of indi
vidual initiatives. The latter is down
right silly — many laws passed by
Congress and state legislatures are
challenged, yet we still go on passing
laws. The former is true, but even
candidate elections can suffer from
this problem; in addition, the 23
states with the initiative procedure
appear to be handling the problem
quite well.
A national initiative process would
allow the people of our nation to in
still a little common sense back into
the government. The first measure to
place on the ballot would be one
banning so-called "reverse discrimi
nation." Later measures could in
clude the placement of federal
workers, and Congressmen, under
the Social Security system, the aboli
tion of the monopoly-enforcing and
special interest supported Interstate
Commerce Commission and Civil
Aeronnautics Board, and so on.
It is time for people of this country
to take the control of their country
back, and the initiative process is the
most effective means of doing so.
