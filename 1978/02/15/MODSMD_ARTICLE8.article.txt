# Course evaluations worthy
##

In his letter to the Daily on Feb. 8,
Albert Elsen disagrees with Tom
Faletti who defended course evalua
tions against Robert Cohn's misgiv
ings. Risking an interminable and
boring debate I wish to step up in
turn and defend course evaluations
and course evaluation question
naires. I encountered my first course
evaluation just about ten years ago
(at another universtiy). Its introduc
tion was accompanied by exactly the
same student interest and faculty
doubts that have been displayed in
tbp Daily lately.
Now ten years (and some 20 evalu
ations) later my initially supportive
opinion has been amply confirmed.
There has not been a single evalua
tion that I have not found useful. In
fact, they have returned much value
by permitting me to weed out unde
sirable idiosyncrasies, by helping me
in finding clearer and more or
ganized ways of presenting my
thoughts, and by increasing our con
fidence that the class and I were ac
tually communicating.
I have, ignoring a few crackpots,

always found the comments to be
sincere, well-intentioned and care
fully thought out. In fact, perusing
rather carefully the ASSU Course
Guide, it seems to me that the Stan
ford students are perhaps a little too
well intentioned. It seems extraordi
nary that there would be so many
outstanding, nearly flawless instruc
tors.
There can be no serious argument
that student course evaluation is not a
panacea for general evaluation of
teaching. Nevertheless, having
served on many tenure and promo
tion committees, I have found them
quite useful and sometimes unex
pectedly illuminating. Rarely have I
found that the students went for the
entertainment value at the expense
of solid instruction (although, it
seems to me, presenting solid mate
rial in an attractive way is part of the
job of teaching).
On the contrary, lack of sub
tance, lack of organization, lack of
preparation were invariably among
the principal points of a negative

critique and, as far as I have been
able to tell, generally with some jus
tification. It is unreasonable to ex
pect that, with the course just over, a
student can judge its lasting value for
life or profession.
Position to judge
What he is in an excellent position
to judge, however, is whether he
learned anything, whether his mind
was challenged, whether his thought
processes were honed. A significant
part of each crop of course evalua
tions that I have seen always addres
sed implicitly or explicitly these as
pects.
Thus, although not the only or ul
timate answer to the evaluation of
instructional quality, course evalua
tions provide some important in
sights, to the instructor himself, to
the students, and to his peers. Like
anything else they must be used
wisely and with a fine perception ot
their strengths and weaknesses.
