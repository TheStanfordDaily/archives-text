# Sexist language debate mostly irrelevant

Having been invited to attend the
Feb. 2 meeting of the Faculty Senate,
I witnessed the unspeakably con
fused and, for the most part irrelev
ant, discussion concerning sexist
language. The ASSU had asked the
senate to agree with the spirit of a
resolution concerning language (in
brief, the resolution asked faculty
and students to avoid sexist language
in speaking and writing, and for both
senates to rule sexist language out of
order).
Discussion turned immediately to
the necessity of maintaining the pur
ity of "the well of English undefiled,"
whether Peter Stansky preferred to
be addressed as chairman or chair
person, and whether "sexist" ap
peared in someone's dictionary. I
personally abhor such terms as wait
person and abbreviations like s/he.
As for the term chairperson, it is
largely used of women so does in fact

not solvd" anything (what's wrong
with chairwoman anyway).
Furthermore, since it is pro
nounced -m'n rather than man, -man
as an ending has hardly any more
meaning of "male" than does -er.
Few people seem to be trying to re
place the word woman which has the
sameending(in earlier days the word
meant "female person").
These vocabulary matters are in
fact relatively unimportant, little
more than the "cosmetics" they
were accused of being. However,
because terms like chairperson and
freshperson are a cosmetic issue,
that does not mean that all linguistic
issues are. We must distinguish the
trivial from the non-trivial.
The truly substantive issue, which
was part of the original ASSU resolu
tion, and which three faculty
senators mentioned, but which was
ignored by the senate as a whole, is
the blanket use of the pronoun he to
refer to both men and women. As in
"if the reader accepts these argu
ments, then he must see the folly of
the senate's worry about the pollu
tion of English."
Another aspect of this is the
stereotyping which makes school
teachers she and university profes
sors he (in the last ASSU Course
Guide I was referred to as he). True,
it is hard to build he and she into
sentences elegantly, but it can be
done, and the amount of thought
that goes into the process can only
benefit one's use of language.
The point is that genuine avoi
dance of sexist language involves no
change in the language at all, no ex
punging of extant words, no coining
of new ones, but a change in deep
seated habits of usage.
Many major publishing companies
have addressed themelves to the

substantive issues and have drawn
up editorial guidelines, specifically
aimed at drawing attention to the
necessity of referring to both sexes
under certain circumstances, while
at the same time avoiding inelegance
in the use of pronouns.
I urge both the Faculty Senate and
the ASSU Senate to authorize a
committee to establish editorial
guidelines of a similar sort, for use in
all University-related publications.
The motion "reaffirming the

socioeconomic status of men and
women" that the Faculty Senate sub
stituted for the motion on language
means nothing if women are denied
equality through the greatest
weapon of power we have â€” lan
guage. That such an empty motion
could be substituted for a meaning
ful one shows just how unwilling the
faculty as a whole is to really face
equality.
