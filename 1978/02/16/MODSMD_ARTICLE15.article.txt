# Court favors reporters

San Francisco (AP) â€”The California Supreme
Court yesterday upheld a ruling which allowed
news reporters to attend a juvenile hearing over
the objections of the 17-year-old boy accused of
murder.
"When past media coverage relating to a case
has been neither excessive nor sensational and
the jury pool in the jurisdiction is large, a court
does not err in refusing to bar press representa
tives from a juvenile fitness hearing," said the
unanimous opinion by Justice Stanley Mosk.
"Adequate safeguards are available, should
they be necessary, to protect the defendant's
rights if he is certified to adult court,"the deci
sion added.
The defendant, identified only as Brian W.,
was charged with various offenses including
murder and kidnapping for purposes of rob
bery.
He had been in a minor traffic accident while
driving a car owned by a woman who had disap
peared earlier the same day. He was arrested
and charged with grand theft. The murder and
kidnap charges were added after the body of the
woman, who had been shot to death, was found
several days later on March 18, 1977.
Because Brian was under 18, he was arraigned
in Juvenile Court. The district attorney moved
for a fitness hearing to determine if he should be
tried as an adult and the judge denied Brian's
request to exclude the news media.
The Supreme Court ruling returned the case

to Juvenile Court for further proceedings.
The decision said that "in vesting the judge
with discretion to admit to Juvenile Court pro
ceedings persons having a direct and legitimate
interest in the particular case or the work of the
court, it was the purpose of the Legislature to
allow press attendance at juvenile hearings."
The court said it recognized "the salutary
function served by the press in encouraging the
fairness of trials and subjecting the administra
tion of justice to the beneficial effects of public
scrutiny."
It further indicated it favored the "role of the
press in monitoring the administration of justice
on behalf of the public" rather than placing re
straints on the media.
The ruling also rejected the argument that
should Brian be certified as an adult, press at
tendance at the hearing would jeopardize his
right to a fair trial. It said an impact of adverse
publicity, if it occurred, could be lessened by
change of venue, postponement of the trial,
emphatic instructions to the jury and sequester
ing jurors.
In concurring opinions, Chief Justice Rose
Elizabeth Bird and Justice Frank Newman ex
pressed concern over condoning, even im
pliedly, rules which restrict admission to Los
Angeles Juvenile Court sessions to representa
tives of "recognized news media." They said
this may flout the California Constitution clause
against restraint of the press.
