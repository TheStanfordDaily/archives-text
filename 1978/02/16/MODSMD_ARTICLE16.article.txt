# Pesticide sales outlawed
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The gov
ernment announced yesterday
it will outlaw the sale of about
2000 chemical pesticides to
everyone except farmers and
commercial applicators trained
in their use.
Douglas Costle, adminis
trator of the Environmental
Protection Agency, said the
crackdown involves 23 "poten
tially hazardous" ingredients
used in the manufacture of the
2000 commercial products,
many of which are commonly
used to control insects and
weeds in food crops.
"Competent growers and
applicators will continue to
have the chemical tools they
need to raise crops and control
pests," Costle said in a state
ment. "The public will be pro
tected from possible illness or
environmental contamination
resulting from unskilled use of
those compounds."
Costle said the 23 ingre
dients were restricted "be
cause tes'.s or actual experi

ence showed that these com
pounds can poison people
through excessive skin contact
or inhalation or that the ingre
dients might harm birds, fish
and other wildlife if misused."
He also said the agency is
considering limiting the use of
16 other ingredients to trained
applicators and that more pes
ticides will be studied for simi
lar action in the future.
However, Costle added that
"the vast majority of pesticides
used by backyard gardeners
and homeowners will continue
to be available under the same
conditions that apply now."
About 35,000 pesticide pro
ducts made from more than
1400 ingredients are sold in the
United States.
Manufacturers will have 120
days to attach approved warn
ing labels or supplemental
labels stating "Restricted Use
Pesticide" or other cautionary
warning to products leaving
their plants. Pesticide dealers
will be given 270 days to relabel

existing stocks.
Larry O'Neill, an EPA
spokesman, said that it may be
next fall before many restricted
labels are seen on retail store
shelves.
Only farmers and commer
cial applicators who have been
certified will be legally able to
purchase any of these products
after the labeling requirement
has been started.
An uncertified farmer who
uses a restricted pesticide after
labeling will be subject to
penalties ranging from a sim
ple warning to a maximum fine
of $1000. Commercial
applicators and pesticide sel
lers who violage the rules will
be subject to maximum fines of
$5000.
Among the 23 basic ingre
dients restricted are endrin,
used to kill insects in cotton,
wheat and other grain crops;
ethyl parathion and methyl
parathion, used for cotton, to
bacco, peanuts, soybeans and
other crops; and picloram for
killing weeds and brush.
