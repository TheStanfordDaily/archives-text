# Cards sign four prep All-Americans
## 
### David Georgette 
It's not a draft, but that's
what it amounts to.
Recruiting to shore up areas
that need help, Stanford
signed 12 top football recruits,
including four prep All-
America players, to national
letters of intent yesterday.
But head coach Bill Walsh
and his staff aren't resting yet.
Walsh flew to southern
California last night in an at
tempt to sign a top prep quar
terback who is also being heav
ily recruited by USC. Stanford
is also hoping to land two top
prospects from the Midwest
and one from Washington.
Yesterday, the first day on
which national letters of intent
could be tendered, the Cards
received the signatures of
three of their top five recruits.
The other two are still uncom
mitted.
Looking for help on the de
fensive line, the Cards landed
6-foot-4, 255 lbs. Doug Rogers
from Highlands High School in
Bakersfield and 6-4, 235 lbs.
All-America Steve Ballinger
from Camarillo.
Rogers, the brother of Card
freshman quarterback Grayson
Rogers, chose the Farm over
USC and Oklahoma.
Stanford also nabbed three
defensive backs, including 6-4,
180 lbs. All-America Steve
Simmons from South
Pasadena, the same high
school that produced
freshman safety Robby Chap
man. Simmons, who inter

cepted 10 passes last season
and also played receiver and
quarterback in high school,
could perform at either cor
nerback or safety.
Steve Foley, a 6-2, 198 lbs.
safety from Orange Coast Col
lege — the only JC transfer to
sign — will probably be tried at
the opening left by the gradua
tion of strong safety Ralph Phil
lips.
Foley attended the same
high school as Card receiver
Vince Mulroy.
The third defensive back
prospect starred also on of
fense in high school. Lamont
Atkins (5-11,180 lbs.), the Seat
tle area Scholar-Athlete of the
Year, is a 9.7 sprinter who
rushed for 1054 yards in his
senior season.
Morze to Stanford
Stanford also won the tug
of-war with Cal for prep All-
America linebacker Dave
Morze of St. Francis High in
Mountain View. The 6-4, 210
lbs. Morze was the Northern
California Defensive Player of
the Year and the most highly
recruited player in the Bay Area
this year.
The fourth All-America who
will be enrolling at Stanford is
6-4, 220 lbs. tight end Kevin
Bates from Wyoming High in
Cincinnati, Ohio. Notre Dame
had been actively recruiting
Bates.
The other Midwesterner to
choose Stanford is fullback
Mark Mordell from Detroit,
Mich. The second team all

state selection, who rushed for
925 yards, carried a 6.3 average
and scored nine touchdowns,
had been sought by Michigan.
The Cards also signed All-CIF
Los Angeles wide receiver Tom
Brunansky from West Covina
High. The 6-3, 205 lbs.
Brunansky, a top baseball re
cruit, caught 34 passes for 723
yards and eight touchdowns
this season.
The other three recruits to
sign are 6-4 , 240 lbs. offensive
guard John Delmare from Val
halla High in El Cajon, Calif.,
6-3, 235 lbs. offensive tackle
Dave Bolin from Vintage High
in Napa and 6-5, 205 lbs. tight
end Jay Summers from Torrey
Pines High in Solana Beach,
Calif.
"We are extremely gratified
with these results," said
Walsh. "The recruits we've
signed so far are among the
most highly-sought players in
the country."

Stanford, which could offer
up to 22 scholarships this sea
son, will probably sign about
17 recruits. The NCAA limit for
football players on scholar
ships at any one time is 90, but
in the past Stanford has almost
always remained a few below
that limit.
"We approached recruiting
a little differently this year,"
said Walsh. "After signing 35
players last year, we had fewer
spots to fill. We were in
terested only in players who
could help our program almost
immediately.
"Because of this, we became
involved in tremendously
competitive recruiting," said
Walsh. "We challenged Notre
Dame, Oklahoma, Michigan,
Penn State and other top
schools. Our goal was to re
cruit a select group of players
with great potential, and we
achieved that aim."
In Walsh's first year, Stan
ford made a greater effort to

recruit nationally than it had in
recent years, and met with
some success. Though Bates
and Mordell are the only
players to sign so far who are
not from the West Coast, the
Cards are vying against Notre
Dame and Michigan for two
other top prospects. A
linebacker in Michigan, who is
expected to decide in a couple
of days, is being courted by the
Wolverines. A wide receiver in
Ohio, reported to have lames
Lofton-like credentials, is
choosing between Stanford
and Notre Dame, as is a line
man prospect from Colton,
Wash.
Down south, USC an
nounced the signing of 23
prospects, including seven
high school All-Americans.
Seven of the recruits are from
outside California.
UCLA is also reported to
have had a good recruiting sea
son.

son, will probably sign about
17 recruits. The NCAA limit for
football players on scholar
ships at any one time is 90, but
in the past Stanford has almost
always remained a few below
that limit.
"We approached recruiting
a little differently this year,"
said Walsh. "After signing 35
players last year, we had fewer
spots to fill. We were in
terested only in players who
could help our program almost
immediately.
"Because of this, we became
involved in tremendously
competitive recruiting," said
Walsh. "We challenged Notre
Dame, Oklahoma, Michigan,
Penn State and other top
schools. Our goal was to re
cruit a select group of players
with great potential, and we
achieved that aim."
In Walsh's first year, Stan
ford made a greater effort to

recruit nationally than it had in
recent years, and met with
some success. Though Bates
and Mordell are the only
players to sign so far who are
not from the West Coast, the
Cards are vying against Notre
Dame and Michigan for two
other top prospects. A
linebacker in Michigan, who is
expected to decide in a couple
of days, is being courted by the
Wolverines. A wide receiver in
Ohio, reported to have lames
Lofton-like credentials, is
choosing between Stanford
and Notre Dame, as is a line
man prospect from Colton,
Wash.
Down south, USC an
nounced the signing of 23
prospects, including seven
high school All-Americans.
Seven of the recruits are from
outside California.
UCLA is also reported to
have had a good recruiting sea
son.
It's not a draft, but that's
what it amounts to.
Recruiting to shore up areas
that need help, Stanford
signed 12 top football recruits,
including four prep All-
America players, to national
letters of intent yesterday.
But head coach Bill Walsh
and his staff aren't resting yet.
Walsh flew to southern
California last night in an at
tempt to sign a top prep quar
terback who is also being heav
ily recruited by USC. Stanford
is also hoping to land two top
prospects from the Midwest
and one from Washington.
Yesterday, the first day on
which national letters of intent
could be tendered, the Cards
received the signatures of
three of their top five recruits.
The other two are still uncom
mitted.
Looking for help on the de
fensive line, the Cards landed
6-foot-4, 255 lbs. Doug Rogers
from Highlands High School in
Bakersfield and 6-4, 235 lbs.
All-America Steve Ballinger
from Camarillo.
Rogers, the brother of Card
freshman quarterback Grayson
Rogers, chose the Farm over
USC and Oklahoma.
Stanford also nabbed three
defensive backs, including 6-4,
180 lbs. All-America Steve
Simmons from South
Pasadena, the same high
school that produced
freshman safety Robby Chap
man. Simmons, who inter

cepted 10 passes last season
and also played receiver and
quarterback in high school,
could perform at either cor
nerback or safety.
Steve Foley, a 6-2, 198 lbs.
safety from Orange Coast Col
lege — the only JC transfer to
sign — will probably be tried at
the opening left by the gradua
tion of strong safety Ralph Phil
lips.
Foley attended the same
high school as Card receiver
Vince Mulroy.
The third defensive back
prospect starred also on of
fense in high school. Lamont
Atkins (5-11,180 lbs.), the Seat
tle area Scholar-Athlete of the
Year, is a 9.7 sprinter who
rushed for 1054 yards in his
senior season.
Morze to Stanford
Stanford also won the tug
of-war with Cal for prep All-
America linebacker Dave
Morze of St. Francis High in
Mountain View. The 6-4, 210
lbs. Morze was the Northern
California Defensive Player of
the Year and the most highly
recruited player in the Bay Area
this year.
The fourth All-America who
will be enrolling at Stanford is
6-4, 220 lbs. tight end Kevin
Bates from Wyoming High in
Cincinnati, Ohio. Notre Dame
had been actively recruiting
Bates.
The other Midwesterner to
choose Stanford is fullback
Mark Mordell from Detroit,
Mich. The second team all

state selection, who rushed for
925 yards, carried a 6.3 average
and scored nine touchdowns,
had been sought by Michigan.
The Cards also signed All-CIF
Los Angeles wide receiver Tom
Brunansky from West Covina
High. The 6-3, 205 lbs.
Brunansky, a top baseball re
cruit, caught 34 passes for 723
yards and eight touchdowns
this season.
The other three recruits to
sign are 6-4 , 240 lbs. offensive
guard John Delmare from Val
halla High in El Cajon, Calif.,
6-3, 235 lbs. offensive tackle
Dave Bolin from Vintage High
in Napa and 6-5, 205 lbs. tight
end Jay Summers from Torrey
Pines High in Solana Beach,
Calif.
"We are extremely gratified

Walsh. "The recruits we've
signed so far are among the
most highly-sought players in
the country."

Morze of St. Francis High in
Mountain View. The 6-4, 210
lbs. Morze was the Northern
California Defensive Player of
the Year and the most highly
recruited player in the Bay Area
this year.
The fourth All-America who
will be enrolling at Stanford is
6-4, 220 lbs. tight end Kevin
Bates from Wyoming High in
Cincinnati, Ohio. Notre Dame
had been actively recruiting
Bates.
The other Midwesterner to
choose Stanford is fullback
Mark Mordell from Detroit,
Mich. The second team all

state selection, who rushed for
925 yards, carried a 6.3 average
and scored nine touchdowns,
had been sought by Michigan.
The Cards also signed All-CIF
Los Angeles wide receiver Tom
Brunansky from West Covina
High. The 6-3, 205 lbs.
Brunansky, a top baseball re
cruit, caught 34 passes for 723
yards and eight touchdowns
this season.
The other three recruits to
sign are 6-4 , 240 lbs. offensive
guard John Delmare from Val
halla High in El Cajon, Calif.,
6-3, 235 lbs. offensive tackle
Dave Bolin from Vintage High
in Napa and 6-5, 205 lbs. tight
end Jay Summers from Torrey
Pines High in Solana Beach,
Calif.
"We are extremely gratified
with these results," said
Walsh. "The recruits we've
signed so far are among the
most highly-sought players in
the country."

Stanford, which could offer
up to 22 scholarships this sea
son, will probably sign about
17 recruits. The NCAA limit for
football players on scholar
ships at any one time is 90, but
in the past Stanford has almost
always remained a few below
that limit.
"We approached recruiting
a little differently this year,"
said Walsh. "After signing 35
players last year, we had fewer
spots to fill. We were in
terested only in players who
could help our program almost
immediately.
"Because of this, we became
involved in tremendously
competitive recruiting," said
Walsh. "We challenged Notre
Dame, Oklahoma, Michigan,
Penn State and other top
schools. Our goal was to re
cruit a select group of players
with great potential, and we
achieved that aim."
In Walsh's first year, Stan
ford made a greater effort to

recruit nationally than it had in
recent years, and met with
some success. Though Bates
and Mordell are the only
players to sign so far who are
not from the West Coast, the
Cards are vying against Notre
Dame and Michigan for two
other top prospects. A
linebacker in Michigan, who is
expected to decide in a couple
of days, is being courted by the
Wolverines. A wide receiver in
Ohio, reported to have lames
Lofton-like credentials, is
choosing between Stanford
and Notre Dame, as is a line
man prospect from Colton,
Wash.
Down south, USC an
nounced the signing of 23
prospects, including seven
high school All-Americans.
Seven of the recruits are from
outside California.
UCLA is also reported to
have had a good recruiting sea
son.
It's not a draft, but that's
what it amounts to.
Recruiting to shore up areas
that need help, Stanford
signed 12 top football recruits,
including four prep All-
America players, to national
letters of intent yesterday.
But head coach Bill Walsh
and his staff aren't resting yet.
Walsh flew to southern
California last night in an at
tempt to sign a top prep quar
terback who is also being heav
ily recruited by USC. Stanford
is also hoping to land two top
prospects from the Midwest
and one from Washington.
Yesterday, the first day on
which national letters of intent
could be tendered, the Cards
received the signatures of
three of their top five recruits.
The other two are still uncom
mitted.
Looking for help on the de
fensive line, the Cards landed
6-foot-4, 255 lbs. Doug Rogers
from Highlands High School in
Bakersfield and 6-4, 235 lbs.
All-America Steve Ballinger
from Camarillo.
Rogers, the brother of Card
freshman quarterback Grayson
Rogers, chose the Farm over
USC and Oklahoma.
Stanford also nabbed three
defensive backs, including 6-4,
180 lbs. All-America Steve
Simmons from South
Pasadena, the same high
school that produced
freshman safety Robby Chap
man. Simmons, who inter

cepted 10 passes last season
and also played receiver and
quarterback in high school,
could perform at either cor
nerback or safety.
Steve Foley, a 6-2, 198 lbs.
safety from Orange Coast Col
lege — the only JC transfer to
sign — will probably be tried at
the opening left by the gradua
tion of strong safety Ralph Phil
lips.
Foley attended the same
high school as Card receiver
Vince Mulroy.
The third defensive back
prospect starred also on of
fense in high school. Lamont
Atkins (5-11,180 lbs.), the Seat
tle area Scholar-Athlete of the
Year, is a 9.7 sprinter who
rushed for 1054 yards in his
senior season.
Morze to Stanford
Stanford also won the tug
of-war with Cal for prep All-
America linebacker Dave
Morze of St. Francis High in
Mountain View. The 6-4, 210
lbs. Morze was the Northern
California Defensive Player of
the Year and the most highly
