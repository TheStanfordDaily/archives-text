# Boys Town Center researches youth

Major implications for govern
ment policies may result from re
search currently underway at the
Boys Town Center for the Study of
Youth Development here, a center
spokesman said.
Studies focusing on the affects of
day care and foster care on children
and youth are at the "observation
and collecting stage," according to
Boys Town Center Director Albert
Hastorf.
Hastorf added that the goal of the
Boys Town Center "is to be more dri
ven by problems than theory. We
lookatworld problems and do policy
research."
The center, which will move to the
Quad as soon as reconstruction is
completed, is temporarily located on
Via Crespi Street. The center has op
erated there since it was established
by Boys Town of Nebraska and the
University in March 1974.
According to Hastorf, "One of our
major functions is to serve as an in
terdisciplinary nucleus." The cent
er's staff members are drawn from
the departments of anthropology,
education, law, psychology, sociol
ogy and psychology.
At weekly discussion meetings
staff members exchange ideas on
their research and progress reports.
The meetings also help individuals
from different academic fields to
bridge the language and conceptual
barriers between them.
The center uses many techniques
to recruit subjects for its studies.
Birth records may be checked to lo
cate individuals of specific interest to
the researchers. Some persons are
studied within an institutional set
ting, such as a school or prison.
For many studies, subjects are
compensated for their participation.
Payments range from $2 to $4 per
hour. Because of their proximity to

the center, the majority of the sub
jects are recruited from the area bet
ween San Francisco and San Jose.
According to Linnea Marenco, an
administrative assistant at the center,
difficulties arise with scheduling sub
jects and means for transporting
them to the center. Marenco also
said "In some cases, people are leery
about what will go on in the re
search." Once the procedure has
been explained, however, most do
decide to participate.
Graduate and undergraduate stu
dents also participate in Boys Town
Center research.
"The work graduate students do
on larger projects may represent a
segment of their theses," Hastorf
explained.
Undergraduates may incorporate
their work at the center into honors
theses or human biology projects.
"Undergraduates are involved in
lots of different phases of research,"
said Prof. Sueann Ambron, a princi
pal investigator for the day care
studies. "While usually working
closely with graduate students, un
dergraduates collect, code and
analyze research data," Ambron
said. They also may participate in un
dergraduate seminars, where topics
of interest are discussed.
"They really get quite an education
on this project," Ambron stated.
The University's Boys Town Center
is funded mostly by the Boys Town of
Nebraska, according to Marenco.
The center is under contract to re
ceive slightly less than half a million
dollars annually for 25 years starting
in 1974.
The funds permit Boys Town re
searchers to carry out long-term ex
periments, Marenco said.
Boys Town funds sometimes are
employed as "seed funds" to de
velop projects, Hastorf said. The re
searchers can then cite their prelimi

nary data when seeking further sup
port from outside sources.
"Funding is one of the major prob
lems in this tight budget time," Has
torf said.
joint sponsors of the center's re
search include the National Institute
of Health, the Food Foundation and
the National Science Foundation.
Boys Town of Nebraska allocated
one and a half million dollars to es
tablish a permanent facility for the
center in March 1974. The center will
eventually move into Margaret Jacks
Hall, the basement and first floor of

the former physiology building in the
Quad, Marenco said.
Although reconstruction was
scheduled for completion by Jan. 1,
1979, Marenco said she expects a
iater completion date.
The center will gain additional
space for offices, meeting rooms,
laboratories and audiovisual
facilities.
"The location is definitely a plus
factor," Marenco said. "The center
will be centrally located to many de
partments on campus."
