# Ducks visit Maples
## What happened to Oregon? 
### 
Guard Rob Closs grabbed the missed free
throw, raced down court and went in for a lay-in.
That made the score 66-61 with less than two
minutes left, and sent the Oregon Ducks on
their way to a 2-0 record in the Pacific-8 and an
11-3 record overall.
But since that win over Stanford on the first
weekend of the conference season, the Ducks
— once considered legitimate contenders —
have plummeted towards the depths of the con
ference standings. They lost six straight in the
Pac-8 until they beat Washington, 64-60, last
Saturday, and enter tonight's game against
1-8 Stanford (11-11 overall) tied for sixth. Tip-off
at Maples Pavilion is 8 p.m. (KZSU 90.1 FM, KSFO
560 AM).
And in Eugene, the Ducks' hometown, Ore
gon basketball is almost as important as the
health of the local economy. A losing season
can just about qualify the winter as a waste of
time.
Blaine Newnham, the sports editor of the
Eugene Register-Guard, said the reason for the
Ducks' poor season is a basic one. "They've shot
the ball very poorly. That's probably been the
biggest problem/' he said.
When the Ducks traveled to Washington,
theirteam shooting percentage hovered around
the 30 per cent level. "They haven't been able to
find any consistency on offense," said New
nham.
The one Duck who has a scoring average in
double figures, center Dan Hartshorne (10.4), is
no longer a starter and has had his problems on
defense.
In coach Dick Harter's disciplined offense,
the Ducks have been getting good shots, but
missing them. There is no star player to carry the
team during critical periods. The Ducks don't
have someone like Greg Ballard or Ron Lee this
season, and as Newnham said, "Nobody's as
serted themselves shooting the ball."
Against USC, Closs suffered a stress fracture
in his leg, and hasn't played since, though he

might see some action tonight. Without Closs,
the Ducks' other guard Mike Drummond has
had trouble finding open shots. Losing Closs,
said Newnham, "put a lot of pressure on the
offense."
Harter has gone to starting four freshmen now
with the senior Drummond. Phil Barner, one of
the first-year players, is out of Oakland's Frem
ont High and has been starting most of the sea
son, averaging 9.6 points a game. In the
frontcourt, the Ducks have 6-foot-10 center Rich
Davis, 6-8 Mike Clark and 6-4 Felton Sealy, who
Newnham said, "has really become a catalyst."
But until volatile Harter decided to build to
wards next season by playing freshmen this
year, "he was very frustrated," said Newnham.
"But he hasn't threatened to shoot anybody."
Improved
"We have been an improved team the last
four or five games," said Harter, "but the
scoreboard hasn't shown it. We got the ball in
side in the stretch against Washington and that
gave us a win that should pick us up even more
in the coming games."
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso's outlook for his
team is similar. "We've played very well in our
last three games," he said. "We've gone up
against the best two teams in our league and
played very hard. If we continue to play with as
much effort as we have in our last three games,
we're going to win some of our remaining
games."
Forward Kimberly Belton, who scored 15
points against USC and UCLA last weekend, re
mains the Cards' leading scorer with a 15.1 aver
age.
"Belton has been playing exceptional basket
ball, despite painful tendinitis in his knee," said
Dißiaso. "I think he's established himself as one
of the top forwards in the league."
Meanwhile, the Ducks and the Cards have
established themselves as the most disappoint
ing teams in the league.
