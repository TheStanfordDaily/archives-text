The opening night performance of "The Tragic History of Dr. Faustus" by
the Bureau of Western Mythology was tJie finest ensemble drama I've ever
seen.
I believe it was the blending of theatrical experimentation together with
elements designed to keep this show entertaining that pleased the audi
ence so much. Although the script was altered in such a manner that the
play no longer conformed with tragedy, the action was tragic. Among the
devices used to enthrall the audience were extra lyrics, pantomime, actual
audience participation and a large variety of dance routfnes. Surprisingly
enough, with all this the play spanned only two hours. This is one of the
first reviews of a Bureau of Western Mythology production, but it is now
clear where the creative campus theater really has been.
Even with a cast this good, it's possible to single out the exceptionally
talented members. Lucifer himself (Sam Ambler, who also plays Charles V,
the Duke of Vanholt and the Pope) is so stunningly performed that his
purchase of Faustus' soul is real. The Sort erer's Apprentk e (Felix Winters)
is excellent both in his soliloquy and in several comic exchanges with the
Clown. Finally;the human characterizations ot the Seven Deadly Sins may
not be subtle, but they were clever and tunn\
The technical aspects of this production were adequate, which is a
victory, considering the obvious limitations ot Tresidder Main Lounge, For
example, the production staff has ( one eived ot dividing both the audience
seating and playing areas into fourteen sections and then mixing them
arour)d for homogenity. This, together with the different stage construc
tions, pulled watchers' attention deeply into the acting of the play. Con
sequently, the audience had no difficulty discerning the meaning of the
dialogue, which was in the form of Marlowe's beautiful verse.
Although the action of the play lasts J 4 years, the performances only
continue on Friday and Saturday tor the next two weeks at 8 p.m. each
evening.
