## Horowitz delights 
### 
Last Sunday afternoon a
small aristocratic man, late as
always, sauntered out to the
piano on the San Francisco
Opera House stage, nodded to
the audience and began to
play. The concert had been
sold out for months, and hun
dreds had lined up 12 hours be
fore to get expensive standing
room tickets. The listeners,
many of them young, were ut
terly silent while the man
played, applauding and cheer
ing when he finished. During
intermission, one name was on
everyone's lips: Vladimir
Horowitz.
Horowitz was hailed as a
prodigy when he first played in
the U.S., 50 years ago this year.
In 1938, hedecided to take a
rest which with few
exceptions,lastedalmost three
decades. When he returned in
1965, he was hailed again as
one of the greatest pianists in
this century. He has now
added an exceptionally large
number of young people to his
older admirers.
Individualist
Horowitz is an extreme indi
vidualist and hence almost
impossible to review. A twen
tieth century romantic in the
mold of Rachmaninoff, his in
terpretations are boldly unique
and intensely personal. One
immediately notices his incred
ible rangeof color; heisableto
portray any emotion in the
music. His technique changes
accordingly.
For example, in the Mozart
"Sonata K. 330," he hunched
over the keys, wrists limp
rather than arched, and af
fected the sound of a
clavichord, a bell-like sparkling
tone betraying the Steinway.
But Horowitz interpreted
romantically, infusing passion
into this "easy sonata," often
interpreted mechanically or
left to children. One should
remember that, despite mod
ern predilections, Mozart's
contemporaries considered
him an anti-classicist, although
Horowitz's style was unknown.

In the Liszt "B minor
Sonata," a Horowitz favorite,
he captured the wide range of
sensibilities enthusiastically of

fered by the score. Horowitz
empathizes with Liszt as much
as anyone. In his early days,
when he was known as a vir
tuoso, he would have pounded
his way through, all tire and
brimstone (the recordings still
exist); but in later life he has
been tempered by the pro
found reflection that marks a
mature artist.
In Liszt, the soft yearning
passages, the ones which ask
questions rather than answer
them, moved me the most. His
technique was impressive, if
not perfect, as bold double oc
taves roamed up and down the
keyboard, but the feathery
touch of the final portion
reached higher.
A Faure "Nocture" and "Im
promptu" contrasted with one
another, once again exhibiting
Horowitz's versatility. The first
was sober, dulled, almost
fatalistic, while the second rip
pled and shimmered through
light runs, which he inter
preted with wit, and a very faint
smile.
The high point
Horowitz's interpretation of
the Chopin "A Minor Waltz,"
in my opinion, surpassed any
thing else on the program. In
this, one of Chopin's slow
waltzes, Horowitz played with
sensuous melancholy, captur
ing the essence of this sort of
Chopin. The audience emitted
an audible sigh as he finished
the final chords.
The "Carmen Variations,"
composed by Horowitz at age
18, exemplifies the flashy vir :
tuosity of his youth. This was
pure Horowitz: a rolicking
beat, lengthy passages of im
possible chords, and a catchy
tune; daring twentieth century
harmonies distinguished by
the nineteenth century roman
ticism of Bizet.
Horowitz responded to the
enthusiastic applause with
three encores. A spirited Scar
latti sonata was followed by a
segment from the Schumann
"Scenes from Childhood"
which almost recreated the
magic of the Chopin piece. He
finished with a rude
Rachmaninoff polka as if to say
that music is just good fun.

an audible sigh as he finished
the final chords.
The "Carmen Variations,"
composed by Horowitz at age
18, exemplifies the flashy vir :
tuosity of his youth. This was
pure Horowitz: a rolicking
beat, lengthy passages of im
possible chords, and a catchy
tune; daring twentieth century
harmonies distinguished by
the nineteenth century roman
ticism of Bizet.
Horowitz responded to the
enthusiastic applause with
three encores. A spirited Scar
latti sonata was followed by a
segment from the Schumann
"Scenes from Childhood"
which almost recreated the
magic of the Chopin piece. He
finished with a rude
Rachmaninoff polka as if to say
that music is just good fun.
Last Sunday afternoon a
small aristocratic man, late as
always, sauntered out to the
piano on the San Francisco
Opera House stage, nodded to
the audience and began to
play. The concert had been
sold out for months, and hun
dreds had lined up 12 hours be
fore to get expensive standing
room tickets. The listeners,
many of them young, were ut
terly silent while the man
played, applauding and cheer
ing when he finished. During
intermission, one name was on
everyone's lips: Vladimir
Horowitz.
Horowitz was hailed as a
prodigy when he first played in
the U.S., 50 years ago this year.
In 1938, hedecided to take a
rest which with few
exceptions,lastedalmost three
decades. When he returned in
1965, he was hailed again as
one of the greatest pianists in
this century. He has now
added an exceptionally large
number of young people to his
older admirers.
Individualist
Horowitz is an extreme indi
vidualist and hence almost
impossible to review. A twen
tieth century romantic in the
mold of Rachmaninoff, his in
terpretations are boldly unique
and intensely personal. One
immediately notices his incred
ible rangeof color; heisableto
portray any emotion in the
music. His technique changes
accordingly.
For example, in the Mozart
"Sonata K. 330," he hunched
over the keys, wrists limp
rather than arched, and af
fected the sound of a
clavichord, a bell-like sparkling
tone betraying the Steinway.
But Horowitz interpreted
romantically, infusing passion
into this "easy sonata," often
interpreted mechanically or
left to children. One should
remember that, despite mod
ern predilections, Mozart's
contemporaries considered
him an anti-classicist, although
Horowitz's style was unknown.
Liszf
In the Liszt "B minor
Sonata," a Horowitz favorite,
he captured the wide range of
sensibilities enthusiastically of

fered by the score. Horowitz
empathizes with Liszt as much
as anyone. In his early days,
when he was known as a vir
tuoso, he would have pounded
his way through, all tire and
brimstone (the recordings still
exist); but in later life he has
been tempered by the pro
found reflection that marks a
mature artist.
In Liszt, the soft yearning
passages, the ones which ask
questions rather than answer
them, moved me the most. His
technique was impressive, if
not perfect, as bold double oc
taves roamed up and down the
keyboard, but the feathery
touch of the final portion
reached higher.
A Faure "Nocture" and "Im
promptu" contrasted with one
another, once again exhibiting
Horowitz's versatility. The first
was sober, dulled, almost
fatalistic, while the second rip
pled and shimmered through
light runs, which he inter
preted with wit, and a very faint
smile.
The high point
Horowitz's interpretation of
the Chopin "A Minor Waltz,"
in my opinion, surpassed any
thing else on the program. In
this, one of Chopin's slow
waltzes, Horowitz played with
sensuous melancholy, captur
ing the essence of this sort of
Chopin. The audience emitted
an audible sigh as he finished
the final chords.
