## What is 'Dawg music'? 
### 
When it comes to classifying
and categorizing, music critics
rank right up there with social
scientists as the main propo
nents of the art. Take this
example found in a press pac
kage describing the David
Crisman Quintet: "an eclectic
blend of jazz, swing and classi
cal orchestral parts lightly sea
soned with a country bluegrass
flavor. . From reading this,
one would surmise that this
band does just about every
thing except Led Zeppelin.
The fact is that Grisman's
music simply defies categoriza
tion. Using two mandolins,
acoustic guitar, upright bass
and violin, the band makes
music that is all their own.
Grisman calls it "Dawg music."
It's just a name for something
you can't really define," he
says. "To make it in the busi
ness you might as well have
something unique." The
sound of the quintet, however,
is more than simply unique.
It's, well, what can one say?
Superunique? Oh God. Let's
just call it an eclectic blend of
jazz, swing and classical orch
estral parts lightly seasoned
with a country bluegrass flavor
and leave it at that.
Oh God
Definitions aside, Grisman's
brand of acoustic music is in
fectuous, as his performance
last week at the Palo Alto Keys
tone aptly demonstrated. The
group cooked through two
hour long sets that featured
tunes from their album, "The
David Grisman Quintet,"
along with some traditional
sounding bluegrass and ver
sions of jazz numbers by such
artists as Wes Montgomery and
Chick Corea.
Now any band that does
both bluegrass and Chick
Corea is bound to have trouble
marketing itself. One of the
ways a major record company
sells a record is by hyping it in a
certain category; for example,
"singer-songwriter," "country
rock," "rock-jazz fusion," and
so on. The consumer can then
read about it in his favorite
music mag, and promptly head
to the designated section in his
local record shop and pick it

out with ease.
The problem for a band like
Grisman's is that very few re
cord shops have a special sec
tion labeled "Eclectic Blends of
)azz, Swing and Classical
Orchestral Parts Lightly Sea
soned with a country Bluegrass
Flavor." So, one can imagine
that the big companies might
not be so eager to sign the
David Grisman Quintet.
So what?
Their album, on a Bay Area
label called Kaleidoscope, is
one of the largest selling small
label releases of all time, but
Grisman points out that "this
record might have been out of
print on (for example) Colum
bia already. . .I know if I called
up George Benson's producer
and said, 'I'm ready man, and
my guitar player sings, too,' he
could, for his percentage, use
his imagination and come up
with something. And because
of his track record and the fact
that he put . , . strings and
horns on and used Airto or
something, itwouldsell. But so
what? ... I don't see a reason
to do that, I don't think it's that
adventurous."
Since its inception in 1975,
the band has played mostly on
the West Coast, and has also
built up quite a following in ja
pan. "We're famous in )apan,"
says Grisman. "See, japan is
like much hipper musically
than the United States in terms
of American music. In America
. . . you go to the record store
and you find in the bin, say for
bluegrass, what the record
companies are currently put
ting out. But in lapan you just
find the good stuff, whether it
was recorded 20 years ago or it
just came out."
No doubt
There's no doubt his band
will build a large following
wherever it plays, and Grisman
would like to tour the East,
possibly when the winter
weather lets up. A virtuoso
mandolin player, he composes
most of the band's original
music. Guitarist Tony Rice also
writes, and plays bluegrass
based runs that are almost in
comprehensibly fast, so fast

that his playing might sound
somewhat sterile, if he were
the only soloist in the group,
but his playing actually pro
vides a perfect counterpoint to
the more lively solos of Gris
man and violinist Darol Anger.
Add to this bassist Bill Amat
neek, who can lay down a
thumping bluegrass bottom
and just as easily swing into a
jazzy walk, and you have quite
a combination.
But it's the interplay bet
ween Grisman and second
mandolinist Todd Phillips that
gives the band such an unusual
sound. Having two mandolins
allows one player to keep a
percussive rhythm while the
other is soloing.
The overall precision with
which the second mandolin
and the rest of the band keep
time is one of the reasons they
can get away without using a
percussionist. "I wouldn't ever
have a drummer," explains
Grisman, "because for a
drummer to get into his thing
and me to get into mine . . .
there's no way. I'd have to use
an amp."
So pure
He points out that one
reason the band's sound is so
pure is that they use no
amplification other than mic
rophones. "These were all
built before they had mic
rophones," he says of the
band's instruments, all of
which were built between 1856
and 1934. "For the first six
months, this band played a lot
of gigs totally without any
sound system in little holes and
churches, and people didn't
have any trouble hearing. If
people shut up and listen and
there's something happening
. . . acoustic instruments
sound beautiful."
Another reason the group
produces such excellent sound
is that they prefer to play small
halls. "I can draw the limit
when it's not effective any
more," he says. "Economi
cally, you can make a good liv
ing never playing for more than
three or four thousand
people."
Performing original, creative

music in an era when just about
everything sounds alike and
not much of it sounds good,
Grisman is quite an innovator
with his blending of various
styles. But he doesn't think
he's actually breaking any new
ground musically. "I think a
good objective is to try not to
be boring ... I can't really say
to you that I'm a musical
pioneer. I mean if you listen to
Bach . . . there's been so much
heavy music come down in the
universe that this stuff is, well
it's contemporary." Ah, now
there's the word. Contempor
ary. The David Grisman Quin
tet is contemporary in every
sense of the term.
The word
This band will always have an
audience as long as they're to
gether, but don't expect Dawg
Music to be the latest rage, the
wave of the future, or the next
journalistic hype once punk
stories become too boring to
sell magazines. Grisman wants
to play to anyone who will lis
ten, and he hopes there will be
many, but he knows the limita
tions of noncommercial music.
"I'm willing to keep making
these albums and see if I can
keep paying my rent. I don't
think mass culture is the
greatest thing to ever hit the
planet ... to have the biggest
rating or to be at the top of the
charts is not my goal. I think it's
kind of sick ... I mean look at
George Benson. Great guitar
player, and I can't say a bad
thing about him. But he's not
doing his greatest artistic work
by a long shot."
David Grisman is in a unique
situation. His music is so spe
cial that it doesn't need two
page ads in Rolling Stone to
sell. The band can just concen
trate on playing, and the music
will sell itself. "I'm content to
let the music stand on its own,"
he says. And I've gotten
enough feedback so that if I
didn't believe in it myself, I'd
know it's happening anyway.
But I do (believe in it), and so
I'm just interested in seeing
what happens next." What
happens next can only be more
creative work from the David
Grisman Quintet.
