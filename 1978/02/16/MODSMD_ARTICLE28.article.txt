## Costello: Zeitgeist of our time 
### 
I really hate it when rock re
viewers elevate their subject to
such a lofty plane that they lose
their perspective on rock's re
lationship to the real world. I
don't like to hear about Bruce
Springsteen's angst and I can't
appreciate it when people talk
of the weltshmerz of Paul Si
mon; I cringe at hearing
wholism used in anv context,
but when that context is Dylan I
really get upset.
Watching the
In light of these prejudices it
becomes very difficult to dis
cuss any rock figure seriously,
vvhic h is unfortunate, because
that is precisely what I plan to
do. I saw strange looking Elvis
Costello last week at Zeller
bach Auditorium in Berkeley
and he was fantastic, so I feel
obligated to do him some sort
of justice; not to take him so
seriously that he becomes con
tused with Chaucer and chem
lab, but to at least make him
appear intelligent and under
sjandable.
Detectives
The idea of nostalgic recon
struction is the key to the ap
preciation of Elvis Costello. All
facets of his performance are
organized around the premise,
"What would life in the 50's
have been like with their music
and our values?" What it boils
down to is Costello showing us
his namesake Elvis Presley sing
ing DRUGS, SEX, and VIO
LENCE, seen on a badly
flickering television set. I'm
sure that some of you who saw
Costello on "Saturday Night
Live" were so repulsed that
you had to wash your hands
after turning him off; this is an
understandable reaction, he
is uglv of sight and song.

The problem with his televi
sion debut was that he needs
the continuity of an entire
evening to establish his charac
ter and so justify his music and
appearance. When in charac
ter, he has the hype appeal of
David Bowie, but out of it he
comes off as low grade new
wave.
Costello's character is a seri
ous, unsmiling, angry man
who is pigeon-toed, perform
ing every action in short
mechanically spastic jerks. This
doesn't make him too appeal
ing. When confronted with his
high repulsion factor in the
song "Miracle Man," he exp
lains it away defensively say
ing, "Don't you think that I
know that walking on water
won't make me a miracle
man."
Just like
It is obvious that the strength
of such songs depends on Cos
tello's success at maintaining
this assumed personality; he
did a fantastic job. He was so
careful, in fact, that he did not
sing his most popular song,
"Allison," because as a ballad it
would have been out of place
with his character.
The rest of his persona is a
perverse parody of Elvis Pre
sley, in which the latter's fam
ous pelvic gyrations are re
placed by knockkneed stumbl
ing. A more amazing substitu
tion was for Presley's habit of
raising his right shoulder on
tough guitar licks, while show
ing an orgasmic pout; Costello
on several occasions would
look gracelessly over his right
shoulder and twitch. . . .
Watching them
I think at this point it be
hooves me to clear Costello's

reputation, regarding his al
leged punk rock influences.
Yes, there are elements that
play a large part in both, such
as the preoccupation with vio
lence, or the vision of apathetic
youth with no future, but the
attitude towards these is en
tirely different. In punk the vio
lence is fabricated, situational,
and its participants are those
who are performing. Not so for
Elvis: the action here is all off
stage. In such songs as "Less
than Zero" or the menacing
reggae "Watching the Detec
tives," the violent images are
observed, rather than in
vented, and as such are more
realistic and pointed.
Shoot
This observational status al
lows Costello to be much more
restrained than his punk rock
counterparts, who depend so
much on the excessive, con
tinuously shocking their audi
ence. An example of this is
"Watching the Detectives," in
which Costello describes a girl
who is an avid fan of television
violence; to match the subtle
horror of a line like, "She's fil
ing her nails while they're
dragging the lake," an equiva
lent punk song would have to
begin, "The gutted torso
With subdued comparisons
Costello has achieved what
punk can only do with blood.
Moreover, although both
Costello and punk have em
braced early rock as the music
best suited to their purpose
their justifications are entirely
different. In punk such music
works because it is primitive,
rough-edged, and simple
enough for the groups to play.

(The Ramones don't play three
chord songs out of choice.)
Shoot
With Elvis, however, the
period feel of the music is an
integral part of the act. His
back-up group is tight, the
sound well-mixed, and the ar
rangements slick and carefully
conceived, inspiring wild as
sociations with a bygone era.
That era was smack in the
middle of Elvis Costello's for
mative years, much of which
he probably spent listening to
Elvis Presley and theotherearly
rockers. What he is talking
about then is the image of liv
ing his own youth without the
naivite that was so present in
the music of the '50s; he is no
longer innocent of the vulgar
elements that surrounded him.
In "I'm Not Angry" what be
gins as a typical baby-come
back-all-is-forgiven is trans
formed into a realistic open
eyed acknowledgement of the
way things are:
I know what you been doing
I know where you've been
I know where, but I don t care,
cause ther's no such thing as
an original sin.
Shoot
True, this couldn't pass as
Wallace Stevens, but it's still
pretty eloquent as far as the
medium goes. The whole point
is not to say that he's great, but
that he's exciting. It's not that
he embodies an accurate rep
resentation of the interface be
tween social structures in our
recent past, but that he has a
catchy gimmick. It's not that
you should sell your mother
for a full body tattoo; it's just
that the next time Bill Graham
brings him around Elvis can
show you a good time.

With Elvis, however, the
period feel of the music is an
integral part of the act. His
back-up group is tight, the
sound well-mixed, and the ar
rangements slick and carefully
conceived, inspiring wild as
sociations with a bygone era.
That era was smack in the
middle of Elvis Costello's for
mative years, much of which
he probably spent listening to
Elvis Presley and theotherearly
rockers. What he is talking
about then is the image of liv

naivite that was so present in
the music of the '50s; he is no
longer innocent of the vulgar
elements that surrounded him.
In "I'm Not Angry" what be
gins as a typical baby-come
back-all-is-forgiven is trans
formed into a realistic open
eyed acknowledgement of the
way things are:
I know what you been doing
I know where you've been
I know where, but I don t care,

an original sin.

True, this couldn't pass as
Wallace Stevens, but it's still
pretty eloquent as far as the
medium goes. The whole point
is not to say that he's great, but
that he's exciting. It's not that
he embodies an accurate rep
resentation of the interface be
tween social structures in our
recent past, but that he has a
catchy gimmick. It's not that
you should sell your mother

A nostalgic performance was given by Elvin Costello at Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium last week.
Costello parodies Elvis Presley with some of his antics on stage, but has added his own satiric style.
I really hate it when rock re
viewers elevate their subject to
such a lofty plane that they lose
their perspective on rock's re
lationship to the real world. I
don't like to hear about Bruce
Springsteen's angst and I can't
appreciate it when people talk
of the weltshmerz of Paul Si
mon; I cringe at hearing
wholism used in anv context,
but when that context is Dylan I
really get upset.
Watching the
In light of these prejudices it
becomes very difficult to dis
cuss any rock figure seriously,
vvhic h is unfortunate, because
that is precisely what I plan to
do. I saw strange looking Elvis
Costello last week at Zeller
bach Auditorium in Berkeley
and he was fantastic, so I feel
obligated to do him some sort
of justice; not to take him so
seriously that he becomes con
tused with Chaucer and chem
lab, but to at least make him
appear intelligent and under
sjandable.
Detectives
The idea of nostalgic recon
struction is the key to the ap
preciation of Elvis Costello. All
facets of his performance are
organized around the premise,
"What would life in the 50's
have been like with their music
and our values?" What it boils
down to is Costello showing us
his namesake Elvis Presley sing
ing DRUGS, SEX, and VIO
LENCE, seen on a badly
flickering television set. I'm
sure that some of you who saw
Costello on "Saturday Night
Live" were so repulsed that
you had to wash your hands
after turning him off; this is an
understandable reaction, he
is uglv of sight and song.

The problem with his televi
sion debut was that he needs
the continuity of an entire
evening to establish his charac
ter and so justify his music and
appearance. When in charac
ter, he has the hype appeal of
David Bowie, but out of it he
comes off as low grade new
wave.
Costello's character is a seri
ous, unsmiling, angry man
who is pigeon-toed, perform
ing every action in short
mechanically spastic jerks. This
doesn't make him too appeal
ing. When confronted with his
high repulsion factor in the
song "Miracle Man," he exp
lains it away defensively say
ing, "Don't you think that I
know that walking on water
won't make me a miracle
man."
Just like
It is obvious that the strength
of such songs depends on Cos
tello's success at maintaining
this assumed personality; he
did a fantastic job. He was so
careful, in fact, that he did not
sing his most popular song,
"Allison," because as a ballad it
would have been out of place
with his character.
The rest of his persona is a
perverse parody of Elvis Pre
sley, in which the latter's fam
ous pelvic gyrations are re
placed by knockkneed stumbl
ing. A more amazing substitu
tion was for Presley's habit of
raising his right shoulder on
tough guitar licks, while show
ing an orgasmic pout; Costello
on several occasions would
look gracelessly over his right
shoulder and twitch. . . .
Watching them
I think at this point it be
hooves me to clear Costello's

reputation, regarding his al
leged punk rock influences.
Yes, there are elements that
play a large part in both, such
as the preoccupation with vio
lence, or the vision of apathetic
youth with no future, but the
attitude towards these is en
tirely different. In punk the vio
lence is fabricated, situational,
and its participants are those
who are performing. Not so for
Elvis: the action here is all off
stage. In such songs as "Less
than Zero" or the menacing
reggae "Watching the Detec
tives," the violent images are
observed, rather than in
vented, and as such are more
realistic and pointed.
Shoot
This observational status al
lows Costello to be much more
restrained than his punk rock
counterparts, who depend so
much on the excessive, con
tinuously shocking their audi
ence. An example of this is
"Watching the Detectives," in
which Costello describes a girl
who is an avid fan of television
violence; to match the subtle
horror of a line like, "She's fil
ing her nails while they're
dragging the lake," an equiva
lent punk song would have to
begin, "The gutted torso
With subdued comparisons
Costello has achieved what
punk can only do with blood.
Moreover, although both
Costello and punk have em
braced early rock as the music
best suited to their purpose
their justifications are entirely
different. In punk such music
works because it is primitive,
rough-edged, and simple
enough for the groups to play.

tion was for Presley's habit of
raising his right shoulder on
tough guitar licks, while show
ing an orgasmic pout; Costello
on several occasions would
look gracelessly over his right
shoulder and twitch. . . .
Watching them
I think at this point it be
hooves me to clear Costello's

reputation, regarding his al
leged punk rock influences.
Yes, there are elements that
play a large part in both, such
as the preoccupation with vio
lence, or the vision of apathetic
youth with no future, but the
attitude towards these is en
tirely different. In punk the vio
lence is fabricated, situational,
and its participants are those
who are performing. Not so for
Elvis: the action here is all off
stage. In such songs as "Less
than Zero" or the menacing
reggae "Watching the Detec
tives," the violent images are
observed, rather than in
vented, and as such are more
realistic and pointed.
Shoot
This observational status al
lows Costello to be much more
restrained than his punk rock
counterparts, who depend so
much on the excessive, con
tinuously shocking their audi
ence. An example of this is
"Watching the Detectives," in
which Costello describes a girl
who is an avid fan of television
violence; to match the subtle
horror of a line like, "She's fil
ing her nails while they're
dragging the lake," an equiva
lent punk song would have to
begin, "The gutted torso
With subdued comparisons
Costello has achieved what
punk can only do with blood.
Moreover, although both
Costello and punk have em
braced early rock as the music
best suited to their purpose
their justifications are entirely
different. In punk such music
works because it is primitive,
rough-edged, and simple
enough for the groups to play.

(The Ramones don't play three
chord songs out of choice.)
Shoot
With Elvis, however, the
period feel of the music is an
integral part of the act. His
back-up group is tight, the
sound well-mixed, and the ar
rangements slick and carefully
conceived, inspiring wild as
sociations with a bygone era.
That era was smack in the
middle of Elvis Costello's for
mative years, much of which
he probably spent listening to
Elvis Presley and theotherearly
rockers. What he is talking
about then is the image of liv
ing his own youth without the
naivite that was so present in
the music of the '50s; he is no
longer innocent of the vulgar
elements that surrounded him.
In "I'm Not Angry" what be
gins as a typical baby-come
back-all-is-forgiven is trans
formed into a realistic open
eyed acknowledgement of the
way things are:
I know what you been doing
I know where you've been
I know where, but I don t care,
cause ther's no such thing as
an original sin.
Shoot
True, this couldn't pass as
Wallace Stevens, but it's still
pretty eloquent as far as the
medium goes. The whole point
is not to say that he's great, but
that he's exciting. It's not that
he embodies an accurate rep
resentation of the interface be
tween social structures in our
recent past, but that he has a
catchy gimmick. It's not that
you should sell your mother
for a full body tattoo; it's just
that the next time Bill Graham
brings him around Elvis can
show you a good time.

A nostalgic performance was given by Elvin Costello at Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium last week.
Costello parodies Elvis Presley with some of his antics on stage, but has added his own satiric style.
I really hate it when rock re
viewers elevate their subject to
such a lofty plane that they lose
their perspective on rock's re
lationship to the real world. I
don't like to hear about Bruce
Springsteen's angst and I can't
appreciate it when people talk
of the weltshmerz of Paul Si
mon; I cringe at hearing
wholism used in anv context,
but when that context is Dylan I
really get upset.
Watching the
In light of these prejudices it
becomes very difficult to dis
cuss any rock figure seriously,
vvhic h is unfortunate, because
that is precisely what I plan to
do. I saw strange looking Elvis
Costello last week at Zeller
bach Auditorium in Berkeley
and he was fantastic, so I feel
obligated to do him some sort
of justice; not to take him so
seriously that he becomes con
tused with Chaucer and chem
lab, but to at least make him
appear intelligent and under
sjandable.
Detectives
The idea of nostalgic recon
struction is the key to the ap
preciation of Elvis Costello. All
facets of his performance are
organized around the premise,
"What would life in the 50's
have been like with their music
and our values?" What it boils
down to is Costello showing us
his namesake Elvis Presley sing
ing DRUGS, SEX, and VIO
LENCE, seen on a badly
flickering television set. I'm
sure that some of you who saw
Costello on "Saturday Night
Live" were so repulsed that
you had to wash your hands
after turning him off; this is an
understandable reaction, he
is uglv of sight and song.

The problem with his televi
sion debut was that he needs
the continuity of an entire
evening to establish his charac
ter and so justify his music and
appearance. When in charac
ter, he has the hype appeal of
David Bowie, but out of it he
comes off as low grade new
wave.
Costello's character is a seri
ous, unsmiling, angry man
who is pigeon-toed, perform
ing every action in short
mechanically spastic jerks. This
doesn't make him too appeal
ing. When confronted with his
high repulsion factor in the
song "Miracle Man," he exp
lains it away defensively say
ing, "Don't you think that I
know that walking on water
won't make me a miracle
man."
Just like
It is obvious that the strength
of such songs depends on Cos
tello's success at maintaining
this assumed personality; he
did a fantastic job. He was so
careful, in fact, that he did not
sing his most popular song,
"Allison," because as a ballad it
would have been out of place
with his character.
The rest of his persona is a
perverse parody of Elvis Pre
sley, in which the latter's fam
ous pelvic gyrations are re
placed by knockkneed stumbl
ing. A more amazing substitu
tion was for Presley's habit of
raising his right shoulder on
tough guitar licks, while show
ing an orgasmic pout; Costello
