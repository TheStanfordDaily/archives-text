## Clapton awesome 
### 
It was last Friday when I saw
Eric Clapton play at the Oak
land Coliseum and I'm still in
awe of the spectacle which I
witnessed there.
Player, whose single "Baby
Come Back'' has made it big,
opened the show with a 45 mi
nute set of good, solid music.
Player is a talented group with
an original sound that is re
freshing to hear in contrast to
the "New Wave" and some of
the other garbage that is being
passed off as music these days.
With a little time and experi
ence, Player could evolve into
a headliner. Peter Beckett is a
strong lead guitarist who can
really throw down a riff. The
group needs only to get some
consistency in their songwrit
ing to really catch on.
But this review is about Eric
Clapton.
Or should I say Derek' Or
In ithc"
Whatever, I could not help
but get the feeling that both
Eric and Derek were on stage
Friday. Clad in straight leg
jeans, vest, hat and a T-shirt
that proclaimed, "No Snow No
Show."
Without being introduced,
which really wasn't necessary
anyway, Clapton started in
with "Peaches and Diesel," a
melodic instrumental from his
new album, "Slowhand."
'Cocaine'
As if fulfilling an obligation
to his newest followers, he

continued in a relaxed view for
"Wonderful Tonight," "Lay
Down Sally" and "Next Time
Vou See Her." After livening
up a little for "The Core," Clap
ton gave tribute to his favorite
songwriter by playing two
acoustic numbers by Don Wil
liams. Marcy Levy followed
with her own composition,
"Fool's Paradise."
At that point, Clapton ges
tured to his T-shirt, said "Here
we go," and broke into a sizzl
ing version of J.). Cale's
"Cocaine."
From then on, Clapton
played the kind of guitar that I
had only dreamed about hear
ing. Even his efforts with
Cream, Blind Faith and Derek
and the Dominos could not
match what he layed down Fri
day.
"Badge" followed
"Cocaine" and the guitar work
just got hotter and hotter. A
flawless rendition of "Double
Trouble," including multiple
blues leads, was his sole rep
resentative from the "No
Reason To Cry" LP. Levy then
gave Clapton a rest by taking
the spotlight for the Dominos'
tune, "Nobody Knows When
You're Down and Out."
Clapton came back for a sea
ring 10-minute version of "Let it
Rain," another Dominos clas
sic. Bob Dylan's "Knockin' on
Heaven's Door" was Clapton's
only reggae piece of the even
ing as he quickly turned to the

blues with "Key to the High
way," yet another Dominos
song.
'Ramblin'
Halfway through the blues
medley which followed, the
entire band shifted to the key
of E on Clapton's command for
his arrangement of "Ramblin
on My Mind."
Stepping tothe microphone,
Clapton then said the words
that proceeded to bring the
crowd rushing to the stage.
"This is the last song we're
going to do tonight. It's the
oneyou'veall been waiting for,
so have fun with it." So saying,

the band struck into "Layla,"
with back-up guitarist George
Terry playing lead, note-for
note the way Clapton made it
famous. Keyboardist Dick Sims
played a Domino-esque solo to
go with Terry's slide guitar solo
later in the song. Though Terry
is no Duane Allman on slide
guitar, credit must be given to
him for a capable slide solo that
didn't try to sound like an
Allman imitation.
"Bottle of Red Wine,"
another Domino era song writ
ten by Clapton and Delaney
Bramlett, was the band's first
encore. By this time, the crowd
was ecstatic and would not let

them leave the stage until Levy
once again stepped forward to
sing "You'll Never Walk
Alone," from the musical
"Carousel."
Clapton seems more confi
dent and relaxed. Never
before has Clapton been com
fortable enough in front of an
audience to move around on
stage and communicate with
the listeners. He has always
been known to be hesitant
when talking about his past,
but Friday he seemed to have
no trouble relating to the audi
ence about his last perfor
mance in Oakland with Blind
Faith.

noticeably more relaxed and confident than in some of his previous concerts.
