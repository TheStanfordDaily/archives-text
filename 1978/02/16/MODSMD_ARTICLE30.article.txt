Herb Moore
Improvariation
The musical scene here
in recent years has not
been particularly lively.
The good music which we
listen to is generally pro
vided by outsiders. Im
provised music, in particu
lar, is almost a lost art
here; jam sessions, jazz
concerts, and classes are
almost non-existent.
Because of this it is re
freshing to hear a musician
like Herb Moore making
excellent improvised
music right under our
noses. Moore has ap
peared here frequently
and has just come out with
a tape of what he terms
"improvariation."
Moore defines impro
variations as "variations
and improvizations on a
particular motif or pat
tern." The music is not
jazz in the traditional
sense, but borrows from a
variety of sources. One
can tell that Moore has his
roots in bluegrass, but also
has been influenced by
classical guitarists. In this
manner his work resem
bles the austere, almost
classical jazz of groups like
Oregon.
The playing is clean and
well recorded. Much of
the tape is solo guitar, but
there is also some fine
support from Leonard
Hanichak on bass and Rob
Fruchtman on cello.

Moore seems more daring
and innovative on the solo
segments, and perhaps
that is why I prefer them.
Moore has a good sense
of textures and dynamics,
but one sometimes wishes
he would be more ex
perimental in his har
monies. There is one
bluesy solo section on the
tape which is really engag
ing.
Billy Hart
Enhance
The latest album by Billy
Hart on the Horizon label
has much to offer. The
side-men are excellent.
Don Pullen, Dave Holland,
Eddie Henderson, and
Oliver Lake are premier
musicians. Unfortunately,
the album doesn't always
cohere.
The avant-garde players
of today have begun to
sound often as trite and
cliched as the bop musi
cians they were once re
belling against. The long
growls and squeaks on the
saxophone, the rumbling
piano, the percussion flur
ries have ail become well
known tricks of the trade.
Too often "Enhance" falls
into this grind.
Hart's drumming is,
nonetheless, fantastic,
and is a saving grace on
this album. The one musi
cal moment which makes
the album really worth get
ting is Hannibal Peterson's
"Raahsan is Beautiful."

of today have begun to
sound often as trite and
cliched as the bop musi
cians they were once re
belling against. The long
growls and squeaks on the
saxophone, the rumbling
piano, the percussion flur
ries have ail become well
known tricks of the trade.
Too often "Enhance" falls
into this grind.
Hart's drumming is,
nonetheless, fantastic,
and is a saving grace on
this album. The one musi
cal moment which makes
the album really worth get
ting is Hannibal Peterson's
"Raahsan is Beautiful."
