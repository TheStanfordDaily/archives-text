Allen Drury, the Pulitzer Prize
winning author of "Advise and Con
sent," held an informal discussion at
the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity
house Tuesday night.
Drury was questioned on a
number of topics ranging from poli
tics to newspaper work to writing a
novel.
About former President Richard
Nixon, Drury said, "I think where he
goofed everything up was in the
cover-up. And then he went on TV
and lied to the American people. No
one had ever tried that before."
Drury also criticized President
)immy Carter's lack of leadership.
"There is a lot more criticism in the
cloak room (of the Senate) than gets
out. I don't think he fully realizes the
powerand effect he (Carter) has. . . .
"I think he is still surrounded by
his own little Nixonian-type group,
and it's very difficult for those with
more experience like Tip O'Neill
(House Majority Leader) to get
through to him," Drury said.
When queried on the relationship
between the press and politicians,
Drury responded, "Smart politicians
know the press and know how to cul
tivate it. They know which specific
press people to talk to."
Drury is not a stranger to the press
or to politics. He began his journalis
tic experience here at Stanford,
working three years for the Stanford
Daily. He wrote a column entitled
"Bull Session," in which he spoke

out on world events as well as on
University policy.
"When I didn't agree with the Uni
versity position, I let them know it,"
Drury said.
After graduating from Stanford,
Drury joined United Press, now Un
ited Press International (UPI), where
he claims he got "the luckiest break
of my life. In fact, it has determined
my whole life since then."
He was put in charge of covering
the Senate for United Press. After
changing newspapers twice, Drury
finally ended up at the New York
Times.
"It's funny," he said. "After
graduating from college I decided to
go to Washington for a year, just to
get a different feel for life. And I
ended up staying 20 years."
In 1959, Drury left the newspaper
business. His novel was a huge suc
cess.
"I had been writing since I was
about 10 years old, and this novel
(Advise and Consent) was something
I had been working on," he said.
Being around politics Drury said
he thought it was only natural that he
write a novel about it. He said, "The
main subject of my novels is power,
how people get it, what they do with
it and how it affects them."
Drury's newest novel, "Anna Hast
ings," deals with the story of a
Washington newspaperperson who
rises up to head a multi-media or
ganization.
