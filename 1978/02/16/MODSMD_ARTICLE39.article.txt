Coal strike talks held at White House
Washington — President Jimmy Carter brought union
and industry negotiators together in a rare White House
meeting last night in an effort to find an end to the 72-day
coal strike.
Labor Secretary Ray Marshall reported that the ses
sion, lasting more than an hour, "went very well." He
said the discussions were devoted to procedural ques
tions and added that bargainers would hold substantive
talks beginning this morning at the Labor Department.
United Mine Workers President Arnold Miller also
expressed satisfaction with the session. Industry
negotiators left the White House without comment.
Marshall said the mood of the session was good, but
discussions became "heated" at times. He said the
meeting "set a good foundation for meetings tomor
row."
Economy not threatened by coal strike
Washington — The long coal strike, entering its 73rd
day today, is not threatening President Jimmy Carter's
economic program yet. It could cause short-term dam
age to employment and production figures, however,
administration economists said yesterday.
"We don't foresee any major economic impact at least
for the next month," said William Nordhaus, a member
of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, who is
heading up a top-level analysis to assess the consequ
ences of the record-long strike.
He said economists think the maximum impact from a
statistical standpoint would be a reduction of 0.25 per
cent in the nation's gross national product during the
first quarter of 1978.
Oil leak found on the Alaskan pipeline
Fairbanks, Alaska — The $7.7 billion trans-Alaska
pipeline was shut down yesterday because of an oil leak
near here. The leak may have been caused by sabotage,
federal authorities said.
"There are some indications that it is sabotage. You
have to suspect foul play," said Morris "Jack" Turner of
the federal Alaska Pipeline Office.
"We have an indication of an explosion," said an FBI
agent.
The Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. said the cause was
undetermined, however, and no other details were im
mediately available.
Turner said the spill was at a low point of the line and
that the oil would "tend to drain out, like a garden
hose."
He said an engineering profile of the spill site esti
mated that up to 20,000 barrels could spill, and that the
oil was flowing at a rate of about two to three barrels a
second and was not controlled.
Begin protests U.S. aircraft sales
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin yester
day bitterly protested the U.S. decision to sell warplanes
to Egypt and Saudi Arabia and said he would go to
Washington next month to try to smooth over the
growing quarrel between Israel and its chief ally and
arms supplier.

"With all respect I turn to the president of the United
States and ask that he reconsider the decision he took
last night, because it contains a grave danger to the
peacemaking process and to Israel's security," Begin
said in a speech to the Israeli Parliament.
He said the first U.S. sale of combat aircraft to Egypt
would reinforce what he called ultimatums issued by
President Anwar Sadat in peace talks and would encour
age saber-rattling in the Egyptian press.
The United States "has to understand that the supply
of aggressive weapons at this time cannot be other than
... an obstacle to peace negotiations."
Rep. Flood cited for bribery
Washington — A Washington lobbyist has told the FBI
he gave Rep. Daniel Flood $1000 cash in what he under
stood was a payment for Flood's aid in helping several
West Coast trade schools win accreditation, court re
cords show.
Deryl Fleming, who acted as a lobbyist for the trade
schools, gave the statement to the FBI on May 23,1977,
while under protective custody and cooperating with
the federal government in several cases.
The Department of Health, Education and Welfare
received several letters in 1972 from Flood demanding
action to help the schools get accreditation. A Pennsyl
vania Democrat, Flood has for 10 years headed the
House subcommittee that handles HEW's appropria
tions.
In a statement issued by his office, Flood said, "I deny
these allegations are true, and in view of ongoing inves
tigations as reported in the news media, I have no
further comment on the matter at this time."
Carter declares disaster area
Santa Barbara — As mudslides continued to claim
Southern California homes yesterday, President Jimmy
Carter declared eight counties a disaster area.
The declaration, requested by Gov. Jerry Brown ear
lier this week, "was the result of severe storms, high
tides, wave action, high winds, mudslides and flooding
beginning about Feb. 5," said Bob Blair of the Federal
Disaster Assistance Administration.
Blair said the FDAA and the state would set up assis
tance centers throughout the area this week, where
persons could apply for government aid.
