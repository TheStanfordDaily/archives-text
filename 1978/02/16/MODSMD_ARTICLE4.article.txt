# Communist increase poses no big threat

Membership in Communist par
ties around the world increased by
5Vi million in the last year, making
the world communist total over 70
million, according to Richard Staar,
associate director of the Hoover In
stitution.
However, he added that most
party figures come from Communist
Party publications.
The American Communist Party
claims 18,000 members, an increase
of 3000 over last year, but Staar says
"this figure is probably inflated."
The last presidential election
somewhat shows this figure "infla
tion." The communist party ran Gus
Hall and although he ran in almost
every state, he ended up with a very
low vote, according to Staar.
Additional party information
comes from former communists who
have broken off from their party to
form other organizations. They claim
that the party inflates its membership
figures.
Although Staar's skepticism about
the 18,000 member figure is an "es
timated guess," he asserts that
"Communism in the United States
doesn't really amount to anything.
It's relatively unimportant."
The effects of the increased mem
bership on the global scene are also
negligible. Staar asserted, "Com
munism is getting stronger only if the
communists run the countries."
But since the areas where the in
creases occurred are already com
munist countries, "There is no real
threat to the United States."
Communist membership in China
increased by five million, which ac
counts for 90 per cent of the
worldwide increase. This raises Chi
na's Communist membership to 35
million, which constitutes half the
world membership. The remaining
10 per cent growth occurred in
communist regimes in Eastern
Europe, mainly the Soviet Union.
"Much more successful (than the
Communist parties) in terms of size
and propaganda activities are inter
national front organizations," Staar
declared. These organizations have

affiliates in most countries and they
claim a membership of over half a
billion, he said.
Still, Staar says he does not worry
about these organizations posing a
threat to the United States. He
claims, "One has the impression that
some are aging, which may affect
their vitality. Certain foreign prob
lems, especially the question of apar
theid in South Africa, still arouse a
considerable degree of moral fervor
in the West, a sense of commitment
that communists attempt to channel
for their own purposes.
"But in many cases, mundane is
sues of the day are perhaps insuffi
ciently emotive to attract a following
and the attention required to sustain
such mass organizations," he said.
