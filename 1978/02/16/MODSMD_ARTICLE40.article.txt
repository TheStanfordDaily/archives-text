Correction
Yesterday's Daily article, "Protes
ters get hostile receptions," incor
rectly implied that the reason Larkin
residents were unreceptive to the
Stanford Committee for a Responsi
ble Investment Policy (SCRIP) mem
bers who had marched to the house
was because of an interrupted Valen
tine's Day party.
Larkin residents claim that their
basic disagreement with SCRIP'S pol
icy of divestment for South African
related corporations' stocks was the
reason for the group's action Tues
day night.
The freshman dorm residents say
they support majority black rule in
South Africa but not the means by
which SCRIP wants it to come about.
