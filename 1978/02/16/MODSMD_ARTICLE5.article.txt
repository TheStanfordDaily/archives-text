# Agreement on black majority control reached in Rhodesia
## 
### 
Salisbury, Rhodesia (AP) — Prime
Minister lan Smith and moderate
black politicians agreed yesterday on
a plan for black majority rule in
Rhodesia, but nationalist guerrillas
rejected the proposal out of hand
and U.S. diplomat Andrew Young
expressed fear it would bring a
black-versus-black bloodbath.
"A victory for moderation," Smith
called the accord after he and the
three black leaders emerged smiling
from the red-brick negotiating hall in
the plush white suburb of Highlands.
For 10 weeks, the two sides had been
arguing over the blueprint of a new
constitution calling for universal suf
frage and containing safeguards for
whites.
Young, U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations who has been
negotiating with nationalist guerril
las, said in New York that the pact
could lead to "another Angola-type
war" with 40,000 guerrillas pouring
into Rhodesia from nearby Tanzania
and Zambia.
And a co-leader of the guerrillas,
immersed in a 5Vi-year struggle to
overthrow Smith by violence instead
of talk, dismissed the agreement
peremptorily.
"It will not work," said Joshua
Nkomo, speaking in Lusaka, the
Zambian capital. "The war con
tinues. We now know who the
enemies are."
Nkomo's forces operate from
bases in Zambia. He and his partner
in the Patriotic Front alliance,
Mozambique-based guerrilla chief
Robert Mugabe, rejected the Salis

bury talks in advance as a "farce" and
did not attend.
Young, who is black, said after yes
terday's announcement that the Un
ited States and Britain now would
have to bring black moderates and
guerrillas together, but Nkomo dis
missed that idea as "nonsense."
Nonetheless, Smith was jubilant.
"We have succeeded in overcom
ing because we have shown tre
mendous patience and we were not
prepared to give in," said Smith.
He led Rhodesia's 263,000 whites
in declaring independence from Bri
tain 12 years ago to forestall handing
over power to the 6.7 million blacks
and ending the white control that
began in the 19th-century days of
colonization.
The eight-point agreement calls
for one-man, one-vote elections to a
100-member parliament, with 28
seats reserved for whites for at least

10 years.
The acrord prescribes a bill of
rights and protection against
nationalization or seizure of prop
erty and land; an independent
judiciary, public service board, civil
service, police and army; guarantees
that pensions be freely paid outside
Rhodesia and permission for Rhode
sians to maintain double citizenship.
Still to be resolved are the nature
of an interim government to draw up
the majority rule constitution, the
final shape of the document, the fu
ture makeup of the armed forces —
now 80 per cent black but led by
whites — and dates for the elections
leading to black rule.
Smith agreed to meet again today
to begin discussing the transition
with the three black leaders —
Bishop Abel Muzorewa, Chief
Jeremiah Chirau and Elliot Gabellah,
a stand-in for the Rev. Ndabaningi
Sithole.

Salisbury, Rhodesia (AP) — Prime
Minister lan Smith and moderate
black politicians agreed yesterday on
a plan for black majority rule in
Rhodesia, but nationalist guerrillas
rejected the proposal out of hand
and U.S. diplomat Andrew Young
expressed fear it would bring a
black-versus-black bloodbath.
"A victory for moderation," Smith
called the accord after he and the
three black leaders emerged smiling
from the red-brick negotiating hall in
the plush white suburb of Highlands.
For 10 weeks, the two sides had been
arguing over the blueprint of a new
constitution calling for universal suf
frage and containing safeguards for
whites.
Young, U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations who has been
negotiating with nationalist guerril
las, said in New York that the pact
could lead to "another Angola-type
war" with 40,000 guerrillas pouring
into Rhodesia from nearby Tanzania
and Zambia.
And a co-leader of the guerrillas,
immersed in a 5Vi-year struggle to
overthrow Smith by violence instead
of talk, dismissed the agreement
peremptorily.
"It will not work," said Joshua
Nkomo, speaking in Lusaka, the
Zambian capital. "The war con
tinues. We now know who the
enemies are."
Nkomo's forces operate from
bases in Zambia. He and his partner
in the Patriotic Front alliance,
Mozambique-based guerrilla chief
Robert Mugabe, rejected the Salis

bury talks in advance as a "farce" and
did not attend.
Young, who is black, said after yes
terday's announcement that the Un
ited States and Britain now would
have to bring black moderates and
guerrillas together, but Nkomo dis
missed that idea as "nonsense."
Nonetheless, Smith was jubilant.
"We have succeeded in overcom
ing because we have shown tre
mendous patience and we were not
prepared to give in," said Smith.
He led Rhodesia's 263,000 whites
in declaring independence from Bri
tain 12 years ago to forestall handing
over power to the 6.7 million blacks
and ending the white control that
began in the 19th-century days of
colonization.
The eight-point agreement calls
for one-man, one-vote elections to a
100-member parliament, with 28
seats reserved for whites for at least

10 years.
The acrord prescribes a bill of
rights and protection against
nationalization or seizure of prop
erty and land; an independent
judiciary, public service board, civil
service, police and army; guarantees
that pensions be freely paid outside
Rhodesia and permission for Rhode
sians to maintain double citizenship.
Still to be resolved are the nature
of an interim government to draw up
the majority rule constitution, the
final shape of the document, the fu
ture makeup of the armed forces —
now 80 per cent black but led by
whites — and dates for the elections
leading to black rule.
Smith agreed to meet again today
to begin discussing the transition
with the three black leaders —
