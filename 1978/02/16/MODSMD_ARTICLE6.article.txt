# Change suggested for tenure system
## 
### Emily Sachar 
Improvements might still be made
in the manner of achieving student
input on tenure decisions here, ac
cording to Albert Hastorf, professor
of psychology and member of the
advisory board of the Academic
Council.
University procedures for tenure
decisions now require that individual
departments and administration of
ficials rule on whether to recom
mend a given individual for tenure
candidacy. Students have no direct
say in evaluating tenure candidates.
A suggested improvement in the
ASSU Task Force report on tenure
and teaching quality, formulated last
February, calls for retrospective
evaluation, said Larry Diamond,
1976-77 task force chairman.
In the retrospective evaluation
method, students wait several years
after completing a course before
commenting on the professor's
teaching ability and value of the
course.
Arguments
"Many people argue vehemently,
and not foolishly, that the best evi
dence of a teacher's ability comes
five or six years after the student has
graduated," said Hastorf. "Some
times upon further evaluation, a per
son will realize that a course had
more significance than he once
thought."
The Faculty Senate subcommittee
on evaluation and improvement of
teaching has ultimate responsibility
for implementingchanges suggested
by the task force report, according
to Diamond.
"I hope the recommendation is
not forgotten. It is important to im
prove teaching quality here and it
(retrospective evaluation) should not
be considered a dead topic,"
Diamond said.
Hastorf advocates another policy;

encouraging personal interviews
with graduate students who have had
contact with tenure candidates.
"Working as a TA gives a graduate
student certain insights which could
be communicated and used as part of
the evaluation process for tenure
appointments," Hastorf said.
The primary recommendation of
the task force called for mandatory
evaluation of all courses offered at
the University, and this suggestion
has been successfully implemented
by the subcommittee, Diamond said.
Evidence
"This method is extremely impor
tant. We've always wanted some sort
of evidence of teaching ability but
we've recently firmed up on the qual
ity and quantity of those recommen
dations," Hastorf said.
"There is still continued argument
over whether questionnaires give
good qualitative evidence of a pro
fessor's ability," Hastorf said. "It
would be more helpful if students
filled in the free response sections
with constructive comments. The
trend is just to joke, even when
evaluating good professors," he con
tinued.
Another major problem in current
teacher evaluation practices is that
volunteers presenting letters in sup
port of an individual's candidacy tell
little. Any group of students can
come up with 50 letters supporting
one professor, Hastorf said.
Research results
Diamond added that task force re
search results showed "an incentive
system at work in which faculty vie
wed tenure decisions to depend on
quality of research a great deal. Con
sequently, faculty were more wor
ried about research and often spent
more time on research.
"Our recommendations were
aimed to bring more attention to
teaching quality," Diamond said.
