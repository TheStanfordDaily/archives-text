# Tibet upholds human rights

On Jan. 10, you published an arti
cle by Moshe Aelion, entitled "Rep
ression unreported," which chose
Tibet as "the obvious place to start" a
discussion of unreported violations
of human rights around the world.
Since then, scores of Chinese stu
dents have come to see me, raising
various questions about Aelion's as
sertions concerning Tibet. These
students know me as the author of
"The Historical Status of Tibet," pub
lished by the King's Crown Press of
Columbia University in 1956. I
thought that the answers to their
questions might be of interest to
your readers.
Aelion writes that "the People's
Republic of China illegally annexed
Tibet in 1949." This is entirely con
trary to historical fact. Tibet's union
with China can be traced to 641 A.D.,
when the T'ang dynasty emperor
T'ai-tsung gave the princess Wen
ch'eng in marriage to Sron-tsan
gampo, the ruler of Tibet. From that
time on, Tibet was never an inde
pendent state.
Historical relationship
Aelion, a graduate student in
physics, can not be expected to
know much about the religion of
Tibet. But I cannot help correcting
his erroneous reference to "the
Dalay Lamas," for this will help illus
trate this historical relationship bet
ween China and Tibet. At any given
time, there is only one Dalai Lama,
who holds the highest position,
comparable to a pontiff, in the Tibe
tan theocracy. When the present
Dalai Lama (14th in line) was installed
on Feb. 22, 1940, he, like his pre
decessors, received his patent of in
vestiture from the central Chinese
government delivered in person by
Wu Chung-hsin, Chairman of the
Commission for Mongolian and
Tibetan Affairs.
And, had there been more than
one claimant to the Pontiff Chair, the
final choice would have been made
by Wu Chung-hsin, who would have
drawn lots from a golden urn specifi
cally sent from Peking in 1793 by Em
peror Ch'ien-lung for such an occa
sion. The process by which the Dalai
Lamas were chosen and invested can

only repudiate an assertion that Tibet
was independent of China.
When the People's Republic of
China was established in 1949, its
leaders, in accordance with this
long-standing tradition, regarded
Tibet as a part of China, albeit a part
which should be given a certain de
gree of autonomy in local affairs.
They invited Tibetan leaders to
negotiate the details of the relation
ship between Lhasa and Peking. In
Feb. 1951, the Dalai Lama dispatched
a delegation headed by Ngapo
Ngawang-Jigme (then a minister in
Lhasa, now a high official in the Pek
ing government) to Peking. The
negotiations produced a 17-article
agreement, "Measures for the
Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," which
was signed on May 23, 1951. It was
only then that the People's Libera
tion Army entered Tibet. It is not cor
rect to say, then, that Tibet was "il
legally annexed in 1949."
Since 1951, there has been sub
stantial social and economic prog
ress in Tibet. Perhaps the most im
portant of these reforms was the lib
eration of the Tibetan serfs, which
occurred in the late 19505. Felix
Greene, the well-known British
journalist, made a film of Tibet last
summer, which shows the striking
contrasts between past and present
in Tibet, and the general satisfaction
of the ordinary Tibetan people with
their life since 1951.
In a talk at Kresge Auditorium last
October, as reported in the Daily on
Nov. 1, Greene also said that the
Chinese, including the Tibetans and
other minorities "have more free
dom than outsiders realize."
Opposition to change
There has, of course, been opposi
tion to these progressive changes in
Tibet. The March 1959 revolt in Lhasa
was led by traditional Tibetan elites,
who found their privileged position
threatened by the democratic re
forms — particularly the liberation of
the serfs — which were being gradu
ally introduced as provided in the
1951 Agreement. The Dalai Lama's
role in this uprising remains unclear.
From the letters he wrote to the Chief
Political Commissar of the Garrison
Command, one gets the impression
that he was forced to go along with
the rebels, and was compelled to join
them in exile in India. (See the New
York Times, April 25, 1959.)
Nonetheless, the fact remains that
this was a rebellion by traditional
elites against progressive change. If
Peking's suppression of this rebell
ion can be called a violation of

human rights, so can Abraham Lin
coln's suppression of the revolt of
slave-owning Southern elites during
the American Civil War.
Ulterior motives
The Tibetan issue has always been
used by people with ulterior mo
tives. In Sept. 1976, for example,
people attending a memorial meet
ing at Berkeley after the death of
Chairman Mao Tse-tung were given
leaflets with the headline, "Chinese,
get out of Tibet!" It puzzles me that
there has suddenly been so much
discussion of "violations of human
rights" in Tibet in the past several
weeks.
Aelion's effort to disclose and
condemn repression is highly com
mendable. It would be extremely un
fortunate, however, if the renewed
interest in human rights promoted
by President Jimmy Carter were used
to support the restoration of theoc
racy and serfdom in Tibet. It would
also be unfortunate if American mis
understanding of the status and in
ternal conditions of Tibet were, as in
the past, manipulated by those who
oppose the normalization of rela
tions between the United States and
China.
