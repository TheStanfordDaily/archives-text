Jokes hurting
I was very pleased to see the Daily reinstate the "Jokes
For Pizza" idea earlier this quarter. It has the potential to
be a humorous addition to the paper, however the jokes
so far have really been hurting. The one that was the last
straw, the straw that broke the camel's back (to use some
cliches as old and worn out as the jokes that appear in
your column) was the second joke published in the issue
of Monday, Feb. 13, with the "smallcox" punchline.
This joke recently appeared in the February publica
tion of Playboy. It seems to me that pizzas should not be
given out for simply paraphrasing a Playboy joke. You
would never find a Daily joke paraphrased in Playboy.
I trust that there must be some people on the Daily
staff who can differentiate between new, fresh jokes and
old, shitty jokes. It would be a big relief to many of your

readers if these people could do a better job of screen
ing out those jokes not deserving of a pizza.
If there is no joke left after this screening process,
then don't award a pizza, and for God's sake don't print
the joke in the Daily. A pizza is a valuable commodity
(especially as made by La Pizzeria) and should not be
served gratuitously to someone with the originality of an
iguana.

(Ed's note: According to our classified advertising
manager, who is in charge of selecting the prize-winning
jokes, the response to the Jokes for Pizza contest has
been phenomenal. And uniformly filthy. If decent (I
mean that both ways) entries can't be found, the contest
will die a swift death. Sorry about that, Hef.)
