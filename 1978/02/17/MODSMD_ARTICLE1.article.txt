# Albers relief construction to begin this quarter
## 
### Jack Vaughn 
Sometimes it's tougher to receive
than to give.
That's a lesson Stanford adminis
trators and faculty may take from the
six-year effort to bring a sculpture by
world-renowned artist Josef Albers
to campus.
The design for the art work, an
8-foot-8-inch tall, 55-foot long two
sided relief popularly known as "Al
bers' Wall," was donated to the Uni
versity by Albers in 1971.
After six years of reworking the de
sign, deciding on a location and try
ing to raise the money from outside
the University to build the relief,
construction should begin late this
quarter, according to Assoc. Provost
Edward Shaw.
The work will be placed on the
grass hexagon on Lomita Mall bet
ween the Physics Lecture Hall and
the Outer Quad, Shaw said in a letter
to Physics Department Chairman
Prof. Dirk Walecka advising him of
the final decision on the sculpture.
Shaw places the final cost estimate
for the project at about $100,000.
"We've received donations almost
up<o that level," he said, with more
than half of the money coming from a
foundation Albers created before his
death in 1976.
The side of the sculpture facing the
Quad will be black granite with
high-polish steel tubing in geometric
designs, Shaw said. The side facing

the Physics Lecture Hall will be white
brick with a pattern of horizontal
black chrome lines.
The theory behind the sculpture's
orientation, Shaw said, is that "as the
sun moves east to west, it plays
against the patterns in a quasi
dynamic fashion, so that the viewer's
perception of the sculpture changes
through the day."
Art History Prof. Albert Elsen, the
principal faculty sponsor and fund
raiser for the project, said the
sculpture "is in the best tradition of
the best in modern art: it defies sim
ple categorization.
"It is a work that, when experi
enced by people walking toward it or
around it, will disclose differing as
pects. ... It brings together ideas
from painting, graphic art, sculpture
and architecture."
Following the 1971 donation, "Al
bers worked on the design until 1975
and made a number of changes,"
Elsen said. When the design was
finished, the process of selecting a
site began.
"The original location near the Art
Museum proved to be inapprop
riate," Elsen said. "The conditions of
the gift required a location that was
prominent, dignified and safe, and
there must have been adequate
space around the sculpture for view
ing from a distance."
After rejecting the first location,
Elsen and other supporters consi

dered placing the wall on the new
Law School's Canfield Court. A full
scale mockup of the work was
erected there in late 1975, but almost
immediately a number of law stu
dents and faculty objected to the
site, passing out petitions opposing
the location and writing letters to the
Daily.
Despite a recommendation from
its Subcommittee on Outdoor Art
that the sculpture be built on the
court, the University Committee on
Land and Building Development and
President Richard Lyman turned
down the Law School site in january
1976.
The subcommittee then turned to
the Lomita Mall location, which the
committee approved in spring 1976.
Administrators including Lyman
OK'd the location and by May 1977
Shaw was ready to solicit construc
tion bids.
It wasn't to be that simple, how
ever. By mid-May, more than 200
Physics Department students, faculty
and staff had signed petitions pro
testing the Lomita Mall site, claiming
the sculpture "may well resemble a
penitentiary-like, confining struc
ture." In addition, more than 350
personal letters objecting to the site
were sent to Lyman.
One letter writer said the protest
was based mainly on the location
rather than the sculpture. "I would

space — even the Mona Lisa!"
Shaw and Subcommittee Chair
man Assoc. Prof. Robert Mittelstadt
met with protesters, pointing out
that few petition signers had seen a
model of the sculpture. After display
ing one in the department, however,
objections continued and by June,
Shaw agreed to appoint a group of
outside art experts to review the site
before construction.
This move caught Elsen, who was
doing research in Paris, by surprise.
"It went through all the established
procedures," he said. "It had cleared
every procedural obstacle. I left to go
to Europe and, when I got back, the
sculpture was still held up." Elsen
said the delay caused costs to go up
and made working with donors dif
ficult.
Shaw selected a site committee,
including San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art Director Henry Hopkins,
Oakland Museum of Art Curator
George Neubert and San Francisco
landscape architect Aaron Greene,
over the summer. The group met in
October, and, Shaw said, was
"unanimous in its recommendation
for Lomita Mall."
Even this approval did not spell the
end of the art work's problems,
however. Before and after the site
committee's deliberations, Shaw
worked through the University Plan
ning Office with architects and con
tractors on problems with finding
materials both appropriate for the

sculpture and within the project's
budget. At the same time, Elsen con
tinued to solicit donations for con
struction, which, partly because of
the delay, was going to cost more
than anticipated.
Finally, early in February, "we
learned that costs are within the
budgetary limits" and that the pro
ject could proceed, Shaw said. He
then wrote to Walecka saying he had
"uncovered no compelling reasons
why we should reconsider" the orig
inal Lomita Mall decision. "Quite the
contrary," he said, "the professional
advice we have strongly supports the
initial decision to place the Albers
Sculpture on the Lomita Mall.
"If there is one thing I have learned
in the last few months it is that out
door art seldom is sited without con
troversy and ought not to be subject
to referendum."
Elsen reached a similar conclusion
in a letter published in the Daily last
spring. "Seriousart," hewrote, "was
never created or put in public places
as the result of popuiar consensus. It
has been characteristic of the best in
modern art that when first shown it
has disappointed the expectations of
the public.
"At a university, students should
expect to be exposed to what they do
not know or like — they are entitled
to learn about different ways of se
eing the world, different forms of
knowledge and how it is ac
quired. . . . We bring the Albers
sculpture as a tribute to how the
human spirit maybe manifest inart."

riate," Elsen said. "The conditions of
the gift required a location that was
prominent, dignified and safe, and
there must have been adequate
space around the sculpture for view
ing from a distance."
After rejecting the first location,
Elsen and other supporters consi

dered placing the wall on the new
Law School's Canfield Court. A full
scale mockup of the work was
erected there in late 1975, but almost
immediately a number of law stu
dents and faculty objected to the
site, passing out petitions opposing
the location and writing letters to the
Daily.
Despite a recommendation from
its Subcommittee on Outdoor Art
that the sculpture be built on the
court, the University Committee on
Land and Building Development and
President Richard Lyman turned
down the Law School site in january
1976.
The subcommittee then turned to

committee approved in spring 1976.

It wasn't to be that simple, how

Physics Department students, faculty
and staff had signed petitions pro
testing the Lomita Mall site, claiming
the sculpture "may well resemble a
penitentiary-like, confining struc
ture." In addition, more than 350
personal letters objecting to the site
were sent to Lyman.
One letter writer said the protest
was based mainly on the location
rather than the sculpture. "I would

met with protesters, pointing out
that few petition signers had seen a
model of the sculpture. After display
ing one in the department, however,
objections continued and by June,
Shaw agreed to appoint a group of
outside art experts to review the site
before construction.
This move caught Elsen, who was
doing research in Paris, by surprise.
"It went through all the established
procedures," he said. "It had cleared
every procedural obstacle. I left to go
to Europe and, when I got back, the
sculpture was still held up." Elsen
said the delay caused costs to go up
and made working with donors dif
ficult.
Shaw selected a site committee,
including San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art Director Henry Hopkins,
Oakland Museum of Art Curator
George Neubert and San Francisco
landscape architect Aaron Greene,
over the summer. The group met in
October, and, Shaw said, was
"unanimous in its recommendation
for Lomita Mall."
Even this approval did not spell the
end of the art work's problems,
however. Before and after the site
committee's deliberations, Shaw
worked through the University Plan
ning Office with architects and con
tractors on problems with finding
materials both appropriate for the

sculpture and within the project's
budget. At the same time, Elsen con
tinued to solicit donations for con
struction, which, partly because of
the delay, was going to cost more
than anticipated.
Finally, early in February, "we
learned that costs are within the
budgetary limits" and that the pro
ject could proceed, Shaw said. He
then wrote to Walecka saying he had
"uncovered no compelling reasons
why we should reconsider" the orig
inal Lomita Mall decision. "Quite the
contrary," he said, "the professional
advice we have strongly supports the
initial decision to place the Albers
Sculpture on the Lomita Mall.
"If there is one thing I have learned
in the last few months it is that out
door art seldom is sited without con
troversy and ought not to be subject
to referendum."
Elsen reached a similar conclusion
in a letter published in the Daily last
spring. "Seriousart," hewrote, "was
never created or put in public places
as the result of popuiar consensus. It
has been characteristic of the best in
modern art that when first shown it
has disappointed the expectations of
the public.
"At a university, students should
expect to be exposed to what they do
not know or like — they are entitled
to learn about different ways of se
eing the world, different forms of
knowledge and how it is ac
quired. . . . We bring the Albers
sculpture as a tribute to how the
human spirit maybe manifest inart."
Sometimes it's tougher to receive
than to give.
That's a lesson Stanford adminis
trators and faculty may take from the
six-year effort to bring a sculpture by
world-renowned artist Josef Albers
to campus.
The design for the art work, an
8-foot-8-inch tall, 55-foot long two
sided relief popularly known as "Al
bers' Wall," was donated to the Uni
versity by Albers in 1971.
After six years of reworking the de
sign, deciding on a location and try
ing to raise the money from outside
the University to build the relief,
construction should begin late this
quarter, according to Assoc. Provost
Edward Shaw.
The work will be placed on the
grass hexagon on Lomita Mall bet
ween the Physics Lecture Hall and
the Outer Quad, Shaw said in a letter
to Physics Department Chairman
Prof. Dirk Walecka advising him of
the final decision on the sculpture.
Shaw places the final cost estimate
for the project at about $100,000.
"We've received donations almost
up<o that level," he said, with more
than half of the money coming from a
foundation Albers created before his
death in 1976.
The side of the sculpture facing the
Quad will be black granite with
high-polish steel tubing in geometric
designs, Shaw said. The side facing

the Physics Lecture Hall will be white
brick with a pattern of horizontal
black chrome lines.
The theory behind the sculpture's
orientation, Shaw said, is that "as the
sun moves east to west, it plays
against the patterns in a quasi
dynamic fashion, so that the viewer's
perception of the sculpture changes
through the day."
Art History Prof. Albert Elsen, the
principal faculty sponsor and fund
raiser for the project, said the
sculpture "is in the best tradition of
the best in modern art: it defies sim
ple categorization.
"It is a work that, when experi
enced by people walking toward it or
around it, will disclose differing as
pects. ... It brings together ideas
from painting, graphic art, sculpture
and architecture."
Following the 1971 donation, "Al
bers worked on the design until 1975
and made a number of changes,"
Elsen said. When the design was
finished, the process of selecting a
site began.
"The original location near the Art

before construction.
This move caught Elsen, who was
doing research in Paris, by surprise.
"It went through all the established
procedures," he said. "It had cleared
every procedural obstacle. I left to go
to Europe and, when I got back, the
sculpture was still held up." Elsen
said the delay caused costs to go up
and made working with donors dif
ficult.
Shaw selected a site committee,
including San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art Director Henry Hopkins,
Oakland Museum of Art Curator
George Neubert and San Francisco
landscape architect Aaron Greene,
over the summer. The group met in
October, and, Shaw said, was
"unanimous in its recommendation
for Lomita Mall."
Even this approval did not spell the
end of the art work's problems,
however. Before and after the site
committee's deliberations, Shaw
worked through the University Plan
ning Office with architects and con
tractors on problems with finding
materials both appropriate for the

sculpture and within the project's
budget. At the same time, Elsen con
tinued to solicit donations for con
struction, which, partly because of
the delay, was going to cost more
than anticipated.
Finally, early in February, "we
learned that costs are within the
budgetary limits" and that the pro
ject could proceed, Shaw said. He
then wrote to Walecka saying he had
"uncovered no compelling reasons
why we should reconsider" the orig
inal Lomita Mall decision. "Quite the
contrary," he said, "the professional
advice we have strongly supports the
initial decision to place the Albers
Sculpture on the Lomita Mall.
"If there is one thing I have learned
in the last few months it is that out
door art seldom is sited without con
troversy and ought not to be subject
to referendum."
Elsen reached a similar conclusion
in a letter published in the Daily last
spring. "Seriousart," hewrote, "was
never created or put in public places
as the result of popuiar consensus. It
has been characteristic of the best in
modern art that when first shown it
has disappointed the expectations of
the public.
"At a university, students should
expect to be exposed to what they do
not know or like — they are entitled
to learn about different ways of se
eing the world, different forms of
knowledge and how it is ac
quired. . . . We bring the Albers
sculpture as a tribute to how the
human spirit maybe manifest inart."
Sometimes it's tougher to receive
than to give.
That's a lesson Stanford adminis
trators and faculty may take from the
six-year effort to bring a sculpture by
world-renowned artist Josef Albers
to campus.
The design for the art work, an
8-foot-8-inch tall, 55-foot long two
sided relief popularly known as "Al
bers' Wall," was donated to the Uni
versity by Albers in 1971.
After six years of reworking the de
sign, deciding on a location and try
ing to raise the money from outside
the University to build the relief,
construction should begin late this
quarter, according to Assoc. Provost
Edward Shaw.
The work will be placed on the
grass hexagon on Lomita Mall bet
ween the Physics Lecture Hall and
the Outer Quad, Shaw said in a letter
to Physics Department Chairman
Prof. Dirk Walecka advising him of
the final decision on the sculpture.
Shaw places the final cost estimate
for the project at about $100,000.
"We've received donations almost
up<o that level," he said, with more
than half of the money coming from a
foundation Albers created before his
death in 1976.
The side of the sculpture facing the
Quad will be black granite with
high-polish steel tubing in geometric
designs, Shaw said. The side facing

the Physics Lecture Hall will be white
brick with a pattern of horizontal
black chrome lines.
The theory behind the sculpture's
orientation, Shaw said, is that "as the
sun moves east to west, it plays
against the patterns in a quasi
dynamic fashion, so that the viewer's
perception of the sculpture changes
through the day."
Art History Prof. Albert Elsen, the
principal faculty sponsor and fund
raiser for the project, said the
sculpture "is in the best tradition of
the best in modern art: it defies sim
ple categorization.
"It is a work that, when experi
enced by people walking toward it or
around it, will disclose differing as
pects. ... It brings together ideas
from painting, graphic art, sculpture
and architecture."
Following the 1971 donation, "Al
bers worked on the design until 1975
and made a number of changes,"
Elsen said. When the design was
finished, the process of selecting a
site began.
"The original location near the Art
Museum proved to be inapprop
riate," Elsen said. "The conditions of
the gift required a location that was
prominent, dignified and safe, and
there must have been adequate
space around the sculpture for view
ing from a distance."
After rejecting the first location,
Elsen and other supporters consi

dered placing the wall on the new
Law School's Canfield Court. A full
scale mockup of the work was
erected there in late 1975, but almost
immediately a number of law stu
dents and faculty objected to the
site, passing out petitions opposing
the location and writing letters to the
Daily.
Despite a recommendation from
its Subcommittee on Outdoor Art
that the sculpture be built on the
court, the University Committee on
Land and Building Development and
President Richard Lyman turned
down the Law School site in january
1976.
The subcommittee then turned to
the Lomita Mall location, which the
committee approved in spring 1976.

It wasn't to be that simple, how
ever. By mid-May, more than 200
Physics Department students, faculty
and staff had signed petitions pro
testing the Lomita Mall site, claiming
the sculpture "may well resemble a
penitentiary-like, confining struc
ture." In addition, more than 350
personal letters objecting to the site
were sent to Lyman.
One letter writer said the protest
was based mainly on the location
rather than the sculpture. "I would
