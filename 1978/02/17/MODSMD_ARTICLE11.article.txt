# Carter aide discusses illegal aliens
## 
### Mark Sonders 
)oseph Aragon, one of Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's eight spe
cial assistants, spoke Tuesday
night on selection issues of
domestic policy, ranging from
Carter's Economic Stimulus
Program and aid for the poor to
specific concerns of the
Hispanic-American commun
ity.
As the first speaker of the
Stanford Chicano Law Stu
dents Association's public
forum, Aragon focused on the
impact of Carter's policies on
Chicanos.
He also discussed the Carter
administration's economic and
political commitment to the
Hispanic community.
Aragon cited the Equal
Employment Opportunity
Committee, whose purpose is
to provide jobs for undere
mployed minorities, especially
Chicanos.
Aragon emphasized Carter's
political commitment, saying
no other president has put as
many representatives of un
derrepresented groups in
"serious administrative posi
tions." He said that Carter has
made 90 such "major appoint
ments."
The special assistant also
talked about his relation as ad

viser to the president and
likened it to a wheel, with Ara
gon being a spoke and Carter
the hub. This system, com
pared to those of the two pre
vious administrations, is much
more "open," and less hierar
chical, he added. Aragon said
Carter's system encourages
input from sources such as
minority groups that might
otherwise be neglected.
Aragon said he also informs
the public on issues and
policies, such as the upcoming
Panama Canal Treaty. He said
efforts by himself and others
have reduced the number of
Americans opposing the treaty

from 82 to 45 per cent.
Aragon said he feels building
a strong consensus for the tre
aty will be a vote of confidence
that will improve the negotiat
ing position of the United
States in situations such as the
SALT 111 talks.
Aragon said he also has
spent a lot of energy in educat
ing various groups on "un
documented aliens."
The problem involves four to
11 million illegal aliens, the
majority of whom are Mexi
cans, who are working for less
than minimum wage. Not only
are these undocumented
workers economically and so

daily exploited, but they take
the jobs of American citizens,
especially of those in craft and
labor unions, Aragon said. This
is because employers prefer to
hire them because they wil
lingly work for less than union
wages, he added.
The Carter administration's
compromise solution will
come before Congress some
time later this year. Aragon told
the Daily the solution does not
provide amnesty for all un
documented workers, but will
"readjust the status" of those
workers who lived in the Un
ited States before jan. 1,1977.
