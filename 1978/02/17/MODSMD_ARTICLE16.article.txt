# Chicano grads seek stronger voice

Bliss Carnochan, dean of graduate
studies, met with minority members re
cently to discuss the possibility of hiring
another Chicano assistant to the dean in
the graduate division. Current assistant
Ron Arroyo will leave the position no later
than August.
Carnochan met with members of the
Chicano Graduate Students Association
(CCSA) Feb. 9 to discuss the dean issue,
and affirmative action in general, with
members of black, Asian American and na
tive American communities here.
Carnochan outlined the University's
position concerning a Chicano assistant
dean.
Carnochan said sufficient functions do
not exist to warrant two assistant deans in
the Graduate Division.
He added that not enough reason exists
to hire a Chicano on a full-time basis to
serve Chicano needs. University policy is
to stress internal promotion, which would
make a Chicano substitute impossible, he
said.
Chicano students said the assistant dean
position is very important to Chicanos be

cause it was the highest position held by a
Chicano at the graduate division. They
added that until last March, Arroyo's role
in recruiting Chicano graduate students
was a vital one.
In March a new graduate division policy
announced the end of student recruit
ment. Arroyo's recruitment efforts
ceased.
Last May, a report issued by Car
nochan's office, termed as a decentraliza
tion affirmative action plan, said each indi
vidual school was to adopt and implement
its own affirmative action program.
Nick Valenzuela, a CGSA member, said
Arroyo's position had at least allowed
someone at the graduate division level to
help in identification of minority student
applicants as well as act as a resource per
son for other information regarding sup
portive programs and financial aids.
He said , "This whole issue has to do with
the decentralization effort by the Univer
sity to shift the burden of responsibility
and commitment of minority recruit
ment."
Valenzuela also said since the May re
port was issued by Carnochan, informa

tion obtained from the Graduate Studies
Office reveals that of 39 departments on
campus, only 17 had an affirmative action
officer and none had a written affirmative
action plan.
He said many departments compalined
about the lack of communication between
the graduate division and themselves and
saw this plan as an additional chore. This
problem is compounded by the fact that
the Graduate Studies Office does not
make provisions for the resources neces
sary in recruitment efforts.
Carnochan also suggested that Stan
ford's graduate schools work with a na
tional consortium of undergraduate uni
versities to obtain names of potential
minority student graduate school applic
ants here.
The problem with Ihis, according to the
CGSA, is that many of the schools in the
consortium are Eastern schools which do
not have many Chicanos. Thus only a few
names would be produced by the group.
Carnochan made a verbal commitment
to hire a Chicano at a lower position in the
graduate division.
