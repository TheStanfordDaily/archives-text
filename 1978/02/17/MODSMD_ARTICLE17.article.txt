### Bert Bower News analysis 
A crippling three week general strike, esca
lated guerrilla attacks and waves of mass pro
tests in Nicaragua, have seriously eroded the
government of Gen. Anastasio Somoza Debayle
in the last month.
After 41 years of dictatorial control by the
Somoza family, a broad base opposition, includ
ing such divergent groups as left wing guerrilla
leaders and moderate businessmen, have com
bined to attempt to overthrow the Somoza re
gime recently.
"A prolonged war has been fought against
Somoza but the time is now or never to bring the
struggle to an end," said Roberto Vargas, a co
ordinator of Nonintervention in Nicaragua
(NIN).
NIN is a San Francisco-based organization at
tempting to organize Nicaraguans, one of the
city's largest Spanish speaking groups, against
United States intervention in Nicaragua sup
porting the ailing Somoza government.
Pressure U.S.
"We are trying to pressure the U.S. Congress
to stop using taxpayers money for military aid
and foreign loans which prop up the Somoza
dictatorship," Vargas said.
NINs most dramatic action was the takeover
of the Nicaraguan consulate in San Francisco by
several protestors, on Feb. 3. The takeover
ended peacefully when protestors marched out
of the consulate carrying bags of blood and
chanting anti-Somoza slogans, according to the
San Francisco Chronicle.
The following day over 1200 protestors rallied
at Sandino Plaza in the city's Mission District to
support NiNs two principle aims: the overthrow
of the Somoza government and the imposition
of a transitional democratic government, Vargas
said.
The protestors represented a large cross
section of the city's Nicaraguan population, in
cluding old and young people of all "political
and economic tendencies," according to Var
gas.
In many ways, this parallels the formation in
Nicaragua of a coalition of businessmen, con
servative politicians, progressive priests and

disenchanted middle-class citizens which sup
port the revolutionary guerrilla Frente San
dinista de Liberacion Nacional (FSLN).
Named derived
The FSLN derives its name from Augusio
Cesar Sandino, who began a guerrilla move
ment in 1927 to oppose the intervention of the
United States when this country tried to force a
peace on the warring Nicaraguan Conservative
and Liberal parties. Sandino was a nationalist
and anti-imperialist whose aim was self deter
mination for his country.
U.S. Marines occupied Nicaragua from 1927
to 1933 when the United States placed Anastasio
Somoza Garcia in power, as the head of the
military police force, the Guardia Nacional
(GN). Somoza pledged to bring peace to the
country, "even if I have to shoot every other
man in Nicaragua to get it." Somoza had San
dino assassinated in 1934.
In 1936 Somoza staged a military coup and
assumed the presidency until he was assassi
nated in 1956. Somoza's son Luis then ruled until
1963 when he put Rene Schick in power as a
puppet president until 1967. Somoza's other
son, Anastasio Jr., then became president and is
still in power today.
41 years
During the 41 years the Somozas have been in
power they have amassed enough wealth to be
come one of the richest families in the Western
Hemisphere. It is estimated the Somozas own at
least one-fifth of Nicaragua's arable land and
control most of the country's major private
companies.
Since the time the United States intervened
directly to put Anastasio Somoza in power in
1933 until the present, the United States has
supported Somoza governments witheconomic
assistance loans, military aid and even direct
intervention by the U.S. Marines in 1956 and
1960 during transitions in the government to
ensure the Somozas remained in power.
The United States support continues despite
Amnesty International reports of widespread
torture and imprisonment of the Nicaraguan
populace.

A crippling three week general strike, esca
lated guerrilla attacks and waves of mass pro
tests in Nicaragua, have seriously eroded the
government of Gen. Anastasio Somoza Debayle
in the last month.
After 41 years of dictatorial control by the
Somoza family, a broad base opposition, includ
ing such divergent groups as left wing guerrilla
leaders and moderate businessmen, have com
bined to attempt to overthrow the Somoza re
gime recently.
"A prolonged war has been fought against
Somoza but the time is now or never to bring the
struggle to an end," said Roberto Vargas, a co
ordinator of Nonintervention in Nicaragua
(NIN).
NIN is a San Francisco-based organization at
tempting to organize Nicaraguans, one of the
city's largest Spanish speaking groups, against
United States intervention in Nicaragua sup
porting the ailing Somoza government.
Pressure U.S.
"We are trying to pressure the U.S. Congress
to stop using taxpayers money for military aid
and foreign loans which prop up the Somoza
dictatorship," Vargas said.
NINs most dramatic action was the takeover
of the Nicaraguan consulate in San Francisco by
several protestors, on Feb. 3. The takeover
ended peacefully when protestors marched out
of the consulate carrying bags of blood and
chanting anti-Somoza slogans, according to the
San Francisco Chronicle.
The following day over 1200 protestors rallied
at Sandino Plaza in the city's Mission District to
support NiNs two principle aims: the overthrow
of the Somoza government and the imposition
of a transitional democratic government, Vargas
said.
The protestors represented a large cross
section of the city's Nicaraguan population, in
cluding old and young people of all "political
and economic tendencies," according to Var
gas.
In many ways, this parallels the formation in
Nicaragua of a coalition of businessmen, con
servative politicians, progressive priests and

disenchanted middle-class citizens which sup
port the revolutionary guerrilla Frente San
dinista de Liberacion Nacional (FSLN).
Named derived
The FSLN derives its name from Augusio
Cesar Sandino, who began a guerrilla move
ment in 1927 to oppose the intervention of the
United States when this country tried to force a
peace on the warring Nicaraguan Conservative
and Liberal parties. Sandino was a nationalist
and anti-imperialist whose aim was self deter
mination for his country.
U.S. Marines occupied Nicaragua from 1927
to 1933 when the United States placed Anastasio
Somoza Garcia in power, as the head of the
military police force, the Guardia Nacional
(GN). Somoza pledged to bring peace to the
country, "even if I have to shoot every other
man in Nicaragua to get it." Somoza had San
dino assassinated in 1934.
In 1936 Somoza staged a military coup and
assumed the presidency until he was assassi
nated in 1956. Somoza's son Luis then ruled until
1963 when he put Rene Schick in power as a
puppet president until 1967. Somoza's other
son, Anastasio Jr., then became president and is
still in power today.
41 years
During the 41 years the Somozas have been in
power they have amassed enough wealth to be
come one of the richest families in the Western
Hemisphere. It is estimated the Somozas own at
least one-fifth of Nicaragua's arable land and
control most of the country's major private
companies.
Since the time the United States intervened
directly to put Anastasio Somoza in power in
1933 until the present, the United States has
