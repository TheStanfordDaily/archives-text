## film /lex passaris On Mr. Brooks' exercise in HIGH ANXIETY 
### 
Orson Welles once said that
Hollywood was the biggest toy
train set any boy ever had.
Well, little Mel Brooks must be
the train's new engineer^
In "High Anxiety," his latest
film, Brooks salutes the
cinematic genius of Alfred
Hitchcock.
Brooks borrows liberally
from such Hitchcock greats as
"Psycho," "The Birds" and
"North by Northwest," making
parodies of key scenes from
these films. Inaddition the plot
is loosely taken from "Vertigo"
and "Spellbound."
As Dr. Richard Thorndyke,
newly appointed director of

"The Psycho-Neurotic Institute
for the Very, Very Nervous,"
Brooks must contend with the
institute's crooked shrinks
(Harvey Korman and Cloris
Leachman) who manage to
keep their patients conve
niently sick and themselves
comfortably wealthy; clear
himself of a murder for which
he is being framed; entertain
Victoria Brisbane (Madeline
Kahn), the slightly kinky
daughter of a rich institute pa
tient whom she is trying to re
scue; and conquer his over
whelming fearof heights. Long
winded? No, just a typical
Hitchcock plot.

This plot does capture one of
the basic Hitchcock premises,
the innocent man thrust into a
perilous situation which he is
unable to understand. Matters
are further complicated when
he is being chased both by the
miscreants and by the police.
Film-parodies seem to be
what Brooks works with best.
He has already zapped the hor
ror film genre in "Young Fran
kenstein," the movie-making
industry in "Silent Movie" and
shoot-'em-up Westerns in
"Blazing Saddles."
Through each of his past
films, Brooks has sharpened
and refined his directorial
techniques. Said Brooks, "If
you're going to mimic a Hitch
cock film, you'd better know
what you are doing." In "High
Anxiety," Brooks de
monstrates his technical
achievements.
Most effective of the Hitch
cock scene spoofs is taken
from the shower stabbing
scene in "Psycho." Brooks has
captured this sequence almost
frame by frame except that
here it is a mad bellhop who
assails his victim, Thorndyke,
with a wet newspaper; and as
the body slumps to the bottom
of the tub, rather than blood,
the audience sees black ink
running down the drain.
Duties
Although Brooks holds
duties as producer, director,
co-writer, song-composer,
and star on this film, he says,"I
am basically a writer who has
backed myself into all these
positions defending my vision,
defending my script ... I
didn't want anyone (else) to di
rect my script because I didn't
think they'd understand
it ... .
"I became an actor when I
lost Gene Wilder. 'Silent
Movie' called for a kind of

has-been silent movie director
who is going to make another
silent movie and I couldn't
think of a better has-been than
myself ....
"So I did it and I liked it and I
saved a lot of money on an ac
tor. I had a big fight with myself
over 'High Anxiety.' I wanted
more money because I was so
good in 'Silent Movie.' For days
I wouldn't talk to myself."
Difficulties
Still, Brooks the actor is by
far the least polished thespian
in the cast. He is for the most
part believeable as the inno
cent, but has difficuly in hold
ing his character when deliver
ing straight gag lines. In the
opening sequence Thorndyke
is seen going through the Los
Angeles International Airport
terminal, as the tense opening
music is being played, but it is
definitely Brooks who pauses
and having heard the opening
music along with the audience
says Mv, what a dramatic air
port.
korman and especially
Leachman turn in delightfully
treacherous performances as
the heavies. Kahn does well as
the blonde romantic interest
who seems to pop up in many
of Hitchcock's films, but she
deserved perhaps a little more
time in this one. Also of note
are Ron Carey as Brooks'
"Chauffeur and sidekick" and
Charlie Callas as a patient who
thinks he is a cocker spaniel.
Although some of the scenes
tend to be disjointed and the
humor at times a little heavy
handed, Brooks has managed
to match the master of sus
pense, Hitchcock, with a
genius all his own.

Leachman turn in delightfully
treacherous performances as

the blonde romantic interest
who seems to pop up in many
of Hitchcock's films, but she
deserved perhaps a little more
time in this one. Also of note

"Chauffeur and sidekick" and
Charlie Callas as a patient who

Although some of the scenes
tend to be disjointed and the
humor at times a little heavy

to match the master of sus

Orson Welles once said that
Hollywood was the biggest toy
train set any boy ever had.
Well, little Mel Brooks must be
the train's new engineer^
In "High Anxiety," his latest
film, Brooks salutes the
cinematic genius of Alfred
Hitchcock.
Brooks borrows liberally
from such Hitchcock greats as
"Psycho," "The Birds" and
"North by Northwest," making
parodies of key scenes from
these films. Inaddition the plot
is loosely taken from "Vertigo"
and "Spellbound."
As Dr. Richard Thorndyke,
newly appointed director of

"The Psycho-Neurotic Institute
for the Very, Very Nervous,"
Brooks must contend with the
institute's crooked shrinks
(Harvey Korman and Cloris
Leachman) who manage to
keep their patients conve
niently sick and themselves
comfortably wealthy; clear
himself of a murder for which
he is being framed; entertain
Victoria Brisbane (Madeline
Kahn), the slightly kinky
daughter of a rich institute pa
tient whom she is trying to re
scue; and conquer his over
whelming fearof heights. Long
winded? No, just a typical
Hitchcock plot.

This plot does capture one of
the basic Hitchcock premises,
the innocent man thrust into a
perilous situation which he is
unable to understand. Matters
are further complicated when
he is being chased both by the
miscreants and by the police.
Film-parodies seem to be
what Brooks works with best.
He has already zapped the hor
ror film genre in "Young Fran
kenstein," the movie-making
industry in "Silent Movie" and
shoot-'em-up Westerns in
"Blazing Saddles."
Through each of his past
films, Brooks has sharpened
and refined his directorial
techniques. Said Brooks, "If
you're going to mimic a Hitch
cock film, you'd better know
what you are doing." In "High
Anxiety," Brooks de
monstrates his technical
achievements.
Most effective of the Hitch
cock scene spoofs is taken
from the shower stabbing
scene in "Psycho." Brooks has
captured this sequence almost
frame by frame except that
here it is a mad bellhop who
assails his victim, Thorndyke,
with a wet newspaper; and as
the body slumps to the bottom
of the tub, rather than blood,
the audience sees black ink
running down the drain.
Duties
Although Brooks holds
duties as producer, director,
co-writer, song-composer,
and star on this film, he says,"I
am basically a writer who has
backed myself into all these
positions defending my vision,
defending my script ... I
didn't want anyone (else) to di
rect my script because I didn't
think they'd understand
it ... .
"I became an actor when I
lost Gene Wilder. 'Silent
Movie' called for a kind of

has-been silent movie director
who is going to make another
silent movie and I couldn't
think of a better has-been than
myself ....
"So I did it and I liked it and I
saved a lot of money on an ac
tor. I had a big fight with myself
over 'High Anxiety.' I wanted
more money because I was so
good in 'Silent Movie.' For days
I wouldn't talk to myself."
Difficulties
Still, Brooks the actor is by
far the least polished thespian
in the cast. He is for the most
part believeable as the inno
cent, but has difficuly in hold
ing his character when deliver
ing straight gag lines. In the
opening sequence Thorndyke
is seen going through the Los
Angeles International Airport
terminal, as the tense opening
music is being played, but it is
definitely Brooks who pauses
and having heard the opening
music along with the audience
says Mv, what a dramatic air
port.
