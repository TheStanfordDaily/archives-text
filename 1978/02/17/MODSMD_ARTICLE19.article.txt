# Tips for the Europe-bound
## 
### Nancy Rivenburgh 
Did you know it's forbidden
to use the bathroom on a Euro
pean train while it's stopped?
This may be a trivial ques
tion, but when compounded
with a multitude of others, you
can see there is more to travel
ing abroad than taking sturdy
shoes and a phrase book.
A group of students who
have lived and traveled over
seas offers this list of sugges
tions for those about to ven
ture into the life of backpacks,
trains and bottled water.

First and foremost, carry as
little as possible; clothes are
the least important contents in
a backpack. A number of other
items, however, prove useful
to many travelers.
"My swiss army knife was es
sential," said former Tours re
sident Al Coar, "and make sure
it has a bottle opener."
Flashlight
Other suggestions included
a mini-flashlight, a voltage
converter with proper socket
adapter, a soft-ticking alarm
clock, a rain poncho, a roll of

toilet paper (handy for a variety
of reasons), and "plenty of
room for all the things you
gather on the way," Coar said.
Your passport, railpass and
traveler's checks should be
kept with you at all times as
conveniently as possible be
cause identification must be
shown periodically on trains
and when crossing borders.
Identification
It is a good idea to keep
another piece of identification
as well as check numbers sepa
rate for immediate replace
ment of your passport and
money if lost or stolen, said
Terry Elms, a Tours alumna.
Once you are packed and
ready, you must learn the
"Came of Trains," assuming
you travel in typical student
style. The rules are simple but
essential to comfortable train
travel.
Train schedules
First, become familiar with
reading train schedules.
"Learn the word for 'arrival'
and 'departure' in every lan
guage," said Laura Clark, who
attended Cliveden. After you
arrive somewhere "don't leave
the train station without first
checking the departure times
— it saves a lot of trouble."
Always check to see if reser
vations are necessary if you de
sire first class or a sleeping car.
Second class rarely requires
reservations.
Although it is difficult to tell
beforehand, certain trains will
be very crowded, so the earlier
you claim a seat the better. If
you are late for a full train you
can often find space in the re
staurant car or at the end of the
train.
Luggage racks
If all else fails, Coar
suggested the luggage racks.
"They're not bad," he said.
Once he crawled up into a lug
gage rack to find a place to lie
down on an overnight train
ride, he recalled with amuse
ment.
Before you board the train,
look at the sign posted on the
side of each car. European
trains have a nasty habit of
splitting up in the middle of the
night, and you might wake up
with surprise, as one student
did, to find yourself in Milan
instead of Munich.
Do not cut your train con
nections too close, Clark
warned. This is especially true
"in southern Europe where

trains can be up to three hours
late."
it is wise to carry food and
bottled water on the train.
Train restaurant prices are high
and bringing your own food al
leviates the hunger pangs
when the family across from
you inevitably unpacks a feast
from their basket.
Make a basic plan of explora
tion when you first arrive in a
new city or country.
/'Know something about
where you are — the special
ties and the sights," Elms said,
"and be realistic in your plans,
travel can be exhausting." She
added that the tourist centers,
in or next to train stations,
often provide maps and help
ful information.
Learn basic phrases for each
country, Elms said. "People are
much friendlier when you
make an effort at their lan
guage." After a few minutes of
practice on the train you can
easily master "Thank you,"
"please," "where is" and "how
much" in any language.
If you are visiting a city only
for the day, it is cheap and easy
to check any luggage in at the
train station. If you are staying
overnight, you will find the
hotel of your price range with a
little patience.
Accommodations
"Just don't panic," Clark
said. "Everyone sleeps in a
train station at least once."
To avoid train station
benches, however, try not to
arrive in a city too late at night.
Be sure to arrange for accom
modations early if you will be
there during a holiday such as
the Oktoberfest in Munich or
Mardi Gras in southern France.
Countries, and even cities,
set their own opening and clos
ing hours. It is worth knowing
those times before exploring a
city to avoid excessive waiting
or hunger.
You should gain familiarity
with the currency of each
country before you enter.
Banks generally give the best
exchange rates, but they are
not as easy to find as change
windows. Be sure to change
your money before the
weekend, and when using the
currency "always count your
change," Elms said.
Perhaps the best advice for
the potential traveler is to carry
your sense of humor
everywhere you go and use it
as often as possible.
