# Four exiled Chileans criticize the junta
## 
### Bert Bower 
A four member delegation of
exiled Chilean scholars discussed
academic censorship and political
repression which exists in Chile to
day, under General Augusto
Pinochet's military junta.
An audience of about 100 attended
the discussion in Kresge Auditorium
yesterday.
"The military wants to transform
the universities into institutions that
fit their plans," said Dr. Enrique Kir
berg, former president of the State
Technical University of Chile and
currently a senior research associate
at the Institute for Latin American
Studies at Columbia University.
"Pinochet has ordered every book
dealing with social or political sci
ence to be burned. In addition,
10,000 students and 30 per cent of the
faculties have been expelled," Kir
berg said.
Month-long tour
Kirberg is one of four Chileans
who recently began a month-long
tour of the United States in an at
tempt to draw attention to what he
calls the political and academic rep
ression which has existed in Chile
since the overthrow of the Salvador
Allende government in September
1973.
During the Allende government of
1970 to 1973, university students
were actively involved in the trans
formation of Chilean society, accord
ing to Claudio Grossman, former
student leader of the Unidad Popular
and currently a lecturer in Interna
tional Law at the University of Ut
recht, Holland.
But "the fascist coup in 1973 ended

the democratic process in the uni
versity and abolished all the reforms
we had achieved," Grossman said.
"Pinochet has put the university at
the service of a privileged minority
and expects students to study to be
come technocrats that don't ques
tion the military dictatorship," he
said.
Education under control
The entire educational system of
the country (primary, secondary and
university) has come under military
control according to a report issued
by the United Nations Commission
on Human Rights. All university re
ctors are members of the military and
all course curricula that rnight ques
tion junta rule have been eliminated.
"Today the Chilean university re
flects the ideology of Pinochet's
tyranny which is nothing but an
ideology of military fascism," said
Dr. Eugenio Velasco, former dean of
faculty of law at the University of
Chile and presently a visiting profes
sor in the Latin American Studies
Department at UCLA.
Velasco said the military has re
written the history of Chile to include
a new "heroic chapter" in which
elementary and high school students
are taught to regard the military coup
as the second independence of
Chile.
When Velasco was being held as a
political prisonerfollowing the coup,
he said his nine-year-old daughter
was required to learn the anthems of
the Chilean national police, navy,
army and air force.
Flores speaks
The fourth panelist, Dr. Fernando
Flores, former minister of economics

and secretary general of the Allende
government, who currently teaches
a course on Chilean politics at Stan
ford, emphasized the role of U.S.
universities which support the
Pinochet regime.
Flores used economist Milton
Friedman, as an example of U.S.
academic support of the Pinochet

regime.
However, Kirberg said, many U.S.
students and faculty members have
expressed strong solidarity with the
resistance movement in Chile.
"This solidarity is important be
cause when the government feels
pressure they don't dare continue to
repress our people," Velasco added.

day, under General Augusto
Pinochet's military junta.
An audience of about 100 attended
the discussion in Kresge Auditorium
yesterday.
"The military wants to transform
the universities into institutions that
fit their plans," said Dr. Enrique Kir
berg, former president of the State
Technical University of Chile and
currently a senior research associate
at the Institute for Latin American
Studies at Columbia University.
"Pinochet has ordered every book
dealing with social or political sci
ence to be burned. In addition,
10,000 students and 30 per cent of the
faculties have been expelled," Kir
berg said.
Month-long tour
Kirberg is one of four Chileans
who recently began a month-long
tour of the United States in an at
tempt to draw attention to what he
calls the political and academic rep
ression which has existed in Chile
since the overthrow of the Salvador
Allende government in September
1973.
During the Allende government of
1970 to 1973, university students
were actively involved in the trans
formation of Chilean society, accord
ing to Claudio Grossman, former
student leader of the Unidad Popular
and currently a lecturer in Interna
tional Law at the University of Ut
recht, Holland.
But "the fascist coup in 1973 ended

the democratic process in the uni
versity and abolished all the reforms
we had achieved," Grossman said.
"Pinochet has put the university at
the service of a privileged minority
and expects students to study to be
come technocrats that don't ques
tion the military dictatorship," he
said.
Education under control
The entire educational system of
the country (primary, secondary and
university) has come under military
control according to a report issued
by the United Nations Commission
on Human Rights. All university re
ctors are members of the military and
all course curricula that rnight ques
tion junta rule have been eliminated.
"Today the Chilean university re
flects the ideology of Pinochet's
tyranny which is nothing but an
ideology of military fascism," said
Dr. Eugenio Velasco, former dean of
faculty of law at the University of
Chile and presently a visiting profes
sor in the Latin American Studies
Department at UCLA.
Velasco said the military has re
written the history of Chile to include
a new "heroic chapter" in which
elementary and high school students
are taught to regard the military coup
as the second independence of
Chile.
When Velasco was being held as a
political prisonerfollowing the coup,
he said his nine-year-old daughter
was required to learn the anthems of
the Chilean national police, navy,
army and air force.
Flores speaks
The fourth panelist, Dr. Fernando
Flores, former minister of economics

and secretary general of the Allende
government, who currently teaches
a course on Chilean politics at Stan
ford, emphasized the role of U.S.
universities which support the
Pinochet regime.
Flores used economist Milton
Friedman, as an example of U.S.
academic support of the Pinochet

regime.
However, Kirberg said, many U.S.
students and faculty members have
expressed strong solidarity with the
resistance movement in Chile.
"This solidarity is important be
cause when the government feels
pressure they don't dare continue to
repress our people," Velasco added.
