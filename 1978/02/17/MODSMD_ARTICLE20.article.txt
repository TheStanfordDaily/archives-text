# Technique and energy
## Charismatic Ramsey inspires musicians here 
### Karl Bricker 
All eyes focused on the small
figure standing on the podium.
Swaying with the music, and
striking majestic, wide
sweeping blows in the air in
front of him, he squeezed the
last drops of energy out of the
chorus and orchestra before
him.
As he gave the final cutoff
and created a vacuum of awe
from the audience, William
Ramsey, director of choral
music here, dropped his tired
arms to his sides and turned to
accept the tremendous
applause.
Ramsey has a special gift for
combining schooled
technique with positive energy
that makes musicians perform
beautifully.
Responsibility
"He has a very attractive per
sonality, full of warmth and
empathy, which brings out the
best in people," said Marcia
Tanner, director of publicity
forthe music department here.
"Any tactic he uses to get sin
gers to do what he wants is an
emulation of his personality."
Before he came here in 1975,
Ramsey was Director of Choral
Activities at the University of
Utah, where he was named
"Professor of the Year" in 1970.
He has earned a Bachelor of
Music from the University of
Kentucky, a Master of Sacred
Music in Voice and Conduct
ing from Union Theological
Seminary School of Sacred
Music, and a Doctor of Educa
tion with a Major in College
Teaching and Conducting from
Columbia University.
Since his professional debut

as a vocalist in Carnegie Hall in
1962, the baritone has sung as
soloist or chorister in virtually
every major hall in this country
and Europe, and on two CBS
television shows. He has sol
oed with big names such as
Robert Shaw and Robert
Wagner, and has recorded
with both Stravinsky and
Bernstein, to name just a few.
Versatile
"He's a very versatile guy,"
said Tony Antolini, a close
friend of Ramsey's who met
him over 17 years ago in New
York City.
"Anyone who can get excel
lent reviews as a solo singer,
turn around and conduct a
chorus, and then direct an
opera . . . has proof enough
that he's no ordinary guy."
The 40-year-old conductor
began playing the piano at the
tender age of three in his home
state of Kentucky, but his ex
posure to music began even
earlier than that.
"My mother said she used to
turn on the opera to make me
stop crying. Now doesn't that
sound just like a mother," said
Ramsey with a bashful smile.
Guardian angel
As the first notes rise during
choir rehearsal, Ramsey leans
forward to elicit more expres
sion, hovering over the choir
like a guardian angel. Com
pletely engrossed in the song,
he closes his eyes and sings
along. His eyes pop open and
he taps his baton on the music
stand to stop the choir.
He points out a missed note
and before the choir members
have a chance chat to each
other, he starts conducting

again, loosening his tie and
tossing it on top of his shoes
and watch, which he took off
before rehearsal.
Another stop and his jacket
comes off. Two more correc
tions and an hour later he is
down to an undershirt and
pants. And the rehearsal ends.
Energy
"The minute he gets on that
podium with his baton in his
hand," said Antolini, "he's on
stage and the chorus is his au
dience. He has an incredible
outpour of energy. I've never
seen him conduct in a lack
luster way.
"A good conductor is a com
bination of actor and dancer as
well as musician. Bill is an actor
because he's able to show you,
with a few words, using facial
expressions, the message the
music conveys. He's a dancer
because he's able to convey
with body language that feel
ing of playing the chorus as if it
were a finely tuned instru
ment.
"Sometimes a conductor is
endowed with a kind of grace
that communicates an idea to
other people. It's either there
or it's not. It's a funny combi
nation of musicianship, body
language, persuasiveness and
communicability.
Charisma
"That charisma you feel
overflowing from him is not
just magic, though. It's the re
sult of staying home at night
and studying that score . . .
and then maybe working in
front of a mirror to see if cer
tain techniques work."
Ramsey sees his role of con
ductor as that of a vocal cheer

leader. "Most of the time in
our rehearsals is spent making
music. There is very little talk
ing," said Ramsey. There are,
however, certain times that
should be set aside in rehear
sals for vocal and psychological
rest.
At such times, Ramsey is
both entertaining and unpre
dictable. His ploys range from
starry-eyed interpretations of
musical texts to mad pound
ings on the piano of favorite
old hymns with the choir sing
ing along in mocking warbles.
Jokes
Often Ramsey's diction cor
rections culminate in sarcastic
imitations of accents ranging
from Kentucky hick to Russian
royalty. And then there are his
jokes.
"This text is taken from the
part of the Bible I always call
the cowboy prayer because it
begins, 'Stir up, oh Lord
. . ~ '" he said. •
Ramsey endorses coopera
tive music. "We're all col
leagues in this effort and the
conductor is just someone
who ties the musical knot from
all the loose ends of string.
"I find the level of intelli
gence and the inquisitive
minds particularly in the un
dergraduates, cause me to al
ways be on my guard. I must be
up for every rehearsal and I
must have done my
homework," he said.
Overextended
Ramsey currently conducts
three groups on campus,
teaches academic classes,
conducts operas, is writing a
book and keeps a full schedule
of solo performances.

Tanner described him as hav
ing "an appetite for getting in
volved in all kinds of things,
and occasionally getting over
extended.
"But at the same time, he
isn't the kind of person to neg
lect his responsibilities. If he
gets involved in something, he
does it right."
Psych
"Sometimes betore rehear
sal I have to psych myself up
to keep from showing that I'm
in a bad mood. If I waste a mi
nute of time in choir because I
don't feel good, I have collec
tively wasted 80 minutes."
Ramsey is regarded as one of
the most talented choral con
ductors in the country, and he
has that magical quality which
turns a rehearsal into an adven
ture. He has that warm person
ality, that friendly, bearded
smile which says, "It's wonder
ful to be singing with you."

that communicates an idea to
other people. It's either there
or it's not. It's a funny combi
nation of musicianship, body
language, persuasiveness and
communicability.
Charisma
"That charisma you feel
overflowing from him is not
just magic, though. It's the re
sult of staying home at night
and studying that score . . .
and then maybe working in
front of a mirror to see if cer
tain techniques work."
Ramsey sees his role of con
ductor as that of a vocal cheer

leader. "Most of the time in
our rehearsals is spent making
music. There is very little talk
ing," said Ramsey. There are,
however, certain times that
should be set aside in rehear
sals for vocal and psychological
rest.
At such times, Ramsey is
both entertaining and unpre
dictable. His ploys range from
starry-eyed interpretations of
musical texts to mad pound
ings on the piano of favorite
old hymns with the choir sing
ing along in mocking warbles.
Jokes
Often Ramsey's diction cor
rections culminate in sarcastic
imitations of accents ranging
from Kentucky hick to Russian
royalty. And then there are his
jokes.
"This text is taken from the
part of the Bible I always call
the cowboy prayer because it
begins, 'Stir up, oh Lord
. . ~ '" he said. •
Ramsey endorses coopera
tive music. "We're all col
leagues in this effort and the
conductor is just someone
who ties the musical knot from
all the loose ends of string.
"I find the level of intelli
gence and the inquisitive
minds particularly in the un
dergraduates, cause me to al
ways be on my guard. I must be
up for every rehearsal and I
must have done my
homework," he said.
Overextended
Ramsey currently conducts
three groups on campus,
teaches academic classes,
conducts operas, is writing a
book and keeps a full schedule
of solo performances.

Tanner described him as hav
ing "an appetite for getting in
volved in all kinds of things,
and occasionally getting over
extended.
"But at the same time, he
isn't the kind of person to neg
lect his responsibilities. If he
gets involved in something, he
does it right."
Psych
"Sometimes betore rehear
sal I have to psych myself up
to keep from showing that I'm
in a bad mood. If I waste a mi
nute of time in choir because I
don't feel good, I have collec
tively wasted 80 minutes."
Ramsey is regarded as one of
the most talented choral con
ductors in the country, and he
has that magical quality which
turns a rehearsal into an adven
ture. He has that warm person
ality, that friendly, bearded
smile which says, "It's wonder
ful to be singing with you."


William Ramsey
All eyes focused on the small
figure standing on the podium.
Swaying with the music, and
striking majestic, wide
sweeping blows in the air in
front of him, he squeezed the
last drops of energy out of the
chorus and orchestra before
him.
As he gave the final cutoff
and created a vacuum of awe
from the audience, William
Ramsey, director of choral
music here, dropped his tired
arms to his sides and turned to
accept the tremendous
applause.
Ramsey has a special gift for
combining schooled
technique with positive energy
that makes musicians perform
beautifully.
Responsibility
"He has a very attractive per
sonality, full of warmth and
empathy, which brings out the
best in people," said Marcia
Tanner, director of publicity
forthe music department here.
"Any tactic he uses to get sin
gers to do what he wants is an
emulation of his personality."
Before he came here in 1975,
Ramsey was Director of Choral
Activities at the University of
Utah, where he was named
"Professor of the Year" in 1970.
He has earned a Bachelor of
Music from the University of
Kentucky, a Master of Sacred
Music in Voice and Conduct
ing from Union Theological
Seminary School of Sacred
Music, and a Doctor of Educa
tion with a Major in College
Teaching and Conducting from
Columbia University.
Since his professional debut

as a vocalist in Carnegie Hall in
1962, the baritone has sung as
soloist or chorister in virtually
every major hall in this country
and Europe, and on two CBS
television shows. He has sol
oed with big names such as
Robert Shaw and Robert
Wagner, and has recorded
with both Stravinsky and
Bernstein, to name just a few.
Versatile
"He's a very versatile guy,"
said Tony Antolini, a close
friend of Ramsey's who met
him over 17 years ago in New
York City.
"Anyone who can get excel
lent reviews as a solo singer,
turn around and conduct a
chorus, and then direct an
opera . . . has proof enough
that he's no ordinary guy."
The 40-year-old conductor
began playing the piano at the
tender age of three in his home
state of Kentucky, but his ex
posure to music began even
earlier than that.
"My mother said she used to
turn on the opera to make me
stop crying. Now doesn't that
sound just like a mother," said
Ramsey with a bashful smile.
Guardian angel
As the first notes rise during
choir rehearsal, Ramsey leans
forward to elicit more expres
sion, hovering over the choir
like a guardian angel. Com
pletely engrossed in the song,
he closes his eyes and sings
along. His eyes pop open and
he taps his baton on the music
stand to stop the choir.
He points out a missed note
and before the choir members
have a chance chat to each
other, he starts conducting

again, loosening his tie and
tossing it on top of his shoes
and watch, which he took off
before rehearsal.
Another stop and his jacket
comes off. Two more correc
tions and an hour later he is
down to an undershirt and
pants. And the rehearsal ends.
Energy
"The minute he gets on that
podium with his baton in his
hand," said Antolini, "he's on
stage and the chorus is his au
dience. He has an incredible
outpour of energy. I've never
seen him conduct in a lack
luster way.
"A good conductor is a com
bination of actor and dancer as
well as musician. Bill is an actor
because he's able to show you,
with a few words, using facial
expressions, the message the
music conveys. He's a dancer
because he's able to convey
with body language that feel
ing of playing the chorus as if it
were a finely tuned instru
ment.

Music from the University of
Kentucky, a Master of Sacred
Music in Voice and Conduct
ing from Union Theological
Seminary School of Sacred
Music, and a Doctor of Educa
tion with a Major in College
Teaching and Conducting from
Columbia University.
Since his professional debut

as a vocalist in Carnegie Hall in
1962, the baritone has sung as
soloist or chorister in virtually
every major hall in this country
and Europe, and on two CBS
television shows. He has sol
oed with big names such as
Robert Shaw and Robert
Wagner, and has recorded
with both Stravinsky and
Bernstein, to name just a few.
Versatile
"He's a very versatile guy,"
said Tony Antolini, a close
friend of Ramsey's who met
him over 17 years ago in New
York City.
"Anyone who can get excel
lent reviews as a solo singer,
turn around and conduct a
chorus, and then direct an
opera . . . has proof enough
that he's no ordinary guy."
The 40-year-old conductor
began playing the piano at the
tender age of three in his home
state of Kentucky, but his ex
posure to music began even
earlier than that.
"My mother said she used to
turn on the opera to make me
stop crying. Now doesn't that
sound just like a mother," said
Ramsey with a bashful smile.
Guardian angel
As the first notes rise during
choir rehearsal, Ramsey leans
forward to elicit more expres
sion, hovering over the choir
like a guardian angel. Com
pletely engrossed in the song,
he closes his eyes and sings
along. His eyes pop open and
he taps his baton on the music
stand to stop the choir.
He points out a missed note
and before the choir members
have a chance chat to each
other, he starts conducting

again, loosening his tie and
tossing it on top of his shoes
and watch, which he took off
before rehearsal.
Another stop and his jacket
comes off. Two more correc
tions and an hour later he is
down to an undershirt and
pants. And the rehearsal ends.
Energy
"The minute he gets on that
podium with his baton in his
hand," said Antolini, "he's on
stage and the chorus is his au
dience. He has an incredible
outpour of energy. I've never
seen him conduct in a lack
luster way.
"A good conductor is a com
bination of actor and dancer as
well as musician. Bill is an actor
because he's able to show you,
with a few words, using facial
expressions, the message the
music conveys. He's a dancer
because he's able to convey
with body language that feel
ing of playing the chorus as if it
were a finely tuned instru
ment.
"Sometimes a conductor is
endowed with a kind of grace
that communicates an idea to
other people. It's either there
or it's not. It's a funny combi
nation of musicianship, body
language, persuasiveness and
communicability.
Charisma
"That charisma you feel
overflowing from him is not
just magic, though. It's the re
sult of staying home at night
and studying that score . . .
and then maybe working in
front of a mirror to see if cer
tain techniques work."
Ramsey sees his role of con
ductor as that of a vocal cheer

leader. "Most of the time in
our rehearsals is spent making
music. There is very little talk
ing," said Ramsey. There are,
however, certain times that
should be set aside in rehear
sals for vocal and psychological
rest.
At such times, Ramsey is
both entertaining and unpre
dictable. His ploys range from
starry-eyed interpretations of
musical texts to mad pound
ings on the piano of favorite
old hymns with the choir sing
ing along in mocking warbles.
Jokes
Often Ramsey's diction cor
rections culminate in sarcastic
imitations of accents ranging
from Kentucky hick to Russian
royalty. And then there are his
jokes.
"This text is taken from the
part of the Bible I always call
the cowboy prayer because it
begins, 'Stir up, oh Lord
. . ~ '" he said. •
Ramsey endorses coopera
tive music. "We're all col
leagues in this effort and the
conductor is just someone
who ties the musical knot from
all the loose ends of string.
"I find the level of intelli
gence and the inquisitive
minds particularly in the un
dergraduates, cause me to al
ways be on my guard. I must be
up for every rehearsal and I
must have done my
homework," he said.
Overextended
Ramsey currently conducts
three groups on campus,
teaches academic classes,
conducts operas, is writing a
book and keeps a full schedule
of solo performances.

Tanner described him as hav
ing "an appetite for getting in
volved in all kinds of things,
and occasionally getting over
extended.
"But at the same time, he
isn't the kind of person to neg
lect his responsibilities. If he
gets involved in something, he
does it right."
Psych
"Sometimes betore rehear
sal I have to psych myself up
to keep from showing that I'm
in a bad mood. If I waste a mi
nute of time in choir because I
don't feel good, I have collec
tively wasted 80 minutes."
Ramsey is regarded as one of
the most talented choral con
ductors in the country, and he
has that magical quality which
turns a rehearsal into an adven
ture. He has that warm person
ality, that friendly, bearded
smile which says, "It's wonder
ful to be singing with you."


William Ramsey
All eyes focused on the small
figure standing on the podium.
Swaying with the music, and
striking majestic, wide
sweeping blows in the air in
front of him, he squeezed the
last drops of energy out of the
chorus and orchestra before
him.
As he gave the final cutoff
and created a vacuum of awe
from the audience, William
Ramsey, director of choral
music here, dropped his tired
arms to his sides and turned to
accept the tremendous
applause.
Ramsey has a special gift for
combining schooled
technique with positive energy
that makes musicians perform
beautifully.
Responsibility
"He has a very attractive per
sonality, full of warmth and
empathy, which brings out the
best in people," said Marcia
Tanner, director of publicity
forthe music department here.
"Any tactic he uses to get sin
gers to do what he wants is an
emulation of his personality."
Before he came here in 1975,
Ramsey was Director of Choral
Activities at the University of
Utah, where he was named
"Professor of the Year" in 1970.
