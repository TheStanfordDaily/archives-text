Although Chinese food
holds a very popular and envi
able position amidst the great
variety of foreign cuisines that
is found in the United States,
most Chinese restaurants
seem to serve only lunch and
dinner.
Thus, the concept of a
Chinese breakfast is a foreign
one to most people, as it was to
me before eating at Asia Gar
dens. Located in the heart of
Chinatown, Asia Gardens
serves breakfast every Sat. and
Sun., opening at 9:00.
Having had no idea of what
to expect, I must admit that it
was very consoling to see that
of the 600 people who were

breakfasting (that's right, six
hundred) 599 were oriental. By
9:30, there was already a 30 mi
nute wait, and I began to think
that the wait was going to be a
lot longer when the host began
calling off the numbers and
names in Chinese.
Well, to make a story that
wasn't really that long short,
the meal was great. The break
fast, called Dim Sum, consists
of an infinite variety of dishes,
each ordered one at a time as
the waitress comes by, pushing
a cart.
The great thing about order
ing that way is you can see what
you are ordering first hand,
and can stop as soon as you are
full (if only I had done that).
Dim Sum, also known as Tea
Cakes, is not a particular dish.
Rather, it is a variety of dishes

which are of a certain genre.
Most of the dishes, such as the
Har Gau (steamed shrimp) and
the Wo Tien (a dumpling with
ground pork, shrimp and mus
hrooms, also known as a Pot
Sticker), are steamed and
served in bamboo or
aluminum vats.
My favorite is the Char Sui
Bao (a sweet pork wrapped in a
fluffy sweetdough and then
steamed). There are also many
other dishes which are not
cooked in steamers, such as
the Bai Qwat (spare ribs) and
the Tsen Gen (egg rolls).
Many desserts are also avail
able, and in what seems to be
an effort to make things dif
ficult for one who must make a
choice for the first time, every
thing looks good. Custard (An
Tat), puffed rice made with

coconut, honey and sugar (Sa
Shi Ma), and rice cake (a
gelatinous dessert made from
rice and sugar) are just a few.
The atmosphere at Asia Gar
dens is more than just unique.
Try to picture 600 seated
people (599 orientals and me),
with at least fifteen waitresses
pushing carts with different
dishes at any given time. Some
waitresses speak English —
others don't. You would be
amazed at how easy it is to get
by with pointing.
For those who thrive on au
thenticity, Asia Gardens is a
paradise. Breakfast is relatively
inexpensive. The bill is totaled
according to the amount of
plates per table, each dish cost
ing $.60. Including tip and an
enormous meal, we each spent
$5.00.
The restaurant fills very
rapidly, and it is advisable to be
there by 9:00 to avoid waiting.
For me, Asia Gardens for
breakfast was a unique and
new experience.
The meal was enjoyable and
tasty, but even more interest
ing was seeing a segment of
Chinese culture of which I had
been totally ignorant. I just
keep wondering, though, why
I was the only one to whom
they gave a fork.
