# Excellent French cuisine takes care of rain, midterms

Chez Michel's
804 N. Point
San Francisco
It's raining again, midterms
seem inescapable, and Valen
tine's Day was dismal. An eleg
ant dinner at Chez Michel's
might make next week beara
ble. Located just west of
Ghirardelli Square, Michel El
kaim's relatively new estab
lishment has already found its
place among San Francisco's
finest restaurants.
Colorful handmade tapes
tries, mirrored walls, and
freshly-cut roses on each table
give the interior a sense of
polished refinement. We were
received by le proprietaire him
self who seated us at the bar,
which despite its prominent
location, had an almost imti
mate quality.
The bartender brought us
each a chilled glass of Kirr,
white wine with a slight touch
of Creme de Cassis.
The attentive Monsieur El
kaim reappeared to show us to
our table, to gracefully place
the napkins on our laps, and to
personally take our orders en
francais. The meal began with

le Pate de Campagne (3.25), an
attractively presented, some
what salty liver pate, accom
panied by a basket of warm
french bread.
Our next selection, a sharp
and savory L'Oignon Gratinee
(French Onion Soup, 2.50) was
complemented rather than
overpowered by the crouton
and stringy melted cheese.
Even the simple Salade Verte
(2.00) was prepared with
finesse.
While we waited for the main
course, Le Canard Roti a
rOrange (9.00) and L'Escalope
de Veau au Champagne
(10.25), we sipped a fruity
Beaujolais (8.00).
Our entrees were presented
on steaming platters. A gener
ous serving of roast duck was
covered with a thick spicy
sauce and garnished with
baked orange slices.
Our other choice, tender
pieces of veal smothered in a
velvety blend of tomatoes,
sour cream, and champagne,
then sprinkled with cheese,
further testified to the exper
tise of the chef. Both dishes

were accompanied by buttery
carrots, lightly sauteed green
beans, and wild rice.
In the true French manner,
after the main course, we were
served a selection of cheeses
(3.00). We chose the traditional
Brie and Camembert, which
was decoratively arranged with
sliced apples. After cleansing
our pallettes, our appetites
were again aroused as we em
barked upon the exquisite
Chocolat Truffle Cake (2.00).
This Chez Michel's specialty
has a rich, dark-chocolate bot
tom layer covered with fluffy
whipped cream. Coffee (80
cents) was offered immediately
following dessert, after which
we were invited to sample
Amaretto, an almond liqueur
with a twist of lemon.
As Michel bid us adieu with
his classic savoir faire, it was
easy to feel part of the cos
mopolitan clientele which fre
quents his restaurant.Stanford
life, with dreary weather and
overdue papers, never seemed
so far away.
