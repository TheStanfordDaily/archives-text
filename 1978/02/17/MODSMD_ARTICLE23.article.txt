Washington Square Bar and
Grill
1707 Powell Street
San Francisco
In attempting to appeal to
"artists, writers, political
people and non-financial dis
trict tvpe businessmen,"
Washington Square Bar and
Grill seems to have managed to
agree with almost everyone.
Already enjoying four years of
success, not only as a bar and
grill but also as "a place to be
seen," Washington Square Bar
and Grill is doing so well that
reservations are recom
mended, especially from
Wednesday on.
The menu features a large
variety of dishes with an obvi
ous Italian influence. Pastas,

such as spaghetti, ravioli, and
fettuccini, run around five dol
lars.
Hamburgers, steaks, a few
egg dishes (and plenty of
omelettes on the lunch menu),
and a large variety of salads and
antipastos are also available,
but their most commonly or
dered dishes are their unique
preparations of veal and fish.
The Scaloppini Picata al'Aldo
(scaloppini is a preparation of
veal in which the veal is cut into
small, thin pieces) was too
lemony. However, there is a
large variety of veal dishes
from which to choose.
Among their seafood dishes,
The Fresh Petrale Saute
Meuniere is excellent — very
light, fluffy, and tasty. For

those of you who are not re
pulsed by tentacles, a few
Calamari (squid) dishes are
also offered, as well as scal
lops, prawns and fresh Rex
sole.
Although the noise from the
bar sometimes makes the art of
conversing difficult (especially
if you are seated next to it —
something I would try to av
oid), the atmosphere is un
ique.
The decor is neat and plain,
with a lot of stained wood and
charming pictures of
Washington Square of yes
teryear, and plenty of old
fashioned coat racks.
The service is generally
prompt and personal, and one
would be advised to follow the

waiter's recommendations.
Open seven days a week,
Washington Square Bar and
Grill serves lunch Monday-
Friday from 11:00-3:00, with an
"inbetween menu" available
between lunch and dinner.
Washington Square Bar and
Grill offers a full menu from
11:30 on Saturday, and brunch
is served Sunday from 10:00-
3:00.
Entrees generally run around
five dollars, so one can gener
ally plan on spending aboutten
dollars for a complete meal
(liquor excluded). Over thirty
different varieties of Califor
nia, French and Italian wines
are served.
With its stand-up bar and
old-fashioned decor, the at
mosphere of Washington
Square Bar and Grill is very ap
pealing, though a little too
noisy. Vet the ambience is not
the only force of persuasion
which continually brings back
the same people who know
they will have to wait for a ta
ble.
And although the food is
good, it is not the only motiva
tional force either. Rather, it is
the enjoyable combination of
good food, a fun atmosphere,
and interesting clientele which
make Washington Square Bar
and Grill a worthwhile place to
try.

are served.

Washington Square Bar and
Grill
1707 Powell Street
San Francisco
In attempting to appeal to
"artists, writers, political
people and non-financial dis
trict tvpe businessmen,"
Washington Square Bar and
Grill seems to have managed to
agree with almost everyone.
Already enjoying four years of
success, not only as a bar and
grill but also as "a place to be
seen," Washington Square Bar
and Grill is doing so well that
reservations are recom
mended, especially from
Wednesday on.
The menu features a large
variety of dishes with an obvi
ous Italian influence. Pastas,

such as spaghetti, ravioli, and
fettuccini, run around five dol
lars.
Hamburgers, steaks, a few
egg dishes (and plenty of
omelettes on the lunch menu),
and a large variety of salads and
antipastos are also available,
but their most commonly or
dered dishes are their unique
preparations of veal and fish.
The Scaloppini Picata al'Aldo
(scaloppini is a preparation of
veal in which the veal is cut into
small, thin pieces) was too
lemony. However, there is a
large variety of veal dishes
from which to choose.
Among their seafood dishes,
The Fresh Petrale Saute
Meuniere is excellent — very
light, fluffy, and tasty. For

those of you who are not re
pulsed by tentacles, a few
Calamari (squid) dishes are
also offered, as well as scal
lops, prawns and fresh Rex
sole.
Although the noise from the
bar sometimes makes the art of
conversing difficult (especially
if you are seated next to it —
something I would try to av
oid), the atmosphere is un
ique.
The decor is neat and plain,
with a lot of stained wood and
charming pictures of
Washington Square of yes
teryear, and plenty of old
fashioned coat racks.
The service is generally
prompt and personal, and one
would be advised to follow the

waiter's recommendations.
Open seven days a week,
Washington Square Bar and
Grill serves lunch Monday-
Friday from 11:00-3:00, with an
"inbetween menu" available
between lunch and dinner.

Grill offers a full menu from
