# Enjoy omelettes and the waves at Point Lobos

The most impressive and un
ique feature of the San Francis
can restaurant, Upstairs at the
Cliff House, has to be its loca
tion. Situated on Point Lobos it
gives a magnificent view of the
Pacific Ocean and if you arrive
early enough, you can even
witness a colorful sunset while
dining.
In addition to its favorable

seascape location, Upstairs at
the Cliff House boasts of being
"The Tiffanys of Omelette
Palaces." With a tempting as
sortment of 35 different
omelettes ranging in price
from $3.00 for a cheesy cheese
omelette to $5.50 for a shrimp,
avocado and bacon omelette,
it is difficult to make a selec
tion.
All omelettes are served with
pan fried potatoes or rice

pilaff, fruit garnish and toasted
wheatberry English muffins.
The dinner served isquitelarge
considering the reasonable
prices.
Vegetarians and non
vegetarians alike would enjoy
the food at Cliff House. Served
with a hot sandwich is fresh
fruit garnish and mixed green
salad.
The Roast Beef a la Monte

Cristo ($3.95) is made with
sliced, rare roast beef and
sharp cheddar cheese on sour
dough. Dipped in french toast
batter, it will without doubt
satisfy any appetite.
Besides the usual beverages
offered, two typically Cliff
House drinks featured are
"The Golden Sunrise" ($1.50)
and "Hot Mulled Wine"
($1.25). "The Golden Sunrise,"
a blend of orange juice and

champagne, is a flavorful drink
that I recommend should be
sampled.
For dessert, I selected hot
apple crisp ($1.35) topped with
whipped cream and a bountiful
amount of cinnamon. My
companion ordered a delici
ous piece of German chocolate
layer cake ($1.35).
As for the atmosphere at Up
stairs at the Cliff House, it suc

cessfully portrays the Victorian
era with its tiffj.iy lamps,
nineteenth century lithog
raphs, and carvings from ships.
The hanging plants, the
nineteenth century San Fran
ciscan momentos, and the
ample ocean view through its
large windows all harmonized
well to achieve a distinctly San
Franciscan flavor.
