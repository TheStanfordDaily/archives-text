# Oregon edges Cards, 65-64
## Foul shots in final seconds sink Stanford 
### David Georgette 
To think that of the 100 and
more points scored in a bas
ketball game, two can make
the difference between unre
strained joy and bitter frustra
tion tends to make the out
come of a close game seem
most arbitrary.
It's happened often to the
Stanford Cardinals this season,
and it happened again last
night as the Oregon Ducks
downed the Cards, 65-64.
Guard Mike Drummond
booed by the Stanford fans
every time he touched the ball
in the first half, sank two free
throws with five seconds left to
boost the Ducks to a 4-6 record
in the Pacific-8 (14-9 overall)
and leave Stanford at 1-9 in
conference and 11-12 overall.
Drummond had been fouled
by Wolfe Perry on a d rive to the
baseline 19 seconds after Per
ry's 20-footer had put the
Cards' on top with 24 seconds
left.
Oregon called time-out after
Drummond's two free throws.
The Cards' desperation shot
after the time-out was not
close.
"I called time out to put
more pressure on Stanford to
take the ball up the court," said
Duck coach Dick Harter.
"Stanford was out of time
outs. We were just fortunate
that their shot didn't go in,
realizing that this happened to
Stanford last week."
"Once again, we have had a
close encounter of the worst
kind," said Stanford coach
Dick Dißiaso. "You have to be
disappointed for the team be
cause you know how hard they
played, but they still managed
to come up short."
Cards rally
Stanford had trailed 63-60
with less than two minutes left,

but Daryle Morgan's 16-footer,
his first basket of the game, cut
the margin to one with 1:35
remaining.
Then Drummond missed the
front end of a one-and-one,
and the Cards came downcourt
only to lose the ball on a tur
nover.
Drummond was fouled
again, and missed again, be
fore Perry sank his jumper. It
was the 10th lead change in the
second half.
"We did what we had to do,"
said Harter. "I was happy for
Mike Drummond, especially
after missing the two oppor
tunities. Our defense changed
the complexity in the second
half. We played with more
force, more enthusiasm."
After the game, the Ducks
showed plenty of enthusiasm.
One would have thought they
had just won the Pac-8 the way
they were jumping up and
down and hugging each other.
"Every game is a big one for
us," said Harter. "I hope this
game wakes us up."
Forward Felton Sealey had a
lot to do with waking up the
Ducks last night. The freshman
guard was seven for 12 from
the field, six-for-six at the free
throw line and grabbed seven
rebounds. Another freshman,
Phil Barner, added 15 for the
Ducks.
Perry paced Stanford with 20
points, hitting nine of 16 from
the field.
Stanford had led by six with
seven minutes left after Jay
Carter had finished off a fast
break with a lay-in while being
fouled by Drummond. But
Barner came back with six of
Oregon's next seven points to
pull the Ducks within 1 point,
59-58. Two free throws, a steal
and a lay-in gave the Ducks the
lead.

Stanford, ahead 35-29 at half,
led by as many as seven points
in the first half after a slow
start. The Cards scored 29
points in the final 12 minutes of
the half to overcome a 14-6
Oregon advantage.
Tomorrow night the Cards
host Oregon State in the Cards'
last home game. OSU defeated
Cal last night, 70-68. The Beav
ers are in second place in the
Pac-8 with a 7-3 record (14-9
overall) and on a three-game
winning streak.
Coach Ralph Miller has kept
his team near the top of the
Pac-8 standings despite its
youth and the loss of center
Steve Johnson.
Miller had constructed his
offense around the sopho
more center Johnson, one of
the two returning starters. But
Johnson, who for the three
games he played had a2O point
average, went down with a
brokenankleand hasn'tplayed
in any of the conference
games.
So Miller returned to the
kind of offense he used last
year — one emphasizing out
side shooting.
Three of the Beavers' top
players — guards Mark Rad
ford and Ray Blume and center
Bill McShane — are shooting
over 50 per cent from the floor,
and they are all freshmen.
Blume leads the Pac-8 in field
goal shooting for conference
games, making 62 per cent of
his shots.
The Beavers are "a very
quick team with good shooters
and ballhandlers," said Di-
Biaso.
When the Cards were in
Corvallis for the opening game
of the Pac-8 season, the Beav
ers pressed them the length of
the court nearly the whole
game.
