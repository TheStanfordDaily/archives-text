Stanford received na
tional letters of intent from
two more recruits yester
day, bringing to 14 the
number of recruits the
Cards have landed since
Wednesday when the let
ters could first be tendered.
Vince Williams, a 6-foot
3, 220 lb. linebacker from
Detroit's Cass Technologi
cal, chose Stanford over
Michigan. "He's one of the
best linebacking prospects
Stanford has ever re
cruited," said Card coach

Bill Walsh.
Craig Awbrey, a 6-3, 230
lb. offensive and defensive
lineman from Menlo-
Atherton High is the other
recruit to sign.
With Williams coming to
the Farm, the Cards have
now landed four of their top
five recruits. Stanford is still
seeking a top quarterback
prospect from the Los
Angeles area who is also
considering USC, and a
lineman from Colton,
Wash., who is going to visit
Notre Dame this weekend.
