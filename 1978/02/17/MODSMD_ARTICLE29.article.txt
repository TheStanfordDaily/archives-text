Heralded by Senior co
captain Stu Corliss as the "BIG
SPLASH" of the season, Stan
ford clashes with powerful
University of California at de-
Guerre pool Saturday, at 1 p.m.
The Berkeley Bears, once a
walkover win for Stanford,
travel to the Farm with hopes of
a repeat of last year's victory
over the Cards, their first in 37
years.
This year's Cal team is its
strongest ever, and is expected
to place among the top five
teams at the NCAA champion
ships in March. Boasting five
Olympians and numerous
Ail-Americans, Cal is slightly
favored over Stanford. Every
event, however, should be ex
tremely close, as swimmers
from both squads vie for top
places and NCAA qualifying
standards.
"Both teams are really up for
the meet," said swim coach Jim
Caughran of Stanford's con
frontation with Cal. "Many in
dividuals have rested for the
meet, trying to make Pac-8 and
NCAA standards. We expect a
lot of very close, exciting
races."

Leading the Bears are two of
the world's premiere swim
mers, Peter Rocca and Graham
Smith. Rocca, a silver medalist
behind John Naber in the
Montreal Olympics in the 100
meter and 200 meter
backstroke events, is picked to
win both backstroke races at
the NCAA meet. Smith, a
Canadian Olympian, currently
holds the world record in the
200 meter individual medley
and is the defending NCAA
champion in both the 100 and
200 yard breaststroke events.
Stanford needs strong per
formances from everyone if
they are to upset California.
Freshmen Monte Brown (dis
tance freestyle) and Ted Knapp
(100 and 200 free) could be key
factors in Saturday's meet.
Both seek to better NCAA cut
off times in their events. Knapp
will be hard pressed by team
mates Jon Powell, Kevin Reel
and Sam Franklin and by Cal's
Jim Fairbank, Mike Ellerman
and Paul Sims. Brown will join
cohorts Mike Bruner and Paul
Hartioff, hopeful of Stanford
sweep* in the 500 free and 1650
free.

meter and 200 meter
backstroke events, is picked to
win both backstroke races at
the NCAA meet. Smith, a
Canadian Olympian, currently
holds the world record in the
200 meter individual medley
and is the defending NCAA
champion in both the 100 and
200 yard breaststroke events.
Stanford needs strong per
formances from everyone if
they are to upset California.
Freshmen Monte Brown (dis
tance freestyle) and Ted Knapp
(100 and 200 free) could be key
factors in Saturday's meet.
Both seek to better NCAA cut
off times in their events. Knapp
will be hard pressed by team
mates Jon Powell, Kevin Reel
and Sam Franklin and by Cal's
Jim Fairbank, Mike Ellerman
and Paul Sims. Brown will join
cohorts Mike Bruner and Paul
Hartioff, hopeful of Stanford
sweep* in the 500 free and 1650
free.
