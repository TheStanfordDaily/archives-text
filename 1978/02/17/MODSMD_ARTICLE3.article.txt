# Administration questions SCRIP'S power on campus
## 
### Emily Sachar News analysis 
Top University administrators be
lieve Stanford's Committee for Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP)
has lost considerable influence here
over the past year. However, SCRIP
leaders deny this claim.
"In terms of sheer numbers, there
are certainly less people involved
this year. Maybe it's the time of year,
winter quarter, but I have a feeling
that students and the University
community, in general, are content
to see what happens with the newly
formed Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR)," said Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president of public
affairs.
"Any group that's trying to buck
that feeling, like SCRIP is, is bound to
run into trouble," he added.
SCRIP policies call for immediate
divestment of stocks of companies
operating in South Africa, a plan
which some say is "too black and
white" to be practical.
"SCRIP is demanding instant re
sults. They are operating on what can
be termed an instant gratification
system," said Robert Hamrdla, assis
tant to the president for trustee af
fairs.
"But human nature does not work
that way. SCRIP tends to simplify

human nature, while we really need
to be more tentative in rendering
moral judgments," he added.
Hamrdla said he has also noticed a
decline in student participation in
SCRIP functions. He cites as evi
dence the SCRIP meeting of Nov. 30
where fewer than 100 students at
tended.
SCRlPspokesperson Laura Carlsen
denies SCRIP has lost any support.
She said dorm outreach programs
"have been showing good input on
our policies. Students are more in
formed than ever on the issue."
Carlsen said petitions calling for an
explanation of trustee policies have
brought in large numbers of signa
tures.
"The petitions aren't centralized
yet so I have no way o, knowing
exactly how many people have
signed but lots of people have ex
pressed willingness to be rontacted
by SCRIP," Carlsen said.
However, SCRIP support of the
type Carlsen describes is dlf.icult to
measure. More quantitative data
such as meeting attendance indicate
lower participation levels than last
year.
SCRIP has been less visible this
year, according to member Eric
Boysen.
After marches or rallies, Boysen
said, SCRIP attracts more people to
its meetings. Otherwise, 30 to 50 stu
dents generally attend.
"But we musn't forget," Carlsen
said, "there is a difference between
support and mobilized support, lust
because less people are involved
doesn't indicate any type of trend."
Certain SCRIP actions have been
confusing, Rosenzweig said. SCRIP
members delivered an ultimatum to
administrators and trustees to begin
partial divestment by Feb. 14. The
ultimatum was withdrawn Feb. 2.

Administrators have not been con
tacted by SCRIP since that time.
"It was a puzzling action on the
part of SCRIP. SCRIP members never
came to discuss the ultimatum with
us and they never stated what they
would do if we did not follow the
ultimatum order," Rosenzweig said.
However, SCRIP leaders say the
demand for divestment is an "ongo
ing process." Even without a divest
ment deadline, SCRIP members say
they will be gathering support.
"We're still optimistic. It's realistic
to expect trustees to divest," Carlsen
said. The trustees have listened to
SCRIP "informally and that's a move
in the right direction," she added.
SCRIP has published divestment
pamphlets and shown a prize
winning underground film made in
South Africa during this academic
year, according to SCRIP. Dorm pre
sentations and sherry hours have
been part of SCRIP efforts to gain
mobilized support. SCRIP has also
sent SCRIP literature to the trustees
and distributed the Catalyst Project
Book on South Africa which discus
ses U.S. investments there.
These activities may help gather
support in favor of divestment, but
some feel SCRIP still acts with little
regard for practical solutions.
"SCRIP seems to say, 'If you ques
tion the premise that U.S. corpora
tions ought not to be in South Africa
then you are automatically for apar
theid,' " Hamrdla said.
"Divestment comes at the end of
the road, not the beginning. SCRIP
and many other people as well say
'You aren't listening to us,' when
they should be saying You're not in
agreement with us,' " Hamrdla ad
ded.
"Their statements are too strident.
And they just don't appeal to human
nature," Hamrdla said.
