# Law Review, Faculty tie
## 
### Josh Kadish 
The Stanford Law Faculty played the Law Re
view to a tie Wednesday afternoon in their first
annual basketball match. In a game riddled with
substantive arid procedural questions, the Profs
demonstrated once again that their equitable
arguments could at least counter the Review's
zealous efficiency criteria.
While only five stalwarts turned out for the
Profs, the Review ran two squads throughout,
thereby spreading the risk of loss. The early
game thus saw the Review's numerical strength
pitted against the Profs' crafty yet frenzied cun
ning.
In response to an appeal for distributive jus
tice, Review coach Jonathan Paris gave away
6-foot-7 Marc McConnell to the Profs after only
10 minutes of play. The game was tied at 22-all, at
the half, prompting several Reviewers to argue
that the McConnell deal was void for lack of
consideration on the contract. The faculty inter
posed a defense of laches, and referee Rob
Weisberg upheld the deal on an estoppel
theory.
After the half, the Profs attempted a pro
cedural innovation by playing only four men.
This proved to be a double-edged coin, and by
returning to a traditional format the Profs man

aged to pull steadily ahead.
With only eight minutes left to play, the Profs
led 42-32, largely due to the combined efforts of
rookie Mark Kelman and a mysterious ringer
said to have been discovered working in a
backpack shop in Palo Alto.
Showing the grim determination that has got
ten them past many deadlines, the Review nar
rowed the gap until with two minutes to go, the
score stood at 48-44. In an effort to run out the
clock, the Profs called for a volunteer to state t he
facts of the game. No one raised his hand.
As the final whistle blew, Assistant Managing
Editor Jim Carpenter lofted in a 15-foot jumper
to tie the score at 48-all. In a Solomon-like deci
sion, the ref decided to split the baby with the
bathwater, and refused to put the game into
overtime.
The referee, a last minute substitute for
Charles Reich, called both personal fouls and
errors in proper citation form throughout the
game.
During post-game analysis, Carpenter was
selected Most Valuable Player by his peers, and
Kelman took top honors for the Profs. Players
and spectators agreed that the holding of the
game was unclear, but hoped that it would have
significant precedential value.
