"The fastest game on two feet" is a phrase
often attributed to women's lacrosse, according
to coach Barbara Longstreth.
The Stanford women's lacrosse club began its
season last Saturday with scrimmages against
three other Bay Area teams. Under the guidance
of Longstreth and the enthusiasm of nearly 20
women, women's lacrosse looks forward to its
second year of inter-club competition. Games
or tournaments will be held every weekend now
through April, and most of those matches will
take place on home ground on the Roble fields.
Women's lacrosse can't justly be compared to
men's lacrosse, according to Longstreth.
"Rather than asking what the differences are
between men's and women's lacrosse, you
should be asking what their similarities are," she

said. "They call it the same name, play with the
same ball, and use the same (goal) cage, but
other than that the games are very different."
For instance, while the boundaries for a men's
lacrosse game are specified, the women's lac
rosse field has only natural boundaries, such as
a row of trees or a street. This allows the players
greater freedom of movement and lends to the
fast pace of the game.
"We're just recognized now as an organiza
tion," said Longstreth, one of the principle fi
gures in women's lacrosse on the west coast.
There are now six club teams in California, na
tionally recognized as the California Women's
Lacrosse Association. Last year Longstreth lead
an all-California squad against the visiting Au
stralian Touring team. She hopes that within a
few years the CWLA will be able to send a team
to the NationaJ Tournament on the east coast.
