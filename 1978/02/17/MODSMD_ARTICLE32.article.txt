Despite the absence of four
regulars, the Stanford Hockey
Club returned from Los
Angeles with two more vic
tories, extending their unde
feated record to six wins and
no losses. The team flew down
last Sunday to play Cal State-
Northridge in the morning,
and USC later that afternoon.
Henry Dudley starred for the
Cards in the first game as he
managed a hat trick in Stan
ford's 7-5 win. The game was
close until late in the third
period when Dudley, Danny
Schley and Pat Baldwin each
tallied to put the game out of

reach. Mike Millatola and Mark
Cunha also scored for the
Cards.
In the afternoon contest
against USC, the game was not
as close as the 4-3 score might
indicate. As winger Kenny
Breitenbach said, "We led the
entire game, and the score re
ally should have been much
more one-sided in our favor; I
think the pitchers of Margaritas
between games might have
slowed us up a bit." Jay
Johnstone had two goals for
the Cards against USC, and
John von Schlegell and Mark
Cunha each added one.
