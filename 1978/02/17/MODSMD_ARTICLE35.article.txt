# Busy weekend set for Cardinal nine
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
In hopes of a fair-weather
Washington's, Birthday
weekend, the Stanford
baseball team sets out to add a
few more games to this, thus
far, rain-hindered preseason
activity. The team meets Pep
perdine, a southern California
club, in Stanford's Sunken
Diamond for a single game at
2:30 this afternoon and at noon
on Saturday for a doub
leheader.
Pepperdine, suffering from a
similar fate of a washed-out
preseason, comes to Stanford
in good standing after having
beaten USC 3-0 on
and tying with Cal Poly Pomonar
on Wednesday. Coach Mark
Marquess expects the visitors
to be a tough match, because
on top of several returnees
from last year's team, Pepper
dine had "one of the best re
cruiting years of anyone."
The Cardinals, meanwhile,
added a fourth win to their un
blemished record Wednesday
afternoon when they took a
second game away from Hay
ward State, 8-3. The impressive
Stanford pitching staff, this
time led by Joe LoPresti and
Larry Kuhn, allowed the
Pioneers only four hits in the
nine innings while Tom Guar
dino and Mike Codiroli paced
the Cards at the plate.
With the score tied at three
apiece in the bottom of the
sixth, and Cardinals Randy
Wong and Bruce Walters on
first and second, centerfielder
Larry Reynolds came to bat.
Reynolds singled and an error
on the Pioneer secondbase
man allowed Walters to score
giving Stanford its go-ahead
run. Designated hitter Tom
Guardino then stepped up to
the plate and clubbed an inside
slider over the left field fence
for a three run homerun put
ting the game out of reach.
That three-run blast puts
Guardino, a three year return
ing letterman on the Cardinal
roster, in a tie with Bob
Hampton for the Stanford
career homerun record with a
total of 26. Coach Marquess
indicated his confidence in
Guardino's ability to continue
his offensive hot streak saying

"he's a cinch to hit another one
out sometime soon." Guar
dino agreed. "I feel pretty
good (about my hitting)," he
said. "I think I can keep it up."
That attitude, Marquess cal
led confidence, and he sees a
lot of it in the members of this
year's team.
About Wednesday's game
with hayward Marquess com
mented, "I thought we played
pretty well especially coming
from behind. The guys have a
lot of confidence and we battle
back well.'' He then added "we
still have a lot of improving to
do."
Alumni game
On Sunday, at noon, after
Pepperdine has returned
home, the Cardinals will play
host to a number of ex-
Stanford greats as the annual
Alumni Day festivities begin.
The old-timers (odd year
graduates vs. even year
graduates) will play three in
nings and then this year's Car
dinal 9 will take on those
alumni who are still in top
shape for a nine inning con
test.

Frank Duffy, Steve Davis —
1976 graduate and numerous
Stanford record holder, and
the most famous graduate off
the diamond — U.S. Con
gressman Pete McCloskey who
played for Stanford in the early
'50s. Also returning will be last
year's graduating seniors John
Yandle, Gary Pitchford and
others.
Monday, Stanford will meet
Santa Clara away from home
for a single game beginning at 1
p.m., and from there the team
will travel to Fresno for a Tues
day noon doubleheader.
Though the schedule looks a
little hectic, the team is looking
forward to the additional play
ing time. "The next six games
will be a good test for us," re
marked Marquess. The only
problem now is to get the
weather to cooperate.

Two Stanford volleyballers go up high for .1 bloc k in last night's game
against Santa Clara. The Cards nad more successful blocks than the
Broncos had spikes and Stanford won the contest in four games, 15-5
15-5, 17-19, 15-11.
In hopes of a fair-weather
Washington's, Birthday
weekend, the Stanford
baseball team sets out to add a
few more games to this, thus
far, rain-hindered preseason
activity. The team meets Pep
perdine, a southern California
club, in Stanford's Sunken
Diamond for a single game at
2:30 this afternoon and at noon
on Saturday for a doub
leheader.
Pepperdine, suffering from a
similar fate of a washed-out
preseason, comes to Stanford
in good standing after having
beaten USC 3-0 on
and tying with Cal Poly Pomonar
on Wednesday. Coach Mark
Marquess expects the visitors
to be a tough match, because
on top of several returnees
from last year's team, Pepper
dine had "one of the best re
cruiting years of anyone."
The Cardinals, meanwhile,
added a fourth win to their un
blemished record Wednesday
afternoon when they took a
second game away from Hay
ward State, 8-3. The impressive
Stanford pitching staff, this
time led by Joe LoPresti and
Larry Kuhn, allowed the
Pioneers only four hits in the
nine innings while Tom Guar
dino and Mike Codiroli paced
the Cards at the plate.
With the score tied at three
apiece in the bottom of the
sixth, and Cardinals Randy
Wong and Bruce Walters on
first and second, centerfielder
Larry Reynolds came to bat.
Reynolds singled and an error
on the Pioneer secondbase
man allowed Walters to score
giving Stanford its go-ahead
run. Designated hitter Tom
Guardino then stepped up to
the plate and clubbed an inside
slider over the left field fence
for a three run homerun put
ting the game out of reach.
That three-run blast puts
Guardino, a three year return
ing letterman on the Cardinal
roster, in a tie with Bob
Hampton for the Stanford
career homerun record with a
total of 26. Coach Marquess
indicated his confidence in
Guardino's ability to continue
his offensive hot streak saying

"he's a cinch to hit another one
out sometime soon." Guar
dino agreed. "I feel pretty
good (about my hitting)," he
said. "I think I can keep it up."
That attitude, Marquess cal
led confidence, and he sees a
lot of it in the members of this
year's team.
About Wednesday's game
with hayward Marquess com
mented, "I thought we played
pretty well especially coming
from behind. The guys have a
lot of confidence and we battle
back well.'' He then added "we
still have a lot of improving to
do."
Alumni game
On Sunday, at noon, after
Pepperdine has returned
home, the Cardinals will play
host to a number of ex-
Stanford greats as the annual
Alumni Day festivities begin.
The old-timers (odd year
graduates vs. even year
graduates) will play three in
nings and then this year's Car
dinal 9 will take on those
alumni who are still in top
shape for a nine inning con
test.
Returnees for the game in

the diamond — U.S. Con
gressman Pete McCloskey who
played for Stanford in the early
'50s. Also returning will be last
year's graduating seniors John
Yandle, Gary Pitchford and

Monday, Stanford will meet
