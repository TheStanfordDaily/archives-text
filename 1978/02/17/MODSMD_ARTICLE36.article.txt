No quick settlement in coal strike
Washington — Labor Secreatary Ray Marshall
said yesterday he hoped to gain an agreement by
today that would end the 73-day-old coal strike but
sources within his department indicated there was
no great optimism for such a quick settlement.
"We obviously don't have long," Marshall said
as he emerged from a 3'/*-hour bargaining session
at midday. "This thing can't go on." However,
Labor Department sources said the bargainers
"had a difficult morning."
Meanwhile, Energy Secretary James Schlesinger
told Congress the administration is prepared to
order coal moved to states hard hit by the strike if
the walkout isn't ended soon.
Schlesinger also said that between 6000 and 8000
megawatts of electricity a day already are being
moved to utilities in Midwestern states faced with
the severest coal shortages and that the govern
ment is studying ways to increase this flow.
Marshall told reporters he would keep bargain
ers for the striking United Mine Workers and the
soft-coal industry in session throughout the night
if necessary to meet his deadline.
Marshall declined to say what steps might be
taken if negotiators are unable to reach agreement
by today.
Meanwhile, President Jimmy Carter, who prod
ded the bargainers with a White House pep talk
Wednesday night, arranged to meet with gover
nors from a dozen states hardest hit by the increas
ingly disruptive strike.
The Commerce Department said the coal strike
already was affecting industrial production but
that it would be another month before it could
disrupt the economy.
State Dept. defends sale of jets
Washington — The Carter administration de
fended its proposed sale of top-quality jet planes
to Saudi Arabia yesterday while Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Dayan met here with Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance.
Dayan, the hero general of the 1%7 Mideast
war, is trying to get the decision on aircraft sales
reversed. He probably is fighting an uphill battle.
Dayan also is trying to offset Arab gains in U.S.
policy and with the American public.
Meanwhile, President jimmy Carter told Dayan
that the date of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin's visit to Washington will be March 14-15
and that the visit may be three days long.
In a 10-page memorandum, the State Depart
ment said that the sale of 60 F-15 Eagles to Saudi
Arabia is consistent with "the overriding objective
of a just and lasting peace" in the region.
"Saudi acquisition of 60 F-15s would not alter the
basic Middle East arms balance. The fundamental
inhibitions which have led Saudi Arabia to refrain
from combat with Israel in past conflicts would still
pertain."
Two-thirds of the Senate Foreign Relations

Committee is already on record opposing delivery
of the F-15s, possibly the best fighter plane in the
world.
Israeli collaborator assassinated
Ramallah, Occupied West Bank — The assassina
tion of one of this town's most powerful Arab
figures has aroused fears among Israeli occupa
tion forces that Arab guerrillas have decided to
strike at Israel through suspected collaborators.
Wealthy merchant Abdel-Nur Khalil Janhu, 55,
gunned down outside his shop, was the third Arab
connected with the occupying forces killed in
Ramallah the past two months.
He was known to work closely with the military
government, a serious crime under the unwritten
code of the Palestinian Liberation Organization.
Chowchilla kidnaper testifies
Oakland — In a dramatic surprise, Chowchilla
kidnaper James Schoenfeld took the stand yester
day and testified that safety for the 26 children and
their bus driver was a primary concern in what he
said was a good but crazy scheme.
Schoenfeld, speaking in a slow, calm, almost
sleepy voice, said the motive was to collect ransom
and he detailed the elaborate precautions taken to
ensure safety for the captives in the July 1976 ab
duction.
His testimony capped some 19 months of specu
lation on the thinking behind the mass abduction.
Court was to resume today with brief arguments
by attorneys and the judge hearing the case was
expected to impose sentence on Schoenfeld and
his fellow kidnapers.
Schoenfeld said enough food was placed in the
buried van in which the children and their bus
driver were buried to last at least a day. Additional
food was available for at least two more days, he
said.
Asked by his attorney, public defender Lester
Gendron, why the kidnaping was committed,
Schoenfeld replied: "To obtain ransom."
"I was hoping to develop some inventions I
thought of," he said. "Fuel economy. Medical.
Paraplegic. Lots of different things."
"Did you intend to hurt any of the children,"
Gendron asked.
"No, not at all," Schoenfeld responded.
"Are you sorry that you pulled this stupid
caper," Gendron asked.
"Yes," Schoenfeld replied softly.
American Airlines avoids strike
Washington — Bargainers for American Airlines
and the Transport Workers Union reached tenta
tive agreement on a new contract late last night,
averting a threatened 12:01 a.m. (EST) strike, an
airlines spokesman said.
The agreement, which still must be approved by
12,000 union members, came after day-long
negotiations.

American is the nation's second largest com
mercial air carrier, serving about 65,000 passen
gers a day.
State not told about cloud seeding
Sacramento — Los Angeles County did not tell
the state, as required by law, that it was seeding
clouds a few hours before a devastating storm
struck Los Angeles last week, a county official said
yesterday.
C.F. Eshelby, a Los Angeles County flood con
trol district division engineer, said he had found
out that no one in his office mailed the state the
required notification letter before the seedingone
week ago.
Eshelby made that determination after Gov.
Jerry Brown's Water Resources Department Wed
nesday contacted the firm doing cloud seeding
work for the county to ask about the notification.
Eshelby said it was "inconceivable" that the
cloud seeding done Feb. 9 was connected with the
intensity of the storm that broke late that evening
because of the timing and location of the seeding
effort, which sent invisible plumes of silver iodide
into the atmosphere from generators on the
ground.
Scientist wants defense boosted
Washington — The Pentagon's top scientist yes
terday proposed a spending boost to push de
velopment of new weapons that could destroy
attacking missiles and hostile enemy satellites with
highly concentrated light beams.
William Perry, Defense Department research
chief, said the Russians are making a major de
velopment effort but that "overall, we believe the
U.S. and the U.S.S.R. high energy laser programs
are roughly equal at the present time."
Alaskan oil flows again after spill
Fairbanks — Sabotage produced the biggest oil
spill in the short history of the trans-Alaska
pipeline and forced a day-long shutdown, but oil
began flowing again yesterday and tanker ship
ments to the lower 48 states were not interrupted.
Alaska State Troopers said they had no suspects
and did not know what kind of explosive had been
used when a 2-inch hole was blasted in the
pipeline Wednesday afternoon.
