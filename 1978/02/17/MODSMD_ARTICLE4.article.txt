# 'The Ends of Power'
## Haldeman expose on Nixon published 
### 
New York (AP) — Richard Nixon's No. 1 White
House aide says the formerpresident was thedriv
ing force behind the Watergate break-in and then
threatened to embarrass the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) if it refused to participate in the
cover-up.
In a new book, "The Ends of Power," H.R.
Haldeman suggests Nixon and former aide
Charles Colson pushed for the break-in at Democ
ratic Party headquarters to obtain inside informa
tion about chairman Lawrence O'Brien, whom
they suspected was on the payroll of industrialist
Howard Hughes.
He writes that Nixon "sometimes seemed to
lose touch with reality" on matters pertaining to
Hughes.
Haldeman also writes that he believes the CIA
monitored the Watergate burglary throughout
"with 'plants' to keep it under control"; that the
break-in was deliberately sabotaged; and that the
saboteur may have been lames McCord |r., a re
tired long-time CIA agent who was among the
burglars who were caught red-handed inside
Democratic Party headquarters.
Haldeman hints that Nixon may have been
blackmailed later by Colson.
"Nixon didn't know that Colson was taping all of

his telephone calls with Nixon before and after
Watergate happened. He's got on tape just what
Nixon said all through the whole Watergate
mess," Haldeman said he was told by Kenneth
Clawson, a member of the White House publicity
staff.
Haldeman also suggests that Nixon may have
directly ordered the 1971 burglary of the office of
the psychiatrist who had been treating Pentagon
Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg, something the
former president always denied.
The book, finished in prison, is a devastating
portrayal of the nation's 37th president by the man
who was never far from his side in his first term.
But nowhere in the book does Haldeman offer
proof of his allegations.
The former president's reaction to the sensa
tional charges was contained in a one-sentence
statement issued by his office in San Clemente.
"Former President Nixon's memoirs will be pub
lished in May."
Nixon aides refused to return telephone calls.
The book was not due in stores until Feb. 27, but
excerpts were sold to newspapers for publication
next week. Newsweek magazine paid about
$125,000 for 30,000 words to be printed in its next

two issues.
Despite extreme efforts by the publisher, Times
Books, to prevent leaks, the Washington Post car
ried an extensive account in Thursday's edition. It
was based, the Post said, on two-thirds of the
book.
"I believe the initiative for the Watergate break
in came from Nixon through Colson," Haldeman
writes. "Nixon lit the match, handed it to Colson,
who in turn touched off the fuse."
He says Nixon "was in on the cover-up from Day
One, although neither he nor we considered it a
cover-up at the time."
Haldeman says Nixon talked of paying hush
money to the Watergate burglars and using the
CIA to sidetrack the ongoing FBI investigation
three days after the |une 17, 1972, burglary. That,
in turn, was three days before the "smoking gun'
conversation which, when released by the White
House, preceded Nixon's resignation.
"When you get the CIA people in, say Took, the
problem is that this will open up the whole Bay of
Pigs thing again,' " Haldeman quotes Nixon as
saying. "So they should call the FBI in and say for
the good of the country don't go any further into
the case. Period."

New York (AP) — Richard Nixon's No. 1 White
House aide says the formerpresident was thedriv
ing force behind the Watergate break-in and then
threatened to embarrass the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) if it refused to participate in the
cover-up.
In a new book, "The Ends of Power," H.R.
Haldeman suggests Nixon and former aide
Charles Colson pushed for the break-in at Democ
ratic Party headquarters to obtain inside informa
tion about chairman Lawrence O'Brien, whom
they suspected was on the payroll of industrialist
Howard Hughes.
He writes that Nixon "sometimes seemed to
lose touch with reality" on matters pertaining to
Hughes.
Haldeman also writes that he believes the CIA
monitored the Watergate burglary throughout
"with 'plants' to keep it under control"; that the
break-in was deliberately sabotaged; and that the
saboteur may have been lames McCord |r., a re
tired long-time CIA agent who was among the
burglars who were caught red-handed inside
Democratic Party headquarters.
Haldeman hints that Nixon may have been
blackmailed later by Colson.
"Nixon didn't know that Colson was taping all of

his telephone calls with Nixon before and after
Watergate happened. He's got on tape just what
Nixon said all through the whole Watergate
mess," Haldeman said he was told by Kenneth
Clawson, a member of the White House publicity
staff.
Haldeman also suggests that Nixon may have
directly ordered the 1971 burglary of the office of
the psychiatrist who had been treating Pentagon
Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg, something the
former president always denied.
The book, finished in prison, is a devastating
portrayal of the nation's 37th president by the man
who was never far from his side in his first term.
But nowhere in the book does Haldeman offer
proof of his allegations.
The former president's reaction to the sensa
tional charges was contained in a one-sentence
statement issued by his office in San Clemente.
"Former President Nixon's memoirs will be pub
lished in May."
Nixon aides refused to return telephone calls.
The book was not due in stores until Feb. 27, but
excerpts were sold to newspapers for publication
next week. Newsweek magazine paid about
$125,000 for 30,000 words to be printed in its next

two issues.
Despite extreme efforts by the publisher, Times
Books, to prevent leaks, the Washington Post car
ried an extensive account in Thursday's edition. It
was based, the Post said, on two-thirds of the
book.
"I believe the initiative for the Watergate break
in came from Nixon through Colson," Haldeman
writes. "Nixon lit the match, handed it to Colson,
who in turn touched off the fuse."
He says Nixon "was in on the cover-up from Day
One, although neither he nor we considered it a
cover-up at the time."
Haldeman says Nixon talked of paying hush
money to the Watergate burglars and using the
CIA to sidetrack the ongoing FBI investigation
three days after the |une 17, 1972, burglary. That,
in turn, was three days before the "smoking gun'
conversation which, when released by the White
House, preceded Nixon's resignation.
"When you get the CIA people in, say Took, the
problem is that this will open up the whole Bay of
Pigs thing again,' " Haldeman quotes Nixon as
saying. "So they should call the FBI in and say for
the good of the country don't go any further into
the case. Period."
