# Improving education
## Academic structure lacking 
### 
Patrick Flinn

Among all the problems of under
graduate education that have been
identified in the recent past, none
seems to have had more suggestions
for solutions posed than the problem
of structure and coherence in the
courses taken by undergraduates at
the University.
The problem seems to have been
ignored now in the helter-skelter
search for the answer. At this point, I
think it is important to once again
raise a few questions about the need
for structure, to see if the answers
are really solving the problem. Why
is it, first, that the undergraduate
curriculum should be structured? Is
it really true that undergraduates are
takinga hodge-podge of courses that
make no intellectual sense? If the
above is true, what is the best way of
solving the problem, given the na
ture of the student body and the
courses already offered?
Should make sense
Addressing the first of these ques
tions, it does seem true that the
academic program should make
sense. Most academic work involves
applying knowledge and skills
learned elsewhere. Students facing
increasing competition for places in
graduate and professional schools
are finding out the need for a well
ordered and intelligent study list.
This does not imply, however, that
there is a strict limit on the ways in
which a program might be struc
tured.
There seem to be an infinite
number of ways to construct a sequ
ence of courses; the fact that the
University must update the Courses
and Degrees book each year (and still
it is outdated when it comes out) tes
tifies that Stanford is interested in a

flexible, dynamic curriculum that al
lows it to keep pace with the frontiers
of learning (as best it can). The rec
ognition that education is ultimately
a diverse entity seems to be already
made.
However, are there constant stan
dards, fundamentals that educated
persons need to know before they
can communicate with each other? I
believe there are, but I also believe
that they must respond to the chang
ing nature of society in general and
intellectual activity in particular.
What made a person "educated" 20
years ago would differ from what is
"educated" today.
The point is that the goal of adding
structure and coherence to the
academic is not synonymous with
making the college program the
same as it was at Harvard in 1950. The
perception that the "good old days"
are good enough to revive to be
come the Stanford of 1980 colors
much of what is being said about this
problem. It is true that structure is an
important part of picking courses,
but the definition of structure should
not be confused with nostalgia.
The second question involves the
average student's lack of clarity and
direction in picking courses. There is
a feeling among many people here
that this average student is lacking in
the areas of structure and coher
ence. To try to typify this average
student will probably lead both to
the wrath of the Dean of Admissions
and to error. It is even harder to tell
what this average student is doing
than it is to say who he or she is.
There appears to be a desire to
make the student body uniform in
some way, that there should be a
commonality of intellectual activity.

This desire is evident both in the per
ception of the problem and in the
intentions behind some suggested
solutions.
This desire, I believe, runs counter
to the attempt to seek a diverse stu
dent body and ultimately would be
harmful to the curriculum. This
should not be taken as an argument
that no coherence is possible.
Rather, it means that flexibility bet
ween individuals is necessary. What
is coherence for one person is coer
sion for another.
There is, however, a disturbing
problem for those freshmen and
sophomores who find themselves
lost in the maze of Courses and De
grees, and the University ought to
(and is attempting) to solve it. The
University's track record to this point
however, is somewhat indicative of a
renewal of the tired old forms and
does little in the way of adapting to
the changing patterns in education.
The solutions that are the easiest to
mandate are bureaucratic ones. The
recent experience with the
humanities sequence requirement
should be taken as a warning that the
easiest ways are not the best.
Moreover, by thei- very nature,
bureaucratic mandates cannot help
but ignore both the dynamic nature
of the institution and the great indi
vidual difference found between
students.
The answer lies elsewhere. It can
be found in strengthening the advis
ing program, and using it to guide
students towards more meaningful
academic programs. The answer can
be found in inter-departmental
communication, where a whole net
work of interrelated courses can be
devised in the areas of foreign
studies, western culture, the history
of technology, and others.
The Faculty Senate has repeatedly
rejected attempts to restrict their
academic freedom by bureaucratic
structures. Perhaps the senate'might
realize that in the case of adding
some planning and meaning to a
Stanford education, these "doms
might also have some impo'tance.
