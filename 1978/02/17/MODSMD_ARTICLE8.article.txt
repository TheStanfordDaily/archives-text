# Affirmative action backed

Black people throughout the
country seem to be settling into a
lethargy, brought on by exhaustion,
resignation or indifference. It cannot
be reflective of contentment, be
cause although we have made large
strides in our attempts at equalizing
laws that seemingly were designed to
discriminate against us, these laws
are still not being enforced.
Were it not for affirmative action
programs, little would be done, it
seems. At this time in history, with all
the attempted strides toward bring
ing about world peace, it is unfortu
nate that black people in the United
States still cling to affirmative action
to do the job that can only be done

effectively by such a program. Laws
as written, supposedly for all people,
are not enough. Men in government
are encumbered by the fact that they
must be elected to their offices,
therefore having to reflect views and
demands of their constituency that
are not necessarily consistent with a
progressive view of equality for all
people.
Affirmative action must be pro
tected in every community, because
at this time it is all black people have
to insure some form of equality. Af
firmative action is now being chal
lenged by a middle-aged student
who has been rejected by several
leading universities, including his

former alma mater. This challenge is
an indication of a condition: that we
as black people still rely on some
thing short of equal law for all
people. That it continues to exist
demonstrates that constitutional law
is inadequate under the cir
cumstances.
The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored Peoples
(NAACP) seems to be one of the only
remaining strongholds that offers
challenge of the system by black
people. Whatever has been the posi
tion taken by the NAACP throughout
history, it seems less offensive to the
public than some of our other or
ganizations. Regardless of our per
sonal opinions of this organization, it
is. It does exist, and can be as power
ful or as archaic as we make it.
Black people should become ac
tive in the NAACP, if only to be aware
of legislative and legal alteration that
affects us. In a time of apparent
non-crisis, there is little news that
some of us receive that directly influ
ences our lives. Those of us living
away from campus environments or
the inner cities often miss out on
news familiar to blacks living in such
environments. That we no longer live
in such direct contact with the inner
cities does not lessen our concern or
responsibility to them. We must re
main involved and active for the sake
of our progress as a people.

seems. At this time in history, with all
the attempted strides toward bring
ing about world peace, it is unfortu
nate that black people in the United
States still cling to affirmative action
to do the job that can only be done

effectively by such a program. Laws
as written, supposedly for all people,
are not enough. Men in government
are encumbered by the fact that they
must be elected to their offices,
therefore having to reflect views and
demands of their constituency that
are not necessarily consistent with a
progressive view of equality for all
people.
Affirmative action must be pro
tected in every community, because
at this time it is all black people have
to insure some form of equality. Af
firmative action is now being chal
lenged by a middle-aged student
who has been rejected by several
leading universities, including his

former alma mater. This challenge is
an indication of a condition: that we
as black people still rely on some
thing short of equal law for all
people. That it continues to exist
demonstrates that constitutional law
is inadequate under the cir
cumstances.
The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored Peoples
(NAACP) seems to be one of the only
remaining strongholds that offers
challenge of the system by black
people. Whatever has been the posi
tion taken by the NAACP throughout
history, it seems less offensive to the
public than some of our other or
ganizations. Regardless of our per
sonal opinions of this organization, it
is. It does exist, and can be as power
ful or as archaic as we make it.
Black people should become ac
tive in the NAACP, if only to be aware
of legislative and legal alteration that
affects us. In a time of apparent
non-crisis, there is little news that
some of us receive that directly influ
ences our lives. Those of us living
away from campus environments or
the inner cities often miss out on
news familiar to blacks living in such
environments. That we no longer live
in such direct contact with the inner
cities does not lessen our concern or
responsibility to them. We must re
main involved and active for the sake
of our progress as a people.
