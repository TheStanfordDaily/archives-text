Real life here
Since Michael lennings was not speaking for ali stu
dents in his article "Anatomy of a dropout'' (Daily, Feb.
14), I 'd like to submit another purely personal view. I will
not try to match his rhetoric or respond to all of the
points he brought up.
I was saddened by lennings' long essay, especially
because I know he is not alone in feeling pressured,
unloved, out-competed and over-intellectualized here
â€” how many times has each of us heard the same com
plaints from our friends?
However, I think there is a point which a person can
not blame the University for his/her unhappiness. At
Stanford and in life, there are options open to us: we can

choose to compete or not, to "grovel in the dust. . . for
a few extra points on a lousy test" or not, to "anxiously
consult (our) scorecards" or not. I'm sure I'm not the
only one here who chose the "nots"; I studied poetry
because I loved poetry, did what I could on the tests, got
only a few As, had a great deal of fun with my books and
my friends.
There are a good many things here that can make one
miserable, but there are those of us who hate and refuse
to stay unhappy for very long. The point is, this is real
life, right here, and life is hard. In real life, any time we
spend bored, depressed, scared or lonely is our own
responsibility.
