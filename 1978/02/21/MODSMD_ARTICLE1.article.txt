# More overseas attention urged
## 
### Matt Mettler 
Stanford's Overseas Studies prog
ram should receive more emphasis
within the University, a new
student-faculty task force recom
mended last week.
The task force report called for
greater faculty participation, man
datory student orientation, broader
course offerings and increased in
tegration of overseas studies with
home academic departments and
curricula.
The task force was created last
spring by the ASSU Senate in re
sponse to student concern over the
closing of the Beutelsbach campus
and the threatened closure of the
Berlin program.
It was headed by Bernard Siegel,
professor of anthropology, and in
cluded six other faculty members
and five seniors who had been over
seas.
Indifferent faculty
The report cites the decrease in fa
culty participation in overseas in
struction, from 50 faculty quarters in
1971 to 15 this year, as one of the
main reasons "the overseas program
seems to have lost touch with, and
the support of, a greater portion of
the Stanford community."
The report said, "Many faculty
seem to be discouraged from apply
ing for a position at an overseas cam
pus because of a mistaken belief that
only courses specifically appropriate
to the particular foreign community
may be taught at an overseas cam
pus."
Mark Mancall, director of overseas
studies, said that he felt "the task
force s emphasis is wrong, the
reasons for the decreased faculty
participation are strictly financial.
"We have more applications from
faculty than we can possibly send,"
he said.
The report recommended increas

ing Stanford faculty participation to
decrease reliance on foreign faculty
and make it easier for students to
receive credit towards a major for
courses taught overseas.
"We don't have the resources to
do a regular search for a person to
teach one course overseas as we do
here, Mancall said. The academic
departments are given all the infor
mation the University has on foreign
faculty, Mancall said.
The report was initially written by
students on the committee, revised
by the committee as a whole and fi
nally edited by Lawrence Ryan,
chairman of the Humanities Special
Programs, said Anne Henkels, a stu
dent member of the committee.
Dollars talk
Henkels said that money was the
central issue and said that "the Fa
culty Senate is the most important
body in the University, and if they
were more interested in overseas
studies, priorities would be read
justed and more money could be
found.'
The overseas program was cut
back four years ago, Mancal!
explained. Budget cuts have reduced
student participation from 1750 stu
dent quarters to 950.
"We were not singled out
everyone in the University was cut
back," Mancall said.
At the present time "the onlv way
overseas studies can expand is b\
fund raising outside of the Univer
sity, Mancall said. The overseas
studies office is "actively planning
to solicit donations specifically for
the overseas program, Mancall ad
ded.
"However, all fund raising ac
tivities have to be approved by the
University," he said.
Essential program
The task force's report recom
mended that "the overseas studies

program should not be considered a
luxury, but an essential part of Stan
ford."
Mancall said he would like to see
more students go overseas and said
that overseas studies would be an
excellent way for students in science
and engineering to fultill their dis
tribution requirements.

spring. The fountain graces the head of the driveway at the
former Astor estate, now one of the University's most popu
lar overseas studies centers.
At present, 30 percent of incoming
freshmen eventually go overseas.
The Focus Program was another
issue raised by the report. This prog
ram was aimed at encouraging fa
culty here to coordinate the planning
of courses to be offered overseas to
form specific sequences, or groups
of courses around a particular
theme, Mancall said. The program
was not successful because students
didn t choose to take these courses,
he said.
The task force report asked the
Committee on Foreign Studies to
re-examine Focus Programs as an in
strument to balance academics with
the cultural experience overseas.
Mandatory student attendance at
tormal orientation sessions was also
recommended to "reduce misap
prehensions and unrealistic expecta
tion about overseas experiences.
Reasons for overseas programs
The report recognized three basic
reasons tor having the overseas
program.
First was the opportunity for re
search, field work and study tor fa
culty, graduate students and under
graduates. Second was the perspec
tive gained by living in another coun
try. Third was the importance of stu
dents having "a dear understanding
ot the realities and implications of
our transnational world.

The overseas program currently
operates campuses in England, Fr
ance, Germany, Austria, Italy and
Spain. The University is also sending
two students to a campus in Africa
associated with the University of
California in exchange for UC send
ing two students to Vienna, Mancall
said. A similar arrangement will send
two students to Peru.
If money were available, Mancall
said, he would like to see the present
campuses expanded. He said he
would also like to see the University
try to establish campuses in the Mid
dle and Ear East.

The overseas program currently
operates campuses in England, Fr

two students to a campus in Africa
associated with the University of

said. A similar arrangement will send
two students to Peru.

Stanford's Overseas Studies prog
ram should receive more emphasis
within the University, a new
student-faculty task force recom
mended last week.
The task force report called for
greater faculty participation, man
datory student orientation, broader
course offerings and increased in
tegration of overseas studies with
home academic departments and
curricula.
The task force was created last
spring by the ASSU Senate in re
sponse to student concern over the
closing of the Beutelsbach campus
and the threatened closure of the
Berlin program.
It was headed by Bernard Siegel,
professor of anthropology, and in
cluded six other faculty members
and five seniors who had been over
seas.
Indifferent faculty
The report cites the decrease in fa
culty participation in overseas in
struction, from 50 faculty quarters in
1971 to 15 this year, as one of the
main reasons "the overseas program
seems to have lost touch with, and
the support of, a greater portion of
the Stanford community."
The report said, "Many faculty
seem to be discouraged from apply
ing for a position at an overseas cam
pus because of a mistaken belief that
only courses specifically appropriate
to the particular foreign community
may be taught at an overseas cam
pus."
Mark Mancall, director of overseas
studies, said that he felt "the task
force s emphasis is wrong, the
reasons for the decreased faculty
participation are strictly financial.
"We have more applications from
faculty than we can possibly send,"
he said.
The report recommended increas

ing Stanford faculty participation to
decrease reliance on foreign faculty
and make it easier for students to
receive credit towards a major for
courses taught overseas.
"We don't have the resources to
do a regular search for a person to
teach one course overseas as we do
here, Mancall said. The academic
departments are given all the infor
mation the University has on foreign
faculty, Mancall said.
The report was initially written by
students on the committee, revised
by the committee as a whole and fi
nally edited by Lawrence Ryan,
chairman of the Humanities Special
Programs, said Anne Henkels, a stu
dent member of the committee.
Dollars talk
Henkels said that money was the
central issue and said that "the Fa
culty Senate is the most important
body in the University, and if they
were more interested in overseas
studies, priorities would be read
justed and more money could be
found.'
The overseas program was cut
back four years ago, Mancal!
explained. Budget cuts have reduced
student participation from 1750 stu
dent quarters to 950.
"We were not singled out
everyone in the University was cut
back," Mancall said.
At the present time "the onlv way
overseas studies can expand is b\
fund raising outside of the Univer
sity, Mancall said. The overseas
studies office is "actively planning
to solicit donations specifically for
the overseas program, Mancall ad
ded.
"However, all fund raising ac
tivities have to be approved by the
University," he said.
Essential program
The task force's report recom
mended that "the overseas studies

program should not be considered a
luxury, but an essential part of Stan
ford."
Mancall said he would like to see
more students go overseas and said
that overseas studies would be an
excellent way for students in science
and engineering to fultill their dis
tribution requirements.

spring. The fountain graces the head of the driveway at the
former Astor estate, now one of the University's most popu
lar overseas studies centers.
At present, 30 percent of incoming
freshmen eventually go overseas.
The Focus Program was another
issue raised by the report. This prog
ram was aimed at encouraging fa
culty here to coordinate the planning
of courses to be offered overseas to
form specific sequences, or groups
of courses around a particular
theme, Mancall said. The program
was not successful because students
didn t choose to take these courses,
he said.
The task force report asked the
Committee on Foreign Studies to
re-examine Focus Programs as an in
strument to balance academics with
the cultural experience overseas.
Mandatory student attendance at
tormal orientation sessions was also
recommended to "reduce misap
prehensions and unrealistic expecta
tion about overseas experiences.
Reasons for overseas programs
The report recognized three basic
reasons tor having the overseas
program.
First was the opportunity for re
search, field work and study tor fa
culty, graduate students and under
graduates. Second was the perspec
tive gained by living in another coun
try. Third was the importance of stu

of courses to be offered overseas to
form specific sequences, or groups
of courses around a particular
theme, Mancall said. The program
was not successful because students
didn t choose to take these courses,
he said.
The task force report asked the
Committee on Foreign Studies to
re-examine Focus Programs as an in
strument to balance academics with
the cultural experience overseas.
Mandatory student attendance at
tormal orientation sessions was also
recommended to "reduce misap
prehensions and unrealistic expecta
tion about overseas experiences.
Reasons for overseas programs
The report recognized three basic
reasons tor having the overseas
program.
First was the opportunity for re
search, field work and study tor fa
culty, graduate students and under
graduates. Second was the perspec
tive gained by living in another coun
try. Third was the importance of stu
dents having "a dear understanding
ot the realities and implications of
our transnational world.

The overseas program currently
operates campuses in England, Fr
ance, Germany, Austria, Italy and
Spain. The University is also sending
two students to a campus in Africa
associated with the University of
California in exchange for UC send
ing two students to Vienna, Mancall
said. A similar arrangement will send
two students to Peru.
If money were available, Mancall
said, he would like to see the present
campuses expanded. He said he
would also like to see the University
try to establish campuses in the Mid
dle and Ear East.
Stanford's Overseas Studies prog
ram should receive more emphasis
within the University, a new
student-faculty task force recom
mended last week.
The task force report called for
greater faculty participation, man
datory student orientation, broader
course offerings and increased in
tegration of overseas studies with
home academic departments and
curricula.
The task force was created last
spring by the ASSU Senate in re
sponse to student concern over the
closing of the Beutelsbach campus
and the threatened closure of the
Berlin program.
It was headed by Bernard Siegel,
professor of anthropology, and in
cluded six other faculty members
and five seniors who had been over
seas.
Indifferent faculty
The report cites the decrease in fa
culty participation in overseas in
struction, from 50 faculty quarters in
1971 to 15 this year, as one of the
main reasons "the overseas program
seems to have lost touch with, and
the support of, a greater portion of
the Stanford community."
The report said, "Many faculty
seem to be discouraged from apply
ing for a position at an overseas cam
pus because of a mistaken belief that
only courses specifically appropriate
to the particular foreign community
may be taught at an overseas cam
pus."
Mark Mancall, director of overseas
studies, said that he felt "the task
force s emphasis is wrong, the
reasons for the decreased faculty
participation are strictly financial.
"We have more applications from
faculty than we can possibly send,"
he said.
The report recommended increas

ing Stanford faculty participation to
decrease reliance on foreign faculty
and make it easier for students to
receive credit towards a major for
courses taught overseas.
"We don't have the resources to
do a regular search for a person to
teach one course overseas as we do
here, Mancall said. The academic
departments are given all the infor
mation the University has on foreign
faculty, Mancall said.
The report was initially written by
students on the committee, revised
by the committee as a whole and fi
nally edited by Lawrence Ryan,
chairman of the Humanities Special
Programs, said Anne Henkels, a stu
dent member of the committee.
Dollars talk
Henkels said that money was the
central issue and said that "the Fa
culty Senate is the most important
body in the University, and if they
were more interested in overseas
studies, priorities would be read
justed and more money could be
found.'
The overseas program was cut
back four years ago, Mancal!
explained. Budget cuts have reduced
student participation from 1750 stu
dent quarters to 950.
"We were not singled out
everyone in the University was cut
back," Mancall said.
At the present time "the onlv way
overseas studies can expand is b\
fund raising outside of the Univer
sity, Mancall said. The overseas
studies office is "actively planning
to solicit donations specifically for
the overseas program, Mancall ad
ded.
"However, all fund raising ac
tivities have to be approved by the
University," he said.
Essential program
The task force's report recom
mended that "the overseas studies

program should not be considered a
luxury, but an essential part of Stan
ford."
Mancall said he would like to see
more students go overseas and said
that overseas studies would be an
excellent way for students in science
and engineering to fultill their dis
tribution requirements.

spring. The fountain graces the head of the driveway at the
former Astor estate, now one of the University's most popu
lar overseas studies centers.
At present, 30 percent of incoming
freshmen eventually go overseas.
The Focus Program was another
issue raised by the report. This prog
ram was aimed at encouraging fa
culty here to coordinate the planning
of courses to be offered overseas to
form specific sequences, or groups
of courses around a particular
theme, Mancall said. The program
was not successful because students
didn t choose to take these courses,
he said.
