Trustees concerned
I would like to comment briefly on
Rob Lempert's story reporting my
appearance on KZSU's Campus Con
ference (Daily, Feb. 15). For a
change, I do not want to complain
about being misquoted, but only to
amplify the context of one of my
comments.
I am quoted as saying "The trus
tees think about the ASSU even less
than I do." That is, of course, no
more than a statement of fact about
my own responsibilities and about a
group of people who have only li
mited time to deal with a large

agenda of University issues.
I did not intend to suggest, how
ever, that the trustees are uncon
cerned about student government
and its proper place in the Univer
sity. Indeed, considering the limita
tions on their time, the Board spends
a surprisingly large proportion of it
with student government leaders
and confronting issues that those
leaders bring to the Board's meet
ings.
