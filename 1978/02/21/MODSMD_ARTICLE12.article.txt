# The 						life of a Playboy photographer
## Lots of women at every campus 
### David Ansley 
One day last fall, David Chan
checked into a motel in
Pullman, Wash. About 150
women from Washington State
University visited him in one
week.
When Chan was in Seattle,
80 University of Washington
coeds stopped by.
This week he's in Palo Alto,
and Chan expects to see scores
of Stanford women seeking to
become one of Playboy's

"Women of the Pac-8."
Hardly a Playboy himself
("I'm 5-foot-5, I don't drink or
smoke and I drive a '57 Thun
derbird"), Chan has been tour
ing Pacific-8 conference
schools for the magazine, in
terviewing and photographing
women for a pictorial to be
published in September.
One week only
In a room at the Holiday Inn,
Chan will only be interviewing
this week. "I have them bring
in a snapshot — if they don't
have one, I shoot a Polaroid —
and have them fill out a small
form. Name, address, statis
tics, what they're majoring in,
hobbies, sports. That's all
we're interested in now."
As many as half a dozen
women will then be chosen by
Playboy editors, and Chan will
visit again in April to photo
graph them.
"For the picture of each that
we print in the magazine, we
pay $100 for a fashion clothing
type, $200 for a semi-nude and
$300 for a nude."
Qualities
What qualities is he seeking?
"The eyes come first; they
attract me. I look for nice,
sparkling, laughing eyes. After

that, the nose and lips — sen
suous or slightly coquettish.
They have to have a good face
— the rest I can work with."
His first impression of
women here was that "they
look very chic; like they came
out of Glamour or
Mademoiselle. They might not
need much grooming."
He says that most of the
women that answer Playboy's
call for college models "are
people that take art, drama and
dancing. I've also interviewed

a lot of sorority women, nurs
ing students and gymnasts."
Amazing response
Last week he sought UC-
Berkeley women. He was
amazed at the response.
"In the first three hours after
the newspaper ad was out, I
got 35 phone calls."
Chan prefers to photograph
college-age women, "because

'They have to have
a good face — the
rest I can work with/

women are in full bloom physi
cally when they're 18 to 20.
Their inner beauty doesn't
come out until they're 30. For
example, Mona Lisa is a physi
cal beauty, but she might be a
bitch."
Eyes open
Chan is also keeping his eyes
open for Playboy's 25th
anniversary Playmate, who will
earn $25,000. "Maybe she can
use the money for her docto
rate."
A Playboy photographer for

13 years, Chan says "women
libbers" have accused him of
"almost everything."
"At certain schools, they
don't like me. In Minneapolis,
agroup of women came up and
threatened to picket my hotel.
They brought lots of publicity,
for them and for me."
He says he doesn't think
nude photography and wo
men's liberation are incompat
ible.
"A liberated woman is one
who is having fun and doing
what she wants. She might
come and see me and decide
she doesn't want to be photo
graphed; that's using her own
mind; that's liberated. That's
why I think what I'm doing is
right.
"Those who disagree with
me have a right to their own
way of thinking. But I think the
reason people don't like nude
photography is that it's too
real. I like to capture the
truth-beauty of a woman.
"I'm looking for the woman
next door who knows what it's
all about."

Their inner beauty doesn't
come out until they're 30. For
example, Mona Lisa is a physi
cal beauty, but she might be a
bitch."
Eyes open
Chan is also keeping his eyes
open for Playboy's 25th
anniversary Playmate, who will
earn $25,000. "Maybe she can
use the money for her docto
rate."
A Playboy photographer for

13 years, Chan says "women
libbers" have accused him of
"almost everything."
"At certain schools, they
don't like me. In Minneapolis,
agroup of women came up and
threatened to picket my hotel.
They brought lots of publicity,
for them and for me."
He says he doesn't think
nude photography and wo
men's liberation are incompat
ible.
"A liberated woman is one
who is having fun and doing
what she wants. She might
come and see me and decide
she doesn't want to be photo
graphed; that's using her own
mind; that's liberated. That's
why I think what I'm doing is
right.
"Those who disagree with
me have a right to their own
way of thinking. But I think the
reason people don't like nude
photography is that it's too
real. I like to capture the
truth-beauty of a woman.
"I'm looking for the woman
next door who knows what it's
all about."


David Chan
One day last fall, David Chan
checked into a motel in
Pullman, Wash. About 150
women from Washington State
University visited him in one
week.
When Chan was in Seattle,
80 University of Washington
coeds stopped by.
This week he's in Palo Alto,
and Chan expects to see scores
of Stanford women seeking to
become one of Playboy's

"Women of the Pac-8."
Hardly a Playboy himself
("I'm 5-foot-5, I don't drink or
smoke and I drive a '57 Thun
derbird"), Chan has been tour
ing Pacific-8 conference
schools for the magazine, in
terviewing and photographing
women for a pictorial to be
published in September.
One week only
In a room at the Holiday Inn,
Chan will only be interviewing
this week. "I have them bring
in a snapshot — if they don't
have one, I shoot a Polaroid —
and have them fill out a small
form. Name, address, statis
tics, what they're majoring in,
hobbies, sports. That's all
we're interested in now."
As many as half a dozen
women will then be chosen by
Playboy editors, and Chan will
visit again in April to photo
graph them.
"For the picture of each that
we print in the magazine, we
pay $100 for a fashion clothing
type, $200 for a semi-nude and
$300 for a nude."
Qualities
What qualities is he seeking?
"The eyes come first; they
attract me. I look for nice,
sparkling, laughing eyes. After

that, the nose and lips — sen
suous or slightly coquettish.
They have to have a good face
— the rest I can work with."
His first impression of
women here was that "they
look very chic; like they came
out of Glamour or
Mademoiselle. They might not
need much grooming."
He says that most of the
women that answer Playboy's
call for college models "are
people that take art, drama and
dancing. I've also interviewed

a lot of sorority women, nurs
ing students and gymnasts."
Amazing response
Last week he sought UC-
Berkeley women. He was
amazed at the response.
"In the first three hours after
the newspaper ad was out, I
got 35 phone calls."
Chan prefers to photograph
college-age women, "because

'They have to have
a good face — the
rest I can work with/

women are in full bloom physi
cally when they're 18 to 20.
Their inner beauty doesn't
come out until they're 30. For
