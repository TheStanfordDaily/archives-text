# Public brainwashing charged
## Daley regime defended 
### Jonathan Slater 
At an informal gathering of students and fa
culty Thursday evening, Illinois State Represen
tative Benedict Garmisa sharply criticized both
the Chicago media and Federal authorities for
their unjustified interference in the Daley ad
ministration.
Garmisa (D-Cook County) accused the media
of "trying to take over power for themselves" by
"painting it (the Cook County Democratic Or
ganization) as a machine — as no good and
corrupt." The effect of these efforts has been
that "the media has got the public brainwashed
to the point that anyone in public service is
considered on the take."
He also expressed dissatisfaction in attempts
by Federal prosecutors to indict public officials
connected with the 'Daley Machine.' "What has
been going on in the city of Chicago, in most
incidents were judicial lynchings," charged
Garmisa.
On the same subject, Garmisa indicated a
problem in the judicial system itself. "Thewhole
legal system certainly needs questioning. I think
that the federal government in its prosecutorial
system has overstepped its bounds."
Despite these distractions, Garmisa em
phasized the effectiveness of the Daley ad

ministration, and the contributions of a man
who "loved the city and wanted to see it prog
ress in every way, shape and form."
Like any major metropolitan city, Garmisa
said, Chicago is plagued by many problems,
such as decrepit residential-slum areas. Yet, he
said cooperation between the city, educational
institutions and business has served to rejuvi
nate many of these neighborhoods.
Garmisa further attributed the continuous
economic and financial stability of the city to
Daley's policies.
Specifically, he regarded the "fiscal conser
vatism" practiced by Daley as largely responsi
ble for the city's consistently healthy condition.
He also cited positive community relations as a
significant feature of Daley politics.
"One of the main reasons for the strength of
the city is because of the marriage we have bet
ween our business and political set-up in
Chicago," he added.
Garmisa outlined an elaborate "patronage
system" which serves as a fundamental part of
the Cook County Democratic Organization. Ac
cording to this system, a "patron" receives and
maintains a city job in return for political ser
vices rendered in his community on behalf of
the Democratic party.
