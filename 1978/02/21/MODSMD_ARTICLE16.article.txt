# White House defends Jordan's activities

### 
Washington (AP) — The White House
released 33 pages of statements yester
day to counter a story in a newspaper
gossip column that said Hamilton Jor
dan, President Jimmy Carter s chief
aide, spat a drink down the front of a
young woman's blouse in a
Washington singles bar.
The Washington Post reported Sun
day that two witnesses told reporter
Rudy Maxa that on the night of jan. 27,
Jordan and two friends tried to strike up
conversation with the woman at
Sarsfield s bar. It said Jordan intro
duced himself as "Harvey Phillips.
In the course of the conversation, the
Post said, Jordan wrote the woman a
dirty limerick and rubbed the small of
her back until her repeated efforts to
remove his hands finally discouraged
him.
When he failed to distract her from a
conversation with another man, the
newspaper said, "Jordan filled his
mouth with his drink and spewed it
down the front of her blouse.
White House Press Secretary Jody
Powell said that when he heard last Fri

day that the Post had prepared the
story, an assistant to White House
counsel Robert Lipshutz was dis
patched to talk with several witnesses,
including the bartender at Sarsfield s
who served Jordan.
Daniel Marshall 111, the bartender,
gave Lipshutz aide Mike Cardozo a 24-
page, signed statement. In it, Marshall
said:
"There was no spitting of drinks or
throwing of drinks or anything. ...
"The girls were overbearing and
everybody had a few drinks and I think
that he (Jordan) made it obvious that he
didn t want to talk to them anymore.
"The article says he was trying to
strike up a conversation,' Marshall
said. "This is totally wrong, because the
girls came up and said, 'Aren't you
Hamilton Jordan?' I was right there.
This was when they first sat down. That
should answer the 'Harvey Phillips'
thing.
"I saw him do nothing," said Mar
shall, who told Cardozo he spent most
of the more than an hour Jordan was in
the bar standing in front of the White

House aide. "I saw him trying to be as
polite as he could with as many women
as he could. He was pretty much being
besieged by young ladies."
Reporter Maxa said in a telephone
interview that he "absolutely stood by
the story. He said he interviewed three
sources for it and "all said the barten
der was nowhere near the incident.
Maxa said the woman at the center of
the alleged incident, whom he would
not name, told him she would not hesi
tate, if called into court because of the
allegations, to look Jordan "in the face
and call him a liar."
Jordan issued a statement that said "I
did not say or do anything that night to
any woman that was improper, and I
categorically deny that I spat my drink
on anyone.
"I did have an unpleasant encounter
with a woman at the bar, but it was not
precipitated by me or anything that I
had done, he said.
John Golden, a friend of lordan who
said he spent the evening with the
White House aide at the bar after they
attended a birthday party, said: "In my

opinion, Hamilton conducted himself
in a gentlemanly manner throughout
the evening.
"I at no time saw Mr. Jordan put his
hands on anybody — this woman or any
other woman. He was on good be
havior that night, said Golden.
The questions about )ordan s be
havior in the bar are not the tirst raised
about his social activities in
Washington.
At a party on Dec. 19, he reportedly
turned to Mrs. Ashraf Chorbal, the wife
of Egypt s ambassador to the United
States, tugged at the neckline of her
dress, looking down it and said some
thing about "always wanting to see the
twin pyramids of the Nile.
Later, according to a guest at the
party, he headed to the bathroom, say
ing "This administration has to take a
Jordan denied that the incident took
place, and Chorbal said she didn t re
member hearing him make such com
ments.
Jordan and his wife announced re
cently that they have separated.
