# 'Traditional marriage' still ranks above egalitarianism
## 
### Helen Nissenbaum 
Despite apparent sex role
changes, the pattern of "tradi
tional marriages, does not
seem to be giving way to true
egalitarianism, said Anne Pep
lau here last Wednesday.
Peplau, whose visit to the
University is sponsored by
Shell, is an assistant professor
of psychology at UCLA.
Referring to the characters

tics of specific males in wo
men's lives, and their general
assumptions about roles in
marriage, Peplau disi ussed the
"interpersonal barriers which
are "keeping women from
reaching heights in their
careers.
Peplau, whose special tield is
interpersonal relationships
and love, cited "the modern
pattern as predominating in
most marriages in the U.S.
In this pattern, a woman may
work only "if its defined as
secondary to the family, said
Peplau.
There are four restrictive
components to this pattern:
First is the "sex typing of oc
cupations ;
Second is a pervasive belief
in the "norm ot male superior
ity.
Thirdly, it is accepted that
"the woman s work must not
alter . . her obligations to the
family.
Finally, women making
career plans are constantly
"trying to juggle three goals

simultaneously â€” career, fam
ily, marriage, said Peplau.
Short training required
1 he problems of this pattern
for women s careers is that
they are often prevented from
undertaking careers which re
quire long training periods,
said Peplau.
Thou g h most male and
female students endorse the
idea of working women, they
seem committed to the "mod
ern pattern. However, where
a temale student is a "role in
novator a major factor behind
this is a "tolerant boyfriend,
with a "broader definition of
feminity, Peplau reported.
Peplau said that true equality
can only be achieved when
spouses share the responsibil
ity ot housework and childrear
ing and acknowledge the im
portance ot the woman s
career.
The talk was one in a regular
Wednesday noon series enti
tled "Women Working for
Pay sponsored by the Center
tor Research on Women.
