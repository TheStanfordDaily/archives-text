# Fake I.D. racketeers, owners disclose their practices
## 
### Jon Hornsby 
Are you underaged and
lonely? sober and blue? Well,
with a little time and initiative
plus $7 and a mild case of
paranoia, your problems can
be solved.
You could be the twenty-first
on your block to get a fake I.D.
card and have liquor stores,
bars and discos open their
doors for you, but you won't
be the firsts.
Many students on campus
can tell you stories of their suc
cess with the phony I.D.
Through a myriad of clever
schemes, they have borrowed,

lied, stolen, connived, forged,
chalked, or carved their passes
to the liquor store.
Out of 65 freshpersons sur
veyed, one-fifth said they had
bogus I.D.'s. Limiting the sam
ple to males, the fraction rose
to one-half.
And half of those replying
negative would add "unfortu
nately not," "no, I wish I did,"
or "not yet."
"Over half my high school
class had one," said one Bran
ner resident. "Here it's back
wards. It's depressing.'' How
ever, most people were sur
prised at the high percentage

of males with fakes.
"The most common type are
the altered driver's licenses
where a zip code number has
been cut out and switched to
the date of birth,' said Steve
Creer, bartender at Fargo's
Pizza Factory in Mountain View
(they serve beer). "I'd say that
on the average night we have
four out of ten people present
bad I.D.'s," he added.
Joe Adriano, bouncer at
Bourbon Street disco in Moun
tain View said the most com
mon ones were "the laminated
'I.D. Cards' with a star on the
right where the California seal
should be."
"The best ones are when
they change the '58 into a '53
for the birth year," Adriano
added "We get 10 or 12 altered
I.D.'s on a weekend night."
Change digits
Students born in '59 said
they just cut out the nine and
turn it upside down so it reads
'56. Others chalk out digits and
write in new ones. Some
teenagers often get temporary
or duplicate drivers licenses
under an older brother's or sis
ter's name.
"The guys who have bor
rowed their big brother's
license are really tough to
catch," said the bouncer at
Jumping Frog discotheque.
One student who didn t go
for such petty and unsure
methods, recommended a
forgery operation in Berkeley
that makes false birth certifi
cates. He said he found out
about it from a Hell's Angel at a
party.
Daily ad
"Did you see that ad in the
Daily for a fake 1.D." one stu
dent asked me. "I can t believe
someone would have the gall
to do that! What is the world
coming to?"

I placed that ad two weeks
ago and have received eight
phone calls so far. Three
people told me of bogus I.D.
operations around campus,
and five people wanted to
know what the others had said.
I talked to one entrepreneur,
a product design major, who
shut down his racket last year.
With the help of frat brothers,
he laid out a 4 by 3 foot poster
board to resemble an out of
state driver's license.
Perfect replica
There was an open square in
the corner for customers to
place their head — like those
carnival pop-ip backdrops. A
polaroid picture cut to scale
provided a near perfect glossy
replica for a small fee.
"It started as a birthday pro
ject for me and my room
mate," said the designer.
"Twelve hours later we had 30
people up here. And in a
couple days, people were com
ing from all over campus. They
were getting excited and run
ning down to the store for
more film. It just got out of
hand."
After making about 30 cards
in three days, the racketeer
burned the board. "It was very
satisfying to destroy the mons
ter I had created," he said.
Fool proof
"They worked 100 per cent
of the time — even against I.D.
catalogues at liquor stores. But
we stopped because if we
flooded the market, they d be
useless," he added.
Another student paid his
house bill last year with money
from a similar enterprise. Now
a professional graphic artist, he
made over 100 I.D.'s in a year
and a half charging $10 a card.
He said he stopped because no
more of his friends needed a
fake I.D.

The mastermind of a current
operation said he has received
over 60 calls in the last two
weeks. But he is curtailing bus
iness so as not to flood the
market.
Expensive
"They're expensive to
make," he said. (He charges
$7.) Besides the film and "let
raset" costs, he said he risks
getting caught.
Lance Beizer, deputy district
attorney in Santa Clara County
said bogus I.D.'s may be wide
spread, but he hasn't come ac
ross many.
"In my experience, out of
about 500 drunk drivers a
month, four or five illegal I.D.'s
have been found. And it's usu
ally some kid who used it to
buy liquor illegally and
couldn't hold his booze,'' said
Beizer.
Beizer recognized the extent
of spurious I.D. use and said "I
even did it as a kid ... in
another state of course."
Misdemeanor
He said it is a misdemeanor
punishable by a maximum $500
fine and/or at most six months
in jail.
The offense falls under the
California Vehicle Code sec
tion 13004 A and, in general, it
defines as illegal: possession,
loan, display, unlawful use, re
production or altering of cards
which can be mistaken for
bona fide California driver's
license or I.D.
A freshman in Trancos, Jack
Feldsher, said it is "infinitely
better to try going it without a

fake 1.D." He explained "the
art of not getting carded."
How to act
First you dress nicely and act
mature. You waltz in to the
liquor store like you own the
place and look the clerk in the
eyes. Ask him for a wine he
probably won't have (maybe a
Robert Mondavi Chenin
Blanc).
While you walk around with
him looking for it, you casually
converse saying something
like "You know a lot of the
stores haven't had it lately."
So then you sigh, "Well, I
guess I'll get some beer in
stead." Have the money in
your hand. There is a crucial
four seconds when he is about
to ring it up. If he hesitates, ask
him the price. That breaks the
ice and you've got it."
Swanky places
According to experienced il
legal boozers, swanky places
(like the San Francisco Sym
phony) never card. And go
with a date, not with a group of
people. Also, they say elderly
sales persons are the easiest to
fool.
Feldsher warned not to let
anyone take the fake I.D. outof
your hand to check it or it may
be confiscated.
One student complained
the drinking law "is ridiculous
anyway. You can get married at
18, but then you couldn't have
champagne at your wedding.
Nobody heeds the law any
way," said the social critic.
"We have sherry hours with
President (Richard) Lyman and
everybody drinks wine.'

Alexander Moya, Jr., man
ager of Bourbon Street is wary
of ABC regulations. He said
ABC agents with long hair and
jeans make unannounced in
spections from time to time.
"They re out to bust because
what they fine is their payroll/'
Moya commented.
Most bouncers and liquor
store clerks have ample ex
perience in spotting fakes.
They hold them over a light and
even know where the staple
holes should be. Some are
paid $5 for each fake they con
fiscate.
Turned away
Work or school I.D.'s or
general I.D. cards not issued
by the state are usually turned
away.
On seldom occasions, stiff
penalties are imposed. Stories
of $200 fines and school expul
sions are floating around the
grapevine. One guy said he
freaked out when the police
man who had just pulled him
over licked the chalk transfer
off his license. He got a ticket.
Attempt
Usually, attempts are merely
met with a rejection and if
caught, it usually means a cita
tion, according to Eaves.
The rackets police concen
trate on uncovering are big
time forgery operations that
provide driver's licenses,
checkbooks and credit cards.
Otherwise, the use of fake
I.D.'s by minors is a subject
discussed with much levity by
all parties involved — culprits
and detectives.


These fake I.D. cards were confiscated by a local drinking establish
ment and are used to train new employees to recognize unacceptable
I.D.'s when presented by customers.

polaroid picture cut to scale
provided a near perfect glossy
replica for a small fee.
"It started as a birthday pro

mate," said the designer.
"Twelve hours later we had 30
people up here. And in a
couple days, people were com
ing from all over campus. They
were getting excited and run
ning down to the store for
more film. It just got out of
hand."
After making about 30 cards
in three days, the racketeer
burned the board. "It was very
satisfying to destroy the mons

Fool proof
"They worked 100 per cent
of the time — even against I.D.
catalogues at liquor stores. But
we stopped because if we
flooded the market, they d be
useless," he added.
Another student paid his
house bill last year with money
from a similar enterprise. Now
a professional graphic artist, he
made over 100 I.D.'s in a year
and a half charging $10 a card.
He said he stopped because no
more of his friends needed a
fake I.D.

The mastermind of a current
operation said he has received
over 60 calls in the last two
weeks. But he is curtailing bus
iness so as not to flood the
market.
Expensive
"They're expensive to
make," he said. (He charges
$7.) Besides the film and "let
raset" costs, he said he risks
getting caught.
Lance Beizer, deputy district
attorney in Santa Clara County
said bogus I.D.'s may be wide
spread, but he hasn't come ac
ross many.
"In my experience, out of
about 500 drunk drivers a
month, four or five illegal I.D.'s
have been found. And it's usu
ally some kid who used it to
buy liquor illegally and
couldn't hold his booze,'' said
Beizer.
Beizer recognized the extent
of spurious I.D. use and said "I
even did it as a kid ... in
another state of course."
Misdemeanor
He said it is a misdemeanor
punishable by a maximum $500
fine and/or at most six months
in jail.
The offense falls under the
California Vehicle Code sec
tion 13004 A and, in general, it
defines as illegal: possession,
loan, display, unlawful use, re
production or altering of cards
which can be mistaken for
bona fide California driver's
license or I.D.
A freshman in Trancos, Jack
Feldsher, said it is "infinitely
better to try going it without a

fake 1.D." He explained "the
art of not getting carded."
How to act
First you dress nicely and act
mature. You waltz in to the
liquor store like you own the
place and look the clerk in the
eyes. Ask him for a wine he
probably won't have (maybe a
Robert Mondavi Chenin
Blanc).
While you walk around with
him looking for it, you casually
converse saying something
like "You know a lot of the
stores haven't had it lately."
So then you sigh, "Well, I
guess I'll get some beer in
stead." Have the money in
your hand. There is a crucial
four seconds when he is about
to ring it up. If he hesitates, ask
him the price. That breaks the
ice and you've got it."
Swanky places
According to experienced il
legal boozers, swanky places
(like the San Francisco Sym
phony) never card. And go
with a date, not with a group of
people. Also, they say elderly
sales persons are the easiest to
fool.
Feldsher warned not to let
anyone take the fake I.D. outof
your hand to check it or it may
be confiscated.
One student complained
the drinking law "is ridiculous
anyway. You can get married at
18, but then you couldn't have
champagne at your wedding.
Nobody heeds the law any
way," said the social critic.
"We have sherry hours with
President (Richard) Lyman and
everybody drinks wine.'

Alexander Moya, Jr., man
ager of Bourbon Street is wary
of ABC regulations. He said
ABC agents with long hair and
jeans make unannounced in
spections from time to time.
"They re out to bust because
what they fine is their payroll/'
Moya commented.
Most bouncers and liquor
store clerks have ample ex
perience in spotting fakes.
They hold them over a light and
even know where the staple
holes should be. Some are
paid $5 for each fake they con
fiscate.
Turned away
Work or school I.D.'s or
general I.D. cards not issued
by the state are usually turned
away.
On seldom occasions, stiff
penalties are imposed. Stories
of $200 fines and school expul
sions are floating around the
grapevine. One guy said he
freaked out when the police
man who had just pulled him
over licked the chalk transfer
off his license. He got a ticket.
Attempt
Usually, attempts are merely
met with a rejection and if
caught, it usually means a cita
tion, according to Eaves.
The rackets police concen
trate on uncovering are big
time forgery operations that
provide driver's licenses,
checkbooks and credit cards.
Otherwise, the use of fake
I.D.'s by minors is a subject
discussed with much levity by
all parties involved — culprits
and detectives.


These fake I.D. cards were confiscated by a local drinking establish
ment and are used to train new employees to recognize unacceptable
I.D.'s when presented by customers.
Are you underaged and
lonely? sober and blue? Well,
with a little time and initiative
plus $7 and a mild case of
paranoia, your problems can
be solved.
You could be the twenty-first
on your block to get a fake I.D.
card and have liquor stores,
bars and discos open their
doors for you, but you won't
be the firsts.
Many students on campus
can tell you stories of their suc
cess with the phony I.D.
Through a myriad of clever
schemes, they have borrowed,

lied, stolen, connived, forged,
chalked, or carved their passes
to the liquor store.
Out of 65 freshpersons sur
veyed, one-fifth said they had
bogus I.D.'s. Limiting the sam
ple to males, the fraction rose
to one-half.
And half of those replying
negative would add "unfortu
nately not," "no, I wish I did,"
or "not yet."
"Over half my high school
class had one," said one Bran
ner resident. "Here it's back
wards. It's depressing.'' How
ever, most people were sur
prised at the high percentage

of males with fakes.
"The most common type are
the altered driver's licenses
where a zip code number has
been cut out and switched to
the date of birth,' said Steve
Creer, bartender at Fargo's
Pizza Factory in Mountain View
(they serve beer). "I'd say that
on the average night we have
four out of ten people present
bad I.D.'s," he added.
Joe Adriano, bouncer at
Bourbon Street disco in Moun
tain View said the most com
mon ones were "the laminated
'I.D. Cards' with a star on the
right where the California seal
should be."
"The best ones are when
they change the '58 into a '53
for the birth year," Adriano
added "We get 10 or 12 altered
I.D.'s on a weekend night."
Change digits
Students born in '59 said
they just cut out the nine and
turn it upside down so it reads
'56. Others chalk out digits and
write in new ones. Some
teenagers often get temporary
or duplicate drivers licenses
under an older brother's or sis
ter's name.
"The guys who have bor
rowed their big brother's
license are really tough to
catch," said the bouncer at
Jumping Frog discotheque.
One student who didn t go
for such petty and unsure
methods, recommended a
forgery operation in Berkeley
that makes false birth certifi
cates. He said he found out
about it from a Hell's Angel at a
party.
Daily ad
"Did you see that ad in the
Daily for a fake 1.D." one stu
dent asked me. "I can t believe
someone would have the gall
to do that! What is the world
coming to?"

I placed that ad two weeks
ago and have received eight
phone calls so far. Three
people told me of bogus I.D.
operations around campus,
and five people wanted to
know what the others had said.
I talked to one entrepreneur,
a product design major, who
shut down his racket last year.
With the help of frat brothers,
he laid out a 4 by 3 foot poster
board to resemble an out of
state driver's license.
Perfect replica
There was an open square in
the corner for customers to
place their head — like those
carnival pop-ip backdrops. A
polaroid picture cut to scale
provided a near perfect glossy
replica for a small fee.
"It started as a birthday pro
ject for me and my room

with a date, not with a group of

sales persons are the easiest to

Feldsher warned not to let
anyone take the fake I.D. outof
your hand to check it or it may
be confiscated.
One student complained
the drinking law "is ridiculous
anyway. You can get married at
18, but then you couldn't have
champagne at your wedding.
Nobody heeds the law any

"They re out to bust because

Moya commented.
Most bouncers and liquor
store clerks have ample ex
perience in spotting fakes.
They hold them over a light and
even know where the staple
holes should be. Some are
paid $5 for each fake they con
fiscate.
Turned away
Work or school I.D.'s or
general I.D. cards not issued
by the state are usually turned
away.
On seldom occasions, stiff
penalties are imposed. Stories
of $200 fines and school expul
sions are floating around the
grapevine. One guy said he
freaked out when the police
man who had just pulled him
over licked the chalk transfer
off his license. He got a ticket.
Attempt
Usually, attempts are merely
met with a rejection and if
caught, it usually means a cita
tion, according to Eaves.
The rackets police concen
trate on uncovering are big
time forgery operations that
provide driver's licenses,
checkbooks and credit cards.
Otherwise, the use of fake
I.D.'s by minors is a subject

all parties involved — culprits
and detectives.


These fake I.D. cards were confiscated by a local drinking establish
ment and are used to train new employees to recognize unacceptable
I.D.'s when presented by customers.
Are you underaged and
lonely? sober and blue? Well,
with a little time and initiative
plus $7 and a mild case of
paranoia, your problems can
be solved.
You could be the twenty-first
on your block to get a fake I.D.
card and have liquor stores,
bars and discos open their
doors for you, but you won't
be the firsts.
Many students on campus
can tell you stories of their suc
cess with the phony I.D.
Through a myriad of clever
schemes, they have borrowed,

lied, stolen, connived, forged,
chalked, or carved their passes
to the liquor store.
Out of 65 freshpersons sur
veyed, one-fifth said they had
bogus I.D.'s. Limiting the sam
ple to males, the fraction rose
to one-half.
And half of those replying
negative would add "unfortu
nately not," "no, I wish I did,"
or "not yet."
"Over half my high school
class had one," said one Bran
ner resident. "Here it's back
wards. It's depressing.'' How
ever, most people were sur
prised at the high percentage

of males with fakes.
"The most common type are
the altered driver's licenses
where a zip code number has
been cut out and switched to
the date of birth,' said Steve
Creer, bartender at Fargo's
Pizza Factory in Mountain View
(they serve beer). "I'd say that
on the average night we have
four out of ten people present
bad I.D.'s," he added.
Joe Adriano, bouncer at
Bourbon Street disco in Moun
tain View said the most com
mon ones were "the laminated
'I.D. Cards' with a star on the
right where the California seal
should be."
"The best ones are when
they change the '58 into a '53
for the birth year," Adriano
added "We get 10 or 12 altered
I.D.'s on a weekend night."
Change digits
Students born in '59 said
they just cut out the nine and
turn it upside down so it reads
'56. Others chalk out digits and
write in new ones. Some
teenagers often get temporary
or duplicate drivers licenses
under an older brother's or sis
ter's name.
"The guys who have bor
rowed their big brother's
license are really tough to
catch," said the bouncer at
Jumping Frog discotheque.
One student who didn t go
for such petty and unsure
methods, recommended a
forgery operation in Berkeley
that makes false birth certifi
cates. He said he found out
about it from a Hell's Angel at a
party.
Daily ad
"Did you see that ad in the
Daily for a fake 1.D." one stu
dent asked me. "I can t believe
someone would have the gall
to do that! What is the world
coming to?"

I placed that ad two weeks
ago and have received eight
phone calls so far. Three
people told me of bogus I.D.
operations around campus,
and five people wanted to
know what the others had said.
I talked to one entrepreneur,
a product design major, who
shut down his racket last year.
With the help of frat brothers,
he laid out a 4 by 3 foot poster
board to resemble an out of
state driver's license.
Perfect replica
There was an open square in
the corner for customers to
place their head — like those
carnival pop-ip backdrops. A
polaroid picture cut to scale
provided a near perfect glossy
replica for a small fee.
"It started as a birthday pro
ject for me and my room
mate," said the designer.
"Twelve hours later we had 30
people up here. And in a
couple days, people were com
ing from all over campus. They
were getting excited and run
ning down to the store for
more film. It just got out of
hand."
After making about 30 cards
in three days, the racketeer
burned the board. "It was very
satisfying to destroy the mons
ter I had created," he said.
Fool proof
"They worked 100 per cent
of the time — even against I.D.
catalogues at liquor stores. But
we stopped because if we
flooded the market, they d be
useless," he added.
Another student paid his
house bill last year with money
from a similar enterprise. Now
a professional graphic artist, he
made over 100 I.D.'s in a year
and a half charging $10 a card.
He said he stopped because no
more of his friends needed a
fake I.D.

The mastermind of a current
operation said he has received
over 60 calls in the last two
weeks. But he is curtailing bus
iness so as not to flood the
market.
Expensive
"They're expensive to
make," he said. (He charges
$7.) Besides the film and "let
raset" costs, he said he risks
getting caught.
Lance Beizer, deputy district
attorney in Santa Clara County
said bogus I.D.'s may be wide
spread, but he hasn't come ac
ross many.
"In my experience, out of
about 500 drunk drivers a
month, four or five illegal I.D.'s
have been found. And it's usu
ally some kid who used it to
buy liquor illegally and
couldn't hold his booze,'' said
Beizer.
Beizer recognized the extent
of spurious I.D. use and said "I
even did it as a kid ... in
another state of course."
Misdemeanor
He said it is a misdemeanor
punishable by a maximum $500
fine and/or at most six months
in jail.
The offense falls under the
California Vehicle Code sec
tion 13004 A and, in general, it
defines as illegal: possession,
loan, display, unlawful use, re
production or altering of cards
which can be mistaken for
bona fide California driver's
license or I.D.
A freshman in Trancos, Jack
Feldsher, said it is "infinitely
better to try going it without a

fake 1.D." He explained "the
art of not getting carded."
How to act
First you dress nicely and act
mature. You waltz in to the
liquor store like you own the
place and look the clerk in the
eyes. Ask him for a wine he
probably won't have (maybe a
Robert Mondavi Chenin
Blanc).
While you walk around with
him looking for it, you casually
converse saying something
like "You know a lot of the
stores haven't had it lately."
So then you sigh, "Well, I
guess I'll get some beer in
stead." Have the money in
your hand. There is a crucial
four seconds when he is about
to ring it up. If he hesitates, ask
him the price. That breaks the
ice and you've got it."
Swanky places
According to experienced il
legal boozers, swanky places
(like the San Francisco Sym
phony) never card. And go
with a date, not with a group of
people. Also, they say elderly
sales persons are the easiest to
fool.

(they serve beer). "I'd say that
on the average night we have
four out of ten people present
bad I.D.'s," he added.
Joe Adriano, bouncer at
Bourbon Street disco in Moun
tain View said the most com
mon ones were "the laminated
'I.D. Cards' with a star on the
right where the California seal
should be."
"The best ones are when
they change the '58 into a '53
for the birth year," Adriano
added "We get 10 or 12 altered
I.D.'s on a weekend night."
Change digits
Students born in '59 said
they just cut out the nine and
turn it upside down so it reads
'56. Others chalk out digits and
write in new ones. Some
teenagers often get temporary
or duplicate drivers licenses
under an older brother's or sis
ter's name.
"The guys who have bor
rowed their big brother's
license are really tough to
catch," said the bouncer at
Jumping Frog discotheque.
One student who didn t go
for such petty and unsure
methods, recommended a
forgery operation in Berkeley
that makes false birth certifi
cates. He said he found out
about it from a Hell's Angel at a
party.
Daily ad
"Did you see that ad in the
Daily for a fake 1.D." one stu
dent asked me. "I can t believe
someone would have the gall
to do that! What is the world
coming to?"

I placed that ad two weeks
ago and have received eight
phone calls so far. Three
people told me of bogus I.D.
operations around campus,
and five people wanted to
know what the others had said.
I talked to one entrepreneur,
a product design major, who
shut down his racket last year.
With the help of frat brothers,
he laid out a 4 by 3 foot poster
board to resemble an out of
state driver's license.
Perfect replica
There was an open square in
the corner for customers to
place their head — like those
carnival pop-ip backdrops. A
polaroid picture cut to scale
provided a near perfect glossy
replica for a small fee.
"It started as a birthday pro
ject for me and my room
mate," said the designer.
"Twelve hours later we had 30
people up here. And in a
couple days, people were com
ing from all over campus. They
were getting excited and run
ning down to the store for
more film. It just got out of
hand."
After making about 30 cards
in three days, the racketeer
burned the board. "It was very
satisfying to destroy the mons
ter I had created," he said.
Fool proof
"They worked 100 per cent
of the time — even against I.D.
catalogues at liquor stores. But
we stopped because if we
flooded the market, they d be
useless," he added.
Another student paid his
house bill last year with money
from a similar enterprise. Now
a professional graphic artist, he
made over 100 I.D.'s in a year
and a half charging $10 a card.
He said he stopped because no
more of his friends needed a
fake I.D.

The mastermind of a current
operation said he has received
over 60 calls in the last two
weeks. But he is curtailing bus
iness so as not to flood the
market.
Expensive
"They're expensive to
make," he said. (He charges
$7.) Besides the film and "let
raset" costs, he said he risks
getting caught.
Lance Beizer, deputy district
attorney in Santa Clara County
said bogus I.D.'s may be wide
spread, but he hasn't come ac
ross many.
"In my experience, out of
about 500 drunk drivers a
month, four or five illegal I.D.'s
have been found. And it's usu
ally some kid who used it to
buy liquor illegally and
couldn't hold his booze,'' said
Beizer.
Beizer recognized the extent
of spurious I.D. use and said "I
even did it as a kid ... in
another state of course."
Misdemeanor
He said it is a misdemeanor
punishable by a maximum $500
fine and/or at most six months
in jail.
The offense falls under the
California Vehicle Code sec
tion 13004 A and, in general, it
defines as illegal: possession,
loan, display, unlawful use, re
production or altering of cards
which can be mistaken for
bona fide California driver's
license or I.D.
A freshman in Trancos, Jack
Feldsher, said it is "infinitely
better to try going it without a

fake 1.D." He explained "the
art of not getting carded."
How to act
First you dress nicely and act
mature. You waltz in to the
liquor store like you own the
place and look the clerk in the
eyes. Ask him for a wine he
probably won't have (maybe a
Robert Mondavi Chenin
Blanc).
While you walk around with
him looking for it, you casually
converse saying something
like "You know a lot of the
stores haven't had it lately."
So then you sigh, "Well, I
guess I'll get some beer in
stead." Have the money in
your hand. There is a crucial
four seconds when he is about
to ring it up. If he hesitates, ask
him the price. That breaks the
ice and you've got it."
Swanky places
According to experienced il
legal boozers, swanky places
(like the San Francisco Sym
phony) never card. And go
with a date, not with a group of
people. Also, they say elderly
sales persons are the easiest to
fool.
Feldsher warned not to let
anyone take the fake I.D. outof
your hand to check it or it may
be confiscated.
One student complained
the drinking law "is ridiculous
anyway. You can get married at
18, but then you couldn't have
champagne at your wedding.
Nobody heeds the law any
way," said the social critic.
"We have sherry hours with
President (Richard) Lyman and
everybody drinks wine.'

Alexander Moya, Jr., man
ager of Bourbon Street is wary
of ABC regulations. He said
ABC agents with long hair and
jeans make unannounced in
spections from time to time.
"They re out to bust because
what they fine is their payroll/'
Moya commented.
Most bouncers and liquor
store clerks have ample ex
perience in spotting fakes.
They hold them over a light and
even know where the staple
holes should be. Some are
paid $5 for each fake they con
fiscate.
Turned away
Work or school I.D.'s or
general I.D. cards not issued
by the state are usually turned
away.
On seldom occasions, stiff
penalties are imposed. Stories
of $200 fines and school expul
sions are floating around the
grapevine. One guy said he
freaked out when the police
man who had just pulled him
over licked the chalk transfer
off his license. He got a ticket.
Attempt
Usually, attempts are merely
met with a rejection and if
caught, it usually means a cita
tion, according to Eaves.
The rackets police concen
trate on uncovering are big
time forgery operations that
provide driver's licenses,
checkbooks and credit cards.
Otherwise, the use of fake
I.D.'s by minors is a subject
discussed with much levity by
all parties involved — culprits
and detectives.


These fake I.D. cards were confiscated by a local drinking establish
ment and are used to train new employees to recognize unacceptable
I.D.'s when presented by customers.
Are you underaged and
lonely? sober and blue? Well,
with a little time and initiative
plus $7 and a mild case of
paranoia, your problems can
be solved.
You could be the twenty-first
on your block to get a fake I.D.
card and have liquor stores,
bars and discos open their
doors for you, but you won't
be the firsts.
Many students on campus
can tell you stories of their suc
cess with the phony I.D.
Through a myriad of clever
schemes, they have borrowed,

lied, stolen, connived, forged,
chalked, or carved their passes
to the liquor store.
Out of 65 freshpersons sur
veyed, one-fifth said they had
bogus I.D.'s. Limiting the sam
ple to males, the fraction rose
to one-half.
And half of those replying
negative would add "unfortu
nately not," "no, I wish I did,"
or "not yet."
"Over half my high school
class had one," said one Bran
ner resident. "Here it's back
wards. It's depressing.'' How
ever, most people were sur
prised at the high percentage

of males with fakes.
"The most common type are
the altered driver's licenses
where a zip code number has
been cut out and switched to
the date of birth,' said Steve
Creer, bartender at Fargo's
Pizza Factory in Mountain View
(they serve beer). "I'd say that
on the average night we have
four out of ten people present
bad I.D.'s," he added.
