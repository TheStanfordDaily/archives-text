# Chinese New Year
## Gala parade ends in 18 arrests 
### Susan Hart 
Over 30,000 spectators crowded into the
small streets of Chinatown Saturday night
in a gala New Year's celebration that
ended in 18 arrests.
People sat on traffic signs, window sills,
fire escapes and building tops — any
where to get a good view.
Down in the streets, the audience stood
silently, usually speaking only to comment
on such things as the 'cuteness' of the
Chinese Mission Girl's Drum Corp, who
marched merrily along playing happy
tunes like "It's a small world' with bells
and drums.
There were bands, marching corps and
even a cycle gang in the parade. In keeping
with the theme of the parade, "The Year of
the Horse," the White Horse Scotch Com
pany entered a float with five Chinese
beauties and a sign that said, "White
Horse Scotch wishes you happiness and
prosperity."
History
The Year of the Horse celebration dates
back hundreds of years. According to
legend, Buddha called forthall theanimals
of the world to help him celebrate the new
year. As a mark of honor for coming, a year
was to be named after them.
The character of each animal is attri
buted to his year and also to people born
in that year.
There were groups and people of all
colors in the parade. The audience was
equally diverse, including people clad
from rags to riches and black to white.
Zigzag
The parade ran a zigzag course through
Chinatown for two hours. Motorists trap
ped on streets that intersected with the
parade route didn't seem to mind the in

convenience. Many just stood on their car
tops to get a look at the parade as it passed
on.
Mayor Moscone was there waving to
spectators from a black limousine. Super
visor Lee Dolson was in a vintage Rolls
Royce and Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver
rode in a white Mercedes Benz. Super
visor Harry Milk got the most cheers as he
sported a grey Toyota with two men on the
back holding a sign that read "Gay Asian
Support Group."
It was aboutB:3o when the final salute to
the dragon was made. It came up the street
like an awkward but majestic monster. Its
150-foot body twisted and jerked in a
serpent-like manner above its 15 or so car
riers.
Dragon
The dragon was a myriad of colors,
feathers, lights, and bells which cost
$8000. When it finally came to a stop and
lifted its massive head, firecrackers
sounded, drums banged and theaudience
roared.
Spectators began to crowd the street
joining in on the parade as Public Defen
der )im Brown drove up behind them —
obviously late. The parade was over.
For the next few hours spectators
headed up Grant Street towards the wharf
lighting firecrackers. "It sounds like a
war!" shouted one female spectator who
could barely be heard above all the noise.
Warlike
Indeed it was like a war, for around 10
p.m. a bonfire was lit at the corner of Grant
and Washington streets. People began
throwing firecrackers and cherry bombs
into passing cars. Some people jumped on
car tops while others dragged passing
motorists from their cars and began beat

ing them.
Two lone policemen were attacked
when police began making arrests. Three
were taken into custody for assaulting a
police officer with a deadly weapon, two
for failure to disperse, and 13 for resisting
arrest and drunkenness.
"There were a lot of people hit in the
face with flying glass, cherry bombs and
firecrackers," said police officer Francis
Fahey. No estimates could be made as to
exactly how many people were injured be
cause many took themselves to the hospi
tal, he said.
Attendance
Attendance was down approximately
100,000 this year for fear of a gang violence
incident during the parade, according to
parade coordinator CedricCoo. However,
the arrests did not involve Chinatown re
sidents.
There were three violent gang-related
incidents just last week. Two youths were
shot, one badly beaten at a local high
school, and thieves got away with over
$5000 in money and jewels at gunpoint
from a Chinese American Engineers meet
ing on Friday. One member of the "Hop
Sing Boy's" gang was arrested Saturday
night in conjunction with that robbery.
Over 200 San Francisco Police and an
unknown amount of private police officers
patrolled the area Saturday night — the
largest ever assigned to the parade. Scores
of policemen, often in groups of up to 10,
marched through the area in riot gear.
Despite the necessity of their presence,
it blemished the chaacter of the celebra
tion.
With the exception of the arrests, "Ev
erything ran very smoothly," said Goo.
