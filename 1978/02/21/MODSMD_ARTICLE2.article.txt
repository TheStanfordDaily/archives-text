# Harris decides not to run for Congress
## 
### Jonathan Slater 
David Harris will not challenge'
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park)
for the 12th Congressional District
seat this November, the former Stan
ford student body president said in a
recent interview. He said he simply
does not have the energy for a sec
ond campaign.
Harris lost overwhelmingly to
McCloskey in November 1976, re
ceiving only 31 per cent of the dis
trict's votes while McCloskey re
ceived 66 per cent.
Last month Harris finished paying
off his $9000 campaign debt and he
said he cannot justify spending the
time — 18 months of 70-hour work
weeks — and the money — $140,000,
the price tag on his last effort — in a
futile attempt to replace the incum
bent.
Invincible foe
"I don't think that anybody can
beat McCloskey," Harris said. "He's
real solid and has a real good hold on
the district."
He called McCloskey "bright, at
tractive and energetic/' all ingre
dients of "a real good political com
bination."
But most of all, McCloskey is an

incumbent.
"Incumbents have a great advan
tage, whomever they are," Harris
said. McCloskey has served five con
secutive two-year terms in
Washington.
Despite the disappointment of
political defeat, Harris is not bitter.
He said he is content in having made
the attempt and added he considers
it a valuable experience.
"It was a good thing to do," Harris
said. "I think we finally learned a les
son, made a contribution. I'm real
glad.
Rookie errors
As a newcomer, Harris made mis
takes. If he were to run again, he said
he would campaign differently, de
voting his time and money "much
more wisely."'
Meanwhile, Harris is pursuing a
productive journalistic career, with
the New York Sunday Times. He re
cently wrote several exposes for the
Sunday Times Magazine.
Harris said he still maintains hopes
for a future in politics — just not this
year in this district. Harris carried the
Stanford community in the election
and said he is thankful for its sup
port.
