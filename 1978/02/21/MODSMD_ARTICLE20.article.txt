# Bears touch out Stanford in 'Big Meet,' 61-52
## Cal wins final relay to drown Cardinal upset hopes 
### Andy Lowe 
Claiming victory only at the final touch of the
freestyle relay, California held off a charged up
Stanford swim team, winning 61-52. Roaring ap
proval of the Cards comeback in the second half
of the contest, the 1000 plus spectators were
treated to one of the most exciting meets ever
witnessed at deCuerre.
Individual brilliance characterized Stanford's
effort as they outscored the Bears in individual
swimming events, 50-31. For those who rested
for the meet, the long season's hard work was
rewarded. Sophomore Ken Shilling, winner of
the "clutch performer of the day" award, out
swam world record holder Graham Smith in two
events to keep Stanford's upset hopes alive. In
capturing the 200 yard individual medley
(1:53.71) and 200 yard breaststroke (2:05.22),
Shilling qualified for the NCAAs in both events
and posted times ranking him among the top
five nationally.
"Ken did a super job today," said coach
Claudia Thomas after the meet. "He really came
through for us under a lot of pressure."
"I was happy with my times today," said an
elated Shilling following the meet. "But I hope
to go faster at the NCAAs in March."
Freshman Ted Knapp also starred in two
events. Joining teammate Mike Bruner in the 200
freestyle, Knapp contributed to a 1-2 Stanford
finish, touching at 1:40.97, just off the stringent
NCAA qualifying standard. His lead-off leg of
the 400 freestyle relay (46.3) was a lifetime best
and helped the Card relay off to a fast start.
Stanford's Paul Hartloff, an Olympic finalist in
the 1500 meter free at Montreal, lapped all of his
opponents in the 1650 free, racing to an impres
sive 15:33.05. Hartloff's time should place him in
the NCAA finals, where he will battle fellow
Olympians, Bobby Hackett, Tim Shaw and Brian
Coodell for the 1650 free title.
Tireless Mike Bruner was unbeatable, the only
swimmer to win three races. The world's top
ranked 200 butterflier sped to fine times in the
200 free (1:40.53), 200 fly (1:49.50) and 500 free
(4:28.66).

Commendable performances also came from
co-captain Stu Corliss and freshman Tom Ire
land. Coriiss came from behind to garner an
important third place in the 200 breast (2:07.82),
proving his layover had minimal adverse effects.
Ireland surprised many by beating Graham
Smith in the 200 I.M. (1:57.12) and by cruising to
a fast 51.84 in the 100 fly.
"This was a fantastic meet for us," com
mented coach jim Caughran when the disap
pointment of losing the final relay had subsided.
"It is encouraging that everyone who has rested
has swum well. I think we will do well at the
NCAAs."
Although finishing the dual meet season with
a 4-6 record, the Cards should have no trouble
finishing among the top 10 teams at the NCAA
championships, March 22 to 24. Already eight
individuals and two relays have qualified for the
NCAAs with many others expected to make
standards at the Pac-8 Southern Division champ
ionships, March 2 to 4.

Paul Hartloff rests after winning the 1650 freestyle against Cal Satur- —Daily photo by John Pomiret
day. His time of 15:33.05 was good enough to qualify him for the NCAA championships in March.
Claiming victory only at the final touch of the
freestyle relay, California held off a charged up
Stanford swim team, winning 61-52. Roaring ap
proval of the Cards comeback in the second half
of the contest, the 1000 plus spectators were
treated to one of the most exciting meets ever
witnessed at deCuerre.
Individual brilliance characterized Stanford's
effort as they outscored the Bears in individual
swimming events, 50-31. For those who rested
for the meet, the long season's hard work was
rewarded. Sophomore Ken Shilling, winner of
the "clutch performer of the day" award, out
swam world record holder Graham Smith in two
events to keep Stanford's upset hopes alive. In
capturing the 200 yard individual medley
(1:53.71) and 200 yard breaststroke (2:05.22),
Shilling qualified for the NCAAs in both events
and posted times ranking him among the top
five nationally.
"Ken did a super job today," said coach
Claudia Thomas after the meet. "He really came
through for us under a lot of pressure."
"I was happy with my times today," said an
elated Shilling following the meet. "But I hope
to go faster at the NCAAs in March."
Freshman Ted Knapp also starred in two
events. Joining teammate Mike Bruner in the 200
freestyle, Knapp contributed to a 1-2 Stanford
finish, touching at 1:40.97, just off the stringent
NCAA qualifying standard. His lead-off leg of
the 400 freestyle relay (46.3) was a lifetime best
and helped the Card relay off to a fast start.
Stanford's Paul Hartloff, an Olympic finalist in
the 1500 meter free at Montreal, lapped all of his
opponents in the 1650 free, racing to an impres
sive 15:33.05. Hartloff's time should place him in
the NCAA finals, where he will battle fellow
Olympians, Bobby Hackett, Tim Shaw and Brian
Coodell for the 1650 free title.
Tireless Mike Bruner was unbeatable, the only
swimmer to win three races. The world's top
ranked 200 butterflier sped to fine times in the
200 free (1:40.53), 200 fly (1:49.50) and 500 free
(4:28.66).

Commendable performances also came from
co-captain Stu Corliss and freshman Tom Ire
land. Coriiss came from behind to garner an
important third place in the 200 breast (2:07.82),
proving his layover had minimal adverse effects.
Ireland surprised many by beating Graham
Smith in the 200 I.M. (1:57.12) and by cruising to
a fast 51.84 in the 100 fly.
"This was a fantastic meet for us," com
mented coach jim Caughran when the disap
pointment of losing the final relay had subsided.
"It is encouraging that everyone who has rested
has swum well. I think we will do well at the
NCAAs."
Although finishing the dual meet season with
a 4-6 record, the Cards should have no trouble
finishing among the top 10 teams at the NCAA
championships, March 22 to 24. Already eight
individuals and two relays have qualified for the
NCAAs with many others expected to make
standards at the Pac-8 Southern Division champ
ionships, March 2 to 4.

Paul Hartloff rests after winning the 1650 freestyle against Cal Satur- —Daily photo by John Pomiret
day. His time of 15:33.05 was good enough to qualify him for the NCAA championships in March.
Claiming victory only at the final touch of the
freestyle relay, California held off a charged up
Stanford swim team, winning 61-52. Roaring ap
proval of the Cards comeback in the second half
of the contest, the 1000 plus spectators were
treated to one of the most exciting meets ever
witnessed at deCuerre.
Individual brilliance characterized Stanford's
effort as they outscored the Bears in individual
swimming events, 50-31. For those who rested
for the meet, the long season's hard work was
rewarded. Sophomore Ken Shilling, winner of
the "clutch performer of the day" award, out
swam world record holder Graham Smith in two
events to keep Stanford's upset hopes alive. In
capturing the 200 yard individual medley
(1:53.71) and 200 yard breaststroke (2:05.22),
Shilling qualified for the NCAAs in both events
and posted times ranking him among the top
five nationally.
"Ken did a super job today," said coach
Claudia Thomas after the meet. "He really came
through for us under a lot of pressure."
"I was happy with my times today," said an
elated Shilling following the meet. "But I hope
to go faster at the NCAAs in March."
Freshman Ted Knapp also starred in two
events. Joining teammate Mike Bruner in the 200
freestyle, Knapp contributed to a 1-2 Stanford
finish, touching at 1:40.97, just off the stringent
NCAA qualifying standard. His lead-off leg of
the 400 freestyle relay (46.3) was a lifetime best
and helped the Card relay off to a fast start.
Stanford's Paul Hartloff, an Olympic finalist in
the 1500 meter free at Montreal, lapped all of his
opponents in the 1650 free, racing to an impres
sive 15:33.05. Hartloff's time should place him in
the NCAA finals, where he will battle fellow
Olympians, Bobby Hackett, Tim Shaw and Brian
Coodell for the 1650 free title.
Tireless Mike Bruner was unbeatable, the only
swimmer to win three races. The world's top
ranked 200 butterflier sped to fine times in the
200 free (1:40.53), 200 fly (1:49.50) and 500 free
(4:28.66).

Commendable performances also came from
co-captain Stu Corliss and freshman Tom Ire
land. Coriiss came from behind to garner an
important third place in the 200 breast (2:07.82),
proving his layover had minimal adverse effects.
Ireland surprised many by beating Graham
Smith in the 200 I.M. (1:57.12) and by cruising to
a fast 51.84 in the 100 fly.
"This was a fantastic meet for us," com
mented coach jim Caughran when the disap
pointment of losing the final relay had subsided.
"It is encouraging that everyone who has rested
has swum well. I think we will do well at the
NCAAs."
Although finishing the dual meet season with
a 4-6 record, the Cards should have no trouble
finishing among the top 10 teams at the NCAA
championships, March 22 to 24. Already eight
individuals and two relays have qualified for the
NCAAs with many others expected to make
standards at the Pac-8 Southern Division champ
ionships, March 2 to 4.
