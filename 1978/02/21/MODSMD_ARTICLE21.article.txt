# Women win two over weekend
## 
### Sukie Jackson 
The Stanford women have a winning basketball team.
Two victories this weekend over Biola State 61-59, and Santa
Clara University 74-69, boosted the Cards overall record to 15-8
and their league mark to 8-1. To gain a berth in the upcoming
regional tournament the Cards must continue their winning
streak against three of the toughest teams in the league: Cal, San
lose State and USF.
If Stanford plays as well as it did this weekend, though, they
should do well. The game against Biola demonstrated the Cards
ability to play well under pressure. Stanford trailed the Lady
Eagles by several points most of the first and second half but with
three minutes left in the game, Maggie Nelson rebounded her
own missed jumpshot and scored ffom under the basket to give
the Cards the lead, 56-55. Kathy Murphy then converted a steal
into a lay up to put Stanford ahead by three.
Biola fought back into the lead though, 59-58, but Nelson sunk a
jumpshot and Betsy Lough hit one of two free throws making it
61 -59. The last minute of the game was a series of missed oppor
tunities for both teams and either could have won the contest.
Stanford missed a 1-and-1 free throw which could have given the
Cards a four point lead, but Biola missed two outside shots that
would have tied the game.
With just five seconds on the clock Biola tried one last time to
tie the score with an inbounds pass to 6'3" center Laurie Buthuis
but the Cards recovered the fumbled ball and held it until the

buzzer sounded.
"Beating an L.A. school like this is a big step for us," Stanford
coach Dottie McCrea said after the game. "Our defense was
outstanding and it kept us in the game." Biola State, an inter
denominational college south of Los Angeles won fourth place in
last year's small college Nationals. The Lady Eagles, with eight
women on scholarship, post a record of 15-6 after the loss to
Stanford.
Leading the Cards in scoring, Murphy had 19 points, Nelson
had 15 and Betsy Lough added 11.
"Betsy had a great game," said McCrea, "and she's really
coming along as a ball handler."
The Santa Clara game, a league match, was an easier victory for
Stanford. "They were never in striking distance," McCrea said.
Stanford took an early lead and led by as many as 18 points during
the game.
Again, Nelson and Murphy led Stanford in scoring. Nelson
netted 24 points while Murphy added 15 points and 10 rebounds.
Guard Stephanie Galef also hit double figures with 10 points. For
the Broncos, Jenny Lynn had 19 points.
Santa Clara has an 0-9 record in the Northern California Athletic
League. "We're a young team but 300 per cent better than last
year," Bronco coach Trish Moore said. She commented on Stan
ford's "tremendous improvement" and noted that, "they (Stan
ford) have more depth and skill this year.'"
After last weekend's victories, Stanford goes into its most im
portant games a much improved, confident team. They face Cal
tomorrow in Berkeley at 8 p.m. in the first of three league games
that the Cards must win. "It's great to have three wins going into
the Cal game," assistant coach Sue Rojcewicz said. Stanford
defeated the Bears earlier in the season 72-67.

"Beating an L.A. school like this is a big step for us," Stanford
coach Dottie McCrea said after the game. "Our defense was
outstanding and it kept us in the game." Biola State, an inter
denominational college south of Los Angeles won fourth place in
last year's small college Nationals. The Lady Eagles, with eight
women on scholarship, post a record of 15-6 after the loss to
Stanford.
Leading the Cards in scoring, Murphy had 19 points, Nelson
had 15 and Betsy Lough added 11.
"Betsy had a great game," said McCrea, "and she's really
coming along as a ball handler."
The Santa Clara game, a league match, was an easier victory for
Stanford. "They were never in striking distance," McCrea said.
Stanford took an early lead and led by as many as 18 points during
the game.
Again, Nelson and Murphy led Stanford in scoring. Nelson
netted 24 points while Murphy added 15 points and 10 rebounds.
Guard Stephanie Galef also hit double figures with 10 points. For
the Broncos, Jenny Lynn had 19 points.
Santa Clara has an 0-9 record in the Northern California Athletic
League. "We're a young team but 300 per cent better than last
year," Bronco coach Trish Moore said. She commented on Stan
ford's "tremendous improvement" and noted that, "they (Stan
ford) have more depth and skill this year.'"
After last weekend's victories, Stanford goes into its most im
portant games a much improved, confident team. They face Cal
tomorrow in Berkeley at 8 p.m. in the first of three league games
that the Cards must win. "It's great to have three wins going into
the Cal game," assistant coach Sue Rojcewicz said. Stanford
defeated the Bears earlier in the season 72-67.
The Stanford women have a winning basketball team.
Two victories this weekend over Biola State 61-59, and Santa
Clara University 74-69, boosted the Cards overall record to 15-8
and their league mark to 8-1. To gain a berth in the upcoming
regional tournament the Cards must continue their winning
streak against three of the toughest teams in the league: Cal, San
lose State and USF.
If Stanford plays as well as it did this weekend, though, they
should do well. The game against Biola demonstrated the Cards
ability to play well under pressure. Stanford trailed the Lady
Eagles by several points most of the first and second half but with
three minutes left in the game, Maggie Nelson rebounded her
own missed jumpshot and scored ffom under the basket to give
the Cards the lead, 56-55. Kathy Murphy then converted a steal
into a lay up to put Stanford ahead by three.
Biola fought back into the lead though, 59-58, but Nelson sunk a
jumpshot and Betsy Lough hit one of two free throws making it
61 -59. The last minute of the game was a series of missed oppor
tunities for both teams and either could have won the contest.
Stanford missed a 1-and-1 free throw which could have given the
Cards a four point lead, but Biola missed two outside shots that
would have tied the game.
With just five seconds on the clock Biola tried one last time to
tie the score with an inbounds pass to 6'3" center Laurie Buthuis
but the Cards recovered the fumbled ball and held it until the

buzzer sounded.
