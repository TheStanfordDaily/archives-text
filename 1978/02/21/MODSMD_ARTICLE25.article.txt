# Spikers beat Chico

### Ken Betts 
Stanford's men's volleyball
team upped its conference re
cord to 4-0 with a 15-7, 15-11,
14-16 and 15-11 win over rival
Chico State. Coach Lambert
was positive about the Cards
play. "The team is starting to
come together," he said.
The overall play of the team
was good, with the front line
again supplying the driving
force behind the victory. Frank
Anderson led the front liners
with his well placed spikes and
his timely blocked shots. The
passing, from the defensive
formation, is improving and
this contributed to the more
consistent setting given to the
front line. The defense played
effectively while the offense
tended to be sporadic.
Lambert sounded more op
timistic this weekend than last
as he talked about the play of
his team. "We are going to get
better, and we are now playing
much better than before." He
continued by saying he has
"real hope for this team s im
provement," and that the rest
of the season is going to be
"really exciting." However, as
usual, Lambert did not allow

himself to get euphoric. "We
need to continue to work on
everything," he explained. De
spite the big win over Chico,
Lambert indicated there are
still many weak spots in the
Cards' play. "We need to
spend time on passing, and
especially on covering our hit
ters. We were getting quite a
few spikes blocked back into
our faces and we weren't re
sponding well."
The Cardinals' future oppo
nents will no doubt test Lam
bert's coaching ability. This
weekend Stanford battles
three extremely tough teams:
an Olympic club on Thursday,
the lapanese Collegiate All-
Stars on Friday and Fresno
State on Saturday. Lambert is
concerned about all three
squads, but the Japanese team
will be the Cards' severest test.
Lambert has this to say about
them, "They are an interna
tional team, and they are very,
very good. They play a lot of
volleyball, and to beat them we
will have to do things funda
mentally well." Whatever the
outcome of these matches, this
weekend will be an exciting
one for Stanford volleyball
fans.
