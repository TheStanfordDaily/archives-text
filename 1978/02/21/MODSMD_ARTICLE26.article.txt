## Rugger report 
### 
In a thoroughly open and even rugby game Saturday, Stan
ford's brave lads butted heads with the UC-Santa Barbara rug
gers. After a deadly serious encounter, Stanford I emerged
exhausted but victorious, 8-7. The forwards played with great
passion and strong will and made the Gauchos fight for every inch
of turf.
The first try came after a fine run by Rich Roux who brought the
ball near the Stanford try line where a determined assault by the
forwards hurled John Moller in. The conversion was missed.
There was expressive, enthralling and explosive running by the
backs throughout the game. Santa Barbara scored with a rollick
ing run by its fullback and the half ended in a 4-4 tie.
In the second half Stanford's forwards won more than their
share of line outs, scrums and rucks. They kept the boot firmly on
the neck of their opponents and denied them the goal. Stanford's
winning try was set up by Kevin McCurdy's scrum run which
staggered the Gauchos by its effrontery. He passed off to Gary
Marenzi who twinkled in. With two minutes left, Santa Barbara
scored a penalty kick bringing them to within one point of win
ning, but Stanford held on.
This win continues the Stanford I's undefeated season against
university teams. Next Saturday the I's journey to Los Angeles to
battle a strong UCLA team.
The II and 111 teams were also victorious 32-16 and 14-6.
After each rugby match there is a beer bust where recent
enemies become boozy, bosommy friends. "The game is violent
and exciting," said one player, "but the traditional party after the
game reconciles the gentlemen."
