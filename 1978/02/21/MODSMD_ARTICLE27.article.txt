They made 54 per cent of
their shots from the floor,
ended up with five players in
double figures, collected 27 as
sists and played aggressive de
fense in their 84-72 win over
Stanford Saturday night at
Maples Pavilion, as the Oregon
State Beavers showed why
they're the second-best team
in the Pacific-8.
Against the Cards, forward
Rickey Lee, the only returning
starter, and guard Mark Rad
ford, one of coach Ralph Mil
ler's seven freshmen, paced
the Beavers' attack with 18
points each. But the Beavers
don't rely solely on Lee, their
one bona fide star. Their style
of play emphasizes the mean
ing of the word team.
For instance, two of the
Beavers who scored in double
figures Saturday did not start.
Guard Ray Blume, who missed
his first couple of shots, still
finished five-for-nine from the
floor and had 11 points. For
ward Jeff Stoutt, who is averag
ing just 10 minutes of playing
time per game, came up with
five baskets in 10 tries, includ
ing six straight Beaver points in
the first half.
"I thought OSU did not have
a very good first half," said
Stanford coach Dick Di3iaso,
"and that's when we should
have taken charge ot the
game."
The Cards, behind Jay Car

ter's 16 first-half points, were in
charge for awhile. They led for
most of the first half, and were
up 26-20 five minutes before
half. But then six points by Lee
sparked a Beaver rally that
deadlocked the game at 35-35
at half.
The Beavers took the lead for
good at 40-39 on a jumper by
Radford early in the second
half. The Beavers ran out to a
62-51 advantage with 7:46 to go
before Kimberly Belton, who
scored a Stanford season high
of 31 points, slamdunked to
pull the Cards within 69-66 with
two minutes left.
But Belton was whistled for
hanging onto the rim. Radford
sank the technical, and on the
ensuing inbounds play from
midcourt, Bill McShane broke
loose for a dunk and was
fouled by Belton. The three
point play put OSU up 73-66,
and the Beavers led by seven at
least the rest of the way.
Stanford shot 48 per cent in
the second half, but the Cards
committed 13 turnovers, too.
"I think their defense was just
as aggressive," said Dißiaso.
"We were executing the same.
We just made some mistakes.
"We would be on offense
and score, then they would
come down and score. Then
we would make a turnover and
they would get an easy bas
ket," said Dißiaso.
Stanford's guards had a par
ticularly rough night, combin

ing for two-of-19 from the
floor. "We expected the
press," said Dißiaso. "We
wanted to beat the press and
go inside. All our baskets came
on inside moves. They did a
good job on our guards."
Stanford, now 1-10 in the
Pac-8 and 11-13 overall, will
play Washington Thursday
night in Seattle before taking
on Washington State Saturday
in Pullman.
