### 
Washington (AP) â€” The striking
United Mine Workers and a major
independent coal company reached
a tentative contract settlement yes
terday that could set a pattern for an
industry-wide agreement to end the
77-day coal strike.
The agreement, reached with P&M
Coal Co., a Gulf Oil Corp. subsidiary,
won approval from the union s bar
gaining council on a 26-13 vote fol
lowing a five-hour meeting.
White House Press Secretary Jody
Powell called the vote "an interesting
development which all parties ought
to seriously assess."
There was no immediate response
from the Bituminous Coal Operators
Association, the major industry bar
gaining group which has been un
able to reach agreement with the
UMW.
Legislative intervention possible
Carter administration officials had
cautioned earlier in the day that
major roadblocks remained and
began testing congressional senti
ment for legislation to force an end
to the strike.
Powell said President Jimmy Carter
had not yet decided what course to
take to end the protracted strike, in
dicating that developments could
hinge on the coal industry's reaction
to the P&M contract.
Congressional sources said Labor
Secretary Ray Marshall was drafting
an industry-wide contract proposal
to present to both sides before Car
ter asks Congress for special legisla
tion.
Cool committee reception
Marshall conferred with the
chairmen of the House and Senate

committees which would handle any
legislation to halt the dispute. Con
gressional sources said proposals for
government intervention requiring
legislation received a cool response
from committee members.
After the talks on Capitol Hill, Mar
shall met at the White House with
key administration officials. Sources
said he discussed the possibility of
recommending contract terms to the
industry that would bypass the more
controversial issues until a perma
nent settlement could be reached
among the parties.
This would be regarded as an in
terim solution, the sources said, and

in order to quickly get the mines
back in production while negotiators
continued their talks.
The White House strategy session
was the third in as many days and was
attended briefly by Carter, Vice Pres
ident Walter Mondale, Energy Sec
retary James Schlesinger and others.
Officials said Carter's options for
intervening in the strike include one
or a combination of the following:
invoking the Taft-Hartley Act order
ing miners back to work, seeking
legislation for a temporary federal
seizure of the mines or legislation
imposing binding arbitration to dic
tate contract terms.
