# Nancy White excels nationally

It is difficult enough for a person to
come to Stanford, with its national reputa
tion for competitiveness in both
academics and athletics, and excel in a
sport. But to come here, and not only ex
cel, but also be named to a national team is
an accomplishment few people ever man
age. Nancy White is one of those few.
Last December she was selected to the
women's national field hockey team which
will travel to Barbados and Trinidad next
month. For White, a sophomore from
Maclean, Virginia, making the team was a
culmination of an athletic life devoted to
hard work and a strong desire to achieve.
"I started playing sports in seventh
grade at a private girls school in Virginia,"
she said. "I competed in swimming, track,
basketball, lacrosseand field hockey while
in high school. I love the thrill and excite
ment of sports, and tried to excel in all of
them."
When it came to choosing a college,
however, White ironically considered
sports secondary. "I wasn't going to pick
my school on the primary basis of sports,"
she said. "For if I was, the eastern schools
would definitely be more appealing with
their good field hockey and lacrosse
teams.
"But coming from a girls' school, I
wanted a change of pace and the oppor
tunity to experience a different life style.
The West Coast offered these things, and
since Stanford is a good school with an
excellent women's athletic department, I

chose to come here."
Now in her second year on the Farm,
White participates in lacrosse, field hoc
key and women's track. It was in
November after last season that she tried
out for the national team.
"There are actually two national teams,"
she explained. "One is going to England
and the other to Trinidad. To make either
one, you had to go through different
stages. At first, you started out in the C
group, which consisted of five camps
nationwide of about 80 players each. From
these 60 were chosen for the B camp, and
of these 28 were selected for the national
team — 14 going to England and 14 to
Trinidad."
The team consists of players ranging
from ages 19 to 33, with the majority al
ready out of college. White is among the
three youngest at 19. "There are some
amazing players on the team," she said.
"Most of my teammates are really great
people. I'm really looking forward to play
ing with them."
Of course, as in any team sport, to be
good a team must practice together. White
is therefore flown back to Philadelphia
each weekend to prepare for the Trinidad
games. On March 28, the team goes to
Miami for two weeks of practice in the sun
and then on to Barbados and Trinidad for a
week of games against other national
teams.
"I enjoy all the travel and excitement of
the team," she said. "I've had some great
experiences and met some fascinating

people. Although it does demand a lot of
time, I still manage to do a lot of studying
and keep up a good social life here.
Academics and people are very important
to me."
White is one of the few players on the
team from the West Coast. But, since the
sport is just beginning to develop here,
she sees a time when the West will have
many good players.
"In the East," she said, "there are field
hockey programs in a lot of the schools
and communities. It is a popular girls'
sport there. Here, the sport is less recog
nized, so there are fewer programs for
young girls.
"One of the goals of our team is to
spread hockey to the schools. It is an out
door game that is fast-paced and challeng
ing; and it requires thinking and skill, so I
think it will catch on."
Evidence of its growing popularity came
last fall when San Jose State went to the
semi-finals of the national tournament.
Next year two teams from the West will go
to this tournament. In 1980, field hockey
will be an Olympic sport for the first time.
Does White see herself as a possible
Olympian? "I've always dreamed of going
to the Olympics," she said. "But the road
there is long and difficult. First, our team
has to qualify, and then, I do. But if the
chance is there, I'll definitely make the
most of it."
And since making the most of oppor
tunities is her specialty, her dream may be
fulfilled after all.
