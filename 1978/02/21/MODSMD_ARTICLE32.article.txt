In their first home match of the season, the
Stanford tennis team defeated UC-lrvine 7-2.
Although the Anteaters were missing their
number one player, Stanford was also at a loss
with John McEnroe playing in Maryland, Matt
Mitchell recovering from jet lag after a tourney
in England, Johnny Rast out with the flu, and
Matt Maze suffering from a pulled muscle. Perry
Wright was the only senior on the squad, and
two freshmen, Andy Chase and Jeff Jones, were
playing their first collegiate matches.
Wright played Irvine's Jeff Williams on center
court winning the first set 6-4. However, Wil
liams made it difficult for Wright to develop a
rhythm in the second set and turned the match
around beating Wright 6-4. The third set had the
spectators in awe as Williams hustled to return
almost everything, but Wright stayed calm and
took the match 7-5.
Stanford's Peter Rennert lost his first set 4-6 to
Matt Wooldridge and then, taking command of
the match, won the next two sets 6-4, 6-4. Jim
Hodges, playing number three singles against
Paul Oldenburg, won the first set 6-4, lost the
second set 1-6 and came back to win the match
in the third with a score of 6-1.
Lloyd Bourne had a tough match, narrowly
defeating Anteater Jim Slaught in the first set 7-6,

and trouncing him in the second 6-1. On the
adjacent court, Chase lost his first set to Ron
McNamara 6-7, but went on to win the match
easily 6-0, 6-2. Jones was overhitting and lost to
Irvine's Carlos Hassey 2-6, 1-6.
In doubles, the Cards also came out on top.
Wright and Bourne took their match against Wil
liams and Wooldridge 6-3, 6-0. Rennert and
Hodges beat Oldenburg and Slaught 6-2, 6-1.
And in the final match, Chase and Jones lost to
McNamara and Hassey 2-6, 6-3, 4-6.
Cardinal coach Dick Gould was very pleased
with the team's performance. "Perry played a
great match," he said, "and I was glad to see that
Rennert, Hodges, and Chase were able to come
back and win their matches. Bourne played re
ally good doubles."
Stanford will be playing in the Northern
California Collegiates next week in San Jose, an
event the Cards have won eight years in a row.
Maze, Wright, Rast, Rennert, Hodges and
Bourne are signed up to play. However, without
McEnroe and Mitchell, Gould does not know
how the team will do. He said he is hoping that
Maze will be recovered because the Cards will
be meeting some tough competition against Cal
and San Jose. The Cards were number one in the
nation last year and are looking forward to
another good season.

Wright was the only senior on the squad, and
two freshmen, Andy Chase and Jeff Jones, were
playing their first collegiate matches.
Wright played Irvine's Jeff Williams on center
court winning the first set 6-4. However, Wil
liams made it difficult for Wright to develop a
rhythm in the second set and turned the match
around beating Wright 6-4. The third set had the
spectators in awe as Williams hustled to return
almost everything, but Wright stayed calm and
took the match 7-5.
Stanford's Peter Rennert lost his first set 4-6 to
Matt Wooldridge and then, taking command of
the match, won the next two sets 6-4, 6-4. Jim
Hodges, playing number three singles against
Paul Oldenburg, won the first set 6-4, lost the
second set 1-6 and came back to win the match
in the third with a score of 6-1.
Lloyd Bourne had a tough match, narrowly
defeating Anteater Jim Slaught in the first set 7-6,

and trouncing him in the second 6-1. On the
adjacent court, Chase lost his first set to Ron
McNamara 6-7, but went on to win the match
easily 6-0, 6-2. Jones was overhitting and lost to
Irvine's Carlos Hassey 2-6, 1-6.
In doubles, the Cards also came out on top.
Wright and Bourne took their match against Wil
liams and Wooldridge 6-3, 6-0. Rennert and
Hodges beat Oldenburg and Slaught 6-2, 6-1.
And in the final match, Chase and Jones lost to
McNamara and Hassey 2-6, 6-3, 4-6.
Cardinal coach Dick Gould was very pleased
with the team's performance. "Perry played a
great match," he said, "and I was glad to see that
Rennert, Hodges, and Chase were able to come
back and win their matches. Bourne played re
ally good doubles."
Stanford will be playing in the Northern
California Collegiates next week in San Jose, an
event the Cards have won eight years in a row.
Maze, Wright, Rast, Rennert, Hodges and
Bourne are signed up to play. However, without
McEnroe and Mitchell, Gould does not know
how the team will do. He said he is hoping that
Maze will be recovered because the Cards will
be meeting some tough competition against Cal
and San Jose. The Cards were number one in the
nation last year and are looking forward to
another good season.
In their first home match of the season, the
Stanford tennis team defeated UC-lrvine 7-2.
Although the Anteaters were missing their
number one player, Stanford was also at a loss
with John McEnroe playing in Maryland, Matt
Mitchell recovering from jet lag after a tourney
in England, Johnny Rast out with the flu, and
Matt Maze suffering from a pulled muscle. Perry
