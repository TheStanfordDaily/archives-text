Egypt recalls diplomats from Cyprus
Cairo, Egypt — Egypt decided yesterday to pull its
diplomatic mission out of Cyprus and ask Cypriot dip
lomats to leave Egypt. Hours later, Egyptian commandos
whose raid on a terrorist-held jetliner in Cyprus turned
into a battle with Cypriot troops returned to Cairo and
were welcomed as heroes.
Cyprus refused to turn the two terrorists over to Egypt
and, earlier yesterday, demanded the recall of Cairo s
military attache.
Information Minister Abdel Moneim Sawy said Egypt
would review all aspects of Egyptian-Cypriot relations
because of the "unfriendly stand by the Cyprus gov
ernment, but added that Cairo's action "is neither a
freeze nor a break in relations.
The Middle East News Agency said Egypt is recalling
members of its technical and trade councils in Cyprus.
A pilot on the Cyprus Airways DC-8 told a reporter an
Egyptian military attache apparently gave the signal to
the commandos to launch an airport raid — in defiance
of Cypriot authorities — in an attempt to seize the two
terrorists and rescue their 11 hostages.
In the ensuing gunbattle Sunday night, Cypriot forces
stopped the commando assault, killing 15 Egyptians.
Soviet armies larger than NATO's
London — The British government said yesterday the
Soviet military buildup is outstripping that of the NATO
allies in the air, at sea and on land.
The Labor government report said the Russians are
spending between 11 and 13 per cent of their resources
on the buildup.
"Soviet forces have in many areas been strengthened
in sizeand qualityon a scale which goes well beyond the
need of any purely defensive posture, it said.
Moscow s military capability goes well beyond Europe
into Africa, and the Soviet government is able to deploy
military resources rapidly "in support of its political in
terests in the Third World, the report said.
U.S. defense officials and other NATO leaders have
similarly warned of what they describe as an alarming
build-up of the Soviet arsenal and have called for an
increase in Western military spending.
Senate to hear drug allegations
Washington — A leading critic of the Panama Canal
treaties said yesterday he will move to make public the
tindings of a secret Senate session on allegations that
Panamanian strongman Omar Torrijos and members of
his tamily have been involved in narcotics trafficking.
Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) made the comment after
visiting the Senate Intelligence Committee to examine
the documents that will be presented to the Senate in
the unusual closed session today on the drug trafficking
allegations.
Despite White House and treaty proponents insis
tance that the drug question is not relevant, Dole is
leading what has become a major effort by treaty foes to
block ratification in the Senate by injecting the allega
tions into the debate.
Sen. Charles Percy (R-lll.), a pro-treaty senator who
also studied the documents in the Intelligence Commit

tee office, said he saw "nothing that would have affected
the negotiations" on the treaties.
Brown says foreign gas needed
Los Angeles — Congress' failure to adopt a national
energy policy is jeopardizing California's economic fu
ture by hindering its ability to buy more natural gas from
Canada and Mexico, Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. warned
yesterday.
Brown met with Peter Towe, Canadian ambassador to
the United States, and later said California needs to buy
natural gas from its neighbors both north and south of
the border to continue "its expanding economic activ
ity.
"The future of California is not isolationist, Brown
said. "California's economic well being is inextricably
linked to Canada and Mexico.'
Noting that California now buys 25 per cent of its
natural gas from the Canadian province of Alberta, he
said the state would like to buy even more.
Japan-China trade pact announced
Tokyo — lapanese businessmen have cut a multi
billion-dollar trade deal with China that promises "a new
era" ot economic and political ties between the two
nations as well as important advantages over the United
States and Soviet Union.
The agreement was signed Feb. 16 in Peking after a
year s intensive negotiation. Discussion had been in
itiated by the late Chinese Premier Chou En-Lai even
before Japan and China established diplomatic relations
in 1972.
The pact, which will provide Japanese industrial plants
for China and Chinese oil and coal for Japan, envisages
two-way trade over the next eight years of $20 billion.
Goering suicide note disclosed
Bonn, West Germany — A German newspaper has pub
lished a suicide note attributed to Hermann Goering in
which the Nazi Reichsmarshal told his wife, Emmy, he
would have accepted an Allied firing squad but was
killing himself to escape the indignity of hanging.

force chief and No. 2 man in the Nazi hierarchy wrote the
letter in his prison cell shortly before poisoning himself
on Oct. 15,1946, two hours before the scheduled hang
ing.
The paper did not say how it obtained the letter.
"Death by shooting I would have accepted at any time.
But the Reichamarshal of Germany cannot allow himself
to be hanged, the letter said.
The letter, addressed to "my heart s only love, was
said to have been confiscated by the Allied authorities
who found it in Goering s death row cell at Nuernberg
prison.

Egypt recalls diplomats from Cyprus
Cairo, Egypt — Egypt decided yesterday to pull its
diplomatic mission out of Cyprus and ask Cypriot dip
lomats to leave Egypt. Hours later, Egyptian commandos
whose raid on a terrorist-held jetliner in Cyprus turned
into a battle with Cypriot troops returned to Cairo and
were welcomed as heroes.
Cyprus refused to turn the two terrorists over to Egypt
and, earlier yesterday, demanded the recall of Cairo s
military attache.
Information Minister Abdel Moneim Sawy said Egypt
would review all aspects of Egyptian-Cypriot relations
because of the "unfriendly stand by the Cyprus gov
ernment, but added that Cairo's action "is neither a
freeze nor a break in relations.
The Middle East News Agency said Egypt is recalling
members of its technical and trade councils in Cyprus.
A pilot on the Cyprus Airways DC-8 told a reporter an
Egyptian military attache apparently gave the signal to
the commandos to launch an airport raid — in defiance
of Cypriot authorities — in an attempt to seize the two
terrorists and rescue their 11 hostages.
In the ensuing gunbattle Sunday night, Cypriot forces
stopped the commando assault, killing 15 Egyptians.
Soviet armies larger than NATO's
London — The British government said yesterday the
Soviet military buildup is outstripping that of the NATO
allies in the air, at sea and on land.
The Labor government report said the Russians are
spending between 11 and 13 per cent of their resources
on the buildup.
"Soviet forces have in many areas been strengthened
in sizeand qualityon a scale which goes well beyond the
need of any purely defensive posture, it said.
Moscow s military capability goes well beyond Europe
into Africa, and the Soviet government is able to deploy
military resources rapidly "in support of its political in
terests in the Third World, the report said.
U.S. defense officials and other NATO leaders have
similarly warned of what they describe as an alarming
build-up of the Soviet arsenal and have called for an
increase in Western military spending.
Senate to hear drug allegations
Washington — A leading critic of the Panama Canal
treaties said yesterday he will move to make public the
tindings of a secret Senate session on allegations that
Panamanian strongman Omar Torrijos and members of
his tamily have been involved in narcotics trafficking.
Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) made the comment after
visiting the Senate Intelligence Committee to examine
the documents that will be presented to the Senate in
the unusual closed session today on the drug trafficking
allegations.
Despite White House and treaty proponents insis
tance that the drug question is not relevant, Dole is
leading what has become a major effort by treaty foes to
block ratification in the Senate by injecting the allega
tions into the debate.
Sen. Charles Percy (R-lll.), a pro-treaty senator who
also studied the documents in the Intelligence Commit

tee office, said he saw "nothing that would have affected
the negotiations" on the treaties.
Brown says foreign gas needed
Los Angeles — Congress' failure to adopt a national
energy policy is jeopardizing California's economic fu
ture by hindering its ability to buy more natural gas from
Canada and Mexico, Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. warned
yesterday.
Brown met with Peter Towe, Canadian ambassador to
the United States, and later said California needs to buy
natural gas from its neighbors both north and south of
the border to continue "its expanding economic activ
ity.
"The future of California is not isolationist, Brown
said. "California's economic well being is inextricably
linked to Canada and Mexico.'
Noting that California now buys 25 per cent of its
natural gas from the Canadian province of Alberta, he
said the state would like to buy even more.

for China and Chinese oil and coal for Japan, envisages
two-way trade over the next eight years of $20 billion.

Bonn, West Germany — A German newspaper has pub

which the Nazi Reichsmarshal told his wife, Emmy, he
would have accepted an Allied firing squad but was

Egypt recalls diplomats from Cyprus
Cairo, Egypt — Egypt decided yesterday to pull its
diplomatic mission out of Cyprus and ask Cypriot dip
lomats to leave Egypt. Hours later, Egyptian commandos
whose raid on a terrorist-held jetliner in Cyprus turned
into a battle with Cypriot troops returned to Cairo and
were welcomed as heroes.
Cyprus refused to turn the two terrorists over to Egypt
and, earlier yesterday, demanded the recall of Cairo s
military attache.
Information Minister Abdel Moneim Sawy said Egypt
would review all aspects of Egyptian-Cypriot relations
because of the "unfriendly stand by the Cyprus gov
ernment, but added that Cairo's action "is neither a
freeze nor a break in relations.
The Middle East News Agency said Egypt is recalling
members of its technical and trade councils in Cyprus.
A pilot on the Cyprus Airways DC-8 told a reporter an
Egyptian military attache apparently gave the signal to
the commandos to launch an airport raid — in defiance
of Cypriot authorities — in an attempt to seize the two
terrorists and rescue their 11 hostages.
In the ensuing gunbattle Sunday night, Cypriot forces
stopped the commando assault, killing 15 Egyptians.
Soviet armies larger than NATO's
London — The British government said yesterday the
Soviet military buildup is outstripping that of the NATO
allies in the air, at sea and on land.
The Labor government report said the Russians are
spending between 11 and 13 per cent of their resources
on the buildup.
"Soviet forces have in many areas been strengthened
in sizeand qualityon a scale which goes well beyond the
need of any purely defensive posture, it said.
Moscow s military capability goes well beyond Europe
into Africa, and the Soviet government is able to deploy
military resources rapidly "in support of its political in
terests in the Third World, the report said.
U.S. defense officials and other NATO leaders have
similarly warned of what they describe as an alarming
build-up of the Soviet arsenal and have called for an
increase in Western military spending.
Senate to hear drug allegations
Washington — A leading critic of the Panama Canal
treaties said yesterday he will move to make public the
tindings of a secret Senate session on allegations that
Panamanian strongman Omar Torrijos and members of
his tamily have been involved in narcotics trafficking.
Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) made the comment after
visiting the Senate Intelligence Committee to examine
the documents that will be presented to the Senate in
the unusual closed session today on the drug trafficking
allegations.
Despite White House and treaty proponents insis
tance that the drug question is not relevant, Dole is
leading what has become a major effort by treaty foes to
block ratification in the Senate by injecting the allega
tions into the debate.
Sen. Charles Percy (R-lll.), a pro-treaty senator who
also studied the documents in the Intelligence Commit

tee office, said he saw "nothing that would have affected
the negotiations" on the treaties.
Brown says foreign gas needed
Los Angeles — Congress' failure to adopt a national
energy policy is jeopardizing California's economic fu
ture by hindering its ability to buy more natural gas from
Canada and Mexico, Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. warned
yesterday.
Brown met with Peter Towe, Canadian ambassador to
the United States, and later said California needs to buy
natural gas from its neighbors both north and south of
the border to continue "its expanding economic activ
ity.
"The future of California is not isolationist, Brown
said. "California's economic well being is inextricably
linked to Canada and Mexico.'
Noting that California now buys 25 per cent of its
natural gas from the Canadian province of Alberta, he
said the state would like to buy even more.
Japan-China trade pact announced

era" ot economic and political ties between the two
nations as well as important advantages over the United
States and Soviet Union.
