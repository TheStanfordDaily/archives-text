# Bill Graham dominates
## Concerts here face problems 
### Richard Bowditch 
Bill Graham s domination of con
cert promotion in the Bay Area is the
greatest problem ASSU Special Ev
ents faces according to Mark Curtis,
Special Events director and Vicky
Holt, the University's director of
public events.
Curtis and Special Events promote
and produce the campus rock con
certs, and for the first time, Curtis
said, this year Special Events is
operating as a student service or
ganization staging functions like
ASSU Orientation Night and putting
performers in the Coffee House.
Curtis said that concert promotion
is a three-fold problem. First, one
must get in contact wuh the perfor
mers or their agents. Second, tour
schedules and the University s
schedule must be coordinated, and
third, Curtis said, "There s Bill
Graham.
Stanford upsets Graham
"Graham hates it when Stantord
gets a show, Curtis said. Establish
ing reciprocal relationships between
himself and performers, managers
and agencies is what enables Graham
to maintain his domination of Bay
Area promoting.
About halt of Grahams concerts
lose money, but they serve as in
vestments in the future, Curtis
explained. When Graham produces
a show by a minor act, his agreement
tacitly obligates the performers to
play for him should they make it big.
In this manner the agencies can get
their performers the gigs they want,
and Graham ensures that he gets the
stars.
Curtis said the Grateful Dead is a
case in point. When the band was
lustIust gaining a following in the days ot
Electric kool-Aid and kesey s Acid
Tests, Graham got the Dead its gigs in
high school gyms and dance halls.
Later, he toured the City in his pic
kup with a staple gun tacking up
Dead flyers.
"Now, who are the Dead going to
play for? Curtis asked.
Monopoly
Graham s efficiency and organiza
tion have effectively destroyed any
Bay Area competition. Berkeley Spe
cial Events exists as a doorplate only,
Curtis said, and the ASSU and Morn
ing Sun, another organization, re
main as the only token competition
to Graham.
"The rest of us really have to hus
tle, Vicky Holt said.

Already this year Graham com
mandeered a possible show in
Memorial Auditorium by the Jerry
Garcia Band.
Hard field to plow
People don t like to play colleges,
Curtis said. Everyone we deal with is
a professional; its their lite, they
can t afford to mess up. For them de
aling with students is difficult be
cause students come and go. "In this
job you ve got to be a professional.
Instead of doing business with a
particular act, Curtis said he d rather
establish working relationships with
agencies and managers comparable
to those Graham maintains. He can
book the big bands, he said, but he
can t afford to lose money on the
smaller, lesser-known acts.
If he could continue as director ot
Special Events he could do this, Cur
tis said, but since the position

c hanges hands every year its almost
impossible to establish any kind ot
long-term relationships.
Good year
Nevertheless, Curtis said this year
was a good one for Special Events.
The organization is supposed to op
erate on a non-profit basis and so far
this year it has broken even on its
concerts.
Despite difficulties in obtaining
facilities, and a threat by the Athletic
Department to close Maples Pavilion
to concerts because of the mess in
volved, Curtis said he plans a
number of shows for the spring:
America and Michael Murphey will
play early in April; )erry Jeff Walker,
).). Cale, Stephen Stills, limmy Buf
tett and the Isley Brothers are proba
ble bills, and a concert by George
Benson is possible.

Instead of doing business with a
particular act, Curtis said he d rather
establish working relationships with
agencies and managers comparable
to those Graham maintains. He can
book the big bands, he said, but he
can t afford to lose money on the
smaller, lesser-known acts.
If he could continue as director ot
Special Events he could do this, Cur
tis said, but since the position

c hanges hands every year its almost
impossible to establish any kind ot
long-term relationships.
Good year
Nevertheless, Curtis said this year
was a good one for Special Events.
The organization is supposed to op
erate on a non-profit basis and so far
this year it has broken even on its
concerts.
Despite difficulties in obtaining
facilities, and a threat by the Athletic
Department to close Maples Pavilion
to concerts because of the mess in
volved, Curtis said he plans a
number of shows for the spring:
America and Michael Murphey will
play early in April; )erry Jeff Walker,

Benson is possible.
Bill Graham s domination of con
cert promotion in the Bay Area is the
greatest problem ASSU Special Ev
ents faces according to Mark Curtis,
Special Events director and Vicky
Holt, the University's director of
public events.
Curtis and Special Events promote
and produce the campus rock con
certs, and for the first time, Curtis
said, this year Special Events is
operating as a student service or
ganization staging functions like
ASSU Orientation Night and putting
performers in the Coffee House.
Curtis said that concert promotion
is a three-fold problem. First, one
must get in contact wuh the perfor
mers or their agents. Second, tour
schedules and the University s
schedule must be coordinated, and
third, Curtis said, "There s Bill
Graham.
Stanford upsets Graham
"Graham hates it when Stantord
gets a show, Curtis said. Establish
ing reciprocal relationships between
himself and performers, managers
and agencies is what enables Graham
to maintain his domination of Bay
Area promoting.
About halt of Grahams concerts
lose money, but they serve as in
vestments in the future, Curtis
explained. When Graham produces
a show by a minor act, his agreement
tacitly obligates the performers to
play for him should they make it big.
In this manner the agencies can get
their performers the gigs they want,
and Graham ensures that he gets the
stars.
Curtis said the Grateful Dead is a
case in point. When the band was
lustIust gaining a following in the days ot
Electric kool-Aid and kesey s Acid
Tests, Graham got the Dead its gigs in
high school gyms and dance halls.
Later, he toured the City in his pic
kup with a staple gun tacking up
Dead flyers.
"Now, who are the Dead going to
play for? Curtis asked.
Monopoly
Graham s efficiency and organiza
tion have effectively destroyed any
Bay Area competition. Berkeley Spe
cial Events exists as a doorplate only,
Curtis said, and the ASSU and Morn
ing Sun, another organization, re
main as the only token competition
to Graham.
"The rest of us really have to hus
tle, Vicky Holt said.

Already this year Graham com
mandeered a possible show in
Memorial Auditorium by the Jerry
Garcia Band.

People don t like to play colleges,
