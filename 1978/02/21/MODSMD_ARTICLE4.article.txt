# Guide to research favored by Lyman

### Susan Hart 
In the wake of a report last spring
by the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence that prompted great de
bate on CIA activity in the academic
community, President Richard
Lyman will ask the Faculty Senate to
consider establishing guidelines for
Stanford-CIA relations at its next
meeting,
"The CIA is using several hundred
academics, who . . . (are) providing
leads and on occasion writing books
and other materials to be used for
propaganda purposes abroad," the
senate report said. "These
academics are located at over 100
American colleges, universities and
related institutions.
The American Association of Uni
versity Professors has appealed to 45
colleges and universities, including
Stanford, to adopt guidelines con
cerning university-CIA relations.
Guidelines urged
Discussion of the problem here
began last May when David kraus, a
1974 graduate, appealed to Lyman to
set guidelines for faculty and stu
dents to follow in CIA relations.
"The covert recruitment and man
ipulation of students, Kraus said,
"especially those in the large foreign
student community at Stanford, is
not only a violation of the statutory
prohibition banning the CIA from
domestic operations, but is also im
compatible with a basic sense of trust
and decency which provides the
cornerstone of academic freedom.
He warned that professors, resear
chers and students may unwittingly
be working on CIA projects which
they might normally find " norally
untenable if they were aware of the
funding source and the possible ap
plication of that research.
President replies
Lyman responded in June, calling
Kraus letter "both thoughtful and
timely but adding that University
policy prohibits accepting research
funds unless the identity of the spon
sor is openly acknowledged. He said
CIA projects could have taken place
only in secret and against the Univer
sity policy.
The senate report recognized this

possibility:
"At the majority of the institutions,
no one other than the individual is
aware of the CIA link."
In his lune letter, Lyman warned
that guidelines might inhibit "per
sonal and professional responsibil
ity." Nonetheless, he has apparently
decided now that some sort of
guidelines are necessary.
The University's AAUP chapter
shares the parent organization's
concern about the CIA. Many mem
bers are worried about "the dangers
which the actions of the covert intel
ligence agencies of the United States
pose to the integrity of academic in
stitutions and academic persons,"
said Classics Prof. Mark Edwards,
local AAUP president.
Precedents at Cambridge
Harvard is the only school that has
adopted guidelines so far. Three
main rules were employed at Har
vard:
—a researcher may enter into con
tracts with the CIA provided that
such contracts conform with Har
vard s normal rules and that the con
tract is made public;
—a recruiter for the CIA should
not submit the name of a possible
candidate without prior consent of
that individual, and
—members of the Harvard com
munity should not undertake intelli
gence operations or participate in
propaganda if the activities involve
lending their names and positions to
gain public acceptance for materials
they know to be misleading or un
true.
Debate details undisclosed
Issues surrounding the ClA
university relation debate were pur
portedly so sensitive that the intelli
gence community was able to per
suade the Senate committee to with
hold the details from public view.
Morton Halperin, an official at the
Center for National Security Studies
in Washington, D.C., said he has
found that the schools most heavily
involved with the CIA "usually have
large numbers of foreign students
and foreign affairs studies that give
the faculty international connec
tions.
