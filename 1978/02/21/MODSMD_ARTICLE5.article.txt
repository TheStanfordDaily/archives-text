# 'A world without suffering'
## Lowenstein, McCloskey discuss Carter's stand on human rights 
### John Timpane 
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) and United
Nations Ambassador on Human Rights Allard ). Low
enstein discussed President Carter's stand on human
rights — which both called "a push toward a world
without suffering — Friday night at the Meyer Forum
Room.
An overflow audience, which included singer joan
Baez and lulietta Sagan, local chief of Amnesty Inter
national, heard a congenial and wide-ranging debate
and took part in a spirited question-and-answer ses
sion.
McCloskey praised the principles of Carter s
human rights stance, but criticized the "inconsisten
cies and hypocrisy" of U.S. foreign policy. He cited
the U.S. attitude toward South Korea and the U.S.S.R.
as examples of double standards and abuses of the
Harkin amendment which calls for CoTVgress to cut
off aid to countries that violate international stan
dards of human rights.
It has been used so far to stop aid to Chile, Uruguay
and Ethiopia. McCloskey said, "Known offenders,
such as Brazil and Argentina, continue their oppres
sive regimes.'
Hecharged theCarteradministration with "turning
the other way for the purposes of prosperity or poli
tics. We fear that we'll lose leverage if we're too
moral.
Must face up to Soviets
"Even if the peace of the world requires detente
with the Soviets, we've got to say to them, 'Unless
you treat your people better, we'll decline to grant
you your "most favored nation" status.' '
McCloskey ended on a surprising note, saying that
"Congress, with all our good intentions, must stay
out of the conduct of foreign affairs.

"When it enters in, we deny the President and the
country the ability to properly conduct foreign pol
icy,' McCloskey said.
The new diplomacy
Lowenstein countered with the assertion that
"Congress does have a role to play in foreign rela
tions."
He said it was important for Congress to aid in
recovering from the effects of the policies of the last
two presidents.
"The United Nations is only now emerging from
two administrations where foreign policy has been
abused by the executive branch," Lowenstein said.
The former Stanford professor laid great emphasis
on what hecalled the"newdiplomacy." In a rambling
speech detailing his face-offs with the Soviet Union in
the United Nations and in the Geneva Commission
on Human Rights, he said that Carter diplomats are
now free to speak on their own, without authoriza
tion from Washington. He praised Andrew Young
and other diplomats "who can now communicate
beyond the choreographed rituals of diplomacy."
Both speakers applauded Stanford's past record on
human rights, and urged renewed activity on the
Equal Rights Amendment, Stanford investment in
South African corporations and human rights in gen
eral.
McCloskey said that "the Stanford student body
has been a great leader in human rights," and Low
enstein called Stanford "unique in its commitment"
to human rights.
Lowenstein surprised the audience when he called
on Stanford to sell its stock in corporations involved
in South Africa. He urged students to be aware that
"private citizens in free countries can exert great
pressure."

"The United Nations is only now emerging from
two administrations where foreign policy has been
abused by the executive branch," Lowenstein said.
The former Stanford professor laid great emphasis
on what hecalled the"newdiplomacy." In a rambling
speech detailing his face-offs with the Soviet Union in
the United Nations and in the Geneva Commission
on Human Rights, he said that Carter diplomats are
now free to speak on their own, without authoriza
tion from Washington. He praised Andrew Young
and other diplomats "who can now communicate
beyond the choreographed rituals of diplomacy."
Both speakers applauded Stanford's past record on
human rights, and urged renewed activity on the
Equal Rights Amendment, Stanford investment in
South African corporations and human rights in gen
eral.
McCloskey said that "the Stanford student body
has been a great leader in human rights," and Low
enstein called Stanford "unique in its commitment"
to human rights.
Lowenstein surprised the audience when he called
on Stanford to sell its stock in corporations involved
in South Africa. He urged students to be aware that
"private citizens in free countries can exert great
pressure."

Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) and United
Nations Ambassador on Human Rights Allard ). Low
enstein discussed President Carter's stand on human
rights — which both called "a push toward a world
without suffering — Friday night at the Meyer Forum
Room.
An overflow audience, which included singer joan
Baez and lulietta Sagan, local chief of Amnesty Inter
national, heard a congenial and wide-ranging debate
and took part in a spirited question-and-answer ses
sion.
McCloskey praised the principles of Carter s
human rights stance, but criticized the "inconsisten
cies and hypocrisy" of U.S. foreign policy. He cited
the U.S. attitude toward South Korea and the U.S.S.R.
as examples of double standards and abuses of the
Harkin amendment which calls for CoTVgress to cut
off aid to countries that violate international stan
dards of human rights.
It has been used so far to stop aid to Chile, Uruguay
and Ethiopia. McCloskey said, "Known offenders,
such as Brazil and Argentina, continue their oppres
sive regimes.'
Hecharged theCarteradministration with "turning
the other way for the purposes of prosperity or poli
tics. We fear that we'll lose leverage if we're too
moral.
Must face up to Soviets
"Even if the peace of the world requires detente
with the Soviets, we've got to say to them, 'Unless
you treat your people better, we'll decline to grant
you your "most favored nation" status.' '
McCloskey ended on a surprising note, saying that
"Congress, with all our good intentions, must stay
out of the conduct of foreign affairs.

"When it enters in, we deny the President and the
country the ability to properly conduct foreign pol
icy,' McCloskey said.
The new diplomacy
Lowenstein countered with the assertion that
"Congress does have a role to play in foreign rela
tions."
He said it was important for Congress to aid in
recovering from the effects of the policies of the last
two presidents.
