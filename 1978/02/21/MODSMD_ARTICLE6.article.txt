# Support coal miners' strike
## 
### 
Connie Replogle

The longest strike in the coal min
ers' history is raging today as 160,000
United Mine Workers (UMW) mem
bers go up against the Bituminous
Coal Operators Association (BCOA)
for the third month in a battle over
the next three-year contract.
To the BCOA, the miners' wildcat
strikes and continued resistance
over the past ten years are the major
obstacles in their drive for higher
profits in coal mining. The general
need to wring more work and wealth
out of the workers is more critical
today than ever for the corporate
owners as the U.S. economic crisis
deepens. A better rate of profit can
only come from a stable, docile
workforce.
Beyond this, the example of
thousands of workers fighting back,
defying the courts, rebelling against
the sellouts of the top union officials,
is tremendously threatening to all
the corporate owners.
Workers inspired
It's threatening to them exactly be
cause it's inspiring to workers, many
of whom have rallied to the support
of the miners. Members of the Na
tional United Workers Organization
and others have raised hundreds of
dollars at auto and steel plant gates,
uniting many of those workers whom
the corporate owners would like to
set against the miners by saying that
job layoffs are imminent, thanks to
the miners' strike.
These workers in particular know
that it's the companies themselves
which are responsible for the major
layoffs. In the auto and steel indus
tries in recent years hundreds of
thousands have lost their jobs per
manently due to plant shut down and
automation.
People ought to be outraged by
the impending coal shortages, but
the fault lies with the coal operators
who are literally trying to starve out
the miners and force a contract on
them which would set them back 30
years in terms of benefits, safety and
most other issues.
The fact is that whenever any sec
tion of the people stands up to cor
porate power, thecapitalists jump up
"in defense" of the rest of the people
— pitting workers against school
children, miners against steel work
ers. They steal from us all, then call
some of us the thieves. The only way

to beat their game is to unite against
their efforts to crush and isolate us,
group by group, or even one by one.
Reasons for support
This is why students should sup
port the strike. The miners are today
on the front lines of the battle against
the corporate owners. This is the
same class of people who run our
universities, who make extra profits
off investments in apartheid and off
minorities here, the same ones who
finance Stanford scientists to de
velop nuclear weapons rather than
rational answers to the energy prob
lem. The old miners' song heard in
the movie Harlan County, asks the
question: "Which side are you on?"
The crimes of the capitalists practi
cally dictate the answer.
Why are the miners forced to stay
out on strike so long this time? Not
mainly over wages; each miner has
lost thousands during this strike.
Their major demands concern:
— Health benefits which were won
in 1946 are theatened; with the
BCOA's contract proposal, miners
would have to pay a $200-300 deduc
tible fee for each doctor visit. (Com
bine that with the fact that 1 in 3 min
ers gets black lung, a debilitating and
killing disease.)
— The miners are fighting for the
"right to strike" around local grie
vances, which often means the right
to refuse to go down an unsafe mine.
(Mining disasters make occupational
deaths among miners twice as high
as the rate for police.)
Prevent sellout
If Arnold Miller, the President of
the UMW, successfully sells out the
miners as he is trying to do, their new
contract will bring in the "stability
clause." Part of the clause reads:
"any employee engaging in an unau
thorized work stoppage, picketing
the operations of any signatory
employer, or participating in a sym
pathy strike . . . shall be subject to
disciplining, including discharge."
Even if a miner is not active in or
ganizing a strike but merely honors a
picket line, he could be suspended
for a minimum of 30 days. Any miner
participating in a wildcat strike (one
not authorized by the UMW leader
ship) would be fined $20 per day.
Questions raised
The fact that the miners are now
forced to fight for things they won 30

years ago raises the question to many
miners: Do we and our children and
children's children have to keep
striking for a decent living for the
next thousand years — or can we
overthrow the profit system and set
up a new society?
This question is raised all the more
sharply as miners see that they're not
just up against the coal operators,
but also their courts, cops, military
and political cohorts. For example,
the military is now being used as scab
labor in some mines; and the recent
threat by President Jimmy Carter to
invoke the Taft-Hartley Act has raised
the spector of the use of the National
Guard's bayonnets to break the
strike for the BCOA.
For all Americans this should make
clear the fact that the ruling class will
cast aside the people's "democratic
rights" when their fundamental in
terests of profit are really threatened.
Sympathizing with poorer workers
is not the main reason we should
support the strike. These people are
waging one of the most courageous
fights yet seen against the same class
that stands in the way of a decent
future for us all.

Prevent sellout
If Arnold Miller, the President of
the UMW, successfully sells out the
miners as he is trying to do, their new
contract will bring in the "stability
clause." Part of the clause reads:
"any employee engaging in an unau
thorized work stoppage, picketing
the operations of any signatory
employer, or participating in a sym
pathy strike . . . shall be subject to
disciplining, including discharge."
Even if a miner is not active in or
ganizing a strike but merely honors a
picket line, he could be suspended
for a minimum of 30 days. Any miner
participating in a wildcat strike (one
not authorized by the UMW leader
ship) would be fined $20 per day.
Questions raised
The fact that the miners are now
forced to fight for things they won 30

years ago raises the question to many
miners: Do we and our children and
children's children have to keep
striking for a decent living for the
next thousand years — or can we
overthrow the profit system and set
up a new society?
This question is raised all the more
sharply as miners see that they're not
just up against the coal operators,
but also their courts, cops, military
and political cohorts. For example,
the military is now being used as scab
labor in some mines; and the recent
threat by President Jimmy Carter to
invoke the Taft-Hartley Act has raised
the spector of the use of the National
Guard's bayonnets to break the
strike for the BCOA.
For all Americans this should make
clear the fact that the ruling class will
cast aside the people's "democratic
rights" when their fundamental in
terests of profit are really threatened.
Sympathizing with poorer workers
is not the main reason we should
support the strike. These people are
waging one of the most courageous
fights yet seen against the same class
that stands in the way of a decent
future for us all.

The longest strike in the coal min
ers' history is raging today as 160,000
United Mine Workers (UMW) mem
bers go up against the Bituminous
Coal Operators Association (BCOA)
for the third month in a battle over
the next three-year contract.
To the BCOA, the miners' wildcat
strikes and continued resistance
over the past ten years are the major
obstacles in their drive for higher
profits in coal mining. The general
need to wring more work and wealth
out of the workers is more critical
today than ever for the corporate
owners as the U.S. economic crisis
deepens. A better rate of profit can
only come from a stable, docile
workforce.
Beyond this, the example of
thousands of workers fighting back,
defying the courts, rebelling against
the sellouts of the top union officials,
is tremendously threatening to all
the corporate owners.
Workers inspired
It's threatening to them exactly be
cause it's inspiring to workers, many
of whom have rallied to the support
of the miners. Members of the Na
tional United Workers Organization
and others have raised hundreds of
dollars at auto and steel plant gates,
uniting many of those workers whom
the corporate owners would like to
set against the miners by saying that
job layoffs are imminent, thanks to
the miners' strike.
These workers in particular know
that it's the companies themselves
which are responsible for the major
layoffs. In the auto and steel indus
tries in recent years hundreds of
thousands have lost their jobs per
manently due to plant shut down and
automation.
People ought to be outraged by
the impending coal shortages, but
the fault lies with the coal operators
who are literally trying to starve out
the miners and force a contract on
them which would set them back 30
years in terms of benefits, safety and
most other issues.
The fact is that whenever any sec
tion of the people stands up to cor
porate power, thecapitalists jump up
"in defense" of the rest of the people
— pitting workers against school
children, miners against steel work
ers. They steal from us all, then call
some of us the thieves. The only way

to beat their game is to unite against
their efforts to crush and isolate us,
group by group, or even one by one.
Reasons for support
This is why students should sup
port the strike. The miners are today
on the front lines of the battle against
the corporate owners. This is the
same class of people who run our
universities, who make extra profits
off investments in apartheid and off
minorities here, the same ones who
finance Stanford scientists to de
velop nuclear weapons rather than
rational answers to the energy prob
lem. The old miners' song heard in
the movie Harlan County, asks the
question: "Which side are you on?"
The crimes of the capitalists practi
cally dictate the answer.
Why are the miners forced to stay
out on strike so long this time? Not
mainly over wages; each miner has
lost thousands during this strike.
Their major demands concern:
— Health benefits which were won
in 1946 are theatened; with the
BCOA's contract proposal, miners
would have to pay a $200-300 deduc
tible fee for each doctor visit. (Com
bine that with the fact that 1 in 3 min
ers gets black lung, a debilitating and
killing disease.)
— The miners are fighting for the
"right to strike" around local grie
vances, which often means the right
to refuse to go down an unsafe mine.

deaths among miners twice as high

automation.
People ought to be outraged by
the impending coal shortages, but
the fault lies with the coal operators
who are literally trying to starve out
the miners and force a contract on
them which would set them back 30
years in terms of benefits, safety and
most other issues.
The fact is that whenever any sec
tion of the people stands up to cor
porate power, thecapitalists jump up
"in defense" of the rest of the people
— pitting workers against school
children, miners against steel work
ers. They steal from us all, then call
some of us the thieves. The only way

to beat their game is to unite against
their efforts to crush and isolate us,
group by group, or even one by one.
Reasons for support
This is why students should sup
port the strike. The miners are today
on the front lines of the battle against
the corporate owners. This is the
same class of people who run our
universities, who make extra profits
off investments in apartheid and off
minorities here, the same ones who
finance Stanford scientists to de
velop nuclear weapons rather than
rational answers to the energy prob
lem. The old miners' song heard in
the movie Harlan County, asks the
question: "Which side are you on?"
The crimes of the capitalists practi
cally dictate the answer.
Why are the miners forced to stay
out on strike so long this time? Not
mainly over wages; each miner has
lost thousands during this strike.
Their major demands concern:
— Health benefits which were won
in 1946 are theatened; with the
BCOA's contract proposal, miners
would have to pay a $200-300 deduc
tible fee for each doctor visit. (Com
bine that with the fact that 1 in 3 min
ers gets black lung, a debilitating and
killing disease.)
— The miners are fighting for the
"right to strike" around local grie
vances, which often means the right
to refuse to go down an unsafe mine.
(Mining disasters make occupational
deaths among miners twice as high
as the rate for police.)
Prevent sellout
If Arnold Miller, the President of
the UMW, successfully sells out the
miners as he is trying to do, their new
contract will bring in the "stability
clause." Part of the clause reads:
"any employee engaging in an unau
thorized work stoppage, picketing
the operations of any signatory
employer, or participating in a sym
pathy strike . . . shall be subject to
disciplining, including discharge."
Even if a miner is not active in or
ganizing a strike but merely honors a
picket line, he could be suspended
for a minimum of 30 days. Any miner
participating in a wildcat strike (one
not authorized by the UMW leader
ship) would be fined $20 per day.
Questions raised
The fact that the miners are now
forced to fight for things they won 30

years ago raises the question to many
miners: Do we and our children and
children's children have to keep
striking for a decent living for the
next thousand years — or can we
overthrow the profit system and set
up a new society?
This question is raised all the more
sharply as miners see that they're not
just up against the coal operators,
but also their courts, cops, military
and political cohorts. For example,
the military is now being used as scab
labor in some mines; and the recent
threat by President Jimmy Carter to
invoke the Taft-Hartley Act has raised
the spector of the use of the National
Guard's bayonnets to break the
strike for the BCOA.
For all Americans this should make
clear the fact that the ruling class will
cast aside the people's "democratic
rights" when their fundamental in
terests of profit are really threatened.
Sympathizing with poorer workers
is not the main reason we should
support the strike. These people are
waging one of the most courageous
fights yet seen against the same class
that stands in the way of a decent
future for us all.

The longest strike in the coal min
ers' history is raging today as 160,000
United Mine Workers (UMW) mem
bers go up against the Bituminous
Coal Operators Association (BCOA)
for the third month in a battle over
the next three-year contract.
To the BCOA, the miners' wildcat
strikes and continued resistance
over the past ten years are the major
obstacles in their drive for higher
profits in coal mining. The general
need to wring more work and wealth
out of the workers is more critical
today than ever for the corporate
owners as the U.S. economic crisis
deepens. A better rate of profit can
only come from a stable, docile
workforce.
Beyond this, the example of
thousands of workers fighting back,
defying the courts, rebelling against
the sellouts of the top union officials,
is tremendously threatening to all
the corporate owners.
Workers inspired
It's threatening to them exactly be
cause it's inspiring to workers, many
of whom have rallied to the support
of the miners. Members of the Na
tional United Workers Organization
and others have raised hundreds of
dollars at auto and steel plant gates,
uniting many of those workers whom
the corporate owners would like to
set against the miners by saying that
job layoffs are imminent, thanks to
the miners' strike.
These workers in particular know
that it's the companies themselves
which are responsible for the major
layoffs. In the auto and steel indus
tries in recent years hundreds of
thousands have lost their jobs per
manently due to plant shut down and
automation.
People ought to be outraged by
the impending coal shortages, but
the fault lies with the coal operators
who are literally trying to starve out
