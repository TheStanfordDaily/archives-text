# Failure of academic advising goes on Greg Larson
## 
### 
There can be little doubt that
academic advising is one of Stan
ford's institutional failures. Though
based on such desirable goals as aid
ing students and providing closer
contact between faculty and under
graduates, its history has not been
one of success.
Since the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) in the late 19605, the
difficulties of advising have been
identified and quantified. What fol
lows is a brief summary of some of
that material:
In winter quarter of 1974, the
Bridge and the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs surveyed 613 ran
domly selected students in hopes of
identifying their reaction to various
sources of personal help. Out of 16
offices and services cited by the stu
dent respondents in the survey's
open-ended questions, academic
advising was mentioned fourth most .
frequently.
Of the large number citing advis
ing however, only 26 per cent did so
favorably; i.e., 74 per cent of the re
sponses were complaints about the
quality of advising. The final result of
this study was that academic advising
received the third lowest ranking of
all 16 offices and services cited by the
students.
In a survey of graduating seniors
(40 per cent response rate) con
ducted by the Dean of Under
graduate Studies last Spring, advising
received equally discouraging
marks. Of the 47 items on the ques
tionnaire, freshperson advising re
ceived the lowest average response

(2.2l on a scale of 5.0) and major ad
vising placed ninth lowest (3.15).
Nationwide dissatisfaction
That Stanford students are dissatis
fied with the advising they have re
ceived is obvious from the above
studies. Vet this problem is not one
peculiar to Stanford.
In the Summer 1977 edition of the
Education Record, Morstain and Gaff
reported, "sixty per cent of the re
sponding students indicated that the
quality of advising needed improv
ing." The importance of this study is
due to its large sample; 3409 re
sponses were received by students at
17 different colleges and universities
in various states.
That advising is a major problem
not only at Stanford, but nationally as
well, suggests one of two conclu
sions: (1) the problem is intractable
and no solution to it may ever be
found, or (2) the problem is such that
traditional remedial actions are in
sufficient, and a creative approach is
needed.
New survey issued
The ASSU Commission on Advis
ing, comprised of 20 students operat
ing under the auspices of the Council
of Presidents, is hoping to take the
latter approach to solving the prob
lems of advising at Stanford.
Our first task is to identify exactly
what the market demands; that is, to
ascertain what students want and ex
pect from advising. To accomplish
this, we have just mailed a question
naire to 300 randomly selected
sophomores, juniors, and seniors.
For those who have received their

questionnaires, we wish to urge
them to complete the form as soon as
possible to ensure that we obtain a
statistically valid sample. The ques
tionnaires should be returned to
ASSU (on the 2nd floor of Tresidder
Union) no later than Wednesday,
Feb. 22.
The evaluation of advising is a dif
ficult project, since advising itself is
so complex. Certainly the advising
received by a first year student in
terested in the humanities should be
different from that received by a
senior honors student in applied
physics.
Fresh approach outlined
Therefore, to analyze the prob
lems of advising, we have found it
best to dissect the issue in terms of
one's academic development. With
this breakdown, three different
types of advising, all servingdifferent
needs, have been identified:
(1) General advising one's first year
at Stanford,
(2) General advising one's second
year at Stanford but prior to declar

ing a major, and
(3) Advising after declaring a
major.
Which type of advising is worst?
What can be done to improve any
particular type of advising, or the ad
vising process as a whole? These are
questions which the Commission on
Advising will be dealing with in the
next month and, hopefully, some of
the answers will be found in our sur
vey.

favorably; i.e., 74 per cent of the re
sponses were complaints about the
quality of advising. The final result of
this study was that academic advising
received the third lowest ranking of
all 16 offices and services cited by the
students.
In a survey of graduating seniors
(40 per cent response rate) con
ducted by the Dean of Under
graduate Studies last Spring, advising
received equally discouraging
marks. Of the 47 items on the ques
tionnaire, freshperson advising re
ceived the lowest average response

(2.2l on a scale of 5.0) and major ad
vising placed ninth lowest (3.15).
Nationwide dissatisfaction
That Stanford students are dissatis
fied with the advising they have re
ceived is obvious from the above
studies. Vet this problem is not one
peculiar to Stanford.
In the Summer 1977 edition of the
Education Record, Morstain and Gaff
reported, "sixty per cent of the re
sponding students indicated that the
quality of advising needed improv
ing." The importance of this study is
due to its large sample; 3409 re
sponses were received by students at
17 different colleges and universities
in various states.
That advising is a major problem
not only at Stanford, but nationally as
well, suggests one of two conclu
sions: (1) the problem is intractable
and no solution to it may ever be
found, or (2) the problem is such that
traditional remedial actions are in
sufficient, and a creative approach is
needed.
New survey issued
The ASSU Commission on Advis
ing, comprised of 20 students operat
ing under the auspices of the Council
of Presidents, is hoping to take the
latter approach to solving the prob
lems of advising at Stanford.
Our first task is to identify exactly
what the market demands; that is, to
ascertain what students want and ex
pect from advising. To accomplish
this, we have just mailed a question
naire to 300 randomly selected
sophomores, juniors, and seniors.
For those who have received their

questionnaires, we wish to urge
them to complete the form as soon as
possible to ensure that we obtain a
statistically valid sample. The ques
tionnaires should be returned to
ASSU (on the 2nd floor of Tresidder
Union) no later than Wednesday,
Feb. 22.
The evaluation of advising is a dif
ficult project, since advising itself is
so complex. Certainly the advising
received by a first year student in
terested in the humanities should be
different from that received by a
senior honors student in applied
physics.
Fresh approach outlined
Therefore, to analyze the prob
lems of advising, we have found it
best to dissect the issue in terms of
one's academic development. With
this breakdown, three different
types of advising, all servingdifferent
needs, have been identified:
(1) General advising one's first year
at Stanford,
(2) General advising one's second
year at Stanford but prior to declar

ing a major, and
(3) Advising after declaring a
major.
Which type of advising is worst?
What can be done to improve any
particular type of advising, or the ad
vising process as a whole? These are
questions which the Commission on
Advising will be dealing with in the
next month and, hopefully, some of
the answers will be found in our sur
vey.

Presidents.)
There can be little doubt that
academic advising is one of Stan
ford's institutional failures. Though
based on such desirable goals as aid
ing students and providing closer
contact between faculty and under
graduates, its history has not been
one of success.
Since the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) in the late 19605, the
difficulties of advising have been
identified and quantified. What fol
lows is a brief summary of some of
that material:
In winter quarter of 1974, the
Bridge and the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs surveyed 613 ran
domly selected students in hopes of
identifying their reaction to various
sources of personal help. Out of 16
offices and services cited by the stu
dent respondents in the survey's
open-ended questions, academic
advising was mentioned fourth most .
frequently.
Of the large number citing advis
ing however, only 26 per cent did so
favorably; i.e., 74 per cent of the re
sponses were complaints about the
quality of advising. The final result of
this study was that academic advising
received the third lowest ranking of
all 16 offices and services cited by the
