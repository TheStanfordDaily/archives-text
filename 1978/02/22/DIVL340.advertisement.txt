TERADYNE —AN INDUSTRY LEADER I
Teradyne, Inc., with 1400 employees and annual sales of about $60 million,
is the world's largest company specializing in the design and manufacture of
automatic test equipment for the electronics industry and the many other
industries now using electronic devices. We are an international company,
with sales, service, and applications centers located throughout the United \
States, Europe, and Japan. Headquarters and main plant are in Boston, Mass
achusetts, and we also design and manufacture test equipment in the Los
Angeles, California and Chicago, Illinois areas.
THE TERADYNE CHALLENGE
Before our customers can start mass-producing their newly designed, state-of
the-art memory, LSI, and linear devices, or their complex analog and digital
printed-circuit boards, they have to be prepared to test them in high volume.
That's where Teradyne comes in. The challenge is in being able to foresee
testing needs far in advance, then design and produce test systems that
can meet those needs under the most stringent demands of the production
environment. That requires foresight, imagination, and especially top-notch
engineering.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE AT TERADYNE
Despite our size and scope, there is a difference at Teradyne. We've been
able to maintain a responsive, personalized atmosphere that is conducive to
professional creativity and the development of high technology.
Titles are not everything at Teradyne; who reports to whom is rarely of inter
est to anyone beyond the people involved. We're confident that we're going
to become bigger still, but we're going to do it without sacrificing the values
that mark our company.
There is another difference at Teradyne. You can put it down that we're the
very best at what we do. That's largely due to our ability to attract and retain
the finest professional staff in the industry.
To stay the best requires an expanding pool of talent — innovative, energetic
self-starters — people with vision, intelligence, and the skill to work in high
level technology.
If you want involvement with state-of-the-art design and applications, you
may be interested in positions available in Boston, the Northern Los Angeles
or Chicago areas.
To discuss these opportunities, make an appointment to see our representa
tives on campus.

Jerry Cellner, Personnel Manager, or call collect at 213-993-1343.
