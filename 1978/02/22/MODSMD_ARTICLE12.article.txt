# Human rights plowed
## Israelis overlooked in forum 
### 
Patricia Nabti

On Friday, Feb. 17 I attended the
Stanford forum on Human Rights
sponsored by SCOPE (Stanford
Committee on Political Education). I
was deeply disappointed in our am
bassador for human rights, Al Low
enstein. Throughout his opening
remarks Ambassador Lowenstein
emphasized that human rights viola
tions in every country must be talked
about openly, and he noted how he
even mentioned some of our own
violations when he addressed inter
national discussions.
Yet, where Israel was concerned,
he was totally evasive, as if Israel is
either not guilty of such violations or
is, for other reasons, above re

proach. The first question from the
audience asked how our govern
ment could justify sending arms to
Israel, which in turn are being sent to
Ethiopia to participate with Soviet
and Cuban arms to commit open ag
gression against Somalia. While the
ambassador was willing to respond
to the issue of Soviet involvement,
he neatly hedged the issueot Israel
And then I was acknowledged I
reiterated the ambassador's com
ments that violations of human
rights are committed throughout
the world. But I claimed that Israel
is a special case. The United States
does not give any country other
than Israel over $2 billion in aid an
nually. (This is a $10 assessment for
every Israeli man, woman and
child.)
I noted that the International Red
Cross, Amnesty International, the
National Lawyers' Guild, the London
Times, the Swiss League for Human
Rights, and other groups have made
independent studies which all ac
cuse Israel of constant, numerous,
blatant, and severe violations of the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, especially in the occupied
Arab territories.
I asked the ambassador what is the
United States government doing
about this? He responded by discus
sing the human rights violations in
various Arab countries.
It is frustrating, as I noted later in
the proceedings, how evasive most

people are on this issue. One can
easily concede that the Arab coun
tries have committed numerous and
appalling violations of human rights
which must be addressed squarely
and honestly.
However, the United States is not
giving any Arab state the almost un
limited support that we give Israel,
justifying that support on the basis
that Israel is supposedly one ot the
world's greatest democracies
Is the issue of human rights onlv to
be brought up to chastise our
enemies or can we stand up to our
allies as well and openly and
courageously ask them to be ac
countable for their record on human
rights? I find our ambassador's unwil
lingness to do the latter both hypoc
ritical and irresponsible.
Let us criticize the Arabs for their
transgressions on human dignity.
And let us reproach Israel, who is
presented as a shining example of
democracy and the embodiment of
human ideals, for that which is re
proachable and dehumanizing.
Ambassador Lowenstein noted
that Americans can thank those who
criticized us thirty years ago for our
treatment of the blacks, noting that
world opinion contributed to our
progress on that issue. Can't we do
such a service to our closest ally?

On Friday, Feb. 17 I attended the
Stanford forum on Human Rights
sponsored by SCOPE (Stanford
Committee on Political Education). I
was deeply disappointed in our am
bassador for human rights, Al Low
enstein. Throughout his opening
remarks Ambassador Lowenstein
emphasized that human rights viola
tions in every country must be talked
about openly, and he noted how he
even mentioned some of our own
violations when he addressed inter
national discussions.
Yet, where Israel was concerned,
he was totally evasive, as if Israel is
either not guilty of such violations or
is, for other reasons, above re

proach. The first question from the
audience asked how our govern
ment could justify sending arms to
Israel, which in turn are being sent to
Ethiopia to participate with Soviet
and Cuban arms to commit open ag
gression against Somalia. While the
ambassador was willing to respond
to the issue of Soviet involvement,
he neatly hedged the issueot Israel
And then I was acknowledged I
reiterated the ambassador's com
ments that violations of human
rights are committed throughout
the world. But I claimed that Israel
is a special case. The United States
does not give any country other
than Israel over $2 billion in aid an
nually. (This is a $10 assessment for
every Israeli man, woman and
child.)
I noted that the International Red
Cross, Amnesty International, the
National Lawyers' Guild, the London
Times, the Swiss League for Human
Rights, and other groups have made
independent studies which all ac
cuse Israel of constant, numerous,
blatant, and severe violations of the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, especially in the occupied
Arab territories.
I asked the ambassador what is the
United States government doing
about this? He responded by discus
sing the human rights violations in
various Arab countries.
It is frustrating, as I noted later in
the proceedings, how evasive most

people are on this issue. One can
easily concede that the Arab coun
tries have committed numerous and
appalling violations of human rights
which must be addressed squarely
and honestly.
However, the United States is not
giving any Arab state the almost un
limited support that we give Israel,
justifying that support on the basis
that Israel is supposedly one ot the
world's greatest democracies
Is the issue of human rights onlv to
be brought up to chastise our
enemies or can we stand up to our
allies as well and openly and
courageously ask them to be ac
countable for their record on human
rights? I find our ambassador's unwil
lingness to do the latter both hypoc
ritical and irresponsible.
Let us criticize the Arabs for their
transgressions on human dignity.
And let us reproach Israel, who is
presented as a shining example of
democracy and the embodiment of
human ideals, for that which is re
proachable and dehumanizing.
Ambassador Lowenstein noted
that Americans can thank those who
criticized us thirty years ago for our
treatment of the blacks, noting that
world opinion contributed to our
progress on that issue. Can't we do
such a service to our closest ally?
