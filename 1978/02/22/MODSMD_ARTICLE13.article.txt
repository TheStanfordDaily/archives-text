# Conservation bolstered
## Pinkerton, Rose

The United States and the rest of
the world have made a great invest
ment in petroleum, natural gas, and
coal. In the last century, we have
changed from 90 per cent renewable
energy sources to a 94 per cent de
pendence on non-renewable fossil
fuels. This investment has brought
modern society many benefits —
adequate food, great mobility, com
fortable homes, and a decreased
death rate. (However, the latter has
resulted in a population explosion.)
Unfortunately, the price of energy
has risen 100 per cent in the last ten
years, and this has caused the price
of everything else to rise. There are
several reasons for this:
— Supplies are running low and
production costs are up, but more
importantly, energy industries
realize they can charge whatever
they want for this vital service.
— There is much waste in our cen
tralized distribution methods.
— We over-rely on electricity for
uses we don't really need electricity
for, and other losses in conversion
between energy forms.
Despite this, conservation efforts
in this country have been minimal
and have been meeting reisistance
from many vested interest groups.
Utility rate structures have been de
signed to reward large usage instead
of conservation. It is embarrassing to
know that in 1970 the United States
wasted more energy than two-thirds
of the world used.
Perhaps our real energy shortage is
our failure to design systems to man
age the use of energy efficiently. Our
best energy resource is conserva
tion.
Conservation does not imply cur
tailment and a lower standard of liv
ing; it is merely the elimination of
waste. West Germany, Switzerland,
and Sweden have an equal standard
of living to the United States, yet use
only 60 per cent of the energy per
capita. Sweden accomplishes this

through co-generation of one-third
of all waste heat from its factories,
district heating, smaller dwelling
size, smaller cars, hydropower, and
other conservation practices.
Denis Hayes, energy specialist
for the World Watch Institute, exp
lains, "Curtailment means a cold
house, conservation means a well
insulated house with an efficient
heating system. Curtailment implies
getting rid of autos, conservation
means buying a smaller or better
mileage car next time."
We use twice as much energy as
we need to maintain our standard of
living; this does not even assume the
use of alternative energy sources.
Conservation can be the turning
point for a transformation of society
to less waste and more attention to
human needs and the environment.
The value changes necessary for this
kind of transformation are not always
easy, but they are certainly easier
than not doing anything about our
problems.
Conscientious individuals might
want to consider these measures to
conserve energy:
— Try to get good gas mileage,
carpool, buy a high-mileage car,
bicycle, walk, or take a bus if possi
ble.
— Insulate your home, including
hot water pipes; reduce lighting if
possible or share a light.
— Recycle and/or use less of all
materials, including water.
— Start a garden or buy fresh un
processed foods.
— Support publicly issues relating
to conservation and alternative
energy sources.
Who knows, our society may even
suffer some of the side effects of
conservation — such as improved
health through better diet, more
exercise, and less pollution.
