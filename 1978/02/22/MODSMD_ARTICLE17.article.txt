# Buildering gains popularity
## Students are climbing walls for amusement, sport 
### Jill Liscom 
"Buildering is a sport where
you pick the hardest, most dif
ficult way to get nowhere, and
it gives you great satisfaction.
It's completely absurd, but
reallya lot of fun," said Jim Col
lins, builderer and founder of
the Alpine Club.
According to Collins, about
10students heredo buildering,
and almost all are members of
the Alpine Club, a student club
that teaches rock climbing and
mountaineering.
Although buildering is a
separate sport from rock climb

ing, almost all builderers are
also rock climbers, and many
began buildering in order to
stay in shape for climbing.
Best place
"Stanford is probably the
best over-all place for builder
ing anywhere," said Collins,
because the walls are "very
much like actual sand stone
climbing."
Almost all buildering in
volves moving horizontally in
stead of vertically up buildings
and walls, said Collins. The
University requires that the
builderer's feet must stay

within three or four feet of the
ground because of the liability
involved, Collins added.
"The moves near the ground
are just as difficult as the moves
in the air," explained Collins.
"But it's a very safe sport."
Balance
Balance is very important in
this sport, said Collins. The
moves involved not only
strength, but swinging one's
body the correct way as well.
Finger strength, flexibility and
endurance are also important
skills, Collins explained.
In addition, "there is a lot of

creativity in looking at a wall
and saying a problem could go
there," commented Collins.
A "problem" in buildering is
a sequence of moves to get
from one place to another,
such as when climbing over an
arch.
Most difficult
The traverse on the Stanford
art gallery is the most difficult
problem that has been done
here, said Collins. "Hoover
will probably never be buil
dered using just hands and
feet," he said, "because it
doesn't have proper footh
olds."
Builderers have no special
outfits except for their shoes,
which are rock climbing shoes
with treaded rubber soles. The
soles can either be soft for flex
ibility or stiff for better sup
port.
Builderers also carry tooth
brushes for brushing off dust
from the walls, and special
chalk to put on their hands.
Both of these aids help pre
vent fingers from slipping.
Existentialism
Collinsand Alpine Club Pres
ident Luke Erdoes said they
often get comments from
people on campus who spot
them buildering. Their reac
tions range from that of a
foreign student who asked, "Is
this some kind of crazy new

American sport?" to that of a
philosophy professor who en
quired if this is "the ultimate
existentialist activity."
"Isn't it a little early in the
quarter to be climbing the
walls?" is another typical pun,
added Erdoes.
For Erdoes, however, buil
dering is "a really cleansing ac
tivity."
Concentration
"It's a very good mental re
leasing activity because you are
concentrating on one second
at a time, complete total con
centration at one moment, not

thinkingabout the past or what
you have to do in the future,
explained Collins.
It's also a matter of personal
expression, said Collins.
"When you do a problem you
also want to see how nicely you
can do it and be in complete
control of what's going on.
The buildering problems
here each have a name, which
is made up by the first person
to do the problem. The names
are usually related to the loca
tion or character of the prob
lem, such as "Torture

Chamber," "Finger Fryer," and
"Grandmother's Challenge."
Stairway to heaven
Collins recatted when he first
climbed an archway next to
Memorial Church and decided
to name it "Stairway to
Heaven."
"I was straddled across the
arch when a priest walked out,
looked up at me with a strange
expression on his face, and I
said, 'Oh, don't mind me,
Father — I'm on a stairway to
heaven.' Unfortunately, he
didn't think it was very funny."

and walls, said Collins. The
University requires that the
builderer's feet must stay

within three or four feet of the
ground because of the liability
involved, Collins added.
"The moves near the ground
are just as difficult as the moves
in the air," explained Collins.
"But it's a very safe sport."
Balance
Balance is very important in
this sport, said Collins. The
moves involved not only
strength, but swinging one's
body the correct way as well.
Finger strength, flexibility and
endurance are also important
skills, Collins explained.
In addition, "there is a lot of

creativity in looking at a wall
and saying a problem could go
there," commented Collins.
A "problem" in buildering is
a sequence of moves to get
from one place to another,
such as when climbing over an
arch.
Most difficult
The traverse on the Stanford
art gallery is the most difficult
problem that has been done
here, said Collins. "Hoover
will probably never be buil
dered using just hands and
feet," he said, "because it
doesn't have proper footh
olds."
Builderers have no special
outfits except for their shoes,
which are rock climbing shoes
with treaded rubber soles. The
soles can either be soft for flex
ibility or stiff for better sup
port.
Builderers also carry tooth
brushes for brushing off dust
from the walls, and special
chalk to put on their hands.
Both of these aids help pre
vent fingers from slipping.
Existentialism
Collinsand Alpine Club Pres
ident Luke Erdoes said they
often get comments from
people on campus who spot
them buildering. Their reac
tions range from that of a
foreign student who asked, "Is
this some kind of crazy new

American sport?" to that of a
philosophy professor who en
quired if this is "the ultimate
existentialist activity."
"Isn't it a little early in the
quarter to be climbing the
walls?" is another typical pun,
added Erdoes.
For Erdoes, however, buil
dering is "a really cleansing ac
tivity."
Concentration
"It's a very good mental re
leasing activity because you are
concentrating on one second
at a time, complete total con
centration at one moment, not

thinkingabout the past or what
you have to do in the future,
explained Collins.
It's also a matter of personal
expression, said Collins.
"When you do a problem you
also want to see how nicely you
can do it and be in complete
control of what's going on.
The buildering problems
here each have a name, which
is made up by the first person
to do the problem. The names
are usually related to the loca
tion or character of the prob
lem, such as "Torture

Chamber," "Finger Fryer," and
"Grandmother's Challenge."
Stairway to heaven
Collins recatted when he first
climbed an archway next to
Memorial Church and decided
to name it "Stairway to
Heaven."
"I was straddled across the
arch when a priest walked out,
looked up at me with a strange
expression on his face, and I
said, 'Oh, don't mind me,
Father — I'm on a stairway to
heaven.' Unfortunately, he
didn't think it was very funny."

"Buildering is a sport where
you pick the hardest, most dif
ficult way to get nowhere, and
it gives you great satisfaction.
It's completely absurd, but
reallya lot of fun," said Jim Col
lins, builderer and founder of
the Alpine Club.
According to Collins, about
10students heredo buildering,
and almost all are members of
the Alpine Club, a student club
that teaches rock climbing and
mountaineering.
Although buildering is a
separate sport from rock climb

ing, almost all builderers are
also rock climbers, and many
began buildering in order to
stay in shape for climbing.
Best place
"Stanford is probably the
best over-all place for builder
ing anywhere," said Collins,
because the walls are "very
much like actual sand stone
climbing."
Almost all buildering in
volves moving horizontally in
stead of vertically up buildings
and walls, said Collins. The
University requires that the
builderer's feet must stay

within three or four feet of the
ground because of the liability
involved, Collins added.
