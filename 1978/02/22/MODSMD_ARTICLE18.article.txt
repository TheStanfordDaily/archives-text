# Tense atmosphere greets nervous job-seekers at CPPC
## 
### Jon Hornsby 
It's 10 minutes to three and the Career
Planning and Placement Center (CPPC) is
getting crowded again. Slick looking un
dergraduates in two and three piece suits
are resignedly stepping into the lobby to
await their interviews.
Pacific Mutual Life, Atlantic Richfield and
Pacific Gas and Electric are among the 11
companies on campus today to interview
students, mostly seniors, for jobs.
It's no big annual event; recruiting goes
on from early October to mid-April. But for
the hundred or so job seekers who come
in here daily, it means their future.
And most are as tense as actors before a
big performance.
From the corridor feeding the 12 cubical
interview rooms, you can hear a slight,
even hum of conversation as if a nervous
cocktail party were going on. Ten high
intensity interviews are being held simul
taneously.
Real action
The real action, however, is back out in
the lobby. Since the appointments fall
every half-hour, the atmosphere is stiffen
ing as 3 p.m. approaches.
About six students in their finest Madi
son Avenue threads are pacing, drumming
fingers, lounging, stretching and flipping
through magazines.

A couple of men on the sofa browse
through the journals. Instead of the dentist
office's "Reader's Digest," and "Field and
Stream," they can choose between
"Money," "Changing Times" or maybe
"Arizona Highways."
Conversation
"Who are you interviewing with?" one
young woman asks the neatly coiffured
young man beside her.
"Peat, Marwick and Mitchelle," he re
plies. "I think I've got a good chance. I
know enough about economics, and I'm
semi-intelligent."
"Yeah, I talked to them yesterday," she
goes on. "The representative's name is
Tom something. He's real nice."
A pain
"That's good," he says."The ones I've
seen so far have been a pain. They kind of
stare you down."
He starts tapping his high-heel wingtips,
and straightens his tie; she smooths the
wrinkles out of her gray suit and realigns
her gold cameo pin.
Most others in the room are going
through similar routines. One man keeps
checking his watch and wiping his palms
on his pant's leg. Another is flipping
through the Nevada Bell Telephone pam
phlet, brushing up on the details and men
tally outlining his interview techniques.

You can see him counting with his eyes.
It's close to three. An interviewer comes
out. "Mark DeMatteo," he calls.
"Here," a student responds as he rises
and extends his hand.
"Hi Mark, I'm Rick Supine. How are
you?"
"Fine. How are you?"
"Fine, come right this way." And they
file down the corridor.
Process
This process is repeated with the next
interviewee. "Hi, how are you? Fine, how
are you? Fine, come on back."
Sometimes the introductions go on
simultaneously producing an echo effect,
said Sherry Fahey, a senior psychology
student who has visited the CPPC several
times.
"It drives you crazy after a while," she
said. "People in the lobby judge the suc
cess of the interview by how long it lasts. If
a guy stays 35 minutes, they figure he's
made it. If he's only a seven minute man,
well, that's the breaks," she added.
Competition
Fahey said she sensed a feeling of com
petition between friends from similar fields
who are after the same job.
A senior industrial engineer, Dave Ol
son, recognized that the competition exists
but said it is not too bothersome. He said

once a girl coming from the room he was
heading toward asked him to say to the
interviewer "That's a hard act to follow."
He said no way.
Three-fourths of the recruiting com
panies look for technical qualifications.
Those screening liberal arts majors some
times have 40 names on the waiting list for
interview slots, according to Robin Hol
brook, CPPC receptionist.
Carefree attitude
Megan Edwards, a recent graduate in En
glish who has been interviewed nine times
at the CPPC, said she started her job
search with a carefree attitude.
"I kind of laughed when I went in, think
ing it was no big deal. But I realized you
can't be modest. You and your resume
have to show that you're different. Having
a Stanford degree doesn't mean anything
when everybody else being interviewed
has one, too," Edwards commented.
"To tell you the truth, I'm sick of it," she
said. "I'm ready to go live in a hut in Car
mel."
Casual students
Also on the scene in the placement
center lobby are casual students in sweat
shirts and parkas. They sign lists and comb
career description catalogues.
Signs above them read "Sign up only if
you meet the qualifications," and "Don't

be a no-show."
An ad reads: "I'm my own boss. I work
for NRD," and shows a man kneeling on
the tennis court, racket in hand. You know
his teeth are gritted under his debonair
smile.
Next crew
It's 3:20 p.m. now. The next shift's crew
is filtering in. One fellow carries an attache
case and umbrella. Another, with cal
culator in hand, opens his copy of the Es
tate Planning Guide. The banter starts
again:
"Did Jim get into law school?"
"Jane's not wearing her wedding ring. I
hear if she did that'd be the kiss of death
on her job chances."
Recruiter
Out comes the recruiter, "the old pro."
He's dressed casually with a vest but no
coat.
"Jim Pillsbury?" He smiles at Jim as at a
business colleague â€” eyes squinted to in
sinuate a sharp wit.
He and Jim walk back to the interview
rooms. The routine continues.
Thirty-five minutes later, Jim emerges.
He's stayed longer than usual, so he has
probably made a good impression. He
strides out smartly, looking straight ahead,
and heads out the door in the true fashion
of the employed man he will someday be.

Real action
The real action, however, is back out in
the lobby. Since the appointments fall
every half-hour, the atmosphere is stiffen
ing as 3 p.m. approaches.
About six students in their finest Madi
son Avenue threads are pacing, drumming
fingers, lounging, stretching and flipping
through magazines.

A couple of men on the sofa browse
through the journals. Instead of the dentist
office's "Reader's Digest," and "Field and
Stream," they can choose between
"Money," "Changing Times" or maybe
"Arizona Highways."
Conversation
"Who are you interviewing with?" one
young woman asks the neatly coiffured
young man beside her.
"Peat, Marwick and Mitchelle," he re
plies. "I think I've got a good chance. I
know enough about economics, and I'm
semi-intelligent."
"Yeah, I talked to them yesterday," she
goes on. "The representative's name is
Tom something. He's real nice."
A pain
"That's good," he says."The ones I've
seen so far have been a pain. They kind of
stare you down."
He starts tapping his high-heel wingtips,
and straightens his tie; she smooths the
wrinkles out of her gray suit and realigns
her gold cameo pin.
Most others in the room are going
through similar routines. One man keeps
checking his watch and wiping his palms
on his pant's leg. Another is flipping
through the Nevada Bell Telephone pam
phlet, brushing up on the details and men
tally outlining his interview techniques.

You can see him counting with his eyes.
It's close to three. An interviewer comes
out. "Mark DeMatteo," he calls.
"Here," a student responds as he rises
and extends his hand.
"Hi Mark, I'm Rick Supine. How are
you?"
"Fine. How are you?"
"Fine, come right this way." And they
file down the corridor.
Process
This process is repeated with the next
interviewee. "Hi, how are you? Fine, how
are you? Fine, come on back."
Sometimes the introductions go on
simultaneously producing an echo effect,
said Sherry Fahey, a senior psychology
student who has visited the CPPC several
times.
"It drives you crazy after a while," she
said. "People in the lobby judge the suc
cess of the interview by how long it lasts. If
a guy stays 35 minutes, they figure he's
made it. If he's only a seven minute man,
well, that's the breaks," she added.
Competition
Fahey said she sensed a feeling of com
petition between friends from similar fields
who are after the same job.
A senior industrial engineer, Dave Ol
son, recognized that the competition exists
but said it is not too bothersome. He said

once a girl coming from the room he was
heading toward asked him to say to the
interviewer "That's a hard act to follow."
He said no way.
Three-fourths of the recruiting com
panies look for technical qualifications.
Those screening liberal arts majors some
times have 40 names on the waiting list for
interview slots, according to Robin Hol
brook, CPPC receptionist.
Carefree attitude
Megan Edwards, a recent graduate in En
glish who has been interviewed nine times
at the CPPC, said she started her job
search with a carefree attitude.
"I kind of laughed when I went in, think
ing it was no big deal. But I realized you
can't be modest. You and your resume
have to show that you're different. Having
a Stanford degree doesn't mean anything
when everybody else being interviewed
has one, too," Edwards commented.
"To tell you the truth, I'm sick of it," she
said. "I'm ready to go live in a hut in Car
mel."
Casual students
Also on the scene in the placement
center lobby are casual students in sweat
shirts and parkas. They sign lists and comb
career description catalogues.
Signs above them read "Sign up only if
you meet the qualifications," and "Don't

be a no-show."
An ad reads: "I'm my own boss. I work
for NRD," and shows a man kneeling on
the tennis court, racket in hand. You know
his teeth are gritted under his debonair
smile.
Next crew
It's 3:20 p.m. now. The next shift's crew
is filtering in. One fellow carries an attache
case and umbrella. Another, with cal
culator in hand, opens his copy of the Es
tate Planning Guide. The banter starts
again:
"Did Jim get into law school?"
"Jane's not wearing her wedding ring. I
hear if she did that'd be the kiss of death
on her job chances."
Recruiter
Out comes the recruiter, "the old pro."
He's dressed casually with a vest but no
coat.
"Jim Pillsbury?" He smiles at Jim as at a
business colleague â€” eyes squinted to in
sinuate a sharp wit.
He and Jim walk back to the interview
rooms. The routine continues.
Thirty-five minutes later, Jim emerges.
He's stayed longer than usual, so he has
probably made a good impression. He
strides out smartly, looking straight ahead,
and heads out the door in the true fashion
of the employed man he will someday be.
It's 10 minutes to three and the Career
Planning and Placement Center (CPPC) is
getting crowded again. Slick looking un
dergraduates in two and three piece suits
are resignedly stepping into the lobby to
await their interviews.
Pacific Mutual Life, Atlantic Richfield and
Pacific Gas and Electric are among the 11
companies on campus today to interview
students, mostly seniors, for jobs.
It's no big annual event; recruiting goes
on from early October to mid-April. But for
the hundred or so job seekers who come
in here daily, it means their future.
And most are as tense as actors before a
big performance.
From the corridor feeding the 12 cubical
interview rooms, you can hear a slight,
even hum of conversation as if a nervous
cocktail party were going on. Ten high
intensity interviews are being held simul
taneously.

goes on. "The representative's name is
Tom something. He's real nice."
A pain
"That's good," he says."The ones I've
seen so far have been a pain. They kind of
stare you down."
He starts tapping his high-heel wingtips,
and straightens his tie; she smooths the
wrinkles out of her gray suit and realigns
her gold cameo pin.
Most others in the room are going
through similar routines. One man keeps
checking his watch and wiping his palms
on his pant's leg. Another is flipping
through the Nevada Bell Telephone pam
phlet, brushing up on the details and men
tally outlining his interview techniques.

You can see him counting with his eyes.
It's close to three. An interviewer comes
out. "Mark DeMatteo," he calls.
"Here," a student responds as he rises
and extends his hand.
"Hi Mark, I'm Rick Supine. How are
you?"
"Fine. How are you?"
"Fine, come right this way." And they
file down the corridor.
Process
This process is repeated with the next
interviewee. "Hi, how are you? Fine, how
are you? Fine, come on back."
Sometimes the introductions go on
simultaneously producing an echo effect,
said Sherry Fahey, a senior psychology
student who has visited the CPPC several
times.
"It drives you crazy after a while," she
said. "People in the lobby judge the suc
cess of the interview by how long it lasts. If
a guy stays 35 minutes, they figure he's
made it. If he's only a seven minute man,
well, that's the breaks," she added.
Competition
Fahey said she sensed a feeling of com
petition between friends from similar fields
who are after the same job.
A senior industrial engineer, Dave Ol
son, recognized that the competition exists
but said it is not too bothersome. He said

once a girl coming from the room he was
heading toward asked him to say to the
interviewer "That's a hard act to follow."
He said no way.
Three-fourths of the recruiting com
panies look for technical qualifications.
Those screening liberal arts majors some
times have 40 names on the waiting list for
interview slots, according to Robin Hol
brook, CPPC receptionist.
Carefree attitude
Megan Edwards, a recent graduate in En
glish who has been interviewed nine times
at the CPPC, said she started her job
search with a carefree attitude.
"I kind of laughed when I went in, think
ing it was no big deal. But I realized you
can't be modest. You and your resume
have to show that you're different. Having
a Stanford degree doesn't mean anything
when everybody else being interviewed
has one, too," Edwards commented.
"To tell you the truth, I'm sick of it," she
said. "I'm ready to go live in a hut in Car
mel."
Casual students
Also on the scene in the placement
center lobby are casual students in sweat
shirts and parkas. They sign lists and comb
career description catalogues.
Signs above them read "Sign up only if
you meet the qualifications," and "Don't

be a no-show."
An ad reads: "I'm my own boss. I work
for NRD," and shows a man kneeling on
the tennis court, racket in hand. You know
his teeth are gritted under his debonair
smile.
Next crew
It's 3:20 p.m. now. The next shift's crew
is filtering in. One fellow carries an attache
case and umbrella. Another, with cal
culator in hand, opens his copy of the Es
tate Planning Guide. The banter starts
again:
"Did Jim get into law school?"
"Jane's not wearing her wedding ring. I
hear if she did that'd be the kiss of death
on her job chances."
Recruiter
Out comes the recruiter, "the old pro."
He's dressed casually with a vest but no
coat.
"Jim Pillsbury?" He smiles at Jim as at a
business colleague â€” eyes squinted to in
sinuate a sharp wit.
He and Jim walk back to the interview
rooms. The routine continues.
Thirty-five minutes later, Jim emerges.
He's stayed longer than usual, so he has
probably made a good impression. He
strides out smartly, looking straight ahead,
and heads out the door in the true fashion
of the employed man he will someday be.
It's 10 minutes to three and the Career
Planning and Placement Center (CPPC) is
getting crowded again. Slick looking un
dergraduates in two and three piece suits
are resignedly stepping into the lobby to
await their interviews.
Pacific Mutual Life, Atlantic Richfield and
Pacific Gas and Electric are among the 11
companies on campus today to interview
students, mostly seniors, for jobs.
It's no big annual event; recruiting goes
on from early October to mid-April. But for
the hundred or so job seekers who come
in here daily, it means their future.
And most are as tense as actors before a
big performance.
From the corridor feeding the 12 cubical
interview rooms, you can hear a slight,
even hum of conversation as if a nervous
cocktail party were going on. Ten high
intensity interviews are being held simul
taneously.
Real action
The real action, however, is back out in
the lobby. Since the appointments fall
every half-hour, the atmosphere is stiffen
ing as 3 p.m. approaches.
About six students in their finest Madi
son Avenue threads are pacing, drumming
fingers, lounging, stretching and flipping
through magazines.

A couple of men on the sofa browse
through the journals. Instead of the dentist
office's "Reader's Digest," and "Field and
Stream," they can choose between
"Money," "Changing Times" or maybe
"Arizona Highways."
Conversation
"Who are you interviewing with?" one
young woman asks the neatly coiffured
young man beside her.
"Peat, Marwick and Mitchelle," he re
plies. "I think I've got a good chance. I
know enough about economics, and I'm
semi-intelligent."
"Yeah, I talked to them yesterday," she
goes on. "The representative's name is
Tom something. He's real nice."
A pain
"That's good," he says."The ones I've
seen so far have been a pain. They kind of
