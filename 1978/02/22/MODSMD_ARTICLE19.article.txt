## lively arts/stephen penico Zabaleta proves it again 
### 
In a recital here on Friday
< Nicanor Zabaleta reaffirmed his
title as world's finest harpist. For
!; those who know Zabaleta's talent,
suffice it to say he exhibited the
cleanness, grace and dynamic in
;â€¢ terpretation expected of him. For
!> those who came to Dinkelspiel
unfamiliar with the harp as a solo
!; instrument the performance was
all the more exciting.
!<! Zabaleta says he is used to play
-5; ing before audiences skeptical of
the harp. He also says that in his 45
years of concertizing he has never
failed to win converts by the end
ji of a performance. Indeed, it was
J; Zabaleta who first won the world
l;i to the harp, convincing music
lovers that not only angels played
{ the harp, and convincing business
J; managers that the harp could
"sell."

This was no small feat for the
harp has many inherent limita
tions as a solo instrument. It can't
equal the volume of other instru
ments and until recently a harpist
could stop unwanted resonance
only by damping strings with the
hand. Moreover, since histori
cally the harp was considered a
second class instrument few great
composers wrote pieces for it, or
so most thought.
Several decades ago Zabaleta
set out to correct these limita
tions. He decided that works for
harp by great composers must be
buried in the libraries of Europe.
His suspicions proved correct,
and he uncovered numerous mas
terpieces.
The most impressive of the
pieces were three modern
Spanish works by Albeniz and

Halffter. With these the Basque
born Zabaleta produced such rich
and varied tones that one won
dered whether he hadn't changed
instruments, and his graceful
hand movements and subtle vari
ation quieted any discomfort that
might have resulted from the
composers' frequent repetition of
themes.
In an interview before the per
formance Zabaleta said the harp
has a promising future. The mod
ern harp composers are "very,
very good" and doors now stand
open for a new generation of solo
harpists. As for the angelic music
of the past, we will not hear this
from Zabaleta. "I will go to hell,"
he quipped, "where I may play
the music I like. For such music
one is tempted to join him there.
