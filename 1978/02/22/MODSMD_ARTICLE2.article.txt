# Mine workers seek compromise pact
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Coal industry
and United Mine Workers bargain
ers resumed negotiations yesterday
in an attempt to end the 78-day coal
strike before the government im
poses a settlement.
Labor Secretary Ray Marshall
shuttled between meetings of the
Bituminous Coal Operators Associa
tion (BCOA) and the union to work
out a compromise agreement.
An administration official said a
proposed settlement reached by
the union and an independent coal
operator on Monday "does figure
in a major way" in the new talks.
As government pressure
mounted for an end to the lengthy
strike, officials of the BCOA, the
130-member employers group, an
nounced they were agreeable to
new talks. However, they criticized
aspects of the independent settle
ment.
It was the first comment from the
industry since joint talks with the

union broke off Saturday after the
UMW rejected what was termed the
coal operators' final offer.
Meanwhile, President Jimmy Car
ter won bipartisan congressional
support to take strong steps to end
the walkout, but the administration
continued to play a waiting game in
hopes the two parties would settle
the dispute themselves.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill
said after meeting with the presi
dent that he felt it would be at least
25 days more before the coal strike
could tie up the nation economi
cally.
O'Neill told reporters the ad
ministration is hoping for a
negotiated settlement by tomorrow.
But he said the House was ready to
act on special legislation to end the
strike, should Carter request it.
The administration is considering
three "final" steps to deal with the
strike or a combination of the
three.
