## 'Twas Ella, Oscar, Joe & the Count 
### 
When Ella Fitzgerald, Oscar
Peterson, Joe Pass, and Count
Basie take the stage on the
same night, one can be sure
that something special is going
to happen. What those artists
presented last Saturday at the
Masonic Auditorium was, in
fact, quite a bit more than
"something special.
Two years ago these musi
cians got together to tour as
the Pablo Jazz Festical. This
year local promoters coaxed
them into recreating the
matchup for two special
California engagements. I sus
pect that it will be quite a while
before local audiences get a
chance to see these four head
liners together again.
Joe Pass opened the show
with a solo guitar set which was
disconcertingly short. Pass
played as well as I had ever
heard him play. He did a lengthy
rendition of "Wave and trans
formed the Jobim song into a
miniature rhapsody. His pas
sing chords were amazingly in
tricate; his runs were clean,
sometimes at tempos which
would give many excellent
pianists trouble; and his im
provisations, which unfortu
nately sometimes take <1 back
seat to his technique, were fas
cinating.
Lightning
Pass closed his set with a
lightning fast rendition rendi
tion of "Cherokee" which dis
played all of these virtues in
abundance. It is to his credit
that he wowed an audience
which had come for the most
part to see Ella and the Count.
Oscar Peterson followed,
who one might say is the |oe
Pass of the piano. For over
twenty years Peterson has
been known as the virtuoso of
jazz pianists. The most
noteworthy aspect of Peter
son s playing, however, is not
his speed or clarity (which are
incomparable), but his
rhythmic sense. If someone
wanted to know what "swing
was, they could do no better
than to listen to Oscar Peter
son. Oscar is one of the few
jazz pianists who can cause au
diences to clap alongwith him,
as they did on his swingin ver
sion of "Teach Me Tonight.
For his set Peterson called
out an unexpected guest.
Peterson s cohort of many

years, bassist Ray Brown, came
out for the remainder of the
first half. Brown and Peterson
played a magnificent "Ten
derly, the song which
boosted Peterson to fame in
the fifties. Peterson began with
richly ornamented solo
chorus, which was followed by
Brown stating the melody on
solo bass. They both than went
into the number, double
timing it, with a passion. Peter
son s last chorus was awe
inspiring, his hands cascading
up and down the piano with
fantastic control and touch.
Bop
Passthen cameto join Brown
and Peterson for two numbers
which were the highlight of the
concert. They began by ripping
into an obscure Charlie Parker
tune at a very fast tempo.
Peterson and Pass exchanged
blazing bop solos, and finished
with a rapid-fire melody state
ment in unison. To close their
set Peterson and Pass alter
nated playing long solo runs
which led into a barely discer
nible version ot "Sweet Geor
gia Brown. On this last tune
Pass and Peterson worked to
gether like a pair of thieves, ex
changing phrases and playing
unexpected unison passages.
For the second half Count
Basie brought out his big band
for several excellent numbers.
Basie s band has been getting
younger in recent years; many
of the band's standout mem
bers are very young, in particu
lar Basie s outstanding drum
mer Butch Miles. Miles plays
much like Gene krupa, which
is unusual for young drum
mers. His playing is impecca
ble, if a bit showy.
The concert closed with Ella
who joined the Basie band for a
divese number of charts,
which ranged from Duke Ellin
ton to a medley from the
"Wiz. Her singing, as usual
was excellent, although one
felt often that she was holding
back, and sticking closer to the
melody than she would have
perhpas done with a different
audience.
The concert, as a whole, was
a magnificent success; the
Masonic Auditorium (which
put on Corea-Hancock a few
weeks ago) is making itself a
center for first-rate jazz.
