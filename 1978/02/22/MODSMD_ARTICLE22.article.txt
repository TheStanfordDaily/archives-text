## 'Nothing was superfluous' 
### 
As you read the playwright's
Program Notes for "The Sea" be
fore the production begins,
there is a sense that something
unique could possibly take
place simply because of the
sensitive perceptions of the
poet himself. And if there were
any doubts as to the Director's
own perceptions into the
dynamics of the play, they too,
like the nature of the sea,
change.

The brilliance of this play is precisely this
quality of observing how our first impre
ssions are turned inside-out . . .

The play, Edward Bond's
"The Sea," which opened last
week in the Little Theatre, is
symbolic in many ways, not
the least of which is that the
Drama Department is becom
ing recognized more and
more for its quality of
stimulating and creative theat
rical ventures. "The Sea" is
about neurotic people (not
too unlike ourselves) who,
because of their sociological
and environmental influ
ences, look at the world in a
very rigid and confined man
ner.
It literally takes an act of
drowning to challenge the sen
sibilities of each character as
we see them first, as they ap
pear from the outside, and fi
nally, as they really are, inside.
The brilliance of the play is
precisely this qualiy of observ
ing how our first impressions
are turned inside-out; the bril
liance of the Director and the
performers is that they actually
do this before our eyes.
The cast
Director Robert L. Lane has
assembled perhaps one of the

strongest casts to be seen on a
Stanford stage in quite some
time. Heading the list of impre
ssive performers is none other
than a faculty mmember, Pat
ricia L. Ryan, who plays the part
of "Mrs. Rafi" — an emphatic,
domineering woman who bul
lies everybody around her be
cause of her perstigious posi
tion. But by the end of the play
we see that she is trapped by
her social position, a product

of her environment, and that
beneath her mask she is really a
very lonely woman sur
rounded by mediocrity. Ms.
Ryan's premiere performance
reflects not only the quality of
the play, but as a first-rate act
ing and voice teacher she
shows that a true artist prac
tices what he preaches. It
would be hoped that we see
more of this fine actress in the
years to come.
This is not a solo perfor
mance, though. This is just the
beginning of a fine play. Al
Mellinkoff, as "Hatch," gives a
virtuoso performance. Seen
first as a very nervous, increas
ingly paranoid shopkeeper

'The Sea' is an artistic achievement well
above the standards of normal university
theater. The Drama Department, I'm
sure, is smiling.

who are plotting to take over

the world, Mr. Mellinkoff suc
cessfully captures our sym
pathies and compassion as he
becomes overwhelmed by the
pressures and mounting ten
sions of the play. His truly vul
nerable performance is one of
the richest gifts an actor ruii
share with an audience.
Precision
Danial Birnbaum, as
"Evens," is another stand-out
in this production. "It's the de
tails that make the tragedy," he
says. And with subtle precision
he etches out his role of the
social outcast who lives along
on the beach and drinks to
keep his sanity from the rest of
the people who are "cruel,
boring, and obsessed."
Antoinette Terry ("Rose
Jones") and Martin D. Curland
("Willy Carson"), as the two
lovers, also give reputable per-

through the absurdity of the
town's social enigma, the two
are able to prove that people
can fall in love.

Amy Klatzkin, as "Mrs.
Tilehouse," serves as the foil to
the repressed, hysterical out
look of the world. Her comic

caricature is sincere with no
sense of artificiality.
In a play with so many fine
performances it is hard to men
tion everybody. Suffice to say,
the rest of the cast was just as
good in their caricatures as any
on? of the principals in creat

gredient of true ensemble. Yet
it would be an injustice to omit
Mellisa Weber's transcendant
portrayal of a dog, and Leslie
Medford's licentious liberties
as a musical conductor.
Brilliance
Last, but not least, was the
technical brilliance of the
show. The visual element and
design was an integral part of
the play. There was a "Frank
Lloyd Wright" quality where
nothing was superfluous and
everything seemed to fit into
the natural background. Wen

dell Cole's set facilitated a
simplicity and economy of
movement which was essential
to the play. Michael Ramsaur's
lighting was at times, stunning.
Robert Howell's sound effec
tively stimulated and Doug
Russell's costumes were au
thentic and elegant.
All in all, the play is an artistic
achievement well above the
standards of normal University
theatre. As a doctoral thesis
production, Mr. Lane can be
certainly proud of its apparent
success, and the Drama Dept.
I'm sure, is smiling. The play
continues tonight through
Saturday.

portrayal of a dog, and Leslie

Brilliance
Last, but not least, was the
technical brilliance of the
show. The visual element and
design was an integral part of
the play. There was a "Frank
Lloyd Wright" quality where
nothing was superfluous and
everything seemed to fit into
the natural background. Wen

dell Cole's set facilitated a
simplicity and economy of
movement which was essential
to the play. Michael Ramsaur's
lighting was at times, stunning.
Robert Howell's sound effec
tively stimulated and Doug
Russell's costumes were au
thentic and elegant.
All in all, the play is an artistic
achievement well above the
standards of normal University
theatre. As a doctoral thesis
production, Mr. Lane can be
certainly proud of its apparent
success, and the Drama Dept.
I'm sure, is smiling. The play
continues tonight through

As you read the playwright's
Program Notes for "The Sea" be
fore the production begins,
there is a sense that something
unique could possibly take
place simply because of the
sensitive perceptions of the
poet himself. And if there were
any doubts as to the Director's
own perceptions into the
dynamics of the play, they too,
like the nature of the sea,
change.

The brilliance of this play is precisely this
quality of observing how our first impre

The play, Edward Bond's
"The Sea," which opened last
week in the Little Theatre, is
symbolic in many ways, not
the least of which is that the
Drama Department is becom
ing recognized more and
more for its quality of
stimulating and creative theat
rical ventures. "The Sea" is
about neurotic people (not
too unlike ourselves) who,
because of their sociological
and environmental influ
ences, look at the world in a
very rigid and confined man
ner.
It literally takes an act of
drowning to challenge the sen
sibilities of each character as
we see them first, as they ap
pear from the outside, and fi
nally, as they really are, inside.

The cast
Director Robert L. Lane has
assembled perhaps one of the

strongest casts to be seen on a
Stanford stage in quite some
time. Heading the list of impre
ssive performers is none other
than a faculty mmember, Pat
ricia L. Ryan, who plays the part
of "Mrs. Rafi" — an emphatic,
domineering woman who bul
lies everybody around her be
cause of her perstigious posi
tion. But by the end of the play
we see that she is trapped by
her social position, a product

of her environment, and that
beneath her mask she is really a
very lonely woman sur
rounded by mediocrity. Ms.
Ryan's premiere performance
reflects not only the quality of
the play, but as a first-rate act
ing and voice teacher she
shows that a true artist prac
tices what he preaches. It
would be hoped that we see
more of this fine actress in the
years to come.

As you read the playwright's
Program Notes for "The Sea" be
fore the production begins,
there is a sense that something
unique could possibly take
place simply because of the
sensitive perceptions of the
poet himself. And if there were
any doubts as to the Director's
own perceptions into the
dynamics of the play, they too,
like the nature of the sea,
change.

The brilliance of this play is precisely this
quality of observing how our first impre
ssions are turned inside-out . . .

The play, Edward Bond's
"The Sea," which opened last
week in the Little Theatre, is
symbolic in many ways, not
the least of which is that the
Drama Department is becom
ing recognized more and
more for its quality of
stimulating and creative theat
rical ventures. "The Sea" is
about neurotic people (not
too unlike ourselves) who,
because of their sociological
and environmental influ
ences, look at the world in a
very rigid and confined man
ner.
It literally takes an act of
drowning to challenge the sen
sibilities of each character as
we see them first, as they ap
pear from the outside, and fi
nally, as they really are, inside.
The brilliance of the play is
precisely this qualiy of observ
ing how our first impressions
are turned inside-out; the bril
liance of the Director and the
performers is that they actually
do this before our eyes.
The cast
Director Robert L. Lane has
assembled perhaps one of the

strongest casts to be seen on a
Stanford stage in quite some
time. Heading the list of impre
ssive performers is none other
than a faculty mmember, Pat
ricia L. Ryan, who plays the part
of "Mrs. Rafi" — an emphatic,
domineering woman who bul
lies everybody around her be
cause of her perstigious posi
tion. But by the end of the play
we see that she is trapped by
her social position, a product

of her environment, and that
beneath her mask she is really a
very lonely woman sur
rounded by mediocrity. Ms.
Ryan's premiere performance
reflects not only the quality of
the play, but as a first-rate act
ing and voice teacher she
shows that a true artist prac
tices what he preaches. It
would be hoped that we see
more of this fine actress in the
years to come.
This is not a solo perfor
mance, though. This is just the
beginning of a fine play. Al
