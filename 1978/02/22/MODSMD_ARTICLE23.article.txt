## 'Obscure Object' is excellent 
### 
Lust and passion of an
aging bourgeois gentleman is
the subject of Luis Bunuel's
most recent film, That
Obscure Object of Desire.
Mathieu (Fernando Rey), a
rich French widower boards
the first class compartment of
the Seville-Paris train. Well
mannered that he is, he sur
prises his fellow passengers
when he pours a bucket of
water on the head of a bat
tered young woman who tries
to board the train. Better to
do that than to kill her, he
explains, "She is the worst of
all women."
The story that follows is of
•2 his frustrated love for Con
;j chita, a beautiful young
!j Spanish woman, that he tried
to seduce when she was a
» maid in his own house but his
clumsy advances made her
& quit the job.
!> Mathieu pursues her with
R the only means available to
him, his money. He buys her
presents, tries to bribe her

mother to lure her to his
house and when all seems to
fail, he even has her expelled
from the country. But he is
helplessly in love and follows
her to Seville.
Conchita teases Mathieu
into a rage, they live together
but she rejects his advances,
"If I gave in you would not
love me any more," she tells
him when he finally manages
to get her into bed only to
discover that she has pro
tected her virginity with a
heavy linen girdle which he
cannot undo.
It is tempting to dismiss this
film as trite, a contest of
youth versus power and
money, a contest in which
both sides get their just de
serts. But the film is much
more subtle. Conchita claims
that she loves Mathieu and
the beauty lies in the fact that
you don't know whether she
does or she is leading him on.
It is a beautifully sensitive
film that shows the full rich

ness of life, of passion and
love and most of all the mys
tery of it all.
Mathieu is not simply a
dirty old man, he is genuinely
in love. It is just that Bunuel, a
restless critic of the
bourgeoise, leaves him with
money as his only advantage.
Mathieu is trapped in the
world of polite conversation
and easy life and money.
The film takes place in an
absurd world, with terrorism
in it's background. Mathieu
lives in a sick society, cars
explode, kidnappings occur
by extremists groups with
sexual and religious ac
ronyms such as the Liberation
Army of Infant jesus. It is a
reminder that Bunuel, now
77, is a surrealist who started
his film career in 1929 with
"Un Chien Andalou" which
he made in collaboration with
Salvador Dali.
Bunuel apparently got him
self into a duel when he fired

Maria Schneider who was
cast as Conchita after a few
days of shooting and re
placed her with not one but
two actresses, Carole
Bouquet and Angela Molina,
that add to the film's sur
realist quality by interchang
ing at crucial moments of the
plot.
Bunuel points out not only
the infinite gullibility of
people but also the fact that
material success has not
brought happiness with it: in
"Belle de lour" (1966) he
examines the life of Severine,
a beautiful young married
woman who is bored to tears
with her life and so decides to
work part time in a brothel.
This is a theme that is evident
throughout his films.
"That Obscure Object of
Desire" along with "Annie
Hall" ranks among the best
films around. You will laugh
through it all and you are not
likely to forget it.

in love. It is just that Bunuel, a
restless critic of the
bourgeoise, leaves him with
money as his only advantage.
Mathieu is trapped in the
world of polite conversation
and easy life and money.
The film takes place in an
absurd world, with terrorism
in it's background. Mathieu
lives in a sick society, cars
explode, kidnappings occur
by extremists groups with
sexual and religious ac
ronyms such as the Liberation
Army of Infant jesus. It is a
reminder that Bunuel, now
77, is a surrealist who started
his film career in 1929 with
"Un Chien Andalou" which
he made in collaboration with
Salvador Dali.
Bunuel apparently got him
self into a duel when he fired

Maria Schneider who was
cast as Conchita after a few
days of shooting and re
placed her with not one but
two actresses, Carole
Bouquet and Angela Molina,
that add to the film's sur
realist quality by interchang
ing at crucial moments of the
plot.
Bunuel points out not only
the infinite gullibility of
people but also the fact that
material success has not
brought happiness with it: in
"Belle de lour" (1966) he
examines the life of Severine,
a beautiful young married
woman who is bored to tears
with her life and so decides to
work part time in a brothel.
This is a theme that is evident
throughout his films.
"That Obscure Object of
Desire" along with "Annie
Hall" ranks among the best
films around. You will laugh
through it all and you are not
likely to forget it.
Lust and passion of an
aging bourgeois gentleman is
the subject of Luis Bunuel's
most recent film, That
Obscure Object of Desire.
Mathieu (Fernando Rey), a
rich French widower boards
the first class compartment of
the Seville-Paris train. Well
mannered that he is, he sur
prises his fellow passengers
when he pours a bucket of
water on the head of a bat
tered young woman who tries
to board the train. Better to
do that than to kill her, he
explains, "She is the worst of
all women."
The story that follows is of
•2 his frustrated love for Con
;j chita, a beautiful young
!j Spanish woman, that he tried
to seduce when she was a
» maid in his own house but his
clumsy advances made her
& quit the job.
!> Mathieu pursues her with
R the only means available to
him, his money. He buys her
presents, tries to bribe her

mother to lure her to his
house and when all seems to
fail, he even has her expelled
from the country. But he is
helplessly in love and follows
her to Seville.
Conchita teases Mathieu
into a rage, they live together
but she rejects his advances,
"If I gave in you would not
love me any more," she tells
him when he finally manages
to get her into bed only to
discover that she has pro
tected her virginity with a
heavy linen girdle which he
cannot undo.
It is tempting to dismiss this
film as trite, a contest of
youth versus power and
money, a contest in which
both sides get their just de
serts. But the film is much
more subtle. Conchita claims
that she loves Mathieu and
the beauty lies in the fact that
you don't know whether she
does or she is leading him on.
It is a beautifully sensitive
film that shows the full rich

ness of life, of passion and
love and most of all the mys
tery of it all.
Mathieu is not simply a
dirty old man, he is genuinely
in love. It is just that Bunuel, a
restless critic of the
bourgeoise, leaves him with
money as his only advantage.
