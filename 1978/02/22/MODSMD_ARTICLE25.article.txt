Brown to announce candidacy
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown will formally
announce his candidacy for re-election today,
the Democratic governor's office said yesterday.
A memo from Brown's office said Gray Davis,
Brown's executive secretary, had been named
manager of Brown's re-election campaign. It said
the formal announcement of Brown's candidacy
would be made today.
Brown, who squeaked into office in 1974 in
California's closest race for governor in half a
century, begins his campaign for re-election as a
heavy favorite.
The 39-year-old Democrat, who made "lower
your expectations" a slogan for his administra
tion, was expected to take an upbeat note in his
campaign, emphasizing programs to create jobs
and develop California's space technology.
He will be seeking re-election against five Re
publican foes on a record that includes a few
personal triumphs and some powerful symbols,
such as his refusal to live in the governor's man
sion and his refusal of a limousine.
But that image has been tarnished by growing
criticism, especially in the past year, of his ad
ministrative abilities and of scandals in his Health
and Welfare Agency.
Among major accomplishments, Brown
created the Agricultural Labor Relations Board,
reshaped state support of local schools, put
more public members on state licensing and
consumer affairs boards, and created permanent
commissions to control coastal development.
But Brown's two biggest achievements — his
farm labor law and his national recognition as a
presidential contender — also are potential
campaign liabilities.
Farm leaders now are among the most vocal
foes of Brown, claiming that the board Brown
appointed has been biased in favor of farm labor
leader Cesar Chavez. And Republicans are snip
ing at Brown for attempting to use the governor
ship as a steppingstone to the White House.
Court sets education rulings
Washington — The Supreme Court let stand a
ruling yesterday that church schools may not
turn away black children as students, agreed to
decide whether parochial schools must bargain
with teacher unions, and rejected a university's
attempt to dump an order that it recognize a
homosexual group as a legitimate student or
ganization.
End to urban gas plants urged
Washington — A federal agency urged Con
gress yesterday to impose a moratorium on
building liquefied gas plants in urban areas be
cause they pose too great a threat to public
health.
Monte Canfield Jr., energy director for the

CAO, told the House energy and power sub
committee that intensified safety steps are
needed because liquefied gas is a "dangerous
substance" and because "its potential for dam
age is so great."
Canfield said the design of many liquefied gas
storage tanks offers inadequate protection from
hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural
phenomenon or from sabotage or terrorist at
tacks.
Carter aide embarrassed in bar
Washington — Hamilton Jordan may be ham
pered in carrying out his duties as President
Jimmy Carter's chief aide as a result of allega
tions that he was in a barroom altercation with a
young woman, Carter's chief spokesman said
yesterday.
White House Press Secretary Jody Powell faced
lengthy questioning at the daily White House
news briefing about the alleged incident. The
Washington Post reported Sunday that Jordan,
rebuffed in his attempt to strike up a conversa
tion with a woman in a Washington singles bar,
spat his drink down the front of her blouse.
Jordan denied the allegation. On Monday the
White House released 33 pages of statements
about the allegations, including the comments of
a bartender who said he had not seen such an
incident take place.
Asked whether he thought the allegations
would hamper Jordan, the press secretary said,
"Clearly the publication of anonymous attacks
on a man's reputation that are also untrue aren't
very helpful in a man's doing his job."
East coast drilling to begin
New York — After three years of legal delays,
oil and gas exploration 60 miles off the densely
populated East Coast could begin within three
weeks, industry officials said yesterday.
The forecast came after the U.S. Supreme
Court gave its go-ahead for the offshore drilling.
Environmentalists who fought the legal battle
against offshore drilling said they would watch
oil operations and might return to court if they
found environmental protection regulations not
being obeyed.
Government officials estimate that as much as
1.4 billion barrels of oil and 9.4 trillion cubic feet
of gas may be found in the rock formations 8000
feet to 16,000 feet below the Atlantic.
Hughes' will dispute continues
Las Vegas — Melvin Dummar stood before a
jury yesterday and drew a picture of the road
near a notorious brothel where he says he found
Howard Hughes in 1967.
The Hughes family attorney, James Dilworth,
pressing Dummar for more details of his alleged

desert encounter with the eccentric multimil
lionaire, suggested that the man he befriended
was not Hughes, but an ousted patron of the
Cottontail Ranch.
Dummar, the would-be heir to Hughes' mill
ions, told jurors last week of finding a bruised
old man lying on a desert road. He said that
during a drive to Las Vegas the man identified
himself as Hughes.
Manson accomplice faces trial
Los Angeles — Leslie Van Houten, the former
obscenity-shouting Charles Manson follower
who defiantly refused to show remorse in her
first trial for the murders of a grocer and his
wife, was cheerful but nervous as her third trial
on the charges began yesterday.
She was convicted and sentenced to death in
1971 for the Aug. 10, 1969, stabbing deaths of the
La Biancas. A night earlier, Manson and his gang
— without her — killed Miss Tate and four
others.
Economic growth rate lower
Washington — The nation's economy grew at a
slow rate of four per cent at the end of last year
but prospects for expansion this year are still
relatively good, government economists said
yesterday.
The Commerce Department said the Cross Na
tional Product, which measures the nation's
economic output, grew at an annual rate of four
per cent in the fourth quarter. That was a down
ward revision from the 4.2 per cent growth rate
reported last month.
For the year, the economy grew 4.9 per cent,
after accounting for inflation.
Charles Schultze, President Jimmy Carter's
chief economic adviser, said the coal strike, cold
weather and weak auto sales are having some
adverse effects on economic activity.
Dow Jones down 3.38 points
New York — The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials slipped 3.38 to 749.31, hitting a 34-
month low for the second straight day.
Declines outnumbered advances by about a
9-5 margin on the New York Stock Exchange.
Big Board volume came to 21.89 million shares
against 18.50 million in the previous session.
Today's Weather
Fog this morning with local drizzle. Sunny this
afternoon through tomorrow except only local
afternoon clearing of fog along the coast. Over
night lows in the 40s to low 50s. Highs in the mid
50s near the coast and in the 60s elsewhere.
