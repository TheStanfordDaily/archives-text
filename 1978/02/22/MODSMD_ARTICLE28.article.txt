## Leo Holub: Stanford photographer 
### 
He is a quiet man most of the
time, moving silently about the
photography labs he built with
his own hands. When students
ask questions, he answers with
the same quiet nature, drawing
on his skill which is born of
more than 40 years behind a
camera.
Leo Holub is the man. He
could be a favorite uncle, with
his crinkled smile and wispy
greying hair. But he is also an
artist, a man of diverse abilities
3nd a long association with all
of the fine arts and many re
lated fields.
As senior photography in
structor in the Department of
Art here, Holub has for the past
10 years built Stanford's
photography classes into one
of the most popular sequences
on campus, with an average
enrollment of 170 students per
quarter.
Holub has lived in the Bay
Area since he was seven years
old, having arrived in the East
Bay with his family from Arkan
sas by way of New Mexico.
Early on Holub moved in the
direction of studio art, and re
ceived training at the Chicago
Art Institute, where he studied
drawing, painting and design.
After a time there, he moved
back to the Bay Area, studying
at the California School of Fine
Arts in San Francisco.
It was there in 1939 that he
met Imogen Cunningham, a
woman who was to be a per

sonal friend and advisor for
more lhan 40 years.
Holub was at that time serv
ing a professional internship
with industrial designer Jo
Sinel, and helped Sinel design
the Marchant calculator,
hailed at that time as a pro
duct design breakthrough.
Those were heady days in
San Francisco for much of the
assembled art community.
"There was a feeling in the
air that the great era of design
was coming," Holub said. "We
looked for it everywhere — in
advertising, in product design
and in architecture. It never re
ally arrived. Things are proba
bly as bad now as they ever
were, maybe worse."
After leaving CSFA, Holub,
who was still working mostly in
drawing and design, worked at
a number of graphic and com
mercial design firms.
It was in the early 19605,
when he was working at Kaiser
Graphic Arts in Oakland, that
Holub was approached by
Harry Sanders of the Stanford
Planning office to come to
work here as senior planner for
the University.
"They needed someone who
could combine lots of skills
with some architectural
background," Holub said. "I
was one person they knew of
who could work in graphic de
sign, photography, objective
drawing and general art.
"I was really happy where I

was but I came down to look the
place ovei because I was a
friend ot Harry Sanders. But
when I saw that the men's pool
was right across the street from
where my office would be . . .
well, I took a swim in that pool
every day for the next 10
years."
Holub took on the job as
Senior Planner during the
PACE program. "They called
me senior planner just because
they had no other name for ar
tist," Holub recalled.
According to Holub, it was in
1969 that art department
chairman Lorenz Eitner first
began serious planning for br
inging a studio photography
class to Stanford.
The site of the present photo
labs, in the levels below the Art
Gallery, were at that time oc
cupied by sculpture studios
and sections of the now discon
tinued architecture program.
In the beginning there was
only room for about 40 stu
dents each quarter, and the lab
space available was about half
what it is today. But the popu
larity of the classes was im
mediate and phenomenal; so
much so that students camped
outside the lab during pre
registration just to get a chance
to sign up.
By this time Holub had
moved from the Planning Of
fice to full time work in the art
department, a change which
seemed natural, given that he

was working more and more
in photography himself.
As the photography program
grew, Holub knew he would
have to have some help. So he
turned to his old friend Imogen
Cunningham, who recom
mended Robert Parker, who
had just finished his work for
his BFA at SFAI and the Art
Center in Los Angeles.
"Robert came down and
helped build the program,
even though there weren't
funds to pay him a salary at
first," Holub said. But follow
ing Holub's recommendation
and his demonstrated ability to
relate to Stanford students,
Parker was made the second
full time photography instruc
tor in 1971.
Holub offered some views
about being a studio art in
structor at The Farm.
"All the studio people here
are appointed because they are
working artists. In a way that is
the equivalent of our re
search."
Holub said he prefers to
work at home, where he has a
full photogrraphy lab, because
it is easier to concentrate.
Both Parker and Holub are
currently working on prints for
upcoming shows. Holub's will
open at the Focus Gallery in
The City on April 4 and will
concentrate on San Francisco
and its people, showing them
in their living and working en
vironments.

When asked whether it
might be more satisfying for an
artist to teach at an art
academy, where everyone was
serious about their work,
Holub disagreed.
"In the first few years I felt it
would be better if everyone
had a clearer focus, but by now
I'm happy with the way things
have worked out. The best
photography students don't
always come from the art de
partment."
Holub and Parker have
worked out a scheme, a
philosophy, if you will, about
basic photography and how it
should address the needs of
the students.
"The basic classes allow be
ginners to learn the potential
of the medium," Holub said.
"They learn to see and to get,
the most out of the film and the
paper. They learn what they
can and can't have. They pick
up the basics and then go their
own way.
"We don't have a school of
photography here — I mean
Robert and I don't concentrate
on any one thing. What we do
push is the development of a
way of seeing, an interest in all
of photography; then we let
the students go their own way.
Too many art school graduates
are weak imitators of a strong
teacher."
Holub's own work has in
cluded a diversity of subjects
(he claims to have favorite sub
jects at different times). A col
lection of photographs from
Stanford in the early 1960s was
published as "Stanford Seen,"
the first offering of the Stan
ford Art Book series. That dis
play, his first at the Stanford Art
Gallery, was a record crowd
drawer, because so many stu
dents came to see their friends
and themselves in the show.
Along the way during his
career, Holub has studied and
worked with many of the
acknowledged masters of
modern photography, includ
ing Imogen Cunningham and
Ansel Adams.
He worked with Cunnin
gham on the first regional
planning effort in the Bay Area,
a study entitled "The Next Mill
ion People." Cunningham
photographed Holub's three
sons, and a friendship de
veloped which went as far as
helping the grand old lady of
photography work in her gar
den.
Holub studied with land
scape photographer Adams in
1956 when he took Adams'
Yosemite photo workshop. At
that time the group only num
bered 17 persons and went out
for a 10 day trip. Today the

numbers for each workshop
are in the hundreds.
Holub designed several
showings for Adams, worked
on two photographic catalogs,
and traveled with Adams when
he made the photographs for
the University of California's
centennial celebration.
While this writer is still a stu
dent in the photography sequ
ence, it was amazing to hear
some of the stories Holub had
to tell. But perhaps the most
compelling, the thing he
would like to see most, is the
expansion of the photography
program.
The photo labs now in use fill
only half the basement of the
building which houses the Art
Gallery and the graphics
studios. The rest of the base
ment is unfinished, with sev
eral tons of dirt, lots of work
and a good deal of money bet
ween Leo Holub and the ex
panded photography lab he
sees in his mind.
Plans for the expansion have
already been diawn up, but as
almost always the funds for ex
pansion are lacking.
But Leo Holub isn't worried.
See, he has this plan that if
every photography student
will carry out just one load of
dirt each quarter....
He is a quiet man most of the
time, moving silently about the
photography labs he built with
his own hands. When students
ask questions, he answers with
the same quiet nature, drawing
on his skill which is born of
more than 40 years behind a

helped build the program,
even though there weren't
funds to pay him a salary at
first," Holub said. But follow
ing Holub's recommendation
and his demonstrated ability to
relate to Stanford students,
Parker was made the second
full time photography instruc
tor in 1971.
Holub offered some views
about being a studio art in
structor at The Farm.
"All the studio people here
are appointed because they are
working artists. In a way that is
the equivalent of our re
search."
Holub said he prefers to
work at home, where he has a
full photogrraphy lab, because
it is easier to concentrate.
Both Parker and Holub are
currently working on prints for
upcoming shows. Holub's will
open at the Focus Gallery in
The City on April 4 and will
concentrate on San Francisco
and its people, showing them
in their living and working en
vironments.

When asked whether it
might be more satisfying for an
artist to teach at an art
academy, where everyone was
serious about their work,
Holub disagreed.
"In the first few years I felt it
would be better if everyone
had a clearer focus, but by now
I'm happy with the way things
have worked out. The best
photography students don't
always come from the art de
partment."
Holub and Parker have
worked out a scheme, a
philosophy, if you will, about
basic photography and how it
should address the needs of
the students.
"The basic classes allow be
ginners to learn the potential
of the medium," Holub said.
"They learn to see and to get,
the most out of the film and the
paper. They learn what they
can and can't have. They pick
up the basics and then go their
own way.
"We don't have a school of
photography here — I mean
Robert and I don't concentrate
on any one thing. What we do
push is the development of a
way of seeing, an interest in all
of photography; then we let
the students go their own way.
Too many art school graduates
are weak imitators of a strong
teacher."
Holub's own work has in
cluded a diversity of subjects
(he claims to have favorite sub
jects at different times). A col
lection of photographs from
Stanford in the early 1960s was
published as "Stanford Seen,"
the first offering of the Stan
ford Art Book series. That dis
play, his first at the Stanford Art
Gallery, was a record crowd
drawer, because so many stu
dents came to see their friends
and themselves in the show.
Along the way during his
career, Holub has studied and
worked with many of the
acknowledged masters of
modern photography, includ
ing Imogen Cunningham and
Ansel Adams.
He worked with Cunnin
gham on the first regional
planning effort in the Bay Area,
a study entitled "The Next Mill
ion People." Cunningham
photographed Holub's three
sons, and a friendship de
veloped which went as far as
helping the grand old lady of
photography work in her gar
den.
Holub studied with land
scape photographer Adams in
1956 when he took Adams'
Yosemite photo workshop. At
that time the group only num
bered 17 persons and went out
for a 10 day trip. Today the

numbers for each workshop
are in the hundreds.
Holub designed several
showings for Adams, worked
on two photographic catalogs,
and traveled with Adams when
he made the photographs for
the University of California's
centennial celebration.
While this writer is still a stu
dent in the photography sequ
ence, it was amazing to hear
some of the stories Holub had
to tell. But perhaps the most
compelling, the thing he
would like to see most, is the
expansion of the photography
program.
The photo labs now in use fill
only half the basement of the
building which houses the Art
Gallery and the graphics
studios. The rest of the base
ment is unfinished, with sev
eral tons of dirt, lots of work
and a good deal of money bet
ween Leo Holub and the ex
panded photography lab he
sees in his mind.
Plans for the expansion have
already been diawn up, but as
almost always the funds for ex
pansion are lacking.
But Leo Holub isn't worried.
See, he has this plan that if
every photography student
will carry out just one load of
dirt each quarter....
He is a quiet man most of the
time, moving silently about the
photography labs he built with
his own hands. When students
ask questions, he answers with
the same quiet nature, drawing
on his skill which is born of
more than 40 years behind a
camera.
Leo Holub is the man. He
could be a favorite uncle, with
his crinkled smile and wispy
greying hair. But he is also an
artist, a man of diverse abilities
3nd a long association with all
of the fine arts and many re
lated fields.
As senior photography in
structor in the Department of
Art here, Holub has for the past
10 years built Stanford's
photography classes into one
of the most popular sequences
on campus, with an average
enrollment of 170 students per
quarter.
Holub has lived in the Bay
Area since he was seven years
old, having arrived in the East
Bay with his family from Arkan
sas by way of New Mexico.
Early on Holub moved in the
direction of studio art, and re
ceived training at the Chicago
Art Institute, where he studied
drawing, painting and design.
After a time there, he moved
back to the Bay Area, studying
at the California School of Fine
Arts in San Francisco.
It was there in 1939 that he
met Imogen Cunningham, a
woman who was to be a per

sonal friend and advisor for
more lhan 40 years.
Holub was at that time serv
ing a professional internship
with industrial designer Jo
Sinel, and helped Sinel design
the Marchant calculator,
hailed at that time as a pro
duct design breakthrough.
Those were heady days in
San Francisco for much of the
assembled art community.
"There was a feeling in the
air that the great era of design
was coming," Holub said. "We
looked for it everywhere — in
advertising, in product design
and in architecture. It never re
ally arrived. Things are proba
bly as bad now as they ever
were, maybe worse."
After leaving CSFA, Holub,
who was still working mostly in
drawing and design, worked at
a number of graphic and com
mercial design firms.
It was in the early 19605,
when he was working at Kaiser
Graphic Arts in Oakland, that
Holub was approached by
Harry Sanders of the Stanford
Planning office to come to
work here as senior planner for
the University.
"They needed someone who
could combine lots of skills
with some architectural
background," Holub said. "I
was one person they knew of
who could work in graphic de
sign, photography, objective
drawing and general art.
"I was really happy where I

was but I came down to look the
place ovei because I was a
friend ot Harry Sanders. But
when I saw that the men's pool
was right across the street from
where my office would be . . .
well, I took a swim in that pool
every day for the next 10
years."
Holub took on the job as
Senior Planner during the
PACE program. "They called
me senior planner just because
they had no other name for ar
tist," Holub recalled.
According to Holub, it was in
1969 that art department
chairman Lorenz Eitner first
began serious planning for br
inging a studio photography
class to Stanford.
The site of the present photo
labs, in the levels below the Art
Gallery, were at that time oc
cupied by sculpture studios
and sections of the now discon
tinued architecture program.
In the beginning there was
only room for about 40 stu
dents each quarter, and the lab
space available was about half
what it is today. But the popu
larity of the classes was im
mediate and phenomenal; so
much so that students camped
outside the lab during pre
registration just to get a chance
to sign up.
By this time Holub had
moved from the Planning Of
fice to full time work in the art
department, a change which
seemed natural, given that he

was working more and more
in photography himself.
As the photography program
grew, Holub knew he would
have to have some help. So he
turned to his old friend Imogen
Cunningham, who recom
mended Robert Parker, who
had just finished his work for
his BFA at SFAI and the Art
Center in Los Angeles.
"Robert came down and
helped build the program,
even though there weren't
funds to pay him a salary at
first," Holub said. But follow
ing Holub's recommendation
and his demonstrated ability to
relate to Stanford students,
Parker was made the second
full time photography instruc

will carry out just one load of
dirt each quarter....
He is a quiet man most of the
time, moving silently about the
photography labs he built with
his own hands. When students
ask questions, he answers with
the same quiet nature, drawing
on his skill which is born of
more than 40 years behind a
camera.
Leo Holub is the man. He
could be a favorite uncle, with
his crinkled smile and wispy
greying hair. But he is also an
artist, a man of diverse abilities
3nd a long association with all
of the fine arts and many re
lated fields.
As senior photography in
structor in the Department of
Art here, Holub has for the past
10 years built Stanford's
photography classes into one
of the most popular sequences
on campus, with an average
enrollment of 170 students per
quarter.
Holub has lived in the Bay
Area since he was seven years
old, having arrived in the East
Bay with his family from Arkan
sas by way of New Mexico.
Early on Holub moved in the
direction of studio art, and re
ceived training at the Chicago
Art Institute, where he studied
drawing, painting and design.
After a time there, he moved
back to the Bay Area, studying
at the California School of Fine
Arts in San Francisco.
It was there in 1939 that he
met Imogen Cunningham, a
woman who was to be a per

sonal friend and advisor for
more lhan 40 years.
Holub was at that time serv
ing a professional internship
with industrial designer Jo
Sinel, and helped Sinel design
the Marchant calculator,
hailed at that time as a pro
duct design breakthrough.
Those were heady days in
San Francisco for much of the
assembled art community.
"There was a feeling in the
air that the great era of design
was coming," Holub said. "We
looked for it everywhere — in
advertising, in product design
and in architecture. It never re
ally arrived. Things are proba
bly as bad now as they ever
were, maybe worse."
After leaving CSFA, Holub,
who was still working mostly in
drawing and design, worked at
a number of graphic and com
mercial design firms.
It was in the early 19605,
when he was working at Kaiser
Graphic Arts in Oakland, that
Holub was approached by
Harry Sanders of the Stanford
Planning office to come to
work here as senior planner for
the University.
"They needed someone who
could combine lots of skills
with some architectural
background," Holub said. "I
was one person they knew of
who could work in graphic de
sign, photography, objective
drawing and general art.
"I was really happy where I

was but I came down to look the
place ovei because I was a
friend ot Harry Sanders. But
when I saw that the men's pool
was right across the street from
where my office would be . . .
well, I took a swim in that pool
every day for the next 10
years."
Holub took on the job as
Senior Planner during the
PACE program. "They called
me senior planner just because
they had no other name for ar
tist," Holub recalled.
According to Holub, it was in
1969 that art department
chairman Lorenz Eitner first
began serious planning for br
inging a studio photography
class to Stanford.
The site of the present photo
labs, in the levels below the Art
Gallery, were at that time oc
cupied by sculpture studios
and sections of the now discon
tinued architecture program.
In the beginning there was
only room for about 40 stu
dents each quarter, and the lab
space available was about half
what it is today. But the popu
larity of the classes was im
mediate and phenomenal; so
much so that students camped
outside the lab during pre
registration just to get a chance
to sign up.
By this time Holub had
moved from the Planning Of
fice to full time work in the art
department, a change which
seemed natural, given that he

was working more and more
in photography himself.
As the photography program
grew, Holub knew he would
have to have some help. So he
turned to his old friend Imogen
Cunningham, who recom
mended Robert Parker, who
had just finished his work for
his BFA at SFAI and the Art
Center in Los Angeles.
"Robert came down and
helped build the program,
even though there weren't
funds to pay him a salary at
first," Holub said. But follow
ing Holub's recommendation
and his demonstrated ability to
relate to Stanford students,
Parker was made the second
full time photography instruc
tor in 1971.
Holub offered some views
about being a studio art in
structor at The Farm.
"All the studio people here
are appointed because they are
working artists. In a way that is
the equivalent of our re
search."
Holub said he prefers to
work at home, where he has a
full photogrraphy lab, because
it is easier to concentrate.
Both Parker and Holub are
currently working on prints for
upcoming shows. Holub's will
open at the Focus Gallery in
The City on April 4 and will
concentrate on San Francisco
and its people, showing them
in their living and working en
vironments.

When asked whether it
might be more satisfying for an
artist to teach at an art
academy, where everyone was
serious about their work,
Holub disagreed.
"In the first few years I felt it
would be better if everyone
had a clearer focus, but by now
I'm happy with the way things
have worked out. The best
photography students don't
always come from the art de
partment."
Holub and Parker have
worked out a scheme, a
philosophy, if you will, about
basic photography and how it
should address the needs of
the students.
"The basic classes allow be
ginners to learn the potential
of the medium," Holub said.
"They learn to see and to get,
the most out of the film and the
paper. They learn what they
can and can't have. They pick
up the basics and then go their
own way.
"We don't have a school of
photography here — I mean
Robert and I don't concentrate
on any one thing. What we do
push is the development of a
way of seeing, an interest in all
of photography; then we let
the students go their own way.
Too many art school graduates
are weak imitators of a strong
teacher."
Holub's own work has in
cluded a diversity of subjects
(he claims to have favorite sub
jects at different times). A col
lection of photographs from
Stanford in the early 1960s was
published as "Stanford Seen,"
the first offering of the Stan
ford Art Book series. That dis
play, his first at the Stanford Art
Gallery, was a record crowd
drawer, because so many stu
dents came to see their friends
and themselves in the show.
Along the way during his
career, Holub has studied and
worked with many of the
acknowledged masters of
modern photography, includ
ing Imogen Cunningham and
Ansel Adams.
He worked with Cunnin
gham on the first regional
planning effort in the Bay Area,
a study entitled "The Next Mill
ion People." Cunningham
photographed Holub's three
sons, and a friendship de
veloped which went as far as
helping the grand old lady of
photography work in her gar
den.
Holub studied with land
scape photographer Adams in
1956 when he took Adams'
Yosemite photo workshop. At
that time the group only num
bered 17 persons and went out
for a 10 day trip. Today the

numbers for each workshop
are in the hundreds.
Holub designed several
showings for Adams, worked
on two photographic catalogs,
and traveled with Adams when
he made the photographs for
the University of California's
centennial celebration.
While this writer is still a stu
dent in the photography sequ
ence, it was amazing to hear
some of the stories Holub had
to tell. But perhaps the most
compelling, the thing he
would like to see most, is the
expansion of the photography
program.
The photo labs now in use fill
only half the basement of the
building which houses the Art
Gallery and the graphics
studios. The rest of the base
ment is unfinished, with sev
eral tons of dirt, lots of work
and a good deal of money bet
ween Leo Holub and the ex
panded photography lab he
sees in his mind.
Plans for the expansion have
already been diawn up, but as
almost always the funds for ex
pansion are lacking.
But Leo Holub isn't worried.
See, he has this plan that if
every photography student
will carry out just one load of
dirt each quarter....
He is a quiet man most of the

Center in Los Angeles.
"Robert came down and
helped build the program,
even though there weren't
funds to pay him a salary at
first," Holub said. But follow
ing Holub's recommendation
and his demonstrated ability to
relate to Stanford students,
Parker was made the second
full time photography instruc
tor in 1971.
Holub offered some views
about being a studio art in
structor at The Farm.
"All the studio people here
are appointed because they are
working artists. In a way that is
the equivalent of our re
search."
Holub said he prefers to
work at home, where he has a
full photogrraphy lab, because
it is easier to concentrate.
Both Parker and Holub are
currently working on prints for
upcoming shows. Holub's will
open at the Focus Gallery in
The City on April 4 and will
concentrate on San Francisco
and its people, showing them
in their living and working en
vironments.

When asked whether it
might be more satisfying for an
artist to teach at an art
academy, where everyone was
serious about their work,
Holub disagreed.
"In the first few years I felt it
would be better if everyone
had a clearer focus, but by now
I'm happy with the way things
have worked out. The best
photography students don't
always come from the art de
partment."
Holub and Parker have
worked out a scheme, a
philosophy, if you will, about
basic photography and how it
should address the needs of
the students.
"The basic classes allow be
ginners to learn the potential
of the medium," Holub said.
"They learn to see and to get,
the most out of the film and the
paper. They learn what they
can and can't have. They pick
up the basics and then go their
own way.
"We don't have a school of
photography here — I mean
Robert and I don't concentrate
on any one thing. What we do
push is the development of a
way of seeing, an interest in all
of photography; then we let
the students go their own way.
Too many art school graduates
are weak imitators of a strong
teacher."
Holub's own work has in
cluded a diversity of subjects
(he claims to have favorite sub
jects at different times). A col
lection of photographs from
Stanford in the early 1960s was
published as "Stanford Seen,"
the first offering of the Stan
ford Art Book series. That dis
play, his first at the Stanford Art
Gallery, was a record crowd
drawer, because so many stu
dents came to see their friends
and themselves in the show.
Along the way during his
career, Holub has studied and
worked with many of the
acknowledged masters of
modern photography, includ
ing Imogen Cunningham and
Ansel Adams.
He worked with Cunnin
gham on the first regional
planning effort in the Bay Area,
a study entitled "The Next Mill
ion People." Cunningham
photographed Holub's three
sons, and a friendship de
veloped which went as far as
helping the grand old lady of
photography work in her gar
den.
Holub studied with land
scape photographer Adams in
1956 when he took Adams'
Yosemite photo workshop. At
that time the group only num
bered 17 persons and went out
for a 10 day trip. Today the

numbers for each workshop
are in the hundreds.
Holub designed several
showings for Adams, worked
on two photographic catalogs,
and traveled with Adams when
he made the photographs for
the University of California's
centennial celebration.
While this writer is still a stu
dent in the photography sequ
ence, it was amazing to hear
some of the stories Holub had
to tell. But perhaps the most
compelling, the thing he
would like to see most, is the
expansion of the photography
program.
The photo labs now in use fill
only half the basement of the
building which houses the Art
Gallery and the graphics
studios. The rest of the base
ment is unfinished, with sev
eral tons of dirt, lots of work
and a good deal of money bet
ween Leo Holub and the ex
panded photography lab he
sees in his mind.
Plans for the expansion have
already been diawn up, but as
almost always the funds for ex
pansion are lacking.
But Leo Holub isn't worried.
See, he has this plan that if
every photography student
will carry out just one load of
dirt each quarter....
He is a quiet man most of the
time, moving silently about the
photography labs he built with
his own hands. When students
ask questions, he answers with
the same quiet nature, drawing
on his skill which is born of
more than 40 years behind a
camera.
Leo Holub is the man. He
could be a favorite uncle, with
his crinkled smile and wispy
greying hair. But he is also an
artist, a man of diverse abilities
3nd a long association with all
of the fine arts and many re
lated fields.
As senior photography in
structor in the Department of
Art here, Holub has for the past
10 years built Stanford's
photography classes into one
of the most popular sequences
on campus, with an average
enrollment of 170 students per
quarter.
Holub has lived in the Bay
Area since he was seven years
old, having arrived in the East
Bay with his family from Arkan
sas by way of New Mexico.
Early on Holub moved in the
direction of studio art, and re
ceived training at the Chicago
Art Institute, where he studied
drawing, painting and design.
After a time there, he moved
back to the Bay Area, studying
at the California School of Fine
Arts in San Francisco.
It was there in 1939 that he
met Imogen Cunningham, a
woman who was to be a per

sonal friend and advisor for
more lhan 40 years.
Holub was at that time serv
ing a professional internship
with industrial designer Jo
Sinel, and helped Sinel design
the Marchant calculator,
hailed at that time as a pro
duct design breakthrough.
Those were heady days in
San Francisco for much of the
assembled art community.
"There was a feeling in the
air that the great era of design
was coming," Holub said. "We
looked for it everywhere — in
advertising, in product design
and in architecture. It never re
ally arrived. Things are proba
bly as bad now as they ever
were, maybe worse."
After leaving CSFA, Holub,
who was still working mostly in
drawing and design, worked at
a number of graphic and com
mercial design firms.
It was in the early 19605,
when he was working at Kaiser
Graphic Arts in Oakland, that
Holub was approached by
Harry Sanders of the Stanford
Planning office to come to
work here as senior planner for
the University.
"They needed someone who
could combine lots of skills
with some architectural
background," Holub said. "I
was one person they knew of
who could work in graphic de
sign, photography, objective
drawing and general art.
"I was really happy where I

was but I came down to look the
place ovei because I was a
friend ot Harry Sanders. But
when I saw that the men's pool
was right across the street from
where my office would be . . .
well, I took a swim in that pool
every day for the next 10
years."
Holub took on the job as
Senior Planner during the
PACE program. "They called
me senior planner just because
they had no other name for ar
tist," Holub recalled.
According to Holub, it was in
1969 that art department
chairman Lorenz Eitner first
began serious planning for br
inging a studio photography
class to Stanford.
The site of the present photo
labs, in the levels below the Art
Gallery, were at that time oc
cupied by sculpture studios
and sections of the now discon
tinued architecture program.
In the beginning there was
only room for about 40 stu
dents each quarter, and the lab
space available was about half
what it is today. But the popu
larity of the classes was im
mediate and phenomenal; so
much so that students camped
outside the lab during pre
registration just to get a chance
to sign up.
By this time Holub had
moved from the Planning Of
fice to full time work in the art
department, a change which
seemed natural, given that he

was working more and more
in photography himself.
As the photography program
grew, Holub knew he would
have to have some help. So he
turned to his old friend Imogen
Cunningham, who recom
mended Robert Parker, who
had just finished his work for
his BFA at SFAI and the Art
Center in Los Angeles.
"Robert came down and
helped build the program,
even though there weren't
funds to pay him a salary at
first," Holub said. But follow
ing Holub's recommendation
and his demonstrated ability to
relate to Stanford students,
Parker was made the second
