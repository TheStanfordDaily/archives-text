# Davis knocks Brown in bid to win gubernatorial race
## 
### Alison Smale News Analysis 
Ed Davis was police chief of Los
Angeles for eight years. You re
member. He's the one who wanted
to hang hijackers at the airport.
For just over five weeks, Ed Davis
has been campaigning to become
the next governor of California.
"I'm running for the retirement
and re-education of Jerry Brown,"
Davis declares emphatically.
He wastes no opportunity to at
tack the incumbent.
"Every group that I have talked
to, he has not failed to try to rav
age," Davis says of Brown. "There
is nothing constructive about the
man; he is destructive. He builds
nothing; he tears things dofon."
On a less serious note, Davis exp
lains that he is doing everyone a
favor by running for the governor
ship.
"I do want to reduce the un
employment in California, and so
I'm applying for a job, you see?"
Like any other job applicant,
Davis is going to have to present his
credentials. He thinks he has what
it takes.
"I ran a police department for
eight and a half years," he proc
laims proudly, almost standing to
attention as he speaks. "Crime in
Los Angeles went down several
percentage points in those eight
years. Crime in the nation rose
about 60 per cent. That is effective
ness in administration."
As chief of the Los Angeles Police
Department, Davis instituted a
number of innovative police prac

tices. He started "Team policing,"
with teams of officers assigned to
various areas within the city. The
Neighborhood Watch, a program
which stressed police involvement
in the community and public coop
eration in crime prevention, was
also established. But discipline and
conformity are easier to impose on
a city police force than on the maze
of state government agencies.
Complexities
Davis appears to have no set idea
of how he would play around with
those agency complexities. His
campaign doesn't run on issues. In
fact, the bandwagon so far has only
one asset to sell: ex-Chief Ed Davis.
There are no plans, no proposals.
)ust a tall, gray-haired,
distinguished-looking conservative
from Orange County.
Davis says he has been getting a
good response from California vot
ers since he started "testing the
waters" for the gubernatorial race
about a year ago. Without making
his candidacy official, he began ac
cepting speaking engagements out
side Los Angeles, sniffing the politi
cal air in other parts of California.
"I liked very much the reception I
got," Davis says. "Every place I go, I
have to stand and sign autographs.
They want their children to have
their picture taken with me."
But proud parents and
autograph-seekers are not the only
members of the electorate in
California. Davis may find other
voters harder to convince.
For example, at a recent function,
Davis had a chance to win over the

ladies and gentlemen of the press.
Speaking at the annual dinner of
the Peninsula Press Club at the
Ramada Inn in Millbrae, the ex
police chief sought in vain to instill
a little law and order into the ranks
of 250 mildly inebriated and very in
attentive guests.
Maybe Davis was ill at ease be
cause his keynote speech had been
moved up on the schedule. Events
were running late, and he had a
plane to catch.
"I entertain for a living now, and
so I have an entertainment in Los
Angeles," Davis quipped. The Press
Club audience was not amused.
As Davis attempted to entertain
them with campaign horror stories
of missed flights and farmers'
groups in Sacramento, the dinner
guests chatted among themselves,
giving their speaker only slight at
tention. After all, he is new to cam
paigning. Many of the press mem
bers had covered election after
election. Only tales of a catastrophe
would make them stop in their
tracks. Missing PSA to Sacramento
is not hot news.
Questions
So Davis tried another tack. He
mined the audience for questions,
and got some good ones. The )arvis
amendment. State education.
California's water supply. The 160-
acre law.
Davis' replies were, for the most
part, confused and confusing. On
education, he started strongly: "I'll
tell you something I'm not going to
abolish, and that's schools."
But, after that reassurance, Davis
lapsed. He concluded that a two
day seminar "on a hard-data basis"
would solve some problems in edu
cation.
"He'll never make it in a million
years, I'll tell you that," declared a
Channel 20 reporter. A veteran of
both state and national campaign
coverage, she seemed more in
terested in applying more lipstick to
her already-glossy lips than in lis
tening to what Davis had to say.
Her attention was held, however,
by Davis' hurried reply to her ques
tion: "Why do you feel you are
qualified to be governor?"
"I can't tell you all of the incredi
ble qualities I have," Davis replied.
However, his answer dealt not
with the reasons why he would
make a good governor, but why
Jerry Brown has been such a bad
one.
"Jerry is an elitist," Davis said.
"He occasionally comes down from
the Parthenon into the streets of
Athens, and spends a night in the
pink palace."

Stony silence suggested that the
audience did not share Davis' opin
ion of the present governo'r. Hut
then again, the press and their
friends are a notoriously hard audi
ence to win over. It's their |ob to be
cynical, to ask questions.
Arthur Finkelstein, the New York
pollster, was hired'by Davis to con
duct a 45-minute, in-depth inter
view survey of California voters in
mid-December. That poll showed
Davis only 12 points behind Evelle
Younger, state attorney-general and
chief rival contender for the Repub
lican nomination. Davis says Fin
kelstein estimates this showing to
be good enough for his client to
win the Republican primary once he
is more well-known.
The Committee to Elect a Re
sponsible Governor has sent out an
impassioned plea from Pat Boone
urging all to join the Davis crusade.
In March, Prentice-Hall will publish
the Davis handbook on public ad
ministration. Royalties will help fill
the campaign coffers, for which the
Friends of Ed Davis for Governor
Committee hopes to raise $750,000.

Ed Davis was police chief of Los
Angeles for eight years. You re
member. He's the one who wanted
to hang hijackers at the airport.
For just over five weeks, Ed Davis
has been campaigning to become
the next governor of California.
"I'm running for the retirement
and re-education of Jerry Brown,"
Davis declares emphatically.
He wastes no opportunity to at
tack the incumbent.
"Every group that I have talked
to, he has not failed to try to rav
age," Davis says of Brown. "There
is nothing constructive about the
man; he is destructive. He builds
nothing; he tears things dofon."
On a less serious note, Davis exp
lains that he is doing everyone a
favor by running for the governor
ship.
"I do want to reduce the un
employment in California, and so
I'm applying for a job, you see?"
Like any other job applicant,
Davis is going to have to present his
credentials. He thinks he has what
it takes.
"I ran a police department for
eight and a half years," he proc
laims proudly, almost standing to
attention as he speaks. "Crime in
Los Angeles went down several
percentage points in those eight
years. Crime in the nation rose
about 60 per cent. That is effective
ness in administration."
As chief of the Los Angeles Police
Department, Davis instituted a
number of innovative police prac

tices. He started "Team policing,"
with teams of officers assigned to
various areas within the city. The
Neighborhood Watch, a program
which stressed police involvement
in the community and public coop
eration in crime prevention, was
also established. But discipline and
conformity are easier to impose on
a city police force than on the maze
of state government agencies.
Complexities
Davis appears to have no set idea
of how he would play around with
those agency complexities. His
campaign doesn't run on issues. In
fact, the bandwagon so far has only
one asset to sell: ex-Chief Ed Davis.
There are no plans, no proposals.
)ust a tall, gray-haired,
distinguished-looking conservative
from Orange County.
Davis says he has been getting a
good response from California vot
ers since he started "testing the
waters" for the gubernatorial race
about a year ago. Without making
his candidacy official, he began ac
cepting speaking engagements out
side Los Angeles, sniffing the politi
cal air in other parts of California.
"I liked very much the reception I
got," Davis says. "Every place I go, I
have to stand and sign autographs.
They want their children to have
their picture taken with me."
But proud parents and
autograph-seekers are not the only
members of the electorate in
California. Davis may find other
voters harder to convince.
For example, at a recent function,
Davis had a chance to win over the

ladies and gentlemen of the press.
Speaking at the annual dinner of
the Peninsula Press Club at the
Ramada Inn in Millbrae, the ex
police chief sought in vain to instill
a little law and order into the ranks
of 250 mildly inebriated and very in
attentive guests.
Maybe Davis was ill at ease be
cause his keynote speech had been
moved up on the schedule. Events
were running late, and he had a
plane to catch.
"I entertain for a living now, and
so I have an entertainment in Los
Angeles," Davis quipped. The Press
Club audience was not amused.
As Davis attempted to entertain
them with campaign horror stories
of missed flights and farmers'
groups in Sacramento, the dinner
guests chatted among themselves,
giving their speaker only slight at
tention. After all, he is new to cam
paigning. Many of the press mem
bers had covered election after
election. Only tales of a catastrophe
would make them stop in their
tracks. Missing PSA to Sacramento
is not hot news.
Questions
So Davis tried another tack. He
mined the audience for questions,
and got some good ones. The )arvis
amendment. State education.
California's water supply. The 160-
acre law.
Davis' replies were, for the most
part, confused and confusing. On
education, he started strongly: "I'll
tell you something I'm not going to
abolish, and that's schools."
But, after that reassurance, Davis
lapsed. He concluded that a two
day seminar "on a hard-data basis"
would solve some problems in edu
cation.
"He'll never make it in a million
years, I'll tell you that," declared a
Channel 20 reporter. A veteran of
both state and national campaign
coverage, she seemed more in
terested in applying more lipstick to
her already-glossy lips than in lis
tening to what Davis had to say.
Her attention was held, however,
by Davis' hurried reply to her ques
tion: "Why do you feel you are
qualified to be governor?"
"I can't tell you all of the incredi
ble qualities I have," Davis replied.
However, his answer dealt not
with the reasons why he would
make a good governor, but why
Jerry Brown has been such a bad
one.
"Jerry is an elitist," Davis said.
"He occasionally comes down from
the Parthenon into the streets of
Athens, and spends a night in the
pink palace."

Stony silence suggested that the
audience did not share Davis' opin
ion of the present governo'r. Hut
then again, the press and their
friends are a notoriously hard audi
ence to win over. It's their |ob to be
cynical, to ask questions.
Arthur Finkelstein, the New York
pollster, was hired'by Davis to con
duct a 45-minute, in-depth inter
view survey of California voters in
mid-December. That poll showed
Davis only 12 points behind Evelle
Younger, state attorney-general and
chief rival contender for the Repub
lican nomination. Davis says Fin
kelstein estimates this showing to

win the Republican primary once he
is more well-known.

Arthur Finkelstein, the New York
pollster, was hired'by Davis to con
duct a 45-minute, in-depth inter
view survey of California voters in
mid-December. That poll showed
Davis only 12 points behind Evelle
Younger, state attorney-general and
chief rival contender for the Repub
lican nomination. Davis says Fin
kelstein estimates this showing to
be good enough for his client to
win the Republican primary once he
is more well-known.
The Committee to Elect a Re

Committee hopes to raise $750,000.
Ed Davis was police chief of Los
Angeles for eight years. You re
member. He's the one who wanted
to hang hijackers at the airport.
For just over five weeks, Ed Davis
has been campaigning to become
the next governor of California.
"I'm running for the retirement
and re-education of Jerry Brown,"
Davis declares emphatically.
He wastes no opportunity to at
tack the incumbent.
"Every group that I have talked
to, he has not failed to try to rav
age," Davis says of Brown. "There
is nothing constructive about the
man; he is destructive. He builds
nothing; he tears things dofon."
On a less serious note, Davis exp
lains that he is doing everyone a
favor by running for the governor
ship.
"I do want to reduce the un
employment in California, and so
I'm applying for a job, you see?"
Like any other job applicant,
Davis is going to have to present his
credentials. He thinks he has what
it takes.
"I ran a police department for
eight and a half years," he proc
laims proudly, almost standing to
attention as he speaks. "Crime in
Los Angeles went down several
percentage points in those eight
years. Crime in the nation rose
about 60 per cent. That is effective
ness in administration."
As chief of the Los Angeles Police
Department, Davis instituted a
number of innovative police prac

tices. He started "Team policing,"
with teams of officers assigned to
various areas within the city. The
Neighborhood Watch, a program
which stressed police involvement
in the community and public coop
eration in crime prevention, was
also established. But discipline and
conformity are easier to impose on
a city police force than on the maze
of state government agencies.
Complexities
Davis appears to have no set idea
of how he would play around with
those agency complexities. His
campaign doesn't run on issues. In
fact, the bandwagon so far has only
one asset to sell: ex-Chief Ed Davis.
There are no plans, no proposals.
)ust a tall, gray-haired,
distinguished-looking conservative
from Orange County.
Davis says he has been getting a
good response from California vot
ers since he started "testing the
waters" for the gubernatorial race
about a year ago. Without making
his candidacy official, he began ac
cepting speaking engagements out
side Los Angeles, sniffing the politi
cal air in other parts of California.
"I liked very much the reception I
got," Davis says. "Every place I go, I
have to stand and sign autographs.
They want their children to have
their picture taken with me."
But proud parents and
autograph-seekers are not the only
members of the electorate in
California. Davis may find other
voters harder to convince.
For example, at a recent function,
Davis had a chance to win over the

ladies and gentlemen of the press.
Speaking at the annual dinner of
the Peninsula Press Club at the
Ramada Inn in Millbrae, the ex
police chief sought in vain to instill
a little law and order into the ranks
of 250 mildly inebriated and very in
attentive guests.
Maybe Davis was ill at ease be
cause his keynote speech had been
moved up on the schedule. Events
were running late, and he had a
plane to catch.
"I entertain for a living now, and
so I have an entertainment in Los
Angeles," Davis quipped. The Press
Club audience was not amused.
As Davis attempted to entertain
them with campaign horror stories
of missed flights and farmers'
groups in Sacramento, the dinner
guests chatted among themselves,
giving their speaker only slight at
tention. After all, he is new to cam
paigning. Many of the press mem
bers had covered election after
election. Only tales of a catastrophe
would make them stop in their
tracks. Missing PSA to Sacramento
is not hot news.
Questions
So Davis tried another tack. He
mined the audience for questions,
and got some good ones. The )arvis
amendment. State education.
California's water supply. The 160-
acre law.
Davis' replies were, for the most
part, confused and confusing. On
education, he started strongly: "I'll
tell you something I'm not going to
abolish, and that's schools."
But, after that reassurance, Davis
lapsed. He concluded that a two
day seminar "on a hard-data basis"
would solve some problems in edu
cation.
"He'll never make it in a million
years, I'll tell you that," declared a
Channel 20 reporter. A veteran of
both state and national campaign
coverage, she seemed more in
terested in applying more lipstick to
her already-glossy lips than in lis
tening to what Davis had to say.
Her attention was held, however,
by Davis' hurried reply to her ques
tion: "Why do you feel you are
qualified to be governor?"
"I can't tell you all of the incredi
ble qualities I have," Davis replied.
However, his answer dealt not
with the reasons why he would
make a good governor, but why
Jerry Brown has been such a bad
one.
"Jerry is an elitist," Davis said.
"He occasionally comes down from
the Parthenon into the streets of
Athens, and spends a night in the
pink palace."

Stony silence suggested that the
audience did not share Davis' opin
ion of the present governo'r. Hut
then again, the press and their
friends are a notoriously hard audi
ence to win over. It's their |ob to be
cynical, to ask questions.
