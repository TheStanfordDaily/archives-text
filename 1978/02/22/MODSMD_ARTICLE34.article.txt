## Museum photo collection: history, diversity 
### 
The Stanford Museum s
photographic collection can be
characterized by its consistent
recognition ot pioneers,
mavericks and innovators ot
the art form.
In fact, it was Governor Le
land Stanford s own interest in
photography that, directly and
indirectly, spawned the last six
yeais of active photographic
collecting by the Museum. Fol
lowing the phenomenal suc
cess of the Eadweard Muyb
ridge show in 1972, com
memorating the centennial of
his commission by Stanford,
Anita Mozley was named
Curator of Photography. Her
efforts and subsequent shows
hav helped foster the collec
tion which includes at least
300 individual prints and count
less album and stereoscopic
images.
Muybridge was hired in 1872
to document Stanford s exper
iments in animal locomotion,
including the well-known gal
loping horse series. The gov
ernor hoped to apply these
findings to his scientific
method of race horse training.
One result of Muybridge s
work was the invention of the
zoopraxiscope, precursor of
the movie projector. The zoop
raxiscope was so accurate in
recreating motion that Stan
ford could identify each horse
byithe rhythm of its gait.
While Stanford Sr. was de
voted to scientific uses of
photography, Leland Stanford
jr.; became something of an
amateur photographer and col
lector himself. Leland )r. s
photographic gadgets, part of
the Stanford family
memorabilia, and the animal

locomotion plates make up the
earliest entries of the perma
nent collection.
The Muybridge show was a
massive undertaking, involv
ing collaboration with Crocker
Gallery in Sacramento and
University of Southern
California. It took at least a year
to locate works, rebuild a
zoopraxiscope, and write and
raise funds' for the publication
of a catalogue. The show was
so successful that it traveled to
at least 20 other American
museums, and has just re
cently returned from Europe,
where the Museum s
catalogue was translated and
published in German for the
event.
Since then, Mozley has de
voted attention to other
photographic pioneers. In
1974, the first recent American
show of Julia Margaret Came
ron s work was held at Stan
ford, in part to exhibit four por
traits purchased by the
Museum. This exhibit helped
renew interest in Cameron,
and was prior to recent publi
cations and reprints of books
on the Victorian portraitess.
The late Imogen Cunnin
gham was honored by the first
major retrospective of her
work here, only months after
her death in 1976. Since then,
donations to the collection
have included portraits of the
popular artist as well as purch
ases or gifts of her work for use
in the show.
Alfred Stieglitz and the
Photo-Secessionists were the
topic of the recent "Camera
Work show, devoted to Stieg
litz influential journal of photo
criticism and aesthetics. A

number of his friends and fol
lowers are represented in the
collection.
Topics for shows and ideas
for purchases come from
members of the staff based on
their knowledge of what is av
ailable and what might be
timely or of special interest to
Stanford. Works are frequently
donated by collectors who are
impressed by a Museum show,
and the permanent collection
covers almost the whole his
tory of photography.
Chronicled in the collection
is the controversy over who
produced the first true photo
graph. Both Daguerre, a Fren
chman, and Talbot, an En
glishman, worked on the pro
cess unknown to each other
during the 1830s. Daguerre s
proclamation of his invention
in 1839 was followed by the
rage for "daguer
reotypemania," as well as Tal
bot's claim of priority.
However, Talbot's method,
which is similar to our present
negative-positive photo
graphy, became the base on
which modern photography
was built, while Daguerre s
method fell into disuse by the
1850s.

This revolution in technol
ogy was crucial to the pioneer
ing landscape photographers
in the collection — Timothy
O Sullivan, C.E. Wat kins,
Muybridge and W.H. Jackson.
All photographed in the west
or California after the 1850s,
using bulky view cameras and
glass plate collodion negatives
up to 16 by 20 inches in size.
These mammoth plates had
to be prepared on the spot,
necessitating use of a portable
darkroom, packed in by mule
or horse. Yosemite, the popu
lar subject for photographers
and landscape painters at this
time, is well documented in
the collection.
A print attributed to Mathew
Brady and a half-dozen prints
by his Civil War staff, including
O'Sullivan, are another exam
pleof 19th century documenta
tion under extreme duress.
Most remarkable is the superb
beauty of these prints, particu
larly the large landscapes.
The Muybridge show, was,
in part, an attempt to show the
artist behind the much touted
scientific advances of the
locomotion series. Known as
"the man who made the horse
photographs," Muybridge had

made innumerable landscape
and portrait photographs prior
to his association with Stan
ford. Although it seems likely
that the Stanfords owned some
of his landscape work, no
prints have been discovered
from their collection except for
the locomotion work. This
makes up the core of the col
lection.
Ironically, this artist, who
was to inspire movie makers
and almost all modern artists
using sequential imagery was
forced to break with Stanford
after the governor refused to
give him credit for his work in
the publication of their exper
iments. Stanford felt, to Muyb
ridge's chagrin, that these
photos were simply docu
ments and certainly negligible
as art work.
Fortunately, the plates were
not destroyed or lost during
their dispute. Muybridge,
however, had to seek
employment elsewhere. He
began his own work at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania in 1882,
where his own book was pub
lished. The Stanfords retained
a proof book of the "Attitudes
of Animals in Motion," still in
the Museum.
The collection is by no
means exclusively of 19th cen
tury works. As well as Cunnin
gham's prints, there are works
by Ansel Adams, Wynn Bul
lock, Paul Strand, Edward Wes
ton and Minor White. One
rapidly growing section in
cludes work donated by
former Stanford students and
young photographers that are
anything but traditional. A re
cent gift was of color photo
copy prints.
Most of these works are not
presently on view for the pub

lie. However, a selection of
19th century works are dis
played in the hall to the main
office of the Museum.
The eclecticism of the Stan
ford collection demonstrates
well the multi-dimensional na
ture of the medium. It has
served as historical documen
tation, poetic self-expression,
scientific device and more.
Above all, the growth of the
collection, and recent shows
have reflected the importance
of Stanford to the history of
photography and of photo
graphy to the history of Stan
ford.

and was prior to recent publi
cations and reprints of books
on the Victorian portraitess.
The late Imogen Cunnin
gham was honored by the first
major retrospective of her
work here, only months after
her death in 1976. Since then,
donations to the collection
have included portraits of the
popular artist as well as purch
ases or gifts of her work for use
in the show.
Alfred Stieglitz and the
Photo-Secessionists were the
topic of the recent "Camera
Work show, devoted to Stieg
litz influential journal of photo
criticism and aesthetics. A

number of his friends and fol
lowers are represented in the
collection.
Topics for shows and ideas
for purchases come from
members of the staff based on
their knowledge of what is av
ailable and what might be
timely or of special interest to
Stanford. Works are frequently
donated by collectors who are
impressed by a Museum show,
and the permanent collection
covers almost the whole his
tory of photography.
Chronicled in the collection
is the controversy over who
produced the first true photo
graph. Both Daguerre, a Fren
chman, and Talbot, an En
glishman, worked on the pro
cess unknown to each other
during the 1830s. Daguerre s
proclamation of his invention
in 1839 was followed by the
rage for "daguer
reotypemania," as well as Tal
bot's claim of priority.
However, Talbot's method,
which is similar to our present
negative-positive photo
graphy, became the base on
which modern photography
was built, while Daguerre s
method fell into disuse by the
1850s.

This revolution in technol
ogy was crucial to the pioneer
ing landscape photographers
in the collection — Timothy
O Sullivan, C.E. Wat kins,
Muybridge and W.H. Jackson.
All photographed in the west
or California after the 1850s,
using bulky view cameras and
glass plate collodion negatives
up to 16 by 20 inches in size.
These mammoth plates had
to be prepared on the spot,
necessitating use of a portable
darkroom, packed in by mule
or horse. Yosemite, the popu
lar subject for photographers
and landscape painters at this
time, is well documented in
the collection.
A print attributed to Mathew
Brady and a half-dozen prints
by his Civil War staff, including
O'Sullivan, are another exam
pleof 19th century documenta
tion under extreme duress.
Most remarkable is the superb
beauty of these prints, particu
larly the large landscapes.
The Muybridge show, was,
in part, an attempt to show the
artist behind the much touted
scientific advances of the
locomotion series. Known as
"the man who made the horse
photographs," Muybridge had

made innumerable landscape
and portrait photographs prior
to his association with Stan
ford. Although it seems likely
that the Stanfords owned some
of his landscape work, no
prints have been discovered
from their collection except for
the locomotion work. This
makes up the core of the col
lection.
Ironically, this artist, who
was to inspire movie makers
and almost all modern artists
using sequential imagery was
forced to break with Stanford
after the governor refused to
give him credit for his work in
the publication of their exper
iments. Stanford felt, to Muyb
ridge's chagrin, that these
photos were simply docu
ments and certainly negligible
as art work.
Fortunately, the plates were
not destroyed or lost during
their dispute. Muybridge,
however, had to seek
employment elsewhere. He
began his own work at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania in 1882,
where his own book was pub
lished. The Stanfords retained
a proof book of the "Attitudes
of Animals in Motion," still in
the Museum.
The collection is by no
means exclusively of 19th cen
tury works. As well as Cunnin
gham's prints, there are works
by Ansel Adams, Wynn Bul
lock, Paul Strand, Edward Wes
ton and Minor White. One
rapidly growing section in
cludes work donated by
former Stanford students and
young photographers that are
anything but traditional. A re
cent gift was of color photo
copy prints.
Most of these works are not
presently on view for the pub

lie. However, a selection of
19th century works are dis
played in the hall to the main
office of the Museum.
The eclecticism of the Stan
ford collection demonstrates
well the multi-dimensional na
ture of the medium. It has
served as historical documen
tation, poetic self-expression,
scientific device and more.
Above all, the growth of the
collection, and recent shows
have reflected the importance
of Stanford to the history of
photography and of photo
graphy to the history of Stan
ford.
The Stanford Museum s
photographic collection can be
characterized by its consistent
recognition ot pioneers,
mavericks and innovators ot
the art form.
In fact, it was Governor Le
land Stanford s own interest in
photography that, directly and
indirectly, spawned the last six
yeais of active photographic
collecting by the Museum. Fol
lowing the phenomenal suc
cess of the Eadweard Muyb
ridge show in 1972, com
memorating the centennial of
his commission by Stanford,
Anita Mozley was named
Curator of Photography. Her
efforts and subsequent shows
hav helped foster the collec
tion which includes at least
300 individual prints and count
less album and stereoscopic
images.
Muybridge was hired in 1872
to document Stanford s exper
iments in animal locomotion,
including the well-known gal
loping horse series. The gov
ernor hoped to apply these
findings to his scientific
method of race horse training.
One result of Muybridge s
work was the invention of the
zoopraxiscope, precursor of
the movie projector. The zoop
raxiscope was so accurate in
recreating motion that Stan
ford could identify each horse
byithe rhythm of its gait.
While Stanford Sr. was de
voted to scientific uses of
photography, Leland Stanford
jr.; became something of an
amateur photographer and col
lector himself. Leland )r. s
photographic gadgets, part of
the Stanford family
memorabilia, and the animal

locomotion plates make up the
earliest entries of the perma
nent collection.
The Muybridge show was a
massive undertaking, involv
ing collaboration with Crocker
Gallery in Sacramento and
University of Southern
California. It took at least a year
to locate works, rebuild a
zoopraxiscope, and write and
raise funds' for the publication
of a catalogue. The show was
so successful that it traveled to
at least 20 other American
museums, and has just re
cently returned from Europe,
where the Museum s
catalogue was translated and
published in German for the
event.
Since then, Mozley has de
voted attention to other
photographic pioneers. In
1974, the first recent American
show of Julia Margaret Came
ron s work was held at Stan
ford, in part to exhibit four por
traits purchased by the
Museum. This exhibit helped
renew interest in Cameron,
and was prior to recent publi
cations and reprints of books

by his Civil War staff, including
O'Sullivan, are another exam
pleof 19th century documenta
tion under extreme duress.
Most remarkable is the superb
beauty of these prints, particu
larly the large landscapes.
The Muybridge show, was,
in part, an attempt to show the
artist behind the much touted
scientific advances of the
locomotion series. Known as
"the man who made the horse
photographs," Muybridge had

made innumerable landscape
and portrait photographs prior
to his association with Stan
ford. Although it seems likely
that the Stanfords owned some
of his landscape work, no
prints have been discovered
from their collection except for
the locomotion work. This
makes up the core of the col
lection.
Ironically, this artist, who
was to inspire movie makers
and almost all modern artists
using sequential imagery was
forced to break with Stanford
after the governor refused to
give him credit for his work in
the publication of their exper
iments. Stanford felt, to Muyb
ridge's chagrin, that these
photos were simply docu
ments and certainly negligible
as art work.
Fortunately, the plates were
not destroyed or lost during
their dispute. Muybridge,
however, had to seek
employment elsewhere. He
began his own work at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania in 1882,
where his own book was pub
lished. The Stanfords retained
a proof book of the "Attitudes
of Animals in Motion," still in
the Museum.
The collection is by no
means exclusively of 19th cen
tury works. As well as Cunnin
gham's prints, there are works
by Ansel Adams, Wynn Bul
lock, Paul Strand, Edward Wes
ton and Minor White. One
rapidly growing section in
cludes work donated by
former Stanford students and
young photographers that are
anything but traditional. A re
cent gift was of color photo
copy prints.
Most of these works are not
presently on view for the pub

lie. However, a selection of
19th century works are dis
played in the hall to the main
office of the Museum.
The eclecticism of the Stan
ford collection demonstrates
well the multi-dimensional na
ture of the medium. It has
served as historical documen
tation, poetic self-expression,
scientific device and more.
Above all, the growth of the
collection, and recent shows
have reflected the importance
of Stanford to the history of
photography and of photo
graphy to the history of Stan
ford.
The Stanford Museum s
photographic collection can be
characterized by its consistent
recognition ot pioneers,
mavericks and innovators ot
the art form.
In fact, it was Governor Le
land Stanford s own interest in
photography that, directly and
indirectly, spawned the last six
yeais of active photographic
collecting by the Museum. Fol
lowing the phenomenal suc
cess of the Eadweard Muyb
ridge show in 1972, com
memorating the centennial of
his commission by Stanford,
Anita Mozley was named
Curator of Photography. Her
efforts and subsequent shows
hav helped foster the collec
tion which includes at least
300 individual prints and count
less album and stereoscopic
images.
Muybridge was hired in 1872
to document Stanford s exper
iments in animal locomotion,
including the well-known gal
loping horse series. The gov
ernor hoped to apply these
findings to his scientific
method of race horse training.
One result of Muybridge s
work was the invention of the
zoopraxiscope, precursor of
the movie projector. The zoop
raxiscope was so accurate in
recreating motion that Stan
ford could identify each horse
byithe rhythm of its gait.
While Stanford Sr. was de
voted to scientific uses of
photography, Leland Stanford
jr.; became something of an
amateur photographer and col
lector himself. Leland )r. s
photographic gadgets, part of
the Stanford family
memorabilia, and the animal

locomotion plates make up the
earliest entries of the perma
nent collection.
The Muybridge show was a
massive undertaking, involv
ing collaboration with Crocker
Gallery in Sacramento and
University of Southern
California. It took at least a year
to locate works, rebuild a
zoopraxiscope, and write and
raise funds' for the publication
of a catalogue. The show was
so successful that it traveled to
at least 20 other American
museums, and has just re
cently returned from Europe,
where the Museum s
catalogue was translated and
published in German for the
event.
Since then, Mozley has de
voted attention to other
photographic pioneers. In
1974, the first recent American
show of Julia Margaret Came
ron s work was held at Stan
ford, in part to exhibit four por
traits purchased by the
Museum. This exhibit helped
renew interest in Cameron,
and was prior to recent publi
cations and reprints of books
on the Victorian portraitess.
The late Imogen Cunnin
gham was honored by the first
major retrospective of her
work here, only months after
her death in 1976. Since then,
donations to the collection
have included portraits of the
popular artist as well as purch
ases or gifts of her work for use
in the show.
Alfred Stieglitz and the
Photo-Secessionists were the
topic of the recent "Camera
Work show, devoted to Stieg
litz influential journal of photo
criticism and aesthetics. A

number of his friends and fol
lowers are represented in the
collection.
Topics for shows and ideas
for purchases come from
members of the staff based on
their knowledge of what is av
ailable and what might be
timely or of special interest to
Stanford. Works are frequently
donated by collectors who are
impressed by a Museum show,
and the permanent collection
covers almost the whole his
tory of photography.
Chronicled in the collection
is the controversy over who
produced the first true photo
graph. Both Daguerre, a Fren
chman, and Talbot, an En
glishman, worked on the pro
cess unknown to each other
during the 1830s. Daguerre s
proclamation of his invention
in 1839 was followed by the
rage for "daguer
reotypemania," as well as Tal
bot's claim of priority.
However, Talbot's method,
which is similar to our present
negative-positive photo
graphy, became the base on
which modern photography
was built, while Daguerre s
method fell into disuse by the
1850s.

This revolution in technol
ogy was crucial to the pioneer
ing landscape photographers
in the collection — Timothy
O Sullivan, C.E. Wat kins,
Muybridge and W.H. Jackson.
All photographed in the west
or California after the 1850s,
using bulky view cameras and
glass plate collodion negatives
up to 16 by 20 inches in size.
These mammoth plates had
to be prepared on the spot,
necessitating use of a portable
darkroom, packed in by mule
or horse. Yosemite, the popu
lar subject for photographers
and landscape painters at this
time, is well documented in
the collection.
