The Third Annual Stanford Daily Photo
graphy contest came off with a good deal of
success, as we think the winners printed in
this issue attest. There were more than 120
entries, which made the judges' decisions all
the more difficult.
judges were: Bruce Charonnat, a junior
product design major, former Daily photo
editor; Rob Erickson, a sophomore, also a
former Daily photo editor, now sports photo
graphy editor; and Jacob Young, former

editor of the Daily.
Prizes in the contest were made available
courtesy of Crick Photographic in the Old
Mill Shopping Center in Mountain View.
Prizes were a $30 gift certificate for the
grand prize, $20 gift certificates for first prize
and $10 gift certificates for second prize.
The Daily thanks each and every entrant,
and hopes that even more entries will be
received next year. Entrants may pick up
photos at the Daily offices, noon to 10 p.m.
daily.
