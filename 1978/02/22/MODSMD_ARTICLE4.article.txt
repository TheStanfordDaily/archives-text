# Delt initiation-day acts investigated

### Bill Burger 
The University is investigating the
occurrences surrounding the Feb.
12 initiation-day hospitalization of
three Delta Tau Delta members for
being "dangerously drunk," accord
ing to Tom Hornbeak, assistant di
rector of residential education.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said the situation was being
treated "as a medical matter of drug
abuse. There was some unusually
heavy drinking going on. It is a situ
ation we will treat quite seriously."
In addition, several Delt members
were allegedly treated at the Delt
house for minor cuts and bruises
and excessive drunkenness.
According to Lyons and
Hornbeak, the University is not
treating the matter as an initiation
event.
Delt President Gordon King said
the pledges "were on their own"
throughout that day. "Our initiation
isn't even mandatory," King said.
The Daily has learned that the
drunkenness occurred after the
formal initiation ceremony in the
foothills. All of the Delt pledges
who were formally initiated that
morning were present at what
Hornbeak termed, the "post
initiation celebration."
When first contacted by the
Daily, one of the three hospitalized
Delts said the three were sent to
the hospital because of "injuries"
and not excessive drunkenness.
One was said to have a cut over
his eye, another had caught cold
from having his shirt off and the
third had a sprained ankle.
Bill Snyder of the Stanford Medi
cal Center Information Office said
the three people brought to the
hospital were in stable condition
and were released later that day.
Snyder said that the three had
been admitted because of high al
cohol levels in the blood. Snyder
could not release more information
since all three cases involved into
xication.
"I am taking as neutral a role as I
can," Hornbeak said. "I have-to en
force University policy and I have
an obligation to the student group
that they are represented prop
erly."
Hornbeak said he had talked to
King and the Delt house associate

while looking into the situation.
"It wasn't mandatory as I under
stand it," Hornbeak said. "All those
that could attend were invited to do
so.
"If the house is found to be in
blatant violation of the hazing law I
can't tell what would progress from
there," Hornbeak said.
The California State Educational
Code prohibits initiation and hazing
activities which cause bodily harm
or embarrassment to a pledge.
"It is up to Norm (Robinson, di
rector of residential education)
whether he wants further fact
finding done," Hornbeak said.
"Croup coercion is cause for us
to look into it in a different way,"
Lyons said. "I don't know if it was a
part of initiation."
Bill Alhouse, the Delt chapter ad
viser, had heard nothing of the mat
ter until contacted by the Daily last
night. He called the formal initia
tion ceremony the "best I've ever
seen." He was not present for the
post-initiation celebration.
Alhouse, who has been the chap
ter adviser for seven years, said the
alumni keep in close touch with the
fraternity but added, "we can't be
there every minute of the day."
Leah Kaplan, assistant dean of
student affairs who lives near the
Delt house, said she became aware
of the goings-on at the Delt house
that afternoon when some of the
members were "driving down the
driveway in cars, tooting horns and
having a good time."
She later received a call from Dr.
David Torin, associate director of
the student health service, who was
treating the three Delts at the hos
pital.
Kaplan said Torin was concerned
about the people back at the house
and asked her to find out their con
dition. Kaplan said King told her
that five or six people were asleep
and that King was concerned about
their condition.
Kaplan said that Torin visited the
house later that day to insure that
the members were all right.
Hornbeak said the University's
first response to the situation was
to take "corrective measures. It is a
serious matter when we have three
students in Stanford Hospital and
five or so very ill back at the house.

"We are treating this as a health
and safety problem," Hornbeak
said. "We will help them in every
way we can."
"We are assuming it is a medical
problem and that people OD'd on
alcohol," said Robinson.
King said the Delts had a house
meeting after the occurrence 'l
which they "decided to have a gen
eral educational program" involving
speakers.
Hornbeak said that Torin will
have dinner at the house tonight
and will give a presentation on the
dangers of alcohol.
George Reppas, president of the
Delta Tau Delta house corporation
said a meeting will be held March 1
to discuss "future initiation ac
tivities.

"They did the responsible thing
in taking them to the hospital,"
Kaplan said. "It was a very close call
and could have been a tragic
thing."
The Delt fraternity has been in
volved in several instances of mis
conduct in the past. The fraternity
was suspended for two years in
1973 for numerous property
damage occurrences and for three
years in 197b for the trashing of
some fraternity houses following a
bachelor party at the Delt house.
The house was reinstated after
one year on suspension in both
cases, the second time against the
recommendation of the Subcom
mittee on Residences of the Com
mittee on Services to Students.
