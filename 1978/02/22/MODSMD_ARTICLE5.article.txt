Washington (AP) — Panamanian
leader Omar Torrijos knew that of
ficials of his government were en
gaged in drug trafficking but there
is "no conclusive evidence" that
Torrijos was involved, the Senate
intelligence committee said yester
day.
The committee said it found re
ports linking Torrijos to the drug
market were "largely secondhand
and of varying reliability."
Sen. Birch Bayh (D-lnd.), chair
man of the panel, told the Senate
that reliable intelligence showed
Torrijos knew about drug trafficking
by government officials "and did
not take sufficient action" to stop
his brother, Moises, from becoming
involved,
But he added that the committee
investigation of Omar Torrijos "has
turned up no conclusive evidence
that could be used in a court of
law." Bayh also said the panel
found no evidence that drug intelli
gence activities affected the final
terms of the Panama Canal treaties.
Sen. Charles Percy (R-lll.), who is
pro-treaty, called the opponents' ef
fort "a desperation move" and said

nothing had been revealed that, in
his judgment, would change votes
or sway the approximately 15
senators who are still undeclared
on the treaties.
Meantime, in New York, a six
year-old federal indictment unsea
led Tuesday accuses Moises Torrijos
of smuggling 155 pounds of heroin
into the United States from Panama
in 1971.
U.S. District )udge lack Weinstein
ordered the indictment unsealed
after U.S. Attorney David Trager
said the basic facts it contained had
become public knowledge.
Existence of the indictment was
disclosed last year, but a Justice
Department source said "it has
never been unsealed because we
have never found him back in this
country to arrest him."
In Panama, the government
controlled press has attacked the
U.S. Senate inquiry into reports ot
drug trafficking by the Panamanian
ruling family. One columnist said
the investigation is as reasonable as
a probe of admitted marijuana use
by President Carter's son Jack
would be.
