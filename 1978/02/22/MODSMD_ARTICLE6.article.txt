# Lyman 'lukewarm' on CIA guidelines
## 
### Rob Lempert 
President Richard Lyman, speak
ing on last night's KZSU Campus
Conference, denied he has
changed his mind about imposing
new guidelines on CIA-sponsored
research here and said sufficient
guidelines already exist.
Last May, Lyman argued in a let
ter to Stanford graduate David
Kraus against an explicit University
policy concerning dealings with the
CIA. But recently Lyman wrote to

Prof. Peter Stansky, chairman of the
Faculty Senate, recommending such
a policy be considered.
Lyman explained his apparent
shift by saying he has merely re
quested that the steering commit
tee consider bringing the question
before the Faculty Senate and that
he personally is "lukewarm" on the
matter.
The debate centers around possi
ble CIA-sponsored research and
dealings on university campuses.
Harvard recently adopted a specific
policy to handle the problem, part
of which dealt with controlling CIA
research. Lyman said there are al
ready prohibitions on secret re
search here so this portion of the
Harvard policy would be superflu
ous at Stanford.
Lyman also commented on a re
cent report that faulted the Over
seas Studies Program for not includ
ing enough Stanford professors on

their campuses. He said the
number of professors overseas
dropped when funds for the prog
ram in general were cut, but added
that since cuts have ended, so has
the drop in professors.
When asked whether he thought
the Stanford Committee on Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP)
was losing influence, Lyman said
the administration has no view on
the matter, but he personally feels
that SCRIP has not generated as
large a movement as it would have
liked by nc»v.
One of the reasons he cited for
this is SCRIP'S "slightly casual at
titude" towards money. The people
who slave over the budget or strug
gle with high tuition do not take
much sympathy with dismissing
$1.4 million dollars as mere froth on
the operating budget, said Lyman.
He added however that there is
still a lot of rightful moral outrage at

the state of affairs in South Africa
and that he is in no position to
judge the long run potential of the
movement.
Speaking of the proposed West
ern Culture Requirement, Lyman
said he favors, as he always has, a
mixed requirement, in which the
student can fill in a variety of ways.
He said there is less likely to be
objection if students are given
some options within the require
ment.
Lyman added it is too expensive
to try to revive Western Civ as it
used to be taught. He said he rec
ognized "the case for small group
teaching," but that "it is probably
too rich for our blood to have it all
done that way."
He also defended his idea of hav
ing several forms of classes trom
which the student could choose.

titude" towards money. The people
who slave over the budget or strug
gle with high tuition do not take
much sympathy with dismissing
$1.4 million dollars as mere froth on
the operating budget, said Lyman.
He added however that there is
still a lot of rightful moral outrage at

the state of affairs in South Africa
and that he is in no position to
judge the long run potential of the
movement.
Speaking of the proposed West
ern Culture Requirement, Lyman
said he favors, as he always has, a
mixed requirement, in which the
student can fill in a variety of ways.
He said there is less likely to be
objection if students are given
some options within the require
ment.
Lyman added it is too expensive
to try to revive Western Civ as it
used to be taught. He said he rec
ognized "the case for small group
teaching," but that "it is probably
too rich for our blood to have it all
done that way."
He also defended his idea of hav
ing several forms of classes trom
which the student could choose.
President Richard Lyman, speak
ing on last night's KZSU Campus
Conference, denied he has
changed his mind about imposing
new guidelines on CIA-sponsored
research here and said sufficient
guidelines already exist.
Last May, Lyman argued in a let
ter to Stanford graduate David
Kraus against an explicit University
policy concerning dealings with the
CIA. But recently Lyman wrote to

Prof. Peter Stansky, chairman of the
Faculty Senate, recommending such
a policy be considered.
Lyman explained his apparent
shift by saying he has merely re
quested that the steering commit
tee consider bringing the question
before the Faculty Senate and that
he personally is "lukewarm" on the
matter.
The debate centers around possi
ble CIA-sponsored research and
dealings on university campuses.
Harvard recently adopted a specific
policy to handle the problem, part
of which dealt with controlling CIA
research. Lyman said there are al
ready prohibitions on secret re
search here so this portion of the
Harvard policy would be superflu
ous at Stanford.
Lyman also commented on a re
cent report that faulted the Over
seas Studies Program for not includ
ing enough Stanford professors on

their campuses. He said the
number of professors overseas
dropped when funds for the prog
ram in general were cut, but added
that since cuts have ended, so has
the drop in professors.
When asked whether he thought
the Stanford Committee on Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP)
was losing influence, Lyman said
the administration has no view on
the matter, but he personally feels
that SCRIP has not generated as
large a movement as it would have
liked by nc»v.
One of the reasons he cited for
this is SCRIP'S "slightly casual at
titude" towards money. The people
who slave over the budget or strug
gle with high tuition do not take
much sympathy with dismissing
$1.4 million dollars as mere froth on
the operating budget, said Lyman.
He added however that there is
still a lot of rightful moral outrage at
