# Flu epidemic?
## 
### 
Instead of heading to the ski slopes
this weekend, a large number of
students were forced to head over
to Cowell Student Health Center
for an unwelcome sojourn, during
which they received treatment for
the flu. But the flu struck even
among those who did get away to
the slopes, and many students re
turned early from weekend trips to
join their fellow unfortunates whil
ing away the happy hours of
Washington's birthday sick in bed.
According to Dr. Gene Phillips at
Cowell there are twice the number
of students coming down with the
flu as is usual for this time of the
year. Doug Owens, resident assis
tant at Soto dormitory, said that "a
rough guess is that better than half
the dorm is sick with something."
Despite the discouraging outlook,
Barbara Dewey, administrative as
sistant at Cowell, said, "It's cer
tainly not an epidemic." So take
heart, flu victims. (Daily photo by
