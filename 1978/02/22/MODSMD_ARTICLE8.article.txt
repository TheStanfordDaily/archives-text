# Sense of wonder fading
## Space explo satisfies urges

The space program, as everyone knows, is alive and
well and living in California. The past couple of years has
seen the appearance of a space shuttle which, we hope,
will revitalize the American space program. Stanford has
its own representative in the shuttle program in the
person of astronaut physicist Sally Ride.
We have also heard the exploits of Russian cos
monauts and American astronauts working together in
space, the valiant but unsuccessful attempts by Viking to
answer the question of extra-terrestrial life on Mars, the
deployment of a search program for extra-terrestrial in
telligence, and the discovery of rings around Uranus by
a NASA science team, based at the Ames research center
barely five miles from here.
Still to come, we are promised vast new gold mines of
knowledge from the Voyagers to the outer planets, the
Large Space Telescope, and coming remote sensing
satellites. Even farther into the future, there are tantaliz
ing but uncertain hints of solar sailing to Mars, solar
satellite power stations, space colonies, and cyclopean
radioscope eyes scanning the heavens for sign of intelli
gence.
With all this activity, it is difficult to believe that the
space program is on the wane. In spite of its glamour and
excitement, space exploration has never been very
popular with budget-minded congressmen, and it is
constantly being derided by public advocates and the
socially aware members of academia, business and the
government.
They argue that space is a waste of money that could
be better spent in social welfare programs, or defense,
or economic expansion. With research budgets shrink
ing everywhere, it is no wonder that the space program
is especially vulnerable to the platitudinous cries of
"spend our money here on earth first, to solve our social
problems!" A fashionable argument, but poorly
thought-out.
Long range benefits meet problems
These self-appointed guardians of society's moral be
havior are falling victim to a tunnel vision typical of most
politicians. Space exploration, with a very few excep
tions, is a long-range investment whose social, political,
and economic benefits materialize much later than its
scientific ones. These benefits are of great practical
value, but only over the long range of time, and only for
the whole of earth's problems taken together.
Humans are accustomed to dealing with societal prob
lems within a short span of time, on a one-by-one basis.
Each problem was handled as a distinct concern, and we
were often unaware that social and natural processes are
profoundly related. The proverb goes, if you try to flood
the Sahara for farmland, you may create a desert
elsewhere.
And so it went, and so it goes. A sagging economy
needed pump priming by the federal government. A
rapidly degenerating environment needed new
technology to clean up. The spread of communism to
the third world needed a policy of containment. A
rapidly growing population needed a program of birth
control education.
Only more recently did we begin to realize that
perhaps nations were turning to alternate economic sys
tems in part because of a disenchantment with free

enterprise caused by recession. And this, in turn, was
one reason why the population began to increase
rapidly — to provide the family with some economic
security by the labor of its children. And the population
increase was one reason for the declining quality of the
environment, in addition to industrial expansion
triggered by the efforts to halt the recession . . .
Space bases survey earthly cradle
It seems then, that social problems are global in na
ture and effective solutions require an understandingof
how the world as a whole works. Herein lies the useful
ness of space. We can step out of the cradle, and survey
the world through space-based observation systems.
We can observe the spread patterns of industrial pol
lution in rivers, the growth of urban and suburban areas
to formulate better land management policies, as well as
signs of possible nuclear weapons facilities that might be
in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
We can develop new technology in a multinational
effort to improve the quality of life, and to bring nations
closer together, perhaps through communications satel
lite networks, earth resources surveillance systems, in
ternational space labs. A cooperative moonbase or in
terplanetary expedition would force nations to promul
gate laws and compacts for the peaceful exploration and
development of space. Space colonies would bring a
fresh perspective to the conservative, calcifying
societies of earth — that of the frontier society. In short,
the exploration and development of space would help
us attain a deeper understanding of earth processes, and
it would propel the world to the verge of its long-awaited
planetary culture.
Traveler's tales quench urges
Another reason justifying space exploration is less
tangible, harder to justify, but ultimately more impor
tant. The urge to explore is one of the most fundamen
tal, deep-rooted drives of human existence. Strangely, it
is not outwardly expressed in everyone, but a respon
sive chord is struck in all of us upon hearing the tales of
the returned traveler. Travel to the known is glamorous,
travel to the unknown is even more so. For through it,
we confront, and learn to understand and control our
fear of the unknown.
This is an activity we have been carrying on for millions
of years. For the exploration of space is merely the logi
cal extention of earliest migration of the anthropoids,
from Olduvai Gorge to spread throughout Africa,
Europe and Asia. It is the logical extension of the Euro
pean and Asian discovery of the Americas, and the rush
across the American frontier. We are a wandering race,
and in order that we be mentally healthy, in order to
have the knowledge that somewhere, some of us are
moving to new lands and shedding new light on old
mysteries.
The human race has lost some of its sense of wonder,
ever since that disenchantment with science and reason
set in. Pity. What we need now, more than anything else,
is the desire and the will to continue the human enter
prise, the spark of the visionary imagination, and the
delight in what is new. Why go into space? Because we
need to dream as much as we need to live.
