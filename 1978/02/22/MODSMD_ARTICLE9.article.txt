Capitalists worship Milton
We recently attended a lecture
given by the eminent economist/
political theorist/sociologist Profes
sor Milton Friedman, and have spent
the last week trying to determine
exactly what we saw. It has recently
dawned on us that the root of our
confusion lies in not realizing that, in
addition to the above titles, Profes
sor Friedman is a religious and
spiritual leader, and what we really
attendedwas not a lecture at all, buta
capitalist high mass.
We were there as the throngs of
guilt-ridden upper classes with their
"bless me Father Milton, for I have
sinned" faces approached the wal
nut altar of Kresge Auditorium. All
were seeking absolution for posses
sing so much while so many have so
little.
They did not go away dissap
pointed. For two hours we watched
Father Milton assail the demon of
government intervention, extoll the
virtues of the free market mechanism
and point out that the way to
economic salvation for the poverty
ridden is through confidence in
monetarist doctrine. There is no guilt
in wealth and profit, for God meant
the rich to be rich and the poor to be
poor. Citing a higher authority like
that, who could argue? Certainly not
the heretic from Chile, or the pos
sessed gentleman who quoted rival

religious leaders like John F. Ken
nedy.
The last rites of Keynesian
economics completed, Father Milton
moved on. With a wave of the Invisi
ble Hand, the pre-converted were
absolved of guilt for another year,
free to venture forth and walk the
road of profitable righteousness,
though the road is paved with the
bodies of minorities, women and the
eternally poor, who will always be
with us. Father Milton mounted his
eight-cylinder mule for the trek back
to the Hoover Monastery, for quiet
meditation on his next service and
the disposal of his honorarium.
Though his economic, political
and social theories were esoteric at
best, his religious Golden Rule came
through loud and clear: 'Those that
have the gold make the rules."
Go in peace Father Milton.

Reactionary students emerge
This past week at Stanford saw wit
ness to an event which is perhaps the
most distressing I have yet heard
about in my years here. Tuesday
night a group of concerned students
marched through campus to de
monstrate their personal convictions
on an issue of human freedom (apar

theid). They were met with anonym
ous yells from underclassmen dorm
windows labeling the protestors as
"Commies."
It would be difficult for me to
exaggerate in my description of the
overwhelming clutching sensation
which I felt at my throat and in my
heart when I first read of the event,
reported in the Daily the following
morning. I would love to be told it
was only a joke, but I know too well
by now that it wasn't. There really are
people out there — no, people right
here, at Stanford — who still con
sider an act of conscience a com
munist plot. In one fell swoop I felt
all the social and human progress of
the last two decades evaporate like
some vintage wine spilled atop
scorching concrete.
Has all the heightened under
standing of the past 20 years been
negated as we come full circle back
to the communist scare which obses
sed this country in the fifties, when
people actually lost their own human
integrity to the mire of crippling con
formism? Are we really in the midst
of a new era of unconsciousness at
Stanford, where anything which dis
pleases our sensibilities we can sim
ply condemn as "communist," ir
regardless of any truth?
But even more disheartening is the
realization that the voice which yel
led "Commie," was not just an un
educated racist in Selma, nor a near
sighted thug in Chicago, nor even a
lonely boy in Whittier, California. It
was a member of our community,
presumably a younger member, and
presumably very well educated in
having been afforded the opportun
ity of exposure to differing lifestyles
and manners of being among
peoples. There is no longer an ex
cuse of social or spiritual ignorance
to account for the irresponsibility of
this kind of reactionary behavior.
If Stanford is really the intellectual
center it is purported to be, which is
to produce a sizable portion of our
nation's leading figures in future de
cades, then we have an immense re
sponsibility before us. Perhaps it is as
much a burden as it is a gift, but
nonetheless we must accept it as
ours. We must accept the responsi
bility of our intellectual gifts intelli
gently and honestly, and not misuse
them at the whim of our own impetu
ous personal upsets.

Valiant attempt
Michael Jennings' account of his
reasons for dropping out (Daily,
Feb. 14) gave me some uneasy feel
ings. I have been thinking about

many of the same things he has,
and just wanted to thank him for his
valiant attempt to reach a few hearts
and minds. My uneasiness stems
from the fear that all he says is true.
The trouble is: how many people
read and thought about what he
said? Not many — and few of those
will let any visions of apocalypse
spoil their midterms. Sadly, only
those who agreed with the article,
at least on a general level, probably
took the time to understand it.
Those who have never stood back
to examine our rat race here proba
bly saw the title, muttered some
thing about "rads," and moved
quickly on to search for their initials
in the Valentine messages. So along
with Jennings I mourn a bit. I only
hope tha* I have the courage to
avoid falling (or resist jumping) into
the machine. "Enjoy the scenery"
... Is anybody listening?

Hopeful of repairs
Joe Ruetz, the director of athle
tics, deserves to be congratulated
on his public commitment to the
restoration and on-going mainte
nance of Angell Field. However,
some of us may be forgiven a de
gree of scepticism since we've
heard similar promises before. This
time it does seem that the director
means business. I hope that the re
pairs can be started as soon as pos
sible.
I have one or two comments
about the specifics of the director's
plan. First of all there is nothing in
it about repairs to the infield,
beyond the extermination of
gophers. The fact is that the infield
requires resodding wherever there
has been damage to the surface by
rodents. Moreover, the useless and
potentially dangerous patches of
asphalt must be removed and these
areas resodded.
The department may balk at
doing anything more than they have
proposed because what is already
planned "will require considerable
funds." The answer to this is that
the Staff Benefits Pool is paying out
"considerable funds" to the De
partment of Athletics yearly for
faculty-staff recreation. The sum for
1977 was $290,000. 1978 has seen a
17 per cent increase to some
$339,000 (see Operating Budget
Guidelines, 1977-78, p. 76). Even at
today's prices that kind of money
will pay for plenty of rehabilitation
and maintenance.
