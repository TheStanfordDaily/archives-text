New Wave rising
It was nice to see your reviewer
had a good time at the Clapton con
cert. I have always liked a lot of his
things, too. But what has he got
against the New Wave? In his com
ments about Player, he calls them, "a
talented group with an original
sound that is refreshing to hear in
contrast to 'The New Wave' and
some of the other garbage that is
being passed off as music these days."
The New Wave is a musical genre
that dates back to the roots of some
of today's most popular groups, like
the Who or Stones. Listen to "My
Generation," "Satisfaction," or "The
Kids Are Allright" if you don't think
so. It's not just )ohnny Rotten throw
ing up onstage, or punks with green
hair and safety pins through their
noses. Unfortunately for a lot of the
musical public it is, because it is

these elements that get the most
publicity.
In dismissing the New Wave as
garbage, he has effectively labeled
not only the Sex Pistols, but groups
and people like Elvis Costello, The
Ramones, Talking Heads, UFO, Patti
Smith, Blondie, The Runaways and a
hundred others. Of course not all of
it is perfect, but then not all of it is the
same, either. Many New Wave
groups possess talent that has been
recognized by publications such as
Rolling Stone, Creem, Time, News
week and most large American
newspapers.
For its home country of England,
and much of Europe New Wave is
the product of an underlying social
structure, and feelings of frustration
and rebellion on the part of a large
segment of the youth. In the U.S. it
has become a statement against the

hype and plastic promotionalism that
surround so much of the pop music
of today, as well as the candy coated
noises that alternate with zit
medicine commercials on today's
top 40 radio stations.
Everyone seems to forget that the
Beatles, Stones, Who etc. were first
publicized because of their long hair,
suggestive song lyrics and disregard
for the accepted social mores or the
early '60s. Their music was, at first,
dismissed as "garbage" too. Yet,
after the initial shock wave subsided,
it became an important force in the
musical world. The moral here seems
to be not to put down something
right away because you don't under
stand it or it scares you.
Who knows if the New Wave will
fizzle? For the moment it seems only
to be growing in popularity, here and
abroad. It is gaining in critical accep
tance. For it to be dismissed as "gar
bage" is both unfair and ignorant of
your reviewer. He has effectively
dismissed some of the best music of
recent years, which doesn't take an
orange permanent or a Hefty trash
bag shirt to enjoy. In the end, if all
the New Wave does is shock people
out of their musical complacency, it
has succeeded.

Administrative monopoly
It is reassuring to find that our om
niscent University administration has
a monopoly not only on power
within the decision-making ap
paratus of the University, but on the
definition of human nature as well,
as evidenced by Robert Hamrdla's
remarks in last Friday's Daily article
on SCRIP'S power on campus.
His argument that "divestment
comes at the end of the road, not the
beginning," is reminiscent of the
logic advanced during the U.S. milit
ary involvement in Vietnam, when
the "light at the end of the tunnel"
could only be reached by destroying
the country to "save" the Viet
namese.
My human nature finds it repulsive
that Stanford continues to profit
from the systematic injustice in

South Africa. Stanford should divest.

Headline inaccurate
A reporter's job is not easy. For her
article in the Daily of Friday, Feb. 17,
Emily Sachar was working under
pressure, taking notes from a rather
hurried conversation on the tele
phone. I believe she paraphrased
what I had to say reasonably accu
rately.
Let me call attention, however, to
one significant fact: I was speakingas
an individual, responding to ques
tions posed at the Daily's, not my,
initiative. My comments and those
from Vice President Rosenzweig
neither imply nor permit the
generalized headline of the article.
A much more accurate title than
"Administration Questions SCRIP'S
Power on Campus" would have been
"Administrators Respond to Ques
tions about SCRIP'S Influence on
Campus."

Consensus takes time
I feel that the public understand
ing of the issue of investor responsi
bility for corporations in South Africa
has been unfortunately distorted by
recent events.
Many proxy resolutions regarding
South Africa are imminent. There
fore I would recommend that the
ASSU Senate go anead and approve
the student representatives already
chosen by the Nominations Commit
tee for the CIR.
This may sound like a regressive
move to take. I disagree. If change is
going to occur, we need to use every
means possible (including public
education) to have the trustees con
tinue to examine the ethical issues
before them.
I am confident that consensus can
occur between the trustees and ad
vocates of divestment, but it will take
time. Make no mistake about it, the
revolution will come.
