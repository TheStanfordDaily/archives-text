## Feminism shocks some 
### 
John Markus

Ah, the perils of a male under
graduate trying to deal with the
highly sensitive issue of sexual
equality. It all started when I, just
having arrived on campus as a
treshperson, unknowingly opened
a library door for Stanford's most rad
ical feminist. The tongue-lashing I
received for what I thought to be a
kind gesture has resulted in trauma
— tothisday my sleep is haunted bya
recurring nightmare in which I'm
Bert Parks using a tube of Brylcreem
that Gloria Steinem has spiked with
anchovy paste.
It's unfortunate that I've had to
suffer so, because I am one of the
most egalitarian-minded individuals
alive today. You'll never see me in
the crowds at a wet t-shirt contest,
unless someone is buying my lunch,
and I believe every woman should
have the opportunity to attend a
wet jockey-shorts contest. Admit
tedly, this might be faulty reason
ing, but let's dispense with reason
ing and get right at the issue.
For males now in their early twen
ties, the introductory onslaught of
feminism was somewhat of a shock.
It was not easy to pass from puberty

directly into women's liberation.
Most post-pubescent males have
such high hormone levels that
they're liable to treat anything with
a body temperature as a sex object.
And many of us were socially hand
icapped. Pity the young man who
hails from an area like Bovina, Kan
sas, where to this day, farmers strap
their wives to huge paper airplanes
to do the crop dusting.
Fortunately, many of us have
come to realize the evils of sexual
impulsiveness and Bovina, Kansas.
Through education and the know
ledge gained from everyday social
interaction, we have seen women
as our intellectual and spiritual
equals, deserving of any oppor
tunities afforded to men.
However, a few staunch feminists
have become so defensive in their
bloodhound search for "sexism,"
they've thrown our language and
culture into a state of confusion. To
these women, anything said or
done might be labeled "sexist." And
believe me, if you're a male who's
afraid of committing a "sexist" of
fense and offending someone, life
becomes difficult — I know mine
has.
For example, I nearly was laughed
out of Macy's yesterday when I
asked a sale's clerk to direct me to
the Person's Lingerie department.
And this is the first time in my life
that I've taken a copy of Playboy
into my closet just to cut out a
coupon good for a discount on
Newsweek.
The problems of pronouns has
become so intense that I find my
self formulating sentences only
about eunuchs or people in Mardi
Cras costumes. And last week, I
spent hours in Palo Alto dressed in

a boy scout uniform trying to con
vince old ladies to help me across
the street.
This is why I must caution over
zealous feminists about alienating
some of your most effective sup
porters: males. Agreed, certain
standard social conventions are
sexist, but we must be careful about
abandoning them too quickly. It
should be a gradual process akin to
weaning.
For example, men: stop referring
to a female friend as "sweetie,"
"flower," or "my ol' lady." Gradu
ally de-gender your pet names until
you get to the point where you're
calling her "my configuration of
cells" or "Being." What's great
about these terms is that they are
non-judgmental and can be used by
both sexes. And although their
usage might throw a damper on an
evening in front of the fireplace,
these names can serve as the first
concrete slabs on the road to equal
ity.

a body temperature as a sex object.
And many of us were socially hand
icapped. Pity the young man who
hails from an area like Bovina, Kan
sas, where to this day, farmers strap
their wives to huge paper airplanes
to do the crop dusting.
Fortunately, many of us have
come to realize the evils of sexual
impulsiveness and Bovina, Kansas.
Through education and the know
ledge gained from everyday social
interaction, we have seen women
as our intellectual and spiritual
equals, deserving of any oppor
tunities afforded to men.
However, a few staunch feminists
have become so defensive in their
bloodhound search for "sexism,"
they've thrown our language and
culture into a state of confusion. To
these women, anything said or
done might be labeled "sexist." And
believe me, if you're a male who's
afraid of committing a "sexist" of
fense and offending someone, life
becomes difficult — I know mine
has.
For example, I nearly was laughed
out of Macy's yesterday when I
asked a sale's clerk to direct me to
the Person's Lingerie department.
And this is the first time in my life
that I've taken a copy of Playboy
into my closet just to cut out a
coupon good for a discount on
Newsweek.
The problems of pronouns has
become so intense that I find my
self formulating sentences only
about eunuchs or people in Mardi
Cras costumes. And last week, I
spent hours in Palo Alto dressed in

a boy scout uniform trying to con
vince old ladies to help me across
the street.
This is why I must caution over
zealous feminists about alienating
some of your most effective sup
porters: males. Agreed, certain
standard social conventions are
sexist, but we must be careful about
abandoning them too quickly. It
should be a gradual process akin to
weaning.
For example, men: stop referring
to a female friend as "sweetie,"
"flower," or "my ol' lady." Gradu
ally de-gender your pet names until
you get to the point where you're
calling her "my configuration of
cells" or "Being." What's great
about these terms is that they are
non-judgmental and can be used by
both sexes. And although their
usage might throw a damper on an
evening in front of the fireplace,
these names can serve as the first
concrete slabs on the road to equal
ity.

Ah, the perils of a male under
graduate trying to deal with the
highly sensitive issue of sexual
equality. It all started when I, just
having arrived on campus as a
treshperson, unknowingly opened
a library door for Stanford's most rad
ical feminist. The tongue-lashing I
received for what I thought to be a
kind gesture has resulted in trauma
— tothisday my sleep is haunted bya
recurring nightmare in which I'm
Bert Parks using a tube of Brylcreem
that Gloria Steinem has spiked with
anchovy paste.
It's unfortunate that I've had to
suffer so, because I am one of the
most egalitarian-minded individuals
alive today. You'll never see me in
the crowds at a wet t-shirt contest,
unless someone is buying my lunch,
and I believe every woman should
have the opportunity to attend a
wet jockey-shorts contest. Admit
tedly, this might be faulty reason
ing, but let's dispense with reason
ing and get right at the issue.
For males now in their early twen
ties, the introductory onslaught of
feminism was somewhat of a shock.
It was not easy to pass from puberty

directly into women's liberation.
Most post-pubescent males have
such high hormone levels that
they're liable to treat anything with
a body temperature as a sex object.
And many of us were socially hand
icapped. Pity the young man who
hails from an area like Bovina, Kan
sas, where to this day, farmers strap
their wives to huge paper airplanes
