# Close Encounters II
## Nerds: we need them 
### 
Nick Burbules

Warren and I had a few minutes
to spare while we were waiting for
computer time at LOTS, so we sat
down for a Dr. P and a Clark bar.
"Well, Warren," I asked, "what
do you think of all this nerd busi
ness going around lately?"
"To tell you the truth, it bothers
me a lot," Warren replied, "I don't
see myself as a creepy, repulsive
character, and it bothers me that
other people do."
"I know what you mean. I won
der why it's become such a big
thing all of a sudden; even the
Daily has a nerd column."
"Yeah, very funny — and how
about that nerd poster at the
bookstore, the one that tells you all
of the identifying characteristics of
a nerd."
"Right — boogers in the pocket
and all that. You know,' I wonder
what the opposite of a nerd is —
have you ever thought about it?"
With that, Warren and I set out to
design a poster that describes the
characteristics of the non-nerd.
Obviously, there are many varieties,
but one archetype made itself clear:
— Rugby shirt — we weren't sure
why this is so popular, unless it's to
imply an athletic aura (even for
those who have never seen a rugby
ball). Football jerseys are cool, too.
— Slacks — any style, but the
lighter in color the better; best is
dazzling white, even when it rains.
This lends a "California look."
— Shoes — very important. Ex
pensive running shoes for daily
wear are absolutely de rigueur;
especially flashy are those with waf

fie soles that are obviously de
signed only for running.
— Books — none in sight, if pos
sible. Best is to carry none at all,
lest someone get the notion that
you are a red-hot. If you must carry
books, put them in an expensive
Sierra Designs knapsack — no one
will know if you're going to the lib
rary or to Yosemite.
— In the pockets — car keys, of
course (how else can you get to the
O, or Carmel, or Tahoe?); oh yes,
and money. Money is at the heart
of it all, really, since it makes every
thing else possible....
Warren and I went on for quite a
while, and I'm afraid we started get
ting a little vindictive before it was
over, but I think you've got a good
idea of the person we had in mind.
One thing we both agreed on was
that, whatever other difference
there might be betweeen the nerd
and the non-nerd, we nerds didn't
have to build up our self-image by
laughing at anyone else.
"You know," Warren said as he
walked off to an open terminal, "I
don't think people understand that
we use computers and slide rules
and pocket calculators because we
need them for our schoolwork, not
because we love machines. We
drink beer and tell |okes and think
about pretty girls, just like all the
other guys here. If we re eccentric
and clannish, it's just because only
other nerds understand the hard
work and the loneliness in what we
have to do."

One thing we both agreed on was
that, whatever other difference
there might be betweeen the nerd
and the non-nerd, we nerds didn't
have to build up our self-image by
laughing at anyone else.
"You know," Warren said as he
walked off to an open terminal, "I
don't think people understand that
we use computers and slide rules
and pocket calculators because we
need them for our schoolwork, not
because we love machines. We
drink beer and tell |okes and think
about pretty girls, just like all the
other guys here. If we re eccentric
and clannish, it's just because only
other nerds understand the hard
work and the loneliness in what we
have to do."

Warren and I had a few minutes
to spare while we were waiting for
computer time at LOTS, so we sat
down for a Dr. P and a Clark bar.
"Well, Warren," I asked, "what
do you think of all this nerd busi
ness going around lately?"
"To tell you the truth, it bothers
me a lot," Warren replied, "I don't
see myself as a creepy, repulsive
character, and it bothers me that
other people do."
"I know what you mean. I won
der why it's become such a big
thing all of a sudden; even the
Daily has a nerd column."
"Yeah, very funny — and how
about that nerd poster at the
bookstore, the one that tells you all
of the identifying characteristics of
a nerd."
"Right — boogers in the pocket
and all that. You know,' I wonder
what the opposite of a nerd is —
have you ever thought about it?"
With that, Warren and I set out to
design a poster that describes the
characteristics of the non-nerd.
Obviously, there are many varieties,
but one archetype made itself clear:
— Rugby shirt — we weren't sure
why this is so popular, unless it's to
imply an athletic aura (even for
those who have never seen a rugby
ball). Football jerseys are cool, too.
— Slacks — any style, but the
lighter in color the better; best is
dazzling white, even when it rains.
This lends a "California look."
— Shoes — very important. Ex
pensive running shoes for daily
wear are absolutely de rigueur;
especially flashy are those with waf

fie soles that are obviously de
signed only for running.
— Books — none in sight, if pos
sible. Best is to carry none at all,
lest someone get the notion that
you are a red-hot. If you must carry
books, put them in an expensive
Sierra Designs knapsack — no one
will know if you're going to the lib
rary or to Yosemite.
— In the pockets — car keys, of
course (how else can you get to the
O, or Carmel, or Tahoe?); oh yes,
and money. Money is at the heart
of it all, really, since it makes every
thing else possible....
Warren and I went on for quite a
while, and I'm afraid we started get
ting a little vindictive before it was
over, but I think you've got a good
idea of the person we had in mind.
