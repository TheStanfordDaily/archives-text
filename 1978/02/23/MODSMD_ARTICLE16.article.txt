# Task force studies refuge management

Washington (AP) — A new
task force study of the national
wildlife refuge system poses
ominous questions about the
government's future role in
managing its refuges.
The study, which has not
been publicly released, de
clares: "Refuges are for
wildlife, and utilization by
people should at no time be
detrimental to wildlife re
sources and to the extent pos
sible should be beneficial."
That sentence is the heart of
the report, and is bound to stir
the most controversy. It could
force changes in the old way of
managing wildlife refuges,
especially regarding hunting,
fishing and trapping.
There are 384 refuges com
prising nearly 34 million acres
in the national wildlife refuge
system. The lands host a great
diversity of wildlife — Canada
geese and green-winged teal,
brown bears and white-tailed
deer, cottontail rabbits and
prairie dogs.
Hunting is permitted on a
great number of refuges. By
federal law, up to 40 per cent of
a refuge may be opened to

waterfowl gunning. But many
refuges also permit hunting of
such resident species as deer,
squirrels, rabbits, quail,
pheasants and even antelope.
Significantly, the report
states that "grazing, timber
harvesting and agricultural
practices may be abusive and
should be used only when
necessary for proper manage
ment of wildlife resources."
It also says pesticides and
animal control should be
employed only as "last resorts
when no feasible alternatives
exist."
But in addressing the
sportsman, the task force says
"under carefully designed
regulations, hunting, fishing
and trapping are consistent
with the concept of providing
habitat in refuges for healthy
populations of wildlife and are
compatible with sound wildlife
management principles and
practices.
"On the other hand," it
notes, "hunting, trapping or
fishing should be prohibited if
these activities are actually or
potentially damaging to prim
ary refuge objectives."
