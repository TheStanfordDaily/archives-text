# Murray analyzes China relations

The United States should
look at the question of rela
tions with China and the prob
lem of Taiwan as a long-term
strategic matter in the U.S. in
terest, said Douglas Murray,
director of the U.S.-China Re
lations Program at Stanford, in
d talk Tuesday at Bechtel Inter
national Center.
"The long-term benefits of
normalization to the U.S. posi
tion in the world may far out
weigh any short-term costs due
to changes in our relations with
Taiwan," Murray said.
Recognizing China in place
of Taiwan, on China's terms,
would not mean the physical
takeover of Taiwan in the
foreseeable future, Murray
said.
"Life in Taiwan would go on
essentially as it is now," Mur
ray said. "The P.R.C. (People's
Republic of China), in my view,
is not just unlikely, but certain
not to take physically aggres
sive steps against Taiwan.
"Teddy Kennedy may be
waiting in the wings, as soon as
the Panama Canal argument
dies down, to come rushing in
with a big push for normaliza
tion," Murray said. "But who
knows?"
Murray was in China last Oc
tober with a delegation from
the National Committee on
U.S.-China Relations.
The Chinese indicated that
their position on normalization
of relations remained un

changed, Murray said, but they
signaled that they understood
no movement was possible at
the present time.
The number of private
American visitors to China has
increased rapidly in recent
years, Murray said, and China
expects the number of Ameri
can tourists in 1978 to double
the 1977 number. "All of this is
really a revolution in China's
foreign relations," Murray
said. "There's less fear and
paranoia of contamination
from contact with the West.
"It's going to put real strains
on the Chinese political sys
tem," Murray said. "How do
you cope with this new contact
with the world? It's not going
to be easy."
As he left China, Murray
said, the one thing he feared
was that "the new authorities
have initiated changes in so
many areas of life, they may
have started something they
can't control."
Murray listed liberalization
in the arts, wage increases, a
call for more consumer pro
ducts, a call for more open
criticism, and institution of
newspaper letters to the editor
as examples of recent changes
in China.
"We are going to see China
going through a period of real
tension," Murray said, "need
ing to maintain this openness
on the one hand, but maintain
a viable political system on the
other."
