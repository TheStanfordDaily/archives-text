## Olsen enters Democratic primary 
### Robin Millington 
Kirsten Olsen, 35, a financial counselor
with the Palo Alto office of Paine, Webber,
Jackson & Curtis, has announced her can
didacy for the Democratic nomination for
the 12th Congressional District.
The June primary will pose Olsen
against Ron Davis, the other announced
Democratic candidate. The winner of the
primary will challenge incumbent Paul
"Pete" McCloskey in the November gen
eral election.
Olsen's campaign will be run by her
husband, Thomas Skornia, who lost in his
bid for the Democratic nomination for the
same seat in 1974.
The campaign will not officially begin
unti I Olsen and her six newly hired staffers
can obtain a campaign office. Olsen said
no definite plans have been made for the
campaign, butadded itwill be in full swing
by March.
Olsen stressed that passing the Equal
Rights Amendment will be her top priority
should she be elected. "I feel it should be
extended. If we don't get it passed this

time, I will push to start it over again."
The second of Olsen's concerns is to see
a national energy bill enacted that "will not
only help us to conserve energy, but will
encourage us to look at other forms of
energy."

She said she opposes nuclear energy
and believes the government should look
to other resources such as the develop
ment of solar or geothermal energy.
Thirdly, she said the district is large and
populous and that the economy "is related
to the electronics industry around here. I
would be for other electronics companies
coming in and expanding," Olsen said.
When asked why she chose to run,
Olsen said she "always wanted to see
women in politics. People have told me I
haveagood personality and why notgofor
something big.
Olsen, who is statewide vice-president
of the Women's Equity Action League and
is involved in the National Women's
Caucus said she is concerned about repre
senting women's concerns in govern
ment.
Olsen said she has not yet had time to
research McCloskey's or Davis' positions
on most issues, such as the Panama Canal
Treaty, and reserves comment until she
had time to familiarize herself with the
other candidates' stands.
