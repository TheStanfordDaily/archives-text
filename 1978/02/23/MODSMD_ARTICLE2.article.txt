# Native American enrollment declining
## 
### Becki Bridges 
The number of native Americans
entering the freshman class here
each year has declined noticeably
since the early 1970s statistics reveal,
from a high of 24 freshmen in 1971 to
the current 11.
Dean of Admissions Fred Harga
don, commenting on the reason for
the decline, said the Admissions Of
fice has recently become more selec
tive and so has admitted fewer native
Americans.
Hargadon said that when the Ad
missions Office first concentrated on
admitting more native Americans it
was "not as selective" as it should
have been. The Admissions Office
placed more emphasis on the
number being admitted rather than
on fulfillment of the usual strict re
quirements, Hargadon said.
High dropout rate
He added that because of this, the
Admissions Office later noticed a
high dropout rate among native
American students.
"As we are more selective, we have
less problems and more success,"
Hargadon said. "We want to make

sure they will have an opportunity to
succeed and will have an impact after
they leave the University."
Francis Robert, a member of the
Hare tribe, said the Admissions Of
fice is "steadily cutting back" the
number of native Americans admit
ted because the office feels it
"doesn't do any good to let them in if
they just drop out."
Robert said the Admissions Office
does not realize these students are
not dropping out but stopping out.
Logic unclear
He added, "I don't understand
their logic behind decreasing the
number admitted in order to in
crease the number graduating."
Larry Corospe, assistant dean of
student affairs, said, "The University
has been looking at a different, smal
ler pool of students" recently which
may have caused the decline in na
tive American enrollment.
"Admissions wants a certain type
of student, one who is very close to
the 'typical Stanford student.' " He
may be native American ethnically,
Gorospe said, but may not be identi
fiable as having native American val

ues.
"They often are from Eastern prep
schools or urban societies. Only half
actually come from a reservation
area," he added.
Recruiting policy
Robert said Stanford now recruits
from schools without significant na
tive American enrollment. This pol
icy represses native American en
rollment, he added.
Hargadon agreed there is limited
recruitment of native Americans. Al
though the Admissions Office used

to recruit students from reserva
tions, this wasn't found to be benefi
cial as "the schools were really terri
ble," he said.
Currently, organizations such as
the College Board Search Service
give the Admissions Office lists of
promising native American students.
Not enough eligible
But Hargadon said few native
Americans graduate from high
school and even fewer go on to col
lege, much less an institution such as
Stanford.
"It's not as if they are all out there
waiting to go to Stanford." There are
simply not enough eligible students
from which the Admissions Office
can choose, according to Hargadon.
"We try not to play with numbers,
we try to get the ones who will suc
ceed. That's the best recruiting in the
long run," said Hargadon.
Though Gorospe said he thought
native American enrollment was "go
ing up in other schools," Hargadon
said that "no school on our (Stan
ford's) level has a significant number
of native Americans."

not dropping out but stopping out.
Logic unclear
He added, "I don't understand
their logic behind decreasing the
number admitted in order to in
crease the number graduating."
Larry Corospe, assistant dean of
student affairs, said, "The University
has been looking at a different, smal
ler pool of students" recently which
may have caused the decline in na
tive American enrollment.
"Admissions wants a certain type
of student, one who is very close to
the 'typical Stanford student.' " He
may be native American ethnically,
Gorospe said, but may not be identi
fiable as having native American val

ues.
"They often are from Eastern prep
schools or urban societies. Only half
actually come from a reservation
area," he added.
Recruiting policy
Robert said Stanford now recruits
from schools without significant na
tive American enrollment. This pol
icy represses native American en
rollment, he added.
Hargadon agreed there is limited
recruitment of native Americans. Al
though the Admissions Office used

to recruit students from reserva
tions, this wasn't found to be benefi
cial as "the schools were really terri
ble," he said.
Currently, organizations such as
the College Board Search Service
give the Admissions Office lists of
promising native American students.
Not enough eligible
But Hargadon said few native
Americans graduate from high
school and even fewer go on to col
lege, much less an institution such as
Stanford.
"It's not as if they are all out there
waiting to go to Stanford." There are
simply not enough eligible students
from which the Admissions Office
can choose, according to Hargadon.
"We try not to play with numbers,
we try to get the ones who will suc
ceed. That's the best recruiting in the
long run," said Hargadon.
Though Gorospe said he thought
native American enrollment was "go
ing up in other schools," Hargadon
said that "no school on our (Stan
ford's) level has a significant number
of native Americans."
The number of native Americans
entering the freshman class here
each year has declined noticeably
since the early 1970s statistics reveal,
from a high of 24 freshmen in 1971 to
the current 11.
Dean of Admissions Fred Harga
don, commenting on the reason for
the decline, said the Admissions Of
fice has recently become more selec
tive and so has admitted fewer native
Americans.
Hargadon said that when the Ad
missions Office first concentrated on
admitting more native Americans it
was "not as selective" as it should
have been. The Admissions Office
placed more emphasis on the
number being admitted rather than
on fulfillment of the usual strict re
quirements, Hargadon said.
High dropout rate
He added that because of this, the
Admissions Office later noticed a
high dropout rate among native
American students.
"As we are more selective, we have
less problems and more success,"
Hargadon said. "We want to make

sure they will have an opportunity to
succeed and will have an impact after
they leave the University."
Francis Robert, a member of the
Hare tribe, said the Admissions Of
fice is "steadily cutting back" the
number of native Americans admit
ted because the office feels it
"doesn't do any good to let them in if
they just drop out."
Robert said the Admissions Office
does not realize these students are
not dropping out but stopping out.
