# Realtors go against tax relief bill
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) â€” Assembly
Speaker Leo McCarthy said
yesterday that heavy lobbying
by realtors may force suppor
ters to drop this year's top
property tax relief bill and get
behind a backup measure.
The San Francisco Democrat
said the lobbying was "soften
ing" borderline votes for the
Senate-passed bill, SB 1, mak
ing it unlikely backers could
muster the two-thirds majority
needed for approval.
Meanwhile, the Assembly
Ways and Means Committee
put off a vote on SB 1 to give
aides time to study proposed
amendments.
Both bills were introduced
by Sen. Peter Behr (R-Tiburon)
and are nearly identical. SB Ix,
however, needs only a majority
vote since its funding would be
in the new state budget.
They are designed to cut
homeowners property taxes by
at least 40 per cent and boost
renter tax relief.
SB 1 has picked up increased
support in recent weeks and
begun to emerge as the Legis
lature's answer to the Jarvis
property tax initiative, a June
ballot measure critics claim
would cripple local govern
ments.
McCarthy said that as of now
50 of the Assembly's 57 Demo
crats and only one of the 23
Republicans might vote for SB
1. At least 54 votes, a two-thirds
majority, are needed for pas
sage.
