# Short people have all kinds of reasons to live

Being shrimpy has its advantages.
Forone, small peoplecanfind terrific
clothing bargains by shopping at the
children's department or buying their
bicycles from Toys 'R' Us. They are also
treated more affectionately than tall
people.
But sometimes, a "pipsqueak" does
run into annoyances.
"I once heard they were looking for
trolls at Magic Mountain," remarked
Mari Yamashiro,4"lO'/;i", referring to an
amusement park in Southern Califor
nia. "So I applied; but they turned me
away — they said I was too short."
The anti-short people movement,
suggested satirically by Randy Newman
in his top ten hit "Short People," is not
quite the nasty little myth it may be
touted to be, for comfort in American
does often depend upon one's "sta
ture" in society.
Dentists' doorknobs, for instance,
are placed high out of the reach of chil
dren — and too high for the "grubby
little fingers" of short people, as well.
And although Newman has insisted
that short people "wear platform shoes
on their nasty little feet," he has neg
lected the small detail that shoes are
seldom made for adults with "size two"
feet.
Even the automobile manufacturers
of America fail to take short people into
account. Yamashiro requires two pil
lows in the driver's seat — "one under
and one behind" — in order to make
her family's little station wagon go
"beep, beep, beep."
Ironic
None of Newman's lyrics are more
ironic than the line, "They gonna get
you every time." Consider the fears of a
short person who faces an everyday
battle with the elbows of the tall gener

ation. The very design of big people —
swinging elbows and "hockey stick
legs," as Tim Conway and Steve Lawr
ence term them — is an affront to little
people who happen to land in the
wrong crowds.
It is a lucky thing they have "little
voices" to "peep" up in their defense.
Nevertheless, the pint-sizers of today
are treated much more respectfully
than they once were. Some public
facilities are specially designed for the
handicapped, others for short people.
For example, the public is frequently
provided with a choice of drinking
fountains. Some individuals "stand so
low" they are unable to reach the adult
fountains, so Yamashiro explains,
"When there is a choice, I usually go for
the short one."
Since short people warrant so much
attention, one might very well wonder
what it takes to qualify as a "small fry."
Newman, however, was not quite ready
to say.
At first, when Rolling Stone writer
Charles Young asked thes'll" songwri
ter what his cut-off point would be for a
short person, Newman replied 5'6".
Children
Counting children, that response
might have put 40 per cent of the
human race into the "short" category.
Newman realized this and decided on
37".
The Little People of America (L.P.A.)
are more official about the height clas
sification. In order to join the 2000-
member organization, a person must
be 4"11" or under, or "of the propor
tionate or disproportionate dwarf
type." Under those criteria, Yamashiro
would qualify — at least most of the
time.
"In the mornings I'm 4"I1", " she
explains, "But nights I've usually

shrunk to 4"I0" — my vertebrae
squeeze down during the day."
Why, medically, do we have "little
dudes" in the first place? Why must
people come in different sizes?
Shortness usually results from an in
herited or acquired pituitary condition
which occurs, under the title of dwar
fism, in plants as well as animals. Most
short parents will have short children;
if their parents were small enough,
these children will be called Little Lit
tles" by the L.P.A.
Other reasons
Admittedly, there are other reasons
for people being short, aside from the
"short genes theory." Some are related
to heart and lung or kidney diseases,
others to nutrition problems.
Certain populations of diminutive
stature have managed to "grow as a na
tion" by simply substituting for rice in
their diets, the Japanese, for example.
Whatever the cause, many people
greatly enjoy the distinction of being
short. Yamashiro often wonders, she
said, "what it would like to be tall for a
week," but she quickly adds, "Then I
would want to return again."
Yamashiro said she has always ap
preciated being able to stand in the
front row for school pictures, even
though her last name would have
placed her at the end of the alphabet.
Being small has entitled her to such
special privileges as tipping off a high
school battle-of-the-sexes basketball
game against a regular basketball
player. "And I won," she adds.
People of small stature must, how
ever, no matter how "high" their self
estimation, contend with the shortcom
ings of their size.
Love, for example, is so great a prob
lem that it is listed among the priorities
of the L.P.A., along with "fellowship,

interchange of ideas, moral support
and solutions to unique problems of
little people."
Dating
A short gentleman may not be con
cerned about dating a woman twice his
height, but she may feel somewhat un
comfortable towering over him, even if
he does not have a "dirty little mind."
Both individuals are defying society's
standard of the Great American Dream
Couple.
"Never has my brother been so ex
cited," Yamashiro said, "as the day he
met a new girl . . . He came running up
and told me, 'Guess what? She's even
shorter than I am!" Her brother, 21, is
5'2".
The problem of height differences is
most easily solved on television and
movie screens, where hand«.omr* men
are expected to look tall ano dark, ot
short and squat.
Alan Ladd, father-in-law of the now
ange'ic Cheryl Ladd, is an actor ot small
physical stature. In most cases h/ .-it
tual size can be increased or, tilrn
through the use of miniaturized seis ui
small stools.
Ditch dug
In a recent filming of Ladd walking
along the beach with Sophia Loren,
however, Loren had to walk in a ditch
so that the two would appear the same
height.
How would society stand today with
out the help of our hobbits and our
Rumpelstilzchens, our munchkinsand
our cupids, our "little general" Napo
leon and our "close encounters" with
little green men?
"Probably about five inches taller on
the average," you may reply.
But that would only revise the stan
dard — for there will always be a "shor
test" in our species.

Yamashiro,4-foot-10'/2, would still not measure up to her 6-6 tall

type." Under those criteria, Yamashiro
would qualify — at least most of the
time.
"In the mornings I'm 4"I1", " she
explains, "But nights I've usually

shrunk to 4"I0" — my vertebrae
squeeze down during the day."
Why, medically, do we have "little
dudes" in the first place? Why must
people come in different sizes?
Shortness usually results from an in
herited or acquired pituitary condition
which occurs, under the title of dwar
fism, in plants as well as animals. Most
short parents will have short children;
if their parents were small enough,
these children will be called Little Lit
tles" by the L.P.A.
Other reasons
Admittedly, there are other reasons
for people being short, aside from the
"short genes theory." Some are related
to heart and lung or kidney diseases,
others to nutrition problems.
Certain populations of diminutive
stature have managed to "grow as a na
tion" by simply substituting for rice in
their diets, the Japanese, for example.
Whatever the cause, many people
greatly enjoy the distinction of being
short. Yamashiro often wonders, she
said, "what it would like to be tall for a
week," but she quickly adds, "Then I
would want to return again."
Yamashiro said she has always ap
preciated being able to stand in the
front row for school pictures, even
though her last name would have
placed her at the end of the alphabet.
Being small has entitled her to such
special privileges as tipping off a high
school battle-of-the-sexes basketball
game against a regular basketball
player. "And I won," she adds.
People of small stature must, how
ever, no matter how "high" their self
estimation, contend with the shortcom
ings of their size.
Love, for example, is so great a prob
lem that it is listed among the priorities
of the L.P.A., along with "fellowship,

interchange of ideas, moral support
and solutions to unique problems of
little people."
Dating
A short gentleman may not be con
cerned about dating a woman twice his
height, but she may feel somewhat un
comfortable towering over him, even if
he does not have a "dirty little mind."
Both individuals are defying society's
standard of the Great American Dream
Couple.
"Never has my brother been so ex
cited," Yamashiro said, "as the day he
met a new girl . . . He came running up
and told me, 'Guess what? She's even
shorter than I am!" Her brother, 21, is
5'2".
The problem of height differences is
most easily solved on television and
movie screens, where hand«.omr* men
are expected to look tall ano dark, ot
short and squat.
Alan Ladd, father-in-law of the now
ange'ic Cheryl Ladd, is an actor ot small
physical stature. In most cases h/ .-it
tual size can be increased or, tilrn
through the use of miniaturized seis ui
small stools.
Ditch dug
In a recent filming of Ladd walking
along the beach with Sophia Loren,
however, Loren had to walk in a ditch
so that the two would appear the same
height.
How would society stand today with
out the help of our hobbits and our
Rumpelstilzchens, our munchkinsand
our cupids, our "little general" Napo
leon and our "close encounters" with
little green men?
"Probably about five inches taller on
the average," you may reply.
But that would only revise the stan
dard — for there will always be a "shor
test" in our species.

Even with "platform shoes on her nasty little feet," junior Mari
Yamashiro,4-foot-10'/2, would still not measure up to her 6-6 tall
neighbor, senior Mike Christie.
Being shrimpy has its advantages.
Forone, small peoplecanfind terrific
clothing bargains by shopping at the
children's department or buying their
bicycles from Toys 'R' Us. They are also
treated more affectionately than tall
people.
But sometimes, a "pipsqueak" does
run into annoyances.
"I once heard they were looking for
trolls at Magic Mountain," remarked
Mari Yamashiro,4"lO'/;i", referring to an
amusement park in Southern Califor
nia. "So I applied; but they turned me
away — they said I was too short."
The anti-short people movement,
suggested satirically by Randy Newman
in his top ten hit "Short People," is not
quite the nasty little myth it may be
touted to be, for comfort in American
does often depend upon one's "sta
ture" in society.
Dentists' doorknobs, for instance,
are placed high out of the reach of chil
dren — and too high for the "grubby
little fingers" of short people, as well.
And although Newman has insisted
that short people "wear platform shoes
on their nasty little feet," he has neg
lected the small detail that shoes are
seldom made for adults with "size two"
feet.
Even the automobile manufacturers
of America fail to take short people into
account. Yamashiro requires two pil
lows in the driver's seat — "one under
and one behind" — in order to make
her family's little station wagon go
"beep, beep, beep."
Ironic
None of Newman's lyrics are more
ironic than the line, "They gonna get
you every time." Consider the fears of a
short person who faces an everyday
battle with the elbows of the tall gener

ation. The very design of big people —
swinging elbows and "hockey stick
legs," as Tim Conway and Steve Lawr
ence term them — is an affront to little
people who happen to land in the
wrong crowds.
It is a lucky thing they have "little
voices" to "peep" up in their defense.
Nevertheless, the pint-sizers of today
are treated much more respectfully
than they once were. Some public
facilities are specially designed for the
handicapped, others for short people.
For example, the public is frequently
provided with a choice of drinking
fountains. Some individuals "stand so
low" they are unable to reach the adult
fountains, so Yamashiro explains,
"When there is a choice, I usually go for
the short one."
Since short people warrant so much
attention, one might very well wonder
what it takes to qualify as a "small fry."
Newman, however, was not quite ready
to say.
At first, when Rolling Stone writer
Charles Young asked thes'll" songwri
ter what his cut-off point would be for a
short person, Newman replied 5'6".
Children
Counting children, that response
might have put 40 per cent of the
human race into the "short" category.
Newman realized this and decided on
37".

out the help of our hobbits and our
Rumpelstilzchens, our munchkinsand
our cupids, our "little general" Napo
leon and our "close encounters" with
little green men?
"Probably about five inches taller on
the average," you may reply.
But that would only revise the stan
dard — for there will always be a "shor
test" in our species.

Even with "platform shoes on her nasty little feet," junior Mari
Yamashiro,4-foot-10'/2, would still not measure up to her 6-6 tall
neighbor, senior Mike Christie.
Being shrimpy has its advantages.
Forone, small peoplecanfind terrific
clothing bargains by shopping at the
children's department or buying their
bicycles from Toys 'R' Us. They are also
treated more affectionately than tall
people.
But sometimes, a "pipsqueak" does
run into annoyances.
"I once heard they were looking for
trolls at Magic Mountain," remarked
Mari Yamashiro,4"lO'/;i", referring to an
amusement park in Southern Califor
nia. "So I applied; but they turned me
away — they said I was too short."
The anti-short people movement,
suggested satirically by Randy Newman
in his top ten hit "Short People," is not
quite the nasty little myth it may be
touted to be, for comfort in American
does often depend upon one's "sta
ture" in society.
Dentists' doorknobs, for instance,
are placed high out of the reach of chil
dren — and too high for the "grubby
little fingers" of short people, as well.
And although Newman has insisted
that short people "wear platform shoes
on their nasty little feet," he has neg
lected the small detail that shoes are
seldom made for adults with "size two"
feet.
Even the automobile manufacturers
of America fail to take short people into
account. Yamashiro requires two pil
lows in the driver's seat — "one under
and one behind" — in order to make
her family's little station wagon go
"beep, beep, beep."
Ironic
None of Newman's lyrics are more
ironic than the line, "They gonna get
you every time." Consider the fears of a
short person who faces an everyday
battle with the elbows of the tall gener

ation. The very design of big people —
swinging elbows and "hockey stick
legs," as Tim Conway and Steve Lawr
ence term them — is an affront to little
people who happen to land in the
wrong crowds.
It is a lucky thing they have "little
voices" to "peep" up in their defense.
Nevertheless, the pint-sizers of today
are treated much more respectfully
than they once were. Some public
facilities are specially designed for the
handicapped, others for short people.
For example, the public is frequently
provided with a choice of drinking
fountains. Some individuals "stand so
low" they are unable to reach the adult
fountains, so Yamashiro explains,
"When there is a choice, I usually go for
the short one."
Since short people warrant so much
attention, one might very well wonder
what it takes to qualify as a "small fry."
Newman, however, was not quite ready
to say.
At first, when Rolling Stone writer
Charles Young asked thes'll" songwri
ter what his cut-off point would be for a
short person, Newman replied 5'6".
Children
Counting children, that response
might have put 40 per cent of the
human race into the "short" category.
Newman realized this and decided on
37".
The Little People of America (L.P.A.)
are more official about the height clas
sification. In order to join the 2000-
member organization, a person must
be 4"11" or under, or "of the propor
tionate or disproportionate dwarf
type." Under those criteria, Yamashiro
would qualify — at least most of the
time.
"In the mornings I'm 4"I1", " she
explains, "But nights I've usually

shrunk to 4"I0" — my vertebrae
squeeze down during the day."
Why, medically, do we have "little
dudes" in the first place? Why must
people come in different sizes?
Shortness usually results from an in
herited or acquired pituitary condition
which occurs, under the title of dwar
fism, in plants as well as animals. Most
short parents will have short children;
if their parents were small enough,
these children will be called Little Lit
tles" by the L.P.A.
Other reasons
Admittedly, there are other reasons
for people being short, aside from the
"short genes theory." Some are related
to heart and lung or kidney diseases,
others to nutrition problems.
Certain populations of diminutive
stature have managed to "grow as a na
tion" by simply substituting for rice in
their diets, the Japanese, for example.
Whatever the cause, many people
greatly enjoy the distinction of being
short. Yamashiro often wonders, she
said, "what it would like to be tall for a
week," but she quickly adds, "Then I
would want to return again."
Yamashiro said she has always ap
preciated being able to stand in the
front row for school pictures, even
though her last name would have
placed her at the end of the alphabet.
Being small has entitled her to such
special privileges as tipping off a high
school battle-of-the-sexes basketball
game against a regular basketball
player. "And I won," she adds.
People of small stature must, how
ever, no matter how "high" their self
estimation, contend with the shortcom
ings of their size.
Love, for example, is so great a prob
lem that it is listed among the priorities
of the L.P.A., along with "fellowship,

interchange of ideas, moral support
and solutions to unique problems of
little people."
Dating
A short gentleman may not be con
cerned about dating a woman twice his
height, but she may feel somewhat un
comfortable towering over him, even if
he does not have a "dirty little mind."
Both individuals are defying society's
standard of the Great American Dream
Couple.
"Never has my brother been so ex
cited," Yamashiro said, "as the day he
met a new girl . . . He came running up
and told me, 'Guess what? She's even
shorter than I am!" Her brother, 21, is
5'2".
The problem of height differences is
most easily solved on television and
movie screens, where hand«.omr* men
are expected to look tall ano dark, ot
short and squat.
Alan Ladd, father-in-law of the now
ange'ic Cheryl Ladd, is an actor ot small
physical stature. In most cases h/ .-it
tual size can be increased or, tilrn
through the use of miniaturized seis ui
small stools.
Ditch dug
In a recent filming of Ladd walking
along the beach with Sophia Loren,
however, Loren had to walk in a ditch
so that the two would appear the same
height.
