# Students experiment with sleep deprivation

While some students brag
about "pulling an all-nighter,"
and staying awake for up to 24
hours, sophomore Ellen
Winograd can boast she stayed
awake for 84 continuous hours
as part of an experiment for her
"Sleep and Dreams" section
on sleep deprivation.
"I felt great afterwards, and I
felt great during the experi
ment," said Winograd. "I don't
regret it. There just isn't that
much difference between get
ting a good night's sleep and
not getting one."
According to section co
leader Rich Henderson, "As far
as we know, Winograd broke
the record for a woman staying
awake continually without arti
ficial stimulants." The previous
record was set by Kirste Wilde,
a Stanford graduate and news
broadcaster in San Francisco,
who stayed awake for about 74
hours, he said.
The purpose of the experi
ment was "to get people in

volved in sleep deprivation and
learn about experimental pro
cedure," said Henderson.
Three other students, Beth
Linder, Hugh Mackworth and
Mike Schaeffer, also partici
pated in the experiment by
staying awake for 62 hours
each.
Linder said "It was painful to
stay awake. I had the most
problem between 3 and 4:30
a.m. If there hadn't been
people jabbing me all the time,
I wouldn't have been able to
stay awake," she added.
Winograd agreed that she
"would fluctuate between
being really awake and really
tired," but added, "As long as I
could keep up with activities
that I liked then I wouldn't be
tired."

In sleep deprivation, "the
hardest thing is to keep people
awake," said Mark Rosekind,
research director of the sleep
research facility. "The trick is
to keep people moving. Mus
cular exercise is an important
factor," he added.
Each of the sleep-deprived
students had other section
members monitoring them
during the experiment to keep
them awake and to periodically
test their sleepiness, reaction
rate and mood.
"It was really a good chance
to meet people, working on a
one-to-one basis with a
monitor. Vou talk a lot and tell
a lot of things you wouldn't
normally say," remarked
Winograd.
"I had one monitor trom 4 to

8 a.m. and I laughed for the
whole four hours straight," she
added with a giggle.
Some of the activities the
students used to help them
stay awake included tennis,
ping pong, disco dancing at 6
a.m. and baking fudge brow
nies at 4 a.m.
"I don't know if it was con
sequence of the sleep depriva
tion or not, but the brownies
came out terrible," Schaefter
added jokingly.
When the students ended
their period of sleep depriva
tion, they were hooked up to
monitoring machines at the
sleep research facility for their
"recovery sleep."
Winograd said she slept tor
13'/i hours for her recovery
night, and slept a couple hours

longer than normal the next
night.
The other students were
awakened after sleeping tor 10
hours.
"I slept deeply, but when I
woke up the next morning I felt
fine, and I slept normally after
that," said Schaeffer.
According to Rosekind,
there are still "a lot of ques
tions about how long you have
to sleep
"What we consider the rid
dle of the century is why we
need sleep and what the pur
pose ot sleep is," said
Rosekind. "All that research
has been able to determine so
far is that the greatest reason
tor why we sleep is to keep
from getting sleepy," he con
cluded.
