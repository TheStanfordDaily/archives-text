We got bargains, bargains, bar

We got value, value, value. . .
You don' know the meaning of
the word
Tom Waits, between shows,
is crumpled in a backstage
chair. He is picking at his teeth,
and has his other hand at his
temple; he looks tired, and
sweaty. When Waits speaks he
rocks himself back and forth
with calm deliberation; he has
a cigarette, and sunken eyes.
He has half a smile, half a
grimace and a sad, enduring
expression. He looks resigned
to some strange fate.
Waits is polite to his "non-
Walter WincheN" interviewers,

but every now and then he
cannot sublimate his frustra
tion. He gives the expected
quotes again ("I'm from North
Hollywood, and my neighbors
are sons of bitches. . .Touring
with the Mothers was cruel and
unusual punishment . . .I'd
rather be home watching The
Rifleman'. . ."). He is even
gruffly friendly ("Come on,
boy, spit it out, your career's
on the line"), but every now
and then he loses his patience
with the questions. Then he
speaks loudly, abruptly. For
the most part, though, he
stares at the ground, and is al
most completely inaudible.
I don't have a good time. I do

not have fun, and I do not have
a good time. I am not enjoying
touring, and when I go home I
will not go out to parties. This
is not fun.
Waits speaks with deliberate
melancholy, but he never
seems slow or lazy. As a matter
of fact, meeting Waits leaves
very little doubt that he sees
most things with crystal clarity.
The dominant sensation, when
meeting Waits, is that of a man
very thoughtful — when he
speaks the mixture of eloqu
ence and pith is more than a lit
tle unsettling.
Tom Waits' music is grimy
and foul at the same time it is
subtle and crafted — his songs

are stuff from the bowels of the
city that refuse to stay in their
place. They are grimy works of
art, like the flip side of a Nor
man Rockwell painting. He
writes about bad livert and the
ones that got away, and he
plays what he writes with the
kind of devotion and intelli
gence that such material de
serves. Tom Waits' music con
tinually takes seemingly dead
phrases and gives them breath
and life — it has a thousand
false bottoms and does not rest
easy on any one level of mean
ing. It fools you, and hurts you,
then soothes with bitter senti
ment.
. . .it's a battered old suitcase
to a hotel someplace
and a wound that will never
heal
no prima donna the perfume is
on
an old shirt that is stained
with blood and whiskey
and goodnight to the street
sweepers
the night watchman flame
keepers
and goodnight Matilda too
Tom Waits played last Sun
day at Dinkelspiel auditorium,

and he had none of the prob
lems he occasionally has in
concert.
In the past there had been a
friction of sorts between per
sona and musician. Waits had
had trouble projecting his
emotional and technical com
plexities, and it often looked
(from a distance) as if he was
nothing more than a happy
go-lucky wino. His songs went
fast, then, and they seemed im
itations of the albums — when
he moved it came across as dis
tracting, out of context.
In those days Waits seemed
sometimes to be parodying
himself, simplifying, playing
to the part of his audience that
saw him as a modern-day
Bacchus-from-the-bowery.
Waits was not sure what to
do with a big crowd then — he
played it conservatively and
deprived us of most of his
genius. The genuine article
was missing on stage.
But not now. Waits has hit
his stride now, and he showed
it here last Sunday. Last Sunday
he played a little slower, and
looser, and he never once
stifled a strut; little was mis

sing, or out of place, and none
of his truths got short shrift.
I ain't sentimental
this ain't a purchase it's a rental
and its purgatory, hey
what's your story, well
I don't even care
I've got my own double cross
to bear
Tom Waits last Sunday gave a
desperately good perfor
mance, in which attitudes to
ward the audience were a cent
ral part of the show. One mi
nute he was with us as a drink
ing buddy and chum-type, and
in the next he looked as if he
was ready to sit down and cry.
It was hostility, and then it was
pain, and then it was strange
detachment — all the way
through you never lost sight of
his brooding, volatile intelli
gence. It was a potent show,
among the best I've ever seen.
Yea, and there were a lot of
empty seats out there. A lot
of empty seats. Must be
Washington's Birthday. . .
Tom Waits did a show in
Dinkelspiel — a controlled and
organic drama. He had his au
dience by the neck., and he
gave us all a good wringing. He

sang a bluesy, extended "Pas
ties and a G-String" and had us
all stomping and cheering, and
he did "Tom Traubert's
Blues" with a face that left us
stone cold sober. He brought a
vibe player and drummer —
Chick Whiting — who gave
things an eerie continuity, and
Frank McKenn's saxophone
was properly only barely under
control.
With Whiting and McKenna
Ray Young's bass, Tom Waits'
back-up was just as a back-up
should be — it was coordi
nated and squarely behind
every move that the headliner
made.
its an early bird matinee

.. .Tom Waits' manager
opens the dressing room door
and gives him a "get ready"
nod of the head — Waits looks
at the mirror, then back at the
floor, and exhales a cloud of
smoke. Five minutes later, in
the second show, he is knoc
kin' 'em off their leet. Again.

We got bargains, bargains, bar

We got value, value, value. . .
You don' know the meaning of
the word
Tom Waits, between shows,
is crumpled in a backstage
chair. He is picking at his teeth,
and has his other hand at his
temple; he looks tired, and
sweaty. When Waits speaks he
rocks himself back and forth
with calm deliberation; he has
a cigarette, and sunken eyes.
He has half a smile, half a
grimace and a sad, enduring
expression. He looks resigned
to some strange fate.
Waits is polite to his "non-
Walter WincheN" interviewers,

but every now and then he
cannot sublimate his frustra
tion. He gives the expected
quotes again ("I'm from North
Hollywood, and my neighbors
are sons of bitches. . .Touring
with the Mothers was cruel and
unusual punishment . . .I'd
rather be home watching The
Rifleman'. . ."). He is even
gruffly friendly ("Come on,
boy, spit it out, your career's
on the line"), but every now
and then he loses his patience
with the questions. Then he
speaks loudly, abruptly. For
the most part, though, he
stares at the ground, and is al
most completely inaudible.
I don't have a good time. I do

not have fun, and I do not have
a good time. I am not enjoying
touring, and when I go home I
will not go out to parties. This
is not fun.
Waits speaks with deliberate
melancholy, but he never
seems slow or lazy. As a matter
of fact, meeting Waits leaves
very little doubt that he sees
most things with crystal clarity.
The dominant sensation, when
meeting Waits, is that of a man
very thoughtful — when he
speaks the mixture of eloqu
ence and pith is more than a lit
tle unsettling.
Tom Waits' music is grimy
and foul at the same time it is
subtle and crafted — his songs

are stuff from the bowels of the
city that refuse to stay in their
place. They are grimy works of
art, like the flip side of a Nor
man Rockwell painting. He
writes about bad livert and the
ones that got away, and he
plays what he writes with the
kind of devotion and intelli
gence that such material de
serves. Tom Waits' music con
tinually takes seemingly dead
phrases and gives them breath
and life — it has a thousand
false bottoms and does not rest
easy on any one level of mean
ing. It fools you, and hurts you,
then soothes with bitter senti
ment.
. . .it's a battered old suitcase
to a hotel someplace

heal

and goodnight Matilda too
Tom Waits played last Sun
day at Dinkelspiel auditorium,

and he had none of the prob
lems he occasionally has in
concert.
In the past there had been a
friction of sorts between per
sona and musician. Waits had
had trouble projecting his
emotional and technical com
plexities, and it often looked
(from a distance) as if he was
nothing more than a happy
go-lucky wino. His songs went
fast, then, and they seemed im
itations of the albums — when
he moved it came across as dis
tracting, out of context.
In those days Waits seemed
sometimes to be parodying
himself, simplifying, playing
to the part of his audience that
saw him as a modern-day
Bacchus-from-the-bowery.
Waits was not sure what to
do with a big crowd then — he
played it conservatively and
deprived us of most of his
genius. The genuine article
was missing on stage.
But not now. Waits has hit
his stride now, and he showed
it here last Sunday. Last Sunday
he played a little slower, and
looser, and he never once
stifled a strut; little was mis

sing, or out of place, and none
of his truths got short shrift.
I ain't sentimental
this ain't a purchase it's a rental
and its purgatory, hey
what's your story, well
I don't even care
I've got my own double cross
to bear
Tom Waits last Sunday gave a
desperately good perfor
mance, in which attitudes to
ward the audience were a cent
ral part of the show. One mi
nute he was with us as a drink
ing buddy and chum-type, and
in the next he looked as if he
was ready to sit down and cry.
It was hostility, and then it was
pain, and then it was strange
detachment — all the way
through you never lost sight of
his brooding, volatile intelli
gence. It was a potent show,
among the best I've ever seen.
Yea, and there were a lot of
empty seats out there. A lot
of empty seats. Must be
Washington's Birthday. . .
Tom Waits did a show in
Dinkelspiel — a controlled and
organic drama. He had his au
dience by the neck., and he
gave us all a good wringing. He

sang a bluesy, extended "Pas
ties and a G-String" and had us
all stomping and cheering, and
he did "Tom Traubert's
Blues" with a face that left us
stone cold sober. He brought a
vibe player and drummer —
Chick Whiting — who gave
things an eerie continuity, and
Frank McKenn's saxophone
was properly only barely under
control.
With Whiting and McKenna
Ray Young's bass, Tom Waits'
back-up was just as a back-up

organic drama. He had his au
dience by the neck., and he
gave us all a good wringing. He

sang a bluesy, extended "Pas
ties and a G-String" and had us
all stomping and cheering, and
he did "Tom Traubert's
Blues" with a face that left us
stone cold sober. He brought a
vibe player and drummer —
Chick Whiting — who gave
things an eerie continuity, and
Frank McKenn's saxophone
was properly only barely under
control.
With Whiting and McKenna
Ray Young's bass, Tom Waits'
back-up was just as a back-up
should be — it was coordi
nated and squarely behind
every move that the headliner
made.

We got bargains, bargains, bar

We got value, value, value. . .
You don' know the meaning of
the word
Tom Waits, between shows,
is crumpled in a backstage
chair. He is picking at his teeth,
and has his other hand at his
temple; he looks tired, and
sweaty. When Waits speaks he
rocks himself back and forth
with calm deliberation; he has
a cigarette, and sunken eyes.
He has half a smile, half a
grimace and a sad, enduring
expression. He looks resigned
to some strange fate.
Waits is polite to his "non-
Walter WincheN" interviewers,

but every now and then he
cannot sublimate his frustra
tion. He gives the expected
quotes again ("I'm from North
Hollywood, and my neighbors
are sons of bitches. . .Touring
with the Mothers was cruel and
unusual punishment . . .I'd
rather be home watching The
Rifleman'. . ."). He is even
gruffly friendly ("Come on,
boy, spit it out, your career's
on the line"), but every now
and then he loses his patience
with the questions. Then he
speaks loudly, abruptly. For
the most part, though, he
stares at the ground, and is al
most completely inaudible.
I don't have a good time. I do

not have fun, and I do not have
a good time. I am not enjoying
touring, and when I go home I
will not go out to parties. This
is not fun.
Waits speaks with deliberate
melancholy, but he never
seems slow or lazy. As a matter
of fact, meeting Waits leaves
very little doubt that he sees
most things with crystal clarity.
The dominant sensation, when
meeting Waits, is that of a man
very thoughtful — when he
speaks the mixture of eloqu
ence and pith is more than a lit
tle unsettling.
Tom Waits' music is grimy
and foul at the same time it is
subtle and crafted — his songs

are stuff from the bowels of the
city that refuse to stay in their
place. They are grimy works of
art, like the flip side of a Nor
man Rockwell painting. He
writes about bad livert and the
ones that got away, and he
plays what he writes with the
kind of devotion and intelli
gence that such material de
serves. Tom Waits' music con
tinually takes seemingly dead
phrases and gives them breath
and life — it has a thousand
false bottoms and does not rest
easy on any one level of mean
ing. It fools you, and hurts you,
then soothes with bitter senti
ment.
. . .it's a battered old suitcase
to a hotel someplace
and a wound that will never
heal
no prima donna the perfume is
on
an old shirt that is stained
with blood and whiskey
and goodnight to the street
sweepers
the night watchman flame
keepers
and goodnight Matilda too
Tom Waits played last Sun
day at Dinkelspiel auditorium,

and he had none of the prob
lems he occasionally has in
concert.
In the past there had been a
friction of sorts between per
sona and musician. Waits had
had trouble projecting his
emotional and technical com
plexities, and it often looked
(from a distance) as if he was
nothing more than a happy
go-lucky wino. His songs went
fast, then, and they seemed im
itations of the albums — when
he moved it came across as dis
tracting, out of context.
In those days Waits seemed
sometimes to be parodying
himself, simplifying, playing
to the part of his audience that
saw him as a modern-day
Bacchus-from-the-bowery.
Waits was not sure what to
do with a big crowd then — he
played it conservatively and
deprived us of most of his
genius. The genuine article
was missing on stage.
But not now. Waits has hit
his stride now, and he showed
it here last Sunday. Last Sunday
he played a little slower, and
looser, and he never once
stifled a strut; little was mis

sing, or out of place, and none
of his truths got short shrift.
I ain't sentimental
this ain't a purchase it's a rental
and its purgatory, hey
what's your story, well
I don't even care
I've got my own double cross
to bear
Tom Waits last Sunday gave a
desperately good perfor
mance, in which attitudes to
ward the audience were a cent
ral part of the show. One mi
nute he was with us as a drink
ing buddy and chum-type, and
in the next he looked as if he
was ready to sit down and cry.
It was hostility, and then it was
pain, and then it was strange
detachment — all the way
through you never lost sight of
his brooding, volatile intelli
gence. It was a potent show,
among the best I've ever seen.
Yea, and there were a lot of
empty seats out there. A lot
of empty seats. Must be
Washington's Birthday. . .
