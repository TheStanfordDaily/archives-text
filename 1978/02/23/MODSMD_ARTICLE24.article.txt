Miles Davis: 'Tune Up'
If one were to make a list
of the 10 most important re
cords in jazz history, half
the list could easily consist
of Miles Davis albums.
Miles has been at the foref
ront of every major change
in jazz over the past 30
years. Bebop, cool jazz,
modal jazz, neo-bop, jazz
rock fusion and atonal jazz
are only some of the areas
he has delved into during
his prolific career.
Prestige has just rere
leased a fantastic collection
of early Miles. The sessions
included in the "Tune Up"
album are generally excel
lent. The highlight of the al
bum, however, is the final
side which presents alter
nate takes from the historic
Miles-Monk-Milt Jackson
session of 1954.
The 1954 date is perhaps
the most important jam re
cording session of the '50s.

The Prestige rerelease pre
sents fantastic alternate ver
sions of "Bag's Groove" and
"The Man I Love," both of
which are mini
masterpieces. Both Miles
and Monk play with a fervor
which is very exciting even
today. Monk's solo on
"Bag's Groove" ranks
among his best.
The rest of the "Tune Up'
album has its share of
memorable moments,
which is not surprising
when one looks at the musi
cians involved. Sonny Rol
lins, Horace Silver, John
Lewis, and Art Blakey grace
the various numbers. Some
of the more rewarding
pieces include "I'll Re
member April," "Blue n'
Boogie," and the title cut.
The "Tune Up" album in
cludes music which has be
come more important with
the passing years. It cap
sulizes the work of a half

dozen jazz superstars be
fore they were generally
recognized as such. The
music is always interesting,
and frequently exhilirating.
Moore's Improvariations
My article on Herb
Moore's excellent tape
"Improvariations" neg
lected to mention that the
tape is available only
through the mail. Orders
should be sent to Herb
Moore, Box 667, Palo Alto,
Ca. 94301. The tape and
postage total $6.
KJAZ in Trouble
San Francisco's jazz radio
station KJAZ (which is the
best jazz radio station I've
ever run across) may cease
to exist unless it can find
enough money to defend it
self at an upcoming FCC
hearing.
Several prominent Bay

Area jazzophiles (among
them Todd Barkan, Clint
Eastwood, John Handy, and
Phil Elwood) have begun the
San Francisco Bay Area Jazz
Foundation. The founda
tion hopes to further jazz in
the City, and its first priority
is to save KJAZ. Checks
should be made out to
S.F.B.A.J.F. and sent to
"JAZZ" United California
Bank, 217 Shattuck Ave.,
Berkeley, Ca. 94704. I un
derstand that sizeable con
tributions ($lOO or more)
will be rewarded in "some
spectacular way."
Those unable to con
tribute can still help by writ
ing a letter supporting
KJAZ's license renewal to
the FCC. The person to
write to is Mr. Richard
Shiben/Room 702, Federal
Communications Commis
sion, 1919 M Street, NW,
Washington DC 20554.
