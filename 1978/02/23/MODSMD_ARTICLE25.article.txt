## Garcia just plays good music 
### 
As one of many enthusiastic listeners at
the Keystone in Palo Alto put it, "There's
no way you can be objective about this.
Jerry Garcia is not an objective phenome
non."
This is true. While many rock stars whip
their audiences into a screaming, arm
waving frenzy by cranking their amplifiers
up to 10 and screaming, "Do you wanna
rock and roll?" at the top of their lungs,
and generally jumping up and down a lot
while they play, Garcia can achieve the
same effect withasmileanda quick run up
the neck of his guitar.
His fans love his every move, and for
good reason. First, he is one of the most
original and stylish guitarists in the busi
ness. Second, and equally important,
he refuses to be constrained by the con
ventions that plague most other perfor
mers, i.e. you have to open with a short,
fast, familiar toe tapper to get people's
attention; you have to move through the
rest of the show at rapid-fire pace, maybe
stopping occasionally to tell a joke or say
how it sure is nice to be in this town again;
you always play your best known songs,
carefully interspersing them with other
catchy numbers; and you have to stretch
one out near the end of the show to seven
or eight minutes to keep the lead guitar
player happy.
So many songs
Half the fun of going to a Grateful Dsad
of Jerry Garcia Band concert is seeing what
they're going to play. Between countless
originals and cover versions of other writ
ers' material, Garcia could probably play
three hours a night for two weeks and

never play the same song twice. He plays
what he wants when he wants to, taking
his time to tune between songs, and
stretching each piece into a long jam if he
feels like it. And what's more he gets away
with it, playing so well that the audience
cheers every guitar solo, always screaming
for and receiving more.
The Jerry Garcia Band's first set at the
Keystone Friday night found their leader in
a rock and roll mood, as he chose to open
with a long driving version of 'How Sweet
It Is," an early '60s tune reworked by James
Taylor a few years back. From the begin
ning, Garcia's voice showed no signs of
the hoarseness it had had during most of
the Dead's shows earlier this year, and he
was obviously having a good time just sing
ing the song.
He followed with a rock version of a
song he did reggae style on his "Reflec
tions" album, "Catfish John," and fol
lowed with yet another rocker, "That's
What Love Will Make You Do," before
slowing things down for an extended ver
sion of Dylan's "Knockin' On Heaven's
Door."
Electrifying peaks
Throughout the set, Garcia played in
typical fashion, utilizing long fluid riffs that
came to (electrifying peaks two or three
times per solo as he really got the most out
of every tune. Pianist Keith Godcheaux,
also a member of the Dead and the only
other soloist in the Garcia Band, was given
a lot of room to play throughout the even
ing, and the Keystone's fine acoustics
made his playing much more enjoyable
and easier to hear than it is at the Dead's

Winterland shows, where the mix is usu
ally so poor that he might as well not even
be playing half the time.
There's some satisfaction
The highlights of the second set were
another effort from "Reflections," "Mission
In the Rain," and Dylan's "Simple Twist of
Pate." During the former, Garcia was all
smiles as the band jammed long and hard,
and the audience was just as happy,
applauding wildly as he sang about the
Dead's home town:
There's some satisfaction
In the San Francisco Bay
No matter what comes down
The Mission always looks the same
With "Simple Twist of Fate" Garcia exer
cised one of his favorite tricks, taking a
somewhat uptempo Dylan song and slow
ing it way down, (the way he's done with
versions of "Positively 4th Street" and"It
Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To
Cry") in order to achieve full emotional
impact. Once again, it was the length of the
song that helped make it powerful, as Gar
cia sang and played with such feeling that
the song, which lasted nine or ten mi
nutes, always kept the audience's atten
tion.
But this is all very hard to understand
unless you've ever seen )erry Garcia in
concert. It would be so much easier to
describe his performance if he wore eye
makeup, set off smoke bombs, and had a
lazer light show, butall hedoes issingwith
feeling and play the guitar better than
most, and that's not an objective fact, but
just something that has to be seen to be
understood.

Guitarist Leo Kottke thrilled his audience with some exciting finger-picking at the Old Waldorf in San
Francisco this past weekend. Despite his instrumental excellence on six- and 12-string guitar, Kottke
has not been given the recognition he deserves.
