## His guitar talks 
### 
Leo Kottke is a fine musician
and performer. He sings, but
not much. He usually lets his
guitar do the talking.
From Kottke you can hear a
wealth of styles: blues, folk,
country, and even some pop
and classical. Of these, the st
rains of traditional music
dominate his own composi
tions as well as the rest of his
songs. What is so amazing
then, is that he can turn such
seemingly simple music into a
captivating concert.
At the Old Waldorf in San
Francisco last weekend, Kottke
pleased his audience as few
guitarists can when they rely
on their instrument. He is part
of a continuing line of
guitarists who have brought
the acoustic guitar out of its
back-up role, into the role of a
lead instrument.
Kottke along with others
(notably John Fahey) is helping
to do for finger-picking styles
of guitar, what Doc Watson has
done for flat-picking and what
Andre Segovia did for classical
guitar.
Kottke's show at the Old
Waldorf included )ohn Fahey's
rollicking "Last Steam Engine
Train" which comes in part
from a Sam McCee tune. He
also played a favorite of Kottke
followers, "Louise," a bluesy
piece with some nice slide
guitar on the 12-string. Kottke

sang "Louise" in his somewhat
scratchy low-pitched voice,
but nevertheless seemed to
capture the audience entirely.
He also managed to get in his
upbeat original, "Bean Time"
and he finished his show (on
his second encore) with a ver
sion of ")esu, )oy of Man's
Desiring" which thoroughly
delighted the audience.
It wouldn 't be accurate to say
that Kottke is a virtuoso in the
same sense that Doc Watson is,
but does approach virtuos
ity and there is still time for him
to grow. )ohn Fahey is proba
bly better, but when he does
concerts, he doesn't bother
with such trivial matters as
acknowledging the existence
of the audience.
Kottke, on the other hand, is
very warm to his audience. He
has a good many tales to tell
and exhibits none of the aloof
ness that separates so many
performers from their audi
ence.
One thing that will impress
you about kottke is he acknow
ledges that he borrows heavily
from other musicians such as
Watson, Fahey and McGee. It
is something rare in our
copyrighted world when any
musician admits this.
What a lot of songwriters and
musicians seem to forget is that

music is a continuum, not bro
ken up into discreet melodies
or songs. In 12-tone Western
music almost every conceiva
ble pattern has been tried.
Originality then, lies in the
learranging of these patterns
and often has more to do with
the way a musician gets from
one note to the next, rather
than the succession of notes he
plays.
Also, the musicians of any
age are only the temporary
deedholders of the music.
Music rarely, if ever, begins or
ends with them, but they can, if
they are energetic and ingeni
ous enough, remold it, as
kottke has done. The notes
from his 6- and 12-string guitars
ring clearly with a measured
emphasis that makes his play
ing sensitive and expressive.
Kottke is a guitar player's
guitar player. His technique
fascinates amateurs and pro
fessional alike. But his music
is accessible to a much wider
audience. It seems, however,
that he has been somewhat ig
nored despite his great talents.
This is partly explained by
the fact that his music is not
made for a mass audience.
Kottke isn't looking for the
lowest common denominator,
that will find its way onto the
charts. I don't think he would
compromise his music for such
a dubious honor.

a dubious honor.
Leo Kottke is a fine musician
and performer. He sings, but
not much. He usually lets his
guitar do the talking.
From Kottke you can hear a
wealth of styles: blues, folk,
country, and even some pop
and classical. Of these, the st
rains of traditional music
dominate his own composi
tions as well as the rest of his
songs. What is so amazing
then, is that he can turn such
seemingly simple music into a
captivating concert.
At the Old Waldorf in San
Francisco last weekend, Kottke
pleased his audience as few
guitarists can when they rely
on their instrument. He is part
of a continuing line of
guitarists who have brought
the acoustic guitar out of its
back-up role, into the role of a
lead instrument.
Kottke along with others
(notably John Fahey) is helping
to do for finger-picking styles
of guitar, what Doc Watson has
done for flat-picking and what
Andre Segovia did for classical
guitar.
Kottke's show at the Old
Waldorf included )ohn Fahey's
rollicking "Last Steam Engine
Train" which comes in part
from a Sam McCee tune. He
also played a favorite of Kottke
followers, "Louise," a bluesy
piece with some nice slide
guitar on the 12-string. Kottke

sang "Louise" in his somewhat
scratchy low-pitched voice,
but nevertheless seemed to
capture the audience entirely.
He also managed to get in his
upbeat original, "Bean Time"
and he finished his show (on
his second encore) with a ver
sion of ")esu, )oy of Man's
Desiring" which thoroughly
delighted the audience.
It wouldn 't be accurate to say
that Kottke is a virtuoso in the
same sense that Doc Watson is,
but does approach virtuos
ity and there is still time for him
to grow. )ohn Fahey is proba
bly better, but when he does
concerts, he doesn't bother
with such trivial matters as
acknowledging the existence
of the audience.
Kottke, on the other hand, is
very warm to his audience. He
has a good many tales to tell
and exhibits none of the aloof
ness that separates so many
performers from their audi
ence.
One thing that will impress
you about kottke is he acknow
ledges that he borrows heavily
from other musicians such as
Watson, Fahey and McGee. It
is something rare in our
copyrighted world when any
musician admits this.
What a lot of songwriters and
musicians seem to forget is that

music is a continuum, not bro
ken up into discreet melodies
or songs. In 12-tone Western
music almost every conceiva
ble pattern has been tried.
Originality then, lies in the
learranging of these patterns
and often has more to do with
the way a musician gets from
one note to the next, rather
than the succession of notes he
plays.
Also, the musicians of any
age are only the temporary
deedholders of the music.
Music rarely, if ever, begins or
ends with them, but they can, if
they are energetic and ingeni
ous enough, remold it, as
kottke has done. The notes
from his 6- and 12-string guitars
ring clearly with a measured
emphasis that makes his play
ing sensitive and expressive.
Kottke is a guitar player's
guitar player. His technique
fascinates amateurs and pro
fessional alike. But his music
is accessible to a much wider
audience. It seems, however,
that he has been somewhat ig
nored despite his great talents.
This is partly explained by
the fact that his music is not
made for a mass audience.
Kottke isn't looking for the
lowest common denominator,
that will find its way onto the
charts. I don't think he would
compromise his music for such
a dubious honor.
