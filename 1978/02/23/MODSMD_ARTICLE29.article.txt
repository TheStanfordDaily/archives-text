## 'The Price' is brilliant 
### 
California Actors Theatre is
giving Arthur Miller's "The
Price" a brilliant Bay Area
fessional debut at the Old
Town Theatre in Los Gatos.
The intense one-set, four
character play explores the
high price people pay for the
choices they make in their
lives. There's very little deter
minism here. Even though the
characters repeat over and
over that they were helpless
under the circumstances, that
they did what they had to do,
Miller makes it clear they made
conscious choices that were
supposed to protect them from
the terrors they fear. So does
CAT.
In "The Price" two brothers,
Victor and Walter, meet for the
first time in 16 vears to dispose
of their family's possessions be
fore their childhood home is
torn down.
Vic is a police sergeant, 128-
year veteran who Mad to give
up college and dreams of be
coming a scientist to take care
of his father, a once rich
man broken financially and
emotionally by the crash of '29.

Kurtwood Smith plays Vic with
nervous intensity. His frequent
outbursts set the rhythm for
the entire play.
While it is clear that he is
progressing from confusion to
revelation to understanding to
rejection to acceptance in his
arguments with his brother,
the level of the progression
does not rise as slowly and
reach a peak as dramatically as
it might. Still, Smith s perfor
mance in a difficult role is
powerful and sympathetic.
Dakin Matthews plays Wal
ter, a successful doctor who
would not let the family's mis
fortune stop him from finish
ing his education. He is, at first,
the "rotten brother," the one
who walked away, leaving Vic
to struggle on and ruin his
chances for success and hap
piness by sacrificing his life to
his father.
Matthews is appropriately
suave and controlled in his
early scenes. When it becomes
clear that his success has been
bought at a terrible price, he
drops his Fifth Avenue manner
and allows his brother to see
that he, Walter, has suffered

too. Matthews adds just
enough sympathy and com
plexity to the role so that
neither Victor nor the audi
ence knows whether or not to
trust him.
Both Walter and Vic arrive at
middle age with the know
ledge that they have paid for
protection from their fears
with futile, sterile lives. Be
cause the actors playing these
parts interact so well it is easy
to believe that they are
brothers, with two lifetimes of
shared memories and hurts be
tween them.
Bonnie Gallup is good as
Vic's nervous wife who sees
reconciliation between the two
brothers as the way out of her
own stalemate.
Zachary Berger brings
just the right amount of humor
to the role of Solomon, the
furniture dealer, to lighten the
emotional burdens of the
evening without turning him
self into a ridiculous carica
ture.
"The Price" continues at the
Old Town Theatre in Los Catos
until Feb. 26.
