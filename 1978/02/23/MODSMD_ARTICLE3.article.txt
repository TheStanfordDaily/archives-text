A set of artifacts stolen from the
Museum of Art in May 1975 was reco
vered last Friday by Department of
Public Safety officers. An attorney
and a 24-year-old woman were de
tained for investigation of receiving
stolen property, according to Cap
tain Raoul Niemeyer of the Depart
ment of Public Safety.
Although both were released,
Niemeyer said a complaint will be
filed against the woman.
According to Niemeyer, the
woman had called the museum last
week in an attempt to sell a collection
of simulated diamonds. When the
woman and her attorney arrived at
the museum last Friday, public safety
officers were waiting.
After Museum of Art Director
Lorenz Eitner verified the collection
was the one stolen two years ago the
pair was arrested, said Niemeyer.

According to Eitner, the simulated
diamonds were replicas of several
famous diamonds made by Tiffany's
of Paris for jane Stanford in the 1880s.
Although of little monetary value,
the collection is of historical interest,
Eitner said.
Niemeyer said a search of the wo
man's property with her consent did
not uncover other stolen property.
However, he said the investigation is
still continuing. Officers are attempt
ing to locate a suspect for question
ing.
Last February, police recovered 40
rare coins also taken at the time of
the theft. But Niemeyer said several
old native American artifacts, includ
ing breastplates, bracelets, and silver
and tourquoise jewelry taken in the
burglary, have yet to be recovered.
"We're trying to locate that indi
vidual, we want to get to the bottom
of this. There's a good possibility we
may," said Niemeyer.
