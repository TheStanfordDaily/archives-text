Senate votes on Panama Canal
Washington — The Senate conducted its first
vote on the Panama Canal treaties yesterday, re
jecting a parliamentary move by treaty foes aimed
at torpedoing the twin pacts.
1 he Senate rejected by a 67 to 30 vote an effort
by treaty opponents to first take up the pact that
would turn over control of the canal to Panama
instead of taking up the neutrality treaty first, as
Senate leaders wanted.
Had this move passed, it would have meant that
the Senate would have had to decide whether to
turn over the canal to Panama before passing the
treaty which guarantees the canal's neutrality,
?jves U.S. ships priority access and guarantees
U.S. rights to defend the waterway.
Congress eliminates B-1 project
Washington — The House reversed itself and
gave final congressional approval yesterday to a
request by President Jimmy Carter to stop con
struction of the last two prototypes of the B-1
strategic bomber.
The House voted 2J4 to 182 to go along with the
Senate in scrapping the B-1 project.
Congress had already endorsed Carter's deci
sion to halt any further production of the plane but
the House earlier had insisted the final two planes,
the fifth and sixth copies, should be built.
At the White House, Press Secretary Jody Powell
said Carter was "delighted by the B-1 vote in the
House."
Brown to run for re-election
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown launched his
re-election campaign yesterday and challenged
the winner of the Republican primary to televised
debates.
Brown defended his record to date, saying he
was the first California governor in 20 years to
serve a term "without a tax increase of major
proportions across-the-board."
But the Democratic governor, while promising
iour more years of "compassion and fiscal frugal
ity," stopped short of promising a second four
vear term without new taxes.
Brown said he was "very confident" of victory
and said he would debate the Republican
nominee, and possibly other candidates for gov
ernor, after the primary.
He refused to rule out the possibility that he
might run again for president in 1980, saying "I'm
not locking any doors absolutely shut. . . . I'm not
going to decide it today."
Miller questioned on payment
Washington — The Senate Banking Committee
decided yesterday to put more questions to C.
William Miller, nominated as chairman of the Fed
eral Reserve Board, about a $2.9 million payment
made in Iran in which he played a role.
President |immy Carter nominated Miller in De
cember to succeed Arthur Burns as chairman of
the money-managing board, a position sometimes
described as the second most powerful in gov
ernment.
Several members of the committee said they
were concerned over possible conflicts in Miller's
previous testimony on the purpose of the payment
and whether he knew it was being made to a com
pany controlled by the head of the Iranian air
torce.
Atlanta cheating scheme probed
Atlanta — Mayor Maynard Jackson met behind

closed doors with city council members last night
to discuss investigators' findings that a cheating
scheme, sanctioned by the public safety commis
sioner, had favored blacks for promotions.
Jackson, who took office in 1974, is the city's first
black mayor. The report says that Public Safety
Commissioner A. Reginald Eaves, who also is
black, condoned the cheating.
The report made no recommendation about
Eaves but said that some black officers should be
fired.
The mayor called members of the City Council
to a meeting last night at a midtown hotel. The
Atlanta Journal said one councilman speculated
that the meeting was to find out whether the
council would support Jackson if he fired Eaves.
Hostage disarms gunman
Springfield, Ohio — A bank robbery suspect's
attempt to bargain his way out of capture from
inside a hemmed-in car ended last night when his
last hostage disarmed him during a negotiating
session, authorities said.
"The subject had placed the gun temporarily
down, and the hostage grabbed the gun, passed it
to the negotiator in the back seat, at which time he
was grabbed and secured," said Jim Love, FBI
night supervisor in Cincinnati.
"The hostage is safe. The subject has been ar
rested. The matter has been resolved."
Harrises charge misconduct
Los Angeles —Arguing they had not received a
tair trial, Symbionese Liberation Army members
William and Emily Harris asked a state appellate
court yesterday to overturn their convictions on
kidnapping, armed robbery and auto theft
charges.
In a 280-page brief, attorneys for the Harrises
claimed misconduct by the judge and jury dep
rived them of a fair trial.
In addition, the brief said, young persons and
blue-collar workers were underrepresented on
the jury . The couple also questioned the constitu
tionality of the seizure of evidence at their San
Francisco apartment on Sept. 19, 1975.
Patricia Hearst, who joined forces with the SLA
&fter being kidnapped from her Berkeley apart
ment, also was charged with kidnapping, robbery
and assault in the Inglewood incident. However,
she was allowed to enter a no-contest plea to
charges of armed robbery and assault with a
deadly weapon and placed on five years proba
tion. She was previously convicted of armed rob
bery of a San Francisco area bank.
Discrimination in public park
San Francisco — A city supervisor says he is ap
palled that two Nazi groupsare usinga public park
clubhouse tor meetings from which non-whites
and Jews are barred. But a city attorney says the
groups can legally keep out whomever they wish.
Both the National Socialist White People's Party
and the National Socialist White Workers Party
have paid the standard $15 fee to the city Recrea
tion and Park Department for using the clubhouse
"at least five or six times" a year for the past two
years, Bernice Rodgers, the department super
visor who issues permits, said Tuesday.
Rodgers said neither group had caused any dis
turbances, but she conceded "sometimes it boils
me" when the organizations use the public meet
ing places.
Six killed in plane wreck fire
Bakersfield — A small plane struck an empty

junior high school cafeteria and caught fire in
dense fog at dawn in Bakersfield yesterday, killing
all six oil field workers aboard.
There was no one in the school and no reports of
injuries to any nearby residents, police said.
The tire scorched the side of the brick cafeteria,
causing an estimated $1000 damage to the build
ing.
Classes were canceled until today while crews
cleared away a tangled mass of metal and wires
from the scattered plane wreckage, parts of which
were burned ash white.
The victims, welders on a pipeline, were flying
back to their jobs at Currant, Nevada after return
ing to their homes in this area Tuesday, authorities
said.
The Federal Aviation Administration was called
in to investigate the cause of the crash.
Gas tank leaks results in fire
Rialto — A spark from a passing automobile ap
parently ignited a vapor cloud from an overflowing
gas tank which set off a huge tank farm blaze that
seriously burned one man and left another over
come by tumes, the fire chief said yesterday.
He said an investigation was continuing to de
termine precisely who was responsible for the ac
cident, which caused at least $450,000 damage.
More than 200 firefighters from 15 Southern
California agencies battled the blaze at the South
ern Pacific storage plant off Interstate 10 all day
Tuesday, finally extinguishing it about 5:10 p.m. At
least 100 men remained on the scene overnight to
plug leaks, and yesterday morning all leaks were
declared sealed.
The 2.1-million-gallon gas tank had been leased
by Texaco. Texaco spokesman John Aucott said no
overall damage estimate had been made.
Movement to fire Kuhn initiated
New York — A backroom movement by a hand
ful of baseball owners intent on firing Commis
sioner Bowie Kuhn has gained support from
roughly one-third of the teams, The Associated
Press has learned.
An AP survey has revealed that at least nine of
the 26 teams would vote to fire Kuhn if a secret
ballot were held today. Those teams are Baltimore,
New York, Oakland, California, Texas and
Chicago in the American League and Cincinnati,
San Diego and Atlanta in the National League.
The most general criticism of Kuhn is that he has
abused his powers, entering into areas the owners
consider their private domains.
There is no provision in the Major League Rules
lor firing the commissioner, only for renewing his
contract. A renewal requires at least three
quarters of the owners' votes in each league.
Kuhn's office said the commissioner was out of
town yesterday. A list of questions was submitted
to Kuhn's office and relayed to Kuhn, who refused
to comment on the matter.

Los Angeles —Arguing they had not received a
tair trial, Symbionese Liberation Army members
William and Emily Harris asked a state appellate
court yesterday to overturn their convictions on
kidnapping, armed robbery and auto theft
charges.
In a 280-page brief, attorneys for the Harrises
claimed misconduct by the judge and jury dep
rived them of a fair trial.
In addition, the brief said, young persons and
blue-collar workers were underrepresented on
the jury . The couple also questioned the constitu
tionality of the seizure of evidence at their San
Francisco apartment on Sept. 19, 1975.
Patricia Hearst, who joined forces with the SLA
&fter being kidnapped from her Berkeley apart
ment, also was charged with kidnapping, robbery
and assault in the Inglewood incident. However,
she was allowed to enter a no-contest plea to
charges of armed robbery and assault with a
deadly weapon and placed on five years proba
tion. She was previously convicted of armed rob
bery of a San Francisco area bank.
Discrimination in public park
San Francisco — A city supervisor says he is ap
palled that two Nazi groupsare usinga public park
clubhouse tor meetings from which non-whites
and Jews are barred. But a city attorney says the
groups can legally keep out whomever they wish.
Both the National Socialist White People's Party
and the National Socialist White Workers Party
have paid the standard $15 fee to the city Recrea
tion and Park Department for using the clubhouse
"at least five or six times" a year for the past two
years, Bernice Rodgers, the department super
visor who issues permits, said Tuesday.
Rodgers said neither group had caused any dis
turbances, but she conceded "sometimes it boils
me" when the organizations use the public meet
ing places.
Six killed in plane wreck fire
Bakersfield — A small plane struck an empty

junior high school cafeteria and caught fire in
dense fog at dawn in Bakersfield yesterday, killing
all six oil field workers aboard.
There was no one in the school and no reports of
injuries to any nearby residents, police said.
The tire scorched the side of the brick cafeteria,
causing an estimated $1000 damage to the build
ing.
Classes were canceled until today while crews
cleared away a tangled mass of metal and wires
from the scattered plane wreckage, parts of which
were burned ash white.
The victims, welders on a pipeline, were flying
back to their jobs at Currant, Nevada after return
ing to their homes in this area Tuesday, authorities
said.
The Federal Aviation Administration was called
in to investigate the cause of the crash.
Gas tank leaks results in fire
Rialto — A spark from a passing automobile ap
parently ignited a vapor cloud from an overflowing
gas tank which set off a huge tank farm blaze that
seriously burned one man and left another over
come by tumes, the fire chief said yesterday.
He said an investigation was continuing to de
termine precisely who was responsible for the ac
cident, which caused at least $450,000 damage.
More than 200 firefighters from 15 Southern
California agencies battled the blaze at the South
ern Pacific storage plant off Interstate 10 all day
Tuesday, finally extinguishing it about 5:10 p.m. At
least 100 men remained on the scene overnight to
plug leaks, and yesterday morning all leaks were
declared sealed.
The 2.1-million-gallon gas tank had been leased
by Texaco. Texaco spokesman John Aucott said no
overall damage estimate had been made.
Movement to fire Kuhn initiated
New York — A backroom movement by a hand
ful of baseball owners intent on firing Commis
sioner Bowie Kuhn has gained support from
roughly one-third of the teams, The Associated
Press has learned.
An AP survey has revealed that at least nine of
the 26 teams would vote to fire Kuhn if a secret
ballot were held today. Those teams are Baltimore,
New York, Oakland, California, Texas and
Chicago in the American League and Cincinnati,
San Diego and Atlanta in the National League.
The most general criticism of Kuhn is that he has
abused his powers, entering into areas the owners
consider their private domains.
There is no provision in the Major League Rules
lor firing the commissioner, only for renewing his
contract. A renewal requires at least three
quarters of the owners' votes in each league.
Kuhn's office said the commissioner was out of
town yesterday. A list of questions was submitted
to Kuhn's office and relayed to Kuhn, who refused
to comment on the matter.

showing yesterday, getting little mileage out of an
early attempt at a technical rally.
The Dow (ones average of 30 industrials, barely
on the plus side most of the day, faded near the

Senate votes on Panama Canal
Washington — The Senate conducted its first
vote on the Panama Canal treaties yesterday, re
jecting a parliamentary move by treaty foes aimed
at torpedoing the twin pacts.
1 he Senate rejected by a 67 to 30 vote an effort
by treaty opponents to first take up the pact that
would turn over control of the canal to Panama
instead of taking up the neutrality treaty first, as
Senate leaders wanted.
Had this move passed, it would have meant that
the Senate would have had to decide whether to
turn over the canal to Panama before passing the
treaty which guarantees the canal's neutrality,
?jves U.S. ships priority access and guarantees
U.S. rights to defend the waterway.
Congress eliminates B-1 project
Washington — The House reversed itself and
gave final congressional approval yesterday to a
request by President Jimmy Carter to stop con
struction of the last two prototypes of the B-1
strategic bomber.
The House voted 2J4 to 182 to go along with the
Senate in scrapping the B-1 project.
Congress had already endorsed Carter's deci
sion to halt any further production of the plane but
the House earlier had insisted the final two planes,
the fifth and sixth copies, should be built.
At the White House, Press Secretary Jody Powell
said Carter was "delighted by the B-1 vote in the
House."
Brown to run for re-election
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown launched his
re-election campaign yesterday and challenged
the winner of the Republican primary to televised
debates.
Brown defended his record to date, saying he
was the first California governor in 20 years to
serve a term "without a tax increase of major
proportions across-the-board."
But the Democratic governor, while promising
iour more years of "compassion and fiscal frugal
ity," stopped short of promising a second four
vear term without new taxes.
Brown said he was "very confident" of victory
and said he would debate the Republican
nominee, and possibly other candidates for gov
ernor, after the primary.
He refused to rule out the possibility that he
might run again for president in 1980, saying "I'm
not locking any doors absolutely shut. . . . I'm not
going to decide it today."
Miller questioned on payment
Washington — The Senate Banking Committee
decided yesterday to put more questions to C.
William Miller, nominated as chairman of the Fed
eral Reserve Board, about a $2.9 million payment
made in Iran in which he played a role.
President |immy Carter nominated Miller in De
cember to succeed Arthur Burns as chairman of
the money-managing board, a position sometimes
described as the second most powerful in gov
ernment.
Several members of the committee said they
were concerned over possible conflicts in Miller's
previous testimony on the purpose of the payment
and whether he knew it was being made to a com
pany controlled by the head of the Iranian air
torce.
Atlanta cheating scheme probed
Atlanta — Mayor Maynard Jackson met behind

closed doors with city council members last night
to discuss investigators' findings that a cheating
scheme, sanctioned by the public safety commis
sioner, had favored blacks for promotions.
Jackson, who took office in 1974, is the city's first
black mayor. The report says that Public Safety
Commissioner A. Reginald Eaves, who also is
black, condoned the cheating.
The report made no recommendation about
Eaves but said that some black officers should be
fired.
The mayor called members of the City Council
to a meeting last night at a midtown hotel. The
Atlanta Journal said one councilman speculated
that the meeting was to find out whether the
council would support Jackson if he fired Eaves.
Hostage disarms gunman
Springfield, Ohio — A bank robbery suspect's
attempt to bargain his way out of capture from
inside a hemmed-in car ended last night when his

down, and the hostage grabbed the gun, passed it
to the negotiator in the back seat, at which time he
was grabbed and secured," said Jim Love, FBI
night supervisor in Cincinnati.
"The hostage is safe. The subject has been ar
rested. The matter has been resolved."

at torpedoing the twin pacts.
1 he Senate rejected by a 67 to 30 vote an effort
by treaty opponents to first take up the pact that
would turn over control of the canal to Panama
instead of taking up the neutrality treaty first, as
Senate leaders wanted.

turn over the canal to Panama before passing the
treaty which guarantees the canal's neutrality,
?jves U.S. ships priority access and guarantees
U.S. rights to defend the waterway.
Congress eliminates B-1 project

At the White House, Press Secretary Jody Powell
said Carter was "delighted by the B-1 vote in the

was the first California governor in 20 years to
serve a term "without a tax increase of major
proportions across-the-board."
But the Democratic governor, while promising
iour more years of "compassion and fiscal frugal
ity," stopped short of promising a second four
vear term without new taxes.
Brown said he was "very confident" of victory
and said he would debate the Republican
nominee, and possibly other candidates for gov
ernor, after the primary.
He refused to rule out the possibility that he

not locking any doors absolutely shut. . . . I'm not
going to decide it today."

Jackson, who took office in 1974, is the city's first
black mayor. The report says that Public Safety
Commissioner A. Reginald Eaves, who also is
black, condoned the cheating.
The report made no recommendation about
Eaves but said that some black officers should be

that the meeting was to find out whether the
council would support Jackson if he fired Eaves.

Harrises charge misconduct
Los Angeles —Arguing they had not received a
tair trial, Symbionese Liberation Army members
William and Emily Harris asked a state appellate
court yesterday to overturn their convictions on
kidnapping, armed robbery and auto theft
charges.
In a 280-page brief, attorneys for the Harrises
claimed misconduct by the judge and jury dep
rived them of a fair trial.
In addition, the brief said, young persons and
blue-collar workers were underrepresented on
the jury . The couple also questioned the constitu
tionality of the seizure of evidence at their San
Francisco apartment on Sept. 19, 1975.
Patricia Hearst, who joined forces with the SLA
&fter being kidnapped from her Berkeley apart
ment, also was charged with kidnapping, robbery
and assault in the Inglewood incident. However,

Discrimination in public park
San Francisco — A city supervisor says he is ap
palled that two Nazi groupsare usinga public park
clubhouse tor meetings from which non-whites
and Jews are barred. But a city attorney says the
groups can legally keep out whomever they wish.
Both the National Socialist White People's Party
and the National Socialist White Workers Party
have paid the standard $15 fee to the city Recrea
tion and Park Department for using the clubhouse
"at least five or six times" a year for the past two
years, Bernice Rodgers, the department super
visor who issues permits, said Tuesday.
Rodgers said neither group had caused any dis
turbances, but she conceded "sometimes it boils
me" when the organizations use the public meet
ing places.
Six killed in plane wreck fire
Bakersfield — A small plane struck an empty

junior high school cafeteria and caught fire in
dense fog at dawn in Bakersfield yesterday, killing

causing an estimated $1000 damage to the build
ing.
Classes were canceled until today while crews
cleared away a tangled mass of metal and wires
from the scattered plane wreckage, parts of which
were burned ash white.
The victims, welders on a pipeline, were flying
back to their jobs at Currant, Nevada after return
ing to their homes in this area Tuesday, authorities
said.
The Federal Aviation Administration was called
in to investigate the cause of the crash.
Gas tank leaks results in fire
Rialto — A spark from a passing automobile ap
parently ignited a vapor cloud from an overflowing
gas tank which set off a huge tank farm blaze that
seriously burned one man and left another over
come by tumes, the fire chief said yesterday.
He said an investigation was continuing to de
termine precisely who was responsible for the ac
cident, which caused at least $450,000 damage.
More than 200 firefighters from 15 Southern
California agencies battled the blaze at the South
ern Pacific storage plant off Interstate 10 all day
Tuesday, finally extinguishing it about 5:10 p.m. At
least 100 men remained on the scene overnight to
plug leaks, and yesterday morning all leaks were
declared sealed.

by Texaco. Texaco spokesman John Aucott said no
overall damage estimate had been made.
Movement to fire Kuhn initiated
New York — A backroom movement by a hand
ful of baseball owners intent on firing Commis

roughly one-third of the teams, The Associated

the 26 teams would vote to fire Kuhn if a secret
ballot were held today. Those teams are Baltimore,
New York, Oakland, California, Texas and
Chicago in the American League and Cincinnati,
San Diego and Atlanta in the National League.
The most general criticism of Kuhn is that he has
abused his powers, entering into areas the owners

Jackson, who took office in 1974, is the city's first
black mayor. The report says that Public Safety
Commissioner A. Reginald Eaves, who also is
black, condoned the cheating.
The report made no recommendation about
Eaves but said that some black officers should be
fired.
The mayor called members of the City Council
to a meeting last night at a midtown hotel. The
Atlanta Journal said one councilman speculated
that the meeting was to find out whether the
council would support Jackson if he fired Eaves.
Hostage disarms gunman
Springfield, Ohio — A bank robbery suspect's
attempt to bargain his way out of capture from
inside a hemmed-in car ended last night when his
last hostage disarmed him during a negotiating
session, authorities said.
"The subject had placed the gun temporarily
down, and the hostage grabbed the gun, passed it
to the negotiator in the back seat, at which time he
was grabbed and secured," said Jim Love, FBI
night supervisor in Cincinnati.
"The hostage is safe. The subject has been ar
rested. The matter has been resolved."
Harrises charge misconduct
Los Angeles —Arguing they had not received a
tair trial, Symbionese Liberation Army members
William and Emily Harris asked a state appellate
court yesterday to overturn their convictions on
kidnapping, armed robbery and auto theft
charges.
In a 280-page brief, attorneys for the Harrises
claimed misconduct by the judge and jury dep
rived them of a fair trial.
In addition, the brief said, young persons and
blue-collar workers were underrepresented on
the jury . The couple also questioned the constitu
tionality of the seizure of evidence at their San
Francisco apartment on Sept. 19, 1975.
Patricia Hearst, who joined forces with the SLA
&fter being kidnapped from her Berkeley apart
ment, also was charged with kidnapping, robbery
and assault in the Inglewood incident. However,
she was allowed to enter a no-contest plea to
charges of armed robbery and assault with a
deadly weapon and placed on five years proba
tion. She was previously convicted of armed rob
bery of a San Francisco area bank.
Discrimination in public park
San Francisco — A city supervisor says he is ap
palled that two Nazi groupsare usinga public park
clubhouse tor meetings from which non-whites
and Jews are barred. But a city attorney says the
groups can legally keep out whomever they wish.
Both the National Socialist White People's Party
and the National Socialist White Workers Party
have paid the standard $15 fee to the city Recrea
tion and Park Department for using the clubhouse
"at least five or six times" a year for the past two
years, Bernice Rodgers, the department super
visor who issues permits, said Tuesday.
Rodgers said neither group had caused any dis
turbances, but she conceded "sometimes it boils
me" when the organizations use the public meet
ing places.
Six killed in plane wreck fire
Bakersfield — A small plane struck an empty

junior high school cafeteria and caught fire in
dense fog at dawn in Bakersfield yesterday, killing
all six oil field workers aboard.
There was no one in the school and no reports of
injuries to any nearby residents, police said.
The tire scorched the side of the brick cafeteria,
causing an estimated $1000 damage to the build
ing.
Classes were canceled until today while crews
cleared away a tangled mass of metal and wires
from the scattered plane wreckage, parts of which
were burned ash white.
The victims, welders on a pipeline, were flying
back to their jobs at Currant, Nevada after return
ing to their homes in this area Tuesday, authorities
said.
The Federal Aviation Administration was called
in to investigate the cause of the crash.
Gas tank leaks results in fire
Rialto — A spark from a passing automobile ap
parently ignited a vapor cloud from an overflowing
gas tank which set off a huge tank farm blaze that
seriously burned one man and left another over
come by tumes, the fire chief said yesterday.
He said an investigation was continuing to de
termine precisely who was responsible for the ac
cident, which caused at least $450,000 damage.
More than 200 firefighters from 15 Southern
California agencies battled the blaze at the South
ern Pacific storage plant off Interstate 10 all day
Tuesday, finally extinguishing it about 5:10 p.m. At
least 100 men remained on the scene overnight to
plug leaks, and yesterday morning all leaks were
declared sealed.
The 2.1-million-gallon gas tank had been leased
by Texaco. Texaco spokesman John Aucott said no
overall damage estimate had been made.
Movement to fire Kuhn initiated
New York — A backroom movement by a hand
ful of baseball owners intent on firing Commis
sioner Bowie Kuhn has gained support from
roughly one-third of the teams, The Associated
Press has learned.
An AP survey has revealed that at least nine of
the 26 teams would vote to fire Kuhn if a secret
ballot were held today. Those teams are Baltimore,
New York, Oakland, California, Texas and
Chicago in the American League and Cincinnati,
San Diego and Atlanta in the National League.
The most general criticism of Kuhn is that he has
abused his powers, entering into areas the owners
consider their private domains.
There is no provision in the Major League Rules
lor firing the commissioner, only for renewing his
contract. A renewal requires at least three
quarters of the owners' votes in each league.
Kuhn's office said the commissioner was out of
town yesterday. A list of questions was submitted
to Kuhn's office and relayed to Kuhn, who refused
to comment on the matter.

Senate votes on Panama Canal
Washington — The Senate conducted its first
vote on the Panama Canal treaties yesterday, re
jecting a parliamentary move by treaty foes aimed
at torpedoing the twin pacts.
1 he Senate rejected by a 67 to 30 vote an effort
by treaty opponents to first take up the pact that
would turn over control of the canal to Panama
instead of taking up the neutrality treaty first, as
Senate leaders wanted.
Had this move passed, it would have meant that
the Senate would have had to decide whether to
turn over the canal to Panama before passing the
treaty which guarantees the canal's neutrality,
?jves U.S. ships priority access and guarantees
U.S. rights to defend the waterway.
Congress eliminates B-1 project
Washington — The House reversed itself and
gave final congressional approval yesterday to a
request by President Jimmy Carter to stop con
struction of the last two prototypes of the B-1
strategic bomber.
The House voted 2J4 to 182 to go along with the
Senate in scrapping the B-1 project.
Congress had already endorsed Carter's deci
sion to halt any further production of the plane but
the House earlier had insisted the final two planes,
the fifth and sixth copies, should be built.
At the White House, Press Secretary Jody Powell
said Carter was "delighted by the B-1 vote in the
House."
Brown to run for re-election
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown launched his
re-election campaign yesterday and challenged
the winner of the Republican primary to televised
debates.
Brown defended his record to date, saying he
was the first California governor in 20 years to
serve a term "without a tax increase of major
proportions across-the-board."
But the Democratic governor, while promising
iour more years of "compassion and fiscal frugal
ity," stopped short of promising a second four
vear term without new taxes.
Brown said he was "very confident" of victory
and said he would debate the Republican
nominee, and possibly other candidates for gov
ernor, after the primary.
He refused to rule out the possibility that he
might run again for president in 1980, saying "I'm
not locking any doors absolutely shut. . . . I'm not
going to decide it today."
Miller questioned on payment
Washington — The Senate Banking Committee
decided yesterday to put more questions to C.
William Miller, nominated as chairman of the Fed
eral Reserve Board, about a $2.9 million payment
made in Iran in which he played a role.
President |immy Carter nominated Miller in De
cember to succeed Arthur Burns as chairman of
the money-managing board, a position sometimes
described as the second most powerful in gov
ernment.
Several members of the committee said they
were concerned over possible conflicts in Miller's
previous testimony on the purpose of the payment
and whether he knew it was being made to a com
pany controlled by the head of the Iranian air
torce.
Atlanta cheating scheme probed
Atlanta — Mayor Maynard Jackson met behind

closed doors with city council members last night
