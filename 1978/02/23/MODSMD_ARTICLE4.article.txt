McDonald's Corporation is cur
rently helping raise $300,000 for a re
novation project at the Children's
Hospital at Stanford, according to
Vicki Applegate, director of com
munications for the Children's Hos
pital.
The competed project, called the
"hoptel" will be "motel-like accom
modations" for the parents of chil
dren undergoing treatment at the
hospital, she added.
An old nurses' quarters, in the
northeast corner of the Children's
Hospital grounds, is now used to ac
commodate patients' parents. How
ever, Applegate said, the eight
rooms "are very run down" and the
facility in general is "not at all
adequate."
The renovation of the hoptel
should begin in three or four
months, Applegate said, and should
be completed by the end of this year.
However, she added, this estimate is
an "optimistic guess."
New accommodations
The new accommodation will have
13 rooms, each with a private bath.
There will also be manager's quarters
and a large, open living area, Apple
gate said.
Parents will be asked to give a vol
untary contribution of about $5 a
night, Applegate added.
There will be no limit to parents'
length of stay at the facility, accord
ing to Applegate. The only condition

is that their child is a patient at the
hospital.
Average length of stay for children
is about six days, she said. In some
cases, where the child must be neara
hospital but not actually admitted,
the parents and child will be allowed
to stay together in the accommoda
tions.
Patients from all over
"We'll get a lot of people from
Northern California and Northern
Nevada," Applegate said. "Most of
our patients are from the Bay Area
but they usually just go home for the
night."
McDonald's has opened similar
"Ronald McDonald House*" at Chil
dren's hospitals in Chicago and
Philadelphia, according to Apple
gate.
She said McDonald's hopes its
promotions will raise $300,000 for the
Children's Hospital at Stanford. One
upcoming promotion is expected to
earn $50,000 for the hospital.
Shamrock shakes
"McDonald's is selling Shamrock
Shakes March 3 through 17," Apple
gate said. "All the McDonald's in
Northern California and Northern
Nevada give 25 cents from each
Shamrock Shake sale to the hospi
tal."
The Children's Hospital at Stan
ford is a non-profit institution af
filiated with the Stanford Medical
Center and Stanford University Hos
pital for teaching purposes only.

"The University, of course, is well
aware of our project with
McDonald's, but the project is
strictly for the Children's Hospital at
Stanford, not for the University," she
said.
The Children's Hospital has
facilities for oncology, rheumatology
(juvenile rheumatoid arthritis), al
lergy and lung illnesses and or
thopedics. The Hospital also has li
mited psychiatric facilities.

be completed by the end of this year.
However, she added, this estimate is
an "optimistic guess."
New accommodations
The new accommodation will have
13 rooms, each with a private bath.
There will also be manager's quarters
and a large, open living area, Apple
gate said.
Parents will be asked to give a vol
untary contribution of about $5 a
night, Applegate added.
There will be no limit to parents'
length of stay at the facility, accord
ing to Applegate. The only condition

is that their child is a patient at the
hospital.
Average length of stay for children
is about six days, she said. In some
cases, where the child must be neara
hospital but not actually admitted,
the parents and child will be allowed
to stay together in the accommoda
tions.
Patients from all over
"We'll get a lot of people from
Northern California and Northern
Nevada," Applegate said. "Most of
our patients are from the Bay Area
but they usually just go home for the
night."
McDonald's has opened similar
"Ronald McDonald House*" at Chil
dren's hospitals in Chicago and
Philadelphia, according to Apple
gate.
She said McDonald's hopes its
promotions will raise $300,000 for the
Children's Hospital at Stanford. One
upcoming promotion is expected to
earn $50,000 for the hospital.
Shamrock shakes
"McDonald's is selling Shamrock
Shakes March 3 through 17," Apple
gate said. "All the McDonald's in
Northern California and Northern
Nevada give 25 cents from each
Shamrock Shake sale to the hospi
tal."
The Children's Hospital at Stan
ford is a non-profit institution af
filiated with the Stanford Medical
Center and Stanford University Hos
pital for teaching purposes only.

"The University, of course, is well
aware of our project with
McDonald's, but the project is
strictly for the Children's Hospital at
Stanford, not for the University," she
said.
The Children's Hospital has
facilities for oncology, rheumatology
(juvenile rheumatoid arthritis), al
lergy and lung illnesses and or
thopedics. The Hospital also has li
mited psychiatric facilities.
McDonald's Corporation is cur
rently helping raise $300,000 for a re
novation project at the Children's
Hospital at Stanford, according to
Vicki Applegate, director of com
munications for the Children's Hos
pital.
The competed project, called the
"hoptel" will be "motel-like accom
modations" for the parents of chil
dren undergoing treatment at the
hospital, she added.
An old nurses' quarters, in the
northeast corner of the Children's
Hospital grounds, is now used to ac
commodate patients' parents. How
ever, Applegate said, the eight
rooms "are very run down" and the
facility in general is "not at all
adequate."
The renovation of the hoptel
should begin in three or four
months, Applegate said, and should
be completed by the end of this year.
However, she added, this estimate is
an "optimistic guess."
