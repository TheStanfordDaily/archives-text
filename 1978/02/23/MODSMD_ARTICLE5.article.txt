### 
Cairo, Egypt (AP) — President
Anwar Sadat said yesterday it was he
who ordered Egyptian commandos
to Larnaca airport on the ill-fated re
scue mission that resulted in bloody
fighting with Cypriot forces.
In an emotional speech to his
troops, Sadat also withdrew recogni
tion of Cyprus President Spyros Kyp
rianou, calling him a "dwarf."
Sadat said the decision to use force
Sunday night to capture the two ter
rorists who killed Egyptian news
paper editor Youssef el Sebaei and
held 11 Arab diplomats and four
crew-members aboard a Cyprus Air
ways DC-8 was his own and not the
personal initiative of Brig. Nabil
Shukry, leader of the commandos.
"The commander's decision to at
tack the plane and rescue the hos
tages and arrest the criminals was
based on the facts of the mission he
was given," Sadat said in his speech
at the War Ministry after the funeral
of the 15 commandos who died in the

action. At least seven Cypriots were
wounded.
"It was not his decision, but it was
my decision. Any one of my sons
who is given a mission is given full
power and freedom to make deci
sions. We were following everything
as was the commando leader there
on the spot at the airport," he said,
though it was not known whether
Shukry consulted with Sadat before
issuing the attack order.
"He was following what went on
between the control tower and the
killers and it became apparent to him
and to us here in Egypt also . . . that
Cyprus was preparing two passports
for the killers so they could leave
Cyprus, as if they had not committed
a crime."
He said at that point, Shukry de
cided to storm the plane and carry
out his orders to return with the hos
tages and the terrorists.
Shukry told Cairo radio Tuesday he
had "no way of knowing" about the
progress of the negotiations and
acted after he waited "a reasonable
time" without hearing any word, a
statement that apparently conflicted
with Sadat's version.
Kyprianou said Tuesday that
Egypt's ambassador and military at
tache had been told the terrorists
had agreed to free the hostages. He
said Egypt even gave assurances
there would be no attack.
When the Egyptians launched the
attack, the Cypriot National Guard
"had no alternative but to intervene
and take action to save the hostages
and to protect the sovereign rights of
the Cypriot state," Kyprianou said.
Sadat's statement that he no
longer recognizes Kyprianou as pres

ident is tantamount to a complete
break in relations.
"There is no room for us to deal
with dwarfs such as these," Sadat
said in his speech. "Our recognition
of him as president of the republic,
and he hears me now, is withdrawn
as of today."

ways DC-8 was his own and not the
personal initiative of Brig. Nabil
Shukry, leader of the commandos.
"The commander's decision to at
tack the plane and rescue the hos
tages and arrest the criminals was
based on the facts of the mission he
was given," Sadat said in his speech
at the War Ministry after the funeral
of the 15 commandos who died in the

action. At least seven Cypriots were
wounded.
"It was not his decision, but it was
my decision. Any one of my sons
who is given a mission is given full
power and freedom to make deci
sions. We were following everything
as was the commando leader there
on the spot at the airport," he said,
though it was not known whether
Shukry consulted with Sadat before
issuing the attack order.
"He was following what went on
between the control tower and the
killers and it became apparent to him
and to us here in Egypt also . . . that
Cyprus was preparing two passports
for the killers so they could leave
Cyprus, as if they had not committed
a crime."
He said at that point, Shukry de
cided to storm the plane and carry
out his orders to return with the hos
tages and the terrorists.
Shukry told Cairo radio Tuesday he
had "no way of knowing" about the
progress of the negotiations and
acted after he waited "a reasonable
time" without hearing any word, a
statement that apparently conflicted
with Sadat's version.
Kyprianou said Tuesday that
Egypt's ambassador and military at
tache had been told the terrorists
had agreed to free the hostages. He
said Egypt even gave assurances
there would be no attack.
When the Egyptians launched the
attack, the Cypriot National Guard
"had no alternative but to intervene
and take action to save the hostages
and to protect the sovereign rights of
the Cypriot state," Kyprianou said.
Sadat's statement that he no
longer recognizes Kyprianou as pres

ident is tantamount to a complete
break in relations.
"There is no room for us to deal
with dwarfs such as these," Sadat
said in his speech. "Our recognition
of him as president of the republic,
and he hears me now, is withdrawn
as of today."
Cairo, Egypt (AP) — President
Anwar Sadat said yesterday it was he
who ordered Egyptian commandos
to Larnaca airport on the ill-fated re
scue mission that resulted in bloody
fighting with Cypriot forces.
In an emotional speech to his
troops, Sadat also withdrew recogni
tion of Cyprus President Spyros Kyp
rianou, calling him a "dwarf."
Sadat said the decision to use force
Sunday night to capture the two ter
rorists who killed Egyptian news
paper editor Youssef el Sebaei and
held 11 Arab diplomats and four
crew-members aboard a Cyprus Air
ways DC-8 was his own and not the
personal initiative of Brig. Nabil
Shukry, leader of the commandos.
