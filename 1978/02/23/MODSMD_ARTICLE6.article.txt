# Another coal strike offer turned down
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The soft coal
industry refused last night to accept
an offer by the United Mine Workers'
(UMW) bargaining council to settle
the 79-day coal strike based on a ten
tative agreement reached earlier
with an independent coal producer.
Labor Secretary Ray Marshall said
the Bituminous Coal Operators As
sociation (BCOA) "declined to re
spond" to the union's offer which he
presented to the industry bargainers.
Marshall also said the industry
"declined my invitation" to join in
face-to-face negotiations with the
union.
Government officials said there
would be a meeting at the White
House early today "to determine the
future course of action."
Sources familiar with the negotia
tions said, however, the government
was prepared to begin the process of
facilitating contract agreements bet
ween the union and individual
BCOA-member companies, a move
that could lead to the breakup of the
employers bargaining group.
Earlier the UMW bargaining coun
cil promised to accept any individual
or industrywide offer to settle the
strike based on a tentative agree
ment reached with the Pittsburg &
Midway Coal Mining Co. The council
had accepted that agreement by a
vote of 25-13.
Marshall was careful not to unde
remphasize the problems in the way
of a negotiated contract agreement.
But he added "We believe that reach
ing a negotiated settlement is so
much preferable to anything else we
must give it a reasonable time."
Marshall said if the new talks fail to
produce signs of an agreement soon,
President Jimmy Carter "will have to
make a decision" about imposing a
government solution to the walkout.
The labor secretary said he was
prepared for another round of non
stop talks if necessary.
Marshall's announcement came as
union President Arnold Miller re
jected as "ridiculous" a call by soft
coal operators for binding arbitra
tion, but agreed to reopen joint
negotiations aimed at ending the
strike.
Asked about the prospects for a
settlement, Marshall told a White
House briefing, "I hope for it. You
can't tell at this point."
But presidential press secretary
lody Powell, citing the strike's wor
sening economic impact, said the
government "cannot permit the
stalemate to continue indefinitely."
The threat of such action by a
BCOA member increases the pres
sure on the organization to end the
impasse.
The White House has warned of
government intervention — pos
sibilities mentioned are the seizure
of the mines or a back-to-work court
order — to end the strike later this
week. However, no precise deadline
for such action was set as officials
awaned the outcome of the new
round of negotiations.
Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger warned that "even now

conditions are deteriorating" in the
coal-dependent states of the Mid
west and Northeast where power
cutbacks are spreading and the
threat of mass job layoffs increasing.
He predicted "severe difficulties" by
April if the strike isn't settled soon.
The joint negotiating session at the
Labor Department was the first face
to-tace meeting for the two sides in
the dispute since talks collapsed
Saturday following union rejection
of what the industry said was its final
offer.
The BCOA's call for binding arbit
ration came after the association re
jected, as a model for a nationwide
settlement, the P&M tentative set
tlement with the union.
Government officials had hoped
the agreement would encourage the
industry association to improve its
"final" offer.

spond" to the union's offer which he
presented to the industry bargainers.
Marshall also said the industry
"declined my invitation" to join in
face-to-face negotiations with the
union.
Government officials said there
would be a meeting at the White
House early today "to determine the
future course of action."
Sources familiar with the negotia
tions said, however, the government
was prepared to begin the process of
facilitating contract agreements bet
ween the union and individual
BCOA-member companies, a move
that could lead to the breakup of the
employers bargaining group.
Earlier the UMW bargaining coun
cil promised to accept any individual
or industrywide offer to settle the
strike based on a tentative agree
ment reached with the Pittsburg &
Midway Coal Mining Co. The council
had accepted that agreement by a
vote of 25-13.
Marshall was careful not to unde
remphasize the problems in the way
of a negotiated contract agreement.
But he added "We believe that reach
ing a negotiated settlement is so
much preferable to anything else we
must give it a reasonable time."
Marshall said if the new talks fail to
produce signs of an agreement soon,
President Jimmy Carter "will have to
make a decision" about imposing a
government solution to the walkout.
The labor secretary said he was
prepared for another round of non
stop talks if necessary.
Marshall's announcement came as
union President Arnold Miller re
jected as "ridiculous" a call by soft
coal operators for binding arbitra
tion, but agreed to reopen joint
negotiations aimed at ending the
strike.
Asked about the prospects for a
settlement, Marshall told a White
House briefing, "I hope for it. You
can't tell at this point."
But presidential press secretary
lody Powell, citing the strike's wor
sening economic impact, said the
government "cannot permit the
stalemate to continue indefinitely."
The threat of such action by a
BCOA member increases the pres
sure on the organization to end the
impasse.
The White House has warned of
government intervention — pos
sibilities mentioned are the seizure
of the mines or a back-to-work court
order — to end the strike later this
week. However, no precise deadline
for such action was set as officials
awaned the outcome of the new
round of negotiations.
Energy Secretary James
Schlesinger warned that "even now

conditions are deteriorating" in the
coal-dependent states of the Mid
west and Northeast where power
cutbacks are spreading and the
threat of mass job layoffs increasing.
He predicted "severe difficulties" by
April if the strike isn't settled soon.
The joint negotiating session at the
Labor Department was the first face
to-tace meeting for the two sides in
the dispute since talks collapsed
Saturday following union rejection
of what the industry said was its final
offer.
The BCOA's call for binding arbit
ration came after the association re
jected, as a model for a nationwide
settlement, the P&M tentative set
tlement with the union.
Government officials had hoped
the agreement would encourage the
industry association to improve its
"final" offer.
Washington (AP) — The soft coal
industry refused last night to accept
an offer by the United Mine Workers'
(UMW) bargaining council to settle
the 79-day coal strike based on a ten

the Bituminous Coal Operators As
