Graduate school applications here
have increased by about 1000 this
year, but the competition is just as
tough as ever, according to Dean of
Graduate Studies Bliss Carnochan.
Major increases have been in the
schools of business, medicine and
law, he added.
"There's no question that people
are concerned about having a degree
that's marketable," said Lawrie
Lieberman, dean of admissions for
the Graduate School of Business. In
1972, 1875 students applied for 300
openings in the business program.
Last year 4251 applications were re
ceived.
Applications to the Law School
have gone up 20 per cent this year.
According to Law School Prof. Wil
liam Cohen, the recent trend toward

practical education is reflected in the
popularity of certain classes.
"Enrollment in clinical classes,
where you practice by doing, has
gone up," he said, "whereas enroll
ment in classes such as Chinese law
and comparative law is down."
The Medical School received
about the same number of applica
tions as last year, but the competition
is "stiff," because of the high
number of applicants, according to a
Med School spokesman.
There were 5600 applicants for 86
spaces last year.
Once students have completed
graduate training in the medical, law
and business schools, they have little
trouble finding jobs as long as they
aren't particular about job locations,
according to Cohen.
