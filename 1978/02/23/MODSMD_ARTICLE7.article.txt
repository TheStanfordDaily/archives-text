# Grad applications up

Graduate school applications here
have increased by about 1000 this
year, but the competition is just as
tough as ever, according to Dean of
Graduate Studies Bliss Carnochan.
Major increases have been in the
schools of business, medicine and
law, he added.
"There's no question that people
are concerned about having a degree
that's marketable," said Lawrie
Lieberman, dean of admissions for
the Graduate School of Business. In
1972, 1875 students applied for 300
openings in the business program.
Last year 4251 applications were re
ceived.
Applications to the Law School
have gone up 20 per cent this year.
According to Law School Prof. Wil
liam Cohen, the recent trend toward

practical education is reflected in the
popularity of certain classes.
"Enrollment in clinical classes,
where you practice by doing, has
gone up," he said, "whereas enroll
ment in classes such as Chinese law
and comparative law is down."
The Medical School received
about the same number of applica
tions as last year, but the competition
is "stiff," because of the high
number of applicants, according to a
Med School spokesman.
There were 5600 applicants for 86
spaces last year.
Once students have completed
graduate training in the medical, law
and business schools, they have little
trouble finding jobs as long as they
aren't particular about job locations,
according to Cohen.
"Students with an MBA find that
it's a valuable degree and it tends to
open opportunities,' Lieberman
said.
"Another way of looking at it
(graduate school admissions) is the
state of the market," Carnochan
said. He added the trend toward
practical degrees has existed for sev
eral years.
"And given the predictions," he
added, "I don't see much of a rever
sal."
Finding jobs for liberal arts
graduate students is more difficult,
Carnochan said. The University has
been "fairly successful" in helping
place these students, he added.
"No doubt that it's harder than it
was 10 years ago," he said. "And it
probably will continue this way for
quite some time."
In spite of the high number ot
graduate school applicants, graduate
schools here continue to actively re
cruit minorities, according to Car
nochan.
He added that this is because there
hasn't been an equal distribution of
race and sex in the graduate schools,
which is "ideally what a graduate
school" should have.
"It's been a problem for years. We
lose minority students to other law
schools" for example, Cohen said.
Students usually apply to several
law schools and since minorities
have a high acceptance rate, those
with multiple applications often
choose Harvard or Vale over Stan
ford, Carnochan added.
The University Medical School,
however, has no problem with
minority recruiting. Minority en
rollment has been increasing over
the past six years, spokesmen said.
Currently, 30 per cent of the enrolled
students are women.

and comparative law is down."
The Medical School received
about the same number of applica
tions as last year, but the competition
is "stiff," because of the high
number of applicants, according to a
Med School spokesman.
There were 5600 applicants for 86
spaces last year.
Once students have completed
graduate training in the medical, law
and business schools, they have little
trouble finding jobs as long as they
aren't particular about job locations,
according to Cohen.
"Students with an MBA find that
it's a valuable degree and it tends to
open opportunities,' Lieberman
said.
"Another way of looking at it
(graduate school admissions) is the
state of the market," Carnochan
said. He added the trend toward
practical degrees has existed for sev
eral years.
"And given the predictions," he
added, "I don't see much of a rever
sal."
Finding jobs for liberal arts
graduate students is more difficult,
Carnochan said. The University has
been "fairly successful" in helping
place these students, he added.
"No doubt that it's harder than it
was 10 years ago," he said. "And it
probably will continue this way for
quite some time."
In spite of the high number ot
graduate school applicants, graduate
schools here continue to actively re
cruit minorities, according to Car
nochan.
He added that this is because there
hasn't been an equal distribution of
race and sex in the graduate schools,
which is "ideally what a graduate
school" should have.
"It's been a problem for years. We
lose minority students to other law
schools" for example, Cohen said.
Students usually apply to several
law schools and since minorities
have a high acceptance rate, those
with multiple applications often
choose Harvard or Vale over Stan
ford, Carnochan added.
The University Medical School,
however, has no problem with
minority recruiting. Minority en
rollment has been increasing over
the past six years, spokesmen said.
Currently, 30 per cent of the enrolled
students are women.
Graduate school applications here
have increased by about 1000 this
year, but the competition is just as
tough as ever, according to Dean of
Graduate Studies Bliss Carnochan.
Major increases have been in the
schools of business, medicine and
law, he added.
"There's no question that people
are concerned about having a degree
that's marketable," said Lawrie
Lieberman, dean of admissions for
the Graduate School of Business. In
1972, 1875 students applied for 300
openings in the business program.
Last year 4251 applications were re
ceived.
Applications to the Law School
have gone up 20 per cent this year.
According to Law School Prof. Wil
liam Cohen, the recent trend toward

practical education is reflected in the
popularity of certain classes.
"Enrollment in clinical classes,
where you practice by doing, has
gone up," he said, "whereas enroll
ment in classes such as Chinese law
and comparative law is down."
