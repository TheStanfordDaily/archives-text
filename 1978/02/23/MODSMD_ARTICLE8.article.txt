# Motorists face parking shortage
## 
### John Hegarty News analysis 
Parking on campus can be a big problem. Due to
space shortages, the harried motorist is often faced
with few parking alternatives.
There are presently about 13,000 cars on campus,
with a total of 12,557 parking spaces, according to
James McNally, director of facilities at the Medical
Center. Of these spaces, 9265 are located on campus,
with the remainder distributed among the Medical
Center, Hoover Pavilion and offstreet parking, he
added.
The problem seems small, but the numbers don't
tell the whole story. There are areas around campus
where the parking demand is high and other places
where parking spaces frequently go unused, accord
ing to Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the president for
trustee affairs.
There was actually a surplus of 1385 spaces, exclud
ing student residence parking, from 1976 to 1977,
according to figures compiled by the Committee on
Parking and Transportation.
The problem is that these surpluses are in the
wrong places, Hamrdla added.
Certain campus areas are worse than others, com
mittee Chairman Hamrdla added.
"The worst places on campus are Terman and Ro

ble," he said.
In addition to the tight parking, the sycamore trees
across from Roble Gymnasium are threatened by the
compression of the ground due to the weight of the
cars, according to a University News Service press
release.
The University deals with the problem of parking
through the CPT. The committee reviews University
parking policy and bicycle safety.
The CPT is funded by the money collected from the
200 to 300 parking violation fines that are levied daily,
Hamrdla said.
The committee also deals with providing better
facilities for the handicapped. There are currently 25
spaces for the disabled. More such spaces, as well as
better wheelchair ramps around campus are under
consideration by the committee.
The committee is taking measures to deal with
parking problems. One such measure is the 210 car
parking lot to be built west of Lagunita Court. Also a
251 space lot near the Medical Center will soon be
completed.
The committee also plans to close Galvez Street
from Serra Street to Escondido, and to close Panama
Street between Duena and Lomita Streets in order to
turn the two areas into pedestrian-bicycle malls.


Construction is continuing on a 250-space addition to
the Medical School parking lot. The addition, adminis-
