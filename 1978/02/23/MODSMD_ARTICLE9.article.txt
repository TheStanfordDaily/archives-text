## Uncluttered space relieving Human spirit insulted by wall 
### 
Peter Thompson

(This is a copy of a letter already sub
mitted to Art Prof. Albert Elsen.)
I oppose building Alber's wall on
Lomita Mall for two reasons: 1) the
wall's design would insult and op
press the majority of people who
would be forced to experience it
several times a day for as long as they
work and study at Stanford, and 2)
the decision to build the wall on that
spot appears to be the result of an
elitist, paternalistic way of thinking
which ignores the need of all people,
including Stanford students, to dis
cover and direct their own means of
artistic expression.
I shall only elaborate on the first
point, and trust the second point is
clear to anyone who read the article
in Friday's Daily (Feb. 17).
According to that article, you ap
parently believe that the public must
learn something from this "tribute to
how the human spirit may be man
ifested in art."
I feel that your attitude displays a
profound ignorance of that aspect of
the human spirit which is displayed
in the wall's design. The spirit of
geometric regularity and constrain
ing surfaces is intrinsic to the pro
fessions of those people who work
and study west of the Quad, and to
suggest that they do not already
thoroughly understand the signifi

cance of the wall's design is an insult
to both their spiritual perception and
their ways of thought.
The secretaries, administrators,
and technicians who work near the
Mall spend each working hour at
tempting to transmute irregular
chaos into repetitive order, and the
wall would just be a cruel parody of
their noble, sometimes exhausting
achievements. These people manifest
that part of the human spirit daily,
with every cleanly typed page, every
filled-out form, and every highly
polished surface. Their work trans
cends the stage of art to become the
experience itself.
Burlesque shadow
The engineers, scientists, and
mathematicians who work and study
in that part of campus are continually
experiencing the spiritual state
ment of Alber's design, because their
disciplines require a constant pro
cess of creative thinking in the
realms of abstract, hyperrational
geometric forms. Have you, an "art
expert," ever studied from textbooks
in these areas?
Every equation, every algorithmic
scheme, even the simplest theories
of chemistry and physics are an ac
tive manifestation of the human
spirit that can only reach the level of
caricature in Alber's rather barren

design. The wall would be nothing
more than a burlesque shadow of
what we as individuals already ex
perience to be real and significant in
our lives.
Because of the nature of the work
done near the Lomita Mall, and be
cause the buildings behind the
Physics Tank (most of which bear an
unsightly resemblance to Alber's de
sign) are so closely packed, the open
space of the Mall is an oasis of relief
to the minds and sensitivities of the
people who work there. When I walk
out of that cube called an office, I
desperately try to leave behind the
right angles, straight lines, and dead
flat surfaces which are constant
companions to the experience of
being an engineer.
Only part of my person is an en
gineer, and to express the other part
requires a periodic disassociation
from the lockstep forms of manufac
tured objects. From my office I must
walk past many walls, with many
straight lines, and many angles, past
pipes of all description, in order to
finally reach the clear Lomita Mall
and free my mind to the wholeness
of uncluttered space.
Serenity disrupted
Every working day at Stanford I
enjoy the openness and clarity of the
view across that green grass oval. At
the edge of evening the scene takes
on a peaceful quality which conveys
not the compulsive spirit of
mathematics and science, but rather
the quiet spirit of serenity and accep
tance which is necessary after a long
day'swork. I consider this to be more
important than a daily reminder of
how some artist implements his per
sonal ideas, and from the number of
petition signatures and letters op
posing the wall it seems that I am not
alone in this view.
I, and other people who work near
Lomita Mall, know that the openness
there currently functions as a valu
able part of our daily experience at
Stanford. To use this for just another
artistic experiment, under the pre
text of instructing us in that aspect of
the human spirit which we person
ally manifest in our work, can only
be called an insult.
Prof. Elsen, if you still do not un
derstand the potential horror of plac
ing Alber's wall at Lomita, then (to
paraphrase your own words) I
suggest that you expose yourself to
those areas of science, mathematics,
engineering, and secretarial school
which you do not as yet know or like
â€” even professors of art history are
entitled to learn about different ways
of seeing the world, different forms
of knowledge, and how that know
ledge is acquired. The fewer walls
there are between both sides of
campus, the better this campus will
be.
