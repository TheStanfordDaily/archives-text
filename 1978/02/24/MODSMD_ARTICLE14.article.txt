# Arabic class placed in precarious position
## 
### Katherine Ellison 
Given: Over 100 million people in the
world speak some variety of Arabic, and
the language is spoken in more than 22
countries.
Given: For decades, a serious
international conflict has involved most
of the major Arabic-speaking countries.
Given: The originals of some of the
world's most renowned literary trea
sures, such as the Koran and "One
Thousand and One Nights" are written
in Arabic.
Problem: Why doesn't the University
have one formal Arabic class, or any
course at all on the Middle East?
The University does have an Arabic
class, but it seems to be in a very pre
carious position. It doesn't have steady
funding. It doesn't have a department.
Since September of this year, Prof.
Arieh Loya, a Baghdad-born scholar,
has been teaching both Arabic and
Hebrew here. An average of 17 students
signed up each quarter for his begin
ning Arabic class.
Although Loya's salary for teaching
Hebrew is subsidized by Hillel, his sal

ary as an instructor of Arabic is tem
porary and non-billeted. While he is
loosely aligned with the Dept. of Lin
guistics, his salary comes from a variety
of sources, the largest of which is an
Office of Education grant under the Na
tional Defense Education Act (NDEA).
Joseph Creenberg, anthropology
professor and director of the NDEA
program here, says this funding —
specifically intended for African studies
— has been diverted to Arabic as an
"emergency" measure for 1977-78 only.
This was made possible, he says, be
cause the African studies program had
some extra money this year and he used
it to help pay Loya's salary.
Creenberg says "there has been a
real student demand" for Middle East
ern studies, and adds, "I don't see how
a university like Stanford — in spite of
itself — doesn't have some top scholars
in that area."
Ron Herring, associate director of the
Center for Research in International
Studies (CRIS), says the reason the Uni
versity doesn't have a Middle Eastern
Studies program is because of "a deci

sion in the late '50s ... to build on
existing strength rather than cover all
world areas."
At that time, says Herring, the Uni
versity's administrators decided to de
velop major programs in East Asian and
Latin American Studies with "modest
expansion" in Eastern European and Af
rican Studies.
Herring says these choices were due
to the existing concentration of library
resources and faculty specialization.
"We're getting value like mad from
Loya," says Clara Bush, chairman of the
Department of Linguistics. But Bush
says the uncertainty of Loya's position
at Stanford "isn't fair to him."
In addition to Hebrew, French and
English, Loya speaks seven dialects of
Arabic. He has published a variety of
articles on Middle Eastern politics and
thought, many of which are in Arabic.
Loya, who commutes to Palo Alto
from Carmel two or three days a week,
says he is determined to develop a
Middle Eastern Studies Department,
and seeking out other students in
terested in Arabic at Stanford.

One of the most fervent lobbyists for
Arabic is Hillel's Rabbi Mark Cartun,
whose support, says Clara Bush, has
been "remarkable."
Cartun would like to see a Middle
Eastern Studies department here be
cause, he says, he has seen a "de
monstrated student demand."
Adds Cartun, "For a university which
has such a reputation built on engineer
ing and business, particularly because
of companies likeßechtel — which doa
lot of business with the Arabs — I think
it's kind of crazy that it doesn't have any
Arabic classes."
Sarah Al-Fadl, a junior from Saudi
Arabia and former ASSU senator, is
looking into the possibility of acquiring
outside funding for a chair in Arabic
studies. Al-Fadl says she thinks the
Saudi government would be willing to
support Arabic classes, but she admits
"there's a built-in stall." The Saudi gov
ernment would probably insist on a
contract for the chair which would have
wording excluding any instruction of
Israeli-related topics, says Al-Fadl.
