# Bug Me
## 
### Doug Yoshida 
The following is a letter from
Alan Cummings, manager of
the Logistics Operations
Croup, in reference to a Bug
Me question (Daily, February
10) about white vans:
Those "mysterious" white
vans labeled "Traffic Depart
ment" that are seen
"everywhere on Campus" tie-

long to the Traffic Department.
They are used for the delivery
of equipment, supplies, and
interdepartmental mail to
Campus departments and the
Medical Center.
As I said, I was wondering —
now we know. Thanks!
California residents can get a
$37 tax refund if they lived in
rented property on March 7,
7977. This does not apply if the
rented property was tax exempt
from property taxes.
Question: Are the Univeristy
buildings (specifically dorms)
exempt from property tax? If
not, do I qualify for the renter's
credit?
- DS
Zera Coleman at Land Re
sources said she answers this
question many times a week.
The answer: The dorms are
exempt from property tax. So if
you lived in a dorm, you do not
qualify for the renter s credit.
Coleman said there are four
fraternities on campus which
own their own houses and are
thus eligible for the refund.
The fraternities are: Sigma Chi,
Phi Sig, Theta Chi, and Theta
Xi.
In addition, post-docs and
junior faculty in Escondido are
eligible. And that's it — I hope
you haven't spent your $37 al
ready!

Who lives in close seclusion
over at Kingscote Gardens?
How much does it cost? If I we
ren't a poor student could I
lodge there?
-MH
This turned out to be a very
interesting question. I had al
ways thought Kingscote Car
dens was controlled by the
University and rented to
emeriti faculty. This is not the
case however. kinscote Gar
dens is privately owned, ac
cording to manager Joyce
Crawford. There are 36 units
plus one for the manager.
Crawford said it is open to
anyone with Stanford connec
tions, but added that some
people have been on the wait
ing list for three years. There
are some students living there,
and one entering student even
"called long distance to get on
the waiting list," she said.
Bob Duncan, at Hare, Bre
wer, and Kelly in Palo Alto, the
firm that controls the property,
said that in Kinscote Gardens,
approximately "90 per cent of
the residents have Stanford
connections." When asked
about rental rate and owner
ship, Duncan said he was not at
liberty to reveal such informa
tion.
So if you're interested in living
there (it is a nice place — and
on-campus), just go thereandget
on the waiting list — but be pre
pared to wait for a while.
