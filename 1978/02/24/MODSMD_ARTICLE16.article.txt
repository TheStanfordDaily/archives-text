# Alpha Phi Omega continues services

Stanford's Zeta chapter of the co-ed na
tional service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega
(APO) is not a typical frat. It stresses the
goals of leadership, friendship, and ser
vice, but is not a socially oriented group,
according to President Charlie Parker, a
junior.
Recently APO has been involved in a
drive to increase participation. There are
no requirements for membership, and
non-members can participate in any of
their volunteer projects.
Most project ideas come from the
group's members, although requests by
others to have APO work on certain pro
jects are considered. Parker said that the
main criterion for projects is whether or
not they will be good for the group and fun
as well.
Bike paths
Last Saturday about nine people worked
on an APO project which involved clean
ing up bike paths on campus. This
weekend APO will be distributing Spring
Quarter catalogs for SWOPSI, Under
graduate Special Workshops, and SCIRE.
In addition to one-time projects such as
these that "usually turn out to be the most

fun," according to Parker, APO has several
continuous projects. These projects in
clude organizing the ride board at Tresid
der, which brings people who need rides
and people who can give rides together,
and recruiting volunteers for the Red
Cross blood drives at the dorms.
Book exchange
During Winter Quarter, APO sponsored
a book exchange; students give APO the
books they wish to sell, and APO sells
them on consignment.
In the past this exchange has been
periodically run by the group. This year,
there was an extremely poor response to
the exchange, and it grossed only $78.
This failure is attributable to both lack of
publicity and rainy weather, and these fac
tors caused few students to bring in
books. Parker said he feels that there are
many Stanford students who want to sell
their books and do not want to get ripped
off by the bookstore. For these students
the exchange would seem ideal.
Publicity is an important factor in en
couraging such students to use the ex
change, Parker said.
With increased student activity it would
be less monotonous for APO participants

to work at the exchange; therefore more
people would be willing to work, accord
ing to one book exchange worker.
Participating
He also noted that participation might
be increased if individual-type projects,
such as the book exchange, were de
emphasized, and focus was given to pro
jects which foster "a real group feeling"
and which get people together.
Another APO participant said that the
organization needs to expand its activities
to attract a wider variety of people.
Lack of interest in APO, according to
one of its members, is due to the fact that
students seem pre-occupied with them
selves, and are not as concerned with hu
manity in general.
Payoff
Freshman Chris Yates noted that "most
people here want to see some kind of per
sonal payoff, like grades or money, from
anything they do. Purely volunteer work
seems to hold little value for the average
Stanford student."
Anyone who does feel volunteer service
is worthwhile is welcome to participate in
any of the APO projects.

Four members of the Alpha Phi Omega service organization cleaned up bike paths last Saturday. Other
projects include giving aid to Red Cross and organizing rides for community members here.
Stanford's Zeta chapter of the co-ed na
tional service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega
(APO) is not a typical frat. It stresses the
goals of leadership, friendship, and ser
vice, but is not a socially oriented group,
according to President Charlie Parker, a
junior.
Recently APO has been involved in a
drive to increase participation. There are
no requirements for membership, and
non-members can participate in any of
their volunteer projects.
Most project ideas come from the
group's members, although requests by
others to have APO work on certain pro
jects are considered. Parker said that the
main criterion for projects is whether or
not they will be good for the group and fun
as well.
Bike paths
Last Saturday about nine people worked
on an APO project which involved clean
ing up bike paths on campus. This
weekend APO will be distributing Spring
Quarter catalogs for SWOPSI, Under
graduate Special Workshops, and SCIRE.
In addition to one-time projects such as
these that "usually turn out to be the most

fun," according to Parker, APO has several
continuous projects. These projects in
clude organizing the ride board at Tresid
der, which brings people who need rides
and people who can give rides together,
and recruiting volunteers for the Red
Cross blood drives at the dorms.
Book exchange
During Winter Quarter, APO sponsored
a book exchange; students give APO the
books they wish to sell, and APO sells
them on consignment.
In the past this exchange has been
periodically run by the group. This year,
there was an extremely poor response to
the exchange, and it grossed only $78.
This failure is attributable to both lack of
publicity and rainy weather, and these fac
tors caused few students to bring in
books. Parker said he feels that there are
many Stanford students who want to sell
their books and do not want to get ripped
off by the bookstore. For these students
the exchange would seem ideal.
Publicity is an important factor in en
couraging such students to use the ex
change, Parker said.
With increased student activity it would
be less monotonous for APO participants

to work at the exchange; therefore more
people would be willing to work, accord
ing to one book exchange worker.
Participating
He also noted that participation might
be increased if individual-type projects,
such as the book exchange, were de
emphasized, and focus was given to pro
jects which foster "a real group feeling"
and which get people together.
Another APO participant said that the
organization needs to expand its activities
to attract a wider variety of people.
Lack of interest in APO, according to
one of its members, is due to the fact that
students seem pre-occupied with them
selves, and are not as concerned with hu
manity in general.
