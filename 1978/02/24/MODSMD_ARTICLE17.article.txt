## A 						touch of lavish decadence... Moroccan relaxation at its best in exotic Eastern setting 
### 
Agadir
746 Broadway
San Francisco
Witnessed through the mys
terious haze of a thick San
Francisco fog, the neons and
harsh noises of the North
Beach area seemed like some
thing out of a bad dream. The
dream quickly took on a more
pleasant aspect as we crept up
a side street and escaped the
fog in Agadir, a Moroccan re
staurant we were quick to rec
ognize as perhaps the finest of
its type in the city.
We pushed open the intri
cately carved wooden doors
and were admitted to a room
lavishly furnished with thick
oriental rugs and heavy
draperies. As we took our sets
on the low camelskin stools
and cushions provided, we ap
preciated the authenticity of
the Moroccan setting, not at all
like the overdone and plushly
American "Moroccan" re
staurants we had visited be
fore.
With not a trace of tinsel or
plastic to be seen, Agadir is
elegant and fascinates with just
a touch of mysterious deca
dence.

Our extremely casual and
helpful waiter introduced
himself and poured warm
water over our hands from a
marvelous brass urn. It is the
custom in Morocco and at
Agadir to eat with your hands.
We found this procedure
awkward at first, but after dis
pelling our western inhibi
tions, found that experiencing
the texture and temperature of
the foods we were eating
greatly enhanced our meal.
Before I go any further, a
quick word on dining in the
Moroccan manner: the Near
Eastern dining experience
should consume the better
part of an evening, not be
tacked on as an appetizer be
fore a play or movie.
To be thouroughly enjoyed a
Moroccan meal should last
about three hours, allowing
plenty of time for each course
to settle. At Agadir, there are
six courses, each of which
would do for a light supper, so
take this time estimate seri
ously.
The menu at Agadir is a de
vice to titillate the feaster and
inform him of the joys to
come; the only part of the meal

one chooses is the main
course. The other dishes are
served automatically.
This is a good thing; they are
all excellent, complement each
other nicely and since most
American diners do not have a
great store of knowledge of
Moroccan dishes, this automa
tic choice saves some from
embarrassment.
We did what choosing was
allowed and ordered Grey Mul
let, and Duck with Prune
Sauce. The entire meal at
Agadir, no matter which main
dish one chooses, costs $12.50,
very reasonable for the excel
lent six courses presented.
We began with a lovely veg
etable soup, fairly mildly sea
soned and served with the only
utensils we used all evening,
handcarved wooden spoons.
Our waiter informed us that
we were free to drink it from
the bowls in the true Moroccan
manner, but I chose to try the
spoon, simply because it was
so attractive. It should be
noted that not once during the
meal did any of the food rest
upon or touch anything metal.
I appreciated this; frequently
metal gives food a nasty taste.

After the soup came a salad,
actually four different salad
mixtures closest in texture to
guacamole. We were pleased
with the mildly seasoned
choices of chopped sweet
peppers, cucumber, eggplant,
and carrots, all dressed with a
vegetable oil.
Moroccan food is customar
ily prepared with little or no
salt; the skillfully combined
flavours of each individual in
gredient enhance each other.
With our salad we consumed
several delicious pieces of
Mid-Eastern bread seasoned
with carraway seed.
The third course was, I feel
the best, and certainly the most
unusual of the whole dinner. It
consists of a combination of
chicken livers and hearts
ground up very finely with a
specially prepared egg mix
ture.
This is wrapped in a most de
licate filo dough and the top of
this pie shaped creation is lat
ticed with a fine line of cinna
mon and topped with a sprinkl
ing of powdered sugar. We
later gasped at the dexterity of
the chef when we visited the
kitchen and discovered that

the lattice-work is all done free
hand.
Somehow the combination
of powdered sugar and the
subtle taste of chicken, egg,
and filo dough combine to
produce one of the most
mouthwatering flavours and
textures I have ever tasted.
Following this cloud-like
concoction, we rested for a few
minutes enjoying the after
tastes of the second episode of
the dream.
Then my rosy main dish ar
rived, an entire mullet steeped
in a beautiful red tomato and
eggplant sause and sur
rounded by lemons. My com
panion's duck was escorted by
many juicy prunes of which, I
admit, I ate abundantly.
It was good to taste a semi
sweet that did not shout
"oranges" at you and smother
such a tender bird.
My fish was perfectly
cooked. Too eager, however, I
scorched my fingers; it was my
fault entirely for I had forgot
ten the importance of a slow
and calm approach.
Don't be frightened of the
appearance of this noble fish,
he is quite easy to fillet with the

fingers and the sweet white
flesh is well worth a little effort.
After the main course we re
laxed with glasses of real mint
tea sweetened with sugar and
had almost forgotten about
more food when two slices of
Moroccan baclava appeared,
oozing honey and walnuts
from between paper thin slices
of filo dough. These were
quickly eaten but I admit we
lingered over the slices of
orange with cinnamon and
sugar that followed hard upon.
After more mint tea, we suc
cumbed to the reviewer's
curiosity and looked at the
kitchen and talked to the chef.
After finding that most of

Agadir's unique flavours are
secrets, we sighed conten
tedly, realizing that the only
way to recreate this fine meal
would be to return and bask in
Agadir's hospitality again.
Not at all an unpleasant
thought, we felt, and donned
our coats, turned up our col
lars and stepped out into the
fog again. As the doors closed
behind us we no longer felt
alienated by the atmosphere
that we had fled from before.
Though the flashing rep
resentation of Carol Doda will
always surprise me, I will never
see it again without remember
ing the Moroccan dream just
up the street.
