# Chinese chef satisfies clientele

Chef Chu's
1067 San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-2696
The peninsula is overflowing
with Chinese restaurants, but
few compare in quality or repu
tation to Chef Chu's.
The fine food and the at
titude of the restaurant as a
whole have earned Lawrence
Chu a distinction among his
clientele: the Stanford com
munity.
Hailed unanimously as one
of the best Chinese chefs in the
Bay Area, Chu has built his
reputation on a basic public re
lations policy: never expand so
much that the customer's de
sires are sacrificed. Chu and
the customer run the restaur
ant together.
Although the atmosphere is
not reminiscent of the sub

dued, more formal Kan's in the
City, it is undoubtedly warm
and comfortable. The waiting
area is small —almosttoo small
for the throng that crowds in
side. If you go on a Friday or
Saturday night around 7:30,
count on waiting 30 minutes to
an hour for a table. A bar which
serves every drink from
Chinese rice wine to a
"double-martini-hold-the-olive
is available to help pass the
time. It's not such a bad idea to
be really hungry once you're
seated. The portions are large.
Booths and tables fill average
sized dining areas, and a newly
built third dining area upstairs
is evidence that Chu's popular
ity has increased steadily in the
seven and a half years he's
been in the business.
We stated with a bottle of
Mondavi Reisling and Hot and

Sour soup ($2.25 for two). The
combination of bamboo
shoots, shredded pork &
shrimp had us refilling our
bowls three times; it was at this
point we knew it was going to
be a long meal.
For an appetizer we had the
Honey Barbecued Spareribs
($2.95). There was so much
food that we later realized an
appetizer was an unnecessary
extravagance. The next deli
cacy to arrive was Moo Shoo
Pork ($3.75).
If you can't figure out how to
eat this combination of tender
loin pork, bamboo shoots, and
scrambled eggs, be sure to ask
the waiter. It would be a shame
to forsake the taste for ignor
ance.
Finally, we were ready for
the main dishes.
The first to arrive was a heap

ing plateful of Szechuan Beef
($4.50), one of the dishes listed
as a House Specialty.
The House Specialties are
original creations of Lawrence
Chu himself. After trying, fry
ing, and slicing, Chu hit on
thirteen special dishes that are
both attractive and delicious.
The beef was extremely tender
and spiced with Chu's secret
ginger sauce. Eaten with
steamed rice, the hot taste was
muted slightly, but still made us
ask for second glass of water.
The final dish was also a House
Specialty, crab meat over veg
etables ($4.75). The taste was
much cooler than that of the
beef and provided a nice con
trast. We added that to our last
bit of rice, and called a truce.
The rest was eaten as a late
night snack. Another House
Specialty of which Chu is
proud is his mild chicken dish,

Phoenix Bird in Nest, a true ar
tistic production ($5.25). Bite
sized pieces of chicken in a de
licious sauce rest in a nest
made from fried shoe string
potatoes. The creation is top
ped with hard-boiled eggs.
Lawrence Chu has suc
ceeded in building a fine
Chinese restaurant, and the
reputation he enjoys reflects
his primary concern — that the
customer be satisfied.
"What they're interested in,
I serve them," Chu said. He
treats each patron as if "every
customer were a reporter.
It is important to Chu to
maintain a good rapport with
his clientele. And they, in turn,
come back time and time again
to enjoy the personally super
vised cuisine and the concern
that the chef has incorporated
into his establishment.

ginger sauce. Eaten with
steamed rice, the hot taste was
muted slightly, but still made us
ask for second glass of water.
The final dish was also a House
Specialty, crab meat over veg
etables ($4.75). The taste was
much cooler than that of the
beef and provided a nice con
trast. We added that to our last
bit of rice, and called a truce.
The rest was eaten as a late
night snack. Another House
Specialty of which Chu is
proud is his mild chicken dish,

Phoenix Bird in Nest, a true ar
tistic production ($5.25). Bite
sized pieces of chicken in a de
licious sauce rest in a nest
made from fried shoe string
potatoes. The creation is top
ped with hard-boiled eggs.
Lawrence Chu has suc
ceeded in building a fine
Chinese restaurant, and the
reputation he enjoys reflects
his primary concern — that the
customer be satisfied.
"What they're interested in,
I serve them," Chu said. He
treats each patron as if "every
customer were a reporter.
It is important to Chu to
maintain a good rapport with
his clientele. And they, in turn,
come back time and time again
to enjoy the personally super
vised cuisine and the concern
that the chef has incorporated

The peninsula is overflowing
with Chinese restaurants, but
few compare in quality or repu
tation to Chef Chu's.
The fine food and the at
titude of the restaurant as a
whole have earned Lawrence
Chu a distinction among his
clientele: the Stanford com
munity.
Hailed unanimously as one
of the best Chinese chefs in the
Bay Area, Chu has built his
reputation on a basic public re
lations policy: never expand so
much that the customer's de
sires are sacrificed. Chu and
the customer run the restaur
ant together.
Although the atmosphere is
not reminiscent of the sub

dued, more formal Kan's in the
City, it is undoubtedly warm
and comfortable. The waiting
area is small —almosttoo small
for the throng that crowds in
side. If you go on a Friday or
Saturday night around 7:30,
count on waiting 30 minutes to
an hour for a table. A bar which
serves every drink from
Chinese rice wine to a
"double-martini-hold-the-olive
is available to help pass the
time. It's not such a bad idea to
be really hungry once you're
seated. The portions are large.
Booths and tables fill average
sized dining areas, and a newly
built third dining area upstairs
is evidence that Chu's popular
ity has increased steadily in the
seven and a half years he's
been in the business.
We stated with a bottle of
Mondavi Reisling and Hot and

Sour soup ($2.25 for two). The
combination of bamboo
shoots, shredded pork &
shrimp had us refilling our
bowls three times; it was at this
point we knew it was going to
be a long meal.
For an appetizer we had the
Honey Barbecued Spareribs
($2.95). There was so much
food that we later realized an
appetizer was an unnecessary
extravagance. The next deli
cacy to arrive was Moo Shoo
Pork ($3.75).
If you can't figure out how to
eat this combination of tender
loin pork, bamboo shoots, and
scrambled eggs, be sure to ask
the waiter. It would be a shame
to forsake the taste for ignor
ance.
Finally, we were ready for
the main dishes.
The first to arrive was a heap

ing plateful of Szechuan Beef
($4.50), one of the dishes listed
as a House Specialty.
The House Specialties are
original creations of Lawrence
Chu himself. After trying, fry
ing, and slicing, Chu hit on
thirteen special dishes that are
both attractive and delicious.
The beef was extremely tender
and spiced with Chu's secret
ginger sauce. Eaten with
