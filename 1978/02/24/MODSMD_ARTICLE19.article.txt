Being from Los Angeles,
where good Mexican food is
the rule, I often find myself
forced to exercise a little pati
ence and undertanding when
trying Mexican food over 500
miles from the border. Well, I
had hoped that "La Fortuna"
would destroy my prejudice,
but unfortunately, such was
not the case.
The atmosphere of "La For
tuna" is amenable, although
nothing fancy. The service,
however, was both slow and
impersonal, and it seemed as if
we waited 45 minutes before
our plates were finally cleared.
The restaurant was very busy,
however, and it seemed as if
perhaps they were understaf
fed.
The Authentic Red Mexican
Style Enchiladas, made with a
red sauce of spices and herbes,
sauteed and filled with fresh
Mexican cheese ($2.95),
seemed like it was missing a
major ingredient.
The tortillas in which the En
ciladas were made had a dis
tinctly bitter taste. Like a few
other dishes, the Enchiladas

are also available with steak,
for $4.95.
The "La Fortuna Special," in
cluding a Chile Relleno, a
choice of either a Beef or
Cheese Enchilada, and a Beef
Taco, was fair. Both the Taco
and the Chile Relleno were
somewhat bland, in definite
contrast to their explosive hot
sause, which is served with
chips.
Although our meal was any
thing but exceptional, it seems
only fair to add that many
people do not share my opin
ion. Reservations are always
advised; on the weekends,
without reservations, one can
end up waiting over an hour.
For a Tuesday, "La Fortuna"
was unusually busy and I can't
help but wonder if our experi
ence was unique. The prices
are very modest; the most ex
pensive dish, which includes
steak, is $4.75.
"La Fortuna" may well be
worth another try — as busy as
they are, it seems to me that
the regular customers know
something that I don't. How
ever, until somebody lets mein
on the big secret, my only ad
vice to you is "buena suerte."
