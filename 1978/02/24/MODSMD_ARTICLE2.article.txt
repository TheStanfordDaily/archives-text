# ASSU Senate debates ending boycott

### Will Nixon 
ASSU Senator Rick Levy opened
discussion last night on the senate's
boycott of the CIR by asking the se
nate if they should stand by their
boycott or approve the appointment
of the three students nominated for
the CIR last fall.
"Wefelt," said Levy, "in takingour
initial stand that by not nominating
students we could have the greatest
affect, but we were clearly run over
by a power play."
"I was originally against nominat
ing students," said Senator Steven
Mentor, but he now calls the move
"a tactical error," and strongly re
commended nominating students.
Mentor also responded to Presi
dent Richard Lyman's defense of his
actions which appeared in the Daily
and elsewhere as "totally bizarre,"
especially with regard to constitu
tional questions asked of Lyman dur
ing his appearance before the senate
last week.
Senator Tom McCormack, who
originally supported placing stu
dents now on the board, said "I think
we should let the issue pass until the
normal process of Senate nomina
tion comes up in the spring." He
added that "Lyman won the first
round but we would further be say
ing that he won the war if we now
appoint students to the CIR."
Pointing out that the original ques

tion and argument for not appointing
students was that students would
have no real input on the CIR,
Senator Merial Bertie wondered
what appointing students would now
mean. Senator Steve Buckley called
nominating students now "totally il
logical."
Disagreeing with those senators
who called the earlier decision not to
nominate a tactical error, ASSU Co
president Anne Henkels termed it a
success.
"The issue was debated on the
floor of the Faculty Senate where the
same feeling was expressed as ours,"
she said. "The Board of Trustees dis
cussed the issue which they never
would have, President Lyman and
Trustee Bing appeared before the
Senate which is totally unpre
cedented, and administrators met
with senators and other student
leaders.
'Milked clean'
"We have milked this tactic clean
and it is time to move on and apply
pressure both from inside and out,"
added Henkels.
ASSU Co-president Steve Westly
expressed concern over the senate
"setting a dangerous precedent in
overriding a committee recommen
dation." The Nominations Commit
tee had recommended that no stu
dents be nominated.
In a straw vote at the end of the

discussion, opinions were roughly
equally divided between having the
senate continue its present stance,
having the senate approve the three
nominees of last fall, and having the
senate charge the nominations
committee with making a search of
the community for new nomina
tions.
In other business, the senate ap
proved an expenditure of up to $70
for informing the community of the
"very real possibility of unplanned
pregnancy." In making the proposal,
McCormack pointed out that an av
erage of 85 to 100 unwanted pre
gnancies occur on the Stanford cam

pus ever year.
Another act adopted was termed
the "Stanford Due Process" amend
ment to the by-laws by its author
Senator Doug Bandow. The changes
made in response to last fall's con
troversial senate election would
make disqualification possible only
for violations of explicit rules in the
by-laws.
Two other changes would make it
necessary for each person to be
given reasonable notice of charges
against them and that they have a
chance to respond to these charges.
The last change would prohibit rules
from being applied retroactively.

actions which appeared in the Daily
and elsewhere as "totally bizarre,"
especially with regard to constitu
tional questions asked of Lyman dur
ing his appearance before the senate
last week.
Senator Tom McCormack, who
originally supported placing stu
dents now on the board, said "I think
we should let the issue pass until the
normal process of Senate nomina
tion comes up in the spring." He
added that "Lyman won the first
round but we would further be say
ing that he won the war if we now
appoint students to the CIR."
Pointing out that the original ques

tion and argument for not appointing
students was that students would
have no real input on the CIR,
Senator Merial Bertie wondered
what appointing students would now
mean. Senator Steve Buckley called
nominating students now "totally il
logical."
Disagreeing with those senators
who called the earlier decision not to
nominate a tactical error, ASSU Co
president Anne Henkels termed it a
success.
"The issue was debated on the
floor of the Faculty Senate where the
same feeling was expressed as ours,"
she said. "The Board of Trustees dis
cussed the issue which they never
would have, President Lyman and
Trustee Bing appeared before the
Senate which is totally unpre
cedented, and administrators met
with senators and other student
leaders.
'Milked clean'
"We have milked this tactic clean
and it is time to move on and apply
pressure both from inside and out,"
added Henkels.
ASSU Co-president Steve Westly
expressed concern over the senate
"setting a dangerous precedent in
overriding a committee recommen
dation." The Nominations Commit
tee had recommended that no stu
dents be nominated.
In a straw vote at the end of the

discussion, opinions were roughly
equally divided between having the
senate continue its present stance,
having the senate approve the three
nominees of last fall, and having the
senate charge the nominations
committee with making a search of
the community for new nomina
tions.
In other business, the senate ap
proved an expenditure of up to $70
for informing the community of the
"very real possibility of unplanned
pregnancy." In making the proposal,
McCormack pointed out that an av
erage of 85 to 100 unwanted pre
gnancies occur on the Stanford cam

pus ever year.
Another act adopted was termed
the "Stanford Due Process" amend
ment to the by-laws by its author
Senator Doug Bandow. The changes
made in response to last fall's con
troversial senate election would
make disqualification possible only
for violations of explicit rules in the
by-laws.
Two other changes would make it
necessary for each person to be
given reasonable notice of charges
against them and that they have a
chance to respond to these charges.
The last change would prohibit rules
from being applied retroactively.
ASSU Senator Rick Levy opened
discussion last night on the senate's
boycott of the CIR by asking the se
nate if they should stand by their
boycott or approve the appointment
of the three students nominated for
the CIR last fall.
"Wefelt," said Levy, "in takingour
initial stand that by not nominating
students we could have the greatest
affect, but we were clearly run over
by a power play."
"I was originally against nominat
ing students," said Senator Steven
Mentor, but he now calls the move
"a tactical error," and strongly re
commended nominating students.
Mentor also responded to Presi
dent Richard Lyman's defense of his
actions which appeared in the Daily
and elsewhere as "totally bizarre,"
especially with regard to constitu
tional questions asked of Lyman dur
