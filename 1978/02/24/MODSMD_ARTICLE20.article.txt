# Italian pizza making: an art that requires practice to perfect
## 
### Jill Liscom 
The crust is thin, but fluffy,
the cheese and tomato sauce
are applied sparingly and the
topping ranges from artichoke
hearts to salami. Now that's an
Italian pizza!
After spending one evening
working at La Pizzeria in La
Casa Italiana, I quickly learned
there is a difference between
Italian-style pizza and the
American-style pizza served at
Round Table, Shakey's or
Frankie, Johnnie and Luigi's,
Too.
Besides using less cheese
and sauce and having a thinner
crust, Italian pizza has milder
seasoning, and is less greasy
than the typical American
pizza. Also, Italian pizzas are
usually only made in one size
and a single serving is about
the size of a dinner plate.
Practice
Although the basic
techniques of pizza making
can be learned in a few hours,
there is an art to true Italian
pizza making which requires
time and practice to perfect.
Throwing the pizza in the air
with a spin, and more impor
tant, catching it properly on
the way down, probably takes
the most time to learn ccir
rectly. The pizza can be shaped

by gradually rotating the flat
tened dough over closed fists,
but pizza comes out rounder
and with a more even thickness
when it is tossed.
The success of the pizza re
ally depends on how the
dough is made, however. The
dough recipe, which the piz
zeria got from Tomaso's re
staurant in San Francisco, in
cludes yeast,flour, peanut oil,
salt and water.
Sticky dough
All of the ingredients are
dumped into a large mixing
bowl and are combined by a
big metal hook.
The dough maker periodi
cally has to stop the mixer and
put his finger into the sticky
mass of dough to see if it needs
more flour. When his finger
comes out clean, the dough is
ready.
Pulling the huge blob off of
the hook and out of the bowl is
no easy task. Elbow-deep in the
dough, I finally got it to roll
over the side of the bowl and
plop down on a floured sur
face, where it had to be
stretched out and cut into
half-pound wedges.
Balls
The next step is forming the
dough into smooth round balls
and leaving them to rise. After

rising, the dough is ready to be
made into pizza.
Out in front where the pizzas
are assembled it is more hectic,
but also more fun. On the
other hand, the customers can
observe you, and never fail to
be looking when you toss the
dough and it sails off in the
wrong direction.
On a normal Saturday night,
there are three students mak
ing pizzas, in an assembly line.
One forms the crust, another
puts on the cheese and sauce
and a third adds the topping.
Capricious pizza
The only really difficult pizza
to make is "Alia Capricciosa,"
the "capricious pizza," which
has an egg in the center, sur
rounded by artichoke hearts
and ham.
If the egg is not well
supported by the rest of the
topping, it tends to slide off of
the pizza when it comes out of
the oven, just as it did when I
was there.
Whenever anything goes
wrong with a pizza, such as
when it burns, or loses its top
ping en route to the oven or
out of the oven, it is labeled "La
Screw-up" and a rush order
goes to the front for another
pizza to be made.

According to Operations
Manager Ciacomo (Jim)
Hartley, the pizzeria's policy is
"if you wouldn't eat a pizza,
don't make it and don't send it
back to the oven."
Although there will some
times be football-shaped pizza
crusts that have to be scrap
ped, the majority of "screw
ups" occur in transporting the
pizza in and out of the oven,
particularly if the dough is not
dry and well-floured.
The employees get to eat any
screw-ups they wish, plus they
can make pizzas for them
selves.
Congenial
In general, the atmosphere
is congenial, relaxed and
good-natured, both among the
employees and the clientele.
The employees chat in Ita
lian, and occasionally sing in
Italian also, while guitar and
piano performers entertain
waiting customers out in the
lounge.
According to General Man
ager Matteo Cobb, La Pizzeria
serves an average of 265 cus
tomers between 5 and 12 p.m.
on a typical Saturday night, and
grosses close to $750 per night.
Debt
According to Cobb, the piz
zeria will be spending the rest

of this year paying off the $3000
it cost to set up the operation.
The major expense was buying
the 800-pound pizza oven.
Once the debt is paid off,
however, excess revenues will
go intoa cultural fund for films,
scholarships, and Italian books
and magazines, said Cobb.
La Pizzeria was conceived by
Cobb and Mark Nassutti a year
ago in January, said Cobb.
Duplicate
Afterwards, when Cobb was
in Italy, "I made a point to stop
at every pizzeria I could," he
explained. "One of our goals
was to duplicate the Italian
pizza as closely as possible.
The menu at La Pizzeria was
taken from menus collected in
Italy, although "We had to
compromise in some areas as
far as the cheese and crust go
to please the American tastes,"
said Cobb, referring to an op
tion on the menu for extra
cheese.
The menu also includes two
types of calzoni ("big sock")
which is a pizza crust folded in
half and sealed around the
edges with filling in the mid
dle.
Altre cose
"Altre cose" on the menu in
clude a salad bar, drinks, a dif
ferent dessert each week and
an additional item such as
lasagna or minestrone, which
varies from week to week.
The pizzeria has received
tremendous support from the
Italian House, according to
Cobb. La Pizzeria currently
employs 45 people, 35 of
whom are members of the
house. The other 10, said
Cobb, are either meal as
sociates or people who have
friends in the house.
The employees put in a total
of 120 man-hours each Satur
day, and work in two shifts. At
any one time there are 10
people working: a host or hos
tess, three waitresses, a bus
person, a dough maker, oven
operator and three pizza as
semblers.
Despite the hectic moments
when three pizzas in a row are
"screw-ups" and there is al
ready a long list of orders to be
filled, the operation basically
runs smoothly.
And considering that La Piz
zeria has only been open since
October 22 and is operated by
students whose main goal is
"to provide an Italian evening
and a chance for students here
to find out how pizza is served
in Italy," the pizzeria is a big
success.
