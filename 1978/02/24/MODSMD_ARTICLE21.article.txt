Stanford sports fans will get a
rare treat tonight as the men's
volleyball team hosts the
Japanese Collegiate All-Stars at
8 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
The Japanese, considered to
be one of the finest collegiate
teams in the world, present a
tough challenge to the Cardi
nals, and coach Art Lambert is
the first to admit it.
"It would take an all-out ef
fort from us plus a lot of luck to
upset the All-Stars," said Lam
bert. "Our approach to this
game will be as a learning ex
perience and an excellent
chance to promote the game in
the Bay Area."
Lambert assessed the
12-man Japanese squad as
"very .very quick and excep
tionally skilled." He added
they are "a great passing team
and are fine leapers."
Volleyball in Japan has be
come very popular, and has re
sulted, according to Lambert,
"in their game evolving to a
very sophisticated level. They
train 12 months a year. If any
thing, volleyball can be con
strued as Japan's national
sport."
The All-Stars are led by
senior setter Masashi Oda and
Kazuyuki Mizuta, considered
their best all-around player.
Stanford will be led by
sophomore middle blocker
Kim Lum. Other starters will be
Dave Saeta as the setter, Tom
Grimes, Rod Fletcher and Rich
Yardley as hitters, and Jack
Foxworth as the other middle
blocker.
The Cards are 4-0 in North
ern California Intercollegiate
Volleyball Conference play,
and their three losses have
come against the nation's top
two teams, Pepperdine and
UCLA.

Stanford is the fourth stop
on the All-Stars' five-match
tour. Before last night's match
at Cal-Berkeley, the All-Stars'
record stood at 1-1. USC upset
them in five games in the open
ing match, but the visitors
bounced back to defeat Cal-
Santa Barbara in three games
Monday night.
The match promises to be a
fine exhibition of volleyball.
Coach Lambert said, "If you
want to see how the game is
played internationally at a top
level, come see the match Fri
day night."
Tickets, which will be availa
ble at the gate, are S3 for
adults, and $2 for Stanford stu
dents and children under 12.
