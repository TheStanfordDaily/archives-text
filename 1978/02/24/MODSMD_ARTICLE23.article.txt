stringent time standards.
USC, UCLA and Stanford
should dominate the meet; all
are picked to place among the
top six teams at the AIAW*,
only three weeks away. Coach
)im Gaughran said of the
three-day competition, "It will
be interesting to see how we
match up against UCLA and
USC in a meet of this sort,
much like the AIAWs. It should
be a real dogfight between the
three teams for the team title.
Our swimmers are really look
ing forward to this meet which
is especially important for
those still seeking to make
AIAW standards in their
events."
Having already lost to USC,
which recently lost to UCLA,

superior depth and strength in
the distance events to outscore

their Los Angeles rivals. Valerie

the 400 individual medley, as is
Lee in the 200 butterfly, Peyton
in the 200 freestyle and Margot
Hagstette in the 200 IM.
In the shorter events, stroke
swimmers Zena Herrmann,

Peggy Haslach, Lisa Mehoff,

pressed to clinch top posi
tions! Bruin Shawn Houghton,
Trojan Sue Hinderaker, and
Santa Barbara's Sandi Neilson
are picked by Swimming World
magazine to sweep the 50
freestyle at the AIAWs.
UCLA will receive strong
support from former American
record holder Kathy Heddy
and backstrokers Tauna Van

deweghe and Luanne Cramer.
USC has solid backing from
Olympic breaststrokers De
bbie Rudd and Lauri Siering
and backstrokers Miriam Smith
and Lisa Hilger.
