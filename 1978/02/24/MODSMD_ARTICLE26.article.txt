# Cal cagers romp past Card women

### Sukie Jackson 
None of the Cardinals are
exactly sure why it happened,
but Tuesday in Berkeley the Cal
women's basketball team blew
out Stanford, 83-51. Earlier this
season, Stanford had defeated
Cal, 72-67.
"We might have been over
looking the Berkeley game and
thinking about San Jose in
stead," speculated forward
Kathy Murphy. "We were mis
sing our point player

(Stephanie Galef had the flu)
and nobody pulled up the
slack," commented assistant
coach Sue Rojcewicz. Regard
less of what problems Stanford
had, the Bears played an excel
lent game.
Led by junior guard Sheryl
Johnson and freshman forward
Colleen Galloway, the Bears
dominated the game from the
start to the finish. "We were
out of the game after the first
three minutes," Rojcewicz
said. "It was like we weren't on
the floor. We didn't execute
anything."
"They played a really good
game," Murphy said. The
Bears not only outscored and
outhustled Stanford but they
outrebounded the Cards too.
Cal, which has a height average
of 5-foot-7, pulled down 46 re
bounds to Stanford's 17.
Calloway had nine of those
rebounds and the game high of
27 points. Teammate Johnson
added 20 points. Kathy Murphy
led Stanford scoring with 21
points. Nelson scored 12 and
Beth Boylan added 10.
Losing to the Bears dropped
Stanford's hopes of winning
the Northern California Athle
tic Conference. The Cards,
now 8-2 in league play, trail
undefeated San Jose, which
will probably represent the
NCAC in the upcoming reg
ional tournament at Maples
Pavilion.
