# 'Speed City' title at stake as Cards open in track
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
A dozen years ago world record sprinters
were attracted to San Jose State like ants to a
picnic. The Spartans featured a cavalcade of
Olympic sprinters and San Jose earned a reputa
tion as "Speed City."
But gradually talk of Speed City died as no one
came along to replace the Tommie Smiths and
the Lee Evanses. After last year's San Jose State-
Stanford meeting, talk of Speed City revived.
Only this time it was the Cardinals saying that
sprinting preeminence in the Bay Area belonged
on the Farm.
Tomorrow the Cards open the outdoor track
and field seasonwithanll a.m. meet against the
Spartans at Bud Winters Field in San Jose. And
tomorrow Stanford sprinters must make good
their talk of a relocation of Speed City.
With the most talented group of runners —
hurdlers, middle distance runners, long dis
tance men as well as sprinters — to grace the
Stanford campus in recent years, the Cardinals
may have the speed to down the Spartans on the

track.
Two-time track and field All-America James
Lofton, quarter-miler Alan Sheats, versatile
Cordon Banks and frosh football phenom Dar
rin Nelson will allow Stanford to race stride for
stride with the Spartans in the sprints.
Tom Shellworth, third in the Pacific-8 400-
meter intermediate hurdles last year, and
freshman Ken Margerum face the titanic task of
leading Stanford's hurdlers against San Jose
State's Dedy Cooper. Cooper just completed an
undefeated indoor season.
Senior Dave Wells and freshmen Tom Lob
singerand Mark Stillman providethe Cards with
strength in the middle distances.
As was the cast last year, the most interesting
race of the San Jose-Stanford matchup may
prove to be the relays. Stanford's mile relay
quartet of Sheats, Shellworth, Banks and Lofton
destroyed a 37-year old school record last year
with a 3:08.5 clocking and all four return to give
Stanford "one of the best mile relay teams in the
nation," Card coach Payton Jordan said.
