# Ski team wraps up successful season
## 
### Dennis Romero 
"Our performance this year? Fantastic!
We've got the strongest team Stanford's
seen in at least eight years."
That bit of optimism was voiced by al
pine coach Tom Hutton about the excel
lent achievements of the Stanford ski team
this season.
Indeed, Stanford is fielding a strong
team of competitors this year, led by team
captains Dave Herbert and Kit Weld. With
senior Laurie Graham leading the women,
the Stanford women's team has also had
outstanding success and shown remarka
ble improvement through the year.
Ski competition is divided into alpine
and nordic events. Alpine includes slalom
and giant slalom, while nordic competi
tion is comprised of cross-country and
35-meter jumping. The cross-country
races are 15 kilometers for the men and
five for the women. Of these events, ac
cording to Herbert, the Cards' forte is
men's alpine because of the experience
they have and the consistency they've
shown.
Despite the lack of a proper environ

ment for skiing at Stanford, the team main
tains a rigorous training schedule
throughout the entire week. During the
weekdays, they conduct dry-land condi
tioning with running, weight training and
stretching exercises. Then each Friday
they head for Soda Springs at Lake Tahoe,
where they drill on the specific events.
Stanford's season began during Christ
mas vacation. In their first meet, the wo
men's team achieved a first-place award
and the men took second, while Herbert
received the Ski Meister Award for out
standing competitor in the meet.
In their second meet, both the men's
and women's teams took second. The re
sults of the third meet weredisappointing,
even though the men did extremely well in
the nordic events by taking a first in jump
ing.
The Pacific Coast Conference in which
Stanford competes includes Nevada-
Reno, Cal, UC-Davis and Washington.
Traditionally, Nevada-Reno has domi
nated the conference, but Stanford has
shown promise of threatening the
Wolfpack's position this year.

Stanford will conclude its season this
weekend with the conference champion
ships at Squaw Valley. Hutton expressed
"great faith in Rusty Schartz to do well in
jumping" and expects Vic Haverly to turn
in a strong performance in cross country.
Hutton added, "I expect all of the women
to place highly. They have a good chance
of winning as a team."
The conference championships serve as
a qualifying meet for both the men's NCAA
championships to be held in Canon, N.H.,
and the women's AIAW finals slated for
Red River, N.M. Stanford hopes to be rep
resented in both.
This year's successes have probably re
sulted from the extremely high level of
team morale and self-sufficiency. The
team has developed itself into a seriously
contending team, despite the fact that it
receives little financial support from the
athletic department.
With the success it has achieved this
season, the Stanford ski team can look not
only to a strong showing in post-season
finals, but also count on being a serious
contender for several seasons to come.

received the Ski Meister Award for out
standing competitor in the meet.
In their second meet, both the men's
and women's teams took second. The re
sults of the third meet weredisappointing,
even though the men did extremely well in
the nordic events by taking a first in jump
ing.
The Pacific Coast Conference in which
Stanford competes includes Nevada-
Reno, Cal, UC-Davis and Washington.
Traditionally, Nevada-Reno has domi
nated the conference, but Stanford has
shown promise of threatening the
Wolfpack's position this year.

Stanford will conclude its season this
weekend with the conference champion
ships at Squaw Valley. Hutton expressed
"great faith in Rusty Schartz to do well in
jumping" and expects Vic Haverly to turn
in a strong performance in cross country.
Hutton added, "I expect all of the women
to place highly. They have a good chance
of winning as a team."
The conference championships serve as
a qualifying meet for both the men's NCAA
championships to be held in Canon, N.H.,
and the women's AIAW finals slated for
Red River, N.M. Stanford hopes to be rep
resented in both.
This year's successes have probably re
sulted from the extremely high level of
team morale and self-sufficiency. The
team has developed itself into a seriously
contending team, despite the fact that it
receives little financial support from the
athletic department.
With the success it has achieved this
season, the Stanford ski team can look not
only to a strong showing in post-season
finals, but also count on being a serious
contender for several seasons to come.
"Our performance this year? Fantastic!
We've got the strongest team Stanford's
seen in at least eight years."
That bit of optimism was voiced by al
pine coach Tom Hutton about the excel
lent achievements of the Stanford ski team
this season.
Indeed, Stanford is fielding a strong
team of competitors this year, led by team
captains Dave Herbert and Kit Weld. With
senior Laurie Graham leading the women,
the Stanford women's team has also had
outstanding success and shown remarka
ble improvement through the year.
Ski competition is divided into alpine
and nordic events. Alpine includes slalom
and giant slalom, while nordic competi
tion is comprised of cross-country and
35-meter jumping. The cross-country
races are 15 kilometers for the men and
five for the women. Of these events, ac
cording to Herbert, the Cards' forte is
men's alpine because of the experience
they have and the consistency they've
shown.
Despite the lack of a proper environ

ment for skiing at Stanford, the team main
tains a rigorous training schedule
throughout the entire week. During the
weekdays, they conduct dry-land condi
tioning with running, weight training and
stretching exercises. Then each Friday
they head for Soda Springs at Lake Tahoe,
where they drill on the specific events.
Stanford's season began during Christ
mas vacation. In their first meet, the wo
men's team achieved a first-place award
and the men took second, while Herbert
received the Ski Meister Award for out
standing competitor in the meet.
