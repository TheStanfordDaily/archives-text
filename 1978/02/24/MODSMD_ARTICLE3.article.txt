# Indonesian lectures on country's military
## 
### Thomas Richman 
In a lucid and lively lecture here yesterday, Selo
Soemardjan, personal secretary to the vice
president of Indonesia and former dean of the
University of Indonesia's school of social sciences,
spoke on "The Civilian and the Military in In
donesia."
Illustrating his talk with examples of his experi
ences in the army and government, Soemardjan
traced historical reasons behind the armed forces'
strong influences in Indonesia's internal affairs.
In 1945, after 350 years of Dutch colonial rule,
Indonesia declared its independence. However,
the country found itself in a sdcial, political and
economic vacuum because its people had no
knowledge of political or economic organization,
Soemardjan said.
Soemardjan described how leaders of the re
volution attempted to establish a democratic form
of government. Sukarno and Hata were given titles
of president and vice-president, respectively.
An incomplete draft of a constitution, written
while the country was under temporary Japanese
rule during World War 11, was adopted. "These
were symbols only," he stated.
At the first national parliament in 1955,
Soemardjan said with a grin, there were 104 politi
cal parties. "We didn't even know how to organize
elections and we had 104 political parties," he

exclaimed. But four years later the political parties
merged into 14 different groups.
Another difficulty which Indonesia faced after
independence was inflation. In 1966 the inflation
rate was 650 per cent, Soemardjan said. "In the
morning rice would cost 300 rupiya a kilo, and at
night it would cost 350."
Throughout the period from 1950 to 1962
numerous armed rebellions were launched
against the central government by various disil
lusioned groups, Soemardjan stated. After an at
tempt by the Communist Party in which six army
generals were assassinated, President Sukarno is
sued a written mandate to the general of the
armed forces to restore and maintain law and or
der.
This document came to be known as the "11
March 1966 Instruction." It provided the basis for
a military entrance into the internal affairs of the
Indonesian government, Soemardjan said.
He then described the historical development
of the armed forces. They grew naturally, he
explained, from the guerrilla resistance to the
Dutch colonialists.
Soemardjan humorously illustrated the disor
ganization after independence. It was decided
that someone should be commander of the army,
he said. Soemardjan declared himself chief of staff
and appointed "my friends, of course," to the

ranks of majors, captains and lieutenants. "You
don't want to appoint people you don't know,"he
said.
The army had few weapons, the navy had no
boats and the air force had no planes. "The navy
had its training in the mountains," Soemardjan
stated.
Since 1966 the military has had a "dual func
tion": to work as an armed military force and as an
armed socio-political force.
In 1965 Suharto became president. He reor
ganized the government, Soemardjan stated. The
14 political parties became two: the Democratic
Party, consisting of Nationalists, Catholics and
Protestants; and the United Party, comprised of
Islamic groups.
A third "functional group," called the Golkar,
was encouraged to participate in the government.
The latter "includes all groupings which have been
functional during the revolution," Soemardjan
said, including the armed forces, women's
groups, youth groups and professional organiza
tions.
Today the Golkar holds about 62 per cent of the
legislative seats. The United Party holds 30 per
cent and the Democratic Party holds 8 per cent of
the vote.

against the central government by various disil
lusioned groups, Soemardjan stated. After an at
tempt by the Communist Party in which six army
generals were assassinated, President Sukarno is
sued a written mandate to the general of the
armed forces to restore and maintain law and or
der.
This document came to be known as the "11
March 1966 Instruction." It provided the basis for
a military entrance into the internal affairs of the
Indonesian government, Soemardjan said.
He then described the historical development
of the armed forces. They grew naturally, he
explained, from the guerrilla resistance to the
Dutch colonialists.
Soemardjan humorously illustrated the disor
ganization after independence. It was decided
that someone should be commander of the army,
he said. Soemardjan declared himself chief of staff
and appointed "my friends, of course," to the

ranks of majors, captains and lieutenants. "You
don't want to appoint people you don't know,"he
said.
The army had few weapons, the navy had no
boats and the air force had no planes. "The navy
had its training in the mountains," Soemardjan
stated.
Since 1966 the military has had a "dual func
tion": to work as an armed military force and as an
armed socio-political force.
In 1965 Suharto became president. He reor
ganized the government, Soemardjan stated. The
14 political parties became two: the Democratic
Party, consisting of Nationalists, Catholics and
Protestants; and the United Party, comprised of
Islamic groups.
A third "functional group," called the Golkar,
was encouraged to participate in the government.
The latter "includes all groupings which have been
functional during the revolution," Soemardjan
said, including the armed forces, women's
groups, youth groups and professional organiza
tions.
Today the Golkar holds about 62 per cent of the
legislative seats. The United Party holds 30 per
cent and the Democratic Party holds 8 per cent of
the vote.
In a lucid and lively lecture here yesterday, Selo
Soemardjan, personal secretary to the vice
president of Indonesia and former dean of the
University of Indonesia's school of social sciences,
spoke on "The Civilian and the Military in In
donesia."
Illustrating his talk with examples of his experi
ences in the army and government, Soemardjan
traced historical reasons behind the armed forces'
strong influences in Indonesia's internal affairs.
In 1945, after 350 years of Dutch colonial rule,
Indonesia declared its independence. However,
the country found itself in a sdcial, political and
economic vacuum because its people had no
knowledge of political or economic organization,
Soemardjan said.
Soemardjan described how leaders of the re
volution attempted to establish a democratic form
of government. Sukarno and Hata were given titles
of president and vice-president, respectively.
An incomplete draft of a constitution, written
while the country was under temporary Japanese
rule during World War 11, was adopted. "These
were symbols only," he stated.
At the first national parliament in 1955,
Soemardjan said with a grin, there were 104 politi
cal parties. "We didn't even know how to organize
elections and we had 104 political parties," he

exclaimed. But four years later the political parties
merged into 14 different groups.
Another difficulty which Indonesia faced after
independence was inflation. In 1966 the inflation
rate was 650 per cent, Soemardjan said. "In the
morning rice would cost 300 rupiya a kilo, and at
night it would cost 350."
Throughout the period from 1950 to 1962
numerous armed rebellions were launched
against the central government by various disil
lusioned groups, Soemardjan stated. After an at
tempt by the Communist Party in which six army
generals were assassinated, President Sukarno is
sued a written mandate to the general of the
armed forces to restore and maintain law and or
der.
