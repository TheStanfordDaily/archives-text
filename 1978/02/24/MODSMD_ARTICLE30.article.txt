# Stanford drops double-header
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford varsity baseball
team suffered its first losses of
the '78 season Tuesday af
ternoon in Fresno when the
Bulldogs swept a doublebill
from the Cards. In Tuesday's
first game, a nine inning con
test, Fresno won 4-2; and in the
second game, a seven inning
affair, Fresno scored one run in
the bottom of the last inning to
win, 9-8.
The two losses came at the

end of a six-games-in-five-days
stint during which the Cards
posted three more home field
victories. Stanford is nowB-2-1.
Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess didn't sound disap
pointed with the losses and
said he feels the competition
thus far has been very benefi
cial. "They were two very well
played ballgames," he com
mented. "I can say as a coach,
I've won games and been a lot
more upset with the way we

played."
In the first game Card starter
Mark Abbondola gave up a
two-run homer in the bottom
of the first inning to give
Fresno a lead it would maintain
throughout the contest. Ab
bondola settled down after the
rough inning but nevertheless
was tagged with his first loss in
three appearances.
The second game began on a
much brighter note for Stan
ford when Tom Guardino hit
his fourth homerun of the sea
son with Randy Wong on base.
Leftfielder Pepe Hinojosa con
tributed to the cause in the top
of the second inning driving in
two runs with a single, and
Wong singled in one more to

make the score 5-0 in Stan
ford's favor. Fresno got on the
scoreboard in the bottom of
the second with three runs.
After Fresno had gone ahead
in the third, Stanford tied the
game in the seventh.
Fresno replied in the bottom
of the seventh with one run to
win the game. Kick Hallstead
walked two men with one away
and then gave up an RBI base
hit to shortstop Ray Reyes.
