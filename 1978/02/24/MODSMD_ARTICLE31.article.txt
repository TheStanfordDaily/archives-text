In a nonconference match
Wednesday, the Stanford wo
men's tennis team defeated
Cal in Berkeley, 7-1. The victory
over the Bears lifted the team's
record to three wins and no
losses this year.
The Cardinals, lacking two

top players, still managed to
rout the Bears before dark
ness. All-America Barbara Jor
dan was in Florida for a tour
nament, and Dianne Morrison
was in Maryland for a tourna
ment, but their absence was al
leviated by sizzling play from
the rest of the team.
Stanford's freshman kathy
Jordan, the younger sister of
Barbara, had no problem in
beating Beth Fernbacher 6-2,
6-0. Susie Hagey also gave only
two games in punishing Kim
Greenhouse of Berkeley 6-1,
6-1. Nancy Rudd had three
match points, but failed to cap
ture them as she lost an excit
ing three-set match to Mallory
Lynch of Berkeley 4-6, 6-2, 6-7.
Stanford won all the other
matches. Freshman Donna
Rubin crushed Pam
Baughman, 6-1, 6-0. Sally
Thompson pulled out a third
set victory over Toni Reed, 6-2,
2-6, 6-3, and Audrey Kemp beat
Cayle Schmutz 6-2, 6-2.
In doubles action, the No. 1
team of Jordan-Hagey defeated
Greenhouse-Fernbacher 6-3,
6-3. Freshman Caryn Hertel
and Thompson took their
match 6-0, 7-5 against Barry and
Baughman. The team of Rudd
and Rubin failed to complete
their match as darkness set in;
the score before termination
was 5-3 in Stanford's favor.
