# Women gymnasts end slate at home
## 
### Dean Eyre 
The last opportunity to view gymnastics on campus this season
will be tonight at 6 p.m. as Stanford's women host Long Beach
State and Sacramento State in Encina Gym.
"They're (Long Beach) a very good team; they've been scoring
about 130 points, so it's just like when we competed against San
lose â€” it really isn't a win or lose situation," said Stanford's head
coach jackie Walker. She added, "Even with Sam (Muramatsu,
who is out with a sprained knee) we would not have won the meet
anyway. It just puts a little more pressure on everybody else on
the team."
With Muramatsu recuperating, all but one of the six remaining
gymnasts will compete in the four events. Tonight's roster in
cludes freshmen Loretta Cordova and Linda Park, and sopho
mores jackie Eaby, Kerry koller, Dana Padden and Cindy Sed
lund. Koller won't compete on beam, but the other team mem
bers will be going all-around.
"I think that the girls are getting stronger in the last week and a
half," said Walker. "I think our rest really helped. This will be a
good chance to see if they can make it show up in the meet. A lot
of the girls have even noticed that and said that they wish we were
at the beginning of the season instead of near the end.
"There's no way we can beat Long Beach, but I'm looking
forward to having the girls do better performances. They seem to
be more ready for this meet than the last couple because of the
rest," she said.
The 49ers have Kristy Durward, who pertormed a Sukahara
vault and received a 9.45 score for first place in the Western
Hemisphere Games last Saturday. With the local and visiting
talent, the meet should provide a good display of gymnastics.
