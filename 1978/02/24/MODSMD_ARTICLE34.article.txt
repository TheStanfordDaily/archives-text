Egypt 'blocking' U.S. efforts
Jerusalem — American efforts to mediate a Mid
dle East peace settlement are running into snags
because of a toughened Egyptian stand, Israeli
officials said yesterday.
A pessimistic view of chances for an Egyptian-
Israeli agreement leaked out of a closed briefing
given Wednesday by Foreign Minister Moshe
Dayan to Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Security
Committee.
President Anwar Sadat of Egypt appears to be
retreating from his acceptance of a U.S. formula to
break the negotiating deadlock, the officials said,
and they confirmed that Dayan saw an erosion in
Egypt's position.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin will leave for
Washington on March 12 to seek a way out of the
impasse. Officials said President Jimmy Carter
asked Dayan to return with Begin and Defense
Minister Ezer Weizman will extend an arms buying
mission to the United States to attend.
According to the Israeli analysis, complex
inter-Arab politics sandbagged the compromise.
Sadat is withdrawing his support, officials said,
because he believes Carter's policy is unaccepta
ble to King Hussein of Jordan.
The Israelis do not believe Sadat will conclude a
peace agreement without Hussein's backing.
Labor official wounded by bullet
San Francisco — A powerful San Francisco labor
official was wounded in the head yesterday morn
ing when he was ambushed as he arrived for work
by a would-be assassin.
Police said George Evankovich, 47, was struck in
the forehead by a single bullet from a .22-caliber
pistol as he entered the headquarters of Laborers
Union Local 261.
Evankovich was reported in stable condition at
Mission Emergency Hospital. Surgery was planned
to remove the slug from his skull, the hospital
reported.
Evankovich was a leader in a bitter 38-day strike
for higher wages by municipal crafts workers in
the spring of 1976.
Judge allows Nazis to march
Chicago — A federal judge yesterday threw out
three ordinances by which the predominantly
Jewish suburb of Skokie hoped to stop a band of
Nazis from marching down its streets on the April
20th birthday of their idol, Adolf Hitler.
Skokie Mayor Albert Smith said the village will
appeal. If it stands, the decision apparently will
remove the last roadblock in a long legal battle by
Frank Collin and his National Socialist Party of
America for the right to parade in Skokie with
swastikas emblazoned on their storm-trooper un
iforms.

The Illinois Supreme Court recently overturned
a Circuit Court injunction against such a march.
Webster sworn in as FBI director
Washington — William Webster, a federal judge
for the last seven years, took over direction of the
FBI yesterday with a promise to make his tenure a
symbol of integrity and the agency a standard for
law enforcement.
In a 20-minute swearing-in ceremony held for
the first time in the FBI building named for |. Edgar
Hoover, Webster, 53, took the oath of office from
Chief Justice Warren Burger and was given praise
and good wishes by President Jimmy Carter, the
man who picked him for the job.
The former judge has committed himself to a
10-year term that would extend beyond Carter's
tenure in office even if the president is re-elected
in 1980.
British drug case winds up
Bristol, England — The last of 31 defendants will
be sentenced next week in the windup of the
biggest drug bust in the annals of British crime, a
"British Connection" police say was supplying 60
per cent of the world's street-corner LSD.
The operation, which police said pulled in an
estimated $230 million, was begun by a
university-educated gang in 1971 with distribution
links in New York, Paris, Amsterdam and Sydney.
It was smashed last March in raids by 800 police on
locations across Britain.
Wayne Hays runs for legislature
Columbus, Ohio — Wayne Flays, whose career as
one of the nation's most powerful congressmen
was cut short by the Elizabeth Ray sex scandal,
re-entered politics yesterday as a candidate for the
Ohio Legislature.
Flays, 67, said he will seek the Democratic
nomination in June for the 99th district seat now
held by Rep. A.C. Lancione, a Democrat who is
retiring at age 72.
At least five other Democrats are running in the
primary for a chance at representing the 99th dis
trict, which incorporates three rural south-eastern
Ohio counties dotted with farms and coal fields.
Cities violate clean air laws
Washington — A majority of Americans breathe
air that is considered harmful to their health de
spite evidence that the nation's air generally is
cleaner than in the past, the Environmental Protec
tion Agency (EPA) said yesterday.
This conclusion is based on a new study by the
EPA showing that air in nearly all major metropoli
tan areas — where most of the U.S. population

lives violates national pollution standards.
The EPA, which is responsible for enforcing pol
lution control laws, concluded that the nation's
urban areas "must develop new strategies for con
tinuing their progress towards meeting . . . na
tional air pollution standards."
Jarvis fails to meet with Behr
Sacramento — Howard Jarvis, author of the
property tax initiative on the June ballot, failed to
show up yesterday at a joint appearance with Sen.
Peter Behr (R-Tiburon) whom he called a "senile
old man."
Jarvis later denied he had used those words, said
he had forgotten about the appearance, and is
sued an apology to the legislator.
It was the third time in a month, and second in
the last two days, that Jarvis, 74-year-old sponsor
of Proposition 13, had not turned up at a
scheduled appearance with a legislator who op
posed the initiative.
McMahon files $2.5 million suit
Los Angeles — Ed McMahon, Johnny Carson's
sidekick on "The Tonight Show," has filed a $2.5
million libel suit against the weekly National En
quirer; Sunset News Co. Inc., a distributor of the
tabloid, and Safeway Stores, which stocks the
paper for sale.
Attorney Milton Rudin, who filed the suit Tues
day, contends the television personality was
libeled in two National Enquirer articles last year.
In one of the articles, McMahon, dubbed
"Ready Eddie," was said to have made "a mad
scramble for the door" of a restaurant in Rome "to
introduce himself to a stunning 6-fcot-2 black
model. . . ."
The other article described McMahon as being
inordinately vain and alleged he "secretly treated
himself to a facial snip-and-tuck," usually called a
facelift, during a recent European vacation.

gures, staged a late rally yesterday that enabled the
Dow Jones industrial average to score its first gain

The Dow average of 30 blue chips, which had
fallen 33.61 points during the last nine trading
days, managed a 1.90 gain to 750.95.

British drug case winds up
Bristol, England — The last of 31 defendants will
be sentenced next week in the windup of the
biggest drug bust in the annals of British crime, a
"British Connection" police say was supplying 60
per cent of the world's street-corner LSD.
The operation, which police said pulled in an
estimated $230 million, was begun by a
university-educated gang in 1971 with distribution
links in New York, Paris, Amsterdam and Sydney.
It was smashed last March in raids by 800 police on
locations across Britain.

Columbus, Ohio — Wayne Flays, whose career as
one of the nation's most powerful congressmen
was cut short by the Elizabeth Ray sex scandal,

Ohio Legislature.

nomination in June for the 99th district seat now
held by Rep. A.C. Lancione, a Democrat who is
retiring at age 72.
At least five other Democrats are running in the
primary for a chance at representing the 99th dis
trict, which incorporates three rural south-eastern
Ohio counties dotted with farms and coal fields.
Cities violate clean air laws
Washington — A majority of Americans breathe
air that is considered harmful to their health de
spite evidence that the nation's air generally is
cleaner than in the past, the Environmental Protec
tion Agency (EPA) said yesterday.
This conclusion is based on a new study by the
EPA showing that air in nearly all major metropoli
tan areas — where most of the U.S. population

lives violates national pollution standards.
The EPA, which is responsible for enforcing pol
lution control laws, concluded that the nation's
urban areas "must develop new strategies for con
tinuing their progress towards meeting . . . na
tional air pollution standards."
Jarvis fails to meet with Behr
Sacramento — Howard Jarvis, author of the
property tax initiative on the June ballot, failed to
show up yesterday at a joint appearance with Sen.
Peter Behr (R-Tiburon) whom he called a "senile
old man."
Jarvis later denied he had used those words, said
he had forgotten about the appearance, and is
sued an apology to the legislator.
It was the third time in a month, and second in
the last two days, that Jarvis, 74-year-old sponsor
of Proposition 13, had not turned up at a
scheduled appearance with a legislator who op
posed the initiative.
McMahon files $2.5 million suit
Los Angeles — Ed McMahon, Johnny Carson's
sidekick on "The Tonight Show," has filed a $2.5
million libel suit against the weekly National En
quirer; Sunset News Co. Inc., a distributor of the
tabloid, and Safeway Stores, which stocks the
paper for sale.
Attorney Milton Rudin, who filed the suit Tues
day, contends the television personality was
libeled in two National Enquirer articles last year.
In one of the articles, McMahon, dubbed
"Ready Eddie," was said to have made "a mad
scramble for the door" of a restaurant in Rome "to
introduce himself to a stunning 6-fcot-2 black
model. . . ."
The other article described McMahon as being
inordinately vain and alleged he "secretly treated
himself to a facial snip-and-tuck," usually called a
facelift, during a recent European vacation.
Dow Jones gains 1.90
New York — The stock market, buttressed by
anticipation of some favorable money-supply fi
gures, staged a late rally yesterday that enabled the
Dow Jones industrial average to score its first gain
in 10 sessions.
The Dow average of 30 blue chips, which had
fallen 33.61 points during the last nine trading
days, managed a 1.90 gain to 750.95.

Egypt 'blocking' U.S. efforts
Jerusalem — American efforts to mediate a Mid
dle East peace settlement are running into snags
because of a toughened Egyptian stand, Israeli
officials said yesterday.
A pessimistic view of chances for an Egyptian-
Israeli agreement leaked out of a closed briefing
given Wednesday by Foreign Minister Moshe
Dayan to Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Security
Committee.
President Anwar Sadat of Egypt appears to be
retreating from his acceptance of a U.S. formula to
break the negotiating deadlock, the officials said,
and they confirmed that Dayan saw an erosion in
Egypt's position.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin will leave for
Washington on March 12 to seek a way out of the
impasse. Officials said President Jimmy Carter
asked Dayan to return with Begin and Defense
Minister Ezer Weizman will extend an arms buying
mission to the United States to attend.
According to the Israeli analysis, complex
inter-Arab politics sandbagged the compromise.
Sadat is withdrawing his support, officials said,
because he believes Carter's policy is unaccepta
ble to King Hussein of Jordan.
The Israelis do not believe Sadat will conclude a
peace agreement without Hussein's backing.
Labor official wounded by bullet
San Francisco — A powerful San Francisco labor
official was wounded in the head yesterday morn

by a would-be assassin.
Police said George Evankovich, 47, was struck in
the forehead by a single bullet from a .22-caliber
pistol as he entered the headquarters of Laborers
Union Local 261.
Evankovich was reported in stable condition at
Mission Emergency Hospital. Surgery was planned
to remove the slug from his skull, the hospital
reported.
Evankovich was a leader in a bitter 38-day strike
for higher wages by municipal crafts workers in
the spring of 1976.
Judge allows Nazis to march
Chicago — A federal judge yesterday threw out
three ordinances by which the predominantly
Jewish suburb of Skokie hoped to stop a band of
Nazis from marching down its streets on the April
20th birthday of their idol, Adolf Hitler.
Skokie Mayor Albert Smith said the village will
appeal. If it stands, the decision apparently will
remove the last roadblock in a long legal battle by
Frank Collin and his National Socialist Party of
America for the right to parade in Skokie with
swastikas emblazoned on their storm-trooper un
iforms.

The Illinois Supreme Court recently overturned
a Circuit Court injunction against such a march.

tabloid, and Safeway Stores, which stocks the
paper for sale.
Attorney Milton Rudin, who filed the suit Tues
day, contends the television personality was
libeled in two National Enquirer articles last year.
In one of the articles, McMahon, dubbed
"Ready Eddie," was said to have made "a mad
scramble for the door" of a restaurant in Rome "to
introduce himself to a stunning 6-fcot-2 black
model. . . ."
The other article described McMahon as being
inordinately vain and alleged he "secretly treated
himself to a facial snip-and-tuck," usually called a
facelift, during a recent European vacation.

anticipation of some favorable money-supply fi
gures, staged a late rally yesterday that enabled the
Dow Jones industrial average to score its first gain

Egypt 'blocking' U.S. efforts
Jerusalem — American efforts to mediate a Mid
dle East peace settlement are running into snags
because of a toughened Egyptian stand, Israeli
officials said yesterday.
A pessimistic view of chances for an Egyptian-
Israeli agreement leaked out of a closed briefing
given Wednesday by Foreign Minister Moshe
Dayan to Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Security
Committee.
President Anwar Sadat of Egypt appears to be
retreating from his acceptance of a U.S. formula to
break the negotiating deadlock, the officials said,
and they confirmed that Dayan saw an erosion in
Egypt's position.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin will leave for
Washington on March 12 to seek a way out of the
impasse. Officials said President Jimmy Carter
asked Dayan to return with Begin and Defense
Minister Ezer Weizman will extend an arms buying
mission to the United States to attend.
According to the Israeli analysis, complex
inter-Arab politics sandbagged the compromise.
Sadat is withdrawing his support, officials said,
because he believes Carter's policy is unaccepta
ble to King Hussein of Jordan.
The Israelis do not believe Sadat will conclude a
peace agreement without Hussein's backing.
Labor official wounded by bullet
San Francisco — A powerful San Francisco labor
official was wounded in the head yesterday morn
ing when he was ambushed as he arrived for work
by a would-be assassin.

the forehead by a single bullet from a .22-caliber
pistol as he entered the headquarters of Laborers
Union Local 261.
Evankovich was reported in stable condition at
Mission Emergency Hospital. Surgery was planned
to remove the slug from his skull, the hospital

Judge allows Nazis to march
Chicago — A federal judge yesterday threw out
three ordinances by which the predominantly
Jewish suburb of Skokie hoped to stop a band of
Nazis from marching down its streets on the April
20th birthday of their idol, Adolf Hitler.
Skokie Mayor Albert Smith said the village will
appeal. If it stands, the decision apparently will
remove the last roadblock in a long legal battle by
Frank Collin and his National Socialist Party of
America for the right to parade in Skokie with
swastikas emblazoned on their storm-trooper un
iforms.

The Illinois Supreme Court recently overturned
a Circuit Court injunction against such a march.
Webster sworn in as FBI director

the first time in the FBI building named for |. Edgar
Hoover, Webster, 53, took the oath of office from
Chief Justice Warren Burger and was given praise
and good wishes by President Jimmy Carter, the
man who picked him for the job.
The former judge has committed himself to a
10-year term that would extend beyond Carter's
tenure in office even if the president is re-elected
in 1980.
British drug case winds up
Bristol, England — The last of 31 defendants will
be sentenced next week in the windup of the
biggest drug bust in the annals of British crime, a
"British Connection" police say was supplying 60
per cent of the world's street-corner LSD.
The operation, which police said pulled in an

links in New York, Paris, Amsterdam and Sydney.
It was smashed last March in raids by 800 police on
locations across Britain.
Wayne Hays runs for legislature
Columbus, Ohio — Wayne Flays, whose career as

nomination in June for the 99th district seat now
held by Rep. A.C. Lancione, a Democrat who is
retiring at age 72.

Cities violate clean air laws
Washington — A majority of Americans breathe
air that is considered harmful to their health de
spite evidence that the nation's air generally is
cleaner than in the past, the Environmental Protec
tion Agency (EPA) said yesterday.
This conclusion is based on a new study by the
EPA showing that air in nearly all major metropoli
tan areas — where most of the U.S. population

lives violates national pollution standards.
The EPA, which is responsible for enforcing pol
lution control laws, concluded that the nation's
urban areas "must develop new strategies for con
tinuing their progress towards meeting . . . na
tional air pollution standards."
Jarvis fails to meet with Behr
Sacramento — Howard Jarvis, author of the
property tax initiative on the June ballot, failed to
show up yesterday at a joint appearance with Sen.

old man."
Jarvis later denied he had used those words, said
he had forgotten about the appearance, and is
sued an apology to the legislator.
It was the third time in a month, and second in
the last two days, that Jarvis, 74-year-old sponsor
of Proposition 13, had not turned up at a
scheduled appearance with a legislator who op
posed the initiative.
