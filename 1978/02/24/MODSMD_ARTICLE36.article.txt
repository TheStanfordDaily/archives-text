# ASSU task force report calls overseas studies an 'essential luxury' for Stanford
## 
### 
Last spring, in response to student concern over the
closing of the Beutelsbach campus and the threatened closure
of the Berlin program, the ASSU Senate created a Task Force
on the Place of Overseas Studies at the University. The Task
Force was instructed to "recommend to the Provost and/or
Academic Senate. . .what should be the future status of the
Overseas Program as well as any changes in funding priority
which might be necessary to realize that status."
In fulfilling its charge, the Task Force has examined the
rationale behind the Overseas Program, with respect to the
general philosophy of education at Stanford, faculty partici
pation in the Program, integration of the Overseas Studies
with academic departments and curricula, the structure and
academic quality of the programs.
RATIONALE
The Task Force recognizes three basic dimensions which
an academic experience overseas adds to a Stanford educa
tion;
First, the Overseas Program holds a wealth of opportunity
for first-hand reseach, field work, and study for faculty,
graduate students, and undergraduates alike. Such opportu
nities are an appropriate part of any university which aspires
to provide a superior education.
Second, the perspective gained in living in a different
country gives a new dimension to the student's understanding
of both his or her own culture and the newly encountered
one. Through the comparison of different cultures and value
systems, the student can better appreciate and evaluate each
one.
Third, as technology continues to shrink our world, it
becomes increasingly important for students—regardless of
their course of study or career goals— to have a clear under
standing of the realities and implications of our transnational
world. Experiencing another side of economic, political, and
cultural interdependence adds an important dimension to the
student's developing world-view.
Fourth, the Overseas Program can be an effective way of
meeting or helping to meet the goals of the Western Culture
and distribution requirements.
These added dimensions to academics and to the student's
cultural understanding and world-view are among the general
aims of any foreign studies program. Stanford students would
benefit in these ways by studying with other universities or
through exchange programs. Why, then, one might ask,
should Stanford have its own overseas program?
The Stanford Overseas Program was initially founded and
continues to operate upon the belief that all students can
benefit from an academic experience overseas.
While in most universities only students who demonstrate
a serious commitment to the study of some aspect of a given
foreign culture can expect to study overseas, the Overseas
Studies Program at Stanford offers virtually every student the
opportunity to spend a quarter or more abroad. The Office
of Admissions asserts that Overseas Studies is an important
factor for many students in their decision to apply to and/or
enroll at Stanford.
Unfortunately, no formal studies have been conducted as
yet to determine precisely the effect of Overseas Studies on
admissions. The Task Force recommends that such studies be
conducted regularly through the Office of the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies.
Nevertheless, after many interviews with students and
various university officers, the Task Force can only conclude
that the opportunity for every undergraduate to study
abroad sets Stanford apart from comparable universities and
is an important part of the "Stanford experience." Further
more, because it is unique to Stanford, the Task Force
recommends that the Overseas Studies Program receive even
more emphasis within the University and be recognized as the
tremendous academic and cultural asset that it is.
The Overseas Studies Program holds a wealth of opportu
nities as yet unexploited. The Task Force submits that fuller
utilization of these opportunities requires attention in the
following areas:
* Faculty participation,
* integration of Overseas Studies with home campus aca
demic departments and curricula,
* structuring of the programs.
FACULTY PARTICIPATION
As an extension of the home campus, the Overseas Pro
gram should strive to maintain a level of academic excellence
consonant with that of the home campus. Perhaps the most
effective way of insuring high academic standards overseas is
to enlist greater participation of Stanford home faculty in
study centers abroad

In recent years the number of faculty going overseas has
dropped markedly, with 15 faculty quarters being filled this
year, compared with 50 in 1971. Asa consequence,the Over
seas Program seems to have lost touch with, and the support
of, a great portion of the Stanford community. There appear
to be a few things, however, which can be done to solve the
current problem of minimal faculty participation.
One difficulty seems to be that each program is now so
closely tied to the particular foreign community and culture
in which it operates. While this is a noble idea, and while
academically it often works well, the Overseas Program has
gone too far at times in ensuring that the academic programs
be tightly integrated within the given foreign situation. The
idea of the "focus program", designed expressly with thai
purpose in mind, has been minimally successful. Very few
students have made use of a whole program; most have taken
part in one-third or two-thirds of it, thus undermining the
purpose of the "focus program."
Many faculty seem to be discouraged from applying for a
position at an overseas campus because of a mistaken belief
that only courses specifically appropriate to the particular
foreign community may be taught at an overseas campus.
Both the Task Force and the Office of Overseas Studies
recognize that the value of courses which deal specifically
with the locale or culture in which they are taught is out
weighed by the importance of increasing Stanford faculty
participation in the Overseas Program. The Office of Overseas
Studies should make a concerted effort to inform the faculty
that a broad range of courses are acceptable to be taught
overseas.
Two other factors which have contributed to the decrease
in Stanford faculty commitment overseas are the lack of a
well-organized publicity campaign on the part of the Overseas
Program and a diminishing supply of financial resources upon
which to draw.
The first point is quite important, since in the past Stan
ford faculty members wanting to teach overseas (or simply to
learn more about the program) often had to take it upon
themselves to approach the Overseas Program. The Office of
Overseas Studies has recently initiated a substantial campaign
to promote Stanford faculty participation overseas. The Task
Force applauds this effort and encourages the Overseas Office
to continue to increase the advertisement of faculty opportu
nities overseas.
Finances have been the major factor in the reduction of
faculty quarters overseas. A greatly reduced budget leaves the
Office of Overseas Studies unable to meet the extra costs of
sending Stanford faculty to the foreign campuses. In the
planning of the Overseas budget the Provost should be made
aware of the essential value of strong faculty participation to
the Stanford Overseas Program.
There are many sound academic reasons why Stanford
faculty members should be encouraged to teach overseas. The
comparatively small size of each overseas campus affords
ready and frequent interaction between faculty members and
students. The opportunity for students to get to know fa
culty members well (both inside and outside the classroom) is
an invaluable one, both while overseas and after professors
and students have returned to the home campus. Such oppor
tunity arises repeatedly in the Overseas Studies Program, and
is reported as one of its clear advantages by students and
professors alike.
The different teaching milieu at the overseas centers en
ables faculty members to teach courses that they may have
previously been unable to teach because of a lack of either
resources or time. The rich and plentiful indigenous resources
at the disposal of the faculty member overseas, such as
galleries, museums, libraries, architecture, colleagues, etc.,
may serve as strong foundations on which to base a course
that relates directly to the local area.
Undoubtedly, then, Stanford faculty are an asset to the
Overseas Program. The Overseas Studies Office should work
even more intensively toward familiarizing Stanford faculty
and departments with the Overseas Program. This may be
accomplished through mailings, newsletters, and conferences.
If the decline in the number of faculty members going
overseas is due simply to a lack of knowledge about the
opportunities overseas by the home faculty, the aforemen
tioned publicity steps would be an effective remedy.
INTEGRATION WITH HOME DEPARTMENTS AND
CURRICULA
A result of sending fewer Stanford faculty members over
seas has been increased dependence of the program upon
foreign faculty. Certainly many outstanding foreign faculty
are teaching at the various centers; yet such an excessive
reliance upon ihum takes away from some of the uniqueness

of the program. Departments have trouble accrediting many
overseas courses towards a major because they know very
little about the course or the teacher. It must be asked
whether or not the Stanford program has become a "foreign"
university in and of itself, for it has certainly become much
more alienated from the home campus.
Better communication between the Overseas Program and
the Stanford community is essential if the great potential of
Stanford Overseas Studies is to be realized. Increased faculty
participation would help improve communication with and
increase the understanding of the community concerning the
value of the overseas centers. Greater faculty involvement
could also help bridge the gap between individual depart
ments and the campuses overseas.
Departmental accreditation has been a big problem faced
by students overseas because departments in general are more
apt to deny than to grant credit towards a major for a course
taught overseas, especially by someone not well-known aca
demically to the departmental faculty. Part of this stems
from a lack of knowledge about and involvement in the
Overseas Program on the part of departments. There is also
the uncertainty, at times, of some departments about the
quality of courses taught at the different centers. Greater
cooperation between the respective departments and the Of
fice of Overseas Studies is essential.
The Task Force was impressed with the importance of
orientation and preparation of students for the overseas ex
perience. Judging from the cases that came to its attention, it
appears that a considerable number of students have very
little knowledge of the curriculum or of special programs
offered at one or another of the overseas campuses. In some
instances they were completely ignorant of instructional re
sources before their arrival.
This is in no way due to lack of orientation programs by
the Overseas Studies Office, which devotes considerable ef
fort to provide this service. Students, however, seem to treat
this as an extracurricular or class activity with low priority,
with the consequence that some attend no sessions at all and
many only the first and least substantively academic one.
Students who attend the full three sessions, on the other
hand, find them extremely valuable. Of those who express
criticism or frustration during the course of their studies
overseas, the majority appear to be inadequately oriented to
what they will find. In addition, some students are very
strongly of the opinion that they benefited greatly by prior
development of at least some minimal personal goals they
wished to pursue in the course of their stay abroad.
Members of the Overseas Office make themselves gene
rously available to discuss with participants the feasibility of
their goals in the particular campus they wish to attend, but
few students avail themselves of this resource. They should
be encouraged to do so.
The Task Force is unanimous in its opinion that for
tverseas studies to be maximally effective requires some
measure of special and thoughtful preparation on the part of
students. This is for two reasons.
First, while the curricula have been greatly expanded in
recent years, there is obviously a much narrower range of
courses to sampl*? as one might do on the home campus.
Second, a significant part of the learning experience con
sists in knowing resources—the setting, institutions, and local
scholars—available to the student. Participants therefore
should be expected to make a certain commitment in ad
vance of departure in order to fulfill the educational aims of
the progam and his or her expectations. There should, in
other words, be some minimal degree of advance pianning
and thought about reasons for going by all students who
intend to participate.
Attendance at the formal orientation sessions provided by
the Overseas Studies Office should be made mandatory for all
applicants who are admitted, including those high on the
waiting list. As a special part of the orientation program,
students should be asked to prepare a statement indicating a
major goal of their study overseas. This may be purely
academic in nature or may involve some combination of
academic and appropriate experience.
In conclusion, the Task Force wishes to make the follow
ing observations:
We commend the Office of Overseas Studies for its new
policies of advertising and the increased publicity campaign it
has mounted. We also urge the Stanford community to sup
port the Overseas Program in its efforts to provide opportu
nities for study in third-wo rid countries, as well as in its
European centers. We wish, finally, that use of the Rechtel
iternational Center by students intending to go or returning
i om overseas be strongly encouraged. A fine resource such js

Been re/ should be used especially by returning students to
continue their international experience.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
The Task Force on Overseas Studies makes the followiryq
recommendations in the following areas:
Status of Overseas Studies within the University
1. The Overseas Studies Program should not be considered
a luxury, but an essential part of Stanford. The effect of
Overseas Studies in drawing students to the University' and
the value of an academic experience overseas for any student
lead the Task Force to conclude that the Overseas Studies
Program is an asset which the Univesity should utilize and
develop as fully as possible.
2. Studies should be made to determine the effect of the
Overseas Studies Program on enrollment at Stanford, and to
evaluate the integration of Overseas Studies into students'
curricula. Periodic studies should also be made to ascertain
the attitudes of alumni and graduating students toward their
overseas experience. Such studies may stimulate further im
provements in the Overseas Program and its advertising cam
paigns.
Faculty Participation
1. The Office of Overseas Studies should develop a com
p ehensive pamphlet explaining the purposes and opportu
nties of the Overseas Studies program. This pamphlet should
be sent to all faculty members along with an invitation to
apply to teach and/or conduct research overseas.
2. The Task Force recognizes the value of courses tailored
to each particular overseas campus. In the interest of in
creasing faculty participation in the overseas program, how
ever, a broader scope of courses should be acceptable. This is
not to say that faculty should be permitted to teach any type
of course they may wish to offer overseas, but that the policy
of accepting only courses directly relating to a particular area
or country should be less strictly applied.
Integration of Overseas Programs.
1. Overseas Studies offers the opportunity of study
abroad to every student. It is a fundamental difficulty, how
ever, for students with highly structured or sequential majors
to take even one or two quarters away from the "core"
courses and sequences offered at the home campus. There
fore, the Overseas office should impress upon advisors the
importance of informing students about the opportunities for
studies abroad early in their academic careers, and encourage
them to keep these opportunities in mind as they plan their
curricula.
2. Increased participation of Stanford faculty in the over
seas programs, and greater involvement of the appropriate
departments in selecting the overseas faculty, in establishing
the overseas curricula, and in ascertaining that academic
standards equivalent to those of the home departments are
maintained would facilitate the accrediting of courses for
student majors.
3. "Focus programs" at the overseas campuses can be
instrumental in balancing academics overseas with the cul
tural experience. The Task Force encourages the Committee
on Foreign Studies to reexamine the potential benefits and
the limitations of "focus programs."
4. Attendance at formal orientation sessions should be
required of all students admitted to the Overseas Program
and all those high on the waiting lists. Such participation
might serve to reduce misapprehensions and unrealistic ex
pectations about the programs that lead to disappointment
on the part of some students with their overseas experience.
Students should also be advised to have certain specific
academic aims in mind in choosing their time and place of
overseas study, and they should be encouraged to formulate
these aims with the assistance of timely and appropriate
faculty and staff counseling.

country gives a new dimension to the student's understanding
of both his or her own culture and the newly encountered
one. Through the comparison of different cultures and value
systems, the student can better appreciate and evaluate each
one.
Third, as technology continues to shrink our world, it
becomes increasingly important for students—regardless of
their course of study or career goals— to have a clear under
standing of the realities and implications of our transnational
world. Experiencing another side of economic, political, and
cultural interdependence adds an important dimension to the
student's developing world-view.
Fourth, the Overseas Program can be an effective way of
meeting or helping to meet the goals of the Western Culture
and distribution requirements.
These added dimensions to academics and to the student's
cultural understanding and world-view are among the general
aims of any foreign studies program. Stanford students would
benefit in these ways by studying with other universities or
through exchange programs. Why, then, one might ask,
should Stanford have its own overseas program?
The Stanford Overseas Program was initially founded and
continues to operate upon the belief that all students can
benefit from an academic experience overseas.
While in most universities only students who demonstrate
a serious commitment to the study of some aspect of a given
foreign culture can expect to study overseas, the Overseas
Studies Program at Stanford offers virtually every student the
opportunity to spend a quarter or more abroad. The Office
of Admissions asserts that Overseas Studies is an important
factor for many students in their decision to apply to and/or
enroll at Stanford.
Unfortunately, no formal studies have been conducted as
yet to determine precisely the effect of Overseas Studies on
admissions. The Task Force recommends that such studies be
conducted regularly through the Office of the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies.
Nevertheless, after many interviews with students and
various university officers, the Task Force can only conclude
that the opportunity for every undergraduate to study
abroad sets Stanford apart from comparable universities and
is an important part of the "Stanford experience." Further
more, because it is unique to Stanford, the Task Force
recommends that the Overseas Studies Program receive even
more emphasis within the University and be recognized as the
tremendous academic and cultural asset that it is.
The Overseas Studies Program holds a wealth of opportu
nities as yet unexploited. The Task Force submits that fuller
utilization of these opportunities requires attention in the
following areas:
* Faculty participation,
* integration of Overseas Studies with home campus aca
demic departments and curricula,
* structuring of the programs.
FACULTY PARTICIPATION
As an extension of the home campus, the Overseas Pro
gram should strive to maintain a level of academic excellence
consonant with that of the home campus. Perhaps the most
effective way of insuring high academic standards overseas is
to enlist greater participation of Stanford home faculty in
study centers abroad

In recent years the number of faculty going overseas has
dropped markedly, with 15 faculty quarters being filled this
year, compared with 50 in 1971. Asa consequence,the Over
seas Program seems to have lost touch with, and the support
of, a great portion of the Stanford community. There appear
to be a few things, however, which can be done to solve the
current problem of minimal faculty participation.
One difficulty seems to be that each program is now so
closely tied to the particular foreign community and culture
in which it operates. While this is a noble idea, and while
academically it often works well, the Overseas Program has
gone too far at times in ensuring that the academic programs
be tightly integrated within the given foreign situation. The
idea of the "focus program", designed expressly with thai
purpose in mind, has been minimally successful. Very few
students have made use of a whole program; most have taken
part in one-third or two-thirds of it, thus undermining the
purpose of the "focus program."
Many faculty seem to be discouraged from applying for a
position at an overseas campus because of a mistaken belief
that only courses specifically appropriate to the particular
foreign community may be taught at an overseas campus.
Both the Task Force and the Office of Overseas Studies
recognize that the value of courses which deal specifically
with the locale or culture in which they are taught is out
weighed by the importance of increasing Stanford faculty
participation in the Overseas Program. The Office of Overseas
Studies should make a concerted effort to inform the faculty
that a broad range of courses are acceptable to be taught
overseas.
Two other factors which have contributed to the decrease
in Stanford faculty commitment overseas are the lack of a
well-organized publicity campaign on the part of the Overseas
Program and a diminishing supply of financial resources upon
which to draw.
The first point is quite important, since in the past Stan
ford faculty members wanting to teach overseas (or simply to
learn more about the program) often had to take it upon
themselves to approach the Overseas Program. The Office of
Overseas Studies has recently initiated a substantial campaign
to promote Stanford faculty participation overseas. The Task
Force applauds this effort and encourages the Overseas Office
to continue to increase the advertisement of faculty opportu
nities overseas.
Finances have been the major factor in the reduction of
faculty quarters overseas. A greatly reduced budget leaves the
Office of Overseas Studies unable to meet the extra costs of
sending Stanford faculty to the foreign campuses. In the
planning of the Overseas budget the Provost should be made
aware of the essential value of strong faculty participation to
the Stanford Overseas Program.
There are many sound academic reasons why Stanford
faculty members should be encouraged to teach overseas. The
comparatively small size of each overseas campus affords
ready and frequent interaction between faculty members and
students. The opportunity for students to get to know fa
culty members well (both inside and outside the classroom) is
an invaluable one, both while overseas and after professors
and students have returned to the home campus. Such oppor
tunity arises repeatedly in the Overseas Studies Program, and
is reported as one of its clear advantages by students and
professors alike.
The different teaching milieu at the overseas centers en
ables faculty members to teach courses that they may have
previously been unable to teach because of a lack of either
resources or time. The rich and plentiful indigenous resources
at the disposal of the faculty member overseas, such as
galleries, museums, libraries, architecture, colleagues, etc.,
may serve as strong foundations on which to base a course
that relates directly to the local area.
Undoubtedly, then, Stanford faculty are an asset to the
Overseas Program. The Overseas Studies Office should work
even more intensively toward familiarizing Stanford faculty
and departments with the Overseas Program. This may be
accomplished through mailings, newsletters, and conferences.
If the decline in the number of faculty members going
overseas is due simply to a lack of knowledge about the
opportunities overseas by the home faculty, the aforemen
tioned publicity steps would be an effective remedy.
INTEGRATION WITH HOME DEPARTMENTS AND
CURRICULA
A result of sending fewer Stanford faculty members over
seas has been increased dependence of the program upon
foreign faculty. Certainly many outstanding foreign faculty
are teaching at the various centers; yet such an excessive
reliance upon ihum takes away from some of the uniqueness

of the program. Departments have trouble accrediting many
overseas courses towards a major because they know very
little about the course or the teacher. It must be asked
whether or not the Stanford program has become a "foreign"
university in and of itself, for it has certainly become much
more alienated from the home campus.
Better communication between the Overseas Program and
the Stanford community is essential if the great potential of
Stanford Overseas Studies is to be realized. Increased faculty
participation would help improve communication with and
increase the understanding of the community concerning the
value of the overseas centers. Greater faculty involvement
could also help bridge the gap between individual depart
ments and the campuses overseas.
Departmental accreditation has been a big problem faced
by students overseas because departments in general are more
apt to deny than to grant credit towards a major for a course
taught overseas, especially by someone not well-known aca
demically to the departmental faculty. Part of this stems
from a lack of knowledge about and involvement in the
Overseas Program on the part of departments. There is also
the uncertainty, at times, of some departments about the
quality of courses taught at the different centers. Greater
cooperation between the respective departments and the Of
fice of Overseas Studies is essential.
The Task Force was impressed with the importance of
orientation and preparation of students for the overseas ex
perience. Judging from the cases that came to its attention, it
appears that a considerable number of students have very
little knowledge of the curriculum or of special programs
offered at one or another of the overseas campuses. In some
instances they were completely ignorant of instructional re
sources before their arrival.
This is in no way due to lack of orientation programs by
the Overseas Studies Office, which devotes considerable ef
fort to provide this service. Students, however, seem to treat
this as an extracurricular or class activity with low priority,
with the consequence that some attend no sessions at all and
many only the first and least substantively academic one.
Students who attend the full three sessions, on the other
hand, find them extremely valuable. Of those who express
criticism or frustration during the course of their studies
overseas, the majority appear to be inadequately oriented to
what they will find. In addition, some students are very
strongly of the opinion that they benefited greatly by prior
development of at least some minimal personal goals they
wished to pursue in the course of their stay abroad.
Members of the Overseas Office make themselves gene
rously available to discuss with participants the feasibility of
their goals in the particular campus they wish to attend, but
few students avail themselves of this resource. They should
be encouraged to do so.
The Task Force is unanimous in its opinion that for
tverseas studies to be maximally effective requires some
measure of special and thoughtful preparation on the part of
students. This is for two reasons.
First, while the curricula have been greatly expanded in
recent years, there is obviously a much narrower range of
courses to sampl*? as one might do on the home campus.
Second, a significant part of the learning experience con
sists in knowing resources—the setting, institutions, and local
scholars—available to the student. Participants therefore
should be expected to make a certain commitment in ad
vance of departure in order to fulfill the educational aims of
the progam and his or her expectations. There should, in
other words, be some minimal degree of advance pianning
and thought about reasons for going by all students who
intend to participate.
Attendance at the formal orientation sessions provided by
the Overseas Studies Office should be made mandatory for all
applicants who are admitted, including those high on the
waiting list. As a special part of the orientation program,
students should be asked to prepare a statement indicating a
major goal of their study overseas. This may be purely
academic in nature or may involve some combination of
academic and appropriate experience.
In conclusion, the Task Force wishes to make the follow
ing observations:
We commend the Office of Overseas Studies for its new
policies of advertising and the increased publicity campaign it
has mounted. We also urge the Stanford community to sup
port the Overseas Program in its efforts to provide opportu
nities for study in third-wo rid countries, as well as in its
European centers. We wish, finally, that use of the Rechtel
iternational Center by students intending to go or returning
i om overseas be strongly encouraged. A fine resource such js

Been re/ should be used especially by returning students to
continue their international experience.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
The Task Force on Overseas Studies makes the followiryq
recommendations in the following areas:
Status of Overseas Studies within the University
1. The Overseas Studies Program should not be considered
a luxury, but an essential part of Stanford. The effect of
Overseas Studies in drawing students to the University' and
the value of an academic experience overseas for any student
lead the Task Force to conclude that the Overseas Studies
Program is an asset which the Univesity should utilize and
develop as fully as possible.
2. Studies should be made to determine the effect of the
Overseas Studies Program on enrollment at Stanford, and to
evaluate the integration of Overseas Studies into students'
curricula. Periodic studies should also be made to ascertain
the attitudes of alumni and graduating students toward their
overseas experience. Such studies may stimulate further im
provements in the Overseas Program and its advertising cam
paigns.
Faculty Participation
1. The Office of Overseas Studies should develop a com
p ehensive pamphlet explaining the purposes and opportu
nties of the Overseas Studies program. This pamphlet should
be sent to all faculty members along with an invitation to
apply to teach and/or conduct research overseas.
2. The Task Force recognizes the value of courses tailored
to each particular overseas campus. In the interest of in
creasing faculty participation in the overseas program, how
ever, a broader scope of courses should be acceptable. This is
not to say that faculty should be permitted to teach any type
of course they may wish to offer overseas, but that the policy
of accepting only courses directly relating to a particular area
or country should be less strictly applied.
Integration of Overseas Programs.
1. Overseas Studies offers the opportunity of study
abroad to every student. It is a fundamental difficulty, how
ever, for students with highly structured or sequential majors
to take even one or two quarters away from the "core"
courses and sequences offered at the home campus. There
fore, the Overseas office should impress upon advisors the
importance of informing students about the opportunities for
studies abroad early in their academic careers, and encourage
them to keep these opportunities in mind as they plan their
curricula.
2. Increased participation of Stanford faculty in the over
seas programs, and greater involvement of the appropriate
departments in selecting the overseas faculty, in establishing
the overseas curricula, and in ascertaining that academic
standards equivalent to those of the home departments are
maintained would facilitate the accrediting of courses for
student majors.
3. "Focus programs" at the overseas campuses can be
instrumental in balancing academics overseas with the cul
tural experience. The Task Force encourages the Committee
on Foreign Studies to reexamine the potential benefits and
the limitations of "focus programs."
4. Attendance at formal orientation sessions should be
required of all students admitted to the Overseas Program
and all those high on the waiting lists. Such participation
might serve to reduce misapprehensions and unrealistic ex
pectations about the programs that lead to disappointment
on the part of some students with their overseas experience.
Students should also be advised to have certain specific
academic aims in mind in choosing their time and place of
overseas study, and they should be encouraged to formulate
these aims with the assistance of timely and appropriate
faculty and staff counseling.

Last spring, in response to student concern over the
closing of the Beutelsbach campus and the threatened closure
of the Berlin program, the ASSU Senate created a Task Force
on the Place of Overseas Studies at the University. The Task
Force was instructed to "recommend to the Provost and/or
Academic Senate. . .what should be the future status of the
Overseas Program as well as any changes in funding priority
which might be necessary to realize that status."
In fulfilling its charge, the Task Force has examined the
rationale behind the Overseas Program, with respect to the
general philosophy of education at Stanford, faculty partici
pation in the Program, integration of the Overseas Studies
with academic departments and curricula, the structure and
academic quality of the programs.
RATIONALE
The Task Force recognizes three basic dimensions which
an academic experience overseas adds to a Stanford educa
tion;
First, the Overseas Program holds a wealth of opportunity
for first-hand reseach, field work, and study for faculty,
graduate students, and undergraduates alike. Such opportu
nities are an appropriate part of any university which aspires
to provide a superior education.
Second, the perspective gained in living in a different
country gives a new dimension to the student's understanding
of both his or her own culture and the newly encountered
one. Through the comparison of different cultures and value
systems, the student can better appreciate and evaluate each

a serious commitment to the study of some aspect of a given
foreign culture can expect to study overseas, the Overseas
Studies Program at Stanford offers virtually every student the
opportunity to spend a quarter or more abroad. The Office
of Admissions asserts that Overseas Studies is an important
factor for many students in their decision to apply to and/or
enroll at Stanford.
Unfortunately, no formal studies have been conducted as
yet to determine precisely the effect of Overseas Studies on
admissions. The Task Force recommends that such studies be
conducted regularly through the Office of the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies.
Nevertheless, after many interviews with students and
various university officers, the Task Force can only conclude
that the opportunity for every undergraduate to study
abroad sets Stanford apart from comparable universities and
is an important part of the "Stanford experience." Further
more, because it is unique to Stanford, the Task Force
recommends that the Overseas Studies Program receive even
more emphasis within the University and be recognized as the
tremendous academic and cultural asset that it is.
The Overseas Studies Program holds a wealth of opportu
nities as yet unexploited. The Task Force submits that fuller
utilization of these opportunities requires attention in the
following areas:
* Faculty participation,
* integration of Overseas Studies with home campus aca
demic departments and curricula,
* structuring of the programs.
FACULTY PARTICIPATION
As an extension of the home campus, the Overseas Pro
gram should strive to maintain a level of academic excellence
consonant with that of the home campus. Perhaps the most
effective way of insuring high academic standards overseas is
to enlist greater participation of Stanford home faculty in
study centers abroad

In recent years the number of faculty going overseas has
dropped markedly, with 15 faculty quarters being filled this
year, compared with 50 in 1971. Asa consequence,the Over
seas Program seems to have lost touch with, and the support
of, a great portion of the Stanford community. There appear
to be a few things, however, which can be done to solve the
current problem of minimal faculty participation.
One difficulty seems to be that each program is now so
closely tied to the particular foreign community and culture
in which it operates. While this is a noble idea, and while
academically it often works well, the Overseas Program has
gone too far at times in ensuring that the academic programs
be tightly integrated within the given foreign situation. The
idea of the "focus program", designed expressly with thai
purpose in mind, has been minimally successful. Very few
students have made use of a whole program; most have taken
part in one-third or two-thirds of it, thus undermining the
purpose of the "focus program."
Many faculty seem to be discouraged from applying for a
position at an overseas campus because of a mistaken belief
that only courses specifically appropriate to the particular
foreign community may be taught at an overseas campus.
Both the Task Force and the Office of Overseas Studies
recognize that the value of courses which deal specifically
with the locale or culture in which they are taught is out
weighed by the importance of increasing Stanford faculty
participation in the Overseas Program. The Office of Overseas
Studies should make a concerted effort to inform the faculty
that a broad range of courses are acceptable to be taught
overseas.
Two other factors which have contributed to the decrease
in Stanford faculty commitment overseas are the lack of a
well-organized publicity campaign on the part of the Overseas
Program and a diminishing supply of financial resources upon
which to draw.
The first point is quite important, since in the past Stan
ford faculty members wanting to teach overseas (or simply to
learn more about the program) often had to take it upon
themselves to approach the Overseas Program. The Office of
Overseas Studies has recently initiated a substantial campaign
to promote Stanford faculty participation overseas. The Task
Force applauds this effort and encourages the Overseas Office
to continue to increase the advertisement of faculty opportu
nities overseas.
Finances have been the major factor in the reduction of
faculty quarters overseas. A greatly reduced budget leaves the
Office of Overseas Studies unable to meet the extra costs of
sending Stanford faculty to the foreign campuses. In the
planning of the Overseas budget the Provost should be made
aware of the essential value of strong faculty participation to
the Stanford Overseas Program.
There are many sound academic reasons why Stanford
faculty members should be encouraged to teach overseas. The
comparatively small size of each overseas campus affords
ready and frequent interaction between faculty members and
students. The opportunity for students to get to know fa
culty members well (both inside and outside the classroom) is
an invaluable one, both while overseas and after professors
and students have returned to the home campus. Such oppor
tunity arises repeatedly in the Overseas Studies Program, and
is reported as one of its clear advantages by students and
professors alike.
The different teaching milieu at the overseas centers en
ables faculty members to teach courses that they may have
previously been unable to teach because of a lack of either
resources or time. The rich and plentiful indigenous resources
at the disposal of the faculty member overseas, such as
galleries, museums, libraries, architecture, colleagues, etc.,
may serve as strong foundations on which to base a course
that relates directly to the local area.
Undoubtedly, then, Stanford faculty are an asset to the
Overseas Program. The Overseas Studies Office should work
even more intensively toward familiarizing Stanford faculty
and departments with the Overseas Program. This may be
accomplished through mailings, newsletters, and conferences.
If the decline in the number of faculty members going
overseas is due simply to a lack of knowledge about the
opportunities overseas by the home faculty, the aforemen
tioned publicity steps would be an effective remedy.
INTEGRATION WITH HOME DEPARTMENTS AND
CURRICULA
A result of sending fewer Stanford faculty members over
seas has been increased dependence of the program upon
foreign faculty. Certainly many outstanding foreign faculty
are teaching at the various centers; yet such an excessive
reliance upon ihum takes away from some of the uniqueness

of the program. Departments have trouble accrediting many
overseas courses towards a major because they know very
little about the course or the teacher. It must be asked
whether or not the Stanford program has become a "foreign"
university in and of itself, for it has certainly become much
more alienated from the home campus.
Better communication between the Overseas Program and
the Stanford community is essential if the great potential of
Stanford Overseas Studies is to be realized. Increased faculty
participation would help improve communication with and
increase the understanding of the community concerning the
value of the overseas centers. Greater faculty involvement
could also help bridge the gap between individual depart
ments and the campuses overseas.
Departmental accreditation has been a big problem faced
by students overseas because departments in general are more
apt to deny than to grant credit towards a major for a course
taught overseas, especially by someone not well-known aca
demically to the departmental faculty. Part of this stems
from a lack of knowledge about and involvement in the
Overseas Program on the part of departments. There is also
the uncertainty, at times, of some departments about the
quality of courses taught at the different centers. Greater
cooperation between the respective departments and the Of
fice of Overseas Studies is essential.
The Task Force was impressed with the importance of
orientation and preparation of students for the overseas ex
perience. Judging from the cases that came to its attention, it
appears that a considerable number of students have very
little knowledge of the curriculum or of special programs
offered at one or another of the overseas campuses. In some
instances they were completely ignorant of instructional re
sources before their arrival.
This is in no way due to lack of orientation programs by
the Overseas Studies Office, which devotes considerable ef
fort to provide this service. Students, however, seem to treat
this as an extracurricular or class activity with low priority,
with the consequence that some attend no sessions at all and
many only the first and least substantively academic one.
Students who attend the full three sessions, on the other
hand, find them extremely valuable. Of those who express
criticism or frustration during the course of their studies
overseas, the majority appear to be inadequately oriented to
what they will find. In addition, some students are very
strongly of the opinion that they benefited greatly by prior
development of at least some minimal personal goals they
wished to pursue in the course of their stay abroad.
Members of the Overseas Office make themselves gene
rously available to discuss with participants the feasibility of
their goals in the particular campus they wish to attend, but
few students avail themselves of this resource. They should
be encouraged to do so.
The Task Force is unanimous in its opinion that for
tverseas studies to be maximally effective requires some
measure of special and thoughtful preparation on the part of
students. This is for two reasons.
First, while the curricula have been greatly expanded in
recent years, there is obviously a much narrower range of
courses to sampl*? as one might do on the home campus.
Second, a significant part of the learning experience con
sists in knowing resources—the setting, institutions, and local
scholars—available to the student. Participants therefore
should be expected to make a certain commitment in ad
vance of departure in order to fulfill the educational aims of
the progam and his or her expectations. There should, in
other words, be some minimal degree of advance pianning
and thought about reasons for going by all students who
intend to participate.
Attendance at the formal orientation sessions provided by
the Overseas Studies Office should be made mandatory for all
applicants who are admitted, including those high on the
waiting list. As a special part of the orientation program,
students should be asked to prepare a statement indicating a
major goal of their study overseas. This may be purely
academic in nature or may involve some combination of
academic and appropriate experience.
In conclusion, the Task Force wishes to make the follow
ing observations:
We commend the Office of Overseas Studies for its new
policies of advertising and the increased publicity campaign it
has mounted. We also urge the Stanford community to sup
port the Overseas Program in its efforts to provide opportu
nities for study in third-wo rid countries, as well as in its
European centers. We wish, finally, that use of the Rechtel
iternational Center by students intending to go or returning
i om overseas be strongly encouraged. A fine resource such js

Been re/ should be used especially by returning students to
continue their international experience.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
The Task Force on Overseas Studies makes the followiryq
recommendations in the following areas:
Status of Overseas Studies within the University
1. The Overseas Studies Program should not be considered
a luxury, but an essential part of Stanford. The effect of
Overseas Studies in drawing students to the University' and
the value of an academic experience overseas for any student
lead the Task Force to conclude that the Overseas Studies
Program is an asset which the Univesity should utilize and
develop as fully as possible.
2. Studies should be made to determine the effect of the
Overseas Studies Program on enrollment at Stanford, and to
evaluate the integration of Overseas Studies into students'
curricula. Periodic studies should also be made to ascertain
the attitudes of alumni and graduating students toward their
overseas experience. Such studies may stimulate further im
provements in the Overseas Program and its advertising cam
paigns.
Faculty Participation
1. The Office of Overseas Studies should develop a com
p ehensive pamphlet explaining the purposes and opportu
nties of the Overseas Studies program. This pamphlet should
be sent to all faculty members along with an invitation to
apply to teach and/or conduct research overseas.
2. The Task Force recognizes the value of courses tailored
to each particular overseas campus. In the interest of in
creasing faculty participation in the overseas program, how
ever, a broader scope of courses should be acceptable. This is
not to say that faculty should be permitted to teach any type
of course they may wish to offer overseas, but that the policy
of accepting only courses directly relating to a particular area
or country should be less strictly applied.
Integration of Overseas Programs.
1. Overseas Studies offers the opportunity of study
abroad to every student. It is a fundamental difficulty, how
ever, for students with highly structured or sequential majors
to take even one or two quarters away from the "core"
courses and sequences offered at the home campus. There
fore, the Overseas office should impress upon advisors the
importance of informing students about the opportunities for
studies abroad early in their academic careers, and encourage
them to keep these opportunities in mind as they plan their
curricula.
2. Increased participation of Stanford faculty in the over
seas programs, and greater involvement of the appropriate
departments in selecting the overseas faculty, in establishing
the overseas curricula, and in ascertaining that academic
standards equivalent to those of the home departments are
maintained would facilitate the accrediting of courses for
student majors.
3. "Focus programs" at the overseas campuses can be
instrumental in balancing academics overseas with the cul
tural experience. The Task Force encourages the Committee
on Foreign Studies to reexamine the potential benefits and
the limitations of "focus programs."
4. Attendance at formal orientation sessions should be
required of all students admitted to the Overseas Program
and all those high on the waiting lists. Such participation
might serve to reduce misapprehensions and unrealistic ex
pectations about the programs that lead to disappointment
on the part of some students with their overseas experience.
Students should also be advised to have certain specific
academic aims in mind in choosing their time and place of
overseas study, and they should be encouraged to formulate
these aims with the assistance of timely and appropriate
faculty and staff counseling.

Last spring, in response to student concern over the
closing of the Beutelsbach campus and the threatened closure
of the Berlin program, the ASSU Senate created a Task Force
on the Place of Overseas Studies at the University. The Task
Force was instructed to "recommend to the Provost and/or
Academic Senate. . .what should be the future status of the
Overseas Program as well as any changes in funding priority
which might be necessary to realize that status."
In fulfilling its charge, the Task Force has examined the
rationale behind the Overseas Program, with respect to the
general philosophy of education at Stanford, faculty partici
pation in the Program, integration of the Overseas Studies
with academic departments and curricula, the structure and
academic quality of the programs.
RATIONALE
The Task Force recognizes three basic dimensions which
an academic experience overseas adds to a Stanford educa
tion;
First, the Overseas Program holds a wealth of opportunity
for first-hand reseach, field work, and study for faculty,
graduate students, and undergraduates alike. Such opportu
nities are an appropriate part of any university which aspires
to provide a superior education.
Second, the perspective gained in living in a different
country gives a new dimension to the student's understanding
of both his or her own culture and the newly encountered
one. Through the comparison of different cultures and value
systems, the student can better appreciate and evaluate each
one.
Third, as technology continues to shrink our world, it
becomes increasingly important for students—regardless of
their course of study or career goals— to have a clear under
standing of the realities and implications of our transnational
world. Experiencing another side of economic, political, and
cultural interdependence adds an important dimension to the
student's developing world-view.
Fourth, the Overseas Program can be an effective way of
meeting or helping to meet the goals of the Western Culture
and distribution requirements.
These added dimensions to academics and to the student's
cultural understanding and world-view are among the general
aims of any foreign studies program. Stanford students would
benefit in these ways by studying with other universities or
through exchange programs. Why, then, one might ask,
should Stanford have its own overseas program?
The Stanford Overseas Program was initially founded and
continues to operate upon the belief that all students can
benefit from an academic experience overseas.
While in most universities only students who demonstrate

* integration of Overseas Studies with home campus aca
demic departments and curricula,
* structuring of the programs.
FACULTY PARTICIPATION
As an extension of the home campus, the Overseas Pro
gram should strive to maintain a level of academic excellence
consonant with that of the home campus. Perhaps the most
effective way of insuring high academic standards overseas is
to enlist greater participation of Stanford home faculty in
study centers abroad

In recent years the number of faculty going overseas has
dropped markedly, with 15 faculty quarters being filled this
year, compared with 50 in 1971. Asa consequence,the Over
seas Program seems to have lost touch with, and the support
of, a great portion of the Stanford community. There appear
to be a few things, however, which can be done to solve the
current problem of minimal faculty participation.
One difficulty seems to be that each program is now so
closely tied to the particular foreign community and culture
in which it operates. While this is a noble idea, and while
academically it often works well, the Overseas Program has
gone too far at times in ensuring that the academic programs
be tightly integrated within the given foreign situation. The
idea of the "focus program", designed expressly with thai
purpose in mind, has been minimally successful. Very few
students have made use of a whole program; most have taken
part in one-third or two-thirds of it, thus undermining the
purpose of the "focus program."
Many faculty seem to be discouraged from applying for a
position at an overseas campus because of a mistaken belief
that only courses specifically appropriate to the particular
foreign community may be taught at an overseas campus.
Both the Task Force and the Office of Overseas Studies
recognize that the value of courses which deal specifically
with the locale or culture in which they are taught is out
weighed by the importance of increasing Stanford faculty
participation in the Overseas Program. The Office of Overseas
Studies should make a concerted effort to inform the faculty
that a broad range of courses are acceptable to be taught
overseas.
Two other factors which have contributed to the decrease
in Stanford faculty commitment overseas are the lack of a
well-organized publicity campaign on the part of the Overseas
Program and a diminishing supply of financial resources upon
which to draw.
The first point is quite important, since in the past Stan
ford faculty members wanting to teach overseas (or simply to
learn more about the program) often had to take it upon
themselves to approach the Overseas Program. The Office of
Overseas Studies has recently initiated a substantial campaign
to promote Stanford faculty participation overseas. The Task
Force applauds this effort and encourages the Overseas Office
to continue to increase the advertisement of faculty opportu
nities overseas.
Finances have been the major factor in the reduction of
faculty quarters overseas. A greatly reduced budget leaves the
Office of Overseas Studies unable to meet the extra costs of
sending Stanford faculty to the foreign campuses. In the
planning of the Overseas budget the Provost should be made
aware of the essential value of strong faculty participation to
the Stanford Overseas Program.
There are many sound academic reasons why Stanford
faculty members should be encouraged to teach overseas. The
comparatively small size of each overseas campus affords
ready and frequent interaction between faculty members and
students. The opportunity for students to get to know fa
culty members well (both inside and outside the classroom) is
an invaluable one, both while overseas and after professors
and students have returned to the home campus. Such oppor
tunity arises repeatedly in the Overseas Studies Program, and
is reported as one of its clear advantages by students and
professors alike.
The different teaching milieu at the overseas centers en
ables faculty members to teach courses that they may have
previously been unable to teach because of a lack of either
resources or time. The rich and plentiful indigenous resources
at the disposal of the faculty member overseas, such as
galleries, museums, libraries, architecture, colleagues, etc.,
may serve as strong foundations on which to base a course
that relates directly to the local area.
Undoubtedly, then, Stanford faculty are an asset to the
Overseas Program. The Overseas Studies Office should work
even more intensively toward familiarizing Stanford faculty
and departments with the Overseas Program. This may be
accomplished through mailings, newsletters, and conferences.
If the decline in the number of faculty members going
overseas is due simply to a lack of knowledge about the
opportunities overseas by the home faculty, the aforemen
tioned publicity steps would be an effective remedy.
INTEGRATION WITH HOME DEPARTMENTS AND
CURRICULA
A result of sending fewer Stanford faculty members over
seas has been increased dependence of the program upon
foreign faculty. Certainly many outstanding foreign faculty
are teaching at the various centers; yet such an excessive
reliance upon ihum takes away from some of the uniqueness

of the program. Departments have trouble accrediting many
overseas courses towards a major because they know very
little about the course or the teacher. It must be asked
whether or not the Stanford program has become a "foreign"
university in and of itself, for it has certainly become much
more alienated from the home campus.
Better communication between the Overseas Program and
the Stanford community is essential if the great potential of
Stanford Overseas Studies is to be realized. Increased faculty
participation would help improve communication with and
increase the understanding of the community concerning the
value of the overseas centers. Greater faculty involvement
could also help bridge the gap between individual depart
ments and the campuses overseas.
Departmental accreditation has been a big problem faced
by students overseas because departments in general are more
apt to deny than to grant credit towards a major for a course
taught overseas, especially by someone not well-known aca
demically to the departmental faculty. Part of this stems
from a lack of knowledge about and involvement in the
Overseas Program on the part of departments. There is also
the uncertainty, at times, of some departments about the
quality of courses taught at the different centers. Greater
cooperation between the respective departments and the Of
fice of Overseas Studies is essential.
The Task Force was impressed with the importance of
orientation and preparation of students for the overseas ex
perience. Judging from the cases that came to its attention, it
appears that a considerable number of students have very
little knowledge of the curriculum or of special programs
offered at one or another of the overseas campuses. In some
instances they were completely ignorant of instructional re
sources before their arrival.
This is in no way due to lack of orientation programs by
the Overseas Studies Office, which devotes considerable ef
fort to provide this service. Students, however, seem to treat
this as an extracurricular or class activity with low priority,
with the consequence that some attend no sessions at all and
many only the first and least substantively academic one.
Students who attend the full three sessions, on the other
hand, find them extremely valuable. Of those who express
criticism or frustration during the course of their studies
overseas, the majority appear to be inadequately oriented to
what they will find. In addition, some students are very
strongly of the opinion that they benefited greatly by prior
development of at least some minimal personal goals they
wished to pursue in the course of their stay abroad.
Members of the Overseas Office make themselves gene
rously available to discuss with participants the feasibility of
their goals in the particular campus they wish to attend, but
few students avail themselves of this resource. They should
be encouraged to do so.
The Task Force is unanimous in its opinion that for
tverseas studies to be maximally effective requires some
measure of special and thoughtful preparation on the part of
students. This is for two reasons.
First, while the curricula have been greatly expanded in
recent years, there is obviously a much narrower range of
courses to sampl*? as one might do on the home campus.
Second, a significant part of the learning experience con
sists in knowing resources—the setting, institutions, and local
scholars—available to the student. Participants therefore
should be expected to make a certain commitment in ad
vance of departure in order to fulfill the educational aims of
the progam and his or her expectations. There should, in
other words, be some minimal degree of advance pianning
and thought about reasons for going by all students who
intend to participate.
Attendance at the formal orientation sessions provided by
the Overseas Studies Office should be made mandatory for all
applicants who are admitted, including those high on the
waiting list. As a special part of the orientation program,
students should be asked to prepare a statement indicating a
major goal of their study overseas. This may be purely
academic in nature or may involve some combination of
academic and appropriate experience.
In conclusion, the Task Force wishes to make the follow
ing observations:
We commend the Office of Overseas Studies for its new
policies of advertising and the increased publicity campaign it
has mounted. We also urge the Stanford community to sup
port the Overseas Program in its efforts to provide opportu
nities for study in third-wo rid countries, as well as in its
European centers. We wish, finally, that use of the Rechtel
iternational Center by students intending to go or returning
i om overseas be strongly encouraged. A fine resource such js

Been re/ should be used especially by returning students to
continue their international experience.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
The Task Force on Overseas Studies makes the followiryq
recommendations in the following areas:
Status of Overseas Studies within the University
1. The Overseas Studies Program should not be considered
a luxury, but an essential part of Stanford. The effect of
Overseas Studies in drawing students to the University' and
the value of an academic experience overseas for any student
lead the Task Force to conclude that the Overseas Studies
Program is an asset which the Univesity should utilize and
develop as fully as possible.
2. Studies should be made to determine the effect of the
Overseas Studies Program on enrollment at Stanford, and to
evaluate the integration of Overseas Studies into students'
curricula. Periodic studies should also be made to ascertain
the attitudes of alumni and graduating students toward their
overseas experience. Such studies may stimulate further im
provements in the Overseas Program and its advertising cam
paigns.
Faculty Participation
1. The Office of Overseas Studies should develop a com
p ehensive pamphlet explaining the purposes and opportu
nties of the Overseas Studies program. This pamphlet should
be sent to all faculty members along with an invitation to
apply to teach and/or conduct research overseas.
2. The Task Force recognizes the value of courses tailored
to each particular overseas campus. In the interest of in
creasing faculty participation in the overseas program, how
ever, a broader scope of courses should be acceptable. This is
not to say that faculty should be permitted to teach any type
of course they may wish to offer overseas, but that the policy
of accepting only courses directly relating to a particular area
or country should be less strictly applied.
Integration of Overseas Programs.
1. Overseas Studies offers the opportunity of study
abroad to every student. It is a fundamental difficulty, how
ever, for students with highly structured or sequential majors
to take even one or two quarters away from the "core"
courses and sequences offered at the home campus. There
fore, the Overseas office should impress upon advisors the
importance of informing students about the opportunities for
studies abroad early in their academic careers, and encourage
them to keep these opportunities in mind as they plan their
curricula.
2. Increased participation of Stanford faculty in the over
seas programs, and greater involvement of the appropriate
departments in selecting the overseas faculty, in establishing
the overseas curricula, and in ascertaining that academic
standards equivalent to those of the home departments are
maintained would facilitate the accrediting of courses for
student majors.
3. "Focus programs" at the overseas campuses can be
instrumental in balancing academics overseas with the cul
tural experience. The Task Force encourages the Committee
on Foreign Studies to reexamine the potential benefits and
the limitations of "focus programs."
4. Attendance at formal orientation sessions should be
required of all students admitted to the Overseas Program
and all those high on the waiting lists. Such participation
might serve to reduce misapprehensions and unrealistic ex
pectations about the programs that lead to disappointment
on the part of some students with their overseas experience.
Students should also be advised to have certain specific
academic aims in mind in choosing their time and place of
overseas study, and they should be encouraged to formulate
these aims with the assistance of timely and appropriate
faculty and staff counseling.

Last spring, in response to student concern over the
closing of the Beutelsbach campus and the threatened closure
of the Berlin program, the ASSU Senate created a Task Force
on the Place of Overseas Studies at the University. The Task
Force was instructed to "recommend to the Provost and/or
Academic Senate. . .what should be the future status of the
Overseas Program as well as any changes in funding priority
which might be necessary to realize that status."
In fulfilling its charge, the Task Force has examined the
rationale behind the Overseas Program, with respect to the
general philosophy of education at Stanford, faculty partici
pation in the Program, integration of the Overseas Studies
with academic departments and curricula, the structure and
academic quality of the programs.
RATIONALE
The Task Force recognizes three basic dimensions which
an academic experience overseas adds to a Stanford educa
tion;
First, the Overseas Program holds a wealth of opportunity
for first-hand reseach, field work, and study for faculty,
graduate students, and undergraduates alike. Such opportu
nities are an appropriate part of any university which aspires
to provide a superior education.
Second, the perspective gained in living in a different
country gives a new dimension to the student's understanding
of both his or her own culture and the newly encountered
one. Through the comparison of different cultures and value
systems, the student can better appreciate and evaluate each
one.
Third, as technology continues to shrink our world, it
becomes increasingly important for students—regardless of
their course of study or career goals— to have a clear under
standing of the realities and implications of our transnational
world. Experiencing another side of economic, political, and
cultural interdependence adds an important dimension to the
student's developing world-view.
Fourth, the Overseas Program can be an effective way of
meeting or helping to meet the goals of the Western Culture
and distribution requirements.
These added dimensions to academics and to the student's
cultural understanding and world-view are among the general
aims of any foreign studies program. Stanford students would
benefit in these ways by studying with other universities or
through exchange programs. Why, then, one might ask,
should Stanford have its own overseas program?
The Stanford Overseas Program was initially founded and
continues to operate upon the belief that all students can
benefit from an academic experience overseas.
While in most universities only students who demonstrate
a serious commitment to the study of some aspect of a given
foreign culture can expect to study overseas, the Overseas
Studies Program at Stanford offers virtually every student the
opportunity to spend a quarter or more abroad. The Office
of Admissions asserts that Overseas Studies is an important
factor for many students in their decision to apply to and/or
enroll at Stanford.
Unfortunately, no formal studies have been conducted as
yet to determine precisely the effect of Overseas Studies on
admissions. The Task Force recommends that such studies be
conducted regularly through the Office of the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies.
Nevertheless, after many interviews with students and
various university officers, the Task Force can only conclude
that the opportunity for every undergraduate to study
abroad sets Stanford apart from comparable universities and
is an important part of the "Stanford experience." Further
more, because it is unique to Stanford, the Task Force
recommends that the Overseas Studies Program receive even
more emphasis within the University and be recognized as the
tremendous academic and cultural asset that it is.
The Overseas Studies Program holds a wealth of opportu
nities as yet unexploited. The Task Force submits that fuller
utilization of these opportunities requires attention in the
following areas:
* Faculty participation,
* integration of Overseas Studies with home campus aca
demic departments and curricula,
* structuring of the programs.

purpose in mind, has been minimally successful. Very few
students have made use of a whole program; most have taken
part in one-third or two-thirds of it, thus undermining the
purpose of the "focus program."
Many faculty seem to be discouraged from applying for a
position at an overseas campus because of a mistaken belief
that only courses specifically appropriate to the particular
foreign community may be taught at an overseas campus.
Both the Task Force and the Office of Overseas Studies
recognize that the value of courses which deal specifically
with the locale or culture in which they are taught is out
weighed by the importance of increasing Stanford faculty
participation in the Overseas Program. The Office of Overseas
Studies should make a concerted effort to inform the faculty
that a broad range of courses are acceptable to be taught
overseas.
Two other factors which have contributed to the decrease
in Stanford faculty commitment overseas are the lack of a
well-organized publicity campaign on the part of the Overseas
Program and a diminishing supply of financial resources upon
which to draw.
The first point is quite important, since in the past Stan
ford faculty members wanting to teach overseas (or simply to
learn more about the program) often had to take it upon
themselves to approach the Overseas Program. The Office of
Overseas Studies has recently initiated a substantial campaign
to promote Stanford faculty participation overseas. The Task
Force applauds this effort and encourages the Overseas Office
to continue to increase the advertisement of faculty opportu
nities overseas.
Finances have been the major factor in the reduction of
faculty quarters overseas. A greatly reduced budget leaves the
Office of Overseas Studies unable to meet the extra costs of
sending Stanford faculty to the foreign campuses. In the
planning of the Overseas budget the Provost should be made
aware of the essential value of strong faculty participation to
the Stanford Overseas Program.
There are many sound academic reasons why Stanford
faculty members should be encouraged to teach overseas. The
comparatively small size of each overseas campus affords
ready and frequent interaction between faculty members and
students. The opportunity for students to get to know fa
culty members well (both inside and outside the classroom) is
an invaluable one, both while overseas and after professors
and students have returned to the home campus. Such oppor
tunity arises repeatedly in the Overseas Studies Program, and
is reported as one of its clear advantages by students and
professors alike.
The different teaching milieu at the overseas centers en
ables faculty members to teach courses that they may have
previously been unable to teach because of a lack of either
resources or time. The rich and plentiful indigenous resources
at the disposal of the faculty member overseas, such as
galleries, museums, libraries, architecture, colleagues, etc.,
may serve as strong foundations on which to base a course
that relates directly to the local area.
Undoubtedly, then, Stanford faculty are an asset to the
Overseas Program. The Overseas Studies Office should work
even more intensively toward familiarizing Stanford faculty
and departments with the Overseas Program. This may be
accomplished through mailings, newsletters, and conferences.
If the decline in the number of faculty members going
overseas is due simply to a lack of knowledge about the
opportunities overseas by the home faculty, the aforemen
tioned publicity steps would be an effective remedy.
INTEGRATION WITH HOME DEPARTMENTS AND
CURRICULA
A result of sending fewer Stanford faculty members over
seas has been increased dependence of the program upon
foreign faculty. Certainly many outstanding foreign faculty
are teaching at the various centers; yet such an excessive
reliance upon ihum takes away from some of the uniqueness

of the program. Departments have trouble accrediting many
overseas courses towards a major because they know very
little about the course or the teacher. It must be asked
whether or not the Stanford program has become a "foreign"
university in and of itself, for it has certainly become much
more alienated from the home campus.
Better communication between the Overseas Program and
the Stanford community is essential if the great potential of
Stanford Overseas Studies is to be realized. Increased faculty
participation would help improve communication with and
increase the understanding of the community concerning the
value of the overseas centers. Greater faculty involvement
could also help bridge the gap between individual depart
ments and the campuses overseas.
Departmental accreditation has been a big problem faced
by students overseas because departments in general are more
apt to deny than to grant credit towards a major for a course
taught overseas, especially by someone not well-known aca
demically to the departmental faculty. Part of this stems
from a lack of knowledge about and involvement in the
Overseas Program on the part of departments. There is also
the uncertainty, at times, of some departments about the
quality of courses taught at the different centers. Greater
cooperation between the respective departments and the Of
fice of Overseas Studies is essential.
The Task Force was impressed with the importance of
orientation and preparation of students for the overseas ex
perience. Judging from the cases that came to its attention, it
appears that a considerable number of students have very
little knowledge of the curriculum or of special programs
offered at one or another of the overseas campuses. In some
instances they were completely ignorant of instructional re
sources before their arrival.
This is in no way due to lack of orientation programs by
the Overseas Studies Office, which devotes considerable ef
fort to provide this service. Students, however, seem to treat
this as an extracurricular or class activity with low priority,
with the consequence that some attend no sessions at all and
many only the first and least substantively academic one.
Students who attend the full three sessions, on the other
hand, find them extremely valuable. Of those who express
criticism or frustration during the course of their studies
overseas, the majority appear to be inadequately oriented to
what they will find. In addition, some students are very
strongly of the opinion that they benefited greatly by prior
development of at least some minimal personal goals they
wished to pursue in the course of their stay abroad.
Members of the Overseas Office make themselves gene
rously available to discuss with participants the feasibility of
their goals in the particular campus they wish to attend, but
few students avail themselves of this resource. They should
be encouraged to do so.
The Task Force is unanimous in its opinion that for
tverseas studies to be maximally effective requires some
measure of special and thoughtful preparation on the part of
students. This is for two reasons.
First, while the curricula have been greatly expanded in
recent years, there is obviously a much narrower range of
courses to sampl*? as one might do on the home campus.
Second, a significant part of the learning experience con
sists in knowing resources—the setting, institutions, and local
scholars—available to the student. Participants therefore
should be expected to make a certain commitment in ad
vance of departure in order to fulfill the educational aims of
the progam and his or her expectations. There should, in
other words, be some minimal degree of advance pianning
and thought about reasons for going by all students who
intend to participate.
Attendance at the formal orientation sessions provided by
the Overseas Studies Office should be made mandatory for all
applicants who are admitted, including those high on the
waiting list. As a special part of the orientation program,
students should be asked to prepare a statement indicating a
major goal of their study overseas. This may be purely
academic in nature or may involve some combination of
academic and appropriate experience.
In conclusion, the Task Force wishes to make the follow
ing observations:
We commend the Office of Overseas Studies for its new
policies of advertising and the increased publicity campaign it
has mounted. We also urge the Stanford community to sup
port the Overseas Program in its efforts to provide opportu
nities for study in third-wo rid countries, as well as in its
European centers. We wish, finally, that use of the Rechtel
iternational Center by students intending to go or returning
i om overseas be strongly encouraged. A fine resource such js

Been re/ should be used especially by returning students to
continue their international experience.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
The Task Force on Overseas Studies makes the followiryq
recommendations in the following areas:
Status of Overseas Studies within the University
1. The Overseas Studies Program should not be considered
a luxury, but an essential part of Stanford. The effect of
Overseas Studies in drawing students to the University' and
the value of an academic experience overseas for any student
lead the Task Force to conclude that the Overseas Studies
Program is an asset which the Univesity should utilize and
develop as fully as possible.
2. Studies should be made to determine the effect of the
Overseas Studies Program on enrollment at Stanford, and to
evaluate the integration of Overseas Studies into students'
curricula. Periodic studies should also be made to ascertain
the attitudes of alumni and graduating students toward their
overseas experience. Such studies may stimulate further im
provements in the Overseas Program and its advertising cam
paigns.
Faculty Participation
1. The Office of Overseas Studies should develop a com
p ehensive pamphlet explaining the purposes and opportu
nties of the Overseas Studies program. This pamphlet should
be sent to all faculty members along with an invitation to
apply to teach and/or conduct research overseas.
2. The Task Force recognizes the value of courses tailored
to each particular overseas campus. In the interest of in
creasing faculty participation in the overseas program, how
ever, a broader scope of courses should be acceptable. This is
not to say that faculty should be permitted to teach any type
of course they may wish to offer overseas, but that the policy
of accepting only courses directly relating to a particular area
or country should be less strictly applied.
Integration of Overseas Programs.
1. Overseas Studies offers the opportunity of study
abroad to every student. It is a fundamental difficulty, how
ever, for students with highly structured or sequential majors
to take even one or two quarters away from the "core"
courses and sequences offered at the home campus. There
fore, the Overseas office should impress upon advisors the
importance of informing students about the opportunities for
studies abroad early in their academic careers, and encourage
them to keep these opportunities in mind as they plan their
curricula.
2. Increased participation of Stanford faculty in the over
seas programs, and greater involvement of the appropriate
departments in selecting the overseas faculty, in establishing
the overseas curricula, and in ascertaining that academic
standards equivalent to those of the home departments are
maintained would facilitate the accrediting of courses for
student majors.
3. "Focus programs" at the overseas campuses can be
instrumental in balancing academics overseas with the cul
tural experience. The Task Force encourages the Committee
on Foreign Studies to reexamine the potential benefits and
the limitations of "focus programs."
4. Attendance at formal orientation sessions should be
required of all students admitted to the Overseas Program
and all those high on the waiting lists. Such participation
might serve to reduce misapprehensions and unrealistic ex
pectations about the programs that lead to disappointment
on the part of some students with their overseas experience.
Students should also be advised to have certain specific
academic aims in mind in choosing their time and place of
overseas study, and they should be encouraged to formulate
these aims with the assistance of timely and appropriate
faculty and staff counseling.

Last spring, in response to student concern over the
closing of the Beutelsbach campus and the threatened closure
of the Berlin program, the ASSU Senate created a Task Force
on the Place of Overseas Studies at the University. The Task
Force was instructed to "recommend to the Provost and/or
Academic Senate. . .what should be the future status of the
Overseas Program as well as any changes in funding priority
which might be necessary to realize that status."
In fulfilling its charge, the Task Force has examined the
rationale behind the Overseas Program, with respect to the
general philosophy of education at Stanford, faculty partici
pation in the Program, integration of the Overseas Studies
with academic departments and curricula, the structure and
academic quality of the programs.
RATIONALE
The Task Force recognizes three basic dimensions which
an academic experience overseas adds to a Stanford educa
tion;
First, the Overseas Program holds a wealth of opportunity
for first-hand reseach, field work, and study for faculty,
graduate students, and undergraduates alike. Such opportu
nities are an appropriate part of any university which aspires
to provide a superior education.
Second, the perspective gained in living in a different
country gives a new dimension to the student's understanding
of both his or her own culture and the newly encountered
one. Through the comparison of different cultures and value
systems, the student can better appreciate and evaluate each
one.
Third, as technology continues to shrink our world, it
becomes increasingly important for students—regardless of
their course of study or career goals— to have a clear under
standing of the realities and implications of our transnational
world. Experiencing another side of economic, political, and
cultural interdependence adds an important dimension to the
student's developing world-view.
Fourth, the Overseas Program can be an effective way of
meeting or helping to meet the goals of the Western Culture
and distribution requirements.
These added dimensions to academics and to the student's
cultural understanding and world-view are among the general
aims of any foreign studies program. Stanford students would
benefit in these ways by studying with other universities or
through exchange programs. Why, then, one might ask,
should Stanford have its own overseas program?
The Stanford Overseas Program was initially founded and
continues to operate upon the belief that all students can
benefit from an academic experience overseas.
While in most universities only students who demonstrate
a serious commitment to the study of some aspect of a given
foreign culture can expect to study overseas, the Overseas
Studies Program at Stanford offers virtually every student the
opportunity to spend a quarter or more abroad. The Office
of Admissions asserts that Overseas Studies is an important
factor for many students in their decision to apply to and/or
enroll at Stanford.
Unfortunately, no formal studies have been conducted as
yet to determine precisely the effect of Overseas Studies on
admissions. The Task Force recommends that such studies be
conducted regularly through the Office of the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies.
Nevertheless, after many interviews with students and
various university officers, the Task Force can only conclude
that the opportunity for every undergraduate to study
abroad sets Stanford apart from comparable universities and
is an important part of the "Stanford experience." Further
more, because it is unique to Stanford, the Task Force
recommends that the Overseas Studies Program receive even
more emphasis within the University and be recognized as the
tremendous academic and cultural asset that it is.
The Overseas Studies Program holds a wealth of opportu
nities as yet unexploited. The Task Force submits that fuller
utilization of these opportunities requires attention in the
following areas:
* Faculty participation,
* integration of Overseas Studies with home campus aca
demic departments and curricula,
* structuring of the programs.
FACULTY PARTICIPATION
As an extension of the home campus, the Overseas Pro
gram should strive to maintain a level of academic excellence
consonant with that of the home campus. Perhaps the most
effective way of insuring high academic standards overseas is
to enlist greater participation of Stanford home faculty in
study centers abroad

In recent years the number of faculty going overseas has
dropped markedly, with 15 faculty quarters being filled this
year, compared with 50 in 1971. Asa consequence,the Over
seas Program seems to have lost touch with, and the support
of, a great portion of the Stanford community. There appear
to be a few things, however, which can be done to solve the
current problem of minimal faculty participation.
One difficulty seems to be that each program is now so
closely tied to the particular foreign community and culture
in which it operates. While this is a noble idea, and while
academically it often works well, the Overseas Program has
gone too far at times in ensuring that the academic programs
be tightly integrated within the given foreign situation. The
idea of the "focus program", designed expressly with thai
purpose in mind, has been minimally successful. Very few
students have made use of a whole program; most have taken
part in one-third or two-thirds of it, thus undermining the

themselves to approach the Overseas Program. The Office of
Overseas Studies has recently initiated a substantial campaign
to promote Stanford faculty participation overseas. The Task
Force applauds this effort and encourages the Overseas Office
to continue to increase the advertisement of faculty opportu
nities overseas.
Finances have been the major factor in the reduction of
faculty quarters overseas. A greatly reduced budget leaves the
Office of Overseas Studies unable to meet the extra costs of
sending Stanford faculty to the foreign campuses. In the
planning of the Overseas budget the Provost should be made
aware of the essential value of strong faculty participation to
the Stanford Overseas Program.
There are many sound academic reasons why Stanford
faculty members should be encouraged to teach overseas. The
comparatively small size of each overseas campus affords
ready and frequent interaction between faculty members and
students. The opportunity for students to get to know fa
culty members well (both inside and outside the classroom) is
an invaluable one, both while overseas and after professors
and students have returned to the home campus. Such oppor
tunity arises repeatedly in the Overseas Studies Program, and
is reported as one of its clear advantages by students and
professors alike.
The different teaching milieu at the overseas centers en
ables faculty members to teach courses that they may have
previously been unable to teach because of a lack of either
resources or time. The rich and plentiful indigenous resources
at the disposal of the faculty member overseas, such as
galleries, museums, libraries, architecture, colleagues, etc.,
may serve as strong foundations on which to base a course
that relates directly to the local area.
Undoubtedly, then, Stanford faculty are an asset to the
Overseas Program. The Overseas Studies Office should work
even more intensively toward familiarizing Stanford faculty
and departments with the Overseas Program. This may be
accomplished through mailings, newsletters, and conferences.
If the decline in the number of faculty members going
overseas is due simply to a lack of knowledge about the
opportunities overseas by the home faculty, the aforemen
tioned publicity steps would be an effective remedy.
INTEGRATION WITH HOME DEPARTMENTS AND
CURRICULA
A result of sending fewer Stanford faculty members over
seas has been increased dependence of the program upon
foreign faculty. Certainly many outstanding foreign faculty
are teaching at the various centers; yet such an excessive
reliance upon ihum takes away from some of the uniqueness

of the program. Departments have trouble accrediting many
overseas courses towards a major because they know very
little about the course or the teacher. It must be asked
whether or not the Stanford program has become a "foreign"
university in and of itself, for it has certainly become much
more alienated from the home campus.
Better communication between the Overseas Program and
the Stanford community is essential if the great potential of
Stanford Overseas Studies is to be realized. Increased faculty
participation would help improve communication with and
increase the understanding of the community concerning the
value of the overseas centers. Greater faculty involvement
could also help bridge the gap between individual depart
ments and the campuses overseas.
Departmental accreditation has been a big problem faced
by students overseas because departments in general are more
apt to deny than to grant credit towards a major for a course
taught overseas, especially by someone not well-known aca
demically to the departmental faculty. Part of this stems
from a lack of knowledge about and involvement in the
Overseas Program on the part of departments. There is also
the uncertainty, at times, of some departments about the
quality of courses taught at the different centers. Greater
cooperation between the respective departments and the Of
fice of Overseas Studies is essential.
The Task Force was impressed with the importance of
orientation and preparation of students for the overseas ex
perience. Judging from the cases that came to its attention, it
appears that a considerable number of students have very
little knowledge of the curriculum or of special programs
offered at one or another of the overseas campuses. In some
instances they were completely ignorant of instructional re
sources before their arrival.
This is in no way due to lack of orientation programs by
the Overseas Studies Office, which devotes considerable ef
fort to provide this service. Students, however, seem to treat
this as an extracurricular or class activity with low priority,
with the consequence that some attend no sessions at all and
many only the first and least substantively academic one.
Students who attend the full three sessions, on the other
hand, find them extremely valuable. Of those who express
criticism or frustration during the course of their studies
overseas, the majority appear to be inadequately oriented to
what they will find. In addition, some students are very
strongly of the opinion that they benefited greatly by prior
development of at least some minimal personal goals they
wished to pursue in the course of their stay abroad.
Members of the Overseas Office make themselves gene
rously available to discuss with participants the feasibility of
their goals in the particular campus they wish to attend, but
few students avail themselves of this resource. They should
be encouraged to do so.
The Task Force is unanimous in its opinion that for
tverseas studies to be maximally effective requires some
measure of special and thoughtful preparation on the part of
students. This is for two reasons.
First, while the curricula have been greatly expanded in
recent years, there is obviously a much narrower range of
courses to sampl*? as one might do on the home campus.
Second, a significant part of the learning experience con
sists in knowing resources—the setting, institutions, and local
scholars—available to the student. Participants therefore
should be expected to make a certain commitment in ad
vance of departure in order to fulfill the educational aims of
the progam and his or her expectations. There should, in
other words, be some minimal degree of advance pianning
and thought about reasons for going by all students who
intend to participate.
Attendance at the formal orientation sessions provided by
the Overseas Studies Office should be made mandatory for all
applicants who are admitted, including those high on the
waiting list. As a special part of the orientation program,
students should be asked to prepare a statement indicating a
major goal of their study overseas. This may be purely
academic in nature or may involve some combination of
academic and appropriate experience.
In conclusion, the Task Force wishes to make the follow
ing observations:
We commend the Office of Overseas Studies for its new
policies of advertising and the increased publicity campaign it
has mounted. We also urge the Stanford community to sup
port the Overseas Program in its efforts to provide opportu
nities for study in third-wo rid countries, as well as in its
European centers. We wish, finally, that use of the Rechtel
iternational Center by students intending to go or returning
i om overseas be strongly encouraged. A fine resource such js

Been re/ should be used especially by returning students to
continue their international experience.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
The Task Force on Overseas Studies makes the followiryq
recommendations in the following areas:
Status of Overseas Studies within the University
1. The Overseas Studies Program should not be considered
a luxury, but an essential part of Stanford. The effect of
Overseas Studies in drawing students to the University' and
the value of an academic experience overseas for any student
lead the Task Force to conclude that the Overseas Studies
Program is an asset which the Univesity should utilize and
develop as fully as possible.
2. Studies should be made to determine the effect of the
Overseas Studies Program on enrollment at Stanford, and to
evaluate the integration of Overseas Studies into students'
curricula. Periodic studies should also be made to ascertain
the attitudes of alumni and graduating students toward their
overseas experience. Such studies may stimulate further im
provements in the Overseas Program and its advertising cam
paigns.
Faculty Participation
1. The Office of Overseas Studies should develop a com
p ehensive pamphlet explaining the purposes and opportu
nties of the Overseas Studies program. This pamphlet should
be sent to all faculty members along with an invitation to
apply to teach and/or conduct research overseas.
2. The Task Force recognizes the value of courses tailored
to each particular overseas campus. In the interest of in
creasing faculty participation in the overseas program, how
ever, a broader scope of courses should be acceptable. This is
not to say that faculty should be permitted to teach any type
of course they may wish to offer overseas, but that the policy
of accepting only courses directly relating to a particular area
or country should be less strictly applied.
Integration of Overseas Programs.
1. Overseas Studies offers the opportunity of study
abroad to every student. It is a fundamental difficulty, how
ever, for students with highly structured or sequential majors
to take even one or two quarters away from the "core"
courses and sequences offered at the home campus. There
fore, the Overseas office should impress upon advisors the
importance of informing students about the opportunities for
studies abroad early in their academic careers, and encourage
them to keep these opportunities in mind as they plan their
curricula.
2. Increased participation of Stanford faculty in the over
seas programs, and greater involvement of the appropriate
departments in selecting the overseas faculty, in establishing
the overseas curricula, and in ascertaining that academic
standards equivalent to those of the home departments are
maintained would facilitate the accrediting of courses for
student majors.
3. "Focus programs" at the overseas campuses can be
instrumental in balancing academics overseas with the cul
tural experience. The Task Force encourages the Committee
on Foreign Studies to reexamine the potential benefits and
the limitations of "focus programs."
4. Attendance at formal orientation sessions should be
required of all students admitted to the Overseas Program
and all those high on the waiting lists. Such participation
might serve to reduce misapprehensions and unrealistic ex
pectations about the programs that lead to disappointment
on the part of some students with their overseas experience.
Students should also be advised to have certain specific
academic aims in mind in choosing their time and place of
overseas study, and they should be encouraged to formulate
these aims with the assistance of timely and appropriate
faculty and staff counseling.

Last spring, in response to student concern over the
closing of the Beutelsbach campus and the threatened closure
of the Berlin program, the ASSU Senate created a Task Force
on the Place of Overseas Studies at the University. The Task
Force was instructed to "recommend to the Provost and/or
Academic Senate. . .what should be the future status of the
Overseas Program as well as any changes in funding priority
which might be necessary to realize that status."
In fulfilling its charge, the Task Force has examined the
rationale behind the Overseas Program, with respect to the
general philosophy of education at Stanford, faculty partici
pation in the Program, integration of the Overseas Studies
with academic departments and curricula, the structure and
academic quality of the programs.
RATIONALE
The Task Force recognizes three basic dimensions which
an academic experience overseas adds to a Stanford educa
tion;
First, the Overseas Program holds a wealth of opportunity
for first-hand reseach, field work, and study for faculty,
graduate students, and undergraduates alike. Such opportu
nities are an appropriate part of any university which aspires
to provide a superior education.
Second, the perspective gained in living in a different
country gives a new dimension to the student's understanding
of both his or her own culture and the newly encountered
one. Through the comparison of different cultures and value
systems, the student can better appreciate and evaluate each
one.
Third, as technology continues to shrink our world, it
becomes increasingly important for students—regardless of
their course of study or career goals— to have a clear under
standing of the realities and implications of our transnational
world. Experiencing another side of economic, political, and
cultural interdependence adds an important dimension to the
student's developing world-view.
Fourth, the Overseas Program can be an effective way of
meeting or helping to meet the goals of the Western Culture
and distribution requirements.
These added dimensions to academics and to the student's
cultural understanding and world-view are among the general
aims of any foreign studies program. Stanford students would
benefit in these ways by studying with other universities or
through exchange programs. Why, then, one might ask,
should Stanford have its own overseas program?
The Stanford Overseas Program was initially founded and
continues to operate upon the belief that all students can
benefit from an academic experience overseas.
While in most universities only students who demonstrate
a serious commitment to the study of some aspect of a given
foreign culture can expect to study overseas, the Overseas
Studies Program at Stanford offers virtually every student the
opportunity to spend a quarter or more abroad. The Office
of Admissions asserts that Overseas Studies is an important
factor for many students in their decision to apply to and/or
enroll at Stanford.
Unfortunately, no formal studies have been conducted as
yet to determine precisely the effect of Overseas Studies on
admissions. The Task Force recommends that such studies be
conducted regularly through the Office of the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies.
Nevertheless, after many interviews with students and
various university officers, the Task Force can only conclude
that the opportunity for every undergraduate to study
abroad sets Stanford apart from comparable universities and
is an important part of the "Stanford experience." Further
more, because it is unique to Stanford, the Task Force
recommends that the Overseas Studies Program receive even
more emphasis within the University and be recognized as the
tremendous academic and cultural asset that it is.
The Overseas Studies Program holds a wealth of opportu
nities as yet unexploited. The Task Force submits that fuller
utilization of these opportunities requires attention in the
following areas:
* Faculty participation,
* integration of Overseas Studies with home campus aca
demic departments and curricula,
* structuring of the programs.
FACULTY PARTICIPATION
As an extension of the home campus, the Overseas Pro
gram should strive to maintain a level of academic excellence
consonant with that of the home campus. Perhaps the most
effective way of insuring high academic standards overseas is
to enlist greater participation of Stanford home faculty in
study centers abroad

In recent years the number of faculty going overseas has
dropped markedly, with 15 faculty quarters being filled this
year, compared with 50 in 1971. Asa consequence,the Over
seas Program seems to have lost touch with, and the support
of, a great portion of the Stanford community. There appear
to be a few things, however, which can be done to solve the
current problem of minimal faculty participation.
One difficulty seems to be that each program is now so
closely tied to the particular foreign community and culture
in which it operates. While this is a noble idea, and while
academically it often works well, the Overseas Program has
gone too far at times in ensuring that the academic programs
be tightly integrated within the given foreign situation. The
idea of the "focus program", designed expressly with thai
purpose in mind, has been minimally successful. Very few
students have made use of a whole program; most have taken
part in one-third or two-thirds of it, thus undermining the
purpose of the "focus program."
Many faculty seem to be discouraged from applying for a
position at an overseas campus because of a mistaken belief
that only courses specifically appropriate to the particular
foreign community may be taught at an overseas campus.
Both the Task Force and the Office of Overseas Studies
recognize that the value of courses which deal specifically
with the locale or culture in which they are taught is out
weighed by the importance of increasing Stanford faculty
participation in the Overseas Program. The Office of Overseas
Studies should make a concerted effort to inform the faculty
that a broad range of courses are acceptable to be taught
overseas.
Two other factors which have contributed to the decrease
in Stanford faculty commitment overseas are the lack of a
well-organized publicity campaign on the part of the Overseas
Program and a diminishing supply of financial resources upon
which to draw.
The first point is quite important, since in the past Stan
ford faculty members wanting to teach overseas (or simply to
learn more about the program) often had to take it upon
themselves to approach the Overseas Program. The Office of
Overseas Studies has recently initiated a substantial campaign

ables faculty members to teach courses that they may have
previously been unable to teach because of a lack of either
resources or time. The rich and plentiful indigenous resources
at the disposal of the faculty member overseas, such as
galleries, museums, libraries, architecture, colleagues, etc.,
may serve as strong foundations on which to base a course
that relates directly to the local area.
Undoubtedly, then, Stanford faculty are an asset to the
Overseas Program. The Overseas Studies Office should work
even more intensively toward familiarizing Stanford faculty
and departments with the Overseas Program. This may be
accomplished through mailings, newsletters, and conferences.
If the decline in the number of faculty members going
overseas is due simply to a lack of knowledge about the
opportunities overseas by the home faculty, the aforemen
tioned publicity steps would be an effective remedy.
INTEGRATION WITH HOME DEPARTMENTS AND
CURRICULA
A result of sending fewer Stanford faculty members over
seas has been increased dependence of the program upon
foreign faculty. Certainly many outstanding foreign faculty
are teaching at the various centers; yet such an excessive
reliance upon ihum takes away from some of the uniqueness

of the program. Departments have trouble accrediting many
overseas courses towards a major because they know very
little about the course or the teacher. It must be asked
whether or not the Stanford program has become a "foreign"
university in and of itself, for it has certainly become much
more alienated from the home campus.
Better communication between the Overseas Program and
the Stanford community is essential if the great potential of
Stanford Overseas Studies is to be realized. Increased faculty
participation would help improve communication with and
increase the understanding of the community concerning the
value of the overseas centers. Greater faculty involvement
could also help bridge the gap between individual depart
ments and the campuses overseas.
Departmental accreditation has been a big problem faced
by students overseas because departments in general are more
apt to deny than to grant credit towards a major for a course
taught overseas, especially by someone not well-known aca
demically to the departmental faculty. Part of this stems
from a lack of knowledge about and involvement in the
Overseas Program on the part of departments. There is also
the uncertainty, at times, of some departments about the
quality of courses taught at the different centers. Greater
cooperation between the respective departments and the Of
fice of Overseas Studies is essential.
The Task Force was impressed with the importance of
orientation and preparation of students for the overseas ex
perience. Judging from the cases that came to its attention, it
appears that a considerable number of students have very
little knowledge of the curriculum or of special programs
offered at one or another of the overseas campuses. In some
instances they were completely ignorant of instructional re
sources before their arrival.
This is in no way due to lack of orientation programs by
the Overseas Studies Office, which devotes considerable ef
fort to provide this service. Students, however, seem to treat
this as an extracurricular or class activity with low priority,
with the consequence that some attend no sessions at all and
many only the first and least substantively academic one.
Students who attend the full three sessions, on the other
hand, find them extremely valuable. Of those who express
criticism or frustration during the course of their studies
overseas, the majority appear to be inadequately oriented to
what they will find. In addition, some students are very
strongly of the opinion that they benefited greatly by prior
development of at least some minimal personal goals they
wished to pursue in the course of their stay abroad.
Members of the Overseas Office make themselves gene
rously available to discuss with participants the feasibility of
their goals in the particular campus they wish to attend, but
few students avail themselves of this resource. They should
be encouraged to do so.
The Task Force is unanimous in its opinion that for
tverseas studies to be maximally effective requires some
measure of special and thoughtful preparation on the part of
students. This is for two reasons.
First, while the curricula have been greatly expanded in
recent years, there is obviously a much narrower range of
courses to sampl*? as one might do on the home campus.
Second, a significant part of the learning experience con
sists in knowing resources—the setting, institutions, and local
scholars—available to the student. Participants therefore
should be expected to make a certain commitment in ad
vance of departure in order to fulfill the educational aims of
the progam and his or her expectations. There should, in
other words, be some minimal degree of advance pianning
and thought about reasons for going by all students who
intend to participate.
Attendance at the formal orientation sessions provided by
the Overseas Studies Office should be made mandatory for all
applicants who are admitted, including those high on the
waiting list. As a special part of the orientation program,
students should be asked to prepare a statement indicating a
major goal of their study overseas. This may be purely
academic in nature or may involve some combination of
academic and appropriate experience.
In conclusion, the Task Force wishes to make the follow
ing observations:
We commend the Office of Overseas Studies for its new
policies of advertising and the increased publicity campaign it
has mounted. We also urge the Stanford community to sup
port the Overseas Program in its efforts to provide opportu
nities for study in third-wo rid countries, as well as in its
European centers. We wish, finally, that use of the Rechtel
iternational Center by students intending to go or returning
i om overseas be strongly encouraged. A fine resource such js

Been re/ should be used especially by returning students to
continue their international experience.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
The Task Force on Overseas Studies makes the followiryq
recommendations in the following areas:
Status of Overseas Studies within the University
1. The Overseas Studies Program should not be considered
a luxury, but an essential part of Stanford. The effect of
Overseas Studies in drawing students to the University' and
the value of an academic experience overseas for any student
lead the Task Force to conclude that the Overseas Studies
Program is an asset which the Univesity should utilize and
develop as fully as possible.
2. Studies should be made to determine the effect of the
Overseas Studies Program on enrollment at Stanford, and to
evaluate the integration of Overseas Studies into students'
curricula. Periodic studies should also be made to ascertain
the attitudes of alumni and graduating students toward their
overseas experience. Such studies may stimulate further im
provements in the Overseas Program and its advertising cam
paigns.
Faculty Participation
1. The Office of Overseas Studies should develop a com
p ehensive pamphlet explaining the purposes and opportu
nties of the Overseas Studies program. This pamphlet should
be sent to all faculty members along with an invitation to
apply to teach and/or conduct research overseas.
2. The Task Force recognizes the value of courses tailored
to each particular overseas campus. In the interest of in
creasing faculty participation in the overseas program, how
ever, a broader scope of courses should be acceptable. This is
not to say that faculty should be permitted to teach any type
of course they may wish to offer overseas, but that the policy
of accepting only courses directly relating to a particular area
or country should be less strictly applied.
Integration of Overseas Programs.
1. Overseas Studies offers the opportunity of study
abroad to every student. It is a fundamental difficulty, how
ever, for students with highly structured or sequential majors
to take even one or two quarters away from the "core"
courses and sequences offered at the home campus. There
fore, the Overseas office should impress upon advisors the
importance of informing students about the opportunities for
studies abroad early in their academic careers, and encourage
them to keep these opportunities in mind as they plan their
curricula.
2. Increased participation of Stanford faculty in the over
seas programs, and greater involvement of the appropriate
departments in selecting the overseas faculty, in establishing
the overseas curricula, and in ascertaining that academic
standards equivalent to those of the home departments are
maintained would facilitate the accrediting of courses for
student majors.
3. "Focus programs" at the overseas campuses can be
instrumental in balancing academics overseas with the cul
tural experience. The Task Force encourages the Committee
on Foreign Studies to reexamine the potential benefits and
the limitations of "focus programs."
4. Attendance at formal orientation sessions should be
required of all students admitted to the Overseas Program
and all those high on the waiting lists. Such participation
might serve to reduce misapprehensions and unrealistic ex
pectations about the programs that lead to disappointment
on the part of some students with their overseas experience.
Students should also be advised to have certain specific
academic aims in mind in choosing their time and place of
overseas study, and they should be encouraged to formulate
these aims with the assistance of timely and appropriate
faculty and staff counseling.
