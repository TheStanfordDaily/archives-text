# Hospital halts double billing for emergency room care
## 
### Andrea James 
The emergency room at the Hospi
tal has temporarily stopped sending
out bills for professional services
until it has reviewed policies regard
ing billing procedures and con
firmed their legality, the Daily
learned yesterday.
Dr. Michael Eliastam, director of
emergency services at the Hospital,
said yesterday that in response to
claims of alleged illegal double bil
ling procedures, the emergency
room has stopped billing for profes
sional services until it has made sure
that the Hospital's current billing
practice conforms to legal standards.
Eliastam added that hospital bills
for the use of the Hospital facilities
are still being mailed out.
Mailings stopped
Mailings of bills involving profes
sional services stopped about two
weeks ago and Eliastam said he
hopes billing can resume in another
two weeks.
The claims which Eliastam referred
to were made last year by Dr. Eugene
Dong, associate professor of car
diovascular surgery at the Medical
Center, and Dr. Robert Weinmann,
president of the Union of American
Physicians (UAP), Local 7402.
Section 2008 of the California Bus
iness Code states, in part, that medi
cal schools and institutions may
make "no charge for professional
services rendered patients."
Dong and the union claim the
Hospital violates this section be
cause it bills patients twice for ser
vices rendered by interns and resi
dents. Supervising physicians al
legedly bill patients when all the
work has been performed by interns
and residents, whose services are
covered in the Hospital's basic rates.
These claims are currently being
investigated by the Board of Medical
Quality Assurance, the state Senate

Business and Professions Committee
and the state Attorney General's Of
fice.
'In-house evaluation'
"This is strictly an in-house evalua
tion ," Eliastam said ot the emergency
room's review.
He added that persons involved in
the evaluation include "myself, ad
ministration and the (Medical
School) Dean's office."
"As director of the emergency ser
vices, I decided to reevaluate the bil
ling procedures currently in use,"
Eliastam said.
He added that if it is discovered the
practices do not conform to legal
standards, "we will change our
methods so they do conform."
Weinmann has estimated that the
Hospital has already collected
thousands of unwarranted patient
dollars in this double billing proce
dure. Eliastam said he did not know
what would be done with the money
previously collected under these cir
cumstances if the billing procedure
is found to be illegal.
Lawyers unavailable
John Schwartz, University coun

sel, was out of town yesterday and
unavailable for comment.
Carl Hitchner, associate staff
counsel for the Medical Center legal
department, was also unavailable for
comment.
"Things are finally starting to
move," Dong told the Daily.
The UAP, too, seemed pleased
with the emergency room's action.
"This is a stunning victory. The
hospital has virtually capitulated,"
Weinmann said.
Medicare memo
Meanwhile, in a memorandum
dated )an. 24 and sent to all faculty
and clinical departments, Dr. Lawr
ence Crowley, deputy dean and chief
of staff at the Hospital,,issued a "re
minder of the level of care which the
faculty physicians are to render to
Medicare and Medi-Cal patients in
order to meet the requirements for
billing under those governmental
programs."
The memo also advised faculty of
"a recent change Medicare has an
nounced concerning the amount of
documentation which must be
shown in the patient's record" to jus
tify governmental payment.
Crowley said the memo represents
a "periodic review of the billing situ
ation."
He added that the memo had also
been issued because certain ques
tions regarding the hospital's billing
procedures involving Medicare and
Medi-Cal had been raised.
Last month in a San Jose press con
ference, Weinmann accused the
Hospital of billing Medicare twice for
services rendered.
He said at that time that he had
documentation to prove the Univer
sity had done this in at least two in
stances.
The requirements for billing for
services "are not different from the
requirements which have been in
existence in past years," the memo
states.

However, documentation proving
an attending physician's participa
tion in rendering patient care has
changed.
According to the memo, counter
signatures indicating the physician's
participation is no longer sufficient
evidence for Medicare payment.
The new documentation, states
the memo, must include a note in the
patient's record written by the at
tending physician. If the note is writ
ten by the resident or intern, the at
tending physician must add to or de
lete the note and sign it, or he must
write "Examined and concur" and
sign it.
If this documentation is not pre
sent, Medicare cannot be billed for
services rendered by the attending
physician.
According to the memo these
documentation requirements be
came effective Feb. 15.

Weinmann has estimated that the
Hospital has already collected
thousands of unwarranted patient

is found to be illegal.

Medicare memo
Meanwhile, in a memorandum
dated )an. 24 and sent to all faculty
and clinical departments, Dr. Lawr
ence Crowley, deputy dean and chief
of staff at the Hospital,,issued a "re
minder of the level of care which the
faculty physicians are to render to
Medicare and Medi-Cal patients in
order to meet the requirements for
billing under those governmental
programs."
The memo also advised faculty of
"a recent change Medicare has an
nounced concerning the amount of
documentation which must be
shown in the patient's record" to jus
tify governmental payment.
Crowley said the memo represents
a "periodic review of the billing situ
ation."
He added that the memo had also
been issued because certain ques
tions regarding the hospital's billing
procedures involving Medicare and
Medi-Cal had been raised.
Last month in a San Jose press con
ference, Weinmann accused the
Hospital of billing Medicare twice for
services rendered.
He said at that time that he had
documentation to prove the Univer
sity had done this in at least two in
stances.
The requirements for billing for
services "are not different from the
requirements which have been in
existence in past years," the memo
states.

However, documentation proving
an attending physician's participa
tion in rendering patient care has
changed.
According to the memo, counter
signatures indicating the physician's
participation is no longer sufficient
evidence for Medicare payment.
The new documentation, states
the memo, must include a note in the
patient's record written by the at
tending physician. If the note is writ
ten by the resident or intern, the at
tending physician must add to or de
lete the note and sign it, or he must
write "Examined and concur" and
sign it.
If this documentation is not pre
sent, Medicare cannot be billed for
services rendered by the attending
physician.
According to the memo these
documentation requirements be
came effective Feb. 15.
The emergency room at the Hospi
tal has temporarily stopped sending
out bills for professional services
until it has reviewed policies regard
ing billing procedures and con
firmed their legality, the Daily
learned yesterday.
Dr. Michael Eliastam, director of
emergency services at the Hospital,
said yesterday that in response to
claims of alleged illegal double bil
ling procedures, the emergency
room has stopped billing for profes
sional services until it has made sure
that the Hospital's current billing
practice conforms to legal standards.
Eliastam added that hospital bills
for the use of the Hospital facilities
are still being mailed out.
Mailings stopped
Mailings of bills involving profes
sional services stopped about two
weeks ago and Eliastam said he
hopes billing can resume in another
two weeks.
The claims which Eliastam referred
to were made last year by Dr. Eugene
Dong, associate professor of car
diovascular surgery at the Medical
Center, and Dr. Robert Weinmann,
president of the Union of American
Physicians (UAP), Local 7402.
Section 2008 of the California Bus
iness Code states, in part, that medi
cal schools and institutions may
make "no charge for professional
services rendered patients."
Dong and the union claim the
Hospital violates this section be
cause it bills patients twice for ser
vices rendered by interns and resi
dents. Supervising physicians al
legedly bill patients when all the
work has been performed by interns
and residents, whose services are
covered in the Hospital's basic rates.
These claims are currently being
investigated by the Board of Medical
Quality Assurance, the state Senate

Business and Professions Committee
and the state Attorney General's Of
fice.
'In-house evaluation'
"This is strictly an in-house evalua
tion ," Eliastam said ot the emergency
room's review.
He added that persons involved in
the evaluation include "myself, ad
ministration and the (Medical
School) Dean's office."
"As director of the emergency ser
vices, I decided to reevaluate the bil
ling procedures currently in use,"
Eliastam said.
He added that if it is discovered the
practices do not conform to legal
standards, "we will change our
methods so they do conform."
