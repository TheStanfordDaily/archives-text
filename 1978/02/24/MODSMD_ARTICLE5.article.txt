# Governors support Carter on coal strike
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Governors of
three coal-producing states said yes
terday only industry capitulation to
the United Mine Workers' (UMW)
bottom-line contract terms can avert
presidential intervention in the coal
strike by this weekend.
West Virginia Gov. lay Rockefeller,
declaring his "absolute conviction"
that President Jimmy Carter will in
tervene soon, said the only other way
to end the 80-day-old strike is for the
industry to accept a tentative con
tract already negotiated between the
union and a major independent
operator.
The statement came only hours
after Carter told reporters he had de
cided to forego immediate interven
tion because "we're still trying to get
the parties to negotiate with each
other." _ \
Rockefeller, Pennsylvania Gov.
Milton Shapp and Kentucky Gov. Ju
lian Carroll issued a statement sup
porting strong action by Carter.
Carroll appeared to be laying the
groundwork for an administration
decision to terminate industry-wide
bargaining. He said the talks are
"near impasse" and added: "It's
time for the operators to understand
the negotiations essentially are

over."
The statement, made shortly after
the three met with Carter, appeared
to be part of the administration's ef
fort to maneuver the industry into
accepting the terms of the settlement
between the UMW and Pittsburg and
Midway Coal Mining Co., a Denver
based independent. The union has
said it will accept nothing less than
that contract; the operators have re
fused to consider it as a model.
Power cutbacks resulting from the
coal strike were blamed for one-day
layoffs of 8300 hourly workers at
General Motors' Delco Electronics
plant in Kokomo, Ind.
Elsewhere, more power cutbacks
were expected in Indiana, Ohio,
Tennessee, Maryland and Virginia.
Legislative solutions which have
been frequently mentioned are a
federal seizure of the mines and the
imposition of binding arbitration on
both parties. There has also been talk
of Carter asking the courts to invoke
the Taft-Hartley Act, which would
order the miners back to work.
An Associated Press-NBC News
poll found that nearly two-thirds of
the American people think Carter
should try to reopen the mines
through Taft-Hartley.
