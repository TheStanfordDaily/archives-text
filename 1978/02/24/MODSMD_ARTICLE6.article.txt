Hillier said.
Hillier said the commission is wil

At the first CIR meeting, held Feb.
15, Hillier stated his commitment to
give each person an equal voice in
the deliberations and recommenda
tions of the commission.
"I am impressed with Hillier. He

thecommission," said Lee Goldman,
student CIR member.
Hillier also emphasized that the
CIR "is very much on trial and needs
to gain the respect of the Stanford
community."
He further stressed that the CIR
will make its recommendations to
the Board of Trustees under the
guidelines of the "Trustee Statement
on Investment Responsibility."
The South African proxy questions
will be coming up for Trustee's con

"Our goal is to have our report

commendations to the Board by their
April 11 meeting," Hillier said.
