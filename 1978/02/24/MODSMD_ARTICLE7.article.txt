# Students should partake
## Technology must fit tasks 
###

Appropriate Technology (AT) is
the philosophy of fitting technology
to the task you want done. The
technology should be appropriate
not only to what the task is, but ap
propriate to the environment we live
in — it must be ecological. AT can be
applied to three major areas: energy,
agriculture, and industry, and I
would like to describe some of the
proposed techniques and what im
provements they would result in for
the world.
In the area of energy, currently
used technologies have major draw
backs in that they are largely based
on dwindling resources, which
causes their price to rise. Tiiey are
done on a large, centralized scale re
sulting in high distribution costs and
wastage; they are polluting.
Varied sources
AT energy sources include solar in
all its forms (collectors, steam gener
ation, passive solar design of build
ings, photoelectric cells) and wind
energy, conservation and insulation,
pedal power, conversion of organic
wastes to methane, ocean-thermal,
hydropower, geothermal, cogenera
tlon of industrial waste heat, trash
combustion, and recycling.
Solar energy is now a proven
technology, with payback times on
the investment of five to ten years in
sunnier areas. The other
technologies are proven too, they
just await implementation.
In the area of agriculture, our pre
sent methods have many disadvan
tages: Processing of foods takes a lot
of energy, and adds certain artificial
chemicals which have been shown to
have adverse effects on health.
Our heavy use of pesticides is
futile. Pests develop resistance, re
quiring more added pesticide, and
useful insects are killed in the pro
cess; it is unnecessary, for much
usage is cosmetic, and the small in
crease in yields which pesticide use
allows could be accomplished by
safer means.
Cut back pesticides
It is dangerous — especially to the
farmer who uses them, but also to
the consumer who eats them. The
use of synthetic fertilizers also takes
a lot of energy, requires increasing
amounts, destroys -the soil, pollutes
the water, and may be harmful to the
ozone layer. And the overreliance of
agribusiness on meat takes up land
that could be farmed to help ease the
food shortage.

AT, or organic agricultural
methods, are exemplified by the
breakthrough technology called
Biodynamic-French Intensive (BFI)
gardening. This increases yields by
two to thirty times through digging
the soil two feet deep so crops may
be planted as close together as pos
sible — the overlapping leaves pre
vent the growth of weeds and keep
moisture in the soil, compost is used
instead of synthetic fertilizer, and no
pesticides are used except for pre
datory insects.
AT agriculture would also ban the
unnecessary and dangerous addi
tives, would reduce over
processing, to improve nutrition,
and would encourage the aquacul
ture of fish over the production of
beef, pork, and poultry.
Balance needed
In the area of industry, the present
drawbacks include polluting
technologies, and the subordination
of human needs to the maximization
of profits for the executives.
Some human needs which AT in
dustry would seek to provide are:
inexpensive, small housing units,
clean, efficient transportation,
ecological or educational entertain
ment, and accessible health care
(especially preventive medicine). AT
industries might also want to try shar
ing of profits and decision-making
among employees.
Beyond the health-related im
provements I've mentioned here, an
AT revolution would have psycholog
ical benefits — a cleaner environ
ment with more open space would
be uplifting to the psyche and pro
vide recreation.
Many of the problems of city
people might be traced to the depre
ssing, cramped atmosphere there. A
gradual introduction of AT practices
would provide more jobs, because it
is less capital-intensive, and we need
true full employment to help solve
the problems of poverty, crime, and
mental illness.
Supply example
If the U.S. would provide an
example of AT practices, and help
other countries try them, develop
ment of the desperately poor coun
tries could at last become a reality.
AT, through starting a stable
economic base, would make popula
tion control more likely through
making peoples' lives more secure.
And the improved psychological cli
mate would mean we could at last
reduce military spending.
Any objections people might have
to AT would be largely based on the

disruption of the economy which
would come with any change — but
this could be minimized if the AT re
volution were fairly gradual, and the
implementation of AT methods
would not require extensive retrain
ing, as the methods are so simple. At
any rate, the advantages should far
outweigh the disadvantages.
Begin study
Students and faculty might wish to
begin to study some of these ideas —
not necessarily to change their
careers but to know about these
ideas should they start to be im
plemented. The applications for
those majoring or working irr the sci
ences, engineering, political sci
ence, psychology, economics, and
social sciences should be fairly clear.
Those in art, music, and English
might wish to express creatively the
disadvantages of our present state
and the advantages of an AT world.
History people could look for histor
ical roots of our problems and solu
tions, and language people could
make AT literature available to coun
tries around the world.
