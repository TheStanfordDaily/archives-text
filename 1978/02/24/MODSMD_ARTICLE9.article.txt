# Advertising by physicians is legitimate
##

Recently two opinions were pub
lished in the Daily, both expounding
the adversities of medical advertis
ing, and both written by medical stu
dents. Sartoris, Feb. 3, and Aglito,
Feb. 8, Daily. I must say they both
brought lumps to my throat — lumps
of involuntary regurgitation. Both
opinions were so tinged with future
self-interest and concern for per
petuating the stereotyped image of
most present day doctors that the
critical ailment of medicine today, if
indeed one thinks an ailment exists,
was utterly glossed over and left
hanging incompletely in mid-air.
To say that one of the dangers of
medical advertising lies in the misuse
that would "demean" the dignity of
the patient is pure bullshit. It is an
insult and injustice to the many con
scientous, qualified doctors that I
know exist.
The only thing that can demean a
patient or doctor in a patient-doctor
relationship is the doctor. Space
here certainly limits enumerating
the reasons for such demeaning

One reason might be lack of know
ledge on both sides, the doctor's as
well as the patient's. Another might
be lack of money on the patients'
part resulting in a demeaning like
atmosphere where one is subjected
to large impersonal clinics.
I refer to private clinics as well as
institutional ones. I call this the
"stockyard" syndrome. Private or
not, clinics tend to give one a de
meaning "handout" feeling. All this
without advertising.
Both articles inferred that through
advertising "quacks" would come
out of hiding. I thought that there
were governing groups in the medi
cal profession whose specific re
sponsibility it was to weed out these
licensed charlatans. Are these so
called "governing boards" not doing
their job? If not, why not? If they are
doing what they are morally bound
to do, then there should be none of
these "quacks" around to prey on
us, Advertising or not.
Set apart
Also the words "ivory tower" were
used to imply that there exists among
the medical profession a certain lof
tiness which, when coupled with
medical knowledge, produce a cer
tain attitude and demeanor that sets
doctors apart from the person on the
street.
I would be the first to admit this is
due to the fact that the intelligence
and character of "us masses" from
whom doctors get their not too
shabby income, are considerably
lower than those privileged few who
get to go to medical school. But can
the two students deny that over the
years, the medical schools and the
profession itself have failed misera
bly in attempting to wipe out this
gap, so that patients continue to
come away with a feeling of mystique
when dealing with most doctors?
Instead of agonizing over the ad
versities as opposed to the efficacies
of physician advertising the
medical profession would be wise to
seek answers instead as to why they

are fast losing esteem in the eyes of
the "masses."
To the two medical students I re
ferred to earlier I would say: make no
mistake as to this loss of respect and
confidence. It is there and growing
everyday. It is partly due maybe to
frustrated would-be doctors who
could not and cannot make the
grade. It is partly due to disgruntled
patients and relatives turning in their
frustration to less conventional types
of cures and treatments such as
"faith and psychic" healers.
It is partly due to those who are
qualified, or not, for counseling in
what has been heretofore ignored by
doctors. Subjects such as sex, old
age, and death to name a few. But
mostly it is the fault of medical

schools in failing to instill in students
the correct and only values you
should place on wanting to be doc
tors.
I am not so naive as to charge that
medical schools be 100 per cent ef
fective in this last statement. I can
only hope they make a greater effort
in this direction before turning stu
dents loose.
I judge people in every profession
(not just doctors) and every walk of
life by the adage: "If you walk, talk
and act like a duck, and you hang
around with ducks then as far as I am
concerned you are a duck. No
amount of, or lack of advertising can
change that."

out of hiding. I thought that there
were governing groups in the medi
cal profession whose specific re
sponsibility it was to weed out these
licensed charlatans. Are these so
called "governing boards" not doing
their job? If not, why not? If they are
doing what they are morally bound
to do, then there should be none of
these "quacks" around to prey on
us, Advertising or not.
Set apart
Also the words "ivory tower" were
used to imply that there exists among
the medical profession a certain lof
tiness which, when coupled with
medical knowledge, produce a cer
tain attitude and demeanor that sets
doctors apart from the person on the
street.
I would be the first to admit this is
due to the fact that the intelligence
and character of "us masses" from
whom doctors get their not too
shabby income, are considerably
lower than those privileged few who
get to go to medical school. But can
the two students deny that over the
years, the medical schools and the
profession itself have failed misera
bly in attempting to wipe out this
gap, so that patients continue to
come away with a feeling of mystique
when dealing with most doctors?
Instead of agonizing over the ad
versities as opposed to the efficacies
of physician advertising the
medical profession would be wise to
seek answers instead as to why they

are fast losing esteem in the eyes of
the "masses."
To the two medical students I re
ferred to earlier I would say: make no
mistake as to this loss of respect and
confidence. It is there and growing
everyday. It is partly due maybe to
frustrated would-be doctors who
could not and cannot make the
grade. It is partly due to disgruntled
patients and relatives turning in their
frustration to less conventional types
of cures and treatments such as
"faith and psychic" healers.
It is partly due to those who are
qualified, or not, for counseling in
what has been heretofore ignored by
doctors. Subjects such as sex, old
age, and death to name a few. But
mostly it is the fault of medical

schools in failing to instill in students
the correct and only values you
should place on wanting to be doc
tors.
I am not so naive as to charge that
medical schools be 100 per cent ef
fective in this last statement. I can
only hope they make a greater effort
in this direction before turning stu
dents loose.
I judge people in every profession
(not just doctors) and every walk of
life by the adage: "If you walk, talk
and act like a duck, and you hang
around with ducks then as far as I am
concerned you are a duck. No
amount of, or lack of advertising can
change that."

Recently two opinions were pub
lished in the Daily, both expounding
the adversities of medical advertis
ing, and both written by medical stu
dents. Sartoris, Feb. 3, and Aglito,
Feb. 8, Daily. I must say they both
brought lumps to my throat — lumps
of involuntary regurgitation. Both
opinions were so tinged with future
self-interest and concern for per
petuating the stereotyped image of
most present day doctors that the
critical ailment of medicine today, if
indeed one thinks an ailment exists,
was utterly glossed over and left
hanging incompletely in mid-air.
To say that one of the dangers of
medical advertising lies in the misuse
that would "demean" the dignity of
the patient is pure bullshit. It is an
insult and injustice to the many con
scientous, qualified doctors that I
know exist.
The only thing that can demean a
patient or doctor in a patient-doctor
relationship is the doctor. Space
here certainly limits enumerating
the reasons for such demeaning

One reason might be lack of know
ledge on both sides, the doctor's as
well as the patient's. Another might
be lack of money on the patients'
part resulting in a demeaning like
atmosphere where one is subjected
to large impersonal clinics.
I refer to private clinics as well as
institutional ones. I call this the
"stockyard" syndrome. Private or
not, clinics tend to give one a de
meaning "handout" feeling. All this
without advertising.
Both articles inferred that through
advertising "quacks" would come
out of hiding. I thought that there
were governing groups in the medi
cal profession whose specific re

licensed charlatans. Are these so
