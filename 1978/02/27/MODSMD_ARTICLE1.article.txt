# UMW officials move to sell new contract
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — United Mine
Workers officials began an extensive
campaign yesterday to sell their
proposed contract, sending 200,000
copies of the controversial agree
ment to the coalfields.
"We're sending the copies by
trucks, airplanes, anyway we can get
them to our members," said UMW
President Arnold Miller. "I think the
rank and file will accept this agree
ment once they see for themselves
what's in it."
Despite vocal opposition from
many miners since the tentative ag
reement was announced Friday
night, Miller reiterated his belief that
the contract would be accepted by a
wide majority.
"I think our members understand
that in collective bargaining you
don't get everything you want," he
said. "This is a contract we can live
with. It guarantees our health and
pension benefits and takes a step to
ward speeding up the grievance pro
cedure."
The union's 160,000 striking min
ers won't vote on the contract until
early next week. While Miller said he
does not plan to go to the coalfields
and stump for the pact, hundreds of
district and local union officials will
be attempting to sell the agreement
to the miners who will work under its
provisions for the next three years.
In addition, the union's puDlic re
lations firm also plans to promote the
proposal with a series of radio and
television ads. This media campaign
is expected to focus especially upon
UMW Districts 29 and 17, in southern
West Virginia, the home of nearly
50,000 miners.
The union's educational blitz be
gins here today, when some 400 rep
resentatives from the 21 UMW dis
tricts, plus a bevy of rank and file
members invited by Miller will con
gregate at a downtown hotel and
hear the terms of the contract spelled
but. The district representatives will
go back home and relay the informa
tion — emphasizing the positive as

pects — to officers of the local un
ions within their respective districts.
These local officers then will carry
the news to the rank and file which,
by then, presumably will have re
ceived copies of the proposed ag
reement. Following this, a 48-hour
waiting period ensues before the
miners can vote. A bare majority is
needed for ratification.
The 130-member Bituminous Coal
Operators Association, meanwhile,
has its own ratification process. Al
though the BCOA apparently will not
announce its vote until the miners
have cast their secret ballots, the coal
operators are expected to approve
the contract.
The contract provides for a 37 per
cent wage increase over the next
three years, with an immediate $1-
an-hour raise. This would leave most
miners' salaries at about $80 a day by
1980, not counting overtime.
The two most controversial areas
are the health and pension package
and the section which deals with
wildcat strikes. During the final
hours of last week's negotiations, the
coal operators accepted the union
demand that the health and pension
plans be guaranteed and that the
companies' stance be softened in re
gard to the work stoppages.

UMW Districts 29 and 17, in southern
West Virginia, the home of nearly
50,000 miners.
The union's educational blitz be
gins here today, when some 400 rep
resentatives from the 21 UMW dis
tricts, plus a bevy of rank and file
members invited by Miller will con
gregate at a downtown hotel and
hear the terms of the contract spelled
but. The district representatives will
go back home and relay the informa
tion — emphasizing the positive as

pects — to officers of the local un
ions within their respective districts.
These local officers then will carry
the news to the rank and file which,
by then, presumably will have re
ceived copies of the proposed ag
reement. Following this, a 48-hour
waiting period ensues before the
miners can vote. A bare majority is
needed for ratification.
The 130-member Bituminous Coal
Operators Association, meanwhile,
has its own ratification process. Al
though the BCOA apparently will not
announce its vote until the miners
have cast their secret ballots, the coal
operators are expected to approve
the contract.
The contract provides for a 37 per
cent wage increase over the next
three years, with an immediate $1-
an-hour raise. This would leave most
miners' salaries at about $80 a day by
1980, not counting overtime.
The two most controversial areas
are the health and pension package
and the section which deals with
wildcat strikes. During the final
hours of last week's negotiations, the
coal operators accepted the union
demand that the health and pension
plans be guaranteed and that the
companies' stance be softened in re
gard to the work stoppages.

Washington (AP) — United Mine
Workers officials began an extensive
campaign yesterday to sell their
proposed contract, sending 200,000
copies of the controversial agree
ment to the coalfields.
"We're sending the copies by
trucks, airplanes, anyway we can get
them to our members," said UMW
President Arnold Miller. "I think the
rank and file will accept this agree
ment once they see for themselves
what's in it."
Despite vocal opposition from
many miners since the tentative ag
reement was announced Friday
night, Miller reiterated his belief that
the contract would be accepted by a
wide majority.
"I think our members understand
that in collective bargaining you
don't get everything you want," he
said. "This is a contract we can live
with. It guarantees our health and
pension benefits and takes a step to
ward speeding up the grievance pro
cedure."
The union's 160,000 striking min
ers won't vote on the contract until
early next week. While Miller said he
does not plan to go to the coalfields
and stump for the pact, hundreds of
district and local union officials will
be attempting to sell the agreement
to the miners who will work under its
provisions for the next three years.
In addition, the union's puDlic re
lations firm also plans to promote the
proposal with a series of radio and
television ads. This media campaign
is expected to focus especially upon
UMW Districts 29 and 17, in southern
West Virginia, the home of nearly
50,000 miners.
