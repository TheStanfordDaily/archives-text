# Sexism assuaged with ERA
## 
### 
Joey George

I don't understand how anyone
could be against the ERA. I want to
know why so many people in this
country are dead set against it.
It seems to me the burden of proof
should be on those who do not want
the ERA to become a part of the Con
stitution. As it stands right now, 35
states have ratified and three more
are needed.
A great deal of faith was placed in
South Carolina and Virginia in hopes
they too would ratify. Proponents,
however, were disappointed by the
"decisive" votes against it in both
states. Hope now shifts to Illinois and
Florida. There must be reasons why
these states have taken the action
that they have.

I've heard all the arguments ERA
opponents have put forth over the
past six years. After all, the issue hit
its peak when I was in high school
and was a favorite topic of debate
and editorials. I've tried to re
member all the arguments against
ERA but only the more striking ones
come to mind. Let's consider some
of them.
One of the best arguments is that
there is no need for an amendment
declaring equality between the
sexes, since current laws and statutes
insure there will be no discrimina
tion on the basis of sex. A Constitu
tional amendment would be more
trouble than it's worth, since it could
result in unwanted and unneeded
consequences.
The only problem is that laws and
statutes can be repealed fairly easily.
This view also implies that no one
favors discrimination on the basis of
sex and that these enlightened at
titudes will continue indefinitely.
My position is, even conceding
that most people are not sexist, why
take the risk of repealed statutes or
changed attitudes when a Constitu
tional amendment would make sex
ual equality a part of the supreme law
of the land? As for unwarranted con
sequences of judicial challenges, it's
difficult to see any detrimental ef
fects resulting from passage of the
ERA.
Issues stir emotion
The other arguments against the
ERA tend to get irrational. One heard
frequently is that adoption of the ERA
would surely mean the disappear
ance of public restrooms segregated
by sex. I just don't see how that could
happen. I can't figure out how out
lawing discrimination based on sex
would lead to such action.
A branch of the same argument is
that women would be required to fill
combat positions in warfare. That's
probably true and women would no
doubt be drafted in time of war just
like men. I can see how that might
scare some people, but it isn't a new
idea.
It's being done right now all over
the world, notably in Israel. Women
are just as able as men to fight in
open combat if trained properly. De
fending society is a responsibility
one assumes when one becomes a
part of that society. With equal rights
come equal responsibilities.

Perhaps the argument underlying
all the anti-ERA rhetoric is one that
has been around for quitea while, an
idea that most ERA opponents will no
doubt never admit to believing.
Naturally, I mean the idea that
women are inherently inferior to
men; their place is at home taking
care of the kids, and to pretend that
women even come close to being on
the same level with men is ridicul
ous. I don't think I need say any
more.
As to why I believe the ERA must be
passed, my position is almost too ob
vious to state. People in this country
are sexist. Women have been and
continue to be second-class citizens,
even though advances toward equal
ity are being made. However, nut
enough has been done. There is no
way we can make up for all the dis
crimination of the past other than by
giving women the right to do what
they want to do, to enjoy the same
rights now enjoyed by men.
We must have all people on the
same level. To insure equal protec
tion under the law for all people, ir
regardless of sex, we need to make
such an ideal part of our Constitu
tion, where it will in time become as
viable and sacred to us as the Eirst
Amendment is now.
The ERA will not make women
equal with men overnight or even
over a decade, but it will move us all
toward that goal like no other mea
sure can. Equality of the sexes will
carry the force of the Constitution.
What I would really like to see is a
column written by someone who
disagrees with me that would explain
rationally the anti-ERA sentiment. In
fact, I challenge someone to do so.

The ERA will not make women
equal with men overnight or even
over a decade, but it will move us all
toward that goal like no other mea
sure can. Equality of the sexes will
carry the force of the Constitution.
What I would really like to see is a
column written by someone who
disagrees with me that would explain
rationally the anti-ERA sentiment. In
fact, I challenge someone to do so.

I don't understand how anyone
could be against the ERA. I want to
know why so many people in this
country are dead set against it.
It seems to me the burden of proof
should be on those who do not want
the ERA to become a part of the Con
stitution. As it stands right now, 35
states have ratified and three more
are needed.
A great deal of faith was placed in
South Carolina and Virginia in hopes
they too would ratify. Proponents,
however, were disappointed by the
"decisive" votes against it in both
states. Hope now shifts to Illinois and
Florida. There must be reasons why
these states have taken the action
that they have.

I've heard all the arguments ERA
opponents have put forth over the
past six years. After all, the issue hit
its peak when I was in high school
and was a favorite topic of debate
and editorials. I've tried to re
member all the arguments against
ERA but only the more striking ones
come to mind. Let's consider some
of them.
One of the best arguments is that
there is no need for an amendment
declaring equality between the
sexes, since current laws and statutes
insure there will be no discrimina
tion on the basis of sex. A Constitu
tional amendment would be more
trouble than it's worth, since it could
result in unwanted and unneeded
consequences.
The only problem is that laws and
statutes can be repealed fairly easily.
This view also implies that no one
favors discrimination on the basis of
sex and that these enlightened at
titudes will continue indefinitely.
My position is, even conceding
that most people are not sexist, why
take the risk of repealed statutes or
changed attitudes when a Constitu
tional amendment would make sex
ual equality a part of the supreme law
of the land? As for unwarranted con
sequences of judicial challenges, it's
difficult to see any detrimental ef
fects resulting from passage of the
ERA.
Issues stir emotion
The other arguments against the
ERA tend to get irrational. One heard
frequently is that adoption of the ERA
would surely mean the disappear
ance of public restrooms segregated
by sex. I just don't see how that could
happen. I can't figure out how out
lawing discrimination based on sex
would lead to such action.
A branch of the same argument is
that women would be required to fill
combat positions in warfare. That's
probably true and women would no
doubt be drafted in time of war just
like men. I can see how that might
scare some people, but it isn't a new
idea.
It's being done right now all over
the world, notably in Israel. Women
are just as able as men to fight in
open combat if trained properly. De
fending society is a responsibility
one assumes when one becomes a
part of that society. With equal rights
come equal responsibilities.

Perhaps the argument underlying
all the anti-ERA rhetoric is one that
has been around for quitea while, an
idea that most ERA opponents will no
doubt never admit to believing.
Naturally, I mean the idea that
women are inherently inferior to
men; their place is at home taking
care of the kids, and to pretend that
women even come close to being on
the same level with men is ridicul
ous. I don't think I need say any
more.
As to why I believe the ERA must be
passed, my position is almost too ob
vious to state. People in this country
are sexist. Women have been and
continue to be second-class citizens,
even though advances toward equal
ity are being made. However, nut
enough has been done. There is no
way we can make up for all the dis
crimination of the past other than by
giving women the right to do what
they want to do, to enjoy the same
rights now enjoyed by men.
We must have all people on the
same level. To insure equal protec
tion under the law for all people, ir
regardless of sex, we need to make
such an ideal part of our Constitu
tion, where it will in time become as
viable and sacred to us as the Eirst
Amendment is now.
The ERA will not make women
equal with men overnight or even
over a decade, but it will move us all
toward that goal like no other mea
sure can. Equality of the sexes will
carry the force of the Constitution.
