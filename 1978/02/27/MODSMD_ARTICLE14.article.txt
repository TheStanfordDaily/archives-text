# Stanford overwhelmed, 15-1,15-10,15-1
## Japanese All-Stars give Cards a volleyball lesson 
### Ivan Maisel 
The men's volleyball match Friday night
wasn't a match, it was a class.
The Japanese Collegiate All-Stars were the
teachers and the Stanford Cardinals were the
students as the All-Stars soundly defeated the
Cards, 15-1, 15-10, 15-1.
Led by team captain Kazuyuki Mizuta, the
Japanese played a game of sound execution and
fundamentals. Mizuta, with 10 kills and five solo
blocks, proved he has earned his nickname of
"Mr. Volleyball." Also leading the All-Stars were
Yoshio lemoto with eight kills and two blocks,
and Tetsuno Takano with six kills. Setter
Masashi Oda contributed innumerable good
sets along with several diving saves.
Rich Yardley paced the Stanford play with six
kills and several fine plays. Also playing well
were Frank Anderson and Rod Fletcher with six
kills and two blocks apiece, and Ace Edwards,
who came off the bench to contribute five kills
and two blocks.
Overall, Card coach Art Lambert was pleased
with the Cards' play. "I'm very proud of the way
we played. We played well in the second game,
so well that we forced him (Japanese head coach
Masuru Saito) to put his better players in the
third game."
Lambert was equally laudatory of the
Japanese, but added, "When you've played nine
to 10 months a year for 10 or 12 years, this kind of
play evolves."
Indeed, Japan made noneof the mental errors
that the Cards made, such as letting serves drop,
and were rarely caught out of position.
Lambert went on to point out the team's li
mited experience hurt it considerably.
"If we had the same volleyball background
that the Japanese had, there's no doubt in my
mind that we would be just as good."
He added, "I'm not taking away from their
(the All-Stars) performance. They were tre
mendous."

Lambert had individual praise for Yardley,
Edwards and Dave Saeta, pointing out that Saeta
"set well for only his fifth match as a setter."
Saito concurred with Lambert's assessment of
the Card's players, adding Yardley and Rod
Fletcher played very well. "Yardley could be
come a great player," he said.
Although no deficiencies were apparent in
the Japanese game, Saito admitted he wished
they were taller. To make up for the lack of
height, Saito stated, "We use speed, deception,
floating (jump time), and combination (team
work)."
Short-lived lead
These skills were easily seen during the
match. Stanford scored the first point of the
match, but got no more in that first game.
Led by Shohei Iwatsuki, the Japanese played a
strong power game, replete with spikes, well
placed hits, and mishit returns by the Cards.
The second game was clearly Stanford's best
of the night. Stanford, behind Yardley's kills and
Japanese errors, jumped to a 5-0 lead. At that
point, both the Cards and the crowd were wildly
enthusiastic.
The Japanese called a time-out, and came
back to score two quick points. The score was
5-2, and remained that for several minutes, as
neither team could put anything together.
The Japanese broke a string of 12 consecutive
sideouts, and the tide began to turn against
Stanford. Yoshihiko Maeda contributed several
kills in propelling the All-Stars to six straight
points. Then, Mizuta and lemoto matched hit
for hit and built up a seemingly safe 14-6 lead.
Stanford rallied behind Yardley and Fletcher
to pull it to 14-10, and suddenly it was a close
game. Takano rose to the occasion with two fine
spikes and the game was over, and essentially,
so was the match. The Japanese scored 12 quick
points, and the third game was over almost be
fore it started.
