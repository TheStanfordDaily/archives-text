# Card women churn to victory
## 
### Andy Lowe 
Following a phenomenal sweep Friday of the first six places in
the competition's first individual event, the 500-yard freestyle,
the Stanford women's swim team maintained its lead over rivals
USC and UCLA throughout the three-day Stanford Collegiate
Invitational to take the team title with 1008 points.
Neither UCLA or USC could contend with Stanford's depth and
inspiring team performance, as the Bruins finished a distant sec
ond with 817 points and the Trojans captured third with 698
points.
"We are very proud of the way everyone on the team swam this
weekend," said Card coach Jim Gaughran. "Even those who
barely missed their standards deserve a lot of credit for our team
victory."
Responding to the increased rest allowed in preparation for the
meet, many Cards bettered tough AIAW standards and posted
lifetime bests. Zena Herrmann churned out excellent times in
seven events and contributed to Stanford's fine relay swims. The
versatile freshman qualified for the upcoming AIAW champion

ships in three events, the 100 backstroke (1:00.51), 200
backstroke (2:08.51), and 50 butterfly (26.8).
"Zena was one of the real stars of the meet," said Thomas. "She
is really valuable in a meet like this because she can place high in
so many events," added Gaughran.
Herrmann shared the spotlight with several of her teammates
whose swims were equally impressive. Valerie Lee, who swam a
faster second half as usual, lowered her nation-leading time in
winning the 1650 freestyle, as she stroked to a 16:41.07. Lee also
won the 500 freestyle (4:54.06) and 200 butterfly (2:06.37). Lee is
favored to retain her AIAW titles in the 500 freestyle, 1650 frees
tyle and 200 butterfly.
Unchallenged in her favorite event, the 200 freestyle, Olympic
gold medalist Kim Peyton sped to a pool record 1:50.85. Peyton
could not catch another Olympic gold medalist, UC-Santa Barba
ra's Sandy Nielson, in the 100 freestyle, but still touched a close
second with a seasonal best 52.1.
