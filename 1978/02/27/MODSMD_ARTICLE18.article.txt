# Stanford wins on track, but SJS takes meet

San Jose — The Stanford
track team put a scare in the
San Jose State cindermen be
fore bowing to the Spartans,
91-72, Saturday in San Jose.
The Spartans, surprised by
the Cardinals' strength in the
running events, jumped on
Stanford's weaknesses in the
field events to overcome the
Cards in the opening meet of
the season.
Many of the Spartans came
to the track Saturday morning
looking for an easy meet. But
the Cards notified their south
county rivals that they were to
be taken seriously when they
captured the 400-meter relay
early in the meet.
With flawless early-season
stickwork, Darrin Nelson, Alan
Sheats, Cordon Banks and
James Lofton sped to a 39.9
clocking, the third fastest ever
for a Stanford quarter-mile
quartet and the quickest open
ing season mark in school his
tory.
"The relay went real
smooth," Banks said. "The
passes were all good. Darrin
exploded out of the blocks and

ran a good lead-off leg.
"We've only been working
with this relay order for two
days, we've got to be satisfied.
We should get down in the low
395. We want to crack the
world list."
Freshmen Tom Lobsinger
and Mark Stillman added tothe
San Jose discomfort when they
blew by the rest of the mile
field on the last lap and coasted
across the finish line together
at 4:10.4. The one-two finish in
the mile coupled with the relay
victory and a one-two showing
in the steeplechase gave the
Cards a 26-8 advantage after
four events and put the Spar
tans on edge.
Lobsinger returned to the
track and set a Stanford
freshman mark with an 8:58.0
clocking in the two-mile.
"The coach (assistant coach
Marshall Clark) asked me how I
was feeling after the mile,"
Lobsinger said. "I told him I felt
great. Later, he said, 'Well, I
guess we'll double you.' Then I
started to wonder how good I
really felt."
But the gutty freshman from
Toronto, Ont., looked fresh in

theeight-lapper. He hung back
for most of the race, then came
from 10 yards back to pass San
Jose State's Dan Harvey and
finish second to Hayward
State's Ted Quintana. (Hay
ward State and Stanislaus State
also had athletes competing in
Saturday's meet.)
Stanford success on the
track continued in a 1:52.1
half-mile victory by senior
Dave Wells, a dead-heat finish
in the 400 between Stanford's
Alan Sheats and San Jose's Mar
lin Rochee, and a one-two
finish of Lofton and Banks in
the 200.
Lofton also won the long
jump with a leap of 25-2. Stan
ford's only other field event
victory came in the discus on
Rick Buss' 168-5 throw, his per
sonal best.
San jose outscored the
Cards 44-10 in the remaining
six field events — taking 33 of
36 points in the pole vault, high
jump, triple jump and shot put
— to neutralize Stanford's out
standing track showing.
San Jose's Dedy Cooper won
both hurdle events and an
chored the Spartans' victorious

mile-relay foursome to lead
San Jose to its fifth straight dual
meet triumph over the Cardi
nals.
