# Bicycle protection to be required by city
## 
### Tom Newell 
In a surprise move, the Palo Alto
City Council recently approved a
measure that will require all new
commercial developments to take
steps to provide protection for bicy
cles.
The type of protection required
from new developments will depend
on the type of parking facilities con
structed for automobiles. For the
most part developments will have to
provide either bike lockers or racks.
Council mpmbei Ellen Fletcher
said the ordinance dividps parking
spaces into three classes. A de
velopment which provides parking
for a half-hour or more will be re
quired to install bike lockers or pro
vide a fenced-in bicycle check area
with an attendant.
Fletcher said she believed that
most businesses will choose to
purchase the lockers (which cost
$140 apiece).
One for 10
The council adopted a provision
which calls for one enclosed,
aluminum-frame, burglar-proof
locker for every 10 automobile park
ing spaces planned for a new de
velopment.
A rack to which a cyclist can attach
his bicycle frame and wheels with
only a lock will be required at
facilities which provide parking for
five to 30 minutes.
A stationary rack to which a cyclist
can attach his bike with a lock and
chain will be required for develop
ments planning parking of less than
five minutes.
No guarantee
Approval by the city council, how
ever, does not guarantee that the
proposal will go into effect as it now
exists, Flptcher said.
"The ordinance will not become
effective until the zoning map is
drawn," she said. "I expect it to be
come effective sometime in July, but
until it does, amendments can still be
made."
Fletcher said that she hoped the
action taken by the council will
spread across the nation. Only two
other cities, Cupertino and Al
buquerque, N.M., are known to
have similar ordinances. The ordi
nances in both of those cities are re
stricted to certain types of develop
ments.
In an earlier interview, Fletcher
said, "If you don't provide parking
for the automobile, it's merely an in

convenience for the driver. But if you
don't provide a secure place for the
bicycles, it means the driver loses his
vehicle."
There is some question as to the
possible impact of the new ordi
nance at Stanford. Steve Schmidt, as
sistant planner for the Facilities and
Planning Office, said his office hasn't
studied the ordinance yet.
He said he believed, however, that
only a small portion of the campus
area — the shopping center and a
part of the medical center — will be
affected by the ordinance.
Fletcher chided Stanford for its
"reluctance to be a pace setter in this
issue."

nances in both of those cities are re
stricted to certain types of develop
ments.
In an earlier interview, Fletcher
said, "If you don't provide parking
for the automobile, it's merely an in

convenience for the driver. But if you
don't provide a secure place for the
bicycles, it means the driver loses his
vehicle."
There is some question as to the
possible impact of the new ordi
nance at Stanford. Steve Schmidt, as
sistant planner for the Facilities and
Planning Office, said his office hasn't
studied the ordinance yet.
He said he believed, however, that
only a small portion of the campus
area — the shopping center and a
part of the medical center — will be
affected by the ordinance.
Fletcher chided Stanford for its
"reluctance to be a pace setter in this
issue."
In a surprise move, the Palo Alto
City Council recently approved a
measure that will require all new
commercial developments to take
steps to provide protection for bicy
cles.
The type of protection required
from new developments will depend
on the type of parking facilities con
structed for automobiles. For the
most part developments will have to
provide either bike lockers or racks.
Council mpmbei Ellen Fletcher
said the ordinance dividps parking
spaces into three classes. A de
velopment which provides parking
for a half-hour or more will be re
quired to install bike lockers or pro
vide a fenced-in bicycle check area
with an attendant.
Fletcher said she believed that
most businesses will choose to
purchase the lockers (which cost
$140 apiece).
One for 10
The council adopted a provision
which calls for one enclosed,
aluminum-frame, burglar-proof
locker for every 10 automobile park
ing spaces planned for a new de
velopment.
A rack to which a cyclist can attach
his bicycle frame and wheels with
only a lock will be required at
facilities which provide parking for
five to 30 minutes.
A stationary rack to which a cyclist
can attach his bike with a lock and
chain will be required for develop
ments planning parking of less than
five minutes.
No guarantee
Approval by the city council, how
ever, does not guarantee that the
proposal will go into effect as it now
exists, Flptcher said.
"The ordinance will not become
effective until the zoning map is
drawn," she said. "I expect it to be
come effective sometime in July, but
until it does, amendments can still be
made."
Fletcher said that she hoped the
action taken by the council will
spread across the nation. Only two
other cities, Cupertino and Al
buquerque, N.M., are known to
have similar ordinances. The ordi
nances in both of those cities are re
stricted to certain types of develop
ments.
