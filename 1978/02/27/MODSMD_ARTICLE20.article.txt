## 
### Sukie Jackson 
"We just did not have
enough firepower for the
night," assistant coach Sue
Rojcewicz commented after
the Cards lost to the San Jose
State women's basketball team
Friday night, 72-65.
The Lady Spartans took an
early lead in the first half but
Stanford fought back to close
within two points at halftime,
31-29. With both Maggie Nel
son and Kathy Murphy in foul
trouble by halftime and with
point guard Stephanie Calef
out with a dislocated jaw, the
Cards couldn't maintain their
momentum to the finish of the
game.
Even though the Cards went
ahead 34-32 on a three-point
play by Betsy Lough early in the
second half, the Spartans con
trolled the rest of the game.
Shooting 55 per cent for the
evening, all eight San Jose
State players scored. Lee Ber
nadino led thp team with 17
points and teammates Mandy
Purnell and Karen Mason
scored 16 and 11 points for the
Spartans.
"Their shooting was too
good," Rojcewicz said. "They
beat us on the outside."
For Stanford, Nelson sank
five baskets and shot six-for-six
from the free throw line for a
total of 16 points. Sophomore
guard Lough who played "a
heck of a good game," accord
ing to Rojcewicz, had 15 points
and Murphy added 13.
The Lady Spartans, unde
feated in league play, secured
first place in the Northern
California Athletic Conference
after their defeat of Stanford.
The Cards have one league
game remaining against the
University of San Francisco

Dons who are 6-5 in the league.
The Cards, 8-3, have second
place wrapped up even if they
lose to the Dons in their last
home game. It will be played at
