### Cathy Dickerson 
Late inning efforts by Cardinal batsmen al
lowed the Stanford baseball team to return
home from Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo this
weekend with three more games in the win col
umn.
A ninth-inning rally won Friday's game for the
Cards, 5-3, a three-run ninth inning sent the first
game of Saturday's doubleheader into extra in
nings that Stanford was able to later pull out, 6-5,
and then one run in the last inning of the second
game gave the Cards a 2-1 victory.
"We were really fortunate to win," said Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess about all three
close contests. "Wegot thebig innings when we
needed them . . . we came back when we had to
and that's very positive." But he added, "We
have to improve a bit. We made a lot of mistakes
we don't normally make."
Friday afternoon under the chilly, overcast
skies in San Luis Obispo, the Cardinals found
themselves down 3-2, as they came to the top of
the ninth inning. Considering the bigness of
Poly Field and the cold weather which cut down
the ball's flight, Stanford concentrated on get
ting base hits.
With one out, freshman catcher Phil Wilson,
filling in for injured starting catcher Bruce Wal
ters, started the rally with a single. Leadoff batter
Pepe Hinojosa then walked, and Randy Wong
singled to load the bases. Centerfielder Larry
Reynolds singled to center, scoring Wilson and
Hinojosa ana giving Stanford a 4-3 lead. Tom
Cuardino added a final run with a sacrifice fly
that brought Wong home.
Saturday in the first game, the Cards found
themselves in even worse shape as they ap
proached the late innings. Arriving in the top of
the ninth trailing 5-2, Stanford once again had to
put together an offensive attack . . . and it
waited until there were two outs to start it!
Cuardino and Mike Codiroli singled to put
men on first and second with two down. Third

baseman Paul Zuvella then singled Guardino
home, cutting the deficit to two runs. Todd Ervin
sent the game into extra innings with a two-run
double to left field that tied the score at 5-5.
In the tenth, Stanford scored the winning run
on another Wilson single, a sacrifice by
Hinojosa and a single to right by Wong.
In the final game of the series — a seven in
ning contest — sophomore righthander Larry
Kuhii went the distance for the win. Turning in
what Marquess considered a "great game,"
Kuhn started off shakily, but then smoothed
things out. He allowed only an unearned run
and gave up only four hits.
Cal Poly scored its only run in the first inning
on a throwing error by Wilson. Kuhn wild
pitched and then Wilson overthrew third in an
attempt to get the Mustang base runner. The
ball went into left field, allowing the run to
score.
In the third inning Stanford tied the game at
one apiece when Wilson led off with a double
and moved to third on a groundout by Wong.
Wilson then scored on a passed ball.
The Cards broke the tie in the seventh when
Ervin reached first base on an infield single off
the pitcher's leg. He was sacrificed to second by
Gary Scott and scored on a two-out single by
Hinojosa.

Late inning efforts by Cardinal batsmen al
lowed the Stanford baseball team to return
home from Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo this
weekend with three more games in the win col
umn.
A ninth-inning rally won Friday's game for the
Cards, 5-3, a three-run ninth inning sent the first
game of Saturday's doubleheader into extra in
nings that Stanford was able to later pull out, 6-5,
and then one run in the last inning of the second
game gave the Cards a 2-1 victory.
"We were really fortunate to win," said Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess about all three
close contests. "Wegot thebig innings when we
needed them . . . we came back when we had to
and that's very positive." But he added, "We
have to improve a bit. We made a lot of mistakes
we don't normally make."
Friday afternoon under the chilly, overcast
skies in San Luis Obispo, the Cardinals found
themselves down 3-2, as they came to the top of
the ninth inning. Considering the bigness of
Poly Field and the cold weather which cut down
the ball's flight, Stanford concentrated on get
ting base hits.
With one out, freshman catcher Phil Wilson,
filling in for injured starting catcher Bruce Wal
ters, started the rally with a single. Leadoff batter
Pepe Hinojosa then walked, and Randy Wong
singled to load the bases. Centerfielder Larry
Reynolds singled to center, scoring Wilson and
Hinojosa ana giving Stanford a 4-3 lead. Tom
Cuardino added a final run with a sacrifice fly
that brought Wong home.
Saturday in the first game, the Cards found
themselves in even worse shape as they ap
proached the late innings. Arriving in the top of
the ninth trailing 5-2, Stanford once again had to
put together an offensive attack . . . and it
waited until there were two outs to start it!
Cuardino and Mike Codiroli singled to put
men on first and second with two down. Third

baseman Paul Zuvella then singled Guardino
home, cutting the deficit to two runs. Todd Ervin
sent the game into extra innings with a two-run
double to left field that tied the score at 5-5.
In the tenth, Stanford scored the winning run
on another Wilson single, a sacrifice by
Hinojosa and a single to right by Wong.
In the final game of the series — a seven in
ning contest — sophomore righthander Larry
Kuhii went the distance for the win. Turning in
what Marquess considered a "great game,"
Kuhn started off shakily, but then smoothed
things out. He allowed only an unearned run
and gave up only four hits.
Cal Poly scored its only run in the first inning
on a throwing error by Wilson. Kuhn wild
pitched and then Wilson overthrew third in an
attempt to get the Mustang base runner. The
ball went into left field, allowing the run to
score.
In the third inning Stanford tied the game at
one apiece when Wilson led off with a double
and moved to third on a groundout by Wong.
Wilson then scored on a passed ball.
