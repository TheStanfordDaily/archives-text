# Women gymnasts end home season
## Park grabs all-around title against 49ers 
### Dean Eyre 
In the final home perfor
mance of the season, Stan
ford's women gymnasts came
out even — finishing second to
Long Beach State, but also re
cording a win because of Sac
ramento State's forfeiture. The
split brings the final regular
season record to 4-6.
Although outscored 116.15
to 112.85 by the 49ers, the Car
dinals displayed strong indi
vidual routines. Dana Padden
took second in vaulting and
bars, Cindy Sedlund placed
third in floor exercise, and
Linda Park and lackie Eaby
earned second and third places
in beam competition.
Park's consistent perfor
mances in all four events won

her the meet's all-around
competition. By taking fourth
place in vaulting and floor
exercise, and fifth in bars, she
finished 0.2 points ahead of
Lynn Turley. The 49ers' Turley
won both the beam and vault
ing events.
"That beam routine of Lin
da's was fantastic for her — that
was the most control she's
shown this year," said head
coach Jackie Walker. "It (the
all-around title), was the most
exciting thing — it was unex
pected, especially to Linda.
That was a really great oppor
tunity for her. I think it helped
build her confidence. She has a
lot of potential and it's starting
to show up."
In addition to Park's fine per-

selves trips to the East Coast, as each qualified for the AIAW in
two events. Thompson, though already qualified in the 100 frees
tyle, bettered her previous time with a sizzling 53.2 and finished
fourth in the 200 freestyle in a fast 1:54.74. Ware led the
breaststroke contingent, cruising under cut-off times in the 100
and 200 breast (1:09.80 and 2:28.84).
Co-captain Anne Brodeil swam exceedingly well, as she clung
to Lee in the 500 freestyle (4:56.97) and 1650 freestyle (16:53.95),
proving she should place high in her specialties at the AIAWs.
Kim Shettle and Sheri Burlingham rounded out the list of Cards
meeting AIAW standards over the weekend. Shettle posted a fine
2:29.23 in the 200 breaststroke, the third event in which she has
qualified for the AIAWs. Burlingham sprinted to a 24.84 in the 50
freestyle, just .18 second behind teammate Peyton in the closest
race of the meet.
"The AIAWs should be an excellent meet for us," projected
Caughran. "Although we were only picked for fifth place, our
team's excellent showing this weekend indicates we could finish
considerably higher."

formance, Walker was pleased
with other individual show
ings. "Even though Cindy
didn't have her highest score
on floor exercise, that was the
best floor she's done all year.
Kerry did her best floor ex
routine of the season."
Padden was "amazing," ac
cording to Walker. "She was
sick with the flu all week and
didn'tworkoutatall. Shecame
in and competed and gets her
highest score of the year on
vaulting." She also recorded
her highest score on the bars.
Eaby had her best meet of
the season. Walker said, "She
was down in the middle of the
season, but now she's perked
up again. She worked really
hard for this meet; she looked

Season highs
Probably the most significant
achievement of the night for
Stanford was compiling seven
personal best scores and one
team best. Season top scores
were earned by Park on beam,
Sedlund on bars, and Eaby in
vaulting. Padden and Kerry Kol
ler both improved their
routines in the vaulting and bar
events for personal bests. As a
team, the vaulting score of
32.60 improved upon the pre
vious season record by 0.3
points.

without Muramatsu's talent for
the entire meet, were up to the
challenge.
"I think they did very well

It meant theft a couple of the

didn't count were going to
count and they came
through," Walker said.

looked rested, ready to com

Walker.

Stanford's Linda Park, vaulting here on her way to a fourth place
finish in the event, captured the all-around title in the women s final
meet of the season Friday. ,
In the final home perfor
mance of the season, Stan
ford's women gymnasts came
out even — finishing second to
Long Beach State, but also re
cording a win because of Sac
ramento State's forfeiture. The
split brings the final regular
season record to 4-6.
Although outscored 116.15
to 112.85 by the 49ers, the Car
dinals displayed strong indi
vidual routines. Dana Padden
took second in vaulting and
bars, Cindy Sedlund placed
third in floor exercise, and
Linda Park and lackie Eaby
earned second and third places
in beam competition.
Park's consistent perfor
mances in all four events won

her the meet's all-around
competition. By taking fourth
place in vaulting and floor
exercise, and fifth in bars, she
finished 0.2 points ahead of
Lynn Turley. The 49ers' Turley
won both the beam and vault
ing events.
"That beam routine of Lin
da's was fantastic for her — that
was the most control she's
shown this year," said head
coach Jackie Walker. "It (the
all-around title), was the most
exciting thing — it was unex
pected, especially to Linda.
That was a really great oppor
tunity for her. I think it helped
build her confidence. She has a
lot of potential and it's starting
to show up."
In addition to Park's fine per-

selves trips to the East Coast, as each qualified for the AIAW in
two events. Thompson, though already qualified in the 100 frees
tyle, bettered her previous time with a sizzling 53.2 and finished
fourth in the 200 freestyle in a fast 1:54.74. Ware led the
breaststroke contingent, cruising under cut-off times in the 100
and 200 breast (1:09.80 and 2:28.84).
Co-captain Anne Brodeil swam exceedingly well, as she clung
to Lee in the 500 freestyle (4:56.97) and 1650 freestyle (16:53.95),
proving she should place high in her specialties at the AIAWs.
Kim Shettle and Sheri Burlingham rounded out the list of Cards
meeting AIAW standards over the weekend. Shettle posted a fine
2:29.23 in the 200 breaststroke, the third event in which she has
qualified for the AIAWs. Burlingham sprinted to a 24.84 in the 50
freestyle, just .18 second behind teammate Peyton in the closest
race of the meet.
"The AIAWs should be an excellent meet for us," projected
Caughran. "Although we were only picked for fifth place, our
team's excellent showing this weekend indicates we could finish
considerably higher."

formance, Walker was pleased
with other individual show
ings. "Even though Cindy
didn't have her highest score
on floor exercise, that was the
best floor she's done all year.
Kerry did her best floor ex
routine of the season."
Padden was "amazing," ac
cording to Walker. "She was
sick with the flu all week and
didn'tworkoutatall. Shecame
in and competed and gets her
highest score of the year on
vaulting." She also recorded
her highest score on the bars.
Eaby had her best meet of
the season. Walker said, "She
was down in the middle of the
season, but now she's perked
up again. She worked really
hard for this meet; she looked

Season highs
Probably the most significant
achievement of the night for
Stanford was compiling seven
personal best scores and one
team best. Season top scores
were earned by Park on beam,
Sedlund on bars, and Eaby in
vaulting. Padden and Kerry Kol

team, the vaulting score of

Stanford's Linda Park, vaulting here on her way to a fourth place
finish in the event, captured the all-around title in the women s final
meet of the season Friday. ,
In the final home perfor
mance of the season, Stan
ford's women gymnasts came
out even — finishing second to
Long Beach State, but also re
cording a win because of Sac
ramento State's forfeiture. The
split brings the final regular
season record to 4-6.
Although outscored 116.15
to 112.85 by the 49ers, the Car
dinals displayed strong indi
vidual routines. Dana Padden
took second in vaulting and
bars, Cindy Sedlund placed
third in floor exercise, and
Linda Park and lackie Eaby
earned second and third places
in beam competition.
Park's consistent perfor
mances in all four events won

her the meet's all-around
competition. By taking fourth
place in vaulting and floor
exercise, and fifth in bars, she
finished 0.2 points ahead of
Lynn Turley. The 49ers' Turley
won both the beam and vault
ing events.
"That beam routine of Lin
da's was fantastic for her — that
was the most control she's
shown this year," said head
coach Jackie Walker. "It (the
all-around title), was the most
exciting thing — it was unex
pected, especially to Linda.
That was a really great oppor
tunity for her. I think it helped
build her confidence. She has a
lot of potential and it's starting
to show up."
In addition to Park's fine per-

selves trips to the East Coast, as each qualified for the AIAW in
two events. Thompson, though already qualified in the 100 frees
tyle, bettered her previous time with a sizzling 53.2 and finished
fourth in the 200 freestyle in a fast 1:54.74. Ware led the
breaststroke contingent, cruising under cut-off times in the 100
and 200 breast (1:09.80 and 2:28.84).
Co-captain Anne Brodeil swam exceedingly well, as she clung
to Lee in the 500 freestyle (4:56.97) and 1650 freestyle (16:53.95),
proving she should place high in her specialties at the AIAWs.
Kim Shettle and Sheri Burlingham rounded out the list of Cards
meeting AIAW standards over the weekend. Shettle posted a fine
2:29.23 in the 200 breaststroke, the third event in which she has
qualified for the AIAWs. Burlingham sprinted to a 24.84 in the 50
freestyle, just .18 second behind teammate Peyton in the closest
race of the meet.
"The AIAWs should be an excellent meet for us," projected
Caughran. "Although we were only picked for fifth place, our
team's excellent showing this weekend indicates we could finish
considerably higher."

formance, Walker was pleased
with other individual show
ings. "Even though Cindy
didn't have her highest score
on floor exercise, that was the
best floor she's done all year.
Kerry did her best floor ex
routine of the season."
Padden was "amazing," ac
cording to Walker. "She was
sick with the flu all week and
didn'tworkoutatall. Shecame
in and competed and gets her
highest score of the year on
vaulting." She also recorded
her highest score on the bars.
Eaby had her best meet of
the season. Walker said, "She
was down in the middle of the
season, but now she's perked
up again. She worked really
hard for this meet; she looked

Season highs
Probably the most significant
achievement of the night for
Stanford was compiling seven
personal best scores and one
team best. Season top scores
were earned by Park on beam,
Sedlund on bars, and Eaby in
vaulting. Padden and Kerry Kol

events for personal bests. As a

Season highs
Probably the most significant
achievement of the night for
Stanford was compiling seven
personal best scores and one
team best. Season top scores
were earned by Park on beam,
Sedlund on bars, and Eaby in
vaulting. Padden and Kerry Kol
ler both improved their
routines in the vaulting and bar
events for personal bests. As a
team, the vaulting score of
32.60 improved upon the pre

Stanford's Linda Park, vaulting here on her way to a fourth place
finish in the event, captured the all-around title in the women s final
meet of the season Friday. ,
In the final home perfor
mance of the season, Stan
ford's women gymnasts came
out even — finishing second to
Long Beach State, but also re
cording a win because of Sac
ramento State's forfeiture. The
split brings the final regular
season record to 4-6.
Although outscored 116.15
to 112.85 by the 49ers, the Car
dinals displayed strong indi
vidual routines. Dana Padden
took second in vaulting and
bars, Cindy Sedlund placed
third in floor exercise, and
Linda Park and lackie Eaby
earned second and third places
in beam competition.
Park's consistent perfor
mances in all four events won

her the meet's all-around
competition. By taking fourth
place in vaulting and floor
exercise, and fifth in bars, she
finished 0.2 points ahead of
Lynn Turley. The 49ers' Turley
won both the beam and vault
ing events.
"That beam routine of Lin
da's was fantastic for her — that
was the most control she's
shown this year," said head
coach Jackie Walker. "It (the
all-around title), was the most
exciting thing — it was unex
pected, especially to Linda.
That was a really great oppor
tunity for her. I think it helped
build her confidence. She has a
lot of potential and it's starting
to show up."
In addition to Park's fine per-

selves trips to the East Coast, as each qualified for the AIAW in
two events. Thompson, though already qualified in the 100 frees
tyle, bettered her previous time with a sizzling 53.2 and finished
fourth in the 200 freestyle in a fast 1:54.74. Ware led the
breaststroke contingent, cruising under cut-off times in the 100
and 200 breast (1:09.80 and 2:28.84).
Co-captain Anne Brodeil swam exceedingly well, as she clung
to Lee in the 500 freestyle (4:56.97) and 1650 freestyle (16:53.95),
proving she should place high in her specialties at the AIAWs.
Kim Shettle and Sheri Burlingham rounded out the list of Cards
meeting AIAW standards over the weekend. Shettle posted a fine
2:29.23 in the 200 breaststroke, the third event in which she has
qualified for the AIAWs. Burlingham sprinted to a 24.84 in the 50
freestyle, just .18 second behind teammate Peyton in the closest
race of the meet.
"The AIAWs should be an excellent meet for us," projected
Caughran. "Although we were only picked for fifth place, our
team's excellent showing this weekend indicates we could finish
considerably higher."

formance, Walker was pleased
with other individual show
ings. "Even though Cindy
didn't have her highest score
on floor exercise, that was the
best floor she's done all year.
Kerry did her best floor ex
routine of the season."
Padden was "amazing," ac
cording to Walker. "She was
sick with the flu all week and
didn'tworkoutatall. Shecame
in and competed and gets her
highest score of the year on
vaulting." She also recorded
her highest score on the bars.
Eaby had her best meet of
the season. Walker said, "She
was down in the middle of the
season, but now she's perked
up again. She worked really
hard for this meet; she looked

Season highs
Probably the most significant
achievement of the night for
Stanford was compiling seven
personal best scores and one
team best. Season top scores
were earned by Park on beam,
Sedlund on bars, and Eaby in
vaulting. Padden and Kerry Kol
ler both improved their
routines in the vaulting and bar
events for personal bests. As a
team, the vaulting score of
32.60 improved upon the pre
vious season record by 0.3
points.

Stanford's Linda Park, vaulting here on her way to a fourth place
finish in the event, captured the all-around title in the women s final
meet of the season Friday. ,
In the final home perfor
mance of the season, Stan
ford's women gymnasts came
out even — finishing second to
Long Beach State, but also re
cording a win because of Sac
ramento State's forfeiture. The
split brings the final regular
season record to 4-6.
Although outscored 116.15
to 112.85 by the 49ers, the Car
dinals displayed strong indi
vidual routines. Dana Padden
took second in vaulting and
bars, Cindy Sedlund placed
third in floor exercise, and
Linda Park and lackie Eaby
earned second and third places
in beam competition.
Park's consistent perfor
mances in all four events won

her the meet's all-around
competition. By taking fourth
place in vaulting and floor
exercise, and fifth in bars, she
finished 0.2 points ahead of
Lynn Turley. The 49ers' Turley
won both the beam and vault
ing events.
"That beam routine of Lin
da's was fantastic for her — that
was the most control she's
shown this year," said head
coach Jackie Walker. "It (the
all-around title), was the most
exciting thing — it was unex
pected, especially to Linda.
That was a really great oppor
tunity for her. I think it helped
build her confidence. She has a
lot of potential and it's starting
to show up."
In addition to Park's fine per-

selves trips to the East Coast, as each qualified for the AIAW in
two events. Thompson, though already qualified in the 100 frees
tyle, bettered her previous time with a sizzling 53.2 and finished
fourth in the 200 freestyle in a fast 1:54.74. Ware led the
breaststroke contingent, cruising under cut-off times in the 100
and 200 breast (1:09.80 and 2:28.84).
Co-captain Anne Brodeil swam exceedingly well, as she clung
to Lee in the 500 freestyle (4:56.97) and 1650 freestyle (16:53.95),
proving she should place high in her specialties at the AIAWs.
Kim Shettle and Sheri Burlingham rounded out the list of Cards
meeting AIAW standards over the weekend. Shettle posted a fine
2:29.23 in the 200 breaststroke, the third event in which she has
qualified for the AIAWs. Burlingham sprinted to a 24.84 in the 50
freestyle, just .18 second behind teammate Peyton in the closest
race of the meet.
"The AIAWs should be an excellent meet for us," projected
Caughran. "Although we were only picked for fifth place, our
team's excellent showing this weekend indicates we could finish
considerably higher."

formance, Walker was pleased
with other individual show
ings. "Even though Cindy
didn't have her highest score
on floor exercise, that was the
best floor she's done all year.
Kerry did her best floor ex
routine of the season."
Padden was "amazing," ac
cording to Walker. "She was
sick with the flu all week and
didn'tworkoutatall. Shecame
in and competed and gets her
highest score of the year on
vaulting." She also recorded
her highest score on the bars.
Eaby had her best meet of
the season. Walker said, "She
was down in the middle of the
season, but now she's perked
up again. She worked really
hard for this meet; she looked
