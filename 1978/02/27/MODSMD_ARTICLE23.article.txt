The Stanford bowling team
overcame the poor lane condi

weekend in Los Angeles, grab
bing first place in event.
Under the coaching of Bay
Area pro Barry Mann, the team
finished with 8305 pins for nine
games, far out in front of sec
ond place San Diego State's
8107. By finishing in the top
spot, the team gained a berth
in national competition.
Their next stop is sectional

compete against other West
ern regional and league
champions. The winners from
each of the 10 sectional events

Wis. on May 2 through 6.
Leading the Cardinals was
Pat Deane. His total of 1765
pins, a 196 average for nine
games, placed him second in

the individual all-events com
petition, qualifying him for the
Men's National Intercollegiate
All-Events Championships in
St. Louis, Mo. on April 4
through 6. Deane shot consis
tently, something few others
were able to do under the con
ditions, but wrapped up his
qualifying spot with a 233 game
and 602 series in the final three
games.
Deane's'6o2 in singles placed
him second to Stanford's
Chuck Bedford, who shot a 609
three-game series. In addition
to his win in singles, Bedford'
also placed fourth in all-events

lust off the leader board for
the Cardinals was Carl Chavez

Howard Lynch and the strong
finish from Jerry Goedicke
rounded the team effort.
"I'm just really proud," said
Mann, "all my boys just looked
super!"
The team finishes its league
competition over the weekend
at San )ose State.
