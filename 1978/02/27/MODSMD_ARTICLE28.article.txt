Park brought back for questioning
Washington — Tong-sun Park, vowing to tell the
"complete truth" to Congress about alleged South Ko
rean influence buying, arrived in Washington yesterday
afternoon after a 1 '/i-year absence.
Park, accompanied by justice Department attorneys
and surrounded by 20 U.S. and Korean security agents,
arrived in the capital from Seattle. The trip marked the
culmination of a painstaking U.S. effort to return the
millionaire rice dealer to this country.
"I hope as a result of my giving my side of the story as
well as I can recollect how things did happen, I hope
things will come to a happy ending," Park said when he
arrived. He refused to answer specific questions put to
him by reporters at Dulles International Airport.
In other matters concerning Park, Newsweek
magazine reports in this week's editions that Park made
a $500,000 personal loan to Gen. Vang Du Won, chief of
the Korean Central Intelligence Agency in Washington.
Park denied ties to the intelligence organization, say
ing the loan was coerced by Yang and has not been
repaid.
Local miners' contract rejected
United Mine Workers President Arnold Miller, Presi
dent Jimmy Carter and Labor Secretary Kay Marshall
remained cautiously optimistic yesterday as a new prop
osal to enH the nation's coal strike was being sent to the
miners for ratification.
But a number of union officials in West Virginia, a key
state in the ratification process, were not optimistic
about the chances for adoption of the contract. Hopes of
ending the 83-day-old strike dimmed even more when
UMW members rejected a similar contract with the in
dependent Pittsburg & Midway Mining Co. on Saturday.
Miners in four of the five UMW locals affected by the
P&M agreement voted J57-to-163 against the proposed
contract. Several of the men said they voted against the
contract because they wanted to see whether the na
tional agreement was better.

Chlorine gas kills eight in Florida
Youngstown, Fla. — A freight train carrying deadly
chlorine derailed early yesterday and sent a choking
cloud of gas across a busy highway in the piney woods
country of Florida's Panhandle, authorities said. Eight
persons were killed. At least 67 others were hos
pitalized.
The dead included three teenagers who smashed at
car windows in terror after the doors of their old auto
jammed, trapping them as searing fumes seeped in.
Other motorists were felled while trying to flee after
the chlorine stalled their auto engines by cutting off the
oxygen needed for combustion.
One survivor owed his life to his scuba-diving gear
which he grabbed as fumes filled his vehicle.
Sheriff's officers ordered 700 to 1000 persons
evacuated from the surrounding countryside and closed
U.S. 231 which parallels the railroad, said the Bay County
Sheriff's office.
The highway was blanketed for hours after the 2:30
a.m. (EST) derailment by the cloud that escaped from the
ruptured tank car about 200 yards away.
When engines stalled, cars careened into roadside
ditches. Some motorists fled into a swamp near the
tracks, only to be enveloped by the searing greenish
yellow cloud.
Animosities toward Shah surface
Tabriz, Iran — Riots a week ago in this city near the
Soviet frontier have brought to the surface deeply
rooted animosity among Moslem leaders toward the
Shah of Iran. Disorders could erupt again soon, infor
mants say.
Government officials say the rioting Feb. 18 here in
Iran's second largest city left nine persons dead and 125
injured. The cause of the deaths and injuries was not
officially reported.
Moslem leaders claim, however, that security forces
killed about 300 men, a figure that could not be con
firmed by independent observers.
Damage to government buildings, banks and busines
ses amounted to $2.5 million, government officials said.

About 350 persons, mostly young men, were reported
arrested.
"The total damage may not amount to much, but the
ferocity in which the rioters aimed their vengeance at
government buildings, decorated with emblems of Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's reign, was frightening," said
one resident of this city of almost one million popula
tion.
Congress rated more conservative
Washington — The American Conservative Union gave
only two senators and 24 House members perfect scores
in its tally of 1977 voting records and concluded there is a
new trend to the right.
"In the years that ACU has been rating the Congress,
the results have always indicated a downward trend —
the scores had been getting lower each year as the Con
gress became more liberal," said ACU legislative direc
tor Gary jarmin in releasing the ratings.
"In 1977, however, we see an encouraging sign — an
increase in the scores and a definite shift to the right —
particularly in the Republican Party,'' jarmin said.
jarmin said the average rating for House Republicans
for 1977 jumped 5.1 per cent, from 73.9 per cent in 1976
to 79 per cent last year.
The ACU scores for 1977 support similar conclusions
drawn earlier by the Americans for Democratic Action,
which issued ratings from the liberal perspective and
also noted a conservative drift.
Thousands visit Nixon's estate
San Clemente — Thousands of tourists paid $2.50
apiece and took a 10-minute tour of Richard Nixon's
estate yesterday — a trip which thrilled a few but disap
pointed many.
"Like everything Nixon's done, he promised more
than he delivered," said a disgruntled tourist, emerging
from one of the first buses allowed on the property.
The visitors, who traveled from as far as Canada for the
first public look at the compound once known as the
Western White House, almost all complained that the
trip was too short.
The tour, which was arranged by the Chamber of

Commerce to celebrate San Clemente's 50th birthday,
began at a high school a few miles away. From there,
buses tarrying about 50 people each made repeated
trips to the Nixon estate carrying visitors who purchased
tickets.

Local miners' contract rejected
United Mine Workers President Arnold Miller, Presi

remained cautiously optimistic yesterday as a new prop
osal to enH the nation's coal strike was being sent to the
miners for ratification.
But a number of union officials in West Virginia, a key
state in the ratification process, were not optimistic
about the chances for adoption of the contract. Hopes of
ending the 83-day-old strike dimmed even more when
UMW members rejected a similar contract with the in
dependent Pittsburg & Midway Mining Co. on Saturday.
Miners in four of the five UMW locals affected by the
P&M agreement voted J57-to-163 against the proposed
contract. Several of the men said they voted against the
contract because they wanted to see whether the na
tional agreement was better.

Chlorine gas kills eight in Florida
Youngstown, Fla. — A freight train carrying deadly
chlorine derailed early yesterday and sent a choking
cloud of gas across a busy highway in the piney woods
country of Florida's Panhandle, authorities said. Eight
persons were killed. At least 67 others were hos
pitalized.
The dead included three teenagers who smashed at
car windows in terror after the doors of their old auto
jammed, trapping them as searing fumes seeped in.
Other motorists were felled while trying to flee after
the chlorine stalled their auto engines by cutting off the
oxygen needed for combustion.
One survivor owed his life to his scuba-diving gear
which he grabbed as fumes filled his vehicle.
Sheriff's officers ordered 700 to 1000 persons
evacuated from the surrounding countryside and closed
U.S. 231 which parallels the railroad, said the Bay County
Sheriff's office.
The highway was blanketed for hours after the 2:30
a.m. (EST) derailment by the cloud that escaped from the
ruptured tank car about 200 yards away.
When engines stalled, cars careened into roadside
ditches. Some motorists fled into a swamp near the
tracks, only to be enveloped by the searing greenish
yellow cloud.
Animosities toward Shah surface
Tabriz, Iran — Riots a week ago in this city near the
Soviet frontier have brought to the surface deeply
rooted animosity among Moslem leaders toward the
Shah of Iran. Disorders could erupt again soon, infor
mants say.
Government officials say the rioting Feb. 18 here in
Iran's second largest city left nine persons dead and 125
injured. The cause of the deaths and injuries was not
officially reported.
Moslem leaders claim, however, that security forces
killed about 300 men, a figure that could not be con
firmed by independent observers.
Damage to government buildings, banks and busines
ses amounted to $2.5 million, government officials said.

About 350 persons, mostly young men, were reported
arrested.
"The total damage may not amount to much, but the
ferocity in which the rioters aimed their vengeance at
government buildings, decorated with emblems of Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's reign, was frightening," said
one resident of this city of almost one million popula
tion.
Congress rated more conservative
Washington — The American Conservative Union gave
only two senators and 24 House members perfect scores
in its tally of 1977 voting records and concluded there is a
new trend to the right.
"In the years that ACU has been rating the Congress,
the results have always indicated a downward trend —
the scores had been getting lower each year as the Con
gress became more liberal," said ACU legislative direc
tor Gary jarmin in releasing the ratings.
"In 1977, however, we see an encouraging sign — an
increase in the scores and a definite shift to the right —
particularly in the Republican Party,'' jarmin said.
jarmin said the average rating for House Republicans
for 1977 jumped 5.1 per cent, from 73.9 per cent in 1976
to 79 per cent last year.
The ACU scores for 1977 support similar conclusions
drawn earlier by the Americans for Democratic Action,
which issued ratings from the liberal perspective and
also noted a conservative drift.
Thousands visit Nixon's estate
San Clemente — Thousands of tourists paid $2.50
apiece and took a 10-minute tour of Richard Nixon's
estate yesterday — a trip which thrilled a few but disap
pointed many.
"Like everything Nixon's done, he promised more
than he delivered," said a disgruntled tourist, emerging
from one of the first buses allowed on the property.
The visitors, who traveled from as far as Canada for the
first public look at the compound once known as the
Western White House, almost all complained that the
trip was too short.
The tour, which was arranged by the Chamber of

Commerce to celebrate San Clemente's 50th birthday,
began at a high school a few miles away. From there,
buses tarrying about 50 people each made repeated
trips to the Nixon estate carrying visitors who purchased
tickets.

state in the ratification process, were not optimistic
about the chances for adoption of the contract. Hopes of
ending the 83-day-old strike dimmed even more when
UMW members rejected a similar contract with the in
dependent Pittsburg & Midway Mining Co. on Saturday.
Miners in four of the five UMW locals affected by the
P&M agreement voted J57-to-163 against the proposed
contract. Several of the men said they voted against the
contract because they wanted to see whether the na
tional agreement was better.

Chlorine gas kills eight in Florida
Youngstown, Fla. — A freight train carrying deadly
chlorine derailed early yesterday and sent a choking
cloud of gas across a busy highway in the piney woods
country of Florida's Panhandle, authorities said. Eight
persons were killed. At least 67 others were hos
pitalized.
The dead included three teenagers who smashed at
car windows in terror after the doors of their old auto
jammed, trapping them as searing fumes seeped in.
Other motorists were felled while trying to flee after
the chlorine stalled their auto engines by cutting off the
oxygen needed for combustion.
One survivor owed his life to his scuba-diving gear
which he grabbed as fumes filled his vehicle.
Sheriff's officers ordered 700 to 1000 persons
evacuated from the surrounding countryside and closed
U.S. 231 which parallels the railroad, said the Bay County
Sheriff's office.
The highway was blanketed for hours after the 2:30
a.m. (EST) derailment by the cloud that escaped from the
ruptured tank car about 200 yards away.
When engines stalled, cars careened into roadside
ditches. Some motorists fled into a swamp near the
tracks, only to be enveloped by the searing greenish
yellow cloud.
Animosities toward Shah surface
Tabriz, Iran — Riots a week ago in this city near the
Soviet frontier have brought to the surface deeply
rooted animosity among Moslem leaders toward the
Shah of Iran. Disorders could erupt again soon, infor
mants say.
Government officials say the rioting Feb. 18 here in
Iran's second largest city left nine persons dead and 125
injured. The cause of the deaths and injuries was not
officially reported.
Moslem leaders claim, however, that security forces
killed about 300 men, a figure that could not be con
firmed by independent observers.
Damage to government buildings, banks and busines
ses amounted to $2.5 million, government officials said.

About 350 persons, mostly young men, were reported
arrested.
"The total damage may not amount to much, but the
ferocity in which the rioters aimed their vengeance at
government buildings, decorated with emblems of Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's reign, was frightening," said
one resident of this city of almost one million popula
tion.
Congress rated more conservative
Washington — The American Conservative Union gave
only two senators and 24 House members perfect scores
in its tally of 1977 voting records and concluded there is a
new trend to the right.
"In the years that ACU has been rating the Congress,
the results have always indicated a downward trend —
the scores had been getting lower each year as the Con
gress became more liberal," said ACU legislative direc
tor Gary jarmin in releasing the ratings.
"In 1977, however, we see an encouraging sign — an
increase in the scores and a definite shift to the right —
particularly in the Republican Party,'' jarmin said.
jarmin said the average rating for House Republicans
for 1977 jumped 5.1 per cent, from 73.9 per cent in 1976
to 79 per cent last year.
The ACU scores for 1977 support similar conclusions
drawn earlier by the Americans for Democratic Action,
which issued ratings from the liberal perspective and
also noted a conservative drift.
Thousands visit Nixon's estate
San Clemente — Thousands of tourists paid $2.50
apiece and took a 10-minute tour of Richard Nixon's
estate yesterday — a trip which thrilled a few but disap
pointed many.
"Like everything Nixon's done, he promised more
than he delivered," said a disgruntled tourist, emerging
from one of the first buses allowed on the property.
The visitors, who traveled from as far as Canada for the
first public look at the compound once known as the
Western White House, almost all complained that the
trip was too short.
The tour, which was arranged by the Chamber of

Commerce to celebrate San Clemente's 50th birthday,
began at a high school a few miles away. From there,
buses tarrying about 50 people each made repeated
trips to the Nixon estate carrying visitors who purchased
tickets.

Park brought back for questioning
Washington — Tong-sun Park, vowing to tell the
"complete truth" to Congress about alleged South Ko
rean influence buying, arrived in Washington yesterday
afternoon after a 1 '/i-year absence.
Park, accompanied by justice Department attorneys
and surrounded by 20 U.S. and Korean security agents,
arrived in the capital from Seattle. The trip marked the
culmination of a painstaking U.S. effort to return the
millionaire rice dealer to this country.
"I hope as a result of my giving my side of the story as
well as I can recollect how things did happen, I hope
things will come to a happy ending," Park said when he
arrived. He refused to answer specific questions put to
him by reporters at Dulles International Airport.
In other matters concerning Park, Newsweek
magazine reports in this week's editions that Park made
a $500,000 personal loan to Gen. Vang Du Won, chief of
the Korean Central Intelligence Agency in Washington.
Park denied ties to the intelligence organization, say
ing the loan was coerced by Yang and has not been
repaid.
Local miners' contract rejected
