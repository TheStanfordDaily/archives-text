# LOTS computer services reassessed

### Stephen Penico 
Long waiting lines for terminals,
high usage and insufficient funds av
ailable for student computing pro
jects have led to a re-evaluation of
services offered by the Low Over
head Timesharing computer system,
according to LOTS Director John
McCarthy.
When LOTS began last winter, its
first priority was to take over stu
dents' computer class use. LOTS has
"successfully handled" this need,
McCarthy said.
But other priorities such as assum

ing unfunded research by students
and giving students free access to
computers are being reexamined,
said ).Q. Johnson, subsystems prog
rammer at LOTS.
In the future, students using LOTS
for unfunded research may not be
allowed to use a terminal when
people are waiting to do classwork,
he said.
Ed Williams, director of the Stan
ford Center for Information Proces
sing's campus facility, said that real
location of departmental computer
funds to LOTS has resulted in de
partments exhausting funds for
graduate student projects at SCIP
earlier than anticipated.
Departments such as sociology
have continued to use SCIP's bigger
computer for large statistical
analyses, Williams said. The varying
needs of different departments make
it necessary to decide what role LOTS
should play in student research and
how funds should be divided bet
ween LOTS and SCIP, he said.
Coordinated effort
Williams, a member of LOTS' ad
visory board, emphasized that good
rapport exists between LOTS and
SCIP. He said that all policy changes
are based on input from both com
puter centers.
"We are now in a period of trying
to find what the complementary
functions of LOTS and SCIP should
be," he added.
Williams said LOTS has not sig
nificantly reduced the $5 million bus
iness SCIP annually derives from
large research projects, commercial
use by local industry, the Stanford

Hospital and maintenance of data
bases used nationwide.
Slow computer
While the possibility of long lines
at LOTS was foreseen before the
facility was opened, other shortcom
ings were not. The LOTS computer
has not lived up to expectations
about how fast it would work, said
Mike Byron, student coordinator.
As well, students have not helped
each other with programming prob
' lems as much as originally expected.
LOTS has had to add a consulting
facility to correct this problem, Byron
said.

The memory capacity of the LOTS
system was recently increased 50 per
cent and the computer now works
noticeably faster, Johnson said. The
average wait to get a terminal, how
ever, is still more than an hour during
periods of the afternoon and even
ing.
In the short run, Johnson said,
LOTS will work to improve the per
formance of existing equipment.
Other short-range efforts include
examining computer accounts to see
if unauthorized people are using the
system.

earlier than anticipated.
Departments such as sociology
have continued to use SCIP's bigger
computer for large statistical
analyses, Williams said. The varying
needs of different departments make
it necessary to decide what role LOTS
should play in student research and
how funds should be divided bet
ween LOTS and SCIP, he said.
Coordinated effort
Williams, a member of LOTS' ad
visory board, emphasized that good
rapport exists between LOTS and
SCIP. He said that all policy changes
are based on input from both com
puter centers.
"We are now in a period of trying
to find what the complementary
functions of LOTS and SCIP should
be," he added.
Williams said LOTS has not sig
nificantly reduced the $5 million bus
iness SCIP annually derives from
large research projects, commercial
use by local industry, the Stanford

Hospital and maintenance of data
bases used nationwide.
Slow computer
While the possibility of long lines
at LOTS was foreseen before the
facility was opened, other shortcom
ings were not. The LOTS computer
has not lived up to expectations
about how fast it would work, said
Mike Byron, student coordinator.
As well, students have not helped
each other with programming prob
' lems as much as originally expected.
LOTS has had to add a consulting
facility to correct this problem, Byron
said.

The memory capacity of the LOTS
system was recently increased 50 per
cent and the computer now works
noticeably faster, Johnson said. The
average wait to get a terminal, how
ever, is still more than an hour during
periods of the afternoon and even
ing.
In the short run, Johnson said,
LOTS will work to improve the per
formance of existing equipment.
Other short-range efforts include
examining computer accounts to see
if unauthorized people are using the
system.
Long waiting lines for terminals,
high usage and insufficient funds av
ailable for student computing pro
jects have led to a re-evaluation of
services offered by the Low Over
head Timesharing computer system,
according to LOTS Director John
McCarthy.
When LOTS began last winter, its
first priority was to take over stu
dents' computer class use. LOTS has
"successfully handled" this need,
McCarthy said.
But other priorities such as assum

ing unfunded research by students
and giving students free access to
computers are being reexamined,
said ).Q. Johnson, subsystems prog
rammer at LOTS.
In the future, students using LOTS
for unfunded research may not be
allowed to use a terminal when
people are waiting to do classwork,
he said.
Ed Williams, director of the Stan
ford Center for Information Proces
sing's campus facility, said that real
location of departmental computer
funds to LOTS has resulted in de
partments exhausting funds for
graduate student projects at SCIP
earlier than anticipated.
