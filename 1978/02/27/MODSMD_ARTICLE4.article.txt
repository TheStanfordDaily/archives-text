Tokyo (AP) — Standing beneath
huge portraits of himself and Mao
Tse-tung, Communist Party Chair
man Hua Kuo-feng opened China's
fifth National People's Congress yes
terday by urging military readiness
for a takeover of Taiwan.
Hua said the 3.5-million-member
People's Liberation Army "must
make all the preparations necessary
for the liberation of Taiwan," Pek
ing's official Hsinhua news agency
reported in a dispatch received here.
Hsinhua's excerpts from Hua's
3V2-hour speech did not amplify on
the reference to Taiwan. He and
other Peking leaders have called re
peatedly for the "liberation" of the
island from the Nationalist Chinese
who fled there after the Communist
Chinese victory in 1949. But they
generally have played down the po
tential military character of such a
takeover.
Chinese insistence that
Washington withdraw its recognition
and defense pact with Taiwan has
been the main obstacle to establish
ment of U.S.-Chinese diplomatic re
lations.
Hua said the struggle against "the
two hegemonist powers, the Soviet
Union and the United States, and in

particular against Soviet social
imperialism, is on an upsurge higher
than ever before."
But he indicated indirectly that
China would continue its policy of
improving relations with America
and the West. Hsinhua said he
pledged to carry out the "revolutio
nary line in foreign affairs" of the late
Chairman Mao, who began the rap
prochement with Washington.
A television broadcast seen here of
the congress' opening showed the
3456 delegates and their guests
applauding while the smiling Hua en
tered Peking's Great Hall of the
People, followed by Marshal Yeh
Chienying, the party's first vice
chairman, and by the other vice
chairmen, Teng Hsiao-ping, Li
Hsien-nien and Wang Tung-hsing.
The assembly rose in silent tribute
to three leaders who died in 1976 —
Mao, Premier Chou En-lai and Chu
Teh, head of the standing committee
of the congress, China's parliament.
This session is the first since their
deaths and the arrest of the radical
"Gang of Four," led by Mao's widow,
Chiang Ching. The radicals, who
emphasized ideological purity and
distrusted foreign influences, were
seized in October 1976 on charges of
plotting to overthrow Hua, whose
government stresses technological
progress and greater openness to the
West.
Party Chairman Hua, 57, addressed
the congress in his concurrent capac
ity as premier. Some analysts expect
this congress to give that office to the
Teng, 74, a pragmatist protege of
Chou. Teng, purged under the radi
cals, has regained his popularity
since being restored to power last
year.
In his speech, Huaemphasized the
need for unity among all Chinese,
including those on Taiwan, and for
giving full scope to the country's in
tellectuals, minorities and non-
Communists. And he outlined the
first three-year phase of an economic
modernization campaign.
