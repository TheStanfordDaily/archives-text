# Black Mountain Ranch
## $475,000 land sale authorized 
### Jeff Hook 
The Board of Trustees recently authorized a $475,000
sale of a 694-acre parcel of land located on Skyline
Boulevard in Palo Alto to the Midpeninsula Regional
Open Space District.
The property, known as Black Mountain Ranch, will
become part of the Monte Bello Open Space Preserve
which borders the ranch to the east, west and south.
The property was originally donated to the University
by George Morell, a emeritus trustee, in a series of gifts
made from 1961 to 1972 and designed for academic pur
poses.
William Massey, vice president for business and fi
nance, said the only open land now being used for
academic purposes is Jasper Ridge, which is located near
the campus. For this reason there is no need for the
University to hold on to the Black Mountain Ranch
property, Massey said.
The transaction was authorized with the consent of

Morell.
The property represents the only missing piece in a
recreational corridor extending from Saratoga Gap to
Palo Alto's Foothills Park and Page Mill Road. When
considered with nearby open space land, it will com
plete a continuous greenbelt of more than 6000 acres.
The continued use of the land as open space is in
accordance with the General Plan of Palo Alto. The site
will remain open to hikers and equestrians.
The property is open grassland which drops off
steeply into the 1000-foot deep Stevens Creek canyon.
Peterson High School in Sunnyvale is currently using
the property for an environmental awareness program.
Other use is limited to a small number of cattle which
graze there.
Additions to the Monte Bello Open Space Preserve
constituted the MROSD's 1976 State Park Bond Fund
application, and it is anticipated that the full purchase
price will be reimbursed by the state.
