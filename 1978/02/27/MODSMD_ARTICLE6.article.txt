# UC-Davis seminar assesses human rights policy
## 
### Katherine Ellison 
International human rights will always be a problem,
said Patricia Derian, assistant secretary for human rights
and humanitarian affairs for the U.S. State Department.
Derian said the Carter administration is trying to in
fuse a consideration of human rights into every level of
the foreign policy bureaucracy.
She said President Jimmy Carter has a personal com
mitment to the new policy effort to reevaluate U.S. milit
ary assistance to other countries on the basis of their
observance of rights guaranteed in their own constitu
tions.
Derian spoke Friday at a two-day UC-Davis extension
course entitled, "Human Rights and U.S. Foreign Pol
icy."
Richard Fagen, a political science professor at Stan
ford, gave a lecture on "Human Rights in Chile and
Cuba" at the Davis course.
Chilean policy crucial
Fagen called the domestic policies of Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet "the easiest test case" for Carter's
foreign policy.
The United States should withdraw all aid to Chile,
Fagen said, because of the "totality of the wretched
ness" of Pinochet's policies and the "historic responsi
bility" of the U.S. government for his installation. He
advised against breaking all relations with Chile, how
ever.
The weekend course on human rights combined lec
tures, workshops and discussion sections. It was spon
sored by the UC-Davis University Extension Office, the
World Affairs Council of Northern California and the
American Civil Liberties Union. An estimated 350 per
sons attended the seminar.
Ugandan anarchy
Ali Mazrui, a professor at the University of Leeds in
England, spoke on human rights in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Mazrui, formerly a dean at a Ugandan university, de
scribed a combination of "tyranny and anarchy" in
Uganda and said "in the last three years more people
have died because of the anarchy than because of the
tyranny."

Mazrui said a U.S. policy of retribution in Uganda
must include a reconstructive element to prevent
another Idi Amin from coming to power once Amin is
displaced.
"It would not be morally consistent if the United
States took action in Uganda and not in South Africa,"
Mazrui said.
Favors corporate withdrawal
He also advocated the withdrawal of U.S. firms from
South Africa. Unless firms take "dramatic, defiant action
within South Af rica, they might as well get out," he said.
He said that corporate propaganda about corrective so
cial measures has outweighed actual efforts at changing
the current regime.
Other speakers at the conference included Michael
Harrington, a political analyst who authored "The Other
America"; Andrei Amalrik, an exiled Soviet playwright;
Frank Newman, associate justice of the California Sup
reme Court, and Wendy Turnbull and Martin Birch, rep
resentatives of Amnesty International from San Fran
cisco and Davis.
In addition to discussions of U.S. policy toward Africa
and Latin America, the conference featured workshops
on Iran, the Philippines, the Soviet Union, native Ameri
cans and alien immigration.
Protest
Several groups gathered outside the conference to
distribute literature and protest the exclusion of several
topics from the discussions at the seminar.
Two representatives of the Palestinian Human Rights
Committee said a request to hold a workshop on human
rights had been denied because it would lead to a dis
cussion of rights in the Arab world.
"Their suggestion was one out of 75, of which only 17
could be chosen in the end," said George Shaw, or
ganizer of the conference.
A group of native Americans burned incense and beat
a drum Friday afternoon to call attention to their claim of
inadequate representation at the conference.
A number of posters outside the main hall of the
conference denounced the current administration's
Iranian policy.

ever.
The weekend course on human rights combined lec
tures, workshops and discussion sections. It was spon
sored by the UC-Davis University Extension Office, the
World Affairs Council of Northern California and the
American Civil Liberties Union. An estimated 350 per
sons attended the seminar.
Ugandan anarchy
Ali Mazrui, a professor at the University of Leeds in
England, spoke on human rights in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Mazrui, formerly a dean at a Ugandan university, de
scribed a combination of "tyranny and anarchy" in
Uganda and said "in the last three years more people
have died because of the anarchy than because of the
tyranny."

Mazrui said a U.S. policy of retribution in Uganda
must include a reconstructive element to prevent
another Idi Amin from coming to power once Amin is
displaced.
"It would not be morally consistent if the United
States took action in Uganda and not in South Africa,"
Mazrui said.
Favors corporate withdrawal
He also advocated the withdrawal of U.S. firms from
South Africa. Unless firms take "dramatic, defiant action
within South Af rica, they might as well get out," he said.
He said that corporate propaganda about corrective so
cial measures has outweighed actual efforts at changing
the current regime.
Other speakers at the conference included Michael
Harrington, a political analyst who authored "The Other
America"; Andrei Amalrik, an exiled Soviet playwright;
Frank Newman, associate justice of the California Sup
reme Court, and Wendy Turnbull and Martin Birch, rep
resentatives of Amnesty International from San Fran
cisco and Davis.
In addition to discussions of U.S. policy toward Africa
and Latin America, the conference featured workshops
on Iran, the Philippines, the Soviet Union, native Ameri
cans and alien immigration.
Protest
Several groups gathered outside the conference to
distribute literature and protest the exclusion of several
topics from the discussions at the seminar.
Two representatives of the Palestinian Human Rights
Committee said a request to hold a workshop on human
rights had been denied because it would lead to a dis
cussion of rights in the Arab world.
"Their suggestion was one out of 75, of which only 17
could be chosen in the end," said George Shaw, or
ganizer of the conference.
A group of native Americans burned incense and beat
a drum Friday afternoon to call attention to their claim of
inadequate representation at the conference.
A number of posters outside the main hall of the
conference denounced the current administration's
Iranian policy.

Ali Mazrui, professor at the University of Leeds in England was one of many
speakers at a UC-Davis seminar on international human rights. Topics discussed
included U.S. policy towards Africa and Latin America. Political Science Prof.
Richard Fagen spoke on Chile and Cuba.
International human rights will always be a problem,
said Patricia Derian, assistant secretary for human rights
and humanitarian affairs for the U.S. State Department.
Derian said the Carter administration is trying to in
fuse a consideration of human rights into every level of
the foreign policy bureaucracy.
She said President Jimmy Carter has a personal com
mitment to the new policy effort to reevaluate U.S. milit
ary assistance to other countries on the basis of their
observance of rights guaranteed in their own constitu
tions.
Derian spoke Friday at a two-day UC-Davis extension
course entitled, "Human Rights and U.S. Foreign Pol
icy."
Richard Fagen, a political science professor at Stan
ford, gave a lecture on "Human Rights in Chile and
Cuba" at the Davis course.
Chilean policy crucial
Fagen called the domestic policies of Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet "the easiest test case" for Carter's
foreign policy.
The United States should withdraw all aid to Chile,
Fagen said, because of the "totality of the wretched
ness" of Pinochet's policies and the "historic responsi
bility" of the U.S. government for his installation. He
advised against breaking all relations with Chile, how
ever.
