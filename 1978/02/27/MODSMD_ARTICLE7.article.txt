II Retain your hope
Michael Jennings' lament over the state of society and
rationalization of nis move *o drop out of school left me
with vague feelings of anger at his lack of tolerance for
humanity and his overwhelming self-righteousness.
John Larmer resolved these feelings when, in his sup
porting letter (Feb. 22), he wrote: . . how many
people read and thought about what (Jennings) said?
Not many — and few of those will let any visions of
apocalypse spoil their midterms. Sadly only those who
agreed with the article . . . took the time to understand
it." Damn right I'm not going to let it spoil my midterms.
I categorically deny that I am brainwashed by our
society, victimized by our institutions, blind to the
ecological destruction of our planet, deaf to the cries
of the oppressed and hungry, or apathetic to the plight
of a world hovering on the brink of Armageddon. These
things - 1 must deny because in every other way I repre
sent the type of person for whose sins Jennings suffers
so.
I am a confirmed materialist and hedonist. I fully in
tend to scratch my way through Stanford and then a
professional school and thereafter to make a lot of
money. I will live the normal affluent life of the American
middle class.
While I refuse to become a martyr to Madison Avenue
and the ICBM, as Jennings has done, I will nevertheless
be able to work to halt the destruction of our natural
environment, feed the starving, free the chained,
further the cause of world peace and yet sti II have time to
"enjoy the scenery." I further maintain that I will be
more effective from my position within society than will
Jennings as a dropout.
For I perceive two pieces of the puzzle that these
problems represent that Jennings does not: 1) The nor
mal everyday functions of society must continue even as
we work to cure the Earth's ills, and 2) Working within
the system, especially in the United States, is more often
than not the best way to effectuate change.
Jennings would apparently have us all drop out of
society, thereby rejecting the institutions and mentality
that has led the world to the Eve of Destruction.
These institutions, however, have no life in and of
themselves. People created them, people run them, and
only people can change them. Simply abandoning them
will leave only chaos to compound the rest of our trou
bles. Likewise, the mysterious "they" — those in power
— are human beings like ourselves. If indeed they all
share some sort of malignant thought process that is
victimizing the rest of society then they must be re
placed.
Dropping out of "the system" and rejecting the lifes
tyle of mainstream America has effectively removed
from Jennings any hope of reaching a position of leader
ship or influence from which he could change things for
the better. Unless Jennings is willing to take up arms in
rebellion, changewill come from within our institutions.
Fortunately, America is rich in opportunities for the in
dividual exercise of influence.
No, Mr. Jennings, my car is not adorned with a
bumpersticker reading, "America, Love It Or Leave It." I
know we have our problems, but I retain some confi
dence in human integrity, a little faith in our capabilities,
and a lot of hope.

Academic salt mines |
Academia is a peculiar institution. No one ever talks
with anyone else around here.
Think about it. Professors lecture at their classes, and
produce endless scholarly monographs. But how many
students ever talk with their instructors — or even with
each other — to share a chuckle, or a dream, or a sor
row?
Students live strangely individual lives. We are all solo
pilots, winging our way through the pervasive solitude
of this place. We bury noses in books, seeking en
lightenment in dark, secluded corners. We frantically
scribble illegible chickentracks on reams of paper,
which we discard after finals are over.
Then, we emerge from the academic salt mines with
... an EDUCATION (even a JOB, too, with luck). But,
waitaminute. Letmescratch myheadandthinkthisout.
I sold my books, junked my typewriter, and threw out
my chickentracks; so where's my EDUCATION? It's got
to be more than a hole in my wallet. Maybe we can
decide where this EDUCATION thing went if we dis
cover how we got it originally.
'Nah ... gotta study'
Let's see ... I studied, I grasped, I questioned, I
pondered. I communed with my books like a guru with
his navel. What great thoughts I thought, what mysteries
I explored! Ignore my books? "Nah— gotta study."
What of the friends I didn't make, the political move
ments I never joined, the dramas I never played, the
tears I njever shed? What of life's surging ebb and flow,
it's sharing, and its vast, warm, wonderful infinity? "Nah
— gotta study."
Hmmmm. I can think, define, reason, analyze, or
ganize and reify. (I bet you don't know how to reify!) But
did I learn to judge? Was I taught to decide right and
wrong, ethical and perverse, important and petty? Did I
learn creativity? Hmmmm.
I wonder how I missed learning sensitivity to others'
emotions and needs, and to my own. Where in this
EDUCATION thing did I discern the meaning of a hand
shake ... or a tear?
Good readers, pardon my rhetoric. It's an occupa
tional hazard around here. The human institution that'
this University represents has, in truth, enriched our
undergraduate lives, and what we'll take out is largely a
measure of what we put in. With the skills it gives us as
part of our EDUCATION, we seniors can go out and
make a million, discoverSUCCESS, and makeourcollec
tive mark on the universe.
Recalling how to live
Meanwhile, what did we forego? As the economist
says, what was our opportunity cost for that vaunted
EDUCATION? I, for one, am saddened by thecost. I may
just decide to go and live for a few years — to prove I still
remember how.
Enjoyment, understandingand compassion; theseare
the vital untaught skills. Without them the others we
learn here don't work.
So: worry about pollution, support the U.N., join the
Peace Corps, sit-in at the Old Union, exercise, write
your congressman. Try-out for a play, join a church,
raise your consciousness, don't litter. . .go tell a friend
that you really do care. In the end, only the vital human
applications of our EDUCATION are worth our efforts.

II Retain your hope
Michael Jennings' lament over the state of society and
rationalization of nis move *o drop out of school left me
with vague feelings of anger at his lack of tolerance for
humanity and his overwhelming self-righteousness.
John Larmer resolved these feelings when, in his sup
porting letter (Feb. 22), he wrote: . . how many
people read and thought about what (Jennings) said?
Not many — and few of those will let any visions of
apocalypse spoil their midterms. Sadly only those who
agreed with the article . . . took the time to understand
it." Damn right I'm not going to let it spoil my midterms.
I categorically deny that I am brainwashed by our
society, victimized by our institutions, blind to the
ecological destruction of our planet, deaf to the cries
of the oppressed and hungry, or apathetic to the plight
of a world hovering on the brink of Armageddon. These
things - 1 must deny because in every other way I repre
sent the type of person for whose sins Jennings suffers
so.
I am a confirmed materialist and hedonist. I fully in
tend to scratch my way through Stanford and then a
professional school and thereafter to make a lot of
money. I will live the normal affluent life of the American
middle class.
While I refuse to become a martyr to Madison Avenue
and the ICBM, as Jennings has done, I will nevertheless
be able to work to halt the destruction of our natural
environment, feed the starving, free the chained,
further the cause of world peace and yet sti II have time to
"enjoy the scenery." I further maintain that I will be
more effective from my position within society than will
Jennings as a dropout.
For I perceive two pieces of the puzzle that these
problems represent that Jennings does not: 1) The nor
mal everyday functions of society must continue even as
we work to cure the Earth's ills, and 2) Working within
the system, especially in the United States, is more often
than not the best way to effectuate change.
Jennings would apparently have us all drop out of
society, thereby rejecting the institutions and mentality
that has led the world to the Eve of Destruction.
These institutions, however, have no life in and of
themselves. People created them, people run them, and
only people can change them. Simply abandoning them
will leave only chaos to compound the rest of our trou
bles. Likewise, the mysterious "they" — those in power
— are human beings like ourselves. If indeed they all
share some sort of malignant thought process that is
victimizing the rest of society then they must be re
placed.
Dropping out of "the system" and rejecting the lifes
tyle of mainstream America has effectively removed
from Jennings any hope of reaching a position of leader
ship or influence from which he could change things for
the better. Unless Jennings is willing to take up arms in
rebellion, changewill come from within our institutions.
Fortunately, America is rich in opportunities for the in
dividual exercise of influence.
No, Mr. Jennings, my car is not adorned with a
bumpersticker reading, "America, Love It Or Leave It." I
know we have our problems, but I retain some confi
dence in human integrity, a little faith in our capabilities,
and a lot of hope.

Academic salt mines |
Academia is a peculiar institution. No one ever talks
with anyone else around here.
Think about it. Professors lecture at their classes, and
produce endless scholarly monographs. But how many
students ever talk with their instructors — or even with
each other — to share a chuckle, or a dream, or a sor
row?
Students live strangely individual lives. We are all solo
pilots, winging our way through the pervasive solitude
of this place. We bury noses in books, seeking en
lightenment in dark, secluded corners. We frantically
scribble illegible chickentracks on reams of paper,
which we discard after finals are over.
Then, we emerge from the academic salt mines with
... an EDUCATION (even a JOB, too, with luck). But,
waitaminute. Letmescratch myheadandthinkthisout.
I sold my books, junked my typewriter, and threw out
my chickentracks; so where's my EDUCATION? It's got
to be more than a hole in my wallet. Maybe we can
decide where this EDUCATION thing went if we dis
cover how we got it originally.
'Nah ... gotta study'
Let's see ... I studied, I grasped, I questioned, I
pondered. I communed with my books like a guru with
his navel. What great thoughts I thought, what mysteries
I explored! Ignore my books? "Nah— gotta study."
What of the friends I didn't make, the political move
ments I never joined, the dramas I never played, the
tears I njever shed? What of life's surging ebb and flow,
it's sharing, and its vast, warm, wonderful infinity? "Nah
— gotta study."
Hmmmm. I can think, define, reason, analyze, or
ganize and reify. (I bet you don't know how to reify!) But
did I learn to judge? Was I taught to decide right and
wrong, ethical and perverse, important and petty? Did I
learn creativity? Hmmmm.
I wonder how I missed learning sensitivity to others'
emotions and needs, and to my own. Where in this
EDUCATION thing did I discern the meaning of a hand
shake ... or a tear?
Good readers, pardon my rhetoric. It's an occupa
tional hazard around here. The human institution that'
this University represents has, in truth, enriched our
undergraduate lives, and what we'll take out is largely a
measure of what we put in. With the skills it gives us as
part of our EDUCATION, we seniors can go out and
make a million, discoverSUCCESS, and makeourcollec
tive mark on the universe.
Recalling how to live
Meanwhile, what did we forego? As the economist
says, what was our opportunity cost for that vaunted
EDUCATION? I, for one, am saddened by thecost. I may
just decide to go and live for a few years — to prove I still
remember how.
Enjoyment, understandingand compassion; theseare
the vital untaught skills. Without them the others we
learn here don't work.
So: worry about pollution, support the U.N., join the
Peace Corps, sit-in at the Old Union, exercise, write
your congressman. Try-out for a play, join a church,
raise your consciousness, don't litter. . .go tell a friend

says, what was our opportunity cost for that vaunted
EDUCATION? I, for one, am saddened by thecost. I may
just decide to go and live for a few years — to prove I still
remember how.
Enjoyment, understandingand compassion; theseare
the vital untaught skills. Without them the others we
learn here don't work.
So: worry about pollution, support the U.N., join the
Peace Corps, sit-in at the Old Union, exercise, write
your congressman. Try-out for a play, join a church,
raise your consciousness, don't litter. . .go tell a friend
that you really do care. In the end, only the vital human
applications of our EDUCATION are worth our efforts.

II Retain your hope
Michael Jennings' lament over the state of society and
rationalization of nis move *o drop out of school left me
with vague feelings of anger at his lack of tolerance for
humanity and his overwhelming self-righteousness.
John Larmer resolved these feelings when, in his sup
porting letter (Feb. 22), he wrote: . . how many
people read and thought about what (Jennings) said?
Not many — and few of those will let any visions of
apocalypse spoil their midterms. Sadly only those who
agreed with the article . . . took the time to understand
it." Damn right I'm not going to let it spoil my midterms.
I categorically deny that I am brainwashed by our
society, victimized by our institutions, blind to the
ecological destruction of our planet, deaf to the cries
of the oppressed and hungry, or apathetic to the plight
of a world hovering on the brink of Armageddon. These
things - 1 must deny because in every other way I repre
sent the type of person for whose sins Jennings suffers
so.
I am a confirmed materialist and hedonist. I fully in
tend to scratch my way through Stanford and then a
professional school and thereafter to make a lot of
money. I will live the normal affluent life of the American
middle class.
While I refuse to become a martyr to Madison Avenue
and the ICBM, as Jennings has done, I will nevertheless
be able to work to halt the destruction of our natural
environment, feed the starving, free the chained,
further the cause of world peace and yet sti II have time to
"enjoy the scenery." I further maintain that I will be
more effective from my position within society than will
Jennings as a dropout.
For I perceive two pieces of the puzzle that these
problems represent that Jennings does not: 1) The nor
mal everyday functions of society must continue even as
we work to cure the Earth's ills, and 2) Working within
the system, especially in the United States, is more often
than not the best way to effectuate change.
Jennings would apparently have us all drop out of
society, thereby rejecting the institutions and mentality
that has led the world to the Eve of Destruction.
These institutions, however, have no life in and of
themselves. People created them, people run them, and
only people can change them. Simply abandoning them
will leave only chaos to compound the rest of our trou
bles. Likewise, the mysterious "they" — those in power
— are human beings like ourselves. If indeed they all
share some sort of malignant thought process that is
victimizing the rest of society then they must be re
placed.
Dropping out of "the system" and rejecting the lifes
tyle of mainstream America has effectively removed
from Jennings any hope of reaching a position of leader
ship or influence from which he could change things for
the better. Unless Jennings is willing to take up arms in
rebellion, changewill come from within our institutions.
Fortunately, America is rich in opportunities for the in
dividual exercise of influence.
No, Mr. Jennings, my car is not adorned with a
bumpersticker reading, "America, Love It Or Leave It." I
know we have our problems, but I retain some confi
dence in human integrity, a little faith in our capabilities,
and a lot of hope.

Academic salt mines |
Academia is a peculiar institution. No one ever talks
with anyone else around here.
Think about it. Professors lecture at their classes, and
produce endless scholarly monographs. But how many
students ever talk with their instructors — or even with
each other — to share a chuckle, or a dream, or a sor
row?
Students live strangely individual lives. We are all solo
pilots, winging our way through the pervasive solitude
of this place. We bury noses in books, seeking en
lightenment in dark, secluded corners. We frantically
scribble illegible chickentracks on reams of paper,
which we discard after finals are over.
Then, we emerge from the academic salt mines with
... an EDUCATION (even a JOB, too, with luck). But,
waitaminute. Letmescratch myheadandthinkthisout.
I sold my books, junked my typewriter, and threw out
my chickentracks; so where's my EDUCATION? It's got
to be more than a hole in my wallet. Maybe we can
decide where this EDUCATION thing went if we dis
cover how we got it originally.
'Nah ... gotta study'
Let's see ... I studied, I grasped, I questioned, I
pondered. I communed with my books like a guru with
his navel. What great thoughts I thought, what mysteries
I explored! Ignore my books? "Nah— gotta study."
What of the friends I didn't make, the political move
ments I never joined, the dramas I never played, the
tears I njever shed? What of life's surging ebb and flow,
it's sharing, and its vast, warm, wonderful infinity? "Nah
— gotta study."
Hmmmm. I can think, define, reason, analyze, or
ganize and reify. (I bet you don't know how to reify!) But
did I learn to judge? Was I taught to decide right and
wrong, ethical and perverse, important and petty? Did I
learn creativity? Hmmmm.
I wonder how I missed learning sensitivity to others'
emotions and needs, and to my own. Where in this
EDUCATION thing did I discern the meaning of a hand
shake ... or a tear?
Good readers, pardon my rhetoric. It's an occupa
tional hazard around here. The human institution that'
this University represents has, in truth, enriched our
undergraduate lives, and what we'll take out is largely a
measure of what we put in. With the skills it gives us as
part of our EDUCATION, we seniors can go out and
make a million, discoverSUCCESS, and makeourcollec
tive mark on the universe.
