♦ Article XXVII
Passed by Congress Dec. 25, 1981
Ratified Dec. 25, 1984
Sec. 1. The First through Tenth Ar
ticles of amendment shall not apply
to all persons who are homosexuals,
Communists, atheists, or believers in
paganism; nor to any persons who
refuse to take an oath of allegiance to
the New Testament of the Holy Bible
and to Our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ.
Sec. 2. Congress shall have the
power to enforce this Article by ap
propriate legislation.
Can it happen here?
Consider:
— During the Anita Bryant cam
paign, a Bryant acolyte admitted re
luctantly to a New Times reporter
that homosexuals have a right to exist
— "as longas they stay in the closet."
— Last month the National Associ
ation of Religious Broadcasters
started to organize a massive mail
and-phone campaign to purge net
work television of any material they
don't happen to like. According to
Newsweek, the campaign will in
clude an attempt to organize the na
tion's Christians into a massive pres
sure group.

— In a chilling letter to Time
magazine, the editor of Christianity
Today said that the American
evangelical movement must
"change" major American institu
tions (he specifically mentioned uni
versities) which "go their own way
without significant repentance or
alteration." And in a similar letter to
the Daily last year, a born-again
asked very un-rhetorically: "Is it wise
to see the separation of church and
state as an absolute?"
Today's Christians, in short, could
very possibly become tomorrow's
dictators.
Legal favoritism
That Christian fellowwas right, in a
sense. Separation of church and
state is not an absolute; it is merely
whatever the U.S. Supreme Court
chooses to make of the first 10 words
of the First Amendment ("Congress
shall make no law affecting an estab
lishment of religion"). And as Clar
ence Darrow dryly remarked: "The
First Amendment guarantees free
dom of religion, not freedom from
it."
The Supreme Court can block the
most blatant encroachments on the
First Amendment, such as prayer in

public schools. But when the issue is
attempts to discriminate against ob
viously non-Christian minorities,
such as homosexuals and Com
munists, the court is relatively pow
erless.
What is worse, when faced with a
constitutional amendment, the court
is completely powerless. Prohibition
of alcohol was mandated by a con
stitutional amendment; some born
agains are trying to ban abortion by
the same process, among them U.S.
Rep. Henry Hyde (R-lll.). So Christ
ians have, in many cases, an unclear
legal climate on their side.
They also have on their side a very
clear, and very highly charged, emo
tional climate — and emotion is two
thirds of politics. The Christian cry
"Abortion is murder!" speaks for it
self on this point; so does the Bryant
campaign; so does the phenomenon
of an unknown state governor shout
ing "Hallelujah!" all the way to the
White' House.
Life unfair
jimmy Carter, of course, has
enough scruples (he might call them
"Christian ethics") to keep from im
posing his superstition on the nation
too often. But sometimes it does leak

through. For example, when asked
whether it was unfair to deny poor
women the right to abortion by cut
ting off Medicare funds for that pur
pose, Carter replied curtly, "There
are many things in life that are un
fair." And has everyone forgotten
how he told government employees
to "stop living in sin" and get mar
ried?
The point is that any Christian
policymaker must fight a constant
battle between his sense of fairness
to those who do not share his supers
tition, and what he thinks is his obli
gation to )esus Christ. Some, like
Carter, will strike a balance most (but
not all) of the time. Others, like
Bryant, will not even try to strike such
a balance; they see those who disag
ree with them as erring children who
must be set on the right path. And if
the Anita Bryants or — far worse —
the Elmer Gantrys get into power,
how will they deal with the nation's
"erring children?"
Evangelical aristocracy
Don't laugh and say, "Anita Bryant
won't become president, nor will
anyone who shares her fanaticism."
Zealous Christians, whether they're
benighted or just plain hypocritical,
tend to be highly disciplined and
motivated people. Moreover, Christ
ians across the nation are becoming
more and more aware of their politi
cal power (most polls put them at
about a 63-35 majority over out-and
out nonbelievers).
In this age of telecommunications,
mobilizing such a political force
would be easier than at any other
time in our history. The American
evangelical movement as a whole is
already on the verge of possessing a
nationwide telecommunications
network nearly as sophisticated as
any corporate one.
In "Elmer Gantry," the title charac
ter dreams at one point of combining
the nation's religious organizations
into a huge political party, with him
self as head. "Not even Napoleon or
Alexander had been able to dictate
what a whole nation should eat or
wear or say or think," Sinclair Lewis
writes. "This, Elmer Gantry was
about to do . . . 'I'm going to be em
peror of America — maybe of the
world!' he exulted."
Of course, if rule by religion ever
comes, it may not be as bad as all
that. But can those of us who believe
in ruie by reason take that chance?
