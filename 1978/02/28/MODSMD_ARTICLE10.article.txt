Protect land
Plans have recently been an
nounced in local newspapers (Daily,
Feb. 7) of Stanford's intention to
build about 1200 housing units of a 46
acre site. The land is located along
Willow Road between the Oak Creek
Apartments and the Children's Hos
pital. It is presently open grassland,
and by consulting a topographical
map it's seen that this is the last un
developed piece of land along San
Francisquito Creek between the bay
and Highway 280.
Stanford's land use policy states
explicitly that its land resources be

used for educational purposes. A
long tradition of adhering to that pol
icy has maintained University land as
a green belt extending from the
creek out to lasper Ridge even
though surrounding communities
have developed heavily.
This extended, non-developed
zone is conducive to a healthy
wildlife population and it is an in
valuable resource for biological
studies, recreation, cleaner air, anda
pleasant working environment for
the Stanford community. It is not in
the best long-term interests of Stan
ford to opt for more housing and the

resulting rent profits at the expense
of its beautiful, open air campus.
Especially alarming, the construc
tion of the apartments along with the
widening of Willow Road would to
tally transform the area from open
pasture to a congested sprawl of 1000
apartments, housing thousands of
people, and thousands of cars. Stan
ford must protect more closely its
open land, a most valuable endow
ment and asset.
