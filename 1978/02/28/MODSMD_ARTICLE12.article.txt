# Student activism taking new directions

Alison Smale, (Feb. 14, Daily) at
tempted a "News Analysis" of stu
dent activism. I must respond to her
article because I do not feel, that by
standards of journalism, she has writ
ten an adequate analysis.
I think Smale missed what she set
out to learn in the writing of her arti
cle: that is, where students have
turned their energies since the real
frustration of the Vietnam war. Has
that anger with the American system
and the desire to have the power to
control our own lives been chan
neled into the desperation of "look
ing out for number one"? Or has
student activism undergone certain
political changes since the war and
reorganized itself?
The article centers around the
SCRIP sit-in of last May as a primary
example of student activism. It
seems to be implicitly assumed that
only a sit-in is evidence of protest or
activism, that SCRIP is the only Stan
ford organization with activist mem
bers, and that this sort of activism is
an exceptional event. Because the ar
ticle ends (either by editing or
Smale's intention) with Marv Her
rington's quote, the sense of the
reader is that SCRIP activists are led
by a romantic and quixotic vision of
protest in these new days of student
conservatism when the 1976 Daily
staff goes drinking past 4 a.m. with
professional journalism fellows.
Basic error
A basic error is to associate activism
with only direct action and resis
tance. Smale does hypothesize that
the issues important today on the
campus are ones not to be resolved
with violence. But neither those is
sues or groups that might be dealing
with important issues in a non

violent manner are discussed.
Is Bob Beyers the only spokesper
son on student activism? Surely his
long career at Stanford and repor
tage of campus events give him a
perspective of student activism over
the last decade, but why were more
SCRIP members not interviewed to
better understand the apparently
"passive" nature of their arrests,
their reasons for becoming active,
and how or why they have chosen to
stay active?
A news analysis that really
explored the conventional wisdom
of the new student conservatism
would be a great service to us all. lam
profoundly disturbed that Smale's
analysis seems to have been guided
by this very assumption that Stanford
students are interested only in jobs.
Contrary to this notion, there are a
variety of committed and effective
activist groups on campus. These
groups seek to organize effectively
for many goals, to educate students,
workers and faculty, and to confront
the administration in a non-violent
manner.
Many student activists, because
they are acting from convictions
which come from direct experience,
and because they are interested in
being successful in theirpolitics, have
studied and learned from the 60's.
There have been deep and important
changes in how students organize
themselves.
Grassroots style
SCRIP is activist because it sees an
issue and is working to educate and
organize students around Stanford's
investment policy in a grassroots
political style. SCRIP'S style of ac
tivism evolved from the 60's because
it has chosen to not be a vanguard
group. Most of SCRIP'S policy has
been painstakingly formed with the
intention of reaching out to the
whole campus. SCRIP is also more
active and aware than earlier student
groups such as the SDS in its internal
organization. It is run democratically
and attempts to deal with its own ra
cism and sexism.
In addition to SCRIP, there is a rich
diversity of organizations at Stanford
that are leftist, radical, liberal — and
activist. Although they are often
grouped together as "the radicals," it
is an injustice to Stanford activists
not to recognize the many differ
ences of ideology, organization and
issues that their activism encompas
ses. Stanford has Marxist-Leninists,
Maoists, undefined socialists,
anarchists, radicals, many types of
feminists and liberals among its ac

tivists on the left, and libertarians
and the CSU are among the activists
on the right.
New representation
On the left, why did Smale not
mention the Stanford Organizing
Committee and the groups rep
resented in it? Most of these groups
perceive themselves to be progres
sive and/or activist. Half the Sky, a
women's coalition, and SOC itself
are only just now approaching their
first birthdays. Are they not rep
resentative of new student activism,
being coalitions of previously unun
ited groups?
Women on campus have been
especially active in this last year. The
first edition of "Aurora," rape work
shops on campus, the search for a
new home for the women's center,
and Women's Week are all the result
of substantial work and organization
on the part of activists.
The International Students Associ
ation is currently sponsoring an ex
cellent film series. Students in
terested in energy have set up a re
cycling center with the help of a busy
COP and organized Critical Mass, a
week of looking at nuclear energy.
In addition to this list (which is by

no means exhaustive) I only might
add that there are SWOPSI courses
being taught this quarter on sexism,
political theatre, and science and
public control of technology.
As for the activists Smale concen
trated her article on, (only a small
part of a large and lively community),
were they motivated by a romantic
visin of protest? No. We were, and
still are, actively committed to a
common goal, whoever our leaders
and followers be.
There are many activists on this
campus committed to many impor
tan goals and working very hard. Not
everything that activists do attracts
the media — research, internal edu
cation, reaching our decisions in a
democratic manner and working
through the system (yes, we do that
sometimes) don't get coverage.
Maybe if people learned of and un
derstood all these efforts that ex
press active protest, they wouldn't
think that the end result of months of
labor was a publicity stunt.
Maybe they wouldn't overlook all
the activists who are working and
quietly succeeding.

Basic error
A basic error is to associate activism
with only direct action and resis
tance. Smale does hypothesize that
the issues important today on the
campus are ones not to be resolved
with violence. But neither those is
sues or groups that might be dealing
with important issues in a non

violent manner are discussed.
Is Bob Beyers the only spokesper
son on student activism? Surely his
long career at Stanford and repor
tage of campus events give him a
perspective of student activism over
the last decade, but why were more
SCRIP members not interviewed to
better understand the apparently
"passive" nature of their arrests,
their reasons for becoming active,
and how or why they have chosen to
stay active?
A news analysis that really
explored the conventional wisdom
of the new student conservatism
would be a great service to us all. lam
profoundly disturbed that Smale's
analysis seems to have been guided
by this very assumption that Stanford
students are interested only in jobs.
Contrary to this notion, there are a
variety of committed and effective
activist groups on campus. These
groups seek to organize effectively
for many goals, to educate students,
workers and faculty, and to confront
the administration in a non-violent
manner.
Many student activists, because
they are acting from convictions
which come from direct experience,
and because they are interested in
being successful in theirpolitics, have
studied and learned from the 60's.
There have been deep and important
changes in how students organize
themselves.
Grassroots style
SCRIP is activist because it sees an
issue and is working to educate and
organize students around Stanford's
investment policy in a grassroots
political style. SCRIP'S style of ac
tivism evolved from the 60's because
it has chosen to not be a vanguard
group. Most of SCRIP'S policy has
been painstakingly formed with the
intention of reaching out to the
whole campus. SCRIP is also more
active and aware than earlier student
groups such as the SDS in its internal
organization. It is run democratically
and attempts to deal with its own ra
cism and sexism.
In addition to SCRIP, there is a rich
diversity of organizations at Stanford
that are leftist, radical, liberal — and
activist. Although they are often
grouped together as "the radicals," it
is an injustice to Stanford activists
not to recognize the many differ
ences of ideology, organization and
issues that their activism encompas
ses. Stanford has Marxist-Leninists,
Maoists, undefined socialists,
anarchists, radicals, many types of
feminists and liberals among its ac

tivists on the left, and libertarians
and the CSU are among the activists
on the right.
New representation
On the left, why did Smale not
mention the Stanford Organizing
Committee and the groups rep
resented in it? Most of these groups
perceive themselves to be progres
sive and/or activist. Half the Sky, a
women's coalition, and SOC itself
are only just now approaching their
first birthdays. Are they not rep
resentative of new student activism,
being coalitions of previously unun
ited groups?
Women on campus have been
especially active in this last year. The
first edition of "Aurora," rape work
shops on campus, the search for a
new home for the women's center,
and Women's Week are all the result
of substantial work and organization
on the part of activists.
The International Students Associ
ation is currently sponsoring an ex
cellent film series. Students in
terested in energy have set up a re
cycling center with the help of a busy
COP and organized Critical Mass, a
week of looking at nuclear energy.
In addition to this list (which is by

no means exhaustive) I only might
add that there are SWOPSI courses
being taught this quarter on sexism,
political theatre, and science and
public control of technology.
As for the activists Smale concen
trated her article on, (only a small
part of a large and lively community),
were they motivated by a romantic
visin of protest? No. We were, and
still are, actively committed to a
common goal, whoever our leaders
and followers be.
There are many activists on this
campus committed to many impor
tan goals and working very hard. Not
everything that activists do attracts
the media — research, internal edu
cation, reaching our decisions in a
democratic manner and working
through the system (yes, we do that
sometimes) don't get coverage.
Maybe if people learned of and un
derstood all these efforts that ex
press active protest, they wouldn't
think that the end result of months of
labor was a publicity stunt.
Maybe they wouldn't overlook all
the activists who are working and
quietly succeeding.

stay active?

explored the conventional wisdom
of the new student conservatism
would be a great service to us all. lam
profoundly disturbed that Smale's
analysis seems to have been guided
by this very assumption that Stanford
students are interested only in jobs.
Contrary to this notion, there are a
variety of committed and effective
activist groups on campus. These
groups seek to organize effectively
for many goals, to educate students,
workers and faculty, and to confront
the administration in a non-violent
manner.
Many student activists, because
they are acting from convictions
which come from direct experience,
and because they are interested in
being successful in theirpolitics, have
studied and learned from the 60's.
There have been deep and important
changes in how students organize
themselves.
Grassroots style
SCRIP is activist because it sees an
issue and is working to educate and
organize students around Stanford's
investment policy in a grassroots
political style. SCRIP'S style of ac
tivism evolved from the 60's because
it has chosen to not be a vanguard
group. Most of SCRIP'S policy has
been painstakingly formed with the
intention of reaching out to the
whole campus. SCRIP is also more
active and aware than earlier student
groups such as the SDS in its internal
organization. It is run democratically
and attempts to deal with its own ra
cism and sexism.
In addition to SCRIP, there is a rich
diversity of organizations at Stanford
that are leftist, radical, liberal — and
activist. Although they are often
grouped together as "the radicals," it
is an injustice to Stanford activists
not to recognize the many differ
ences of ideology, organization and
issues that their activism encompas
ses. Stanford has Marxist-Leninists,
Maoists, undefined socialists,
anarchists, radicals, many types of
feminists and liberals among its ac

tivists on the left, and libertarians
and the CSU are among the activists
on the right.
New representation
On the left, why did Smale not
mention the Stanford Organizing
Committee and the groups rep
resented in it? Most of these groups
perceive themselves to be progres
sive and/or activist. Half the Sky, a
women's coalition, and SOC itself
are only just now approaching their
first birthdays. Are they not rep
resentative of new student activism,
being coalitions of previously unun
ited groups?
Women on campus have been
especially active in this last year. The
first edition of "Aurora," rape work
shops on campus, the search for a
new home for the women's center,
and Women's Week are all the result
of substantial work and organization
on the part of activists.
The International Students Associ
ation is currently sponsoring an ex
cellent film series. Students in
terested in energy have set up a re
cycling center with the help of a busy
COP and organized Critical Mass, a
week of looking at nuclear energy.
In addition to this list (which is by

no means exhaustive) I only might
add that there are SWOPSI courses
being taught this quarter on sexism,
political theatre, and science and
public control of technology.
As for the activists Smale concen
trated her article on, (only a small
part of a large and lively community),
were they motivated by a romantic
visin of protest? No. We were, and
still are, actively committed to a
common goal, whoever our leaders
and followers be.
There are many activists on this
campus committed to many impor
tan goals and working very hard. Not
everything that activists do attracts
the media — research, internal edu
cation, reaching our decisions in a
democratic manner and working
through the system (yes, we do that
sometimes) don't get coverage.
Maybe if people learned of and un
derstood all these efforts that ex
press active protest, they wouldn't
think that the end result of months of
labor was a publicity stunt.
Maybe they wouldn't overlook all
the activists who are working and
quietly succeeding.

Alison Smale, (Feb. 14, Daily) at
tempted a "News Analysis" of stu
dent activism. I must respond to her
article because I do not feel, that by
standards of journalism, she has writ
ten an adequate analysis.
I think Smale missed what she set
out to learn in the writing of her arti
cle: that is, where students have
turned their energies since the real
frustration of the Vietnam war. Has
that anger with the American system
and the desire to have the power to
control our own lives been chan
neled into the desperation of "look
ing out for number one"? Or has
student activism undergone certain
political changes since the war and
reorganized itself?
The article centers around the
SCRIP sit-in of last May as a primary
example of student activism. It
seems to be implicitly assumed that
only a sit-in is evidence of protest or
activism, that SCRIP is the only Stan
ford organization with activist mem
bers, and that this sort of activism is
an exceptional event. Because the ar
ticle ends (either by editing or
Smale's intention) with Marv Her
rington's quote, the sense of the
reader is that SCRIP activists are led
by a romantic and quixotic vision of
protest in these new days of student
conservatism when the 1976 Daily
staff goes drinking past 4 a.m. with
professional journalism fellows.
Basic error
A basic error is to associate activism
with only direct action and resis
tance. Smale does hypothesize that
the issues important today on the
campus are ones not to be resolved
with violence. But neither those is
sues or groups that might be dealing
with important issues in a non

violent manner are discussed.
Is Bob Beyers the only spokesper
son on student activism? Surely his
long career at Stanford and repor
tage of campus events give him a
perspective of student activism over
the last decade, but why were more
SCRIP members not interviewed to
better understand the apparently
"passive" nature of their arrests,
their reasons for becoming active,
and how or why they have chosen to
stay active?
