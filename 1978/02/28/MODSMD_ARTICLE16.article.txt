## dorm drama/marilyn rosenberg 'Anything Goes' went well 
### 
"It's delightful, it's delicious,
it's delovely!" It's Anything
Goes, performed at Toyon last
weekend.
The show, with music by
Cole Porter, and book by Bol
ton and Wodehouse, is tuneful
and fast-paced. It includes the
familiar songs "You're the
Top," "I Get a Kick out of You,"
"Friendship," and "Blow, Gab
riel, Blow." The story takes
place aboard a ship in the '30s.
Basically, it concerns itself with
the curious relationships bet
ween the ship's passengers.
Toyon's version was beauti
fully staged and produced. Its
director, Tom Bower, deserves
credit for making every minute
of the show interesting. His
clever staging, along with his
addition of a few comic bits,
was largely responsible for the
show's lively pace.
Although
Also contributing to the
show's success was the drama
tic ability of the cast. Without a

single exception, the perfor
mers remained in character
throughout the entire show.
Although each cast member
deserves a word of praise, at
least a line must be devoted to
Michael Myers, starring as Billy
Crocker. Myers stunned the
audience with a captivating
combination of talent, charm,
and poise.
One important blessing they
seem to have missed, how
ever, is vocal strength. With
the exception of Myers, whose
voice is excellent, Drue
Bralove, who projects a good
alto tone, and Doug Green
field, whose comic talent and
loud voice worked well in "Be
Like the Bluebird," the voices
were not strong. The chorus,
and many of the leads, failed to
project their voices. This may
have been the fault of either a
flu epidemic, or the music di
rection.
My suspicion that it may
have been the latter is based

upon my opinion of the or
chestra. Although it deserves
credit for not overpowering
the light voices, it certainly
didn't do justice to the genius
of Cole Porter. A good part of
the time, it was not on pitch or
up to tempo. This was particu
larly obvious in "I Get a Kick
out of You" and "All through
the Night." During "All through
the Night," one audience
member, turning from the
stage to the orchestra, asked
"Are they playing the same
song?"
Despite the show's musical
shortcomings, its choreog
raphy succeeded brilliantly.
Risa Shimoda, the choreog
rapher of this production, was
also one of the three choreog
raphers for Otero's "Anything
Goes" two years ago. Her
choreography for this produc
tion, besides being well
arranged, was wonderfully
executed. By far the most out
standing number was "Any

thing Goes," in which
everyone, including the
chorus, performed a tap
dance.
In short
In short, in terms of
choreography and acting, the
show was a success. These as
pects of the production were
complemented by the cos
tumes, which carefully im
itated '30s fashions, and the
sets, which were also cleverly
designed.
All in all, then, and in their
own words:
"They're the top; they're
Hoover Tower
They're the top; they're a
happy hour
They're the top; they're the
halftime show at a Stanford
game; they're beer
They're the top; they're cardi
nal red, a hot pre-med your
tuition here.
They're the top!

everyone, including the
chorus, performed a tap
dance.
In short
In short, in terms of
choreography and acting, the
show was a success. These as
pects of the production were
complemented by the cos
tumes, which carefully im
itated '30s fashions, and the
sets, which were also cleverly
designed.
All in all, then, and in their
own words:
"They're the top; they're
Hoover Tower
They're the top; they're a
happy hour
They're the top; they're the
halftime show at a Stanford
game; they're beer
They're the top; they're cardi
nal red, a hot pre-med your
tuition here.
They're the top!
"It's delightful, it's delicious,
it's delovely!" It's Anything
Goes, performed at Toyon last
weekend.
The show, with music by
Cole Porter, and book by Bol
ton and Wodehouse, is tuneful
and fast-paced. It includes the
familiar songs "You're the
Top," "I Get a Kick out of You,"
"Friendship," and "Blow, Gab
riel, Blow." The story takes
place aboard a ship in the '30s.
Basically, it concerns itself with
the curious relationships bet
ween the ship's passengers.
Toyon's version was beauti
fully staged and produced. Its
director, Tom Bower, deserves
credit for making every minute
of the show interesting. His
clever staging, along with his
addition of a few comic bits,
was largely responsible for the
show's lively pace.
Although
Also contributing to the
show's success was the drama
tic ability of the cast. Without a

single exception, the perfor
mers remained in character
throughout the entire show.
Although each cast member
deserves a word of praise, at
least a line must be devoted to
Michael Myers, starring as Billy
Crocker. Myers stunned the
audience with a captivating
combination of talent, charm,
and poise.
One important blessing they
seem to have missed, how
ever, is vocal strength. With
the exception of Myers, whose
voice is excellent, Drue
Bralove, who projects a good
alto tone, and Doug Green
field, whose comic talent and
loud voice worked well in "Be
Like the Bluebird," the voices
were not strong. The chorus,
and many of the leads, failed to
project their voices. This may
have been the fault of either a
flu epidemic, or the music di
rection.
My suspicion that it may
have been the latter is based

upon my opinion of the or
chestra. Although it deserves
credit for not overpowering
the light voices, it certainly
didn't do justice to the genius
of Cole Porter. A good part of
the time, it was not on pitch or
up to tempo. This was particu
larly obvious in "I Get a Kick
out of You" and "All through
the Night." During "All through
the Night," one audience
member, turning from the
stage to the orchestra, asked
"Are they playing the same
song?"
Despite the show's musical
shortcomings, its choreog
raphy succeeded brilliantly.
Risa Shimoda, the choreog
rapher of this production, was
also one of the three choreog
raphers for Otero's "Anything
Goes" two years ago. Her
choreography for this produc
tion, besides being well
arranged, was wonderfully
executed. By far the most out
standing number was "Any

thing Goes," in which
everyone, including the
chorus, performed a tap
dance.
