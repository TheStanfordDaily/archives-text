## Let us all praise the NY Winds... 
### 
The New York Woodwind
Quintet consists of Thomas
Nyfenger (flute, piccolo),
Ronald Roseman (oboe), David
Clazner (clarinet), William
Purvis (horn) and Donald Mac
cort (bassoon). They are a
popular group, one that in no
small way has helped renew
considerable interest in music
for wind ensemble. What
makes this quintet so delight
ful to listen to is the combina
tion is just the right propor
tions of brilliance and depth,
and of solistic virtuosity and en
semble in their playing.
Having heard the perfor
mance of the Quintet last Fri
day at Dinkelspiel, one can eas
ily understand the strength
behind such claims to fame.
The program began with

Goldstein's transcription of
Mozart's "Sonata in F for Piano
four hands," K. 497. This
proved an ideal opener with its
generally sunny disposition
and depth of expression. The
arrangement is so idiomatically
done as to sound original. It
clearly emphasizes Mozart's
counterpoint and at the same
time gives the players many
solos. Unfortunately Purvis
seemed to have some trouble
at the outset with some of the
horn solos, but he soon over
came them.
Hindemith
The group really came into
its own with Hindmith's end
lessly fascinating "Kleine
kammermusik" 0p.24, No. 2.
A firmly neoclassicist work, it
gave the players manifold op

portunities to show their skills.
In interpreting this piece it is
important to realize the dark
and agitated spirit which seems
to underlie the surface glitter
and charm throughout, but
which comes especially to the
fore in the last two move
ments. The quintet rose to the
challenge playing with great
beauty and depth, and all giv
ing a good account of them
selves in the solo passages.
As more and more of Vival
di's music is published it be
comes clear just how great an
innovator he was. Witness his
symphonies, perhaps ahead of
those from Mannheim. Wit
ness also the "Concerto in Cm
for Flute, Oboe and Bassoon
continuo." It is unusual in lack
ing strings for the tutti, as well

as being the first work for the
modern woodwinds. The en
semble distinguished itself
once again by the precision
and spirit it brought to the
work. All of the tutti and soli
were carefully balanced and
set off against one another —
a tricky thing with only three
instruments. Maccourt played
his almost solisticcontinuo part
to the hilt, but without in any
way interfering with the sol
oists.
Reicha
The last piece on the prog
ram was "Quintet in D" 0p.91,
No. 3 by Anton Reicha (1770-
1836). As is usual for Reicha the
music is never less than charm
ing, if riot terribly profound.
What characterizes many of
Reicha's ideas is not so much
their intrinsic interest, but his
harmonic inventiveness in
using them. This is seen es
pecially in the impetuous Al
legro vivo with its dotted
rhythms, and in the aggressive
solos, especially a bassoon
passage in the finale. These
were all admirably executed,
but the group distinguished it
self here especially by its excel
lent ensemble.
The quintet was well re
ceived, and after several cur
tain calls gave as an encore "In
Meinem Sinne" by Heinrich Is
saac (1450-1517). While this
work needs to be heard on
period instruments to achieve
its full effect, it did provide a
rousing close for a glorious
performance.

for Flute, Oboe and Bassoon
continuo." It is unusual in lack
ing strings for the tutti, as well

as being the first work for the
modern woodwinds. The en
semble distinguished itself
once again by the precision
and spirit it brought to the
work. All of the tutti and soli
were carefully balanced and
set off against one another —
a tricky thing with only three
instruments. Maccourt played
his almost solisticcontinuo part
to the hilt, but without in any
way interfering with the sol
oists.
Reicha
The last piece on the prog
ram was "Quintet in D" 0p.91,
No. 3 by Anton Reicha (1770-
1836). As is usual for Reicha the
music is never less than charm
ing, if riot terribly profound.
What characterizes many of
Reicha's ideas is not so much
their intrinsic interest, but his
harmonic inventiveness in
using them. This is seen es
pecially in the impetuous Al
legro vivo with its dotted
rhythms, and in the aggressive
solos, especially a bassoon
passage in the finale. These
were all admirably executed,
but the group distinguished it
self here especially by its excel
lent ensemble.
The quintet was well re
ceived, and after several cur
tain calls gave as an encore "In
Meinem Sinne" by Heinrich Is
saac (1450-1517). While this
work needs to be heard on
period instruments to achieve
its full effect, it did provide a
rousing close for a glorious
performance.
The New York Woodwind
Quintet consists of Thomas
Nyfenger (flute, piccolo),
Ronald Roseman (oboe), David
Clazner (clarinet), William
Purvis (horn) and Donald Mac
cort (bassoon). They are a
popular group, one that in no
small way has helped renew
considerable interest in music
for wind ensemble. What
makes this quintet so delight
ful to listen to is the combina
tion is just the right propor
tions of brilliance and depth,
and of solistic virtuosity and en
semble in their playing.
Having heard the perfor
mance of the Quintet last Fri
day at Dinkelspiel, one can eas
ily understand the strength
behind such claims to fame.
The program began with

Goldstein's transcription of
Mozart's "Sonata in F for Piano
four hands," K. 497. This
proved an ideal opener with its
generally sunny disposition
and depth of expression. The
arrangement is so idiomatically
done as to sound original. It
clearly emphasizes Mozart's
counterpoint and at the same
time gives the players many
solos. Unfortunately Purvis
seemed to have some trouble
at the outset with some of the
horn solos, but he soon over
came them.
Hindemith
The group really came into
its own with Hindmith's end
lessly fascinating "Kleine
kammermusik" 0p.24, No. 2.
A firmly neoclassicist work, it
gave the players manifold op

portunities to show their skills.
In interpreting this piece it is
important to realize the dark
and agitated spirit which seems
to underlie the surface glitter
and charm throughout, but
which comes especially to the
fore in the last two move
ments. The quintet rose to the
challenge playing with great
beauty and depth, and all giv
ing a good account of them
selves in the solo passages.
As more and more of Vival
di's music is published it be
comes clear just how great an
innovator he was. Witness his
symphonies, perhaps ahead of
those from Mannheim. Wit
ness also the "Concerto in Cm
for Flute, Oboe and Bassoon
continuo." It is unusual in lack
ing strings for the tutti, as well

as being the first work for the
modern woodwinds. The en
semble distinguished itself
