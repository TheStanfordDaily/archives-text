# Bunzel leaves S.J. State for Hoover
## 
### Rob Lempert 
It is fairly common to hear of a pro
fessor who leaves his research to
take an administrative post, but not
often doesan administratorvoluntar
ily retire to do research on his old
job.
John Bunzel, president of San
jose State University, is doing just
that. Effective Aug. 31, he will leave
San lose to become a Senior Re
search Fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion.
Bunzel's specialty will be the study
of higher education in the United
States, and he plans to bring a fresh
perspective to the subject.
"Most ex-presidents are carried
away in boxes or take other jobs,"
Bunzel said, hence there is very little
literature by presidents on the or
ganization, politics and philosophy
of running a university. Bunzel said
he plans to study some of the politi
cal and social problems of higher
education through the eyes of a re
tired president.
Study topics
He will study topics ranging from
the increasing intrusion of legisla
tures and courts into campus affairs
to the future of what he calls the
"core values of the university" in a
changing world. "Core values" in
clude education standards, he said.
Bunzel decided to resign from the
San lose State presidency after his
tenure of eight years because the
offer from Hoover was "so attractive,
I just couldn't refuse." He said he
had planned to stay at San lose for a
few more years, but the lure of "the
reflective life" combined with his re
spect for the institution changed his
mind, he said.
Bunzel's career at San Jose was
anything but calm. His critics labeled
him arrogant and snobbish and stu
dents complained he was never to be
seen. He was accused of ignoring the
opinions and advice of his staff and
the community, and charged with re
lying solely on his own judgment.

Bunzel denied some of these
charges and agreed with others.
"There are some things a univer
sity president has to have set in his
mind," he said. "He must have a
deep committment to the core val
ues of a university." A president
should listen to the opinions of
others, Bunzel explained, but he
can't make decisions "trying to be
loved or be popular."
Bunzel said there are actually very
few decisions a university president
can make on his own. Bunzel said the
only decision he made by himself in
his entire time at San Jose was choos
ing the color of the car the state lent
him. He picked red and the only ob
jections came from his wife.
Comparing Stanford to San Jose
State, Bunzel said the major differ
ence between the two is that while
the former is an elite institution de
signed to conduct research and in
struct a select group of students, the
latter is committed to mass educa
tion. The average San Jose student is
26 years old and enrolled there to
learn a job skill, according to Bunzel.
But he added he doesn't believe a
university is merely a place to learn a
trade.
Racial issues
Bunzel's belief in high academic
standards has caused him some
problems dealing with racial issues.
He said the pursuit of equality of op
portunity must be balanced by the
need for high standards. He supports
the Bakke decision and generally ar
gues against strict racial quotas for
both students and faculty.
In a recent letter in the San lose
Mercury News he defended the use
of college entrance exams, stating
they are not culturally biased but
merely show that some minorities
have not had the opportunity to be
come well prepared for college.
One of the problems Bunzel said
he will study at Hoover is that of mak
ing universities more accessible to
those who want to go to college. At

the same time, he added, "we must
make certain that higher education
does not become so diluted that it
stands for nothing."
Bunzel called his years at San Jose
"some of the most exciting of my
life," and said he enjoyed the chal
lenge of public higher education.
Also a showman, last spring Bunzel
organized, directed and starred in a
musical review put on by the San Jose
State faculty and alumni.
Life at Hooverwill be quieter. Bun
zel intends to "immerse myself in the
literature sitting on my desk at
home." Though most of his time will
be spent in research, he does not

intend to lose touch with the com
munity, he said. He has done a good
deal of public speaking in the past
and may continue to do so, he ad
ded.
Bunzel said looking over his career
at San Jose State, his major regret is
that he could not shape things as
quickly as he would have liked. His
goal was to change "this place from a
little state college tucked away in the
corner of the bay to a major institu
tion."
His major accomplishments of the
last eight years? Describing his ex
pression over the phone as a broad
smile, he said. "I survived."

Bunzel said there are actually very
few decisions a university president
can make on his own. Bunzel said the
only decision he made by himself in
his entire time at San Jose was choos
ing the color of the car the state lent
him. He picked red and the only ob
jections came from his wife.
Comparing Stanford to San Jose
State, Bunzel said the major differ
ence between the two is that while
the former is an elite institution de
signed to conduct research and in
struct a select group of students, the
latter is committed to mass educa
tion. The average San Jose student is
26 years old and enrolled there to
learn a job skill, according to Bunzel.
But he added he doesn't believe a
university is merely a place to learn a
trade.
Racial issues
Bunzel's belief in high academic
standards has caused him some
problems dealing with racial issues.
He said the pursuit of equality of op
portunity must be balanced by the
need for high standards. He supports
the Bakke decision and generally ar
gues against strict racial quotas for
both students and faculty.
In a recent letter in the San lose
Mercury News he defended the use
of college entrance exams, stating
they are not culturally biased but
merely show that some minorities
have not had the opportunity to be
come well prepared for college.
One of the problems Bunzel said
he will study at Hoover is that of mak
ing universities more accessible to
those who want to go to college. At

the same time, he added, "we must
make certain that higher education
does not become so diluted that it
stands for nothing."
Bunzel called his years at San Jose
"some of the most exciting of my
life," and said he enjoyed the chal
lenge of public higher education.
Also a showman, last spring Bunzel
organized, directed and starred in a
musical review put on by the San Jose
State faculty and alumni.
Life at Hooverwill be quieter. Bun
zel intends to "immerse myself in the
literature sitting on my desk at
home." Though most of his time will
be spent in research, he does not

intend to lose touch with the com
munity, he said. He has done a good
deal of public speaking in the past
and may continue to do so, he ad
ded.
Bunzel said looking over his career
at San Jose State, his major regret is
that he could not shape things as
quickly as he would have liked. His
goal was to change "this place from a
little state college tucked away in the
corner of the bay to a major institu
tion."
His major accomplishments of the
last eight years? Describing his ex
pression over the phone as a broad
smile, he said. "I survived."
It is fairly common to hear of a pro
fessor who leaves his research to
take an administrative post, but not
often doesan administratorvoluntar
ily retire to do research on his old
job.
John Bunzel, president of San
jose State University, is doing just
that. Effective Aug. 31, he will leave
San lose to become a Senior Re
search Fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion.
Bunzel's specialty will be the study
of higher education in the United
States, and he plans to bring a fresh
perspective to the subject.
"Most ex-presidents are carried
away in boxes or take other jobs,"
Bunzel said, hence there is very little
literature by presidents on the or
ganization, politics and philosophy
of running a university. Bunzel said
he plans to study some of the politi
cal and social problems of higher
education through the eyes of a re
tired president.
Study topics
He will study topics ranging from
the increasing intrusion of legisla
tures and courts into campus affairs
to the future of what he calls the
"core values of the university" in a
changing world. "Core values" in
clude education standards, he said.
Bunzel decided to resign from the
San lose State presidency after his
tenure of eight years because the
offer from Hoover was "so attractive,
I just couldn't refuse." He said he
had planned to stay at San lose for a
few more years, but the lure of "the
reflective life" combined with his re
spect for the institution changed his
mind, he said.
Bunzel's career at San Jose was
anything but calm. His critics labeled
him arrogant and snobbish and stu
dents complained he was never to be
seen. He was accused of ignoring the
opinions and advice of his staff and
the community, and charged with re
lying solely on his own judgment.

Bunzel denied some of these
charges and agreed with others.
"There are some things a univer
sity president has to have set in his
mind," he said. "He must have a
deep committment to the core val
ues of a university." A president
should listen to the opinions of
others, Bunzel explained, but he
can't make decisions "trying to be
loved or be popular."
