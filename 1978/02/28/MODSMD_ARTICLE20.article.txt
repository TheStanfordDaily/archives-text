## ...and Serkin, too 
### 
Rudolph Serkin is one of the most highly re
spected and brilliant artists performing today;
indeed, he has, throughout his seventy-five
years established a reputation which entitles his
to join thedeific ilkoccupied during thiscentury
only by Horovitz and Rubinstein.
Last Tuesday, February 21, Mr. Serkin treated
his audience to an evening of exquisite plea
sures in San Francisco. *
For the performance, Mr. Serkin wisely — and
to the audience's great delight — chose a prog
ram of German romantic composers:
Schumann, Mendelssohn, Beethoven and
Schubert; it is in this type of music that Mr.
Serkin excels.
Firey fortes
He started the recital with Schumann's
"Theme and Variations on the Name Abegg,"

Opus 1. As Serkin played, the whole audience
moved with him; there were audible gasps, his
dynamic ease and skill were awe-inspiring, his
gentle, quiet singing passionate. By the time Mr.
Serkin was ready to begin Mendelssohn's "An
dante and Rondo Capricioso" (itself an amazing
virtuoso piece, written when Mendelssohn was
only fifteen), the audience was numb with dis
belief and begging for more. Mr. Serkin pro
ceeded to lure them into a trance and then to
blow them out of their seats with his piano
shaking fortes.
But without a doubt, Beethoven's "Les
Adieux" Sonata was the tactical highlight of the
evening. Rudolph Serkin understands Beeth
oven better than any pianist I have ever heard.
Consummate master of the keyboard, he mixed
and beautifully blended Beethoven's warmth
and strength throughout the piece. Mr. Serkin's
rendition of the "Absence" movement brought
me closer to tears than any other piece of per
formed music ever has. At the end of the piece
and the first half of the recital the stupefied
audience gave him a standing ovation and
forced him to return four times for hows.
Still stupified
For the second half of the program Mr. Serkin
performed Schubert's "Sonata in B Flat Major"
Opus Posth.), Schubert's last — and some say
most beautiful — piano sonata. The piece is long
and changes theme and mood often. Mr. Ser
kin's incisive, insighful interpretation brought
more subtleties out of the sonata than I ever
dreamed were there.
As Mr. Serkin struck the last chords of the
Schubert, the audience collectively and spon
taneously arose and gave him an overpowering
ovation. Mr. Serkin returned three, four, five
times to bow, always grateful, humble, and
gracious, but gently assorted himself and did
not consent to give an encore.
It didn't really matter. As we left the concert
hall, I don't think I saw one person who wasn't
smiling.

kin's incisive, insighful interpretation brought
more subtleties out of the sonata than I ever
dreamed were there.
As Mr. Serkin struck the last chords of the
Schubert, the audience collectively and spon
taneously arose and gave him an overpowering
ovation. Mr. Serkin returned three, four, five
times to bow, always grateful, humble, and
gracious, but gently assorted himself and did
not consent to give an encore.
It didn't really matter. As we left the concert
hall, I don't think I saw one person who wasn't
smiling.
Rudolph Serkin is one of the most highly re
spected and brilliant artists performing today;
indeed, he has, throughout his seventy-five
years established a reputation which entitles his
to join thedeific ilkoccupied during thiscentury
only by Horovitz and Rubinstein.
Last Tuesday, February 21, Mr. Serkin treated
his audience to an evening of exquisite plea
sures in San Francisco. *
For the performance, Mr. Serkin wisely — and
to the audience's great delight — chose a prog
ram of German romantic composers:
Schumann, Mendelssohn, Beethoven and
Schubert; it is in this type of music that Mr.
Serkin excels.
Firey fortes
He started the recital with Schumann's
"Theme and Variations on the Name Abegg,"

Opus 1. As Serkin played, the whole audience
moved with him; there were audible gasps, his
dynamic ease and skill were awe-inspiring, his
gentle, quiet singing passionate. By the time Mr.
Serkin was ready to begin Mendelssohn's "An
dante and Rondo Capricioso" (itself an amazing
virtuoso piece, written when Mendelssohn was
only fifteen), the audience was numb with dis
belief and begging for more. Mr. Serkin pro
ceeded to lure them into a trance and then to
blow them out of their seats with his piano
shaking fortes.
But without a doubt, Beethoven's "Les
Adieux" Sonata was the tactical highlight of the
evening. Rudolph Serkin understands Beeth
oven better than any pianist I have ever heard.
Consummate master of the keyboard, he mixed
and beautifully blended Beethoven's warmth
and strength throughout the piece. Mr. Serkin's
rendition of the "Absence" movement brought
me closer to tears than any other piece of per
formed music ever has. At the end of the piece
and the first half of the recital the stupefied
audience gave him a standing ovation and
forced him to return four times for hows.
Still stupified
For the second half of the program Mr. Serkin
performed Schubert's "Sonata in B Flat Major"
Opus Posth.), Schubert's last — and some say
most beautiful — piano sonata. The piece is long
and changes theme and mood often. Mr. Ser
kin's incisive, insighful interpretation brought
more subtleties out of the sonata than I ever
dreamed were there.
As Mr. Serkin struck the last chords of the
Schubert, the audience collectively and spon
