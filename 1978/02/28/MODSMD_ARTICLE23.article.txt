## On weird Warren's latest 
### 
\A/arren Zevon is a strange man who writes
strange songs.
Well, he went down to dinner in his Sunday
best
Excitable boy, they all said
And he rubbed the pot roast all over his chest
Excitable boy, they all said
Well, he's just an excitable boy
Warren Zevon, an album released in 1976,
was a conceptual look at the seamier sides of
Southern California, viewed from the eyes of
paranoids, junkies, potential suicides, and of
course desparadoes. His new album, Excitable
Boy, is not nearly as powerful or cohesive as
the last, but it has its moments.
Zevon's "Hasten Down the Wind," "Poor,
Poor, Pitiful Me," and "Carmelita" have all
been covered by Linda Ronstadt, making him
what could becalleda popular songwriter, and
as such, Zevon is a genuine wit in a profession
of half wits.
But he's more than a writer of popular songs.
It's tempting to call him a master of irony, but
in this respect he's certainly no Randy New
man (althought after Little Criminals one can't
even be sure Randy Newman is Randy New
man). He simply writes about things people
don't usually think about, making connections
people usually don't make. For example, in
"Werewolves of London," a near-legendary

song Zevon's longtime friend jackson Browne
has been performing for years during his
looser onstage moments, he writes, "I saw a
werewolf drinking a pina colada in Trader
Vic's. His hair was perfect." This is obviously
not the work of Paul Anka.
His songs are collages-of images, all of them
bent and some truly twisted. Call him a master
of weirdness.
He took in the four A.M. show at the Clark
Excitable boy, they all said
And he bit the usherette's leg in the dark
Excitable boy, they all said
Well he's just an excitable boy
The album is packaged in slick, Hollywood
style. On the cover the singer, wearing black
against a field of red, stares slyly out at us, and
the name "Warren Zevon" is printed in the
upper left hand corner in bold slashing letters
of white. But thearrangementsaresurprisingly
lean. Produced by Jackson Browne and Waddy
Wachtel, the record sounds polished but not
contrived, and Zevon's gutsy voice keeps the
music from falling into the Los Angeles/Eagles
stereotype.
But the songs are obviously arranged with an
eye toward the mass audience. Most feature
Wachtel, who, playing tasty licks with the tre
ble switch cranked up high, is the epitomy of
L.A. session guitarists. Zevon's melodies are
simple but imaginative and titles like "Roland
the Headless Thompson Gunner," "Acciden
tally Like a Martyr," and "Lawyers Guns and
Money" evokecuriosity in themselves.
But while most writers who hope to appeal
to a large segment of the rock audience churn
out vacuous little ditties about disco dancing
arid unrequited high school love, Zevon is at
least interesting.
He took little Suzie to the Junior Prom
Excitable boy, they all said
And he raped her and killed her, then he took
her home
Excitable boy, they all said
Well, he's just an excitable boy
Actually, considering the polish of his sound
compared to the grittiness of his lyrics, maybe
he is something of a master of irony. But he's
still weird.
After ten long years they let him out of the
Home
Excitable boy, they all said
And he dug up her grave and built a cage with
her bones
Excitable boy, they all said
Well, he's just an excitable boy.

The album is packaged in slick, Hollywood
style. On the cover the singer, wearing black
against a field of red, stares slyly out at us, and
the name "Warren Zevon" is printed in the
upper left hand corner in bold slashing letters
of white. But thearrangementsaresurprisingly
lean. Produced by Jackson Browne and Waddy
Wachtel, the record sounds polished but not
contrived, and Zevon's gutsy voice keeps the
music from falling into the Los Angeles/Eagles
stereotype.
But the songs are obviously arranged with an
eye toward the mass audience. Most feature
Wachtel, who, playing tasty licks with the tre
ble switch cranked up high, is the epitomy of
L.A. session guitarists. Zevon's melodies are
simple but imaginative and titles like "Roland
the Headless Thompson Gunner," "Acciden
tally Like a Martyr," and "Lawyers Guns and
Money" evokecuriosity in themselves.
But while most writers who hope to appeal
to a large segment of the rock audience churn
out vacuous little ditties about disco dancing
arid unrequited high school love, Zevon is at
least interesting.
He took little Suzie to the Junior Prom
Excitable boy, they all said

Actually, considering the polish of his sound

he is something of a master of irony. But he's

\A/arren Zevon is a strange man who writes
strange songs.

Warren Zevon, an album released in 1976,
was a conceptual look at the seamier sides of
Southern California, viewed from the eyes of
paranoids, junkies, potential suicides, and of
course desparadoes. His new album, Excitable
Boy, is not nearly as powerful or cohesive as
the last, but it has its moments.
Zevon's "Hasten Down the Wind," "Poor,
Poor, Pitiful Me," and "Carmelita" have all
been covered by Linda Ronstadt, making him
what could becalleda popular songwriter, and
as such, Zevon is a genuine wit in a profession
of half wits.
But he's more than a writer of popular songs.
It's tempting to call him a master of irony, but
in this respect he's certainly no Randy New
man (althought after Little Criminals one can't
even be sure Randy Newman is Randy New
man). He simply writes about things people
don't usually think about, making connections
people usually don't make. For example, in
"Werewolves of London," a near-legendary

song Zevon's longtime friend jackson Browne
has been performing for years during his
looser onstage moments, he writes, "I saw a
werewolf drinking a pina colada in Trader
Vic's. His hair was perfect." This is obviously
not the work of Paul Anka.
His songs are collages-of images, all of them
bent and some truly twisted. Call him a master
of weirdness.
