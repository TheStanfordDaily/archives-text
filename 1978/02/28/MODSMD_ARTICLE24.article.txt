Senate rejects canal pact change
Washington — The Panama Canal treaties sur
vived a crucial test yesterday when the Senate kil
led an amendment that would have allowed
American troops to be stationed in the Canal Zone
for 20 years after the waterway is turned over to the
Panamanians.
The Senate also rejected an amendment saying
that the English-language version of the treaties
would take precedence if there were any disag
reement between it and the Spanish-language ver
sion.
In another development, Sen. Robert Stafford
(R-Vt.), announced he would support the treaty if
it contains an amendment that incorporates into
the pact an understanding between President
Jimmy Carter and Panamanian leader Omar Tor
rijos on U.S. rights in the Canal Zone after the
waterway is turned over to Panama.
Strike threatens power supply
States dependent on Appalachian coal endured
another day of uncertainty yesterday — hoping an
end to the nationwide coal strike was in sight, but
fearing that even a quick settlement would not
stop the spread of job-threatening power cut
backs.
Rank-and-file dissension in the coalfields did
little to allay fears. Union presidents in one Ap
palachian district voted to recommend rejection
of a tentative pact reached last week, but other
union men called for its acceptance.
Even if it is ratified — a process that takes 10 days
in the United Mine Workers union — it would be
weeks before coal shipments return to normal.
Poll: U.S. unhappy over Mid East
Washington — The American people say they
want less U.S. involvement in the Middle East,
whether in selling warplanes or in pressuring Is
rael or Egypt to make concessions, an Associated
Press-NBC News poll shows.
And the survey found indications that the public
is growing disenchanted with the Israeli negotiat
ing stance in the current series of peace moves.
About 57 per cent of those questioned opposed
the proposed U.S. sale of warplanes to all three
countries — Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
Only one part of a $4.8 billion package proposed
by President Jimmy Carter earlier this month —
planes for Israel — is supported by as many as 24
per cent of the 1600 adults questioned by tele
phone last week.
Violence continues in Nicaragua
Managua, Nicaragua — Troops clashed with lef
tist guerrillas and anti-government protesters yes
terday in bloody gunbattles and rioting touched
off by President Anasatasio Somoza's announce
ment that he will continue to rule this turbulent
nation until 1981.
Ten persons were killed and at least 50 others
were injured, police and the Red Cross reported.
One of the dead was an army sergeant and seven
were guerrillas, they said. The others were not
identified.
After running clashes with guerrillas, govern
ment forces surrounded two towns south of here,
Diriamba and Masaya, that are traditional opposi

tion strongholds.
Cubans expand Ethiopian forces
Rome — Cuban soldiers have entered combat
for the first time against rebels in Ethiopia's north
ern Eritrea province, the insurgents said yester
day.
Cubans already had been reported fighting
alongside Ethiopian troops in their Ogaden war
against Somali secessionists at the other end of the
country.
Amde Kahsai, spokesman for the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front, said in Rome that 1000
Cubans joined Ethiopian defenders in the Eritrean
capital of Asmara for an unsuccessful attempt to
crack the five-month rebel siege of the city.
Kahsai said EPLF intelligence in Asmara reported
that Cuban troops fired heavy artillery and rocket
launchers as the Ethiopians tried to break out to
the south, suffering heavy losses. Asmara, popula
tion 300,000, is perched on a 7700-foot plateau 40
miles from the Red Sea.
U.S. intelligence has reported that more than
10,000 Cuban soldiers, several thousand Russians
and other foreign troops are inside Ethiopia, with
the Cubans directly involved in fighting the ethnic
Somali rebels who seek to unite Ethiopia's south
eastern Ogaden desert to Somalia.
Tongsun Park pleads innocent
Washington — Tongsun Park pleaded innocent
yesterday to 36 criminal charges of trying to buy
influence in Congress for the South Korean gov
ernment.
The millionaire rice dealer was arraigned in U.S.
District Court here even though the Justice De
partment has already agreed to grant Park immun
ity from prosecution in return for his testimony in
U.S. courts against other defendants.
The 36 counts against Park include charges that
he bribed former Rep. Richard Hanna (D-Calif.),
conspired to defraud America and Congress of
corrupt-free government, made illegal contribu
tions to congressmen as a foreign agent and was
involved in mail fraud.
Park, preparing to testify before the House
committee today insisted he gave money only to
congressmen who were friends and who asked for
the contributions.
House investigators have said that Park's tes
timony is essential to their job of determining
whether any of the two dozen or more present and
former congressmen who got money from him
should be punished for wrongdoing.
Leaking gas forces evacuations
Youngstown, Fla. — The deadly chlorine gas that
escaped from a ruptured railway car and brought
quick but tortured deaths to eight persons headed
toward another small town yesterday, forcing all
250 residents from their homes.
Officials said the residents of Fountain, about 20
miles north of Youngstown in the Florida Panhan
dle, were evacuated at about 5 p.m. after winds
began pushinga cloud of the gas toward thetown.
Meanwhile, a team of disaster trouble-shooters
halted efforts yesterday to neutralize the deadly
chlorine in the ruptured tank car.
The operation was put off until today because
the specially trained crew didn't have equipment

needed for the delicate operation, said Dan Tullis,
who heads the private Jacksonville-based disaster
team.
It also was discovered yesterday that the rup
tured tank car contains about twice as much
chlorine as had been estimated.
However, the chlorine is fairly stable in the tank
car, Tullis said, because of cool temperatures and
mild winds, so little of the chemical is vaporizing.
Spanish mime artists go on trial
Barcelona, Spain — The Spanish army will put
five pantomimists on trial today for allegedly in
sulting the military in one of their mime plays. The
troupe's director was to have stood trial, too, but
he eluded his guards with a ruse yesterday and
escaped.
Leftists threatened street protests and moder
ates condemned the prosecution as a throwback
to the days of the old Franco dictatorship.
Military officials rejected an appeal from the de
fendants yesterday for a civilian trial and ordered
them to face a Barcelona court martial of four
military judges.
Albert Boadella, director of the "Jugglers" mime
company of Barcelona, had been the only defen
dant in custody, having been jailed Dec. 15 and
later transferred to a Barcelona hospital when he
became ill.
Police said Boadella asked and got permission to
go to the lavatory at the hospital yesterday. But
instead he fled.
The other defendants — four actors and an ac
tress — have been freed on bond.
U.S. claims Laetrile smugglers
Newark, N.J. — A highly organized national
smuggling ring is preying on cancer patients and
making Laetrile easily available, a federal official
said yesterday.
Clifford Shane, regional director of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration in New York, said
in a telephone interview that his office is inves
tigating the alleged ring which is bringing in "huge
quantities of Laetrile, mainly from Mexico, and
sub-distributing throughout this country.
"They're very highly organized and they know
precisely what they're doing," Shane said.
"They're making millions off this operation."
Shane said the ring has sources in large hospitals
who pass on the identities of patients diagnosed as
having cancer.
Dow Jones down 7.89
New York — The Dow Jones industrial average
tumbled to its lowest level in nearly three years
yesterday as the stock market absorbed the impact
of some unfavorable inflation news.
The Dow average of 30 blue chips fell 7.89 to
748.35, its lowest close since it finished at 742.88 on
April 7, 1975.
Big Board volume tailed off to 19.99 million
shares from 22.51 million in the preceding session.
