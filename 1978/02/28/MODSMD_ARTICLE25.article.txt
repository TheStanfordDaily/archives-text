# Low Nom-Com turnout
## 
### 
A perceived "weakening of stu
dent government" here has led to
only three undergraduate and no
graduate students applying for posi
tions on the ASSU Nominations
Committee (Nom Com), according
to ASSU Council of Presidents (COP)
member Steve Westly.
Its function is to nominate stu
dents to the many University and
trustee committees. These nomina
tions are subsequently confirmed by
the ASSU Senate and finally by Presi
dent Richard Lyman.
The committee is made up of two
undergraduates, two graduate stu
dents, two at-large student members
and a COP member, currently
Westly.
This quarter, one undergraduate,
one graduate student and one at
large member will be chosen by the
senate.
The Nom Com was called "the
most important one on campus" by
Westly.
Westly said he believed there is a

"good chance" that Nom Com
would be faced with the task of
nominating students to the Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) in the near future. He said it
would be "bad precedent" for the
senate to override Nom Com to ap
point student CIR members.
Westly said he was "90 per cent
sure" the three student CIR mem
bers appointed by the University
would resign if the Nom Com and
senate appointed students as rep
resentatives of the ASSU to the
commission.
"They've given every indication
that they would," Westly said.
Westly said "Lyman's decision" to
place students on the CIR has given
students their perception of the role
of student government here.
Students wishing to be considered
for Nom Com should attend the
ASSU Senate meeting tonight. He
said perspective members should be
"prepared and well versed" on the
role of Nom Com.
