Seattle — The University of
Washington bell is not to be taken
lightly.
After all, it weighs 500 lbs.
But take it someone did.
The bell, used at basketball games,
is missing and presumed stolen from
a storeroom at Edmundson Pavilion
at the UW.
Bill Biffell, Husky band director
who moonlights as keeper of rooter
paraphernalia, speculated the bell
may be still within the Pac-8 "family."
"The last time it was used was at
the Stanford game last Thursday
night," Biffell said. "The Stanford
Band was here. I'm suspicious."
The case of the missing bell has
been turned over to Seattle police.
(A spokesman for the LSJUMB said
last night that the Band will neither
confirm nor deny any connection
with the incident, but that, for the
time being, the Cal band is being
blamed for the disappearance. The
Band plans to issue a press release
today regarding the incident.)
