## 
### Robin Millington 
The newly established Inter-
Fraternity Council Arbitration Board
is meeting to discuss Zeta Psi (Zete)
activities in January, according to
Reid Butler, Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC) president.
According to Marvin Herrington,
director of police services, police re
ceived a call about the theft of a
wheelchair from Cowell Student
Health Center on Jan. 19. Police sus
pected the Zetes were involved.
Zetes admitted taking the chair, and
it was returned, Herrington added.
Another incident under question
ing is the annual Zete "run." The
"run" is actually a streak, according
to Zete spokesmen. In the past the
run has taken place in a library. After
a reprimand, Zetes ran in White
Plaza, spokesmen added.
Zetes decided to return to the lib
rary this year, causing complaints of
disruption there, a Zete added.
"I feel that there was a lack of
sound judgment on our part. We're
willing to take steps to comply with
the decision on the problem," said
Jim Dodd, Zeta Psi president.
Dodd also said "this is a test of the
arbitration board to see where the
University and the IFC stand and how

far they are going to go,"
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said, "What we are concerned
about is whether or not this is consi
dered hazing. We turned to the IFC
to find their opinions on this sub
ject."
Butler said the arbitration board is
"trying to come up with some sort of
recommendation that will be accept
able to both the fraternities and the
University. We have to try to do the
best we can."
According to Butler, the board was
created in the aftermath of the Delt
expulsion two years ago to give the
fraternities some say in disciplinary
action. This is the first time the board
has met since its creation, he added.
The board is "a function of the
fraternities to make sure they don't
get screwed over but at the same
time recommend something that the
University will consider legitimate,"
Butler said.
The arbitration board consists of
the IFC president, two active frater
nity members, one fraternity house
associate (RA), and one alumnus.
The arbitration board is expected
to come up with a recommendation
by the end of the week, Butler said.
