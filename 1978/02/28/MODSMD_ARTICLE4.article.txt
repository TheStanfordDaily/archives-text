# McCloskey annoyed at attacks

### Caryn Coulter 
Rep. Pete McCloskey's (R-Menlo
Park) reaction to the news that a band
of citizens is still trying to make life
difficult for him might be termed one
of "extreme annoyance." But the
congressman's real words tell a
much better story, "so that son-of
a-bitch is after me again?"
It is not the first time McCloskey
has been hassled by an extremist
group; but this group began calling
him "Colonel McCloskey" just after
he was first elected to office in 1967
and continued even after he retired
from his Marine post in 1972.
The Civilian Congress, called "an
extremist group agitating for
maximum separation of powers" by
Prof. Gerald Gunther of the law
school, says McCloskey is one of
some 90 legislators who hold incom
patible offices in two branches of
government.
The issue stems from a 1971 district
court ruling on Reservists v. Laird
which says it is unconstitutional for
members of Congress to hold milit
ary commissions.
'Loosely-knit'
Jacques Fitch is a San Francisco
representative of the "loosely-knit"
organization who has been writing
letters to Daily reporters over the
past few months requesting stories
and photos of "Colonel McCloskey's
military background."
Fitch said, "All we're asking is that
they obey the Constitution. Do they
want to hold a commission in the
Executive Branch or an office in the
Legislative Branch?"
"It's a legitimate issue, the Con
stitutional language is there,"
Gunther said, later adding, "It isn't
completely ridiculous."
McCloskey dates the issue back to
Vietnam. "When I was leading the
anti-war movement in the House,"
he said, "the great majority of hawks
were also reservists. There were 110
reserve officers," he continued,
"and with one or two exceptions,
they were all for the war. One excep
tion was me."
Marine Corps
After the district court ruling,
McCloskey said he asked the Marine
Corps whether he should retire or
submit his resignation.
The Marines chose to retire him.
Retirement and resignation are "pre
cisely the same thing," he said.
However, Fitch and his cohorts are
trying to prove that McCloskey de
ceived his constituents into thinking
he resigned when he only retired.
"There is a distinction between 're
tired' and 'resigned,' " Fitch said.
Reservists v. Laird was brought to
Supreme Court in 1974; however,

the case was dismissed on the pro
cedural grounds that the plaintiffs
did not have legal standing.
Court decision
"The Court's decision not to dis
cuss the issue is all the more reason
for people to debate it in the public
forum," Gunther said.
The specific legal harm involved in
Fitch's claims may be more difficult
to establish in 1978, but that will not
halt his efforts. "They're dying off,"
he said, referring to the remaining
reservists in Congress. "We want to
establish the constitutional principle
before they're all dead."
Included on the Civilian Congress'
list of remaining reservistsare the fol
lowing members of the House
Armed Services Committee, Robin

Beard (R-Tenn.), William Dickenson
(R-Ala.), Jim Lloyd (D-Calif.), Bill
Nichols (D-Ala.), Floyd Spence (R-
S.C.), Samuel Stratton (D-N.Y.) and
Bob Wilson (D-Calif). Reservist
members of the Joint Committee on
Defense Production are Rep. Chal
mers Wylie (R-Ohio) and Sen. John
Sparkmen (D-Ala.).
Included on the Senate Armed
Services Committee membership list
are reservists Barry Coldwater (R-
Ariz.), Robert Morgan (R-N.C.) and
Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.).
To reach court again, the Civilian
Congress must establish legal stand
ing. "We will go back to court as
soon as we can find a plaintiff," Fitch
said. He later asked, "How would
you like to be a plaintiff?"
