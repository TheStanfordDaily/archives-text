# Consumer prices up sharply; record buying power decline
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Consumer
prices rose sharply in January and the
average worker's buying power de
clined by the largest amount on re
cord, the Labor Department said yes
terday.
The price index for all urban con
sumers climbed 0.8 per cent in
January after rising 0.4 per cent in
each of the past three months. If av
eraged out over the entire year, the
January increase would lead to an in
flation rate of nearly 10 per cent.
The purchasing power of the aver
age worker declined 3 per cent in
January, the biggest drop since the
department began keeping records
in 1964.
The decline in real spendable earn
ings was attributed to higher Social
Security taxes, fewer hours worked,
changes in the tax laws and rising
consumer prices.
Food, housing rises
Two-thirds of the higher prices
were caused by increases of 1.2 per
cent for food and beverages and 0.8
percent for housing, the department
said. Transportation was up 0.6 per

cent, medical care 0.8 per cent and
clothing 0.3 per cent.
The reports were called "cause for
concern" by Julius Shiskin, commis
sioner of labor statistics.
White House officials said, how
ever, two of the increases were one
time contributors to inflation. They
were rises in the minimum wage,
which drove up some prices for ser
vices and Social Security taxes. •
"It is not seen as a basic change in
the underlying 6 to 6.5 per cent infla
tion rate that we felt was accurate
even when the monthly increases
were lower," said White House Press
Secretary Jody Powell.
Short supplies
Shiskin said some of the increases
were caused by short supplies during
the severe winter. But he said infla
tion may be worsening because price
increases have been showing up at
wholesale levels also.
Among grocery store foods, meat
prices advanced 2.7 per cent, the
biggest contributor. Poultry, eggs
and fresh fruit and vegetable prices
also showed large increases, partly
because supplies were restricted by
adverse weather conditions, the de
partment said.
Sugar prices went up because of
new import fees, but coffee prices
continued to decline.
The report said costs of home
ownership went up 1 per cent as a
result of higher prices for houses,
home maintenance, repairs and
mortgage interest. Rents were up 0.6
per cent, while housekeeping ser
vices rose 1.1 per cent, partly be
cause of the federal minimum wage
increase, the department said.
New methods
The Labor Department overhauled
its way of figuring statistics in the
January report, covering 80 per cent
of the urban population, instead of
the 40 per cent checked in the old
survey.

The Consumer Price Index for all
urban consumers, the new survey,
stands at 187.2, meaning that pro
ducts that consumers bought for
$100 in 1967 now cost $187.20. The
index for urban wage earners and
clerical workers, representing 40 per
cent of the population, is 187.1. Rural
stores are not surveyed.
Real spendable earnings per week
declined 3 per cent from $95.91 to
$92.30 in 1967 dollars. The largest
previous drop was a 1.6 per cent de
cline in August 1973.

were caused by increases of 1.2 per
cent for food and beverages and 0.8
percent for housing, the department
said. Transportation was up 0.6 per

cent, medical care 0.8 per cent and
clothing 0.3 per cent.
The reports were called "cause for
concern" by Julius Shiskin, commis
sioner of labor statistics.
White House officials said, how
ever, two of the increases were one
time contributors to inflation. They
were rises in the minimum wage,
which drove up some prices for ser
vices and Social Security taxes. •
"It is not seen as a basic change in
the underlying 6 to 6.5 per cent infla
tion rate that we felt was accurate
even when the monthly increases
were lower," said White House Press
Secretary Jody Powell.
Short supplies
Shiskin said some of the increases
were caused by short supplies during
the severe winter. But he said infla
tion may be worsening because price
increases have been showing up at
wholesale levels also.
Among grocery store foods, meat
prices advanced 2.7 per cent, the
biggest contributor. Poultry, eggs
and fresh fruit and vegetable prices
also showed large increases, partly
because supplies were restricted by
adverse weather conditions, the de
partment said.
Sugar prices went up because of
new import fees, but coffee prices
continued to decline.
The report said costs of home
ownership went up 1 per cent as a
result of higher prices for houses,
home maintenance, repairs and
mortgage interest. Rents were up 0.6
per cent, while housekeeping ser
vices rose 1.1 per cent, partly be
cause of the federal minimum wage
increase, the department said.
New methods
The Labor Department overhauled
its way of figuring statistics in the
January report, covering 80 per cent
of the urban population, instead of
the 40 per cent checked in the old
survey.

The Consumer Price Index for all
urban consumers, the new survey,
stands at 187.2, meaning that pro
ducts that consumers bought for
$100 in 1967 now cost $187.20. The
index for urban wage earners and
clerical workers, representing 40 per
cent of the population, is 187.1. Rural
stores are not surveyed.
Real spendable earnings per week
declined 3 per cent from $95.91 to
$92.30 in 1967 dollars. The largest
previous drop was a 1.6 per cent de
cline in August 1973.
Washington (AP) — Consumer
prices rose sharply in January and the
average worker's buying power de
clined by the largest amount on re
cord, the Labor Department said yes
terday.
The price index for all urban con
sumers climbed 0.8 per cent in
January after rising 0.4 per cent in
each of the past three months. If av
eraged out over the entire year, the
January increase would lead to an in
flation rate of nearly 10 per cent.
The purchasing power of the aver
age worker declined 3 per cent in
January, the biggest drop since the
department began keeping records
in 1964.
The decline in real spendable earn
ings was attributed to higher Social
Security taxes, fewer hours worked,
changes in the tax laws and rising
consumer prices.
Food, housing rises
Two-thirds of the higher prices
were caused by increases of 1.2 per
cent for food and beverages and 0.8
percent for housing, the department
said. Transportation was up 0.6 per

cent, medical care 0.8 per cent and
clothing 0.3 per cent.
