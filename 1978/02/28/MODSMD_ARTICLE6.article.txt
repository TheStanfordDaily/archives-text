# Carter talks to governors about energy

Washington — (AP) President jimmy
Carter welcomed the nation's gover
nors to join in formulation of energy
policy yesterday but said the ultimate
decisions are global in character and
will not be easy.
Carter welcomed the governors to
a White House conference on energy
production, saying he was "very
grateful to have you to join in" on
what he called "one of the most im
portant questions that our nation
faces."
"It is not something that is an exc
lusive federal problem as you well
know," Carter told the gathering.
"And the answers are not exclusively
here in Washington."
Carter said no matter what the fed
eral or state governments may de
cide in response to the pressures on
them, "the future energy cir
cumstances are going to be shaped
pervasively by what other people
around the world decide."
The president, whose initial
energy package has been dead
locked in Congress for months, said
he still felt there was general agree
ment on the basic elements, includ
ing balancing conservation against
development needs, and "a shift
from rapidly depleting sources of
energy to those that are more plenti
ful in supply."
Federal action
The governors had gone into the
meeting pressing demands for fed
eral action to step up energy produc
tion and for less federal interference
in their own development efforts.
The White House meeting, second
in a two-day conference on energy
production, followed a speech by
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance which
called for promotion of domestic
energy to relieve the dependence on
Arab oil.
The governors expressed the same
concern to Carter, saying "It is essen
tial that we develop all possible
sources of domestic oil and gas con
sistentwith ourenvironmental goals,
to protect ourselves against future
embargoes and allow us to meet our
fuel needs."
The governors, attending the
winter meeting of the National Gov
ernors Association, also demanded
more aggressive pursuit of alterna
tive energy forms such as solar and
nuclear power.
The White House sessions had

been demanded by the governors for
the past year in an effort to focus
attention on energy production
needs. The legislative energy pac
kage Carter submitted last year leans
heavily toward conservation.
Preliminary reports
The preliminary reports issued by
the governors questioned whether
the administration's oil and gas pro
duction goals can actually be
achieved under the Carter plan.
"The governors expressed con
cern that the finding rate for oil and
gas, used in making the plan's supply
forecasts, was overly optimistic,"
they said.

The governors, attending the
winter meeting of the National Gov
ernors Association, also demanded
more aggressive pursuit of alterna
tive energy forms such as solar and
nuclear power.
The White House sessions had

been demanded by the governors for
the past year in an effort to focus
attention on energy production
needs. The legislative energy pac
kage Carter submitted last year leans
heavily toward conservation.

the governors questioned whether
the administration's oil and gas pro
duction goals can actually be
achieved under the Carter plan.
"The governors expressed con
cern that the finding rate for oil and
gas, used in making the plan's supply
forecasts, was overly optimistic,"
they said.
