# Dropping out: a misnomer here
## 
### Juan Zuniga 
Students who feel socially,
academically or financially frustrated
may decide to leave school tem
porarily, but the term "dropping
out" is a misnomer here.
Historically, the term "drop out"
has referred to students who leave a
given institution permanently.
At Stanford, "there isn't any categ
ory of drop outs," according to
Robert Houghton, associate regis
trar, "until a student graduates or
gets his B.A. from some other uni
versity he is eligible to return."
The more appropriate term for
students deciding not to return to
Stanford for any given quarter is
"stopping out."
Return possibility
A case cited by Sally Mahoney,
University registrar, concerned a
66-year-old woman who left school
in 1941. She learned recently that it is
possible to return and has enrolled,
planning to graduate in 1980.
This "open door policy," as it is
called here, is unlike the rules at
many other universities, which re
quire formal re-enrollment. Stan
ford's policy differs in that the Uni
versity considers a student to be a
student until graduation, regardless
of the time it takes.
With the exception of occasional
surveys, the University does not con
tact students after they fail to register
for any given quarter, according to
University spokesmen. Doing so
would be difficult because almost 25
per cent of all Stanford students take
a leave of absence at least once dur
ing their stay here.
According to University records, M
least 10 to 20 per cent of any given
freshman class falls into the non
graduating category.

The average proportion of non
returning students for the entire
University is about 3 per cent. This
includes students who stop out both
voluntarily and involuntarily.
A small number of students leave
involuntarily after suspension.
About 30 students are suspended
each quarter after failing to meet
course load requirements.
A 1973 report studied reasons for
stopping out. A sample survey of
about 230 students on leave found

that academic frustration was the
primary reason for leaving in fewer
than one-fifth of the cases.
About 44 per cent of the students
said they left for financial reasons.
Others said they left because of the
social frustrations which accompany
the pressures of an institution like
Stanford.
The great majority of those polled
said they felt the leave they took was
a satisfying and beneficial experi
ence.
