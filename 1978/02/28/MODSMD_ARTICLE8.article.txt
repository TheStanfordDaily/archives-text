## Solar Cal, trashing viewed 
### 
Support SolarCal
As concern over American's energy prob
lems continues, new sources of energy have
been proposed. One source of energy which
we would like to see developed is solar
energy, and we particularlyfavora proposal in
this area know as SolarCal.
What we especially like about the SolarCal
proposal, and what we would like to see in
corporated into any legislation relating to
solar energy, is that SolarCal class for not a
pilot program but rather a comprehensive
one, which would have space and water heat
ing accomplished through the use of solar
energy. The proposal also calls for a state
wide commitment through the establishment
of a cabinet-level authority and the providing
of low-interest loans to consumers, small
businesses and municipalities. The proposal
also puts the control of solar energy in the
hands of the people.
The SolarCal proposal should be of particu
lar interest to members of the Stanford com
munity since Assemblyman Victor Calvo (D-
Mountain View) is chairman of the Assembly
Committee on Resources, Land Use and
Energy. We hope that Calvo will introduce and
support legislation which includes the points
named in the SolarCal proposal.
Persons who are in favor of such legislation
are urged to send mailgrams and write this
assembly committee in Sacramento.

Trashing expression II
Last quarter we discussed some dangerous
incidents involving copies of newspaper that
suffered destruction on this and other cam
puses. We were — and are — opposed to such
attacks since they only obstruct freedom of
expression, and in noway add to debate on an
issue.
Beside newspapers, posters and flyers —
particularly those dealing with politics — have
been subject to defacement and destruction.
Some people apparently don't understand
that expression can take many forms, each of
which is important.
Works of artareoneform of expression that
unfortunately some feel they do not have to
respect. Not only is every art piece an artist's
way of expressing himself or herself, but a
work of art is unique, and thus irreparable and
irreplaceable. Those who use an art work to
further their pranks don't seem to realize that
they can unintentionally cause permanent
damage to that piece of art, and thus perma
nent loss of an expression of an idea.
We hope people realize that freedom of
expression takes many forms, including art,
publications and posters. Since there are so
many ways here by which people can
express themselves, we reiterate that we hope
others will always work towards expressing
theirviews ratherthan preventing others from
expressing their own opinions.
