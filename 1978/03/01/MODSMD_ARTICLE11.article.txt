# Sami Esmail case
## Israelis torment student 
### 
Ali Geranmayh

Last December 20, 1977, a 23-year
old student at Michigan State Uni
verstiy flew non-stop from Kennedy
Airport to Israel to visit his dying
father on the occupied West Bank.
Upon arrival at Ben Curion Airport in
Tel Aviv, he was arrested by Israeli
police. His family began to worry
about his failure to appear and in
quired about his arrival. The Israeli
authorities maintained that they
knew nothing about his location.
The prisoner is Sami Esmail, an
American citizen born in Brooklyn of
Palestinian parents. He was a
graduate student and teaching assis
tant in electrical engineering at
Michigan State at the time his family
urged him to return to Rammallah.
Sami's father died on January 4,1978,

while Sami was in prison.
The Israeli authorities did not
charge him with any specific accusa
tions. In Israel, the government re
tains the right to hold any person in
definitely without charging him/her
with a specific crime. Sami's brother,.
Basim, reported his disappearance to
the American Embassy in Tel Aviv.
The Embassy learned of his detention
and at Sami's request arranged for an
Israeli lawyer, Felicia Langer, to
represent him.
Langer, well-known for her
defense of Arab prisoners in Israeli
jails, was not permitted to see Sami
until December 28, 1977, the day
after he signed a confession in Heb
rew, a language he does not under
stand. On December 30, Langer
wrote in a letter to the American Em
bassy:
"He was subjected to a prolonged
investigation by many interrogators
for days, day and night, having a pos
sibility of no more than two hours
sleep. He felt completely exhausted
and did not know how to continue
and not to collapse. He was punched
by them on his stomach, requested
to stand in the corner of the room,
with his body naked. He was compel
led to carry a chair in his hands and
the interrogators were spitting in his
face. All this described here was
aimed to extract from him a confes
sion, signed by him. He told me he
did it because he could not bear it
any more ..."

On December 29,1977, Basim pro
tested the torture of his brother to
the American Embassy. James
Kerr Jr., the American Council, ad
vised Basim that sending a complaint
to the Israeli government might re
sult in even worse treatmentof Sami.
On January 3, Basim contacted Ber
nard Munger, Swiss Delegate to the
International Red Cross, who im
mediately requested permission
from the Israeli authorities to visit
Sami. Permission was denied.
Accused of subversion
The Israeli authorities finally ac
cuse Sami of subversive activities and
membership in a "sabotage organi
zation." In Israel, confessions ob
tained by torture are acceptable in
the court. Shortly afterward
Langer was ordered by the court not
to reveal any further information
about the case.
The case of Sami Esmail is by no
means unique. In its annual report to
Congress on human rights practices
in countries that receive U.S. aid, the
State Department recently charged
that, in Israel "there are documented
reports of the use of extreme physi
cal and psychological pressures dur
ing interrogation, and instances of
brutaliy by individual interrogators
cannot be ruled out." According to
the report, Israel allowed "normal
human rights guarantees" to be
"superseded" by security considera
tions in the occupied Palestinian ter
ritories.
Universal concern merited
Israel's concern for security
cannot be used to excuse arbitrary
arrest, torture and secret trials. The
charges against Sami were vague,
and varied from week to week. Sami
denied the charges. However, even
if he had been in contact with what
the Israelis call "foreign agents"
while in the U.S., he was certainly
within his constitutional rights as an
American.
What happened to Sami Esmail
could well have a repressive effect of
the freedom of other Americans who
support Palestinians' right to self
determination, and who may have
reason to visit Israel and the oc
cupied territories in the future.
Sami's arrest could be seen in the
view of Israel's fear of the ever
increasing awareness and under
standing of Americans to the justice
of the Palestinian cause. If Sami is
convicted in Israel on the basis of
political activities carried on within
the United States, then the case of
Sami Esmail should be of concern to
all Americans, regardless of their
views on the Middle East.

if he had been in contact with what
the Israelis call "foreign agents"
while in the U.S., he was certainly
within his constitutional rights as an
American.
What happened to Sami Esmail
could well have a repressive effect of
the freedom of other Americans who
support Palestinians' right to self
determination, and who may have
reason to visit Israel and the oc
cupied territories in the future.
Sami's arrest could be seen in the
view of Israel's fear of the ever
increasing awareness and under
standing of Americans to the justice
of the Palestinian cause. If Sami is
convicted in Israel on the basis of
political activities carried on within
the United States, then the case of
Sami Esmail should be of concern to
all Americans, regardless of their
views on the Middle East.

Last December 20, 1977, a 23-year
old student at Michigan State Uni
verstiy flew non-stop from Kennedy
Airport to Israel to visit his dying
father on the occupied West Bank.
Upon arrival at Ben Curion Airport in
Tel Aviv, he was arrested by Israeli
police. His family began to worry
about his failure to appear and in
quired about his arrival. The Israeli
authorities maintained that they
knew nothing about his location.
The prisoner is Sami Esmail, an
American citizen born in Brooklyn of
Palestinian parents. He was a
graduate student and teaching assis
tant in electrical engineering at
Michigan State at the time his family
urged him to return to Rammallah.
Sami's father died on January 4,1978,

while Sami was in prison.
The Israeli authorities did not
charge him with any specific accusa
tions. In Israel, the government re
tains the right to hold any person in
definitely without charging him/her
with a specific crime. Sami's brother,.
Basim, reported his disappearance to
the American Embassy in Tel Aviv.
The Embassy learned of his detention
and at Sami's request arranged for an
Israeli lawyer, Felicia Langer, to
represent him.
Langer, well-known for her
defense of Arab prisoners in Israeli
jails, was not permitted to see Sami
until December 28, 1977, the day
after he signed a confession in Heb
rew, a language he does not under
stand. On December 30, Langer
wrote in a letter to the American Em
bassy:
"He was subjected to a prolonged
investigation by many interrogators
for days, day and night, having a pos
sibility of no more than two hours
sleep. He felt completely exhausted
and did not know how to continue
and not to collapse. He was punched
by them on his stomach, requested
to stand in the corner of the room,
with his body naked. He was compel
led to carry a chair in his hands and
the interrogators were spitting in his
face. All this described here was
aimed to extract from him a confes
sion, signed by him. He told me he
did it because he could not bear it
any more ..."

On December 29,1977, Basim pro
tested the torture of his brother to
the American Embassy. James
Kerr Jr., the American Council, ad
vised Basim that sending a complaint
to the Israeli government might re
sult in even worse treatmentof Sami.
On January 3, Basim contacted Ber
nard Munger, Swiss Delegate to the
International Red Cross, who im
mediately requested permission
from the Israeli authorities to visit
Sami. Permission was denied.
Accused of subversion
The Israeli authorities finally ac
cuse Sami of subversive activities and
membership in a "sabotage organi
zation." In Israel, confessions ob
tained by torture are acceptable in
the court. Shortly afterward
Langer was ordered by the court not
to reveal any further information
about the case.
The case of Sami Esmail is by no
means unique. In its annual report to
Congress on human rights practices
in countries that receive U.S. aid, the
State Department recently charged
that, in Israel "there are documented
reports of the use of extreme physi
cal and psychological pressures dur
ing interrogation, and instances of
brutaliy by individual interrogators
cannot be ruled out." According to
the report, Israel allowed "normal
human rights guarantees" to be
"superseded" by security considera
tions in the occupied Palestinian ter
ritories.
Universal concern merited
Israel's concern for security
cannot be used to excuse arbitrary
arrest, torture and secret trials. The
charges against Sami were vague,
and varied from week to week. Sami
denied the charges. However, even
if he had been in contact with what
the Israelis call "foreign agents"
while in the U.S., he was certainly
within his constitutional rights as an
American.
