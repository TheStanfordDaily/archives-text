Ralph Waldo Emerson's bor
ing essays unleashed the crea
tive thrusts of key 19th century
American writers, renowned
author Alfred Kazin told 250
persons in Kresge Auditorium
Monday night.
Known for numerous books,
among them "Native
Grounds" and "A Walker in the
City," Kazin, 62, is currently a
Fellow at the Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences in New York.
Making "individualism to
tally sacred," Emerson enrap
tured writers like Whitman and
Thoreau, Hawthorne and Mel
ville, said Kazin. "He seemed
to have the secret of the uni
verse within him," he said.
Yet Emerson never evolved
into a literary craftsman, said
Kazin. His sentences were
"mutually repellent particles.
Ho hasn't squeezed into the
ranks of America's popular
writers because his message is
in the end, only for creative
people," said Kazin.
Only a handful of bubbling

geniuses could dissect Emer
son to find the support they
needed, said Kazin. Among
such literary types, "affinity is
felt not for a master, but for the
kind of writer who speaks the
truth for you," he said.
Truth was hard to come by in
the 19th century, he said. With
Calvin's predestination nag
ging them, people were never
sure if they were heaven
bound or not, said Kazin.
This "restless Protestant
conscience" flung writers into
solitude to find truth for them
selves, he said. Underlining
the daily peril these writers
felt, Kazin quoted Martin
Luther: "A man alone puts one
thought carefully in front of
another and draws the worst
conclusion."
Recluse
Thoreau, for one, lived life
as a self-communing recluse
who thought he had "put his
whole life into a single sen
tence," said Kazin.
Left alone between visits by
his friend Hawthorne, Melville
was "a hopelessly tormented

religious seeker," who was
tormented not by God, but by
"what we are ourselves in the
light of original sin," said Ka
zin.
Melville's raging sea in
"Moby Dick" symbolizes the
inconstancy he saw in his time
and the lack of a haven for
truth, he said. Amid America's
unrivaled prosperity, writers
were a "tragedy of pessimism
and alienation," said Kazin.
But Emerson's magnetic
words held out "happiness and
hope for all time" when these
writers could summon none of
their own, said Kazin. Emerson
was an "oracle" that spoke "di
rectly to the soul," he added.
Whitman wrote that Emer
son "brought to a boil" what
had been "simmering" within
him, said Kazin. Though
Thoreau, envious of Emerson,
once sneered, "I would just as
soon take his arm as embrace a
tree," he was no less indebted
to Emerson's message of indi
vidual self-sufficiency, said Ka
zin.
