"We do a fettle bit of every-
Jhmg,,said Gary Rosekjmd., an
RA in Granada. '"You can") wait
for people to approach you,
you have to keep your eye
open to what' s happening. '
Some RAs—especially those
in aS-heshman dorms — said
that most of their duties in
volve social organizing,, and
that while the bureaucratic part
of the jjob is least desirable, it is
also the least time consuming.
However., RAs find them
selves doing a lot of counsel
ing, of both the traditional and
the casual sort. INlick Kouletsis,
an RA in Gavilan, said he feels
that the greatest amount of his
time is spent in just being
around the dorm, looking after
people and giving support.
"INo matter how willing an RA
is to help, he must be highlv
visible to be effective," Koulet
sis said.
Moral dilemmas
Frequently, RAs must also
handle moral dilemmas. Kim
Wright, an RA in Branner,
commented that "especially

with sexuall problems., vow
freed to listen, and imot iiirrmpctse

However , time isn 't the onh

Some RAs—especially those

that while the bureaucratic part
of the jjob is least desirable, it is

However., RAs find them

an RA in Gavilan, said he feels
that the greatest amount of his

people and giving support.

Some RAs—especially those
in aS-heshman dorms — said
that most of their duties in

that while the bureaucratic part
of the jjob is least desirable, it is
also the least time consuming.
However., RAs find them
