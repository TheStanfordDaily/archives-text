"Taking this course was like arriving at an
oasis," wrote one participant. Another said the
workshop "made me more aware of my over
whelming anxiety concerning school and life in
general. It taught me physical methods of relax
ing, which work, instead of cerebrally trying to
reason away my anxiety, which doesn't work."
Another student commented "This course re
ally helped me deal with stress in my life, and it
made me feel less freakish about being tense,
since if Stanford offers a course in it, it must be a
common problem."

impede vour performance? Could your voc
abulary use improvement? Or do you need work
in time management and test preparation?
The Learning Assistance Center (LAO is offer
ing four three-week, no-credit workshops that
may help you. The classes began last week, but
latecomers should have little trouble catching
up with the rest of the class, according to Sallie
Kueny, acting assistant director of the LAC.
Test Anxiety is the only workshop in this
group that has been offered before this quarter.
It is designed to teach methods of tension re
duction, particularly in test-taking situations.
Such techniques include deep muscle relaxa
tion, systematic desensitization, meditation and
biofeedback.
Students who took the course last quarter had
very positive reactions to it, according to the
written evaluations they completed at the final
session.
"Taking this course was like arriving at an
oasis," wrote one participant. Another said the
workshop "made me more aware of my over
whelming anxiety concerning school and life in
general. It taught me physical methods of relax
ing, which work, instead of cerebrally trying to
reason away my anxiety, which doesn't work."
Another student commented "This course re
ally helped me deal with stress in my life, and it
made me feel less freakish about being tense,
since if Stanford offers a course in it, it must be a
common problem."

The workshop will meet on Mondays and
Wednesdays through March 15.
Vocabulary Development, taught by LAC staf
fer Barbara Laswell. will meet Mondays and
Wednesdays through March 10 from 11 !o11:50
a.m. in Biology 161. The course is designed to
help the student with the correct pronunciation,
interpretation and use of previously unfamiliar
words.
Another LAC staffer, Jackie Jackson, will be
leading sessions on Time Management every
Wednesday through March 8 from 3:15 to 5:15
p.m. in the Inner Quad. This course will concen
trate on efficient and effective use of time. Indi
vidual goals will be established for students, and
work toward those goals will be through lec
tures, progress reports and the implementation
and revision of personal time management
schedules.
Kueny is teaching Test Preparation every
Tuesday and Thursday through March 14 from
noon to 12:50 p.m. in Meyer Library room 146.
Students will work on general test preparation.
This includes practice test taking and the mas
tery of particular study skills.
tach of these workshops will also be offered
twice next quarter, with the possible exception
of Test Anxiety, Which may have only one long
session. Kueny explained that dealing with ten
sion "requires more time because it involves
physiological repatterning."
Anyone interested in this quarter's work
shops should contact the LAC secretary at
Meyer Library room 123, 497-2207, before going
to class.
