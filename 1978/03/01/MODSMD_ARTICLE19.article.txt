# Swimmers set for league championships in L.A.

With a final opportunity to qualify for
the NCAA Championships (March 23 to 25)
and a chance to swim in a fast, indoor
facility, 19 members of the Stanford men s
swimming team departed today for the
Pacific-8 Southern Division Champion
ships, hosted by East Los Angeles Junior
College.
In the three day meet, which com
mences tomorrow, the Cards will compete
against three of the nation's best teams,
UCLA, USC and California. In perhaps the
greatest gathering of swimming talent
other than that which assembles annually
at the NCAAs, this competition will be ex
citing and intense. UCLA and USC, both
picked as top contenders for the NCAA
team title, will battle for the Pac-8 South
ern Division crown. Stanford, who nearly
upset California in a deCuerre thriller ear
lier this season, will vie with the Bears for
the third position.
"Our purpose in the meet is primarily to

qualify swimmers for the NCAA's rather
than to try for the team title," commented
swim coach Jim Gaughran. "It is unlikely
we can beat USC's and UCLA's talent and
depth, but we should be close to Cal in
team scoring. We have swum well all sea
son and I expect those who are close to
NCAA standards to make them in this
meet."
Senior Jack Connelly, who, along with
co-captain Stu Corliss, is seeking his
fourth straight NCAA trip, will lead off
Stanford's medley relay and swim the 100
and 200 yard backstroke events. Enjoying a
good season, Connelly should eclipse the
stringent NCAA cut-off times in his events.
Sprint butterfliers Bob Hagberg and Sam
Franklin, both All-Americans last year in
the 100 fly, need only drop .5 of a second
to assure themselves berths on the NCAA
bound Card team. Distance men Bill Chao
and Monte Brown, neither of whom are
new to National championships, are ex
pected to qualify in their specialties. Fi

nally, breaststroker Rob Weber,
backstroker John Kingery, flyer Tom Ire
land, and free styler Kevin Reel, all close to
the time standards, will peak for the Pac
-Bs, their last shot at qualifying for the
NCAAs.
