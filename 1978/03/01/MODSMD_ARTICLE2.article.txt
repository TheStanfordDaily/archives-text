# Senate rejects reversing CIR position
## 
### Sara Lessley 
The ASSU Senate last night re
jected by a vote of 9-3 a proposal
urging tbe Nominations Committee
(Nom Com) to reverse its earlier pos
ition and appoint students to the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR).
The measure, proposed by Sen.
Rick Levy, asked the Nom Com to
appoint the three students who
served on the Ad Hog Committee on
Investment Responsibility last
spring, to the CIR.
Several weeks ago, the senate
supported the Nom Corn's refusal to
appoint student CIR members.
Levy said, however, that his posi
tion could not be considered "re
versing principles." He said it was
time to "swallow our pride" and
move toward appointing students
familiar with the issue of investment
responsibility to the CIR.
None favor divestment
He added that no current CIR
members openly favor divestment of
stock in firms with SoVith African in
vestments.
Levy said approving his proposal

would not have signified agreement
with the guidelines for CIR decisions
adopted by the Ad Hoc CIR and re
vised by the Board of Trustees earlier
this year.
He said President Richard Lyman,
in approving a selection process for
student CIR members which avoided
both the Nom Com and the senate,
revealed "the power structure of the
University."
In order to "move toward the ulti
mate goal of investment respons'bTT
ity" Lt is necessary to appoint stu
dents charged with reworking CIR
guidelines and with bringing em
phasis of social responsibility to the
CIR," Levy said.
In a slow-moving meeting, the se
nate also approved three new mem
bers for the Nom Com: junior
Camille Fong as the undergraduate
member. Sen. Doug Bandow as the
graduate student member and
sophomore Henry Garcia as the
member-at-large.
The Nom Com is responsible for
appointing students to University
committees.
In other action, the senate gave the

ASSU Guest Professorship Board the
discretionary power to approach two
potential guest professors for spring
quarter.
The board will offer positions to
Lee Novick, National Women's Con
ference coordinator, and Carlo Pre
scott, who has worked with Psychol
ogy Prof. Philip Zimbardo, according
to board member Beth Kerttula.
Kerttula said Novick would teach a
course on women in politics with a

"feminist slant."
In the final 10 minutes of the meet
ing, the senate hurriedly approved
two resolutions, one supporting ac
tivities aimed at freeing Soviet dissi
dent Anatoly Sharansky and another
forming a Select Committee on Elec
tion Reform.
Grethel commented at the meet
ing's close that he was "disappointed
with the attendance" at both senate
â– ind committee meetings.
