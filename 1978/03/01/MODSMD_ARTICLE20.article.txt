# Ruggers lose to Bruins

### Claire Duignan 
In a 15 man effort, a smaller, lighter and
slower Stanford I Rugby team lost, 17-7, in a
tough contest to UCLA, the best university team
in the country.
Stanford scored first when Denis Shanagher's
rolling kick and Jim Dodd's tackle forced a fum
ble which Dodd recovered for the try. The
Bruins countered when scrum half bolted from
35 yds. out.
Stanford's runners, though inhibited most of
the day by UCLA's big backs, had a run near the
end of the first half, which produced a penalty

kick of three points by Jeff Morris. Unexpec
tedly, the Cards led 7-4, its defense having stop
ped the Bruins' offense.
The Stanford pack played its best game to
date. Jack Moller, Redmond Burke, Gary
Marenzi and Mike Thurman applied remorse
less pressure to the Bruins' forwards.
In the second half, the UCLA backs — three of
whom are on the U.S. national team — were
strong finishers. One wing streaked away from
Stanford's defense to score twice.
On Wednesday Stanford's ruggers play the
"Old Blues," former UC players, at 3:30 p.m. on
the Maloney Field.
