# Cards reflect on frustrating year
## 
### David Georgette 
"I thought last year was a
long year," said Stanford for
ward George Schader. "This
year's been twice as long."
Saturday night the long sea
son will come to an end when
the Cards take on the Cal Bears
in Harmon Gym. And although
a win in that game will give
Stanford its second best sea
son in the past 11 years, there is
no denying Stanford's 2-11 sea
son in the Pacific-8 has disap
pointed nearly everyone as
sociated with the basketball
team.
"Basically, it's been really
frustrating because at the be
ginning of the season we
thought we had the talent and
the depth to have a good sea
son," said senior center Jeff

McHugh.
Had the Cards been able to
win the close games in the
Pac-8 like they had during the
nonconference, though, the
evaluation of the season would
be a whole lot different.
But in Pac-8 games decided
by six points or less, the Cards
are 1-6. In games with a two
point margin, Stanford is 0-4.
In games outside of the con
ference decided by four points
or less, the Cards are 6-1.
"You can't prepare for a
one-point game," said guard
Mark Pitchford. "There's so
many things involved. You
can't blame the loss on any one
guy or any one play."
Because as Pitchford added,
it's been different people at
different times throwing the

bad pass or taking the poor
shot at a crucial time.
"It's disappointment, cer
tainly frustration at this point,"
said Pitchford.
"I think we're as good as
most of the other teams," said
McHugh. "Shoot, OSU is in
second and we lost to them by
one point. SC is in third and we
lost to them twice by two
points."
In addition to the frustration
coming from the near-misses,
many of the players have had
checkered seasons for a variety
of reasons. Only McHugh,
forward Kimberly Belton, for
ward Jeff Ryan and guard
Daryle Morgan have avoided
slumps this season.
Even though Belton's season
has assured him a place on the

All-Pacific-Bteam, he said, "We
could have done better as a
team and that nullifies what I
did. We didn't quite jell the
way we should have."
Wolfe Perry suffered
through a miserable shooting
slump early in the season, and
only intermittently has he dis
played the accurate, spinning,
leaping jumper that was his
trademark the previous two
seasons. "It's just been frus
trating," said Perry.
Junior Paul Giovacchini,
slated to be Perry's starting
backcourt partner, was injured
during the Rainbow Tourna
ment over the Christmas holi
days and had seen limited play
ing time until last Thursday
when he scored a career-high
21 points against Washington.
For the senior co-captains
Schader and forward Jay Car
ter, the way the season has
gone has been particularly dis
tressing. Carter was injured in
an automobile accident before
the season began, and then
jammed his thumb during the
Rainbow Tournament.
Despite the injuries, Carter
is the Cards' second-leading
rebounder and third-leading
scorer. As coach Dick Dißiaso
said after the first USC game in
which Carter had 11 points and
five rebounds in 22 minutes of
action, "I think it's apparent
the more he plays, the better
we play as a unit."
And then there's Schader.
Sidelined by a series of leg in
juries last year, the big forward
came back and finally regained
his form of two years ago in a
pair of games against the
Washington schools in mid-
January. He scored 21 points
and had nine rebounds against
Washington State and 24
points and six rebounds
against Washington.
One of the reasons Schader
might not have been getting as
much playing time recently is
although he's the fourth
leading rebounder on the
team, in the last nine games
he's been making only 31 per
cent of his shots from the field.
"It's disappointing," said
Schader. "I've kept my inten
sity up. I'm healthy. I'm 100 per
cent. People saw what I could
do two years ago."

Forward Kimberly Belton follows through after shooting past arms
trying vainly to stop him. The 6-foot-7 sophomore, Stanfortrs leading
scorer this year, was selected to the All-Northern California team
yesterday.

Despite the injuries, Carter
is the Cards' second-leading
rebounder and third-leading
scorer. As coach Dick Dißiaso
said after the first USC game in
which Carter had 11 points and
five rebounds in 22 minutes of
action, "I think it's apparent
the more he plays, the better
we play as a unit."
And then there's Schader.
Sidelined by a series of leg in
juries last year, the big forward
came back and finally regained
his form of two years ago in a
pair of games against the
Washington schools in mid-
January. He scored 21 points
and had nine rebounds against
Washington State and 24
points and six rebounds
against Washington.
One of the reasons Schader
might not have been getting as
much playing time recently is
although he's the fourth
leading rebounder on the
team, in the last nine games
he's been making only 31 per
cent of his shots from the field.
"It's disappointing," said
Schader. "I've kept my inten
sity up. I'm healthy. I'm 100 per
cent. People saw what I could
do two years ago."

Forward Kimberly Belton follows through after shooting past arms
trying vainly to stop him. The 6-foot-7 sophomore, Stanfortrs leading
scorer this year, was selected to the All-Northern California team
yesterday.
"I thought last year was a
long year," said Stanford for
ward George Schader. "This
year's been twice as long."
Saturday night the long sea
son will come to an end when
the Cards take on the Cal Bears
in Harmon Gym. And although
a win in that game will give
Stanford its second best sea
son in the past 11 years, there is
no denying Stanford's 2-11 sea
son in the Pacific-8 has disap
pointed nearly everyone as
sociated with the basketball
team.
"Basically, it's been really
frustrating because at the be
ginning of the season we
thought we had the talent and
the depth to have a good sea
son," said senior center Jeff

McHugh.
Had the Cards been able to
win the close games in the
Pac-8 like they had during the
nonconference, though, the
evaluation of the season would
be a whole lot different.
But in Pac-8 games decided
by six points or less, the Cards
are 1-6. In games with a two
point margin, Stanford is 0-4.
In games outside of the con
ference decided by four points
or less, the Cards are 6-1.
"You can't prepare for a
one-point game," said guard
Mark Pitchford. "There's so
many things involved. You
can't blame the loss on any one
guy or any one play."
Because as Pitchford added,
it's been different people at
different times throwing the

bad pass or taking the poor
shot at a crucial time.
"It's disappointment, cer
tainly frustration at this point,"
said Pitchford.
"I think we're as good as
most of the other teams," said
McHugh. "Shoot, OSU is in
second and we lost to them by
one point. SC is in third and we
lost to them twice by two
points."
In addition to the frustration
coming from the near-misses,
many of the players have had
checkered seasons for a variety
of reasons. Only McHugh,
forward Kimberly Belton, for
ward Jeff Ryan and guard
Daryle Morgan have avoided
slumps this season.
Even though Belton's season
has assured him a place on the

All-Pacific-Bteam, he said, "We
could have done better as a
team and that nullifies what I
did. We didn't quite jell the
way we should have."
Wolfe Perry suffered
through a miserable shooting
slump early in the season, and
only intermittently has he dis
played the accurate, spinning,
leaping jumper that was his
trademark the previous two
seasons. "It's just been frus
trating," said Perry.
Junior Paul Giovacchini,
slated to be Perry's starting
backcourt partner, was injured
during the Rainbow Tourna
ment over the Christmas holi
days and had seen limited play
ing time until last Thursday
when he scored a career-high
21 points against Washington.
For the senior co-captains
Schader and forward Jay Car
ter, the way the season has
gone has been particularly dis
tressing. Carter was injured in
an automobile accident before
the season began, and then
jammed his thumb during the
Rainbow Tournament.
Despite the injuries, Carter
is the Cards' second-leading
rebounder and third-leading
scorer. As coach Dick Dißiaso
