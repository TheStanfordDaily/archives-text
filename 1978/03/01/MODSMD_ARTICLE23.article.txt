Combining good defense
with a devastating hitting at
tack, the Stanford baseball
team ran over Santa Clara
yesterday, 12-3.
The Cards racked the
Bronco pitchers for 19 hits in
the game, including three
each by freshman catcher
Phil Wilson and outfielder
Mike Codiroli. Randy Wong
added a three-run homer for
the Stanford nine.
"Everyone had at least two
hits," said Cardinal coach
Mark Marquess, "and we
played very well defen
sively."
The Stanford defense did
have its sparkling moments,
including four double-plays
and Pepe Hinojosa's over
the-fence catch of a Bronco
would-be home run ball.
Given a quick 6-0 lead,
starting pitcher Mark Abbon
dola went the distance for the
Cards to earn the victory.
