member schools, coaches and
student athletes when the
amateur sports association in

two schools that were placed
on probation.
In fact, Mississippi State
football coach Bob Tyler indi

NCAA resulted in his appear

prepared statement.
"We just finished two tough
years of probation and don't
want to go back on again,"
Tyler told the panel that is in

the National Collegiate Athle

sponsibility for some 300
athletes on our campus."
He said Mississippi State still
has an unresolved charge
against it and must face the
NCAA Council, the policy
making board that also has the
final say in rules violations
cases.
Dixon Pyles, a Jackson,
Miss., attorney who rep
resented Mississippi State be

committee: "I saw Coach Tyler
and his staff reduced to quiver
ing bowls of jelly" during the
NCAA investigation.
Pyles and Erwin Ward,
another Jackson attorney who
represented State, called on
Congress to legislate changes
in NCAA procedures for inves
tigating alleged rules violations
and for dispensing punish
ment.
Pyles called for creation of a
National Intercollegiate Athle
tic Board that would adopt
procedures to "fully comply
with all appropriate fundamen
tal constitutional protections."
