### John vonSchlegell 
The Stanford Hockey Club returned from San
Diego Sunday after adding three more victories
to an already undefeated record.
Well on the way to their best season ever, the
Cards boosted their record to 9-0, with two vic
tories over San Diego State, and another over a
local semi-pro team, the San Diego Cougars.
Goaltender Gervin Peters earned most valu
able player honors in the first game on Friday
night, as he shut out the San Diego State Axtecs,
4-0. Jay Johnston had two goals for the Cardi
nals.
On Saturday, the two teams met again. This
time it was the Cards over the Aztecs, 6-4. The
line of Grove Nichols, Barney Breitenbach, and
Hank Dudley played especially well for the Car
dinals, scoring four of the team's six goals.
In the big game of the weekend, Stanford met
the Cougars in the Sports Arena, in a game
played just prior to the San Francisco Shamrocks

— San Diego Mariners game. The Cards hung on
to win the game 9-7, even though they had
jumped out to a commanding 5-1 lead in the first
period.
"We had some guys who were sick or in
jured," said coach Pat Baldwin, "and with all the
partying that had gone on this weekend, I wasn't
sure we could hold on. Luckily I must have had
enough Ginseng vitamin tablets and good
words of encouragement, because the Cougars
never caught us."
This time it was the line of Baldwin, Jay
Johnston, and Murray Kinney who picked up
most of the team's slack, as Johnston had the hat
trick, and Kinney played exceptionally well in
the corners and added two goals.
"It was really nice playing in a good arena in
front of a good crowd," added defenseman Rod
McMillan. "When we saw the place, we forgot
just how tired we really were."
