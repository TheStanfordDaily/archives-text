Carter proposes education budget
Washington — President Jimmy Carter asked Congress
yesterday for a record $12.9 billion federal budget for
education and promised that some of the aid will go
toward reviving the three R's — reading, 'riting and
'rithmetic.
If adopted by Congress, the hike would be the biggest
increase in federal aid to education since Lyndon
Johnson's administration.
Carter asked for $6.9 billion for elementary and sec
ondary education, up from $6 billion this year. This in
cludes nearly $3.4 billion in aid for compensatory educa
tion for poor children, which funnels money to 14,000 of
the nation's 16,000 school districts.
He proposed targeting $400 million in extra aid to 3500
districts with large concentrations of poor students.
Two-thirds of this money will go to hard-pressed
center-city schools, while one-third "will flow to rural
and suburban school systems which have similar
needs," he said.
Support for canal treaty eroding
New York — Support for amended Panama Canal
treaties has eroded in recent weeks as the Senate has
waded through the first days of debate on the pact.

iar with the pacts still express support for Senate ratifica
tion.
Of those familiar with the treaties, 54 per cent favor
Senate ratification if amendments are added guarante
eing U.S. defense rights and the right to speedy passage
through the waterway in time of crisis after Panama takes
over the canal at the end of the century.
Rizzo gets tough with radicals in Philly
Philadelphia — Mayor Frank Rizzo set the stage yester
day for a showdown with about 17 armed anarchists who
have been holed up for nine months in a rat-infested
brick dwelling.
The radicals have been engaged in a standoff with
police, who have spent $1.2 million in an around-the
clock stakeout since a confrontation last spring.
"We are going to give these people one more chance
to come out," Rizzo said at a news conference yester
day."I have instructed the city's managing director that
on Thursday morning at 9 a.m. they will be given the last
opportunity to leave peacefully."
Spanish army postpones trial
Barcelona, Spain — Under obvious pressure from an
embarrassed government, the Spanish army yesterday
postponed the trial of six pantomime actors accused of
insulting military officers by portraying them as pre
judiced drunks.
Albert Boadella, director of the mimes, and four actors
and an actress, had been ordered to trial under a law
promulgated during the regime of dictator Francisco
Franco, who died in 1975. The law authorizes the army to
try civilians accused of offenses against the military.
Heavy rains batter the southland
Los Angeles — Rain-weary Southern Californians don
ned their slickers, shuttered their homes and kept watch
for floods and mudslides yesterday as another punishing
storm moved in.
By early evening, nearly two inches of rain had fallen

in downtown Los Angeles, almost three inches in the
surrounding mountains. The National Weather Service
said the worst was yet to come, with up to six inches
expected in some hillside areas by late today.
The weather service declared a flash flood watch for
most of Southern California from Santa Barbara County
to the Mexican border.

dictment are Dominick Phillip Brooklier, 63; Samuel Or
lando Sciortino, 58; Louis Tom Dragna, 57; Michael Riz
zitello, 50; Jack LoCicero, 65 and Thomas Ricciardi, 45.
FTC to regulate TV advertising
Washington — The Federal Trade Commission voted
yesterday to write regulations governing television ad
vertising aimed at children, but said it was willing to
agree to rules weaker than an outright ban on the adver
tising of sugary products.
The commission said it would consider the regula
tions proposed by its staff as well as alternative regula
tions during a public hearing later this year.
Brown will not seek third term
Washington — California Gov. Jerry Brown concluded

closing that if he wins his current re-election bid, he
wouldn't seek a third term.

out the "new spirit" he promised to bring to the state.
