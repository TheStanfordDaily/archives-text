## 
### Ed Gueble 
Vicente Ramirez Montecinos,
Spanish counsul general in San Fran
cisco, predicted political stability for
Spain under a new democratic
socialist government, in a speech
yesterday at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
"We have no doubt that the next
government will be Socialist," Mon
tecinos said. "In the next election,
people will be less scared" to vote for
the Socialist Party, he added.
"Before the )une election, to be
socialist was illegal. I think this has
disappeared completely,'' Mon
tecinos said.

In the June 1977 elections, the first
Spanish elections in 41 years, the
Union of Central Democratic Parties
(UDC) won 48 per cent of the seats in
Spain's newly formed parliament.
"The victory of the UCD was the
victory of a group of parties repre
senting a democratization of the
Franco regime," Montecinos said. "I
think many voters were used to vot
ing for the party in power, and so
they voted for Suarez."
Montecinos said )uan Carlos, 40,
and many others in the Spanish gov
ernment, recognize that because of
popular support, the Socialists have
a stabilizing effect on Spanish poli

tics.
"They will be," he said, "a more
decent government; less corrupt
and more efficient.
Montecinos said Spain's parlia
ment, "is going to prepare a constitu
tion which ensures autonomous rule
for the Basques and Catalans." He
said he hopes regional autonomy
and the advent of a socialist govern
ment will quiet Basque terrorist
groups.
In recent years fear of the ter
rorists, combined with effects of the
oil crisis, has greatly reduced the
tourist trade in Spain, which in 1973
was the largest in the world;
"They are just crazy," Montecinos
said of the terrorists. "How do you
stop 200 to 500 guys with money who
feel superior to the rest of the world?
"They are getting less and less
support from leftist political parties
because the new government is
going to meet their needs," he ad
ded.
The Consul General, a diplomat
for 23 years in the Franco regime,
does give the terrorists some credit
for the present democratization of
Spain.
He claims that in 1973 they assassi
nated Franco's apparent successor,
Prime Minister Carrero-Blanco. "He
blew up, pffft!, on the road to
church. . . . They just switched on
the bomb and the car went over the
church. The car flew very high."
"I'm not condoning political assas
sination, but what happened there
was very important. I don't think that
what we achieved in Spain in the last
two years would have been possible
without it."
Of Franco, who died in Nov. 1975,
Montecino said, "He probably was a
better politician than he was a man,
because to hold power in a country
for 40 years is a difficult matter."

Montecinos said Spain's parlia
ment, "is going to prepare a constitu
tion which ensures autonomous rule
for the Basques and Catalans." He
said he hopes regional autonomy
and the advent of a socialist govern
ment will quiet Basque terrorist
groups.
In recent years fear of the ter
rorists, combined with effects of the
oil crisis, has greatly reduced the
tourist trade in Spain, which in 1973
was the largest in the world;
"They are just crazy," Montecinos
said of the terrorists. "How do you
stop 200 to 500 guys with money who
feel superior to the rest of the world?
"They are getting less and less
support from leftist political parties
because the new government is
going to meet their needs," he ad
ded.
The Consul General, a diplomat
for 23 years in the Franco regime,
does give the terrorists some credit
for the present democratization of
Spain.
He claims that in 1973 they assassi
nated Franco's apparent successor,
Prime Minister Carrero-Blanco. "He
blew up, pffft!, on the road to
church. . . . They just switched on
the bomb and the car went over the
church. The car flew very high."
"I'm not condoning political assas
sination, but what happened there
was very important. I don't think that
what we achieved in Spain in the last
two years would have been possible
without it."
Of Franco, who died in Nov. 1975,
Montecino said, "He probably was a
better politician than he was a man,
because to hold power in a country
for 40 years is a difficult matter."
Vicente Ramirez Montecinos,
Spanish counsul general in San Fran
cisco, predicted political stability for
Spain under a new democratic
socialist government, in a speech
yesterday at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
"We have no doubt that the next
government will be Socialist," Mon
tecinos said. "In the next election,
people will be less scared" to vote for
the Socialist Party, he added.
"Before the )une election, to be
socialist was illegal. I think this has
disappeared completely,'' Mon
tecinos said.

In the June 1977 elections, the first
Spanish elections in 41 years, the
Union of Central Democratic Parties
(UDC) won 48 per cent of the seats in
Spain's newly formed parliament.
"The victory of the UCD was the
victory of a group of parties repre
senting a democratization of the
Franco regime," Montecinos said. "I
think many voters were used to vot
ing for the party in power, and so
they voted for Suarez."
Montecinos said )uan Carlos, 40,
and many others in the Spanish gov
ernment, recognize that because of
popular support, the Socialists have
a stabilizing effect on Spanish poli

tics.
"They will be," he said, "a more
decent government; less corrupt
and more efficient.
