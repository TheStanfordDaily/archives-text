Stanford Band manager Alex Jar
detzky said yesterday that, to his
knowledge, the LSJUMB had no
connection with the weekend disap
pearance of a large bell from the Uni
versity of Washington campus.
"That would have been god-like,
but as far as I know, we didn't take
the damned thing," he said. The 500
lb., purple and gold bell, was last
seen during a Thursday night bas
ketball game between the Huskies
and Cardinals.
The University of Washington
Daily quoted an anonymous cheer
leader saying, "As far as I am con
cerned, they (Stanford) can keep the
thing. It is uglier than hell."

freshman, was listed in stable condi

con, also a Casa Zapata resident. The

The sportscar was attempting to
turn left from the northbound lane of
El Camirio Real onto Oak Grove Ave.
when a car driven by Mark Wendell,

Peterson received lacerations and
internal injuries and underwent
