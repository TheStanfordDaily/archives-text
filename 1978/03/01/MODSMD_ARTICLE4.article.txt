### Andrea James 
After meeting four times in two
months, the Medical School Faculty
Senate task force on student ranking
evaluation has "examined our mis
sion and decided our priorities," said
Dr. Ruth Gross, chairman of the task
force.
Cross said yesterday the task force
will concentrate on two categories of
student ranking: "the adequacy of
current recommendations," includ
ing the dean's letter and departmen
tal letters of recommendation, and
"if students are now getting approp
riate feedback on their achievements
while enrolled in Med School.
"When all the dust settles, we
think this second category will be the
most important," Gross said.
'Last November, more than 100
students protested the use of a
grouping system used in the 1977
dean's letter. The Office of Student
Affairs (OSA) revised the letter's final
paragraph and removed the student

classification.
The task force is part of a recom
mendation made at that time by Dr.
William Creger, former associate
dean for student affairs. He said he
hoped students and the OSA would
"come to an understanding and ag
reement in principle well before the
dean's letter is written next year."
"We have to make our recom
mendations to the Faculty Senate by
next fall," Gross said. "However,
we're sure it will take all the rest of
the academic year to formulate these
recommendations."
In tackling the first category, Gross
said the task force will "see how well
students are achieving their desired
positions."
Students receive their post
graduate intern or resident positions
through a matching plan, she
explained. If a student is chosen to
practice internship or residency in
one of his first three or four choices,
he is doing very well," Cross said.
The OSA refused to release statis
tics showing how well Med School
graduates have previously matched
with their first few choices.
Gross also said the task force will
see how other schools "see Stan
ford's recommendations. We want
to find out if the dean's letter is help
ful, if it helps the school to choose a
good student."
She added, "I don't see how the
dean's letter can be totally aban
doned, but maybe it will be mod
ified."
"Right now, we're soul

searching," Gross said. She added
the other members of the committee
are getting opinions from various
persons in the Med School regarding
an evaluation system.
As to the second category on stu
dent achievement feedback, Gross
said the task force plans to ask both
students and faculty how they feel
about the minimum standards now
required for graduation.
"Students must pass both sections
one and two of a national medical
exam before they can graduate. In
addition, they must pass a certain
number of course hours. We want to
make sure these minimum standards
are appropriate," she said.

think this second category will be the
most important," Gross said.
'Last November, more than 100
students protested the use of a
grouping system used in the 1977
dean's letter. The Office of Student
Affairs (OSA) revised the letter's final
paragraph and removed the student

classification.
The task force is part of a recom
mendation made at that time by Dr.
William Creger, former associate
dean for student affairs. He said he
hoped students and the OSA would
"come to an understanding and ag
reement in principle well before the
dean's letter is written next year."
"We have to make our recom
mendations to the Faculty Senate by
next fall," Gross said. "However,
we're sure it will take all the rest of
the academic year to formulate these
recommendations."
In tackling the first category, Gross
said the task force will "see how well
students are achieving their desired
positions."
Students receive their post
graduate intern or resident positions
through a matching plan, she
explained. If a student is chosen to
practice internship or residency in
one of his first three or four choices,
he is doing very well," Cross said.
The OSA refused to release statis
tics showing how well Med School
graduates have previously matched
with their first few choices.
Gross also said the task force will
see how other schools "see Stan
ford's recommendations. We want
to find out if the dean's letter is help
ful, if it helps the school to choose a
good student."
She added, "I don't see how the
dean's letter can be totally aban
doned, but maybe it will be mod
ified."
"Right now, we're soul

searching," Gross said. She added
the other members of the committee
are getting opinions from various
persons in the Med School regarding
an evaluation system.
As to the second category on stu
dent achievement feedback, Gross
said the task force plans to ask both
students and faculty how they feel
about the minimum standards now
required for graduation.
"Students must pass both sections
one and two of a national medical
exam before they can graduate. In
addition, they must pass a certain
number of course hours. We want to
make sure these minimum standards
are appropriate," she said.
