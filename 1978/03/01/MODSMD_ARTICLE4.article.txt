After meeting four times in two
months, the Medical School Faculty
Senate task force on student ranking
evaluation has "examined our mis

William Creger, former associate
dean for student affairs. He said he
hoped students and the OSA would
"come to an understanding and ag

dean's letter is written next year."

next fall," Gross said. "However,

the academic year to formulate these
recommendations."
In tackling the first category, Gross
said the task force will "see how well
students are achieving their desired
positions."
Students receive their post
graduate intern or resident positions
through a matching plan, she
explained. If a student is chosen to
practice internship or residency in
one of his first three or four choices,
