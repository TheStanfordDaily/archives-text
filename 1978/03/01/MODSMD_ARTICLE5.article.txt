## Park grilled in closed session 
### 
Washington (AP) — Tongsun Park
was interrogated for five hours yes
terday about alleged South Korean
schemes to buy influence in Con
gress, saying the atmosphere of the
secret session was "very cordial and
cooperative."
"I did my best to answer all the
questions that were raised," Park
said of the session marked by tight
security.
One committee member, declin
ing to be identified, described Park's
opening testimony as "tedious with
no surprises."
Chief committee counsel Leon
Jaworski told reporters that "things
went off according to plan today.
We're making the type of progress
we had anticipated."
Both jaworski and Park refused to
answer questions about the tes
timony, which was given under oath.
Park was accompanied to the session
by his attorney, William Hundley.
First names
Among the first names to come up
at the session were those of former
Rep. Richard Hanna (D-Calif.) and
Edwin Edwards, who is now the gov
ernor of Louisiana, committee mem
bers said.
Hanna has been indicted on crimi
nal charges of conspiring with Park to
try to buy influence in Congress for
the South Korean government.
Park is scheduled to testify at Han
na's trial which is to begin oh March
20. Edwards, a Democrat, has denied
any wrongdoing but acknowledged
he and his wife got $20,000 from Park.
Led by Jaworski, a former Water
gate prosecutor, House investigators
interrogated Park on allegations that
he lavished gifts and substantial

campaign contributions on selected
members of Congress to win favora
ble treatment for legislation affecting
the Seoul government.
Park, a wealthy rice dealer and
one-time Washington socialite, was
under heavy guard as he arrived on
Capitol Hill. The committee is trying
to determine whether congressmen
who received Park's gifts should be
punished for wrongdoing.
Withhold aid
The alleged influence buying
scheme has pu't a heavy strain on
U.S.-South Korean relations, with
some congressmen threatening to
withhold aid to Seoul unless it coop
erates in the investigation. The South
Korean government has refused to
turn over some South Korean offi
cials which the House committee
views as key witnesses in the probe.
Park was arraigned Monday on a
36-count federal criminal indictment
which, among other things, charges
him with paying $100,000 or more to
several former congressmen and
making campaign and office account
contributions ranging from $100 to
$5000 to at least 24 congressmen and
senators.
Park pleaded innocent to the
charges in a proceeding that the |us
tice Department said was a mere
formality. The department already
has granted Park immunity from pro
secution in return for his testimony
in U.S. courts on the influence buy
ing affair.
Park insisted Monday that he was
not acting as an agent of the South
Korean government when he gave
the gifts to congressmen. Park has
acknowledged, however, he hoped
the contributions would help his
country.

gate prosecutor, House investigators
interrogated Park on allegations that
he lavished gifts and substantial

campaign contributions on selected
members of Congress to win favora
ble treatment for legislation affecting
the Seoul government.
Park, a wealthy rice dealer and
one-time Washington socialite, was
under heavy guard as he arrived on
Capitol Hill. The committee is trying
to determine whether congressmen
who received Park's gifts should be
punished for wrongdoing.
Withhold aid
The alleged influence buying
scheme has pu't a heavy strain on
U.S.-South Korean relations, with
some congressmen threatening to
withhold aid to Seoul unless it coop
erates in the investigation. The South
Korean government has refused to
turn over some South Korean offi
cials which the House committee
views as key witnesses in the probe.
Park was arraigned Monday on a
36-count federal criminal indictment
which, among other things, charges
him with paying $100,000 or more to
several former congressmen and
making campaign and office account
contributions ranging from $100 to
$5000 to at least 24 congressmen and
senators.
Park pleaded innocent to the
charges in a proceeding that the |us
tice Department said was a mere
formality. The department already
has granted Park immunity from pro
secution in return for his testimony
in U.S. courts on the influence buy
ing affair.
Park insisted Monday that he was
not acting as an agent of the South
Korean government when he gave
the gifts to congressmen. Park has
acknowledged, however, he hoped
the contributions would help his
country.
