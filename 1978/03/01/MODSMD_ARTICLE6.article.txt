# Dormitories suffering 'significant' damage

### Kelly Raftery 
Dorms and other University resi
dences are suffering significant dam
age, according to Rob Ramirez, man
ager of University Housitig. How
ever, he added, the exact extent of
this damage is not known.
In the future the housing office
"will be directing attention to more
accurately assess just what Stanford's
damage costs," Ramirez said.
The most prevalent damages are
broken windows ($35 to $50), broken

or damaged furniture (varies), bro
ken lightshades ($3O), broken panic
equipment on doors ($2OO to $300),
and damage sustained because of
students climbing on roofs ($1700).
Clogged drains, broken mirrors, and
abused doors and walls are also
common.
The Row Office refused to release
precise damage figures for Toyon,
Roble, Branner, Lagunita or Florence
Moore. However, figures from Stern
and Wilbur seem to show that most
damage is sustained in all-freshman
houses.
Total damage at Stern was $1027.
The two freshman houses there were
responsible for $610 of that damage,
or 59 per cent. Wilbur's total dam
ages were $1296, of which its four
freshman houses accounted for
$1015, or 78.3 per cent.
"It surprised me that this year's
damage at Wilbur was $567 greater

than last year's," said Marie Hailey,
administrative coordinator of the
Wilbur Houses.
She said she feels that damage var
ies from year to year according to the
personalities that are brought into a
house, and that the increase in dam
age is not a trend. Hailey noted that
years ago, when Wilbur was an all
freshman men's dorm, damages
were routinely quite high.
Arroyo sustained the most dam
ages of all Wilbur Houses. Joe
McCoy, house associate there, said
almost all of the Arroyo damages
could be attributed to a small group.
Hailey said that most of the damages
she handled were caused by "two or
three people, usually males, who
think it's smart to damage things."
One freshman admitted he dam
aged dorms to show off to peers.
Another freshman said he does not
feel the dorm is his home and there

fore has no respect for it.
Brad Palfrey, chairman of the
Branner dorm government group,
observed that "when under the in
fluence, people feel an impulse to do
something to impress others, and
often they turn to destructive mea
sures."
Several Arroyo residents agreed
with Palfrey, saying much damage
was done by intoxicated students
who were "proud of the fact" that
they had damaged something.
Due to the extent of damages at
Arroyo, the Resident Fellows and RAs
there made students aware of the
seriousness of the problem and
threatened vandals with extreme
punitive measures. According to
McCoy, this was a result of indirect
peer pressure by most students in
the house, who were tired of paying
for damages when no one took re
sponsibility for them.

almost all of the Arroyo damages
could be attributed to a small group.
Hailey said that most of the damages
she handled were caused by "two or
three people, usually males, who
think it's smart to damage things."
One freshman admitted he dam
aged dorms to show off to peers.
Another freshman said he does not
feel the dorm is his home and there

fore has no respect for it.
Brad Palfrey, chairman of the
Branner dorm government group,
observed that "when under the in
fluence, people feel an impulse to do
something to impress others, and
often they turn to destructive mea
sures."
Several Arroyo residents agreed
with Palfrey, saying much damage
was done by intoxicated students
who were "proud of the fact" that
they had damaged something.
Due to the extent of damages at
Arroyo, the Resident Fellows and RAs
there made students aware of the
seriousness of the problem and
threatened vandals with extreme
punitive measures. According to
McCoy, this was a result of indirect
peer pressure by most students in
the house, who were tired of paying
for damages when no one took re
sponsibility for them.
Dorms and other University resi
dences are suffering significant dam
age, according to Rob Ramirez, man
ager of University Housitig. How
ever, he added, the exact extent of
this damage is not known.
In the future the housing office
"will be directing attention to more
accurately assess just what Stanford's
damage costs," Ramirez said.
The most prevalent damages are
broken windows ($35 to $50), broken

or damaged furniture (varies), bro
ken lightshades ($3O), broken panic
equipment on doors ($2OO to $300),
and damage sustained because of
students climbing on roofs ($1700).
Clogged drains, broken mirrors, and
abused doors and walls are also
common.
The Row Office refused to release
precise damage figures for Toyon,
Roble, Branner, Lagunita or Florence
Moore. However, figures from Stern
and Wilbur seem to show that most
damage is sustained in all-freshman
houses.
Total damage at Stern was $1027.
The two freshman houses there were
responsible for $610 of that damage,
or 59 per cent. Wilbur's total dam
ages were $1296, of which its four
freshman houses accounted for
$1015, or 78.3 per cent.
"It surprised me that this year's
damage at Wilbur was $567 greater

than last year's," said Marie Hailey,
administrative coordinator of the
Wilbur Houses.
She said she feels that damage var
ies from year to year according to the
personalities that are brought into a
house, and that the increase in dam
age is not a trend. Hailey noted that
years ago, when Wilbur was an all
freshman men's dorm, damages
were routinely quite high.
Arroyo sustained the most dam
ages of all Wilbur Houses. Joe
McCoy, house associate there, said
almost all of the Arroyo damages
could be attributed to a small group.
