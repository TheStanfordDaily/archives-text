# But worst to come
## Ph.D. job outlook not promising 
### James Petrila 
Though there is "no one field in the humanities where
current job prospects for Ph.D.'s are promising . . .pre
dictions and trends show that the worst of the crunch
will come in the mid-1980s," Bliss Carnochan, dean of
the graduate division, said last night on KZSU's Campus
Conference.
The University has a dual responsibility to the indi
vidual student working for an advanced degree and to
the enterprise of higher education itself, Carnochan
said.
Because of the job situation, universities have an obli
gation to keep specific subjects alive, since "it is hard to
overcome gaps should they arise," the dean noted.
Carnochan added that universities and individual de
partments have a responsibility to provide students with
"truth in advertising," a realistic appraisal of prospects
for finding gainful employment in their chosen field.
These bleak prognostications present "extremely severe
implications for American higher education," Car
nochan added.
For the past 30 years, according to Carnochan, people
with doctorates have generally filled teaching jobs. Lack
of university positions has changed that scenario, "but
not for a long enough time that other paths to employ
ment opportunities are known," Carnochan said.
Although the number of students desiring to do
graduate work in the humanities and sciences has de
creased, applications for graduate admissions in general
has increased. Carnochan explained that the schools of
law, business and medicine are responsible for this
overall increase.
Carnochan said that while the number of minority
graduate students in humanities and sciences have sub
stantially decreased in the past five years, minority ap
plications to law, business and medical school have in
creased.
"We don't like the fact that minority enrollments are
down in Hand S (humanities and sciences), but it may
represent the real facts of the current job situation,"
Carnochan said.

Carnochan also commented on the recent con
troversy over finding a replacement for Ron Arroyo, a
Chicanoassistant dean for the graduate division.
"The debate centers around the question of how best
to replace Arroyo" to allow for the most effective re
cruitment of minority students, Carnochan said.
Carnochan's suggestion has been to make a joint ap
pointment with the School of Engineering, which cur
rently has no comparable position for Chicano students.
The dean noted he had no desire to force his particular
solution on unwilling parties, and denied charges that
he was involved in "foot dragging" on the problem.
