# Bungle in the Jungle
## Abolish Social Security 
### 
Doug Bandow

Congress is deservedly coming under increasing
pressure for the crime it committed late last year — the
massive increase in social security taxes. After long re
fusing to face up to the actuarial arithmetic that could
no longer be avoided, Congress panicked and wrecked
its chance to really reform the social security scheme.
The law passed by Congress, and signed by Carter,
provides for a tripling of the maximum tax betwen 1979
and 1987. The added amount of money that will be stolen
by the government is a staggering $227 billion.
The cowardly Congress postponed the effective date
of the tax increase to Jan. 1, 7979 — after the next elec
tion. However, this pitiful tactic did not work, because
an increase, scheduled under a previous law, took effect
this Jan. 1 instead. Thus the wrath of the voters is being
felt on Capitol Hill.
One needs to look in more detail at the situation
which caused such disturbing action. Despite the in
creasing awareness of the public, the government has
long continued to foster the myth of social security
being an insurance system, where ones' personal con
tributions are going into an actuarially sound trust fund.
In fact, it is an inter-generational transfer scheme, where
current taxes fund current benefits.
Small deficits appeared in the 1950's and 60's, and
have mushroomed to where, without further action, the
Retirement Trust Fund would have run out by 1983, and
the Disability Trust Fund by 1979! The scheme, at pre
sent, has an unfunded liability of on the order of $4
trillion.
Disaster looms
This looming disaster has been caused by a number of
problems, which Congress has only just gotten around
to dealing with. The pay-roll tax, which finances the
social security scheme, is extremely regressive, since
only a portion of the total earned wage (the "wage
base") is taxed, income, such as interest,
is not.
And far more insidious, the use of earmarked funds, in
conjunction with the insurance myth, has clouded the
determination of the benefits and costs; the system has
been immune from the usual trade-offs made between
differing priorities. Thus politics has more easily en
couraged increasing benefits without regard to future
cost and productivity implications.
A more serious and underlying problem is the demog
raphic change taking place— the population is aging. In
1940 there were 150 workers per recipient. Today there
are only three, and around the year 2025 there will only
be two. This could spell disaster for those of us who now
have to pay increasing government levies and will then
face the prospect of insufficient resources and/or an
unwilling work force when we retire.
Goals confused
Another serious problem, resulting from the perver
sion of the original purpose of the system, is that we
have mixed insurance and welfare goals. The benefits
paid by the scheme are highly progressive, and are only
weakly correlated with ones' contribution to the
scheme.
This confused system utilizes a most inappropriate
vehicle for income redistribution. There are many diffe
rent, and better, tools for promoting the progressive
redistribution of income — such as the progressive in
come tax. Every component of the total federal imbrog
lio need not promote this single goal.

Finally, there are a number of smaller factors, like
substantially increased benefits, automatic cost in
creases, and the high unemployment rate, that have also
adversely affected the scheme.
Bureaucrats bungle
Action needs to be taken now, while there is still time
to salvage our future. First, we should abolish the sys
tem. Obviously, previous government commitments to
the present victims would have to be kept. However, the
paternalism of the system is disheartening — it imposes
choices on people that they themselves would not have
made.
The variety of individual choices made in the absence
of this system would be a safeguard against dumb
bureaucrats imposing a wrong decision on everyone,
and would increase personal freedom. The government
should only facilitate the collection and dissemination of
information, so that people could make more informed
decisions.
If, to be realistic, one accepts bureaucratic pater
nalism as a given, we should simply mandate a minimum
level of protection which individuals must purchase —
allowing them to buy from private insurers, if they wish.
Though people who are currently on social security have
received a relatively good deal, considering the amount
and number of years they paid taxes, this is not the case
with our generation.
Younger workers, like ourselves, are being cheated —
we could gain a similar annuity and survivor's insurance
package at a lesser price in the private market. There is
no sense in allowing the government to take our money,
steal a percentage, and then give it back.
This point was well-illustrated when New York City left
the social security scheme because it could save $183
million a year with a private plan, and when San Jose
negotiated a package of benefits 25 per cent higher and 3
percent cheaper than social security. There is, in fact, no
better testimony to the fact that we are getting ripped-off
than the fact that no federal worker, Congressman, or
Senator must suffer through what our elderly now do,
and what we will do.
Restructure insurance
Assuming the first two suggestions are turned down,
we should substitute general revenues in place of the
pay-roll tax to fund the system. This would finally de
stroy the insurance myth, and we would perceive the
costs of the scheme for just what they are — costs. We
could then openly determine the value of the benefits in
relation to other social priorities and private interests.
In any case, the insurance and welfare functions of the
system should be separated, with the transfer goal hand
les by a more efficacious program, where it could com
pete openly with other government priorities. Social
Security should be limited to "insurance."
Finally, this disaster should apply evenly to all; there
fore, federal workers, and Congressmen and Senators,
should be brought into the system. This would result in
an equitable distribution of the misery, and might have
the miraculous effect of spurring the Congress to adopt
one of the preceding proposals.
Unfortunately, our rulers in Washington are nearinga
massive breach of faith with the nation — they have
created, in the words of columnist Nicholas Van
Hoffmann, an "antisocial insecurity system." The time
to act is now.

tributions are going into an actuarially sound trust fund.
In fact, it is an inter-generational transfer scheme, where
current taxes fund current benefits.
Small deficits appeared in the 1950's and 60's, and
have mushroomed to where, without further action, the
Retirement Trust Fund would have run out by 1983, and
the Disability Trust Fund by 1979! The scheme, at pre
sent, has an unfunded liability of on the order of $4
trillion.
Disaster looms
This looming disaster has been caused by a number of
problems, which Congress has only just gotten around
to dealing with. The pay-roll tax, which finances the
social security scheme, is extremely regressive, since
only a portion of the total earned wage (the "wage
base") is taxed, income, such as interest,
is not.
And far more insidious, the use of earmarked funds, in
conjunction with the insurance myth, has clouded the
determination of the benefits and costs; the system has
been immune from the usual trade-offs made between
differing priorities. Thus politics has more easily en
couraged increasing benefits without regard to future
cost and productivity implications.
A more serious and underlying problem is the demog
raphic change taking place— the population is aging. In
1940 there were 150 workers per recipient. Today there
are only three, and around the year 2025 there will only
be two. This could spell disaster for those of us who now
have to pay increasing government levies and will then
face the prospect of insufficient resources and/or an
unwilling work force when we retire.
Goals confused
Another serious problem, resulting from the perver
sion of the original purpose of the system, is that we
have mixed insurance and welfare goals. The benefits
paid by the scheme are highly progressive, and are only
weakly correlated with ones' contribution to the
scheme.
This confused system utilizes a most inappropriate
vehicle for income redistribution. There are many diffe
rent, and better, tools for promoting the progressive
redistribution of income — such as the progressive in
come tax. Every component of the total federal imbrog
lio need not promote this single goal.

Finally, there are a number of smaller factors, like
substantially increased benefits, automatic cost in
creases, and the high unemployment rate, that have also
adversely affected the scheme.
Bureaucrats bungle
Action needs to be taken now, while there is still time
to salvage our future. First, we should abolish the sys
tem. Obviously, previous government commitments to
the present victims would have to be kept. However, the
paternalism of the system is disheartening — it imposes
choices on people that they themselves would not have
made.
The variety of individual choices made in the absence
of this system would be a safeguard against dumb
bureaucrats imposing a wrong decision on everyone,
and would increase personal freedom. The government
should only facilitate the collection and dissemination of
information, so that people could make more informed
decisions.
If, to be realistic, one accepts bureaucratic pater
nalism as a given, we should simply mandate a minimum
level of protection which individuals must purchase —
allowing them to buy from private insurers, if they wish.
Though people who are currently on social security have
received a relatively good deal, considering the amount
and number of years they paid taxes, this is not the case
with our generation.
Younger workers, like ourselves, are being cheated —
we could gain a similar annuity and survivor's insurance
package at a lesser price in the private market. There is
no sense in allowing the government to take our money,
steal a percentage, and then give it back.
This point was well-illustrated when New York City left
the social security scheme because it could save $183
million a year with a private plan, and when San Jose
negotiated a package of benefits 25 per cent higher and 3
percent cheaper than social security. There is, in fact, no
better testimony to the fact that we are getting ripped-off
than the fact that no federal worker, Congressman, or
Senator must suffer through what our elderly now do,
and what we will do.
Restructure insurance
Assuming the first two suggestions are turned down,
we should substitute general revenues in place of the
pay-roll tax to fund the system. This would finally de
stroy the insurance myth, and we would perceive the
costs of the scheme for just what they are — costs. We
could then openly determine the value of the benefits in
relation to other social priorities and private interests.
In any case, the insurance and welfare functions of the
system should be separated, with the transfer goal hand
les by a more efficacious program, where it could com
pete openly with other government priorities. Social
Security should be limited to "insurance."
Finally, this disaster should apply evenly to all; there
fore, federal workers, and Congressmen and Senators,
should be brought into the system. This would result in
an equitable distribution of the misery, and might have
the miraculous effect of spurring the Congress to adopt
one of the preceding proposals.
Unfortunately, our rulers in Washington are nearinga
massive breach of faith with the nation — they have
created, in the words of columnist Nicholas Van
Hoffmann, an "antisocial insecurity system." The time
to act is now.

Congress is deservedly coming under increasing
pressure for the crime it committed late last year — the
massive increase in social security taxes. After long re
fusing to face up to the actuarial arithmetic that could
no longer be avoided, Congress panicked and wrecked
its chance to really reform the social security scheme.
The law passed by Congress, and signed by Carter,
provides for a tripling of the maximum tax betwen 1979
and 1987. The added amount of money that will be stolen
by the government is a staggering $227 billion.
The cowardly Congress postponed the effective date
of the tax increase to Jan. 1, 7979 — after the next elec
tion. However, this pitiful tactic did not work, because
an increase, scheduled under a previous law, took effect
this Jan. 1 instead. Thus the wrath of the voters is being
felt on Capitol Hill.
One needs to look in more detail at the situation

couraged increasing benefits without regard to future
cost and productivity implications.
A more serious and underlying problem is the demog
raphic change taking place— the population is aging. In
1940 there were 150 workers per recipient. Today there
are only three, and around the year 2025 there will only
be two. This could spell disaster for those of us who now
have to pay increasing government levies and will then
face the prospect of insufficient resources and/or an

Congress is deservedly coming under increasing
pressure for the crime it committed late last year — the
massive increase in social security taxes. After long re
fusing to face up to the actuarial arithmetic that could
no longer be avoided, Congress panicked and wrecked
its chance to really reform the social security scheme.
The law passed by Congress, and signed by Carter,
provides for a tripling of the maximum tax betwen 1979
and 1987. The added amount of money that will be stolen
by the government is a staggering $227 billion.
The cowardly Congress postponed the effective date
of the tax increase to Jan. 1, 7979 — after the next elec
tion. However, this pitiful tactic did not work, because
an increase, scheduled under a previous law, took effect
this Jan. 1 instead. Thus the wrath of the voters is being
felt on Capitol Hill.
One needs to look in more detail at the situation
which caused such disturbing action. Despite the in
creasing awareness of the public, the government has
long continued to foster the myth of social security
being an insurance system, where ones' personal con
tributions are going into an actuarially sound trust fund.
In fact, it is an inter-generational transfer scheme, where
current taxes fund current benefits.
Small deficits appeared in the 1950's and 60's, and
have mushroomed to where, without further action, the
Retirement Trust Fund would have run out by 1983, and
the Disability Trust Fund by 1979! The scheme, at pre
sent, has an unfunded liability of on the order of $4
trillion.
Disaster looms
This looming disaster has been caused by a number of
problems, which Congress has only just gotten around
to dealing with. The pay-roll tax, which finances the
social security scheme, is extremely regressive, since
only a portion of the total earned wage (the "wage
base") is taxed, income, such as interest,
is not.
And far more insidious, the use of earmarked funds, in
conjunction with the insurance myth, has clouded the
determination of the benefits and costs; the system has
been immune from the usual trade-offs made between
differing priorities. Thus politics has more easily en
couraged increasing benefits without regard to future
cost and productivity implications.
A more serious and underlying problem is the demog
raphic change taking place— the population is aging. In
1940 there were 150 workers per recipient. Today there
are only three, and around the year 2025 there will only
be two. This could spell disaster for those of us who now
