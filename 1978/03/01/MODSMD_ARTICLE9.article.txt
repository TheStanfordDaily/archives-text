# Christians don't threaten liberty

In a column entitled "Christians
threaten to control U.S." (Daily, Feb.
27), Pan Demetrakakes makes two
basic points: 1) the Christians of this
country — especially the evangeli
cals — are becoming aware of their
potential political power, and may
organize; 2) Christian policymakers
may fail to balance a sense of fairness
towards non-believers with their
feelings of obligation to Christ.
Extrapolating from these two pos
sibilities, Demetrakakes warns
against an oppressive dictatorship by
Christians — apparently established
through the organization of Christ
ians into a massive pressure group,
or through the appearance of an ir
responsible demagogue who will
utilize a Christian political base in his
rise to power.
First, there is nothing inherently
wrong with any group organizing
and lobbying in favor of their views,
unless blatant sedition is involved —
which is not the case here. In fact,
American politics assumes that
groups with differenent viewpoints
will participate in the political pro
cess. Would Demetrakakes deny
Christians this right? I doubt it.
Politics metes morals
Perhaps the concern is that Christ
ians are trying to impose their morals
on the population at large. But, con
sider the following: laws banning ra
cial segregation, laws against false
advertising, even laws against mur
der and robbery are based on moral
ity. Politics serves not to avoid moral
legislation, but to decide what moral
ity is most widely acceptable — how
are Christians going to impose a dic
tatorship by lobbying in favor of their
beliefs, if indeed they mobilize a

cohesive pressure group (a very
doubtful proposition)?
Specifically, Demetrakakes men
tions that Christians may work to
have objectionable television prog
rams removed, or to push through an
anti-abortion amendment. Televi
sion today is already subject to strict
(non-Christian) censorship — are
Christians to be condemned for try
ing to influence these policies?
Some Christians feel that abortion
is legal murder — as do many non-
Christians. Should they merely sit by
while they believe someone is get
ting away with murder? Demet
rakakas makes the somewhat amus
ing logical leap from the fact that
some Christians would like to
change the status quo, to the asser
tion that "Today's Christians
.. .could very possibly become to
morrow's dictators."
Tripartite contains
Demetrakakes' second point is
that Christian policymakers may
prove irresponsible. This argument
lacks uniqueness: anybody could act
irresponsibly, neglecting the in
terests of others in favor of his own
beliefs. Furthermore, we have a
tripartite system of government,
which contains checks and balances
which have historically been suffi
cient to contain excesses. Is there
some quality peculiar to Christians
which would induce support of a
demagogue, or would cause be
havior which patently violates the
rights of a minority?
Despite Demetrakakes unkind im
plication that all enthusiastic Christ
ians are either "benighted (i.e. ig
norant) or just plain hypocritical,"
Christians are not mere dupes for

any would-be dictator who happens
by, nor are they anxious to oppress.
Rather, the personal value of all indi
viduals, forgiveness for any trans
gression, and love of one's neighbor
are basic Christian principles — dic
tatorships are not made of such stuff.
Christians alertly involved
The example Demetrakakes raises
is Elmer Gantry, an obviously unba
lanced character. He is no more a
typical Christian than Hitler was a
typical German. There is always
danger of a psychotic somehow gain
ing power, but to imply that Christ
ians are more likely to support such a
person than any other group (e.g.
labor, students, the poor) is not jus
tified.
President Carter, after all, drew
only 50 per cent of the vote — and he
was the strongest Christian candi
date in years. An Elmer Gantry, appe
aling to mass emotion as Demet
rakakes suggests, could hardly ap
proach that total — Christians have
as much ability as anyone to see
through the facade of a dangerous
demagogue.
In short, Christian political organi
zation seems to be only normal par
ticipation in the American political
process, and projections of a Christ
ian dictator are based on a view of

Christians as a group of inferior intel
lects and unreasonable minds, easy
prey to a conniving or misguided
huckster. My final objection is to
Demetrakes' rhetoric: Christianity is
not a "superstition," it is a relation
ship with God.
