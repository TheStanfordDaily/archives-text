# Cowell sets pregnancy statistics
## 
### Helen Nissenbaum 
During the 1976-77 academic year,
Cowell Student Health Center fi
gures showed that over 500 pre
gnancy tests were done there.
Of the 144 women with positive
tests, 62 of them sought counseling
at Cowell's Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS).
All but three of these women were
seeking advice and counseling on
termination of pregnancy, reported
jane Pao and Charlotte Siegel, coun
selors at CAPS.
Pao added that the number of un
wanted pregnancies could well be
more than 62, since some students
may have sought the services of out
side agencies.
Almost 70 per cent of the coun
seled women were undergraduates.
The rest were "graduates, student
dependents or post docs," Pao ad
ded.
Two-thirds of the women were
using some form of contraception.
Pao said it is not clear whether pre
gnancies resulted from failure of
contraceptives or "improper use."
Extensive study
In an extensive study by Dr. John
Dorman of Cowell, student pre
gnancy figures were compiled and
analyzed for the years 1973 to 1975.
The study, to be published in the
journal of the American College
Health Association, was stimulated
partly by a "concern that it (number
of unwanted pregnancies) had gone
up" over this three-year period,
Dorman said.
Results of this study showed that
1.4 per cent of both graduate and
undergraduate females here had
"unwanted pregnancies." While this
figure seems high, Dorman said fi
gures from other colleges have been
reported as ranging between 5 and 10
per cent.
There were small increases from
year to year, but certain trends pre
vailed throughout the years, Dorman
said. For example, pregnancy reports
are highest during October and De-
cember, suggesting that in general
students "are getting pregnant when
they're not here," Dorman said.
Mechanical methods
Dorman's study showed that
about one-third of students wih un
planned pregnancies were not using
contraception. Where contraception
was used, the pill represented the
smallest number and "mechanical
methods" the largest, Dorman re
ported.
Dorman added that despite ad
verse publicity about the pill, the
total number of students using the
pill has not significantly declined. He
added, that 37 per cent of students
with unwanted pregnancies had
used the pill at one time but were
either not using contraception or
were using other methods when
conception occurred.
Senate gives $70
The ASSU Senate recently ap
proved an expenditure of up to $70 to
provide the student body with con
traceptive information.
Tom McCormack, ASSU Senator
and member of the Committee on
Services to Students, said that he
hopes the committee can "educate
students on the availability" of re
sources on campus.
He said that the committee does
not intend to use "scare tactics," but
will attempt to convey "facts," stres
sing that "Stanford is not immune to
a nationwide problem" of unwanted

pregnancies.
Dorman said getting more infor
mation to students "may improve
things to some extent" but that he
doubts the problem "will be elimi
nated."
Both Dorman and Pao indicated
that contraceptives and contracep
tive counseling are readily available
to students. Pao added that it is up to
individual students to take action.

analyzed for the years 1973 to 1975.
The study, to be published in the
journal of the American College
Health Association, was stimulated
partly by a "concern that it (number
of unwanted pregnancies) had gone
up" over this three-year period,
Dorman said.
Results of this study showed that
1.4 per cent of both graduate and
undergraduate females here had
"unwanted pregnancies." While this
figure seems high, Dorman said fi
gures from other colleges have been
reported as ranging between 5 and 10
per cent.
There were small increases from
year to year, but certain trends pre
vailed throughout the years, Dorman
said. For example, pregnancy reports
are highest during October and De-
cember, suggesting that in general
students "are getting pregnant when
they're not here," Dorman said.
Mechanical methods
Dorman's study showed that
about one-third of students wih un
planned pregnancies were not using
contraception. Where contraception
was used, the pill represented the
smallest number and "mechanical
methods" the largest, Dorman re
ported.
Dorman added that despite ad
verse publicity about the pill, the
total number of students using the
pill has not significantly declined. He
added, that 37 per cent of students
with unwanted pregnancies had
used the pill at one time but were
either not using contraception or
were using other methods when
conception occurred.
Senate gives $70
The ASSU Senate recently ap
proved an expenditure of up to $70 to
provide the student body with con
traceptive information.
Tom McCormack, ASSU Senator
and member of the Committee on
Services to Students, said that he
hopes the committee can "educate
students on the availability" of re
sources on campus.
He said that the committee does
not intend to use "scare tactics," but
will attempt to convey "facts," stres
sing that "Stanford is not immune to
a nationwide problem" of unwanted

pregnancies.
Dorman said getting more infor
mation to students "may improve
things to some extent" but that he
doubts the problem "will be elimi
nated."
Both Dorman and Pao indicated
that contraceptives and contracep
tive counseling are readily available
to students. Pao added that it is up to
individual students to take action.
During the 1976-77 academic year,
Cowell Student Health Center fi
gures showed that over 500 pre
gnancy tests were done there.
Of the 144 women with positive
tests, 62 of them sought counseling
at Cowell's Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS).
All but three of these women were
seeking advice and counseling on
termination of pregnancy, reported
jane Pao and Charlotte Siegel, coun
selors at CAPS.
Pao added that the number of un
wanted pregnancies could well be
more than 62, since some students
may have sought the services of out
side agencies.
Almost 70 per cent of the coun
seled women were undergraduates.
The rest were "graduates, student
dependents or post docs," Pao ad
ded.
Two-thirds of the women were
using some form of contraception.
Pao said it is not clear whether pre
gnancies resulted from failure of
contraceptives or "improper use."
Extensive study
In an extensive study by Dr. John
Dorman of Cowell, student pre
gnancy figures were compiled and
analyzed for the years 1973 to 1975.
