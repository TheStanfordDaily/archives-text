# Cowell sets pregnancy statistics

### Helen Nissenbaum 
During the 1976-77 academic year,
Cowell Student Health Center fi
gures showed that over 500 pre
gnancy tests were done there.
Of the 144 women with positive
tests, 62 of them sought counseling
at Cowell's Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS).
All but three of these women were
seeking advice and counseling on
termination of pregnancy, reported
jane Pao and Charlotte Siegel, coun
selors at CAPS.
Pao added that the number of un
wanted pregnancies could well be
more than 62, since some students
may have sought the services of out

Almost 70 per cent of the coun

The rest were "graduates, student
dependents or post docs," Pao ad
ded.
Two-thirds of the women were
using some form of contraception.
Pao said it is not clear whether pre
gnancies resulted from failure of
contraceptives or "improper use."
Extensive study
In an extensive study by Dr. John
Dorman of Cowell, student pre
gnancy figures were compiled and
analyzed for the years 1973 to 1975.
The study, to be published in the
journal of the American College
Health Association, was stimulated
partly by a "concern that it (number
of unwanted pregnancies) had gone
up" over this three-year period,
Dorman said.
Results of this study showed that
1.4 per cent of both graduate and
undergraduate females here had
"unwanted pregnancies." While this
figure seems high, Dorman said fi
gures from other colleges have been
reported as ranging between 5 and 10
per cent.
There were small increases from
year to year, but certain trends pre
vailed throughout the years, Dorman
said. For example, pregnancy reports
are highest during October and De-
