# Anti-smoking campaign debated
## Wrong means to right end 
### 
David Sartoris

During the past several months, a
massive anti-smoking campaign has
been sweeping across America and
causing much heated debate. A re
cent Gallup poll showed that two of
three Americans favor special areas
for smoking in public places, while
another 16 per cent favor a total ban
on smoking in such places — trains,
buses, planes, restaurants, and of
fices. Only 10 per cent favor no re
striction at all, while 40 percent think
cigarette taxes should be increased,
one-third favor a ban on cigarette ad
vertising, and 19 per cent would sup
port a ban on the sale of cigarettes.
While certainly beneficial to the
health of society as a whole, such
ideas clearly transgress individual
freedom and personal rights.
Cigarette smoking has long been
recognized as a significant risk factor
for respiratory disease, lung cancer,
and cardiovascular problems.
The choice between habit and
health has traditionally been left up
to the private citizen, with incentive
toward the latter printed on his/her
cigarette package. However, legisla
tion such as )oseph Califano's re
cently proposed anti-smoking bill
threaten to drastically change the

picture.
Supporters of the anti-smoking
movement maintain that cigarettes
are harmful not only to the user, but
to the environment and the health of
others as well. However, the extent
to which cigarette smoke contributes
to air pollution is minimal when
compared to such felons as industry
and the automobile. Likewise, no
controlled study has yet de
monstrated that non-smokers who
are in frequent contact with cigarette
smoke have a higher incidence of
heart or lung disease.
Unjust analogy drawn
In promoting these unproven be
liefs, anti-smoking followers drawan
unjustified analogy between cigar
ettes and alcohol. The decision to con
sume liquor and/or become ineb
riated is a matter of personal choice,
but only under certain cir
cumstances. The drunk driver, for
example, is a clear threat to the
well-being of other highway users,
and appropriate laws exist to control
such behavior. In this case, indi
vidual freedom is rightly violated;
however, in the absence of hard
supportive data, comparable re
straints cannot be placed upon the
smoker.
It has also been argued that anti
smoking legislation will lower the in
cidence of smoking and secondarily
lead to a healthier American society.
However, any smoker who has tried
can testify that kicking the habit is no
easy task, even in the face of re
peated warnings from the medical
profession.
Personal will-power or lack thereof
ultimately determines the victor in
the live-for-the-moment vs.
preserve-for-the-future struggle
which every smoker must deal with
on a daily basis. Thus, those likely to
quit presently have sufficient incen
tive, and the others will not be influ
enced by more.
Educate young people
These remarks are not meant to
criticize the goals of a nationwide

anti-smokingcampaign, but ratherto
point out that the wrong means to
the right end are presently being
emphasized. In order to effectively
reduce the incidence of smoking in
the future, efforts should be directed
toward education of young people.
Most smokers began their habit as
teens, succumbing to peer pressure
before sensible personal judgement
had sufficiently developed. By warn
ing children of the hazards of cigar
ettes at an early age and in an or
ganized fashion, a healthier popula
tion with intact personal freedom
will result.
Specifically, funds intended for
implementation of anti-smoking
legislation as currently proposed
should instead be used for formal
health courses, to begin at the early
elementary school level. Churches,
youth groups, and community ser
vice organizations might also be allo
cated funds for health educational
purposes, and parents encouraged
to instruct their youngsters on the ills
of smoking.
Obviously, this approach could
also be used to successfully reduce
the incidence of drug abuse, poor
dietary habits, and alcohol consump
tion in the future, further enhancing
the health status of American soci
ety.
Thus, the most effective approach
to the issue of cigarette smoking is
not to make the right decision for the
individual but instead to help him
make that decision himself. If we are
to build a healthier American public
with more sensible personal habits,
the initial target must be youth, a
group more likely to heed warnings
than the population at large. While it
has been argued that children of
smoking parents are less apt to re
spect arguments against the habit, an
organized educational effort might
result in these youngsters teaching
their parents a thing or two.

not to make the right decision for the

During the past several months, a
massive anti-smoking campaign has
been sweeping across America and
causing much heated debate. A re
cent Gallup poll showed that two of
three Americans favor special areas
for smoking in public places, while
another 16 per cent favor a total ban
on smoking in such places — trains,
buses, planes, restaurants, and of
fices. Only 10 per cent favor no re
striction at all, while 40 percent think
cigarette taxes should be increased,
one-third favor a ban on cigarette ad
vertising, and 19 per cent would sup
port a ban on the sale of cigarettes.
While certainly beneficial to the
health of society as a whole, such
ideas clearly transgress individual
freedom and personal rights.
Cigarette smoking has long been
recognized as a significant risk factor
for respiratory disease, lung cancer,
and cardiovascular problems.
The choice between habit and
health has traditionally been left up
to the private citizen, with incentive
toward the latter printed on his/her
cigarette package. However, legisla
tion such as )oseph Califano's re
cently proposed anti-smoking bill
threaten to drastically change the

picture.
Supporters of the anti-smoking
movement maintain that cigarettes
are harmful not only to the user, but
to the environment and the health of
others as well. However, the extent
to which cigarette smoke contributes
to air pollution is minimal when
compared to such felons as industry
and the automobile. Likewise, no
controlled study has yet de
monstrated that non-smokers who
are in frequent contact with cigarette
smoke have a higher incidence of
heart or lung disease.
Unjust analogy drawn
In promoting these unproven be
liefs, anti-smoking followers drawan
unjustified analogy between cigar
ettes and alcohol. The decision to con
sume liquor and/or become ineb
riated is a matter of personal choice,
but only under certain cir
cumstances. The drunk driver, for
example, is a clear threat to the
well-being of other highway users,
and appropriate laws exist to control
such behavior. In this case, indi
vidual freedom is rightly violated;
however, in the absence of hard
supportive data, comparable re
straints cannot be placed upon the
smoker.
It has also been argued that anti
smoking legislation will lower the in
cidence of smoking and secondarily
lead to a healthier American society.
However, any smoker who has tried
can testify that kicking the habit is no
easy task, even in the face of re
peated warnings from the medical
profession.
Personal will-power or lack thereof
ultimately determines the victor in
the live-for-the-moment vs.
preserve-for-the-future struggle
which every smoker must deal with
on a daily basis. Thus, those likely to
quit presently have sufficient incen
tive, and the others will not be influ
enced by more.
Educate young people
These remarks are not meant to
criticize the goals of a nationwide

anti-smokingcampaign, but ratherto
point out that the wrong means to
the right end are presently being
emphasized. In order to effectively
reduce the incidence of smoking in
the future, efforts should be directed
toward education of young people.
Most smokers began their habit as
teens, succumbing to peer pressure
before sensible personal judgement
had sufficiently developed. By warn
ing children of the hazards of cigar
ettes at an early age and in an or
ganized fashion, a healthier popula
tion with intact personal freedom
will result.
Specifically, funds intended for
implementation of anti-smoking
legislation as currently proposed
should instead be used for formal
health courses, to begin at the early
elementary school level. Churches,
youth groups, and community ser
vice organizations might also be allo
cated funds for health educational
purposes, and parents encouraged
to instruct their youngsters on the ills
of smoking.
Obviously, this approach could
also be used to successfully reduce
the incidence of drug abuse, poor
dietary habits, and alcohol consump
tion in the future, further enhancing
the health status of American soci
ety.
Thus, the most effective approach
to the issue of cigarette smoking is
not to make the right decision for the
individual but instead to help him
make that decision himself. If we are
