# Flying club offers fun, cheap lessons

If you think the view from
Hoover Tower is something,
you should see Stanford from
5000 feet.
My experience with planes
until now was a yearly hassle
with airport traffic and baggage
merry-go-rounds. But a small
plane flight with the Stanford
Flying Club is a completely dif
ferent experience. For a
member of the Flying Club fly
ing is as easy as renting a car.
He simply phones ahead, picks
up the key and is on his way
with no lines, no tickets, no
traffic.
We were flying over the
campus in no less than 20 mi
nutes after leaving it. This av
ailability, the freedom and the
view are what make flying so
incredible.
The Stanford Flying Club is
actually one of the oldest clubs

on campus. Its membership
has been increasing steadily
since 1975, and there are pre
sently about 100 members.
Approximately 40-50 members
are active flyers, while the
others enjoy additional be
nefits the club offers such as
interesting seminars, field trips
and films.
Students here and alumni
get quite a bargain by joining
the club. Membership in
cludes reduced rates, 60 per
cent less than rates charged by
local flight schools; instruc
tion; insurance and planes.
You can have your solo pilot
license in less than five months
for between $300-400. This may
sound expensive, but a sticker
price on learning to ski, for
example, would be compara
ble.
The club has a pool of seven
planes at Palo Alto airport

which is less than 15 minutes
from campus. The smallest
plane, the Cessna-150 is used
mostly for instruction. The
club has larger 4-seat Cessnas
for longer flights.
The Cessna-150 is parked in
the middle of White Plaza dur
ing registration each quarter.
The club used to land the plane
right on the soccer field until
the University objected. Now
they taxi the plane from the
airport down Embarcadero and
Palm Drive to White Plaza.
Doing your own flying is re
latively inexpensive. For
example, a flight to Las Vegas
costs only $50 round trip. By
car the trip would be twice as
expensive and would take
twice as long. And as last year's
president Dave Carlson
pointed out, it is one of the
greatest dates there is.
Although some people are

attracted to the club because of
these economic pluses, most
are in it because they are sim
ply in love with flying. I could
sense this from talking with
club members, but I didn't
grasp it all until they took me
up too. Now I can see that it is
the calm freedom and the
magnificent scenery that make
flying so appealing. And it's
fun!
Some upcoming club events
are a field trip to the mainte
nance facilities of United Air
lines on March 2, a night of av
iation films on March 23 and a
seminar hosted by Richard
Shivell of Aeronautics Depart
ment here on April 5.
The club may eventually
offer ground school flight
courses for credit. These
courses are needed prepara
tion for the written part of the
license examination.
