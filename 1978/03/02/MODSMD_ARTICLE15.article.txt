# Casa Italiana chefs whip up great food, units
## 
### Richard Whitmore Barbie Skinner 
Sunday nights when the cook is gone
from La Casa Italiana, six or seven in
dustrious students make their own
meals and at the same time earn a unit
of University credit through the Italian
Cooking Seminar.
The Italian cuisine is prepared under
the supervision of Silvana Simoncini,
who also teaches language classes
here. The menus come from her collec
tion of 4000 recipes, and many of them
are old family secrets from Italy.
Simoncini's students take pains to
adhere to Italian cooking customs. For
instance, Italian-style roasts are fried
instead of the American method of
oven-roasting. And since Europe uses
the metric system, everyone knows the
conversions from grams to ounces. Of
course, all conversation is in Italian.
Sumptuous meals
For a fee of $20 for nine weeks, the
students and assorted moochers
eat sumptuous meals such as Risotto
con Asparagi (rice with asparagus).
Zucchine Trifolate 'a zucchini dish), At

rosto Piemonte (roast in wine sauce),
and Torta di Nocciole (nut cake) for de
ssert. For a beverage — what else? —
wine imported from Italy. Any left-over
money is refunded to students.
The food is usually first-rate. "We'll
put Frankie, Johnny, and Luigi's out of
business," said Debbie Lahr, one of the
student chefs. It is so good, in fact, that
"Most of what we make gets half-eaten
before it gets put on the table," she
said.
The class's convenience is no small
part of the students' enthusiasm. "It's a
good way to get a meal on Sunday
night," admitted Orlando Lucero. Lahr
added, "It's cheaper than lack's and a
lot better."
Pollenta
Although most of the time you "eat
so much that afterwards you don't do
anything but collapse on your back,"
according to Lahr, there has been a
minor disaster or two. The pollenta of
one week is already a legend.
"It's like grits, only heavier,"
explained Lucero. "It's used by a lot of
the poor people because it's cheap."
Apparently no one had Italian peasant

taste buds, and the pollenta was de
scribed by one unenthusiastic eater as
"a mountain of clay." Its final resting
place was never mentioned.
The budding chefs are fulfilling an
Italian house requirement of enrolling
in a seminar each quarter, semi
nar is designed by demand," said Jim
Hartley, student organizer of the clas
ses, and "you don't have to be in the
house to enroll." Next quarter's semi
nar will be on the history of wine, and it
will include wine-tasting.
Not a mick
Lest you think this class is just
another mick unit, "There is a final,"
said Lucero. "We're having a buffet
supper. We'll get a menu together and
each prepare a dish. We'll have Silvana,
her husband and some others be
judges."
Simoncini's talents run in the family
as her mother was a professional cook
in Italy.
"I don't even know when I started
cooking," she said "but I was very lit
tle."
Simoncini is married to an Italian

engineer who will be working in the
U.S. for four or five years. As far as her
hobbies go, "I spend all my free time
cooking ... I like to cook!" She is paid
from Italian house funds.
Different styles
Simoncini stresses the different
styles of cooking in different regions of
Italy. Lucero explained some of the dif
ferences in simple terms, "Some reg
ions cook with a lot of tomato, some
use of a lot of pollenta."
For veterans of the Italian overseas
program, such food brings back
memories. "It's a lot like Florence,"
said Lahr pointing out yet another be
nefit of the class, "A lot of us have been
overseas but didn't know how to cook
the food we were eating."
The fun in turning piles of zucchini,
onion, nuts and meat into a good meal
comes from "everyone . . . doing a lit
tle bit of everything," said Simoncini.
Even those who choose to remain unin
volved reap the benefits. Margaret Jen
sen, an Italian house resident, claimed
"the leftovers on Monday are always
great!"
