"It looks like bike thefts have fallen off a bit," said
Detective Carl Gielitz of police services when asked
about the current bike theft situation on campus.
"Our program in registration has cut down a little bit
the number of bikes being stolen," he said.
According to Gielitz, there were 51 bicycles reported
stolen or found in January and February of this year,
compared with 78 reports from the same period last

"Almost all the bikes recovered have been reported,"
he said.

checks them out, its very hard to trace the rightful owner
if they don't know the frame number.
"Almost 100 per cent of the recovered bicycles are
licensed," he added.
According to Gielitz, many theft reports come in
around quarter break.

more careless about where they put their bikes and how
securely they are locked."
Found in trees
When asked where the stolen bicycles are usually
found, Gielitz said "in every place you can imagine,
including inside classrooms, locked to trees on Palm
Drive, or even parked in front of the police station.
"We more or less look in the outlying areas where
