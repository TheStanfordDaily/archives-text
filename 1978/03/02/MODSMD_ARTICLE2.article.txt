# Registration cuts bike thievery
## 
### Monika Guttman 
"It looks like bike thefts have fallen off a bit," said
Detective Carl Gielitz of police services when asked
about the current bike theft situation on campus.
"Our program in registration has cut down a little bit
the number of bikes being stolen," he said.
According to Gielitz, there were 51 bicycles reported
stolen or found in January and February of this year,
compared with 78 reports from the same period last
year.
"Almost all the bikes recovered have been reported,"
he said.
A lot of thefts, according to Gielitz, are done by pro
fessional bike theft rings which come to campus in a van
late at night and lift several 10-speed bikes.
"We broke up a couple of rings," he said, "but others
are still operating."
Other times it turns out that bicycles reported stolen
were merely borrowed by friends who were late to class,
he said.
Recovery hard
Gielitz stressed the fact that it is very hard to recover

stolen bicycles if they are not licensed.
"Many bikes, when stolen, are not used here on cam
pus," he said. "They are taken out to Redwood City, Los
Altos and Menlo Park, and when the officer out there
checks them out, its very hard to trace the rightful owner
if they don't know the frame number.
"Almost 100 per cent of the recovered bicycles are
licensed," he added.
According to Gielitz, many theft reports come in
around quarter break.
"Because of exams and the fact that everyone is get
ting ready to go home," he said, "people are just a little
more careless about where they put their bikes and how
securely they are locked."
Found in trees
When asked where the stolen bicycles are usually
found, Gielitz said "in every place you can imagine,
including inside classrooms, locked to trees on Palm
Drive, or even parked in front of the police station.
"We more or less look in the outlying areas where
people nave uncneu uiKt-s iu luiuc uolr .me. w.i, ..v.
said.
Gielitz maintained that bicycle security is a definite
concern on campus, and his office is producing a pam
phlet to be distributed some time in September.
"A lot of bikes aren't secured too securely even when
they're locked," he said.
Diana Conklin, services manager at Tresidder Union,
is involved in an ad hoc committee on bicycle safety
which is "mostly concerned with how to keep people
from killing themselves while riding on campus." But
certain members of the group have ideas about improv
ing security with such things as "Rack Three" bicycle
racks and bike lockers.
Security important
"Bike security is an important issue, and no doubt will
be taken up by the bicycle committee which is now
being formed," said Conklin.
But an important preventive measure against bike
thefts, according to Gielitz, is registration.
"Registered bikes are stolen less and recovered
more," he said. He added that the next registration drive
will be March 9 at Tresidder Union between 11:30 a.m.
and 1: JO p.m. At that time, there will also be an exhibit
on bicycle safety.

stolen bicycles if they are not licensed.
"Many bikes, when stolen, are not used here on cam
pus," he said. "They are taken out to Redwood City, Los
Altos and Menlo Park, and when the officer out there
checks them out, its very hard to trace the rightful owner
if they don't know the frame number.
"Almost 100 per cent of the recovered bicycles are
licensed," he added.
According to Gielitz, many theft reports come in
around quarter break.
"Because of exams and the fact that everyone is get
ting ready to go home," he said, "people are just a little
more careless about where they put their bikes and how
securely they are locked."
Found in trees
When asked where the stolen bicycles are usually
found, Gielitz said "in every place you can imagine,
including inside classrooms, locked to trees on Palm
Drive, or even parked in front of the police station.
"We more or less look in the outlying areas where
people nave uncneu uiKt-s iu luiuc uolr .me. w.i, ..v.
said.
Gielitz maintained that bicycle security is a definite
concern on campus, and his office is producing a pam
phlet to be distributed some time in September.
"A lot of bikes aren't secured too securely even when
they're locked," he said.
Diana Conklin, services manager at Tresidder Union,
is involved in an ad hoc committee on bicycle safety
which is "mostly concerned with how to keep people
from killing themselves while riding on campus." But
certain members of the group have ideas about improv
ing security with such things as "Rack Three" bicycle
racks and bike lockers.
Security important
"Bike security is an important issue, and no doubt will
be taken up by the bicycle committee which is now
being formed," said Conklin.
But an important preventive measure against bike
thefts, according to Gielitz, is registration.
"Registered bikes are stolen less and recovered
more," he said. He added that the next registration drive
will be March 9 at Tresidder Union between 11:30 a.m.
and 1: JO p.m. At that time, there will also be an exhibit
on bicycle safety.
"It looks like bike thefts have fallen off a bit," said
Detective Carl Gielitz of police services when asked
about the current bike theft situation on campus.
"Our program in registration has cut down a little bit
the number of bikes being stolen," he said.
According to Gielitz, there were 51 bicycles reported
stolen or found in January and February of this year,
compared with 78 reports from the same period last
year.
"Almost all the bikes recovered have been reported,"
he said.
A lot of thefts, according to Gielitz, are done by pro
fessional bike theft rings which come to campus in a van
late at night and lift several 10-speed bikes.
"We broke up a couple of rings," he said, "but others
are still operating."
Other times it turns out that bicycles reported stolen
were merely borrowed by friends who were late to class,
he said.
Recovery hard
Gielitz stressed the fact that it is very hard to recover

stolen bicycles if they are not licensed.
"Many bikes, when stolen, are not used here on cam
pus," he said. "They are taken out to Redwood City, Los
Altos and Menlo Park, and when the officer out there
checks them out, its very hard to trace the rightful owner
if they don't know the frame number.
"Almost 100 per cent of the recovered bicycles are
