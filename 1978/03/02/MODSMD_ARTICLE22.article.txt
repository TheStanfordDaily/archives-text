## Jazz/ted gioia Stan diverse 
### 
In the early days of jazz one
could tell where a musician
was from by listening to his
solos; the Chicago school, the
New Orleans school and the
Kansas City school were not
just names of a musician's cul
tural background but were ac
tual musical styles.
As jazz grew musicians be
came more aware of what
others were playing and the
lines dividing the musicians
became broader. In 1948 one
eitherplayed bop or swing, and
as bop became more complex
it divided into substyles. With
the recent introduction of rock
elements jazz styles have be
come so diverse that the word
jazz can now refer to anything
from l.ouis Armstrong to
Wah-Wah Watson.
Stanley Cowell is a remark
able figure in jazz today if only
for the ease and ability with
which he can move from style
to style. In addition to being a
first-rate performer of modern
jazz, he can also play fluently in
the styles of Fats Waller, Bud
Powell, Earl Hines, Meade Lux
Lewis, or even Scott Joplin.
Cowell's last album for ECM
displayed this diversity with a
brilliant stride version of "You
took Advantage of Me." But
Cowell's latest solo album for
the new Galaxy label, entitled
"Waiting for the Moment" is a
near masterpiece. Every cut on

the album rewards repeated
listening, and the album as a
whole is a miniature history of
jazz piano.
Cowell opens the album
with a )immy Heath ragtime
piece which is a fine example
of that genre; the playing is
tasteful and restrained and as
melodic as some of the better
loplin rags. The boogie
woogie which follows is
equally amazing; but the fol
lowing three numbers are fan
tastic solo piano pieces which
firmly establish Cowell as one
of the premier solo jazz
pianists of our time.
Cowell rips into Bud Powell's
much neglected song "Parisian
Thoroughfare" with his left
hand keeping an unbelievable
tempo with a walking bass
line. The right hand interpo
lates, between melody frag
ments, sounds imitating the
Parisian street noises. The song
comes to an abrupt halt with an
ending which seems a parody
of Bud Powell's original coda
on his 1951 recording of the
tune.
Cowell then follows with a
solo piano version of Theloni
ous Monk's composition
"Round Midnight." This song
has been performed and re
corded by almost every major
jazz figure of the past 25 years,
yet Cowell handles the song
with a freshness that rivals

Monk's own solo interpreta
tion.
The first side closes with a
look at the very roots of jazz.
Cowell plays a brief dance song
on an African thumb piano,
which is a keyboard instrument
which sounds like a very per
cussive celeste.
The second side of the
album is devoted to Cowell
over-dubbed on several
keyboards playing music in the
jazz-rock fusion style. The
music is fresh and full of ideas.
Cowell avoids many of the
cliches and tedious riffs which

are plaguing many of his con
temporaries. The two "Sienna"
numbers are particularly re
freshing.
The album as a whole estab
lishes Cowell as perhaps the
successor to the great )aki
Byard, the eccentric pianist
who could similarly fit into any
style as if he were fitting into
gloves. Byard however has re
mained obscure and unfairly
neglected. With luck Cowell
will have an opportunity to
share his music with a much
larger and appreciative audi
ence.
