## Collard brilliant 
### 
We are fortunate today,
perhaps more so than any
other generation, to be bles
sed with a seemingly inexhaus
tible supply of talented
pianists, both young and old.
Virtually all boast rave reviews
from the critics, but only occa
sionally one comes off as truly
outstanding. Jean-Philippe
Collard is just such a pianist.
The recital which took place
last Saturday evening at
Masonic Auditorium in San
Francisco marked this French
pianist's West Coast debut.
The program consisted of
works by Ravel, Schumann,
Debussy, and Rachmaninoff
identifying Collard as a
specialist in late romantic
music.
The first work, "Valses No
bles et Sentimentales" by Ravel
bears little semblance to any
kind of waltz but is nonethe
less one of Ravel's most beauti
ful piano compositions. Al
though actually comprised of
seven waltzes, the entire series
appears as one work. Principle
themes are re-echoed
throughout, tying the pieces
together. Collard interpreted
this work with a great deal of
ingenuity and authority.
The "Etudes Sym
phoniques" by Schumann
were composed in 1834, and
appear as a series of variations
much like the Chopin Pre
ludes. The set displays sharp
contrasts in moods revealing
Schumann's languid and
melodic side (Eusebius) as well
as his more schizoid, virtuosic
nature (Florestan). Although
the piece was interesting, it left
me less moved than the other
works on the program.
"L'lsle Joyeuse" by Debussy
was lovely. Although pur
ported to be one of his more
extroverted works, it at times
still displays the reserved, in
trospective nature of the com
poser. Debussy paints a pic
ture of an island paradise
which abounds with gaiety,
music and dance. All of a sud
den, clouds begin to gather
and the storm begins. The
ocean rises and swells, waves
batter the coast and all the na
tives run for cover. Then as
quickly as it came, the storm

subsides and the festivities re
sume. The work is truly drama
tic and requires interpretive as
well as technical brilliance.
The highlight of the evening
however, was the
Rachmaninoff "Sonata in B flat
Minor," opus 36. Originally
composed in 1913 and sub
sequently revised in 1931, the
sonata is one of the most dif
ficult and dramatic works
Rachmaninoff ever wrote.
The first movement is bold
and daring in its themes while
the second is more languid and

romantic. The melodies seem
to be structured on the
c hromatic scale rather than the
diatonic. The third movement
is one of the most dazzling dis
plays of piano virtuosity ever
composed. Runs, octaves and
impossible chords tear across
the keyboard furiously ending
in a thundering assertion of B
flat Major. So enormous are
the physical demands on the
pianist that when Collard rose
to receive the audience's wild
ovations, he nearly collapsed
over the piano.
