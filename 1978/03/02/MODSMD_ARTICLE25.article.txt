This article which I have
decided to call "Once
Around the Arts" is an ad
dition we are making to
the entertainment section.
It is devoted primarily to
local events that may be of
interest to you.
Whether you know it or
not there is some pretty
good entertainment going
on right underneath your
noses and you may be mis
sing a lot of it. What I will
attempt to do is make
some recommendations
about what is worth seeing
(and what is not worth se
eing) and point out some
new or unusual happen
ings. I won't try to mention
everything because there
is simply not enough
space. The opinions I will
be giving will be strictly
personal ones.
Fun facts
This article is also going
to be a way for me to
communicate with you out
there. For instance, here
are two fun facts:
—Anyone can come to
the Daily and leave a note
for the Bay Area Events
editor to put something in
our weekly events calen
dar that you will find on
page five of this issue.
We can't keep track of ev
erything that is going on
here, so your help is
needed. We want to have

as full a listing as possible.
We reserve the right to de
cide what goes in Bay Area
Events, but we give prior
ity to local events.
—Once Around The
Quad is another really
good way to advertise, but
is limited to events which
have noadmission charge.
Both services are free.
Not too much
Now for all this enter
tainment I've been telling
you about. Well, the truth
of the matter is this is an
unusually lean weekend
coming up. The Quadro
Hotteterre from Holland is
coming to Dinkelspiel (see
picture this page) and I am
sure The Lively Arts people
have booked another fine
concert.
At the Sunday Flicks,
Gene Wilder isn't putting
on the best show of his
career in "Silver Streak"
but still offers some diver
sions for the lower levels
of the brain.
It has been rumored that
Stanford's own punk-rock
band, "|ohn Vomit and the
Leather Scabs" are going
to be appearing in Frost
Amphitheater next Wed
nesday at midnight. I can
not vouch for their au
thenticity though, be
cause John failed even to
spit on me when I met
him.
