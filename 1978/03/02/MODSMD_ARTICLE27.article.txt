## Baryshnikov, Kirkland excel 
### 
Like Christmas, the Ameri
can Ballet Theatre comes once
a year. Wrapped in extravagant
press releases, the anticipation
almost overshadowed their ar
rival in San Francisco last week.
Monday night Mikhail
Baryshnikov was injured, but
Thursday he appeared in
"Other Dances" with Gelsey
Kirkland. Kirkland displayed an
earthly passion, that in its ac
cessibility, seemed to lift the
burden of the responsibility
she carries for her enormous
talent. One hand on each
shoulder, Baryshnikov and
Kirkland teased and cajoled
each other to piano music by
Chopin.
Friday's Coppellia is usually

thought of as a playful (albeit
wickedly so) ballet for a pastel
corps knocking their knees in a
moldy, murky workshop be
longing to a Faustian character.
Kirstein thinks it forebodes
political turbulence; the pre
text for a plot that a boy falls in
love with a doll and that all ot
the village kids love nothing so
much as fooling the old scien
tist and kicking books out of
his hand is jarring and usually
ignored.
Cynthia Gregory's "Swan
hilda" was too courtly too
regal to be peasantry. Not a
breeze blows on her upper
body and she moves her
shoulders and neck no more
than a small amount; it could
have been danced at court.
The corps in "Swan Lake,"
Act 11, looked disturbingly like
Twyla Tharp's headless, blood
less dolls in the corps of "Push
Comes to Shove," a joke on a
ballet corps that doesn't
acknowledge what they are do
ing. While their hips rotate to
the bass, their arms move fran
tically in stiff, unnatural pat
terns. It's paradoxical that a
company known for its indi
viduals should have such a
subdued corps and that New
York City Ballet, renowned for
supposed anonymity, should
have the liveliest. Entering in a
series of tiny, gathering steps,
Marianna Tcherkassky dev
outly offered us a suppliant
"Prayer" in the last act.
Again on Saturday night,
Gregory appeared in the Black
Swan "Pas de Deux" and "Jar
din Aux Lilas." Gregory's was a
glamorously sensual rather
than vampishly evil woman
swan. In black trimmed with
gold, she swished through
phrase after phrase, finishing
each with abrupt panache, let
ting its effect be absorbed with
a quick pause.
Her elliptical black eyes, de
licately hooked nose, and

minnaret neck give her the ap
pearance of curious, rather
rarified species of bird, so tall
its head sticks through the
clouds into thin air. When,
after a series of small develop
ments of her leg to the back
travelling upstage, she flicked
Fernando Bujones impudently
under the chin, she realized
the dual nature of bird-woman.
After her fouettes, Bujones
began a series of turns in sec
ond, his round mouth open,
his round eyes widening each
time he faced us. When Greg
ory lightly paused on pointe
with her leg in back, intention
ally upstaging according to the
design of the choreography,
the excitement intensified and
only self-restraint kept some
people from standing up and
clapping.
Bujones is clearly a danseur
noble and his reputation for ar
rogance is not valid. He has a
tendency to raise his shoulders
though, in order to give him
self impetus when running for
a jump and that makes the
take-off perceptible.
Kirkland is such a legend that
it comes as a shock to realize
that she still'performs. Has
there ever been such a raptur
ous Giselle? During intermis
sion, we toasted with cafe
amaretto a la Gelsey because
the whipped cream on top re
minded us of her dancing.
The smallest part of any of
her combinations has been
carefully nurtured to display
the subtle dynamics of light
swiftness alternating with cal
culated pauses whose cumula
tive effect is a staggering illu
sion of etherality. Physically,
she appears inhumanly fragile
— the marshmallow, foam
rubber feet that caress the
floor like hands, those mem
branous arms hovering over
the egg-shaped head drooping
over the tiny breast — but it's

not just her wraithlike appear
ance that created a sensation.
It's the state of utter inebria
tion in which she performs and
which convinces us thatCiselle
really is a girl of delicate health
crazily in love with dancing.
Baryshnikov plays Prince Al
brecht not as a careless young
playboy, but rather as a man in
love with a marvelous sprite.
Class divisions are an accident
to him. He is violently upset
when he sees his Giselle go
mad and tries to calm her; her
other boyfriend just mopes
self-indulgently.
In Act 11, Kirkland enters and
turns so fast on one foot on flat
that we understand that she is
being made to do so by the
Queen of the Wilis. Myrtha,
the Queen, also makes Al
brecht dance, to his death, and
in crossing the floor in a series
of anguished cabrioles on the
diagonal, flings his upper
shoulders and head back
against the impetus of the
jump. His mane of hair thrown
back of his head, his eyes
haunted and feverish, Myrtha
seems to turn away compla
cently, but perhaps she cannot
answer.
If the standing room ticket
holders stood five deep that
night, the crowd that stood in
the aisles by the stage after
Giselle was at least as dense as
the bouquets they threw to
Kirkland and Baryshnikov.



The American Ballet Theatre was in San Francisco last week to put on
three performances before packed houses. Mikhail Barishnikov and
Gelsey Kirkland put in stunning performances that pleased their

audiences emmensely. The company appears in San Francisco only
once each year.
