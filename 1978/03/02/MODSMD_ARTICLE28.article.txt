## 'Kate' vibrant 
### 
It was far from being just
"another opening, another
show." Cedro presented a vib
rant and enthusiastic version of
"Kiss Me, Kate" last weekend.
Written by Samuel and Bella
Spewack, with music by Cole
Porter, "Kiss Me, Kate" is a
musical comedy on two levels.
On one level it examines the
personal interactions of a
troupe of Shakespearean ac
tors. Interwoven with these in
teractions are scenes from
"The Taming of the Shrew,"
the play which the troupe is
currently performing.
Spewack's thespians are very
similar to the characters they
portray in "The Shrew." Lilli
Vanessi, the Shakespearean
actress who portrays Kate, is
quite a shrew herself. Simi
larly, both Lilli's leading man,
Fred Graham, and the charac
ter he portrays, Petruchio, at
tempt throughout the play to
win the love of their shrew
women. In the final scenes,
both men do attain their goals.
The best part of the show
was the energetic and en
thusiastic involvement of the
cast. From the opening
number to the final chorus, the
company sang and danced
with all of their might. They
were obviously having a good
time on stage, and that feeling
quickly spread to the audi
ence.
Ron Marryott did an admira
ble job of directing. His careful
handling of the scene shifts
and continuity prevented any
confusion regarding the dou
ble roles of the actors. In addi
tion, he handled some of the

inevitable low points well; al
though "Kiss Me, Kate" is quite
funny, the humor is a bit un
even.
Ellen Behrens was excellent
as Lilli Vanessi/Kate. She sang a
difficult score with strength
and feeling, and her shrewish
behavior was quite entertain
ing. Behrens' rendition of "I
Hate Men" was particularly
good, sung with utter disgust
for the male of the species.
Don Mar.es was good in his
role as the likeable Fred
Craham/Petruchio. He pro
vided an emotional, yet amus
ing version of "Where is the
Life," a song referring to all of
the women in his life that he'd
left behind.
The two gunmen, played by
Dave Del Beccaro and Eric Mas
ters, completely won the
hearts of the audience. Del
Beccaro and Masters were per
fectly cast in their character
parts; they were gruff, yet
loveable, and stupid, but with a
touch of class. The two shone
in their version of "Brush Up
Your Shakespeare" and com
manded loud applause for
their efforts.
This review would not be
complete without mentioning
the show's superb choreog
raphy. Movements were well
planned and unusual, and two
dancers in particular, Eric Rys
trom and Mary Setrakian,
showed exceptional grace and
ability.
Cedro proved that a dorm
can put on a good production,
and have a fantastic time doing
it.

funny, the humor is a bit un
even.
Ellen Behrens was excellent
as Lilli Vanessi/Kate. She sang a
difficult score with strength
and feeling, and her shrewish
behavior was quite entertain
ing. Behrens' rendition of "I
Hate Men" was particularly
good, sung with utter disgust
for the male of the species.
Don Mar.es was good in his
role as the likeable Fred
Craham/Petruchio. He pro
vided an emotional, yet amus
ing version of "Where is the
Life," a song referring to all of
the women in his life that he'd
left behind.
The two gunmen, played by
Dave Del Beccaro and Eric Mas
ters, completely won the
hearts of the audience. Del
Beccaro and Masters were per
fectly cast in their character
parts; they were gruff, yet
loveable, and stupid, but with a
touch of class. The two shone
in their version of "Brush Up
Your Shakespeare" and com
manded loud applause for
their efforts.
This review would not be
complete without mentioning
the show's superb choreog
raphy. Movements were well
planned and unusual, and two
dancers in particular, Eric Rys
trom and Mary Setrakian,
showed exceptional grace and
ability.
Cedro proved that a dorm
can put on a good production,
and have a fantastic time doing
it.
It was far from being just
"another opening, another
show." Cedro presented a vib
rant and enthusiastic version of
"Kiss Me, Kate" last weekend.
Written by Samuel and Bella
Spewack, with music by Cole
Porter, "Kiss Me, Kate" is a
musical comedy on two levels.
On one level it examines the
personal interactions of a
troupe of Shakespearean ac
tors. Interwoven with these in
teractions are scenes from
"The Taming of the Shrew,"
the play which the troupe is
currently performing.
Spewack's thespians are very
similar to the characters they
portray in "The Shrew." Lilli
Vanessi, the Shakespearean
actress who portrays Kate, is
quite a shrew herself. Simi
larly, both Lilli's leading man,
Fred Graham, and the charac
ter he portrays, Petruchio, at
tempt throughout the play to
win the love of their shrew
women. In the final scenes,
both men do attain their goals.
The best part of the show
was the energetic and en
thusiastic involvement of the
cast. From the opening
number to the final chorus, the
company sang and danced
with all of their might. They
were obviously having a good
time on stage, and that feeling
quickly spread to the audi
ence.
Ron Marryott did an admira
ble job of directing. His careful
handling of the scene shifts
and continuity prevented any
confusion regarding the dou
ble roles of the actors. In addi
tion, he handled some of the

inevitable low points well; al
though "Kiss Me, Kate" is quite
funny, the humor is a bit un
even.
