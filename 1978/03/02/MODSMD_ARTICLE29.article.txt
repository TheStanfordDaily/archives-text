UMW leaders urge ratification
Miners streamed by the hundreds into meetings
throughout the nation's coal country yesterday to hear
— and sometimes denounce — the details of a contract
that could end their 86-day strike.
Over television and radio, United Mine Workers pres
ident Arnold Miller and other leaders urged ratification
when members vote this weekend.
District leaders took to podiums in union halls arid
civic auditoriumsto brief local leaders and rank-and-file
members in such states as West Virginia, Ohio, Illinois,
Indiana, and Colorado.
But the contract was meeting resistance in some areas
— with certain regional and local leaders among the
most vocal opponents.
Russia warned against intrusion
Washington — The administration stiffened its stand
on a new nuclear arms treaty yesterday, warning the
Russians against interference in Africa and ruling out
major American concessions in the ongoing negotia
tions.
The warning carrie from Zbigniew Brzezinski, the U.S.
national security adviser, who said, "unwarranted intru
sion" into conflict between Ethiopia and Somalia would
complicate efforts to work out a new U.S.-Soviet arms
treaty and to get it ratified by the Senate.
He also told reporters at a White House breakfast that
the United States had nearly reached its limit in making
concessions on intercontinental ballistic missiles, long
range bombers and the low-flying American cruise mis
sile.

Storm lashes southern California
Los Angeles — Two more rainstorms were expected to
drench southern California by the end of the week,
weather forecasters said yesterday after heavy rains sent
mud smashing into houses and ripped down power
lines.
"If you have a rowboat, you might keep it handy,"
National Weather Service meteorologist Betty Rio said,
half jokingly.
She said satellite maps showed a system of storm
funnels stretching from the West Coast to Hawaii, with
the first storm expected to begin stirring up trouble late
yesterday night. Close behind was a second storm that
should soak southern California beginning late today.
Panama Canal amendments fail
Washington — The Senate rejected two more moves
by opponents to amend the Panama Canal treaties yes
terday as the balance of strength continued to tip in
favor of the pacts.
With the debate bogging down in repetitive argu
ments and opponents pouring more proposed amend
ments across the clerk's desk, Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) said there was a pressing need to
expedite action on the treaties. He was concerned that
frustrated treaty opponents were using delaying tactics.
U.S. currency plunges in Europe
New York — The U.S. dollar plunged to record lows
against major world currencies in European foreign
exchange trading yesterday, but improved considerably
— especially in New York — after Switzerland stepped in
to steady the market.
The U.S. dollar, which has been losing ground for
over a year, was worth less than two West German marks
yesterday for the first time in history, and it touched new
lows against the Swiss franc, Belgian franc and Dutch
guilder before rebounding late in the day.
One year ago, the dollar was worth four marks in
Europe, and last July it would buy 2.30 marks.

response to a question from reporters. He hesitated and
shrugged before replying. But Secretary of Labor Ray
Marshall, also asked about chances for ratification, said,
"It's looking favorable."
Carter signed the black lung law during a ceremony in
the State Dining Room at the White House.

the larvis property tax initiative off the June ballot.

UMW leaders urge ratification

— and sometimes denounce — the details of a contract
that could end their 86-day strike.
Over television and radio, United Mine Workers pres

Russia warned against intrusion
Washington — The administration stiffened its stand
on a new nuclear arms treaty yesterday, warning the
Russians against interference in Africa and ruling out
major American concessions in the ongoing negotia

The warning carrie from Zbigniew Brzezinski, the U.S.
national security adviser, who said, "unwarranted intru
sion" into conflict between Ethiopia and Somalia would
complicate efforts to work out a new U.S.-Soviet arms

He also told reporters at a White House breakfast that
the United States had nearly reached its limit in making
concessions on intercontinental ballistic missiles, long
range bombers and the low-flying American cruise mis
sile.

Storm lashes southern California
Los Angeles — Two more rainstorms were expected to
drench southern California by the end of the week,
weather forecasters said yesterday after heavy rains sent
mud smashing into houses and ripped down power
lines.
"If you have a rowboat, you might keep it handy,"
National Weather Service meteorologist Betty Rio said,
half jokingly.
She said satellite maps showed a system of storm
funnels stretching from the West Coast to Hawaii, with
the first storm expected to begin stirring up trouble late
yesterday night. Close behind was a second storm that
should soak southern California beginning late today.

frustrated treaty opponents were using delaying tactics.
U.S. currency plunges in Europe

over a year, was worth less than two West German marks
yesterday for the first time in history, and it touched new

U.S. currency plunges in Europe

against major world currencies in European foreign
exchange trading yesterday, but improved considerably
— especially in New York — after Switzerland stepped in
to steady the market.

over a year, was worth less than two West German marks
yesterday for the first time in history, and it touched new
lows against the Swiss franc, Belgian franc and Dutch
guilder before rebounding late in the day.

Europe, and last July it would buy 2.30 marks.
