# Two killed as DC-10 crashes on takeoff

### 
Los Angeles (AP) — A Honolulu
bound Continental Airlines DC-10
jetliner blew two tires on takeoff in a
driving rainstorm yesterday at Los
Angeles International Airport, spun
off the runway and burst into flames,
killing two passengers and injuring
73 others.
The two who died were among 184
passengers and 14 crew members
aboard the aircraft. Four survivors
were reported in critical condition —
one woman with burns over 80 per
cent of her body.
Early reports said the deaths re
sulted from a malfunctioning escape
chute. But later, observers of the
tragedy said the chute ejected prop
erly only to be engulfed in flames
that erupted below.
Passengers sliding down that
chute were dumped headlong into a
sea of flame.
Some victims were seen trying to
flee across the aircraft's burning left
wing. Flames leapt through the open
escape hatch into the cabin.
It was the first fatal commercial air

line accident on the grounds of the
airport in its 50-year history.
Passengers aboard the plane —
flight 603 to Honolulu — told of hear
ing a "big bump" as it approached
takeoff at 9:23 a.m.
Two landing wheel tires blew out
and a landing gear collapsed, Conti
nental spokesman Robert Sterling
said. It didn't appear that the
rainstorm had anything to do with
the crash, Sterling said.
In fact, he added, the rainslick
runway would have lessened friction
on the tires and most likely the moist
ground kept dragging metal surfaces
cooler when the craft spun around.
The pilot, Capt. Gene Hersche,
immediately reversed the engines
and veered to the left and the plane
tipped to its side and caught fire.
Witnesses* credited Hersche's
quick action with averting a larger
holocaust had the burning aircraft hit
structures in its path.
The pilot stopped the jumbo jet
just 20 feet from a light standard
which could have added to the de
struction if it had been hit.
Later yesterday in Honolulu,
another Continental DC-10 aborted
its takeoff after several tires blew out
as it taxied for a takeoff to Seattle.
There were no injuries, airport offi
cials said, passengers were bused
back to the terminal, and the jet was
towed from the runway.
Continental said the pilot of the
plane in Los Angeles, Capt. Gene
Hersche, was on his last flight before
retirement. His 60th birthday is Fri
day. Hersche said it was his first acci
dent in 37 years of flying.

sea of flame.
Some victims were seen trying to
flee across the aircraft's burning left
wing. Flames leapt through the open
escape hatch into the cabin.
It was the first fatal commercial air

line accident on the grounds of the
airport in its 50-year history.
Passengers aboard the plane —
flight 603 to Honolulu — told of hear
ing a "big bump" as it approached
takeoff at 9:23 a.m.
Two landing wheel tires blew out
and a landing gear collapsed, Conti
nental spokesman Robert Sterling
said. It didn't appear that the
rainstorm had anything to do with
the crash, Sterling said.
In fact, he added, the rainslick
runway would have lessened friction
on the tires and most likely the moist
ground kept dragging metal surfaces
cooler when the craft spun around.
The pilot, Capt. Gene Hersche,
immediately reversed the engines
and veered to the left and the plane
tipped to its side and caught fire.
Witnesses* credited Hersche's
quick action with averting a larger
holocaust had the burning aircraft hit
structures in its path.
The pilot stopped the jumbo jet
just 20 feet from a light standard
which could have added to the de
struction if it had been hit.
Later yesterday in Honolulu,
another Continental DC-10 aborted
its takeoff after several tires blew out
as it taxied for a takeoff to Seattle.
There were no injuries, airport offi
cials said, passengers were bused
back to the terminal, and the jet was
towed from the runway.
Continental said the pilot of the
plane in Los Angeles, Capt. Gene
Hersche, was on his last flight before
retirement. His 60th birthday is Fri
day. Hersche said it was his first acci
dent in 37 years of flying.
