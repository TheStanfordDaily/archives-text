'That's Entertainment?'
"That's Entertainment?" this year's
Florence Moore smash-hit spring
show begins its three-night run this
evening at 7:30 in the Alondra
Lounge. Admission is free, and as is
the case with all Flo Mo productions,
the show is not to be confused with
the original production under a simi
lar name.
Back to normal
With area rainfall nearly back to
normal, drought restrictions here
have been relaxed. Campus foun
tains will flow during daylight hours,
University vehicles may be washed
and groundskeepers may return to a
full watering schedule.
