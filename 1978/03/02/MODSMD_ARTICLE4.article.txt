# Androgyny doesn't say it all
## Theme house renamed after feminist 
### Jill Liscom 
After dropping the name An
drogyny House four months ago, re
sidents of 620 Mayfield decided
Thursday to rename the house after
Simone de Beauvior, a 20th-century
feminist author.
Although several house members
said they already considered Simone
de Beauvoir the official name, house
press collective member Elizabeth
Creenberg said, "We're kind of get
ting used to the name and making
sure we like it. It will probably be
formalized at the next meeting."
Row Director Karen Harrison said
she is "waiting to hear from the
house if they've definitely decided
on that name" before the University
Housing Office becomes involved.
Question mark
The name Androgyny was dropped

in October and a question mark
painted over thedoor because house
members said they felt the term was
ambiguous and did not clearly reflect
the theme of the house, according to
press collective members.
Several weeks ago, the house
chose to name the house after Mary
Wollstonecraft, an 18th-century
feminist writer.
However, "it became evident dur
ing the week that nobody liked using
that name, so it was dropped the next
week," explained Leslie Bixel, press
collective member.
According to other press collective
members, "the circumstances of the
meeting were that by the time a con
sensus was reached it was 2 or 3 a.m.
and everybody just wanted to get the
meeting over with."
At the house meeting last Thurs

day, which lasted about four hours,
"there were several names people
said they'd be satisfied with, and we
just found the name that everybody
liked the best," said resident Robin
Severns.
'More familiar'
"More people are familiar with the
name Simone de Beauvoir than
Wollstonecraft," commented house
associate (RA) Dee Bucciarelli. "Also,
we saw a lot of concerns of de
Beauvoir's as being more relevant to
contemporary feminism.
"In her book, The Second Sex,
Simone de Beauvoir didn't consider
herself a feminist. She was much
more concerned with individual sol
utions to problems. Now she is very
radical in her feminism and says she's
learned a lot from it. She's realizing
that to counter women's oppression,
you can't do it on an individual basis,
you need a group effort," explained
Bucciarelli.
One press collective member said
there were two aspects of the origi
nal theme house proposal: examina
tion of sex roles in society and
feminism. De Beauvoir addresses
both of these aspects because she
dealt with sex role exploration be
fore she became a feminist, he said.
'Historical struggle'
Todd Tieger, one of three resident
coordinators, said he considers
feminism the house's main theme
because he sees "feminism as com
prising all of the ideals of androgyny
but it also has the substance of the
historical struggle of existing in
equalities.
"Feminism is a political belief sys
tem involving how to deal with exist
ing inequalities, while androgyny is a
futurist ideal that doesn't necessarily
deal with realities. Androgyny is
often only concerned with creating
well-rounded men," Tieger

explained.
Harrison said that the University's
process for approving the new name
is "not that clear-cut," but added
"we would be a little cautious about
naming a house after an individual
when the individual did not contri-
