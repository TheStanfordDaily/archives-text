# Frat council looks at rush, Zete sanctions
## 
### Robin Millington 
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
met yesterday to discuss the ac
tivities of the IFC's Arbitration
Board, which is reviewing allega
tions of questionable initiation ac
tivities at Zeta Psi house.
The council also discussed plans
for the fraternities' Spring Rush.
IFC President Reid Butler said that
in the Zete case "the facts are pretty
clear-cut." He said the arbitration
board is dealing with the Zetes as a
group because the alleged question
able activities were house
sponsored.
According to Butler, the debate is
not over the identity of those re
sponsible for the actions, allegedly
including taking a wheelchair from
Cowell Student Health Center and
"streaking" in Meyer Library.
Sanctions
Instead, the issue is what sanctions
the board retains, he said.
Butler said the students' alleged
actions merit a strong response, but
said forcing them off campus would
be far too strong a reaction.
He also said Residential Education
Director Norman Robinson has ex
tended his deadline for a board deci
sion on the Zete matter and that the

ruling will likely be made in two
weeks.
Potential rush activities include an
aqua-follies party on April 8. Butler
said the frats' rush chairmen are in
terested in starting the rush with a
big event.
Beer party
The aqua-follies would include
canoe races, jousting matches and
tugs-of-war. During the evening, the
IFC is considering sponsoring a beer
party with a live band in Canfield
Court between Meyer and the Law
School.
But he said more money would be
needed from IFC members to sup
port the aqua-follies and party. "We
need more money from the houses
to do rush right."
Butler proposed assessing each
house anywhere from $30 to $140,
but the council postponed making a
decision until their meeting next
Tuesday at the Zete House to allow
each house to poll its members on
the assessment.
Pre-rush activities have included
invitations from several fraternities
to freshmen dorm residents, both
men and women, to participate with
them in social activities.
