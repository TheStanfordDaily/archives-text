# Lawyers overcome professional drudgery with LEXIS
## 
### Andrea James 
For the last several years, computers have been
assisting mankind with the drudgery of profes
sions. Mathematicians and physicists can calculate
intricate problems in a fraction of the time it took
before Texas Instruments came on the scene.
Now, lawyers, and students at Stanford Law
School, can look up cases and legal articles in a
fraction of the time it took before LEXIS.
Meaning "light" in Latin, LEXIS is a legal infor
mation retrieval system, a product of Mead Data
Central. This corporation's operating headquar
ters in Dayton, Ohio, serve as the main terminal
for hundreds of the computer's outlets through
out the country.
Joseph Leininger, associate dean of the Law
School, estimated that 35 to 40 law schools in the
United States and hundreds of law firms, courts
and governmental agencies use LEXIS.
Training programs
Leininger, who was instrumental in obtaining
the computer for the University and who initiated
LEXIS training programs for Stanford law students,
said that since its installation in January 1977,
about half the law students have acquired suffi
cient knowledge to use the computer.
Only about six faculty members use it, Leininger
said. "Most of the faculty is already used to manual
research, while most of the students had previous
experience with computers," he explained.
First-come, first-serve
The one LEXIS terminal in the law school library
is operated on a first-come, first-serve basis during
the law library hours. Students do not pay addi
tional fees for computer privileges. Computer
training is voluntary.
"We offer a five-hour course on the use of
LEXIS," Leininger said. "It includes a videotape
description of the computer, reading materials
and a computer simulation. Training groups usu
ally include about four or five students."
LEXIS contains 18 libraries. The general federal
library includes Supreme Court decisions begin
ning in 1938. Thirteen states are included in the

individual state court decisions.
Increasing libraries
"They're increasing the libraries all the time,"
said Myron Jacobstein, law librarian.
They have to. As the Mead Corporation explains
in its LEXIS pamphlet, 500,000 court decisions had
been handed down by 1890. This figure had
jumped to about 2.5 million by 1969.
"Even the increase is increasing," the pamphlet
said.
The Law School's contract with Mead provides
that the computer can be used for educational
purposes only. Therefore, the computer is open
only to law school students and University per
sonnel.
EDUCOM
Because of Stanford's affiliation with EDUCOM,
an inter-university organization in the East, Stan
ford can rent LEXIS for $660 a month, Leininger
said.
"This pays for everything, including paper," he
added.
He estimated that law firms paid a considerable
amount more than does the University. He said he
thought the law firms probably paid a flat annual
fee, which he estimated averaged out to $60 to
$100 every hour they use the computer.
Mead Corporation explains that in order to find
cases involving a specific topic, "the researcher
must conceive of combinations of words, phrases,
or numbers which are likely to occur in, and
thereby result in the retrieval of, cases which are
potentially useful to him."
'Marvelous tool'
"For the most part, it's a marvelous tool," said
Leininger. He added, however, that sometimes it
is difficult for the user to find the key words
needed to get the right cases.
In general, LEXIS seems to illustrate further
Leibniz' 1971 statement: "It is unworthy of excel
lent men to lose hours like slaves in the labor of
calculation which could safely be relegated to
anyone else if machines were used."

United States and hundreds of law firms, courts
and governmental agencies use LEXIS.
Training programs
Leininger, who was instrumental in obtaining
the computer for the University and who initiated
LEXIS training programs for Stanford law students,
said that since its installation in January 1977,
about half the law students have acquired suffi
cient knowledge to use the computer.
Only about six faculty members use it, Leininger
said. "Most of the faculty is already used to manual
research, while most of the students had previous
experience with computers," he explained.
First-come, first-serve
The one LEXIS terminal in the law school library
is operated on a first-come, first-serve basis during
the law library hours. Students do not pay addi
tional fees for computer privileges. Computer
training is voluntary.
"We offer a five-hour course on the use of
LEXIS," Leininger said. "It includes a videotape
description of the computer, reading materials
and a computer simulation. Training groups usu
ally include about four or five students."
LEXIS contains 18 libraries. The general federal
library includes Supreme Court decisions begin
ning in 1938. Thirteen states are included in the

individual state court decisions.
Increasing libraries
"They're increasing the libraries all the time,"
said Myron Jacobstein, law librarian.
They have to. As the Mead Corporation explains
in its LEXIS pamphlet, 500,000 court decisions had
been handed down by 1890. This figure had
jumped to about 2.5 million by 1969.
"Even the increase is increasing," the pamphlet
said.
The Law School's contract with Mead provides
that the computer can be used for educational
purposes only. Therefore, the computer is open
only to law school students and University per
sonnel.
EDUCOM
Because of Stanford's affiliation with EDUCOM,
an inter-university organization in the East, Stan
ford can rent LEXIS for $660 a month, Leininger
said.
"This pays for everything, including paper," he
added.
He estimated that law firms paid a considerable
amount more than does the University. He said he
thought the law firms probably paid a flat annual
fee, which he estimated averaged out to $60 to
$100 every hour they use the computer.
Mead Corporation explains that in order to find
cases involving a specific topic, "the researcher
must conceive of combinations of words, phrases,
or numbers which are likely to occur in, and
thereby result in the retrieval of, cases which are
potentially useful to him."
'Marvelous tool'
"For the most part, it's a marvelous tool," said
Leininger. He added, however, that sometimes it
is difficult for the user to find the key words
needed to get the right cases.
In general, LEXIS seems to illustrate further
Leibniz' 1971 statement: "It is unworthy of excel
lent men to lose hours like slaves in the labor of
calculation which could safely be relegated to
anyone else if machines were used."

LEXIS, a legal information retrieval system based in Dayton,
Ohio.
For the last several years, computers have been
assisting mankind with the drudgery of profes
sions. Mathematicians and physicists can calculate
intricate problems in a fraction of the time it took
before Texas Instruments came on the scene.
Now, lawyers, and students at Stanford Law
School, can look up cases and legal articles in a
fraction of the time it took before LEXIS.
Meaning "light" in Latin, LEXIS is a legal infor
mation retrieval system, a product of Mead Data
Central. This corporation's operating headquar
ters in Dayton, Ohio, serve as the main terminal
for hundreds of the computer's outlets through
out the country.
Joseph Leininger, associate dean of the Law
School, estimated that 35 to 40 law schools in the
United States and hundreds of law firms, courts
and governmental agencies use LEXIS.
