# Editorial
## Task Force offers best plan 
### 
Western Culture
When a proposal to reinstate the Western
Culture requirement surfaced last year, we
editorialized against a return of that require
ment.
We reiterate that opposition.
We aren't denying the importance of study
ing Western Culture, but we believe that cur
rent courses and current requirements allow
for that. We don't think that burdening stu
dents with any more requirements than they
now have will bring about any therapeutic or
educational benefits.
Since it does appear, however, that the
Faculty Senate is bent on imposing some sort of
requirement, we have to decide which prop
osal would be the best one in accomplishing
the goals of such a requirements. Thus, we
concur with the Western Culture Task Force's
proposal that a single course be used to satisfy
the requirement.
This proposal includes such features as stu
dents studying the same works in primarily
seminar-style classes, a wise mix of lectures
and discussion, and the use of regular and
emeriti professors along with postdoctoral in
structors.
However, we do disagree with one of the
Task Force's proposals. The Task Force be
lieves the suggested model should undergo a
two-year pilot program with volunteer stu
dents before becoming a requirement for all
undergraduates.
Though the Task Force is at least candid
enough to admit that a program using volun
teers can not test the impact of a requirement
itself, we think that the program should sim

ply begin without a test run and should apply to
all members of the class which is selected to
be the first to be subject to the requirement.
The effects and problems of the requirement
and the model which fulfills it will be most
clearly manifested in this way. We believe it
ironic that should the two-year test program
begin this fall, the class of 1984 could be the
first class required to take a Western Culture
program.
We note that the Faculty Senate may not
receive its final recommendation in this mat
ter until the end of spring quarter. Should this
happen, we urge the Faculty Senate not to
take any final action on this requirement until
fall quarter.
We hope that those concerned with this
requirement, and the several proposals
suggested to satisfy it, will let their views be
known to the Western Culture Task Force, the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies, and
the Faculty Senate. People should remember
that the reinstatement of the Western Culture
requirement may well foretell whether a
foreign language requirement will also be
reinstated.
Lastly, some have attacked the Task Force's
proposed model arguing that it is too expen
sive and the University can not afford it. We
simply point outthat next year students will be
paying more than $5000 in tuition, and by the
time a proposed model becomes a require
ment, tuition may exceed $7000. For that sort
of tuition, students are entitled to the best
type of education in Western Culture, espe
cially if such an education is as important as its
proponents claim.

proposal that a single course be used to satisfy
the requirement.
This proposal includes such features as stu
dents studying the same works in primarily
seminar-style classes, a wise mix of lectures
and discussion, and the use of regular and
emeriti professors along with postdoctoral in
structors.
However, we do disagree with one of the
Task Force's proposals. The Task Force be
lieves the suggested model should undergo a
two-year pilot program with volunteer stu
dents before becoming a requirement for all
undergraduates.
Though the Task Force is at least candid
enough to admit that a program using volun
teers can not test the impact of a requirement
itself, we think that the program should sim

ply begin without a test run and should apply to
all members of the class which is selected to
be the first to be subject to the requirement.
The effects and problems of the requirement
and the model which fulfills it will be most
clearly manifested in this way. We believe it
ironic that should the two-year test program
begin this fall, the class of 1984 could be the
first class required to take a Western Culture
program.
We note that the Faculty Senate may not
receive its final recommendation in this mat
ter until the end of spring quarter. Should this
happen, we urge the Faculty Senate not to
take any final action on this requirement until
fall quarter.
We hope that those concerned with this
requirement, and the several proposals
suggested to satisfy it, will let their views be
known to the Western Culture Task Force, the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies, and
the Faculty Senate. People should remember
that the reinstatement of the Western Culture
requirement may well foretell whether a
foreign language requirement will also be
reinstated.
Lastly, some have attacked the Task Force's
proposed model arguing that it is too expen
sive and the University can not afford it. We
simply point outthat next year students will be
paying more than $5000 in tuition, and by the
time a proposed model becomes a require
ment, tuition may exceed $7000. For that sort
of tuition, students are entitled to the best
type of education in Western Culture, espe
cially if such an education is as important as its
proponents claim.
