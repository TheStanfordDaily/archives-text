Not right or left
Dear me, after all these years it
seems that there are still apparently
well meaning people like Ellen Byrne
who are determined to lump liberta
rians with "activists on the right."
Oh, we're capitalists all right,
much more consistently so than
most conservatives, for we advocate
the total separation of economics
and the state instead of the current
unholy alliance that exists between
big business and big government
under our current system of corpo
rate statism.
But how many "right-wingers"
have you heard recently that are cal
ling for the abolition of the CIA and
FBI, the total repeal of all victimless
crime laws including those restrict
ing the use and sale of hard drugs,
and a totally non-interventionist
foreign policy?
We were very happy to find ourse
lves numbered among the campus
activists by Byrne. But really, you did
hurt our feelings by lumping us with
the right that way. The simple fact is
â€” libertarians are neither right nor

left. We are both. We are radical in
dividualists and consistently defend
the rights of individuals to control
their own lives, both their economic
life and their personal life.

Personal interest involved
Why should men care about wo
men's self-defense? Because men's
lives are inextricably bound up with
women's lives. Men have mothers,
grandmothers, aunts, sisters,
cousins, wives, friends and
girlfriends. The events in the lives of
the women in a man's life will surely
affect his life.
If there is grief or joy in women's
lives, this will eventually become
part of a man's life also. A woman
who has been victimized or sexually
humiliated has had a very traumatic
experience which will sooner or later
traumatize the men in her life.
The statistical rate of break-up be
tween male-female relationships
after a rape is 90 per cent. This means
marriages, engagements, dating and

living situations are destroyed after
the woman has been attacked. If a
woman can defend herself against
this type of violence and violation
these relationships need not suffer
so drastically.
Men owe it to themselves to make
certain that the women in their lives
are protected against such attacks
and can defend themselves if need
be. It is sometimes hard for men to
understand the shock and pain
which women suffer from being at
tacked. It is not hard at all for men to
imagine their own feelings of pain
when good and loving relationships
are suddenly destroyed and termi
nated, perhaps even without expla
nation.
It is for this very reason that men
should encourage women to learn
how to defend themselves'. Men
have a great deal to lose if women
suffer from helplessness in the face
of violence, and they have nothing at
all to gain.
