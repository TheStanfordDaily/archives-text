# Is higher level education worth it?'
## Personal justification is missing element

Michael Jennings' farewell to Stan
ford address was deeply moving for
me. Itisraretofindcourageousemo
tion eloquently gracing the pages of
the creative vacuum we all call "the
Daily."
The observations and feelings
which lennings alone chose to write
down are true for many of us here.
My conversationswith some of those
people during the past two weeks
have reaffirmed my belief that anv
institution which houses even a few
truly enlightened individuals must
have positive energy somewhere, al
though it may be obscured by a veil
of hypocrisy or, even worse, by the
characteristic 1970s craving for the
ordinary. But today I was jolted (or

maybe just nudged) back to the
realities of college life.
What's cool?
Today I read on this page a crudely
prepared sort of point-counterpoint
opinions piece with )osh Censer and
Phil Lane slugging it out over what's
cool and what ain't cool about Stan
ford (Daily, Feb. 27). I think it's good
that both of these people have
examined the role of their education
in their lives; I have been doing the
same thing ever since my arrival in
California. But I get a sense that
neither of them is really satisfied with
what they are doing here.
For those of us who can afford it,
college is often just an elaborate way
to postpone entry into "adult" soci

ety. After a few years of marking
time, a graduate emerges like an
overdue fetus. Of course, the les
sons learned in the University are not
useless, they are just as valuable as
the lessons of the womb.
The point I am trying to make is
that each of us must analyze his or
her own approach toward life and
eventually be able to justify our con
duct to the satisfaction of the highest
authority, ourselves. Jennings could
no longer justify his presence here,
so he left and became stronger be
cause he was true to himself.
Lane suggests that extracurricular
involvement is the solution to Stan
ford's problems. If it : ll simulate
self-examination, then I agree with

him. But recreational participation in
non-academic activities cannot by it
self transform an inhibited student
into a free-thinking student.
Planet problem solving
As for Genser, he says he wants to
help solve the problems of our
planet and agrees that we are "hov
ering on the brink of Armageddon."
But his curious solution is to work
within the same institutions which he
admits are responsible for leading us
to this precarious perch and says he
"will live the normal affluent life of
the American middle class."
How can you solve a problem
when you are also helping to create
it? If you really do recognize the
problems this planet is facing then
surely you must realize that the
whole idea of an affluent, materialis
tic American middle class is largely
responsible for the hunger and death
and environmental destruction now
threatening the global livelihood.
The "normal everyday functions of
society" which you claim must con
tinue are the major source of our de
teriorating cultural and biological
environments If you really think you
want to work for positive change
from within that system you are so
proud of, then I wish you luck; I only
hopeyou don't get swallowed up like
so many others before you.
Unwilling and unable
I guess my big complaint is that
many in the present generation of
University students are either unwil
ling or unable to justify their pur
poses in seeking higher education.
For those people, I would like to
offer some wisdom which my sister
has shared with me, if shewill forgive
my plagiarism. Vou see, being an
American college student is like
cleaning sewers in Tibet; everytime
you take a test, that is one more piece
of shit you discipline yourself to re
move from the street so others don't
have to look at it. School is truly,
TRULY bullshit, but it is also a valu
able tool if you acquire it with love.

Michael Jennings' farewell to Stan
ford address was deeply moving for
me. Itisraretofindcourageousemo
tion eloquently gracing the pages of
the creative vacuum we all call "the
Daily."
The observations and feelings
which lennings alone chose to write
down are true for many of us here.
My conversationswith some of those
people during the past two weeks
have reaffirmed my belief that anv
institution which houses even a few
truly enlightened individuals must
have positive energy somewhere, al
though it may be obscured by a veil
of hypocrisy or, even worse, by the
characteristic 1970s craving for the
ordinary. But today I was jolted (or

maybe just nudged) back to the
realities of college life.
What's cool?
Today I read on this page a crudely
prepared sort of point-counterpoint
opinions piece with )osh Censer and
Phil Lane slugging it out over what's
cool and what ain't cool about Stan
ford (Daily, Feb. 27). I think it's good
that both of these people have
examined the role of their education
in their lives; I have been doing the
same thing ever since my arrival in
California. But I get a sense that
neither of them is really satisfied with
what they are doing here.
For those of us who can afford it,
college is often just an elaborate way
to postpone entry into "adult" soci

ety. After a few years of marking
time, a graduate emerges like an
overdue fetus. Of course, the les
sons learned in the University are not
useless, they are just as valuable as
the lessons of the womb.
The point I am trying to make is
that each of us must analyze his or
her own approach toward life and
eventually be able to justify our con
duct to the satisfaction of the highest
authority, ourselves. Jennings could
no longer justify his presence here,
so he left and became stronger be
cause he was true to himself.
Lane suggests that extracurricular
involvement is the solution to Stan
ford's problems. If it : ll simulate
self-examination, then I agree with

him. But recreational participation in
non-academic activities cannot by it
self transform an inhibited student
into a free-thinking student.
Planet problem solving
As for Genser, he says he wants to
help solve the problems of our
planet and agrees that we are "hov
ering on the brink of Armageddon."
But his curious solution is to work
within the same institutions which he
admits are responsible for leading us
to this precarious perch and says he
"will live the normal affluent life of
the American middle class."
How can you solve a problem
when you are also helping to create
it? If you really do recognize the
problems this planet is facing then
surely you must realize that the
whole idea of an affluent, materialis
tic American middle class is largely
responsible for the hunger and death
and environmental destruction now
threatening the global livelihood.
The "normal everyday functions of
society" which you claim must con
tinue are the major source of our de
teriorating cultural and biological
environments If you really think you
want to work for positive change
from within that system you are so
proud of, then I wish you luck; I only
hopeyou don't get swallowed up like
so many others before you.
Unwilling and unable
I guess my big complaint is that
many in the present generation of
University students are either unwil
ling or unable to justify their pur
poses in seeking higher education.
For those people, I would like to
offer some wisdom which my sister
has shared with me, if shewill forgive
my plagiarism. Vou see, being an
American college student is like
cleaning sewers in Tibet; everytime
you take a test, that is one more piece
of shit you discipline yourself to re
move from the street so others don't
have to look at it. School is truly,
TRULY bullshit, but it is also a valu
able tool if you acquire it with love.
