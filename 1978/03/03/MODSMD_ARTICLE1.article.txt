# Sororities plan rush policy
## 
### Ann Lincoln 
Rush activities and policies were
the main topics of discussions at the
Inter-Sorority Council (ISC) meeting
yesterday.
Representatives from five
sororities attended.
ISC members agreed that rush will
begin April 10 and end with bid offers
on April 22.
Rotational parties on Monday will
allow women to visit each sorority
briefly. Open houses are scheduled
for Tuesday and Wednesday of both
weeks. Thursday through Sunday
nights of the first week sororities will
hold invitational parties.
Parties
"The first two parties are an oppor
tunity for the girl to express an in
terest in the sorority," said Sally
Scandalios of Kappa Alpha Theta.
"The invitational party is sort of the
opposite because it gives the sorority
an opportunity to show its interest in
the girl. But if a girl doesn't get an
invitation to that she can still come
back to the open house next week to
show her interest," she added.
Preference parties will be held on
the second Friday.
Each woman will choose the two
sororities she prefers then, accord
ing to Heidi Jacobsen of Kappa Kappa
Gamma.
After attending the parties of the
two sororities she is most interested
in, the rushee will fill out a prefer
ence card ranking her first three
choices, according to ISC spokes
persons.
On Saturday morning preference
cards will be matched to the lists of
the sororities that name their pledge
choices. This bid matching system
was called fair and equal by sorority
representatives at the meeting.
"Bid matching makes sure every
girl has a place to go and that no girl
gets two pledges," )acobsen said.
"It's on their own individual
choice for each girl to pick the house
she'd be happiest with," Cindy
Haden of Kappa Alpha Theta said.
Quotas and totals
Along with the bid matching, the
ISC decided that sororities will
adhere to a system of quotas and to
tals. Quotas pertain only to rush. The
quota of pledges allowed to each
sorority will be derived by dividing
the number of women who attend
the first open houses by the number
of sororities, according to Jacobsen.
The total will be the number of
members each sorority will be al
lowed by the ISC.
If after pledging its quota, the
sorority is over its total, it can not
rush anyone else until the next rush
season unless its membership drops
below the allowed total, the ISC de
cided. Sororities still under their
total after pledging their full quota
can continue open rush until they
meet their total, Jacobsen said.
"The reason for the whole system
is to keep one sorority from getting
very, very strong and the others from
getting weak," Jacobsen added.
"There's no way we can make them
equal but we can help."
The ISC will hold an information
meeting Thursday for anyone in
terested in sororities. The meeting is
not a rush activity, Jacobsen said.
Kappa Kappa Gamma held its
pledging ceremony last night. It is
the third sorority to do so, with Alpha
Phi being the first on January 8.
