Tolerance betrayed
Josh Genser, in his response
(Daily, Feb. 27) to Michael Jenning's
cathartic article on dropping out
(Daily, Feb. 14), rails at Jennings'
"lack of tolerance for humanity and
his overwhelming self
righteousness." Jennings seems to
have chosen for his expansive social
critique a definitive rhetorical style
which does not befit very well the
self-doubt expressed. But he should
be commended for taking so much
time to share his ideas by committing
them to print.
Unfortunately Censer betrays his
own intolerence for humanity by
countering Jennings' article with the
declaration that he is a "confirmed
materialist and hedonist," and that
he "fully intends to scratch (his) way
through Stanford and then a profes
sional school and thereafter to make
a lot of money."
So that we might not unfairly envi
sion Censer hurtling bicycle racks
with briefcase in hand and coattails

flapping in pursuit of an under
graduate degree, he himself assures
us that he has taken the time to be
come aware of the needs of others.
He is categorically not, in his own
words, "blind to the ecological de
struction of our planet, deaf to the
cries of the oppressed and hungry,
or apathetic to the plight of a world
hovering on the brink of Armaged
don."
He goes on to imply that Jennings',
having decided not to register, will
now be unable to "work to halt the
destruction of our natural environ
ment, feed the starving, free the
chained," and "further the cause of
peace ..."
By somehow making it tangible
and creating a new department out
of it, perhaps Woolworth's will find a
way to more effectively than Censer
reduce the idea of social conscious
ness.
