# Feminism: link in a search for identity

Sometime this fall, as I was wan
dering through Flo Mo looking for a
dorm that is actually located in
Lagunita, I was rescued by two wo
men. After I asked them if anyone by
the name of my misplaced friend
lived in their dorm, our conversation
went iomething like this.
"Is she an upperclassman?"
"No, she's a woman," I countered

reflexively.
"This is an all freshman dorm."
"But you live here."
"We're freshmen."
"Women," came my kneejerk
progressive echo. I find it confusing
to talk to women when they refer to
themselves in the masculine.
But what is the real value of this
anecdote? Does it show that Stanford
women need their consciousness
raised? That their consciousness is
non-existent? Or am I a rabid
feminist, insisting on dichotomies,
ready to interpret the least provoca
tive remark as an insult?
I tell this story to remind us all of a
truth we already know about women
here — that we all have different ideas
about what is important, what needs to
be changed, and how women and
men should go about changing it.
Every gathering political
I'd like to use this column to talk
about Stanford women and our diffe
rent world views and activities. There
are many forms of feminism and
women's groups on campus, each
with its own political orientation.
I will insist that every gathering of
women is inherently political, even if
that is not its express purpose. The
actions we take, what we include and
exclude, all are motivated by political
assumptions about the nature of
women, our culture, and the world
we act in.

The purpose of this exploration is
not to divide women from their sis
ters, or to divide men from men.
Rather, it is to trace the implications
of feminist theory in our lives as we
encounter our political, social and
sexual conditioning.
No one definition
There is no one adequate defini
tion of feminism. Feminism is proba
bly, at first, the attitude that women
are equal to men. Feminism is also a
developed body of women's know
ledge and theory, and a type of or
ganized political activity for women's
rights and interests.
Perhaps the most difficult but val
uable contribution of feminism is the
theory's integration of the personal
and the political, of our day-to-day
processes or work and play with
larger social change.
I think that women turn to
feminism todiscoverand re-examine
power in our society. A woman's
identity can be strengthened by her
understanding of how sex roles arti
ficially designated our abilities and
emotional qualities, how sex rolesaf
fect her economically, or, on a larger
scale, how a capitalist society
exploits women.
Conversely, organized political ac
tivity, satisfying jobs, and economic
power can enable women and men
to build a less exploitive, more fulfil
ling society. Depending on one's
political orientation, feminist pro
cess or activity can be taken near or

far.
There are two common complaints
about feminism that I would like to
deal with. The first is that organized
women insist on dragging politics
and sex into what is really a "social"
question.
Feminism, or power for women to
control their lives, is a central social
question. However, politics and sex
are the two placed where power is
centralized in our society. For
women to regain and control power,
it is necessary to look into political
and sexual games.
The second complaint about
feminism deals .With separatism in
the women's movement, although it
is also directed at minority groups.
A period of separatism is often
necessary for women to develop
their identity and to find their anger.
When we are oppressed by our con
ditioning and the patterns we are
forced to interact in, the only way to
end that oppression is to separate
ourselves. Being oppressed means
being robbed of certainties of iden
tity and power, and we cannot always
find our resources until the direct
connection with oppression is se
vered.
Defining process
Separatism is also a chance for
women to look into the process of
interaction and create a new and bet
ter process of trust and intimacy,
with less competition and more con
structive criticism. The feminist pro
cess is a direct refutation of the idea
that the equality of women means
that women will simply take on
men's roles in society.
Feminism is not the women's
movement "out there." It may be
dealt with seriously as a politics of
liberation or very quietly as a redefin
ing of personal relationships.
As I knock about campus getting
lost in the wrong dorms, I plan to dig
up how different people are inter
preting feminism in their lives. Fu
ture columns will deal with Half the
Sky, feminist men, women in
terested in sororities — anybody's
who's interested in talking to me. I
don't propose to be all that wise,
(witness my getting lost) but I'll try
and open discusssion.
