# Multi-track scheme unsound
## 
### 
Westly, Grethel

Since we are concerned about the
quality of undergraduate education
at Stanford, we are not only attentive
to the nature of a Western Culture
requirement, but also to how such a
requirement might be instituted. The
model for implementation that
seems to be gaining favor among
University policy formulators is the
multi-track scheme. We believe that
this model is faulty on many counts,
and that it is educationally unsound.
One of the rationales for the West
ern Culture requirement was to pro
vide all students with a like
background in the "major historical
trends" of Western Culture. Yet, the
multi-track scenario indicates that
students will be forced to focus only
on the areas with which their track
deals.
Indeed, it is probable that many
students might finish the require
ment and still not know whether De
scartes was born before the birth of
Jesus of Nazareth. Their familiarity
with these two historical figures will
be dependent upon their track's con
tent. In essence, the multi-track
models are too narrow in scope.
In addition, the multi-track
scheme forces the predominantly
white male Faculty Senate to make a
series of difficult — if not impossible
— value judgements. How many
track alternatives should there be?
Should Philosophy or Religious
Studies be included? Is art more im
portant than music? What about the
West's tradition in the theater arts? Are
certain time periods more important
than others? Are certain geographic
or sub-cultural areas the only ones to
be included?
Certainly, students in academia
must make decisions such as these
when they plan their intellectual en
deavors. This is just the point: indi
viduals should make these decisions.

We question whether the Faculty Se
nate could possibly know what is
best for every student.
Commitment called for
Another criticism of the multi
track model is that the proposed
tracks are either courses already
taught at the University or minor alt
erations of existing programs. We
would like to see the University de
monstrate its commitment to under
graduate education by providing
money to develop innovative new
courses taught in small classes where
both students and facilitators will
benefit.
With the multi-track scheme we
feel the University would wash its
hands of the commitment to excel
lence in undergraduate curricula as it
passes the responsibility to shape the
requirement onto individual de
partments.
An acute problem might develop
in that certain departments will be
more attuned to increasing the
numbers of their departmental
majors and to enhancing the impor
tance of their discipline within the
academic community than they will
be to providing an innovative and
educationally sound program to ful
fill the requirement.
Self-interest abounds
Perhaps the most unsettling aspect
of the process by which the scenario
for implementation is to be chosen,
is that this process is increasingly
political by nature. There is no ques
tion that everyone is watching out for
their own intersts, and that no one
desires to take the full responsibility
for funding a viable program.
We ask then: who is concerned
with the quality of undergraduate
education? As the Western Culture
Task Force's preferred proposal be
gins to be viewed — for various
reasons — with disfavor, we must be

wary of alternatives that are hastily
conceived. We would be appalled to
see the institution of a program simi
lar to that of the 50s and 60s.
We agree with the task force that
the multi-track proposal is second
rate. In view of the spiraling costs of
education'— not to mention this
University's insistence on academic
excellence — second rate is not ac
ceptable.

Westly, Grethel

Since we are concerned about the
quality of undergraduate education
at Stanford, we are not only attentive
to the nature of a Western Culture
requirement, but also to how such a
requirement might be instituted. The
model for implementation that
seems to be gaining favor among
University policy formulators is the
multi-track scheme. We believe that
this model is faulty on many counts,
and that it is educationally unsound.
One of the rationales for the West
ern Culture requirement was to pro
vide all students with a like
background in the "major historical
trends" of Western Culture. Yet, the
multi-track scenario indicates that
students will be forced to focus only
on the areas with which their track
deals.
Indeed, it is probable that many
students might finish the require
ment and still not know whether De
scartes was born before the birth of
Jesus of Nazareth. Their familiarity
with these two historical figures will
be dependent upon their track's con
tent. In essence, the multi-track
models are too narrow in scope.
In addition, the multi-track
scheme forces the predominantly
white male Faculty Senate to make a
series of difficult — if not impossible
— value judgements. How many
track alternatives should there be?
Should Philosophy or Religious
Studies be included? Is art more im
portant than music? What about the
West's tradition in the theater arts? Are
certain time periods more important
than others? Are certain geographic
or sub-cultural areas the only ones to
be included?
Certainly, students in academia
must make decisions such as these
when they plan their intellectual en
deavors. This is just the point: indi
viduals should make these decisions.

We question whether the Faculty Se
nate could possibly know what is
best for every student.
Commitment called for
Another criticism of the multi
track model is that the proposed
tracks are either courses already
taught at the University or minor alt
erations of existing programs. We
would like to see the University de
monstrate its commitment to under
graduate education by providing
money to develop innovative new
courses taught in small classes where
both students and facilitators will
benefit.
With the multi-track scheme we
feel the University would wash its
hands of the commitment to excel
lence in undergraduate curricula as it
passes the responsibility to shape the
requirement onto individual de
partments.
