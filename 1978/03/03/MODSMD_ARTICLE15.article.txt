# Abernethy speaks on South Africa to Phi Beta Kappa
## 
### Ann Lincoln 
It is "easy to talk as a moralist
because it is not hard to find
massive evidence of injustice
based on racism," David Aber
nethy, assoc. prof, of political
science, said Tuesday night at
the annual Phi Beta Kappa lec
ture.
Speaking in the Meyer
Forum Room, about "South Af
rica — Revolution or Evolu
tion?" Abernethy discussed
changes in the 10 South African
countries and said that the
South Africa issue was "impor
tant because of investment
policies."
South Africa is very depen
dent right now on its economic
system, according to Aber
nethy, who described that sys
tem as an "economic lever."
"That is the point of vulnera
bility, and that is why the ques
tion of investment becomes
crucial," said Abernethy. He
also said that "the presence of
outsiders accentuates cleav
ages" in some South African
countries.
"Whatever we do, we're
going to alienate some fac
tion," Abernethy said about
United States involvement in
Rhodesia.
Free elections
Outside analysts have trou
ble looking at the problems in
South Africa to discover what
the people there need because
they tend to project their own
views on groups in societies,
Abernethy said.
"The only way we can find
out what people want is to give
them a choice," Abernethy
said as he stressed the impor
tance of free elections.
Abernethy said that "revolu

tion or evolution" implies that
the two terms are "logical op
posites" but that the change in
the countries in South Africa
can be broken into degrees.
The change varies according
to its pace or rapidity, Aber
nethy said. Evolution takes
place slowly and revolution is
much faster, he explained.
Another variance in change
is the amount of violence used.
And, the change differs accord
ing to how far the countries

want to go from where they
are, he said.
The 10 countries in South Af
rica are Swaziland, Botswana,
Luisutzu, Malawi, Zambia, An
gola, Mozambique, Southwest
Africa, Rhodesia and South Af
rica. Abernathy divided these
countries into six different

categories according to when
or if they gained their depen
dence and what the situations
in each country were.
Some examples Abernethy
gave of these different condi
tions were: whether or not the
mother country used induce
ments or coercion, the number
of settlers in the colony and the
attitude of the mother country
toward its colonies.
One other consideration
that greatly affects the decol
onization process is the col
ony's importance to what
Abernethy called the great
powers: United States, USSR
and China. Location and
natural resources are two qual
ities that might appeal to these
powers, he added.
"The greater the value to the
outside, the slower the decol
onization process will be and
the greater the chance of out
side intervention is," said
Abernethy.

Outside analysts have trou
ble looking at the problems in
South Africa to discover what
the people there need because
they tend to project their own
views on groups in societies,
Abernethy said.
"The only way we can find
out what people want is to give
them a choice," Abernethy
said as he stressed the impor
tance of free elections.
Abernethy said that "revolu

tion or evolution" implies that
the two terms are "logical op
posites" but that the change in
the countries in South Africa
can be broken into degrees.
The change varies according
to its pace or rapidity, Aber
nethy said. Evolution takes
place slowly and revolution is
much faster, he explained.
Another variance in change
is the amount of violence used.
And, the change differs accord
ing to how far the countries

want to go from where they
are, he said.
The 10 countries in South Af
rica are Swaziland, Botswana,
Luisutzu, Malawi, Zambia, An
gola, Mozambique, Southwest
Africa, Rhodesia and South Af
rica. Abernathy divided these
countries into six different

categories according to when
or if they gained their depen
dence and what the situations
in each country were.
Some examples Abernethy
gave of these different condi
tions were: whether or not the
mother country used induce
ments or coercion, the number
of settlers in the colony and the
attitude of the mother country
toward its colonies.
One other consideration
that greatly affects the decol
onization process is the col
ony's importance to what
Abernethy called the great
powers: United States, USSR
and China. Location and
natural resources are two qual
ities that might appeal to these
powers, he added.
"The greater the value to the
outside, the slower the decol
onization process will be and
the greater the chance of out
side intervention is," said
Abernethy.

It is "easy to talk as a moralist
because it is not hard to find
massive evidence of injustice
based on racism," David Aber
nethy, assoc. prof, of political
science, said Tuesday night at
the annual Phi Beta Kappa lec
ture.
Speaking in the Meyer
Forum Room, about "South Af
rica — Revolution or Evolu
tion?" Abernethy discussed
changes in the 10 South African
countries and said that the
South Africa issue was "impor
tant because of investment
policies."
South Africa is very depen
dent right now on its economic
system, according to Aber
nethy, who described that sys
tem as an "economic lever."
"That is the point of vulnera
bility, and that is why the ques
tion of investment becomes
crucial," said Abernethy. He
also said that "the presence of
outsiders accentuates cleav
ages" in some South African
countries.
"Whatever we do, we're
going to alienate some fac
tion," Abernethy said about
United States involvement in
Rhodesia.
