# Women learn self-defense
##

from the University News Service
Students have to beat their teacher physically
to pass Matt Thomas' class here. Not once, but
repeatedly.
Thomas is no masochist. He's a carefully pad
ded "model mugger" in a women's self-defense
class offered by SWOPSI.
His basic points are simple: use your wits and
common sense to avoid an assault whenever
possible. But if someone grabs you, strike back
hard and fast. Don't pull your punches and don't
hesitate to kick a man when he's down. Thomas
combines book reading, discussions, and
graphic demonstrations to drive these lessons
home.
"Women's first reactions to model mugging'
are fear, terror, immobilization, and wild flail
ing. But these mistakes are made in class.
"By the time they're finished, they've been
"assaulted' 50 times, but the last 10 or 20 they
don't make mistakes. Failing a chemistry course
may be traumatic, but nowhere near so as failing
a self-defense course on the street,' he says.
Thomas has taught more than 1000 women in
self-defense at Harvard, Radcliffe, Wellesley,
and Stanford. Several have become teachers in
turn. To date, 20 women graduates have per
ceived potentially dangerous situations and av
oided violence entirely.
Six women were assaulted. Four used
psychological ploys to avoid rape.
One woman was followed home by her assail
ant. Instead of going to her own door, where
assaults often occur, she broke the window of
her most belligerent neighbor, just as her assail
ant started to rush her. When the neighbor
emerged yelling, the assailant fled.

Another was grabbed in an icy parking lot. She
fell to the ground. As her assailant approached,
she kicked him in the groin. He was still disabled
when the Harvard police arrived 15 minutes la
ter. She likewise cried and shook.
She had taken the course two years earlier and
had had no further practice.
Thomas stresses a highly practical, everyday
approach in self-defense training.
His interest was triggered six years ago when a
woman black belt in karate was raped by an
unarmed assailant. She apologized to her
teacher and to Thomas, her senior instructor,
for disgracing her training.
T felt we had disgraced her by teaching her an
art and not self-defense," Thomas recalls. He
investigated the records of 2700 assaults on
women and designed his course accordingly:
"Most women get assaulted in dim light. I
teach them to fight in the dark.'
"Since they normally aren't wearing loose fit
ting clothes or walking barefoot on specially
treated floors, I teach in street clothes and
shoes, in a variety of settings, without warmups.
"Ninety per cent of karate is taught standing
up, but almost 40 per cent of the assaulted
women were already knocked to the ground
before realizing they were being attacked. So I
teach kicking and punching up from the
ground, fallen-dog style kung Fu.
"Most importantly, in karate sparring, women
hold their punches to prevent injury to their
opponent and try not to strike vital areas like the
eyes, throat, temples, knees, and groin. These
are the very areas a woman must strike unless
she has developed crushing power. They are the
only areas I train them to strike, and I react

accordingly, providing instant feedback.
"Men are used to the struggle involved in
contact sports. Women must be reconditioned
to struggle, fight, and continue fighting until
they win. This has been most difficult, because
women have been conditioned not to win.
''Women need to knock an assailant out
rather than just injuring him. Kicking the model
mugger when he is down is the hardest
psychological barrier to overcome. Most
martial arts don't explain how even in submis
sion there are opportunities to strike back and
win, or to submit and endure. There are times to
fight and times to endure. A woman should
know how to distinguish between these times.
' Most martial arts ignore locks, burglar
alarms, and firearms. These all have their place.
Women can prevent assaults by being wary
— not paranoid, but aware. I don t want a little
self-confidence to be endagered by bravado.
Even I don't walk the streets of San Francisco
alone at night."
While Thomas was a medical student at Har
vard his lover was raped at Stanford and brutally
beaten afterwards. "She was a pacifist to the nth
degree," he notes. "My duty was confirmed —
to prevent this."
Thomas left Harvard after two years and
worked with juvenile gangs. Now a stockbroker
with Merrill Lynch, he continues to teach
women self-defense and hopes to write a book,
so his methods can be analyzed and improved.
Thomas and several of his students will de
monstrate "model muggings" as part of a free
public forum on "Violence Against Women:
Changing Our Reality," scheduled for 1 to 4
p.m. tomorrow in Annenberg Auditorium of the
Cummrngs Art building.


Matthew Thomas performs "model muggings as instructor of the delf-defense class foi
women here. Thomas and several of his students will demonstrate these and othei
self-defense techniques at the rape education forum tomorrow in Annenberg Au
ditorium.
