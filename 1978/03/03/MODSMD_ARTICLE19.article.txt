# Senior class presidents have enthusiasm, ideas
## 
### Kathy Trafton Sue Goldfarb 
"Being a senior class presi
dent sometimes means not
having a beer at Zot's during
the happy hour, but getting
satisfaction out of watching
everybody else drinking and
enjoying," said Senior Class
Co-president Clark Sterling.
Most students know that the
four senior class co
presidents, Beverly Standing,
Peter Jones, Pam Strike and
Sterling, do a lot of social or
ganizing. After all, they are in
charge of the class budget.
But they also maintain a rep
resentative function that is
overlooked by most students
and even potential contenders
in this year's elections for
senior class co-president.
The co-presidents represent

the students at large as well as
seniors in the eyes of the Uni
versity, the administration and
the community. They must also
help select a class speaker for
Commencement and Bac
calaureate, organize commit
tees and work with the ad
ministration.
"The job has infinite pos
sibilities. You can really be
creative if you keep lines open
with University adminis
trators,'' Sterling said.
Divide jobs
The co-presidents divide
both official and unofficial jobs
among themselves based on
their individual interests.
Standing is the official liaison
between seniors and the
Career Planning and Place
ment Center. Jones is in charge
of the Senior Brunch and the

beer runs to Zot's.
Strike is a voting member of
the Board of Directors of the
Alumni Association which
oversees and runs the entire
Stanford Alumni Association,
including the Bowman Alumni
House, the Sierra Camp and
alumni clubs all over the coun
try.
Sterling sits on the commit
tee that appoints alumni to the
Board of Trustees, is budget di
rector and is in charge of the
bi-quarterly senior newsletter.
Treasury
The senior class treasury
contains about $4000 at the be
ginning of each year. However,
"a lot of that money is im
mediately spoken for the June
Commencement," Sterling
said. We have to pay for a time
capsule plaque, a class gift and

class luncheon expenses in
June."
So far this year, the class
treasury has financed happy
hours, the Street Dance, the
Senior Rooter held in conjunc
tion with Big Came Week,
Casino Night and study breaks.
A major event that "couldn't
have come off without outside
resources," Jones said, was
Senior Casino Night. "The
Alumni Association made
Casino Night possible," he
said.
Alumni support
In addition, the Alumni As
sociation will help fund both
the Senior Almanac, which is a
selection of highlights from the
Class of '78, and the Senior Di
rectory. This alumni support
augments alumni membersip
as seniors become familiar
with the association.
Very few of the co
presidents' duties were clearly

defined at the outset of this
year.
"Nobody told us what to
do," Strike said. "There is no
automatic advisor or coor
dinator, no one to answer to.
You just take the ball and run
with it."
The co-presidents said they
plan to leave a file for their suc
cessors containing information
on what they have done this
year.
Senior sheet
To keep communication
lines open with the senior
class, the co-presidents pub
lish the Senior Sheet Newslet
ter twice per quarter. They
have also established an effec
tive distribution system. Each
residence which houses
seniors has a resident rep
resentative who hands out
Senior Sheets to all seniors in
the house.
Yet even with all the careful

planning, things can go awry.
For example, the co-presidents
realized too late that the Senior
Rooter was on National Day of
Fasting.
"We didn't have any prob
lem giving out our root beer
floats," Sterling said. "We ran
out in 45 minutes, and we had a
lot of ice cream. Maybe people
were so hungry and thirsty they
didn't care."
Turning point
Sterling said that this year is a
"turning point in senior class
consciousness and unity.
People do have a feeling about
being a senior."
In previous years, 100 pitch
ers of beer sufficed at happy
hours. But 75 extra pitchers
were needed during the first
happy hour this quarter, and
the seniors would have drunk
more, Sterling said.
Attendance at Casino Night
was "incredible," Sterling said.

The Alumni Association told
the co-presidents to consider
the event a success if 350 tickets
were sold. Three days before
the event all 500 tickets had
been sold, and desperate
seniors vainly tried to purchase
more.
The other three co
presidents agreed with Stand
ing when she said, "we have a
very supportive class."
The co-presidents said that
they feel they have done well
and have enjoyed their jobs
because they knew each other
well when they ran for office
and they work well together.
Croups planning to run to
gether for Senior Class Presi
dent this spring should not use
a purely political approach, ac
cording to Jones.
"It's important to know each
other well, Strike said. "Don't
seek out strangers just to
broaden your vote."
