# EPA investigates charges
## SRI accused of falsifying tests 
### Lee Tien 
The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) is investigating SRI In
ternational on charges that the firm
formerly known as the Stanford Re
search Institute, falsified research
results obtained during a chemicals
testing project performed for Shell
Chemical Company about 10 years
ago.
SRI was a part of the University at
that time. Legal ties were severed in
January 1970.
Allegations by a former SRI
employee who had participated in
the project, Jean Hudlow, were re
sponsible for the inquiry which
began last August.
Hudlow said "because of the way
research was conducted, and be
cause of Dr. (Gordon) Newell's at
titude and outright efforts in chang
ing the results of the testing, the test
ing of Shell pesticides by SRI is in
valid."
Three of the chemicals tested by
SRI during the period under ques
tion have reached the market, ac
cording to Josephine Huang, a tech
nical investigator for the EPA. The
chemicals are "vapona, Azodrin and
Planavin. Vapona is the active ingre
dient in the Shell No-Pest Strip," she
added.
Proper procedures
Hudlow said proper experimental
procedures during the testing had
not been observed. She said rats and
other laboratory animals had died
and been replaced without record
ing their deaths. She added that
Newell "changed the data arbitrarily
more than once."
Newell, director of toxicology in
the Life Sciences Division at SRI, re
fused to comment on the charges
until the final investigative report is
issued by the EPA. He said he expects
the report within a few weeks.
Ronald Deutsch, SRI director of
public relations, acknowledged the
audit but said, "We are confident

that the institute will be cleared by
the final report."
A spokesman for Shell agreed, say
ing SRI has always had very high cre
dibility. "We are very concerned
about the investigation. We feel that
the chemicals are safe for use as re
gistered," he added.
Pesticide laws
Keith Takata, an attorney for the
EPA's San Francisco office, called the
charges "fairly serious." If the
charges are substantiated, civil or
criminal proceedings could be in
itiated under federal pesticide laws.

These laws require that all pesticides
used in the United States be regis
tered by the EPA as being safe for
use, he said.
Takata said other chemical com
panies have had similar problems.
"We're discovering more and more
things. It may be more common than
we think."
John Ulfelder, of the EPA Office of
Enforcement in Washington, D.C.,
said criticism of existing pesticide re
gistration from congressional lead
ers especially Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass), has contributed strongly
to the force of EPA probes.

A spokesman for Shell agreed, say
ing SRI has always had very high cre
dibility. "We are very concerned
about the investigation. We feel that
the chemicals are safe for use as re
gistered," he added.
Pesticide laws
Keith Takata, an attorney for the
EPA's San Francisco office, called the
charges "fairly serious." If the
charges are substantiated, civil or
criminal proceedings could be in
itiated under federal pesticide laws.

These laws require that all pesticides
used in the United States be regis
tered by the EPA as being safe for
use, he said.
Takata said other chemical com
panies have had similar problems.
"We're discovering more and more
things. It may be more common than
we think."
John Ulfelder, of the EPA Office of
Enforcement in Washington, D.C.,
said criticism of existing pesticide re
gistration from congressional lead
ers especially Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass), has contributed strongly
to the force of EPA probes.
