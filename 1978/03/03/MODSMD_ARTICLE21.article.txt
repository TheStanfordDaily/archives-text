# SQUID measures heart's signals

University researchers re
cently developed a device that
measures the heart's magnetic
. field, and informational previ
. ously not obtainable with con
ventional electrocardiograms
(EKGs) can now be provided.
The Superconducting Quan
tum Interference Device, or
SQUID, may increase reliabil
ity in the diagnosis of heart dis
ease, Medical School spokes
men say.
SQUID is a differential mag
netometer that amplifies the
heart's magnetic signals so
they can be measured and dis
played in a graphic form similar
to an EKC.
The magnetic fields pro
duced by the heart are very dif
ficult to measure because they
are one million times weaker
than the earth's magnetic field,
said Mark Leifer, graduate stu
dent in applied physics here.
Leifer co-directs mag
netometry technique de
velopment with William Fair
bank, professor of physics.
Magnetic interference
Previous efforts to pick up
these tiny cardiac fields have
been hampered by magnetic
interference such as power
line noise and even magnetic
noise from cars driving along
the street outside.
Conventional methods can
not diagnose certain heart
conditions which involve ab
normal electrical conduction
through the heart, according

to Dr. Donald Harrison, pro
fessor of cardiology.
"Magnetocardiography
(MCG) may be helpful in diag
nosing potential heart at
tacks," says Harrison, "Many
of the cellular properties re
lated to the spread of impulses
in the heart are not under
stood. The magnetocardiog
ram will provide new insight
into these properties."
The results of initial clinical
SQUID studies were reported
in the December 16 issue of
"Science" magazine by Drs.
Fairbank, Harrison, William
Barry, and their associates.
So far the Stanford group is
the only research team which
has "quantitatively de
monstrated the accuracy of the
measurement technique and
ability of MCG to detect car
diac events not reflected in
EKG," says Leifer.
More accurate
This new technique is more
accurate in reflecting events in
the heart, says Leifer, and can
be used quickly and easily in a
clinical setting.
The $26,000 SQUID mag
netometer, in its present form,
can be adapted to hospital use,
said Harrison. It makes mass
screening for cardiac problems
easier and, unlike EKGs, does
not require the attachment of
electrodes to the body.
The University plans to con
duct cooperative studies with
Wikswo in the future, Leifer
said.

amplifies the heart's magnetic signals so that they may be recorded
and measured. Doctors are hopeful that magnetocardiography will
aid in diagnosing potential heart attacks.
