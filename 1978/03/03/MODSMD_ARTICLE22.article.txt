# For European parliament
## Belgian prof discusses election 
### Paulette Truman 
Next spring, a European parliament will
be directly elected by the European pub
lic, an event that has never occurred in the
past, according to Prof. Henry Brugmans
of the College of Europe in Bruges, Bel
gium, when he spoke here on Tuesday.
In a special lecture for Political Science
Prof. |an Triska's class, "Introduction to
International Law," Brugmans, the presi
dent of the Federal Committee of the
European Federalists, said that the current
European Parliament, an indirectly
elected organization of the European
Economic Community, "has no real pow
ers of its own."
He added that the objectives for this par
liament are exclusively devoted to discus
sing and making recommendations con
cerning social, financial, political, and ag
ricultural problems that face the European
Community.
Its important function is in controlling
the European Community budget, he said.
Through universal secret ballot in the
spring of 1979, the people would give this
parliament more power and would give
European integration, in general, more
force.
Practical issues
"I hope that the European Parliament
discussions will be about practical issues
rather than theoretical issues," Brugmans
said.

One major problem challenging the
success of the parliament is whether or not
the nine member countries will deal with
their own national problems or with the
problems facing all of Europe.
"The sectional instead of global ap
proach to problems have made it nearly
impossible to reach important decisions,"
Brugmans said.
Candidates for the European Parliament
run representing one of three main groups
— the Liberals, the Christian Democrats,
and the Socialists.
"In the European Parliament, the speak
ers are not spokesmen for their country,
but for the group as a whole," Brugmans
said.
European community
Of the nine countries in the European
community, some are devoted European
Federalists who conceive of Europe as the
united states of Europe while others are, as
Brugmans labelled them, "little Englan
dish countries" because of their strong
nationalistic attitudes.
Brugmans predicted that the parties in
the countries will fight out the elections on
national issues rather than the European
issues as they should.
Another problem facing the Parliament
is the veto right each member holds.
"The veto right has paralyzed the com
munity," Brugmans said. Brugmans added

that now with the possible addition of
three new members "the community is
likely to become ungovernable." The
three ex-dictatorship countries — Greece,
Portugal, and Spain — would increase the
membership of the European Community
from nine to twelve countries, he said.
Double mandate
All members of the European Parliament
are members of their own national parlia
ment. This double mandate poses con
flicts of interest, according to Brugmans.
He said that it has been suggested that
when a topic being discussed in a national
parliament is also being discussed in the
European Parliament, the representative
from that country should not be allowed to
vote on that issue.
After being elected to the Parliament,
members should expect to spend about
100 days in dealing with the European
Parliament-related issues. This can be de
trimental to a member's effectiveness in
his national parliament since he would be
absent so much, Brugmans said.
Brugmans repetitively labelled himself
as an optimist and although he said, "It
seems rather ambiguous to have an
elected parliament without a government
in front of it to control," he favored the
force that this directly elected European
Parliament would gain for European integ
ration.

dent of the Federal Committee of the
European Federalists, said that the current
European Parliament, an indirectly
elected organization of the European
Economic Community, "has no real pow
ers of its own."
He added that the objectives for this par
liament are exclusively devoted to discus
sing and making recommendations con
cerning social, financial, political, and ag
ricultural problems that face the European
Community.
Its important function is in controlling
the European Community budget, he said.
Through universal secret ballot in the
spring of 1979, the people would give this
parliament more power and would give
European integration, in general, more
force.
Practical issues
"I hope that the European Parliament
discussions will be about practical issues
rather than theoretical issues," Brugmans
said.

One major problem challenging the
success of the parliament is whether or not
the nine member countries will deal with
their own national problems or with the
problems facing all of Europe.
"The sectional instead of global ap
proach to problems have made it nearly
impossible to reach important decisions,"
Brugmans said.
Candidates for the European Parliament
run representing one of three main groups
— the Liberals, the Christian Democrats,
and the Socialists.
"In the European Parliament, the speak
ers are not spokesmen for their country,
but for the group as a whole," Brugmans
said.
European community
Of the nine countries in the European
community, some are devoted European
Federalists who conceive of Europe as the
united states of Europe while others are, as
Brugmans labelled them, "little Englan
dish countries" because of their strong
nationalistic attitudes.
Brugmans predicted that the parties in
the countries will fight out the elections on
national issues rather than the European
issues as they should.
Another problem facing the Parliament
is the veto right each member holds.
"The veto right has paralyzed the com
munity," Brugmans said. Brugmans added

that now with the possible addition of
three new members "the community is
likely to become ungovernable." The
three ex-dictatorship countries — Greece,
Portugal, and Spain — would increase the
membership of the European Community
from nine to twelve countries, he said.
Double mandate
All members of the European Parliament
are members of their own national parlia
ment. This double mandate poses con
flicts of interest, according to Brugmans.
He said that it has been suggested that
when a topic being discussed in a national
parliament is also being discussed in the
European Parliament, the representative
from that country should not be allowed to
vote on that issue.
After being elected to the Parliament,
members should expect to spend about
100 days in dealing with the European
Parliament-related issues. This can be de
trimental to a member's effectiveness in
his national parliament since he would be
absent so much, Brugmans said.
Brugmans repetitively labelled himself
as an optimist and although he said, "It
seems rather ambiguous to have an
elected parliament without a government
in front of it to control," he favored the
force that this directly elected European
Parliament would gain for European integ
ration.
Next spring, a European parliament will
be directly elected by the European pub
lic, an event that has never occurred in the
past, according to Prof. Henry Brugmans
of the College of Europe in Bruges, Bel
gium, when he spoke here on Tuesday.
In a special lecture for Political Science
Prof. |an Triska's class, "Introduction to
International Law," Brugmans, the presi
dent of the Federal Committee of the
European Federalists, said that the current
European Parliament, an indirectly
elected organization of the European
