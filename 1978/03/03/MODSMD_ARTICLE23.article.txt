Recently while socializing with a group of
friends, the subject of Donna Summer and her
sexuality was discussed.
Someone mentioned that they had read an
article which stated she was a transsexual.
After examining her album covers and the
lyrics of her songs, we are still torn with debate
as to whether or not she is a transsexual. Could
you please tell us what she is?

Donna Summer records with Casablanca Re
cords, so I called them in Los Angeles (825 Sun
set Blvd.) to find an answer. They denied the
rumor that she is a transsexual. Donna Summer
has been married, they said, and has "kids" from
that marriage.

Who lives in the lakefront house between
Lambda Nu and the Boathouse?
Why are they making such extensive im
provements io this house, and who is paying for
it?
Joel Smith, vice-president for development, is
the current resident. Years ago, Dean Hargadon
used to live there.
Smith said he leases the house from the Uni
versity. As for the improvements, Smith said that
a new kitchen was just added (the old one was a
bit small).
Since the University owns the house, they pay
for any improvements made.
