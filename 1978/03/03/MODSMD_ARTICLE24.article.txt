# Lobbying chapter possible
## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
In response to the concern
about continuing rises in tui
tion, the ASSU Council of Pres
idents has agreed to contact
the Coalition of Independent
College and University Stu
dents (COPUS), a student lob
bying group.
David Aladjem, a freshman,
is heading the correspondence
with COPUS, an organization
which addresses itself to state
and national issues affecting
student finances to determine
whether a COPUS chapter may
be established here.
The purpose of COPUS is to
ensure that higher private edu
cation is not based on the abil
ity to pay, according to Alad
jem.
It attempts to prevent private
education from being an op
tion open only to either the
very rich or the very poor, who
can secure financial aid.
COPUS functions under the
proposition that private educa
tion is open to all.
Current issues that affect
student finances are the prop
osed $1.5 billion increase to
student aid that is before Con
gress,.and the tax credit plan
that gives a $250 tax credit on
higher education. Activities are
open to the whole student
body. "Everything so far has
been open and I don't antici
pate this changing," Aladjem
commented.
Mike Vorhaus, a COPUS
representative, visited the
campus and contacted the ad
ministration, Anne Henkels,
ASSU Co-president, and Tom
McCormack, ASSU Senator.
He informed them of the type
of activity COPUS does, which
is mainly lobbying, and Hen
kels responded, "COPUS
serves a very valuable function.

We're just not sure how Stan
ford can best participate."
Aladjem investigates rela
tionships and participation in
organizations like COPUS,
Henkels said. Aladjem added
that correspondence with
COPUS is presently in prog
ress.
Henkels said Aladjem was
selected after she and McCor
mack had spoken to several
people who responded to an
OATO announcement. She
said Aladjem showed particu
lar interest and concern, and
seemed willing to spend time
on the project.

"It is important for students
to know what the University is
doing, too," Henkels said.
"That's where Bob Freelen, (di
rector of government rela
tions) comes in. He is vital."
Henkels said that if a
COPUS chapter opens on
campus, "The ASSU should be
involved in a semi
institutionalized way. It should
be a permanent part of ASSU
functioning, whether under
the jurisdiction of an intern
ship, a committee, a self
perpetuating student group, or
the ASSU Council of Presi
dents.
