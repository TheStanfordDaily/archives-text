"We're doing something probably no other school is doing,"
says Keith Archuleta, co-founder of the Stanford Black Media
Institute (SBMI), "We're providing a media service."
SBMI is a unique student-founded organization that attempts
to encourage black students to get involved in the media. It
coordinates three publications and one radio show: The Real
News newspaper, Nia magazine, Grapevine newsletter, and
'TCB'' (Taking Care of Business) show on KZSU.
The organization provides a Pan-African news service, media
workshops, career planning aid, and a medium through which
other campus publications can learn about black issues.
SBMI mails Tne Real News to several colleges in the United
States and most African nations.
"When we send it (The Real News) to colleges we give them
something to go by. In a very informal way we end up helping
other people," says Archuleta.
SBMI was founded last summer to "promote and develop the
culture, education, and general welfare of the black commun
ity."
Objectives for this spring are to give a class on the media and
create a media-arts center in the Harmony House on Lomita
Drive. "It will eventually be a studio-meeting place," says Anne
Pogue, "TCB" co-producer.
In regards to other plans, Archuleta says, "We're not at a loss
for ideas. All we need is some more people to help us do it
better."
