# Cardinal women dump USF, 71-60, in final game
## Stanford may get bid for regional tournament 
### Sukie Jackson 
The Stanford women's basketball team
saved their best for last. In their final game
of the season, the Cards put together their
best overall effort yet to down the Univer
sity of San Francisco Dons, 71-60.
Stanford standouts Maggie Nelson and
Kathy Murphy turned out their usual good
performances, Nelson netting 19 points
and Murphy 10. But coach Dottie McCrea
was especially pleased that "points came
from Cooper, Bruggman, Steiner and
Lough too." Sophomore guard Peggy
Bruggman started the match in place of
Stephanie Calef, who suffered a jaw injury
against San Jose State, and Bruggman
proved herself to be an able ball handler.
She scored a season high of seven points.
Ann Cooper and Renee Steiner, both
freshman forwards, hit double figures
also, Cooper getting 11 and Steiner 10 in
the match.
Starting Wednesday's game with an
exhibition on how not to miss, the Cards
took a quick 17 point lead, seven minutes
into the first half. USF coach Walt Bugler
explained, "We got off to a terrible start,
we have a tendency to do that." But a
combination of the Cards cooling off and
the Dons warming up brought the halftime
score to 37-32, Stanford.
"You have to give them credit for com
ing back," McCrea said. In the second half
the Dons trailed by eight points until USF's
Mary Hile hit several consecutive baskets
to bring her team within one point, 48-49

with nine minutes left in the game.
The two teams exchanged baskets and
the score stayed close until Murphy
scored two baskets underneath before
fouling out to give the Cards a more com
fortable six point margin. Stanford held
this margin until USF's only offensive
threat, Hile, fouled out with 1:22 remain
ing in the game. The Cards continued scor
ing and widened their lead to nine points
by the end of the contest.
"The kids depend too much on Hile,"
Bugler commented, "but experience will
take care of that.' He attributed his team's
loss to the "difference in maturity of the
two teams." The USF squad, which con
sists of all freshmen and sophomores,
finishes its season with a 6-6 record in the
Northern California Athletic Conference.
For Stanford, its most recent victory
boosted its league record to 9-3 and 16-10
overall. But the Cards' season may not be
over yet. The selection committee for the
regional tournament meets Sunday to
chose the four "at large" teams that will
participate in the contest. Stanford may be
chosen because of their league record and
because they are hosting the tournament.
Regardless whether they play or not, the
Stanford women and coaches had a good,
winning season. "It feels good for me,"
McCrea said, "because this is my first win
ning season ever."
The Cards will lose two senior players
this year, Maggie Nelson and guard Nancy
Lowold. Although Lowold has seen little

action on the basketball court, she spoke
positively about the program. "Overall
I've been happy to be a member of this
team. The program has come a long way
and I think it's on the right track," she said.
"My playing time's been so little that I ha
ven't been satisfied with my personal per
formance but hopefully I have contributed
something to the program."
Nelson, on the other hand, started all
four years at Stanford and graduates as the
school's leading scorer. Averaging 19
points and eight rebounds a game, Nelson
hopes to continue her basketball career
playing with a professional team in
Europe.
