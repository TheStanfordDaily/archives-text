# Gymnasts set for last meet

The women's gymnastics team travels to San
lose again to face familiar opposition — Fresno
State, California, and the Spartans, but this time,
the predictions and circumstances are different.
The Cardinals have beaten Fresno in both
previous meetings, lost to the Spartans twice,
and finished behind California by .9 of a point. A
combination of an improved Stanford team and
a less-than-healthy Cal team should result in a
stronger showing by the Cards as runner-ups to
San Jose in tonight's 6:30 p.m. meet.
"I think this time out we'll beat Cal. I think
they've had more injuries and a couple of girls
with more problems than we have, so I'm look
ing forward to coming in second now," said
Stanford's head coach Jackie Walker.
While all gymnastics meets are important for
individual and team development, this meet de
termines the Nor-Cal Conference champions
and also can qualify gymnasts and teams for the
Region 8 Championships held next Friday and
Saturday in San Diego.
Does competing in the conference champ
ionships change the strategy of the coach? Not
according to Walker, who prefers consistency to
change. "We're going to try to just be consistent
and do exactiy what we did last weekend and go
for qualifying scores. If you try too many things
near the end of the season, you have too many
chances to mess up," she said.
"I think the girls are ready. They were ready
last weekend and they're kind of excited to

finish up the season," Walker said.
"It (the season) has been hard for them —
some of them have never had eight gymnastics
meets in a 10 week period before in their life, so
they're looking forward to a nice rest after this
last conference meet. The only thing is the indi
viduals that qualify will have to work out another
week to go to regionals," she added.
Stanford's hopefuls for post-season competi
tion include Saundra Muramatsu, Linda Park
and Dana Padden. Muramatsu, depending upon
her recuperation from a sprained ankle and
knee, could compete in all four events. She is
sidelined from action tonight because of her
injuries. However, she may be petitioned by
Walker to compete in the regionals. Park can
qualify in the vaulting, beam and floor events,
while Padden should reach regionals in vault
ing. Cindy Sedlund has a chance at qualifying on
beam, according to Walker.
On the 10 point judging scale in gymnastics,
an individual needs to receive an 8.5 or better
for a routine to qualify for regionals.
"The judges will be aware of the qualifying
standard while they're judging. I don't know
how they'll react, but hopefully they'll either
qualify a girl or keep her far enough away that
you won't have protests and girls upset and
things like that. That's a tough limitation to have
for a qualification, because an 8.5 is a very, very
good score. So a judge really has a tough deci
sion to make when she sees a gymnast per
form," Walker said.
