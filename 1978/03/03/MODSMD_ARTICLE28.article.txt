# Cagers take on Cal Bears in finale
## 
### David Georgette 
Another season, the same
ending.
Since Dick Dißiaso has been
head basketball coach at Stan
ford, the Cards have closed
every season with a game
against Cal in that antiquated,
cramped place with all the
funny lines on the floor known
as Harmon Gym.
Two years ago, the Cards
went up to Berkeley with two
wins in the Pacific-8 and came
away with a third, last year
went there with three and
came away with the same and
tomorrow will be heading in
therewith two. Tip-off is 8 p.m.
(KZSU 90.1 FM, KSFO 560 AM).
Yet a win tomorrow would
give the Cards their second
best season in the past 11
years. The 1972-73 campaign
had a 14-11 mark, and this
year's team is 12-14.
Cal, meanwhile, is 11-15
overall and 4-9 in the Pac-8. A
win could pull them into
seventh place behind Oregon
in the conference, but even
that would offer little solace to
the Cal fans who, like the Stan
ford folks, had hoped for more
from a team that had nearly all
its starters from last season re
turning.
In the first meeting between
Cal and Stanford in January this
season, the Bears outscored
the Cards 13-2 during a four
minute stretch in the second
half and went on to an 84-68
win.
That loss ended a three
game winning streak for Stan
ford and started the Cards

down a trail of seven straight
losses.
In that game, forward Kevin
Singleton burned the Cards for
23 points, tanning seven of
nine shots from the field.
"Singleton is a great outside
shooter who hurt us last time,"
said Dißiaso. "He may have the
greatest range of all the for
wards in our league."
But the only man to play all
40 minutes that game was Cal
guard Gene Ransom, the
third-leading scorer in the con
ference and a sure all
conference selection. "Against
Cal, your primary concern is
always to stop the ballhandling
and explosiveness of Gene
Ransom," said Dißiaso. "But
they have some pretty good
players, so you just can't focus
on one guy."
While Cal has four players
averaging in double figures,
for Stanford only forward Kim
berly Belton, another sure all
conference player, and center
)eff McHugh are above 10
points a game.
Along with his 15.3 scoring
clip, fifth-best in the loop, Bel
ton has averaged nine re
bounds a game, also fifth best.
McHugh is averaging 10.9
points a ballgame.
In other conference wind
ups tomorrow, Washington is
at Washington State and UCLA
goes after an undefeated con
ference season in a matchup
with USC.
Last night, OSU lost to
Oregon, 54-51, lor the Beavers'
only loss to the Ducks this
season.
