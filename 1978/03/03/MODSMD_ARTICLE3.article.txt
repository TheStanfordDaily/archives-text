# 'Daily' seeks $1 per quarter student fee assessment
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily's Board of
Directors announced yesterday
that it will seek a three-quarter, $1
fee assessment next year for the
Daily.
The Daily will soon begin col
lecting enough student signatures
to place the fee assessment re
quest on the ballot for the April
ASSU election, according to
Editor David Ansley.
For the last three years, the
Daily has received three-quarter,
$1 fee assessments to build up its
reserve operating fund so the
fund would equal one-third of the
Daily's general operating budget.
That goal has been reached, said
Daily Business Manager Robert
Feren.
"The students and the Univer
sity have helped us assure the Dai
ly's financial security," Ansley
said. "But we'd like to improve
the publication, and our corpora
tion's Board of Directors feels it's

reasonable to ask students to con
tinue to pay a subscription of
about 2 cents per issue.
"If we receive the fee assess
ment funds, that money will be
used to make improvements to
the Daily" which may include the
purchasing of modern com
puterized editing equipment,
added Ansley.
The Daily's budget for next year
is projected to be about $350,000.
Of next year's revenues, 10 per
cent would come from the prop
osed fee assessment, Feren said.
"It's impossible to predict how
much production costs will rise
next year, but they will increase at
least as much as inflation, which is
at 7 per cent," said Feren.
Signatures from about 1100 stu
dents, equaling 10 per cent of the
student body, will be needed to
place the fee assessment proposal
on the ballot.
