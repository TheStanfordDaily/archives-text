# Carter: elated and frustrated
## Card co-captain has mixed emotions 
### Emilie Deutsch 
Jay Carter walks off the basketball court
tomorrow night for the last time in his
Pacific-8 career. And with him he takes the
elations and frustrations of the past four
years.
"I have mixed emotions on the end of
this season," Carter said. "On the one
hand, because we're losing, I wish it
would get over with. But on the other
hand, it's my-last year. I don't want it all to
end."
The "all" refers to more than his Stan
ford experience.
"At this point in my life, basketball is
very important to me," said the 6-foot-5,
185 lb. forward. "I've devoted most of my
life to it since I was 10 or 11 years old. All
I've wanted to do is play pro."
But Carter, the Cards' second leading
rebounder, hasn't had many contacts.
"I knew I wouldn't play forward in the
pros," Carter said, "but I didn't have a
chance to play guard this year. They don't
know how I can dribble or go to the bas
ket, so it's just one big question mark
there. They don't like to spend money on
question marks."
The Dayton, Ohio product is confident
that he has the potential to perform if he
were given the opportunity. His best of
fensive game this year was against Oregon
State where he led the team with 23 points.
"Given the chance I think I could sur
prise some people. I don't think I've
played up to my offensive potential at all. I
know I could score. I've just been too con
scious of playing offense. Plus, everyone I
go against in this position is two or three
inches taller and at least 20 or 30 lbs.

heavier. That makes a lot of difference in
working for your shot."
Unfortunately, Carter realizes that the
emphasis must be on team performance
instead of individual desires and because
of this he's not allowed a great deal of
offensive freedom. "I need to be molded
to the team needs," he said.
But that reshaping doesn't seem to have
favorably affected the Cardinal's perfor
mance this season. Carter said there are
two primary causes behind Stanford's ina
bility to win.
"We were out-rebounded and gave up a
lot of easy points," he stated simply. "If we
could have improved those two
categories, a lot of games could have gone
our way. We weren't very successful in
stopping the fast break consistently."
As for himself, the lanky, soft-spoken
athlete said his greatest contribution to
the team would have been not getting in
jured.
"The team's doing well," he said, "and
then I get injured and throw things out of
whack. It happens so much to me I feel like
I'm letting my teammates down. And my
injuries have kept me from achieving a
consistency I know I could otherwise
have."
Under those circumstances it would be
difficult for anyone to keep going but
being co-captain, Carter has a double re
sponsibility.
"It's hard for me to get the otherguys up
game after game," he said. "I have to ad
mit, I don't always do a good job because
I'm always bummed myself."
Could things have been different for
Carter?

"I've had thoughts about playing for a
winning college team," he said, "and one
that doesn't need me as much at forward. I
realize I could have gone to a couple of
basketball schools but I also realize how
hindsight can get ahold of you."
In other ways, looking back can afford
some reassurance, though.
"I think I've improved in my awareness
of the game by having to concentrate on
defense," Carter said. "I'm definitely bet
ter at handling the ball since I've worked
on that for four years. And my jumpshot is
better too."
It's been a long season for a man that
graduated from high school with his eye
on being included on a pro roster. Al
though graduate school is in his long term
plans, Carter admitted, "I'm kind of tired
of studying to tell you the truth. Squeezing
in studying after practicing for five hours
everyday can get to you after four years."
Carter said his teammates have made
those four years easier to take, too.
"There's a lot of harmony on the team.
Everyone pats everyone else on the back."
Carter's going to get his last few pats
tomorrow after a game that's important to
him to win. "It wouldn't save the season,"
he said, "but it would make me feel bet
ter."
The injuries, the frustrated desires, and
the lack of,a destination seem to have pre
vented the season from being worthwhile.
"But it's been a learning experience. In
life, things can't always go well. It teaches
you to keep your head on straight."
And then he sighed and added, "I just
wish there was some other way to go about
it."
