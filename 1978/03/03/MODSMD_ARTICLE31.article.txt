Hoping to keep its two game
winning streak alive, the wo
men's soccer team travels to
Berkeley tomorrow for an 8
p.m. match, the third of their
Nor-Cal Collegiate Women's
Soccer Conference season.
The second team, with a
0-0-1 record, faces Cal in a 6:30
p.m. match-up.
The Cardinal victories came
at the expense of Davis and
Humboldt State and gave head
coach Phil Wright an accurate
idea of the team's ability under
game conditions
"I believe we have the po
tential of being the best college
team in the United States,"
Wright said. "I knew we had
the potential, but I knew we
had personalities and various
other things that might deter
us from playing our best."
"Playing at Davis, I would
have been very happy with a
draw to say the least. We had

some sick players and we
hadn't played a game. I didn't
know what was going to hap
pen," he said.
Kristine McGarrey got the
Cards off on the right track by
kicking a goal in the first mi
nute of play. She added a sec
ond score 30 minutes later, and
Stanford took a 2-1 lead at the
half.
McGarrey made another
goal 15 minutes into the sec
ond half, and the Aggies could
only come up with one more
tally before the final gun.
Besides McGarrey, key piays
were made by sophomore
goalie Lynn McGomb, who had
"a couple of excellent saves"
and sophomore right halfback
Sue Handel, who cleared the
ball from near Stanford's goal
to prevent a Davis goal, Wright
explained.
Stanford had an easier time
against Humboldt, although
the quality of play wasn't as

high.
"Both teams were tired from
playing the day before; they
(Humboldt) played Berkeley
and lost 1-0," Wright said.
Just as in the opening game,
Stanford got off to a quick start,
this time on the shooting skill
of freshman left wing Nancy Jo
Geenan. McGarrey continued
to be the big gun for the Cards,
adding four goals in the 5-0
win, for a total of seven goals in
two days.
"Although we didn't play the
greatest game we've played —
we were not passing very accu
rately — our conditioning
showed and we pressured a lot
and put the ball in the net,
which is obviously the key,"
said Wright.
"Our defense played ex
tremely strong — we had 33
shots; they had three, so we
obviously controlled the
game," Wright added.

(Humboldt) played Berkeley
and lost 1-0," Wright said.
Just as in the opening game,
Stanford got off to a quick start,
this time on the shooting skill
of freshman left wing Nancy Jo
Geenan. McGarrey continued
to be the big gun for the Cards,
adding four goals in the 5-0
win, for a total of seven goals in
two days.
"Although we didn't play the
greatest game we've played —
we were not passing very accu
rately — our conditioning
showed and we pressured a lot
and put the ball in the net,
which is obviously the key,"
said Wright.
"Our defense played ex
tremely strong — we had 33
shots; they had three, so we
obviously controlled the
game," Wright added.
