# Card skiers qualify
## 
### 
At the Pacific Coast Champ
ionships last weekend, the
Stanford women's ski team
placed second behind the Uni
versity of Nevada at Reno and
qualified three skiers for the
AIAW national championships.
The Cardinal men's team,
meanwhile, squeaked into
third place behind Reno and
the University of Alaska at An
chorage.
With a second place finish in
the cross country and a third in
the slalom, sophomore Andrea
Dewey paced the Card women
and received the Skimeister
award for best overall women's
skier. Along with Dewey,
senior captain Laurie Graham
and sophomore Barb Lycan
turned in strongalpinefinishes
and also qualified for the Na
tionals at Red River, N.M., held
next week.

The women's squad
threatened Reno throughout
the meet, despite the absence
of )an Flaherty, who performed
well during the season but
broke her shoulder a week be
fore the championships.
The men's squad, plagued
by falls in the alpine events,
held on through the cross
country and 35 meter jump to
edge out Berkeley and Sierra
College for third place.
Co-captain Dave Herbert
earned a berth to the NCAA
Nationals in New Hampshire
with his sixth place finish in
slalom, while co-captain Kit
Weld and freshman Wally
Krengel qualified as alternates
in the alpine events. Senior
Rusty Schwartz soared 95 feet
to capture a fifth in the jump,
thus qualifying him for the Na
tionals.
