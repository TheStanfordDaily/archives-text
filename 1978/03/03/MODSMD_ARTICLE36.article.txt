Carter tries to support dollar
Washington — President Jimmy Carter tried to prop up
the crashing dollar yesterday by touting investments in
the United States, promising less consumption of
foreign oil and predicting that U.S. trading partners will
be able to buy more American goods.
He pledged to take direct action to support the dollar
if necessary but said it would stabilize and "remain in
good shape" without help once European money mar
kets weigh his statements and start realizing the dollar s
actual worth.
The president spoke at a news conference as the dol
lar encountered renewed pressure after plunging to a
record low on foreign exchanges. The drop means im
ported products such as automobiles and television sets
are likely to cost more in the United States.
It also means Americans overseas will get less for the
dollars they spend.
Park speaks on influence operation
Washington — Tongsun Park reportedly began giving
details of an alleged influence-buying operation to the
House ethics committee yesterday and some members
called it odious and ugly.
"It was a conspiracy of American businessmen, con
gressmen and Koreans to make blatantly improper pay
ments over a sustained period with U.S. taxpayers
money," Rep. Bruce Caputo (R-N.Y.) said. The details
are revolting." Rep. Millicent Fenwick (R-N.J.) said, the
whole thing is ugly."
She and Caputo refused, because of the committee s
secrecy rules, to reveal any of Park's testimony but said
he gave new details on payments already disclosed pub
licly.
Experts investigate plane crash
Los Angeles — Federal investigators determined in
their first day of examining Wednesday's crash of a Con
tinental Air Lines' DC-10 that the plane should have been
able to stop in the remaining 5000 feet of runway availa
ble.
About 100 experts, separated into specialty teams,
sifted through the burned wreckage of the crash that left
two persons dead and injured 85 others.
One of the few determinations investigators were able
to make yesterday was that the two victims probably
died of smoke inhalation, rather than from burns as
previously thought, said James King, a member of the
National Transportation Safety Board. Both victims were
found on the ground on the right side of the plane after
they apparently were incapacitated by falling from an
exit.
Senators accused of delaying debate
Washington — Vice President Walter Mondale ac
cused opponents of the Panama Canal treaties yesterday
of delaying the Senate debate and said the tactic would
undermine their cause.
But he stopped short of calling it a "filibuster," and
said any move to cut off the debate at this time would be
"a harsh remedy" and "premature."
Mondale voiced his opinion as the Senate turned
down another move by treaty foes aimed at keeping U.S.
military forces in Panama after the year 2000. The Senate
later rejected two other opposition-backed amend
ments.
Emerging from a meeting with Majority Leader Robert
Byrd (D-W.Va.), Mondale said it was time to get the
debate — now in its 13th day — off dead center.
Cubans man African front lines
Ethiopia confirmed for the first time yesterday that
Cuban troops are manning front lines alongside Ethio
pians in the African country's war against secessionist
rebels. A rebel leader claimed Cuban paratroopers and
women tank crew members have been dropped into the

battle zone.
Guerrillas fighting in southernmost Ethiopia, mean
while, reported killing two Cuban officers. If the report
is true, it represents the farthest that Havana's troops
have ranged southward in the war.
UMW urged to accept contract
On the eve of the first balloting to ratify a contract that
could end the 87-day-old coal strike, United Mine
Workers President Arnold Miller went to West Virginia
coal country yesterday, and warned that rejection could
kill the UMW.
In Washington President Jimmy Carter urged the min
ers to accept the proposed contract.
Most rank-and-file miners vote on the pact this
weekend, but some locals vote today, others as late as
Monday.
Senate panel recommends Miller
Washington — With only its chairman voting no, the
Senate Banking Committee recommended yesterday
that the Senate confirm William Miller to head the Fed
eral Reserve Board.
Formal confirmation of the nomination of the 52-
year-old board chairman of Textron Inc. to replace Ar
thur Burns as the nation's central banker is expected in
the full Senate today.
Chaplin's body stolen from grave
Corsier Sur Vevey, Switzerland — Crave robbers acting
under cover of darkness stole the body of comedian Charlie
Chaplin, who died Christmas Day, from a tiny unguarded
cemetery in this village where he spent his last 20 years,
police said yesterday.
Police said the heavy wooden coffin was removed
between nightfall Wednesday and dawn yesterday. They
said there was no indication whether it was taken for
ransom. A Corsier municipal official called the theft an
"act of vandalism."
Carter denies 'etiquette conference'
Washington — President Jimmy Carter has been host
to White House conferences on children and youth, on
the handicapped, and on Balanced National Growth and
Economic Development. But he says he is not planning a
White House Conference on Etiquette in Singles Bars.
Carter was responding to a tongue-in-cheek question
prompted by a recent incident in a singles bar involving
his chief aide, Hamilton Jordan. The story, denied by the
White House, was that Jordan spat his amaretto and
cream drink at a woman after an argument.
"Any truth to the rumor you are planning a White
House Conference on Etiquette in Singles Bars?" asked
Frank Aukofer, president of the National Press Club
where the press conference was held.
"This is a matter that had not previously come to my
attention," Carter responded.

It also means Americans overseas will get less for the

Park speaks on influence operation
Washington — Tongsun Park reportedly began giving
details of an alleged influence-buying operation to the
House ethics committee yesterday and some members
called it odious and ugly.
"It was a conspiracy of American businessmen, con
gressmen and Koreans to make blatantly improper pay
ments over a sustained period with U.S. taxpayers
money," Rep. Bruce Caputo (R-N.Y.) said. The details
are revolting." Rep. Millicent Fenwick (R-N.J.) said, the
whole thing is ugly."
She and Caputo refused, because of the committee s
secrecy rules, to reveal any of Park's testimony but said
he gave new details on payments already disclosed pub
licly.
Experts investigate plane crash
Los Angeles — Federal investigators determined in
their first day of examining Wednesday's crash of a Con
tinental Air Lines' DC-10 that the plane should have been
able to stop in the remaining 5000 feet of runway availa
ble.
About 100 experts, separated into specialty teams,
sifted through the burned wreckage of the crash that left
two persons dead and injured 85 others.
One of the few determinations investigators were able
to make yesterday was that the two victims probably
died of smoke inhalation, rather than from burns as
previously thought, said James King, a member of the
National Transportation Safety Board. Both victims were
found on the ground on the right side of the plane after
they apparently were incapacitated by falling from an
exit.
Senators accused of delaying debate
Washington — Vice President Walter Mondale ac
cused opponents of the Panama Canal treaties yesterday
of delaying the Senate debate and said the tactic would
undermine their cause.
But he stopped short of calling it a "filibuster," and
said any move to cut off the debate at this time would be
"a harsh remedy" and "premature."
Mondale voiced his opinion as the Senate turned
down another move by treaty foes aimed at keeping U.S.
military forces in Panama after the year 2000. The Senate
later rejected two other opposition-backed amend
ments.
Emerging from a meeting with Majority Leader Robert
Byrd (D-W.Va.), Mondale said it was time to get the
debate — now in its 13th day — off dead center.
Cubans man African front lines
Ethiopia confirmed for the first time yesterday that
Cuban troops are manning front lines alongside Ethio
pians in the African country's war against secessionist
rebels. A rebel leader claimed Cuban paratroopers and
women tank crew members have been dropped into the

battle zone.
Guerrillas fighting in southernmost Ethiopia, mean
while, reported killing two Cuban officers. If the report
is true, it represents the farthest that Havana's troops
have ranged southward in the war.
UMW urged to accept contract
On the eve of the first balloting to ratify a contract that
could end the 87-day-old coal strike, United Mine
Workers President Arnold Miller went to West Virginia
coal country yesterday, and warned that rejection could

Chaplin's body stolen from grave
Corsier Sur Vevey, Switzerland — Crave robbers acting
under cover of darkness stole the body of comedian Charlie
Chaplin, who died Christmas Day, from a tiny unguarded
cemetery in this village where he spent his last 20 years,

Washington — President Jimmy Carter has been host
to White House conferences on children and youth, on

White House Conference on Etiquette in Singles Bars.
Carter was responding to a tongue-in-cheek question
prompted by a recent incident in a singles bar involving
his chief aide, Hamilton Jordan. The story, denied by the
White House, was that Jordan spat his amaretto and
cream drink at a woman after an argument.
"Any truth to the rumor you are planning a White
House Conference on Etiquette in Singles Bars?" asked
Frank Aukofer, president of the National Press Club
where the press conference was held.
"This is a matter that had not previously come to my
attention," Carter responded.

are likely to cost more in the United States.
It also means Americans overseas will get less for the
dollars they spend.
Park speaks on influence operation
Washington — Tongsun Park reportedly began giving
details of an alleged influence-buying operation to the
House ethics committee yesterday and some members
called it odious and ugly.
"It was a conspiracy of American businessmen, con
gressmen and Koreans to make blatantly improper pay
ments over a sustained period with U.S. taxpayers
money," Rep. Bruce Caputo (R-N.Y.) said. The details
are revolting." Rep. Millicent Fenwick (R-N.J.) said, the
whole thing is ugly."
She and Caputo refused, because of the committee s
secrecy rules, to reveal any of Park's testimony but said
he gave new details on payments already disclosed pub
licly.
Experts investigate plane crash
Los Angeles — Federal investigators determined in
their first day of examining Wednesday's crash of a Con
tinental Air Lines' DC-10 that the plane should have been
able to stop in the remaining 5000 feet of runway availa
ble.
About 100 experts, separated into specialty teams,
sifted through the burned wreckage of the crash that left
two persons dead and injured 85 others.
One of the few determinations investigators were able
to make yesterday was that the two victims probably
died of smoke inhalation, rather than from burns as
previously thought, said James King, a member of the
National Transportation Safety Board. Both victims were
found on the ground on the right side of the plane after
they apparently were incapacitated by falling from an
exit.
Senators accused of delaying debate
Washington — Vice President Walter Mondale ac
cused opponents of the Panama Canal treaties yesterday
of delaying the Senate debate and said the tactic would
undermine their cause.
But he stopped short of calling it a "filibuster," and
said any move to cut off the debate at this time would be
"a harsh remedy" and "premature."
Mondale voiced his opinion as the Senate turned
down another move by treaty foes aimed at keeping U.S.
military forces in Panama after the year 2000. The Senate
later rejected two other opposition-backed amend
ments.
Emerging from a meeting with Majority Leader Robert
Byrd (D-W.Va.), Mondale said it was time to get the
debate — now in its 13th day — off dead center.
Cubans man African front lines
Ethiopia confirmed for the first time yesterday that
Cuban troops are manning front lines alongside Ethio
pians in the African country's war against secessionist
rebels. A rebel leader claimed Cuban paratroopers and
women tank crew members have been dropped into the

battle zone.
Guerrillas fighting in southernmost Ethiopia, mean
while, reported killing two Cuban officers. If the report
is true, it represents the farthest that Havana's troops
have ranged southward in the war.
UMW urged to accept contract
On the eve of the first balloting to ratify a contract that
could end the 87-day-old coal strike, United Mine
Workers President Arnold Miller went to West Virginia
coal country yesterday, and warned that rejection could

In Washington President Jimmy Carter urged the min
ers to accept the proposed contract.
Most rank-and-file miners vote on the pact this
weekend, but some locals vote today, others as late as
Monday.

thur Burns as the nation's central banker is expected in

Chaplin's body stolen from grave
Corsier Sur Vevey, Switzerland — Crave robbers acting
under cover of darkness stole the body of comedian Charlie
Chaplin, who died Christmas Day, from a tiny unguarded
cemetery in this village where he spent his last 20 years,
police said yesterday.
Police said the heavy wooden coffin was removed
between nightfall Wednesday and dawn yesterday. They
said there was no indication whether it was taken for
ransom. A Corsier municipal official called the theft an
"act of vandalism."
Carter denies 'etiquette conference'
Washington — President Jimmy Carter has been host
to White House conferences on children and youth, on
the handicapped, and on Balanced National Growth and
Economic Development. But he says he is not planning a
White House Conference on Etiquette in Singles Bars.
Carter was responding to a tongue-in-cheek question
prompted by a recent incident in a singles bar involving
his chief aide, Hamilton Jordan. The story, denied by the
White House, was that Jordan spat his amaretto and
cream drink at a woman after an argument.
"Any truth to the rumor you are planning a White
House Conference on Etiquette in Singles Bars?" asked
Frank Aukofer, president of the National Press Club
where the press conference was held.
"This is a matter that had not previously come to my
attention," Carter responded.

Carter tries to support dollar
Washington — President Jimmy Carter tried to prop up
the crashing dollar yesterday by touting investments in
the United States, promising less consumption of
foreign oil and predicting that U.S. trading partners will
be able to buy more American goods.
He pledged to take direct action to support the dollar
if necessary but said it would stabilize and "remain in
good shape" without help once European money mar
kets weigh his statements and start realizing the dollar s
actual worth.
The president spoke at a news conference as the dol
lar encountered renewed pressure after plunging to a
record low on foreign exchanges. The drop means im
ported products such as automobiles and television sets
are likely to cost more in the United States.
It also means Americans overseas will get less for the
dollars they spend.
