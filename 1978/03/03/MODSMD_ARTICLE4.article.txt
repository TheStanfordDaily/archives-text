### Mike Charlson 
Hoping for a $161,000 surplus,
University administrators yesterday
unveiled proposals for next year's
operating budget totaling nearly
$118.7 million.
In a presentation to student lead
ers and later to the Faculty Senate,
guidelines for the recommended 9
per cent budget hike were discus
sed. The proposals are scheduled for
the Board of Trustees' consideration
at its meeting March 13 and 14.
While predicting a surplus next
year, the published guidelines in
clude long-range forecast assump
tions placing the 1979-80 budget as
much as $617,000 in the red.
Consideration of a variety of com
plex factors and trends went into de
velopment of the guidelines, accord
ing to the publication.
No BAP, BEP
Vice Provost for Budget and Plan
ning Raymond Bacchetti said the
budget must be considered histori
cally because it is the first budget in
recent years which has not involved
the Budget Adjustment Program
(BAP) or Budget Equilibrium Prog
rams (BEP).

Together, BAPand BEPclosedasl6
million gap between outlays and in
come at the University through over
$10 million in budget cuts and $6 mill
ion in improved income.
During the past eight years, Bac
chetti said, the University spent $5 or
$6 million from reserve funds to ba
lance its budget. Budget surpluses
this year and next will go back into
the reserve, but will not fully re
plenish the fund, he added.
As in the past, tuition will account
for just over 50 per cent of the
budget's income. In December, the
Board of Trustees approved a 9.3 per
cent general tuition hike for next fall,
bringing the three-quarter tuition
level to $5130.
Other income
Other income will come from gifts
and giants, indirect costs reim
bursement for research, endowment
income and special funds.
The proposed budget provides for

faculty salary increases averaging 7
percentwith up tol percent morein
some areas. Staff salaries would rise
an average 7.8 per cent. The pro
jected inflation rate for the year is 6
per cent.
According to Assoc. Vice President
for Business and Finance Kent Peter
son, salary levels are designed to
"stay competitive" with other institu
tions and private industry.
He said salaries are also generally
equalized internally so that a secret
ary at the Medical Center makes the
same as a secretary in the Business
Office. He said merit increases are
also given.
329 more employees
Neither Peterson nor Bacchetti
could predict whether a significant
increase in non-teaching employees
will be seen next year. In the past
year, some 329 employees have been
added to the payrolls â€” primarily in
