# 9 per cent hike proposed for 1978-79 budget
## 
### Mike Charlson 
Hoping for a $161,000 surplus,
University administrators yesterday
unveiled proposals for next year's
operating budget totaling nearly
$118.7 million.
In a presentation to student lead
ers and later to the Faculty Senate,
guidelines for the recommended 9
per cent budget hike were discus
sed. The proposals are scheduled for
the Board of Trustees' consideration
at its meeting March 13 and 14.
While predicting a surplus next
year, the published guidelines in
clude long-range forecast assump
tions placing the 1979-80 budget as
much as $617,000 in the red.
Consideration of a variety of com
plex factors and trends went into de
velopment of the guidelines, accord
ing to the publication.
No BAP, BEP
Vice Provost for Budget and Plan
ning Raymond Bacchetti said the
budget must be considered histori
cally because it is the first budget in
recent years which has not involved
the Budget Adjustment Program
(BAP) or Budget Equilibrium Prog
rams (BEP).

Together, BAPand BEPclosedasl6
million gap between outlays and in
come at the University through over
$10 million in budget cuts and $6 mill
ion in improved income.
During the past eight years, Bac
chetti said, the University spent $5 or
$6 million from reserve funds to ba
lance its budget. Budget surpluses
this year and next will go back into
the reserve, but will not fully re
plenish the fund, he added.
As in the past, tuition will account
for just over 50 per cent of the
budget's income. In December, the
Board of Trustees approved a 9.3 per
cent general tuition hike for next fall,
bringing the three-quarter tuition
level to $5130.
Other income
Other income will come from gifts
and giants, indirect costs reim
bursement for research, endowment
income and special funds.
The proposed budget provides for

faculty salary increases averaging 7
percentwith up tol percent morein
some areas. Staff salaries would rise
an average 7.8 per cent. The pro
jected inflation rate for the year is 6
per cent.
According to Assoc. Vice President
for Business and Finance Kent Peter
son, salary levels are designed to
"stay competitive" with other institu
tions and private industry.
He said salaries are also generally
equalized internally so that a secret
ary at the Medical Center makes the
same as a secretary in the Business
Office. He said merit increases are
also given.
329 more employees
Neither Peterson nor Bacchetti
could predict whether a significant
increase in non-teaching employees
will be seen next year. In the past
year, some 329 employees have been
added to the payrolls — primarily in
administration, institutes and re
search labs as well as the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center.
Bacchetti said the large jump in the
number of employees this year was
partially the result of "overcutting
during BEP." He said another factor
includes government regulations
which require more people to im
plement.
Bacchetti said his studies show that
over the past 10 years, when com
pared to personal income nation
wide, the cost of sending a student to
college "is not taking a larger frac
tion" of people's money.
But he said that over the past five
years, tuition has been increasing
faster and that the University is mov
ing to reduce the rate of tuition in
creases.
"It is our intention to bringthe rate
of tuition increase . . . down to the
level of income increases," Bacchetti
said.
Self-help to rise
According to the guidelines, stu
dent aid programs will receive 10.7
per cent more University funds than
last year, but Bacchetti said the self
help expectation, presently at $1750,
will probably rise to $1900.
Director of Financial Aids Robert
Huff said the idea is that during a
student's four years here, students
on full financial aid will pay for about
25 per cent of their education.
He said student payments are usu
ally split, 15 per cent for an on
campus job and 10 percent for loans.
But Huff said students who work
during the summer often make more
money than is required, giving them
some flexibility in fulfilling their
self-help requirement.
Conformance required
Huff admitted that the students'
personal expense budget of $700 per
year (not including travel) may be
low, but he said that because the
University often includes federal
money or loan guarantees in student
financial aid packages, it is required
to conform with the national per
sonal expense standard.
He said the $700 standard will con
tinue next year.

pared to personal income nation
wide, the cost of sending a student to
college "is not taking a larger frac
tion" of people's money.
But he said that over the past five
years, tuition has been increasing
faster and that the University is mov
ing to reduce the rate of tuition in
creases.
"It is our intention to bringthe rate
of tuition increase . . . down to the
level of income increases," Bacchetti
said.
Self-help to rise
According to the guidelines, stu
dent aid programs will receive 10.7
per cent more University funds than
last year, but Bacchetti said the self
help expectation, presently at $1750,
will probably rise to $1900.
Director of Financial Aids Robert
Huff said the idea is that during a
student's four years here, students
on full financial aid will pay for about
25 per cent of their education.
He said student payments are usu
ally split, 15 per cent for an on
campus job and 10 percent for loans.
But Huff said students who work
during the summer often make more
money than is required, giving them
some flexibility in fulfilling their
self-help requirement.
Conformance required
Huff admitted that the students'
personal expense budget of $700 per
year (not including travel) may be
low, but he said that because the
University often includes federal
money or loan guarantees in student
financial aid packages, it is required
to conform with the national per
sonal expense standard.
He said the $700 standard will con
tinue next year.
Hoping for a $161,000 surplus,
University administrators yesterday
unveiled proposals for next year's
operating budget totaling nearly
$118.7 million.
In a presentation to student lead
ers and later to the Faculty Senate,
guidelines for the recommended 9
per cent budget hike were discus
sed. The proposals are scheduled for
the Board of Trustees' consideration
at its meeting March 13 and 14.
While predicting a surplus next
year, the published guidelines in
clude long-range forecast assump
tions placing the 1979-80 budget as
much as $617,000 in the red.
Consideration of a variety of com
plex factors and trends went into de
velopment of the guidelines, accord
ing to the publication.
No BAP, BEP
Vice Provost for Budget and Plan
ning Raymond Bacchetti said the
budget must be considered histori
cally because it is the first budget in
recent years which has not involved
the Budget Adjustment Program
(BAP) or Budget Equilibrium Prog
rams (BEP).

Together, BAPand BEPclosedasl6
million gap between outlays and in
come at the University through over
$10 million in budget cuts and $6 mill
ion in improved income.
During the past eight years, Bac
chetti said, the University spent $5 or
$6 million from reserve funds to ba
lance its budget. Budget surpluses
this year and next will go back into
the reserve, but will not fully re
plenish the fund, he added.
As in the past, tuition will account
for just over 50 per cent of the
budget's income. In December, the
Board of Trustees approved a 9.3 per
cent general tuition hike for next fall,
bringing the three-quarter tuition
level to $5130.
Other income
Other income will come from gifts
and giants, indirect costs reim
bursement for research, endowment
income and special funds.
The proposed budget provides for

faculty salary increases averaging 7
percentwith up tol percent morein
some areas. Staff salaries would rise
an average 7.8 per cent. The pro
jected inflation rate for the year is 6
per cent.
According to Assoc. Vice President
for Business and Finance Kent Peter
son, salary levels are designed to
"stay competitive" with other institu
tions and private industry.
He said salaries are also generally
equalized internally so that a secret
ary at the Medical Center makes the
same as a secretary in the Business
Office. He said merit increases are
also given.
329 more employees
Neither Peterson nor Bacchetti
could predict whether a significant
increase in non-teaching employees
will be seen next year. In the past
year, some 329 employees have been
added to the payrolls — primarily in
administration, institutes and re
search labs as well as the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center.
Bacchetti said the large jump in the
number of employees this year was
partially the result of "overcutting
during BEP." He said another factor
includes government regulations
which require more people to im
plement.
Bacchetti said his studies show that
over the past 10 years, when com
pared to personal income nation
wide, the cost of sending a student to
college "is not taking a larger frac
tion" of people's money.
