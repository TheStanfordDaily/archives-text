Despite the many forces acting to push the Uni
versity budget out of equilibrium, "we are pre
senting a balanced budget for the coming year,"
according to Provost William Miller said at the
Faculty Senate meeting yesterday.
"We hang in a delicate balance," he added.
The recommended budget totals nearly $118.7
million, a 9 per cent hike over this year's figure.
Other educational institutions are having finan
cial difficulties, Miller said, and Stanford is likely to
have similar problems.
However, he added that "we are in a better
position" than are other universities.
The difficulties include increased business ex

penses and faculty salaries, as well as certain fed
eral regulations, he said,
Stanford is better off, according to Miller, be
cause the University made some difficult financial
decisions several years ago. "We've gone through
a tough period," he added, but Stanford has prob
ably managed resources, budget and our endow
ment better than some universities.
However, outside forces can throw the Univer
sity's financial budget out of equilibrium, Miller
said.
Recently proposed federal regulations on indi
rect cost recovery may reduce federal reimburse
ments to the University by several million dollars,
he said.

Under certain federal regulations, Miller said,
the University is entitled to reimbursement on
"indirect" costs, which include maintenance ser
vices.
The government bears part of the costs of some
of these services, Miller added.
Under the new regulations, the government
may exclude more indirect costs so the University
will recover even less, he said.
Miller added that a federal appropriations
committee is also looking into the salaries re
ceived by faculty from the National Science Foun
dation to see whether they are justified.
