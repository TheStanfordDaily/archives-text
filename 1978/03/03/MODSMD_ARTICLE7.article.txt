# Self-inflicted oppression
## Third World development discussed 
### 
Third World countries must
shoulder most of the responsibil
ity for their own development,
speakers at a public symposium
sponsored by Stanford New Di
rections said last night.
Hollis Chenery, vice president
of the World Bank, and Education
Prof. Martin Carnoy differed,
however, on the best method of
development.
About 200 people listened as
Chenery, a former professor of
economics here, and Carnoy
compared views on the nature of
underdevelopment and possible
strategies to aid Third World
growth.
Gross national product per
capita has been increasing in un
derdeveloped countries over the
last 25 years, said Chenery, who
called development "a spreading
phenomenon."
Distribution of benefits
"The problem is not the inabil
ity of poor countries to grow,"
Chenery said, "the real concern
should be about the distribution
of benefits of growth."
Poverty in Third World coun
tries is not just relative to de
veloped countries, said Chenery,
but is increased by the uneven
distribution of wealth within the
countries.
While the present World Bank
system of aid favors middle
income countries, Chenery said,
even with aid, the real answer to
development lies within the un
derdeveloped country.
"It is not possible to solve either
the problem of food or energy by

transferring from the rich to the
poor," he said. "I think the area in
which advanced countries have
the most to offer and are the least
organized is in the distribution of
technology."
Developed countries
Carnoy was more critical of the
influence of developed countries
on the Third World.
"I agree that two-thirds of the
problem is in fact at home in the
Third World," said Carnoy. "It is
the local groups who are doing
the oppressing directly.
"The point is what that one
third is doing in addition, because
that one-third is playing an impor
tant part in maintaining the posi
tion of the Third World."
Capitalist countries are de
lighted with the idea of countries
developing in their own image,
said Carnoy, but capitalism is not
the answer to Third World de
velopment.
Socialism
"Let's forget capitalism," Car
noy said. "Let's talk about
socialism, because under
socialism, at least almost every
body is participating in the de
velopment."
Socialism can quickly close the
gaps between rich and poor, said
Carnoy, but human values must
be remembered to avoid hierar
chies and dictatorships.
The symposium, "The Political
Economy of Development: The
Roots of Underdevelopment and
Competing Development
Strategies," was held in Terman
Engineering Auditorium.

the symposium on the development of Third World countries field in
Terman Auditorium last night.
Third World countries must
shoulder most of the responsibil
ity for their own development,
speakers at a public symposium
sponsored by Stanford New Di
rections said last night.
Hollis Chenery, vice president
of the World Bank, and Education
Prof. Martin Carnoy differed,
however, on the best method of
development.
About 200 people listened as
Chenery, a former professor of
economics here, and Carnoy
compared views on the nature of
underdevelopment and possible
strategies to aid Third World
growth.
Gross national product per
capita has been increasing in un
derdeveloped countries over the
last 25 years, said Chenery, who
called development "a spreading
phenomenon."
Distribution of benefits
"The problem is not the inabil
ity of poor countries to grow,"
Chenery said, "the real concern
should be about the distribution
of benefits of growth."
Poverty in Third World coun
tries is not just relative to de
veloped countries, said Chenery,
but is increased by the uneven
distribution of wealth within the
countries.
While the present World Bank
system of aid favors middle
income countries, Chenery said,
even with aid, the real answer to
development lies within the un
derdeveloped country.
"It is not possible to solve either
the problem of food or energy by

transferring from the rich to the
poor," he said. "I think the area in
which advanced countries have
the most to offer and are the least
organized is in the distribution of
technology."
Developed countries
Carnoy was more critical of the
influence of developed countries
on the Third World.
"I agree that two-thirds of the
problem is in fact at home in the
Third World," said Carnoy. "It is
the local groups who are doing
the oppressing directly.
"The point is what that one
third is doing in addition, because
that one-third is playing an impor
tant part in maintaining the posi
tion of the Third World."
Capitalist countries are de
lighted with the idea of countries
developing in their own image,
said Carnoy, but capitalism is not
the answer to Third World de
velopment.
Socialism
"Let's forget capitalism," Car
noy said. "Let's talk about
socialism, because under
socialism, at least almost every
body is participating in the de
velopment."
Socialism can quickly close the
gaps between rich and poor, said
Carnoy, but human values must
be remembered to avoid hierar
chies and dictatorships.
