Some recent incidents have
led us to believe that a state
ment of the Daily's news pol
icy and philosophy is in order.
Our main purpose, as with
any newspaper, is to keep you
informed of events in our
community â€” good or bad.
Our readers have.a right to
know what happens on this
campus and a right to expect
that we give them that infor
mation.
We have been criticized for
reporting certain events some
would prefer be kept quiet
and out of our pages. It is our
belief, however, that accurate
and objective reporting of all
questionable activities will
help make this campus a bet
ter place. Only informed citi
zens can correct problems
and make positive decisions
affecting their lives.
It is only with your coopera
tion that we can serve our
purpose. Many story ideas
crossing our desk never make
it into the paper. This is often
because we find them to be
untrue and unsubstantiated.
But just as often it is because
people refuse to speak with us
or one of our reporters. Their
unwillingness to talk is the
reason why many possibly
important stories are not read
by you in the morning.
Reluctance to speak with
the press is understandable if
you would feel threatened by
honestly answering ques
tions. But some people refuse
to give much needed informa
tion because they believe the
Daily has no right to become
involved in the situation. By
saying this, they also mean
that the public has no right to

know. This perverse analysis
of the role of the media is
common both to students, fa
culty and administration here.
Fortunately, it is the exception
rather than the rule in all these
groups.
A much more serious oc
curence is the giving of false
information. This false infor
mation will unfortunately, but
undoubtedly, be published
occasionally, and at
everyone's loss. If you do not
wish to speak with us, tell us
you have "no comment." And
if you do wish to speak with
us, be honest and unafraid to
say "I don't know" to any
question asked.
Another important point on
this subject: Our questions
don't always aim for publica
tion. Hard questions have to
be asked sometimes. Keep in
mind that we are not trying to
backstab anyone; we simply
want the facts.
Once the Daily has the
slightest hint of a problem,
our reporters will follow it up
to the best of their ability.
As a campus newspaper,
the Daily has two important
functions: first, as an informa
tional source and secondly, as
a learning process for our stu
dent staffers. Many of our cur
rent reporters are new to the
business and some are writing
their first newspaper article.
We cannot promise perfec
tion all the time (who can?),
but it is our goal to teach ob
jectivity, good writing and ac
curacy to these staffers.
Like you, we learn from our
mistakes. We believe we do a
good job of preventing our er
rors from reaching you, and

correcting those that do.
We can always use new re
porters, too. If you believe
after reading a story, "I could
have written that better," give
us a call. We'll put you to
work.
We encourage any living
group, service organization or
other type of group to give us
ample notice when you have
an important event worthy of
mention. We do not have the
resources to keep in touch
with everyone on campus, so
you can help by keeping us
informed.
It's a two-way street. We will
try to keep you informed and
you have to keep us informed.
We ask for a little understand
ing for our imperfections and
fairness in our dealings with
you.
Feel free to call us at 497-
4632 or stop by our office ac
ross from Terman. You will
find us in our office from 1 to
10 p.m., Sunday through
Thursday. With your help we
can better serve the Stanford
community
