# Plan urban development now
## 
### 
Forecasts predict an increase of
another ten million people in the Un
ited States within twenty years.
Where are all those people going to
live? Ten million people would be
fourteen cities the size of San Fran
cisco! Surely they will be living
somewhere, but where?
Current trends point towards habi
tation in already existing metropoli
tan areas. The Bay Area is a good
example of this trend. Before us,
urban development has blanketed
the Peninsula and buildings are still
finding their way into vacant cre
vices. It seems that development will
not stop until every plot is had, and
the destruction, overcrowding and
pollution of once a beautiful region
is complete.
Slacken congestion
This trend is happening arond
most of our large cities. It is a serious
problem. If not for aesthetic reasons,
economic ones reveal that intense
congestion has fiscal limits.
Ten years ago Congress affirmed
the necessity of twenty-six million
new units of housing to be con
structed by 1978. The U.S. is far short
of that goal and the shortage is hav
ing a harsh impact. It is a cause of the
incredible real estate inflation push
ing the average new home price to a
new high, $56,000. A price out of
reach to most.
The 1978 goal was to satisfy existing
demand, not the demand of future
numbers. The shortage is going to be
worse, particularly for our genera
tion. We are quickly being priced out
of the American Dream! Low-income
families will be the hardest hit when
the middle class out-bids them for

even their poorer quality housing.
Most people are in favor of main
taining the integrity of their home
land. But, the American Way has not
yet favored or promoted the reason
able approach to do it â€” the plan
ning and development of new cities.
It has not because city planning, un
like national highways, parks and
welfare is still considered socialistic.
We have a dilemma. Development
is necessary but no one wants it
around them. In any case it is not
happening fast enough.
It is true that there are areas which
are booming with development. This
is partially because of the population
shift from the Northeast to the South
and Southwest. Nevertheless, ur
banization there is also growing in
existing outdated infrastructures.
It is not planned nor more than
vaguely coordinated. The result will
soon be similar to the crises in the
older metro areas: political and emo
tional chaos, crowding, pollution
and less, not more enjoyment of life.
Building new towns
New cities, or rather new town and
country metropolitan areas would be
desirable in place of the growing
American urban sprawl. They would
be areas whose infrastructure would
be design from the start to anticipate
the forthcoming growth.
Once population size was agreed
upon, land for living, working, farm
ing and playing would be coordi
nated into rational patterns accessi
ble to social and city services like
health care and transportation.
After the framework is layed out
and capital attracted, the private sec
tor would be free to build spontane-

ously within it. New land would be
cheaper to develop for housing and
industry in general. This cost cut
could help deflate the selling price of
both housing and commodities with
multiple benefits for everyone.
Our nation has plenty of land and
the amount I imagine for new town
and country developments would
not be great. The best countryside
would not be used. People are be
coming less satisfied with the know
ledge of vacant open space a
hundred miles away from them. They
miss the once open space around
them now filled with concrete. De
velopment will come anyway. It
should be guilded reasonably.
