# Christians stereotyped

Demetrakakes' article (Christians
Threaten to Control U.S.) is charac
terized by stereotype, generalization
and pre-eminently — paranoia.
Demetrakakes ignores the plural
ity of religious and political views
held by American Christians, who
follow the belief systems of count
less divergent denominations, some
of which do not even recognize any
of the others to be Christians.
To identify all Christians with
Bryant's beliefs, or even her Baptist
church's beliefs, is one of the many
examples of Demetrqkakes love of
stereotype. He also ignores the out
spoken clergy and laypeople who
have already come out as gays, or
supporting the rights of gays.
The fact that several major de
nominations, including United Pre
sbyterian, Unitarian, and Quaker,
have come out with increasingly
positive positions on homosexuality
and other social issues (note the
World Council of Churches' stand on
divestment from South Africa) shows
that homophobia does not have an
indisputable basis in Christianity.
I personally believe that jesus'
teachings had little to do with
whether homo- or heterosexuality,
or Capitalism or communism, are
right" or wrong." jesus did not
spend his time defining exactly what
is right or wrong; His message was
love for one's neighbor and forgive
ness of sin. Jewish law had already
defined sin adequately.
Jesus himself associated with pros
titutes, adulterers, fax collectors
(similar in code of ethics to CIA
agents) and many other socially
rejected sinners." He also in
veighed against the moralizing
middle-class jewish movement of
the time — the Pharisees.
I believe that if Jesus were here
today he would probably condemn
Anita Bryant for her own hypocrisy.
As far as I'm concerned, Anita Bryant
is an embarrassment to, not a rep
resentative of, Christians.
Stereotypes bleed paranois
I do not deny that some of the most
vicious anti-gay people use their in
terpretation of the Bible as the
rationale for their anti-gay beliefs.
But their paranoia of gays stems as
much from their stereotyped idea of
what gays are like (child-molesters,
promiscuous, subversive, etc.) as

from the obscure references to
homosexuality in the New Testament
(which are not Jesus' words, but
Paul's, who never heard |esus speak,
and wrote after His death). Demet
rakakes would do well to note that he
is an equally avoid partaker of
stereotype, generalization and
paranoia.
The only non-stereotypical point
which I found in the article was that
any Christian policymaker must
fight a constant battle between his
sense of fairness to those who do not
share his superstition and what he
thinks is his obligation to Jesus
Christ." This is true, for the Christ
ians who take their religious beliefs
seriously.
But, I believe that any policymaker
faces the same dilemma — whether
to follow her/his belief system or
merely to reflect the views of his/her
constituency. Everyone holds be
liefs, whether they consider them

selves religious or not.
Demetrakakes would not have
dared to diatribe against blacks, or
jews, orgays, or women, in the same
style. It may not yet be fashionable to
talk about prejudice against Christ
ians (in fact there isn't even a term for
it yet — e.g. sexism, racism,
homophobia, anti-Semitic) but if this
modern day Nero had his way, Chris
tians would have to crawl back into
the catacombs, or practice lion
evasion techniques.
And I am justas personally violated
by being characterized as politically
conservative, power-hungry, and
homophobic because I am a Christ
ian as I am when I am assumed to be
less intelligent, over-emotional or
incompetent because I am a woman.
Why doesn't Demetrakakes recog
nize the right of all people to be indi
viduals?
