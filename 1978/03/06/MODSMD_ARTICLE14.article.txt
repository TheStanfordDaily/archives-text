# Cards close with cliffhanger, but this time get the win
## Stanford survives Cal rally, 86-85; Carter scores 20 points, grabs 11 rebounds in finale

Berkeley — Really, could any
thing else have been more ap
propriate?
When two teams which had
seen their Pacific-8 seasons
ruined by narrow losses got to
gether Saturday night in Cal's
Harmon Gym for the season
finale, it seemed fitting the
game be decided by one point
as Stanford hung on for an
86-85 win over the Bears.
And though both teams were
assured of the two bottom slots
in the Pac-8 regardless of the
outcome — Stanford in eighth
and Cal in seventh — until Cal
forward Doug True's 18-footer
with two seconds left bounced
off the front of the rim, they
went at each other as though a
post-season bid was on the
line.
"Both teams were emotion
ally ready," said Stanford

coach Dick Dißiaso, "espe
cially for teams going
nowhere."
But the Cards' emotion —
and execution — got them a lot
further than Cal during the first
half. The Cards appeared to
have the game safely in hand at
intermission, up 51-34 after
outscoring the Bears 29-12 in
the last 10 minutes of the half.
"The key in the first half was
after we got behind 8-0, we
controlled the boards," said
Dißiaso.
Stanford had plenty of op
portunities for rebounds, since
Cal made only 13 of its 38 field
goal attempts in the first half.
Meanwhile, Stanford got
some good shooting from
guard Paul Giovacchini, who
nailed three of five bombs, and
forward Jay Carter, who sank
12 points in the first half and
finished as the Cards' top
scorer in the game with 20
points and also collected 11 re
bounds.
But the seemingly safe 17-
point advantage dissolved to a
mere six-point lead in the first
five minutes of the second half.
Senior forward Doug Vilotti,
who scored a career- and
game-high 25 points, and
guard Gene Ransom, who
finished with 20 points, com
bined for a dozen as the Bears
closed within 57-51.
Then in a rebounding scuffle
under the basket, the Cards'
Kimberly Belton went down
with an ankle injury that kept

him out of the remainder of the
game.
A goal-tending call against
Carter after Ransom had stolen
the ball and gone the length of
the court for a lay-in attempt
put the Bears in front 65-64,
and began a series of four lead
changes before the Bears pul
led out to a 77-72 margin with
six minutes to play.
"It was a great effort, a great
comeback," said Cal coach
Dick Edwards, whose six-year
stint with the Bears probably
ended with the game. His job
security has been in question
throughout the Bears' disap
pointing 4-10 Pac-8 season
(11-16 overall), and a source at

Cal said he is on his way out.
But the comebacks weren't
over yet. The Cards scored 11
unanswered points to go up
83-77 with 3:40 to play.
McHugh's basket was the
Cards' final field goal attempt
of the game. Stanford ran
down the clock whenever it got
the ball for the rest of the
game.
Giovacchini sank one of two
with 35 seconds left and Wolfe
Perry canned both of his with
18 seconds, but then Giovac
chini missed the front end of a
one-and-one with five seconds
left. Meanwhile, the Bears had
gotten four field goals to pull

within one point.
On the in-bounds play, Cal
whipped the ball the length of
the floor to center Tom
Schneiderjohn, who tipped it
over to True. His shot hit the
rim and bounced away.
"Once they throw the ball in,
anything can happen," said
Dißiaso. "The shot just as eas
ily could have gone in. The
great hoop god in the sky fi
nally looked out for us."
