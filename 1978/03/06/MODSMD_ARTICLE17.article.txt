Baseball: rained out. Track:
rained out.
But the ruggers reigned on!
Stanford's rugby match
against Hastings Saturday
looked like it was going to be
an unpleasant affair. But as the
Cards pulled ahead, they be
came increasingly positive and
the rain didn't hinder them that
much. With the mud, sweat,
blood and even some dog
fights there was rousing enter
tainment all the way to the end.
All three Stanford teams swam

home to victory, 12-0, 39-6 and
18-0, respectively.
Under the heavy downpour,
Stanford I and Hastings I had
trouble holding onto the ball
and the muddy field made
running next to impossible.
The game became one of kick
ing with Stanford ruling the
turf.
The cohesion of the backline
enabled Rich Roux to complete
Stanford's first try. The conver
sion was missed. Mike Thur
man added a try to make the

score 8-0 at half.
During the second half the
rain let up but Stanford did not.
The last score of the game
came when Carl Edwards
churned off a maul and pow
ered to the goal.
Gordy Riegel threatened to
add another try but Hastings
denied him entry at the goal.
Hastings was defeated by the
It's stunning performance as
Nick Josten, Art Laos and Jeff
Morris produced tryes.
Neil Beaton led the scrum for
Stanford 111 while Chris San
ders and Lucien Rouse scored
the tryes.
The women's team played a
good offensive game against
the San Francisco Rugby Club,
but could not stave off the de
termined assaults of the oppo
nents' backs. Stanford lost, 8-0.
The ruggers' schedule in the
next few weeks is a busy one.
They meet Berkeley Satur
day, then go to the Monterey
Tournament March 25. They'll
be in Canada over the spring
break to conclude the season.
