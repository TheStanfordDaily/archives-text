# Survey of faculty shows 87% for Western Culture

Faculty members favor some form of a Western Cul
ture requirement by almost seven to one, according to a
recent survey sponsored by the Western Culture Task
Force. The faculty is sharply divided, however, over the
manner in which the requirement should be instituted.
The survey, answered by 198 faculty members in the
Humanities and Sciences, Earth Sciences and Engineer
ing schools, shows 40 per cent of the respondents in
favor of offering a set of options to satisfy the require
ment; 31.8 per cent, however, favor requiring a single
course in Western culture for all undergraduates.
The results will be used by the task force in formulat
ing the final proposal it will present tothe Committee on
Undergraduate Studies this Wednesdav, according to
English Associate Prof. Ronald Rebholz, chairman of the
task force.
Seminars or lectures?
The questionnaire also shows that the faculty is di
vided on the comparative merit of small seminars and
large lectures as the way of teaching courses in Western
Culture. Of the respondents, 28.4 per cent said students
should be introduced to Western Culture by the best
lecturers the University can offer, with discussion sec
tions led by graduate teaching assistants. Another 47.9
per cent, however, said that seminar groups led by in
structors with Ph.D.s, or lectures in addition to these
seminars, are necessary.
For a Western Culture course or courses, the faculty
favored using ' great books," such as classics in
philosophy, literature and history, secondary texts pro
viding historical continuity and works other than books
that illustrate the development of Western Culture,
drawn from the arts, technology and the history of sci
ence.
The great majority of faculty surveyed also felt that the
course or courses should include material from the his
tory of science and technology as well as from
humanities and social sciences.

According to the task force, there is "a trade-off bet
ween the advantages of 'surveying' Western Culture and
learning about it through deeper exposure to a few
works or periods." Twice as many faculty members fa
vored an extensive survey course as favored an intensive
course studying a few works or periods.
Nearly half of the respondents said that "it is impor
tant for educated persons to be familiar with their own
culture before they attempt to understand another,"
and "Western Culture" is a sufficiently broad term as to
be part of the "intellectual heritage of all Stanford stu
dents." Another third of the faculty felt that a good deal
of material should be drawn from non-Western culture
in the teaching of the course or courses.
Limited choice
Because students in highly structured majors may find
their opportunities for choices in their programs further
reduced by the new requirement, a majority of faculty
members said that the whole set of requirements should
be reassessed to make sure it works together in an edu
cationally sound way. Only 27.3 percent felt that courses
in Western Culture should be designed to fill existing
distribution requirements in the humanities or the social
sciences, rather than becoming an added requirement.
Faculty in the Engineering School more often favored
this than faculty in the Humanities and Sciences School.
Rebholz said that "it is significant that over 70 per cent
of the faculty favor no more than five alternatives if
students are given a choice among several different ways
of satisfying the requirement."
According to Rebholz, it is "encouraging" that only
35.4 per cent of the faculty would be unwilling to take
part in a single required course in Western culture under
any circumstances. Almost one-fourth of the respon
dents would be interested in taking an active part in
teaching a Western Culture seminar either regularly or
once every three or four years.
About 17 per cent of the responding faculty would
consider teaching if the requirement was structured
along different lines than was originally proposed.
