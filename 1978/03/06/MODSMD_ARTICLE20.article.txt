San Jose — Stanford is sending two gym
nasts to the Region 8 Championships after
finishing second in the Northern Califor
nia Athletic Conference — a considerable
achievement for the first year of varsity
competition in women's gymnastics.
Stanford, with a team score of 104.55,
finished second to San Jose State in Friday
night's conference championships. The
Spartans compiled 131.70 points to qualify
the team for regional competition. Fresno
State and California finished with 99.65
and 68.90 scores.
Dana Padden was the top performer for
the Cardinals, qualifying for the regional
meet in vaulting with an 8.55 score, good
for second place. Padden also placed fifth
in all-around competition with a 27.40 total
in the four events. Cindy Sedlund placed
seventh, scoring 26.15.
Saundra Muramatsu is Stanford's other

hopeful in this Friday's post-season meet
in San Diego. Unable to perform in the last
two meets because of ankle and knee in
juries, she was petitioned into the meet by
coach Jackie Walker. Muramatsu scored
above the 8.5 qualifying standard during
previous meets in all events, so the peti
tion was approved.
The Spartans dominated last Friday's
meet, taking 13 of the top 16places and the
top four all-around spots. They were led
by sophomore Kris Klepfer, who won all
four events and the all-around title with a
55.20 total.
Other top gymnasts for San Jose in
cluded Cathy Santa Lucia with 32.60, Cayle
Yost with 32.45, and Lorie Olsen with 29.60
in the all-around competition.
The Stanford women's performance
pleased Walker. "I'm really proud of the
girls," she said. "They showed a lot of
poise, but didn't perform quite as well as

they did against Long Beach. Overall, it
was the second best meet of the year."
According to Walker, Jackie Eaby did her
best beam routine of her career, Sedlund
performed her best bar routine, and Linda
Park did a good job overall. I was really
excited for Dana," Walker added.
The conference meet marked the last
appearance by Eaby, who is retiring
primarily becauseof a recurrent injury. Re
flecting on the meet, she explained it was a
good conclusion of her career with suc
cessful performances by both the team
and herself. She was especially pleased
with the team representation in the reg
ional and the progress shown during the
season.
Padden, Muramatsu and-Walker will fly
to San Diego Thursday morning. Prelimi
nary competition begins at San Diego
State University Friday night, and finals are
held Saturday night.
