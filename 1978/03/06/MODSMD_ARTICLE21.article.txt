Friday the Stanford men's volleyball team traveled to Harmon
Gym to face the California Golden Bears, but the results were not
encouraging. The Cards fell to Cal 7-15, 15-10, 14-16, 15-3 and
9-15. Card coach Art Lambert was not pleased with the five-game
loss. "We had them on the ropes and let them off," he said.
Cal was able to run off long strings of points on Stanford's
defense. In the third game, for example, the Cards led 9-3 and
14-10, but eventually lost 14-16. Lambert said, "We got stuck in
bad rotations and were unable to get out of them as we were
falling apart on defense."
Another problem was Stanford's inability to take advantage of
free balls. "We were unable to put the easy shots back with any
force and often returned free balls as free balls."
Lambert said he was disappointed with the loss, but he said he
remains optimistic about the rest of the season. "I'm not the type
of person who is positive for the sake of being positive, but this
team has a real chance to do something and it will be going
places. Our passing is getting better, much more consistent, and
Dave Saeta is doing a great job as our single setter. He seems to be
getting better as the season progresses."
Lambert is still concerned about the Cards' inexperience. "We
have come a long way," he said. Our major problem was that we
didn't have a chance to work out in the fall as did other teams, so
we are now playing like they were in January."
Since Cal is not in Stanford's division of the Northern California
Athletic Conference, the Cards remain 5-0 in division play.
