Hua re-elected China's premier
Tokyo — China's parliament re-elected Communist
Chairman Hua Kuo-feng as premier yesterday, solidify
ing his hold at the top of the Peking hierarchy as both
political and administrative leader of the world's most
populous nation.
Hua apparently outmaneuvered Vice Premier Teng
Hsiao-ping for the job as head of government, proving
himself a wily and successful political in-fighter. In the
process he has established himself as successor to both
Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai.
Peking's Great Hall of the People rang with cheers
and there was a prolonged ovation" after Hua was cho
sen premier at the closing session of the fifth national
People's Congress, the official news agency Hsinhua
reported.
But Teng did not come away empty-handed. He and
his old-guard military revolutionary allies put two of
their men into key positions.
California voters face tax choice
Sacramento — California voters face what looks like a
pleasant choice June 6: whether to cut property taxes 30
per cent for homeowners or 55 per cent for all property
owners.
How the votes are tallied for the rival measures on the
state ballot will represent much more than how Califor
nians feel about who should get how much of a property
tax cut.
The underlying issues are the roles of government,
business and the taxing system, and the credibility of the
state's political leadership, including Gov. ]erry Brown.
Proponents of the across-the-board tax cut in Califor
nia base their campaign in large part on attacks on gov
ernment — a populist message that has been well re
ceived in early opinion polls.
No charges yet in sex slaying cases
Tallahassee, Fla. — The FBI says Theodore Bundy was
wanted for questioning in 36 sex slayings. Arrested 10
days after he was placed on the FBl's most wanted list,
Bundy has not been charged with any new slayings.
Some investigators say he may never be.
Bundy, who escaped from a Colorado jail in De
cember while awaiting a first-degree murder trial for
allegedly killing a nurse, has been charged here with
stealing four vehicles and using stolen credit cards. He
was arrested while allegedly driving a stolen car in Pen
sacola on Feb. 15.
The FBI says he is wanted for questioning in 36 slayings
during the past five years in Oregon, Utah, Washington,
Colorado and California.
But some local investigators say that although Bundy is
a strong suspect in their homocides,,they lack concrete
evidence against him.
CIA 'wanted' press analysis program
Des Moines, lowa — A Des Moines computer firm
president met twice with the Central Intelligence
Agency to discuss selling a computer program to the
agency, possibly to analyze news stories or the reporters

who produced them, The Des Moines Sunday Register
reported.
The Register quoted a well-placed source" as saying
the CIA wanted to use GMl's "Quester" computer prog
ram to analyze stories produced by The Associated Press
and United Press International.
Dr. Charles Cleveland, a Drake University professor
and president of GMI, Ltd., said he wasn't sure his com
puter program could analyze news copy because "we've
never tried it,"and added that "we certainly don't in
tend to try it."
The CIA would not immediately comment on the
story.
The newspaper described the "Quester" program as a
sophisticated plan for drawing personality profiles.
Unusual weather patterns continue
Flooding from torrential rains of a Pacific storm con
tinued in Arizona late yesterday as California dug out
from mudslides and in the eastern half of the nation
dozens of low temperature records were broken over
night and during the day.
In California, where an unusual tornado watch was
called yesterday afternoon after the sighting of several
funnel clouds in the Los Angeles area, the bodies of five
persons killed in the flooding and mudslides had been
recovered.
In northwestern Arizona, National Guard troops and
Army helicopters airlifted supplies to families stranded
by earlier rain on the Navajo Reservation.
The downpour forced the Arizona Canal over its banks
in northern Phoenix and four to five inches of water
flooded city streets.
In southern California where 3.29 inches of rain had
fallen by yesterday morning, numerous roads including
highways were blocked by mudslides, which also
pushed houses off foundations and left tons of debris
behind.
Ethiopian conflict test for Carter
Ethiopia claimed yesterday its forces recaptured the
strategic town of Jijiga from Somali-backed secessionist
rebels in the embattled Ogaden desert. The Somalis
denied the report and claimed that Soviet troops had
joined Cuban units in the attack on the town.
In Washington, Sen. Howard Baker (R-Tenn.), said he
believed the Soviet-Cuban intervention was a move by
Moscow to test the will of President jimmy Carter and it
was time for Carter to "draw the line" and make it clear
that such actions are not acceptable.
The Ethiopian Embassy in London issued a statement
saying regular forces and people's militia of Ethiopia had
entered Jijiga and were in "total control" of the area
"after a fierce battle with the Somali invading forces."
Jijiga is 60 miles west of the Ethiopian-Somalian bor
der.
