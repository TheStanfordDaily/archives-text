### Will Nixon 
"The rest of the 20th Century is not without com
peting strategies for black liberation," said mod
erator Glenn )ordan yesterday at a symposium on
black liberation.
Several of the varied approaches to black liberation
were elaborated on by speakers at the campus sym
posium.
"The central questions of our generation is who we
are and where we are going," said Edmon Boston of
the All African People's Revolutionary Party.
Stressing the question of power, Boston said that
black people are the most powerless people in the
world. He also said blackness transcends national
borders.
"African people are in fact African people; even
though they may be scattered all over the world, they
are still Africans," Boston said.
Pan-Africanism is the goal of the AAPRP and Boston
urged "the total unification and liberation of Africa
under scientific socialism."

With a united Africa, the richest continent on the
earth," Boston said he believes Africans would have
the power they now lack. Scientific socialism would
put all of the wealth-producing property in the hands
of the people.
"We are facing the problem of race in a situation of
monopoly capitalism," said lames Turner, director of
the African Studies Center at Cornell. He warned that
the declining spiral of capitalism has racist results,
pointing in particular to England as characterized by
daily clashes between the races.
James Boggs, a writer, labor organizer and self
styled revolutionary, said he has committed himself to
revolution in the United States.
"The U.S. is the last citadel of capitalism, and a
revolution here would raise humanity in the whole
world to a new dimension," Boggs said.
"Having had a period of social upheaval, we are at
the stage of building an organization to lead to the
next stage. I do not believe we are now ready for mass
action."
