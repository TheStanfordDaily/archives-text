# Hoover's Duignan on S. Africa: question of means, not ends
## 
### Joel Dickholtz 
The question of Stanford's investments in
corporations that do business in South Africa
has been thrashed about from countless
viewpoints, making headlines in newspap
ers and magazines throughout the country.
For the time being, however, the controversy
is at a virtual standstill, with all sides main
taining their ground.
This article is the first in a series which will
attempt to present an examination of the
present and future of the controversy by
looking at a number of viewpoints on cam
pus.
"I am struck by the curious type of Ameri
can ethnocentricity that prevails on so many
college campuses," said Peter Duignan, di
rector of African Studies and curator of the
African collection at the Hoover Institution.
"There is a form of inverted American
chauvinism that interprets all the world's
evils in terms of the real or supposed wrongs
committed abroad by American investors
and American spies."
Duignan has done extensive research on
the history of South Africa. He commis

sioned the recently published "From Protest
to Challenge," a four-volume study of the
resistance from 1880 to 1974. He views the
current question as one of means, not ends.
"We all want a just society to evolve in
South Africa, even though we may disagree
on the best means of achieving that end."
Duignan, who recently spoke to the
Menlo Park chapter of the World Affairs
Council, said he sees hope for the end of
South African apartheid by increasing
foreign investment in that country. Duignan
said this would cause the economy "to ex
pand so rapidly that there would be more
funds for government services for all and a
greater need for skilled workers than could
be supplied by the white population. . . .
"White trade unions would allow blacks to
enter the skilled trades, for example, if there
were more jobs than whites could handle.
This happened informally in South Africa in
recent years: blacks now dominate indus
tries that a few years ago excluded them —
garments, railroads, post office, mining,
building industries and motor repairs."
Foremost in Duignan's mind is the main

tenance of peace during the transforma
tion. "Who wants a bloody war in South
Africa? Why, after our Vietnam experience,
have we adopted a moral interventionist
stance?
A peaceful but imperfect solution is pre
ferable to trying to get a perfect solution by
violent means. . . . Quiet pressure for
change, the gradual ends of apartheid, more
education and job opportunities for blacks
and coloreds, more self-government for
urban blacks, and democracy in the home
lands — these are attainable goals."
He also said "hopes for a violent over
throw of South Africa belong in the realm of
military fantasy." He said he has seen little
past evidence of successful workers move
ments.
Duignan also questioned the presumably
great effect that withdrawal of American
corporations would have on South Africa.
"American investments in South Africa
occupy too small a place — 18 per cent of
foreign investments — in the nation's
economy to be a major bargaining counter
. . . South Africa today generates the bulk of

its own capital and even exports it.
Past restrictions on American arms sales
have not only deprived the U.S. of a market,
but have also forced South Africa to develop
a major arms industry of its own, in coopera
tion with the French."
Duignan said a U.S. trade embargo of
South Africa would be "unlikely to succeed.
What America supplies, moreover, can
be obtained from other sources, whereas
the U.S. needs South Africa's minerals."
Duignan also noted an inconsistency in
Americans only attacking South African
policies. He pointed out the need for realiz
ing that "few governments are moral or just,
or rule for the benefit of their people.
Duignan said that changes are occurring.
"There is some evidence that South Africa is
changing, is indeed offering more rights and
better conditions to its people.
"In the past month, for example, a series
of decisions by an Afrikaaner judge in Namibia
has essentially dismantled apartheid. Free
elections are scheduled there within two
months, with a clear prospect that moderate
blacks will attain a majority of offices."

Duignan said a U.S. trade embargo of
South Africa would be "unlikely to succeed.
What America supplies, moreover, can
be obtained from other sources, whereas
the U.S. needs South Africa's minerals."
Duignan also noted an inconsistency in
Americans only attacking South African
policies. He pointed out the need for realiz
ing that "few governments are moral or just,
or rule for the benefit of their people.
Duignan said that changes are occurring.
"There is some evidence that South Africa is
changing, is indeed offering more rights and
better conditions to its people.
"In the past month, for example, a series
of decisions by an Afrikaaner judge in Namibia
has essentially dismantled apartheid. Free
elections are scheduled there within two
months, with a clear prospect that moderate
blacks will attain a majority of offices."

The question of Stanford's investments in
corporations that do business in South Africa
has been thrashed about from countless
viewpoints, making headlines in newspap
ers and magazines throughout the country.
For the time being, however, the controversy
is at a virtual standstill, with all sides main
taining their ground.
This article is the first in a series which will
attempt to present an examination of the
present and future of the controversy by
looking at a number of viewpoints on cam
pus.
"I am struck by the curious type of Ameri
can ethnocentricity that prevails on so many
college campuses," said Peter Duignan, di
rector of African Studies and curator of the
African collection at the Hoover Institution.
"There is a form of inverted American
chauvinism that interprets all the world's
evils in terms of the real or supposed wrongs
committed abroad by American investors
and American spies."
Duignan has done extensive research on
the history of South Africa. He commis

sioned the recently published "From Protest
to Challenge," a four-volume study of the
resistance from 1880 to 1974. He views the
current question as one of means, not ends.
"We all want a just society to evolve in
South Africa, even though we may disagree
on the best means of achieving that end."
Duignan, who recently spoke to the
Menlo Park chapter of the World Affairs
Council, said he sees hope for the end of
South African apartheid by increasing
foreign investment in that country. Duignan
said this would cause the economy "to ex
pand so rapidly that there would be more
funds for government services for all and a
greater need for skilled workers than could
be supplied by the white population. . . .
"White trade unions would allow blacks to
enter the skilled trades, for example, if there
were more jobs than whites could handle.
This happened informally in South Africa in
recent years: blacks now dominate indus
tries that a few years ago excluded them —
garments, railroads, post office, mining,
building industries and motor repairs."
Foremost in Duignan's mind is the main

tenance of peace during the transforma
tion. "Who wants a bloody war in South
Africa? Why, after our Vietnam experience,
have we adopted a moral interventionist
stance?
A peaceful but imperfect solution is pre
ferable to trying to get a perfect solution by
violent means. . . . Quiet pressure for
change, the gradual ends of apartheid, more
education and job opportunities for blacks
and coloreds, more self-government for
urban blacks, and democracy in the home
lands — these are attainable goals."
He also said "hopes for a violent over
throw of South Africa belong in the realm of
military fantasy." He said he has seen little
past evidence of successful workers move
ments.
Duignan also questioned the presumably
great effect that withdrawal of American
corporations would have on South Africa.
"American investments in South Africa
occupy too small a place — 18 per cent of
foreign investments — in the nation's
economy to be a major bargaining counter
. . . South Africa today generates the bulk of

its own capital and even exports it.
Past restrictions on American arms sales
have not only deprived the U.S. of a market,
but have also forced South Africa to develop
a major arms industry of its own, in coopera
tion with the French."
Duignan said a U.S. trade embargo of
South Africa would be "unlikely to succeed.
What America supplies, moreover, can
be obtained from other sources, whereas
the U.S. needs South Africa's minerals."
