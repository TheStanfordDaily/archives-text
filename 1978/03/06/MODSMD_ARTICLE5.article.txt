"To discover the fundamental
problem common to all mankind,
I must ask myself what my funda
mental problem is, what my most
ineradicable fear is. I am certain,
then, to find the problems and
fears of literally everyone. That is
the true road, into my own dark
ness, to our darkness, which I try
to bring to the light of day." -
"Notes and Counternotes"

After having looked into his
eyes — at once laughing, under
standing and filled with sorrow —
one has almost no doubt that one
has encountered Eugenelonesco,
poet, philosopher, playwright
and one of the originators of what
has come to be known as the
"Theater of the Absurd."
After having talked with him,
one is certain:
"There are two types of people:
those who advance in lifeand who
imagine they understand society
and who speak and explain exis
tence; and there are others — of
whom I am one — who the more
they advance in life the less they
understand. In my opinion the ig
norant, like me, are closer to the
truth.
"Not being a man of action, I
look at what other people do. I
don't know what they are doing
but I try very hard to find out.
What men do and say — their ac
tions, talk, seem absurd."
lonesco is in this country to
show his first full-length film, "La
Vase," which means mud or

slime, and will speak today in
Memorial Auditorium after the
4:15 p.m. screening of his film.
lonesco was born in Slatina,
Rumania on Nov. 26, 1912 but
spent his early years in France. At
age 13 he returned to Rumania
and eventually took a degree in
French at the University of
Bucharest. In 1939 he returned to
France, where he has lived since.
His first play was "The Bald Sop
rano," a daring experiment in
theatrical form in which lonesco
suppressed the elements he con
sidered extraneous to the drama
tic experience — plot, realistic
stage construction, coherent
dialogue, psychologically consis
tent characters — in order to

"purify" the theater and thus bet
ter communicate the basic ex
periences of humanity, such as
loneliness, fear of death, the diffi
culty of communicating with
others, and the individual's sub
jugation to outside forces and
mechanical conformity to society.
The film being shown today,
La Vase," was originally a short
story of the same title, written in
1956. It then was made into a play,
"Ce Formidable Le Bordel," and
then a novel, "Le Solitaire."
lonesco describes it as dealing
with "the engulfment of life" and
with a "character who falls apart
morally and physically." In it, he
says,"I am the soul and principal
actor."
"To discover the fundamental
problem common to all mankind,

"Ce Formidable Le Bordel," and
then a novel, "Le Solitaire."
lonesco describes it as dealing
with "the engulfment of life" and
with a "character who falls apart
morally and physically." In it, he
says,"I am the soul and principal
actor."
"To discover the fundamental
problem common to all mankind,
I must ask myself what my funda
mental problem is, what my most
ineradicable fear is. I am certain,
then, to find the problems and
fears of literally everyone. That is
the true road, into my own dark
ness, to our darkness, which I try
to bring to the light of day." -
"Notes and Counternotes"

After having looked into his
eyes — at once laughing, under
standing and filled with sorrow —
one has almost no doubt that one
has encountered Eugenelonesco,
poet, philosopher, playwright
and one of the originators of what
has come to be known as the
"Theater of the Absurd."
After having talked with him,
one is certain:
"There are two types of people:
those who advance in lifeand who
imagine they understand society
and who speak and explain exis
tence; and there are others — of
whom I am one — who the more
they advance in life the less they
understand. In my opinion the ig
norant, like me, are closer to the
truth.
"Not being a man of action, I
look at what other people do. I
don't know what they are doing
but I try very hard to find out.
What men do and say — their ac
tions, talk, seem absurd."
lonesco is in this country to
show his first full-length film, "La
Vase," which means mud or

slime, and will speak today in
Memorial Auditorium after the
4:15 p.m. screening of his film.
lonesco was born in Slatina,
Rumania on Nov. 26, 1912 but
spent his early years in France. At
age 13 he returned to Rumania
and eventually took a degree in
French at the University of
Bucharest. In 1939 he returned to
France, where he has lived since.
His first play was "The Bald Sop
rano," a daring experiment in
theatrical form in which lonesco
suppressed the elements he con
sidered extraneous to the drama
tic experience — plot, realistic
stage construction, coherent
dialogue, psychologically consis
tent characters — in order to

"purify" the theater and thus bet
ter communicate the basic ex
periences of humanity, such as
loneliness, fear of death, the diffi
culty of communicating with
others, and the individual's sub
jugation to outside forces and
mechanical conformity to society.
The film being shown today,
La Vase," was originally a short
story of the same title, written in
1956. It then was made into a play,
"Ce Formidable Le Bordel," and
then a novel, "Le Solitaire."
lonesco describes it as dealing
with "the engulfment of life" and
with a "character who falls apart
morally and physically." In it, he
says,"I am the soul and principal
actor."
