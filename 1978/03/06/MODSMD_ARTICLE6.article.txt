# United Mine Workers torpedoes contract
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Striking miners voted over
whelmingly against a proposed contract yesterday
and President Jimmy Carter made plans to step in
swiftly to try to force miners back to work in the
90-day-old walkout.
Sources said the president was ready to invoke
the strike-halting provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act
today in preparation for seeking a back-to-work
court order within days.
White House press secretary )ody Powell told
reporters: "It's clear from the trend in the voting
that the president will have to act no later than
tomorrow."
He said the president would announce what
steps he would take after meeting with the Cabinet
and top congressional leaders today.
One official said Carter would rely on existing
law for action in the strike, thus ruling out the
possibility of immediately seeking legislation to
authorize a temporary federal seizure of the

mines. Legislation remained a future possibility,
however.
The vote count from the coalfields defied pre
dictions of a close outcome.
With 647 of the United Mine Workers' 794 locals
reporting, there were 71,025 votes against the con
tract and 31,758 in favor of it, a margin of more than
2-1. "It appears now that this contract isn't going to
make it," said William Esselstyne, UMW
secretary-treaturer.
There was no comment from the industry on the
contract rejection.
As it became clear the contract was being re
jected, administration officials began a new round
of meetings to plan their next step in the strike that
has caused power curtailments and job layoffs and
threatened serious damage to the economy.
Carter, back from a weekend at the presidential
retreat at Camp David, Md., met with top advisers
to discuss steps to "implement, support and en

force" his decision, Powell reported.
The first step under the Taft-Hartley Act would
be for Carter to appoint a three-member board of
inquiry required under the law to make a report.
Officials said the administration probably would
be ready to go to court within a few days to seek a
back-to-work order against the miners.
The administration earlier had been considering
asking Congress for special legislation to au
thorize a federal seizure of the mines or to impose
binding arbitration in the case.
The Taft-Hartley Act would permit the federal
government to step in more swiftly, however. One
official estimated that the government could be in
federal court seeking an order by Wednesday.
It is widely believed that thousands of miners
would ignore such an order, complicating efforts
to impose at least a temporary end to the strike.
Miners have ignored such court injunctions in the
past.
