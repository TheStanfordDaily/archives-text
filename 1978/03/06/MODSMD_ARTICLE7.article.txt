# ASSU projects suffer $26,000 loss

The ASSU lost $26,000 on student services in one year,
an audit covering from September 1976 through August
1977 indicates.
Miles White, ASSU Financial Manager, said that the
cash-flow gross revenue for all ASSU projects is close to
a million dollars annually. He said that although $26,000
is not a great loss in relation to the amount of money that
the student services handles, the ASSU would rather not
run with a loss.
The two biggest losers, White said, were the ASSU
1 ypesetting Shop and the Sunday Flicks.
White said the typesetting shop lost approximately
$14,000 during the audit period, while the Flicks lost
approximately $9000.
Solved problems
The typesetting shop is attempting to correct its finan
cial problems this year. The shop is "doing off-campus
jobs," White said.
The typesetting shop's main account is the Daily, but it
also gets business from other student publications.
"Flicks lost an inordinate amount of money," White
said. "Flicks did not charge enough for Sunday Flicks."
White said this problem has been resolved this year by
increasing the price of the Flicks.

Other projects that lost money during the audit period
were the T-shirt sales, the course guide and special
events.
"Estimates for this year (are that) special events is the
only thing not in the black," White said. He said he
anticipates that special events will remedy much of its
financial problem with the upcoming America/Michael
Murphy concert.
The concert is during spring break but White said he
sees nothing wrong with the ASSU sponsoring an event
at a time when not all Stanford students can take advan
tage of the opportunity.
Added revenue
"Its providing us with a revenue to provide more
events for the campus," White said.
According to White, with the money earned from the
concert, the ASSU will be able to sponsor more free
events for the student body, such as groups playing in
White Plaza during spring quarter. Because this is the
only northern California concert America is giving, a
large turnout is expected despite the absence of many
students from campus.
ASSU projects that made money or broke even during
the 12 months audited include the travel service and the
linen and refrigerator services.
