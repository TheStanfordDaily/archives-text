# Government sets goals
## Nutrition Week arrives 
### 
Kirby Blake

March 5 to 11,1978 is National Nut
rition Week. This week has been set
aside for Americans to think about
good nutrition, what it is and why it is
important to us. Academically, this
question is easy to answer, however,
putting it into practical application
seems to be the problem.
T.V. commercials and newspaper
articles shout about high sugar,
non-nutrition and junk food items
rather than good eating practices.
What is so ironic is that nutritious
eating should be a demand and not a
favor one does for his own body. It is
time that authorities in the field, diet
itians and nutritionists alike, start
their own campaign to stamp out
"bad" nutrition.
Generally speaking, good nutri
tion means consuming all of the nut
rients such as protein, fats, car
bohydrates, vitamins, minerals,
water and calories that your body
needs every day for a healthy, normal
system. Certain methods have been
devised to help disseminate the in
formation into a daily usable form.
The "Basic Four" is a commonly
known and well accepted form. The
only problem is that it is lacking in
specific nutrients and can be used
only if its inadequacies are realized.
A better method is the Recom
mended Dietary Allowances (RDA).
The RDA lists the specific nutrients
needed daily by the body in relation
to age and sex. For example, a 20 year
old male needs 54 grams of protein
per day (female-46 grams). A three
ounce steak has about 32 grams of
protein while a glass of milk has nine
grams of protein
The RDA's are only a gui'ie since
each individual may have slightly dif
ferent requirements. The RDA can

determine just about what one needs
to eat or what may be lacking in his
diet.
Know nutrition sources
Suffering from Jargon Shock by
now? Well, don't worry. One does
not need to know how many millig
rams of a particular substance the
body needs to survive. What is im
portant, is to realize the body does
need certain nutrients every day and
to know where to get them.
Vitamin C is easy!! Foods such as
citrus fruits or juice, tomatoes or
cabbage are a good source of Vita
min C. Many B Vitamins may be
found in whole grains and organ
meats, milk and dark leafy green
vegetables.
If one knows what and why to eat
certain foods, good eating may make
more sense. To changean old cliche,
Variety may not be the spice of life,"
but, VARIETY makes eating exciting
and insures a balanced diet.
What one decides to eat or not to
eat is a very personal matter. No mat
ter where one is eating — restaur
ants, school food service, with the
family, or cooking for oneself —
good nutrition is possible through
proper selection and a working
knowledge of "good" foods.
Government guides
Besides being a personal matter,
nutrition is becoming a Federal and
State matter too. Last year the Select
Committee on Nutrition from the
U.S. Senate made a statement on the
"Dietary Coals for the United
States." In the words of Senator
George McGovern, The purpose of
this report is to point out that the
eating patterns of this century repre
sents as critical a public health con

cern as any now before us. We must
acknowledge and recognize that the
public is confused about what to eat
to maximize health.
"If we as a government want to
reduce health costs and maximize
the quality of life for all Americans,
we have an obligation to provide
practical guides to the individual
consumer as well as set national diet
ary goals for the countcy as a whole.
Such an effort is long overdue."
The study by the Nutrition Com
mittee first came out in January 1977.
The Dietary Goals stated six definite
goals for changes in the American
diet as well as seven suggestions to
follow the goals. Many people felt
the goals were a little dogmatic. After
a storm of criticism, a second report
came out recently. Some of the re
commendations were lessened in
their intensity.
Personalize your diet
The hope still remained that the
Dietary Goals would offer guidance
for making prudent decisions about
one's diet and provide nutrition
knowledge with which people could
take responsibility for maintaining
their own health and reducing their
own risk of illness. The statement
may be very significant since it is the
first time nutrition has been made a
Federal issue.
The University Food Service would
like to help you make National Nutri
tion Week a personal issue. In each
dining room there will be additional
information about good nutrition,
tips on sensible reducing, lists of re
commended nutrition books and
more.

reduce health costs and maximize
the quality of life for all Americans,
we have an obligation to provide
practical guides to the individual
consumer as well as set national diet

The study by the Nutrition Com
mittee first came out in January 1977.
The Dietary Goals stated six definite
goals for changes in the American
diet as well as seven suggestions to
follow the goals. Many people felt
the goals were a little dogmatic. After
a storm of criticism, a second report
came out recently. Some of the re
commendations were lessened in
their intensity.
Personalize your diet
The hope still remained that the
Dietary Goals would offer guidance
for making prudent decisions about
one's diet and provide nutrition
knowledge with which people could
take responsibility for maintaining
their own health and reducing their
own risk of illness. The statement
may be very significant since it is the
first time nutrition has been made a
Federal issue.

information about good nutrition,
tips on sensible reducing, lists of re
commended nutrition books and
more.

March 5 to 11,1978 is National Nut
rition Week. This week has been set
aside for Americans to think about
good nutrition, what it is and why it is
important to us. Academically, this
question is easy to answer, however,
putting it into practical application
seems to be the problem.
T.V. commercials and newspaper
articles shout about high sugar,
non-nutrition and junk food items
rather than good eating practices.
What is so ironic is that nutritious
eating should be a demand and not a
favor one does for his own body. It is
time that authorities in the field, diet
itians and nutritionists alike, start
their own campaign to stamp out
"bad" nutrition.
Generally speaking, good nutri
tion means consuming all of the nut
rients such as protein, fats, car
bohydrates, vitamins, minerals,
water and calories that your body
needs every day for a healthy, normal
system. Certain methods have been
devised to help disseminate the in
formation into a daily usable form.
The "Basic Four" is a commonly
known and well accepted form. The
only problem is that it is lacking in
specific nutrients and can be used
only if its inadequacies are realized.
A better method is the Recom
mended Dietary Allowances (RDA).
The RDA lists the specific nutrients
needed daily by the body in relation
to age and sex. For example, a 20 year
old male needs 54 grams of protein
per day (female-46 grams). A three
ounce steak has about 32 grams of
protein while a glass of milk has nine
grams of protein
The RDA's are only a gui'ie since
each individual may have slightly dif
ferent requirements. The RDA can

determine just about what one needs
to eat or what may be lacking in his
diet.
Know nutrition sources
Suffering from Jargon Shock by
now? Well, don't worry. One does
not need to know how many millig
rams of a particular substance the
body needs to survive. What is im
portant, is to realize the body does
need certain nutrients every day and
to know where to get them.
Vitamin C is easy!! Foods such as
citrus fruits or juice, tomatoes or
cabbage are a good source of Vita
min C. Many B Vitamins may be
found in whole grains and organ
meats, milk and dark leafy green
vegetables.
If one knows what and why to eat
certain foods, good eating may make
more sense. To changean old cliche,
Variety may not be the spice of life,"
but, VARIETY makes eating exciting
and insures a balanced diet.
What one decides to eat or not to
eat is a very personal matter. No mat
ter where one is eating — restaur
ants, school food service, with the
family, or cooking for oneself —
good nutrition is possible through
proper selection and a working
knowledge of "good" foods.
Government guides
Besides being a personal matter,
nutrition is becoming a Federal and
State matter too. Last year the Select
Committee on Nutrition from the
U.S. Senate made a statement on the
"Dietary Coals for the United
States." In the words of Senator
George McGovern, The purpose of
this report is to point out that the
eating patterns of this century repre
sents as critical a public health con

cern as any now before us. We must
acknowledge and recognize that the
public is confused about what to eat
to maximize health.
