# ERA harms women's rights

John Eberts

)oey George (Daily, Feb. 27), challenged someone to
rationally explain the anti-ERA sentiment. I have ac
cepted that challenge and now urge all readers to look
at the facts about the ERA and not the symbolic connota
tions of the amendment.
One can look first at the arguments which George
attempted to refute. First, it is true that many laws now
exist to end discrimination against women. They remove
discrimination in employment including hiring, pay,
promotions, equal pay covering executive, professional
and administrative positions. They guarantee equal ad
missions to professional schools and equal treatment in
mortgage loans and credit opportunities, as well as
many other specific cases of discrimination.
The argument that these laws can be easily repealed is
ridiculous. George does not have any evidence that one
of these laws has or ever will be repealed. A purely
symbolic act of passing the ERA will have tremendous
disadvantages which these specific laws do not carry.
George next brings up the question of segregation by
sex in public restrooms. According to Supreme Court
justice Potter Stewart, there is "no . . . general right of
privacy in the Bill of Rights, in any other part of the
Constitution, or in any case ever decided by (the Sup
reme) Court." Therefore, any person, male or female,
who wants integrated restrooms, locker rooms, etc., can
have them under the ERA.
Women in combat
One can next look at the argument that women would
be drafted and sent into battle. George falsely claims
that women are presently in combat in many parts of the
world, most notably in Israel. According to time
magazine ("The Women of Israel," Feb. 20, 1978), in
Israel, "women in thearmy are notallowed in combat —
or anywhere near the fighting. Instead, they serve
mostly in support jobs as typists, clerks, nurses and
teachers." They feel, as do many ERA opponents, that
"the army exists to protect . . . women, nottoendanger
them in its ranks."
George did state some commonly heard arguments
against the ERA; however, he completely overlooked
the most important ones. Probably the strongest argu
ment against the ERA is its effect upon homemakers

themselves. The ERA will disallow laws that are designed
to protect women because they have babies while men
do not. (I'm sure that even George would accept the
basis for these laws.)
If the ERA is ratified, wives will no longer have the right
to be supported by their husbands. They will no longer
be able to get credit in their husband's name, nor will
they have the right to ask for primary child support from
their husbands.
Wives can't collect
Most importantly, and possibly the only argument
needed, wives will no longer be able to collect Social
Security on their husband's earnings. The only way to
allow collection of Social Security by wives, under the
ERA, would be to double a husband's tax, so that he pays
Social Security for himself and his wife or to raise every
person's Social Security tax to provide for homemakers.
These increases would be in addition to the new Social
Security tax rates just established. According to the Phyl
lis Schafly Report (1975), the ERA will double the Federal
tax load of many male married taxpayers. While many
ERA supporters may not be homemakers who are de
pendent upon husbands, they should not inflict a harm
ful law on the many women who are dependent upon
husbands.
Women are different
The final argument that I pose here, is the effect upon
the church, which most people still hold sacred. If the
ERA is passed, those churches which base their belief
that men and women are different, upon the Bible, will
lose their tax exempt status. In 1974, the Supreme Court
denied tax exempt status to Bob Jones University be
cause of racial discrimination. Under ERA, the Court
would be forced to rule the same on sex discrimination.
While George claimed that those people against the
ERA believe that women are inferior and should be kept
in the home, the actual belief shared by ERA opponents
►s that women are different and that the many women
who are still satisfied by raising a family correctly, by
devoting the majority of their time to them, should not
be forced to live with a symbolic amendment which has
tremendous disadvantages.

ERA supporters may not be homemakers who are de
pendent upon husbands, they should not inflict a harm
ful law on the many women who are dependent upon
husbands.
Women are different
The final argument that I pose here, is the effect upon
the church, which most people still hold sacred. If the
ERA is passed, those churches which base their belief
that men and women are different, upon the Bible, will
lose their tax exempt status. In 1974, the Supreme Court
denied tax exempt status to Bob Jones University be
cause of racial discrimination. Under ERA, the Court
would be forced to rule the same on sex discrimination.
While George claimed that those people against the
ERA believe that women are inferior and should be kept
in the home, the actual belief shared by ERA opponents
►s that women are different and that the many women
who are still satisfied by raising a family correctly, by
devoting the majority of their time to them, should not
be forced to live with a symbolic amendment which has
tremendous disadvantages.

)oey George (Daily, Feb. 27), challenged someone to
rationally explain the anti-ERA sentiment. I have ac
cepted that challenge and now urge all readers to look
at the facts about the ERA and not the symbolic connota
tions of the amendment.
One can look first at the arguments which George
attempted to refute. First, it is true that many laws now
exist to end discrimination against women. They remove
discrimination in employment including hiring, pay,
promotions, equal pay covering executive, professional
and administrative positions. They guarantee equal ad
missions to professional schools and equal treatment in
mortgage loans and credit opportunities, as well as
many other specific cases of discrimination.
The argument that these laws can be easily repealed is
ridiculous. George does not have any evidence that one
of these laws has or ever will be repealed. A purely
symbolic act of passing the ERA will have tremendous
disadvantages which these specific laws do not carry.
George next brings up the question of segregation by
sex in public restrooms. According to Supreme Court
justice Potter Stewart, there is "no . . . general right of
privacy in the Bill of Rights, in any other part of the
Constitution, or in any case ever decided by (the Sup
reme) Court." Therefore, any person, male or female,
who wants integrated restrooms, locker rooms, etc., can
have them under the ERA.
Women in combat
One can next look at the argument that women would
be drafted and sent into battle. George falsely claims
that women are presently in combat in many parts of the
world, most notably in Israel. According to time
magazine ("The Women of Israel," Feb. 20, 1978), in
Israel, "women in thearmy are notallowed in combat —
or anywhere near the fighting. Instead, they serve
mostly in support jobs as typists, clerks, nurses and
teachers." They feel, as do many ERA opponents, that
"the army exists to protect . . . women, nottoendanger
them in its ranks."
George did state some commonly heard arguments
against the ERA; however, he completely overlooked
the most important ones. Probably the strongest argu
ment against the ERA is its effect upon homemakers

themselves. The ERA will disallow laws that are designed
to protect women because they have babies while men
do not. (I'm sure that even George would accept the
basis for these laws.)
If the ERA is ratified, wives will no longer have the right
to be supported by their husbands. They will no longer
be able to get credit in their husband's name, nor will
they have the right to ask for primary child support from
their husbands.
Wives can't collect
Most importantly, and possibly the only argument
needed, wives will no longer be able to collect Social
Security on their husband's earnings. The only way to
allow collection of Social Security by wives, under the
ERA, would be to double a husband's tax, so that he pays
Social Security for himself and his wife or to raise every
person's Social Security tax to provide for homemakers.
These increases would be in addition to the new Social
Security tax rates just established. According to the Phyl
lis Schafly Report (1975), the ERA will double the Federal
tax load of many male married taxpayers. While many
ERA supporters may not be homemakers who are de
pendent upon husbands, they should not inflict a harm
ful law on the many women who are dependent upon
husbands.
