Your honesty hurl me as otten as it did yourself
But it was the truth, the litesprinq of existence
We built Xanadu on a fault line Friday you
provided the earthquake Still, after lunch yester
day I thought we could continue pius see others
Then you played more games providing the de
structive aftershock
My actions with MP were the same as with MS.
the difference your'eaction I despise deceitand
fight it when I confront it.
We can never reconcile because of our fun
damental difference on the morality ot deceit, but
yet I'll think of ours as the besl ot times & the
worst ot times, and I'll always love you
