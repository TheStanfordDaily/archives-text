# Disaster areas declared after S. California storm
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Homeowners along the southern
California coast and the Baja Peninsula of Mexico sal
vaged what they could yesterday after a disastrous
weekend storm killed at least 45 persons, left thousands
more homeless, and caused millions of dollars in dam
age' ■_ ,
Even though skies were sunny yesterday, the storm
continued to take its toll. More houses slipped off their
foundations and down hillsides throughout the area.
Nearly 300 National Guardsmen in Malibu were pre
pared to fill more sandbags as pounding surf and high
tides threatened dozens of dangerously undermined
beachfront homes.
And U.S. Coast Guard helicopters finally airlifted to
safety many stranded Mexicans, among them 80 chil
dren from an orphanage who were flown to an Ensenada
army barracks.
One ray of hope for homeowners working to clear out
mud and debris from the estimated 300 badly damaged
homes and for those facing the prospect of rebuilding
from the group up came when Gov. Jerry Brown an
nounced the extension of federal disaster relief for
southern California to cover the new storm.
President jimmy Carter had issued a disaster declara
tion for eight counties after the severe storm early in
February. Yesterday's extension covers those counties
— Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Kern, Orange,
Riverside, San Bernardino and Tulare — plus Kings,
Monterey and part of San Luis Obispo County. Damage
from both storms was estimated at $106 million in the
11-county area.
In Mexico, government officials said damage from the
storm could be as high as $1 billion. President Jose Lopez
Portillo visited Tijuana and Ensenada and declared the
Baja region a disaster area.
Two expensive hillside homes on Green Vista Drive in
Encino collapsed yesterday morning after teetering
much of the weekend.
"The hill was moving all weekend. It was just a matter
of time," said Art Bond, who lives in a home below.
"Now, we're afraid more of the hill may come down."
"We could watch the retaining walls bulge and the
earth slip," said Lee Bond, Art's brother. "It was gradual

slippage."
The homes were evacuated and all belongings re
moved before their collapse, police said.
The blue skies that finally appeared for the first time in
a week Sunday were expected to remain through Friday,
with a chance of rain predicted by tomorrow for only the
Tehachapi Mountains.
Parts of the two major routes connecting southern
California to the north were open yesterday, but the
California Highway Patrol said delays of up to four hours
would continue for several days on both Interstate 5 and
U.S. 101.
Amtrak canceled train service between Oakland and
Los Angeles, sending its passengers by bus instead.
Southern Pacific said the earliest rail service could re
sume would be Thursday, and possibly not until Mon
day, said company spokesman Tom Buckley.
Freight trains were being rerouted to the San Joaquin
Valley, Buckley said.
One home was gutted by an electrical fire attributed to
the storm, while six others were partially damaged, said
police community relations spokesman John Dagan.
Six homes near the Baldwin Hills Dam were severely
damaged, and four received moderate to minor dam
age.
Agriculture officials estimated damage to crops at $1
million in Los Angeles County alone.
"Probably the hardest hit were the strawberries," said
Richard Knight, area coordinator for the county De
partment of Agriculture. Also corn planted during the
dry spell between storms has all rotted out and it will
take several weeks before things dry out."
Knight said strawberries suffered because they are
ripe now and workers cannot get into saturated fields to
pick them. Many have rotted because of the moisture.
Nurseries in many parts of the county were flooded
and yard plants were growing too large to be success
fully replanted, which means major losses to growers,
Knight said.
Of the 45 fatalities, 37 came in a wide area of Baja
California where an estimated 100,000 persons were left
homeless by floods and landslides. The eight deaths in
southern California were reported in an area ranging
from San Diego County north to Ventura.

Southern Pacific said the earliest rail service could re
sume would be Thursday, and possibly not until Mon
day, said company spokesman Tom Buckley.
Freight trains were being rerouted to the San Joaquin
Valley, Buckley said.
One home was gutted by an electrical fire attributed to
the storm, while six others were partially damaged, said
police community relations spokesman John Dagan.
Six homes near the Baldwin Hills Dam were severely
damaged, and four received moderate to minor dam
age.
Agriculture officials estimated damage to crops at $1
million in Los Angeles County alone.
"Probably the hardest hit were the strawberries," said
Richard Knight, area coordinator for the county De
partment of Agriculture. Also corn planted during the
dry spell between storms has all rotted out and it will
take several weeks before things dry out."
Knight said strawberries suffered because they are
ripe now and workers cannot get into saturated fields to
pick them. Many have rotted because of the moisture.
Nurseries in many parts of the county were flooded
and yard plants were growing too large to be success
fully replanted, which means major losses to growers,
Knight said.
Of the 45 fatalities, 37 came in a wide area of Baja
California where an estimated 100,000 persons were left
homeless by floods and landslides. The eight deaths in
southern California were reported in an area ranging
from San Diego County north to Ventura.

Los Angeles (AP) — Homeowners along the southern
California coast and the Baja Peninsula of Mexico sal
vaged what they could yesterday after a disastrous
weekend storm killed at least 45 persons, left thousands
more homeless, and caused millions of dollars in dam
age' ■_ ,
Even though skies were sunny yesterday, the storm
continued to take its toll. More houses slipped off their
foundations and down hillsides throughout the area.
Nearly 300 National Guardsmen in Malibu were pre
pared to fill more sandbags as pounding surf and high
tides threatened dozens of dangerously undermined
beachfront homes.
And U.S. Coast Guard helicopters finally airlifted to
safety many stranded Mexicans, among them 80 chil
dren from an orphanage who were flown to an Ensenada
army barracks.
One ray of hope for homeowners working to clear out
mud and debris from the estimated 300 badly damaged
homes and for those facing the prospect of rebuilding
from the group up came when Gov. Jerry Brown an
nounced the extension of federal disaster relief for
southern California to cover the new storm.
President jimmy Carter had issued a disaster declara
tion for eight counties after the severe storm early in
February. Yesterday's extension covers those counties
— Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Kern, Orange,
Riverside, San Bernardino and Tulare — plus Kings,
Monterey and part of San Luis Obispo County. Damage
from both storms was estimated at $106 million in the
11-county area.
In Mexico, government officials said damage from the
storm could be as high as $1 billion. President Jose Lopez
Portillo visited Tijuana and Ensenada and declared the
Baja region a disaster area.
Two expensive hillside homes on Green Vista Drive in
Encino collapsed yesterday morning after teetering
much of the weekend.
"The hill was moving all weekend. It was just a matter
of time," said Art Bond, who lives in a home below.
"Now, we're afraid more of the hill may come down."
"We could watch the retaining walls bulge and the
earth slip," said Lee Bond, Art's brother. "It was gradual

slippage."
The homes were evacuated and all belongings re
moved before their collapse, police said.
The blue skies that finally appeared for the first time in
a week Sunday were expected to remain through Friday,
with a chance of rain predicted by tomorrow for only the
Tehachapi Mountains.
Parts of the two major routes connecting southern
California to the north were open yesterday, but the
California Highway Patrol said delays of up to four hours
would continue for several days on both Interstate 5 and
U.S. 101.

Los Angeles, sending its passengers by bus instead.
