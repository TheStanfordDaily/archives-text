Serious shortage
Over the years, Stanford has been
asked many times by many groups to
provide more housing on its lands to
help reduce local commute traffic
and to ease the housing shortage. A
condition of Palo Alto's recent ap
proval of the Sand Hill Road Im
provement Project, in fact, was a de
claration on the part of the University
that it intended to use the 46-acre
parcel of land between the Oak
Creek Apartments and the Chil
dren's Hospital for housing.
The University has done much to
house or help house its students, fa
culty and staff — more than any other
agency in this area — but the shor
tage, remains a serious one and is
affecting the University's ability to at
tract employees.
Mestayer noted in a recent letter
(Daily, Feb. 28) that the Stanford land
use policy states that University lands
are to be used for "educational pur
poses," and so the 46 acres should
remain open. Those educational
uses include housing with priority to
faculty, students and staff, however.
The same policy also recognizes
the University's remaining unde
veloped lands as a unique resource
of immense value — a value greater
than the income that could be de
rived from extensive commercial use
of the property.
What is the answer — to preserve
the 46 acres while students and
employees commute many miles? Or
is it to use a portion of Stanford's
6,000 open acres to meet a pressing
need ? The land was given to Stanford
as an endowment for education and
has been developed carefully over
the years. Some of it may now have to
be used for an important new Uni
versity requirement.
