# Supreme Court rejects state tanker limit rules
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Sup
reme Court said yesterday that
states may not limit the size of
oil tankers plying their waters
and also ruled that Indian
tribes have no legal power to
prosecute non-Indians for
crimes committed on tribal
lands.
Deciding a pair of legal con
troversies from the state of
Washington, the justices
handed separate, serious set
backs to proponents of state
rights and Indian self
government.
The court's tanker ruling
struck down most provisions
of a Washington law aimed at
protecting the state's Puget
Sound and other inland waters
from the likelihood of a major
oil spill.
Although only Washington
and Alaska have such tanker
regulations, 16 states and sev
eral environmental groups
sided with Washington before
the nation's highest court in
arguing that states should be
free to protect their own en
vironmental resources.
The court voted 6-3 in strik
ing down, as a conflict with
federal law, Washington's out
right ban on all supertankers
exceeding 125,000 deadweight
tons.
The justices also nullified a
provision that all tankers bet
ween 40,000 and 125,000
deadweight tons must be
equipped with special safety
features such as double bot
toms under all stored oil.
Justices Thurgood Marshall,
William Brennan Jr. and Wil
liam Rehnquist dissented, say
ing the state's law imposing
such restrictions was not pre
empted by a less stringent fed
eral law.
The court split 7-2 in decid
ing that states may require a
tugboat escort for such large
tankers traveling state waters.

The justices were unanim
ous in declaring that
Washington could require
state-licensed pilots on vessels
that sail international waters
when the vessels are navigat
ing state waters.
They also unanimously
struck down a similar state re
quirement for domestic or
"coastwide" ships.
"Congress intended un
iform national standards for
design and construction of
tankers that would foreclose
the imposition of more strin
gent state requirements," Jus
tice 3yron White wrote for the
court.
He added: "Washington is
precluded from enforcing the
size limitation contained in the
tanker law."
The court's Indian rights de
cision, written by Rehnquist,
said the nation's many Indian
tribes do not have criminal

jurisdiction over non-tribal
members — even if they liveon
tribal lands — unless Congress
specifically authorizes such
jurisdiction.
The court thus overturned a
federal appeals court's ruling
that the Suquamish Indians, a
tiny tribe living on a reserva
tion near Seattle, could prose
cute non-Indians for violating
the tribe's criminal code.
Many Indian tribes and or
ganizations such as the Na
tional Congress of American
Indians, the Association of
American Indian Affairs and
the National Tribal Chairmen's
Association had told the court
its decision would resolve a
major test of Indians'
sovreignty rights.
The court's vote was 7-2,
with Chief Justice Warren
Burger and Marshall dissent
ing. Brennan took no part in
deciding the case.
