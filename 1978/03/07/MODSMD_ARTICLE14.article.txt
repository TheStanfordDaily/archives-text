# Giant sea turtles may face extinction

Washington (AP) — Giant sea turtles that
once numbered in the millions along
North America's Pacific Coast face extinc
tion unless prompt action is taken to save
the ocean-dwelling reptiles, conser
vationists warn.
Of the five species ot marine turtles that
inhabit the Pacific Coast of North America,
the populations of three species — the
hawksbill, loggerhead and leatherback —
already are perilously low, according to

the World Wildlife Fund.
Factors cited for the turtles' decline in
clude coastal development that destroyed
nesting beaches on the Mexican coast,
overharvesting by fishermen and nest
predation by both humans and animals.
No population estimates are made for
the hawksbill, loggerhead and leatherback
along the Pacific Coast. The fund says their
numbers are so few they are classified
simply as "rare."

Conservationists say the Mexican gov
ernment should impose an immediate
moratorium on the killing of all sea turtles
and guard nesting beaches throughout the
nesting and incubation period to protect
the eggs from predation.
Additionally, they say, the United States
should officially classify the green and
Pacific Ridley as endangered, a move that
would halt the importation of turtle skins
and products.
