# Former 'beauty queens'
## Stanford women claim contests were not 'beauty pageants' 
### Todd Bauman 
People do not usually think
of Stanford as a haven for
former beauty queens, yet
there are at least a halfrdozen
women with this honor pre
sently enrolled here. The point
all these women wish to make
is that they are not "beauty
queens" at all, but something
quite different.
"It is not a beauty pageant,"
explained sophomore and 1976
Miss Teen-age America Cathy
Durden, "I would feel ridicul
ous in a bathing suit having
somebody judge my figure.
Then you are looking at a
woman as a body and not as a
human being with a mind."

"Obviously it is not a beauty
contest," concurred the 1974
Miss Teen-age America Lori
Matsukawa, "for if they wanted
to find someone pretty they
sure could have."
The Miss Teen-age America
contest is held every year for
young women, and is spon
sored by the Dr. Pepper Com
pany. The winner is picked on
the basis of poise, personality
and talent as well as on the re
sults of an academic test.
"Some of the women there
were real achievers,"
explained Matsukawa, a
senior. "One of them was
going to Harvard and playing in
the Boston Symphony Or

chestra — they are women who
are doing things.
"The judges are interested in
which of these women show
academic ability and personal
ity. You're not meant to be bet
ter than anyone else — you
don't wear a crown," she ad
ded.
Junior Miss
Chris Vosseler, 1974 Junior
Miss, said the contest did not
stress looks.
"The judges start by looking
at athletics and talent and
grades, it's the total image that
they're looking for," she said.
Junior Miss also places great
emphasis on a judges' inter
view in getting to know the

contestants.
"They asked me aboutmy fu
ture and my ambitions and
things like that," recalled 1976
Hawaii Junior Miss Karen
Dougherty. "They don't get
nit-picky, they just want to find
out who you are," she added.
The contests themselves last
about one to two weeks, and
involve parades, banquets, ta
lent shows and the young wo
men's first confrontation with
the press. All described the
time as very exciting and
maturing. "You go into the
place not knowing a soul," said
Durden, "and you come out
doing a national television
broadcast co-hosted by Bob
Hope."
According to Dougherty,
"The finest thing is meeting all
the people and making a lot of
new friends.
"They are all dolls, very
friendly and a joy to meet, and
it's neat to think that I have a
friend in every state," she ad
ded.

The 1973 Third Runner-up
for Miss Teen-age America,
who asked not to be named,
said she felt the contest
created too much competi
tiveness between the teen
agers. "I hated it when it got to
stepping on other people's
feet and stabbing backs and
not being yourself," she said.
"I think I sort of realized for
awhile that much of the energy
in these things is in competing
and not in making yourself ex
cellent. All the energy put into
the selling of yourself should

be put into improving your
self," she added.
"There were a lot of ex
tremes and they came up with a
lot of fakey types who were out
to win," said Vosseler, "but
then there were a lot of great
people you are going to know
for life."
The large scholarships and
extensive prizes given to the
winners are cited as the prim
ary reasons for entering. But
many of the women explained
that they tried out more or less
on a whim.
"It was a good switch from
high school," said 1976 Tour
nament of Roses Princess Carol
Hennacy, "and it was a thing
you do and if you try out you
get two tickets to the Corona
tion Ball (where the Rose
Queen is crowned)."
Durden said she did it be
cause she felt she was too shy,
"And I thought it would be
kind of a challenge."
Prizes
Miss Teen-age America wins
many prizes, including a
$15,000 scholarship and a
year's supply of Dr. Pepper.
The winners also earn the op
portunity for worldwide travel.
Hennacy was invited to ap
pear on Hollywood Squares as
a result of her honor, where
she won $25,000 in prizes. Next
autumn she intends to take a
52-day South American cruise
she won on the show.
All the women remember
their period of service as
"queens" as extremely reward
ing yet very exhausting. The
women traveled around the
country and the world to ap

pear in parades, to do shows
for charities and to promote
the contest and the sponsors.
"In Japan I really felt like a
Miss Teen-age America. I came
from Hawaii, my last name is
Japanese and I was Miss Teen
age America — the Japanese
couldn't see how the three
things mixed," Matsukawa
said.
But the pace can be hectic,
and Hennacy said at one point
she visited 25 high schools in
three days. "Sleep becomes
very important," she said.
Hennacy recalled that the
Rose Parade was "fun, but
weird.
"Everyone's yelling at you
whether you know them or
not, and you'd expect the
people to be obnoxious and all
but they're not — and that's
good to see," she said.
Uncomfortable
The women said they were
exposed to many difficult
people and uncomfortable
situations. Some of the most
unpleasant experiences came
from encounters with the
press, they said.
"You get defensive a lot of
times, because they try and
make you say something nega
tive and then make the com
ment the headline," said Dur
den.
"It has its glamorous side,
but it isn't all glamor," Mat
sukawa said, "learning to
handle all sorts of situations
and meeting all kinds of people
— it's humbling."
Matsukawa said the experi
ence helped her decide her
career goal, however. "Being

interviewed by reporters all the
time that's when I decided I
wanted to be a journalist," she
said.
Adjustment
Some of the women found it
difficult to move back into
normal life. They said there is a
certain amount of embarrass
ment involved in being a
former pageant winner.
"I've been fighting
stereotypes all my life," said
Durden, "and then just before
I arrived at Stanford my resi
dent fellow told the dorm,
Guess who's coming winter
quarter?'
"It was an awkward situa
tion," she added. "Peopletend
to observe you and watch all
your mannerisms. The name
Miss Teen-age America brings
an image to people's minds
and I don't think I fit that."
Matsukawa said being Miss
Teen-age America is not the
boon for one's social life that
most people would expect.
"To destroy a myth," she
said, "it's wrong to think that
when you have a title like that
the guys really throng to you.
It's not true."
The women said they re
membered the experience as
one of the greatest in their
lives, but were glad when it fi
nally came to an end.
"Of course I loved it,' said
Durden, "I'd say that in that
year I gained about five or six
years of experience."
"It was a fantastic experi
ence," added Matsukawa,
"but really, after a year of all
that hoopla it was good to be
just Miss Nobody."

A lone woman law student sits in the law library. Women law stu
dents here are outnumbered by men almost five to one, which is a
higher ratio than at most other law schools in the country.
People do not usually think
of Stanford as a haven for
former beauty queens, yet
there are at least a halfrdozen
women with this honor pre
sently enrolled here. The point
all these women wish to make
is that they are not "beauty
queens" at all, but something
quite different.
"It is not a beauty pageant,"
explained sophomore and 1976
Miss Teen-age America Cathy
Durden, "I would feel ridicul
ous in a bathing suit having
somebody judge my figure.
Then you are looking at a
woman as a body and not as a
human being with a mind."

"Obviously it is not a beauty
contest," concurred the 1974
Miss Teen-age America Lori
Matsukawa, "for if they wanted
to find someone pretty they
sure could have."
The Miss Teen-age America
contest is held every year for
young women, and is spon
sored by the Dr. Pepper Com
pany. The winner is picked on
the basis of poise, personality
and talent as well as on the re
sults of an academic test.
"Some of the women there
were real achievers,"
explained Matsukawa, a
senior. "One of them was
going to Harvard and playing in
the Boston Symphony Or

chestra — they are women who
are doing things.
"The judges are interested in

academic ability and personal

Chris Vosseler, 1974 Junior

"The judges start by looking

Junior Miss also places great
emphasis on a judges' inter
view in getting to know the

contestants.
"They asked me aboutmy fu
ture and my ambitions and
things like that," recalled 1976
Hawaii Junior Miss Karen
Dougherty. "They don't get
nit-picky, they just want to find
out who you are," she added.
The contests themselves last
about one to two weeks, and
involve parades, banquets, ta
lent shows and the young wo
men's first confrontation with
the press. All described the
time as very exciting and
maturing. "You go into the
place not knowing a soul," said
Durden, "and you come out
doing a national television
broadcast co-hosted by Bob
Hope."
According to Dougherty,
"The finest thing is meeting all
the people and making a lot of
new friends.
"They are all dolls, very
friendly and a joy to meet, and
it's neat to think that I have a
friend in every state," she ad
ded.

The 1973 Third Runner-up
for Miss Teen-age America,
who asked not to be named,
said she felt the contest
created too much competi
tiveness between the teen
agers. "I hated it when it got to
stepping on other people's
feet and stabbing backs and
not being yourself," she said.
"I think I sort of realized for
awhile that much of the energy
in these things is in competing
and not in making yourself ex
cellent. All the energy put into
the selling of yourself should

be put into improving your
self," she added.
"There were a lot of ex
tremes and they came up with a
lot of fakey types who were out
to win," said Vosseler, "but
then there were a lot of great
people you are going to know
for life."
The large scholarships and
extensive prizes given to the
winners are cited as the prim
ary reasons for entering. But
many of the women explained
that they tried out more or less
on a whim.
"It was a good switch from
high school," said 1976 Tour
nament of Roses Princess Carol
Hennacy, "and it was a thing
you do and if you try out you
get two tickets to the Corona
tion Ball (where the Rose
Queen is crowned)."
Durden said she did it be
cause she felt she was too shy,
"And I thought it would be
kind of a challenge."
Prizes
Miss Teen-age America wins
many prizes, including a
$15,000 scholarship and a
year's supply of Dr. Pepper.
The winners also earn the op
portunity for worldwide travel.
Hennacy was invited to ap
pear on Hollywood Squares as
a result of her honor, where
she won $25,000 in prizes. Next
autumn she intends to take a
52-day South American cruise
she won on the show.
All the women remember
their period of service as
"queens" as extremely reward
ing yet very exhausting. The
women traveled around the
country and the world to ap

pear in parades, to do shows
for charities and to promote
the contest and the sponsors.
"In Japan I really felt like a
Miss Teen-age America. I came
from Hawaii, my last name is
Japanese and I was Miss Teen
age America — the Japanese
couldn't see how the three
things mixed," Matsukawa
said.
But the pace can be hectic,
and Hennacy said at one point
she visited 25 high schools in
three days. "Sleep becomes
very important," she said.
Hennacy recalled that the
Rose Parade was "fun, but
weird.
"Everyone's yelling at you
whether you know them or
not, and you'd expect the
people to be obnoxious and all
but they're not — and that's
good to see," she said.
Uncomfortable
The women said they were
exposed to many difficult
people and uncomfortable
situations. Some of the most
unpleasant experiences came
from encounters with the
press, they said.
"You get defensive a lot of
times, because they try and
make you say something nega
tive and then make the com
ment the headline," said Dur
den.
"It has its glamorous side,
but it isn't all glamor," Mat
sukawa said, "learning to
handle all sorts of situations
and meeting all kinds of people
— it's humbling."
Matsukawa said the experi
ence helped her decide her
career goal, however. "Being

interviewed by reporters all the
time that's when I decided I
wanted to be a journalist," she
said.
Adjustment
Some of the women found it
difficult to move back into
normal life. They said there is a
certain amount of embarrass
ment involved in being a
former pageant winner.
"I've been fighting

But the pace can be hectic,
and Hennacy said at one point
she visited 25 high schools in

Hennacy recalled that the

The women said they were

A lone woman law student sits in the law library. Women law stu
dents here are outnumbered by men almost five to one, which is a
higher ratio than at most other law schools in the country.
People do not usually think
of Stanford as a haven for
former beauty queens, yet
there are at least a halfrdozen
women with this honor pre
sently enrolled here. The point
all these women wish to make
is that they are not "beauty
queens" at all, but something
quite different.
"It is not a beauty pageant,"
explained sophomore and 1976
Miss Teen-age America Cathy
Durden, "I would feel ridicul
ous in a bathing suit having
somebody judge my figure.
Then you are looking at a
woman as a body and not as a
human being with a mind."

"Obviously it is not a beauty
contest," concurred the 1974
Miss Teen-age America Lori
Matsukawa, "for if they wanted
to find someone pretty they
sure could have."
The Miss Teen-age America
contest is held every year for
young women, and is spon
sored by the Dr. Pepper Com
pany. The winner is picked on
the basis of poise, personality
and talent as well as on the re
sults of an academic test.
"Some of the women there
were real achievers,"
explained Matsukawa, a
senior. "One of them was
going to Harvard and playing in
the Boston Symphony Or

chestra — they are women who
are doing things.
"The judges are interested in
which of these women show
academic ability and personal

"The judges start by looking

Junior Miss also places great
emphasis on a judges' inter

contestants.
"They asked me aboutmy fu
ture and my ambitions and
things like that," recalled 1976
Hawaii Junior Miss Karen
Dougherty. "They don't get
nit-picky, they just want to find
out who you are," she added.
The contests themselves last
about one to two weeks, and
involve parades, banquets, ta
lent shows and the young wo
men's first confrontation with
the press. All described the
time as very exciting and
maturing. "You go into the
place not knowing a soul," said
Durden, "and you come out
doing a national television
broadcast co-hosted by Bob
Hope."
According to Dougherty,
"The finest thing is meeting all
the people and making a lot of
new friends.
"They are all dolls, very
friendly and a joy to meet, and
it's neat to think that I have a
friend in every state," she ad

The 1973 Third Runner-up
for Miss Teen-age America,
who asked not to be named,
said she felt the contest
created too much competi
tiveness between the teen
agers. "I hated it when it got to
stepping on other people's
feet and stabbing backs and
not being yourself," she said.
"I think I sort of realized for
awhile that much of the energy
in these things is in competing
and not in making yourself ex
cellent. All the energy put into
the selling of yourself should

be put into improving your
self," she added.
"There were a lot of ex
tremes and they came up with a
lot of fakey types who were out
to win," said Vosseler, "but
then there were a lot of great
people you are going to know
for life."
The large scholarships and
extensive prizes given to the
winners are cited as the prim
ary reasons for entering. But
many of the women explained
that they tried out more or less
on a whim.
"It was a good switch from
high school," said 1976 Tour
nament of Roses Princess Carol
Hennacy, "and it was a thing
you do and if you try out you
get two tickets to the Corona
tion Ball (where the Rose
Queen is crowned)."
Durden said she did it be
cause she felt she was too shy,
"And I thought it would be
kind of a challenge."
Prizes
Miss Teen-age America wins
many prizes, including a
$15,000 scholarship and a
year's supply of Dr. Pepper.
The winners also earn the op
portunity for worldwide travel.
Hennacy was invited to ap
pear on Hollywood Squares as
a result of her honor, where
she won $25,000 in prizes. Next
autumn she intends to take a
52-day South American cruise
she won on the show.
All the women remember
their period of service as
"queens" as extremely reward
ing yet very exhausting. The
women traveled around the
country and the world to ap

pear in parades, to do shows
for charities and to promote
the contest and the sponsors.
"In Japan I really felt like a

awhile that much of the energy
in these things is in competing
and not in making yourself ex
cellent. All the energy put into
the selling of yourself should

be put into improving your
self," she added.
"There were a lot of ex
tremes and they came up with a
lot of fakey types who were out
to win," said Vosseler, "but
then there were a lot of great
people you are going to know
for life."
The large scholarships and
extensive prizes given to the
winners are cited as the prim
ary reasons for entering. But
many of the women explained
that they tried out more or less
on a whim.
"It was a good switch from
high school," said 1976 Tour
nament of Roses Princess Carol
Hennacy, "and it was a thing
you do and if you try out you
get two tickets to the Corona
tion Ball (where the Rose
Queen is crowned)."
Durden said she did it be
cause she felt she was too shy,
"And I thought it would be
kind of a challenge."
Prizes
Miss Teen-age America wins
many prizes, including a
$15,000 scholarship and a
year's supply of Dr. Pepper.
The winners also earn the op
portunity for worldwide travel.
Hennacy was invited to ap
pear on Hollywood Squares as
a result of her honor, where
she won $25,000 in prizes. Next
autumn she intends to take a
52-day South American cruise
she won on the show.
All the women remember
their period of service as
"queens" as extremely reward
ing yet very exhausting. The
women traveled around the
country and the world to ap

pear in parades, to do shows
for charities and to promote
the contest and the sponsors.
"In Japan I really felt like a
Miss Teen-age America. I came
from Hawaii, my last name is
Japanese and I was Miss Teen
age America — the Japanese
couldn't see how the three
things mixed," Matsukawa
said.
But the pace can be hectic,
and Hennacy said at one point
she visited 25 high schools in
three days. "Sleep becomes
very important," she said.
Hennacy recalled that the
Rose Parade was "fun, but
weird.
"Everyone's yelling at you
whether you know them or
not, and you'd expect the
people to be obnoxious and all
but they're not — and that's
good to see," she said.
Uncomfortable
The women said they were
exposed to many difficult
people and uncomfortable
situations. Some of the most
unpleasant experiences came
from encounters with the
press, they said.
"You get defensive a lot of
times, because they try and
make you say something nega
tive and then make the com
ment the headline," said Dur
den.
"It has its glamorous side,
but it isn't all glamor," Mat
sukawa said, "learning to
handle all sorts of situations
and meeting all kinds of people
— it's humbling."
Matsukawa said the experi
ence helped her decide her
career goal, however. "Being

interviewed by reporters all the
time that's when I decided I
wanted to be a journalist," she
said.
Adjustment
Some of the women found it
difficult to move back into
normal life. They said there is a
certain amount of embarrass
ment involved in being a
former pageant winner.
"I've been fighting
stereotypes all my life," said
Durden, "and then just before
I arrived at Stanford my resi
dent fellow told the dorm,
Guess who's coming winter
quarter?'
"It was an awkward situa
tion," she added. "Peopletend
to observe you and watch all
your mannerisms. The name
Miss Teen-age America brings
an image to people's minds
and I don't think I fit that."
Matsukawa said being Miss
Teen-age America is not the
boon for one's social life that
most people would expect.
"To destroy a myth," she
said, "it's wrong to think that
when you have a title like that
the guys really throng to you.
It's not true."
The women said they re
membered the experience as
one of the greatest in their
lives, but were glad when it fi
nally came to an end.
"Of course I loved it,' said
Durden, "I'd say that in that
year I gained about five or six
years of experience."
"It was a fantastic experi
ence," added Matsukawa,
"but really, after a year of all
that hoopla it was good to be
just Miss Nobody."
