# Women outnumbered in legal profession
## 
### Fran Garland 
The percentage of female
students enrolled at Stanford
Law School is declining for the
third straight year, creating an
imbalanced sex ratio which
women administrators and law
students are struggling to
change.
The Stanford Law School
Journal of Oct. 25, 1977 re
ported that only 20.3 per cent
of the entering class were wo
men. This is several percentage
points lower than most other
law schools.
Vicky Diaz, the new assistant
dean for student affairs, said
the basic problem is low en
rollment of those women ad
mitted into law school here.
Diaz added that her job in
volves recruiting in an effort to
increase the number of female
enrollees.
A primary part of Diaz' en
rollment program is personal
contact with women admitted.
Both law school alumni and the
Women of Stanford Law (WSL)
organization have been useful
in this aspect of the program.
Eileen Sobeck, president of
WSL, said she feels the number
of female applicants should
also be increased. One major
function of her organization is
to encourage qualified women
to pursue legal careers.
Many factors
Diaz said there are many fac
tors that could account for the
low acceptance rate of women
admitted. For example, "Tui
tion (at Stanford Law School) is
the highest in the country. This
might deter women with family
responsibilities," she said.

For some women, the lack of
female faculty members could
have an adverse effect on their
decision also, Sobeck con
tinued.
"There is something stilted,
isolated and unreal about an all
male faculty," she com
mented.
Those favoring increased ef
forts to hire women professors
made clear that they didn't
want, in Sobeck's words, "a
women's counselor, or a
shoulder to cry on." Instead,
they said they see women fa
culty as a way to diversify the
learning experience.
Female member
The faculty has one female
member, Barbara Babcock,
who is currently on leave to the
justice Department. In the
Stanford Law School Journal,
Babcock is quoted as saying
that there are no female fa
culty members here because
the administration keeps look
ing for women who look
exactly like men' in terms of
credentials." She suggested
that women in practice and in
public law may be viable can
didates for faculty positions.
According to Diaz, the ad
ministration is really making an
effort to hire women. One has
been signed for next year and
one or two more are expected
to be hired before September.
There is also a low percen
tage of women in the legal pro
fession. Gloria Pyszka, head of
the Placement Center at the
law school, said that employers
are looking for quality lawyers,
men or women.
There have been no cases of

overt discrimination in hiring
this year, and no formal com
plaints so far, according to
Psyzka. She explained that
there is a procedure for re
course in identified cases of
discrimination, but no one has
resortetl to it.
Pyszka also indicated that
many recruiters emphasize
their interest in both women
and minorities before coming
to campus. She added, "There
is a tendency for all students to
rely on on-campus recruiting
in their job search."
Alumnae survey
Women enter a wide variety
of jobs within the legal profes
sion. In a female alumnae sur
vey conducted by WSL, the
three most popular fields were
government (including district
attorney), general practice and
civil litigation.
Several third-year women
indicated that government
jobs were popular because of
better hours and more im
mediate responsibility.
According to Pyszka, wo
men look at the composition of
their support group at poten
tial firms." They ask how many
women are in the firm and in
what fields, as well as why
those who were there have
left.
Alumnae questioned by WSL
indicated significant difficul
ties in the integration of career
and personal life. Family and
time pressures were the two
areas most frequently cited.
While many women still im
pose strict limitations on loca
tion and time in job hunting
due to family considerations,

Pyszka stated that "More and
more women are very career
committed and try to balance
out their priorities." Women
and men do not differ in this
practice.
Dual careers
The placement center at
tempts to help students deal
with these problems. Under
Pyszka's direction, a special
program on "dual career mar
riages" was held. A similar
program last year dealt with
"job hunting when a signific
ant other person is involved."
However, there are also dif
ficulties for women once they
are hired. The alumnae survey
revealed that 64 per cent of
those responding had encoun
tered significant difficulties in
their legal careers because of
being a woman. The trouble
areas most frequently men
tioned were the attitudes of fel
low attorneys and judges, and
obtaining employment and ad
vancement.
Positive experiences are
possible, however. Diaz said
she saw no difference in the
way men and women were
treated either in job assign
ments or peer relations while
she was working at one law
firm.
She did acknowledge, how
ever, that the nearly balanced
sex ratio in her particular field
within the firm may have made
her situation unique. The firm
does have four to five female
partners now and hires bet
ween an estimated 40 to 60 per
cent women with each new
pool.
Although the sexual imba

lance is slowly changing within
the profession, Soheck said
another problem in the lack of
female role models is that
there are not very many female
judges, partners, or high level
government officials. Sobeck
said she sees a need for an ac
celerated advancement of
women.
Pyszka said she feels women
miss out on a role model for
peer relations, but are able to
see a professional model in
men.
As more women attain
higher positions, Pyszka pre
dicts that there could be a
more flexible response to in
creasing demands by attorneys
of both sexes for lifestyle con
siderations in employment ar
rangements. "The situation
has improved and will con
tinue to," she concluded.
For those considering a
career in law, the female alum
nae offered the following ad
vice: . . pursue legal careers
with a realistic attitude toward
what the demands will be and
realistic expectations as to the
rewards."
For both men and women in
the legal profession, Diaz said,
' A lot of hard work is the key to
success."

those responding had encoun
tered significant difficulties in
their legal careers because of
being a woman. The trouble
areas most frequently men
tioned were the attitudes of fel
low attorneys and judges, and
obtaining employment and ad
vancement.
Positive experiences are
possible, however. Diaz said
she saw no difference in the
way men and women were
treated either in job assign
ments or peer relations while
she was working at one law
firm.
She did acknowledge, how
ever, that the nearly balanced
sex ratio in her particular field
within the firm may have made
her situation unique. The firm
does have four to five female
partners now and hires bet
ween an estimated 40 to 60 per
cent women with each new
pool.
Although the sexual imba

lance is slowly changing within
the profession, Soheck said
another problem in the lack of
female role models is that
there are not very many female
judges, partners, or high level
government officials. Sobeck
said she sees a need for an ac
celerated advancement of
women.
Pyszka said she feels women
miss out on a role model for
peer relations, but are able to
see a professional model in
men.
As more women attain
higher positions, Pyszka pre
dicts that there could be a
more flexible response to in
creasing demands by attorneys
of both sexes for lifestyle con
siderations in employment ar
rangements. "The situation
has improved and will con
tinue to," she concluded.
For those considering a
career in law, the female alum
nae offered the following ad
vice: . . pursue legal careers
with a realistic attitude toward
what the demands will be and
realistic expectations as to the
rewards."
For both men and women in
the legal profession, Diaz said,
' A lot of hard work is the key to
success."
The percentage of female
students enrolled at Stanford
Law School is declining for the
third straight year, creating an
imbalanced sex ratio which
women administrators and law
students are struggling to
change.
The Stanford Law School
Journal of Oct. 25, 1977 re
ported that only 20.3 per cent
of the entering class were wo
men. This is several percentage
points lower than most other
law schools.
Vicky Diaz, the new assistant
dean for student affairs, said
the basic problem is low en
rollment of those women ad
mitted into law school here.
Diaz added that her job in
volves recruiting in an effort to
increase the number of female
enrollees.
A primary part of Diaz' en
rollment program is personal
contact with women admitted.
Both law school alumni and the
Women of Stanford Law (WSL)
organization have been useful
in this aspect of the program.
Eileen Sobeck, president of
WSL, said she feels the number
of female applicants should
also be increased. One major
function of her organization is
to encourage qualified women
to pursue legal careers.
Many factors
Diaz said there are many fac
tors that could account for the
low acceptance rate of women
admitted. For example, "Tui
tion (at Stanford Law School) is
the highest in the country. This
might deter women with family
responsibilities," she said.

For some women, the lack of
female faculty members could
have an adverse effect on their
decision also, Sobeck con
tinued.
"There is something stilted,
isolated and unreal about an all
male faculty," she com
mented.
Those favoring increased ef
forts to hire women professors
made clear that they didn't
want, in Sobeck's words, "a
women's counselor, or a
shoulder to cry on." Instead,
they said they see women fa
culty as a way to diversify the
learning experience.
Female member
The faculty has one female
member, Barbara Babcock,
who is currently on leave to the
justice Department. In the
Stanford Law School Journal,
Babcock is quoted as saying
that there are no female fa
culty members here because
the administration keeps look
ing for women who look
exactly like men' in terms of
credentials." She suggested
that women in practice and in
public law may be viable can
didates for faculty positions.
According to Diaz, the ad
ministration is really making an
effort to hire women. One has
been signed for next year and
one or two more are expected
to be hired before September.
There is also a low percen
tage of women in the legal pro
fession. Gloria Pyszka, head of
the Placement Center at the
law school, said that employers
are looking for quality lawyers,
men or women.
There have been no cases of

overt discrimination in hiring
this year, and no formal com
plaints so far, according to
Psyzka. She explained that
there is a procedure for re
course in identified cases of
discrimination, but no one has
resortetl to it.
Pyszka also indicated that
many recruiters emphasize
their interest in both women
and minorities before coming
to campus. She added, "There
is a tendency for all students to
rely on on-campus recruiting
in their job search."
Alumnae survey
Women enter a wide variety
of jobs within the legal profes
sion. In a female alumnae sur
vey conducted by WSL, the
three most popular fields were
government (including district
attorney), general practice and
civil litigation.
Several third-year women
indicated that government
jobs were popular because of
better hours and more im
mediate responsibility.
According to Pyszka, wo
men look at the composition of
their support group at poten
tial firms." They ask how many
women are in the firm and in
what fields, as well as why
those who were there have
left.
Alumnae questioned by WSL
indicated significant difficul
ties in the integration of career
and personal life. Family and
time pressures were the two
areas most frequently cited.
While many women still im
pose strict limitations on loca
tion and time in job hunting
due to family considerations,

Pyszka stated that "More and
more women are very career
committed and try to balance
out their priorities." Women
and men do not differ in this
practice.
Dual careers
The placement center at
tempts to help students deal
with these problems. Under
Pyszka's direction, a special
program on "dual career mar
riages" was held. A similar
program last year dealt with
"job hunting when a signific
ant other person is involved."
However, there are also dif
ficulties for women once they
are hired. The alumnae survey
revealed that 64 per cent of
those responding had encoun
tered significant difficulties in
their legal careers because of
being a woman. The trouble
areas most frequently men

there is a procedure for re
course in identified cases of
discrimination, but no one has
resortetl to it.
Pyszka also indicated that
many recruiters emphasize
their interest in both women
and minorities before coming
to campus. She added, "There
is a tendency for all students to
rely on on-campus recruiting
in their job search."
Alumnae survey
Women enter a wide variety
of jobs within the legal profes
sion. In a female alumnae sur
vey conducted by WSL, the
three most popular fields were
government (including district
attorney), general practice and
civil litigation.
Several third-year women
indicated that government
jobs were popular because of
better hours and more im
mediate responsibility.
According to Pyszka, wo
men look at the composition of
their support group at poten
tial firms." They ask how many
women are in the firm and in
what fields, as well as why
those who were there have
left.
Alumnae questioned by WSL
indicated significant difficul
ties in the integration of career
and personal life. Family and
time pressures were the two
areas most frequently cited.
While many women still im
pose strict limitations on loca
tion and time in job hunting
due to family considerations,

Pyszka stated that "More and
more women are very career
committed and try to balance
out their priorities." Women
and men do not differ in this
practice.
Dual careers
The placement center at
tempts to help students deal
with these problems. Under
Pyszka's direction, a special
program on "dual career mar
riages" was held. A similar
program last year dealt with
"job hunting when a signific
ant other person is involved."
However, there are also dif
ficulties for women once they
are hired. The alumnae survey
revealed that 64 per cent of
those responding had encoun
tered significant difficulties in
their legal careers because of
being a woman. The trouble
areas most frequently men
tioned were the attitudes of fel
low attorneys and judges, and
obtaining employment and ad
vancement.
Positive experiences are
possible, however. Diaz said
she saw no difference in the
way men and women were
treated either in job assign
ments or peer relations while
she was working at one law
firm.
She did acknowledge, how
ever, that the nearly balanced
sex ratio in her particular field
within the firm may have made
her situation unique. The firm
does have four to five female
partners now and hires bet
ween an estimated 40 to 60 per
cent women with each new
pool.
Although the sexual imba

lance is slowly changing within
the profession, Soheck said
another problem in the lack of
female role models is that
there are not very many female
judges, partners, or high level
government officials. Sobeck
said she sees a need for an ac
celerated advancement of
women.
Pyszka said she feels women
miss out on a role model for
peer relations, but are able to
see a professional model in
men.
As more women attain
higher positions, Pyszka pre
dicts that there could be a
more flexible response to in
creasing demands by attorneys
of both sexes for lifestyle con
siderations in employment ar
rangements. "The situation
has improved and will con
tinue to," she concluded.
For those considering a
career in law, the female alum
nae offered the following ad
vice: . . pursue legal careers
with a realistic attitude toward
what the demands will be and
realistic expectations as to the
rewards."
For both men and women in
the legal profession, Diaz said,
' A lot of hard work is the key to
success."
The percentage of female
students enrolled at Stanford
Law School is declining for the
third straight year, creating an
imbalanced sex ratio which
women administrators and law
students are struggling to
change.
The Stanford Law School
Journal of Oct. 25, 1977 re
ported that only 20.3 per cent
of the entering class were wo
men. This is several percentage
points lower than most other
law schools.
Vicky Diaz, the new assistant
dean for student affairs, said
the basic problem is low en
rollment of those women ad
mitted into law school here.
Diaz added that her job in
volves recruiting in an effort to
increase the number of female
enrollees.
A primary part of Diaz' en
rollment program is personal
contact with women admitted.
Both law school alumni and the
Women of Stanford Law (WSL)
organization have been useful
in this aspect of the program.
Eileen Sobeck, president of
WSL, said she feels the number
of female applicants should
also be increased. One major
function of her organization is
to encourage qualified women
to pursue legal careers.
Many factors
Diaz said there are many fac
tors that could account for the
low acceptance rate of women
admitted. For example, "Tui
tion (at Stanford Law School) is
the highest in the country. This
might deter women with family
responsibilities," she said.

For some women, the lack of
female faculty members could
have an adverse effect on their
decision also, Sobeck con
tinued.
"There is something stilted,
isolated and unreal about an all
male faculty," she com
mented.
Those favoring increased ef
forts to hire women professors
made clear that they didn't
want, in Sobeck's words, "a
women's counselor, or a
shoulder to cry on." Instead,
they said they see women fa
culty as a way to diversify the
learning experience.
Female member
The faculty has one female
member, Barbara Babcock,
who is currently on leave to the
justice Department. In the
Stanford Law School Journal,
Babcock is quoted as saying
that there are no female fa
culty members here because
the administration keeps look
ing for women who look
exactly like men' in terms of
credentials." She suggested
that women in practice and in
public law may be viable can
didates for faculty positions.
According to Diaz, the ad
ministration is really making an
effort to hire women. One has
been signed for next year and
one or two more are expected
to be hired before September.
There is also a low percen
tage of women in the legal pro
fession. Gloria Pyszka, head of
the Placement Center at the
law school, said that employers
are looking for quality lawyers,
men or women.
There have been no cases of

overt discrimination in hiring
this year, and no formal com
plaints so far, according to
Psyzka. She explained that
there is a procedure for re
course in identified cases of
discrimination, but no one has
resortetl to it.
Pyszka also indicated that
