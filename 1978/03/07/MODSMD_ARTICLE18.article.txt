## Blues/peter koehler Taj Mahal: 'I just keep after it' 
### 
Stagnation is as foreign to Taj Mahal as is sel
ling out to current popular musical trends in
order to make a million or two. Clearly, Taj has
not tailored his music for mass consumption;
nor has he complacently kept his music at a
standstill, even when he knew that his devout
followers would eat it up.
I am sure that a good portion of the audience
at The Great American Music Hall last week
came to hear 'Fishin' Blues," "Ain't Cwine
Whistle Dixie," and other such Taj favorites
from earlier albums. And he did not disappoint
them.

But Taj has let his music evolve. That is, over
the last four or five years, he has incorporated
into it elements of reggae, calypso, and soul,
while, at the same time, retaining his blues and
traditional Southern heritage. He has left no
thing behind, but rather has kept building and
adding, refusing to be catagorized and con
fined.
Not stale
"I think the music industry has created the
illusion, the false illusion, that whatthey put out
is all that exists in the music business. But be

cause people are connected to a much more
diverse arrangement of feelings and vibrations,
there's always the possibility for somethings to
come into it that no one thought was happening
before." So, when Taj played Ain't Cwine
Whistle Dixie," "I'm Coin' to Move up to the
Country, and Paint my Mailbos Blue," or "Good
Morning, Miss Brown," the audience did not
hear standard, stale versions, but old songs in
fused with new and refreshing influences.
Taj's refusal to stagnate, then, is a result of his
willingness to change, and to change according
to what feels right to him, not the music indus
try. But it's not easy. "I've got to keep my eyes
together, know what I'm doin' . . . and just try
not to despair over the fact that if I broke three
or four of my cardinal rules, I would make a
million dollars. But it's not worth it, 'cause for
me, the music is what's happening . . . There
are all those people who'll go out and sell as
many albums as they can. Six million albums!
What?! That's business, man, that ain't music."
Different
For Taj, music does not consist of putting out
records, and then hitting the tour circuit in
order to sell them — rather, he has brought
together different strands of African music, and
then creates, each time he plays, a thoroughly
alive musical experience. It's all from the same
source. It's all got its roots based in afro
american, afro-caribbean, straight, direct Afri
can music . . . but always coming from the real
energy and the real roots, through me ... I
want to play music, make sure it's really happen
ing. Every night, music."
After hearing a Taj concert, all of that is obvi
ous. It is not a show" or a "routine;" nor are
there any gimmacks to keep your attention. It is
only Taj and his band channelling through
themselves, toward the audience, the musical
energy they all feel.
Huge
And you know that Taj is loving every minute
of it. His huge frame, moving to every quarter
beat; his face, radiating innumerable moods,
and continually communicating with his audi
ence; his six-man band, maintaining that perfect
balance between tightnessand spontaneity, and
constantly musically interacting with one
another; and his audience, captivated by the
enchantment of his personality and the power
of his music, feeling themselves part of the
whole process — it is all this that renders a Taj
concert great.
As long as Taj maintains his relentless commit
ment to quality music and superb concerts, he
should be around for a long time. "I just keep
after it; that's the only way, if you're going to
play your own music. Keep after it. The other
way is real fast, but, boy, is it far to the ground."
