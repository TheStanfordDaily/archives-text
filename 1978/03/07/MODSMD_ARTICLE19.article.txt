## Still Kiley's Quixote 
### 
Time has not tarnished the
armor of Don Quixote or
Richard Kiley. The story re
mains inspiring and enchant
ing. And Kiley's performance
now is as sterling as it was
when he originally created the
title role in Man of La Man
cha."
If Kiley had not already gar
nered a Tony for his portrayal
of Cervantes/Quixote, he
would certainly receive one
today. The passage of time
ages most performers, but not
Richard Kiley. He has not aged;
he has grown with time.
Though he is associated with
the musical theater by many,
Kiley's craft as a performer has
been finely honed by his ex
perience with straight dramatic
roles. He has appeared in such
shows as A Moon for the Mis
begotten," Advice and Con
sent," and, most recently,
The Masterbuilders."
Moviegoers will remember

him as Diane Keaton's father in
the widely acclaimed film
"Looking for Mr. Goodbar."
Kiley is an actor of under
statement. He prefers under
playing a scene to over
dramatizing. Unlike the re
cordings of some vocalists, his
rendition of ' The Impossible
Dream" is simple, yet strong.
By refraining from a lot of huf
fing and puffing, Kiley lends
power and credibility to Joe
Darion's fine lyrics. Hints of
humor in Kiley's performance
endear him to the audience.
And there is just enough sanity
in his portrayal of Quixote to
make one aware that the knight
of La Mancha is more a genius
with a vision than he is a raving
madman.
Though Tony Martinez has
ridden along side of nine diffe
rent Don Quixotes in his
career, his performance never
could have been more enter
taining. The part of Sancho

does not demand extraordi
nary vocal ability, but it does
require a good sense of timing
plus a feel for the audience.
Martinez possesses both: he
knows when to make the audi
ence laugh and when to allow
Kiley control of the stage. His
strongest scene, the one in
which he delivers a dirty dish
rag to Quixote as a token of
Aldonza'sesteem, ranksasone
of the most enjoyable mo
ments of the play.
The rest of the cast is sensa
tional. Highest honors are mer
ited by all.
The power of the play, how
ever, cannot be attributed sol
ely to the actors. Howard Bay's
set design was breathtaking in
its sheer simplicity. Bay chose
to use a very deep, dark stage
highlighted with mere sugges
tions of scenery. Transi
tions from the Quixote story to
the Cervantes story relied ap
propriately on the actors and
not on the stage properties.
The people at the Curran
theater seem to be dedicated
to bringing to San Francisco
the finest musical theater en
tertainment. Last month we
were treated to Carol Chan
ning in Hello, Dolly," this
month to Richard Kiley in Man
of La Mancha." These are two
acts which are hard to follow.
