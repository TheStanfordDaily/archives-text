# SCRIP members discuss positions
## 
### Joel Dickholtz News analysis 
The Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP)
represents a major force in the South
African controversy here. SCRIP was
successful in organizing last spring's
sit-in at Old Union, but recently the
group has had difficulty gaining
campus support.
"The Stanford community has a
confused image of SCRIP. A lot of
peopleare underthe impression that
we're a group of well-meaning
idealists who don't know what we're
talking about," said SCRIP spokes
person Kim McCall.
SCRIP'S reputation has been a
topic of great concern at recent
group meetings. McCall said bad
publicity from publications including
the Daily is one of the major causes
of SCRIP'S faltering image.
SCRIP member Todd Bauman said
we've been misrepresented out of
ignorance on their (the Daily's) part. I
understand that the Daily works
under a lot of time pressure, but they
have not always portrayed our posi
tion accurately to the students." «
Despite "bad press," however, the
spokespersons said they felt SCRIP'S
image has been changed rather than
hurt. According to McCall, the
change is the result of a loss of
idealism and a more realistic at
titude.
"I think that at the time of the sit-in
last year a lot of people became very
idealistically involved with SCRIP.
Then the arrests happened, things
slowed down, and people had a
chance to really think it over, and
they realized that it's a much more
complex situation than they thought.
They began to say, Hey, maybe
SCRIP doesn't know the answer.'
Well, we do," McCall said.

According to Bauman, SCRIP'S
solution to the apartheid question
differs from that of Hoover Institu
tion Director of African Studies Peter
Duignan, who sees increased foreign
investment and an expanding South
African economy as the best means
to combat racial oppression.
"First of all, what Duignan said is
not right. We aren't all fighting for
the same thing. Duignan, Lyman and
the trustees are concerned with the
superficial aspects of ending apar
theid. Its end will actually mean
much more than the economic
changes they recommend," Bauman
said.
SCRIP is committed to ending
apartheid through corporate with
drawal from South Africa, according
to the spokespersons. SCRIP
member Margaret Goud said, "Stan
ford should do everything within its
power to see that American corpora
tions withdraw from South Africa.
We support proxies to that effect,
even though they've been shown to
be ineffectual in the past. After that
fails, we still recommend divest
ment."
However, there was a great deal of
confusion concerning the possible
effects that withdrawal would have
on South Africa. Spokespersons
generally agreed that the loss of
American business would cause a re
cession, but admitted they were un
sure of what would happen next.
Spokespersons said they hoped the
recession would lead to the weaken
ing of the government.
SCRIP'S plans for spring quarter
are indefinite, with the exception of a
referendum on the spring ballot de
aling with corporate withdrawal from
South Africa.

image has been changed rather than
hurt. According to McCall, the
change is the result of a loss of
idealism and a more realistic at
titude.
"I think that at the time of the sit-in
last year a lot of people became very
idealistically involved with SCRIP.
Then the arrests happened, things
slowed down, and people had a
chance to really think it over, and
they realized that it's a much more
complex situation than they thought.
They began to say, Hey, maybe
SCRIP doesn't know the answer.'
Well, we do," McCall said.

According to Bauman, SCRIP'S
solution to the apartheid question
differs from that of Hoover Institu
tion Director of African Studies Peter
Duignan, who sees increased foreign
investment and an expanding South
African economy as the best means
to combat racial oppression.
"First of all, what Duignan said is
not right. We aren't all fighting for
the same thing. Duignan, Lyman and
the trustees are concerned with the
superficial aspects of ending apar
theid. Its end will actually mean
much more than the economic
changes they recommend," Bauman
said.
SCRIP is committed to ending
apartheid through corporate with
drawal from South Africa, according
to the spokespersons. SCRIP
member Margaret Goud said, "Stan
ford should do everything within its
power to see that American corpora
tions withdraw from South Africa.
We support proxies to that effect,
even though they've been shown to
be ineffectual in the past. After that
fails, we still recommend divest
ment."
However, there was a great deal of
confusion concerning the possible
effects that withdrawal would have
on South Africa. Spokespersons
generally agreed that the loss of
American business would cause a re
cession, but admitted they were un
sure of what would happen next.
Spokespersons said they hoped the
recession would lead to the weaken
ing of the government.
SCRIP'S plans for spring quarter
are indefinite, with the exception of a
referendum on the spring ballot de
aling with corporate withdrawal from
South Africa.

Two speakers at last night's public forum sponsored by the Commission on
Investment Responsibility prepare to speak to tne crowd. Thirty speakers attacked
the University's policy to maintain investments in stocks of companies doing
business in South Africa.
The Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP)
represents a major force in the South
African controversy here. SCRIP was
successful in organizing last spring's
sit-in at Old Union, but recently the
group has had difficulty gaining
campus support.
"The Stanford community has a
confused image of SCRIP. A lot of
peopleare underthe impression that
we're a group of well-meaning
idealists who don't know what we're
talking about," said SCRIP spokes
person Kim McCall.
SCRIP'S reputation has been a
topic of great concern at recent
group meetings. McCall said bad
publicity from publications including
the Daily is one of the major causes
of SCRIP'S faltering image.
SCRIP member Todd Bauman said
we've been misrepresented out of
ignorance on their (the Daily's) part. I
understand that the Daily works
under a lot of time pressure, but they
have not always portrayed our posi
tion accurately to the students." «
Despite "bad press," however, the
spokespersons said they felt SCRIP'S
image has been changed rather than
hurt. According to McCall, the
change is the result of a loss of
idealism and a more realistic at
titude.
