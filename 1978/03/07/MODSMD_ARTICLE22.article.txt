## 'Music of the utmost authenticity' 
### 
Quadro Hottetere is a seri
ous ensemble. At their per
formance in Dinkelspiel last
Friday they distinguished
themselves by the passion, sol
idity and sheer intellectual
force of their playing. This is
also reflected in their basic
musicological approach.
The Dutch group, formed in
1969 while its members were
still conservatory students,
specializes in early eighteenth
century French and early
seventeenth century Italian
and English music. They pay
special attention to historical
performance practice. Their
instruments are either authen

tic or careful reconstructions
thereof, and are tuned to
Baroque pitches. In addition
they carefully observe the
nuances of style: the bril
liance, virtuosity and opulence
of the English and Italian
works, and the intimacy and
detailed ornamentation of the
French music. The result is
music of the utmost authentic
ity.
Careful
The Quadro's playing is
equally carefully thought out.
The group achieves a remarka
ble fusion of its four instru
ments (two alto or soprano re
corders, harpsichord, violon
cello) creating a sound almost
like a small chamber orchestra.
My only objection here was in
the way Wauter Mollor kept his
cello in the background.
While he did provide excellent
continuo, one wishes he had

shown the beautiful, singing
voice of his instrument some
more.
The program started with
three symphonies by Henry
Purcell (1659-1695). These
works showed the primary
weakness of Quadro, in that
the solemnity and heaviness of
their style can crush less seri
ous music. However, in Suite
No. 1 from The Broken Con
sort" by Matthew Locke (1630-
77) the group really gained
ground, finding a work suitably
dignified, and succeeding in
expressing more the lighter
elements of the work.
Astringent
The highlight of this part of
the program were the "Two in
Nomine Fantasias" for
harpsichord solo of )ohn Bull
(1503-1628) played by Bob van
Asperen. These works seem
amazingly modern in their

often astringent harmonies
and their dense, polyrythmic
writing. The first unfolds
slowly from a monotonous mo
tive which gradually picks up
speed and intensity over jar
ring, motoric but unstable
rythmic patterns.
The second proceeds simi
larly from a majestic choral-like
motive in its biting cerebral
way. These two works were
eminently suited to the equally
cerebral playing of Asperen.
The first half of the program
concluded with "Due Canzone
per Due Canti col Basso" by
Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583-
1643) and with the "Trio Sonata
in G" by Vivaldi. Both were
competently performed, with
the cellist really making him
self heard in the "Vivaldi."
Still, I would have wished
somewhat more brilliance and

virtuosity in the latter.
The true climax of the even
ing came after the intermission
with "Suite No. 4" by Marin
Marais (1656-1728). This is a
truly courtly piece of music. Its
solemnity, dignity, and stateli
ness were beautifully brought
out by the Quadro, especially
in the elegiac ' Autre-plainte"
which concludes the work. Fi
nally, the concert ended with
three "Fantasias" by John Hil
ton (1599-1657). These are spi
rited works written in a charac
teristic alternation of fast and
slow tempos.
All in all it was an exquisite
performance. The intensity,
profundity and attention to de
tail were heartfelt and genuine.
If Quadro Hotteterre can learn
to add more spirit and good
humor then their playing will
be perfection.
