If you feel like you're missing
out by not being onstage, try a
comedy and mime theatre.
You don't have to be the per
former to find excitement; all
you need is to be in the audi
ence, and it's up to the come
dian to involve you in the
show. No more sitting som
berly, watching the actors pre
tend you're not there. Come
dians want you there. They
confide, fantasize, and play di-

For the encore, Giovanni bounded onto the
platform and allowed the audience the
choices; 'all right, what do you want to see
overt'

rectly with the audience.
The Great American Music
Hall knows the meaning of
thrilling entertainment, and it
recently featured two
graduates of the Bay Area com
edy scene: Jim Giovanni and
Robin Williams. They both star
in the new "Laugh-in" show,
but whenever either gets a
chance to go north, he is sure
to visit the S.F. clubs.
Giovanni, warmup for the
evening, gave a solid impres
sion of multi
impersonationism. His reputa
tion accredits him with 116 im
personations under his belt,
and more elsewhere. That
eveningthey were poppingout
of his prop trunk in the guise of
various hats and hairpieces,
coming to life on his contorted
face.
He twisted into a perfect Paul
Newman, a beautifully assholic
Jack Nicholson, and a Jimmy
Carter who says,"I may be
smiling, but I'm in agonizing
pain right now." Rolling his
eyes excruciatingly, "I stepped
on a beer can in the shower this
morning."
Although his impersona
tions are accurate, Giovanni
doesn't have enough spicy
material. The exception was his
ape, squatted under an open
upside-down beer bottle.

Doused to the tune of 2001, he
stood up and shouted, "God,
you're so ugly you could stick
your face in dough and make
King Kong cookies."
For the encore, Giovanni
bounded onto the platform
and allowed the audience the
choice, "All right, what do you
want to see over?"
This was just an inkling of the
show to come. Robin Williams
rubbed indelible laughter all

over his audience, reducing
their bodies to guivering ec
toplasm and molding their
humor until it jelled with his.
He sustained this relation
ship for more than an hour of
relentless comedy, all the
while directing the tempo until
he mounted hilarity to a dou
ble climax.
Williams drew on himself as
if he were the mad artist, cast
ing himself in whatever role he
pleased. He shaped himself
with both bright and drab
characters, but he was always

brilliantly life-like.
He opened the set in a horrid
Russian accent, with all the vis
uals. "I want to show you
something I'm very proud of
...move back," he warned.
His abrupt hand reached for
his zipper, but he glanced out
at the crowd and stopped,
"just kidding, not that way."
In recompense he offered to
do a "Superman on drugs."
But before he could get to that,
he blurted out The Hormone
Blues." (In a deep voice)
"Went to bed last night with
hair on my chest," (high

pitched) "Woke up this morn
ing with two beautiful
breasts."
"Just testing your bounds of
good taste," as he promised to
get on with Superman. Honest
in the face of reality, he wan
dered over to his props and
gave them a shake.
"Just checking funny things
here." He snatched up a pair of
razor thin red glasses and held
them at a weird angle in front
of his face.
"Picasso." He slipped them
on and became a brief punk,
thrashing the mike.
Superman not forgotten, he
lay chest-up on a chair and flew
backwards to the cry of "Hiyo,
Silver."
Williams felt a call for
Shakespearian drama and went
behind the piano to prepare.
He mimed a descending stair
case and hobbled into view on
his knees to expose his tric
kery.
He went on and on until he
couldn't stand the way the
spectators' necks craned up
ward to catch every detail. No
more stage for him. Williams
shouted jokes from every
corner of the room. From the
back of the hall he pointed to

in recompense he offered to do 'Superman
on drugs/ but before he could get to that he
blurted out 'The Hormone Blues/

the front. "Now those are the
shitty seats."
He went wild with energy
and the audience went out of
control. He began to improvise
with everything from the
he spoke to the spectators
themselves.
And the show went on â€” up
in the balcony, then back on
stage as an old man with his
memory on hold. And more.
An encore. Until a sighing
breath exhaled a farewell from
the audience's aching lungs;
all together now, a standing
ovation.
