## Hubert grows ever slicker 
### 
Hubert Laws has changed
record labels again — as far
as I'm concerned that qual
ifies as a near-exciting fact.
Being, as he is, the world's
finest jazz flautist, and be
ing, as there are, considera
ble differences between his
old label and his new one, it
should be worthwhile to
give some time to what
looks to be a major change
in Hubert Laws' direction.
It used to be that Hubert
ran with the heavies from
CTI. CTI is the limosine jazz
label, one known for its
close-to-overweight artistic
elegance and album covers
With CTI Hubert had
played heavily orches
trated, usually controlled
jazz, stuff not conceptually
different from that which
had been featured on the
records put out by everyone
else working with the
group.
But there were differ
ences, not the least of which
was directly a function of
Laws' strong classical
background. With CTI ar
tists had a tendency to fall
victim to overproduction;
Laws, though, had more
than the strength and
background required ot
one who hopes to escape
such a fate. Where people
such as Turrentine got stuck
in an overly funky rut,
Hubert combined classical
themes and constructions
with simultaneous control
and fire. He played a jazz
version of "The Rites of
Spring," and he managed
without bastardizing the
material to give potentially
constricted solo moments
treatments that were sue

cessful as improvization.
Needless to say — as
Claude Boiling and lean-
Pierre Rampal will no doubt
testify — that isn't easy.
Hubert Laws' success at
blending classical music
and jazz was a result of his
ability to know when to stop
fooling with his material as
much as it was the product
of any kind of fire; with CTI
it was his brains that made
him the pick of the organi
zation.
But Hubert Laws has
changed labels; this was
evident in his recent con
cert at the Berkeley Com
munity Theater. There he
played selections taken
primarily from his recent
Columbia album, and from
one soon to be released.
And there was less of the
kind of fusion that I had
learned to associate him
with.
For the most part Laws did
music rooted in the kind of
slickly regular disco sounds
that dominate today's jazz
market.
Hubert, of course, played
it all as well as anyone could
have expected — yet some
how he seemed unable to
provide what he gave when
he played the old style. Be
fore we could count on
pieces that were for the
large part separate and dis
tinct, but now it was up to
the soloist to distinguish
each tune from the rest.
He's certainly capable of
doing that, and he had his
moments in Berkeley. But if
Hubert i>> going to stay with
his new style it will be hard
for him to go halfway.
