China's Hua blasts U.S.-Taiwan ties
Tokyo — Hua Kuo-feng, newly confirmed as China's
supreme leader, has told the national parliament in Pek
ing that the American attitude on the Taiwan issue re
mains the chief obstacle to establishing full U.S.-
Chinese diplomatic relations.
Hua outlined to the fifth National People's Congress
an intensive 10-year plan for modernizing China's
' backward" basic industries.
The congress, meeting for the first time in three years,
renamed Hua as China's premier, a post he will continue
to hold concurrently with the chairmanship of the
Communist Party.
Hua reiterated China's long-held position that
Washington must break its diplomatic links with
Nationalist Taiwan, scrap its defense treaty and with
draw its remaining troops from the island.
China will surely liberate Taiwan but how and when it
does so is the domestic affair of China," Hua said.
Radio Peking, monitored in Tokyo, said Hua also
warned of the potential for war between the Soviet
Union and the United States and declared, "The Soviet
revisionists are bent on subjugating our country."
He urged the Chinese to embark on "a race against
time" to strengthen themselves economically and
militarily against possible Soviet or American aggres
sion, the broadcast said.
Hua has pledged to transform China into a modern
industrial country by the year 2000.
Israelis halt settlement campaign
Tel Aviv, Israel — The Israeli government seems likely
to halt the settlement campaign on occupied territory
\vhile Middle East peace talks are under way.
This assessment comet; from Israeli political sources,
one week before Prime Minister Menachem Begin is to
travel to Washington for talks with President Jimmy Car
ter.
Begin's ruling Likud bloc is in disarray over the settle
ment issue, and his Cabinet is split under the weight of
American protests that the settlements hinder peace by
offending the Arabs.
The Israeli media accuses Begin of confusing the pub
lic. The Labor Party, which Likud vanquished in the May
1977 election, is back on its feet and hoping Begin will
make a mistake that would bring down his government.
Soviet dissidents placed in asylums
London — Fourteen dissidents who complained about
their bosses have been confined to psychiatric asylums
in the Soviet Union since January 1977, Amnesty Interna
tional said yesterday.

The London-based human rights organization said it
made the estimate after receiving new material from two
major Soviet sources in recent months.
Last year the World Psychiatric Association con
demned the practice and singled out the Soviet Union
for using the method of containing dissidents. The
agency also criticized the persecution of Soviet citizens
trying to expose the abuses.

Yugoslavia to Moscow's camp, the Carter administration
has been discussing a "modest expansion" of U.S. milit
ary sales with Yugoslav officials.
