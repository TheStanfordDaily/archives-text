TheASSU lost only $2070 during
a one-year period, from Sep
tember 1976 to August 1977, not
$26,000 as reported in yesterday's
Daily.
The Daily regrets the error.
ASSU losses resulted from two
areas, projects budgeting and of
fice budgeting. Out of gross re
venues in ASSU projects budget
ing totaling $775,000, the ASSU
budgeted within $973. The re
mainder of the deficit resulted
from office budget losses.
Bill Lape, associate financial
manager, said, "It's pretty good
that the ASSU as a whole can
come that close."

According to Lape, the ASSU
runs on a break-even budget,
"Each individual project is in
tended to break-even." It varies
every year as to whether the ASSU
will make or lose money, but over
the long-run what matters is that
the ASSU breaks-even, Lape said.
Ideally, each project is to run
according to the budget proposed
at the beginning of the fiscal year.
This is not always possible but
often certain projects earn more
than expected, which helps to
offset any losses, Lape said.
Last year, although the Flicks
lost about $9000 the Travel Service
earned about $15,000, which
helped offset the loss.
