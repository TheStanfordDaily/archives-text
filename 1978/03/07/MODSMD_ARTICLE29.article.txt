# 'Super-savers' nip ASSU charters
## 
### Jonathan Slater 
During the last fiscal year the ASSU Travel Service ran a
surplus of more than $15,000. Of all other ASSU
controlled projects, only revenues for Lecture Notes
exceeded expenses by even half that much, according to
the latest financial statement.
This year, however, the Travel Service is just trying to
break even.
The advent of super-saver" fares by commercial air
lines offering savings of up to 45 per cent from regular
rates has significantly hindered this year's charter sales,
according to Brek Walker, Travel Service manager.
Because student charters are responsible for approx
imately 90 per cent of the Travel Service's business the
Travel Service is the greatest income producer for the
ASSU, the status of both the Travel Service and other
ASSU projects is in a precarious position.
Both Walker and ASSU Associate Financial Manager
Bill Lape expressed concern over this problem, but said
they have confidence in efforts to compensate for this
potential lack of revenue.
The Travel Service has traditionally operated charters
four times each year: a fall charter from New York for
incoming freshmen, charters to major cities during
Christmas break, a Hawaiian charter over spring break,
and one-way return charters to Chicago and New York in
lune.
Charter prices have always been low enough in com
parison to commercial fares to offset the inconvenience
of the late night hours which characterize Stanford char
ters, according to Walker. An open bar serves as another
feature which adds appeal to the flights, he said.
Yet without the opportunity for financial savings by
students, the Stanford Christmas charter may be a thing
of the past.
For example, the round trip charter fare to New York
was $215 during Christmas while the "super-saver" fare
on United Air Lines was $244. In order to qualify for this
"super-saver" a passenger must reserve and pay for a
flight 30 days in advance.
Airlines are now petitioning the Civil Aeronautics
Board (CAB) for permission to extend the super-saver

fares to all out-of-state flights. If approved by the CAB,
this request will become effective March 28.
Concerning the future, Walker said, "We'll keep fly
ing charters until it's not best to do so." But he added,
"It's going to be a real problem. Charter costs are in
creasing — the super-saver fare is really going to hurt
us."
The Travel Service has already cut down operations
which has damaged it financially, having lost deposits
which are required a year in advance, according to
Walker.
'Last Christmas it was forced to reduce service from
eight charters to five.
Even sales for this spring's Hawaiian charter are not
proceeding well. As of last week the charter was approx
imately 30 seats below the break-even level for the 259
seat DC-10, Walker said.
However, there is a feeling among Travel Service and
ASSU authorities that the role of the service will be
considerably toned down from a $459,000 operation —
its total revenues for 1977.
Walker predicts that the service will continue to pro
vide one-way charters at the beginning of fall and end of
spring quarters. He said the service is considering ad
ding a Christmas charter to Hawaii.
The service will also continue to offer charter oppor
tunities to Europe and the other travel-orientated items
including, Eurail Passes and International Student I.D.
cards, for which it receives a direct commission. These
activities comprise about 10 per cent of the Travel Ser
vice's sales, Walker said.
The question remains as to the impact future revenue
reductions will have upon the ASSU, which in the past
has looked to the Travel Service for a large portion of the
projects' budget.
"In the past the Travel Service has kept the other
projects afloat," Lape said.
Without the prospect of a $15,000 surplus produced
by the Travel Service, something will have to be done
with the 11 ASSU-operated projects which lost a com
bined total of $973 in the 1977 fiscal year, Lape said.
Lape said he is confident something will be done.
