# S. African investments hit at CIR forum
## 
### 
Over 30 speakers called for University divest
ment of stocks in companies doing business in
South Africa at a public forum last night sponsored
by the Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR). No one spoke in favor of the University's
investments.
"Investment in South Africa is investment in
apartheid and is thus immoral, exploitative and
unjust," said a speaker from South Africa.
"Today all black organizations are calling for
total withdrawal of investments. U.S. investments
have not bettered the lot of blacks in South Af
rica," she added.
A line of Stanford Committee for a Responsible
Investment Policy (SCRIP) members spoke at the
forum, each presenting their views on a different
aspect of the divestment issue.
The students used a variety of statistics to exp
lain the low economic and social status of blacks in
South Africa.
"Some people claim that the general economic
development which U.S. corporations bring to
South Africa is bound to liberalize apartheid. But
facts which have emerged over the recent years
have suggested just the opposite," said SCRIP
member Stuart Ozer. ' As industry there has ex
panded, so has the technical sophistication for
managing and channeling the African labor force.

The coercive and manipulative apparatus of apar
theid has grown strong,"' Ozer said.
Other speakers addressed the question of the
costs of divestment.
There's no doubt that divestment will cost the
University something. However, too often,
academics put higher education on a pedestal and
use academic freedom to set the University off
from the rest of society," Lloyd Dixon, SCRIP
member, said.
We cannot put the ends of higher education
before the means used to achieve them. Perhaps
we should think of divestment as an operating
expense just like the expense of any other prog
ram at this University," he added.
Speakers also pointed to universities around the
country which have divested.
Eighty-eight campuses in 23 states have groups
demanding yes" votes on proxy issues and di
vestment of university holdings in corporations
doing business with South Africa, SCRIP member
Margaret Coud, noted.
Raymond Giraud spoke about a petition signed
by 238 faculty members last May and submitted to
the President of the Board of Trustees calling for
withdrawal.
This is the only substantial group of faculty to
take a position on this issue. There has been no

comparable grouping of faculty to say that they
oppose shareholder policies," Giraud said.
Giraud also said, speaking directly to the CIR
members, "I suggest that if any group comes be
fore you and says I believe in this progressive
force' idea you stop them right there and say Let
us have the evidence.' Until they produce plausi
ble evidence, I encourage you to dismiss them
immediately."
The ASSU Council of Presidents (COP) were
represented by Anne Henkels and Steve Westley.
Fred Crethel, Chairperson of the ASSU Senate,
explained why the Senate does not formally
acknowledge the CIR.
Several students also commented on the fact
that no member of the Board of Trustees attended
the forum.
The trustees have shown they are not in
terested, or that they do not really care," one
student said.
I find it a little puzzling that none of the trus
tees was able to find the time to come and speak
here tonight," the student added. The CIR
should not be too concerned with criticism if they
do decide on divestment because the trustee
members have obviously shown somewhat of a
lack of interest."

doing business with South Africa, SCRIP member
Margaret Coud, noted.
Raymond Giraud spoke about a petition signed
by 238 faculty members last May and submitted to
the President of the Board of Trustees calling for
withdrawal.
This is the only substantial group of faculty to
take a position on this issue. There has been no

comparable grouping of faculty to say that they
oppose shareholder policies," Giraud said.
Giraud also said, speaking directly to the CIR
members, "I suggest that if any group comes be
fore you and says I believe in this progressive
force' idea you stop them right there and say Let
us have the evidence.' Until they produce plausi
ble evidence, I encourage you to dismiss them
immediately."
The ASSU Council of Presidents (COP) were
represented by Anne Henkels and Steve Westley.
Fred Crethel, Chairperson of the ASSU Senate,
explained why the Senate does not formally
acknowledge the CIR.
Several students also commented on the fact
that no member of the Board of Trustees attended
the forum.
The trustees have shown they are not in
terested, or that they do not really care," one
student said.
I find it a little puzzling that none of the trus
tees was able to find the time to come and speak
here tonight," the student added. The CIR
should not be too concerned with criticism if they
do decide on divestment because the trustee
members have obviously shown somewhat of a
lack of interest."
Over 30 speakers called for University divest
ment of stocks in companies doing business in
South Africa at a public forum last night sponsored
by the Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR). No one spoke in favor of the University's
investments.
"Investment in South Africa is investment in
apartheid and is thus immoral, exploitative and
unjust," said a speaker from South Africa.
"Today all black organizations are calling for
total withdrawal of investments. U.S. investments
have not bettered the lot of blacks in South Af
rica," she added.
A line of Stanford Committee for a Responsible
Investment Policy (SCRIP) members spoke at the
forum, each presenting their views on a different
aspect of the divestment issue.
The students used a variety of statistics to exp
lain the low economic and social status of blacks in
South Africa.
"Some people claim that the general economic
development which U.S. corporations bring to
South Africa is bound to liberalize apartheid. But
facts which have emerged over the recent years
have suggested just the opposite," said SCRIP
member Stuart Ozer. ' As industry there has ex
panded, so has the technical sophistication for
managing and channeling the African labor force.

The coercive and manipulative apparatus of apar
theid has grown strong,"' Ozer said.
Other speakers addressed the question of the
costs of divestment.
There's no doubt that divestment will cost the
University something. However, too often,
academics put higher education on a pedestal and
use academic freedom to set the University off
from the rest of society," Lloyd Dixon, SCRIP
member, said.
We cannot put the ends of higher education
before the means used to achieve them. Perhaps
we should think of divestment as an operating
expense just like the expense of any other prog
ram at this University," he added.
Speakers also pointed to universities around the
country which have divested.
Eighty-eight campuses in 23 states have groups
demanding yes" votes on proxy issues and di
vestment of university holdings in corporations
doing business with South Africa, SCRIP member
Margaret Coud, noted.
