# Taft-Hartley invoked in coal mine dispute
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter,
declaring the country "cannot afford to wait
any longer" for a coal strike settlement, in
voked theTaft-Hartley Act yesterday in an effort
to force miners back to work.
Carter made the announcement after the
striking miners voted overwhelmingly in
weekend balloting against a proposed three
year contract that would have settled the prot
racted strike.
As one reason for their rejection, miners
cited a contract provision requiring them to pay
deductibles of up to $700 for health care that
has been free. Opponents also objected to a
provision giving coal companies the authority
to fire wildcat strike leaders and pickets.
Mine owners hoped imposition of the Taft-
Hartley Act would work. United Mine Workers
(UMW) President Arnold Miller had said earlier
he didn't like it but would go along with it. And
initial reaction from the miners was mixed.
Carter asserted that negotiations between
the striking United Mine Workers union and
thecoal industry were at an impasse. He said he
was directing Attorney General Griffin Bell to

make preparations for seeking an 80-day back
to-work order under terms of the Taft-Hartley
Act.
The strike by some 160,000 UMW members,
which enters its fourth month today, has forced
power curtailments and resultant job layoffs in
the Midwest and is threatening to inflict further
harm on the economy.
Carter announced creation of a three
member board of inquiry, as required under
the Taft-Hartley Act, and the panel made plans
to hold a public hearing on the strike tomor
row.
Board Chairman John Gentry, a Washington
lawyer and former deputy assistant secretary of
Labor, said about 5000 Mailgrams had been sent
to union and industry officials as well as other
interested parties, inviting them to appear at
the hearing.
Gentry noted that under the law the board
must prepare a report for the president before
the government can go to court. Carter said he
expected the board to issue its report quickly.
In another development, Army staff officers

were reviewing a civil disturbance control plan,
but Pentagon officials said federal troops would
be used in the coal strike crisis only as a very last
resort.
The Taft-Hartley Act was passed in 1947 over a
veto by President Harry Truman and has been
used by presidents on 34 other occasions.
In resorting to Taft-Hartley, Carter said he
wanted to make sure the country did not fall
victim to ' total breakdown of the collective
bargaining" process.
Reaction to Carter's announcement came
swiftly from the Bituminous Coal Operators As
sociation (BCOA), the industry-wide bargain
ing group.
We are extremely disappointed that the
UMW members have rejected the contract
their bargaining council had agreed to and that
the government also considered favorable to
the miners," the BCOA said.
' We hope the imposition of Taft-Hartley will
be as contemplated by the statute so that the
nation may regain badly needed production of
coal for the American people," it added.

We are extremely disappointed that the
UMW members have rejected the contract
their bargaining council had agreed to and that
the government also considered favorable to
the miners," the BCOA said.

coal for the American people," it added.
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter,
declaring the country "cannot afford to wait
any longer" for a coal strike settlement, in
voked theTaft-Hartley Act yesterday in an effort
to force miners back to work.
Carter made the announcement after the
striking miners voted overwhelmingly in
weekend balloting against a proposed three
year contract that would have settled the prot
racted strike.
As one reason for their rejection, miners
cited a contract provision requiring them to pay
deductibles of up to $700 for health care that
has been free. Opponents also objected to a
provision giving coal companies the authority
to fire wildcat strike leaders and pickets.
Mine owners hoped imposition of the Taft-
Hartley Act would work. United Mine Workers
(UMW) President Arnold Miller had said earlier
he didn't like it but would go along with it. And
initial reaction from the miners was mixed.
Carter asserted that negotiations between
the striking United Mine Workers union and
thecoal industry were at an impasse. He said he
was directing Attorney General Griffin Bell to

make preparations for seeking an 80-day back
to-work order under terms of the Taft-Hartley
Act.
The strike by some 160,000 UMW members,
which enters its fourth month today, has forced
power curtailments and resultant job layoffs in
the Midwest and is threatening to inflict further
harm on the economy.
Carter announced creation of a three
member board of inquiry, as required under
the Taft-Hartley Act, and the panel made plans
to hold a public hearing on the strike tomor
row.
Board Chairman John Gentry, a Washington
lawyer and former deputy assistant secretary of
Labor, said about 5000 Mailgrams had been sent
to union and industry officials as well as other
interested parties, inviting them to appear at
the hearing.
Gentry noted that under the law the board
must prepare a report for the president before
the government can go to court. Carter said he
expected the board to issue its report quickly.
In another development, Army staff officers

were reviewing a civil disturbance control plan,
but Pentagon officials said federal troops would
be used in the coal strike crisis only as a very last
resort.
The Taft-Hartley Act was passed in 1947 over a
veto by President Harry Truman and has been
used by presidents on 34 other occasions.
In resorting to Taft-Hartley, Carter said he
wanted to make sure the country did not fall
victim to ' total breakdown of the collective
bargaining" process.
Reaction to Carter's announcement came
swiftly from the Bituminous Coal Operators As
sociation (BCOA), the industry-wide bargain
ing group.
We are extremely disappointed that the
UMW members have rejected the contract
their bargaining council had agreed to and that
the government also considered favorable to
the miners," the BCOA said.
' We hope the imposition of Taft-Hartley will
be as contemplated by the statute so that the
nation may regain badly needed production of
coal for the American people," it added.
