# Arabs and Israelis arranging dialogue
## 
### John Timpane News analysis 
In the face of opposition from organized student
groups, a small number of private students is holding
meetings designed to bring Arabs and Israelis into some
kind of dialogue.
"It started out as a social thing," says Moshe Aelion of
the Israeli Students Organization. "It started out of a
desire on the part of a few people to talk to each other,
and that's how it stands right now. Maybe it could grow,
but there are many things in the way."
Recent peace talks between Egypt and Israel have in
creased interest in a campus dialogue. But Arab students
fear reprisals from their governments and ostracism
from the Arab Students Organization.
Sarah Alfadl, an Arab student, said, "It's really sublim
inal peer pressure. When you know people won't talk to
you, that you will be excluded from meetings and par
ties, or when you hear people talking behind your back,
you tend to change your mind."
"In the eyes of many Arabs, we are extremists," said
Ragui Assaad. "For them, speaking to Israelis is the same
as collaborating with them."
Emotions and extremism run high on both sides, and

often prevent any useful discussion. Students who con
sider Sadat a traitor and think Israel is out to destroy
them refuse to meet, as do those Israelis who think the
Arab states simply want Israel's destruction. "Much has
been done in the Middle East, but we need so much
more," says Assaad.
In general, those involved in the meetings feel disap
pointment about their reception. "It's disillusioning,"
Alfadl said. "We find out how little they know, and how
many difficulties there are to understand them."
Israeli student Ehud Miron said, "It's disappointing
when you say you want to talk and no one expresses any
willingness. The frustrating thing is, we see how close
we can really be, like two boxers hugging each other
after the fight. Friendship is too much to ask, but we can
have some long-term goals between us."
Meanwhile, tne private meetings will continue with or
without sanction.
"Any kind of activity — cultural or social, even — is
more than welcome," Aelion said.
"The point is to encourage debate by educating
people. Israelis need to learn that there are many kinds
of Arabs with many viewpoints, and Arabs in turn need
to learn more about Israelis," Alfadl said.
