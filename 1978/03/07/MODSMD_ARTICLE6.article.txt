# Problems in communicating

Communicating can be the critical
factor between life and extinction in
today's society. That may seem a
rather uninteresting and, perhaps,
even obnoxious remark until one
realizes how many people and
groups have failed to communicate.
For instance, recently the 34 per
cent of Burundi's population that was
wiped out by the ruling Tutsi tribe
failed to communicate to the rest of
the world. The ruling tribe carried
out its genocide with French military
advisors and material, to the extent
that frequently the French piloted
the planes in their attacks against
Hutu populations.
Had the minority tribe succeeded
in getting world attention to their
problem, 80-100,000 (conservatively
estimated) of them would not have
been murdered.
For instance, had the opponents to
the Shah of Iran been more success
ful in communicating with the out
side world, government troops may
not have machine-gunned students
protesting outside Tehran University
a couple of months ago. Nor might
many others suspected of opposing
the Shah have been mistreated or
tortured in Iranian prisons.
Perhaps, if they were more effec
tive in communicating, the United
States might not tolerate harrass
ment of its citizens (of Iranian extrac
tion) by the Iranian secret police.
For instant e.it the illegal aliens"
from Mexico were more effective at
communicating with influential
groups, Americans might not toler
ate ilk intimidation, extortion and
sub-human treatment these immig
rants receive at the hands of im
moral, unethical people in California
and elsewhere.
At this juncture let me make three
points.
First, I believe there is a rather
widespread misconception by some
people (notably those who are in dis
advantaged positions in society â€”
that in itself being partially cause as
well as effect) that simply bringing
publicity to an outrageous situation
is somehow going to cure it. I would
suggest that it is the content, as well
as the volumes of the publicity that
brings about changes. However the
general reaction most people have to

assorted outrages is complete inac
tion. An injustice, to all but a (gener
ally powerless) crusading few, is
rarely cause enough by itself to
prompt remedial action.
Second, groups about to be (or
currently being) stomped on by the
nasties, screaming at the top of their
collective voices, generally perceive
the inaction by the influential as
callous or worse (e.g. cries of "ra
cist," "sexist," "imperialist,"
"capitalist," etc.) And while this may
be very effective in gaining the sym
pathy of other disadvantaged/
minority groups, it is probably coun
terproductive in gaining aid from the
influential of our society.
To point out the obvious (an unre
warding occupation, I might paren
thetically remark) minority groups
have their own jargon and protest
style. Anyone can recognize it, and
since most influential (i.e. white,
uppermiddle class or wealthy,
middle-aged males) tend to associate
this rhetoric style with past hostile
experiences, many will automatically
assume a conflict posture, or ignore
it. Similarly, at this point protest
marches only remind influential of
past difficulties. and so they ignore
them.
Put another way, an ethnic/non
majority group ought, perhaps, not
to compound its inherent communi
cations problems by adopting a
counterproductive persuasive style.
Third, since assaulted groups do
such a poor job in communicating,
there is a need to "search out" such
news by individuals and the media.
For instance, I did not happen
upon the holocaust in Burundi (or
similar events in Rwanda, or Zaire in
past years) through Time magazine,
and its ilk; they had nothing to say on
the matter. I simply happened across
it while I was running down a ques
tion prompted by the recent South
Africa protests.
By the way, I should observe that
communications problems are not,
of course, confined to the down
and-out, but also to the high-and
mighty. To comment on a recent
example, the one thing that struck
me when Milton Friedman spoke
here recently, was that during the
question period afterwards he spent

most of his time explaining to people
that he largely agreed with them.
In conclusion I have two remarks
to make.
First, is something I have main
tained in the face of strong disag
reement: cohesive large groups do
not really exist (such as "the influen
tials"). (Hmm, do I see smiles on
some faces?) They will behave fun
damentally as individuals if they are
treated as individuals. So, if a found
ering group of individuals calls for
help, they should not expect another
group of individuals called "the con
cerned public" to come rushing to
their aid, unless their appeal is
geared to each member of the pub
lic's sense of empathy.
Second, as a few people are of the
opinion that I am a nasty reactionary
(although I don't believe I am) I
thought I would appropriately end
with a statement by the chairman of a
major New York public relations firm
I happened to work for last summer.
The chairman (who I happen to have
a great respect for) was of the opin
ion that the real task to be ac
complished to persuade people was
to simply get them to see one
another's (note pivotal word) true
situations. Just stating positions did
little good.
