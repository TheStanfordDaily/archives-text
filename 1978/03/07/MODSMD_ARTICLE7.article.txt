# Article plays on sexism

Simone de Beauvoir House

As members of the Stanford community, we are out
raged at the Daily article (Feb. 21) on a Playboy photo
grapher currently in the Stanford area. The bulk of this
person's thinking nauseates the feminist community.
Beyond an attempt to respond to the statements quoted
in the article, we wish to raise a few issues about Playboy
and its portrayal of women's and men's sex roles.
David Ansley, in his interview with the photographer,
plays upon every sexist image of women which per
meates our male-dominated society. In the Playboy
photographer's opinion, women are nothing more than
sexual objects consisting of "sensuous eyes, nose and
mouth," — mere pieces of flesh, requiring much
grooming" in order to grace the pages of Playboy. This
kind of emphasis on a woman's exterior implies that
women are nothing more than superficial, decorative
specimens to be enjoyed by men.
Viewing women in such a manner denies the exis
tence of female intelligence and depth, and thus directly
contradicts any thoughtful notion of liberation. To de
fine today's liberated woman as "one who is having fun
and doing what she wants" serves Playboy's purpose of
rationalizing sexual objectification in assuming that a
liberated woman's values fall in line with Playboy's.
Understanding the phallicies (pun intended) of
Playboy's reasoning requires examination of the nature
of Playboy Inc., as an institution. For in the very process of
portraying women primarily as the play objects of "fun
loving" males, Playboy functions as one of the perpet
rators of the sexist ideology which prevails in our cul
ture. In the middle of what Playboy thinks of as "merely
providing the consumers with what they want," it also
creates a market for its consumers.
Exploitation
Surely Playboy did not invent the exploitation of wo
men, breast fetishism or the focus on sex as the ultimate
thrill. These existed long before Gutenburg, much less
Playboy Press. Playboy has contributed substantially,
however, to the extremes of sexual alienation which are
exhibited in present capitalist societies by reinforcing

the link between sexuality and consumption.
Hugh Hefner does not publish Playboy because it
pleases him to titillate the minions. He does so because
Playboy is enormously profitable in a large and growing
market for his product. This profit comes about because
Hefner's meat" products sell clothing, stereos, sports
cars and the proper" Scotch to a larger share of the
market than do similar merchandising avenues that lack
the explicitness of the sex-consumption connection
which Hef's vehicle provides.
One cannot make love to beings who have been pre
sented as pieces of flesh. One cannot be free to love
until the images of exploited sexuality are dissolved.
And sexuality employed for the commercial end of mar
keting products designed for playboys" is necessarily
segmented, distorted, objectified and alienated. It is
this objectification of a woman's body and the distortion
of sexuality that feminists rightfully decry in Playboy —
not some "truth-beauty" that supposedly emerges in an
air-brushed, retouched photo in Playboy.
Daily wrong
Last, we are dismayed at the position that the Daily
takes in this issue. We welcome the honest presentation
of news which is important to the whole community and
has been reported with a critical awareness of all aspects
of the issue.
But at times, as in Ansley's article, the Daily follows the
tendency of the American mass-media in isolating trivial
news events and capitalizing on them to attract attention
and to promote its own sales. Ansley, by quoting the
absurd revelations of a Playboy photographer so heavily,
pays obeisance to the exploitive intentions of the
Playboy enterprise.
Does the Stanford community need sensationalism so
tacitly condoning sexploitation? Does the Daily need to
do this in order to provoke interest in its uninspired
product?

the link between sexuality and consumption.
Hugh Hefner does not publish Playboy because it
pleases him to titillate the minions. He does so because
Playboy is enormously profitable in a large and growing
market for his product. This profit comes about because
Hefner's meat" products sell clothing, stereos, sports
cars and the proper" Scotch to a larger share of the
market than do similar merchandising avenues that lack
the explicitness of the sex-consumption connection
which Hef's vehicle provides.
One cannot make love to beings who have been pre
sented as pieces of flesh. One cannot be free to love
until the images of exploited sexuality are dissolved.
And sexuality employed for the commercial end of mar
keting products designed for playboys" is necessarily
segmented, distorted, objectified and alienated. It is
this objectification of a woman's body and the distortion
of sexuality that feminists rightfully decry in Playboy —
not some "truth-beauty" that supposedly emerges in an
air-brushed, retouched photo in Playboy.
Daily wrong
Last, we are dismayed at the position that the Daily
takes in this issue. We welcome the honest presentation
of news which is important to the whole community and
has been reported with a critical awareness of all aspects
of the issue.
But at times, as in Ansley's article, the Daily follows the
tendency of the American mass-media in isolating trivial
news events and capitalizing on them to attract attention
and to promote its own sales. Ansley, by quoting the
absurd revelations of a Playboy photographer so heavily,
pays obeisance to the exploitive intentions of the
Playboy enterprise.
Does the Stanford community need sensationalism so
tacitly condoning sexploitation? Does the Daily need to
do this in order to provoke interest in its uninspired
product?

As members of the Stanford community, we are out
raged at the Daily article (Feb. 21) on a Playboy photo
grapher currently in the Stanford area. The bulk of this
person's thinking nauseates the feminist community.
Beyond an attempt to respond to the statements quoted
in the article, we wish to raise a few issues about Playboy
and its portrayal of women's and men's sex roles.
David Ansley, in his interview with the photographer,
plays upon every sexist image of women which per
meates our male-dominated society. In the Playboy
photographer's opinion, women are nothing more than
sexual objects consisting of "sensuous eyes, nose and
mouth," — mere pieces of flesh, requiring much
grooming" in order to grace the pages of Playboy. This
kind of emphasis on a woman's exterior implies that
women are nothing more than superficial, decorative
specimens to be enjoyed by men.
Viewing women in such a manner denies the exis
tence of female intelligence and depth, and thus directly
contradicts any thoughtful notion of liberation. To de
fine today's liberated woman as "one who is having fun
and doing what she wants" serves Playboy's purpose of
rationalizing sexual objectification in assuming that a
liberated woman's values fall in line with Playboy's.
Understanding the phallicies (pun intended) of
Playboy's reasoning requires examination of the nature
of Playboy Inc., as an institution. For in the very process of
portraying women primarily as the play objects of "fun
loving" males, Playboy functions as one of the perpet
rators of the sexist ideology which prevails in our cul
ture. In the middle of what Playboy thinks of as "merely
providing the consumers with what they want," it also
creates a market for its consumers.
Exploitation
Surely Playboy did not invent the exploitation of wo
men, breast fetishism or the focus on sex as the ultimate
thrill. These existed long before Gutenburg, much less
Playboy Press. Playboy has contributed substantially,
however, to the extremes of sexual alienation which are
exhibited in present capitalist societies by reinforcing

the link between sexuality and consumption.
