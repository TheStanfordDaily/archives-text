# Religion can justify blind prejudice
##

The column is in response to one
which appeared recently (Daily,
March 1), written by Terry Johnson
wherein he attempted to show that
Christian politicism does not consti
tute a threat to individual liberty.
There is no argument with the fact
that the commonly held to be Christ
ian moral ethic is a worthwhile set of
principles. However, in his dis
course, Johnson has ignored two ex
tremely important points.
First, there is overwhelming histor
ical precedent to show that the mix
ture of any religion into politics

(Christianity in particular) results in a
plague of intolerance, persecution
and bloodshed. Second, Christianity
embraces the inherent instability of
claiming sole ownership of absolute
truth, i.e. an intrinsic, God-given
correctness of viewpoint.
Oversights
These oversights result in errors of
a political, historical and philosophi
cal nature. After asserting the right of
any group to organize and lobby for
their views, Johnson claims the right
for Christians in order to lobby for
Christian legislation. However,
agitating for the passage of laws re
flecting religious prejudice is not the
same as agitating on behalf of say,
economic, political or ecological in
terests.
These latter are valid, at-large so
cial concerns. Religion and religious
views are not such concerns. They
are attendant upon individual per
suasion, are inherently private and
certainly not subject to external
supervision.
To illustrate, it is the conviction of
certain Jewish practitioners that all
male children be circumcised. It
would clearly be idiotic to legislate
this into a national mandate how
ever. The constitutional principle of
the separation of church and state
was invoked to prevent exactly what
Johnson proposes to do.
As examples of legislated Christian
morality, Johnson offers such laws as
those against murder, robbery, ra
cism, etc. However, Christianity is
not unique in its disapproval of these
by any criterion. More exact rep
resentatives of laws promulgating
Christian morality are the recently
repealed (in California) 'blue laws'

making both singular and less usual
sexual expression felonious acts.
The famous Scopes Monkey Trial'
which occurred in Tennessee in 1925
is a powerful example of the con
sequences of a law (forbidding the
teaching of evolutionary theory)
generated by an unhealthy admix
ture of Christian prejudice and poli
tics.
Johnson's defensive hedge that
"(the American system of govern
ment) contains checks and balances
which have historically been suffi
cient to contain excesses" is so naive
in the light of American history as to
be almost laughable.
Persecution evident
He asks (rhetorically) whether
there is "some quality peculiar to
Christians which would induce sup
port of a demagogue, or would cause
behavior which patently violates the
rights of a minority?" The non
rhetorical answer is a resounding â€”
VES! That peculiarity has been noted
above, being the unswerving belief
in an absolute truth and the con
sequences thus pertaining.
Armed with so formidable a
weapon, Christians have slaughtered
diverse non-believers for centuries.
Examples include the St. Barth
olomew's Day massacre of the
Huguenots in France as well as the
Inquisition, especially in Spain
where both Jews and assorted
political undesirables were liquid
ated. Mary I, Catholic Queen of Eng
land ca. 1555 was called Bloody' by
virtue of her religious persecutions.
The histories of the later Roman
and the Byzantine Empires are rife
with accounts of the political and so
cial persecution of pagans by Christ
ians. These last incidentally dwarf
both in magnitude and duration the
earlier persecution of the Christians,
notably by Diocletian.
In more recent times, persecution
amplified by Christianity has become
more subtle. For example, Biblical
passages have been used to justify
the social and economic disen
franchisement of certain races, not
ably the blacks. The view of female
worth inculcated in and by Christian
teaching of the Bible has resulted in
centuries of social, intellectual and
artistic repression of women.
The Christian Bible is even used by
legislators and others to justify capi
tal punishment. Even now Anita
Bryant is plotting to deny a minority

of its liberties, and she certainly
claims membership in, and to re
ceive support from, Christianity.
Contentions fallable
The point fundamental to all these
examples is this: that any religion can
easily be twisted to justify blind pre
judice. Therefore, the use of religion
to influence legislation must inevita
bly result in prejudicial laws. This fact
does not reflect on the goodness or
virtue of the religion, but on the fal
lability and variable pathology of the
individual.
Johnson has completely over
looked this point. His implied con
tention that all those who call them
selves Christians will be motivated by
Christ-like' principles is without
foundation.
Christianity is particularly vulnera
ble to prejudicial subversion. Its in
sistence on having the only and abso
lutetruth makes Christians prey toall
sorts of misapprehensions concern
ing their righteousness. Thus
Catholics know' that the Pope is in
fallible in matters of faith and morals.
The infallible moral sense of Pope
Pius XII was so subverted by
chauvinistic nationalism however
that he refused to take a strong pub
lic stand against the persecution of
the Jews by Nazi Germany. In a simi
lar manner 'Christian' racists know
that black people carry the mark of
Cain; sexists know that women are
for making babies and dinner; Anita
Bryant knows that fellatio should be a
crime, et adnauseam cetera.
Serious mischief
All this knowledge' derives from
Johnson's final statement, to wit:
"Christianity is not a superstitition, it
is a relationship with Cod." Not
stated is the almost universal conse
quential presumption that this rela
tionship provides a conduit for the
divine revelation of truth.
It is the intolerant righteousness
which this view encourages in its re
stricted interpretation which breeds
the danger of oppression. The no
tion that Christian belief is absolutely
the only possible correct belief has
caused, can, and may yet cause seri
ous mischief.
The fact that Johnson, even though
a senior with a major in history, does
not know this is testimony in itself
that the Christian religion can con
struct a most effecive set of blinders.
