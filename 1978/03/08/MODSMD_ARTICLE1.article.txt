With their heads buried in their
laps and their hands held high in the
air, representatives of six Stanford
sororities elected officers of the
Inter-Sorority Council (ISC) in a
Manzanita trailer last night.
After brief campaign promises,
banter among the electors and
numerous re-votes, the ISC selected
a president, rush chairperson and
secretary-treasurer in secret-ballot
voting.
Senior Cindy Hadden, who will
serve as president until her gradua
tion in September, is a co-president
and active member of Kappa Alpha
Theta. A Theta transfer from Col
orado College, Hadden said she
looks forward to a "strong cohesive
ness" among sorority groups.
New Rush Chairperson Tammy
Richey was the second pledge to the
Alpha Phi sorority. Richey em
phasized that she has actively fol
lowed the progress of the sorority
movement here since its inception in
October.
Sophomore Pi Phi Jill Liscom will
undertake the responsibilities of
secretary-treasurer, which began
with last night's $1.50 fee assessment
on each of the estimated 84 sorority
members. The assessment is ear
marked for publicity purposes.
Sororities claim their membership
is as follows: Alpha Phi, 22; Chi
Omega, 10; Kappa Alpha Theta, 13;
Kappa Delta, 2; Kappa Kappa
Gamma, 30; and Pi Phi, 12.
