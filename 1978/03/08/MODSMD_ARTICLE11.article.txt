I would like to inform the Stanford
community that an addition to the
literature concerning the divestment
controversy is now available in Box
No. 10 on the Stanford Information
Shelf, on the second floor of Meyer
Library.
This addition ("Free Stanford I, II")
is an editorial which I have written
that treats this controversy in the
context of what I see to be a larger
problem at this University.
I regret that I have been unable to
bring my thoughts directly to the
community via the Daily, and I
realize that far fewer people will be
exposed to my feelings because of
this inability.
Certainly I'm asking a lot from the
reader; yet I feel that the reward of
exposure to substantive comment
(often lacking in the occasional pab
lum masquerading as editorial opin
ion) will rriore than compensate for
the effort expended.
