# SCRIP reaffirms strength

It is an interesting thing to read
one's own obituary. To paraphrase
Mark Twain who once had that plea
sure, "The reports of SCRIP'S death
are highly exaggerated." It is not
surprising to find such reports cir
culating; there are many who would
like to see SCRIP dead. Nonetheless,
we must inform the administration
that we are alive — and kicking.
President Richard Lyman and his
various assistants haven't gotten
over their penchant for rhetoric over
facts. Brushing aside the absurd
suggestions that SCRIP is in this issue
for the publicity, we find that the two
important questions are: 1) Are U.S.
corporations good for the majority of
South Africans? and 2) Is divestment
the most effective way for Stanford to
help the people of South Africa?
Assistant to the President Robert
Hamrdla comments, "SCRIP seems
to say, If you question the premise
that U.S. corporations ought not be
in South Africa then you are automat
ically for apartheid.' " Actually, that
is not far from wrong. SCRIP has
shown that corporations operating in
South Africa support apartheid and
therefore withdrawal is the only way
to end that support.
We did not reach this conclusion
easily nor without a great deal of re
search. SCRIP has produced two
long reports on U.S. corporations in
South Africa. The South African
Catalyst Project has written an 80
page analysis on the question and
there are numerous other reports
produced outside of Palo Alto. The
U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Africa
has just released a report that called
for economic sanctions and it too
concludes that U.S. corporations are
an intergral part of apartheid and do
not serve the interests of the majority
of the people in South Africa.
When SCRIP calls for U.S. corpo
rate withdrawal from South Africa,
we are joining with every major
black, Asian or colored group in
South Africa. We are joining with the
National Council of Churches and
numerous other religious groups in
side and outside South Africa. We
are joining with the NAACP, the
Congressional Black Caucus, the
lieutenant governor of California,
and the Organization of African
States.
Wearealso joiningwith the United
Nations Department of Political and
Security Council Affairs. In addition,
we are joining with Polaroid and a
number of banks in the United
States, Holland and England that
have decided not to deal with South
Africa anymore because of apar

theid.
Who are Lyman and the Trustees
agreeing with when they argue that
U.S. corporations should stay? There
are the corporations themselves, of
course, and the white South African
government, hardly the best allies
one might choose. And what re
search has Stanford done? What re
ports on U.S. corporations in South
Africa? What facts? If they have any,
they are the best kept secret at Stan
ford.
It has been nearly a year and SCRIP
has yet to hear one serious presenta
tion from the administration or trus
tees that defends the position that
U.S. corporations ought to stay in
South Africa — and this from a great
research institution.
vThe second question is divest
ment. This question is certainly more
debatable than the first but the ad
ministration isn't interested in seri
ous debate. Twice they have turned
down invitations from SCRIP to ap
pear on campus to discuss the issue.
They would rather simply label di
vestment "not practical or serious."
In that case, someone should tell the
following organizations they are not
acting seriously: the National Coun
cil of Churches, the Oregon State
Board of Education, Hampshire Col
lege, The University of Mas
sachusetts, Smith College which sold
$700,000 of Firestone, and the Uni
versity of Wisconsin which just voted
to sell over $9 million of stocks in
firms operating in South Africa.
Representatives of the black
groups in South Africa which call for
U.S. corporations to leave have also
called for Universities to sell their
stock. They have so testified at Wis
consin, Michigan, Massachusetts
and Oregon. Maybe the administra
tion and others don't agree that di
vestment is the best tactic, but it cer
tainly is a serious position to hold.
Lyman has said that divestment is
far up the road." Why wait? Stan
ford had been doing nothing for
years on South Africa before SCRIP
raised the issue. Countless proxies
have come and gone. As we tarry
along the road looking at this and
that and listening to the administra
tion's rhetoric, South Africa con
tinues to be perhaps the most rep
ressive government in the world —
certainly the most racist.
SCRIP assumes low profile
In the past week, several adminis
trators have claimed that SCRIP has
far less support than last year. Since
when have Vice President
Rosenzweig or Hamrdla become ex
perts on SCRIP'S strength? They have

never attended a SCRIP meeting or
gone door-to-door in the dorms re
cording students' reactions to SCRIP.
If they were to sincerely assess the
situation, they would find that SCRIP
is larger and stronger than ever be
fore.
Our actions have been deliber
ately less visible this year. We have
committed our time to communicat
ing with students informally — on a
one-to-one basis or in small groups.
We believe that this grass-roots or
ganizing is the best way to build a
strong movement to end Stanford's
complicity in apartheid.
During the past two weeks, there
has been much confusion about the
Feb. 14 divestment deadline set by
SCRIP. To clarify: several weeks be
fore Feb. 14 SCRIP decided to wait
and see how the CIR and the new
investment guidelines would affect
divestment. Therefore instead of cal
ling for a committment to divestment
on Feb. 14, we called on the trustees
to come to a position on divestment
in light of the new investment
guidelines and present and defend it
to the Stanford Community in an
open forum.
Before their Feb. 14 meeting we
sent research to the trustees on the
role of U.S. corporations in South
Africa and the effects of divestment,
but the trustees refused to put the
divestment issue on their agenda.
Thus, we knew we would have no
opportunity to make a formal pre
sentation to the trustees, nor could
we expect a formal answer from
them. We interpret this refusal to
mean that the trustees will make the
divestment issuea priority only when
organized, active and visible com
munity concern is expressed.
Commitment to educate renewed
Therefore, as of Feb. 14 we have
made a renewed commitment to
massively educate the community
about Stanford's complicity in apar
theid. SCRIP strongly believes that
divestment is the most effective way
to promote corporate withdrawal
from South Africa. We ask that all
members of the Stanford community
join us in a genuine debate of the
issues.
We also ask that President Lyman
and the trustees provide us with any
facts supporting the arguments that
corporations are a progressive force.
Lyman's claims that Stanford really
cares are empty and without substan
tiation. We want facts —we want ac
tion. So far, there has been neither
from the administration. Just talk.
