# Women face Bruins
## 
### Sukie Jackson 
All the top western women's
basketball teams and some of
the nation's best women
players will be at Maples Pavil
ion this weekend as the AIAW
Region 8 Basketball Champ
ionships get under way tomor
row.
Battling for the chance to ad
vance to the NCAA Tourna
ment semi-finals held on
March 23 are eight teams from
the California, Nevada and
Hawaii region. These teams in
clude top-seeded UCLA, Cal
Poly-Pomona, University of
Nevada-Las Vegas, Cal State-
Fullerton, Long Beach State,
San Jose State, Stanford and
the winner of last night's UC-
Davis-Chico State game.
According to Stanford coach
Dottie McCrea, "UCLA will be
ihe team to beat" in the tour
nament. In first round action,
the eighth-seeded Cardinals
meet the Bruins tomorrow at
8:15 p.m.
Runners-up in the 1977 Na
tional Invitational Tourna
ment, the Bruins enter tomor
row's contest with an impres
sive 20-3 record and a team full
of All-Americans. Forward
guard Ann Meyers is the
Bruins' best player, averaging
20 points and seven rebounds a
game. Meyers, a three-year

Kodak All-American, played on
the U.S. women's basketball
team for the last three years.
Besides Meyers, UCLA has
three other stars and a capable
bench. Freshman forward De
nise Curry, a prep All-
American from Davis, averages
21 points and Anita Ortega,
perhaps one of the finest
guards in the country, averages
19 points a game. UCLA's only
losses were to nationally
ranked Eastern teams.
So how will Stanford ap
proach tomorrow's games?
The Cardinals, 17-11 overall
and second in the Northern
California Athletic Confer
ence, "will just play the best we
can," McCrea said. We're
going to go for the best possi
ble shots. We'll play a zone de
fense because we're not quick
enough to stay with them
man-to-man."
Of the other teams par
ticipating, Cal Poly-Pomona,
UNLV and Fullerton hold top
seeds. The Cal Poly-Pomona
Broncos, 26-1, won the South
ern California Athletic Associa
tion. Their only defeat came
from UCLA in a non-league
match earlier in the season.
All first round games will be
played tomorrow with the
semi-finals slated for Friday
and the finals for Saturday.

Hostesses for the tourna
mentare still needed. They will
be paid $3 per game and will
receive a pass to the game.
