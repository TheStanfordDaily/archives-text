# Card nine down Fresno
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Yesterday it finally stopped
raining long enough for Sun
ken Diamond to dry out and
enable the Cardinal baseball
team to take the field for the
first time in a week.
The Cards picked up the
rain-interrupted preseason
right where they left off,
though, with an 8-5 win over
Fresno State — their 13th vic
tory in 16 games played this
year.
Commenting on the rain
soaked season Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess said,
Obviously it hurts us; espe
cially at the plate." But he ad
ded, The rain's all up and
down the state, so we're not
the only ones affected — it
hurts everyone."
Though the rain may have
hindered Stanford offensively
(the Cards totaled nine hits)
the defense yesterday was im
pressive. On top of the three
double plays turned by the
Card combination of Dave
Perez, Todd Ervin and Tom
Cuardino, outstanding over
t he-shoulder and diving
catches were made by Ervin
and third baseman Paul
Zuvella. Pepe Hinojosa also

made his share of saving
catches, backed up against the
leftfield fence.
Rob Irwin, picking up his
second win of this year, got off
to a rocky start but settled
down to pitch a good ballgame
until he was relieved by Bruce
Fiala in the eighth inning.
Stanford rallied in the
bottom of the first inning with
three runs when Hinojosa
walked and Randy Wong, who
went three-for-four, tripled to
right field scoring Hinojosa.
Then Larry Reynolds reached
first base on a walk, stole sec
ond and was moved to third on
a ground-out by Tom Cuardino
that scored Wong. Reynolds
scored the third run of the in
ning on a wild pitch that got by
Fresno catcher Dave Holt.
The Cardinals put the game

away in the bottom of the fifth
inning when they collected
three runs by executing good
hit-and-run baseball.
After Cuardino was called
out on strikes, Mike Codiroli
collected two RBI with a base
hit past the Fresno shortstop.
Codiroli then stole second and
scored easily on a hit-and-run
single drilled into left field by
Paul Zuvella.
