### 
The bronze statue of the Leland Stanford family which stands on the northeast
corner of the Art Gallery was vandalized this weekend when someone cut off
the thumb of Leland Jr. with a hacksaw. The sculpture, done by LarkinG. Mead
in 1899, once stood in Memorial Court. The damage is "practically impossible
to repair" according to Art Prof. Elliot Eisner. The severed portion of the thumb
was not found but its recovery would make repair mucn easier, he said.
