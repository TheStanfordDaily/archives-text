# Stanford blasts Bulldogs in track
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
Fresno State's one-year reign
of supremacy over the Stan
ford track team ended yester
day as the Cardinals dumped
the Bulldogs, 96-67, in Fresno.
The Cardinals had not lost to
Fresno since 1942 when the
Bulldogs upended Stanford
last year. But things were set in
order again as James Lofton
and Darrin Nelson paced the
Cards in a meet originally
scheduled for last Saturday,
but postponed because of the
weekend rains.
Lofton, the James-of-all
trades, sprinted to a 21.42

triumph in the 200 and won the
long jump with a 25-1 leap. Lof
ton will compete in the NCAA
Indoor Meet Friday in Detroit.
Nelson raced to a 10.79 vic
tory in the 100, then finished
second to Lofton in the long
jump.
Jumping in his first meet of
the year, the freshman dynamo
leaped 24-10'/2, 15 inches bet
ter than his previous best.
"Darrin's jump was the most
outstanding performance of
the meet for us," Stanford
coach Payton Jordan said.
"He's been doing lots of run
ning work, but he's had only
two serious sessions to work
on his jumping steps."
Mark Stillman, another Card
freshman, led a Stanford
sweep in the 800. Earlier in the
meet Stillman set a Stanford
frosh mark in the mile with a
4:07.24 clocking. Fresno's Bob
Deis beat Stillman at the tape,
edging him with a 4:07.18.
Sophomore Bill Haldeman
churned over the barriers and
through the water jump to set a
meet record of 9:08.1 in the
steeplechase.
Stanford's Dave Thomson
and Chuck Weidmann opened
the meet throwingthe hammer
157-4 to tie for first and set a
track record.
