Government may seize mines
Washington —The Carter administration is ac
tively considering seizure of coal mines if striking
miners defy a back-to-work order issued under the
Taft-Hartley Act, a key White House official said
yesterday.
Special trade negotiator Robert Strauss said re
questing seizure authority from Congress remains
an option in the 92-day strike, although President
Jimmy Carter rejected an immediate takeover
when he invoked the Taft-Hartley Act on Monday.
Governors in coal country vowed yesterday to
keep the peace if mines reopen under a Taft-
Hartley order despised by many striking miners.
Some, hoping miners would obey the order,
would not reveal their plans. Others warned of
using the National Guard.
Virginia Gov. John Dalton made the most
dramatic announcement: He declared a state of
emergency, said he had sent hundreds of state
policemen into coal-mining areas, and added that
he would use National Guard troops, if necessary,
to prevent coalfield violence.

Army sentences mimes in Spain

Franco censorship, high army officials insisted that
it was not a civilian matter and the reputation of
the armed forces was at stake.

Government may seize mines
Washington —The Carter administration is ac
tively considering seizure of coal mines if striking
miners defy a back-to-work order issued under the
Taft-Hartley Act, a key White House official said
yesterday.

Hartley order despised by many striking miners.
Some, hoping miners would obey the order,

using the National Guard.
Virginia Gov. John Dalton made the most

emergency, said he had sent hundreds of state
policemen into coal-mining areas, and added that
he would use National Guard troops, if necessary,
to prevent coalfield violence.

Washington —The Carter administration is ac
tively considering seizure of coal mines if striking
miners defy a back-to-work order issued under the
Taft-Hartley Act, a key White House official said
yesterday.
Special trade negotiator Robert Strauss said re
questing seizure authority from Congress remains
an option in the 92-day strike, although President
Jimmy Carter rejected an immediate takeover
when he invoked the Taft-Hartley Act on Monday.
Governors in coal country vowed yesterday to
keep the peace if mines reopen under a Taft-
Hartley order despised by many striking miners.
Some, hoping miners would obey the order,
would not reveal their plans. Others warned of
using the National Guard.
Virginia Gov. John Dalton made the most
dramatic announcement: He declared a state of
emergency, said he had sent hundreds of state
policemen into coal-mining areas, and added that
he would use National Guard troops, if necessary,
to prevent coalfield violence.

last week in three days of meetings attended by

pose them for a single two-year period.

privileges other than voting in the assembly,

Army sentences mimes in Spain
Barcelona, Spain — A military court sentenced
four members of Spain's leading pantomime
group yesterday to two years in prison for insulting

Suarez' centrist government would have liked to
have seen the court martial laid aside because of
damage to Spain's democratic image after years of
Franco censorship, high army officials insisted that
it was not a civilian matter and the reputation of
the armed forces was at stake.
