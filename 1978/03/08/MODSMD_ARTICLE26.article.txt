# SWOPSI encourages energy conservation
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Making the Stanford community aware of
energy conservation is the purpose of a series of
presentations sponsored through the SWOPSI
program.
Last week SWOPSI discussed energy conserva
tion concepts at Roth House and Casa Zapata. A
film showing and question-and-answer sessions
are scheduled for 10:30 tonight at Burbank House
in Stern.
"Energy: A National Issue," also known as the
"Flintstone Energy Special," is a 20-minute synop
sis of America's energy situation. The film, to be
shown during the Burbank program, has been na
tionally televised.
Karl Johnson, instructor of the SWOPSI course
"Energy Conservation as an Energy Resource,"
described last week's session at Roth House as
"one in a series of presentations to be given not

only by the SWOPSI class but by former class
members, myself and other people throughout
the year."
lohnson said the purpose behind the program is
"to inform people and make them aware of the
energy problems and what they personally can do.
There's an awful lot that an individual can do;
individuals can make up to 50 per cent of the
difference in how much energy is used in dorms or
houses, as demonstrated at Androgyny House."
Androgyny (Simone de Beauvoir) uses 52 per
cent less electricity than used in the same house
last year, according to Johnson.
"For people to realize that they can make that
much of an effect without sacrifice and a tremend
ous amount of effort — just sort of a conscious
ness change and a slight behavioral change, is one
of the main points," he said.
Arle Kruckenberg, student in the SWOPSI class

and leader in the presentations, helped organize
the Roth project. He gave his goal as being to "talk
to them (the Roth residents) about the energy
crisis' — basically what that means in terms of real
energy consumption and needs and the future of
energy — both dwindling nonrenewable re
sources and alternatives for overcoming those re
source problems."
The house has already conserved 30 per cent of
the electricity over last year, and increased savings
are expected following installation of solar collec
tor panels.
Diane (ohnson, another SWOPSI student and
coordinator with Kruckeberg, summed up class
interest in educational presentations.
Energy conservation is not something that
we're involved in as a pastime, but it's something
that everyone has got to realize will be part of our
lives in the future."
