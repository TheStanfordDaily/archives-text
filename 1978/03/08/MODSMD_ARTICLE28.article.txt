# IFC discusses funds, Aqua Follies events
## 
### Robin Millington 
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
voted yesterday to charge each
fraternity $35 to cover the cost of the
April 8 Aqua Follies.
In addition to events the IFC is
planning, frisbee team member Tom
Mcßann told the council the nation
ally televised Western Ultimate Fris
bee Championship will be held on
campus the same day.
' We'd be willing to tie in however
you want us to — like doing de
monstrations or something at the fol
lies," Mcßann said. He said world
frisbee-throwing champions will at
tend the contest.
Mcßann said frisbee contest or
ganizers are looking for "inexpen
sive housing at the frats" for particip
ants. The council left the decision on
offering housing to individual frater
nities.
IFC President Reid Butler said that
in addition to canoe races, jousting
matches and tugs-of-war previously
mentioned as potential Aqua Follies
activities, planners are considering a
proposal for a wind surfing exhibi
tion and "a couple of groups who
want to put on ski shows."
We're also looking into a dunking
machine," he said.
Kappa Alpha member Jere
Thompson told the council that a
Muscular Dystrophy Association
support group on campus is schedul
ing a dance marathon for April 28 and
expressed concern that fraternity
rush functions might conflict with
the marathon.
Thompson said the group's goal is
to earn at least $10,000 with the
marathon.
"We would like to see that each
couple raises about $125 to partici

pate," he said. Each living group on
campus was urged to sponsor a
couple or two, by Thompson.
. "We plan to have bands playing,
with breaks, from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m."
A representative from the organi
zation which raises the most money
for the cause will present the total
dance earnings to Jerry Lewis on his
next Labor Day Telethon, he said.
