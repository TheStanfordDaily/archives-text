# Med student charges 'political intrigue'
## SMSA denies misappropriation of funds 
### Andrea James 
The Stanford Medical Students As
sociation (SMSA) yesterday denied
allegations that it practiced "political
intrigue and self-aggrandizement"
when it appropriated $2500 to or
ganizations sending delegates to
three medical conferences.
In last week's edition of "Novum
Organum," the Medical School's
student publication, a second-year
med student, Martin Kernberg,
charged, "Hundreds of dollars are
being spent on individual students,
at the cost of other, more important
priorities."
Kernberg added, "There is also a
clear need for a new direction for the
SMSA Executive Council (Commit
tee): the necessity to move away
from political intrigue and self
aggrandizement and toward patient
consultation and service."
|im Kaye, third-year student and
president of SMSA, responded to
Kernberg's allegations. Kaye's re
sponse appeared in yesterday's "Or
ganum."
The controversy began Feb. 14
when SMSA appropriated $2500 to
send nine students to the annual
American Medical Student Associa
tion (AMSA), the annual Student Na
tional Medical Association (SNMA)
and the regional La Raza Medical As
sociation (La RaMa) conventions.
The appropriation was made by
members of the Executive Commit
tee of SMSA, which consists of two
representatives from each class and
three other persons chosen at large.
Kaye says the appropriation for
AMSA was "an open vote. The com
mittee asked for a show of hands."
However, Kernberg claims "the
appropriations for La RaMa and

SNMA were approved by a closed
vote of the Executive Committee
only. They should have been an open
vote of everyone present, or better
yet, a full student body poll should
have been taken."
Kaye says in his letter that $1500 of
the $2500 appropriated funds will
come from the Office of Student Af
fairs (OSA).
"It is from a fund earmarked for
student travel purposes which SMSA
distributes," Kaye stated. "Only
$1000 of our appropriation came
from the SMSA treasury."
Kaye also claims in his letter that
the $1000 appropriation to SNMA
and La RaMa was given to the organi
zations rather than to the individuals.
"Corrie Anderson (Exec Comm
member and president of SNMA)
and Bonnie Maldonado (Exec Comm
member and member of La RaMa)
were asked by their respective or
ganizations to present the requests
for funding at an SMSA meeting. I
don't see this as a conflict of interest
or in any way improper."
Kernberg claims, however, that
this was improper because "they
were both declared candidates for
delegate positions of their respective
organizations."
Kaye told the Daily that the money
was appropriated to the organiza
tions before the selection of their de
legates had been made.
"We didn't specify the number of
delegates the organizations had to
choose," Kaye said. "That was left up
to the organizations themselves."
However, since SMSA is a chapter
of AMSA, SMSA members elected
delegates to the AMSA convention.
"The selection of AMSA delegates
should be made by a student-wide

vote in the future," Kaye stated in his
letter. "However, since there were
only two weeks before the conven
tion . . . we felt it was best to make
the selections immediately."
Kernberg claims that while travel
arrangements should have been
made in advance, the AMSA dele
gates themselves should have been
chosen by a vote of the entire stu
dent body.
Kaye said he "felt it was best" for
the Exec Comm members to choose
the AMSA delegate.
"There were as many non-Exec
Comm members as Exec Comm
members in the running for AMSA

delegates, so an open vote wouldn't
have solved any conflicts of in
terest," he stated.
"Two out of three Exec Comm
members and one out of three non-
Exec Comm members were elected,"
he added. "No one voted money to
himself or herself because the
money had already been approp
riated."
Neither Bonnie Maldonado nor
Corrie Anderson were selected as
delegates at the SMSA meeting.
Kaye concludes his letter by saying
the "Exec Comm has no interest in
political intrigue' or self
aggrandizement.' "
