# USE meeting culminates in disputed firing of Berk

Secretary Jim Berk was fired at a gen
eral membership meeting yesterday
in a move that is called "unconstitu
tional" by some and "democratic" by
others. Either way, the event may
force postponement of an April 4
union officer election.
Yesterday's meeting, attended by
80 to 90 USE members, brought to a
head the internal disagreements
plaguing the union for several years.
Bob Britten, a USE member and
candidate for the union's presidency
in the April election, said Berk has
refused to comply with a union
committee investigating computer
service charges of $60,000 in the last
four years.
Britten also charged that Berk is
responsible for the resignation of
three union staff members in the last
six months, the withdrawal of USE
from hospital elections in January
and the failure to mail instructions
for returning ballots in the recent
USE constitutional amendment elec
tion.
Berk maintained that he had com
plied with similar requests in the past
and that his "own measurements"
over a three-year period show that
the computer costs are equal to ad
ding one person to the four-person
union staff. He added that the costs
have also "gotten less" as time went
on.
Berk also said he was not involved
in the planning of the union's cam
paign in the hospital election. He
said that the deadline for returning

the amendment ballots was adver
tised in the USE newspaper but ad
mitted that it would have been pref
erable to include the instructions
with the mailed ballot.
USE President Anne Schlagenhaft
said the whole meeting was uncon
stitutional because the members
present voted to have USE member
William Reynolds rather than her
chair the meeting.
The bylaws of USE state: "The Pres
ident shall preside at all meetings of
the membership and executive
committee except where the respon
sibility is delegated to another
member."
Schlagenhaft said the passage was
"meant to say the President shall de
legate that responsibility" and not
the members present at a meeting.
Britten said he interpreted the

bylaws as saying the delegation may
be done by a vote of those present at
a meeting.
If the chair-delegation was held to
be unconstitutional, Berk first main
tained that all business conducted
would be void. This would include
the nominations for USE office that
were made
That action would make Britten the
only nominee for president.
Schlagenhaft and Berk were nomi
nated at yesterday's meeting.
Berk and Schlagenhaft later said
they believed the nomination pro
cess could be considered separately
from the regular business because
the process is not dependent on the
chair.
Ballots for the April election are
scheduled to be mailed out March 20
and they must be returned by April 4.

Berk maintained that he had com
plied with similar requests in the past
and that his "own measurements"
over a three-year period show that
the computer costs are equal to ad
ding one person to the four-person
union staff. He added that the costs
have also "gotten less" as time went
on.
Berk also said he was not involved
in the planning of the union's cam
paign in the hospital election. He
said that the deadline for returning

the amendment ballots was adver
tised in the USE newspaper but ad
mitted that it would have been pref
erable to include the instructions
with the mailed ballot.
USE President Anne Schlagenhaft
said the whole meeting was uncon
stitutional because the members
present voted to have USE member
William Reynolds rather than her
chair the meeting.
The bylaws of USE state: "The Pres
ident shall preside at all meetings of
the membership and executive
committee except where the respon
sibility is delegated to another
member."
Schlagenhaft said the passage was
"meant to say the President shall de
legate that responsibility" and not
the members present at a meeting.
Britten said he interpreted the

bylaws as saying the delegation may
be done by a vote of those present at
a meeting.
If the chair-delegation was held to
be unconstitutional, Berk first main
tained that all business conducted
would be void. This would include
the nominations for USE office that
were made
That action would make Britten the
only nominee for president.
Schlagenhaft and Berk were nomi
nated at yesterday's meeting.
Berk and Schlagenhaft later said
they believed the nomination pro
cess could be considered separately
from the regular business because
the process is not dependent on the
chair.
Ballots for the April election are
scheduled to be mailed out March 20
and they must be returned by April 4.
