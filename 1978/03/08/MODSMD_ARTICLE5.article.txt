# Senate considers vote reform move
## 
### Sara Lessley 
After lengthy debate, the ASSU
Senate last night returned to commit
tee a proposal to elect under
graduate senators by geographical
campus districts and to stagger se
nate elections.
In a straw vote late in the debate,
members were nearly evenly divided
on the resolution, which would also
increase from 21 to 41 the number of
senators with voting privileges.
If the senate passes the proposal, it
must be approved by the student
body to become effective.
Currently, the senate is elected at
large, with 20 full senators, 20 alter
nates, and a chairperson. The prop
osal would eliminate the alternate
senator position.
The proposal also mandates that
half of the body be elected during fall
quarter and half in the spring.
In other action, the senate placed
fee assessment proposals for the
Stanford Committee on Political
Education (SCOPE), the Guest Pro
fessorship Board, the Speakers
Bureau and the Publications Board,
on the spring quarter election ballot.
This brings the total number of as
sessments placed on the ballot so far
to five. A $2 assessment for the ASSU
Program Fee was passed at the se
nate's last meeting.
Terming the current election sys

tem deficit in "the relationship bet
ween representative and con
stituent," the senate's Select Com
mittee on Election Reform called for
a district system based on residence
populations.
Sen. Steven Buckley, the commit
tee's secretary, said candidates
would not be required to live in the
districts from which they are elected.
The districting issue was the most
controversial of the reform propos
als. Chairperson Fred Crethel said he
was concerned that districting would
"ignore political realities," and
added that because there are not
"large proportions of third world
students" in the districts they might
go unrepresented.
Buckley replied that it is invalid to
assume that minority candidates will
appeal only to minority students.
Non-minorities deserve just as
much representation as minorities,
Sen. Al Miner said.
"There is no way we can make
every district have a high majority of
minorities," Miner added.
"We form special interest groups
in the first place because we were not
represented as individuals at large,"
Sen. David Catanzarite said in oppos
ing the reform.
"I think this (proposal) would
create a monolithic power group."
