# Lyman says 'simple force' won't sway him

### Joel Dickholtz News analysis 
"l have never said that there's a big progressive
influence by American firms in South Africa,"
stated University President Richard Lyman. "We
get set up for this, we get views attributed to us
that we don't hold, and then those views are
knocked down."
Lyman told the Daily his opinions have not
been, and probably will not be, greatly changed by
public pressure.
"It's not likely that I'm going to be persuaded by
simple force and mass numbers," he said. "If we
let ourselves be pushed around by several
hundred students in buildings, we'd be pushed
this way and that."
He added that he felt protest is being done for
publicity. "That's not an ignoble reason," he said.
"They're doing it for the impact on public opinion
generally, rather than in any hopes of changing the
University's policy."
Lyman declined to comment on how he viewed
the changing role of Stanford Committee for Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP), but did men

tion a loss of student interest in divestment.
"I think support for divestment diminished be
cause most people realized it wasn't going to hap
pen," he said. "They're not going to knock them
selves out for something to happen when they
know it isn't going to happen.
"I don't believe that at any time this fall know
ledgeable leaders of SCRIP could possibly have
believed that the trustees were going to divest
themselves of the stock. I don't think that it was
ever in the cards, and I think people knew that."
"Divestment would do us some harm, but I re
ally can't predict it would do anybody else any
good," he said. "The causal chain between our
divesting our stock in corporations doing our bus
iness in South Africa and good happening in South
Africa is so attenuating and so impossible to follow
that I'm just not persuaded by it.
"Divestiture is a one-time gesture of protest.
And that's all it is. Once you've done it, you've
done it, andyou've lost your leverage," he added.
Lyman said divestment would have any impact
as an example of a "funny kind of narcissism at
Stanford that leads people here to believe if Stan

ford University, with capital letters, takes a stand
and says something, it's going to have a tremend
ous impact on the world. I just don't think that's a
realistic perception."
Lyman commented on the workings of SCRIP.
"You can't have your cake and eat it, that is to
indulge on completely unrestrained attacks on
people's motives, and their moral courage one
day, and expect them to be as responsive as they
would be if you treated them decently, the next
day."
According to Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the
president for trustee affairs, the Committee on
Investment Responsibility (CIR) is now reviewing
the first six proxies of the season, none of which
have anything to do with South Africa. Those pro
xies will come up for vote later in the season.
Hamrdla also pointed out that trustees have
been making an effort to speak to students in
dorms about South Africa.
"So far we've had 27 sherry hours, and there are
three more scheduled for this month," he com
mented, "and we have requests for 20 more."
