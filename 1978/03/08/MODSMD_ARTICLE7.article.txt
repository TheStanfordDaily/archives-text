# Hello Dollies
## 
### 
Stanford's five new Dollies were
awakened yesterday by a surprise
announcement of their selection,
kidnapped, and taken to breakfast at
the Manzanita Paik trailer of Simone
Cox, one of this year's Dollies. They
were chosen from a list of 70 finalists
by the Band after tryouts Monday af
ternoon and interviews Monday
evening. Remarkably, four new Dol
lies are roommate pairs and the fifth
rooms with a current Dollie.
Freshmen Pam Cuzy, from Menlo
Park, and Dana Fugelso, from La
Canada, are roommates in Branner.
Freshmen Jonrie Etchemendy, from
Reno, Nev. and Gayle McGinnis from
Belmont room together in Burbank.
The fifth Dollie, Ronda Spinak, from
Huntington Beach, lives in Otero
with Dollie Beth Buell and was first
alternate Dollie this year. Originally
25 women tried out at Maples Pavil
