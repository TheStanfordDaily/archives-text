# Apathy chokes learning
## Students ailed by elitism 
### 
Allan Chen

You are a varied and a diverse
group, and so I cannot say the same
things about all of you. However, I
can try to criticize the community as a
whole, and bring to your attention
what I believe are counterproductive
or uncomforting trends and prac
tices. I can hope that all of you will
look to these criticisms and act as you
see fit for the good of the commun
ity.
There are many problems, injus
tices and unfair practices at Stanford
University. But they are not all per
petrated by the University administ
ration. In fact many of them are per
petrated by you, by attitudes you
hold, and by actions you carry on
daily, sometimes unconsciously.
Realize that what you do determines
the pathway of the human race and
the temper of the time as much as
anything that President Lyman or
President Carter may do.
One of the most fundamental of
these problems is one of the least
correctable: elitism. It begins with
the admissions office and the forces
that support the idea of privileged
education. It ends with the student
body itself. You are maintaining the
illusion that those who get the high
est grades, those who get into the
most exclusive schools, and those
who achieve the most are the best,
and therefore the ones who know
best.
There is nothing intrinsically
wrong with elitism if its practitioners
aim at doing better work for the sake
of the work itself. Too often, how
ever, the elitism leads to something
else. If you believe that Stanford is
better than Berkeley or Harvard, or
that an A is better than a B plus, then
you are taking a second step down
the road toward societal acceptabil
ity and blissful, unthinking oblivion.

Educational elitism is the most
heinous of all, because it breeds
other forms of elitism. It stratifies
society and leads to — or maintains
— racial, sexual and social prejudice.
It gives false demagogues their
power, the stamp of educational
qualification, and it blinds the inf
luential by causing an unthinking re
liance on self and on the past, and an
insensitivity to change.
Students sealed in apathy
The unquestioning acceptance of
the norm leads us to another prob
lem with life at Stanford. Many of you
are politically unaware. Worse than
that, you are politically uncaring,
callous and contemptuous. You be
lieve that the United States and Stan
ford are untouchable, secure, no
matter what may happen in the
world.
Some of you feel that everything is
just fine the way it is, and that all we
need is a stronger leader and a little
more decisiveness, or a little less in
tervention. Some of you feel that
there is nothing that you can do any
way, so why bother? Some of you
feel that political and social aware
ness is not worth your time. Many of
you have forsaken those ethical re
sponsibilities that are yours by mere
virtue of your humanity.
Of those of you who are politically
aware, even politically active, some
of you are unrealistic, idle dreamers
or petty squabblers. You catagorize
yourself as a radical or a conserva
tive, and you espouse the virtues of
quick, non-violent change, or reac
tionary change and no change at all.
You fail to realize that political
philosophy must be fluid and adjust
able to changing circumstances.
You forget that the ultimate goal of
political philosophy is to provide
necessities and happiness for

everyone in a fair and just way, and
that no political philosophy is so per
fect that it is worth defending to the
death.
Inactivity stifles creativity
Those of you who are not con
cerned with politics and human
well-being claim to be here for the
learning. But here your defense fails.
While Stanford may be an academic
institution, it is certainly not an intel
lectual one. You spend your days in
classes and your nights in the lib
raries or in your room studying. You
forget that education and learning
are more than poring over obscure,
dusty tomes which no one will ever
again read, or pages of equations and
numbers which only a very few will
ever understand.
Education is synonymous with life,
and to learn, you must do more than
study. You must interact with your
professors and your fellow students
on an intellectual basis, not just a
social one. You must involveyourself
in activities which test your under
standing of theory and require your
creatvity. You must be an observer
and a participator simultaneously.
And if not — you will find yourself
back to where we started from: an
elitist, with a narrow-minded, into
lerant point of view. You will lose
your ability to question all that comes
before you. You will fall into a set
pattern of thinking. You will propa
gate and amplify the patterns of pre
judice and dogma that society has
conditioned in you so that you re
main its subjugate. When you meet
others who don't share your way of
viewing the world, you will react vio
lently. Your own intolerance will
propagate to others, and the world
will be the worse for it.
Challenge to be involved
Of course, I do not include
everyone in this diatribe. Not
everyone harbors all of these flaws,
although many of you harbor at least
some of them. Stanford is not a col
lective of self-deception and oppres
sion. There is positive student ac
tivism and there are open-minded
students who are genuinely con
cerned with the state of humankind.
They are actively fulfilling their obli
gations to it. Most important, there is
much self-seeking, and there are
people who live their ideals. Michael
Jennings, and the discussion that he
has sparked in these pages is such an
example.
I believe, however, that these indi
viduals are in the minority. This col
umn is written as a call to arms to
those in the majority. I write this to
partially fulfill my continuing obliga
tion to the human race. Now I chal
lenge you to fulfill yours. Question
yourself, your biases and your ideals,
and question Stanford's, the same.
Find something wrong. And do
something about it.
