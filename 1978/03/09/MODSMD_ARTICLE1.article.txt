# Student officials' scandals also plague other campuses
## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
The recent election controversy
here doesn't appear to be an isolated
incident of student government
scandal.
In addition to the disqualification
of two ASSU senators here last fall,
other incidents show student gov
ernment suffering some embarrass
ment in other schools including
USC, UC-Berkeley and UCLA.
UCLA suffered the biggest scandal
in 1976, when Undergraduate Stu
dent Association President Meg
McCormack, was allegedly pres
sured to resign from her position.
Consequently she filed a $1.25 mill
ion libel and slander suit against nine
then-current and former student
government officials, an ex
reporter for the Daily Bruin and the
UCLA Communications Board.
McCormack accused five student
government officials of forming a
conspiracy, according to the Daily
Bruin. She said the officials caused

great damage to her reputation, in
cluding those of her family and
fiance, by publishing defamatory in
formation about her.
Attempting to force her resigna
tion, the conspirators harassed
McCormack on the phone, and
threatened her with public discredit
if she did not resign, she said.
At UC-Berkeley 15 senators were
removed last month from their seats
after the invalidation of the fall elec
tion. ASUC Executive Vice President
Greg Ryan said at the time, "The se
nate can barely get by with 30
senators." The loss of half the senate
will "greatly impair the workings of
the legislative body."
The senate normally has 30 mem
bers.
However, some time after the
senators' disqualification, all 15 were
reinstated by Ryan, according to the
Daily Californian.
The controversy has not ended,
according to sources at the Daily
Californian. Recently, one of the
ousted/reinstated senators, Bob In
felise, announced that he would
bring suit against Ryan, protesting
the reinstatements.
A defeated candidate charged the
elections committee with misman
agement of the election. Violations
included the permission of "at least
six students" to vote twice, in
adequate advertising, invisibility of
the polls during the rain, shortage of
ballots at the polls, misleading in
formation at the polls and in
adequate voting instructions, ac

cording to the Daily Californian.
The election was invalidated, ac
cording to the Daily Californian, be
cause the elections committee "sub
stantially denied, to a great many
members of the association, an equal
opportunity to cast their vote."
According to the Daily Bruin
McCormack admitted she was unst
able and paranoid because of her
broken engagement with attorney
Thomas Norminton. Student gov
ernment officials said she often "bat
tled" with other student officers. She
was charged with embezzlement,
dealing falsely with others and bet
raying confidences, Daily Bruin arti
cles added.
Elected in April of 1976, McCor
mack finally resigned in September
of 1976, leaving school for two quar
ter. She married Norminton, who
served as the lawyer in her suit, ac
cording to the Daily Bruin.
Libel charges were filed against the
Daily Bruin and the Communications
Board, the newspaper's publisher.
Problems surrounding (JSC's
spring senate elections concern dis
trict representation, according to a
spokesperson from the Daily Trojan.
USC senators are elected by resi
dential districts. Two of the senators
elected represented the surrounding
student community and commuters.

house associates (RAs) and moved to
campus dorms, the spokesperson
added.

senate seats and RA positions.

The recent election controversy
here doesn't appear to be an isolated
incident of student government
scandal.
In addition to the disqualification
of two ASSU senators here last fall,
other incidents show student gov
ernment suffering some embarrass
ment in other schools including
USC, UC-Berkeley and UCLA.
UCLA suffered the biggest scandal
in 1976, when Undergraduate Stu
dent Association President Meg
McCormack, was allegedly pres
sured to resign from her position.
Consequently she filed a $1.25 mill
ion libel and slander suit against nine
then-current and former student
government officials, an ex
reporter for the Daily Bruin and the
UCLA Communications Board.
McCormack accused five student
government officials of forming a
conspiracy, according to the Daily
Bruin. She said the officials caused

great damage to her reputation, in
cluding those of her family and
fiance, by publishing defamatory in
formation about her.
Attempting to force her resigna
tion, the conspirators harassed
McCormack on the phone, and
threatened her with public discredit
if she did not resign, she said.
At UC-Berkeley 15 senators were
removed last month from their seats
after the invalidation of the fall elec
tion. ASUC Executive Vice President
Greg Ryan said at the time, "The se
nate can barely get by with 30
senators." The loss of half the senate
will "greatly impair the workings of
the legislative body."
The senate normally has 30 mem
bers.
However, some time after the
senators' disqualification, all 15 were
reinstated by Ryan, according to the
Daily Californian.
