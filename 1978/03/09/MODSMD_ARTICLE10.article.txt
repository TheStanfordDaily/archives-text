# Planning levels outlined
## Monitoring DNA research 
### 
Steven Hansch

Although public and campus de
bate has died down over recombin
ant DNA research, the issue, still be
fore Congress, demands as much at
tention as ever. Increasingly, funda
mental scientific research will di
rectly affect the public welfare.
While historically unnecessary,
public participation in the regulation
of fundamental research must be en
couraged on a number of levels. That
was the point of much political activ
ity at Stanford last year, prior to the
rapid rise of the issue of investment
responsibility.
Since then, the U.S. Congress has

reviewed competing legislation but
has yet to pass a recombinant DNA
bill. Perhaps the most well-known
bill was introduced by Senator Ed
ward Kennedy (D-Mass.), who called
for the creation of a new national
commission, composed predomin
antly of non-scientists, that would
have authority to regulate all re
search in recombinant DNA.
While I support the Kennedy bill I
also recognize that public interven
tion into research priorities is a vari
able to be minimized wherever un
necessary due to its costs as a
roadblock. The questions of public
policy-making should hover at levels
appropriate to the scale of questions
raised.
Therefore, I recommend four ideal
strategies that would establish per
manent institutions existing
explicitly for policy-making and sen
sitivity and consideration of public
opinion and welfare at international,
federal, local and laboratory scales.
Unknown hazards involved
DNA research uniquely raises
questions separate from past
biomedical research in that it is in the
research itself (recombining plas
mids) that the bulk of the risks occur.
The vehicle of distribution of the re
sults of DNA research, altered Es
cherichia culi (a bacterium), exists in
all mature humans. Since the re
search itself is fundamental, under
standing the products of the re
search could be beyond the ability of
the researchers to predict and con
trol.
This special dilemma proposed by
recombinant research therefore de
mands international concensus. In
the New York Times Magazine (1976)
Professor Liebe Cavalieri said, "a
single unrecognized accident could
contaminate the entire earth with a
dangerous and ineradicable agent
that might not reveal its presence
until its deadly work was done."
Even the defenders of such re
search admit, "We have no reason to
expect that any of these things will
happen, but we are unable to say for
certain that they will not happen."
It is absolutely irrelevant to point
out exactly how dangerous such re
search would probably be, when dis
cussing who should influence policy.
Essentially it is an ethical question of
how important such risks are to the
total amount of people potentially
involved.
The proposed international panel
would have the policy-deciding
status presently limited to the Na
tional Institutes of Health (NIH) of

the United States. The present NIH
guidelines serve as international re
commendations, especially since
much of the concerned international
scientific community already oper
ates within this country.
Unlike the NIH, an international
panel, representing public input
from all humanity, would be strictly
concerned with policy, not resource
allocation. The precedent would be
important in that, as in fundamental
nuclear research, the future will
likely hold more questions of this
sort where the people implicated in
ongoing research is all of humanity.
Normative issues raised
The standard reply is that DNA re
search is so innocuous that it is hardly
worth the cost and attention when
compared to other issues. Once
again, that is a normative judgment
since the "costs" are qualitatively dif
ferent from many similar issues.
The federal level must address
how the international guidelines will
be enforced on private industry and
how to allocate federal money. The
allocation of $5 billion of public
money on biomedical research raises
normative questions regarding dis
tribution and the importance of re
combinant research to the desires of
people. So, once again, the public
must have full input at this level.
Whereas the state may be pivotal
in regulation of industries, the next
crucial level for policy-making is the
local. Only on a community-wide
basis can decisions be sensitive to
the actual situation of research
laboratories in the context of a
human population. For instance, no
other level would be qualified to in
vestigate Dr. Hal Holman's concern
(brought up lastyearoncampus)that
recombinant research was being
conducted in close proximity to hos
pital patients who would be incredi
bly vulnerable to even slightly
dangerous strains of new E. coli. The
danger of building a P-3 facility in an
earthquake-prone area is another
example.
Finally, staff workers, researchers,
engineers and other citizens in direct
contact with the laboratory itself
must interact in policy-making for
the smallest level. Clearly, any non
scientific or scientific individual
working in or near the laboratory
would incur the greatest risks. But
beyond that, only at this level can
policies be sensitive to, for instance,
the concern in Harvard laboratories
that ants travel freely throughout
otherwise airtight facilities. All such
concerns can only be addressed by
all individuals involved at this level.
The point is that channels for in
volvement need to be opened up
when public welfare is in question.
