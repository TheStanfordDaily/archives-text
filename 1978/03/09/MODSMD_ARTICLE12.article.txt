San Francisco (AP) â€” Green
peace Foundation, which has
disrupted ocean whaling and
nuclear tests in the Pacific, re
ported yesterday two Ameri
can congressmen will join its
expedition seeking to halt the
commercial slaughter of baby
seals in Canada.
Rep. Leo Ryan (D-Calif), and
Rep. )ames leffords (R-
Vermont), confirmed they
would join 28 Greenpeace vol
unteers today on an anti
hunting excursion to St. An
drews, Newfoundland.
Both congressmen have
championed environmental
causes in the House.
"They are going to see first
hand what the hunting is all
about. They are going mainly
as observers," said Robert De
wey, a public relations worker
for the organization which has
offices here and in Vancouver,
B.C.
Greenpeace has waged a
campaign of harassment
against the seal hunters for the
past two years, standing in

front of hunting vessels to
keep them out of seal breeding
grounds and laying over new
born seals so they can't be
clubbed.
The conservation group says
the harp seal population could
be wiped out by commercial
hunters, who market seal oil
and furs.
"No single environmental
issue has raised so much public
outcry as the slaughter of baby
harp seals for commercial lux
ury products such as exotically
designed furs," Robert Taunt,
Greenpeace media director,
told a news conference.
Greenpeace estimates some
125,000 baby seals were club
bed to death on Newfound
land ice floes last year during
the annual one-week hunt.
The Canadian government
has joined the hunters in de
fending the commercial
slaughter, saying it is painless
for the animals and an
economic necessity for the
Newfoundlanders.
