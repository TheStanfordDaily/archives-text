# Roth to use solar heating
## 
### Mark Sonders 
Another Stanford tradition
gone the way of the Big Game
Bonfire? Not really, but one
might think so when one sees
regulation red tiles on south
facing roofs being replaced
with big black solar panels.
Such a thing is happening
now on Roth House, and de
pending on how well it works,
could also happen on other
University roofs.
Karl Johnson, of the Univer
sity's Energy Conservation
Center, and his SWOPSI class
on energy conservation and
resources have been installing
172 square feet of solar panels
asananxiliary to Roth'spresent
space and water heating sys
tem. The sun heats water that
runs through the panels to
high enough temperatures that
Roth's present system need
heat the water only 30 degrees
more in winter and not at all
in the spring. Johnson esti
mates that this system should
pay for itself through savings in
fuel costs within 10 to 12 years.
Many of California's pro
jected 9 million housing units
could utilize systems such as

Roth's by 1990 if certain solar
energy proposals become law.
This past Friday, a package of
proposals went to the State
Legislature's Counsel and
within a few weeks will return
to Assemblyman Victor Calvo's
(D-Mountain View) Resources,
Land Use and Energy Commit
tee, said Barbara Klein, an aide
to Calvo. The Committee will
review and rework the bills be
fore they are submitted to the
Assembly for a vote.
These forthcoming bills will
probably incorporate many
facets of Tom Hayden and the
Campaign for Economic
Democracy's important "Sol
arCal" proposal, said Klein.
SolarCal would legislate a
massive "solar mobilization"
to transform "California's
space and water heating needs
from dependence on fossil
fuels to solar and other conser
vative options," the proposal
read.
SolarCal would also regulate
the new solar energy industry
this "mobilization" would
create so as to help labor,
minorities, business and con
sumers by "creating tens of

thousands of jobs, conserving
energy and stimulating local
economic development," it
states.
To ensure that this economic
stimulation stays on a local
level, SolarCal provides for
low-interest loans to non
subsidiary small businesses
that fulfill special require
ments, to consumers and also
to cities that deal with these
small companies.
In addition to making "active
systems" accessible to con
sumers, these loans also pro
vide for "passive techniques"
of energy conservation like in
sulation and weatherstripping.
Proponents of SolarCal-type
legislation expect their
greatest opposition to come
from the "mega-corporations"
which are in the position to
squeeze out small local
businesses and to make the
market into an oligopoly.
The public utilities, too, will
probably create resistance for
this kind of program that is
"tied to local needs instead of
pure economics," said Bob
DeCrasse of the Institute for
the Future.
