# Flood victims want disaster relief
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — About 850 flood vic
tims from seven states asked members of
Congress yesterday to make changes in
the federal disaster assistance program
which they said is slow and inhumane.
They complained to several House and
Senate members that the government
spends more to help foreign disaster vic
tims than it does on its own citizens.
And they derided and castigated the
bureaucrats who had been sent to help
them during the flood disasters of the past
year.
"Many times these programs are ad

ministered by bureaucrats . . . who seem
to lose sight of what these programs are all
about," said William Rolland, chairman of
the sponsoring Flood Victims' Action
Council.
"We get the business approach to solv
ing our problems rather than the personal
approach."
jerry Hildebrand of Williamson, W. Va.,
said his community had two disasters last
spring.
"The first was the devastating flood of
April 4. The second was the federal recov
ery effort that followed."

He said the federal relief workers took
too long to organize, leading to situations
where flood victims slept in tars for
months while government-owned trailers,
which were brought for them, stood
empty.
There was no effort to provide long
range planning assistance and the offers to
help made by some local residents were
not accepted, he told the assembly.
"Most important, there was contempt
for local people and the property that was
lost. We didn't even speak the same lan
guage," he said.
