# Beginners, experts learn to ride at Stanford stables
## 
### Kathy Trafton Cindy Santana 
In front of the Stanford stables stands a
bronze horse commemorating a time in the
19th century when Leland Stanford's breed
ing farm was in full swing. Famous trotters
came from these pastures.
And here in 1878 and 1379 Governor Le
land Stanford conducted his famous photo
graphic experiment that proved a cantering
horse's feet are all off the ground for a mo
ment during each stride. The experiment
was e forerunner of the motion picture as he
used 24 cameras set to click at different mo
ments.
Now the stables are here to "teach Stan
ford students" how to ride, said Lois Mel
ville, director of the riding school.
Fiery hunters
And ride they do. Everyone from young
children on gentle horses to experienced
horsewomen on fiery hunters are in the ring.
Some ride over caveletti and jump brick
walls, in-and-outs and cross-bars. Others
concentrate to stay on a trotting horse.
The school teaches English riding with be
ginning through jumping divisions. The
charge to students here who receive one
unit is $60 to $70 per quarter. Advanced stu

dents pay the higher fee. For this fee stu
dents get 30 group lessons on a school
horse, that's $2 or slightly more per lesson.
Unbeatable!
No rentals
Classes are taught to students here on
Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. Private
lessons are given to non-Stanford people on
weekends and during the week as well, but
they pay substantially higher prices. The sta
bles do not rent out horses on an hourly
basis.
Demand for the riding classes is unbeliev
able. Students can not pre-register, and they
must show up early in the morning on the
first day of registration.
Instructor Debbie Buckley said that she
arrivedatthestablesatBa.m. on registration
day this quarterand people were in linewait
ing to sign the class list. "It took four or five
minutes to fill up the classes," she said.
Getting away
Buckley said she feels students enjoy es
caping from the center of campus. "It's a
relaxing atmosphere and students like to get
away from the campus and classroom," she
said.
"One of the nicest things is being able to
take the horses out after the class and letting
them graze," said student Megan Beachler.

Usually there are more women enrolled in
the riding classes, although Buckley said
there were once more men in a beginning
class. There is only one man in the advanced
class this quarter.
Top notch
The facilities at the stables are top notch.
There is a large covered ring, three outside
rings and a dressage ring for training and
exhibition riding. The facilities also include
two hunt fields and two pastures.
Freshman Pam Bradford boards her horse
at the stables. She said she especially likes
such facilities as the vacuum cleaner that is
designed to groom horses. "It saves a lot of
elbow work," she said.
Big classes
A major complaint of students is the size
of the classes. "When you have 12 people
going over a jump course individually, those
50 minutes are used up really fast," Ellyn
Stein, a senior who rode last spring said.
But "riding three times a week is wonder
ful. What you learn gets reinforced im
mediately. At most other places you ride
only once a week," she said.
There are about 100 horses on the 55-acre
area allotted to the stables, and 20 of them
are school horses.

"We have 20 baby sitters here. No, maybe
19. We won't count Stretch," said Buckley.
Some of the horses have amusing names
such as Beep, Lurch, Blondie (Dagwood had
to go), Winkie.
Mystifyingly, a horse appeared in one of
the pastures several weeks ago and no one is
sure where it came from, or to whom it be
longs.
"The horses are extremely good," said
Betsy Muenger, an advanced student. "It is
extremely well-run for a college stable. De
bbie is very safe. She doesn't take risks."
"I wish they would work us harder," one
student who asked to be anonymous said.
"At home my instructor continually would
go over my posture and position from head
to toe. Here after a ride I don't get that same
feeling of exhaustion."
The student said she is "shocked" that
riders are not required to wear the tradi
tional velvet hardhats.
"When I learned to ride, we wore them
whenever we got on a horse. We don't have
to wear hard hats even when we jump here.
The school is very lucky that there have been
no serious accidents."
Boarders
People from San jose and San Francisco
board their horses here and commute be

cause of the excellent facilities. A lot of
them are dressage riders," Buckley said.
The cost of boarding a horse is between
$65 and $135, including food. The large barn
is the most expensive location, and the field
is the cheapest. Horses can also be put in
paddocks, and Stanford students get a 10 per
cent discount when boarding their horses.
The horses being boarded at the stables
presently range in price from $200 to $1200.
Dressage
There are two trainers who instruct people
with their own horses for showing. Once a
month Hilda Gurney, who rode for the Un
ited States in the 1976 Olympics, teaches a
dressage clinic for expert riders.
Dressage is a french word for "basic train
ing"; in reality it is anything but that. It is
really ballet on horseback, and it em
phasizes precision, accuracy and high
school movements such as those the Lipiz
zaner stallions do, according to Buckley.
The covered ring has been a lifesaver dur
ing the recent storms. Problems arise in the
rest of the stable area when it rains, for it
turns intoa basin of mud. When it rains the
stables become part of Lake Lag," Bradford
said.
