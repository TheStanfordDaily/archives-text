# Women's problems and sex roles to be focus of course next quarter

When a man and a woman play a game of
tennis, who usually keeps score?
"The man does," said Helen Krumboltz, a
psychologist who will be lecturing in the school
of education in the spring quarter. "This may
not be significant for many women, but it is
interesting for some because they realize they
are locked into certain roles."
Many women let men win at games, dress to
be attractive to men or other women rather than
for themselves and ask questions they already
know answers to. These are just a few examples
from a long list of women's behavior that Krum
boltz said she feels must be re-examined.
Old responses
Calling such behavior "old responses,"
Krumboltz said that women must begin to look
into the ways they have been socialized in terms
of sex roles.
"Women have a lot of inculturated fears we
neverget over," she said. "For example, the fear
of being ostracized by males if we're too intelli
gent, the fearof numbers, the fear of supporting
one's self. . .
Krumboltz' solution is for women to realize
what their present situation is. "When we do
that, there will be certain roles in behavior we
would want to change," she said.
Course
In her spring course "Women's Self-Directed
Re-Education," Krumboltz will be teaching
research-based psychological skills women can
apply to themselves.
The course will focus on specific problems
participants feel. Through lectures, discussions
and readings, students will learn to change their

behavior, she said.
Krumboltz emphasized that the course is "a
reasonable, positive and temperate approach to
the whole issue of sex roles."
No put-down
While others may blame women's socially
conditioned roles on males, Krumboltz said,
"The course does not put anyone down."
Women's problems are the other side of the
coin from men's problems, she explained. For
example, while women are forced to succeed as
mothers and wives, men have to succeed occu
pationally, she said.
Men have their problems too, she observed.
"I hope sometime the course this spring can be
directed to both men and women."
Women's problems
There's nothing that says men cannot take the
course this spring, she quipped. However it is
geared towards women's problems more than
men's."
Krumboltz first became aware of women's
problems through her own experiences. On a
larger scale, she developed interest in the topic
while working on a book called "Changing
Children's Behavior," which she co-authored
with her husband.
She taught in the psychology department at
San Jose State for eight years and for a shorter
period at Berkeley on a part-time basis to ac
commodate both her professional and family
life.
Reflecting her commitment to changing so
cially conditioned sex roles, Krumboltz gave her
two children neutral names which could apply
to both male and female.

When a man and a woman play a game of
tennis, who usually keeps score?
"The man does," said Helen Krumboltz, a
psychologist who will be lecturing in the school
of education in the spring quarter. "This may
not be significant for many women, but it is
interesting for some because they realize they
are locked into certain roles."
Many women let men win at games, dress to
be attractive to men or other women rather than
for themselves and ask questions they already
know answers to. These are just a few examples
from a long list of women's behavior that Krum
boltz said she feels must be re-examined.
Old responses
Calling such behavior "old responses,"
Krumboltz said that women must begin to look
into the ways they have been socialized in terms
of sex roles.
"Women have a lot of inculturated fears we
neverget over," she said. "For example, the fear
of being ostracized by males if we're too intelli
gent, the fearof numbers, the fear of supporting
one's self. . .
Krumboltz' solution is for women to realize
what their present situation is. "When we do
that, there will be certain roles in behavior we
would want to change," she said.
Course
In her spring course "Women's Self-Directed
Re-Education," Krumboltz will be teaching
research-based psychological skills women can
apply to themselves.
The course will focus on specific problems
participants feel. Through lectures, discussions
and readings, students will learn to change their

behavior, she said.
Krumboltz emphasized that the course is "a
reasonable, positive and temperate approach to
the whole issue of sex roles."
No put-down
While others may blame women's socially
conditioned roles on males, Krumboltz said,
"The course does not put anyone down."
Women's problems are the other side of the
coin from men's problems, she explained. For
example, while women are forced to succeed as
mothers and wives, men have to succeed occu
pationally, she said.
Men have their problems too, she observed.
"I hope sometime the course this spring can be
directed to both men and women."
Women's problems
There's nothing that says men cannot take the
course this spring, she quipped. However it is
geared towards women's problems more than
men's."
Krumboltz first became aware of women's
problems through her own experiences. On a
larger scale, she developed interest in the topic
while working on a book called "Changing
Children's Behavior," which she co-authored
with her husband.
She taught in the psychology department at
San Jose State for eight years and for a shorter
period at Berkeley on a part-time basis to ac
commodate both her professional and family
life.
Reflecting her commitment to changing so
cially conditioned sex roles, Krumboltz gave her
two children neutral names which could apply
to both male and female.
