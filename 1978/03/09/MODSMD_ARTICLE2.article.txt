# Medical Center proposes $1000 tuition increase
## 
### Andrea James 
Facing "serious financial prob
lems," University Medical School
administrators have proposed a "one
time increase" of $1000 for 1979-80
tuition, beyond the University's an
nual tuition increase.
"It is necessary to make decisions
now that will prevent an operating
budget deficit of $700,000 in 1978-79,
increasing in future years," Clayton
Rich, dean of the Med School, stated
in a memo to the Med School's
Executive Committee.
Other changes recommended in
Rich's proposal include eliminating
some faculty positions, increasing
vacuity salaries 8 per,cent instead of
10 per cent in 1978-79, reducing
operating costs by $100,000 and re
ducing administrative costs 2 per
cent below projected levels in 1978-
79.
Rich states in the memo that "tui
tion at many comparable medical in
stitutions now exceeds that at Stan
ford."
Although Rich has appointed a
dean's ad hoc committee on tuition
policy which will look into policy re
commendations, he stated in the
memo, "assume here for the pur
pose of budget-planning that there
will be a one-time increase in 1979-80

of $1000 beyond the increase in gen
eral University tuition and that there
after the (Med) school's tuition will
increase by the same percentage as
the rest of the University."
In the past few years, University
tuition has risen approximately 9 per
cent annually.
Rich adds that "no additional stu
dent aid from general funds is as
sumed."
This rise in tuition without addi
tional financial aid considerations
"would increase the operating
budget by $408,000 in 1979-80," ac
cording to the memo.
In the past, scholarships and fi
nancial aid have taken into consider
ation University tuition increases,
said Michael Cowan, Med School fi
nancial aid officer.
"As the cost goes up, more finan
cial aid is made available," she said.
Next year, financial aid will have to
be increased again. Three-quarter
tuition for medical students in 1978-
79 will jump from its present $4695 to
$5130, according to Bob Butler, fi
nance manager of the Med School.
Students majoring in some
specialized fields pay about $240
more per year, Butler said.
Besides raising tuition without
proportional financial aid increases,

Rich proposes the "elimination of 14
authorized but unfilled positions
currently projected in the 1976-77
plan."
In his memo, Rich stated, "In con
sidering a reduction of faculty posi
tions, it is extremely important to be
sure that this is done in such a way as
to least interfere with the long-term
academic strength of the (Med)
School."
Rich's ad hoc committee on tuition
policy is also looking into the prop
osal's "effect on academic cur
riculum and the effect on budget of
the school," according to Thomas
Conda, committee chairman and
professor of psychiatry.
Conda said the committee's eight
members, including faculty, staff and
students, are "looking at as many of
the proposal's parameters as neces
sary."
The committee plans to report its
findings by next May, according to
committee member Alan Garber,
first year med student.
The Stanford Medical Students As
sociation (SMSA) appointed Carber
and Guy Reed, second-year med
student, to the ad hoc committee in
January.
The committee meets every Tues
day night, Gonda said.
