# March of Dimes ending support of prenatal diagnostic programs
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The March of
Dimes is phasing out its support of
programs that can diagnose major birth
defects amid pressure from anti
abortion groups that say parents have
no right to decide whether a deformed
child should be born.
The programs are practically the only
sources of the special prenatal diagnos
tic procedure in the United States.
Spokesmen for the National
Foundation-March of Dimes denied
that pressure from the National Right to
Life Committee Inc. was responsible
for the decision.
Anti-abortion leaders, who first
claimed to have driven the March of
Dimes out of pre-natal screening, test
ing and counseling, say they are not
satisfied with the decision to phase out
— instead of to abruptly terminate —
funding. They say they continue to op
pose giving volunteer help or money to
the March of Dimes campaign.
Long-standing policy
Dr. Arthur Salisbury, medical ser
vices vice president of the National
Foundation, denied the phaseout was
the result of pressure from anti
abortionists, saying the decision fol
lows a long-standing policy of limiting
foundation support to five years. He
also said the board of trustees wants to
concentrate more on improving health
care for pregnant women and newborn
babies.

Some March of Dimes officials, who
asked not to be named, said the phase
out is designed in part to pressure Con
gress into funding a federal program on
genetic diseases.
The decision caught a number of re
cipients of foundation money by sur
prise. There are 83 projects across the
country which stand to lose about $2
million in foundation grants.
Substantial share
The foundation traditionally has
raised a substantial share of its funds
through Mothers' Marches, many of
which are conducted by the parents of
children in Roman Catholic schools.
The dispute between the foundation
and anti-abortion groups involves the
use of a 6-year-old medical procedure
called amniocentesis. The procedure,
usually performed in specially equip
ped clinics, involves insertion of a hol
low needle through a woman's abdo
men into the womb, extraction of some
amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus
and analysis of cast-off fetal cells found
in the fluid.
The foundation and many geneticists
recommend the test for three
categories of pregnant women: those
who have given birth previously to an
infant with a hereditary defect, those
who have reason to believe — through
screening or family history — that they
or their husbands are carrying a defec
tive gene, and those women over 35-

years-old who are pregnant for the first
time. Women in their latter child
bearing years run a dramatically in
creased risk of giving birth to Mon
goloid children.
In June 1976, the Nationai Right to
Life committee adopted a resolution
asking the March of Dimes "to discon
tinue that portion of its activities that
screens for birth defects unless the
purpose is to enhance and continue the
life and well-being of the unborn child.
A spokeswoman for the committee,
Judie Brown, called the foundation's
screening and testing programs
"search and destroy operations" that
seek out handicapped children before
they are born in order to destroy them
by abortion.
Virtually all of the cases in which de
fects were discovered — 2.8 per cent of
all those tested — resulted in abortions,
the March of Dimes says.
Jane Paritsky, president of the
Washington Tay-Sachs foundation, lost
her first child to the always-fatal
neurological disorder, and aborted her
second pregnancy when the test
showed she would give birth to another
Tay-Sachs baby.
"It's very hard to understand why
they're butting in," she said of the
anti-abortion groups. "They're the
ones with the beautiful kids in kinder
garten and I'm the one with a dead
baby."
