Cecil Taylor's music is
probably the most controver
sial issue in the last 20 years of
jazz. As the most avant-garde
member of the avant-garde,
Taylor has been called every
thing from a saint to a demon.
Taylor will be giving a rare
piano recital at Zellerbach
Auditorium in Berkeley this
Sunday evening. Playing with
Taylor will be Paul Bley, an
excellent pianist who rose to
fame as aciompianist to Or
nette Coleman.
The concert will be the an
tithesis of the Herbie
Hancock-Chick Corea affair
of a month ago. Cecil Taylor's
music is absolutely riveting. It
may excite dislike or uneasi
ness, even so it is impossible
not to be hypnotized by the
torrents of sound Taylor pro
duces from his piano.
