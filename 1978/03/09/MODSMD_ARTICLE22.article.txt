## Once around the arts 
### 
Not long ago I was sitting around the
dinner table and for lack of anything
else to do I began to recreate history
through plates, and forks and bowls. To
date I have staged the "Cuban Missile
Crisis," "The Berlin Wall" and most re
cently "Sadat's Visit to Israel."
If all of this seems a little odd to you,
well I'm not surprised, but the fact of
the matter is that there are other people
out there who take everyday objects
and turn them into out-of-place props
for their own amusement.
One such group is the "Duck's
Breath Mystery Theatre" which is com
ing to the Coffee House this Saturday
night. I wouldn't be surprised if they all
showed up wearing spaghetti strainers
on their heads. These guys are para
gons of abnormal psychology. I don't
mean this in a bad way, either. They're
very funny.
Ask me
If you haven't seen them before, I
think this is your best bet of the
weekend. Incidentally, this time
around they're going to hit you for a
cover charge. "Oh, gee guy heck," you
moan. Well, the Special Events people
are seeing if the idea will work so that in
the future they can bring such talent to
the Coffee House again without losing
lots of money. So think of it as an in
vestment in the future, a contribution
to humanity, or whatever, to convince
yourself to part with those greenbacks.
This Saturday and Sunday evenings
"Totentanz" (Dance of Death) will be
danced in Memorial Church. No mod
ern jazz steps though, this is strictly

15th century. One critic wrote (and I am
quoting from the press release now),
"The final bacchantic frenzy for the full
company was awesome. The mass of
bodies dancing . . . and the hurling of
bodies at each other to the frantic light
and sound show was overpowering."
No questions
Well, this sounds like a harmless frat
party to me, but I still wouldn't take any
chances. I advise taking at least two
icons before you go.
The Bridge has taken the trouble to
bring a group here to do a play about
men called "Signals" this weekend. I
have not seen it, but it has gotten good
reviews including the one appearing on
this page and they are very high on it.
I do want to tell you that George C.
Scott is very good in Hemingway's "Is
land's in the Stream" showing at the
Sunday Flicks this week. As I recall,
Hemingway died before he finished the
book, and when you see the movie you
might get the impression that the direc
tor died before he finished the film.
And I'll
This aside, the movie is broken up
into separate sequences that are sort of
compartmentalized revelations about
the main character's life and they are
very well done. Scott not only very
much resembles Hemingway physi
cally, but you get a genuine sense of
what Hemingway was like, at least as he
portrayed himself in his works.
I also recommend "Ninotchka"
showing this Friday at Kresge (the Law
School series). Its kind of corny, but it is

pretty funny. Greta Carbo is a Russian
official in Paris on business (she is
watching some fellow Russians) and
Melvyn Douglas (not Russian, more like
a playboy) falls in love with her; but of
course the inevitable conflict of
socialism and capitalism continually
frustrates the relationship. In the end
peaceful coexistence is ushered in with
a smack on the lips.
Tell you
"Slap Shot" is the Chappie offering
on Saturday night. It is something like
"The Longest Yard" on ice. This is all
the more curious since a woman wrote
the script. I can't imagine that the au
thor grew up in men's locker rooms,
but she has put enough swear words
and moons in bus windows into the
script so that you might believe she did.
Mayer's Monday night films will have
Bergman's "The Seventh Seal" with
Max von Sydow, and also bunch of
other people who have two dots over
all the vowels in their names. The
scenes of medieval Sweden are said to
be pretty catchy and there is a knight
who plays chess with Death while Swe
den is being wiped out by the plague.
No lies
There is also a Mexican movie, "The
Criminal Life of Archibaldo de la Cruz,"
playing with "The Seventh Seal." Ar
chibaldo likes to kill women, but he
fails repeatedly to accompish this task.
In one sequence he drags a wax effigy
to the furnace and watches orgasmi
cally as it writhes in the heat. Maybe all
Archibaldo really wants is a job at
Madame Tussaud's.
