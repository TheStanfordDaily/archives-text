What does it mean to be a
man?
Hang tough, go get 'em. A
real man keeps his feelings to
himself. Be strong, don't try.
Hey, look at that new girl in
class. Work hard. Never give
up. Keep control! Not now,
son, I'm reading the paper.
"Signals," a play created by
the Bear Republic Theater of
Santa Cruz, critically examines
traditional answers to the
question of what it means to be
male.
We saw "Signals" at its Sun
day night standing-room-only
opening at the Julian Theater in
San Francisco. We were very
impressed with what we saw.
Ingenious transitions
Incorporating songs, chil
dren's poetry, clever choreog
raphy and ingenious transi
tions between childhood and
adulthood, "Signals" offers an
unusual and exciting theatrical
experience. The cast of eight is
uniformly excellent, so that it
would be unfair to single out
any one particular actor for
praise.
The play, which evolved out
of the feelings and experiences
of men in the cast, deals with
issues of sexuality, friendship,
working, growing up male,
father-son relationships, and
growing old male.
Out of these issues, several
themes emerge: loneliness,
competition, men's fears and
their inability to express their
feelings.
Basic training
Basic training begins early;
in a particularly effective vig
nette the newspaper which
Daddy hides behind sym
bolizes the barriers which in
hibit communication between
fathers and sons. Unfortu
nately, men take on this inabil
ity to communicate with their
sons from their fathers, prompt
ing Brian Bennett to sing, . .
how we never hugged our
fathers and grew up just like
them."

In "Gotta Do That Woman,"
Lance Rosenbluth plays an
evangelist with a slightly diffe
rent message. His message
hilariously caricatures the per
vasive male "do-it-to-her" ap
proach to sexuality.
'Soft' qualities
In an especially powerful
scene, Jakob Been expresses
his admiration and respect for
friend Pete Gallatin's sensitiv
ity and gentleness. Threatened
by Jakob's recognition of these
"soft" qualities within himself,
Pete rejects the compliments,
turningawayandsaying, "Nah,
I'm just a regular guy." Later
when Jakob affectionately puts
an arm around his friend, Pete
pulls back saying, "Sorry, fella,
I don't go that way. Let's go get
a beer."

For us, "Signals" was a very
emotional and moving experi
ence. While not everyone will
agree with the views expressed
in the play, everyone will rec
ognize aspects of his own
life in the play, perhaps with
laughter, maybe tears. The play
makes both men and women
re-examine what it means to be
a man. "Signals" is a play by
men about men; but deals with
issues which affect all of us.
