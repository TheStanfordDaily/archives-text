## Early Irish art at De Young 
### 
"Treasures of Early Irish Art, 1500 B.C. to
1500 A.D." is the sort of show that calls for
stamina on the part of the viewer who
wants a good look at the work. And, any
one who suffers from claustrophobia is
forewarned!
Despite the problems inherent in view
ing a highly publicized, thus crowded,
exhibit, the De Young Museum in San
Francisco has provided the rare opportun
ity to see these highly coveted pieces. This
is the first display of these works in
America. The curators were remarkably
thoughtful in limiting the display to 70
pieces, which is more than enough for the
initiate to Irish art.
Layout poor
But, unlike the layout for the Chinese
exhibit a few years back, the installation is
less than commendable. Some works
were placed in triangular cases which gave
greater visibility but made the labels un
readable. Spotlights were placed so that a
viewer might get in the way, and block the
view for others. Why not light the cases
from within? Further, a traditional linear
display may seem dull, but it was success
ful for the Renaissance show at the Legion
of Honor because it allowed intimacy with
the works. This is crucial for enjoying the
intricacy of Irish metalwork.
Ireland's history is the history of succes
sive invasions, both by force and by
dogma. Artistic expression began around

2000 8.C., but no pure Irish heritage can
be claimed. There was, rather, the evolu
tion of a hybrid culture that absorbed or
rejected various imposed traditions. After
the Renaissance, Irish isolation from
foreign influence upon visual arts appa
rently caused literary expression to over
shadow visual expression.
There may in fact be a certain connec
tion between the intricate, convoluted,
pagan or mythic imagery of Bronze Age
and Celtic artists and the modern literary
traditions of a nation that fostered writers
like James Joyce. We'll leave that to the
literary critics to decide.
The Celts
The richest of the visual arts came from
the Celtic period of about 400 B.C. to 400
A.D. The Celts originated from the
Mediterranean, perhaps from the Mid-
East. Gaelic, the core of Irish language,
came from the Celts. The geometric and
abstract Bronze Age tradition was embroi
dered with Celtic spirals, and organized
into formal, heraldic patterns after Mid-
Eastern traditions. Celtic motifs, especially
the twist or spiral, survived well into the
medieval period despite Christianization.
The famous Book of Kells is, in fact, an
excellent example of this synthesis. Scho
larly Irish monks, celebrated for their mas
tery of Latin and superiority as educators,
created some of the richest illuminated
manuscripts in Europe. Pagan myth,

folklore, and borrowed visual traditions
were melded into a unique illustrative
form to glorify Christian dogma. These ex
quisite gospels, covered in metal and
jewels and made up of decorated vellum
pages, were used only on the high altar.
They were symbolic of the wealth of religi
ous faith and displayed a luxury that rival
led the eloquence of the text.
Despite contact with continental
Europe, there was apparently no naturalis
tic development in Irish art. Figures and
animals were stylized emblems, but de
spite this, the Irish saw manuscript art as a
miracle in itself, while Renaissance men
attributed god-like powers to a naturalistic
artist like Michelangelo.
For those who have seen color prints of
the Book of Kells, the real books may seem
drab compared to Kodak's version. Age,
wear, and the use of leather for the pages
have dimmed their original luminosity.
Nonetheless, these pages are gems, and
fine examples of the curious wedding of
pagan and Christian imagination, fervor
and skill.
(The show remains in San Francisco
through May 27. Admission is charged. In
formation on special events that are being
held during the display can be obtained by
calling the museum. You may also want to
check on the best time to attend, since it
isn't the sort of show that you can breeze
through!
