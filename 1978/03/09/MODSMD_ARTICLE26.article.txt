# 'Epicoene' fatiguing
## 
### 
The UC-Berkeley theatrical
production of "Epicoene" or,
"The Silent Woman," currently
playing in Zellerbach
Playhouse is a restoration
comedy in the truest sense of
the phrase. Written in the early
seventeenth century by Ben
Jonson, this play concerns it
self primarily with the scheme
of a young gentleman to entice
his uncle into raising his allo
wance and permanently nam
ing him as sole heir.
Said young gentleman (one
"Sir Dauphine") does this by
helping Uncle Morose to es
cape his marriage to the sup
posedly soft-spoken Epicoene.
The director, William Oliver,
has related Jonson's views of
the sexual ethic of his time to
the carnal freedom of today.
He states, "Epicoene is the first
really great and penetrating

play in the English language
about the phenomena of a
sexual revolution." In any
case, he has drowned any in
sights of the author by turning
this play into a long, veneer
like farce. This production en
tertains mostly because of the
fine set, bright costumes, and
jonson's witty dialogue. Speci
fically, the set designed by
Henry May is a reminiscent
mixture between the Elizabet
hian Theatre and our drama
department's recent produc
tion of "The Country Wife."
The general trend of the act
ing approaches an exaggerated
caricature of an obvious sort of
stock character. This is enter
taining at first, but soon be
comes fatiguing as the over
whelming length of the play
weighs the audience down.
Notable exceptions to this are

"Mute the Servant," the
"Pretty Orange Peddler," and
"Sir Amorous La Foole." The
glib speech of Peter Basch to
gether with his serious de
meanor tends to offset his fop
pish exterior and orange wig to
the extent that he is the most
complete character in the pro
duction. Also, many comic
routines like Mute's being
dragged around the stage by a
noose have been added to
make this a very funny piece of
drama.
Performances will continue
each evening at 8 p.m. through
March 8, 9, 10 and 11 at the
Zellerbach Playhouse on the
Berkeley campus. As for the
few flaws in this show, to quote
from the play itself: "What are
six kicks to a man who reads
seneca?"
