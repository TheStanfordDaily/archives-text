# To send miners back to work
## Carter requests court order 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The Carter ad
ministration will go to court today to
seek an immediate back-to-work
order against coal miners, an ad
ministration official said yesterday.
The statement came as a presiden
tial fact-finding panel completed a
one-day hearing into the 93-day coal
strike.
Administration officials said the
president needed only to receive the
panel's report before directing Jus
tice Department attorneys to ask for
the court order.
The fact-finding panel, established
under the Taft-Hartley Act, took tes
timony yesterday from representa
tives of the striking United Mine
Workers union and from the soft coal
industry, then began writing its re
port to the president.
The government will seek the
order in U.S. District Court in
Washington this afternoon, "assum
ing the president gets the report,"
the administration official said.
The chairman of the presidential
panel said he expected the report to
be completed by noon today.
The official said the request for a
temporary restraining order would
name more than 1000 union locals
and officials and coal companies as
defendants.
Officials said other defendants will
be UMW construction miners and
member companies of the American
Bituminous Contractors, who are
negotiating a separate agreement.
The government is prepared to
seek contempt citations and fines
against defendants violating the
back-to-work order, the official said,
adding:
"There's not much point in getting
the order if you're not ready to en
force it."
But it was not immediately clear
how soon miners would return to
work. The order the government
would seek presumably would re

main in force until a judge could hear
arguments on a request for an 80-day
injunction.
UMW President Arnold Miller said
yesterday that miners would likely
disobey a back-to-work order by the
thousands, and government officials
said mines would have to be in
spected as a safety precaution before
miners would be allowed under
ground.
As the administration worked
under the Taft-Hartley Act, there
were preliminary indications of re
newed attempts to negotiate a na
tional contract.
It was understood that chief fed
eral mediator Wayne Horvitz met
yesterday with two top industry offi
cials.
Administration officials have said
previously industrywide bargaining
appeared all but hopeless in light of a
weekend contract rejection by the
160,000 striking miners.
But neither the industry nor the
union's top leadership favors
company-by-company contract set
tlements because of the uncertainty
it would mean for their organiza
tions.
"I've come to the conclusion that a
collective bargaining impasse has
been reached," declared John Gen
try, chairman of the Taft-Hartley
board of inquiry, after the board
concluded its six-hour closed-door
hearing.
After listening to 50 witnesses,
mostly UMW officials, Gentry said
there were "deep divisions" within
the union.
"The problem is their union con
cerns vary all over the lot. . .itwould
be difficult to see any settlement" in
the next few days, Gentry told repor
ters.
At the hearing, both Joseph Bren
nan, a spokesman for the Bituminous
Coal Operators Association, and
UMW Vice President Sam Church,

criticized the administration handl
ing of the strike.
The administration continued to
discourage talk of possible legisla
tion to seize the idle mines, hoping
that enough miners would obey a
court order to increase coal produc
tion significantly.
But Carter's top spokesman con
ceded no option could be ruled out
as the administration sought an end
to the long and disruptive strike.
Many union officials and miners
prefer seizure legislation to a Taft-
Hartley injunction, primarily be
cause the government would set
wages and working conditions under
legislation.
