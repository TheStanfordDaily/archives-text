Black guerrilla input urged by U.S.
Washington — The Carter administration gave
lukewarm support yesterday to an agreement to end
all-white rule in Rhodesia and urged that black guerrilla
leaders be included in any settlement in that country.
Bishop Abel Muzorewa, one of three black nationalist
leaders who signed the historic agreement, said after
meeting with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, "I believe
we have explained our case.
"I'm left with the impression that he's going to con
sider it carefully," he said.
But immediately afterward, the department said the
United States and Britain will keep working with the
Patriotic Front in an attempt to bring its guerrilla heads
together with Muzorewa and his allies.
"We regard the arrangement agreed to in Salisbury as
another stage in the process of political change in
Rhodesia," the department said in a statement read by
spokesman Tom Reston.
Vance planned to meet later with British Foreign Sec
retary David Owen and go with him to the White House
for a meeting there with President Jimmy Carter.
The Patriotic Front has denounced the agreement
signed with Rhodesian Prime Minister lan Smith last
Friday as "the biggest sellout in African history" and
vowed to fight on until total military victory.
Blackout hits San Diego County
San Diego — An explosion at a generating plant yes
terday touched off a massive, 4'/2-hour power blackout
that left more than one million San Diego County resi
dents without power and briefly trapped dozens of per
sons in elevators of high-rise office buildings.
"Everything is back together," said Carl Welti, a
spokesman for San Diego Cas & Electric. "As of 7:40
p.m., service was restored to all customers. We have

one generator, however, that is still waiting to come on
line if it is needed."
The blackout began at 3:11 p.m., forcing hospitals to
switch to emergency generators and leaving civilians to
untangle traffic snarls caused by non-functioning traffic
signals.
At least 10 elderly persons visiting City Hall for a senior
citizen's picture-taking day were stuck in four stalled
elevators in the 14-story building, said Otto Bos, press
aide to Mayor Pete Wilson.
"It caused a great deal of anxiety and took the fire
department to get them out," Bos said, adding that a
number of the people needed oxygen rescucitation to
"get them back on their feet."
Strike affects economic mainstays
Pittsburgh — Automakers and steel producers, pillars
of the U.S. economy, are feeling the coal strike's pinch,
but they say it doesn't hurt too much yet.
"We'd prefer to have everything back to normal, but
we've been able to adjust so far," said a spokesman for
Republic Steel, the nation's fourth-largest producer.
There are problems. Both industries — which are in
terdependent — warn there could be severe layoffs if
utilities curtail use of coal-generated electricity beyond
present levels.
A scattered handful of auto component and steel
making plants have cut working hours in Indiana, West
Virginia and Pennsylvania. But the cuts have been mini
mal, and little production has been lost.
Steel shipments to automakers have been only fair,
but the reasons have little to do with the coal strike.
People simply are not buying as many cars this year as
producers had expected.
Last month, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler were
warning that some or all of their plants could be shut if 50

per cent electricity curtailments, which then seemed
likely, went into effect.
Canal treaty battle will be close
Washington — Senate leaders said yesterday the mar
gin of difference on the Panama Canal treaties is so close
that next week's first ratification showdown may be set
tled by one or two votes.
That assessment was offered by Majority Leader
Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.) and his Republican counterpart,
Minority Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee.
The estimate squared with that of treaty opponents
who are looking for votes to block ratification of the first
of the two treaties — the neutrality pact —when it comes
to the floor next Thursday.
The two treaties provide for the turnover of the canal
to Panama by the year 2000, with the United States and
Panama to share responsibility for its neutrality and de
fense after that.
Ratification requires a two-thirds majority, 67 if all
senators are present. By the same token, anti-treaty
forces would need 34 votes to kill the pacts.
Fed Chairman Miller installed
Washington — Industrialist C. William Miller was in
stalled yesterday as chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, and outgoing chairman Arthur Burns got a stand
ing ovation at the White House ceremony.
Miller, former board chairman of Textron, Inc., also
received standing applause after he had taken his oath
from Chief Justice Warren Burger and had forecast "a
recognition of self-confidence" throughout the nation.
President jimmy Carter, host for the affair, brought a
crowd of governmental and congressional dignitaries to
its feet when he saluted Burns, a Republican appointee,
for absolute integrity, competence, courage." He said
the country owes Burns a "deep debt" and expressed
personal thanks for the retired chairman's work.
After citing Miller's accomplishments, Carter said the
chairmanship of the central bank ranks second only to
the presidency and the White House as "most influential
in shaping our economic strength in the future."
Lance contempt citation requested
Washington — Attorneys for a major bank holding
company yesterday asked federal court to find Bert
Lance, former Carter administration budget director, in
contempt of court for allegedly walking out on a court
ordered interrogation.
The attorneys for the Washington-based Financial
General Bankshares Inc. asked foran immediate hearing
in U.S. District Court which was later scheduled for 2
p.m. today.
Lance and his Washington attorney were not available
for comment.
The request for "an appropriate sanction," including a
contempt citation against Lance, was included in a mo
tion by the Financial General attorneys asking for a tem
porary restraining order to bar Lance and other defen
dants from acquiring more stock in the $2 billion firm
which operates banks in Maryland, Virginia and
Washington, D.C.
UC admission standards challenged
Sacramento — The University of California's tightened
new admissions standards were challenged in court yes
terday by legal groups who claimed state school
Superintendent Wilson Riles ignored a conflict of in
terest in casting the deciding vote.
Riles denied any conflict of interest in his non-salary
membership on the American College Testing board of
directors. A spokesman for the state political watchdog
commission, which enforces the law in question, dis
puted the suit's interpretation of the law.
The suit was filed in Sacramento Superior Court by
California Rural Legal Assistance, the Western Center on

Law and Poverty and Public Advocates. They asked for a
court injunction to block the new standards from taking
effect in 1979.
