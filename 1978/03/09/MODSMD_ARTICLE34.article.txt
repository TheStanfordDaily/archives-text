# USE office locks replaced by Berk
## 
### 
The locks to the United Stanford Employees (USE)
office were changed yesterday morning by Jim Berk, the
union's secretary who was fired during Tuesday's mem
bership meeting.
Berk said he made the change because "one of the
ex-employees hasn't turned it (the old key) in and I don't
know who has it."
In addition, Berk said he believed someone was in the
office on Tuesday night while the meeting was in prog
ress.
Berk said he still considers himself to be a USE
employee and union secretary. "They made their move
but they now have to find the power to enforce it,"he
said.
USE Reporter Bob Britton, a candidate for USE presi
dent in the union's April 4 general election, said he
considered Berk to no longer be a USE employee and
union officer. He said several people will meet with a
lawyer today to decide how to handle the situation.
Britton said he expects Berk to be voted out of his
union position after the April election. "As soon as we
get a new executive committee, there should be no
problem," Britton said.
"Most (people he had spoken to) seem to agree with
me that it's time we got rid of him," he said.
Berk said that several people tried to "bully" him out
of the USE office yesterday morning without success.
