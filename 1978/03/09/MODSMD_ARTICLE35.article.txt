# Final Western Civ proposals made to C-US by task force
## 
### Peter Brett 
From one to six courses should be offered to satisfy
the Western Culture Requirement, according to the final
report of the Western Culture task force, released yes
terday to the Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US).
An experimental version of the requirement, enrol
ling 75 to 100 students, should begin next year, recom
mended the task force report. The following year about
250 students will be invited to take the course.
Courses approved as satisfying the requirement must
include the study of a considerable number of primary
works, according to the report. Further, the courses
must deal with more than one national and linguistic
sub-culture. As an example, a course on Britain and the
United States would not qualify, the report stated.
If lectures are at the heart of the course, it must also
involve a minimum of two hours of small group instruc
tion each week. These groups must be taught by regular
members of the faculty or by an instructor with a Ph.D.,
according to the report.
The results of a task force survey in which 30 per cent
of faculty responded, showed 27.3 per cent of the sur
veyed faculty in favor of having western culture courses
to fill existing distribution requirements and 51 per cent
in favor of reassessing the whole set of requirements.
However, the task force recommended that the study
of western culture should not satisfy the existing dis
tribution requirements.
In light of the 16.6 per cent of the surveyed faculty who
favored the required study of some non-western cul

ture, and the 22.3 per cent who felt a course in western
culture should include a good deal of material drawn
from non-western cultures, the task force also infor
mally recommended that all undergraduates be strongly
urged to take at least one course in a non-western cul
ture.
Three out of four historical periods, ancient,
medieval, early modern and modern, must also be co
vered by the courses, the report stated.
The task force further recommended that a committee
on the Western Culture Requirement be formed to
evaluate the courses offered during the first three years
that the requirement takes effect. If the committee de
termines the requirement is unsatisfactory, it would
reopen the question with C-US and the Faculty Senate.
In addition, the committee will help organize courses by
recruiting faculty members to participate in them.
The pri mary advantage of allowing choice from among
a number of courses, stated the report, "is that it would
be possible to present a variety of perspectives on West
ern Culture according to the different abilities,
specialized interests and preferences of faculty mem
bers, and possible for students to select courses that suit
their own interests."
"The major argument against choice," the task force
report stated, "is precisely the loss of the common intel
lectual experience that we value so highly. . . . Unless
some fairly arbitrary upper limit were set on the number
of courses, there would be a danger of an unlimited
proliferation like that which plagued and ruined the
humanities sequences."
