# Opinions on S. Africa mixed
## 
### Joel Dickholtz News analysis 
After talking with students and employees study
ing, eating, writing and playing chess in the Coffee
House, it is clear that the Stanford community holds
no single opinion on the South African controversy.
Furthermore, despite the issue's scope, many of
those questioned were well informed on the subject.
A selection of anonymous opinions follows.
"I think we should divest. But the problem is that
students have been alienating the administration and
vice versa. I can see that SCRIP'S image is drooping
because they're doing some absurd things like the
candlelight march."
"Both trustees and students are serving to polarize
the forces on campus, and neither side is making an
effort to understand the other's point of view. They
may never reach a decision, and if they don't, the
trustees will win out."
"I think that at this state of the game the corpora
tions in South Africa would do more good in (South
Africa)."
"I don't think Stanford should necessarily take out
its investments. I don't think South Africa is much

worse than many other countries as far as tainted
money."
"Should Stanford divest? Absolutely. The idea that
they're helping South Africans by staying in is
baloney."
"I agree with him."
"I don't really have an opinion."
"We should listen to the people who know the
situation best, the people in South Africa. They want
us out."
"I don't know a damn thing."
"In answering the question, Stanford should fol
low its collective conscience. But sometimes the col
lective wallet gets in the way of the conscience."
"I don't know anything."
"The American investments in South Africa serve
simply to maintain the economic system and the
status quo."
"I'm for divesting."
"I really couldn't say."
"No opinion, I can't decide."
"I haven't really decided yet. The issues are clear,
but the decision is not."
"Oh . . . does Stanford invest in South Africa?"
(This is the fourth part in a continuing series.)


Coffee House customers recently gave their opinions on
