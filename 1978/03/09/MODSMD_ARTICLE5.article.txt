# Political organizations seek candidates
## 
### Emily Sachar 
Both Democratic and Republican organizations
here hope to attract speakers to debate before the
June primary election, according to organization
spokespersons.
Several races promise to be heated and intense,
said Paul Cheverton, president of Stanford Col
lege Republicans. The Republican primary decid
ing on an opponent for Democratic Gov. Jerry
Brown will be especially exciting, he said.
"Setting up a forum is our main priority right
now due to the large number (five) of candidates
seeking the Republican gubernatorial slot,"
Cheverton said.
It is hoped that the forum, scheduled for early
May, will be aired on educational television,
Cheverton said.
Republican plans
Republicans here will also concentrate on other
races, both local and statewide.
"Certainly the race for governor is the most in
teresting but the assemblyman race will also be a
point of emphasis. In a sense things are quite
fragmented in the primary because there are so
many different candidates vying for students' at
tention," Cheverton said.
The Democratic governor's race is less competi
tive because an incumbent is running. Hence

Stanford Democrats have chosen to spend a good
deal of time in the upcoming months reading
through the various propositions on the June bal
lot, according to Stanford Democrat Rick Weber.
A committee of students reads the propositions,
decides on its position on each and presents that
stand to the Stanford Democrats in short presenta
tions to help inform other Democrats, according
to Weber.
Umbrella group
Weber said that the Stanford Democrats will
then act as an umbrella organization, setting up
tables to distribute information on propositions
and candidates. They will also organize vote ral
lies, he added.
Both Republicans and Democrats plan voter re
gistration drives for the upcoming elections. The
League of Women Voters and the county registrar
have helped with this task in the past, according to
Weber.
In addition to the work of partisan groups here,
the Stanford Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE) plans various activities for the upcoming
elections, both primary and general. SCOPE is a
non-partisan organization designed to bring a
range of candidates and speakers here to talk on a
variety of political issues.
"In coordination wtoh the Speakers Bureau

we're going to run a program on the Republican
gubernatorial race. We've invited the five Repub
licans and we hope a strong educational debate
will ensue, without a lot of bickering," Alex Alben,
co-chairman of SCOPE, said.
SCOPE would also like to bring jerry Brown to
campus, Alben said.
Tax initiative
The Jarvis-Gann property tax initiative may also
draw large interest here, Alben said. SCOPE hopes
to attract both proponents and opponents of the
legislation to speak here in an open debate.
The legislation proposes to limit property taxes
to 1 per cent of the full cash value of the property.
It also requires a two-thirds vote of the legislature
or electorate to increase any state tax.
SCOPE also will help students or organizations
who want to plan programs or debates, Alben said.
"We get excited about bringing a person here to
speak on a controversial issue. We'll also try to
find a speaker to represent the counter-point. If
applicable we'll get a movie to graphically repre
sent the issue," Alben said.
As the general election nears SCOPE will shift its
focus somewhat to work on voter registration
drives and on helping students arrange for absen
tee voting.

or electorate to increase any state tax.
SCOPE also will help students or organizations
who want to plan programs or debates, Alben said.
"We get excited about bringing a person here to
speak on a controversial issue. We'll also try to
find a speaker to represent the counter-point. If
applicable we'll get a movie to graphically repre
sent the issue," Alben said.
As the general election nears SCOPE will shift its
focus somewhat to work on voter registration
drives and on helping students arrange for absen
tee voting.
Both Democratic and Republican organizations
here hope to attract speakers to debate before the
June primary election, according to organization
spokespersons.
Several races promise to be heated and intense,
said Paul Cheverton, president of Stanford Col
lege Republicans. The Republican primary decid
ing on an opponent for Democratic Gov. Jerry
Brown will be especially exciting, he said.
"Setting up a forum is our main priority right
now due to the large number (five) of candidates
seeking the Republican gubernatorial slot,"
Cheverton said.
It is hoped that the forum, scheduled for early
May, will be aired on educational television,
Cheverton said.
Republican plans
Republicans here will also concentrate on other
races, both local and statewide.
"Certainly the race for governor is the most in
teresting but the assemblyman race will also be a
point of emphasis. In a sense things are quite
fragmented in the primary because there are so
many different candidates vying for students' at
tention," Cheverton said.
The Democratic governor's race is less competi
tive because an incumbent is running. Hence

Stanford Democrats have chosen to spend a good
deal of time in the upcoming months reading
through the various propositions on the June bal
lot, according to Stanford Democrat Rick Weber.
A committee of students reads the propositions,
decides on its position on each and presents that
stand to the Stanford Democrats in short presenta
tions to help inform other Democrats, according
to Weber.
Umbrella group
Weber said that the Stanford Democrats will
then act as an umbrella organization, setting up
tables to distribute information on propositions
and candidates. They will also organize vote ral
lies, he added.
Both Republicans and Democrats plan voter re
gistration drives for the upcoming elections. The
League of Women Voters and the county registrar
have helped with this task in the past, according to
Weber.
In addition to the work of partisan groups here,
the Stanford Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE) plans various activities for the upcoming
elections, both primary and general. SCOPE is a
non-partisan organization designed to bring a
range of candidates and speakers here to talk on a
variety of political issues.
"In coordination wtoh the Speakers Bureau

we're going to run a program on the Republican
gubernatorial race. We've invited the five Repub
licans and we hope a strong educational debate
will ensue, without a lot of bickering," Alex Alben,
co-chairman of SCOPE, said.
SCOPE would also like to bring jerry Brown to
campus, Alben said.
Tax initiative
The Jarvis-Gann property tax initiative may also
draw large interest here, Alben said. SCOPE hopes
to attract both proponents and opponents of the
legislation to speak here in an open debate.
The legislation proposes to limit property taxes
to 1 per cent of the full cash value of the property.
It also requires a two-thirds vote of the legislature
or electorate to increase any state tax.
SCOPE also will help students or organizations
who want to plan programs or debates, Alben said.
