# Support mine workers
## 
### 
About 160,000 members of the Un
ited Mine Workers of America have
been on strike for over three
months. This strike has become one
of the most important and hardest
fought labor battles in many years.
The miners' main demand is for
the right to strike. This right is
needed because it would provide the
only effective way to demand redress
of grievances. Grievances could in
clude cuts in benefits (last year there
were wild-cat strikes following cuts
in the medical plan) and unsafe work
ing conditions.
Underground coal mining is the
most dangerous industrial occupa
tion. In 1977, 125 miners were killed
on the job. In 1975, the underground
coal mining industry had more than
three times the number of disabling
injuries per worker-hour as the na
tional, all-industries average. The
right to strike could well mean the
right to refuse to work in an unsafe
mine.
Over the last weekend, the miners
rejected, by a two to one margin, a
proposed contract. On Monday,
President Jimmy Carter invoked the
Taft-Hartley Act. One possible result
of this action is the appearance of the

Army on the coal fields. So the min
ers may be forced to fight the State as
well as capitalists, scabs and labor
"leaders."
But fighting is nothing new to the
coal miners, and they remember the
fiercest fight miners and owners
have ever had. In 1913 and 1914, the
coal miners of Southern Colorado
were on strike. Their demands in
cluded enforcement of existing min
ing laws and recognition of the un
ion. After many skirmishes between
strikers and company guards, a com
pany of the Colorado National Guard
and a cavalry troop were stationed
near the town of Ludlow in April
1914.
On April 20, the National Guard
opened fire with machine guns and
rifles on the miners' tent colony and
then burned it to the ground. Several
miners were killed by the shooting
and two women and 11 children were
killed by flames or smoke. For 10
days, there was open warfare bet
ween the militia and miners who had
survived the massacre or who came
from other districts to help.
O.V. Hirsch, a coal miner and a
member of the Miners' Right to
Strike Committee, has written and

Dave Hultquist

recorded a song called "Bloody Lud
low." The song tells the story of the
Ludlow Massacre. It says that the
militia, the local civil authorities, and
the juries all worked for the com
panies and that the principle owner
of the largest company, John D. Roc
kefeller, jr., couldn't care less about
the conditions of his employees. But
it also says that, whatever came up
against them, they stayed strong and
united and kept fighting back. The
record is being used to raise funds
for the strikers.
In his song, Hirsch sings, "We'll
remember Bloody Ludlow as a min
ers' victory 'cause they fought back."
For the last three months, the miners
have again found it necessary to fight
back. Hopefully, Carter will take a
lesson from history and not promote
violence by sending in troops. The
miners will continue to fight until
they have a victory.
A victory for the miners and their
union will be a victory for all groups
opposed to those who exploit
people for profit. Support the min
ers.

Underground coal mining is the
most dangerous industrial occupa
tion. In 1977, 125 miners were killed
on the job. In 1975, the underground
coal mining industry had more than
three times the number of disabling
injuries per worker-hour as the na
tional, all-industries average. The
right to strike could well mean the
right to refuse to work in an unsafe
mine.
Over the last weekend, the miners
rejected, by a two to one margin, a
proposed contract. On Monday,
President Jimmy Carter invoked the
Taft-Hartley Act. One possible result
of this action is the appearance of the

Army on the coal fields. So the min
ers may be forced to fight the State as
well as capitalists, scabs and labor
"leaders."
But fighting is nothing new to the
coal miners, and they remember the
fiercest fight miners and owners
have ever had. In 1913 and 1914, the
coal miners of Southern Colorado
were on strike. Their demands in
cluded enforcement of existing min
ing laws and recognition of the un
ion. After many skirmishes between
strikers and company guards, a com
pany of the Colorado National Guard
and a cavalry troop were stationed
near the town of Ludlow in April
1914.
On April 20, the National Guard
opened fire with machine guns and
rifles on the miners' tent colony and
then burned it to the ground. Several
miners were killed by the shooting
and two women and 11 children were
killed by flames or smoke. For 10
days, there was open warfare bet
ween the militia and miners who had
survived the massacre or who came
from other districts to help.
O.V. Hirsch, a coal miner and a
member of the Miners' Right to
Strike Committee, has written and

Dave Hultquist

recorded a song called "Bloody Lud
low." The song tells the story of the
Ludlow Massacre. It says that the
militia, the local civil authorities, and
the juries all worked for the com
panies and that the principle owner
of the largest company, John D. Roc
kefeller, jr., couldn't care less about
the conditions of his employees. But
it also says that, whatever came up
against them, they stayed strong and
united and kept fighting back. The
record is being used to raise funds
for the strikers.
In his song, Hirsch sings, "We'll
remember Bloody Ludlow as a min
ers' victory 'cause they fought back."
For the last three months, the miners
have again found it necessary to fight
back. Hopefully, Carter will take a
lesson from history and not promote
violence by sending in troops. The
miners will continue to fight until
they have a victory.
A victory for the miners and their
union will be a victory for all groups
opposed to those who exploit
people for profit. Support the min
ers.

About 160,000 members of the Un
ited Mine Workers of America have
been on strike for over three
months. This strike has become one
of the most important and hardest
fought labor battles in many years.
The miners' main demand is for
the right to strike. This right is
needed because it would provide the
only effective way to demand redress
of grievances. Grievances could in
clude cuts in benefits (last year there
were wild-cat strikes following cuts
in the medical plan) and unsafe work
ing conditions.
