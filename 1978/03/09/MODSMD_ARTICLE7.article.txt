Christ provides resources
As Biblically-based — "born again"
— Christians, we are concerned with
the misconceptions apparent in the
column of Pan Demetrakakes (Daily,
Feb. 27). We believe that the mes
sage of our faith cannot be evaluated
by simply observing actions carried
out "in the name of Christ," for often
these activities are in fact contrary to
His teaching.
Rather, Christianity should be
judged on the attitudes and actions
of those who are openly committed
to allowing Christ to live out in them
a life consistent with, and subject to,

Cod's will and the authority of Scrip
ture. A committed Christian,
acknowledging the true sovereignty
of Cod, could not aspire to worldly
power as a means of coercion or
manipulation, as Demetrakakes
fears.
Instead, a Christian views a posi
tion of leadership as an opportunity
for service, both to God and to man.
Jesus set the example when Satan of
fered Him, in vain, "all the kingdoms
of the world, and their glory" if He
would worship him (Matt. 4:8). )esus
considered His service to God the
purpose for His life, and chose to

take the form of a bondservant and to
be obedient even unto death on a
cross.
Yet, Christ considered His obedi
ence to Cod to include condemna
tion of sin — not the sinner — as
demonstrated by His entire earthly
ministry. He saw that sin was depriv
ing people of the abundant lives that
God desired for them and that His
holiness requires.
This is the approach that must be
taken with sin, be it hate, sexual per
version or deceit. With love, in rec
ognition of the existence of sin
within himself, a Christian is able to
present a means of redemption —
the atoning blood of Christ.
A Christian's faith does not come
by way of supersitition, but through
acknowledgement of historical evi
dence and personal experience.
Through many centuries, speaking
through the history of Israel and her
prophets, God has revealed to us our
origin, our nature, and most of all,
His provision for bringing us back
into fellowship with Him.
It is clear throughout history that
man has fallen short of his full poten
tial. No one can doubt the perilous
position mankind is in — we are not
now, and never have been, at peace
with each other or ourselves, lesus
Christ does not offer an escape from
these problems, but provides us with
resources to overcome them.

We, the members of the B'nai
B'rith Hillel Foundation of Stanford
University, are very concerned about
legislation currently before the U.S.
Congress which will, among other
things, affect the native Americans.

We feel it is unethical for the United
States to consider such actions which
violate the spirit of our treaties with
the native Americans and endanger
the existence of local native Ameri
can communities.
As Jews, we are well aware of the
need to affirm and enrich our indi

and, therefore, we join with the Na

all Americans to seriously consider
the effect of these bills on the lifes

On the one hand, Kim Wentz
(Christians Stereotyped, Daily, Feb.
6) appears to accept the )ewish law
that "had already defined sin
adequately" (which includes
Leviticus 18:22, 24-30 — hardly an
"obscure reference"), while on the
other she presumes to have our Lord
condemning Anita Bryant for her
crusade for the upholding of a sig
nificant aspect of that law. I don't see
how she can have it both ways.
)esus may have, as Wentz declares,
"associated with . . . 'sinners' '
(whatever they are), but he also as
sociated with sinners. This fact does
not, however, mean that he con
doned sin or took no stand against it.
Indeed, without equivocation he is
sued the unmistakable command,
"Co, and sin no more."

that "had already defined sin
adequately" (which includes
Leviticus 18:22, 24-30 — hardly an

other she presumes to have our Lord
condemning Anita Bryant for her
crusade for the upholding of a sig
nificant aspect of that law. I don't see
how she can have it both ways.
)esus may have, as Wentz declares,
"associated with . . . 'sinners' '
(whatever they are), but he also as
sociated with sinners. This fact does
not, however, mean that he con

Indeed, without equivocation he is

"Co, and sin no more."

As Biblically-based — "born again"
— Christians, we are concerned with
the misconceptions apparent in the
column of Pan Demetrakakes (Daily,
Feb. 27). We believe that the mes
sage of our faith cannot be evaluated
by simply observing actions carried
out "in the name of Christ," for often
these activities are in fact contrary to
His teaching.
Rather, Christianity should be
judged on the attitudes and actions
of those who are openly committed
to allowing Christ to live out in them
a life consistent with, and subject to,

Cod's will and the authority of Scrip
ture. A committed Christian,
acknowledging the true sovereignty
of Cod, could not aspire to worldly
power as a means of coercion or
manipulation, as Demetrakakes
fears.
Instead, a Christian views a posi
tion of leadership as an opportunity
for service, both to God and to man.
Jesus set the example when Satan of
fered Him, in vain, "all the kingdoms
of the world, and their glory" if He
would worship him (Matt. 4:8). )esus
considered His service to God the
purpose for His life, and chose to

take the form of a bondservant and to
be obedient even unto death on a
cross.
Yet, Christ considered His obedi
ence to Cod to include condemna
tion of sin — not the sinner — as
demonstrated by His entire earthly
ministry. He saw that sin was depriv
ing people of the abundant lives that
God desired for them and that His
holiness requires.
This is the approach that must be
taken with sin, be it hate, sexual per
version or deceit. With love, in rec
ognition of the existence of sin
within himself, a Christian is able to
present a means of redemption —
the atoning blood of Christ.
