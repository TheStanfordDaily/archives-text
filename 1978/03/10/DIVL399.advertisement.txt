Your honesty hurt me as often as it did yoursel!
But il was the truth the lifespnng of existence
We built Xanadu on a fault line Friday you
provided the earthquake Still, after lunch yester
day I thought we could continue plus see others
Then you played more games providing the de
structive aftershock
My actions with MP were the same as with MS
the diflerence your reaction I despise deceit and
tight it when I confront it
We can never reconcile because of our fun
damental difference on the molality of deceit, but
yet I'll think ot ours as the best of times & the
worst of times and 111 always love you
