# At Medical Center
## Potential chemical blast averted 
### Mike Charlson 
A pressurized thermos bottle
believed to be potentially explo
sive was removed from the Medi
cal Center Surgical Pathology Lab
by Palo Alto firemen about 2:45
yesterday afternoon.
The bottle, which contained a
mixture of dry ice and methyl
butane, was accidentally sealed a
few days ago when someone put
the lid on it too tightly, according
to Dr. Ronald Dorfmann, co
director of surgical pathology.
Dorfmann said after trying un
successfully to open the bottle
and relieve the pressure which
was building up due to vaporizing
dry ice, people from the health
and safety division of the Medical

Center were called to remove the
bottle.
'Sincerely doubted'
He said he "sincerely doubted"
that the bottlewould explode, but
he called safety as a precaution
since the lab is in close proximity
to operating rooms and intensive
care units.
Even if the bottle did explode,
Dorfmann said, it would have
been a very small explosion.
Safety personnel called the Palo
Alto Fire Department to get
"some assistance and advice" on
how to dispose of the bottle, ac
cording to Hilary Ryniewicz, a
health and safety officials.
The fire department re
sponded, however, with two en

gine companies, an "overreac
tion" according to Ryniewicz. Fire
officials on the scene evacuated
the mediate area and then re
moved the bottle by placing it in a
waste paper basket which had
been protectively lined.
Transported bottle
Later, Stanford police trans
ported the bottle in the bomb
trailer to the old quarry off Page
Mill Road where it was destroyed,
according to Police Chief Marvin
Herrington.
After the Fire Department ar
rived, fire officials said they felt
the bottle likely did not pose
much threat.
"The only hazard there was was

the pressure inside the con
tainer," said William Moon, fire
department battalion chief.
"There was no way to release it
(the pressure) so we had to re
move it. But . don't think there
was ever the potential of a large
explosion."
He said the fire department,
when dispatched, had been told
the gas involved was methyl
bromide, not methyl butane. Ac
cording to Fire Department Cap
tain Gil Barreira, methyl bromide
is highly toxic and potentially
fatal. The gas can permeate the
skin and cause delayed reactions.
Methyl bromide is really bad
stuff," he said.
Relatively safe
By comparison, however,
methyl butane is relatively safe. It
is flammable, but not explosive
and not very toxic. Officials said
that any explosion would have

been the result of pressure on the
vessel and the hazard would have
been shrapnal from the bottle it
self caused by the explosion.
Methyl butane and dry ice mix
tures are used to instantly freeze
tissue samples from biopsies so
they can be examined for possible
malignancies. The procedure,
generally known as a frozen sec
tion, can tell a surgeon whetheror
not a tumor is cancerous before
he performs a radical surgical
technique, according to Gail
Moose, administrative assistant in
the lab. It has the advantage of
being a fast procedure which can
be completed while the patient is
still under anesthesia.
Moon said that though the
danger was not great, safety offi
cials had acted with appropriate
caution in calling in fire officials.
But he added that while there was
potentially a problem, it was no
thing that was going to level the
room."

move it. But . don't think there
was ever the potential of a large
explosion."
He said the fire department,
when dispatched, had been told
the gas involved was methyl
bromide, not methyl butane. Ac
cording to Fire Department Cap
tain Gil Barreira, methyl bromide
is highly toxic and potentially
fatal. The gas can permeate the
skin and cause delayed reactions.
Methyl bromide is really bad
stuff," he said.
Relatively safe
By comparison, however,
methyl butane is relatively safe. It
is flammable, but not explosive
and not very toxic. Officials said
that any explosion would have

been the result of pressure on the
vessel and the hazard would have
been shrapnal from the bottle it
self caused by the explosion.
Methyl butane and dry ice mix
tures are used to instantly freeze
tissue samples from biopsies so
they can be examined for possible
malignancies. The procedure,
generally known as a frozen sec
tion, can tell a surgeon whetheror
not a tumor is cancerous before
he performs a radical surgical
technique, according to Gail
Moose, administrative assistant in
the lab. It has the advantage of
being a fast procedure which can
be completed while the patient is
still under anesthesia.

danger was not great, safety offi
cials had acted with appropriate
caution in calling in fire officials.

potentially a problem, it was no

A pressurized thermos bottle
believed to be potentially explo
sive was removed from the Medi
cal Center Surgical Pathology Lab
by Palo Alto firemen about 2:45
yesterday afternoon.
The bottle, which contained a
mixture of dry ice and methyl
butane, was accidentally sealed a
few days ago when someone put
the lid on it too tightly, according
to Dr. Ronald Dorfmann, co
director of surgical pathology.
Dorfmann said after trying un
successfully to open the bottle
and relieve the pressure which
was building up due to vaporizing
dry ice, people from the health
and safety division of the Medical

Center were called to remove the
bottle.
'Sincerely doubted'
He said he "sincerely doubted"
that the bottlewould explode, but
he called safety as a precaution
since the lab is in close proximity
to operating rooms and intensive
care units.
Even if the bottle did explode,
Dorfmann said, it would have
been a very small explosion.
Safety personnel called the Palo
Alto Fire Department to get
"some assistance and advice" on
how to dispose of the bottle, ac
cording to Hilary Ryniewicz, a
health and safety officials.
The fire department re
sponded, however, with two en

gine companies, an "overreac
tion" according to Ryniewicz. Fire
officials on the scene evacuated
the mediate area and then re
moved the bottle by placing it in a
waste paper basket which had
been protectively lined.
Transported bottle
Later, Stanford police trans
ported the bottle in the bomb
trailer to the old quarry off Page
Mill Road where it was destroyed,
according to Police Chief Marvin
Herrington.
After the Fire Department ar
rived, fire officials said they felt
the bottle likely did not pose
much threat.
