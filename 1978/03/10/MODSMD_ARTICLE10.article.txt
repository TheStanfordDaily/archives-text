# Supreme court will decide?
## Nuclear plant insurance unconstitutional 
### 
Randall Schutt

If an accident occurs at a nuclear
power plant and you are injured or
your property is damaged or con
taminated by radiation, it is possible
that you will be unable to recoup
your losses. The Price-Anderson Act,
passed by Congress in 1957, limits
the liability of a utility for a nuclear
accident to $560 million (of which the
federal government covers $435 mill
ion).
You and other damaged parties
can not sue for more than $560 mill
ion. If the damages caused by the
accident exceed this amount (and
worst-case estimates of property
damage alone from a nuclear
meltdown accident start at $14 bill
ion), you would not be compensated
for the full amount of your losses.
And you wouldn't be covered by
your homeowner's insurance since
all policies explicitly exclude losses
from a nuclear accident.
Is this fair? Federal District judge
lames McMillan doesn'tthinkso. Ina
strongly-worded opinion delivered
last March 31 in Charlotte, North
Carolina, he ruled that the act viol
ates the Due Process and Equal Pro
tection provisions of the Fifth
Amendment and is therefore uncon
stitutional.
This momentous decision was, of
course, immediately appealed to the
Supreme Court, which is scheduled
to hear the case March 20.
Reasons for decision
ludge McMillan devoted a large
part of his 43-page decision to estab
lishing the fact that, but for the
Price-Anderson Act, the nuclear in

dustry might not exist. In the mid
50s, the power companies would not
buy and the nuclear industry would
not sell nuclear power plants without
some government insurance and
without a limit of their liability in case
of an accident. According to nuclear
industry representatives, the Price-
Anderson Act was necessary to in
duce the reluctant companies to go
nuclear."
The judge then reviewed the ques
tion of the likelihood of a nuclear
power plant accident (specifically the
odds given in the Rasmussen Report)
and declared that the question was
essentially irrelevant. "The court
finds as a fact that the probability of a
major nuclear accident producing
damages exceeding the $560,000,000
limit of the Price-Anderson Act is not
fanciful but real.
"It is the kind of risk against which
prudent business people guard, by
trying to design and build safely and
by reserves of insurance against pos
sible losses and liability to others.
"It is not the kind of risk which
responsible government or business
places upon bystanders.
"Plaintiffs have no source from
which they can get insurance against
loss or damage from atomic radia
tion; insurance companies, regard
less of the odds, won't write policies
to cover such losses."
Violates due process
The judge then decided that "The
Act violates the Due Process Clause
because it allows the destruction of
the property or lives of those af
fected by nuclear catastrophe with

out reasonable certainty that the vic
tims will be justly compensated."
He found that the act permitted an
amount of recovery not rationally re
lated to the potential losses, that
the act tends to encourage irres
ponsibility in matters of safety and
environmental protection rather
than to encourage responsibility on
the part of builders and owners. This
is contrary to the purpose of the
Atomic Energy Act."
The act violates the Equal Protec
tion provision of the Fifth Amend
ment because it provides for what
Congress deemed to be a benefit to
the whole society, but places the cost
of that benefit on an arbitrarily cho
sen segment of society, those in
jured by nuclear catastrophe. . . .
The statute irrationally places the risk
of major nuclear accident upon
people who happen to live in the
areas which may be touched by
radioactive debris," and "relieves
the owners of power plants of finan
cial responsibility for nuclear acci
dents."
Consider economics
If this decision is upheld by the
Supreme Court, it could drastically
affect the economic viability of nuc
learpower. The liability limitationsof
Price-Anderson have provided an
enormous subsidy to the industry by
removing the traditional responsibil
ity that all other industry must as
sume.
This would clearly be one of the
largest and most controversial gov
ernment subsidies ever given to pri
vate industry. The debate will un

doubtedly continue on the whole
question of how society should deal
with a technology of the potential
ferocity of nuclear power.

can not sue for more than $560 mill
ion. If the damages caused by the
accident exceed this amount (and
worst-case estimates of property
damage alone from a nuclear
meltdown accident start at $14 bill
ion), you would not be compensated
for the full amount of your losses.
And you wouldn't be covered by
your homeowner's insurance since
all policies explicitly exclude losses
from a nuclear accident.
Is this fair? Federal District judge
lames McMillan doesn'tthinkso. Ina
strongly-worded opinion delivered
last March 31 in Charlotte, North
Carolina, he ruled that the act viol
ates the Due Process and Equal Pro
tection provisions of the Fifth
Amendment and is therefore uncon
stitutional.
This momentous decision was, of
course, immediately appealed to the
Supreme Court, which is scheduled
to hear the case March 20.
Reasons for decision
ludge McMillan devoted a large
part of his 43-page decision to estab
lishing the fact that, but for the
Price-Anderson Act, the nuclear in

dustry might not exist. In the mid
50s, the power companies would not
buy and the nuclear industry would
not sell nuclear power plants without
some government insurance and
without a limit of their liability in case
of an accident. According to nuclear
industry representatives, the Price-
Anderson Act was necessary to in
duce the reluctant companies to go
nuclear."
The judge then reviewed the ques
tion of the likelihood of a nuclear
power plant accident (specifically the
odds given in the Rasmussen Report)
and declared that the question was
essentially irrelevant. "The court
finds as a fact that the probability of a
major nuclear accident producing
damages exceeding the $560,000,000
limit of the Price-Anderson Act is not
fanciful but real.
"It is the kind of risk against which
prudent business people guard, by
trying to design and build safely and
by reserves of insurance against pos
sible losses and liability to others.
"It is not the kind of risk which
responsible government or business
places upon bystanders.
"Plaintiffs have no source from
which they can get insurance against
loss or damage from atomic radia
tion; insurance companies, regard
less of the odds, won't write policies
to cover such losses."
Violates due process
The judge then decided that "The
Act violates the Due Process Clause
because it allows the destruction of
the property or lives of those af
fected by nuclear catastrophe with

out reasonable certainty that the vic
tims will be justly compensated."
He found that the act permitted an
amount of recovery not rationally re
lated to the potential losses, that
the act tends to encourage irres
ponsibility in matters of safety and
environmental protection rather
than to encourage responsibility on
the part of builders and owners. This
is contrary to the purpose of the
Atomic Energy Act."
The act violates the Equal Protec
tion provision of the Fifth Amend
ment because it provides for what
Congress deemed to be a benefit to
the whole society, but places the cost
of that benefit on an arbitrarily cho
sen segment of society, those in
jured by nuclear catastrophe. . . .
The statute irrationally places the risk
of major nuclear accident upon
people who happen to live in the
areas which may be touched by
radioactive debris," and "relieves
the owners of power plants of finan
cial responsibility for nuclear acci
dents."
Consider economics
If this decision is upheld by the
Supreme Court, it could drastically
affect the economic viability of nuc
learpower. The liability limitationsof
Price-Anderson have provided an
enormous subsidy to the industry by
removing the traditional responsibil
ity that all other industry must as
sume.
This would clearly be one of the
largest and most controversial gov
ernment subsidies ever given to pri
vate industry. The debate will un

doubtedly continue on the whole
question of how society should deal
with a technology of the potential
ferocity of nuclear power.

If an accident occurs at a nuclear
power plant and you are injured or
your property is damaged or con
taminated by radiation, it is possible
that you will be unable to recoup
your losses. The Price-Anderson Act,
passed by Congress in 1957, limits
the liability of a utility for a nuclear
accident to $560 million (of which the
federal government covers $435 mill
ion).
You and other damaged parties
can not sue for more than $560 mill
ion. If the damages caused by the
accident exceed this amount (and
worst-case estimates of property
damage alone from a nuclear
meltdown accident start at $14 bill
