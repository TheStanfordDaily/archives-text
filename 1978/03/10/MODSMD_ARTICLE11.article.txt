# Marketable commodity sought
## Beauty pageant winners 
### 
Diane Border

As a finalist in the 1976 Miss Teen
age America Pageant and holder of
other such dubious titles as Miss In
ternational, Miss California and Miss
Ventura, I feel I can speak from ex
perience about the vagaries of The
Beauty Pageant.
"Non-beauty" pageants (article,
Daily, March 7) which claim to look
for outstanding girls with poise, per
sonality and talent don't cut any ice
with me. What is really being sought,
especially at the national level, is a
marketable commodity — a girl mal
leable enough to "fit the mold."
Such girls are neither truly outstand
ing nor representative of excellence
in poise, personality or talent.
Those who claim that pageant
winners are not meant to be better

than anyone else (whether they wear
a crown or not) are simply deluding
themselves. "The Winner" is rep
resented as a very outstanding girl
chosen by wise and fair judges. It's a
nice fairy tale, but I know from per
sonal experience that it simply isn't
true.
I abhor both the abominable sub
jectivity with which pageants are
judged, and the veneer of sweet fe
mininity which belies subtle but per
vasive backstabbing. Only the
starry-eyed and the naive enter
pageants expecting a friendly world
of glamour and adulation. It's not
that way.
I didn't enterany of these pageants
on a whim, or because I wanted to
make friends, cure shyness, or take a
break from school. I'm a little too
mercenary and cynical for that! I got
out of the pageants what I wanted to
get out of them, i.e., scholarships,
performing experience, public
speaking experience, and a good bit
of training in "the ways of the
world."
Sound crass? Maybe. But certainly
no more so than pageant promoters
who use the "beauty queens" to sell
a product or attract a crowd.
Sure, it was an ego trip to perform
on national television with Mac Davis
and to play the piano live for an audi
ence of 12,000 and hear all those
people clap for me! I'd do it again
without thinking twice.
I fully realize that had I not entered
the pageants, I never could have re
ceived the benefits of such experi
ences. But this does not mitigate my
firm belief that pageants are not what
they seem to be.
They claim to aspire to excellence,
when in reality they cater to medioc

rity. Despite the rigmarole of inter
views, performances, and detailed
judging, when it comes right down to
it, the final selection of the winner is
little more than pure subjectivity. I
think most pageants would come
closer to reality if they dispensed
with the judging and simply picked a
name from a hat.

As a finalist in the 1976 Miss Teen
age America Pageant and holder of
other such dubious titles as Miss In
ternational, Miss California and Miss
Ventura, I feel I can speak from ex
perience about the vagaries of The
Beauty Pageant.
"Non-beauty" pageants (article,
Daily, March 7) which claim to look
for outstanding girls with poise, per
sonality and talent don't cut any ice
with me. What is really being sought,
especially at the national level, is a
marketable commodity — a girl mal
leable enough to "fit the mold."
Such girls are neither truly outstand
ing nor representative of excellence
in poise, personality or talent.
Those who claim that pageant
winners are not meant to be better

than anyone else (whether they wear
a crown or not) are simply deluding
themselves. "The Winner" is rep
resented as a very outstanding girl
chosen by wise and fair judges. It's a
nice fairy tale, but I know from per
sonal experience that it simply isn't
true.
I abhor both the abominable sub
jectivity with which pageants are
judged, and the veneer of sweet fe
mininity which belies subtle but per
vasive backstabbing. Only the
starry-eyed and the naive enter
pageants expecting a friendly world
of glamour and adulation. It's not
that way.
I didn't enterany of these pageants
on a whim, or because I wanted to
make friends, cure shyness, or take a
break from school. I'm a little too
mercenary and cynical for that! I got
out of the pageants what I wanted to
get out of them, i.e., scholarships,
performing experience, public
speaking experience, and a good bit
of training in "the ways of the
world."
Sound crass? Maybe. But certainly
no more so than pageant promoters
who use the "beauty queens" to sell
a product or attract a crowd.
Sure, it was an ego trip to perform
on national television with Mac Davis
and to play the piano live for an audi
ence of 12,000 and hear all those
people clap for me! I'd do it again
without thinking twice.
I fully realize that had I not entered
the pageants, I never could have re
ceived the benefits of such experi
ences. But this does not mitigate my
firm belief that pageants are not what
they seem to be.
They claim to aspire to excellence,
when in reality they cater to medioc

rity. Despite the rigmarole of inter
views, performances, and detailed
judging, when it comes right down to
it, the final selection of the winner is
little more than pure subjectivity. I
think most pageants would come
closer to reality if they dispensed
with the judging and simply picked a
name from a hat.
