Perpetuating misinformation
In "rationally explaining" anti-ERA
sentiment (Daily, March 6), john
Eberts perpetuates standard misin
formation about the legal implica
tions of the Equal Rights Amend
ment. Like the equal protection
clause already in the Fourteenth
Amendment of the U.S. Constitu
tion, nothing in the ERA says that
everyone must be treated the same
way.
The amendment simply says that
you can't treat people differently
only because of their sex. People can
still be treated differently based on
whether they are fully supported by a
working spouse, based on their de
monstrated strength or stamina on
physical fitness tests, based on their
actual responsibility to care for small
children, and so on.
It simply is not true that a married
worker's Social Security tax must
double to comply with the ERA;
compliance can be achieved far more
simply by allowing any non
employed spouse of a working con
tributor to collect Social Security on
the contributor's earnings.
In other words, protective laws
may still be valid as long as they pro
tect on the basis of an actual vulnera
bility, described in the law. They may
not rest on an assumption that all
members of one sex will be more
vulnerable than members of the
other sex.
As to the tax exempt status of re
ligious organizations, the U.S. Con
stitution's First Amendment forbids
government from favoring one relig
ion over another. Presumably or
ganizations could be taxed or not,
based on their religious affiliation.
Otherwise it seems clear that relig
ions which discriminate on the basis
of race, as some do, would already
have lost that tax exempt status.
