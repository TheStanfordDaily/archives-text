# Peruvian study to be possible
## 
### Kathy Andrews 
Two Stanford students will
have the opportunity to spend
next year studying at the Pon
tificia Universidad Catulica del
Peru in Lima, Peru through the
University's affiliation with an
overseas studies program.
The University joins some
members of the Southern
California Conference on In
ternational Studies (SOCCIS)
in cooperation with Indiana
University to support the prog
ram at La Catolica.
The participating California
schools include the California
State University and Colleges,
the University of California,
the Claremont Colleges and
use.
"It's a terrifically exciting
place," said Overseas Studies
Office director Mark Mancall.
Opportunities
Mancall particularly praised
the opportunities at La Catolica
to study archaeology, ethnic
history, economic develop
ment and literature.
"Including West Coast in
stitutions was a move to insure
the greater financial stability of
the program," Mancall stated.
The program is open to stu
dents who have attained junior
standing and at least two years
college level proficiency in
Spanish. Students will be
selected by a committee com
posed of members of the
Overseas Studies Office and
the departments of Spanish
and Portuguese and Latin
American Studies, according
to Mancall.
Tight selection
Since the University will be
sending only two of the 15

SOCCIS students, Assistant Di
rector of the Overseas Studies
Corb Smith expects that
"selection will be tight."
Preference will be given to
students who show a particular
interest in something to do
with Peru, such as the Incas,
Smith said.
While attending La Catulica,
students will live in residences
or apartments with Peruvians.
Arrangements to live with nuc
lear families may be made.
The Overseas Studies Office
estimates costs for the year at
La Catolica to total $8380, al
lowing $1000 for vacation travel
and personal expenses. The
comparable figure for studying
here next year is $7700 exclud
ing transportation or vacation
travel costs.
Students who are presently
eligible for financial aid will re
tain their eligibility, as particip
ants in the La Catolica program
will remain fully registered at
the University.
Interested students should
submit their applications by
April 7 to the Overseas Studies
Office.
