# Good, bad aspects revealed
## Solar power study issued 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — The sun
"is a clean, safe and environ
mentally benign source of
energy," but solar power is
clouded by questions of cost,
reliability and resistance from
consumers, builders and len
ders, a state report says.
In a 310-page preliminary re
port on solar energy, the
California Energy Commission
compiled a long list of advan
tages of solar energy and con
cluded that solar technology is
"mature" and reliable despite
numerous questions.
The report issued Wednes
day focused on the use of solar
energy as a supplemental
source of producing electric
ity, primarily to heat water and
run home and office heating
and cooling systems.
The commission asked a
long list of state officials to
comment on its findings be
fore the report is revised and
adopted in May as commission
policy.
The report repeated Gov.

Jerry Brown's goal "to install
solar water heating and space
conditioning systems in 20 per
cent of all residential and
commercial buildings in the
state by 1985, which corres
ponds to about 1.5 million
homes using solar."
That goal "could be met by
installing solar in half of the
new housing built each year as
well as retrofitting about 10 per
cent of the almost 8 million
existing homes in the state,"
the report said, estimating that
would save 100 billion cubic
feet of natural gas annually.
On the positive side, the re
port said solar energy is a re
newable energy source that is
safe and, after installation costs
are paid, promises protection
against inflation in energy
costs.
It said testimony in commis
sion hearings "reconfirmed
the fact that solar systems are
technically mature, particularly
solar water heating systems"
and that testimony "that the

solar industry is dominated by
ineffective entrepreneurs does
not appear to be valid."
But there are obstacles to
solar energy development
caused by attitudes of con
sumers and home builders due
to "high capital costs, un
proven reputation, lack of sun
rights and building code prob
lems, aesthetics, and uncer
tainty about service and re
pair."
