# Bakersfield voters oppose nuke plant plan

### 
Bakersfield (AP) â€” Some 70 per cent
of the voters here have opposed a plan
to build the nation's largest nuclear
plant in the midst of lush Central
California fields.
The final tally completed early Wed
nesday showed 47,282 Kern County
voters against the San Joaquin Nuclear
Project and 20,591 in favor.
Gov. Jerry Brown termed the non
binding advisory vote "a message to
those who spend millions of dollars on
nuclear power research."

Brown, an opponent of the proposed
5200-megawatt plant, said utilities
"should stop and take notice and look
at developing alternate sources of
energy. Such a large vote . . . indicates
the problems of atomic energy have to
be faced up to, such as waste disposal."
A key issue locally over the $4.5 bill
ion plant proposed by Los Angeles De
partment of Water and Power was the
large amounts of water needed to cool
reactors.

Opponents included conservative
farmers concerned that fresh water
might be diverted to the plant and lib
erals worried about disposal of nuclear
wastes.
"The message to the utility com
panies and the Legislature could not be
more clear. Start spending your money
to develop solar energy and other ac
ceptable energy alternatives," said
David Pesonen, chairman of the group
fighting the proposed plant near Wasco

northwest of here.
Another opponent said the county
board of supervisors will be asked
Tuesday to tell Los Angeles officials
they cannot build the plant here. The
supervisors had called the election to
give them guidance in making deci
sions involving the project.
Los Angeles officials had indicated
previously they would abandon the
Kern County site if local citizens
strongly opposed it.
