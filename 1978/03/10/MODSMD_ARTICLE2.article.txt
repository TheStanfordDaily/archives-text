# Trustees to discuss budget, new facilities
## 
### 
Consideration of a proposed $118.7 million
operating budget for next year and plans for a new
computer facility on campus will be "top items" of
discussion when the Board of Trustees meets at its
regular March meeting next week.
The board will also be asked to increase the
maximum loan possible under the Parent Loan
Program and to approve a facility plan for part of
the Stanford Synchrontron Radiation Laboratory
(SSRL) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
In addition, the first meeting of the trustee ad
hoc Subcommittee on Investment Responsibility
is scheduled.
The budget proposals, outlined for student
leaders and faculty last week, include a 9 per cent
expenditure hike. The budget guidelines indicate
$161,000 surplus and will allow for an average 7 per
cent salary increase for most faculty members.
Budget income
As in the past few years, tuition will account for
some 50 per cent of the budget income. In De
cember, the board approved a 9.3 per cent general
tuition rate hike to $5130 for next academic year.
The budget guidelines are scheduled for con
sideration at a joint meeting of the Finance and
Development Committee and the Academic Af
fairs Committee Monday afternoon in San Fran
cisco.
The board is expected to give final approval to

the proposed $3.64 million campus computer facil
ity. The facility, designed to consolidate opera
tions of the Stanford Center for Information Pro
cessing (SCIP) will be housed in the Jordan Quad
area.
If approved, construction is scheduled for com
pletion by July 1979. Included in the program is a
move of the Computer Science Department to
Margaret Jacks Hall and of the Communication
Department to Building 120 of the Quad.
Undergoing reconstruction
Jacks Hall is presently undergoing reconstruc
tion scheduled for completion in March 1979. Ac
cording to a Facilities Planning Project Schedule,
the reconstruction of Building 120 is just begin
ning, with planned schematic drawings just be
ginning. Construction on that project is tentatively
scheduled to begin during the third quarter of
1979.
The Committee on Investments will be asked to
approve a $1000 increase in the maximum loan
possible under the Parent Loan Program. The
program, designed to lend parents of students
here up to $6000 to help defer costs of tuition,
room and board is presently available only to
members of the class of 1981 and later classes.
The proposal would hike the maximum loan to
$7000 annually, but would not increase the
maximum allowed loan total over a student's four

years. The board has authorized up to $5 million in
loans through the first four years of the program.
About $460,000 was loaned this year, the prog
ram's first.
Expected approval
Also expected is approval of the $820,000 South
Arc Building Phase I of the SSRL project. The build
ing, to be funded with government money, should
be completed in September.
The first meeting of the ad hoc Subcommittee
on Investment Responsibility is scheduled for late
Monday afternoon. The committee, set up at the
last meeting to give the board a way to deal with
investment issues more effectively, will include
five members.
Trustee Alan Weeden, chairman of the Invest
ments Committee, will serve on the ad hoc panel
along with William Ayer and W.D. Eberle, also of
the Investments Committee. Trustees Otis Pease
and Susan Prager will also serve on the subcom
mittee though they are not committee members.
According to Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig, the meeting Monday will
probably discuss handling Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) recommendations.
Assistant to the President for Trustee Affairs
Robert Hamrdla said "I don't think there will be
any formal proposals (from the CI R) to consider."

approve a $1000 increase in the maximum loan
possible under the Parent Loan Program. The
program, designed to lend parents of students
here up to $6000 to help defer costs of tuition,
room and board is presently available only to
members of the class of 1981 and later classes.
The proposal would hike the maximum loan to
$7000 annually, but would not increase the
maximum allowed loan total over a student's four

years. The board has authorized up to $5 million in
loans through the first four years of the program.
About $460,000 was loaned this year, the prog
ram's first.
Expected approval
Also expected is approval of the $820,000 South
Arc Building Phase I of the SSRL project. The build
ing, to be funded with government money, should
be completed in September.
The first meeting of the ad hoc Subcommittee
on Investment Responsibility is scheduled for late
Monday afternoon. The committee, set up at the
last meeting to give the board a way to deal with
investment issues more effectively, will include
five members.
Trustee Alan Weeden, chairman of the Invest
ments Committee, will serve on the ad hoc panel
along with William Ayer and W.D. Eberle, also of
the Investments Committee. Trustees Otis Pease
and Susan Prager will also serve on the subcom
mittee though they are not committee members.
According to Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig, the meeting Monday will
probably discuss handling Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) recommendations.
Assistant to the President for Trustee Affairs
Robert Hamrdla said "I don't think there will be
any formal proposals (from the CI R) to consider."
Consideration of a proposed $118.7 million
operating budget for next year and plans for a new
computer facility on campus will be "top items" of
discussion when the Board of Trustees meets at its
regular March meeting next week.
The board will also be asked to increase the
maximum loan possible under the Parent Loan
Program and to approve a facility plan for part of
the Stanford Synchrontron Radiation Laboratory
(SSRL) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
In addition, the first meeting of the trustee ad
hoc Subcommittee on Investment Responsibility
is scheduled.
The budget proposals, outlined for student
leaders and faculty last week, include a 9 per cent
expenditure hike. The budget guidelines indicate
$161,000 surplus and will allow for an average 7 per
cent salary increase for most faculty members.
Budget income
As in the past few years, tuition will account for
some 50 per cent of the budget income. In De
cember, the board approved a 9.3 per cent general
tuition rate hike to $5130 for next academic year.
The budget guidelines are scheduled for con
sideration at a joint meeting of the Finance and
Development Committee and the Academic Af
fairs Committee Monday afternoon in San Fran
cisco.
The board is expected to give final approval to

the proposed $3.64 million campus computer facil
ity. The facility, designed to consolidate opera
tions of the Stanford Center for Information Pro
cessing (SCIP) will be housed in the Jordan Quad
area.
If approved, construction is scheduled for com
pletion by July 1979. Included in the program is a
move of the Computer Science Department to
Margaret Jacks Hall and of the Communication
Department to Building 120 of the Quad.
Undergoing reconstruction
Jacks Hall is presently undergoing reconstruc
tion scheduled for completion in March 1979. Ac
cording to a Facilities Planning Project Schedule,
the reconstruction of Building 120 is just begin
ning, with planned schematic drawings just be
ginning. Construction on that project is tentatively
scheduled to begin during the third quarter of
1979.
