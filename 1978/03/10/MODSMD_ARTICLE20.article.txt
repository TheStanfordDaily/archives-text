# Energetic Esslin teaches the art of the theater and enjoying life

Wearing a navy blue jacket, a
dark green turtleneck and
brown pants, Prof. Martin
Esslin, 60, the former head of
British Broadcasting Corpora
tion Radio drama department
stood with his legs apart lean
ing on a lectern.
He was lecturing on his favo
rite subject, theatre of the ab
surd, to his introductory drama
class. He talked slowly, with
out notes, in a distinctive ac
cent that resembles the British.
Whenever he came to an im
portant point, he paced the
stage gesticulating with his
hands to drive his point home.
According to Esslin,
"Trivialization of people's
minds has progressed tre
mendously" and he hopes that
his course "closes a few gaps"
in a student's education that

result from this process.
"The arts are not just a frill,
they are a school through
which you can learn the art of
enjoying your life," he said.
Esslin said he enjoys teach
ing. "After an enormous
amount of practical experience
one has something to impart,"
he said.
"I took the class because of
him," said freshman Anastasia
Wood. "His is the only class
that increases in enrollment
toward the end of the quarter,"
added Teresa Price, a secretary
in the drama department.
Later Esslin sat in his almost
bare office, in front of a desk
cluttered with papers and a pile
of books. Only a Royal Shakes
peare Company poster and
two photographs of him with
his friend Samuel Beckett, an
Irish playwright, adorned his

walls.
Esslin has spent 37 years with
the BBC radio, 16 of those as
director of the drama depart
ment. He is a leading critic of
contemporary drama and an
internationally known scholar.
Esslin has had a major influ
ence in introducing contem
porary European works into
the British repertoire. He is
best known for his two early
books, "Brecht: A Choice of
Evils," and"The Theatre of the
Absurd."
"He is a very important man
in British drama," said Prof.
Henry Breitrose, chairman of
the communication depart
ment here. "He is the 'Cosimo
di Medici' of the BBC."
"It was very satisfying for me
to be the person reading a
script of an unknown writer,
saying 'that's going to be

somebody,' inviting him to
lunch, and seeing him de
velop," commented Esslin,
Esslin considers himself a -
"central European" not be
cause he identifies with any
particular country, but be
cause he was an immigrant
twice in his life.
Born in Hungary, he first
immigrated when his father es
caped to Austria in 1919 be
cause his uncle was connected
with the communist revolution
there. The second time was
when Hitler occupied Austria.
Esslin grew up speaking
Hungarian at home, learned
German in school, French from
his aunt, English at a university
and taught himself Spanish,
Italian and even some Russian.
Esslin said he got his first job
at the BBC in 1940 because of
his knowledge of languages.
Esslin said he feels it is an

advantage to have a "personal
view," not tied to any national
ity.
"The great people are those
that can combine the best from
cultures. The more indepen
dent your standpoint, the bet
ter you are able to view the
world with detachment and
compassion," he continued.
How he became interested
in the theatre? "My father was a
journalist and had lots of
theatre tickets," he explained.
"For somebody who did not
want to go into an office job
and had literary ambitions,
theatre was the kind of profes
sion which gave you an income
of sorts and at the same time
gave you enough freedom not
to have to go in every morning
at 9.
"I have always tried to ride
two horses. I wanted to be an
academic and at the same time

I wanted to have a lifestyle of a
free 3nd easy Bohemian,"
Esslin said.
Even though he did end up in
an office job, Esslin has always
been his own master. "I have
never done anything that I
didn't really enjoy; I have
never looked on work as an
alienated activity. This is an
important factor in the forma
tion of one's personality," he
said.
"He has boundless energy,"
said Prof. Charles Lyons,
chairman of the drama de
partment. "He never turns
down anything that people ask
him to do," added Price.
When hearing these praises
he was surprised and shrug
ged. "In my own self image I
see myself as a lazy person. If I
am giving advice to a student, I
prefer that to sitting at home
watching the ceiling," he re
marked.
Will the theatre survive the
media revolution? "The mass
media has created an audience
for drama that has never
existed," said Esslin.
Although the mass media in
America are not "cultural in
stitutions but a branch of the
advertising industry," there
are signs that this is changing
with the creation of institutions
such as the National Endow
ment for the Arts and public
support of groups such as the
American Conservatory
Theatre in San Francisco, he
said.
"The mass media is a lonely
thing," said Esslin. "In America
today, more people want to get
out of their homes and do
things.
"You couldn't have the mass
media if you didn't have the
theatre; here you can instantly
test your product on the audi
ence. Theatre is the only train
ing ground for actors and writ
ers," he continued.
The role of the theatre as
Esslin sees it is to make people
aware of themselves. One of

the ways is to "make them an
gry," said Esslin.
"Art has to break the daily
routine. The problem with the
communist world is that it is
almost entirely routine and in
credibly dull. The intellectual
level is going down, the
slightest scrap from the west is
devoured," Esslin com
mented.
"The message of the theatre
is in essence just: Grow up, do
not look for help outside your
self.' One has to face the fait
that one is going to die and so
one might as well have a good
time," he added.
It appears that Esslin plans to
do just that. He spends six
months teaching at Stanford
and the rest of the year with his
wife and daughter in London
or in his house on the Sussex
coast where he likes to write.
Esslin is currently directing
the drama department's pro
duction of two French farces by
Georges Feydeau, "Don't Go
Walking Around Naked" and
"The Purging," which he calls
"amusing and not too difficult
to do."
