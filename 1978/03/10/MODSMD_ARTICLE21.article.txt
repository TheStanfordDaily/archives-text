# Chaparral 'Fun with Religion' issue reviewed
## 
### Rich Waldow 
Only an octopus — or possi
bly Bigfoot— can step on more
toes simultaneously than those
demented wags at the Chapar
ral. When they decide to run
amok through that hotbed of
humor, religion, you can bet
they'll manage to offend nearly
everyone. Slaughtering sacred
cows and deflating altar egos
can easily become crass — and
Hammer and Coffin has never
been famed for its subtlety.
Contrary to expectations,
the Chappie, resurrected
under Ray Thomas, has risen to
the occasion with style. The
current issue, titled, "Fun With
Religion," js not only one of
the largest and funniest in re
cent memory, but also one of
the classiest. It reveals a wel
come improvement in the

health of Stanford humor.
In the old days, pokingfun at
religion was a relatively simple
matter, consisting mainly of
shooting the papal bull or tar
nishing a few idols. But times
have changed, and the
magazine reflects this. The
Chaparral not only takes on the
more recent cults, such as Hare
Krishna and lesus Freaks, but
also uncovers heretofore sec
ret religions sweeping our very
campus. Here is where the
Chaparral scores its biggest
boffos as well as its most glar
ing failures.
Positive side
On the positive side are sev
eral outstanding short stories.
"The Gordies," by Ray
Thomas, is the answer to every
Modern Europe student's
dreams: an hysterical expose

of the slavish cult of disciples
surrounding the legendary
Prof. Gordon Craig. Many his
tory majors have long known
about the Metternichean
schemes of the "Muttonchop
pers" (as they like to call them
selves), but until now no one
has had the courage to come
forth and tell the shocking
story. Thomas does so with an
eloquence worthy of the Mas
ter himself.
John Barth's "Separate Tales
of Banality" takes a well
deserved truncheon to Cas
taneda's insipid fungus junkie,
Don )uan. The dialogue shows
a deft, understated touch. Both
articles feature graphics worth
the price of admission, espe
cially Perry Vasquez' take-offs
on the ethereal Castaneda
covers.
The new issue points up two
ways in which the Chaparral
has been steadily improving:
graphics and writing quality.
Hilarious
Bruce Handy's cartoons
mark him a first-rate talent in a
field crowded with mediocrity.
They are drawn with style and
insight, but, most important,
are funny.
Especially hilarious is "Kam
pus Krusade for Krist," a sca
thing, original spoof on
evangelism. Derek Muller's il
lustrations for "What Hath
Thought Rot?" are similarly in
genious and polished. Overall,
the magazine's layout and
graphics show a slick profes
sionalism that comes from
careful work. This has not al
ways been the case.
For a long time, Chaparral
had been giving humor a bad
name. It has been plagued by
slipshod writing, obvious
crude jokes and stale subjects.
This made it a big hit with Mel
Brooks fans, but severely li
mited the number of readers
past potty-training.
Quality
With this in mind, it's really a
pleasure to see the level of
quality and care rising. This
change is most notable in
pieces such as Rob Holbrook's
"What Hath Thought Rot?", a
twisted look at cosmology. It's

an intelligent, breakneck
paced word barrage reminis
cent of S.J. Perelman or good
Roy Skogstrom. The puns prac
tically groan right off the
printed page. This type of writ
ing is hard to do well, and
proves that you don't need
electro-shock treatment to be
madcap and zany.
Still, as Richter would say,
this issue is not without faults.
There is one hell of a lot of
religious-type groups practi
cally praying to be ridiculed.
Many of them get off the hook
easy. In some cases, this is due
largely to lax editing.
Leslie Mintz' "I Found It (In
the CRC)," a send-up of
Chem-Bio lab lemmings, could
have been very funny. Instead,
its good lines and ideas are
buried in marathon length.
Smothered
Likewise smothered is Andy
Lundberg's "Short History of
Western Religion," which,

with some tightening, might
have rivaled Holbrook's piece
in sophistication.
Things go from bad to verse
with Mike Reedy's poetic tri
butes to Larry Flynt and Job,
and Tom Schiff's weak parody
of Woody Allen. These last ar
ticles were good ideas, but
were unfortunately allowed to
ramble and lose their bite.
Even with these problems,
"Fun With Religion" signals
the end of a long dark chapter
in the history of Stanford
humor. Hammer and Coffin's
antics in the ASSU Senate had
left the vital position of Cam
pus Clown to the Administra
tion.
True, they've treated us to a
few guffaws — maybe even a
chortle or two — but being
guardian of Stanford's funny
bone is no laughing matter. It's
a heavy responsibility. With
"Religion," Chaparral makes
that cross a little easier to bear.
