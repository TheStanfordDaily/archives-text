Will anybody tell you about the four foot high
concrete building that's 200 yards from the radar
dish on the opposite side of the hill? Do we have
our very own missile silo at Stanford?
-DT
Throughout the years, there have been many
rumors concerning missiles in the foothills.
The structure you found however, is not a
missile silo. "It isn't even a building," said Henry
Howard, adjunct professor of Electrical En
gineering.
Howard said the 2 foot by 2 foot structure is a
foundation with a concrete pier. Years ago, it
had antennae calibration equipment mounted
on it. That equipment has since been removed,
and the structure now serves no useful purpose.

At the Kingscote Gardens entrance on Lomita,
the sign says, "Tenant Parking Only - Unau
thorized Vehicles Will Be Towed Away at Own
er's Expense. PAPD"; and then gives a phone
number. I assume PAPD mear\s Palo Alto Police
Department.
Does this mean the PAPD tows cars on campus
now? Or does Kingscote Gardens have illegally
parked cars towed to the PAPD compound? Or is
this a lot of bark and no bite?
By the way, where do other cars on campus get
towed?
-CD
The telephone number given on the sign is
indeed the number for the Palo Alto Police De
partment. However, Vicki Bierman at the PAPD
said that the Palo Alto police have no jursidiction
within the University.
Assuming the Palo Alto police would not tow
the car, I called Capt. Walter Konar of the Stan
ford police. He said there is a problem with the
jurisdiction, because Kingscote Gardens is like
"an island within an island." In any case, he said,

cars which are abandoned or parked illegally are
not towed by the police department, but rather
by private towing companies. For example, if
the police were to find an abandoned vehicle,
they would cal I a private tow truck to come tow it
away. The owner of the vehicle would then be
liable for the towing expenses. So, when cars on
campus are towed, they are taken to private lots,
not to police compounds. The police depart
ment keeps a rotating list of the towing com
panies, so each one gets a "piece of the action."
So why list PAPD? Konar said he "can't com
ment on the legality, but that was incorrect to
have the Palo Alto Police listed."
Wondering about the legality, I called Doug
Southard, Deputy District Attorney for Santa
Clara County. He said the owner does have a
right to put up a NO PARKING sign, and to have
vehicles towed away at the owner's (of the vehi
cle) expense. As far as he knew, he said, they
were violating no law by listing the PAPD, even if
the PAPD does not have jurisdiction. "The own
ers have the right to tow a car away — which
police agency they list is irrelevant," he said.
To find out why the PAPD was listed, I next
called Bob Duncan, at Hare, Brewer and Kelly,
the company that manages the property. Upon
being asked about the sign, Duncan said: "I
don't care what it says — I don't care if it's
misleading — I don't care if it says LAPD (Los
Angeles Police Department) — if a car is parked
there illegally, I will chain it up and tow it away!"
So evidently, the sign is not "all bark and no
bite." You will be bitten if you park there illeg
ally, however the biting will not be done by the
PAPD.

ford police. He said there is a problem with the
jurisdiction, because Kingscote Gardens is like
"an island within an island." In any case, he said,

cars which are abandoned or parked illegally are
not towed by the police department, but rather
by private towing companies. For example, if
the police were to find an abandoned vehicle,
they would cal I a private tow truck to come tow it
away. The owner of the vehicle would then be
liable for the towing expenses. So, when cars on
campus are towed, they are taken to private lots,
not to police compounds. The police depart
ment keeps a rotating list of the towing com
panies, so each one gets a "piece of the action."
So why list PAPD? Konar said he "can't com
ment on the legality, but that was incorrect to
have the Palo Alto Police listed."
Wondering about the legality, I called Doug
Southard, Deputy District Attorney for Santa
Clara County. He said the owner does have a
right to put up a NO PARKING sign, and to have
vehicles towed away at the owner's (of the vehi
cle) expense. As far as he knew, he said, they
were violating no law by listing the PAPD, even if
the PAPD does not have jurisdiction. "The own
ers have the right to tow a car away — which
police agency they list is irrelevant," he said.
To find out why the PAPD was listed, I next
called Bob Duncan, at Hare, Brewer and Kelly,
the company that manages the property. Upon
being asked about the sign, Duncan said: "I
don't care what it says — I don't care if it's
misleading — I don't care if it says LAPD (Los
Angeles Police Department) — if a car is parked
there illegally, I will chain it up and tow it away!"
So evidently, the sign is not "all bark and no
bite." You will be bitten if you park there illeg
ally, however the biting will not be done by the
PAPD.

Will anybody tell you about the four foot high
concrete building that's 200 yards from the radar
dish on the opposite side of the hill? Do we have
our very own missile silo at Stanford?

Throughout the years, there have been many
rumors concerning missiles in the foothills.
The structure you found however, is not a
missile silo. "It isn't even a building," said Henry
Howard, adjunct professor of Electrical En
gineering.
Howard said the 2 foot by 2 foot structure is a
foundation with a concrete pier. Years ago, it
had antennae calibration equipment mounted
on it. That equipment has since been removed,
and the structure now serves no useful purpose.

At the Kingscote Gardens entrance on Lomita,
the sign says, "Tenant Parking Only - Unau
thorized Vehicles Will Be Towed Away at Own
er's Expense. PAPD"; and then gives a phone
number. I assume PAPD mear\s Palo Alto Police
Department.
Does this mean the PAPD tows cars on campus
now? Or does Kingscote Gardens have illegally
parked cars towed to the PAPD compound? Or is
this a lot of bark and no bite?
By the way, where do other cars on campus get
towed?
-CD
The telephone number given on the sign is
indeed the number for the Palo Alto Police De
partment. However, Vicki Bierman at the PAPD
said that the Palo Alto police have no jursidiction
within the University.
Assuming the Palo Alto police would not tow
the car, I called Capt. Walter Konar of the Stan
ford police. He said there is a problem with the
