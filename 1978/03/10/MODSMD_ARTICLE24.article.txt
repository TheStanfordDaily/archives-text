# Two property tax measures set for ballot
## 
### Rub Lempert 
California property taxes per capita
are currently third highest in the na
tion. Two initiatives designed to drasti
cally slash the taxes could be the hottest
issue in June's primary election.
Proposition 13, the Jarvis-Cann initia
tive, proposes to limit property taxes to
1 per cent of the full cash value of the
property and require a two-thirds vote
of the legislature or electorate to in
crease any state tax.
Proposition 8, or the Behr bill, was
placed on the ballot by the state legisla
ture last Friday and proposes to reduce
property taxes by 30 per cent.
California tax rate is about 3 per cent
presently, so the Jarvis-Cann initiative
would cut state revenues more than $6
billion, according to a report filed by
the Assembly Revenue and Taxation
Committee. Opponents of the measure
claim it will cripple state and local gov
ernments.
Larry Moore, director of business
and services for Palo Alto said that city
alone would lose $3.5 million to $4.7
million in funds if the present distribu
tion of funds holds.

Proposition 13 specifies the board of
supervisors of each county would ap
portion the new 1 per cent tax revenue
to the cities under their jurisdiction. If
Santa Clara County changes the dis
tribution of funds, there is no telling
how much Palo Alto could lose, Moore
said.
It is uncertain, just which govern
ment services would be reduced by the
Jarvis-Cann initiative. Education Prof.
Michael Kirst, said he predicts that "ev
erything; police, fire, recreation, will
be cut."
Effect on schools
Schools might also be hit hard. Stan
ford, a private institution, should suffer
no loss of funds under Jarvis-Cann, said
Larry Horton, governmental relations
deputy director. However, State
Superintendent of Public Instruction
Wilson Riles estimates public schools
will suffer an average statewide reduc
tion of 37 per cent revenues next year.
Kirst said the state colleges, such as
San Jose State, and universities such as
UC-Berkeley do not rely on property
taxes, so they will not be affected by
Jarvis-Cann. He added that community

colleges, which do use these funds, will
be "devastated."
Riles said the initiative would "de
stroy education in California as we
know it." Kirst added he "doesn't see
how schools could cut their budgets
enough."
The two men who launched Proposi
tion 13, Howard Jarvis, head of the
Apartment House Association of Los
Angeles, and Paul Gann, a retired real
estate salesman, argue these drastic
cuts will not be necessary.
Both say there is a large state budget
surplus that can be tapped. The gov
ernment can cut off the fat, the two
men add.
Surplus in doubt
Another problem in the controversy
is that the exact extent of the state
surplus is much in doubt. A spokesman
for Assemblyman Dixon Arnett (R-Palo
Alto), assembly minority whip, said the
legislature is using the figure of $2.6
billion, although it may be higher.
Proposition 8 is the legislature's al
ternative to the Jarvis-Gann initiative. It
provides what Gov. Jerry Brown calls

"honest property tax relief," designed
to undermine the Proposition 13 sup
port.
The two propositions are mutually
contradictory in many areas and if both
pass, the one with most votes will be
come law, said Law Prof. Robert Girard.
He added though he is personally op
posed to the )arvis-Gann initiative, he
sees nothing in it that is likely to be
unconstitutional. The California Sup
reme Court has already overruled two
attempts to declare the proposition in
valid.
Poll results
The latest polls show 20 per cent of
California voters favoring the Jarvis-
Gann proposition while nearly half of
them know nothing about it. Kirst said
he tends to be skeptical that it will pass,
although he added, "it is very early to
say what's going to happen."
Proposition 13 is the fourth attempt
in 10 years to impose by initiative a con
stitutional limit on property taxes, ac
cording to the assembly report. All pre
vious attempts have failed by large
margins.

Apartment House Association of Los
Angeles, and Paul Gann, a retired real
estate salesman, argue these drastic
cuts will not be necessary.
Both say there is a large state budget
surplus that can be tapped. The gov
ernment can cut off the fat, the two
men add.
Surplus in doubt
Another problem in the controversy
is that the exact extent of the state
surplus is much in doubt. A spokesman
for Assemblyman Dixon Arnett (R-Palo
Alto), assembly minority whip, said the
legislature is using the figure of $2.6
billion, although it may be higher.
Proposition 8 is the legislature's al
ternative to the Jarvis-Gann initiative. It
provides what Gov. Jerry Brown calls

"honest property tax relief," designed
to undermine the Proposition 13 sup
port.
The two propositions are mutually
contradictory in many areas and if both
pass, the one with most votes will be
come law, said Law Prof. Robert Girard.
He added though he is personally op
posed to the )arvis-Gann initiative, he
sees nothing in it that is likely to be
unconstitutional. The California Sup
reme Court has already overruled two
attempts to declare the proposition in
valid.
Poll results
The latest polls show 20 per cent of
California voters favoring the Jarvis-
Gann proposition while nearly half of
them know nothing about it. Kirst said
he tends to be skeptical that it will pass,
although he added, "it is very early to
say what's going to happen."
Proposition 13 is the fourth attempt
in 10 years to impose by initiative a con
stitutional limit on property taxes, ac
cording to the assembly report. All pre
vious attempts have failed by large
margins.
California property taxes per capita
are currently third highest in the na
tion. Two initiatives designed to drasti
cally slash the taxes could be the hottest
issue in June's primary election.
Proposition 13, the Jarvis-Cann initia
tive, proposes to limit property taxes to
1 per cent of the full cash value of the
property and require a two-thirds vote
of the legislature or electorate to in
crease any state tax.
Proposition 8, or the Behr bill, was
placed on the ballot by the state legisla
ture last Friday and proposes to reduce
property taxes by 30 per cent.
California tax rate is about 3 per cent
presently, so the Jarvis-Cann initiative
would cut state revenues more than $6
billion, according to a report filed by
the Assembly Revenue and Taxation
Committee. Opponents of the measure
claim it will cripple state and local gov
ernments.
Larry Moore, director of business
and services for Palo Alto said that city
alone would lose $3.5 million to $4.7
million in funds if the present distribu
tion of funds holds.

Proposition 13 specifies the board of
supervisors of each county would ap
portion the new 1 per cent tax revenue
to the cities under their jurisdiction. If
Santa Clara County changes the dis
tribution of funds, there is no telling
how much Palo Alto could lose, Moore
said.
It is uncertain, just which govern
ment services would be reduced by the
Jarvis-Cann initiative. Education Prof.
Michael Kirst, said he predicts that "ev
erything; police, fire, recreation, will
be cut."
Effect on schools
Schools might also be hit hard. Stan
ford, a private institution, should suffer
no loss of funds under Jarvis-Cann, said
Larry Horton, governmental relations
deputy director. However, State
Superintendent of Public Instruction
Wilson Riles estimates public schools
will suffer an average statewide reduc
tion of 37 per cent revenues next year.
Kirst said the state colleges, such as
San Jose State, and universities such as
UC-Berkeley do not rely on property
taxes, so they will not be affected by
Jarvis-Cann. He added that community

colleges, which do use these funds, will
be "devastated."
Riles said the initiative would "de
stroy education in California as we
know it." Kirst added he "doesn't see
how schools could cut their budgets
enough."
The two men who launched Proposi
tion 13, Howard Jarvis, head of the
Apartment House Association of Los
Angeles, and Paul Gann, a retired real
estate salesman, argue these drastic
cuts will not be necessary.
