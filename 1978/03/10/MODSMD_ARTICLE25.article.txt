# Panelists discuss Black Liberation

"What is black liberation and
where do we go from here?"
This was the central question
before the Black Liberation
Month symposium March 3
and 4, which called for re
sponses by three prominent fi
gures in today's black struggle.
The major event of Black
Liberation Month, the program
included Cornell Africana Re
search Center head James
Turner, writer James Boggs and
All African People's Revolutio
nary Party organizer Ed Boston.
Turner, who earned his doc
torate at Northwestern, em
phasized nationalism, a con
cept he said blacks should give
serious consideration. He said
race rather than class is the
most critical factor in the black
struggle, and said blacks must
have clear concepts of self and
group to understand their
struggle.
He said blacks today have in
ternalized the ideas of the
white majority and now view
those ideas as their own.
A major problem to be dealt
with, Turner said, is the con
cept of "Negrotism." He said
blacks cannot have a truly posi
tive self-image while at the
same time pledging national al
legiance to the United States.
Boggs, an auto worker
known for his political work in
the auto industry and author of
The American Revolution and
other writings on racism and
class struggle, focused atten
tion on what important con
cepts he considers black lead

ers have tended to overlook in
developing ideologies and
strategies.
"I did not come here to com
fort you or make you happy,"
he said, "because these are not
happy times." He pointed out
that blacks must see the need
for extensive study of their
own history in the United
States, saying that "if there is
no idea of the past there is no
vision for the future."
He illustrated his point by
saying that blacks who use
Marxist critiques of capitalism
as bases for their ideologies
neglect the fact that Marx was
commenting on a very primi
tive state of capitalism.
When persons talk about
"crushing the capitalist sys
tem" using simple methods
developed from Marx they fail
to recognize capitalism's cur
rent advanced state.
Boggs attributed what he cal
led the utter chaos of the black
struggle today to blacks turn
ing away from the human ques
tion of whether any group has
the right to oppress another to
more immediate, specific is
sues such as segregation, edu
cation and housing.
Once whites made conces
sions on the more concrete is
sues, the black movement
began to fragment, with
groups forming in many sepa
rate directions, he said.
NAACP Board Chairperson
Margaret Bush Wilson will
speak Monday night at 7:30 in
Meyer Forum Room in the next
Black Liberation Month event.

that blacks must see the need
for extensive study of their
own history in the United
States, saying that "if there is
no idea of the past there is no
vision for the future."
He illustrated his point by
saying that blacks who use
Marxist critiques of capitalism
as bases for their ideologies
neglect the fact that Marx was
commenting on a very primi
tive state of capitalism.
When persons talk about
"crushing the capitalist sys
tem" using simple methods
developed from Marx they fail
to recognize capitalism's cur
rent advanced state.
Boggs attributed what he cal
led the utter chaos of the black
struggle today to blacks turn
ing away from the human ques
tion of whether any group has
the right to oppress another to
more immediate, specific is
sues such as segregation, edu
cation and housing.
Once whites made conces
sions on the more concrete is
sues, the black movement
began to fragment, with
groups forming in many sepa
rate directions, he said.
