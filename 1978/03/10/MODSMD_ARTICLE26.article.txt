# Prof. Thomas Bailey -'a walking encyclopedia' of history
## 
### Lane Webster 
Every weekday morning, Hi
story Emeritus Prof. Thomas
Bailey scoots himself into his
desk like a plug pushing into its
socket.
His books sizzle with wit and
insight, and his five editions of
"The American Pageant" and
his nine editions of "A Dip
lomatic History of the Ameri
can People" have electrified
countless classrooms across
the nation in the last two de
cades.
At 75, in his tenth year of so
called "retirement," Bailey has
yet to switch off his output, and
he averages one book or revi
sion a year. He recently inked
out "The Marshall Plan Sum
mer," a chronicle of his stint as
an observer in Europe and as a
civilian member of the Euro
pean National War College in
1947.
Walking encyclopedia
Associate History Prof.
David Kennedy, who is co
authoring the sixth edition of
"The American Pageant," de
scribed Bailey as "a walking
encyclopedia" of history who
never makes a "factual error."
"I'm on a revisionist tread
mill," Bailey lamented. When
one new edition of a book goes
out, another comes in needing
a facelift. "If they'd only die a
respectable death I wouldn't
be bothered by them," he said.
But the pencils strewn over
his desktop, ready to record
any fit of acumen, betray his
yearn for writing. "I expect to
die in the harness," he confes
sed.
In suede sneakers that some
times clash with his suits,

Bailey walks every morning
from his home on Santa Teresa
St. to his book-laden cubicle in
the history department's
sandstone bastion of scholar
ship.
Masoned into one corner of
the building's ground floor,
Bailey's office symbolizes his
forming a chunk of the founda
tion, if not the cornerstone, of
the department's lauded herit
age.
Bailey first strolled on cam
pus as a freshman in 1920, the
year Stanford began charging
tuition. It was $60. He com
muted by electric car from his
family's prune orchard in San
Jose.
Grade hound
Though he never eschewed
prunes, he found books more
fun to nibble on and became a
"bit of a grade hound." He was
astonished at the beer guzzl
ing, "anti-education" frater
nity herds that were "com
pletely uninterested in na
tional affairs."
"I have an aphorism I
coined," he said. "Education is
the only thing I know of that
people will pay a lot of money
for and make every effort not
to receive."
But even Bailey took time out
to enjoy events such as the
bonfire, which in those days
consisted of burning a modest
pile of palm branches.
Ladder
He climbed the graduate
student ladder, earning a doc
torate in history from Stanford
in 1927. He became an assistant
professor, first at the Univer
sity of Hawaii and then at Stan

ford. He plunged briefly into
journalism between the two
posts.
Bailey stepped up to as
sociate professor in 1935 and
weighed in as a full professor in
1940, spending a few terms lec
turing at Harvard, Cornell and
Johns Hopkins. In 1952, he was
appointed Margaret Byrne Pro
fessor of History.
Bailey headed the history
department from 1952-55 and
from 1957-59, capping his term
by hiring President Richard
Lyman as associate professor
of history in 1959.
At the lectern,. Bailey was a
magnet. "I adopted the policy
to keep every student awake,"
he jests. "A student awake
learns more than a student
who is asleep," he explained.
"You keep people awake by
saying things that are interest
ing."
Barbs
Lyman remembers one of
Bailey's barbs. Addressing a
Memorial Auditorium audi
ence, he shook up former
Prime Minister of England,
Clement Attlee, by introducing
him as the man who had
"negotiated moustache to
moustache with loseph Sta
lin."
But amid the ruckus of the
sixties, Bailey's humor dim
med. "I liked teaching up to a
point," he said, "but the stu
dents got hostile." He said he
"sympathized with many of
their political gripes; but
wearied by student antics, he
retired in 1968 to practice some
of his own — on paper.
Bailey jumped back into his
favorite role as a scholarly

Puck. He stuck with the two
trusty thrusts that have carried
his career; first, establishing
the study of public opinion's
power to shape government
policy in America and second,
pioneering whimsical histori
cal prose.
It worked," he said, refer
ring to the crateful of his
bestseller, The American
Pageant," that has been sold.
Raw history
Raw history is important to
Bailey. History is what hap
pened," he said. "When you
write it you write of the sig
nificant things that happened,
and the significance of the sig
nificant things that hap
pened."
But taking history seriously
need not smother all the fun it
offers. "You might as well
laugh as cry about most of
these things," he says. "Oneof
the greatest punsters of all time
was Shakespeare — an author
of some stature," Bailey said.
Gently, he ridiculed the
teac hers who once shivered at
the thought of using a textbook
they termed, "Bailey's
jokebook."
"We read it for enjoyment,"
said Dave Stuer, a junior major
ing in history, whose high
school gang was entranced by
the book. Bailey's style is "to
tally witty," he said.
Marvelous pen
He has a marvelous pen,"
agreed history Professor Lewis
Spitz. He's not frivolous. Each
one of his witticisms makes a
point. Sometimes he's a little
flip, not always being sensitive
to minority points of view,"
Spitz said. But he's respond

ing to that."
Bailey pulled out a binder
packed with phrases culled
from his reading and cradled it
in his hand like a jeweler in
specting his gem collection.
Eyes sparkling, he delivered
a takeoff on one of Sen. Barry
Coldwater's old campaign slo
gans: "In your heart you know
he's right; in your guts you
know he's nuts."
Wash the flag
"Ah dear," he sighed,
cherishing the history he is so
familiar with. In a gruffer tone
he read, "Don't burn the flag,
wash it," brushing back a flap
of his brown pin-stripe suit, to
reveal one "patriotic" red,
white and blue suspender.
The key to readable writing,
he asserted, is to keep your
readers "off-balance" with a
snappy anecdote, a turn of
phrase or a spicy alliteration.
"Anything that clarifies is
good," he says. "Anything that
adds confusion is bad." Bailey

will even mobilize a cliche if it
says something better than a
string of awkward words.
"Students come across a cliche
on a dull page and it seems like
an old friend," he said.
Writing
"I like to write," said Bailey,
summing up his life's impetus
in a sentence. "I get a feeling of
satisfaction from doing a book
that I feel is pretty good," he
said, eyes darting from book
shelf to bookshelf.
Bailey still tunes into the his
tory going on around him.
After a day's reading and writ
ing at the office, he goes home
to read through newspapers,
watch television documen
taries and listen to the radio.
Radio talk shows supply him
with lots of laughs. He shud
ders at both the disc jockeys
and the wacky people they put
up with. Together, he said,
they "add nothing to the sum
total of human knowledge."
That is something Tom Bailev

could never be accused of.
"I keep reminding myself
that there are a lot of ignorant
people out there, and very
opinionated ones," he said.
"The human comedy is very in
teresting."
Bailey scoffs at traveling, al
though Sylvia, his wife of 49
years, keeps urging him to take
more trips.
"To me, travel is a bore," he
said. "After I've seen 20
cathedrals, I've seen them all."
It is research that charms
him. "There's so much history
begging to be put on the right
track," he said, his right hand
twitching as if ready to get back
to the typewriter keys.
But there is no need for
Bailey to sweat that unculti
vated terrain. Already, he has
mastered the field he chose.
And surely he is entitled
once in a while to break his gal
lop and gaze back over his
shoulder at the path his scho
larship bushwhacked.

History Emeritus Prof. Thomas Bailey sits at his desk in his book-laden ally writing new editions to his books that have sizzled with wit and
Cubicle. He claims he is on a "revisionist treadmill" as he is continu- insight.
