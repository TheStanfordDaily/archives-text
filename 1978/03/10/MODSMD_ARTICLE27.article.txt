# Breast cancer may afflict over 90,000 U.S. women
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Despite medical ad
vances, more than 90,000 American women will
learn they have breast cancer this year and ex
perts fear the deaths will climb.
"This is partly because we live in a sea of
carcinogens," said Dr. Arthur Holleb, senior
vice president of the American Cancer Society,
who attended a breast cancer conference spon
sored here by the American College of Radiol
ogy. The four-day meeting ended yesterday.
Holleb said one out of every 14 women born
in the United States this year will be a victim of
the disease. And studies show the mortality rate
hasn't changed in the last 40 years, despite ad
vances in diagnosis.
Controversy
If the statistical outlook is bleak, no less dis
concerting is the cloud of controversy that
shrouds the field.
Trained medical professionals disagree about
treatment and technique, about probably
causes and possible cures. Each side charges the
other lacks statistical evidence to back their pos
ition.
In conference panel discussions, doctors all
agreed on the importance of regular self
examination which they say leads to early dis
covery of lumps or other symptoms.
Mammogram
Of particular interest here was the controver
sial mammogram — the X-ray breast examina
tion which became a medical hot potato after
recent attacks.
Critics, including Dr. John Bailar of the Na
tional Cancer Institute, charge that the doses of
radiation in the test pose a significant threat of

causing cancer. Bailar said in a telephone inter
view there is no statistical proof that screening is
of any benefit for women under 50.
In a speech prepared for delivery Wednesday,
Holleb answered the charges, saying the radia
tion doses have been greatly reduced in the
recent years. He admitted all the statistical evi
dence isn't yet in, but he said the known be
nefits outweigh what he said were unproved
risks.
Risks involved
"The presumptive risks, if they do exist,
should not nullify the life-saving potential of low
dose mammography," he said in the speech.
"One must also ask — what is the risk of not
using mammography when it offers the first real
possibility of reducing the death rate of breast
cancer?"
Dr. Philip Strax, who was part of the first clini
cal trial of mammography in the famed Health
Insurance Plan study of the 19605, said the
mammogram is important because it can detect
cancers too small to be felt. The charges have
aroused "hysteria" and scared women away
from examinations, he said.
Responsibility
Conference participant Rose Kushner, who
wrote the book "Why Me?" after finding she
had breast cancer, said women must take on
more responsibility for their medical well
being.
"In terms of breast cancer, women are not
aware of the options available and they're too
timid to fight the doctors," she said. "It's terribly
traumatic, it's unnecessary and it's dangerous."

aware of the options available and they're too
timid to fight the doctors," she said. "It's terribly
traumatic, it's unnecessary and it's dangerous."
San Francisco (AP) — Despite medical ad
vances, more than 90,000 American women will
learn they have breast cancer this year and ex
perts fear the deaths will climb.
"This is partly because we live in a sea of
carcinogens," said Dr. Arthur Holleb, senior
vice president of the American Cancer Society,
who attended a breast cancer conference spon
sored here by the American College of Radiol
ogy. The four-day meeting ended yesterday.
Holleb said one out of every 14 women born
in the United States this year will be a victim of
the disease. And studies show the mortality rate
hasn't changed in the last 40 years, despite ad
vances in diagnosis.
Controversy
If the statistical outlook is bleak, no less dis
concerting is the cloud of controversy that
shrouds the field.
Trained medical professionals disagree about
treatment and technique, about probably
causes and possible cures. Each side charges the
other lacks statistical evidence to back their pos
ition.
In conference panel discussions, doctors all
agreed on the importance of regular self
examination which they say leads to early dis
covery of lumps or other symptoms.
Mammogram
Of particular interest here was the controver
sial mammogram — the X-ray breast examina
tion which became a medical hot potato after
recent attacks.
Critics, including Dr. John Bailar of the Na
tional Cancer Institute, charge that the doses of
radiation in the test pose a significant threat of

causing cancer. Bailar said in a telephone inter
view there is no statistical proof that screening is
of any benefit for women under 50.
In a speech prepared for delivery Wednesday,
Holleb answered the charges, saying the radia
tion doses have been greatly reduced in the
recent years. He admitted all the statistical evi
dence isn't yet in, but he said the known be
nefits outweigh what he said were unproved
risks.
Risks involved
"The presumptive risks, if they do exist,
should not nullify the life-saving potential of low
dose mammography," he said in the speech.
"One must also ask — what is the risk of not
using mammography when it offers the first real
possibility of reducing the death rate of breast
cancer?"
Dr. Philip Strax, who was part of the first clini
cal trial of mammography in the famed Health
Insurance Plan study of the 19605, said the
mammogram is important because it can detect
cancers too small to be felt. The charges have
aroused "hysteria" and scared women away
from examinations, he said.
Responsibility
Conference participant Rose Kushner, who
wrote the book "Why Me?" after finding she
had breast cancer, said women must take on
more responsibility for their medical well
being.
"In terms of breast cancer, women are not
aware of the options available and they're too
timid to fight the doctors," she said. "It's terribly
traumatic, it's unnecessary and it's dangerous."
