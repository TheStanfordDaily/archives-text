Tomfoolery's
2300 E. Bayshore
Palo Alto, CA.
Despite the lack of lusty
barmaids, Tomfoolery's comes
as close to a sensual Tom
)ones-style dinner as one is
likely to find in the rolling hills
of Palo Alto-shire. From the
wooden rafters filled with
Handel's Water-Music, to the
earthenware pottery and the
omission of eating utensils,
one is distinctly aware that
dinner at Tomfoolery's in
volves more than taste.
Happily, Tomfoolery's does
not sacrifice taste to the other
senses. Intrigued by the name
"Balls Afire!" and misled by
the name "Shrimp Flower," we
hazarded our way into the
"appeteasers."
The Balls Afires, $1.25, pre
sented themselves as seem
ingly innocent and very good

cheese puffs only to startle us
in a momentary lull with their
tabasco weaponry. The Shrimp
Flower, bland and overpriced,
$2.50, proved too virtuous for
our taste and would have pro
fited by borrowing a little of the
"Ball's" fire.
Zucchini soup followed in a
minature iron cauldron. Made
from a yogurt and potato base
and lightened with various
vegetables, it reportedly took
72 years to prepare. Bread
sticks were served in lieu of the
usual sourdough.
The salad was a fingerfood
fanatic's dream come true. A
large bowl of attractively ar
ranged vegetables (we
counted no fewer than fifteen,
including red and green pep
pers, cauliflower, carrots, spr
outs, broccoli, and cucum
bers) was placed at the center
of the table.

All were supplied with their
own cup of sour cream-herb
dressing for dipping, but
beyond that it was each man
for himself.
The wine selection was
rather limited, regional, and
lacked a good, dry white. Al
though diners are offered the
option of Tomfoolery's "pri
vate selection," discretion and
the lack of a major credit card
dictated a more moderate
choice â€” a dry Gemello
Cabernet Sauvignon, $4.75.
Tomfoolery's entrees are
evenly split between fondues
(which must be ordered by two
or more) and more common
continental and American dis
hes. All include sop, salad, and
potato.
We first attempted to order
cheese fondue, $5.95, but due
to flight difficulties, the
cheese, en route from Switzer

land, was detained in snow
laden LaGuardia Airport, forc
ing us to abandon our wildest
fondue fantasies.
Disappointed, but terribly
impressed, we proceeded to
order the Kitchen Sink Broil-
Fest meat fondue, $7.95, the
Rib Feed, $6.95, and scallops,
$6.95. Other possible choices
included "Fondue Bour
guigononne," $9.95, Tomfool
ery's Top Sirloin, $8.95, and for
vegetarians, Vegetarian Broil-
Fest, $4.95.
True to the Tomfoolery's
spirit, the Kitchen Sink meat
fondue was as fun to eat as it
was delicious. There were five
types of meat on the skewer:
veal, lamb, beef, and two kinds
of sausage.
The sauces, kept warm, if not
bubbling out of control, in our
own chafing dish, included
curry, terriaki, tarragon, and au

jus, with coconut shreds and
sesame seeds as condiments.
The meats were served
slightly raw so as to leave us the
fun of cooking them in the
small tub of peanut oil in the
center of the chafing dish.
This, combined with the
numerous choices of sauces
and meats, gave one the sense
of participating in a taste exper
iment.
The Rib Feed was a feed in
deed and showed Tomfool
ery's determination to prepare
even the most predictable dis

hes in new ways. The ribs were
not smothered in barbecue
sauce, but somewhat like the
"spareribs" available in many
Chinese restaurants, glazed
lightly and sweetly.
Naturally, one used no sil
verware. The scallops, served
in a light, lemon-butter wine
sauce, were as fresh and ten
der as the menu had promised.
Shunning the common baked
potato and its requisite en
tourage of silverware, Tom
foolery's complimented each
entree with homemade

' pommes frittes," sprinkled
lightly with parmesan cheese.
Tomfoolery's sole desert, a
cheese and fruit board, offered
welcome respite from the ear
lier rich and ample portions.
Cut into finger-size pieces, the
fruit was fresh, juicy, and obvi
ously newly arrived from
somewhere with better airline
service than Switzerland.
In short, for a good time, call
329-9100. Reservations ac
cepted.
