Mac Arthur Park
607 Front
San Francisco
Pic nics in the hills and barbeques at the
beach may have to wait for spring fever
and summer skies, but "dinner in the
park" is not as far away as you think. For
the chic and the sophisticated, dining at
Mac Arthur Park is the alternative to the
outdoor eating yet to come.
Lights, bold styling, and good taste have
transformed an old brick warehouse into a
restaurant of subtle drama and open inti
macy. Situated in the heart of the City's
financial district, Mac Arthur Park caters to
the young executive. The day's Wall Street
lournal decorates the bathroom walls
while the day's prices decorate the cus
tomer's expense account.
The bar is a distinctive ingredient in
Mac Arthur Park's personality. Cocktails
are served in a glassed-in patio where pot
ted trees, gas lamps, and high ceilings
provide the relaxed warmth of a sidewalk
cafe on even the coolest of San Francisco

evenings. Inside, an agate floor, sunken
lounge area, and mirrored panorama
make this bar one of San Francisco's favo
rite playpens.
The menu is extensive and pre
dominately a la carte. Fresh seafood and
thick steaks are the main features with a
wide range of appetizers, salads, and de
sserts also offered. The wine list is large
and includes an impressive collection of
both rare and California wines.
Capitalizing on our own "expense ac
count," we began our meal with an order
of escargots ($3.25 a half dozen) and a bot
tle of Wente Bros. Grey Riesling. Creamy
vegetable soup ($1.00), a crisp green salad
($1.25), and a warm loaf of french bread
completed what turned out to be a delici
ous prelude to the main entree.
One and a half pounds of Maine lobster
($13.00) and thirteen ounces of New York
steak ($9.00) were next in the culinary
sequence. Broiled in butter and garlic, the
lobster was a pleasant but perhaps un
necessary extravagance; the Pacific Red
Snapper ($5.75) or the Fisherman's Stew

($5.50) would have been a far more
economic and probably no less perfect
choice. Juicy, thick, and full-bodied, the
steak was another expensive treat.
Scalloped potatoes were served with
both dishes; mushrooms and broccoli
were extra ($l.OO ea.). The mushrooms
were delicate and delicious, but the broc
coli, undercooked and flavorless, was a
disappointment.
Dessert was the classic finishing touch.
Whatever the broccoli had lacked, the
chocolate mousse ($1.50) and mud pie
($1.50) made up for in beautiful style.
More like a pie than a pudding, the
mousse was an even richer variation of the
traditional 112 rench recipe. The mud pie was
one more "slice of heaven," a chocolate
cookie crust, coffee ice cream filling, and
fudge topping are three fantastic reasons
why. Classes of foamy Irish coffee ($1.25)
completed the meal and marked the end
of our sojourn in the world of the San
Francisco sophisticate.
