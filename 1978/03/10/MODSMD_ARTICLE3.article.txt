The University's Department of In
ternal Audit is investigating allega
tions that James McNally, director of
facilities at the Hospital, used Uni
versity resources for his personal
projects, a campus administrat6r
confirmed yesterday.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president of public affairs, said Mc-
Nally has been accused of using Uni
versity employees and University
materials for his own projects.
McNally had no comment on the
situation.
When asked last night if he wished
to comment on the allegations in this
story, McNally said, "I'll read about it
in tomorrow's Daily."
Two other Hospital employees and
one University employee were also
under investigation for similar allega
tions. Internal Audit recently found
them "wholly innocent," and all
three are cleared of any charges,
Rosenzweig said.
Internal Audit personnel declined
to confirm or deny any investigation.
"It is our policy not to comment on
anything we are investigating, if we
are investigating it," said Floyd
Growley of Internal Audit. "I can't
tell you if we are or are not conduct
ing an investigation."
Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the med
ical school, also declined to com
ment on the audit.
University administrators would
not say who made the allegations
against McNally, nor would they give
details about the allegations.
However, according to a source
who requested anonymity, McNally
is accused of using University per
sonnel, paid on University time, to
do personal work. McNally's work

ers allegedly used material bought by
University funds, the source said.
The Daily was told that Frank Petta,
former chief engineer, and Marty
Purcell, former materials manager,
both resigned last year after learning
of McNally's alleged actions.
Petta, who worked at the Hospital
from August 1976 until January 1977,
declined to comment, saying it could
"jeopardize his situation." He re
fused to explain this situation.
Purcell, employed at Stanford
from December 1976 until january

1978, was reportedly "harassed" by
facilities personnel until he left the
office, according to a second source.
"Purcell learned of the situation in
the facilities department and when
he questioned it, he got kicked out,"
a third source said.
One of the sources claimed that
time cards were filled out by facilities
personnel working on McNally's
projects and a Hospital secretary al
legedly processed the time cards.
The secretary refused to comment
on the situation.
