# Intimate dining for two

St. Tropez
126 Clement St.
San Francisco
Le St. Tropez ... a beautiful
beach on the French Riveria or
a charming restaurant on San
Francisco's Clement Street?
The choice is yours, but if
you're like me and your poc
ketbook is somewhat less ad
venturesome than your taste, I
suggestyou pick the latter. Vou
won't get a fabulous French
tan, but you will get a fantastic
French meal!
Intimate and very continen
tal, St. Tropez is designed with
two in mind. Brick walls, a
central fireplace, and beamed
ceilings highlight an atmos
phere well-versed in romantic
elegance. Long stemmed baby
roses and a single candle deco
rate each table; cosmopolitan
San Francisco may be just out
side the door, but provincial
France undoubtably prevails
within.
The list of dinner and a la
carte entrees is small yet dis

tinctive. The special of the day
— salmon with Hollandaise
sauce — is tempting but we de
cided to try the Cuisses de
Grenouille Provencale (frogs'
legs) and Le Carre d'Agneau
aux Herbes de Provence (rack
of lamb) instead. We also or
dered a bowl of the house soup
and a green salad. The soup is a
smooth and appropriate blend
of leeks, potatoes, and cream
and the salad is prepated true
to the European manner —
lightly torn lettuce leaves tos
sed with a tangy mustard and
vinegar dressing.
Both main dishes are served
with scalloped potatoes and
spinach mousse. The rack of
lamb is succulent, tender and
perfectly seasoned. Marinated
in its own juices and finely ac
cented with herbs and garlic,
the lamb is ambrosia. The
frogs' legs (Cuisses de Gre
nouille really does sound bet
ter) are sauteed in garlic butter
with sweet tomatoes and deli
cate herbs. A chilled bottle of

lohannesberg Riesling and a
basket of sweet french bread
are the final perfect touches to
our meal.
Dessert is equally pleasing;
the cheesecake (1.25) is
smooth and rich, the crust
light, while the Creme Rehver
see au Caramel (1.25), a simple
egg custard dripping in
caramel sauce, is our favorite.
The service is excellent. Our
waiter was pampering without
being obtrusive and efficient
without being hurried. Just as
there is only one St. Tropez
among beaches so is there only
one St. Tropez among restaur
ants.
A la carte entrees at St.
Tropez range from $6.00 to
$8.25, while dinners, served
with soup and salad, include
Canard Montmorency and
Veal Sweetbreads in sherry and
cream and range from $6.50 to
$8.95. An extensive wine list is
also available. Reservations are
suggested. (415) 387-0408.
