# Quiet romantic dining along the water in scenic Sausalito
## The 						lights from the city make ghosts in the fog 
### 
Stoma's of Sausalito
Along the Water
Sausalito
Sausalito is the California
answer to the fishing village. It
is built absolutely up and down
hills that end in San Francisco
Bay where in the place of a fish
ing fleet, usually a rather
smelly if picturesque affair with
sardines and cats hanging
around, there is a harbor filled
with sleek yachts.
There are several restaurants
along this water-front, the one
we went to is Scoma's. This es
tabishment uses a leaping fish
in the place of an apostrophe
on their menu; you will there
fore have guessed that seafood
is prominent a la carte.
The restaurant is built out
into the bay on pilings giving it
a rather vagabond and adven
turous look from the outside.
If you let your imagination
go, and there is a fog on the bay
which is not uncommon, you
can imagine yourself to be
James West going into a
shorefront drinking hell in

search of that elusive midget;
there are even a few strategi
cally placed fishing nets for at
mosphere.
We were seated at a white
clothed table set with live pink
flowers (something between
geraniums and begonias, be
neath some oil paintings of
sunsets over tropic isles.
Through the window behind
my dinner partner I could see
the street lights of Sausalito
making wavy patterns in the
water of the bay with the masts
of boats nodding gently in the
distance.
I assume my dinner partner
was treated to a similar view
out the windows of the oppo
site side of the building. The
restaurant has even better
views however; if you sit on
the San Francisco side you will
see the lights of that city re
flected over the bay.
After admiring the view for a
bit we focused ourattention on
the bill of fare. This is a com
plete list of all our favorite sea
food dishes with a few beefy

standbys (New York cut $8.75,
and ground chuck $4.50), just
in case.
There were seafood
cocktails, Olympia Oysters
($3.25) Bay Shrimp ($2.95),
salads include Crab Louis
($5.95) and Shrimp Louis
($5.50). And the shell fish —
Devilled Crab En Casserole
($5.75), Jumbo Shrimp Saute
($5.95), Australian Lobster Tail
($7.95) and Prawns ($5.95).
Then there was Seafood
Cannelloni, something the
menu described as a crepe
brimming with sea food, and
Sandabs Meuniere, which are
described as tender, delightful
and different, lamquitewilling
to take Scoma's word for it. The
thing that caught our eye was
Salmon with Hollandaise, but
alas it was out of season.
We ordered first from the
section tabled Shellfish On Ice
— and here's glory for you —
Blue Point Oysters on the half
shell. They came each pris
tinely on its half shell with the
black edge of the shell showing

all around.
The plate was pristine and
white with a black edge too,
and was heaped with shaved
ice. Unfortunately there were
only six oysters, and what with
having to share them with that
female across the table they
were gone before I had a
chance to properly appreciate
the sauce.
This female had the dinner
salad ($1.35) an ordinary ar
rangement of lettuce, saved by
the presence of Rogufort, not
blue cheese, dressing.
Our Entrees were Rex Sole
Meuniere ($4.95) and Calamari
Calabrese style ($4.75). The
sole was heaped on another of
these oysterlike plates,
perhaps five fillets with a butter
and lemon sauce.
It was served with thick noo
dles and parmesan cheese at
one end and a mixture of veg
etables at the other. The noo
dles were quite a complement
to the fish, and the vegetables,
though rather ordinary, gave
the meal a certain amount of

balance.
The Calamari was served on
a bed of rice with, perhaps un
fortunately, the same vegeta
bles. Calabrese style turned
out to be deep fried in batter
with some sort of hot sauce (we
suspect tabasco).
It was quite good in small
doses, but the portion was
rather large and the vegetables
did nothing to relieve the taste.
Our wine, a Frascati, was
white, light, and had enough

flavor to clear the sole's butter
and lemon sauce from the pa
late, but could do nothing
against the Calabrean inferno.
We asked for water.
Seeing us give up on the
Calamari, our waitress wisked
away our plates and took our
order for desert. One piece of
cheese cake between us was all
we felt capable of, so we or
dered that along with the cof
fee.
We were just starting to ad

mire the view again when three
waiters brought us coffee,
cheese cake and water; such
service we have not seen.
We ate our cheese cake,
drank our coffee and wended
our way out into a rainy night.
Had it not been raining we
would like to have examined
the shop windows of Sausalito,
but doing so in this weather
would have been to risk
drowning.

away our plates and took our
order for desert. One piece of
cheese cake between us was all
we felt capable of, so we or

Stoma's of Sausalito
Along the Water
Sausalito
Sausalito is the California
answer to the fishing village. It
is built absolutely up and down
hills that end in San Francisco
Bay where in the place of a fish
ing fleet, usually a rather
smelly if picturesque affair with
sardines and cats hanging
around, there is a harbor filled
with sleek yachts.
There are several restaurants
along this water-front, the one
we went to is Scoma's. This es
tabishment uses a leaping fish
in the place of an apostrophe
on their menu; you will there
fore have guessed that seafood
is prominent a la carte.
The restaurant is built out
into the bay on pilings giving it
a rather vagabond and adven
turous look from the outside.
If you let your imagination
go, and there is a fog on the bay
which is not uncommon, you
can imagine yourself to be
James West going into a
shorefront drinking hell in

search of that elusive midget;
there are even a few strategi
cally placed fishing nets for at
mosphere.
We were seated at a white
clothed table set with live pink
flowers (something between
geraniums and begonias, be
neath some oil paintings of
sunsets over tropic isles.
Through the window behind
my dinner partner I could see
the street lights of Sausalito
making wavy patterns in the
water of the bay with the masts
of boats nodding gently in the
distance.
I assume my dinner partner
was treated to a similar view
out the windows of the oppo
site side of the building. The
restaurant has even better
views however; if you sit on
the San Francisco side you will
see the lights of that city re
flected over the bay.
After admiring the view for a
bit we focused ourattention on
the bill of fare. This is a com
plete list of all our favorite sea
food dishes with a few beefy

standbys (New York cut $8.75,
and ground chuck $4.50), just
in case.
There were seafood
cocktails, Olympia Oysters
($3.25) Bay Shrimp ($2.95),
salads include Crab Louis
($5.95) and Shrimp Louis
($5.50). And the shell fish —
Devilled Crab En Casserole
($5.75), Jumbo Shrimp Saute
($5.95), Australian Lobster Tail
($7.95) and Prawns ($5.95).
Then there was Seafood
Cannelloni, something the
menu described as a crepe
brimming with sea food, and
Sandabs Meuniere, which are
described as tender, delightful
and different, lamquitewilling
to take Scoma's word for it. The
thing that caught our eye was
Salmon with Hollandaise, but
alas it was out of season.
We ordered first from the
section tabled Shellfish On Ice
— and here's glory for you —
Blue Point Oysters on the half
shell. They came each pris
tinely on its half shell with the
black edge of the shell showing

all around.
The plate was pristine and
white with a black edge too,
and was heaped with shaved
ice. Unfortunately there were
only six oysters, and what with
having to share them with that
female across the table they
were gone before I had a
chance to properly appreciate
the sauce.
This female had the dinner
salad ($1.35) an ordinary ar
rangement of lettuce, saved by
the presence of Rogufort, not
blue cheese, dressing.
Our Entrees were Rex Sole
Meuniere ($4.95) and Calamari
Calabrese style ($4.75). The
sole was heaped on another of
these oysterlike plates,
perhaps five fillets with a butter
and lemon sauce.
It was served with thick noo
dles and parmesan cheese at
one end and a mixture of veg
etables at the other. The noo
dles were quite a complement
to the fish, and the vegetables,
though rather ordinary, gave
the meal a certain amount of

balance.
The Calamari was served on
a bed of rice with, perhaps un
fortunately, the same vegeta
bles. Calabrese style turned
out to be deep fried in batter
with some sort of hot sauce (we
suspect tabasco).
It was quite good in small
doses, but the portion was
rather large and the vegetables
did nothing to relieve the taste.
Our wine, a Frascati, was
white, light, and had enough

flavor to clear the sole's butter
and lemon sauce from the pa
late, but could do nothing
against the Calabrean inferno.
We asked for water.
Seeing us give up on the
Calamari, our waitress wisked
away our plates and took our
order for desert. One piece of

a bed of rice with, perhaps un
fortunately, the same vegeta
bles. Calabrese style turned
out to be deep fried in batter
with some sort of hot sauce (we
suspect tabasco).
It was quite good in small
doses, but the portion was
rather large and the vegetables
did nothing to relieve the taste.
Our wine, a Frascati, was
white, light, and had enough

flavor to clear the sole's butter
and lemon sauce from the pa
late, but could do nothing
against the Calabrean inferno.
We asked for water.
Seeing us give up on the
Calamari, our waitress wisked
away our plates and took our
order for desert. One piece of
cheese cake between us was all
we felt capable of, so we or
dered that along with the cof
fee.
We were just starting to ad

mire the view again when three
waiters brought us coffee,
cheese cake and water; such
service we have not seen.
We ate our cheese cake,
drank our coffee and wended
our way out into a rainy night.
Had it not been raining we
would like to have examined
the shop windows of Sausalito,
but doing so in this weather
would have been to risk
drowning.
