The Olive Branch
865 High Street
Palo Alto
Health food restaurants bring to the
minds of most people boisterous, solid
mountain dwellers in down vests eating
pinion nuts and granola with chopsticks.
Fortunately this bizarre image is fading
as more and more people become vegeta
rian or merely learn to appreciate the joys
of a good sprout and a nice piece of tofu
(soybean curd) soaked in tamari (a soy
sauce without preservatives). Besides,
have you ever tried to eat granola with
chopsticks?
More and more health and vegetarian
restaurants are sprouting up all over the
country as Americans revolt against the
overhomogenized, sugar and preservative
filled foods they are forced to face every
day.
Granted, there is a tendency for restaur
ants to capitalize on the faddish aspect of
health foods and charge exorbitant prices
for salads that cost only pennies to pro
duce. But most often, vegetarian and
health restaurants are relaxed, moderately
priced houses of live, vitamin-filled foods.
The Olive Branch is a vegetarian restaur
ant serving no meat, fish or poultry. Lest
this repel you carnivores, the meals are
filling and, if you don't make a point of
reminding yourself, you won't even miss
those huge hunks of steak oozing blood.
The decor of The Olive Branch is sparse
and cafe-like, suitable for lunching and

casual dining. As well as serving lunch and
dinner, The Olive Branch stocks a moder
ate number of packaged whole grains,
nuts and other natural foods.
After glancing at the rows of freshly
baked wheat bread also for sale, we were
seated at one of several tables with chec
kered cloths. We found evidence of The
Olive Branch's religious orientation next
to the salt and pepper shakers: two leaflets
encouraging the "Search for Light." For
tunately, this philosophy is not oppres
sive. The leaflets are present only for vol
untary perusal.
Our first order was a fruit smoothie, a
luscious combination of different fruits
(the fresh strawberries dominate) mixed in
a blender with nuts and milk. Though this
marvelous concoction tastes like a thick
milkshake, our waitress assured me that
no ice cream is used.
After this drink two kinds of soup ap
peared, a mediocre minestrone with bar
ley, potatoes, lentils and other assorted
vegetables and a more titilating, delicately
seasoned lima bean chowder.
All of the entrees are in the $3 range. My
companion ordered a herbivorous main
dish entitled Oriental Express, a crisp mix
of rice, bean sprouts, tofu, cashews, al
monds, cauliflower, carrots, zucchini,
broccoli, alfalfa sprouts, olives and more,
seasoned with soy.
My main course was a rather indifferent
cashew pot pie with a pea flavour. The
wheat crust was the best part of this dish;
its main drawback was the improper use of

herbs.
Special tare must be taken in the sea
soning of cooked vegetarian dishes.
Crank's in London is the only place I have
experienced consistantly excellent hot
"veggie" creations. When vegetables are
mixed indiscriminately and cooked they
tend to all taste blandly the same.
Unfortunately, it is dishes like the
cashew pot pie that turn experimenting
meat eaters against the wonderful experi
ence of vegetarian dining.
Due to the pleasantly satisfied, never
overfed feeling a vegetable meal induces,
we were even excited at the prospect of
dessert, for us, mud pie and carrot cake.
The carrot cake was traditional and very
good, served with an orange sauce and
filled with lots of raisins and dates.
Mud pie was excellent, a tasty ice cream
pie with carob and coconut topping and a
granola and nut crust. Our waitress told us
that none of the dishes have any sugar. We
assume that even the ice cream is natural,
sweetened with honey or date sugar.
Feeling energetic after this vegetable
feast, we bounded out to our car. For a
moderately priced meal The Olive Branch
is a relaxed spot and it is always nice when
the committed pure food vegetarian does
not have to ask about meat, preservatives,
and sugar in every dish. Pure is the best
description of The Olive Branch, pure in
both philosophy and recipe.
