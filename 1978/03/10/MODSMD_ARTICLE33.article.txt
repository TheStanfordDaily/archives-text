# Ortega, Bruins crush Cardinal women again, 80-54
## Nelson leads Cards with 22 in last game of college career 
### Sukie Jackson 
The UCLA Bruins are a hot
team. But it took them 10 mi
nutes to warm up before they
burned Stanford 80-54 in their
first round match of the
WAIAW regional tournament.
The Cards did well to stay
within two points of the top
seeded Bruins for the first 10
minutes of the game. By run
ning a patient offense and
stopping the Bruin fast break
offense, Stanford tied the
score at 12-12.
"I thought Stanford played
well and we didn't play as well
as I expected," Bruin coach
Bille Moore said. "We couldn't
get our offense going. Stanford
sent three to four people back
on defense which stopped our
fast break," she added.
But even Stanford's best
could not keep up with the
powerful UCLA team. Whereas
some teams have one or two
top scorers, all the Bruins
proved to be scoring threats.
After UCLA widened its lead
to 41-26 at halftime, coach
Moore substituted freely from
the bench. The substitutes
maintained UCLA's fast-paced,
good basketball in the second
half and widened the score
even more, to 26 points at the
end of the game.
Leading the Bruins in scoring
was junior guard Anita Ortega
who had 18 points. Ann Meyer,
UCLA's best all around player
and Denise Curry both added

14 points to the total. Coach
Moore also praised Beth
Moore, Denise Corlett and
Debbie Willie for playing well
coming off the bench. Willie
shot six for 11 for 12 points.
For Stanford, senior Maggie
Nelson scored the game high
of 22 points in her last game as
a Stanford Cardinal. Both Kathy
Murphy and sophomore guard
Betsy Lough each added eight
points to the Stanford total.
Freshman Kathy Murphy,
who will have to face UCLA a
few more times in her college
career, said after the game,
"It's been a good year. It's
good to get a chance to play
them (UCLA) and I thought we
played well. I think they are a
couple of years ahead of us,
though."
The game, which marked the
beginning of UCLA's quest for
a national title marked the end
of the Cardinal's 1978 season.
But the Cards, who celebrated
the loss with champagne in the
locker room, were not disap
pointed. "We're happy with
our season," coach Dottie
McCrea said. I couldn't have
asked for anything more from
those kids."
The Cards ended their sea
son with a 17-12 record overall,
good for second in the North
ern California Athletic Confer
ence.
