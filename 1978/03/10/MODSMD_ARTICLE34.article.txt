# Gymnasts in Region 8s
## 
### Dean Eyre 
The culmination of almost two months of
competition and several months of work-outs
arrives for Stanford's two representatives in the
Region 8 Championships held this afternoon
and tomorrow evening at San Diego State Uni
versity.
Head coach Jackie Walker, sophomore Dana
Padden and senior Saundra Muramatsu flew
down yesterday and held workouts in prepara
tion for today's preliminaries.
San lose State, representing the Northern
California Athletic Conference, and other
teams, along with individual specialists and all
around gymnasts begin competition following
the 3 p.m. warmups.
The 10 best gymnasts are determined on the
basis of the preliminary routines and return for
tomorrow night's finals at 7:30 p.m.
Padden, competing in vaulting, and
Muramatsu, entered as an all-around com
petitor, face top-notch gymnasts.
The region is probably the second best in the
nation, so if either of the girls make finals it will
be quite an accomplishment. The Eastern region
(of the nine in the country) is probably the
strongest," Walker said.
Included in the meet are second-ranked Ful
lerton State, Long Beach State and San Diego
State, which are rated among the top 20, USC
and UCLA.
It's some really good competition and they'll
have nationally rated judges, so it should be
really exciting," said Walker.
While Walker has been to regional and na
tional meets, most recently as head coach of
four-time Region 4 camp Louisiana State, Pad
den and Muramatsu are getting their first taste

of post-season competition.
"I didn't really think about the possibility of
making it (to the regionals) before. I guess I'm
sort of surprised. I think I probably knew that I
could do it, but I wasn't expecting to," Padden
said.
Qualifying with an 8.55 in last Friday's confer
ence meet, Padden isn't changing vaults. She
has decided to stay with "vaults that I have per
formed all season — nothing new or fancy."
Working mainly on vaulting, instead of her
usual four events, is "easier — there's a lot less
pressure. It's better to be able to concentrate
hard on one event and just practice the other
things," Padden said.
Muramatsu, competing for the first time in
two weeks, received final approval from her
doctor on Wednesday.
"It was just up to me to get my weight (lifting)
up and I'm up to where he wanted it. I actually
feel better— I think I needed a little rest," she
said.
"The other three events don't suffer (during ?.
layoff) but you have to keep up endurance for
floor exercise," Walker said. "We're kind of
holding off on tumbling because that's probably
going to put the most stress on it (Muramatsu's
knee)."
Noting the different feel of a regional meet,
Padden said, "This is a nice reward after going
through a whole season of practice and hard
meets and not always being up for them physi
cally, mentally."
"This is the first time we're doing something
for ourselves because the others (meets) have
been teamwork. It's a nice little treat,"
Muramatsu added.
