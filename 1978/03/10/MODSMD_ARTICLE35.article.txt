# IM semi-final protest upheld
## 
### Marcia Hadeler 
While the rest of the IM
leagues wind down to the fi
nals with relatively no great
fanfare, the men's B basketball
league flares with a last minute
controversy before the champ
ionship game.
The first of Wednesday's
semifinals ended with no prob
lem as Los Curanderos hand
led Trancos with little diffi
culty, to take a 5-0 record into
the finals. The second game of
the semifinal competition,
however, typified the intense
competition that has prolifer
ated in the B league this quar
ter.
The contest pitted Eucalypto
Again, last year's B champs,
against the predominantly
freshman squad from Larkin
dormitory. A large, vocal
crowd turned out for the game,
mostly in support of the
orange-clad Larkinites. They
were not disappointed as the
defense of Larkin held off a late
Againer charge to win, 42-40. It
was the third straight game
they had won by two points. Or
so it seemed.
Controversy arose when a
protest petition by Eucalypto
Again was upheld yesterday,
forcing a replay of the final
three minutes, 32 seconds, to
be played before the champ
ionship game on Sunday. The
protest was over a foul call
which the officials said was
Eucalypto's team fifth, giving
Larkin a 1-and-1 shooting situa

tion. Both shots were made
and the two points proved the
winning margin.
Yesterday, however,
Eucalypto protested, claiming
the foul was not their fifth team
foul, in which case Larkin
would not have been awarded
the shots, and would have
merely had the ball out-of
bounds.
In other leagues, Los Cau
sations will match up against
the Zetes this Monday night at
9:30 p.m. in Maples. Entering
the A division finals, Los Causa
tions, a law school team, holds
a 5-0 record. Their opponents,
the Zetes, ended their regular

season with a strong 4-1 re
cord. Both teams have met be
fore during the regular season
with Los Causations taking the
win 47-30. Los Causations were
the A league champions last
year.
Meeting this Sunday at noon
in Maples for the first time will
be Hockey I, the women's A
champions, and Spirit of
Faisan, the women's B champ
ions.
At 1 p.m. the C division
finalists will clash in an all-out
air balling event. Sloan, a
group of businessmen rein
carnated as students, hold a 4-1
record. The Bootables II team

also carry a 4-1 record with
them into the finals.
Ringers wins weight-lifting
Whitman Ringers swept a
small field of nine competitors
in the IM Weight-lifting meet
held Feb. 22, winning all six
weight division titles. Despite
the small turnout however,
several records wore broken.
The individual champs were:
Kevin Martin — 132 lb. divi
sion, team captain Eric Wells —
148 lbs., Raul Castellanos —
165 lbs., Greg Adamson — 181
lbs., Bob Lacroix — 198 lbs.,
and Jesus Hernandez —
heavyweight.

9:30 p.m. in Maples. Entering
the A division finals, Los Causa
tions, a law school team, holds
a 5-0 record. Their opponents,
the Zetes, ended their regular

season with a strong 4-1 re
cord. Both teams have met be
fore during the regular season

them into the finals.
Ringers wins weight-lifting
Whitman Ringers swept a
small field of nine competitors
in the IM Weight-lifting meet
held Feb. 22, winning all six
weight division titles. Despite
the small turnout however,
several records wore broken.
The individual champs were:
Kevin Martin — 132 lb. divi
sion, team captain Eric Wells —
148 lbs., Raul Castellanos —
165 lbs., Greg Adamson — 181
lbs., Bob Lacroix — 198 lbs.,
and Jesus Hernandez —
heavyweight.
While the rest of the IM
leagues wind down to the fi
nals with relatively no great
fanfare, the men's B basketball
league flares with a last minute
controversy before the champ
ionship game.
The first of Wednesday's
semifinals ended with no prob
lem as Los Curanderos hand
led Trancos with little diffi
culty, to take a 5-0 record into
the finals. The second game of
the semifinal competition,
however, typified the intense
competition that has prolifer
ated in the B league this quar
ter.
The contest pitted Eucalypto
Again, last year's B champs,
against the predominantly
freshman squad from Larkin
dormitory. A large, vocal
crowd turned out for the game,
mostly in support of the
orange-clad Larkinites. They
were not disappointed as the
defense of Larkin held off a late
Againer charge to win, 42-40. It
was the third straight game
they had won by two points. Or
so it seemed.
Controversy arose when a
protest petition by Eucalypto
Again was upheld yesterday,
forcing a replay of the final
three minutes, 32 seconds, to
be played before the champ
ionship game on Sunday. The
protest was over a foul call
which the officials said was
Eucalypto's team fifth, giving
Larkin a 1-and-1 shooting situa

tion. Both shots were made
and the two points proved the
winning margin.
Yesterday, however,
Eucalypto protested, claiming
the foul was not their fifth team
foul, in which case Larkin
would not have been awarded
the shots, and would have
merely had the ball out-of
bounds.
