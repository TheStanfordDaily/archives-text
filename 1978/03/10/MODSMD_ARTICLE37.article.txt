Apparently unaffected by
their one day rest due to
Wednesday's rain, the Stan
ford men's tennis team rol
led past U.C. Santa Barbara
8-1 at the varsity courts yes
terday.
The Cards were paced by
the strong singles play of
two year letterman John
Rast who defeated Jacques
Manset 6-1, 7-5 in the fea
ture singles match. In
another strong showing,
Stanford's sophomore
southpaws Peter Rennert
and Jim Hodges defeated
Scott Bedocca 6-3, 6-2 and
Dave Seibel 6-1,6-0, respec
tively, in the number two
and three singles matches.
Stanford's only loss came in
the number three doubles
match as the Cards Jeff
Brandon and Greg Hing lost
to Seibel and Ken Koch in
three sets.
Card coach Dick Could
had decided to rest Stan
ford's "big guns" Matt
Mitchell, John McEnroe,
Bill Maze arid Perry Wright,
all of whom will be playing
somewhere in the top four
this year.
