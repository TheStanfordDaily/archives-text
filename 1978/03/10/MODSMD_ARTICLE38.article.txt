Stanford Hockey wins
The Stanford hockey team
came from behind last Sunday
to beat Berkeley, 7-5, improv
ing its record to 10-0. The game
was played in the Cow Palace
prior to the San Francisco
Shamrocks-Phoenix game, and
an estimated 3400 people were
in attendance.
Berkeley started the scoring
and at one point led 3-1 before
the Cards came roaring back to
take the lead, 5-4. Jay Johnston
led the Stanford scoring with
two goals, and Grove Nichols,
Ken Breitenbach, Henry Dud
ley, and John von Schlegell,
each added one.
"We were really pleased
with the turnout for the game,"
said player-coach Pat Baldwin,
"although it will be so much
the better when Stanford gets
some home ice closer to cam
pus."
"It's too bad that one of Stan
ford's most successful athletic
teams plays only one or two
games a year within a half hour
of campus," added captain
Chris James. "Hockey is the
type of spectator sport that can
really generate a lot of fan sup
port and good attendance."
Most of Stanford's players
are, in fact, students from the
Midwest and East Coast, where
hockey is often a varsity sport
and is more widely followed
than in California.
"Hopefully some Stanford

hockey player will get rich and
donate a rink to the school,"
added center Mark Cunha.
Unfortunately, most hockey
players are bums and have
enough trouble graduating."
The Stanford hockey team
will play its final game of the
season this weekend against
Monterey.
Badminton takes tourna
ment
The Stanford women's bad
minton team won the seven
team Fresno Intercollegiate In
vitational Badminton Tourna

In addition to capturing the
team championship, the Cards

also took the overall tourna

Jose State golfers finished

The Spartans had a 336 team

the way the whole team per
formed," said Card coach Jean
Helliwell. Of the 12 Cards
competing during the
weekend, only one had been
to the tournament before.
"Most of them will be back
next year," said Helliwell.
