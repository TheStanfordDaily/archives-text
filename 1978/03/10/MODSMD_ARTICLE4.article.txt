# Administration obtains back-to-work order
## 
### 
Washington (AP) —A federal judge
yesterday ordered coal miners to re
port to work tomorrow morning and
temporarily end a 94-day strike that
has forced widespread power cur
tailments and the layoff of thousands
of workers.
There is widespread expectation
within the government as well as
both the union and industry that
thousands of rebellious miners will
defy the order.
But President ]immy Carter de
clared at a news conference three
hours before U.S. District Judge Au
brey Robinson signed the order:
"The law must be enforced.
"I believe the coal miners to be
patriotic and law-abiding citizens,
and I believe that a substantial por
tion, an adequate proportion of
them will comply with the law," Car
ter said.
Direct enforcement
Carter said he has ordered Attor
ney General Griffin Bell to direct en
forcement of the order, which was
expected to prohibit picketing or in
terference with deliveries of coal or
with miners who want to return to
work.
Robinson issued the back-to-work
order under the Taft-Hartley Act as
the striking United Mine Workers
and the soft coal industry unexpec
tedly agreed to resume contract
talks.
They set their first negotiating ses
sion for this morning.
Robinson's order becomes effec
tive at 7 a.m. local time today and
requires coal miners to work for the
same wages and benefits they re
ceived under the most recent con
tract — the one signed in 1974 that
expired on Dec. 6.
Court arguments
Robinson's order followed an af
ternoon of court arguments involv
ing lawyers for the government, the
UMW and the coal operators.
Robinson, after hearing arguments
from Attorney General Griffin Bell,
agreed that "such strikes, if permit
ted to continue, will imperil the na
tional health or safety."
The order is directed against 1451
defendants, including the United
Mine Workers, its local unions, mine
work contractors and mine

operators.
The judge directed federal mars
hals to serve each defendant with a
copy of the order, together with the
complaint by the government and all
the legal papers that went with it on
or before 4:30 p.m. EST next Mon
day.
A Justice Department attorney said
that technically, a defendant is not
required to obey the order if he has
not been served with it.
The order does not spell out any
penalties for noncompliance, al
though a defendant is subject to the
contempt power of the court, which
may include fines and imprison
ment.
Hearing ordered
The restraining order expires at 6
p.m. EST on March 17. The judge has
ordered a hearing for that day — a
week from tomorrow — on a motion
for a preliminary injunction.
The judge's order specified that
the defendants continue bargaining
"and to make every effort to adjust
and settle their differences."
The announcement that negotia
tions would resume followed a pri
vate session at the UMW headquar
ters, where top industry officials and
union leaders agreed on terms for
reopening talks.
It was not immediately known
which side in the long dispute had
initiated the face-to-face meeting be
tween the union and the leaders of
the Bituminous Coal Operators As
sociation.
Contract rejected
Representatives of the two sides
last met more than 10 days ago, be
fore the industry agreed to the un
ion's contract demands as President
Carter prepared to intervene. The
contract later was rejected by the un
ion's rank-and-file membership.
An industry spokesman said
Nicholas Camicia, president of
Pittston Coal Co., and Stonie Barker,
president of Island Creek Coal, met
with Miller in the union chief's of
fice. Both Camicia and Barker have
experience as underground miners,
which is unusual among top industry
negotiators.
Sources said substantive talks
would begin without the presence of
federal mediators.
