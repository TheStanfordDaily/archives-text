Somali troops retreat from desert
Mogadishu, Somalia — Somalia said yesterday it is
withdrawing its regular army troops from Ethiopia's dis
puted Ogaden Desert, where they have been helping
ethnic Somali tribesmen in their war against Ethiopian
rule.
In Washington, President Jimmy Carter praised the
Somali decision and called on the Soviet Union and
Cuba to leave the area as well.
"The United States looks forward to the withdrawal of
all foreign forces at an early date," Carter said at a news
conference.
Ethiopian forces, with Cuban and Soviet support, ap
pear to have been routing the out-numbered Somali
regular army forces and the insurgents in the northern
part of the Ogaden recently. The ethnic Somalis have
been fighting to take the area from Ethiopia since last
July.
The government said the decision to withdraw regular
troops was made to help bring about a peaceful solution
to the conflict and because of pressure from the "big
powers."
"In view of the proposals of the big powers to settle
the crisis in the Horn of Africa peacefully and to with
draw all foreign forces from the region . . . the central
committee of the Somali Socialist Revolutionary Party
has approved a resolution that the S.D.R. (Somali
Democratic Republic) should recall its units from the
front," the announcement said.
Second blackout hits California
Sacramento — Legislators met by candlelight yester
day as a wide area of downtown Sacramento was blacked
out by a power failure — the second powerless Califor
nia city in as many days.
The blackout affected one-third of the capitol city's
downtown area, said Jeff Marx of the Sacramento Munic
ipal Utility District.
No injuries were immediately reported.
Three elevators in downtown buildings were stuck
and the occupants were successfully rescued, according
to Captain R.T. Roark of the fire department.
Marx blamed the 2:13 p.m. PST outage on a defective
underground cable. He said he didn't know how soon
power could be restored.
The blackout came one day after a power failure struck
San Diego in southern California, leaving more than one
million residents without electricity.
The lights in the state Capitol went out during legisla
tive hearings.
Emergency power generators kept lights burning in
the governor's office, the state police yffice and some
hallways, according to Robert Ries of the state police.
One Capitol elevator ran on emergency power.
U.S. confronts Russia over treaty
Geneva, Switzerland — The Soviet Union proposed an
international treaty yesterday to outlaw the neutron
bomb and was promptly accused of hypocrisy by the
United States in one of the sharpest East-West confron
tations in recent years at the Geneva disarmament con
ference.
Introducing the draft treaty to the 35-nation confer
ence, Soviet thief delegate Victory Likhachev said Mos
cow might take "retaliatory measures" if the barbaric"
weapon is introduced into the Western arsenal.
Likhachev said the neutron bomb would pose a threat
to detente and seriously undermine the belief of the
peoples ... in the success of ongoing disarmament
negotiations."
U.S. Ambassador Adrian Fisher reacted with what he
called some plain talk which will not be pleasant talk."
He said the months-long Soviet campaign against the
neutron weapon focused only on one aspect of the arms
race, and he challenged the Soviets to discuss their new
SS-20 multi-warhead missile, which is capable of striking
any target in Europe "and which is now being deployed

in large numbers."
Carter won't pressure Begin
Washington — In his fifth news conference this year,
President Jimmy Carter said he has no intention of trying
to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin into
making concessions sought by Arab states. But he also
criticized Begin's resistance to ending the Israeli occu
pation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and said the
Middle East situation has deteriorated since Egyptian
leader Anwar Sadat went to Jerusalem in November.
At the same time Carter cautioned Begin, who will visit
Washington next week, that it would be "a very serious
blow" to peace prospects if Israel continues to insist it is
not required by U.N. Security Council resolutions to
withdraw from the West Bank.
Food prices up; no relief in sight
Washington — Wholesale food prices soared in Feb
ruary by the biggest margin in three years and the Labor
Department said there is no evidence that March will
bring any relief to consumers.
The higher prices should start showing up soon at the
retail level — the supermarket — particularly in the
meatsection, Labor Department analysts said yesterday.
The department said the prices that manufacturers
charge supermarkets and other retailers for consumer
food rose 2.9 per cent in February, the largest increase
since a 4.1 per cent gain in November, 1974.
Aid pending for American Gls
Augsburg, West Germany — Hundreds of West Ger
mans have sent money to a fund for low-ranking Gls
strapped by the fall of the dollar following a nationwide
TV program that reported their plight, an Army chaplain
said yesterday.
Col. Frank Deese, a Baptist chaplain at this post in
south Germany, told The Associated Press he set up the
fund Feb. 23 at a German bank to solicit contributions
from German civilians and U.S. military families.
With the money, Deese plans to buy a van to provide
free transportation to low-cost military commissaries,
PXs and hospitals for Gl families who cannot afford cars.
Return of hijackers delayed
New York — Six fugitives wanted for hijacking airliners

The FBI had said the six would be flown to Montreal,
where U.S. marshals would join them for a flight to New
York's Kennedy Airport. FBI agents were stationed at
Kennedy to arrest the six.

Somali troops retreat from desert
Mogadishu, Somalia — Somalia said yesterday it is
withdrawing its regular army troops from Ethiopia's dis
puted Ogaden Desert, where they have been helping
ethnic Somali tribesmen in their war against Ethiopian
rule.
In Washington, President Jimmy Carter praised the
Somali decision and called on the Soviet Union and
Cuba to leave the area as well.
"The United States looks forward to the withdrawal of
all foreign forces at an early date," Carter said at a news
conference.
Ethiopian forces, with Cuban and Soviet support, ap
pear to have been routing the out-numbered Somali
regular army forces and the insurgents in the northern
part of the Ogaden recently. The ethnic Somalis have
been fighting to take the area from Ethiopia since last
July.
The government said the decision to withdraw regular
troops was made to help bring about a peaceful solution
to the conflict and because of pressure from the "big
powers."
"In view of the proposals of the big powers to settle
the crisis in the Horn of Africa peacefully and to with
draw all foreign forces from the region . . . the central
committee of the Somali Socialist Revolutionary Party
has approved a resolution that the S.D.R. (Somali
Democratic Republic) should recall its units from the
front," the announcement said.
Second blackout hits California
Sacramento — Legislators met by candlelight yester
day as a wide area of downtown Sacramento was blacked
out by a power failure — the second powerless Califor
nia city in as many days.
The blackout affected one-third of the capitol city's
downtown area, said Jeff Marx of the Sacramento Munic
ipal Utility District.
No injuries were immediately reported.
Three elevators in downtown buildings were stuck
and the occupants were successfully rescued, according
to Captain R.T. Roark of the fire department.
Marx blamed the 2:13 p.m. PST outage on a defective
underground cable. He said he didn't know how soon
power could be restored.
The blackout came one day after a power failure struck
San Diego in southern California, leaving more than one
million residents without electricity.
The lights in the state Capitol went out during legisla
tive hearings.
Emergency power generators kept lights burning in
the governor's office, the state police yffice and some
hallways, according to Robert Ries of the state police.
One Capitol elevator ran on emergency power.
U.S. confronts Russia over treaty
Geneva, Switzerland — The Soviet Union proposed an
international treaty yesterday to outlaw the neutron
bomb and was promptly accused of hypocrisy by the
United States in one of the sharpest East-West confron
tations in recent years at the Geneva disarmament con
ference.
Introducing the draft treaty to the 35-nation confer
ence, Soviet thief delegate Victory Likhachev said Mos
cow might take "retaliatory measures" if the barbaric"
weapon is introduced into the Western arsenal.
Likhachev said the neutron bomb would pose a threat
to detente and seriously undermine the belief of the
peoples ... in the success of ongoing disarmament
negotiations."
U.S. Ambassador Adrian Fisher reacted with what he
called some plain talk which will not be pleasant talk."
He said the months-long Soviet campaign against the
neutron weapon focused only on one aspect of the arms
race, and he challenged the Soviets to discuss their new
SS-20 multi-warhead missile, which is capable of striking
any target in Europe "and which is now being deployed

in large numbers."
Carter won't pressure Begin
Washington — In his fifth news conference this year,
President Jimmy Carter said he has no intention of trying
to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin into
making concessions sought by Arab states. But he also
criticized Begin's resistance to ending the Israeli occu
pation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and said the
Middle East situation has deteriorated since Egyptian
leader Anwar Sadat went to Jerusalem in November.
At the same time Carter cautioned Begin, who will visit
Washington next week, that it would be "a very serious
blow" to peace prospects if Israel continues to insist it is
not required by U.N. Security Council resolutions to
withdraw from the West Bank.
Food prices up; no relief in sight
Washington — Wholesale food prices soared in Feb

retail level — the supermarket — particularly in the
meatsection, Labor Department analysts said yesterday.
The department said the prices that manufacturers
charge supermarkets and other retailers for consumer
food rose 2.9 per cent in February, the largest increase
since a 4.1 per cent gain in November, 1974.

free transportation to low-cost military commissaries,
PXs and hospitals for Gl families who cannot afford cars.

Somali troops retreat from desert
Mogadishu, Somalia — Somalia said yesterday it is
withdrawing its regular army troops from Ethiopia's dis
puted Ogaden Desert, where they have been helping
ethnic Somali tribesmen in their war against Ethiopian
rule.
In Washington, President Jimmy Carter praised the
Somali decision and called on the Soviet Union and
Cuba to leave the area as well.
"The United States looks forward to the withdrawal of
all foreign forces at an early date," Carter said at a news
conference.
Ethiopian forces, with Cuban and Soviet support, ap
pear to have been routing the out-numbered Somali
regular army forces and the insurgents in the northern
part of the Ogaden recently. The ethnic Somalis have
been fighting to take the area from Ethiopia since last
July.
The government said the decision to withdraw regular
troops was made to help bring about a peaceful solution
to the conflict and because of pressure from the "big
powers."
"In view of the proposals of the big powers to settle
the crisis in the Horn of Africa peacefully and to with
draw all foreign forces from the region . . . the central
committee of the Somali Socialist Revolutionary Party
has approved a resolution that the S.D.R. (Somali
Democratic Republic) should recall its units from the
front," the announcement said.
Second blackout hits California
Sacramento — Legislators met by candlelight yester
day as a wide area of downtown Sacramento was blacked
out by a power failure — the second powerless Califor
nia city in as many days.
The blackout affected one-third of the capitol city's
downtown area, said Jeff Marx of the Sacramento Munic
ipal Utility District.
No injuries were immediately reported.
Three elevators in downtown buildings were stuck
and the occupants were successfully rescued, according
to Captain R.T. Roark of the fire department.
Marx blamed the 2:13 p.m. PST outage on a defective
underground cable. He said he didn't know how soon
power could be restored.
The blackout came one day after a power failure struck
San Diego in southern California, leaving more than one
million residents without electricity.
The lights in the state Capitol went out during legisla
tive hearings.
Emergency power generators kept lights burning in
the governor's office, the state police yffice and some
hallways, according to Robert Ries of the state police.
One Capitol elevator ran on emergency power.
U.S. confronts Russia over treaty
Geneva, Switzerland — The Soviet Union proposed an
international treaty yesterday to outlaw the neutron
bomb and was promptly accused of hypocrisy by the
United States in one of the sharpest East-West confron
tations in recent years at the Geneva disarmament con
ference.
Introducing the draft treaty to the 35-nation confer
ence, Soviet thief delegate Victory Likhachev said Mos
cow might take "retaliatory measures" if the barbaric"
weapon is introduced into the Western arsenal.
Likhachev said the neutron bomb would pose a threat
to detente and seriously undermine the belief of the
peoples ... in the success of ongoing disarmament
negotiations."
U.S. Ambassador Adrian Fisher reacted with what he
called some plain talk which will not be pleasant talk."
He said the months-long Soviet campaign against the
neutron weapon focused only on one aspect of the arms
race, and he challenged the Soviets to discuss their new
SS-20 multi-warhead missile, which is capable of striking
any target in Europe "and which is now being deployed

in large numbers."
Carter won't pressure Begin
Washington — In his fifth news conference this year,
President Jimmy Carter said he has no intention of trying
to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin into
making concessions sought by Arab states. But he also
criticized Begin's resistance to ending the Israeli occu
pation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and said the
Middle East situation has deteriorated since Egyptian
leader Anwar Sadat went to Jerusalem in November.
At the same time Carter cautioned Begin, who will visit
Washington next week, that it would be "a very serious
blow" to peace prospects if Israel continues to insist it is
not required by U.N. Security Council resolutions to
withdraw from the West Bank.
Food prices up; no relief in sight
Washington — Wholesale food prices soared in Feb
ruary by the biggest margin in three years and the Labor
Department said there is no evidence that March will
bring any relief to consumers.
The higher prices should start showing up soon at the
retail level — the supermarket — particularly in the
meatsection, Labor Department analysts said yesterday.
The department said the prices that manufacturers
charge supermarkets and other retailers for consumer
food rose 2.9 per cent in February, the largest increase
since a 4.1 per cent gain in November, 1974.
Aid pending for American Gls
Augsburg, West Germany — Hundreds of West Ger
mans have sent money to a fund for low-ranking Gls
strapped by the fall of the dollar following a nationwide
TV program that reported their plight, an Army chaplain
said yesterday.
Col. Frank Deese, a Baptist chaplain at this post in
south Germany, told The Associated Press he set up the
fund Feb. 23 at a German bank to solicit contributions
from German civilians and U.S. military families.
With the money, Deese plans to buy a van to provide
free transportation to low-cost military commissaries,
PXs and hospitals for Gl families who cannot afford cars.

York's Kennedy Airport. FBI agents were stationed at
