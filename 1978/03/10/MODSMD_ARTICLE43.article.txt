# Future Soviet politics discussed

### Jonathan Slater 
The consequences of a potential
power struggle in the Soviet Union,
to be triggered by the impending
death of Leonid Brezhnev, were out
lined in a speech by Richard Lowent
hal last night at the Law School.
Lowenthal, professor emeritus of
international relations at the Free
University of Berlin, indicated "a lin
ing up" of two major political fac
tions within the Communist Bloc and
particularly the Soviet Union await
ing the opportunity for power.
He commented on four key policy

directions which will be determined
by Brezhnev's successors. They are:
— either investment on continued
armament expansion or emphasis on
domestic welfare spending,
— major changes in the economic
structure or preservation of
economic rigidity,
— communication with the West
ern world or further isolation and
— relaxation of repression against
political aggression to improve living
conditions or intensified regressive
efforts.
He described two political move
ments in opposition to the present

regime. One group he termed as
"liberal Western Marxists" whose
viewpoints side with the former
policies listed above. The others rep
resent an anti-Western, neo
nationalist tendency leaning towards
a resurgency of traditional Russian
policies characterized by the latter
policies and "with important links
within the Communist Youth Or
ganization and the Red Army.
"Before our eyes the disintegra
tion of the Lenin-Marxist ideology is
taking place," said Lowenthal in em
phasizing this crucial moment in
Russian and thus world history.
Moreover, he stressed the virtual
necessity of a unified position on be
half of Western nations.
By taking strong political positions
on issues of armament expansion
and humanitarian conduct, Western
nations can, for the first time, play a
key role in determining the course of
internal Soviet policy, according to
Lowenthal.
"The absence of strategy between
the different Western powers is a fact
of an absence of strategy by its lead
ing power — the U. 5.," added Low
enthal.
As a result, he said that the West
has handicapped itself.
"The U.S. today is a paralyzed
giant from whom nothing has to be
hoped and nothing has to be feared.
This means that when we might have
hope and influence that we don't
have that influence," stated Lowent
hal.
He stressed the "need for Western
policy capable of action — of deci
sive polity — of putting clear objec
tives before Soviet leaders."
If we can manage this ac
complishment, "we can do a great
deal to make East-West relationships
more safe," said Lowenthal. If not,
he added "we shall miss an historic
opportunity."
