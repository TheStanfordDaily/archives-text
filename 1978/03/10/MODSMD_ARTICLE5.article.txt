# Two CIR students lean toward S. Africa corporate withdrawal
## 
### Joel Dickholtz News analysis 
With the forces in the South African controversy
apparently polarized and firmly maintaining their
stands, the Stanford community awaits the action of
the Commission on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
Two student members of the commission, Ron
Johnson and Lee Goldman, told the Daily that they
are leaning towards" supporting corporate with
drawal from South Africa. But both also mentioned
they were not necessarily sure that divestment would
lead to this action.
Ron Johnson indicated that he might favor divest
ment of stock in a few corporations tnat have been
the worst offenders. However, Goldman said, "If we
were to divest, we should divest either all of the
stocks or none of them. Partial divestment would be
inconsistent."
Five more of the 12 voting members of the commit
tee were contacted, but declined to state their pre
sent views. Four of those five, however, com
plimented the students and faculty involved in the
open forum Monday night, when approximately 30
speakers called for divestment.
Operations Research Prof. Fred Hillier, chairman of
the CIR, said the commission will prepare a report
outlining its position on the controversy by April 11,
in time for April's Board of Trustees meeting.
YWCrt divests
In another development, the Stanford YWCA
Board of Directors voted Wednesday night to begin
the process of divesting itself of all its stock in corpo
rations operating in South Africa, according to YWCA
Executive Director Susan Tilson.

The YWCA owns a mutual fund stock holding of
approximately $100,000. Of the corporations in the
fund, 30 per cent have holdings in South Africa, Til
son said. The mutual fund will have to be sold, and
the money reinvested in company's without South
Africa holdings, she said.
"Obviously, what we are doing is a gesture and is
going to cost us money," Tilson said. As a result of its
action, the local YWCA will "recommend to all other
Ys" that they divest similar stock holdings, she said.
The divestment question is causing concern all
over the nation. According to Stanford Committee
for a Responsible Investment Policy spokesperson
Maggie Coud, 88 schools across the nation have ac
tive groups calling for withdrawal from South Africa.
Among those are eight University of California
schools (including Berkeley, UCLA and Santa Cruz),
seven Cal State schools, Yale, University of Chicago,
Harvard, Wellesley, Brandeis, Amhearst, Michigan
State, Princeton, Rutgers, Columbia, Cornell,
Dartmouth, Duke, Ohio State, University of Pennsyl
vania and Brown.
Two conferences will be held on April 2 to plan
future action supporting divestment, said SCRIP
member Linda Gardner. A Yale conference will unite
schools and communities in the North Eastern United
States, while a similar western conference is planned,
possibly at Stanford.
Chris Cray is a member of the South Africa Catalyst
Project, which is organizing schools all over the state.
Last week he told the Daily, "Stanford is a leader in
this movement. We can be proud, and the trustees
can be pissed."
