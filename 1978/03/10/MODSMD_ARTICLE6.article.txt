## Link with politics, economics Ecological stress needed 
### 
Amy Pinkerton

Our greatest ecological problem
could be the threat of nuclear war or
a terrorist incident releasing large
amounts of radiation into the envi
ronment, resulting in so many muta
tions that life could become extinct.
Thus environmentalists should con
cern themselves with problems of
politics and economics.
I feel we should meet with the
Soviets and other non-allies on the
common ground of solving our
countries' problems through more
ecological practices. Neither of our
countries wants to see a war, we just
want to be assured of comfortable,
safe lives — and more ecological
practices can increase food supply,
available housing, jobs and the
health standard.
If the rich countries would con
serve and recycle more, and increase
food production through high
yielding organic farming methods,
we would have less economic need
for other countries' resources, and
so would not have to try to strategi
cally control them.
Useful competition
The capitalist/communist war
should be an ideological one, not
one of killing. No one can truly win a
country through militarily dominat
ing it — the socioeconomic system
will not work because the people will
be dissatisfied.
Therefore, our competitions
should take the form of seeing who
can help other countries the most,
through useful advice and
technological aid (birth control,
health care, energy, transportation,
etc.).
Unfortunately, the British gov
ernment recently announced that
the Soviets are spending 11 to 13 per
cent of their resources on a military
buildup which is said to be overtak
ing NATO forces. In response, Presi
dent jimmy Carter is raising the milit
ary budget this year by $9 billion, to
$126 billion for a year, whereas he
promised in his campaign to cut the
budget.
This is serious, and we should try
harder to cooperate with the Soviets
and try to get them to agree on a
freeze of further arms production,
and a no-first-use-of-nuclear
weapons agreement for ourselves
and our respective allies.
The Soviets could see some en
couraging signs in our political
thought if they looked hard enough.
Many grassroots organizations in the
U.S. are interested in worker control
of industries and profit-sharing, two
socialist ideals.
However, due to the small-is
beautiful legacy, many American
groups do not want state-run indus

tries — they would keep competition
or "free enterprise," along with
democracy.
Debate helpful
We should debate with each other
and other countries about how to
improve our political/economic sys
tems, instead of quietly preparing to
kill each other. Of course, the U.S.
should set some example of pacifism
to reassure the Soviets.
Recognizing the threat that the
Soviet Union still represents, we
could still keep up our military
capabilities, but we shouldn't in
crease them; we could cut our milit
ary budget by putting absolute
maximum pricetags on our military
purchases to encourage more effi
ciency and less profiteering in the
military industries.
Also, many Americans are coming
to see the benefits of the communal,
self-sufficient lifestyle. This is a
highly ecological lifestyle, as con
sumption is reduced through having
all things in common. What is
economics when everyone has
enough to eat and wear, a place to
live, a means of transportation, and
something to do?
We could all have such pleasant
lifestyles if we wanted to. Communal
living provides more social cohesion
and less loneliness while at the same
time being self-sufficient and so
more secure.
Priority on energy
Developing safe, clean alternative
energy sources should have a high
defense priority, for we would not
want to get drawn into a war merely
to safeguard our Middle East oil sup
ply. Encouragement of alternative
energy development could have a
major stabilizing effect on the world,
according to Amory Lovins in "Soft
Energy Paths."
Alternative energy sources are
economical right now, especially
passive solar design, solar hot water,
solar steam-generated electricity,
conservation, wind and pedal-power
and trash combustion.
Further, discouragement of nuc
lear power could make the world
more secure through less traffic of
radioactive nuclear weapons mate
rial. Even if a terrorist group couldn't
make a bomb, they could threaten to
disperse highly radioactive material.
Once we and the Soviets can agree
on some form of arms freeze, no
first-use agreement, and arms reduc
tion, then we can start encouraging
the rest of the world to demilitarize
(while still providing security agree
ments to other countries if desired).
Instead of offering arms sales to get a
country on our side, we could offer
more technical assistance.

It would be nice if an American
ambassador would mention that
what both Karl Marx and Thomas Jef
ferson wanted to do was to help the
world, not start wars when the
people involved weren't educated
about politics and economics, and
try to get them to accept our
ideologies against their wills.
As Robert Hutchins, founderof the
Center for the Study of Democratic
Institutions, has said, "We have to
have a strong commitment to work
on transnational problems: health,
energy, food, pollution, poverty, the
atmosphere, the oceans, disarma
ment.
"We have to have a commitment to
work on these problems in ways
which announce our desire to solve
problems rather than advance our in
terests. We have to stop throwing
our weight around. We have to stop
talking about being the most power
ful nation on earth and start thinking
about the nurture of human life
everywhere."
Of course, charity begins at home,
and we must provide an example of
ecological practices before we can
get other countries to adopt such
methods.
