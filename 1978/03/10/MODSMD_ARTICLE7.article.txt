# Black discussion vital
## South Africa forum 
### 
Willetta Greene

I commend you on your objective
coverage of the forum on South Af
rica (Daily, March 7). The sampling of
statements printed reflected in part
the diverse spectrum of people for
divestiture/withdrawal. And yet, I
was disappointed by your failure to
include some of the comments made
by the Black Students' Union co
president, Keith Archuleta.
To be sure, the black representa
tives spoke towards the end of the
forum. However, I feel it is important
that the Stanford community is aware
of the opinions of the black com
munity.
Complex issues
The concern for U.S. political sub
version in Africa has been and con
tinues to be relevant among black
discussion. Both Osagyefo Nkruman
and Malcolm X appealed to all prog
ressive people to demand that the
United States terminate all interven
tion in Africa. In 19b4, the Student
National Coordinating Committee
wrote a national resolution demand
ing that the government get out of
South Africa (and Vietnam). Blacks
are especially sensitive to the racial
complexity of the economic tyranny
in South Africa.
It is essential that the black voice
be heard in this on-going con
troversy that confronts the Univer
sity, for at least the following
reasons:

—So that the Board of Trustees,
the administration, and the general
community realize and recognize
that we have and will continue to ad
vocate divestiture of Stanford money
from corporations involved in South
Africa as the least radical and ethical
policy the University could adopt.
—So that the consciousness of all
involved might be sensitive to the
strikingly ominous analogies bet
ween present black struggle in
Azania (South Africa), and present
Third World struggle against oppres
sion in this country. i
Hypocritical tendencies
Otherwise there is a tendency for
the hypocrisy towards black struggle
blatantly exhibited by the Board of
Trustees to be matched by the shal
low, Carter-like concern for human
rights "ovah they-ya."
The ruling society of this country
has historically oppressed and con
tinues to oppress minorities, particu
larly blacks, for the purpose of cheap
labor, in the interest of immense
economic gain, and by a claim of ra
cial and cultural superiority. The vis
ible presence of black students ac
tive here in the controversy over who
will determine our future here and in
Azania will serve to effectively re
mind us all of thecruel lessonsfound
in our American past.
