That's what Doug Gait, Finance Manager of the Phi Delt Fraternity said to
Mark Triska, the Stanford Community Representative for Northern
California Savings and Loan Association.
"Probably the biggest plus factor of a NCS savings account is the
Telephone Transfer Service, allowing our house to make the highest
interest rate possible up to the date at which we'll need our money
transferred to our checking account. It makes money for us and saves me
time. The Palo Alto branch office is one of the closest savings and loans
around, and its hours are great. It's also nice to have an on-campus
representative available, to help us set up further accounts and to fill me
in on the many different accounts and services that NCS has to offer our
house."
Remember, Mark is just a phone call away.
