### Joel Dickholtz 
About 250 people attended a rally in White Plaza
yesterday protesting the arrest of Anatoly Sharansky,
a Soviet Jew, which took place one year ago yester
day.
According to Hillel president Brian Rossman,
"Sharansky is the focus of the protest because his is a
very special case of persecution. He is charged with
treason, a crime which carries a possible penalty of
death. If this persecution continues, it will mean a
new wave of oppression in Russia."
The rally here was one of more than a hundred
similar rallies on college campuses across the nation
protesting Sharansky's arrest. Sharansky is a leader in
the Soviet Jewish movement for freer emigration.
The arrest was a breach of the Helsinki agreement
as well as Russia's own constitution, according to
Morey Schapira, a representative of the Bay Area
Council on Soviet Jewry.
"We have to let them know that we won't let them

do to Scharansky what South Africa did to Steve
Biko," Schapira said at the rally.
He said approximately 250 members of the Stan
ford faculty, including President Richard Lyman, have
signed a petition addressed to Brezhnev which called
for Sharansky's release.
While Schapira and others spoke, students signed
petitions, postcards, and wrote letters on paper
plates to Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, de
manding freedom for Sharansky. The plates were
symbolic of the hunger strike here and around the
nation, according to one student. She said more than
1000 signatures have been gathered here already.
The rally was sponsored by Stanford Committee for
Anatoly Sharansky and Hillel, and was endorsed by
ASSU Senate, Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion, Stanford Christian Fellowship, Conservative
Student Union, Asian American Student Association,
Half the Sky, Black Students Union, Alliance for Radi
cal Change and Israeli Students Organization.
