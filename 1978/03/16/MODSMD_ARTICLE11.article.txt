# Li'l Abners of America?
## Can't trust media image

When this coal strike fiasco settles
down the news media will have some
severe charges to answer to. Day
after day the public has been sub
jected to interviews with miners who
are inarticulate, violent, or in the
process of wiping the remnants of a
Miller Lite from their mouths. As a
result, the American public per
ceives the average coal miner as a
psychopathic Li'l Abner who enjoys
violating Dolly Parton posters and
creating public disturbances.

A recently televised interview with
a miner from a Southern Ohio local
illustrates my point:
"Excuse me, sir. What will you do if
the President orders you back to
work?"
"Me an Lou Bob Cutler are gonna
go to Washington and do some strip
minin' on his face."
"And what if the President issues
an injunction?"
"I don't care what he smells like."
Then, usually, the coal miner
being interviewed proceeds to set
fire to a copy of the proposed con
tract while holding it in his teeth.
Now I won't deny that most of
these men are tough. Let's face it,
mining's hard, hazardous work. You
spend 20 years under the hills of Ap
palachia and you don't come out act
ing like Nureyev.
Don't count on media
But the news media alone cannot
be trusted to present an accurate pic
ture of this crisis. To understand
their plight, one must get to know
the miners firsthand through field
observation and lengthy interviews.
And since there's a mining town
close to my home in Ohio, I've de
cided to file this report.
The tough nature of the miners in
volves more than their work in the
coal fields. To ensure survival, these
men even marry tough. A common
sight in a mining town is the miner's
wife, who with one arm is breastfeed
ing her child and with the other arm
is building a barn. And often, while
being fed, the child is busy changing
the tire on his father's pick-up truck.
Soot High's problems
The lack of proper schooling is a
lingering problem in the mining
community. Because of discipline
problems in most schools, the only
teachers qualified for such work are

those who spent D-day on the beach
at Normandy. Unfortunately, these
teachers are hard to come by and asa
result, classes are extremely over
crowded.
One class I attended at Soot High
School in CreatCroin, West Virginia,
had 83 children in attendance. This
huge class enrollment stifled clas
sroom discussion, but playtime out
side was productive because enough
children were present for the teacher
to recreate the Crimean War.
There is very little to do in coal
towns and miners, with all this free
time on their hands, have become a
bit stir crazy. Many, afraid that their
job skills are rusting, have taken up
their picks and headed for the
supermarket to mine bags of char
coal.
Tu-tu focus
Others have taken complete leave
of their senses. These are the violent
ones we see on television stopping a
non-union truck driver, coaxing him
out of the truck, then forcing him to
put on a tu-tu and dance to reggae
music. And as I've pointed out, these
are the activities focused upon by the
TV cameras.
I don't want to sound too sym
pathetic to the plight of the coal min
ers. As far as I'm concerned their in
considerate treatment of America
contradicts their confessions of pat
riotism. In fact, one might say to the
miners "America: Heat It or Leave
It."
However, let none come to any
conclusions about the coal miners
without making an examination of
their lives similar to the one I've at
tempted here. Only then can one
come to some objective conclusions
about this whole mess.
