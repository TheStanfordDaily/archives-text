Elitist column
I felt upset as I read Allan Chen's
column (Daily, March 8) for the first
time today. I mean, his writing is pre
cisely what he's dead against —
loaded with high-brow jargon, an at
tack or two drowned in a mass of
'intelligent' but essentially meaning
less phrases, obscure and finally im
potent. Allan Chen ABHORS elitism
yet he's holding forth in precisely
that fashion. And it's disgusting.
Now it's time for me to defend this
argument, I guess. Well, beginning
at the beginning, "you are a varied
and a diverse group" — Christ, if
we're varied, we're diverse and vice
versa! No need to roll out the 'varied
and diverse' stuff. Reading on we
bump up against "counter
productive or uncomforting trends
and practices."
Sure, these words mean some
thing, but wouldn't we get a better
feel for what his point is if he'd said
something like "narrowing, deaden
ing trends," etc. (he does later on,
but why wait?). Instead he counter
produces the effect of his argument
by anesthetizing us with "counter
productive."
Continuing (but this, 'I sense, is
getting long winded), he ladles out
muddy phrase after plastic sentence

to us, all in typical law school fash
ion, holding before us "the temper
of the time," philosophizing that
there is "nothing intrinsically wrong
with "etc.", and droning on about
"false demagogues" (seen one?
what's a true demagogue? — perhaps
he means the big boys in business
and politics, maybe Hitler, who
knows), "unquestioning accep
tance of the norm," "political una
wareness," and many others. Boring.
Lifeless. Out of touch. Elitist.
Check this one out. . . "Inactivity
Stifles Creativity." Sound like a neat
little equation? Kinda handy, right?
Well, who'd want to use it? An . . .
elitist. Of course, Chen didn't really
say that, though.
Instead his jargon goes like this:
"you will propagate and amplify the
patterns of prejudice and dogma that
society has conditioned in you so
that you remain its subjugate."
Which amounts to the same thing. It
is an elitist-styled statement, propa
gated and amplified by one.
Time to quit. Point is I think Chen
wrote an elitist article. And it was
godawfully boring too.
