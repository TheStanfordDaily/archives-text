# Feminists err by rejecting sex
## Playboy's promotion of sexuality defended 
### 
Karen Meengs

I am a member of the feminist
community at Stanford and I was far
from "nauseated" by Dave Ansley's
article (Daily, Feb. 21) or David Chen,
for that matter. (I hope the residents
of the Simone de Beauvoir House
don't think they speak for the entire
feminist community.)
I answered the ad, more to meet
Dave Chan than anything else. As a
subscriber to "Playboy" for years, I
think Chan has done some very
beautiful and artistic work. My inter
view was for half an hour and I stayed
an additional hour to talk.
We discussed the necessary libera
tion of men and women, sexual free
dom, obscenity rulings, education,
his life as a photographer and my
plans for a career in law. I found him
to be extremely liberated and sensi
tive. There was nothing in our con
versation to "outrage" any feminist.
There was much to applaud.
The interview itself consisted of a
few quick Polaroids and a lot of talk
ing. Tieger is 100 per cent wrong
when he states that the "photo
grapher" felt that women were no

thing but "sex objects." Chan didn't
care if women came in with DD
breasts, for the body was relatively
unimportant.
Physically, he was attracted to the
face, for there he finds the personal
ity is expressed. He said he was in
terested in the way my "eyes
danced" and the animation I used
when I talked. He hoped this would
come across on film. The face indi
cates the personality of an individual
and that's why he makes his career of
photographing people, not only
women and not only nudes.
Playboy was not looking for "sup
erficial specimens" but women of di
versity. The Big Ten "lay-out" con
sisted of a lab assistant, future
lawyer, pre-med, aspiring U.S. Sec
retary of Agriculture, hopeful
member of the U.S. Equestrian
Team, real estate agent, accountant,
reporter, clinical psychologist, in
terpreter and a writer. The majority
of the interview surrounded hob
bies, interests, and aspirations.
Hardly superficial.
In my case, he strongly advised

against doing a nude or semi-nude.
He felt the country was becoming
more conservative in its attitude to
ward nudity, and that in 10 or 20 years
from now, the photograph could
possibly keep me from becoming as
politically active as I would like to be.
Todd Tieger's article (Daily, Mar. 7)
is a perfect example of such a mis
guided attitude. Chan's advice was
hardly that of a man concerned only
with the "flesh-selling" business.
Chan's definition of today's liber
ated woman as one who is "having
fun and doing what she wants" was
no Playboy rationalization. The
women he photographs do just that.
Just as "Time" deals with current
events, "Sports Illustrated" covers
athletics, and "Rolling Stone"
writes about the music world,
"Playboy's" emphasis is placed on
something that affects everyone's
lives — sexuality. It is one of the only
magazines that champions sexual
freedom for men and women. It is
the first to insist on the female's as
well as the male's pleasure in sex. It
encourages total communication be

tween couples, and is constantly
shattering the myths behind orgasm.
"Playboy's" attitude toward sexuality
can help to alter a lot of male miscon
ceptions. Men (and women) are ex
posed to a liberating attitude that is
found in no other popular magazine
besides perhaps "Ms" (and the men
that need to be reached are not flip
ping through "Ms"). "Playboy" is not
sexist, it simply promotes sexuality.
As far as marketing is concerned,
sex sells objects — so does beauty,
children, old ladies, serious-minded
men, healthy-looking college stu
dents, celebrities . . . the list goes on
and on. I deplore as well as anyone
the use of a nude female to sell a
computer system, and Playboy
doesn't do that. There are no bottles
of scotch sitting between a woman's
opened legs.
Tieger's article comes across as
anti-sexuality. We must be careful
not to confuse liberation with sex,
for liberation is an attitude of the
mind. It would be absurd to reject all
that is sexual in the world. It would
be a rejection of one's self. As a
feminist, and a woman, I am deter
mined not to lose or ignore that as-

pect of my life.
Tieger is judging Playboy from a
purely superficial view. It seems he
has never gotten past the pictures
himself. A closer reading would dis
pel the "Playboy" stereotype he be
lieves exists.
As with the magazine, he objec
tifies David Chan (he is known only
as "the Playboy photographer").
Chan is not treated as a person, but
as an extension of "Playboy Inc."
The Daily and Dave Ansley re
ported a newsworthy item. It de
mythicized the symbol of the infam
ous "Playboy photographer." As far
as his remarks concerning the Daily
as an "uninspired product" I think a
definite "cheap shot" should be cal
led.
Finally, I would be careful, Tieger
et al., who you call a "meat pro
duct." Over one hundred women at
Stanford interviewed, and I doubt
they would appreciate the classifica
tion. It's very dangerous when we
feminists, who for so long have been
judged unfairly, make the same rash
mistakes ourselves.

well as the male's pleasure in sex. It
encourages total communication be

tween couples, and is constantly
shattering the myths behind orgasm.
"Playboy's" attitude toward sexuality
can help to alter a lot of male miscon
ceptions. Men (and women) are ex
posed to a liberating attitude that is
found in no other popular magazine
besides perhaps "Ms" (and the men
that need to be reached are not flip
ping through "Ms"). "Playboy" is not
sexist, it simply promotes sexuality.
As far as marketing is concerned,
sex sells objects — so does beauty,
children, old ladies, serious-minded
men, healthy-looking college stu
dents, celebrities . . . the list goes on
and on. I deplore as well as anyone
the use of a nude female to sell a
computer system, and Playboy
doesn't do that. There are no bottles
of scotch sitting between a woman's
opened legs.
Tieger's article comes across as
anti-sexuality. We must be careful
not to confuse liberation with sex,
for liberation is an attitude of the
mind. It would be absurd to reject all
that is sexual in the world. It would
be a rejection of one's self. As a
feminist, and a woman, I am deter
mined not to lose or ignore that as-

pect of my life.
Tieger is judging Playboy from a
purely superficial view. It seems he
has never gotten past the pictures
himself. A closer reading would dis
pel the "Playboy" stereotype he be
lieves exists.
As with the magazine, he objec
tifies David Chan (he is known only
as "the Playboy photographer").
Chan is not treated as a person, but
as an extension of "Playboy Inc."
The Daily and Dave Ansley re
ported a newsworthy item. It de
mythicized the symbol of the infam
ous "Playboy photographer." As far
as his remarks concerning the Daily
as an "uninspired product" I think a
definite "cheap shot" should be cal
led.
Finally, I would be careful, Tieger
et al., who you call a "meat pro
duct." Over one hundred women at
Stanford interviewed, and I doubt
they would appreciate the classifica
tion. It's very dangerous when we
feminists, who for so long have been
judged unfairly, make the same rash
mistakes ourselves.

I am a member of the feminist
community at Stanford and I was far
from "nauseated" by Dave Ansley's
article (Daily, Feb. 21) or David Chen,
for that matter. (I hope the residents
of the Simone de Beauvoir House
don't think they speak for the entire
feminist community.)
I answered the ad, more to meet
Dave Chan than anything else. As a
subscriber to "Playboy" for years, I
think Chan has done some very
beautiful and artistic work. My inter
view was for half an hour and I stayed
an additional hour to talk.
We discussed the necessary libera
tion of men and women, sexual free
dom, obscenity rulings, education,
his life as a photographer and my
plans for a career in law. I found him
to be extremely liberated and sensi
tive. There was nothing in our con
versation to "outrage" any feminist.
There was much to applaud.
The interview itself consisted of a
few quick Polaroids and a lot of talk
ing. Tieger is 100 per cent wrong
when he states that the "photo
grapher" felt that women were no

thing but "sex objects." Chan didn't
care if women came in with DD
breasts, for the body was relatively
unimportant.
Physically, he was attracted to the
face, for there he finds the personal
ity is expressed. He said he was in
terested in the way my "eyes
danced" and the animation I used
when I talked. He hoped this would
come across on film. The face indi
cates the personality of an individual
and that's why he makes his career of
photographing people, not only
women and not only nudes.
Playboy was not looking for "sup
erficial specimens" but women of di
versity. The Big Ten "lay-out" con
sisted of a lab assistant, future
lawyer, pre-med, aspiring U.S. Sec
retary of Agriculture, hopeful
member of the U.S. Equestrian
Team, real estate agent, accountant,
reporter, clinical psychologist, in
terpreter and a writer. The majority
of the interview surrounded hob
bies, interests, and aspirations.
Hardly superficial.
In my case, he strongly advised

against doing a nude or semi-nude.
He felt the country was becoming
more conservative in its attitude to
ward nudity, and that in 10 or 20 years
from now, the photograph could
possibly keep me from becoming as
politically active as I would like to be.
Todd Tieger's article (Daily, Mar. 7)
is a perfect example of such a mis
guided attitude. Chan's advice was
hardly that of a man concerned only
with the "flesh-selling" business.
Chan's definition of today's liber
ated woman as one who is "having
fun and doing what she wants" was
no Playboy rationalization. The
women he photographs do just that.
Just as "Time" deals with current
events, "Sports Illustrated" covers
athletics, and "Rolling Stone"
writes about the music world,
"Playboy's" emphasis is placed on
something that affects everyone's
lives — sexuality. It is one of the only

versation to "outrage" any feminist.
There was much to applaud.
The interview itself consisted of a
few quick Polaroids and a lot of talk
ing. Tieger is 100 per cent wrong
when he states that the "photo
grapher" felt that women were no

thing but "sex objects." Chan didn't
care if women came in with DD
breasts, for the body was relatively
unimportant.
Physically, he was attracted to the
face, for there he finds the personal
ity is expressed. He said he was in
terested in the way my "eyes
danced" and the animation I used
when I talked. He hoped this would
come across on film. The face indi
cates the personality of an individual
and that's why he makes his career of
photographing people, not only
women and not only nudes.
Playboy was not looking for "sup
erficial specimens" but women of di
versity. The Big Ten "lay-out" con
sisted of a lab assistant, future
lawyer, pre-med, aspiring U.S. Sec
retary of Agriculture, hopeful
member of the U.S. Equestrian
Team, real estate agent, accountant,
reporter, clinical psychologist, in
terpreter and a writer. The majority
of the interview surrounded hob
bies, interests, and aspirations.
Hardly superficial.
In my case, he strongly advised

against doing a nude or semi-nude.
He felt the country was becoming
more conservative in its attitude to
ward nudity, and that in 10 or 20 years
from now, the photograph could
possibly keep me from becoming as
politically active as I would like to be.
Todd Tieger's article (Daily, Mar. 7)
is a perfect example of such a mis
guided attitude. Chan's advice was
hardly that of a man concerned only
with the "flesh-selling" business.
Chan's definition of today's liber
ated woman as one who is "having
fun and doing what she wants" was
no Playboy rationalization. The
women he photographs do just that.
Just as "Time" deals with current
events, "Sports Illustrated" covers
athletics, and "Rolling Stone"
writes about the music world,
"Playboy's" emphasis is placed on
something that affects everyone's
lives — sexuality. It is one of the only
magazines that champions sexual
freedom for men and women. It is
the first to insist on the female's as
well as the male's pleasure in sex. It
encourages total communication be

tween couples, and is constantly
shattering the myths behind orgasm.
"Playboy's" attitude toward sexuality
can help to alter a lot of male miscon
ceptions. Men (and women) are ex
posed to a liberating attitude that is
found in no other popular magazine
besides perhaps "Ms" (and the men
that need to be reached are not flip
ping through "Ms"). "Playboy" is not
sexist, it simply promotes sexuality.
As far as marketing is concerned,
sex sells objects — so does beauty,
children, old ladies, serious-minded
men, healthy-looking college stu
dents, celebrities . . . the list goes on
and on. I deplore as well as anyone
the use of a nude female to sell a
computer system, and Playboy
doesn't do that. There are no bottles
of scotch sitting between a woman's
opened legs.
Tieger's article comes across as
anti-sexuality. We must be careful
not to confuse liberation with sex,
for liberation is an attitude of the
mind. It would be absurd to reject all
that is sexual in the world. It would
be a rejection of one's self. As a
feminist, and a woman, I am deter
mined not to lose or ignore that as-

pect of my life.
Tieger is judging Playboy from a
purely superficial view. It seems he
has never gotten past the pictures
himself. A closer reading would dis
pel the "Playboy" stereotype he be
lieves exists.
As with the magazine, he objec
tifies David Chan (he is known only
as "the Playboy photographer").
Chan is not treated as a person, but
as an extension of "Playboy Inc."
The Daily and Dave Ansley re
ported a newsworthy item. It de
mythicized the symbol of the infam
ous "Playboy photographer." As far
as his remarks concerning the Daily
as an "uninspired product" I think a
definite "cheap shot" should be cal
led.
Finally, I would be careful, Tieger
et al., who you call a "meat pro
duct." Over one hundred women at
Stanford interviewed, and I doubt
they would appreciate the classifica
tion. It's very dangerous when we
feminists, who for so long have been
judged unfairly, make the same rash
mistakes ourselves.
