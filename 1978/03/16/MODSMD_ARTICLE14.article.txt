# Nonsmokers ailing unjustly

David Sartoris, in his column,
"Wrong Means to a Right End,"
(Daily, Mar. 2), comments that ". . .
the extent to which cigarette smoke
contributes to air pollution is mini
mal when compared to such felons
as industry and the automobile.
Likewise, no controlled study has yet
demonstrated that non-smokers
who are in frequent contact with
cigarette smoke have a higher inci
dence of heart or lung disease."
While it is true that no controlled
studies about the damage caused by
sidestream smoke have been con
ducted, it should be remembered
that science and medicine often take
stands on issues such as the benefi
cial or harmful properties of a drug
on the basis not of controlled studies

but of a significant accumulation of
evidence gathered in other ways.
Much evidence of the damage
caused by sidestream smoke has ac
cumulated. Eye, throat, and lung irri
tation resulting from "passive smok
ing" are obvious to everyone. A
study by two English doctors re
vealed that most non-smokers have
measurable amounts of nicotine in
their body fluids.
Two researchers at Texas A&M
University proved that in a poorly
ventilated room smoke significantly
increases the heart rate, blood pres
sure, and carbon monoxide blood
level of nonsmokers.
Lastly, the statement that
nonsmokers may actually be ex
posed to higher concentrations of

poisonous compounds than are
found in the filtered smoke inhaled
by smokers is subscribed to by the
American Lung Association, the
American Cancer Society, and the
American Heart Society.
Sidestream smoke from the burn
ing end of a cigarette, cigar, or pipe
exposes a nonsmoker to twice the tar
and nicotine, three times the ben
zopyrene, five times the carbon
monoxide, and 50 times the am
monia inhaled by the smoker.
Clearly, the issue of freedom of
choice discussed in David Sartoris'
article is further complicated by the
nonsmoker's right to choose not to
smoke.
