# Poisoned pot killing smokers

This time the government has
gone too far. Since 1975, the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration
has been providing Mexico with
paraquat, a highly poisonous her
bicide, so that Mexico may spray its
own marijuana fields. The estimated
cost of this program to U.S. taxpayers
is $40 million.
Paraquat reacts with sunlight when
sprayed on plants and in a couple of
days, the plant begins to wither. But
the Mexicans have found that if they
harvest the affected plants im
mediately, they can still be sold. The
poison, however, remains on the
leaves, with the result being the im
portation of contaminated plants
into the U.S.
Those who smoke the poisoned
grass risk permanent and irreparable
lung damage. For heavy and regular
smokers, damage is fairly certain, but
even lighter smokers risk health
problems.
The problem is serious enough for
HEW's Joseph Califano to have is
sued a health warning over the
weekend, warning against smoking
Mexican pot that may well be
poisoned. The situation puts the
government in a rather strange posi
tion. Not only does it have to warn
users of an illegal substance that the
substance might be poisoned, it has
to admit it is responsible for the
poisoning. Lung damage, then, can
be traced directly to the U.S. gov
ernment.
That's not all. Despite the known
health dangers, the Mexican gov
ernment is still spraying marijuana
fields with U.S. supplied paraquat.
It's interesting how the govern
ment finds itself in such a predica

merit. You would think that after
years of failure to stop the illegal use
of drugs in this country, law en
forcement officials and legislators
would finally realize it just can't be
done.
Marijuana is certainly no worse
than alcohol, a socially accepted
drug. You would think instead legis
lators would move toward de
criminalization and eventual legali
zation, in order to give police more
time to deal with violent crime.
Indeed, the time of nationwide
decriminalization is approaching,
but you can't help but wonder about
government motives. It seems the
police have the time now, not to de
vote to violent crime or crime against
property, but to stopping drug traf
ficking.
Stopping the trafficking, however,
is not easy. Last year, the U.S. Cus
toms Service, the Coast Cuard and
the Drug Enforcement Administra
tion, with the help of local lawmen,
seized 1.4 million pounds of
marijuana in the southeast. An esti
mated 10 times that much got
through.
Apparently the only thing left to do
is to attack the source: the growers.
The government tried to buy off the
Turks from growing poppies a few
years back, but that didn't work. No
reason to believe that approach
would work with the Mexicans
either. The next thing to do is kill the
plants. No plants, no trafficking. That
hasn't worked either. Marijuana still
comes in from Mexico, only now, it's
poisoned marijuana.
Perhaps some people see the
poisoning as ultimately solving the
whole problem. Poison the pot

smokers and they'll think twice be
fore they do any more illegal drugs.
That is, if they can still breathe.
Poison them enough and they won't
be able to smoke anything.
The issue here is not legality. The
very fact that the government issued
a health warning concerningthe con
taminated grass points to the wide
spread use of pot in this country.
Rather, the issue is ethics. Poison
ing marijuana is an extreme step no
matter how you look at it. The gov
ernment may claim it meant only for
the paraquat to poison the plants,
not U.S. citizens who may have come
into contact with what was supposed
to have been discarded. That's im
material. The government is ulti
mately responsible for every case of
lung damage as a result of its
marijuana-spraying program.
I suppose we should be grateful
forCalifano's health warning, butthe
warning alone is not enough. The
government should immediately
stop the supply of paraquat and
other dangerous chemicals to
Mexico.
It should set up test centers so
users can be sure of whether or not
they have been smoking contami
nated marijuana.
As a final demonstration of con
cern, the government should
apologize for the stupid and poorly
thought-out step it has made. Admis
sion of wrong-doing is not enough.
The next step is humility, followed by
an attempt at making amends for the
damage done.
