# Task force submits Western Culture report to C-US, seeks input
## 
### 
Following Is the final report of the task force on the
Western culture requirement, given to the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies Wednesday, March 8. The CUS
has received but not yet reviewed the report. It would
welcome any comments from the community. These
should be sent to CUS, c/o Undergraduate Dean's Of
fice, Building 1. Task force members are Andy Brown,
Nanneri Keohane, John Perry, Ronald Rebholz (chair
person), Jon Reider, and Paul Seaver. Brown replaced
Ernest Gundling as a student member of the task force
in September.
On Dec. 2, 1976, the Academic Senate passed a
resolution directing the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies to propose to the Senate, by the end of the academic
year 1977-78, a curricular requirement in the study of
Western culture to be satisfied in a limited number of
precisely defined ways, each of which had an historical
dimension.
In turn the Committee on Undergraduate Studies (CUS)
appointed our task force on Jan. 12, 1977, and charged it
with making recommendations to it consonant with the
Senate resolution. I also appointed, on Jan. 26, 1977, a panel
of advisors to the task force.
We have met regularly over the last 14 months as a task
force. We have had many conversations with other persons
and groups. We have met with President Lyman, Provost
Miller, and Director ot Development Smith, and the
Academic Senate of 1977-78.
We have met three times with the Advisory Panel and
four times with the CUS; held three meetings in student
residences and two open forums, and conducted survey of
all the faculty who teach undergraduates We have issued
four statements to the community, in May, October, and
November of 1977 (the latter beinp our preliminary report to
the Committee on Undergraduate Studies), and January of
1978. This is our fifth statement and our final report to the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies.

I. The Study of Western Culture In » Stanford Un
dergraduate Education
In attempting to define the purposes of a requirement in
Western culture, the task force has repeatedly had to
confront a larger question: the overall structure of a Stanford
undergraduate education.
We believe strongly that the University needs to commit
itself to a clearer conception of the importance of several
fundamental skills and kinds of knowledge in a liberal
education. We do not think ourselves particularly well
qualified to articulate that conception; nor was it our charge
to do so
We therefore urge that the faculty give serious thought to
the issue and that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, with
appropriate consultation, prepare a statement that
describes the skills and knowledge any Stanford graduate
should have acquired, and convey that statement to
departments, faculty, students, and advisors as a guide to
the planning ot course offerings and stjdents' programs.
We know it will take time to prepare such an important
statement But without some sense of the purposes of a
good undegraduate education we find it difficult to explain
the reasons for studying Western culture as a part ol such
an education So we begin with a brief account of our views
of the general purposes of a liberal education, provisional
but sufficient, we believe, to justify the inclusion of the study
of Western culture, along with other equally desirable forms
of learning.
The primary purpose of an undergraduate education is to
provide men and women with skills and knowledge that will
enable them to continue to educate themselves and others
throughout their adult lives.
To this end it is important to understand how to gain
knowledge about ourselves, our societies, the natural world,
and the environments created by our cultures and
technologies Such methodological skills and substantive
knowledge are the necessary means both to understanding
and to solving, so far as we are able, the problems we face in
our individual lives, in our roles as citizens of particular
societies, and as members of the human race
Among the skills crucial to education as the activity of a
lifetime is the ability to use both verbal and mathematical
languages —and the more of them the better
Continuing education also depends on an acquaintance
with a variety of "languages" in the broadest sense: modes
of creative human expression, ideas of how to explore and
experiment, images and categories for understanding
Languages of both kinds enable us to learn how many
questions can be asked, and how many ways can be
suggested for providing answers—one of the primary
liberating experiences of a liberal education.
The disciplinary skills of the natural scientists, social
scientists, and humanists cannot all be acquired during an
undergraduate education Indeed, we cannot hope to
achieve more than an introduction to a handful of these
disciplines in a lifetime
But while we cannot expect all educated men and women
to conduct experiments in physics or generate new
arguments in philosophy, we should all be equipped to un
derstand the results of such work when the physicists or the
philosophers communicate their findings to us. Without such
minimal skills that permit us to understand and appreciate
the work of others, we can neither function responsibly as
citizens nor participate actively in our culture We should
emerge from a university prepared both to scrutinize our
values and to understand their relation to individual and
social action.
Majoring in a certain field also makes an important
contribution to education as the activity of a lifetime. It
should give us the sense of realization that comes when we
can use both a body of knowledge and a mastery of relevant
techniques to produce something at once new and useful A
major concentration in a field may lead to gainful em
ployment, but that consequence is not essential to its value
We think that the study of Western culture, systematic
and sustained, should be an essential part of the kind of
education we have been describing A knowledge of some of
the great works of the West, their makers, contexts, and
temporal relationship—inevitably selective but selected with
an eye to the excellence and importance of the
achievements —yields several kinds of awareness, which
are themselves skills of a sort, although unlike those
produced by the established disciplines or fields of study
Western culture, like all cultures, consists of individual
and social activities and products, transmitted and modified
from generation to generation We think of Western culture
as originating in the Near East, Greece, and Rome,
developing in diverse ways in Europe and North America,
and gradually influencing and being influenced by cultures in
virtually all other parts of the world
Western culture is a congeries of interrelated cultures,
some of which have disappeared, some of which continue
into the present, but all of which have elements in common,
especially when contrasted with other major cultures or
cultural groupings.
A knowledge of some of the institutions, ideas, and
values of the West that have continued with great force into
the present gives us a conscious awareness of how our
conceptions of the individual and society have been
inherited A knowledge of some aspects of the culture that
have been submerged gives us an awareness of the lost
human possibilities, the ambiguities, and the tragedies that
have accompanied the West's historical development.
We need to be aware of the origin of our individual and
social identities for, as Sir Thomas North said, "That man
who knows not whence he comes knows not who he is." But
we also need the sense of ethical, social, and political
alternatives that the historical persective on a complex
culture provides.
Western culture has become part of the heritage of all of
us at this University. It is not just the heritage ol those who
happen to have been raised in Europe or America or belong
to some contemporary class, group, or nation Therefore a
systematic study of it benefits all of us.

For those who think of themselves as primarily
"Western," it provides not only an awareness of the roots of
individual and social identities and of alternatives to those
identities, but also a more sophisticated vantage point from
which to learn about other cultures
For those who are "non-Western" or think of themselves
as crossing over such categories, the study of Western
culture provides a perspective on a culture that is different
or somewhat different from their own but has been in
creasingly important in affecting the development ot other
cultures in recent centuries.
For all of us, even an introduction to the earlier stages ol
Western culture gives us an often jolting perspective on the
odd continuities and discontinuities of past and present.
Ideas expressed in ancient Greece and medieval Europe are
sources ol contemporary culture but are also profoundly
unlike our own ideas The study of Western culture multiplies
perspectives, surely one of the major purposes of a liberal
education.
Finally, we think that the study of a non-Western Culture
should be a part of a good undergrduate education. It
clarifies what is distinctively Western about this culture,
places Western culture in a perspective that underscores its
achievements and limitations, and offers alternative ways ol
interpreting human experience and defining what is valuable
in it. Like the study of Western culture, it increases per
spectives and thereby liberates us from intellectuals and
temporal provincialisms.
11. Undergraduate education at Stanford
We think that what we have described as a good un
dergraduate education is available at Stantord, that many
students receive part of it, but that many students do not
receive some crucial parts of it.
There are several reasons for the weaknesses of un
dergraduate education here, especially in those areas of
general education outside the major:
* The advising system is inadequate
* The required courses in freshman English have varying
degrees of success in ensuring that students read and write
English. They are mainly taught by graduate students with
busy lives and little teaching experience
* The distribution requirements are imprecise in their
demands, they can be satisfied and contribute little or
nothing to breadth in education.
* Students not majoring in the natural sciences take too
lew courses in them. (Prof. David Abernethy, associate dean
of undergraduate studies, has generated figures showing
that humanities majors take humanities and natural sciences
courses in the ratio of 7.5 to 1 Natural sciences majors take
natural sciences and humanities courses in the ratio of 2.28
to 1.)
The only courses of which we are aware that approach
the kind of study ol Western culture we propose are the
program in Structured Liberal Education (SLE), the
Humanities 61, 62, 63 sequence, and History 1,2,3.
SLE is inevitably small because residentially based.
Enlarging the Humanities sequence would intensify its
difficulties in staffing; and, in any event, it is not designed to
place the works studied in their political, social, and
economic contexts The history sequence only treats Europe
since 1500.
The weaknesses in general education at Stanford are
primarily institutional. The strength of Stanford lies in its
departments, and that strength accounts for the fine
education students generally receive in their majors.
It also accounts for the fragmentation, accentuated by
division into schools, and for the departmental competition
for students and faculty billets that have precluded the
creation ol any sense ol a "college" within the University
that might improve general education.
The faculty, valuing the work they do in their specialties
and rewarded for it by promotion and raises in salary, are
reluctant to assume a major responsibility lor the general
education of students who are not committed to the (acuity's
specialties as undergraduate majors or graduate students
It is more difficult to raise funds for the general education
of undergraduates than, for example, the professional
schools Finally, we lack, as a University, that conception of
the purposes of undergraduate education discussed in
Section I.
Perhaps good general education for most of our students
is an institutional impossibility at Stanford Certainly it will
take unusual cooperation among departments and members
of the faculty—a collegial effort—to create an excellent
prog,am for the study of Western culture And while the
latter would solve only a small part of the problem, it is a
challenge to the pessimistic assumption that a good general
education is impossible here —a challenge which we hope
will be embraced with enthusiasm by students, faculty, and
administrators alike.
111. Reasons for requiring the study of Western
culture
We believe we have stated the major reasons for
studying Western culture in our discussion ol its crucial role
in a good undergradute education But the members of the
task force no longer share the enthusiasm for requiring the
study of Western culture that we shared as recently as early
November of 1977.
You will recall Irom our earlier reports to the University
community and to the CUS that we had reached a consensus
about the best way to satisfy the requirement—a study of
the the same works by all students in small seminars.
Once the financial and pedagogical objections to that
model became clear to us, as they did in meetings with the
Provost and President in November and in the Academic
Senate in early December, we lost our consensus about the
requirement.
Some members of the task force had been willing to
subordinate their distaste for requirements as a method lor
achieving rational curricula to what they perceived as a
brilliant opportunity—an opportunity to introduce into un
dergraduate education at Stanford a combination of deep
coherence and a mode of instruction which, supplemented
by lectures, would involve the minds of our students in an
active, transdisciplinary discourse of that opportunity has
grown dim, some ol our members have expressed in
creasing doubts about the proposed requirement.
Three positions on the requirement itself have been
expressed in our meetings
I)Some who doubt the wisdom of the requirement
reason as follows If the University cannot agree on a
general conception—however partial and limited such a
conception may inevitably be—of what it believes the
Western culture to be that all undergraduates ought to be
aware of, then it has no business institutionalizing its lack of
agreement and conviction in a requirement
If the University community believes that no single year
long course of 15 units can offer more than one among
equally valid and valuable angles of vision on our culture,
then we might do better to develop as coherent a set of such
courses as possible, admit that no single course should or
could fulfill our ideal, and urge all undergraduates to take as
many of the proffered courses as time and inclination permit.
Otherwise the Western culture requirement becomes
simply a rather specialized version of the former humanities
sequence requirement. If the courses are good and the
advisors are given a sense of the "college's" objectives,
many students will take the courses without a requirement. If
the courses are not good, they should not be required
2) Others with doubts about the requirement fear that, if
several courses are offered as ways of satisfying the
requirement, large numbers of students will take lecture
courses where the primary exposure will be to a given
lecturer's high-level synthesis of the works studied rather
than to the works themselves And they believe that students
are sufficiently, perhaps excessively exposed to this method
of learning without further reinforcing it with a requirement.

3) Finally, those who strongly favor the requirement
believe that the evidence available indicates that many
students, for a variety of reasons, are not inclined to choose
courses that offer something approaching a systematic
study of Western culture even though they may later regret
that they did not do so
The advising'system is only partially at fault here High
tuition and the understandable fear of not finding interesting
and well paid jobs after graduation encourage a narrowing
preprofessional tendency among some students Other
students think they have more pressing academic interests
For whatever reasons, SLE and Humanities 61, 62, 63
together enroll up to 350 students a year, and not all the
students complete the sequences Even if the enrollment ot
up to 350 a year in History 1, 2, 3 is added—and, as we have
already said, this course seems to lack the temporal
coverage necessary for a study of Western culture —no
more than 700 students a year, or slightly less than hall the
freshman class, currently take a course that might be
defended as appropriate
Since these members of the task force regard the study
of Western culture as essential to a good undergraduate
educalion, they think it worth requiring, to ensure that all
students participate in it. They argue that this is one of those
instances in which educators are justitied in making
decisions about what constitutes a good education and
expecting that all who come to them to be educated will
profit from their judgment According to their line of
reasoning, the argument for a requirement of the systematic
study of Western culture holds even if no single course can
be required of all students.
Some disagreement about the desirability of a
requirement as such, therefore, has been part ot our
discussions ever since we began to take seriously the
possibility that a set of courses, instead of a single course,
might be offered to satisfy the requirement.
The agreement of all members ot the task force on the
recommendations at the end of this report is the result of the
willingness of those who have doubts about the requirement
to subordinate those doubts to a hope that the courses will
share the study of many of the same works and will achieve
the educational objectives the task lorce has embraced
even if they employ different pedagogical means
The agreement is also the result of our absolute
unanimity in the view that, if the courses are not excellent,
there should be no requirement
IV. Arguments for and against the single course
proposed by the task force
The task force, fairly early in our deliberations, arrived at
the view that the best way to satisfy a requirement in the
study of Western culture would be by way of a single three
quarter course dealing with "great works," taught primarily
in small seminars by experienced teachers. (Campus
Report, Jan. 11,1978 and Stanford Daily Jan 13, 1978)
We continue to hold to this view, even though discussions
with others in the University, as well as the results of our
survey of (acuity opinion, have made us aware of the ad
vantages that might be expected from a model in which
students would choose from among a limited number of
courses. In this section of the report, we summarize the
arguments for and against the single course proposed by the
task force.
The primary advantage of a single course, whatever its
nature, is that it would provide a shared intellectual ex
perience for all participants. The discussion of common
material would bring new vitality to the intellectual life of
students.
Working with colleagues (rom other disciplines to design
and teach such a course would enrich the intellectual life of
the (acuity as well, Faculty could assume students'
knowledge of certain material and build on that knowledge in
subsequent courses. 40 5© of the faculty who respond to
our survey favor the institution of a single course (Response
4A.8, hereafter references to pertinent questions in the
survey will be made in the text. When interpreting the per
centages of "faculty respondents" cited in the text, the
reader must be aware that not all faculty who returned the
questionnaire responded to every question.)
The primary advantages of the course proposed by the
task force are threefold.
Students would study great works, usually in their en
tirety. (See #6 for the faculty's preference for the study of
great works, illuminated by the study of secondary texts,
rather than works of popular culture.)
Because of the instruction in small seminars, the
probability of students' becoming actively engaged with the
works would be greater than in a lecture course, even when
the latter is supplemented by well-taught sections
Because the seminars would often be taught by non
specialists, the (acuity would be encouraged 'o redevelop
the breadth o( knowledge and vision that frequently gets lost
in the process of disciplinary specialization, and that would
enrich the teaching of their specialties
We have been given some heart by the fact that 11.6% of
the faculty respondents would be interested in making this
course part of their regular teaching responsibilities, another
12 7% would participate occasionally, and 14 8%, though
opposed to the single required course, would participate
occasionally if it were instituted Another 14 8%, though not
willing to lead seminars, would be willing to give lectures in
their areas ot specialized knowledge at appropriate points in
the course (#l3)
The .major argument against requiring any single course
is that 40% of the faculty respondents prefer a choice from
options Our less formal soundings of the opinion ol students
do not. oddly, suggest that they place such a high priority on
choice, but our information there is uncertain duo the views
of the faculty carry great weight.
The major objection to the course favored by the task
force seems to be the emphasis we place on small seminars;
that objection in turn seems to depend on a desire tor in
struction by specialists, which can only be given in lectures
At least 62% of the faculty respondents think lectures
should be an important component of the course (though it is
interesting that the full professors are the main supporters of
this view) and 55% favor choice from options because it
enables them to teach in areas closer to their specialities
(See #5 and 15H )
It would also be difficult to organize 80 seminars for 1,600
students each quarter, though only 30.2% ol the faculty
respondents see agreeing on the works to be taught each
year as a major problem (# 14c).
Without the spur of competition, a single course might
tpecome inert and unimaginative, although that never
seemed to be a problem with the history ol Western
civilization course where the difficulty was, rather, how to
limit and control experimentation.
Finally, without a strong base in departments and the
collegial spirit lor which we have been arguing, the
organizers of such a course might find it hard to obtain good
teachers. But already 30 regular members of the faculty,
including four department chairpersons and three
distinguished emeriti, have expressed a strong interest in
teaching the course, and that list includes four winners of
Dinkelspiel or Gores Awards for teacning.
V. Arguments for and against choice from among a
number of courses
The primary advantage of allowing choice from among a
number of courses is that it would be possible to present a
variety of perspectives on Western culture according to the
different abilities, specialized interests, and prelerences of
faculty members, and possible for students to select courses
that suit their own interests.
Having a variety of courses in competition lor students
and tor approval as ways of satisfying the requirement might
encourage innovation and help maintain high standards.
Furthermore, some nudging of the (acuity out of their im
mediate specialities in the direction ot general education
might occur if (acuity cooperated across disciplinary

boundaries in designing courses.
An overwhelming 76.8% of the faculty respondents think
such courses should be multidisciplinary in approach (15g)
There is no obvious preference for departmentally based
courses and competition among departments for approval
and students (#lsi).
The major argument against choice, from our per
spective, is precisely the loss of the common intellectual
experience that we value so highly and the almost inevitable
tendency for the several courses to be lecture courses,
especially since a major reason for preferring multiple
courses is to enable faculty to teach in areas close to their
specialty.
Furthermore, it would be difficult to determine, and even
more difficult to apply systematically, criteria for selection
from among different courses offered to satisfy the
requirement The task of a supervisory group under this
system would not be an enviable one. Unless some fairly
arbitrary upper limit were set on the number of courses,
there would be a danger of an unlimited proliferation like that
which plagued and ruined the humanities sequences.
One of the most striking results of the questionnaire is
that 71.6% of the faculty respondents who favor choice from
among several courses would limit the number to five (# 15a).
VI. General conclusions of the task force
Although the difficulties of financing our proposed course
probably occur to anyone who contemplates it, we think the
main objections to it rest on grounds of content and
pedagogy
Some members of the task force have begun to lean
toward the view that a small number of sequences of
courses of equal excellence, approaching Western culture
from a variety of perspectives, might strengthen the
requirement But we are not yet convinced that the energy
and creativity necessary to organize and sustain such
courses would be forthcoming on the part of the required
number of faculty.
In order to test this possibility, at the same time as we
test the feasibility of our proposed course, we think that
different three-quarter courses should be tried out during the
next two years.
But be believe that the following stringent criteria ought
to be applied to those courses before they are even ten
tatively approved as ways of satisfying the requirement:
A. They must include the study of a considerable
number of primary works.
B. They must deal with more than one national and
linguistic subculture; tor example, a course treating only
Britain and the U.S.A. would not quality.
C. They must cover at least three out of four temporal
periods—ancient, medieval, early modern, and modern.
D. They must not approach Western culture through
courses designed to introduce students to a single
discipline, or courses in which a single discipline
determines the presentation of the material. This
criterion does not mean that faculty from more than one
department would have to be involved in the course for It
to qualify, although it would probably be a rare instance
in which faculty from a single department could develop
an appropriate course.
E. If lectures are at the heart of the course, the
course must also involve instruction in small groups for
a minimum of two hours each week.
F. Those small groups must not exceed 20 students
with primary works.
H. Each regular member of the faculty involved in the
course must teach one of the small groups during at
least one quarter of the sequence.
I. Small groups not taught by regular members of the
faculty must be taught by an instructor with a Ph.D. and
with proven ability as a teacher.
J. The courses should share as many works as
possible with the works taught in the course proposed
by the task force.
We want to underscore the importance of criteria E,F, H,
and I. 33.7% of the faculty respondents who favor lecture
courses think that a good deal of time should be spent in
small seminar groups led by instructors with the Ph.D.,
rather than by TAs Couple that figure with the 14.2% who
favor seminars led by experienced teachers and you have a
mandate from virtually half the faculty for excellent in
struction at every level of the course, (see #5).
Criterion G enunciates our conviction that the
educational purpose of this requirement cannot be ac
complished unless the students go beyond the passive
encountering of works and being told by lecturers what they
mean. The shocks of recognition and surprise that generate
new perspectives can only occur when the encounter
between students and the works is made active by involved
discussion as well as lectures.
Criterion J is designed to salvage as much common
intellectual experience as possible from a pluralistic model.
It is intended to encourage a cross-fertilization of the lists of
works, not the dominance of the task force's list except at an
early stage when the latter might serve as a focus for
discussing works, not the dominance of the task force's list
except at an early stage when the latter might serve as a
focus for discussing works to be included in the syllabi.
A few existing courses could perhaps be modified to
satisfy the criteria:
1) SLE, with a list of works that has as much as possible
in common with the course proposed by the task force, and
also bridges temporal gaps with lectures and other in
struments used in the task force's proposed course;
2) Humanities 61, 62, 63, again with as many works as
possible shared with the course we propose, more attention
to their political, social, and economic contexts, and sec
tions taught by regular members of the faculty or Ph.D.s;
3) Perhaps History 1, 2, 3, with temporal coverage ex
tended and no single disciplinary approach determining the
presentation of the material.
Other courses have been suggested by some members
of the faculty. Among these, two proposals have elicited
particular interest in the community, and have been
presented to us in considerable detail and with sustained
advocacy.
One of these courses has been proposed by Profs.
Abernethy, Duus, Kennedy, and Wirth. It deals with many of
the same works as the course proposed by the task force,
but organizes them thematically.
This course also pays special attention to the history of
science, and to the relation between the West and the non-
West. (In its earlier version, which required a fourth quarter
of study of a non-Western culture, this proposal received
most support in the comments in the questionnaires. Now
only occasional comparisons with non-Western culture are
incorporated into the course.)
The other course has been proposed by faculty
associated with the program in Values, Technology and
Society.
We think it would be valuable for both these courses to be
developed in experimental programs during the next two
years, so that the approaches and the emphases they
represent can be tested at the same time as the course
proposed by the task force and modified versions of existing
courses We also hope that other courses meeting the
criteria will be developed in what could be an extraordinary
period of innovation at Stanford.
VII. Particular recommendations of the task force
1. An experimental version of the course favored by
the task force should be offered In 1976 79 and 1979-80.
In the first year approximately 75-100 students should be
invited to volunteer to take the course. In the second year a
larger number should be invited, the number to be deter
mined by the Committee described in Recommendation 8
(hereafter "The Committee") in consultation with the
teachers in the course, but probably about 250.
2. The other courses described In Section VI above or
offered ae ways of satisfying the requirement In accord
with the criteria stated In that section should also be
offered In experimental versions, If possible In 1978-79
but In 1979-80 If they cannot be organized by next year.
The number of students in each course should again be
determined by the Committee in consultation with the
teachers.
3. The requirement In the etudy of Western culture
should be Instituted In 1980-81. In the late winter or early
spring of 1979-80, the Committee should make a preliminary
evaluation of the courses that have been proposed to satisfy
the requirement and report to the Academic Senate which
courses should satisfy the requirement In 1980-81. It should
see to the publication of a description of the requirement and
the courses satisfying it in Course* and Degreaa and
Approaching Stanford for 1980-81.
4. The number of courses approved might range from
one to alx but should not exceed six.
5. Students with superior preparation may petition to
offer an alternative program for satisfying the
requirement. The Committee should consider and, when
appropriate, grant such petitions.
8. Students should satisfy the requirement as early
as poeslble In their college careers, preferably In their
first year. But students In highly structured programs
should be sllowed a good deal of flexibility In choosing
the time at which they satisfy the requirement.
7. The requirement should be Instituted in 1980-81 on
an experimental baals for three years. Throughout that
three-year period the Committee should continue to evaluate

the courses. It should disqualify any course that is not ex
cellent.
At the end of the three-year experimental period, the
Committee should conduct an evaluation that includes a
survey of the seniors whose retrospective views of the value
of the courses will then be available If, at any time during or
after the three-year experimental period, the Committee
determines that the institution of the requirement is un
feasible or unsatisfactory, it should reopen the entire issue
of the requirement with the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies and the Academic Senate
8. The courses offered to satisfy the requirement should
be organized primarily by those teaching them. But the
courses should be administered by a Committee on the
Western Culture Requirement appointed by the dean of
humanities and sciences in consultation with the dean of
undergraduate studies.
9. The Committee on the Western Culture
Requirement should have the following responsibilities.
A. It should ensure that courses proposed lor the
satisfaction ot the requirement meet the criteria defined
In Section VI above.
B. It should assist, when necessary, the organization
and continuation of the courses by recruiting depart
ments and regular members of the faculty to participate
in the courses.
C. It should have appropriate budgetary support
provided by the provost as a result of consultation with
the dean of humanities and sciences and the Com
mittee.
8. The courses offered to satisfy the requirement
should be organized primarily by those teaching them.
But the courses should be administered by a Committee on
the Western Culture Requirement appointed by the dean of
humanities and sciences in consultation with the dean of
undergraduate studies.

9. Tha Commlttaa on the Waatarn Culture
Requirement ahould have the following reaponeibllitles.
A. It should ensure that courses proposed for the
satisfaction of the requirement meet the criteria defined
In Section VI above.
B. It should assist, when necessary, the organization
and continuation of the courses by recruiting depart
ments and regular members of the faculty to participate
in the courses.
C. It should have appropriate budgetary support
provided by the provost as a result of consultation with
the dean of humanities and sciences and the Com
mittee.
D. It should evaluate the quality of the courses at the
times and in the ways specified in Recommendations 3
and 7. In doing so it should recruit the services of faculty
other than those teaching the courses who can offer
informed and relatively objective evaluations. It should
also employ the University's mechanisms for evaluation
of teachers.
E. It should invite and assist in the development of
new courses if it thinks such action warranted.
F. It should make any recommendations for changes
in policy about the requirement to the Academic Senate
through the Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
9. The study of Western culture should not satisfy
the distribution requirements. The courses in Western
culture we propose transcend particular disciplines and are
therefore inappropriate as ways of satisfying distribution
requirements, the purpose of which, in our view, is to in
troduce students to disciplinary skills or methods
Our last two recommendations are informal in character
because they are outside the limits of our charge. We
nevertheless make them to the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies after considerable discussion and with
great seriousness.

(1) We reiterate our recommendation in Section I that
the dean ol undergraduate studies should prepare, with
appropriate consultation, a statement about he pur
poses of undergradaute education at Stanford.
Such a statement, accepted and promulgated by the
University community, might promote many of the goals
which led the Academic Senate to call for the proposal of a
curricular requirement in Western culture. If such a
statement could be included in the edition of Approaching
Stanford intended for freshmen entering in 1979-80, it might
be possible to gauge the impact of advice on the students'
interest in the kinds of courses designed to satisfy the
requirement. To have such an effect the statement should go
beyond abstract and general terms to include a checklist of
criteria that will assist students in constructing their
academic programs.
(2) We recommend that all undergraduates be
strongly urged to take at least one course, and
preferably a sequence of courses, in a non- Western
culture, such as the sequence in East Asian Civilization.
Acknowledgements
The task force wish to thank all those people, both at
Stanford and at other universities and colleges, who have
helped us with their advice, criticism, and encouragement.
We wish to express our special gratitude to Prof. Richard
Brody of political science for his help in preparing the faculty
questionnaire and to the dean of undergraduate studies,
Herant Katchadourian, and Bill Washburn and Ruth Sloan of
his office for processing and setting out its results.
We owe our deepest thanks to the dean of humanities
and sciences, Halsey Royden, and to his associate dean, J.
Martin Evans, who attended most of our meetings and fed us
when we were hungry, sometimes with lunches, always with
their wise counsel; and to Sally Freelen and Maggie Heath of
their office, without whose administrative help and good
humor we would never have completed our task.
