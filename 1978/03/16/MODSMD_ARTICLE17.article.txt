# Here are samples from Western Culture survey based on one-third response
## 
### 
Following are excerpts from the Western culture task
force survey, based on responses from 199 of the 666
faculty In humanities and sciences, engineering, and
earth sciences who received questionannaires. Per
cents often do not total to 100 because some respon
dents chose more than one reply, others did not
respond, and responses totaling less than 5% have
been omitted by Campus Report. Copies of the complete
questionnaire, including data by school, professorial
rank, etc. are available at the Academic Secretary's
Office.
4. One of the general Issues discussed by the task
force Is the desirability of a common Intellectual ex
perience for all students vs. the attractions of choice
among courses. Which of the following statements
comes closest to expressing your own opinion?
a) I (avor requiring a single course in Western Culture for
all undergraduates, to promote common experience and
allow faculty to build on the material in teaching other
courses—3l.B%.
b) I ' favor instituting a single course, but allowing
students a good deal of flexibility in designing individual
programs or placing out of the course on examination —
8.7%.
c) I favor offering a set of options, so that students can
choose among a limited number of courses that fulfill the
requirement—4o 0%.
d) I do not think that this requirement is necessary—
6.2%.
5. Another general issue Is the comparative merit of
small seminars vs. large lectures as a way of teaching
courses In Western culture, wntcn of the following Is
closest to your own view?
a) Students should come to grips with the major issues
and themes of Western culture in seminar groups led by an
experienced teacher, even though that teacher cannot be a
specialist in all the material covered in the course—l 4 2%
b) Students should be introduced to Western culture by
the best lecturers the University can offer, with discussion
sections led by regular graduate teaching assistants —
28.4%.
c) Students should be introduced to Western culture in a
course or courses that include some lectures, but also a
good deal of lime spent in small seminar groups led by the
instructors with the Ph.D., rather than TAs —33.7%
d) Students should be able to choose either large lecture
courses or seminars as ways of satisfying the requirement—
18.4%.
6. "Western culture" Is itself a vague term, and
defining what It means for the purposes of this
requirement has given us some trouble. When you think
of a required course or courses In Western culture,
which of the following types of material do you expect
would be included? Check as many as you like.
a) "Great books," i.e.. classics in philosophy, literature,
history—lo.l %.
b) Secondary texts providing historical continuity and
contexts for the study of primary works —2.7%.
c) Documents of popular culture, or other primary
documents that are not normally considered "great
works" —.5%.
d) Works other than books that illustrate the develop
ment of Western culture, drawn from the arts, technology,
the history of science—3.2%.
Combinations:
a & b 10.6%
a&d 15.4%
a & b & c 24.5%
a&c & d 5.9%
a & b & c & d 18.6%
7. There Is of course a trade-off between the ad
vantages of "surveying" Western culture and learning
about It through deeper exposure to a few works of
periods. Which do you favor?
a) An intensive course in which students learn how to
approach and understand works in Western culture by
careful study of a few works or periods—2o.l %.
b) An extensive survey course that attempts to ensure
that students have enough broad knowledge of sequences of
events and ideas to build upon in later w0rk—40.7%.
c) A number of courses of both types so that students
may ch005e—34.9%.
8. Another issue Is the scope of Western culture
across traditional disciplines. Which view comes
closest to your own?
a) The subject matter of a course in Western culture
should be drawn largely from the humanities —10.3%.
b) A course in Western culture should include material in
the humanities and social sciences, but not attempt to deal
as thoroughly with natural sciences—l 6.4%.
c) A course in Western culture should include material
from the history of science and technology as well as from
humanities and social sciences—6B.7%.
d) In this day and age, a course in Western culture that
concentrates on the development of science and technology
is likely to be of greater value to our students than one
focussed primarily in the humanities —1.0%.
9. One criticism sometimes expressed about the
Idea of a Western culture requirement Is that it is
ethnocentric. Which of the following stances on this
Issue do you favor?
a) It is important for educated persons to be familiar with
their own culture before they attempt to understand another,
or can learn to appreciate and criticize their own; for most of
our students, Western culture is their "own" tradition —
22.8%.

b) "Western culture" is a broad term denoting a great
variety of historical and cultural periods, and is part of the
intellectual heritate of all Stanford students —24 4%.
c) The study of Western culture is important, but it
cannot be undertaken without some understanding of what it
is not, i.e. of the non-West; a course in Western culture
should include a good deal of material drawn from non-
Western cultures, and from the encounter of the West and
non-West—22.3%.
d) A requirement for the study of Western culture makes
more sense if the study of some non-Western culture is also
required of all students —16.6%.
Combinations:
a & b 3 6%
c& d 5.2%
10. Another point that has been made Is that If a
required course or courses in Western culture are added
to the curriculum, students In highly-structured majors
will find their opportunities for choices In their programs
further reduced. Which approach to this problem do you
favor?
a) Courses in Western culture should be designed to fill
existing distribution requirements in the humanities or the
social sciences, rather than becoming an added
requirement —27.3%.
b) Distribution requirements serve important purposes of
their own, and should not be affected by the Western culture
requirement—l7.o%.
c) If courses in Western culture are required, the whole

set of requirements should be reassessed to make sure if
works together in an educationally sound way—sl 0%.
Combinations:
a & c 4.1 %
11. There Is some controversy about when students
should take a course or courses In Western culture.
Which strikes you as preferable?
a) All students should meet the requirement as early as
possible in their college career—39.4%.
b) Most students should meet the requirement early in
their careers, but students in highly structured programs
should be allowed a good deal of flexibility about fitting it in—
39 9%.
c) All students should choose when they will take such
courses, since many will profit more as seniors than as
freshmen —19.7%.
12. One last general Issue is that of funding for the
course or courses. Which view of this Issue is closest to
your own.
a) Additional funding for the Western culture
requirement should be kept to a minimum. Departments
which participate should reallocate their own resources as
needed —39 6%.
b) In order to finance the course or courses institutes to
implement the Western culture requirement, funds should be
reallocated from departments and programs that do not
participate to those that do —9.1 %.

c) Although some reallocation within and among existing
departments and programs will be necessary, this should be
kept to a minimum The program should be financed mainly
through fund-raising and the allocation of funded im
provement monies over the next few years, even though this
will mean that other new programs will have to be modified
or forgone—4o.6%.
13. Which of these statements beet describes your
own attitude towards participating In this course?
a) I would be interested in taking an active part in
designing this course, and in teaching one or more of the
seminars as part of my regular teaching responsibilities—
11.6%.
b) I would be interested in teaching a seminar (and
perhaps giving lectures) in this course once in every three of
four years, but would not want to commit myself to regular
participation—l 2.7%.
c) I would be willing to lecture on my own area of
specialized knowledge at an appropriate point in the course
but would not want to lead a seminar—l 4 8%.
d) I am in favor of requiring a single course, but have
reservations about major aspects of this proposal; I would
like to participate in a general course in Western culture
organized along different lines —2.1 %.
e) I am composed to having a single required course, but
if one were instituted anyway, I might consider participating
occasionally—l4.B%.
112) It is unlikely that I would take part in a single required
course in Western culture under any circumstances —
35.4%.

Faculty views on course organization...
14 a) If this course is required, as many ot the
seminars as possible should be taught by regular
Stanford faculty
b) One of the advantages of this course is that it
would create instructorships for talented young Ph.Ds
in an era when jobs are scarge
c) A major problem with this course would be that
teaching personnel would never be able to agree on
the works to be taught each year.
d) Supplementary lectures designed to focus on
developments in science and the arts, and to provide
some historical continuity, are a desirable feature of
this proposal.
e) One of the advantages of this course is that it
would provide teaching opportunities for skilled
emeriti faculty.
112) I would not teach in such a course unless I were
assured that whatever course or courses I had to give
up to make room for it would be taught by someone
else
g) If a salary supplement were offered for
teaching one of these seminars in addition to my
regular teaching commitments, I would be more likely
to participate
h) If summer fellowship money were available to
help me prepare to teach this course, I would be more
likely to participate
i) If fellowship money to pursue my own research
were available as compensation for teaching a
seminar, I would be more likely to participate.
15. a) If students are given a choice among
several different ways of satisfying the requirement,
there should be a strictly limited number of alter
natives so that quality can be supervised; for
example, no more than five.
b) To avoid crowding the required courses, there
should be a moderate number of options, somewhere
between 6-12.
c) Students should have as much choice as
possible among courses that satisfy the requirement;
more than 12 would be preferable.
d) Courses selected to satisfy the requirement
should be drawn primarily from existing courses such
as History 1-2-3, Humanities 61-62-63, or SLE, with
opportunities for a small number of new courses to be
added in future.
e) Before the requirement is instituted, faculty
members should be encouraged to propose new
courses or modify existing courses to satisfy the
requirement and then submit them as candidates for
inclusion among the tracks.
112) A mejor problem with multiple tracks is that it
would be difficult for an overseeing committee to
ensure that all course-options maintained levels of
excellence that justified their inclusion.
g) Courses designed to satisfy this requirement
should be multidisciplinary in their approach,
preferably involving cooperation among the depart
ments, and in no case simply acting as an introduction
to a discipline.
h) The multiple tracks proposal allows- faculty to
teach courses closer to their own areas of
specialization, rather than requiring them to engage in
general education of undergraduates This is a
significant advantage.
i) The multiple tracks proposal would encourage
competition among departments in the designing of
courses. This is a significant advantage.
