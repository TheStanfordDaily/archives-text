# Insulation planned for campus houses

### Dean Eyre 
The Energy Conservation Center (ECC)
Housing Management Offfice and Resi
dences and Fraternities Management are
teaming up to initiate a quarter-million
square-foot insulation project next quar
ter.
"We're going to insulate most all of the
row houses that have attics — there's (sic)
only a few that don't, and we may get
around to insulating those," said Karl
Johnson, head of the ECC and coordinator
of the project.
"The combined area we're talking about
insulating is about 277,000 square feet. The
energy savings after insulating (the resi
dences) with Rl9 monotherm blown-in in
sulation would be 3.9 billion BTUs per
year," Johnson said.
One BTU is the equivalent of burning a
wooden match. The yearly savings in
terms of othef fuel sources would be 155
tons of coal or 680 barrels ot oil per year,
according to Johnson.
Johnson explained that dormitories paid

$3.25 per million BTUs under contract with
Pacific Gas and Electric.
"The overall cost of that (energy) now is
$12,250. We had a consultant report dur
ing the summer that estimated the cost for
insulating commercially at 28 cents per
square foot would be $76,631. Doing it
with student labor, buying our own
machine and getting the insulation would
cost us about $47,880," he said.
The consultant's estimates "are proba
bly a really low estimate because they're
based on energy coming from natural gas,
whereas in reality there are an awful lot of
electric heaters supplied by the university.
The cost for electric heating is about six to
seven times the cost for natural gas heat
ing," Johnson said.
The funding for residential insulation
will come from the Housing Management
Office, under the direction of Ed Scoles,
and the Residences and Fraternities divi
sion of student housing, managed by
Robert Ramirez.
Johnson predicted that the project will

take until the next heating season, which
starts next November. During the spring
quarter, four to six students will be hired
to work about ten hours per week, insulat
ing one row house each week. Summer
work on the project will offer work for 40
hours per week.
"The SWOPSI (17b) class led the way in
student labor by doing Phi Psi house and
Hammarskjold so successfully. The stu
dent (employment) seemed the most ap
pealing in all ways — you provide jobs on
campus, you are saving a tremendous
amount of energy, you have a very attrac
tive pay back period, so it's an ideal prog
ram — everyone benefits on campus,"
Johnson said.
"The real important thing to keep in
mind is that just insulating doesn't guaran
tee maximum results. The people in the
house have to help by controlling the
thermostat, so instead of opening the
windows when it gets hot, you turn the
thermostat down," he said.
