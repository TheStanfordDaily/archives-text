# University investigates land sale price
## 
### David Lampe 
The University is investigating
charges that it is selling its 694-acre
Black Mountain Ranch Property to
the Midpeninsula Regional Open
Space District at an improperly low
price.
Alumnus Harry Aine, a Palo Alto
attorney and a neighboring property
owner, alleged that the $475,000
($684 per acre) price agreed upon by
the district and Stanford amounts to
a "sweetheart deal."
"The 694 acres that are being
purchased by the Open Space Dis
trict join another 720 acres that sold
last year for $3500 per acre," Aine
said, "and I know that property val
ues have gone up significantly in the
past year."
The district purchased the higher
priced parcel from Alyce Burns and
Donald Eldridge for $2.1 million last
year. This is the property from which
residents of the counterculture set
tlement called The Land were evicted
last fall.
Aine was The Land's attorney.
No problems
Craig Britton, land negotiator for
the district, denied that the price dif
ference poses problems. The fair

market value is determined by a
number of factors including accessi
bility, availability of utilities, and the
cost of developing the property, he
said.
"The cost of developing the Stan
ford property is substantially
higher," he said. "If I were doing an
appraisal I would never compare
these two parcels of land."
If an appraisal were done, the dis
trict would be required to make an
offer not less than this fair market
value.
All parties agree, however, that
there have been no formal appraisals
of the property, although several es
timates have been made.
Legal disagreement
Aine claims that this violates land
acquisition regulations, but the dis
trict's legal advisers disagree.
"If a landowner comes to us, we'll
discuss the deal and we won't neces
sarily have an appraisal made," Brit
ton said. "We've talked with the state
on this matter and a transaction bet
ween two public bodies doesn't re
quire an appraisal."
The property in question is located
along Page Mill Road near Foothill
Park. It was donated to Stanford over

the period from 1961 to 1972 by Trus
tee Emeritus George Morell, a foun
der of the Palo Alto Times.
The land forms a link between two
parcels already owned by the district
which, when connected, will form a
continuous 6000 acre corridor of
open space spanning the area from
Saratoga Gap to Page Mill Road and
Foothill Park.
Aine is interested in the deal for
several reasons.
"I'm an alumnus of Stanford, I'm a
landowner here, I represented the
occupants of The Land for their relo
cation claims against the district, and
I saw how the district acted with the
occupants of The Land," he
explained.
The district has refused relocation
payments to the former Land resi
dents.
"I'm knowledgeable of the way the
district operates in the acquisition of
land up here," Aine said. "They're
not following the standard proce
dures."
Aine has sent copies of his com
plaints to the Board of Trustees. The
investigation will be done by William
Massy, vice president for business
and finance, who said earlier this

month that Stanford received fair
market value for the land.
George Burtness, assistant man
ager of land resources for Stanford,
said that this transaction with the
Open Space district has been under
consideration for three years.
"The land was given to Stanford to
be used as open space and for
academic purposes," he said. "We
tried to get academic departments
interested, but no one wanted to use
it."
He described the sale of the prop
erty to the district, where it will be
come public land, as a "no-lose situa
tion."
"We would have the money to use
for other purposes at the University,
and we would still have the use of the
land," he said.
The sale of the land will be final
when escrow closes on March 24.
Stanford has the option of withdraw
ing from the deal until that date.
Burtness said that Aine's charges
were "of sufficient quantity and
complexity that it is difficult to know
exactly what he is saying."
He said the resolution of this prob
lem will involve "lengthy discussions
with the city of Palo Alto."

past year."
The district purchased the higher
priced parcel from Alyce Burns and
Donald Eldridge for $2.1 million last
year. This is the property from which
residents of the counterculture set
tlement called The Land were evicted
last fall.
Aine was The Land's attorney.
No problems
Craig Britton, land negotiator for
the district, denied that the price dif
ference poses problems. The fair

market value is determined by a
number of factors including accessi
bility, availability of utilities, and the
cost of developing the property, he
said.
"The cost of developing the Stan
ford property is substantially
higher," he said. "If I were doing an
appraisal I would never compare
these two parcels of land."
If an appraisal were done, the dis
trict would be required to make an
offer not less than this fair market
value.
All parties agree, however, that
there have been no formal appraisals
of the property, although several es
timates have been made.
Legal disagreement
Aine claims that this violates land
acquisition regulations, but the dis
trict's legal advisers disagree.
"If a landowner comes to us, we'll
discuss the deal and we won't neces
sarily have an appraisal made," Brit
ton said. "We've talked with the state
on this matter and a transaction bet
ween two public bodies doesn't re
quire an appraisal."
The property in question is located
along Page Mill Road near Foothill
Park. It was donated to Stanford over

the period from 1961 to 1972 by Trus
tee Emeritus George Morell, a foun
der of the Palo Alto Times.
The land forms a link between two
parcels already owned by the district
which, when connected, will form a
continuous 6000 acre corridor of
open space spanning the area from
Saratoga Gap to Page Mill Road and
Foothill Park.
Aine is interested in the deal for
several reasons.
"I'm an alumnus of Stanford, I'm a
landowner here, I represented the
occupants of The Land for their relo
cation claims against the district, and
I saw how the district acted with the
occupants of The Land," he
explained.
The district has refused relocation
payments to the former Land resi
dents.
"I'm knowledgeable of the way the
district operates in the acquisition of
land up here," Aine said. "They're
not following the standard proce
dures."
Aine has sent copies of his com
plaints to the Board of Trustees. The
investigation will be done by William
Massy, vice president for business
and finance, who said earlier this

month that Stanford received fair
market value for the land.
George Burtness, assistant man
ager of land resources for Stanford,
said that this transaction with the
Open Space district has been under
consideration for three years.
"The land was given to Stanford to
be used as open space and for
academic purposes," he said. "We
tried to get academic departments
interested, but no one wanted to use
it."
He described the sale of the prop
erty to the district, where it will be
come public land, as a "no-lose situa
tion."
"We would have the money to use
for other purposes at the University,
and we would still have the use of the
land," he said.
The sale of the land will be final
when escrow closes on March 24.
Stanford has the option of withdraw
ing from the deal until that date.
Burtness said that Aine's charges
were "of sufficient quantity and
complexity that it is difficult to know
exactly what he is saying."
He said the resolution of this prob
lem will involve "lengthy discussions
with the city of Palo Alto."
The University is investigating
charges that it is selling its 694-acre
Black Mountain Ranch Property to
the Midpeninsula Regional Open
Space District at an improperly low
price.
Alumnus Harry Aine, a Palo Alto
attorney and a neighboring property
owner, alleged that the $475,000
($684 per acre) price agreed upon by
the district and Stanford amounts to
a "sweetheart deal."
"The 694 acres that are being
purchased by the Open Space Dis
trict join another 720 acres that sold
last year for $3500 per acre," Aine
said, "and I know that property val
ues have gone up significantly in the
past year."
