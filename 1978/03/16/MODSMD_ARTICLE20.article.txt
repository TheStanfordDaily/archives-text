# Streaking Cardinal nine head for Riverside tourney
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford varsity baseball
team continued playing over
dead-week taking advantage of
the good weather that has
been so scarce thus far in pre
season play. Counting their
ad-week victories, the
Lard's record now stands at
18-2-1, one of the best marks in
the Pacitic-8.
"We've done well overall,"
commented Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "We
haven't always played our best,
but we've still won and that's
encouaging. We've definitely
improved ... we play better
now than we did at the begin
ning of the season. But, we
have to continue improving
before league starts."
League play begins for the
Cardinal nine on April 7 — the
first weekend after spring
break -- when UCLA comes to
Stanford's Sunken Diamond
for a three-game series. Before
this, however, the Cardinals
will get some valuable playing
time during spring break at the
Riverside National Intercol
legiate Baseball Tournament
that runs from Mar. 27 to Apr.
1.
The team is looking forward
to the tournament where it will
play seven games in six days
against teams from all across
the nation. Attending this
year's tournament will be two
new teams: the University of
Maine, who two years ago
finished third in the College
World Series and last year did
almost as well, losing only in
their regional playoffs; and
Valdosta State from Valdosta,
Ceorgia, which went to the
College World Series last year
with an impressive 46-16 re
cord.
Washington State University,
the defending 1977 tourna
ment champion, will attempt

to retain its title, and Oregon
State will also attend. Califor
nia teams other than Stanford
include UC-Riverside, the
tournament runner up last
year and University of Califor
nia — one of Stanford's league
competitors in the Pac-8
Southern Division. The eighth
team in the tournament will be
Oral Roberts University.
Coach Marquess expects
good competition in the tour
nament from all teams in
volved. "We normally play very
well down there," he said,
"with the guys out of school
and relaxed The kids can con
centrate on baseball and get
some good work in," he con
cluded.
Probable starters for the
Riverside tourney are 6-foot-4,
200 lb. junior Brian Harrison
(3-0), lunior lefthander Rub
Irwin (3-0), Mark Abbondola
(4-1), who currently sports a
2.12 ERA, and sophomore
standout Larry Kuhn (2-0).
Bruce Fiala, who has a 3-0 re
cord but who has been work
ing primarily in relief out of the
bullpen, may get the nod in
one of the games as may
freshman Paul Crame. )oe
LoPresti, who's finished up
some important Stanford vic
tories lately, and Rick Hallsted
will provide relief for the Card
starters.
Stanford's latest victories in
cluded a weekend three-game
sweep of San Jose State. Friday
afternoon Harrison went
the distance for the Cards in
their 7-4 victory. Saturday the
Spartans virtually handed Stan
ford a 9-8 win in the 11th inning
of the first game when the San
Jose relief pitcher walked four
consecutive batters providing
the winning run.
Monday, the Cards defeated
the University of San Francisco
14-1 in a single contest at Sun
ken Diamond. Errors plagued

the Dons as Stanford de
molished them for the second
time this year. Stanford
opened their season with an
8-1 rout of the Dons on Feb
ruary 1. Junior ]ohn Pyle,
who sat out last year to play
spring football, was the star of
the show Monday, collecting
five RRI on two singles, a dou
ble and a triple as a designated
hitter.
Stanford s latest victim was
the Boise State Broncos who
were annihilated by the Cards
14-2 yesterday afternoon in
Sunken Diamond. Bruce Fiala
picked up the win backed by
the hot bats of Wong and Pyle
who each had solo homeruns
in the contest. Shortstop Dave
Perez also had a pood day at
the plate going th* !or-four
Today, the Cardinals take on
San Francisco State in a doub
leheader at Sunken Diamond
starting at noon. These two
games will be the last two
played before the Riverside
tournament.

Cardinal shortstop Paul /uvella turns over the double play against Pcpperdine. Zuvella an< hors a strong
Stanford defense that faces equally tough offenses in the Riverside tourney next week.
The Stanford varsity baseball
team continued playing over
dead-week taking advantage of
the good weather that has
been so scarce thus far in pre
season play. Counting their
ad-week victories, the
Lard's record now stands at
18-2-1, one of the best marks in
the Pacitic-8.
"We've done well overall,"
commented Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "We
haven't always played our best,
but we've still won and that's
encouaging. We've definitely
improved ... we play better
now than we did at the begin
ning of the season. But, we
have to continue improving
before league starts."
League play begins for the
Cardinal nine on April 7 — the
first weekend after spring
break -- when UCLA comes to
Stanford's Sunken Diamond
for a three-game series. Before
this, however, the Cardinals
will get some valuable playing
time during spring break at the
Riverside National Intercol
legiate Baseball Tournament
that runs from Mar. 27 to Apr.
1.
The team is looking forward
to the tournament where it will
play seven games in six days
against teams from all across
the nation. Attending this
year's tournament will be two
new teams: the University of
Maine, who two years ago
finished third in the College
World Series and last year did
almost as well, losing only in
their regional playoffs; and
Valdosta State from Valdosta,
Ceorgia, which went to the
College World Series last year
with an impressive 46-16 re
cord.
Washington State University,
the defending 1977 tourna
ment champion, will attempt

to retain its title, and Oregon
State will also attend. Califor
nia teams other than Stanford
include UC-Riverside, the
tournament runner up last
year and University of Califor
nia — one of Stanford's league
competitors in the Pac-8
Southern Division. The eighth
team in the tournament will be
Oral Roberts University.
Coach Marquess expects
good competition in the tour
nament from all teams in
volved. "We normally play very
well down there," he said,
"with the guys out of school
and relaxed The kids can con
centrate on baseball and get
some good work in," he con
cluded.
Probable starters for the
Riverside tourney are 6-foot-4,
200 lb. junior Brian Harrison
(3-0), lunior lefthander Rub
Irwin (3-0), Mark Abbondola
(4-1), who currently sports a
2.12 ERA, and sophomore
standout Larry Kuhn (2-0).
Bruce Fiala, who has a 3-0 re
cord but who has been work
ing primarily in relief out of the
bullpen, may get the nod in
one of the games as may
freshman Paul Crame. )oe
LoPresti, who's finished up
some important Stanford vic
tories lately, and Rick Hallsted
will provide relief for the Card
starters.
Stanford's latest victories in
cluded a weekend three-game
sweep of San Jose State. Friday
afternoon Harrison went
the distance for the Cards in
their 7-4 victory. Saturday the
Spartans virtually handed Stan
ford a 9-8 win in the 11th inning
of the first game when the San
Jose relief pitcher walked four
consecutive batters providing
the winning run.
Monday, the Cards defeated
the University of San Francisco
14-1 in a single contest at Sun
ken Diamond. Errors plagued

the Dons as Stanford de
molished them for the second
time this year. Stanford

commented Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "We
haven't always played our best,
but we've still won and that's
encouaging. We've definitely
improved ... we play better
now than we did at the begin
ning of the season. But, we
have to continue improving
before league starts."
League play begins for the
Cardinal nine on April 7 — the
first weekend after spring
break -- when UCLA comes to
Stanford's Sunken Diamond
for a three-game series. Before
this, however, the Cardinals
will get some valuable playing
time during spring break at the
Riverside National Intercol
legiate Baseball Tournament
that runs from Mar. 27 to Apr.
1.
The team is looking forward
to the tournament where it will
play seven games in six days
against teams from all across
the nation. Attending this
year's tournament will be two
new teams: the University of
Maine, who two years ago
finished third in the College
World Series and last year did
almost as well, losing only in
their regional playoffs; and
Valdosta State from Valdosta,
Ceorgia, which went to the
College World Series last year
with an impressive 46-16 re
cord.
Washington State University,
the defending 1977 tourna
ment champion, will attempt

to retain its title, and Oregon
State will also attend. Califor
nia teams other than Stanford
include UC-Riverside, the
tournament runner up last
year and University of Califor
nia — one of Stanford's league
competitors in the Pac-8
Southern Division. The eighth
team in the tournament will be
Oral Roberts University.
Coach Marquess expects
good competition in the tour
nament from all teams in
volved. "We normally play very
well down there," he said,
"with the guys out of school
and relaxed The kids can con
centrate on baseball and get
some good work in," he con
cluded.
Probable starters for the
Riverside tourney are 6-foot-4,
200 lb. junior Brian Harrison
(3-0), lunior lefthander Rub
Irwin (3-0), Mark Abbondola
(4-1), who currently sports a
2.12 ERA, and sophomore
standout Larry Kuhn (2-0).
Bruce Fiala, who has a 3-0 re
cord but who has been work
ing primarily in relief out of the
bullpen, may get the nod in
one of the games as may
freshman Paul Crame. )oe
LoPresti, who's finished up
some important Stanford vic
tories lately, and Rick Hallsted
will provide relief for the Card
starters.
Stanford's latest victories in
cluded a weekend three-game
sweep of San Jose State. Friday
afternoon Harrison went
the distance for the Cards in
their 7-4 victory. Saturday the
Spartans virtually handed Stan
ford a 9-8 win in the 11th inning
of the first game when the San
Jose relief pitcher walked four
consecutive batters providing
the winning run.
Monday, the Cards defeated
the University of San Francisco
14-1 in a single contest at Sun
ken Diamond. Errors plagued

the Dons as Stanford de
molished them for the second
time this year. Stanford
opened their season with an
8-1 rout of the Dons on Feb
ruary 1. Junior ]ohn Pyle,
who sat out last year to play
spring football, was the star of
the show Monday, collecting
five RRI on two singles, a dou
ble and a triple as a designated
hitter.
Stanford s latest victim was
the Boise State Broncos who
were annihilated by the Cards
14-2 yesterday afternoon in
Sunken Diamond. Bruce Fiala
picked up the win backed by
the hot bats of Wong and Pyle
who each had solo homeruns
in the contest. Shortstop Dave
Perez also had a pood day at
the plate going th* !or-four
Today, the Cardinals take on
San Francisco State in a doub
leheader at Sunken Diamond
starting at noon. These two
games will be the last two
played before the Riverside
tournament.
