# Netters keep rolling with romp over Yale

### Pete Snell 
In rain-shortened matches
Monday the Cardinal men's
and women's tennis teams de
feated Vale by the scores of 6-1
and 5-0, respectively.
The men's only loss came in
No. 3 doubles as Dave Becker
and Alan Blumberg were de
feated handily in straight sets.
The Cards were strong in sing
les play as five out of the six
matches were won in straight
sets.
Despite the rain, Stanford
coach Dick Gould was happy at
the outcome: "I'm really
pleased in our play today.
Yale's one of the top teams in
the East."
In the feature singles match
it took two time All-American
Bill Maze a little while to get
going before he defeated
Menlo Park's Matt Doyle 4-6,
7-5, 6-2. Of Maze's match,
Gould commented, "Bill was
tough when he needed to be
today. Matt is a tough player
and an outstanding athlete. Bill
competed well to beat him."
In the women's side of
things the Cards were obvi
ously superior as they didn't
lose a set in the matches copi
pleted Kathy Jordan and Susie
Hagey were especially tough in
the No. 1 and No. 2 singles.
Jordan defeated Sue Graham
6-2, 6-2 while Hagey rolled past
Natalya Smith, 6-3, 6-1. Wo
men's coach Anne Gould said,
"The ladies played very well.
Kathy continued her excellent
play. The woman she defeated
was a former high ranking
junior."
Both il men and the
women will have a break to do
some studying and take finals
before leaving as a group on
Mar. 27 for Texas. They will be
in Texas for a week, returning
to Stanford for spring quarter
and their regular season. On
Wednesday of spring break,
the Cards w ill be hosted by the
University of Texas-Austin in
the new 18,000-seat special

events center. There are two
indoor courts that will hold
simultaneous men's and wo
men's matches to entertain the
crowd.
The Cardinal men's team will
be putting its No. 1 ranking on
the line in this Texas swing. The
UT-Austin team is ranked No.')
in the country and the team
that hosts the Cards on Friday
and Saturday, Trinity, is ranked
No. 2. Trinity's women will
pose a problem for the Cardi
nal women also.
Both Trinity and Stanford are
among the top five teams in the
country. Trinity's men's team is
loaded with talented people
including Larry Gottfried,
brother of touring star Brian,
Erich Iskersky, Tony Giam
malva and Ben McKown. Trini
ty's women's team sports
freshman Anne Smith, one of
the top juniors in the world and
the No. 33 ranked woman in
the nation last year. Along with
Smith there is Sandy Stap, who
lost last year to Hagey in the
round of 16 in the NCAAs, Car
rie Fleming and Anne
Shroeder.
Although the format has not
been established yet, 'he
matches will be spread over
two days with regular nine
point matches for the men and
women and a combined match
score that will include mixed
doubles matches.
The Texas swing will be ex
cellent preparation for what
will be, for the men, their most
important matches to date;
those against UCLA and USC
down south on April 7 and 8.
The Cards have never won
both matches in Los Angeles
and they can expect equally
tough competition this time
around. UCLA is the No. 3 team
in the country and many feel
the Bruins have the best
chance of upsetting the Cards
for the NCAA team crown. USC
at home is always very tough.
The Trojans are ranked No. 10,
led by freshman Robert Van
t'hof.

Peter Rennert winds up to blast a serve to his Canada College oppo
nent. Rennert recently proved his prowess in another sport, basket
ball, by sinking a half-court swish at halftime of the Stanford-Oregon
State Jwsketball game.
In rain-shortened matches
Monday the Cardinal men's
and women's tennis teams de
feated Vale by the scores of 6-1
and 5-0, respectively.
The men's only loss came in
No. 3 doubles as Dave Becker
and Alan Blumberg were de
feated handily in straight sets.
The Cards were strong in sing
les play as five out of the six
matches were won in straight
sets.
Despite the rain, Stanford
coach Dick Gould was happy at
the outcome: "I'm really
pleased in our play today.
Yale's one of the top teams in
the East."
In the feature singles match
it took two time All-American
Bill Maze a little while to get
going before he defeated
Menlo Park's Matt Doyle 4-6,
7-5, 6-2. Of Maze's match,
Gould commented, "Bill was
tough when he needed to be
today. Matt is a tough player
and an outstanding athlete. Bill
competed well to beat him."
In the women's side of
things the Cards were obvi
ously superior as they didn't
lose a set in the matches copi
pleted Kathy Jordan and Susie
Hagey were especially tough in
the No. 1 and No. 2 singles.
Jordan defeated Sue Graham
6-2, 6-2 while Hagey rolled past
Natalya Smith, 6-3, 6-1. Wo
men's coach Anne Gould said,
"The ladies played very well.
Kathy continued her excellent
play. The woman she defeated
was a former high ranking
junior."
Both il men and the
women will have a break to do
some studying and take finals
before leaving as a group on
Mar. 27 for Texas. They will be
in Texas for a week, returning
to Stanford for spring quarter
and their regular season. On
Wednesday of spring break,
the Cards w ill be hosted by the
University of Texas-Austin in
the new 18,000-seat special

events center. There are two
indoor courts that will hold
simultaneous men's and wo
men's matches to entertain the
crowd.
The Cardinal men's team will
be putting its No. 1 ranking on
the line in this Texas swing. The
UT-Austin team is ranked No.')
in the country and the team
that hosts the Cards on Friday
and Saturday, Trinity, is ranked
No. 2. Trinity's women will
pose a problem for the Cardi
nal women also.
Both Trinity and Stanford are
among the top five teams in the
country. Trinity's men's team is
loaded with talented people
including Larry Gottfried,
brother of touring star Brian,
Erich Iskersky, Tony Giam
malva and Ben McKown. Trini
ty's women's team sports
freshman Anne Smith, one of
the top juniors in the world and
the No. 33 ranked woman in
the nation last year. Along with
Smith there is Sandy Stap, who
lost last year to Hagey in the
round of 16 in the NCAAs, Car
rie Fleming and Anne
Shroeder.
Although the format has not
been established yet, 'he
matches will be spread over
two days with regular nine
point matches for the men and
women and a combined match
score that will include mixed
doubles matches.
The Texas swing will be ex
cellent preparation for what
will be, for the men, their most
important matches to date;
those against UCLA and USC
down south on April 7 and 8.
The Cards have never won
both matches in Los Angeles
and they can expect equally
tough competition this time
around. UCLA is the No. 3 team
in the country and many feel
the Bruins have the best
chance of upsetting the Cards
for the NCAA team crown. USC
at home is always very tough.
The Trojans are ranked No. 10,
led by freshman Robert Van
t'hof.

Peter Rennert winds up to blast a serve to his Canada College oppo
nent. Rennert recently proved his prowess in another sport, basket
ball, by sinking a half-court swish at halftime of the Stanford-Oregon
State Jwsketball game.
In rain-shortened matches
Monday the Cardinal men's
and women's tennis teams de
feated Vale by the scores of 6-1
and 5-0, respectively.
The men's only loss came in
No. 3 doubles as Dave Becker
and Alan Blumberg were de
feated handily in straight sets.
The Cards were strong in sing
les play as five out of the six
matches were won in straight
sets.
Despite the rain, Stanford
coach Dick Gould was happy at
the outcome: "I'm really
pleased in our play today.
Yale's one of the top teams in
the East."
In the feature singles match
it took two time All-American
Bill Maze a little while to get
going before he defeated
Menlo Park's Matt Doyle 4-6,
7-5, 6-2. Of Maze's match,
Gould commented, "Bill was
tough when he needed to be
today. Matt is a tough player
and an outstanding athlete. Bill
competed well to beat him."
In the women's side of
things the Cards were obvi
ously superior as they didn't
lose a set in the matches copi
pleted Kathy Jordan and Susie
Hagey were especially tough in
the No. 1 and No. 2 singles.
Jordan defeated Sue Graham
6-2, 6-2 while Hagey rolled past
Natalya Smith, 6-3, 6-1. Wo
men's coach Anne Gould said,
"The ladies played very well.
Kathy continued her excellent
play. The woman she defeated
was a former high ranking
junior."
Both il men and the
women will have a break to do
some studying and take finals
before leaving as a group on
Mar. 27 for Texas. They will be
in Texas for a week, returning
to Stanford for spring quarter
and their regular season. On
Wednesday of spring break,
the Cards w ill be hosted by the
University of Texas-Austin in
the new 18,000-seat special

events center. There are two
indoor courts that will hold
simultaneous men's and wo
men's matches to entertain the
crowd.
The Cardinal men's team will
be putting its No. 1 ranking on
the line in this Texas swing. The
UT-Austin team is ranked No.')
in the country and the team
that hosts the Cards on Friday
and Saturday, Trinity, is ranked
No. 2. Trinity's women will
pose a problem for the Cardi
nal women also.
Both Trinity and Stanford are
among the top five teams in the
country. Trinity's men's team is
loaded with talented people
including Larry Gottfried,
brother of touring star Brian,
Erich Iskersky, Tony Giam
malva and Ben McKown. Trini
ty's women's team sports
freshman Anne Smith, one of
the top juniors in the world and
the No. 33 ranked woman in
the nation last year. Along with
Smith there is Sandy Stap, who
lost last year to Hagey in the
round of 16 in the NCAAs, Car
rie Fleming and Anne
Shroeder.
Although the format has not
been established yet, 'he
matches will be spread over
two days with regular nine
point matches for the men and
women and a combined match
score that will include mixed
doubles matches.
The Texas swing will be ex
cellent preparation for what
will be, for the men, their most
important matches to date;
those against UCLA and USC
down south on April 7 and 8.
The Cards have never won
both matches in Los Angeles
and they can expect equally
tough competition this time
around. UCLA is the No. 3 team
in the country and many feel
the Bruins have the best
chance of upsetting the Cards
for the NCAA team crown. USC
at home is always very tough.
The Trojans are ranked No. 10,
led by freshman Robert Van
t'hof.
