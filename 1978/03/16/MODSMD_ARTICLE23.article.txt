In the preliminary meet of the Region 8 Champ
ionships held last Friday afternoon in San Diego
State's Peterson Gym, Stanford's representa
tives had a mixed showing. Saundra Muramatsu
reinjured her knee during beam warm-ups and
was unable to compete while Dana Padden
scored an 8.35, placing 25th out of the 40 top
vaulters from California, Nevada, and Hawaii.
"I just feel badly that Sam (Muramatsu)
couldn't compete in post-season events in her
last year," said coach Jackie Walker.
Muramatsu, a senior in her first year of intercol
legiate competition, has been plagued by knee
and ankle injuries. Although passing the qualify
ing standards in all events during the regular
season, her career ended two meets before the
season ended.
Walker said, "Dana looked very good. It was
encouraging that she scored as well as she did
against that level of competition. The highest
vaulting score that they (the judges) gave was a

9.25 and that's for some girls who were doing
much more difficult 10.0 vaults.
"The best thing was it encouraged Dana to
realize that she would be right up there with
those girls with a little more work, ' Walker said.
San lose State, representing the Northern
California Athletic Conference in which Stan
ford competes, placed sixth. Spartan Kris
Klepfer earned seventh in all-around competi
tion and will probably "be going to nationals on
an at large bid," according to Walker.
Fullerton State, currently ranked No. 2 in the
nation, took team honors, followed by USC, San
Diego Sate, and UCLA. By winning the regional
team title, Fullerton qualifies for advancement
to nationals. "The other three are waiting to find
out if they get the at-large invitation â€” probably
USC will," Walker said. To qualify for nationals,
a team must score at least 134 points.
The AIAW National Championships will be
held in Seattle, Wash., Mar. 31-April 1.
