Hayward — The women's
soccer team split a pair of
games in its latest action, while
the lis, idle since being rained
out March 4, take on California
in tonight's rescheduled game.
The match is slated for 8 p.m. at
Berkeley.
The Cardinal women drop
ped their Thursday night game
against Berkeley, 4-3, but re
bounded on Saturday to beat
Hayward State, 3-2, bringing
their season record to 3-1.
The Bears took a 2-1 lead at
the half on goals by Debbie
Vance and Marilyn Newfield.
Stanford's tally came on a shot
by center forward Kris McGar
rey.
The second half opened with
a quick goal by Card Sonja
Schoeppel to tie the game at
two goals each. Berkeley came
back with two goals in the next
five minutes by Newfield and
Lisa Kreishoff. Stanford scored
once more on McGarrey's pen
alty shot with 31 minutes re
maining in the game.
Stanford head coach Phil
Wright felt that the Cards
"mechanical" style of play and
field size made the difference.

"There's no question that
the Astroturf hurt us because
we like to play a controlled
game. We've had to train our
selves to do that due to the size
of our field. We used to be a
more open-space type of team,
but because of our field, we
had to learn to keep to the
short passes," Wright said.
In the Hayward game,
McGarrey continued to pro
vide scoring for the Cards. She
gave Stanford a 1-0 lead near
the end of the first half, but Jan
Foster tied the game with four
minutes remaining. Another
second half burst led by
McGarrey gave the Cards the
lead until Colleen Calahan tied
it again. Then McGarrey added
the final tie breaker with 27 mi
nutes left in the game. She now
has 12 goals in four games.
Hayward, in its first season of
competition, is now 1-2-1.
While Wright was pleased
with all of his players, he cre
dited McGarrey with Satur
day's win. "She's just a pheno
menal forward — without her
today we would have lost.
"I've got the individual talent
and it's going to be up to me
and them together to put these
18 players into one team.'
