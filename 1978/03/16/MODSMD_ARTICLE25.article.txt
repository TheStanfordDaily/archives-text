# Swimmers aim for top ten finish
## 
### 
Junior Mike Bruner will lead
a corps of 15 Cardinal swim
mers at the NCAA champion
ships which begin next Thurs
day at Belmont Plaza in Long
Beach.
Fifteen swimmers is the
largest number of Stanford
swimmers that have qualified
for the national competition in
some time, according to coach
|im Gaughran, and that large
number may make a difference
in the final scoring.
"If we put everything to
gether." said Gaughran, "We
should be in the top ten na
tionally."
The Cards did not do as well
as they expeqted in the Pac-8s
on March 2-4, but Gaughran
said that since "about 10 of my
guys came down with the flu
while we were down there,"
that bad health might have had
an effect on their perfor
mances.
Hopefully healthier, the
Cards will show their full
strength in Long Beach against
the likes of such national pow
erhouses as USC, UCLA and
Arizona. Strong events for
Stanford could be the 200-yard
breaststroke and 200-yard but
terfly races, in each of which
Stanford qualified four swim
mers.
Brunner, said Gaughran, has
a good chance to keep his
NCAA title in the 200 butterfly
and may also score in the 200
and 400 freestyle events.

Sophomore Bob Hagberg,
who placed sixth at the NCAAs
last year in the 100 fly, will be
shaving down for the first time
this year in preparation for next
week's competition.
"If the kids come through
and score well," concluded
Gaughran, "we should do
well."
Women among top five
With a strong chance to re
peat last year's second place
finish and an opportunity to
challenge Arizona State for
first, the Stanford women's
swimming team begins com
petition today in the AIAW Na
tional Championships at
Durham, N.C.
"If everyone comes through
for us, we'll do very well," said
coach )im Gaughran. "Much of
our success will depend upon
the performance of our
freshmen — Kim Shettle, Zena
Herrmann, Lisa Mehoff, Nancy
Thompson and Sheri Bulrin
gham. Our top veterans,
headed by Valerie Lee and Kim
Peyton, have been swimming
excellently. Anne Brodell is
now swimming better than she
has in her entire life, which is
something for a senior."
Gaughran said the Cards,
who are ranked fifth in the na
tion, are particularly strong in
the freestyle events. Stanford
finished the season with a 7-1
dual meet record and a first
place in the Northern Califor
nia Athletic Conference.

who placed sixth at the NCAAs
last year in the 100 fly, will be
shaving down for the first time
this year in preparation for next
week's competition.
"If the kids come through
and score well," concluded
Gaughran, "we should do
well."
Women among top five
With a strong chance to re
peat last year's second place
finish and an opportunity to
challenge Arizona State for
first, the Stanford women's
swimming team begins com
petition today in the AIAW Na
tional Championships at
Durham, N.C.
"If everyone comes through
for us, we'll do very well," said
coach )im Gaughran. "Much of
our success will depend upon
the performance of our
freshmen — Kim Shettle, Zena
Herrmann, Lisa Mehoff, Nancy
Thompson and Sheri Bulrin
gham. Our top veterans,
headed by Valerie Lee and Kim
Peyton, have been swimming
excellently. Anne Brodell is
now swimming better than she
has in her entire life, which is
something for a senior."
Gaughran said the Cards,
who are ranked fifth in the na
tion, are particularly strong in
the freestyle events. Stanford
finished the season with a 7-1
dual meet record and a first
place in the Northern Califor
nia Athletic Conference.
