# 'C' soccer kings shock everyone

Only in the "C" League could a team clinch an IM title
after one victory in five league games.
Only in "C" soccer could an underdog team score its
crucial goal off the mispositioned calf of an opposing
fullback.
And only a "C" grade IM athlete could derive genuine
pride from the fingernail scars, the technical loopholes and
the sideline buffoonery which are kin to coed sports.
So went the happy thoughts of the new "C" Soccer
champs from 558 Mayfield as they meandered on back to
their shingled abode after Saturday's surprise victory over
Lathrop House.
"I don't know how we made it into the finals," said Bill
Broad, a forward and goalie for 558. "The only thing I can
think of is that we never forfeited a game."
"For the first two games, we didn't even score," added
Mari Yamashiro, a halfback.
"It's very strange," Broad continued. "For example, be
fore we played Synergy in league, the IM office had already
decided they would lose. But we played anyway, and lost "
Once the team had mysteriously appealed on the list of
playoff teams and edged its way through the first two
playoff games, Broad concluded, "At least we showed we
were capable of winning in the clutch."
To make the final round, 558 and Lathrop had to squeeze
by three other playoff teams which were equally puzzled as
to their slot in the tournament.
"The thing with Burbank," Broad said of the semifinalist
team, "is that they had only played one game — which they
lost — and their other three wins were forfeits."
Nevertheless, the "C" finals were just as serious as they
would have been had the Zetes and Theta Delts been faced
off in their final "A" league bout.
Paul Fisher, a three-year Lathrop resident and fullback for
the team, described the pre-game tension in his house.
"We were really getting hyped up," he said, "Whether it is
just fun or not, you make it to the playoffs and you want
everything to go right.
"We had our 558 'hate session' the night before — just
like in the pros," he added.
Lathrop, unlike 558, was counting on a victory based on
precedents. "We hadn't lost any games all season," Fisher
said.
So the final srorp, 7-1, r?m? as a bit of a shock, in light of
558's season performance. "In fact," Fisher said, "some
body said it was the worst team we played all season."
