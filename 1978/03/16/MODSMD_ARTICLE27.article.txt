# Women's hoop: a new approach
## 
### Sukie Jackson 
With recruitments and scho
larships as much a part of wo
men's basketball as the hoops
and backboards, Stanford is
experiencing a change from
women's sports "for fun" to
women's sports "to win."
The basketball program,
headed by Dottie McCrea and
assistant Sue Rojcewicz is on its
way to win. By improving last
year's 7-9 record to 17-12, the
Cards placed second in the
Northern California Athletic
Conference and participated in
the AIAW regional tourna
ment.
The Cards' losses include
three to regional champions
UCLA, two to winners of Nor
Cal: San jose State, and others
to Cal-Poly Pomona, Davis,
Berkeley, Fullerton State and
Santa Barbara. But McCrea felt
that the team played "above
their potential," and was
pleased to have her first win

ning season this year.
In Stanford's last game
against UCLA, McCrea started
three freshmen, one sopho
more and only one senior. The
young team "showed a lot
more poise and discipline" in
their third match-up with the
Bruins and although they lost
by 26 points, "playing in a reg
ional tournament is good ex
posure," McCrea added.
Much of Stanford's success
can be credited to the scholar
ships available to the women's
program and McCrea's re
cruits. Freshman Kathy Mur
phy, from Pittsburgh, Penn.,
was one of the first recruits to
benefit from the four scholar
ships available to the team.
Murphy was Stanford's second
leading scorer this season, av
eraging 15 points and ten re
bounds per game.
"This is the first year of the
teams' having people I brought
to the school," second year

coach McCrea commented,
"and this is my first winning
season." McCrea also brought
with her to Stanford a technical
knowledge of the game that
didn't exist in earlier years. As a
result of the coaches' influence
over the last two years, senior
Maggie Neslon commented,
"Now I feel like I know some
thing about basketball rather
than going on natural athletic
ability like the first years."
But for some players, win
ning isn't everything and sev
eral team members have doubts
about the new direction of the
basketball program. Francis
"Stumpy" O'Meara, who
played during her freshman,
sophomore and junior years,
quit the team in mid-season
because "basketball wasn't fun
anymore." Calling herself "the
last person to quit," O'Meara
couldn't justify the sometimes
four hours daily spent for the
little playing time she got. "I
didn't feel like I was making a
valuable contribuation to the
team." O'Meara compared the

new basketball program to a
machine. "You get quality,
quantity and efficiency but no
human touch," she said.
Laurie De'Armond,
freshman guard who had min
imal playing time this year, had
difficulties adjusting to college
competition. "It's so different
from high school," she said.
"Since it involves recruiting,
the main goal is to win and it
doesn't matter if you have
fun."
But if Stanford hopes to stay
competitive in future years, re
cruiting is a must. Already
McCrea has contacted several
top high school players around
the country and hopes they will
fill out her next year's squad.
Although Nelson "feels
good" about this season, she
too questions the "absurd
competitiveness," of women's
basketball. "I feel like I've ar
rived and left at a good point,"
she said. "I don't want wo
men's basketball to get more
competitive with the emphasis
on winning only."

With recruitments and scho
larships as much a part of wo
men's basketball as the hoops
and backboards, Stanford is
experiencing a change from
women's sports "for fun" to
women's sports "to win."
The basketball program,
headed by Dottie McCrea and
assistant Sue Rojcewicz is on its
way to win. By improving last
year's 7-9 record to 17-12, the
Cards placed second in the
Northern California Athletic
Conference and participated in
the AIAW regional tourna
ment.
The Cards' losses include
three to regional champions
UCLA, two to winners of Nor
Cal: San jose State, and others
to Cal-Poly Pomona, Davis,
Berkeley, Fullerton State and
Santa Barbara. But McCrea felt
that the team played "above
their potential," and was
pleased to have her first win

ning season this year.
In Stanford's last game
against UCLA, McCrea started
three freshmen, one sopho
more and only one senior. The
young team "showed a lot
more poise and discipline" in
their third match-up with the
Bruins and although they lost
by 26 points, "playing in a reg
ional tournament is good ex
posure," McCrea added.
Much of Stanford's success
can be credited to the scholar
ships available to the women's
program and McCrea's re
cruits. Freshman Kathy Mur
phy, from Pittsburgh, Penn.,
was one of the first recruits to
benefit from the four scholar
ships available to the team.
Murphy was Stanford's second
leading scorer this season, av
eraging 15 points and ten re
bounds per game.
"This is the first year of the
teams' having people I brought
to the school," second year

coach McCrea commented,
"and this is my first winning
season." McCrea also brought
with her to Stanford a technical
knowledge of the game that
didn't exist in earlier years. As a
result of the coaches' influence
over the last two years, senior
Maggie Neslon commented,
"Now I feel like I know some
thing about basketball rather
than going on natural athletic
ability like the first years."
But for some players, win
ning isn't everything and sev
eral team members have doubts
about the new direction of the
basketball program. Francis
"Stumpy" O'Meara, who
played during her freshman,
sophomore and junior years,
quit the team in mid-season
because "basketball wasn't fun
anymore." Calling herself "the
last person to quit," O'Meara
couldn't justify the sometimes
four hours daily spent for the
little playing time she got. "I
didn't feel like I was making a
valuable contribuation to the
team." O'Meara compared the

new basketball program to a
machine. "You get quality,
quantity and efficiency but no
human touch," she said.
Laurie De'Armond,
freshman guard who had min
imal playing time this year, had
difficulties adjusting to college
competition. "It's so different
from high school," she said.
"Since it involves recruiting,
the main goal is to win and it
doesn't matter if you have
fun."
But if Stanford hopes to stay
competitive in future years, re
cruiting is a must. Already
McCrea has contacted several
top high school players around
the country and hopes they will
fill out her next year's squad.
Although Nelson "feels
good" about this season, she
too questions the "absurd
competitiveness," of women's
basketball. "I feel like I've ar
rived and left at a good point,"
she said. "I don't want wo
men's basketball to get more
competitive with the emphasis
on winning only."
