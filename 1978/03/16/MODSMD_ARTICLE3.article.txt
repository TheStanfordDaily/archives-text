# Israeli force in Lebanon; wants guerrilla-free zone
## 
### 
Jerusalem (AP) â€” Israel said yester
day its land, sea and air forces had
completed the takeover of southern
Lebanon aimed at establishing a
guerrilla-free zone, and vowed to
hold the area until it has Arab guaran
tees the Palestinian commandos will
never return.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin
told a news conference here that the
army "was not sent into southern
Lebanon for the purpose of staying
there," and that Israel would seek
guarantees that "in all those places
. . . from which the murderers have
been ejected they should not re
turn."
Witnesses in Lebanon reported Is
raeli forces had routed Palestinians
from guerrilla strongholds in the
south and rocketed refugee camps as
far north as Beirut, killing Palesti
nians and Lebanese.
An Israeli military spokesman de
nied jets attacked civilians in refugee
camps. He said they hit "only military
targets of the terrorists." All aircraft
returned safely, he said.
Reports of civilian casualties
mounted into the scores. Palesti
nians claimed they had killed or
wounded 300 troops of the Israeli
task force, which the guerrillas esti
mated at more than 25,000 soldiers.
The Palestinians and their leftist
Lebanese allies are believed to have a
southern force of about 10,000 to
12,000 fighters.
A communique issued as columns
of troops and tanks plunged across
the border just after midnight Tues
day said the attack was not aimed at
"the Arab population, the Lebanese
army, or the inter-Arab peacekeep
ing force but only the terrorists and
their helpers."
It called the assault a "mopping-up

operation," not merely retaliation
for last Saturday's Palestinian ter
rorist attack in which 34 Israelis were
killed.
Israel gave no count of its own
casualties.
Palestinian guerrillas said they un
leashed a massive rocket retaliation
against the northern Israeli town of
Kiryat Shmona.
Israeli chief of staff Lt. Gen. Mor
dechai Gur said Israeli ground forces
had moved six miles inside Lebanon
along the 49-mile-long Israeli fron
tier. Gur said the operation was

aimed at creating a five-mile-deep
guerrilla-free zone along the border.
Begin did not say with whom Israel
hoped to reach agreement to keep
guerrillas away from the border, but
said he would not negotiate with the
Palestine Liberation Organization,
which claimed responsibility for the
attack Saturday on two buses along
the Tel Aviv-Haifa road. Nine of the
11 guerrillas involved were killed.
Begin, asked if the raid would
hamper peace talks, said that if
"Egypt seriously wants negotiations
. . . all the events of the past few days
will not present a serious obstacle."
