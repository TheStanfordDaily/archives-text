### Marcia Hadeler 
It was the Zetes against Loss Causation in
spirit and in play Monday night. Approximately
75 fans for each team were on hand.
Defeating the defending champions 33-25,
the Zetes did not have an easy win. First half
action was typified by patient play and many
missed shots, that led to a halftime score of
19-19.
Both teams played confidently — the play was
aggressive yet not intense. The fans were more
intense than the players.
Throughout the game the Zete fans could be
heard yelling to the opposition — "Co back to
the library" or at the refs — "Are all Zebras
blind?"
Loss Causation displayed their law terminol
ogy on one poster "Probate the Zetes."
In the second half, the pace quickened. The
Zetes' shots began to fall in and their big men,
Pat Bowe and John McCall, began out
positioning Loss Causations' bigger forwards to
assume control of the boards. This, coupled
with a few crucial turnovers, allowed the Zetes
to gr":in some breathing room that they main

tained throughout the hectic closing minutes of
the game.
