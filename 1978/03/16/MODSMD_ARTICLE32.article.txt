# $200,000 Tartan surface
## Cards unveil track 
### Bruce Anderson 
Fourteen universities take to
the track Saturday at Stanford
Stadium to inaugurate the
$200,000 Tartan surface just in
stalled in the stadium oval.
Finishing touches were
placed on the track early this
week — only hours before the
Marathon Engineering Corp.
of Redwood City, the firm that
installed the track, burned up
in a three-alarm blaze.
The Invitational's hot relay
field hopes to burn up the Tar
tan oval when the meet gets
underway at 11 a.m.
Several things enhance the
relay aspect of the meet this
year:
—the high school portion of
the meet has been eliminated;
—and the meet will be
scored for the first time, with
relays (scored 10-8-6-4-2) worth
twice as much as individual
events (scored 5-4-3-2-1).
"Our format emphasizes
team effort," Stanford coach
Payton Jordan said, "which can
be even more exciting than the
usual dual meet format. With
14 teams competing, there will
be some top matchups.
"The fact that the meet will

be scored this year will greatly
enhance the competition,"
Jordan added. "It should pro
duce some explosive marks
and maybe some stadium re
cords."
The meet will feature an invi
tational mile, as well as com
plete competition in the field
events and five open races.
Olympian Duncan Mac
donald, the only miler to ever
break the four-minute barrier
while at Stanford, and Mark
Schilling top the mile field.
Stanford, California and San
Jose State are the top three
teams in the invitational field.
The Cardinals, traditionally
handicapped by a lack of depth
in the field events, have corps
of talented runners this season
and should capitalize on a for
mat which stresses the relays.
But the Golden Bears and
Spartans will be betting their
stakes on the relays also.
California has 1976 NCAA in
termediate hurdles champion
Quentin Wheeler entered in
two relays and San Jose is keep
ing Dedy Cooper out of the
high hurdles but lias entered
him in three relays.
Stanford's 400-meter and

mile relay foursomes have got
ten a lot of buildup this year —
and rightly so, they may be the
best the Cards have ever had.
But two other Cardinal relay
quartets may account for much
of the fireworks Saturday.
Dave Wells, Paul McCarthy,
Mark Stillman and Tom Lob
singer will exchange the baton
in the distance medley relay,
while Mark Hadleywill pass the
stick with Wells, Stillman and
Lobsinger in the two-mile re
lay.
Oh, the track may not burn
up Saturday, but there are sure
to be some blazing races
scorching the crimson Tartan.
