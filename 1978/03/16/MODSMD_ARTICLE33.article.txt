Enjoying a two-game win
ning streak, the Stanford men's
volleyball team will meet three
opponents in three nights, be
ginning this evening with a
7:30 p.m. match against Chico
State in Maples Pavilion.
Then tomorrow night the
Cards venture south to take on
the Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
Mustangs before returning to
Maples for a 7:30 p.m. con

Humboldt State.
The Cards are 7-1 in the
Northern California Athletic
Conference, with the sole loss
having come against Cal a
couple of weeks ago in Ber
keley. Overall, Stanford is 7-5.

"I think we're coming right
along," said Card coach Art
Lambert. "The loss to Cal is the
only real blot on the record."
Stanford's other defeats
have come at the hands of
high-ranking UCLA, Pepper
dine and the Japanese Col
legiate All-Stars.
Last weekend, the Cards
won two games on the road.
Friday they downed Stanislaus
State, 15-5, 15-8, 10-15, 15-11.
Then Saturday the Cards

broke out fast against Fresno
State, but the potential rout
turned into a close win. The
Cards survived, 15-2,15-7,8-15,
9-15,15-5. "We didn't play par
ticularly well in that match,"
said Lambert.
Both victories were confer
ence triumphs.
"It's just our youth that
keeps usonthisrollercoaster,"
said Lambert. "But we have
shown improvement in our
consistency."
