Other standouts include
outfielder Mike Zboralske who
sports a .460 average after just
recently entering the lineup.
Pat Crow, a 6-foot-i 210 lb.
freshman from Stockton, leads
the team with four homeruns
with Don Erickson — who has
recently seen some Varsity ac
tion — is not far behind with
three.
Correction
In last Friday's Daily, Across
the Sports Desk mistakenly re
ferred to the Stanford badmin
ton team as the women's bad
minton team. In reality, it is a

coed team made up of 12 men
and 12 women.
Cards conclude perfect
season
The Stanford ice hockey
team culminated an unde
feated season last weekend
with a 7-5 victory over Mon
terey. Stanford finished with
an 11-0 record.
Despite missing four of its
five top scorers, Stanford led
throughout the hard-hitting
game. The line of player-coach
Pat Baldwin, John von
Schlegell and Murray Kinney
accounted for four Stanford
goals.
