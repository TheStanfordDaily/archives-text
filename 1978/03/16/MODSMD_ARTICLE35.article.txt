New contract may end miner's strike
Washington — The United Mine Workers' bargaining
council approved a new tentative contract last night and
sent it to the coalfields for miners to ratify and end their
100-day coal strike.
The vote was 22-17, according to a bargaining council
member. A union spokesman said he understood that
the ratification vote would be held on a single day, a
week from Friday.
Miller said he "just couldn't imagine the rank and file
turning it down this time."
The tentative contract, the third one between the
union and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association in
the prolonged strike, contains key industry concessions
in the areas of health benefits and anti-wildcat strike
provisions.
Initial coalfield reaction to the new proposal was posi
tive.
"From what I've heard about it, I think it'll go over. It
sounds like a big improvement," said Orville Robinette,
president of UMW Local 750 at Cabin Creek, W.Va.
But a spokesman in UMW District 28 in West Virginia
said local reaction was negative. "We hope the bargain
ing council won't waste time sending it down here," said
Russell Riffle Jr., an attorney for the union.
U.S. Senate may OK Canal Treaty
Washington — Panama Canal treaty proponents yes
terday claimed to have "at least 67 votes" — the number
needed to ratify the first of the two pacts in today's
show-down vote in the Senate.
"As of this afternoon, we've got them," a source close
to Senate leaders said yesterday. The source, who de
clined to be identified, would not name which senators
among five holdouts apparently had decided to vote for
ratification.
Unofficial counts had shown supporters of t-he treaties
with 65 votes and opponents with 30.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), earlier
had said "I think the votes will be there" when the
Senate takes up the measure today that would assure the

U.S. of the right to defend the canal and of continued
use of the waterway once it is turned over to Panama.
Miller expresses views on economy
Washington — President Jimmy Carter should take
early action to increase fuel prices by imposing fees or
quotas on oil imports if Congress fails to quickly enact
his energy program, the new chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board said yesterday. »
Chairman G. William Miller said he favors an import
fee, and said the president should be given authority by
Congress "to scale it as necessary to deal with the prob
lem."
"I hope that takes place," he said. "We're getting
down to vt ry few choices and we need to do something
soon," he said in appearance before the Senate Budget
Committee.
Miller said that quick action to reduce U.S. consump
tion of foreign oil is one of two things the government
should do to build foreign confidence in the U.S. dollar.
The other is to "come up with a strong anti-inflation
program," he said.

should do to build foreign confidence in the U.S. dollar.
The other is to "come up with a strong anti-inflation
program," he said.

New contract may end miner's strike
Washington — The United Mine Workers' bargaining
council approved a new tentative contract last night and
sent it to the coalfields for miners to ratify and end their
100-day coal strike.
The vote was 22-17, according to a bargaining council
member. A union spokesman said he understood that
the ratification vote would be held on a single day, a
week from Friday.
Miller said he "just couldn't imagine the rank and file
turning it down this time."
The tentative contract, the third one between the
union and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association in
the prolonged strike, contains key industry concessions
in the areas of health benefits and anti-wildcat strike
provisions.
Initial coalfield reaction to the new proposal was posi
tive.
"From what I've heard about it, I think it'll go over. It
sounds like a big improvement," said Orville Robinette,
president of UMW Local 750 at Cabin Creek, W.Va.
But a spokesman in UMW District 28 in West Virginia
said local reaction was negative. "We hope the bargain
ing council won't waste time sending it down here," said
Russell Riffle Jr., an attorney for the union.
U.S. Senate may OK Canal Treaty
Washington — Panama Canal treaty proponents yes
terday claimed to have "at least 67 votes" — the number
needed to ratify the first of the two pacts in today's
show-down vote in the Senate.
"As of this afternoon, we've got them," a source close
to Senate leaders said yesterday. The source, who de
clined to be identified, would not name which senators
among five holdouts apparently had decided to vote for
ratification.
Unofficial counts had shown supporters of t-he treaties
with 65 votes and opponents with 30.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), earlier
had said "I think the votes will be there" when the
Senate takes up the measure today that would assure the

U.S. of the right to defend the canal and of continued
use of the waterway once it is turned over to Panama.
Miller expresses views on economy
Washington — President Jimmy Carter should take
early action to increase fuel prices by imposing fees or
quotas on oil imports if Congress fails to quickly enact
his energy program, the new chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board said yesterday. »
Chairman G. William Miller said he favors an import
fee, and said the president should be given authority by
Congress "to scale it as necessary to deal with the prob
lem."
"I hope that takes place," he said. "We're getting
down to vt ry few choices and we need to do something
soon," he said in appearance before the Senate Budget
Committee.
