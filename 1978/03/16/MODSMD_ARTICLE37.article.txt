# Trustees approve annual budget; OK loan limit hike, new facilities
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees has ap
proved the proposed $118.7 million
operating budget for the next
academic year. The action came dur
ing the board's regular meeting
Tuesday in San Francisco.
The board also OK'd a hike in the
maximum loan available under the
Parent Loan Program and a $3.64 mill
ion computer facility. The ad hoc
Subcommittee on Investment Re
sponsibility held its first meeting.
The approved budget provides for
a 9 per cent overall expenditure in
crease next year and a $161,000
surplus.
The surplus money will be trans
ferred to the operating budget re
serve fund, which has been depleted
by $5 to $6 million because of deficit
budgets during the past eight years,
according to Vice Provost for Budget
and Planning Raymond Bacchetti.

Bacchetti said an average 7 per
cent salary hike for faculty is also
planned.
The board approved a $1000 in
crease in the maximum loan possible
under the Parent Loan Program. The
program, designed to lend parents of
students up to $6000 to help defer
costs of tuition room and board, is
presently available only to members
of the class of 1981 and later classes.
The hike increases the maximum
loan to $7000, but the maximum
amount of money available to loan
will remain unchanged under the
plan. The board last year authorized
up to $5 million in loans through the
first four years of the program.
Construction on the new Compu
ter Center designed to consolidate
the Stanford Center for Information
Processing into one facility is plan
ned for May.
Included in the plan is a move of
the Computer Science Department
to Margaret Jacks Hall, currently
under reconstruction, and of the
Communication Department to
Building 120 of the Quad.
Completion is expected in )uly
1979.
The first meeting of the ad hoc
Subcommittee on Investment Re
sponsibility dealt largely with logisti
cal issues, according to Robert
Hamrdla, assistant to the president

for trustee affairs.
The subcommittee, set up last
month to channel recommendations
on proxy issues from the Committee
on Investment Responsibility (CIR)
to the board, is made up of five trus
tees.
According to Hamrdla, all CIR re
commendations which are dated in
such a way that they fall before a full
meeting, will be considered by the
full board after subcommittee
analysis.
In some cases, however, proxy
votes and board meeting schedules
do not allow for full board considera
tion. In such cases, the subcommit
tee will consider the CIR recommen
dations and report to the president
of the board, Peter Bing, according
to Vice President for Business and
Finance William Massy.
Massy said Bing will alert members
of the board and the faculty and stu
dent members of the Investment
Committee by mailgram of tentative
proxy vote decisions. Then board
members who disagree can alert
Bing, Massy said.
All board members will receive
copies of CIR recommendations,
Massy said.
No consideration of any proxies
dealing with South African invest
ment related issues occurred at the
meeting.
