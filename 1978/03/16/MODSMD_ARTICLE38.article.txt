# USE vote postponed until May
## 
### 
The April 4 United Stanford
Employees (USE) election has been
postponed until the May 2 general
membership meeting, USE President
Anne Schlagenhaft said yesterday.
Schlagenhaft said she postponed
the election because of her "respon
sibility to maintain the integrity of the
election process."
Election problems arose at the
March 7 general membership meet
ing when former USE Asst. President
Bill Reynolds was selected to chair
the meeting over Schlagenhaft. USE
Secretary Jim Berk was fired at the
meeting, a move later ruled uncon
stitutional by Schlagenhaft.
All business at the meeting was
then void, including nominations for
union office. The April meeting will
be the last opportunity for nomina
tions to be placed for USE office. The
group representative elections will
also be held at the May meeting.
A letter from Schlagenhaft to the
general membership of the 1400-
member union will be circulated to
union members today explaining the
election postponement.
Schlagenhaft said she conferred
with Service Employees International
Union (SEIU) President George
Hardy and SEIU Western Regional
Vice President Tim Toomey in mak
ing the decision to postpone the
election.
