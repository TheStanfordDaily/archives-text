## Koko's teacher receives grant 
### Helen Nissenbaum 
Penny Patterson, a Ph.D. student in psychology
here, has received $27,000 to continue studying her
"talking" gorillas, Koko and Michael.
Patterson won the prize in international competi
tion for the "Rolex Award for Enterprise." It supple
ments her annual grant from the National Geographic
Society and gifts from the Gorilla Foundation.
Koko, the world's first "talking" gorilla, will be
seven years old in July. She has a regular vocabulary
of 300 American Sign Language (ASL) words but has
used at least 600 ASL words, according to Patterson.
Patterson's research has challenged the belief that
gorillas could not learn sign language. Patterson be
lieves that gorillas are about as intelligent as chim
panzees.
Koko is able to understand spoken English. She can
also bathe herself and use a toilet.
In addition, Koko is learning to communicate by
typing with color-coded keys on a computer that ex
presses words on a loud speaker.
Despite the fact that Koko is stronger than a man,
Patterson reports that "she's really very careful"
when wrestling with humans. Patterson added how
ever, that when Koko does something wrong she is
"very good at making it look unintentional."
Koko is learning to express emotions such as
"happy" and "mad" in sign language, and she has
mastered time concepts such as "late," "now" and
"tomorrow."
Patterson said Koko "has a charming personality"
and a "sense of humor."
Cindy Duggan, one of Patterson's two full-time as
sistants, was once about to feed Koko when the
gorilla "told" her to put the food in her nose.

On another occasion, Duggan was trying to teach
Koko the word "think." After many unsuccessful at
tempts to get Koko to "say" the word, Koko re
sponded with "a stubborn devil, idea devil, pretend
devil," or, as Patterson paraphrased, a devilish "idea
to pretend," not to learn.
Patterson said the gorilla was absorbing the infor
mation but "can be very stubborn when she knows
that we are being frustrated."
Last week Koko was in heat. Patterson said it will
still be another year or two before she will be ready to
bear an infant.
Michael, Koko's five-year-old companion is also
being trained to speak.
"He learns very fast," Patterson said, and has the
advantage of Koko's example. The two get along
beautifully, according to the researcher.
Since Patterson's work with gorillas is unpre
cedented, she says she has no idea of what they are
going to be like in the future. They have not reached
intellectual maturity, but Patterson said that she is not
sure when their "natural ability will reach a plateau."
Patterson intends to continue studying the two
primates throughout their lives, including mating and
family relationships. A gorilla has an average life span
of 40.
Patterson's $27,000 will go toward a new, sturdy
self-contained computer system.
The money will also fund "new housing facilities"
and pay for a tutor for Michael, Patterson said.
Patterson said she is looking for assistants who are
fluent in ASL.
Her ultimate goal is to secure a "secluded piece of
land" where they can settle permanently. Patterson is
currently conducting her research in a small trailer
behind the Stanford Museum.

Patterson reports that "she's really very careful"
when wrestling with humans. Patterson added how
ever, that when Koko does something wrong she is
"very good at making it look unintentional."
Koko is learning to express emotions such as
"happy" and "mad" in sign language, and she has
mastered time concepts such as "late," "now" and
"tomorrow."
Patterson said Koko "has a charming personality"
and a "sense of humor."
Cindy Duggan, one of Patterson's two full-time as
sistants, was once about to feed Koko when the
gorilla "told" her to put the food in her nose.

On another occasion, Duggan was trying to teach
Koko the word "think." After many unsuccessful at
tempts to get Koko to "say" the word, Koko re
sponded with "a stubborn devil, idea devil, pretend
devil," or, as Patterson paraphrased, a devilish "idea
to pretend," not to learn.
Patterson said the gorilla was absorbing the infor
mation but "can be very stubborn when she knows
that we are being frustrated."
Last week Koko was in heat. Patterson said it will
still be another year or two before she will be ready to
bear an infant.
Michael, Koko's five-year-old companion is also
being trained to speak.
"He learns very fast," Patterson said, and has the
advantage of Koko's example. The two get along
beautifully, according to the researcher.
Since Patterson's work with gorillas is unpre
cedented, she says she has no idea of what they are
going to be like in the future. They have not reached
intellectual maturity, but Patterson said that she is not
sure when their "natural ability will reach a plateau."
Patterson intends to continue studying the two
primates throughout their lives, including mating and
family relationships. A gorilla has an average life span
of 40.
Patterson's $27,000 will go toward a new, sturdy
self-contained computer system.
The money will also fund "new housing facilities"
and pay for a tutor for Michael, Patterson said.
Patterson said she is looking for assistants who are
fluent in ASL.
Her ultimate goal is to secure a "secluded piece of
land" where they can settle permanently. Patterson is
currently conducting her research in a small trailer
behind the Stanford Museum.

Penny Patterson, a Ph.D. student in psychology
here, has received $27,000 to continue studying her
"talking" gorillas, Koko and Michael.
Patterson won the prize in international competi
tion for the "Rolex Award for Enterprise." It supple
ments her annual grant from the National Geographic
Society and gifts from the Gorilla Foundation.
Koko, the world's first "talking" gorilla, will be
seven years old in July. She has a regular vocabulary
of 300 American Sign Language (ASL) words but has
used at least 600 ASL words, according to Patterson.
Patterson's research has challenged the belief that
gorillas could not learn sign language. Patterson be
lieves that gorillas are about as intelligent as chim
panzees.
Koko is able to understand spoken English. She can
also bathe herself and use a toilet.
In addition, Koko is learning to communicate by
typing with color-coded keys on a computer that ex
presses words on a loud speaker.
Despite the fact that Koko is stronger than a man,
Patterson reports that "she's really very careful"
when wrestling with humans. Patterson added how
