Ori a scale of one to seven, stu
dents here rate the overall quality of
the undergraduate advising system
at 3.6, according to results of a
recent ASSU survey.
"Our purpose was to see what stu
dents think of advising," said Carl
Chamberlin, a member of the ASSU
committee conducting the survey.
"We need some sort of basis from
which we can initiate a change."
"While complete analysis and
tabulation of the survey isn't
finished," said ASSU Co-president
Greg Larson, "results so far indicate
that there is a definite need for im
provement."
The survey was sent out to 300 ran
domly selected sophomore, junior,
senior and co-terminal students to
evaluate the effectiveness of their
advising experiences. The survey
was divided into three categories:
first year general advising, second
year general advising and major ad
vising.
Major advising
Overall, students were the most
satisfied with major advising, which
received 4.6 on a scale of one to se
ven. Second year general advising
received 3.5, and first year general
advising was rated 3.05.
"Due to changes in the advising
system, some might expect that
newer students would have a higher
rating of the advising system," said
Larson. "There is an improvement in
the rating of second year general ad
vising, but no significant improve
ment anywhere else."
Response to the survey indicated
that in all three areas of advising,
students felt that the most important
function of the adviser was "to share
his or her knowledge of Stanford's
programs and policies." Yet when
asked to rate the adviser's success in
this area on a scale of one to seven,
first year general advising received
2.9, second year general advising re
ceived 3.2 and major advising re
ceived 4.3.
Other functions of the adviser
which students were asked to
evaluate included, aid in course
selection, writing letters of recom
mendation and helping plan future

careers.
Many students indicated that there
should be more emphasis on peer
advising. The survey asked students
what other people in addition to
their adviser they have used in seek
ing advice. About 60 per cent had
used an older student and 59 per cent
a friend or roommate.
Polled on the potential of a peer
advising program, more than 60 per
cent of the students approved the
idea, rating it 5, 6 or 7.
The committee plans to use the re
sults of the survey in suggesting ways
to improve advising at the University.
"The advising system can be sum
med up in one simple phrase: it lacks
competence and commitment," said
one student. "Advisers lack informa
tion and interest in their advisees. A
peer adviser would help this situa
tion."

Major advising
Overall, students were the most
satisfied with major advising, which
received 4.6 on a scale of one to se
ven. Second year general advising
received 3.5, and first year general
advising was rated 3.05.
"Due to changes in the advising
system, some might expect that
newer students would have a higher
rating of the advising system," said
Larson. "There is an improvement in
the rating of second year general ad
vising, but no significant improve
ment anywhere else."
Response to the survey indicated
that in all three areas of advising,
students felt that the most important
function of the adviser was "to share
his or her knowledge of Stanford's
programs and policies." Yet when
asked to rate the adviser's success in
this area on a scale of one to seven,
first year general advising received
2.9, second year general advising re
ceived 3.2 and major advising re
ceived 4.3.
Other functions of the adviser
which students were asked to
evaluate included, aid in course
selection, writing letters of recom
mendation and helping plan future

careers.
Many students indicated that there
should be more emphasis on peer
advising. The survey asked students
what other people in addition to
their adviser they have used in seek
ing advice. About 60 per cent had
used an older student and 59 per cent
a friend or roommate.
Polled on the potential of a peer
advising program, more than 60 per
cent of the students approved the
idea, rating it 5, 6 or 7.
The committee plans to use the re
sults of the survey in suggesting ways
to improve advising at the University.
"The advising system can be sum
med up in one simple phrase: it lacks
competence and commitment," said
one student. "Advisers lack informa
tion and interest in their advisees. A
peer adviser would help this situa
tion."
