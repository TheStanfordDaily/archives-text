# NAACP chairperson rejects reverse bias

### Charlie Smith 
Margaret Wilson, chairperson of
the Board of the NAACP spoke here
Monday night on the need for
economic advancement of blacks.
She criticized the newly coined term
"reverse discrimination," and dis
cussed the crisis in South Africa.
The leader of the National Associa
tion for the Advancement of Colored
People gave her presentation before

40-50 persons in Meyer Forum Room.
Analyzing prospects for reform in
America, Wilson said in order to gain
economic development, all blacks
must unite political strategies since
black people "have got to be related
to where we are in this system and
what leverages we have."
Wilson also said affluent blacks
must not separate from poverty
stricken blacks as they have done in
the past.
Discrimination
She added that blacks are as dis
criminated against now as they were
70 years ago, but that current dis
crimination is more subtle.
For example, Wilson said that in
Massachusetts, minorities own only
1 per cent of building contracts.
By depending on black power, the
race can achieve greater equality
through laws, Wilson contended.
Blacks however must first get into the
"backbone of production and sup
ply" in America, she added.
'Madison Avenue'
Wilson said the term "reverse dis
crimination" was a phrase "by Madi
son Avenue" that tries to "confuse
the issue and destroy one of the best
aspects of the '605."
Wilson pointed out that for whites

to claim "reverse discrimination"
implies they must have been dis
criminated against. Yet she said she
sees no evidence of discrimination
against a dominant race that controls
such unequal proportions of wealth
in America.
Wilson also said she thinks South
Africa is on the ver<Â»e of "a blow-up."
She felt those "hunted" people are
"our brothers and sisters, and they
need us, and I think we ought to
help. It is in our self-interest to
help."
At the same time the chairperson
warned against violence and protests
against industries in South Africa.
She said she felt there was no need to
discuss the issue of investments in
South Africa. She said blacks tried to
fight discriminating industries in the
United States and it was a "long,
bloody war. We have to quit" these
protests, she added.
No 'marshalls'
Finally Wilson said she felt great
fear for the prospects of black people
in the United States, since there were
no more "Thurgood Marshalls" to
protect blacks' rights through laws.
There are not enough young black
people ready to work for freedom,
she added.

She said it will soon be time for the
young to take over the cause for
black rights. And without trained
workers, achievements of the past
could be wiped away by cases like
Bakke.
After her speech, Clay Carson, as
sistant professor of history, recapitu
lated the past discussion on blacks'
future.
