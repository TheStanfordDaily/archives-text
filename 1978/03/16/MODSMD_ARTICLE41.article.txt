# A
						look inside the ASSU Senate
## 
### Sara Lessley News analysis 
"It's a good lesson in reality," says
one member about the ASSU Senate.
"It's the tool that the University uses
to do their shitwork," says another.
Events of the past two quarters
have disillusioned some senators,
leading them to question the pur
pose and power of the legislative
body, while others remain optimis
tic.
The point is to see "what you can
change" and work toward that goal,
said Sen. Tom McCormack.
Learning to work within the ad
ministration, and dealing with com
mittees, reports and the rest of the
bureaucracy may have disillusioned
some senators who had hopes of
immediate and far-reaching change.
Both the senate and the Stanford
Organizing Committee (SOC) got a
"full dose of reality" after learning
what they could and could not do
this year, according to McCormack.
Chairperson Fred Crethel said the

whole ASSU should be reorganized.
Senators begin to recognize prob
lems and methods for solving them
as they progress through the system,
he said.
"Given the inherent restrictions in
the system, we've done well," he
said.
Turning to SOC specifically,
Crethel said, "we've done a lot of
what we set out to do." Early fears
about radical changes SOC might
enact were unfounded, according to
Crethel. "The fact is, things we said
we were going to do weren't crazy or
radical."
Crethel called SOC progressive,
while fellow SOC member Sen. Rick
Levy said members range from prog
ressive to radical.
SOC has "a very strong record in
women's issues," Crethel asserted.
The slate initiated a sexist language
proposal. He called absolutely
ridiculous charges that SOC has rail
roaded measures through the se
nate.
"SOC has bent over backward to
accommodate people" and their
opinions. In some cases where the
outcome was already obvious, the
measure didn't pass until it had al
most complete support, he said.
Sen. Doug Bandow said SOC
"controls the senate by virtue of
enough people . . . but they haven't
controlled it in a malicious way."
SOC members total 13 of 20
senators.
Senators generally agree that there
is a wide spectrum of political views
within the senate, from libertarian to
radical. However, several say the
proportion is unbalanced, with more
radical/progressive opinions rep
resented in the senate than exist
proportionally in the student body.
In any case, the senate will con
tinue to serve as the voice of the
Stanford student community as long
as it continues to exist.
"As long as the University refuses
to take care of student services, there

has to be somebody to do it," Sen.
Lynn Rubinett said.
However, the future of the senate
may be in doubt. Included in the un
finished agenda at the last senate
meeting was a proposal by Bandow
charging "great student dissatisfac
tion with the ASSU." The measure
seeks a student body vote on whether
to eliminate the senate and the COP.
The senate has faced some "dis
tracting" crises, Crethel said, but for
a legislative body with its percep
tions, ideologies and temperaments,
"the senate has handled the crises
pretty well."

However, optimism about the se
nate appears to have weakened and
senate attendance has decreased.
Sen. Carlyle Kinnison said he is "dis
illusioned."
In a dispute with President Richard
Lyman over the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR),
Lyman "let us know where we stood
in the power structure of the Univer
sity," Kinnison said.
"It's taken two quarters to realize
just what we can do," Kinnison ad
ded. "The only function the senate
can perform at this point is toward
causes concerned with funding or
ganizations" and keeping issues
alive through publicity, he said.
"We've learned just what we can
and can't change," McCormack ad
ded.
Debate over relatively few issues
has occupied a large part of senate

time. Long, slow meetings have been
the rule. Seldom has the entire
agenda been completed. Often the
last few minutes of meetings have
seen the hurried passage of what one
senator called "pet resolutions."
Often senators pay little attention,
responding to statements made half
an hour earlier.
"The fact that we've had long
meetings is indicative of a di
vergence of opinion," Grethel said.
Opinion splits over what issues are
relevant to the senate. Some
senators share McCormack's view
that the ASSU should restrict itself to
issues that "have anything to do with
students directly or indirectly, or
which might affect students on cam
pus."
McCormack questioned the rele
vance of measures such as ones deal
ing with reproductive rights and the
extermination of harp seals.
However, there is no clear line di
viding campus issues and so-called
worldwide issues, according to
Rubinett.
McCormack called the majority of
senate legislation "paper legisla
tion," which, "doesn't accomplish
anything, it just passes out an opin
ion."
Grethel said, "there is no such
thing as paper legislation if it is fol
lowed up . . . and that is a big if."
Rubinett said she has "doubts
about the usefulness of the whole
structure" (of the ASSU), but added
she thinks the senate is necessary for
"generally running ASSU bureauc
racy and student services."
Stanford could function without
the senate said Sen. Al Miner, "with a
Council of Presidents of eight, for
instance."
For the time being anyway, the se
nate will remain. The present senate
has one quarter left to serve. Several
senators said they expected the
spring to be "active" for the senate,
with lots of projects "coming to frui
tion."
