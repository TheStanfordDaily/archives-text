# Revolutionary cloning report draws disagreement here
## 
### Rob Lempert 
Two University biology professors
have disputed a recent claim that a
human child has been created from
an adult man's cell through a
laboratory procedure called cloning.
David Rorvik, a San Francisco
based science writer, claims to have
organized the cloning experiment.
The details of the scientific proce
dure will be published next month in
his book "In His Image — The Clon
ing of a Man."
"In principle cloning is possible,
but current technology is not close to
achieving it in humans," said Stan
ford biology professor Philip
Hanawalt.
He added he believes the Rorvik
report is "very unlikely."
Another biologist here, Allan
Campbell, said no one to his know
ledge has ever successfully cloned
any higher animal, though British
scientists have succeeded in replac
ing the nucleus of a frog egg with the
complete genetic material from an
adult frog, thereby cloning a tadpole.
Rorvik's book, published by J.B.
Lippincott Company of New York,
will not reveal the location of the lab
nor the names of those involved in
the experiment, said Lippincott
spokeswoman Diana Hutcheson.
In Seattle Post-lntellingencer
stories of March 2 and 3, Hutcheson
refused to disclose the contents of
the book, but said Lippincott stands
behind the work.
Cloning is a method where a body
cell is taken from a donor animal and,
by one of several methods, is made
to develop as if it were a fertilized
egg. Normal reproduction produces
an offspring which combines the
traits of two parents while cloning
creates exact genetic duplicate of
a single individual.

Rorvik spoke of his involvement in
the cloning experiment to a jour
nalism class at Western Washington
State University (WWSU) in Bellin
gham last month. He said the cloned
child, born of a surrogate mother in
December 1976, is now alive and
"healthy in every respect."
According to a report in the
WWSU student newspaper, Rorvik
said the donor was a wealthy man
without an heir who approached him
in 1973 and asked to be cloned. Ror

vik said the man brought his prop
osal to him because of his extensive
background in writing about cloning
and related embryological subjects.
This alleged breakthrough in gene
tic engineering is being first reported
in a book instead of in a medical
journal because those involved were
promised secrecy, and because the
book doesn't provide the complete
documentation that would let it be
accepted in scholarly circles, accord
ing to Rorvik.
