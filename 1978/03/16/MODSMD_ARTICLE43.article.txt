### Lee Tien 
An ex-convict and a prominent
feminist will provide a departure
from conventional course offerings
next quarter.
The ASSU Guest Professorship
Board has arranged for former in
mate Carlo Prescott and women's
movement leader Lee Novick to
teach classes in the departments of
psychology and undergraduate
studies.
Beth Kerttula, of the Guest Profes
sorship Board, said, "Both Prescott
and Novick should be welcome addi
tions to the curriculum next quar
ter."
Prescott, currently residing in Oak
land, is a former associate of Philip
Zimbardo, professor of psychology
here. The two men worked together
on Zimbardo's famous prison exper
iment, which simulated prison con
ditions to study the differences bet
ween the behavior of guards and in
mates. Prescott is himself a former
inmate.
Prescott will teach "Survival
Strategies for Alienated Peoples."
"This course will focus in depth on
the pervasive problem of alienation
in contemporary American society,"
said Prescott. "It will first explore the
experience of the obviously alien
ated: the poor, the minorities, the
convicts, the social deviants, all of
which I have been and relate to per
sonally. Then our vision will broaden
to encompass the growing legions of
alienated people."
Novick, who has an office in
Washington, D.C., has long been

prominent in the women's move
ment. She was an assistant to former
Congresswoman Bella Abzug and
was a principal organizer of Interna
tional Women's Year and the Na
tional Women's Conference in Texas
last year.
Novick's class is being sponsored
by Nanneri Keohane, assistant pro
fessor of political science, and is ti
tled, "Women's Rights in America: A
Political Perspective."
According to Laura Selznick, un
dergraduate specials director, the
course "will focus on the present
condition of the women's movement
in the United States, particularly as
reflected in the National Plan of Ac
tion adopted at the National Wo
men's Conference in 1977.
"Issues to be covered include the
proposed Equal Rights Amendment,
reproductive freedom, child care,
women in the various phases of the
political system, and the impact of
men on the contemporary women's
movement," she added.
Class lists for both courses will be
at Maples Pavilion on Registration
Day. Scheduling information for the
classes does not appear in the Time
Schedule, since the appointments
were confirmed only recently.
The Guest Professorship Board
began this year with a budget of
$14,300. Guest professors are paid an
average of $3500 per course taught,
plus expenses, according to Kerttula.
The board also plans to bring na
tive American leader Dennis Banks to
speak at an open lecture next quar
ter.
