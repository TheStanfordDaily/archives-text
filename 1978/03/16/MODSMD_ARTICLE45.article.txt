# Sensitivity, techniques taught
## 
### Monika Guttman 
Many classes teach philosophy and a
way of looking at life. Others teach skills
useful in the everyday world. But few
achieve what Marty Weiner has done in his
bartending class — he has combined both
to create a unique personal experiece.
"In order to provide service, you've got
to grow as a person. You've got to learn to
deal with people," said Weiner.
Weiner's students learn a "sensitivity for
people" as well as how to get around the
bar and general savvy.
"Behind the bar, you see all kinds of
life," said Weiner. "Therefore you have to
learn how to have an eye for seeing things
— the sensitivity for making the best of a
situation. This attitude can then apply to all
aspects of life, not just bartending."
Difficult skill
The bartending itself is an intense and
difficult skill, and Weiner makes his class
as professional as possible by applying the
same pressure bartenders encounter
while working.
"The hard thing is to get five orders at
once and keep your cool," said Weiner.
"So I put them under a lot of pressure
where they have to keep it together."

There are 30 students enrolled in this
class, and each has his own "bar" where
he learns different recipes and techniques
for pouring, such as tilting the wrist to the
most beneficial angle.
Weiner has collected used bottles of
every brand and shape and filled them
with colored water so that students under
21 years of age can take the class.
Everyone takes his job seriously. "Ifs a
fast moving course," said one student.
"The pressure is good — the class is similar
to the real situation."
"This class isn't the theory of bartend
ing," said Weiner. "It's get out there and
produce. You're not listening to a lecture,
you're performing."
As one student demonstrated his ability
to pour "a shot" freehand, another stu
dent commented, "I hope you appreciate
this. It took us two classes (four hours) just
to learn the timing on pouring an ounce."
Practical
Weiner said he feels this is one of the
most practical courses on campus. One
not only learns a skill which can bring $50,
$60, or even $70 a night, but it's refreshing
and gives an incredible sense of indepen
dence.

"With bartending, I'm not dependent
on anyone else," said Weiner, who has a
Ph.D. from Stanford and his own small
therapy practice. "I'm not dependent on
an institution.".
Weiner laughed as he recalled that in
the beginning many students were "all
thumbs." But as students learned to
handle the "tools," they learned a great
deal of patience and much about them
selves.
New attitude
"This class is a lot more than the skill of
pouring drinks," said one student, who
admitted that at first he was uncomforta
ble under pressure. "I enrolled to learn a
part-time skill, and I've gained more than
that. I've developed a new attitude."
Part of this attitude is learning that no
matter what your job is, it should be done
well. No "sloppy jobs."
"You learn a certain approach for handl
ing any situation," said Weiner.
Both Weiner and the students said they
felt the class was a success. It will be of
fered again spring quarter and the first or
ganizational meeting will be at 3:30 p.m.
on April 5 in room 49 of the old chemistry
building.

therefore teaches much more than how to mix a drink. Students also learn sensitivity and an attitude

dent commented, "I hope you appreciate
this. It took us two classes (four hours) just
to learn the timing on pouring an ounce."
Practical
Weiner said he feels this is one of the
most practical courses on campus. One
not only learns a skill which can bring $50,
$60, or even $70 a night, but it's refreshing
and gives an incredible sense of indepen
dence.

"With bartending, I'm not dependent
on anyone else," said Weiner, who has a
Ph.D. from Stanford and his own small
therapy practice. "I'm not dependent on
an institution.".
Weiner laughed as he recalled that in
the beginning many students were "all
thumbs." But as students learned to
handle the "tools," they learned a great
deal of patience and much about them
selves.
New attitude
"This class is a lot more than the skill of
pouring drinks," said one student, who
admitted that at first he was uncomforta
ble under pressure. "I enrolled to learn a
part-time skill, and I've gained more than
that. I've developed a new attitude."
Part of this attitude is learning that no
matter what your job is, it should be done
well. No "sloppy jobs."
"You learn a certain approach for handl
ing any situation," said Weiner.
Both Weiner and the students said they
felt the class was a success. It will be of
fered again spring quarter and the first or
ganizational meeting will be at 3:30 p.m.
on April 5 in room 49 of the old chemistry
building.

Marty Weiner, who teaches a bartending class here, said that you see all kinds of life behind a bar. He
therefore teaches much more than how to mix a drink. Students also learn sensitivity and an attitude
about life that can carry over into everday existence.
Many classes teach philosophy and a
way of looking at life. Others teach skills
useful in the everyday world. But few
achieve what Marty Weiner has done in his
bartending class — he has combined both
to create a unique personal experiece.
"In order to provide service, you've got
to grow as a person. You've got to learn to
deal with people," said Weiner.
Weiner's students learn a "sensitivity for
people" as well as how to get around the
bar and general savvy.
"Behind the bar, you see all kinds of
life," said Weiner. "Therefore you have to
learn how to have an eye for seeing things
— the sensitivity for making the best of a
situation. This attitude can then apply to all
aspects of life, not just bartending."
Difficult skill
The bartending itself is an intense and
difficult skill, and Weiner makes his class
as professional as possible by applying the
same pressure bartenders encounter
while working.
"The hard thing is to get five orders at
once and keep your cool," said Weiner.
"So I put them under a lot of pressure
where they have to keep it together."

There are 30 students enrolled in this
class, and each has his own "bar" where
he learns different recipes and techniques
for pouring, such as tilting the wrist to the
most beneficial angle.
Weiner has collected used bottles of
every brand and shape and filled them
with colored water so that students under
21 years of age can take the class.
Everyone takes his job seriously. "Ifs a
fast moving course," said one student.
"The pressure is good — the class is similar
to the real situation."
"This class isn't the theory of bartend
ing," said Weiner. "It's get out there and
produce. You're not listening to a lecture,
you're performing."
As one student demonstrated his ability
to pour "a shot" freehand, another stu
dent commented, "I hope you appreciate
this. It took us two classes (four hours) just
to learn the timing on pouring an ounce."
