# Ten unusual necessities for overseas travelers suggested

Are you taking off for an overseas voyage?
Well, don't seal that suitcase until you've
checked off the items below. The following
10 ideas are slightly unusual necessities that,
if remembered, could help guarantee that
your travel experiences will be enjoyable.
Before leaving, slyly gather the clothing
sizes of your loved ones and jot them down.
Finding the perfect sweater for your grand
mother can have the makings of a special
moment, or the creation of another family
hand-me-down â€” if the size is not correct.
By filling out an index card and tucking it
in your wallet, you'll save yourself the frust
ration of toting 10 extra pounds around
Europe and having it eventually line the bot
tom drawers of your grandmother's bureau.
Alarm clock
A simple, hand-wound alarm clock can
make all the difference between hopping off
a train in Geneva and waking up on the coast
of Yugoslavia. When traveling by rail, each
passenger is responsible for making his or
her train connections. No rosy-cheeked
conductor will nudge you out of sleep and
conveniently help you off at your station.
So when the lulling of thumping train
tracks sets you dozing, you can grab a few
hours of rest knowing you are assured a

prompt awakening.
If flying is your form of transportation, a
traveling alarm can insure that you will wake
up in time to catch an early-morning flight.
To a hotel clerk who has problems witft the
English language, a 7 a.m. wake-up call can
easily sound like 11, and your once-a-month
charter could be somewhere over the Atlan
tic.
Conversion charts
While running your preparational er
rands, add a visit to the local travel agency or
international airline desk. There you will
find handy conversion charts complete with
European equivalents to temperatures, clo
thing sizes and metric weights.
In most European towns the supermarket,
as we know it in America, is still a novelty.
Family stores and local vendors might be the
only link between your stomach and a tasty
meal, so it's important that you know some
of the ground rules in picking out your din
ner.
First, it is against all protocol to handle the
fruits and vegetables. This can pose a prob
lem if you aren't fluent in the language and
you desire a specific amount of produce. By
taking the time to study a metric chart you
can save yourself hours of indigestion, and

the unpleasant discovery that two kilos of
Mandarin oranges take weeks to eat.
Address book
A problem with many European travelers
is once they return home from the conti
nent, they are faced with the fact that poor
correspondence has cost them a few friend
ships.
You can always use the old excuse, "I lost
youraddress," but betteryet, pick up a small
address book and fill it full of names and
addresses. Tiny books (2" x 2") are sold at
most stationary stores. Whether in a purse
or back pocket, the information is there
when you need it, not buried in the bottom
of some suitcase or backpack. If you are
lucky, you may even be surprised to come
home to a welcome-home party!
Prescriptions
To be sure of pleasant sight-seeing it's
necessary that you can see. Eyeglasses or
contacts, if lost, can make a visit to the ruins
of Pompeii into an ancient obstacle course.
The simplest procedure is to have copies
made of either your contacts or glasses and
carry the spare pair with you.
But if finances are short, the next best
thing is to have a complete prescription writ
ten out by your doctor, and left with your
optician. In case you do drop a contact on

the slopes by St. Moritz, you can im
mediately wire your optician (provided you
put his address in your address book) and
have him send you another pair).
A pocket calendar will prove to be invalu
able once you are traveling from country to
country. Leaving your home routine for a
busy and varied schedule can result in total
disorientation. Planning trips, keeping ap
pointments, and just journaling the day's
events are a few of the nifty uses you can find
for this lifesaver.
Finances
Whether taking cash, credit cards or
travelers checks, it's a wise idea to pack away
a few personal checks. Many of the major
banks in the States have branch offices in the
larger cities of Europe, and your personal
check will be honored (provided you have
the proper identification).
Overestimate when drawing up your
spending budget. Keep these safety mea
sures in your suitcase, and financial worries
won't burden your trip.
Arriving in a city at an hour when the
shops are closed can turn disastrous if you
haven't checked ahead and changed some
currency. Coming into Spain between 1 and
4p.m. without a denaro won't even get you a
seat on the park bench.

By changing a few dollars ahead of time
into the currency of the country you will be
visiting, you can enjoy a nice meal and tem
porary shelter until you've secured your
plans for the day.
Medication
If you are presently under some form of
medication, be sure to check with your doc
tor before you plan to leave. If your pre
scribed medication isn't too bulky, take
enough to cover the entire length of time
you will be away.
If you lose the drug, or if a refill dose is
necessary, then you should take a letter
from your doctor describing what ailment
you have, what prescription is recom
mended, and the instructions for taking the
dosage.
A good part of truly learning about Europe
is in talking with the people who live there. If
language isn't your forte, put your faith in
the old adage that a picture tells a thousand
words.
By remembering a few photos of home
and of your family, some interesting conver
sations can evolve even if they are in grins
and gestures. Europeans enjoy seeing how
Americans live and you might be surprised at
the warmth that comes in understanding a
little more about someone else's culture.
