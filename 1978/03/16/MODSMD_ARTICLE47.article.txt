Stratford, Stratford-On-
Avon, and Ashland, move
over. There is a new heartland
of Shakespearean theater thriv

ing right here on the Farm.
A theater so innovative in its
approach it might make the old
master turn over in his tomb.
Last Monday, Professor Larry
Friedlander's English 173 class
gathered in the main lounge of
Toyon Hall to stage the 1978
version of the Friedlander
Shakespearean Festival.
Friedlander's assignment for
students was to either form a

play acting group and present
an excerpt from one of
Shakespeare's plays or to at
tend several plays. Nearly half
the class chose the former op
tion and Monday was the cul
mination of a quarter of hectic
rehearsing.
Friedlander said there are
three reasons why he provides
students with the opportunity
to perform.

"Doing a play is worth 100
hours of reading," Friedlander
explained. One can read and
read a play, but only through
performing the work does one
"discover the people in the
lines," he said.
Working in groups is
another factor that makes
play-acting in a class on
Shakespeare so important.
"Classroom work is typically
so impersonal," he said.
"Studying theater privately
would betray it — it is a com
munal project."
Finally, Friedlander ob
served that art is "about feel
ing, not ideas, and to make it
work you have to discover feel
ing." The play-acting groups
would enable students to feel
Shakespeare instead of simply
analyzing and explicating his
work.
All the play groups are
student-directed. Years ago,
Friedlander brought in profes
sional actors to work with each
group. But he found that al
though the plays produced
were quite polished, students
did not become sufficiently in
timate with the feelings of the
play. Play-acting groups too
closely resembled drama clas
ses.
Now, the absence of profes
sional guidance has forced
students to work out every
phase of their play together.

While the e t .d -esult may not
be as smoothly acted or as cor
rectly blocked as before, the
lessons learned from working
communally and sensing the
play's essence make up for it.
Quality
At the festival, students de
monstrated an appreciation for
Shakespearean plays with en
thusiastic, quality perfor
mances.
The first forest scene of
"Midsummer's Night Dream"
and its play-within-a-play
scene was featured. Other
scenes presented were from
"Much Ado About Nothing"
with an amusing presentation
of several feisty geriatrics, and
the storm scene from "King
Lear."
"Taming of the Shrew" was
well represented by two sepa
rate groups. The first group
performed the two opening
acts. The final act brought the
house down with the "veriest
shrew of all," Bruce Churchill.
He set a precedent for future
Kates that will be, in all likeli
hood, impossible to match.
She/he/it was sterling.
Wine was flowing and it
loosened up both audience,
actors and actresses. Costum
ing ranged from the incongru
ous watches on the wrists and
Adidas on the feet of
Elizabethan-clad performers,
to the outrageous, a bushy

tailed yellow lion and a talking
mule that more closely resem
bled a griffin.
The class took its cue from
Friedlander, who has staged
his Shakespearean Festival
each year since coming here 12
years ago. The spirit of Shakes
peare is what it's all about.
Applause
Friedlander is a fine actor.
His classroom readings of sol
iloquies are a treat, and they
frequently elicit applause from
enraptured audiences.
Friedlander recently re
ceived a grant from the office
of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies to make pilot vid
eotapes about how Shakes
peare is produced.
The tapes, to be used in

class, will show students how
professional actors prepare for
Shakespeare, from first read
ing to final production.
Friedlander is on the Board
of Advisors of the California
Shakespeare Festival, an or
ganization headed by Anthony
Qualyle, a famous British ac
tor.
It is clear that Friedlander is
mad about Shakespeare.
"I love Shakespeare," he
said. "And I love teaching a
class on Shakespeare. I;'s the
only thing I can envisage teach
ing for years without tiring. I
have an undiminished passion
for Shakespeare."
For students here, that out
look bodes well for a pro
longed, meaningful Shakes
pearean love affair.
