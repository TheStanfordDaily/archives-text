# Federal internship selection starts
## 
### Sara Barnum 
The Federal Summer Intern Program is a
highly selective summer program that
places qualified students in government
agencies where they can best contribute
and learn from the experience.
Each year, four or five top schools
nominate several students for employ
ment with various agencies. This year
there are 20 agencies seeking Stanford
nominees. These agencies range from the
Treasury Department to the Housing,
Education and Welfare Department.
The positions and the agencies differ
somewhat each year. This year, for exam
ple, the emphasis is on technical and
health-related fields. Last year business
administration was stressed.
Qualifications
The program looks for well-qualified
students with proven scholastic ability,
usually juniors or seniors who plan to at
tend graduate school, or currently enrol
led graduate students.
Students selected for the program work
in a range of capacities as engineers, re
search scientists, educators, attorneys,
accountants, computer specialists and of
ficials in many other fields.
Alean Clark, director of the Stanford
Student Employment Office, heads the
nominating committee here. The commit
tee includes a faculty representative from
the Graduate School of Business, a stu
dent representative from Stanford-in-

Government and the Assistant Director of
the Student Employment Office.
Nomination process
The nomination process involves indi
vidual rating of the applications, and pos
sibly an interview. The applications in
clude the standard federal form and a
statement of purpose explaining why the
student is interested in the internship.
Students are also encou raged to include
a resume if they feel unsatisfied or re
stricted with a standard form.
Leadership and participation in ex
tracurricular activities are stressed be
cause students must be able to work inde
pendently, said Clark. A three-month
program simply cannot offer much train
ing, she added.
In addition, the program is particularly
interested in students who can make an
easy, comfortable transition from the
academic to the work environment.
Although the nomination process
seems involved, it reduces competition
because there are fewer applicants with
only four or five schools participating, ac
cording to Clark.
Last year, Stanford nominated 33 stu
dents for positions in 16 agencies, and
nine students were selected.
Salaries
The salaries for the internships range
from $171 to $351 a week, but because
most of the agencies are in Washington,
D.C., plane fare and accommodation ex

penses can make it less lucrative.
The program is widely known and could
lead to future government service. Such
employment always looks good on a re
sume. In addition, the agencies make an
effort to fit the applicant's interests and
strengths to a particular job.
For example, senior Richard Hall, a
mathematical sciences major, was chosen
to work for the Social Security Administra
tion in Baltimore, Maryland last summer.
The internship he applied for emphasized
business administration skills, however he
was placed in a computer programming
position because he was particularly in
terested and knowledgeable in that field.
Recommended
Hall said he felt his internship was a
positive educational experience, and he
recommended it highly to anyone in
terested in learning what it is like to work
for the government.
He admitted that the job had its dull
moments, but he said he felt his abilities
had not been utilized as fully in other
summer jobs.
The internships vary among agencies
from being highly structured to letting the
individuals choose their own projects.
Applications for the program are availa
ble at the student employment office and
should be turned in today. The screening
committees will make its selections by
March 25, and nominees will hear from
their respective agencies in May.

only four or five schools participating, ac
cording to Clark.
Last year, Stanford nominated 33 stu
dents for positions in 16 agencies, and
nine students were selected.
Salaries
The salaries for the internships range
from $171 to $351 a week, but because
most of the agencies are in Washington,
D.C., plane fare and accommodation ex

penses can make it less lucrative.
The program is widely known and could
lead to future government service. Such
employment always looks good on a re
sume. In addition, the agencies make an
effort to fit the applicant's interests and
strengths to a particular job.
For example, senior Richard Hall, a
mathematical sciences major, was chosen
to work for the Social Security Administra
tion in Baltimore, Maryland last summer.
The internship he applied for emphasized
business administration skills, however he
was placed in a computer programming
position because he was particularly in
terested and knowledgeable in that field.
Recommended
Hall said he felt his internship was a
positive educational experience, and he
recommended it highly to anyone in
terested in learning what it is like to work
for the government.
He admitted that the job had its dull
moments, but he said he felt his abilities
had not been utilized as fully in other
summer jobs.
The internships vary among agencies
from being highly structured to letting the
individuals choose their own projects.
Applications for the program are availa
ble at the student employment office and
should be turned in today. The screening
committees will make its selections by
March 25, and nominees will hear from
their respective agencies in May.

The Federal Summer Intern Program is a
highly selective summer program that
places qualified students in government
agencies where they can best contribute
and learn from the experience.
Each year, four or five top schools
nominate several students for employ
ment with various agencies. This year
there are 20 agencies seeking Stanford
nominees. These agencies range from the
Treasury Department to the Housing,
Education and Welfare Department.
The positions and the agencies differ
somewhat each year. This year, for exam
ple, the emphasis is on technical and
health-related fields. Last year business
administration was stressed.
Qualifications
The program looks for well-qualified
students with proven scholastic ability,
usually juniors or seniors who plan to at
tend graduate school, or currently enrol
led graduate students.
Students selected for the program work
in a range of capacities as engineers, re
search scientists, educators, attorneys,
accountants, computer specialists and of
ficials in many other fields.
Alean Clark, director of the Stanford
Student Employment Office, heads the
nominating committee here. The commit
tee includes a faculty representative from
the Graduate School of Business, a stu
dent representative from Stanford-in-

Government and the Assistant Director of
the Student Employment Office.
Nomination process
The nomination process involves indi
vidual rating of the applications, and pos
sibly an interview. The applications in
clude the standard federal form and a
statement of purpose explaining why the
student is interested in the internship.
Students are also encou raged to include
a resume if they feel unsatisfied or re
stricted with a standard form.
Leadership and participation in ex
tracurricular activities are stressed be
cause students must be able to work inde
pendently, said Clark. A three-month
program simply cannot offer much train
ing, she added.
In addition, the program is particularly
interested in students who can make an
easy, comfortable transition from the
academic to the work environment.
Although the nomination process
seems involved, it reduces competition
because there are fewer applicants with
only four or five schools participating, ac
cording to Clark.
