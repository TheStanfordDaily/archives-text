# Med School receives full certification
## 
### 
After five years of achieving only
three- and two-year accreditations,
the Medical School has finally re
ceived a regular seven-year accredi
tation, according to Med School ad
ministrators.
Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the Med
School, said he was "pleased to re
port" that the Liaison Committee on
Medical Education "was very positive
about almost all programs for the
school."
The school had been receiving
only limited accreditation because of
vacancies in key department chair
manships, most of which have been
filled, according to the Med Center
News Bureau.
The Committee, composed of
members of the American Medical
Association and the Association of
American Medical Colleges, com
mended the school for "an excep
tionally strong emphasis in re
search."
The committee also cited the
school's "fundamental biomedical
investigations carried on in the basic
science and clinical departments."
However, the committee expres
sed concern over the Med School's
vacancy in its Physiology Department
chairmanship and the lack of de
velopment of adequate facilities for
the department as a whole, accord
ing to Rich.
Although the committee noted the
Med School's "remarkable prog
ress" in expanding its physical plant,
it found that additional facilities
should be provided in surgery, car
diovascular laboratory and ambulat
ory services.
For some time, several clinical de
partments have been experiencing
space shortage, including surgery,
cardiovascular surgery, anesthesiol
ogy and radiology.
The committee commended the
Med School faculty's qualifications,

but added, "If true that policies with
regard to tenure impede the re
cruitment of faculty necessary for
sound educational experience in af
filiated hospitals, a review of these
policies should be undertaken."
According to the News Bureau, the
survey team also collected several
favorable comments from Med
School students, including some
praising the school's responsiveness
to minority needs and "an elective
curriculum which affords oppor
tunities to pursue special interests in
research or additional academic
work."
Surveyers added that they believe
the administration is fully aware of
the areas which students felt needed
improvement and was seeking solu
tions to these problems.
These areas include a more cen
tralized control of academic depart
ments, elimination of course
scheduling conflicts and monitoring
of the quality of teaching in affiliated
hospitals.
