# Med School receives full certification
## 
### 
After five years of achieving only
three- and two-year accreditations,
the Medical School has finally re
ceived a regular seven-year accredi
tation, according to Med School ad
ministrators.
Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the Med
School, said he was "pleased to re
port" that the Liaison Committee on
Medical Education "was very positive
about almost all programs for the
school."
The school had been receiving
only limited accreditation because of
vacancies in key department chair
manships, most of which have been
filled, according to the Med Center
News Bureau.
The Committee, composed of
members of the American Medical
Association and the Association of
American Medical Colleges, com
mended the school for "an excep
tionally strong emphasis in re
search."
