## Jazz/ted gioia Taylor at the peak of his powers 
### 
Cecil Taylor's infrequent
piano recitals are breath-taking
experiences. Taylor's ap
proach to his instrument is
completely unique and full of
surprises. The stark lines of his
improvisations take unex
pected twists and turns, occa
sionally erupting into volcanos
of sound.
Taylor's Sunday night recital
at Berkeley's Zellerbach au
ditorium showed him to be, at
age 44, at the peak of his pow
ers. The physical nature of his
playing has moved critics to

claim that Taylor will never be
able to play as he does now
once he reaches 50.
Their reasoning is under
standable. Taylor literally at
tacks the piano; his hands
crash into the keyboard with
such force that one is sur
prised, as Whitney Bailliet
one wrote, that the keys don't
remained flattened.
Taylor's technical ability is
awesome; at times in his per
formance he would break into
unbelievably fast runs which
involved his hands moving in

opposite directions. Of all
other jazz pianists today
perhaps only Oscar Peterson
can play as fast as Taylor.
The concert opened with a
brief set by pianist Paul Bley.
Bley is an eccentric member of
the early avant-garde; during
the '50s and early '60s he
played with Ornette Coleman,
Don Cherry, and Charlie Ha
den. Later he formed several
groups, most of which in
cluded the fine bassist Gary
Peacock.
Sunday night Bley played his

portion of the concert sitting
on three telephone books
which were perched on the
piano bench; this set-up put
the keyboard on an even level
with his waist.
Bley began with a brief ven
ture into piano-string pluck
ing, before settling down into
impressionistic type of mean
dering. Soon his left hand de
veloped a riff which consisted
of a perfect fifth moved up and
down a half-step; to this his
right hand added Spanish
tinged melodic lines which oc
casionally dipped into atonal
ity. Moving out of this he alter
nated between string-plucking
and impressionistic dallying on
the keys. A brief flurry of
chords ended the first piece; a
very similar second piece fol
lowed and ended Bley's part of
the show.
Taylor's performance far
outshone the considerable ta
lent of Bley. His hands
thrashed the keyboard with
fantastic arpeggios; he played
as if he were possessed.
The word to describe
Taylor's music is "intensity." It
is not unusual for him to finish
a concert dripping with perspi
ration; he plays with a fierce
ness that most pianists would
be unable to maintain for 10
minutes. Yet Taylor, even
when he appears drained, al
ways manages to find the
stamina to continue.
It is perhaps this physical as
pect which makes Taylor's
largely atonal music as popular
as it is. His rhythmic mastery of
jazz adds to the hypnotic
power of his music. The flux of
the music literally carries the
listener along into a world of
frightening power with its rare
moments of exquisite beauty.
Taylor finished the concert
with a romantic excursion into
nineteenth century tonality.
Hi s hands softly cascaded up to
the highest register of the
piano where Taylor concluded
with a delicately placed chord.
Bay Area jazz fans will have a
chance to see Taylor
when he plays at the Keystone
Korner in a week. Taylor, in this
date announced yesterday, will
be playing with pianist Randy
Weston, who is making a rare
journey from his home in
Moricco.
