## Some 'classical' Jarrett 
### 
Keith Jarrett shined brightly
last Sunday in the first of his
two San Francisco concerts at
the War Memorial Opera
House. Playing solo acoustic
piano, Jarrett tied and teased
his responsive audience with a
combination of stylesand mus
ical ideas.
Jarrett's performance, as that
of most artists, is much more
impressive live than on record,
although his "Bremen/
Lausanne" and "Koln" record
ings stand as valuable marks of
his professionalism and inspi
ration. In concert, one sees
more clearly the daemon of
creativity in the musician, as
larrett stomped his feet and
hissed while writhing and
gyrating to the often inconsis
tent pulse of his pieces. In
deed, I questioned the sincer
ity of such showmanship, jar
rett, however, appeared to
need the histrionics in order to
dredge up from his soul a
wealth of ideas.
The concert opened with a
35 minute piece that c losely re
sembled his performances on
the live albums, jarrett divided
the set into a series of seem
ingly disjointed ideas, each of
whose resolutions was too
quick to be satisfying. Upon a
dynamic introduction, in
which he showed the limita

tions of his often oppressively
heavy right hand and the mag
nificence of his subtle, paced
left, he built discord into stan
dard blues.
He then slipped gently into
an East European folk tune and
danced at the keyboard to the
music he was making. Next
came two tributes: one richly
dedicated to American gospel
singing, the other to Aaron
Copeland's melodic "Ap
palachian Spring." A brief in
trusion of ragtime
brought applause from the au
dience.
jarrett presented two of his
strengths during this first part
of the program. First, he inves
tigated with dramatic intensity
the themes mentioned above.
Breaking down the structure of
each by separating into distinct
parts the melody and rhythm,
he imbued them with his per
sonal meditative meanderings.
Second, he provided each
segment with what amounted
to comic relief by breaking the
rhythm and interspersing brief
flourishes, such as the ragtime
cadences, into his melodic
plodding before simply con
cluding the theme.
In the second half of the
program, jarrett played a set of
much better coordinated
ideas. Beginning with a theme

whose tones were reminiscent
of the droning sounds of the
city, in which he most effec
tively brought to mind the dark
hollows of the subway, jarrett
employed both hands in pro
ducing monotones. Here he
used mostly crossover
tec hnique in concentrating on
the black keys. He also toyed
with the strings themselves in
emoting these bizarre sounds.
From the city he moved with
out resolution to a theme of
agonizing despair and death.
He finished with stirring varia
tions on a standard blues prog
ression, as if to say "Look at
what we've been through in
our musical analysts of the
sounds of contemporary soci
ety." The whole set had in it
strains of Ahmad jamaal and
George Gershwin.
In the end, it was not his orig
inality but his synthesis of
forms that made jarrett re
markable in this performance.
Displaying what might be a
limitless range of interpretative
abilities, he unified a number
of pianistic themes in present
ing the latest stage of contem
porary "classical" music. It was
appropriate that, at the end,
larrett implied we should
thank his piano for the perfor
mance, too.

what we've been through in
our musical analysts of the
sounds of contemporary soci
ety." The whole set had in it
strains of Ahmad jamaal and
George Gershwin.
In the end, it was not his orig
inality but his synthesis of
forms that made jarrett re
markable in this performance.
Displaying what might be a
limitless range of interpretative
abilities, he unified a number
of pianistic themes in present
ing the latest stage of contem
porary "classical" music. It was
appropriate that, at the end,
larrett implied we should
thank his piano for the perfor
mance, too.
Keith Jarrett shined brightly
last Sunday in the first of his
two San Francisco concerts at
the War Memorial Opera
House. Playing solo acoustic
piano, Jarrett tied and teased
his responsive audience with a
combination of stylesand mus
ical ideas.
Jarrett's performance, as that
of most artists, is much more
impressive live than on record,
although his "Bremen/
Lausanne" and "Koln" record
ings stand as valuable marks of
his professionalism and inspi
ration. In concert, one sees
more clearly the daemon of
creativity in the musician, as
larrett stomped his feet and
hissed while writhing and
gyrating to the often inconsis
tent pulse of his pieces. In
deed, I questioned the sincer
ity of such showmanship, jar
rett, however, appeared to
need the histrionics in order to
dredge up from his soul a
wealth of ideas.
The concert opened with a
35 minute piece that c losely re
sembled his performances on
the live albums, jarrett divided
the set into a series of seem
ingly disjointed ideas, each of
whose resolutions was too
quick to be satisfying. Upon a
dynamic introduction, in
which he showed the limita

tions of his often oppressively
heavy right hand and the mag
nificence of his subtle, paced
left, he built discord into stan
dard blues.
He then slipped gently into
an East European folk tune and
danced at the keyboard to the
music he was making. Next
came two tributes: one richly
dedicated to American gospel
singing, the other to Aaron
Copeland's melodic "Ap
palachian Spring." A brief in
trusion of ragtime
brought applause from the au
dience.
jarrett presented two of his
strengths during this first part
of the program. First, he inves
tigated with dramatic intensity
the themes mentioned above.
Breaking down the structure of
each by separating into distinct
parts the melody and rhythm,
he imbued them with his per
sonal meditative meanderings.
Second, he provided each
segment with what amounted
to comic relief by breaking the
rhythm and interspersing brief
flourishes, such as the ragtime
cadences, into his melodic
plodding before simply con
cluding the theme.
In the second half of the
program, jarrett played a set of
much better coordinated
ideas. Beginning with a theme

whose tones were reminiscent
of the droning sounds of the
city, in which he most effec
tively brought to mind the dark
hollows of the subway, jarrett
employed both hands in pro
ducing monotones. Here he
used mostly crossover
tec hnique in concentrating on
the black keys. He also toyed
with the strings themselves in
emoting these bizarre sounds.
From the city he moved with
out resolution to a theme of
agonizing despair and death.
He finished with stirring varia
tions on a standard blues prog
ression, as if to say "Look at
what we've been through in
our musical analysts of the
sounds of contemporary soci
ety." The whole set had in it
strains of Ahmad jamaal and
George Gershwin.
