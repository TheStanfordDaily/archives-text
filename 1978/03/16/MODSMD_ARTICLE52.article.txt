## 'Totentanz': inspiring 
### 
The performances of "To
tentanz" last weekend in
Memorial Church took the
traditional Lent "Dance of
Death" several steps further.
Carlos Carvajal, choreog
rapher for the San Francisco
based company, Dance Spec
trum, put together a thought
provoking collection of scenes
which combine such diverse
elements as medieval Christian
legend and symbolism from
the 19605.
The introductory piece,
"Shapes of Evening," an
abstract dance done to Debus
sy's "Dances Sacred and Pro
fane," was imaginatively
choreographed and smoothly
executed. The excellent team
work in the six performances
left lasting images of sylphs
and life-like circles which by
themselves would have suffi
ciently rewarded the audience
for coming.
Following this came the main
part of the program, six pieces
in which Caravajal put forth dif
ferent images of Death. The
first scene consisted of two
well-done dances which show
Death and joy juxtaposed
within a crowd.
The first of these, "Carrying
out the Carnival," is drawn
from the European custom of
burying "King Carnival" on
Ash Wednesday. Perfor

mers entered from all parts
of the church and moved down
the isles toward the front.
Once on the chancel, the chil
dren embarked on a series of
simple circle dances and
games which come down from
the time of the Black Plague.
As the piece goes on, one
sensed the incongruity of the
games and the mood. The
games are morbid: "Ashes,
ashes all fall down," recalling,
the burning of plague victims
inside condemned houses.
The atmosphere, however,
within this close-knit group
remained festive right through
the burial of the king.
In the second piece, "The
Pied Piper," Death was de
picted as an insidious force
within a group. Children, in
the midst of their games, wel
come the piper. He dances
with them, wins their confi
dence and leads them away to
their destruction. By virtue of
their excellent performance
the dancers more than suc
ceeded in creating the feeling
of mixed horror and joy.
In the last scene, "Dies
Irae," Carvajal reiterated an
earlier theme of mass confu
sion in the face of Death, this
time using thoroughly modern
dance technique complete
with strobe light. Though
somewhat redundant, this

piece represented a fine bit of
mass choreographing and di
recting. Moreover the perfor
mers demonstrated them
selves remarkably versatile and
free of traditional ballet inhibi
tions against personal contact.
These qualities allowed them
to carry off Carvajal's complex
vision of the breakdown of
"tribal" unity wblc h he saw in
the I%o<,
Although the :tene was
gent ?fly good, the choice of
eridng war unfortunate.
Death standing Hefore the
dying throng, calls forth a sea
of darkness to cover humanity.
The "sea," however, looked
unmistakably like a large piece
of plastic, arid many in the au
dience left remembering the
trite aspects which inevitably
accompany a statement on
such an all-pervasive topic.
In (act, Carvajal did an excel
lent job of avoiding the trite.
His talent for mass choreog
laphingis rare and allowed him
to make statements about soc
iety as a whole which few
others would attempt.
If the performance fell short
at times, this can be attributed
to Carvajal's overenthusiasm
to use dance as a communica
tive medium. The greatest
tragedy we could witness
would be the death of such en
thusiasm.
