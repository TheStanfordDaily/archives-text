## Martine Van Hamel: 'still striving' 
### 
During the week of February 20 through the
26, the American Ballet Theater Company gave
several performances in the San Francisco
Opera House, concluding theirstay with Giselle
on Sunday evening. Celsey Kirklandand Mikhail
Baryshnikov played the leading roles, Giselle
and Albrecht, while Martine Van Hamel played
Myrtha, the queen of the Wilis. It's a part which,
though only performed during the second act, is
also a principal characterization.
Miss Van Hamel, of principal status with ABT,
won a gold medal at Varna, Bulgaria, in 1966 —
the same year Baryshnikov won his. At that time,
she was a principal dancer with The National
Ballet of Canada, dancing classical Marius Petipa
roles in Swan Lake, roles in Tudor ballets such as
lardin in aux Lilas, and parts of Balanchines's
neo-classical ballets as well.
Weary of the company's rather provincial,
staid atmosphere, she decided to go to New
York to find the excitement of performing for
the world's most knowledgeable ballet audi
ence. She joined the Joffrey Ballet, only to
realize that its cult of the pop-ballet freaks did
not suit her more refined taste. After having
been a principal with the Canadian company,
she was accepted as a member of ABT's corps.
Having an implicit belief in her eventual recog
nition, she stayed with the company and was

finally promoted to principal in 1971 — after
three years of minor roles. Daughter of a now
retired Dutch diplomat, she received her train
ing in Denmark, Holland, and Venezuela.
I was fortunately able to see her in Saturday
evening's performances as the white swan and
in Sacre de Printemps, as well as in Sunday's
Giselle.
And from Martine Van Hamel's first an
guished thrust onto stage as the white swan
Saturday evening in Makarova's resetting of
Swan Lake, we knew this swan was once an
impressive princess and remained a dominant
creature. The captivity of such a willful soul
seems all the more tortuous, then, for her. It's
Van Hamel's arms that give her this strength.
She pushes her arms as if through thick water
and then shakes the drops off her fingertips.
They do not undulate but radiate a muscular
power from her shoulders.
In Sacre de Printemps, also presented on
Saturday evening, a putty-colored mass of
gooey, only half-gelled humanity oozes and
writhes in fetal and ape-like contortions, cul
minating in the stringing-up of one of their
members. Nanette Glushak picks up the
deepest part of the trough of a torso swing arid
lets it whiplash back, but it was Van Hamel again
who consistently recognized the texture of Glen
Tetley's primordial choreography. It's the thick,
molten quality of her movements up to the mo
ment of their completion that distinguishes her.
Before her performance on Sunday night as
Giselle, Van Hamel, dressed in a dark green knit
warm-up suit, auburn hair just released from a
pink headband, Scorpion eyes blinking behind
a thin cloud of Dunhill smoke, explained her
preparation for a role.
And I found that like her eclectic repertory,
her off-stage manner is a combination of old
fashioned, aloof regality and a more contem
porary, approachable familiarity.
"It's necessary," she said, "to discover or find
a clue, something that physically clicks, unique
to that role, that will sustain the character
throughout the role. And finding that of course
takes experience."
She's always felt that the use of the arms is
very important. She did have good basic training
in schools all over the world, but after much

exuberant Russian training, she found the
change to a very placed way of training at Cana
da's national school quite beneficial.
Van Hamel is most renowned for portraying
Myrtha, the queen of the Wilis, who reigns over
Giselle and Albrecht in the underworld. (Even
when she's not playing Myrtha, inevitably some
critic mentions that she should be.) She finds it
funny to be remembered as the Queen since
"it's not one of my favorite roles." She feels that,
"Usually, Myrtha is misunderstood and por
trayed as totally evil. But, after all, Myrtha is
there for the same reason that Giselle is — be
cause she was jilted. So she has an understand
ing of love and because she's a queen, she's
grander, with greater knowledge."
In Sunday evening's performance, of Giselle,
she opens her shoulders beyond the point of
rigidity to suggest an hint of imperial generosity.
She tilts her neck to the side while tracing small
travelling steps and carves out her lines in a
frigid communication that is on the verge of
thawing.
Playingqueen isn'ta role, it's an attitude. Mar
tine never assumed she'd be stuck in the corps
of a ballet company. As to being a dancer, she
was one before she had any choice in the mat
ter. Daughter of a Dutch diplomat, she travelled
during childhood and never had felt a yen to be
part of "that settled society." Although she's
only with her colleagues when she's working,
it's hard to meet people; a few treasured friends
provide a haven for after-the-ballet relaxation.
"And anyway, the people who wait around
stage doors don't seem to be that interesting,
not the kind of people to have fun with."
I asked her if she still kept her reputation for
staying up late until the wee hours. "No. Maybe
I'm getting conservative, but there's a point
beyond which you can't push. You have to do
something after ballet, but eventually you have
to crash. Most people need discipline and if
you're going to accomplish anything in life
you've got to take the time. Ballet is different, of
course, in that the body, being vulnerable,
doesn't function the same way everyday. When
conditions are bad, one needs the knowledge
and strength with which to cope with an instru
ment that you can't momentarily change or dis
card like a pen."

guished thrust onto stage as the white swan
Saturday evening in Makarova's resetting of
Swan Lake, we knew this swan was once an
impressive princess and remained a dominant
creature. The captivity of such a willful soul
seems all the more tortuous, then, for her. It's
Van Hamel's arms that give her this strength.
She pushes her arms as if through thick water
and then shakes the drops off her fingertips.
They do not undulate but radiate a muscular
power from her shoulders.
In Sacre de Printemps, also presented on
Saturday evening, a putty-colored mass of
gooey, only half-gelled humanity oozes and
writhes in fetal and ape-like contortions, cul
minating in the stringing-up of one of their
members. Nanette Glushak picks up the
deepest part of the trough of a torso swing arid
lets it whiplash back, but it was Van Hamel again
who consistently recognized the texture of Glen
Tetley's primordial choreography. It's the thick,
molten quality of her movements up to the mo
ment of their completion that distinguishes her.
Before her performance on Sunday night as
Giselle, Van Hamel, dressed in a dark green knit
warm-up suit, auburn hair just released from a
pink headband, Scorpion eyes blinking behind
a thin cloud of Dunhill smoke, explained her
preparation for a role.
And I found that like her eclectic repertory,
her off-stage manner is a combination of old
fashioned, aloof regality and a more contem
porary, approachable familiarity.
"It's necessary," she said, "to discover or find
a clue, something that physically clicks, unique
to that role, that will sustain the character
throughout the role. And finding that of course
takes experience."
She's always felt that the use of the arms is
very important. She did have good basic training
in schools all over the world, but after much

exuberant Russian training, she found the
change to a very placed way of training at Cana
da's national school quite beneficial.
Van Hamel is most renowned for portraying
Myrtha, the queen of the Wilis, who reigns over
Giselle and Albrecht in the underworld. (Even
when she's not playing Myrtha, inevitably some
critic mentions that she should be.) She finds it
funny to be remembered as the Queen since
"it's not one of my favorite roles." She feels that,
"Usually, Myrtha is misunderstood and por
trayed as totally evil. But, after all, Myrtha is
there for the same reason that Giselle is — be
cause she was jilted. So she has an understand
ing of love and because she's a queen, she's
grander, with greater knowledge."
In Sunday evening's performance, of Giselle,
she opens her shoulders beyond the point of
rigidity to suggest an hint of imperial generosity.
She tilts her neck to the side while tracing small
travelling steps and carves out her lines in a
frigid communication that is on the verge of
thawing.
Playingqueen isn'ta role, it's an attitude. Mar
tine never assumed she'd be stuck in the corps
of a ballet company. As to being a dancer, she
was one before she had any choice in the mat
ter. Daughter of a Dutch diplomat, she travelled
during childhood and never had felt a yen to be
part of "that settled society." Although she's
only with her colleagues when she's working,
it's hard to meet people; a few treasured friends
provide a haven for after-the-ballet relaxation.
"And anyway, the people who wait around
stage doors don't seem to be that interesting,
not the kind of people to have fun with."
I asked her if she still kept her reputation for
staying up late until the wee hours. "No. Maybe
I'm getting conservative, but there's a point
beyond which you can't push. You have to do
something after ballet, but eventually you have
to crash. Most people need discipline and if
you're going to accomplish anything in life
you've got to take the time. Ballet is different, of
course, in that the body, being vulnerable,
doesn't function the same way everyday. When
conditions are bad, one needs the knowledge
and strength with which to cope with an instru
ment that you can't momentarily change or dis
card like a pen."

During the week of February 20 through the
26, the American Ballet Theater Company gave
several performances in the San Francisco
Opera House, concluding theirstay with Giselle
on Sunday evening. Celsey Kirklandand Mikhail
Baryshnikov played the leading roles, Giselle
and Albrecht, while Martine Van Hamel played
Myrtha, the queen of the Wilis. It's a part which,
though only performed during the second act, is
also a principal characterization.
Miss Van Hamel, of principal status with ABT,
won a gold medal at Varna, Bulgaria, in 1966 —
the same year Baryshnikov won his. At that time,
she was a principal dancer with The National
Ballet of Canada, dancing classical Marius Petipa
roles in Swan Lake, roles in Tudor ballets such as
lardin in aux Lilas, and parts of Balanchines's
neo-classical ballets as well.
Weary of the company's rather provincial,
staid atmosphere, she decided to go to New
York to find the excitement of performing for
the world's most knowledgeable ballet audi
ence. She joined the Joffrey Ballet, only to
realize that its cult of the pop-ballet freaks did
not suit her more refined taste. After having
been a principal with the Canadian company,
she was accepted as a member of ABT's corps.
Having an implicit belief in her eventual recog
nition, she stayed with the company and was

finally promoted to principal in 1971 — after
three years of minor roles. Daughter of a now
retired Dutch diplomat, she received her train
ing in Denmark, Holland, and Venezuela.
I was fortunately able to see her in Saturday
evening's performances as the white swan and

Van Hamel is most renowned for portraying
Myrtha, the queen of the Wilis, who reigns over

funny to be remembered as the Queen since
"it's not one of my favorite roles." She feels that,
"Usually, Myrtha is misunderstood and por
trayed as totally evil. But, after all, Myrtha is
there for the same reason that Giselle is — be

During the week of February 20 through the
26, the American Ballet Theater Company gave
several performances in the San Francisco
Opera House, concluding theirstay with Giselle
on Sunday evening. Celsey Kirklandand Mikhail
Baryshnikov played the leading roles, Giselle
and Albrecht, while Martine Van Hamel played
Myrtha, the queen of the Wilis. It's a part which,
though only performed during the second act, is
also a principal characterization.
Miss Van Hamel, of principal status with ABT,
won a gold medal at Varna, Bulgaria, in 1966 —
the same year Baryshnikov won his. At that time,
she was a principal dancer with The National
Ballet of Canada, dancing classical Marius Petipa
roles in Swan Lake, roles in Tudor ballets such as
lardin in aux Lilas, and parts of Balanchines's
neo-classical ballets as well.
Weary of the company's rather provincial,
staid atmosphere, she decided to go to New
York to find the excitement of performing for
the world's most knowledgeable ballet audi
ence. She joined the Joffrey Ballet, only to
realize that its cult of the pop-ballet freaks did
not suit her more refined taste. After having
been a principal with the Canadian company,
she was accepted as a member of ABT's corps.
Having an implicit belief in her eventual recog
nition, she stayed with the company and was

finally promoted to principal in 1971 — after
three years of minor roles. Daughter of a now
retired Dutch diplomat, she received her train
ing in Denmark, Holland, and Venezuela.
I was fortunately able to see her in Saturday
evening's performances as the white swan and
in Sacre de Printemps, as well as in Sunday's
Giselle.
And from Martine Van Hamel's first an
guished thrust onto stage as the white swan
Saturday evening in Makarova's resetting of
Swan Lake, we knew this swan was once an
impressive princess and remained a dominant
creature. The captivity of such a willful soul
seems all the more tortuous, then, for her. It's
Van Hamel's arms that give her this strength.
She pushes her arms as if through thick water
and then shakes the drops off her fingertips.
They do not undulate but radiate a muscular
power from her shoulders.
In Sacre de Printemps, also presented on
Saturday evening, a putty-colored mass of
gooey, only half-gelled humanity oozes and
writhes in fetal and ape-like contortions, cul
minating in the stringing-up of one of their
members. Nanette Glushak picks up the
deepest part of the trough of a torso swing arid
lets it whiplash back, but it was Van Hamel again
who consistently recognized the texture of Glen
Tetley's primordial choreography. It's the thick,
molten quality of her movements up to the mo
ment of their completion that distinguishes her.
Before her performance on Sunday night as
Giselle, Van Hamel, dressed in a dark green knit
warm-up suit, auburn hair just released from a
pink headband, Scorpion eyes blinking behind
a thin cloud of Dunhill smoke, explained her
preparation for a role.
And I found that like her eclectic repertory,
her off-stage manner is a combination of old
fashioned, aloof regality and a more contem
porary, approachable familiarity.
"It's necessary," she said, "to discover or find
a clue, something that physically clicks, unique
to that role, that will sustain the character
throughout the role. And finding that of course
takes experience."
She's always felt that the use of the arms is
very important. She did have good basic training
in schools all over the world, but after much

exuberant Russian training, she found the
change to a very placed way of training at Cana
da's national school quite beneficial.
