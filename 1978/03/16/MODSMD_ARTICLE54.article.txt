## 'A wonderfully puzzling spectacle' 
### 
The Palo Alto Players' pro
duction of "Guys and Dolls,"
although having experienced a
post-performance period simi
lar to the Battle of Dunkirk, has
been resolved into a
wonderfully dazzling specta
cle of visual imagery. It's a sure
bet that this versionof the eter
nal musical of Swerlmg and
Burrows will draw packed
houses throughout its run. In
fact, ignoring all the other as
sets of this show temporarily,
the wonderful costumes alone
will undeniably prevent poor
audiences.
This play, based upon a story
and characters by Damon Ru
nyan, which most students will
recall from Rams Head's weak
attempt two years ago, deals

with the course of love amidst
the gambling of the oldest es
tablished floating crap game of
New York City.
The costume designer, Ellen
Chambers, has succeeded
through many hours of labor in
attiring the entire cast in such
exceptional clothes that she
has singlehandedly removed
all possibility of the show
bombing. The salvation army
uniforms are real. The suits of
the crapshooters remind
everyone of the Roaring Twen
ties, and so do the flapper-like
outfits of the Hot Box Dolls.
The bright Havana dancers'
outfits are even better than as
could be expected.
Although some of the cast
look hypnotically out at the

audience at times, their
onstage, intra-actor communi
cation is excellent on the
whole. It is a true pleasure to
see such a fine accumulation of
acting and singing talent in a
single show. Especially strong
is Daniel Marcus, whom we
fondly recall from Theat
reworks' "Oliver," as Nicely-
Nicely )onson.
Abe Vigoda
Markus, together with Rick
Lee perform the title song so
excellently that all others are
almost forgotten at the curtain
call. Following this in musical
quality are all the songs sung
by groups onstage; like "Take
Back Your Mink," "Luck Be A
Lady," and "Sit Down, You're
Rocking the Boat." Next in

characterization is Nathan De
troit, who is acted in a manner
similar to a happy Abe Vigoda.
The impersonation of Miss
Adelaide is also as concisely
perfect as would ever be de
sired.
Technically, lighting was
done very well, but makeup
tended to be a mixture of fine
and grotesque faces. The sets,
which were only just barely
finished before the opening
performance, are colorfully
sincere; but cut the width of
the stage to the detriment of
the actors' passage, let alone
dancing. The sewer scene is
particularly fine with its grey
pipelike appearance. The alley
outside the Save-A-Soul Mis
sion is nicely painted too. Or

chestration is very good, al
though the brass outdoes
strings quite often during the
play. Scene changes, as usual
for the Palo Alto Community
Theatre, were difficult for the
crew and slow for the audi
ence.
Anyone desiring to see how
much better a musical is with
darn good costumes to aid it
are urged to attend one of the
continuing performances of
this drama. This play will be
presented at the Palo Alto
Community Theatre at 8:30 on
the evenings of March 16, 17,
18, 23, 24, 25, 30, 31 and April
Fool's Day; with matinees at
2:30 on the afternoons of the
19th and 26th of this month.

the stage to the detriment of
the actors' passage, let alone
dancing. The sewer scene is
particularly fine with its grey
pipelike appearance. The alley
outside the Save-A-Soul Mis
sion is nicely painted too. Or

chestration is very good, al
though the brass outdoes
strings quite often during the
play. Scene changes, as usual
for the Palo Alto Community
Theatre, were difficult for the
crew and slow for the audi
ence.
Anyone desiring to see how
much better a musical is with
darn good costumes to aid it
are urged to attend one of the
continuing performances of
this drama. This play will be
presented at the Palo Alto
Community Theatre at 8:30 on
the evenings of March 16, 17,
18, 23, 24, 25, 30, 31 and April
Fool's Day; with matinees at
2:30 on the afternoons of the
19th and 26th of this month.

Singer Michael Murphy will be appearing with America in an ASSU
special events concert Saturday April 1 in Frost Amphitheater. This is
he.
The Palo Alto Players' pro
duction of "Guys and Dolls,"
although having experienced a
post-performance period simi
lar to the Battle of Dunkirk, has
been resolved into a
wonderfully dazzling specta
cle of visual imagery. It's a sure
bet that this versionof the eter
nal musical of Swerlmg and
Burrows will draw packed
houses throughout its run. In
fact, ignoring all the other as
sets of this show temporarily,
the wonderful costumes alone
will undeniably prevent poor
audiences.
This play, based upon a story
and characters by Damon Ru
nyan, which most students will
recall from Rams Head's weak
attempt two years ago, deals

with the course of love amidst
the gambling of the oldest es
tablished floating crap game of
New York City.
The costume designer, Ellen
Chambers, has succeeded
through many hours of labor in
attiring the entire cast in such
exceptional clothes that she
has singlehandedly removed
all possibility of the show
bombing. The salvation army
uniforms are real. The suits of
the crapshooters remind
everyone of the Roaring Twen
ties, and so do the flapper-like
outfits of the Hot Box Dolls.
The bright Havana dancers'
outfits are even better than as
could be expected.
Although some of the cast
look hypnotically out at the

audience at times, their
onstage, intra-actor communi
cation is excellent on the
whole. It is a true pleasure to
see such a fine accumulation of
acting and singing talent in a
single show. Especially strong
is Daniel Marcus, whom we
fondly recall from Theat
reworks' "Oliver," as Nicely-
Nicely )onson.
Abe Vigoda
Markus, together with Rick
Lee perform the title song so
excellently that all others are
almost forgotten at the curtain
call. Following this in musical
quality are all the songs sung
by groups onstage; like "Take
Back Your Mink," "Luck Be A
Lady," and "Sit Down, You're
Rocking the Boat." Next in

characterization is Nathan De
troit, who is acted in a manner
similar to a happy Abe Vigoda.
The impersonation of Miss
Adelaide is also as concisely
perfect as would ever be de
sired.
Technically, lighting was
done very well, but makeup
tended to be a mixture of fine
and grotesque faces. The sets,
which were only just barely
finished before the opening
performance, are colorfully
sincere; but cut the width of
the stage to the detriment of
the actors' passage, let alone
dancing. The sewer scene is
particularly fine with its grey
pipelike appearance. The alley
outside the Save-A-Soul Mis
sion is nicely painted too. Or
