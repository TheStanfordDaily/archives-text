# Five students disciplined this year

### 
Five students have been discip
lined for Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard violations this
academic year, according to the Uni
versity's legal office.
However, in the only case heard by
the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC),
two students charged with imper
missible collaborations on a take
home examination were found not
guilty.
The SJC based its finding on "ex
treme ambiguity" regarding collab

oration on homework and exams in
the course. President Richard Lyman
concurred in the finding.
In the Fundamental Standard case,
a graduate student admitted to alter
ing grades on copies of his official
transcript and supplying the altered
copies to prospective employers.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
recommended suspension for one
term, and Lyman concurred.
The four remaining Honor Code
cases were heard by Lyons, whose

recommendations as to penalty were
affirmed by Lyman. In the first case, a
co-terminal senior who admitted to
violating the Honor Code by giving
unpermitted aid on a final examina
tion received a one-quarter delay in
the conferral of his degree.
In another case, a graduate stu
dent who admitted to the unpermit
ted use of notes during an in-class
final exam received a one-quarter
suspension and a grade of No Credit
for the exam.
