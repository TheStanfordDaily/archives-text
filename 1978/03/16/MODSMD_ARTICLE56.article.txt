# Columnist charges Carter with reversal
## 
### Matt Mettler 
President Jimmy Carter is "trying
to please the special interest groups
he campaigned to fight,"
Washington political reporter and
commentator Elizabeth Drew
claimed Monday night.
Drew delivered the Carlos
McClatchy Memorial Lecture before
a faculty-dominated audience in
Terman Auditorium.
We are approaching a "special in
terest state" as individual groups are
becoming more sophisticated and
powerful Drew said. She cited con
gressional subcommittees, divisions

of the bureaucracy, lobbyists and na
tional associations as special interest
groups.
Drew advised Carter to be more
independent of Congress because it
is particularly "tied down by interest
groups." She asserted there are
many people in Washington whose
business is to make friends, but you
have to pay a price for their support.
She also said special interest
groups are affecting federal budget
proposals because the administra
tion is fighting many of the relatively
small budget provisions inserted
originally to satisfy special interest

groups.
"If the amount is small it ain't
worth the trouble to get rid of it," she
said. "The same is true if the amount
is large."
Drew described a feeling of pro
secution that has overcome almost
every White House administration.
Carter's people worked very hard to
get to Washington and weren't ready
for what they found, she said.
Members of the White House staff
develop a strong feeling of self-pity
because they try their best to please
people and yet are still attacked by
Congress and the press, Drew said.
This tempts them to "lash back at
their tormentors," she maintained.
What staff personnel forget, Drew
explained, is that they are in a posi
tion of tremendous power. It is easy
for them to lose their perspective
and overreact.
Drew said Carter has some very in
telligent people working for him but
that many of them are inexperi
enced. "There is little chance for
them to learn on the job," she ad
ded.
She also said among Carter's staff
there is nobody with an exceptional
"feel" for government who can take
control and make the machinery of
government work.
Drew said she felt Carter should

not worry about pleasing Congress
because "Congress is always going
to be mad at the President."
Drew said she perceives the grow
ing feeling in Washington that Carter
must speak out firmly if he is going to
be a more effective president.
By taking his case to the American
public he would be able to generate
the force necessary to overcome
roadblocks in Congress, move ahead
on his promises of tax reform and
develop a national energy policy, she
contended.
Drew started her lecture with
some general observations about
politics in Washington. She claimed
that "to be seen to have power is to
have it and vice-versa."
She also said that people spend a
tremendous amount of time
speculating, looking for deeper
meanings to every event, and search
ing for the "flows of power."
She said Carter's supporters are
seriously concerned about a possible
challenge by Gov. Jerry Brown. She
pointed out that when Brown ran
against Carter in 1976, he won five of
six primaries.
Carter's campaign aides are aware
of the appeal of an "outsider," and
fear that in 1980 Brown will use that to
his advantage.
