# Affirmative action program: how much effort is enough?
## 
### Emily Sachar News analysis 
Affirmative action has a variety of
meanings for Stanford employees. Some
say the University has a progressive pol
icy that is being implemented effectively,
while others criticize the president for
not encouraging stronger affirmative ac
tion by University departments.
Affirmative action is an effort to recruit
qualified members of minority groups for
University jobs.
While minorities currently total 21 per
cent of the University's 4700 staff
employees and women total 62 per cent,
individual cases reveal dissatisfaction
with policies here.
Affirmative action is handled by indi
viduals throughout the University. The
Affirmative Action Office designs policy
goals and works "hand in glove" with the
Employment Office, but individual de
partments are responsible for actually hir
ing minorities.
With more than 200 specific depart
ments in the campus system, several
hundred persons make employment de
cisions regarding hiring, pay, promotion
and layoffs.
'Committed' departments
"The same departments that have al
ways been committed remain commit
ted," Keith Smith, assistant affirmative ac
tion officer, said. "But it's amazing how
unsophisticated some departments are,

for example, when it comes to complet
ing analyses."
Individual departments here analyze
their own affirmative action policies, then
turn in the results to the Affirmative Ac
tion Office for use in setting strategies
and evaluating goals, according to Smith.
One problem which evolves from this
circular structure is that minorities and
women frequently do not move up to
high level management positions, Smith
said.
There is a 5.8 per cent availability of
minorities in the manager, administrator
and officials category. Availability is an
index counting the number of people ina
certain census area who can perform a
designated task. Because the University's
minority population in this job category is
8 per cent (20 of 250 people), Smith says
the University is "meeting its goals in this
area."
Few top-level positions
But these figures do not show that few
of the 8 per cent are in top management
level positions, Maria Baeza, adviser to
the president for Chicano affairs, said.
Most occupy low and middle-level posi
tions, she said.
However Smith and others say adminis
trators are doing a good job encouraging
affirmative action.
"There's no denying that we don't have
minorities in top positions here, but one
thing people don't realize is that even if

we add a significant number of minorities
in a certain job category, statistically we
are not going to show a significant change
in the University," Smith said.
"That doesn't mean we stop. We just
have to be more realistic. It's difficult to
effect change. At least that's what I tell
myself when I get discouraged," he con
tinued.
Asst. Dean of Administration Paul
Johnson, who handles affirmative action
programs at the Graduate School of Busi
ness, says administrators here are paying
close attention to the need for hiring
minorities.
'Long-time task'
President Richard Lyman added, "It's a
long-time task. We've had some succes
ses and some failures. Our greatest
shortcomings have been at the top,
which is frustrating, but not surprising.
When everyone's trying to do affirmative
action at once, it becomes more difficult
to get people. It's bound to be a long time
before we have an even distribution in
job categories across the board."
Henry Organ, associate director of
foundations, is filing a grievance against
the University on his own behalf for "ar
bitrary removal of responsibilities sub
sequently given to a former colleague.
"I was moved down on the totem pole,
contrary to affirmative action. There has
been no significant representation of
blacksand other minorities in middle and

upper management positions in this Uni
versity," Organ said.
He said within his own office, in the last
four or five months, there were 13 or 14
opportunities to fill exempt positions.
None was given to a black, he said.
Exempt staff are those who are salaried
and are exempt from overtime pay.
Numerous opportunities
"There have simply been numerous
opportunities to change the complexion
of the University that haven't been made.
The president needs to be more forceful
and so does the Affirmative Action of
fice," Organ said.
Other employees, some of whom have
left the University, are also critical of the
University's hiring policies. Maria
Schneider resigned last year from her
position as senior employee coordinator,
because she felt "professional hiring ac
tivities here were minimal."
As part of her job, Schneider and
another individual were responsible for
recruiting qualified individuals for certain
University openings.
But Schneider said, even after their re
commendations, these qualified minority
individuals, were frequently not hired.
Schneider also cited a case in which she
recruited several chicanos for a post. Of
the six candidates, she said five were
well-qualified minorities. However, the
position was given to a non-minority
female who had few of the important

skills necessary for the job, according to
Schneider.
Recruitment procedures
Minority recruitment procedures are
another topic of concern and criticism.
When the Affirmative Action Office here
establishes new policies or goals, the Per
sonnel Office is notified so that its re
cruiters can implement the policies as
they search qualified applicant pools for
given jobs, according to Smith.
In the past, recruiters advertised to at
tract applicants. Now, career and place
ment offices have been more helpful in
tapping new community organizations in
the area, according to Virginia Gee, ad
ministrator of personnel recruitment.
But the establishment of a strong
minority applicant pool assures only part
of affirmative action's satisfaction, Gee
said. Next, minorities must be hired from
those extensive applicant pools.
"The bottom line in this discussion is
the actual hiring of minorities. Recruit
ment can be great . . . but the depart
ments simply have to hire more
minorities," Schneider said.
Baeza also said that minorities are not
the only individuals who must improve
affirmative action policies within the Uni
versity.
"A person like )ason Mavis at Plant Ser
vices, though a non-minority, believes so
strongly in affirmative action that his
labor force shows it," Baeza said.
