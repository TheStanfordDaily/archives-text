# Why study overseas?
## Consider the motivation 
###

The overseas experience. How can
you generalize about a program
which molds and shapes itself to the
goals, dreams, and actions of its par
ticipants? It is only possible to speak
from specific personal experience. If
you return from an overseas campus
and feel somehow that you missed
the challenge, either academic, per
sonal, or cultural, don't blame the
program. Look a little closer to
home; look inside to your own limi
tations, lack of motivation, or mis
placed goals.
A "Polly Anna" attitude concern
ing the overseas programs is not
realistic either. None of the prog
rams claims to be problem-free but
each program tends to be specific to
the particular program. What is true
for me at Tours may vary considera
bly from problems at Cliveden, Flor
ence or Vienna.
Culture shock
I arrived this January at the Tours
center with several misconceptions,
lots of expectations, and very few
clearcut goals. No one can fully pre
pare you for a foreign culture. The
Overseas Office at Stanford tries,
and according to some students at
Tours, succeeds. The panel discus
sions with students who havealready
experienced the culture shock
helped to provide the small but vital
clues to ease the immediate transi
tion. I missed all the discussions and
arrived unprepared.
After six weeks of struggling, fight
ing, thinking, coming and going, a
clearer picture about the purpose of
my personal experience is beginning
to emerge. Faced immediately with
all my classes taught in French, the
first priority I discovered was learn
ing the language. Some students,
however, don't treat this as a part of
the total educational experience.
If you want to speak English, don't
come to France. Learning the lan
guage is an integral part of learning
about the culture and living, rather
than surviving, in a foreign culture.
The opportunity for getting to
know firsthand, a culture different
from our own is readily available
here. Anne Durand, one of the assis

tant directors, does all she can to
provide opportunities for meals and
afternoon meetings with French
families. It is a unique chance to sit
around the dinner table with a family
of six and exchange information,
ideas and be initiated into one
another's cultures.
Perhapsthedoesn'tinterestyou. It
takes energy and interest to meet a
foreign family and try to communi
cate in a foreign language. It is much
easier to hop on a train to Spain;
altogether another valuable type of
learning experience.
Decide on purpose
If you come to an overseas campus
and have already mapped out a three
month tour of Europe with the idea
of spending as little time as possible
at the overseas campus â€” don't
bother to pay Stanford tuition for a
cultural experience that you will only
miss. I've traveled in France, spent a
week in Italy and plan to spend a
weekend in Switzerland, and a week
in Germany. It is possible tocombine
traveling and still benefit from the
"French" experience, but it's dif
ficult. Daily two-hour French classes
and limited absences underline the
nature of the overseas campus. Stan
ford in Tours is a university not a
base from which to travel. One of the
most important things to think about
before you arrive is the point of com
ing at all. Are you here to travel or to
be acquainted with the culture? Both
are possible and both are worth
while, but one has to give so that the
other can succeed.
Classes at Tours encompass the
same range of difficulty that you can
find in Palo Alto. For every student
who wants one, "the mick can be
found at any Stanford campus, in any
part of the world. The basic rule
holds true here, you get what you
want. If you are interested in learn
ing, the opportunity exists at Tours,
as rich and full an opportunity as you
will find anywhere. One unique qual
ity which sets foreign campus classes
apart from classes in Palo Alto, is the
proximity of the subject matter.
A class in current French politics
covers the events of the day. You

have the opportunity to learn and to
live the information that you are gain
ing. French art, history, poetry, all
offer the same chance, to experience
what you are learning. If France
doesn't interest you, don't come
here.
Learning outside class
Homework and classwork don't fill
every moment in Tours; much to the
contrary. In fact, that is one of the
basic elements of the program.
Much of the actual learning takes
place outside the classroom and un
structured time is provided to be fil
led by the individual. What you
choose to do with your time is your
own business. I can sit in the villa and
pretend I am back at Stanford or I can
go out in the street, tackle the open
fruit and vegetable market, or visit a
chateau. You don't have to buy a
beret and sing the Marseillaise but it
is necessary to leave your American
yardstick at home and begin to look
with a different perspective at a diffe
rent culture.
And bit by bit, the culture becomes
more familiar; it starts to slip under
your skin. The language becomes
easier, the blank stares begin to dis
appear every time you ask a ques
tion. I have begun to feel at home.
Most of the people who participate
in the program will recommend it as
a valuable opportunity. I do. Each of
us has our own particular reasons. It
is sometimes difficult to explain the
special moments and good times that
make it a rare and unique time.
Stanford offers you the overseas
experience, nicely wrapped and tied
with a bow, in the form of a center,
professors, administrators and living
arrangements. It is up to you, how
ever, to take the risk, open the box
and experience what it holds for you.
Sometimes it takes a little longer to
get through all the layers of cultural
wrappings, your expectations and
insecurities. The choice, however, is
a personal one. The most important
thing to remember about this ex
perience is that you only get out of it
what you are willing to put in.
