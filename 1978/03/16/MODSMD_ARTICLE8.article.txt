EDITOR'S NOTE - When a news
paper dies, few mourn its passing
more than those who worked for it.
What follows is one columnist's ex
pression of what the Chicago Daily
News meant to him.
Chicago (AP) —About the only
good thing that can be said for work
ing on a newspaper that folds is that it
is sort of like reading your own obit.
Since the official announcement
was made on Feb. 22 that the Chicago
Daily News would cease publication
on March 4, the nation's press has
been lamenting our demise.
We've been reading about how we
were one of America's oldest papers
(102 years), rich in tradition and
boasting of great staffs, past and pre
sent.
Most of the obits point out that the
Daily News had the nation's first
foreign service. It was a great one.
Over the years, it included such star
reporters as John Cunther, Edgar
Ansel Mowrer, Paul Scott Mowrer,
Keyes Beech, George Weller and Bill
Stoneman.
This was the paper that once
employed Carl Sandburg as a silent
movie critic. Ben Hecht worked here
and gathered the material for Front
Page, his classic play about the rough
house days of Chicago journalism.
The Daily News invented the daily
columnist.
Our 15 Pulitzer Prizes and count
less other awards put us right up
there with the best of papers.
The Daily News was doing inves
tigative reporting, and sending
politicians to jail, when Woodward
and Bernstein were toddlers.
Our Washington bureau, while
not big in number, was always re
spected. The late Ed Lahey was a liv
ing Washington legend.
Bureau Chief Peter Lisagor, who
died in 1976, was often described by
his peers as the best reporter in the
capital.
The recent staff was as good as its
ancestors. Pulitzers were owned by
cartoonist John Fischetti, associate
editor Lois Wille and Beech, lately of
the Washington staff. More than 50
books have been written by recent
Daily News writers.
Well, you read enough glowing
obits about yourself, and you can be
pardoned for thinking: "Boy, we
were really pretty good. ''
But then comes the inevitable
question: "Yeah? If we were that
good, how come we didn't make it?"
And that is the toughest part of
being on a 102-year-old, tradition
laden newspaper that goes under. If
it had been a cheap rag, its death
would have been easier to take. But
the Daily News, while it had some
bad days, was still one of the best
papers in this country.
The very day publisher Marshall
Field stood on a desk in the city room
to break the bad news, the paper was
notified that Lois Wille had won the

William Allen White award, the na
tion's top honor for excellence in
editorial writing.
In recent months it had dominated
the city's news coverage, with spec
tacular front-page exposes of politi
cal scandals. The talk in the news
room was about which story would
win a Pulitzer Prize — not whether
we'd win, but which one.
An indication of the staff's ability
was that within hours of Field's an
nouncement, editors from other
cities were flying to Chicago to set up
recruiting offices in nearby hotels.
Papers like the Los Angeles Times,
Washington Post, Dallas Times and
others snapped up talent. One re
porter found himself weighing offers
from the New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal and Forbes magazine.
An editor from Seattle flew in, of
fered jobs to two writers and said, "I
wish I could take back 25 of them."
Yes, it was fine paper and getting
better. John Justin Smith, who
started as a copy boy in 1937 and had
worked there 41 years as reporter,
writer, columnist, assistant city
editor, sports editor and travel
editor, said: "What hurts is that it is
as good or better right now than at
any time in my career."
But in the executive offices, where
the bottom line is what they read
first, the talk was about the slide in
circulation, the resultant loss of ad
vertising, and the growing deficit
which would reach $11 million in
1978, more than the other Field
paper, the profitable morning Sun-
Times could possibly earn.
And that is the puzzler. Why
couldn't a good newspaper make it?
Some say that any afternoon
newspaper faces hard times for a var
iety of reasons.
People say that expressways are a
factor. Twenty years ago, Chicago
didn't have any. Many more people
rode buses, subways, commuter
trains. Many bought an afternoon
paper on the way home. Now
Chicago has a network of express
ways. More suburban-bound driv
ers. Fewer rush-hour readers.
Most people used to live and work
in or near the city. It was easy to de
liver their paper or put a newsstand
on their street corner. Now more
people live and work in the suburbs
or beyond. Distribution is tougher.
Highly profitable suburban papers
now provide competition. But in the
city's black and Latin ghettos, there is
little interest in any newspaper.
And the competition is tough. The
Tribune is rich, powerful and aggres
sive. The Sun-Times is profitable and
a modern tabloid. Both are morning
papers, where the distribution ad
vantage is immeasurable.
All of these factors contributed to a
circulation drop at the Daily News
from about 550,000 in the late 1950s
to the final figure of about 315,000.
But there were other things, sel

dom mentioned by professional
press critics because they aren't as
easy to measure.
Courage, for example. There are
times when a paper can have too
much of it for its own economic
good. That, at times, was one of the
Daily News' problems.
In the early 19605, many papers
treated the civil rights movement
quite gingerly. The Daily News rec
ognized it as the most important
story in America. Nicholas Von
Hoffman, now a Washington colum
nist, but then a Daily News reporter,
wrote brilliant, pithy reports from
the South. When the civil rights
movement went north to Chicago,
the Daily News was just as aggressive
in reporting the racism of its own
city. The Daily News was far ahead of
any Chicago paper on this story.
All of which made the staff proud.
But it made many white readers an
gry. It was a story they didn't want to
know about. Almost every day the
circulation director would storm into
the news room and scream about
cancellations by white readers. The
editor told him to stay the hell away
from the reporters.
The irony was that the white read
ers quit in droves. But almost no
black readers joined.
In Chicago, Richard ). Daley was
mayor, boss, father figure, and the
most dominant politician in the city's
history. He was viewed with awe by
the establishment, common people,
and the Eastern press. By almost
everybody. In fact, except the Daily

News. During and after the 1968
Democratic Convention the Daily
News hit him hardest for his con
tribution to the chaos.
But most Chicagoans thought that
the splitting of protestor's heads in
Grant Park was great sport. So Daley
got votes while the Daily News lost
readers.
When the Cook Country state's at
torney's police raided Black Panther
headquarters and three black men
were killed, the official explanation
was that the police had fired in self
defense. The Daily news said
baloney and demanded an investiga
tion. The Daily News was proved
right, but more white readers, who
preferred police to Panthers, turned
away.
Courage didn't kill the Daily News,
but it undoubtedly shortened its life.
And so did apathy. In the Chicago
area, 1.6 million people will turn on
"Welcome Back Kotter." About 2.1
million watch "Charlie's Angels."
"Wonder Woman" draws $939,000.
There's a big market for mental cot
ton candy.
But out of 7 million who live in the
Daily News circulation area, only
315,000 of them thought one of the
better papers in America was worth
15 inflationary cents.
When a new dictator takes over a
country, one of the first things he
does is seize or close the newspap
ers.
Apathy isn't as heavy-handed as a
dictator. But it can get the same job
done.

much of it for its own economic
good. That, at times, was one of the
Daily News' problems.
In the early 19605, many papers
treated the civil rights movement
quite gingerly. The Daily News rec
ognized it as the most important
story in America. Nicholas Von
Hoffman, now a Washington colum
nist, but then a Daily News reporter,
wrote brilliant, pithy reports from
the South. When the civil rights
movement went north to Chicago,
the Daily News was just as aggressive
in reporting the racism of its own
city. The Daily News was far ahead of
any Chicago paper on this story.
All of which made the staff proud.
But it made many white readers an
gry. It was a story they didn't want to
know about. Almost every day the
circulation director would storm into
the news room and scream about
cancellations by white readers. The
editor told him to stay the hell away
from the reporters.
The irony was that the white read
ers quit in droves. But almost no
black readers joined.
In Chicago, Richard ). Daley was
mayor, boss, father figure, and the
most dominant politician in the city's
history. He was viewed with awe by
the establishment, common people,
and the Eastern press. By almost
everybody. In fact, except the Daily

News. During and after the 1968
Democratic Convention the Daily
News hit him hardest for his con
tribution to the chaos.
But most Chicagoans thought that
the splitting of protestor's heads in
Grant Park was great sport. So Daley
got votes while the Daily News lost
readers.
When the Cook Country state's at
torney's police raided Black Panther
headquarters and three black men
were killed, the official explanation
was that the police had fired in self
defense. The Daily news said
baloney and demanded an investiga
tion. The Daily News was proved
right, but more white readers, who
preferred police to Panthers, turned
away.
Courage didn't kill the Daily News,
but it undoubtedly shortened its life.
And so did apathy. In the Chicago
area, 1.6 million people will turn on
"Welcome Back Kotter." About 2.1
million watch "Charlie's Angels."
"Wonder Woman" draws $939,000.
There's a big market for mental cot
ton candy.
But out of 7 million who live in the
Daily News circulation area, only
315,000 of them thought one of the
better papers in America was worth
15 inflationary cents.
When a new dictator takes over a
country, one of the first things he
does is seize or close the newspap
ers.
Apathy isn't as heavy-handed as a

EDITOR'S NOTE - When a news
paper dies, few mourn its passing
more than those who worked for it.
What follows is one columnist's ex
pression of what the Chicago Daily
News meant to him.
Chicago (AP) —About the only
good thing that can be said for work
ing on a newspaper that folds is that it
is sort of like reading your own obit.
Since the official announcement
was made on Feb. 22 that the Chicago
Daily News would cease publication
on March 4, the nation's press has
been lamenting our demise.
We've been reading about how we
were one of America's oldest papers
(102 years), rich in tradition and
boasting of great staffs, past and pre
sent.
Most of the obits point out that the
Daily News had the nation's first
foreign service. It was a great one.
Over the years, it included such star
reporters as John Cunther, Edgar
Ansel Mowrer, Paul Scott Mowrer,
Keyes Beech, George Weller and Bill
Stoneman.
This was the paper that once
employed Carl Sandburg as a silent
movie critic. Ben Hecht worked here
and gathered the material for Front
Page, his classic play about the rough
house days of Chicago journalism.
The Daily News invented the daily
columnist.
Our 15 Pulitzer Prizes and count
less other awards put us right up
there with the best of papers.
The Daily News was doing inves
tigative reporting, and sending
politicians to jail, when Woodward
and Bernstein were toddlers.
Our Washington bureau, while
not big in number, was always re
spected. The late Ed Lahey was a liv
ing Washington legend.
Bureau Chief Peter Lisagor, who
died in 1976, was often described by
his peers as the best reporter in the
capital.
The recent staff was as good as its
ancestors. Pulitzers were owned by
cartoonist John Fischetti, associate
editor Lois Wille and Beech, lately of
the Washington staff. More than 50
books have been written by recent
Daily News writers.
Well, you read enough glowing
obits about yourself, and you can be
pardoned for thinking: "Boy, we
were really pretty good. ''
But then comes the inevitable
question: "Yeah? If we were that
good, how come we didn't make it?"
And that is the toughest part of
being on a 102-year-old, tradition
laden newspaper that goes under. If
it had been a cheap rag, its death
would have been easier to take. But
the Daily News, while it had some
bad days, was still one of the best
papers in this country.
The very day publisher Marshall
Field stood on a desk in the city room
to break the bad news, the paper was
notified that Lois Wille had won the

William Allen White award, the na
tion's top honor for excellence in
editorial writing.
In recent months it had dominated
the city's news coverage, with spec
tacular front-page exposes of politi
cal scandals. The talk in the news
room was about which story would
win a Pulitzer Prize — not whether
we'd win, but which one.
An indication of the staff's ability
was that within hours of Field's an
nouncement, editors from other
cities were flying to Chicago to set up
recruiting offices in nearby hotels.
Papers like the Los Angeles Times,
Washington Post, Dallas Times and
others snapped up talent. One re
porter found himself weighing offers
from the New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal and Forbes magazine.
An editor from Seattle flew in, of
fered jobs to two writers and said, "I
wish I could take back 25 of them."
Yes, it was fine paper and getting
better. John Justin Smith, who
started as a copy boy in 1937 and had
worked there 41 years as reporter,
writer, columnist, assistant city
editor, sports editor and travel
editor, said: "What hurts is that it is
as good or better right now than at
any time in my career."
But in the executive offices, where
the bottom line is what they read
first, the talk was about the slide in
circulation, the resultant loss of ad
vertising, and the growing deficit
which would reach $11 million in
1978, more than the other Field
paper, the profitable morning Sun-
Times could possibly earn.
And that is the puzzler. Why
couldn't a good newspaper make it?
Some say that any afternoon
newspaper faces hard times for a var
iety of reasons.
People say that expressways are a
factor. Twenty years ago, Chicago
didn't have any. Many more people
rode buses, subways, commuter
trains. Many bought an afternoon
paper on the way home. Now
Chicago has a network of express
ways. More suburban-bound driv
ers. Fewer rush-hour readers.
Most people used to live and work
in or near the city. It was easy to de
liver their paper or put a newsstand
on their street corner. Now more
people live and work in the suburbs
or beyond. Distribution is tougher.
Highly profitable suburban papers
now provide competition. But in the
city's black and Latin ghettos, there is
little interest in any newspaper.
And the competition is tough. The
Tribune is rich, powerful and aggres
sive. The Sun-Times is profitable and
a modern tabloid. Both are morning
papers, where the distribution ad
vantage is immeasurable.
All of these factors contributed to a
circulation drop at the Daily News
from about 550,000 in the late 1950s
to the final figure of about 315,000.
But there were other things, sel

dom mentioned by professional
press critics because they aren't as
easy to measure.
Courage, for example. There are
times when a paper can have too
much of it for its own economic
good. That, at times, was one of the
Daily News' problems.
In the early 19605, many papers

win a Pulitzer Prize — not whether
we'd win, but which one.
An indication of the staff's ability
was that within hours of Field's an
nouncement, editors from other
cities were flying to Chicago to set up
recruiting offices in nearby hotels.
Papers like the Los Angeles Times,
Washington Post, Dallas Times and
others snapped up talent. One re
porter found himself weighing offers
from the New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal and Forbes magazine.
An editor from Seattle flew in, of
fered jobs to two writers and said, "I
wish I could take back 25 of them."
Yes, it was fine paper and getting
better. John Justin Smith, who
started as a copy boy in 1937 and had
worked there 41 years as reporter,
writer, columnist, assistant city
editor, sports editor and travel
editor, said: "What hurts is that it is
as good or better right now than at
any time in my career."
But in the executive offices, where
the bottom line is what they read
first, the talk was about the slide in
circulation, the resultant loss of ad
vertising, and the growing deficit
which would reach $11 million in
1978, more than the other Field
paper, the profitable morning Sun-
Times could possibly earn.
And that is the puzzler. Why
couldn't a good newspaper make it?
Some say that any afternoon
newspaper faces hard times for a var
iety of reasons.
People say that expressways are a
factor. Twenty years ago, Chicago
didn't have any. Many more people
rode buses, subways, commuter
trains. Many bought an afternoon
paper on the way home. Now
Chicago has a network of express
ways. More suburban-bound driv
ers. Fewer rush-hour readers.
Most people used to live and work
in or near the city. It was easy to de
liver their paper or put a newsstand
on their street corner. Now more
people live and work in the suburbs
or beyond. Distribution is tougher.
Highly profitable suburban papers
now provide competition. But in the
city's black and Latin ghettos, there is
little interest in any newspaper.
And the competition is tough. The
Tribune is rich, powerful and aggres
sive. The Sun-Times is profitable and
a modern tabloid. Both are morning
papers, where the distribution ad
vantage is immeasurable.
All of these factors contributed to a
circulation drop at the Daily News
from about 550,000 in the late 1950s
to the final figure of about 315,000.
But there were other things, sel

dom mentioned by professional
press critics because they aren't as
easy to measure.
Courage, for example. There are
times when a paper can have too
much of it for its own economic
good. That, at times, was one of the
Daily News' problems.
In the early 19605, many papers
treated the civil rights movement
quite gingerly. The Daily News rec
ognized it as the most important
story in America. Nicholas Von
Hoffman, now a Washington colum
nist, but then a Daily News reporter,
wrote brilliant, pithy reports from
the South. When the civil rights
movement went north to Chicago,
the Daily News was just as aggressive
in reporting the racism of its own
city. The Daily News was far ahead of
any Chicago paper on this story.
All of which made the staff proud.
But it made many white readers an
gry. It was a story they didn't want to
know about. Almost every day the
circulation director would storm into
the news room and scream about
cancellations by white readers. The
editor told him to stay the hell away
from the reporters.
The irony was that the white read
ers quit in droves. But almost no
black readers joined.
In Chicago, Richard ). Daley was
mayor, boss, father figure, and the
most dominant politician in the city's
history. He was viewed with awe by
the establishment, common people,
and the Eastern press. By almost
everybody. In fact, except the Daily

News. During and after the 1968
Democratic Convention the Daily
News hit him hardest for his con
tribution to the chaos.
But most Chicagoans thought that
the splitting of protestor's heads in
Grant Park was great sport. So Daley
got votes while the Daily News lost
readers.
When the Cook Country state's at
torney's police raided Black Panther
headquarters and three black men
were killed, the official explanation
was that the police had fired in self
defense. The Daily news said
baloney and demanded an investiga
tion. The Daily News was proved
right, but more white readers, who
preferred police to Panthers, turned
away.
Courage didn't kill the Daily News,
but it undoubtedly shortened its life.
And so did apathy. In the Chicago
area, 1.6 million people will turn on
"Welcome Back Kotter." About 2.1
million watch "Charlie's Angels."
"Wonder Woman" draws $939,000.
There's a big market for mental cot
ton candy.
But out of 7 million who live in the
Daily News circulation area, only
315,000 of them thought one of the
better papers in America was worth
15 inflationary cents.
When a new dictator takes over a
country, one of the first things he
does is seize or close the newspap
ers.
Apathy isn't as heavy-handed as a

EDITOR'S NOTE - When a news
paper dies, few mourn its passing

What follows is one columnist's ex
pression of what the Chicago Daily
News meant to him.
Chicago (AP) —About the only
good thing that can be said for work
ing on a newspaper that folds is that it
is sort of like reading your own obit.
Since the official announcement
was made on Feb. 22 that the Chicago
Daily News would cease publication
on March 4, the nation's press has
been lamenting our demise.
We've been reading about how we
were one of America's oldest papers
(102 years), rich in tradition and
boasting of great staffs, past and pre
sent.
Most of the obits point out that the
Daily News had the nation's first
foreign service. It was a great one.
Over the years, it included such star
reporters as John Cunther, Edgar
Ansel Mowrer, Paul Scott Mowrer,
Keyes Beech, George Weller and Bill
Stoneman.
This was the paper that once
employed Carl Sandburg as a silent
movie critic. Ben Hecht worked here
and gathered the material for Front
Page, his classic play about the rough
house days of Chicago journalism.
The Daily News invented the daily
columnist.
Our 15 Pulitzer Prizes and count
less other awards put us right up
there with the best of papers.
The Daily News was doing inves
tigative reporting, and sending
politicians to jail, when Woodward
and Bernstein were toddlers.
Our Washington bureau, while
not big in number, was always re
spected. The late Ed Lahey was a liv
ing Washington legend.
Bureau Chief Peter Lisagor, who
died in 1976, was often described by
his peers as the best reporter in the
capital.
The recent staff was as good as its
ancestors. Pulitzers were owned by
cartoonist John Fischetti, associate
editor Lois Wille and Beech, lately of
the Washington staff. More than 50
books have been written by recent
Daily News writers.
Well, you read enough glowing
obits about yourself, and you can be
pardoned for thinking: "Boy, we
were really pretty good. ''
But then comes the inevitable
question: "Yeah? If we were that
good, how come we didn't make it?"
And that is the toughest part of
being on a 102-year-old, tradition
laden newspaper that goes under. If
it had been a cheap rag, its death
would have been easier to take. But
the Daily News, while it had some
bad days, was still one of the best
papers in this country.
The very day publisher Marshall
Field stood on a desk in the city room
to break the bad news, the paper was
notified that Lois Wille had won the

William Allen White award, the na
tion's top honor for excellence in
editorial writing.
In recent months it had dominated
the city's news coverage, with spec
tacular front-page exposes of politi
cal scandals. The talk in the news
room was about which story would
win a Pulitzer Prize — not whether
we'd win, but which one.
An indication of the staff's ability
was that within hours of Field's an
nouncement, editors from other
cities were flying to Chicago to set up
recruiting offices in nearby hotels.
Papers like the Los Angeles Times,
Washington Post, Dallas Times and
others snapped up talent. One re
porter found himself weighing offers

ing on a newspaper that folds is that it
is sort of like reading your own obit.
Since the official announcement
was made on Feb. 22 that the Chicago
Daily News would cease publication
on March 4, the nation's press has
been lamenting our demise.
We've been reading about how we
were one of America's oldest papers
(102 years), rich in tradition and
boasting of great staffs, past and pre
sent.
Most of the obits point out that the
Daily News had the nation's first
foreign service. It was a great one.
Over the years, it included such star
reporters as John Cunther, Edgar
Ansel Mowrer, Paul Scott Mowrer,
Keyes Beech, George Weller and Bill
Stoneman.
This was the paper that once
employed Carl Sandburg as a silent
movie critic. Ben Hecht worked here
and gathered the material for Front
Page, his classic play about the rough
house days of Chicago journalism.
The Daily News invented the daily
columnist.
Our 15 Pulitzer Prizes and count
less other awards put us right up
there with the best of papers.
The Daily News was doing inves
tigative reporting, and sending
politicians to jail, when Woodward
and Bernstein were toddlers.
Our Washington bureau, while
not big in number, was always re
spected. The late Ed Lahey was a liv
ing Washington legend.
Bureau Chief Peter Lisagor, who
died in 1976, was often described by
his peers as the best reporter in the
capital.
The recent staff was as good as its
ancestors. Pulitzers were owned by
cartoonist John Fischetti, associate
editor Lois Wille and Beech, lately of
the Washington staff. More than 50
books have been written by recent
Daily News writers.
Well, you read enough glowing
obits about yourself, and you can be
pardoned for thinking: "Boy, we
were really pretty good. ''
But then comes the inevitable
question: "Yeah? If we were that
good, how come we didn't make it?"
And that is the toughest part of
being on a 102-year-old, tradition
laden newspaper that goes under. If
it had been a cheap rag, its death
would have been easier to take. But
the Daily News, while it had some
bad days, was still one of the best
papers in this country.
The very day publisher Marshall
Field stood on a desk in the city room
to break the bad news, the paper was
notified that Lois Wille had won the

William Allen White award, the na
tion's top honor for excellence in
editorial writing.
In recent months it had dominated
the city's news coverage, with spec
tacular front-page exposes of politi
cal scandals. The talk in the news
room was about which story would
win a Pulitzer Prize — not whether
we'd win, but which one.
An indication of the staff's ability
was that within hours of Field's an
nouncement, editors from other
cities were flying to Chicago to set up
recruiting offices in nearby hotels.
Papers like the Los Angeles Times,
Washington Post, Dallas Times and
others snapped up talent. One re
porter found himself weighing offers
from the New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal and Forbes magazine.
An editor from Seattle flew in, of
fered jobs to two writers and said, "I
wish I could take back 25 of them."
Yes, it was fine paper and getting
better. John Justin Smith, who
started as a copy boy in 1937 and had
worked there 41 years as reporter,
writer, columnist, assistant city
editor, sports editor and travel
editor, said: "What hurts is that it is
as good or better right now than at
any time in my career."
But in the executive offices, where
the bottom line is what they read
first, the talk was about the slide in
circulation, the resultant loss of ad
vertising, and the growing deficit
which would reach $11 million in
1978, more than the other Field
paper, the profitable morning Sun-
Times could possibly earn.
And that is the puzzler. Why
couldn't a good newspaper make it?
Some say that any afternoon
newspaper faces hard times for a var
iety of reasons.
People say that expressways are a
factor. Twenty years ago, Chicago
didn't have any. Many more people
rode buses, subways, commuter
trains. Many bought an afternoon
paper on the way home. Now
Chicago has a network of express
ways. More suburban-bound driv
ers. Fewer rush-hour readers.
Most people used to live and work
in or near the city. It was easy to de
liver their paper or put a newsstand
on their street corner. Now more
people live and work in the suburbs
or beyond. Distribution is tougher.
Highly profitable suburban papers
now provide competition. But in the
city's black and Latin ghettos, there is
little interest in any newspaper.
And the competition is tough. The
Tribune is rich, powerful and aggres
sive. The Sun-Times is profitable and
a modern tabloid. Both are morning
papers, where the distribution ad
vantage is immeasurable.
All of these factors contributed to a
circulation drop at the Daily News
from about 550,000 in the late 1950s
to the final figure of about 315,000.
But there were other things, sel

dom mentioned by professional
press critics because they aren't as
easy to measure.
Courage, for example. There are
times when a paper can have too
much of it for its own economic
good. That, at times, was one of the
Daily News' problems.
In the early 19605, many papers
treated the civil rights movement
quite gingerly. The Daily News rec
ognized it as the most important
story in America. Nicholas Von
Hoffman, now a Washington colum
nist, but then a Daily News reporter,
wrote brilliant, pithy reports from
the South. When the civil rights
movement went north to Chicago,
the Daily News was just as aggressive
in reporting the racism of its own
city. The Daily News was far ahead of
any Chicago paper on this story.
All of which made the staff proud.
But it made many white readers an
gry. It was a story they didn't want to
know about. Almost every day the
circulation director would storm into
the news room and scream about
cancellations by white readers. The
editor told him to stay the hell away
from the reporters.
The irony was that the white read
ers quit in droves. But almost no
black readers joined.
In Chicago, Richard ). Daley was
mayor, boss, father figure, and the
most dominant politician in the city's
history. He was viewed with awe by
the establishment, common people,
and the Eastern press. By almost
everybody. In fact, except the Daily

News. During and after the 1968
Democratic Convention the Daily
News hit him hardest for his con
tribution to the chaos.
But most Chicagoans thought that
the splitting of protestor's heads in
Grant Park was great sport. So Daley
got votes while the Daily News lost
readers.
When the Cook Country state's at
torney's police raided Black Panther
headquarters and three black men
were killed, the official explanation
was that the police had fired in self
defense. The Daily news said
baloney and demanded an investiga
tion. The Daily News was proved
right, but more white readers, who
preferred police to Panthers, turned
away.
Courage didn't kill the Daily News,
but it undoubtedly shortened its life.
And so did apathy. In the Chicago
area, 1.6 million people will turn on
"Welcome Back Kotter." About 2.1
million watch "Charlie's Angels."
"Wonder Woman" draws $939,000.
There's a big market for mental cot
ton candy.
But out of 7 million who live in the
Daily News circulation area, only
315,000 of them thought one of the
better papers in America was worth
15 inflationary cents.
When a new dictator takes over a
country, one of the first things he
does is seize or close the newspap
ers.
Apathy isn't as heavy-handed as a
dictator. But it can get the same job
done.
