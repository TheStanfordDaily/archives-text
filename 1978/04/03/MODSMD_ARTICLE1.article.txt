# German Studies House to replace Androgyny House

### Mike Charlson 
Citing concerns about the quality of the academic
program and the lack of house leadership, Director of
Residential Education Norm Robinson has decided not
to continue the Androgyny House program next year.
The decision was announced by Robinson in a letter to
residents March 21.
Next fall the Jordan House at 620 Mayfield will house a
German Studies Theme House, Haus Mitteleuropa.
Robinson said in his letter, "there has been a lack of
coherence and specificity" in planning for the academic
program this year.
"It took them a long time to figure out what they
wanted to do this year," Robinson said. "We've seen
nothing to make us think it would be less of a problem
next year."
Robinson said he felt some of the house's problems
stemmed from the fact that the house was a co
operative. "I don't believe a strong theme house and a
co-op are compatible. Each requires a great deal of time.
It's hard to focus in on all the important thirtgs that need
to be done for each."
Robinson said that while the decision to discontinue
the program was made only a few weeks ago, concern
over the program was not new. He said even the config
uration panel which last year approved the Androgyny
Theme House concept had expressed concern "about
the amount and quality of the academic content of the
house's program."
Mike Shuman, a junior living in the house, said Robin
son's reasons for terminating the theme house were
"pretty petty."
"The housing office never understood why this house
was here," he said. "Norm Robinson and (Row Director)
Karen Harrison don't know what feminism means. The
people in this house took feminist classes and that has
no academic relevance to them. Much of what we did

had a lot of academic relevance."
Shuman said most houses in the past have been given
two years before termination. "We're the first that I
know of to go after one year," he said.
Shuman said he felt the housing office had "the wrong
expectations from the house" and forced them to meet
an "unusually stringent set of criteria" in the evaluation
of the house.
Robinson said his decision was "not to say that good
things weren't going on in the house. It just wasn't the
house that the (configuration) panel approved."
He said the house approved "was to be an academic
look at questions dealing with sex roles."
Phil Deßerardinis, a senior involved in the organiza
tion of the house, said he felt there was no "uniform
standard of scrutiny" in the University's assessment of
theme houses.
"The amount of time spent here and the value to the
members of the experience is just above and beyond
anything" at other theme houses, Deßerardinis said.
He said most members had gone out of their way to be
"productive co-op members" and that living in the
house had been a "learning experience— not strictly an
academic experience."
The decision was made to satisfy "two or three
people's fiefdoms," Deßerardinis said. "Selling crepes
and pizzas seems to be more in tune with the housing
office's idea of an academic experience than what we
were doing," he said.
Carla Lupi, a junior living in Androgyny House, said
members of the house will meet to discuss the future of
the house this week. Lupi indicated she believed the
house had little chance of success in appealing the deci
sion to the University and said she felt the members
should strive for a "full blossoming of the theme."
She said she thought there was "a lot higher criteria


The question mark above the door at Jordan house, 620
Mayfield, was to demonstrate an inability of residents of
Androgyny House to settle on a name for their home. The

answer was given for them as the theme program was
discontinued for next year. A German Studies house will
replace it.
