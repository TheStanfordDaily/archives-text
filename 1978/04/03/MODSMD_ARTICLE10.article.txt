# Mentally ill stricken by myths

We live on an enlightened cam
pus, or so it would seem from the
many groups which are active in
support of some facet of human
rights. Yet there is one segment of
our society whose rights are ignored
and whose plight is largely unnoticed
by the populace. Its members cut ac
ross all boundaries of race, crfced and
sex; indeed, you may one day be
committed to its ranks. The group of
which I speak comes under the title
of the "mentally disturbed" or "men
tally ill."

In this country we have a great
stigma associated with the "mentally
ill," yet most of us have little concept
of what that term means. And the
facts can be frightening, especially
where the law is concerned. Dr.
Thomas Szasz in his book, The Myth
of Mental Illness, has noted that the
average length of court proceeding
to commit someone to a mental in
stitution was less than 10 minutes.
The truth is that if your family at some
future date decides to "put you
away," they can do it, and there is
almost nothing that you can do to
stop them.
What rights do you have if you are
deemed to be among the ranks of the
"mentally ill"? Precious few. You
lose freedom of movement; they
lock you up. You lose your property
rights; these revert to your relatives.
You lose your freedom of choice;
they can inject you with mind
altering drugs, subject you to shock
treatment, behavior modification,
and other equally horrendous kinds
of "therapy." In short, once you be
come a "mental patient," you lose
your right to control your life.
But what is "mental illness"? To
answer this question you might be
tempted to ask a psychiatrist. Yet get
ting psychiatrists to agree on the
answer is about as easy as getting
them to agree on what mental disor
der you might have. Several studies
have demonstrated that much diag
nosis is haphazard at best.
Faced with such data, many
psychiatrists will simply point out
that the human mind is an incredibly
complex device, so that diagnosis is
difficult. Yet there is another theory
which is quite appealing. The theory
is largely the brainchild of the
above-mentioned Szasz. Szasz
claims that there is really no such
thing as "mental illness," short of
recognizable brain tumors or other

such truly medical disorders.
just because someone thinks or
acts differently is not a valid reason to
take away his/her rights by labeling
them "mentally ill" and committing
them to an institution against their
will. As long as they don't directly
violate someone else's rights by acts
of violence or stealing, etc., then
they ought to have the freedom to be
different. Moreover, to label certain
types of behavior as "mental illness"
is terribly demeaning, independent
of the legal aspects of the problem.
Is there no group willing to defend
the rights of mental patients? One

would think that the American Civil
Liberties Union would be active in
this field, but this is not so. The ACLU
advocates "civil commitment" for
the "mentally ill." They do have a set
of guidelines, but these are sorely
insufficient, amounting to tacit ac
ceptance of most of the present sys
tem's inequities. In fact, the only
group which consistently recognizes
and supports the human rights of
these people is the libertarian
movement.
