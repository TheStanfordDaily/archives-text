# Slowly but surely
## Conversion to metrics continues 
### Associated Press 
The government has taken
another step toward metrics,
but the United States still has
kilometers to go to complete
the switch to the measuring
system used by most of the rest
of the world.
Representatives of industry
and government, hoping to
speed things up, are gathering
in Atlanta to present plans
worked out to help major U.S.
industries convert operations
to metrics.
The occasion is the fourth

annual conference of the
American National Metric
Council, a nonprofit organiza
tion of more than 300 trade and
technical organizations and
over 400 companies. The con
ference opened yesterday and
runs through Wednesday.
The Metric Conversion Act
of December 1975, designed to
encourage the voluntary,
gradual switch to metrics, cal
led for creation of a 17-member
U.S. Metric Board to help plan
conversion, conduct research
and educate the public.

Former President Gerald
Ford submitted nominations
for the panel in 1976, but Con
gress adjourned without act
ing. It was not until March 21
that the Senate confirmed Pres
ident jimmy Carter's appoint
ments.
Some metric programs al
ready are under way:
—Officials in 30 states have
taken formal action to intro
duce the metric system in their
schools. The federal govern
ment has awarded grants and
contracts of over $4 million to

teach metrics.
—Wines and liquors are sold
in metric containers as well as
in the traditional fifths, quarts,
etc. By 1980, the industry will
have switched to metrics com
pletely.
—Food companies are be
ginning to use metrics.
—Over half the largest com
panies in the United States are
planning for or are already im
plementing metrics, according
to the metric council.
There also have been set
backs:
—The Federal Highway Ad
ministration, faced with public
opposition, shelved a program
to convert road signs to metrics
by Dec. 31, 1979.
—The National Weather Ser
vice postponed from July 1978
to July 1979 the substitution of
the metric Celsius system for
Fahrenheit. The delay will
allow the newly created Metric
Board to get to work.
The United States isn't the
only country where the con
version has been slow.
About a year ago, the British
government announced a
timetable for converting the
country to total metrication by
1982. The government stres
sed, however, that the timeta
ble was not rigid and promised
that all interested parties
would be consulted before
changes were made.
