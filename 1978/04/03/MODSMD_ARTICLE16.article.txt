# Diesel VW wins mpg war
## 
### 
Washington (AP)â€”The new automotive
mileage champion is the diesel-powered Vol
kswagon Rabbit, but the Honda Civic and the
Datsuri 8210 tied tor most economic automobile
using gasoline, government figures show.
The diesel-powered Volkswagon Rabbit costs
more than a gasoline model, but it can still save
you money if you drive it more than about 22,000
miles.
The EPA's tests show that the diesel Rabbit
gets 40 miles per gallon in city driving and 53
mpg on the highway for an overall weighted
average of 45 mpg.
When the government calculates the average
mileage, it gives more weight to city driving than
highway driving because more driving is done in
cities.
However, the Honda Civic and the Datsun
8210 shared the honor of having the best

mileage among cars fueled with gasoline. The
Civic had been rated No. 1 in 1977. It achieved 36
mpg in city driving and 44 mpg on the highway
for a combined average of 40 mpg.
The only other auto to acieve an average of 40
mpg or more was the gasoline-powered Datsun
8210, which averaged 36 mpg in city driving and
48 mpg on the highway.
Despite the slight mileage discrepancy, the
Civic and the 8210 finished in the tie when
city-vs-highway driving was taken into account.
Bringing up the bottom of the list were several
large cars, some used tor high-performance
police work, which clocked in with weighted
average mileages of 11 mpg.
These included the Cadillac Eldorado, Dodge
Monaco, Plymouth Fury, Cadillac Limousine
and two varieties of the Rolls-Royce Bentley.
