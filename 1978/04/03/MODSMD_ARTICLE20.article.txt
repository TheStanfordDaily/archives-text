# Cardinal tracksters get second at Stanford Invitationals then...

### Bruce Anderson 
Stanford track coach Payton Jordan decided that this year the
Stanford Invitational Relays, held March 18, would stress the
team competition by scoring the meet and making each relay
event worth twice as many points as each individual event. Jordan
said this would give the Invitational greater fan appeal.
Not so strangely enough, the change in the meet format came
about concurrently with a rise in the prowess of Stanford's own
relay foursomes. To win the Invitational, it was figured that the
Cardinals would have to win all of the relays.
Stanford did not win all of the relays. And the Cards did not win
the Invitational. San Jose State did.
But Stanford did win three of the five relay events, setting three
meet records in the process, edged out Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
and California for second place, and christened its new Tartan
track by shattering the school record for the 1600-meter relay in
the last running event of the day.
For openers
With near perfect stick work, the Cardinals scorched the 400-
meter relay field as Darrin Nelson, Alan Sheats, Cordon Banks
and James Lofton circled the track in 39.7, beating runnerup San
Jose State which had hoped to atone for an earlier loss to the Card
foursome.
Things continued perfectly for the Cards as Lofton and Nelson
finished one-two in the long jump, Lofton winning his fourth
consecutive Invitational long jump crown with a leap of 25-7.
Freshmen Mark Stillman and Tom Lobsinger paced Stanford's
distance medley relay team (440-880-1320-mile) to a narrow vic
tory over Cal Poly. Stillman blazed through his three-lap leg in
2:56.2 and handed Lobsinger the baton and the lead. The Cana
dian freshman then churned four laps in 4:06.5 to hold off Cal
Poly's Dan Aldridgeand give the Cards their second relay victory.
Lobsinger broke the school frosh standard for the mile the next
week with a 4:06.2 clocking at the San Jose Relays.
Stanford, leading the meet after the first two relays, met with
disappointment in the next two.
A bad pass between Nelson and Sheats cost the Cards a possi
ble victory in the 880 relay. And running without senior Dave
Wells, who withdrew because of illness, the two-mile relay
finished a far-removed fifth.
The Cards, seeking to assuage the embarrassment of the 880
relay, came together in the 1600 meter relay with one of the
fastest times in the world this year, a blistering 3:06.6.
Paul McCarthy, running for the injured Tom Shellworth, ran a
48.8 opening leg, then passed to Banks. The sophomore from Los
Angeles chased San Jose's Lionel Foster and was on his heels by
the time he passed to Sheats. Running his best relay leg ever,

Sheats passed Spartan Marlin Rochee on the back straightaway
and passed the lead on to Lofton.
Lofton, competing in his fourth event of the day, beat Dedy
Cooper around the track with a brilliant 44.8 anchor leg.
"On the far side of the track I heard some one say, 'Run your
own Race, Dedy,' " Lofton said. "I know what that means when
someone says it to me: to relax your stride. As soon as he did that,
I picked up two yards."
And while Stanford earned its big points in the relays, it was the
third-, fourth- and fifth-place finishes that allowed the Cards to
slip by Cal Poly and Cal for second.
Freshman Tom O'Neil finished third in the 10,000 meters in
30:46.4 while Stanford junior Roy Kissin finished third in the 5000
with a 14:27.2 clocking. Cardinal Rick Buss finished third in the
discus throw with a toss of 168 feet.
Freshman Ken Margerum recorded a lifetime best of 14.4 in the
110-meter high hurdles to finish in a tie for fourth.
Hammer thrower Chuck Weidmann, triple jumper Clay
Bullwinkel and Steepler Bill Cail all finished fifth to pick up points
for the Cards.

Stanford, leading the meet after the first two relays, met with
disappointment in the next two.
A bad pass between Nelson and Sheats cost the Cards a possi
ble victory in the 880 relay. And running without senior Dave
Wells, who withdrew because of illness, the two-mile relay
finished a far-removed fifth.
The Cards, seeking to assuage the embarrassment of the 880
relay, came together in the 1600 meter relay with one of the
fastest times in the world this year, a blistering 3:06.6.
Paul McCarthy, running for the injured Tom Shellworth, ran a
48.8 opening leg, then passed to Banks. The sophomore from Los
Angeles chased San Jose's Lionel Foster and was on his heels by
the time he passed to Sheats. Running his best relay leg ever,

Sheats passed Spartan Marlin Rochee on the back straightaway
and passed the lead on to Lofton.
Lofton, competing in his fourth event of the day, beat Dedy
Cooper around the track with a brilliant 44.8 anchor leg.
"On the far side of the track I heard some one say, 'Run your
own Race, Dedy,' " Lofton said. "I know what that means when
someone says it to me: to relax your stride. As soon as he did that,
I picked up two yards."
And while Stanford earned its big points in the relays, it was the
third-, fourth- and fifth-place finishes that allowed the Cards to
slip by Cal Poly and Cal for second.
Freshman Tom O'Neil finished third in the 10,000 meters in
30:46.4 while Stanford junior Roy Kissin finished third in the 5000
with a 14:27.2 clocking. Cardinal Rick Buss finished third in the
discus throw with a toss of 168 feet.
Freshman Ken Margerum recorded a lifetime best of 14.4 in the
110-meter high hurdles to finish in a tie for fourth.
Hammer thrower Chuck Weidmann, triple jumper Clay
Bullwinkel and Steepler Bill Cail all finished fifth to pick up points
for the Cards.

Lofton was a key figure in the Cards' efforts at the Stanford Invita
tional meet, competing in the long jump and anchoring two relays.
Stanford track coach Payton Jordan decided that this year the
Stanford Invitational Relays, held March 18, would stress the
team competition by scoring the meet and making each relay
event worth twice as many points as each individual event. Jordan
said this would give the Invitational greater fan appeal.
Not so strangely enough, the change in the meet format came
about concurrently with a rise in the prowess of Stanford's own
relay foursomes. To win the Invitational, it was figured that the
Cardinals would have to win all of the relays.
Stanford did not win all of the relays. And the Cards did not win
the Invitational. San Jose State did.
But Stanford did win three of the five relay events, setting three
meet records in the process, edged out Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
and California for second place, and christened its new Tartan
track by shattering the school record for the 1600-meter relay in
the last running event of the day.
For openers
With near perfect stick work, the Cardinals scorched the 400-
meter relay field as Darrin Nelson, Alan Sheats, Cordon Banks
and James Lofton circled the track in 39.7, beating runnerup San
Jose State which had hoped to atone for an earlier loss to the Card
foursome.
Things continued perfectly for the Cards as Lofton and Nelson
finished one-two in the long jump, Lofton winning his fourth
consecutive Invitational long jump crown with a leap of 25-7.
Freshmen Mark Stillman and Tom Lobsinger paced Stanford's
distance medley relay team (440-880-1320-mile) to a narrow vic
tory over Cal Poly. Stillman blazed through his three-lap leg in
2:56.2 and handed Lobsinger the baton and the lead. The Cana
dian freshman then churned four laps in 4:06.5 to hold off Cal
Poly's Dan Aldridgeand give the Cards their second relay victory.
Lobsinger broke the school frosh standard for the mile the next
week with a 4:06.2 clocking at the San Jose Relays.
