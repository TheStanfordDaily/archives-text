# ... lose to USC

### Bruce Anderson 
It was a meet of no surprises Saturday in Los Angeles.
Like the kids with the PF Flyers, the USC Trojans ran faster and
jumped further than Stanford while trouncing the Cardinals,
111-39.
"The meet went about as we expected," Stanford track coach
Payton Jordan said. "They have great strength and depth and
competed awfully well.
"We had no surprises," Jordan said. "Everyone ran true to
form."
For USC everything went true to form also: the Trojans
dominating the meet from beginning to end, winning 16 of 18
events.
The sole winners for the Cards were James Lofton, who de
feated defending NCAA long jump titlist Larry Doubley with a
25-9 j /4 leap, and Roy Kissin, who broke the tape in the 5000 meters
with a 14:27.2 victory.
Lofton finished second in the2oo meters behind Southern Cal's
Clancy Williams, the No. 1 200-meter man in the United States last
year, with a 20.9 clocking. The Stanford Ail-American closed the
day with a 45.24 anchor lap in the mile relay. Lofton made up all
but three yards of a 15-yard deficit to USC's James Sanford.
Stanford freshmen showed a taste for competition with the
team that everyone expects to capture its 27th NCAA track and
field title come June.
Freshman hurdler Ken Margerum picked up second-place
points for the Cardinals in both the highs and the intermediates.
Running the 400 intermediate hurdles for the first time,
Margerum recorded a 55.3 lap.
"Margerum ran exceptionally well for the first time in the
intermediates," Jordan said. "His was the most encouraging per
formance of the meet.
"He looks like a sensational intermediate hurdler. He changed
steps smoothly in the middle of the race. He showed good
rhythm all the way around," Jordan added.
Freshmen Mark Stillman and Tom Lobsinger finished two-three
in the 1500 meters behind Trojan veteran David Omwansa. Tom
O'Neil finished third in the 5000 with a 14:43.9 mark, while
freshman teammate Darrin Nelson jumped 24-BVi to place third in
the long jump.
