# Coaching gymnasts: hard work and a sense of humor
## Hamada stresses 100 per cent effort but enjoys a little fun, too 
### Cheryl Zollars 
He stands in the center of the
trampoline, silent, muscles
poised and taut. Then, bounc
ing twice for momentum, he
executes a graceful back flip,
completing a full twist in mid
air.
"Hey — not bad for 48!"
Sadao Hamada, unruffled,
chuckles. Glancing briefly at
his critic, Stanford's soccer
coach Nelson Lodge, he re
turns his gaze to the gym
nasium where the Stanford
varsity gymnastics team is
working out. Satisfied, he does
three more flip-twists in suc
cession — smoothly and seem
ingly effortlessly.
At 31, Hamada does not look
like a stereotypical gymnastics
coach. In place of the usual
tank shirt and shorts, he wears
gym shoes, long grey sweat

pants, a long sleeved blue and
white striped shirt and a rib
bed, zippered sweater.
He also does not act quite as
one might expect. Standing on
the trampoline's rim, he does
not bark instructions or criti
cisms. Instead, he directs
someone across the room by
motioning with his leg. When
words are necessary, he calls a
gymnast over to him to avoid
cross-gym discussion.
When words are just for
conversation, he displays an
easy, bantering tone with the
gymnasts, "O.K. guys. . .
This is Hamada's sixth sea
son as Stanford's varsity men's
coach. He came to the Univer
sity in September of 1972, after
receiving a masters in educa
tion from Kent State, where he
had served as an assistant
coach.

Born in Kochi, Japan, he
grew up in a farm family and
began formal gymnastics at 15,
starting competition in that
same year. It had all begun a
year earlier when a friend
taught him how to do a back
handspring.
"That was only a 10 minute
lesson — so I learned it pretty
well, I was doing it all by my
self," Hamada said. "I was so
excited I wanted to show off to
my parents. I went back home
and did it exactly the same way
— and I crashed!"
Hamada went to high school
for mechanical engineering, a
high school that also happened
to have the best gymnastics
program of all of Japan's high
schools.
He made the Japanese na
tional team as a junior at Nip
pon College of Health and

Physical Education, where he
majored in physical education,
minored in education and
specialized in gymnastics,
graduating in 1969.
In the United States, he
finished second all-around in
the National Senior AAU
Championships in 1970 and
1971, and he won the United
States Gymnastics Federation
side horse competition in 1972,
while placing third all-around
in USCF and AAU meets.
His office reflects his quiet,
simple style. Papers are scat
tered everywhere. The red and
white walls are almost bare,
adorned only by a Nissen gym
nastics calendar and a gymnas
tics folder.
Hamada emphasizes discip
line and technique in training.
He enjoys coaching and says
he plans to continue.
"My life is made up for gym
nastics coaching — I have my
own little gymnastics school,
and I teach the little ones, from
two and a half up to their
mothers and fathers," he says.
Hamada considers gymnas
tics a "unique art form. It is a
pure art, but still related to

whether you win or lose. It's a
competition."
Chris Takimoto, junior, var
sity pommel horse specialist,
describes Hamada's relation
ship with the team as "infor
mal. Everyone calls him by his
first name. He's had extensive
background; he really knows
gymnastics technique and how
to teach it better than other
coaches.
"He's primarily concerned
with helping you to become
the very best gymnast that you
can,"Takimotoadds. "As faras
motivational problems go, he
demands that each person be
willing to work as hard as they
can. He treats you like an
adult."
Hamada is generally satisfied
with life, but complains that fi
nancially he is "not very well
off right now. Thirty-one years
old and I'm still living in an
apartment (in Redwood City).
And soon I'm getting married
too."
Engaged for two months, he
says he is "too busy to set the
date!"
The man who once did a
handstand at 2 a.m. on the

freeway to avoid a speeding
ticket ("I passed all the tests,
and they knew I was drunk and
I knew I was drunk") looks a
little tired, perhaps anticipat
ing the strain of upcoming
NCAA competition.
If he could get away from it
all? "I'd go fishing in Mexico,"
says Hamada. He also plays the
guitar.
If he had to admit a weak
ness? "I'm very weak to the
female, you know,"he says,
adding that he doesn't like "to
get up in front of people and
talk."
Hamada's gymnastics classes
are popular, attracting large
numbers of students. How
ever, not all students are
pleased with his instruction.
One disgruntled inter
mediate student complained,
"I don't really like the way he
handles the class. Today he
told us 'You guys aren't trying
hard enough — there isn't any
blood on the bar!' " The stu
dent displayed two blistered
palms.
The coach's sense of humor
is often commented on by stu
dents and teammates. Beneath

that quiet reserve apparently
lies a mischievous streak.
And what about the rumors
concerning the Ramada Inn,
where Hamada reportedly
claimed to be Mr. Ramada in
order to be seated quickly in
the restaurant?
"I usually tell them my uncle
Ramada owns the Ramada Inn,
and my name's Hamada — and
they say 'is that right?' "
Amused, his eyes crinkle
with laughter. Another favorite
trick is to take recruits who
have never seen the ocean be
fore and pretend to see a black
dot on the horizon. "Can you
see it, can you see it?" he asks
them. "When the kid says 'oh,
yeah,' I say, 'Well, that's Ja
pan!' "
Hamada's ultimate goal is to
win the NCAA championship.
"It's a possibility, but I can't do
it by myself. I've got to get
some help, some more money
and stuff from the University,
but I have the ability to coach
the gymnasts up to their poten
tial," he says. "If I have five
good recruits to start with,
perhaps in the next four years I
could win the championship."
