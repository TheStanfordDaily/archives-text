The Stanford lis dropped a
2-1 decision to California to
lower their record to 0-1-1 in
the Northern California Col
legiate Women's Soccer Con
ference.
"It was right in the middle of
dead week, so we were missing
two players that we had other
wise counted on, and we had a
goaltender (Bonnie )ohn) who
we wanted to give playing time
(she also plays fullback for the
Is)," said lis head coach |ohn
lenke.
"Of course, substituting a
goalie in the second half who
had never played before was
going to make a difference. We
entered the game with the at
titude thatwewould just havea
really good time, but we did
not say 'let's go out there and
kick the ball around.' We were
very serious about how we
were going to play; it's just that
people were put in new situa
tions," Jenke added.
Although these conditions
sound like a handicap, the
Cardinals were up to the chal
lenge, holding the hosts score
less for more than half of the
match.
"During the game, I think
anyone that was at the game
would say that we just com
pletely dominated Berkeley.
The ball was on Berkeley's half
of the field 80 per cent of the
game with us in control. Our
inexperience in the front line
positions really hurt us in terms
of making the score but we did
set up the chances — we had
about seven or eight good
chances for goals as well as
about 14 shots on goal during
the game," Jenke said.

The roster juggling turned
up some tough combinations
of players in this experimental
situation, and gave them a
quick acid test which will help
players and coaches alike for
future contests.
)enke said, "Defensively, we
had Betsy Lovekin playing the
sweeper position for the first
time. She did a tremendous
job; she played it extremely in
telligently — I've rarely seen a
player step into a new position
and fulfill the duties of that
position so well."
John, the rookie goalkeeper,
kept the Cardinals in the game
despite her inexperience at the
position. She filled in during
the second half and "did an in
credibly good job. Two goals
were scored against her, one of
which was her mistake. But she
also made three saves that
would have been goals other
wise. In fact, I doubt if other
goalies could have made the
saves she made," Jenke com
mented.
Perhaps more important for
the soccer program, the team's
attitude rather than the game's
final outcome, will carry more
weight in the development of
the young team members.
"The neatest thing is that
these players were really con
fident that they could win the
game despite the fact that Ber
keley scored first. They scored
a quick goal when we made our
substitution but we came back
within three minutes of their
goal. Margaret Sampson, our
center forward took a crossing
pass from Colleen Fitzpatrick
and placed it perfectly into the
net past the goaltender who
was charging," Jenke said.
