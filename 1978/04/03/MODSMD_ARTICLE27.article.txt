# Swimmers falter

"SEC! SEC! SEC!," chanted swimmers from Tennessee and
Auburn after the final event of the three-day NCAA Swimming
and Diving Championships. Silencing the partisan Pacific-8
crowd, the two orange-clad teams ushered in a new era of South
east Conference dominance, bringing to an end USC's four-year
win skien.
Tennessee captured the team title easily, amassing 307 points
and Auburn edged California for second with 175 points. Stan
ford could finish no better than 18th, their poorest showing in
many years. :
Slowing the Card swimmers were the effects of the flu, which
had beset many of them at the Pac-8 Championships, and the
shallow and wavy waters of the Belmont Plaza pool. Mentally, the
men seemed stale and unprepared for the intensity of the impor
tant competition. Even defending 200 yard butterfly titlist Mike
Bruner failed to make the championship final in his specialty,
although he stroked to an impressive 1:46.06 consolation final
win.
Other place winners for Stanford were Bob Hagberg in the 100
butterfly (11th place, 50.35), Stuart Corliss in the 200 breast (11th
place, 2:06.65) and the 400 freestyle relay quartet of Jon Powell,
John Kingery, Sam Franklin and Hagberg (11th place, 3:03.34).
The young team, though finishing the season on a low note,
had one of its largest contingents ever qualified for the NCAAs
despite the stringent qualifying standards. Returning a strong
nucleus and graduating only three seniors (Powell, Corliss, lack
Connelly) should put the Cards in good shape to reassume a top
10 finish next year.
