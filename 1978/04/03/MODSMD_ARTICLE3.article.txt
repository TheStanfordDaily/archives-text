# Nine professors win Guggenheim awards
## 
### 
Nine faculty members here are among 292 scho
lars, scientists and artists to receive coveted
Guggenheim Fellowship awards, the ]ohn Simon
Guggenheim Foundation announced Friday.
Fellowship awards totaled more than $4.5 mill
ion. Applicants numbered 3073 in the 54th annual
competition.
"The Fellowships were awarded on the basis of
demonstrated accomplishment in the past and
strong promise for the future," said Foundation
President Gordon Ray in a prepared statement.
Most of the fellows teach in American colleges
and universities.
According to Biochemistry Prof. Arthur Kornberg,
the selection process is "extremely difficult."
Kornberg, a Nobel Laureate, served as one of
seven members of the selection committee.
Kornberg said selections were made solely on
the basis of scholarship, which he defined as "de
monstrated creativity in the past and the con-

tinued potential to be creative" in the applicants'
respective fields.
He said that the applicants' past records were
most important in the selection with their prop
osed uses of the fellowship holding an important,
but "secondary" position.
He said there were some 80 areas of scholarship
"ranging from abstract mathematics to dance."
According to the Foundation, the University
placed third in number of recipients this year.
Only UC-Berkeley, with 16, and Yale with 11 had
more fellows.
Kornberg said this was in keeping with the Uni
versity's tradition of being in the top two or three
institutions for Guggenheim fellows annually.
Recipients of the awards from the University
include:
Chemistry Prof. John Brauman who will study

physical organic chemistry; Lewis Philosophy
Prof. Dagfinn Follesdal who will do an interpreta
tion of Husserl's phenomenology; Assoc. Geol
ogy Prof. )uhn Liou who will investigate low temp
erature interactions of rocks and aqueous solu
tions; Assoc. History Prof. Jeffrey Mass who will
work on lordship and inheritance in early
medieval Japan 1180-1333; Political Science Prof.
Giovanni Sartori who will undertake a comparative
study of parties and political systems; Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Spicer who will investi
gate the electronic structure and chemistry of
solid surfaces; Assoc. Computer Science Prof.
Robert Tarjan who look into design and analysis of
combinatorial algorithms; Operations Research
Prof. Arthur Veinott who will undertake studies in
the fields of operations research and mathematical
programming; and Physics Prof. Robert Wagoner,
who will do theoretical studies in gravitational
radiation and cosmology.
