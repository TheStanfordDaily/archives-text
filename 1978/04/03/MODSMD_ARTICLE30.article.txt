### 
The University has been granted a
three-week extension on the closing
of its sale of 694 acres of land on Black
Mountain to the Midpeninsula Open
Space District, according to William
Massy, vice president of business
and finance.
The sale had been scheduled to
close March 24 for $475,000 but was
delayed until April 12 to investigate
charges by Palo Alto attorney Harry
Aine that the $684 per acre price was
a "sweetheart deal" not reflecting
the true value of the property.
Massy had requested a three
month extension from the District on
March 22 after a meeting with attor
neys for both parties.
Aine, a Stanford alumnus, alleged
that the District has documents
suggesting a higher value for the land
and violated the law by not apprais
ing the property and offering a price
reflecting its true value.
Massy said yesterday the Univer
sity was "still in the process of look
ing into the situation and studying
Mr. Aine's accusations."
He said the granting of a three
week rather than three-month ex
tension was made "without pre
judice" by the District.
