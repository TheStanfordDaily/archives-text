Leaders plan further negotiations
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said yesterday that
Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weizman would return to
Egypt this week for further exploratory talks, but the
Egyptian leader ruled out a resumption of full-scale
negotiations "unless there is a clear change in the Israeli
position."
Syria, meanwhile, accused Israel of sending "ter
rorist" infiltrators to mine a key highway linking Syria
and Jordan and said 12 Syrians, including nine soldiers,
were killed in an attempt to defuse the mines.
An Israeli military command spokesman in Tel Aviv
denied knowledge of the incident.
Sadat, in an interview published in Cairo's October
Magazine, said the search for common ground between
Egypt and Israel "should continue because we are par
ties to the Mideast problem."
He said, however, that "severe differences" remain
between the two countries on how to achieve peace.
"It is impossible to resume the meetings of the milit
ary and political committees unless there is a clear
change in the Israeli position," Sadat was quoted as
saying in the interview.
Derailed car explodes, six hurt
Brownson, Neb. — A derailed tank car carrying a phos
phorous liquid exploded into flames yesterday, injuring
six workers who had been brought in after the derail
ment. More than 1500 people had been evacuated be
fore the blast.
Theexplosion sent pieces of the tank car as faras half a
mile.
Deputy State Fire Marshal jim Kuticka of Scottsbluff
said he had "no idea" why the explosion occurred. "We
were told that it was not supposed to be explosive mate
rial. We've got two experts here from Idaho and they
don't know what happened, but they're researching it,"
he said.
Cheyenne County Sheriff Oren Cox said residents of
nearby towns were evacuated after 30 cars of an 85-car
Union Pacific freight train derailed early yesterday morn
ing. The explosion came five hours later, and the
evacuees were allowed to return last night, although the
remains of the tanker were still burning.
Ed Schafer, public relations officer for Union Pacific in
Omaha, said the phosphorous would not be fatal, but
could irritate the skin.
The explosion threw a half-ton piece of the tanker an
eighth of a mile and hurled another piece of the tanker
about half a mile. An airborne set of wheels from the
railcar ripped open the tank unit of a fire truck that was
parked next to the road
PLO head predicts more fighting
Beirut, Lebanon — Yasser Arafat, Palestine Liberation
Organization leader, said yesterday PLO members still
in Israeli-occupied Lebanon will continue to disrupt the
cease-fire.
"Our volunteers and our freedom fighter is working,
and, two days ago, they declared still there is resistance
in this Israeli-occupied area, so they are working now,"
Arafat said.
His remarks came in an interview on ABC-TV's "Issues
and Answers."
The Palestinian leader said the volunteers and free
dom fighters were, however, not acting under direct
orders from him.
Airport to guard against attacks
Tokyo — The Japanese government plans to build an

electric fence and moat around Tokyo's new interna
tional airport to guard it against attacks by radicals, it was
reported yesterday.
More than 6000 demonstrators marched near the air
port, meanwhile, to celebrate the attack last weekend
that wrecked its control tower and delayed its scheduled
opening.
The newspaper Vomiuri said the government of Prime
Minister Takeo Fukuda would present to the cabinet
tomorrow its proposals for a high-voltage electric fence
and a water-filled ditch around the airport at Narita, 40
miles northeast of Tokyo.
Dollar plummets to new low
Tokyo — The U.S. dollar dropped sharply on the
Tokyo foreign exchange market today, opening at 220.00
yen and then quickly falling to a new low of 218.30 before
rallying slightly to 218.50-80.
The opening was more than 3 yen below Friday's clos
ing 223.375. Traders described the market as "very nerv
ous."
The drop followed Friday's announcement of a record
U.S. trade deficit of $4.52 billion in February.
Computer finds anti-cancer drug
Houston — With the help of a computer, scientists
have designed and produced what they call the most
potent anti-cancer drug ever made — an agent so lethal
it kills hundreds of millions of cancer cells in laboratory
mice with a single dose.
Researchers from UC-San Francisco say the drug
azetomicin is one of a new class designed to stick to
cancer cells longer than other drugs in order to intensify
its effects.
Dr. Martin Apple, head of the team that developed the
new drug, cautioned that there is no assurance azetomi
cin would have the same effect on human cancer as it did
in mice. No human tests have been made.
The California researchers drew information from
PROPHET, a nationwide computer network of chemical
and biological data sponsored by the National Institutes
of Health.
Today's Weather
Rain likely at times today and tonight and chance of

in the 40s to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in the
mid 50s to low 60s. West to southwest winds 10 to 25

Leaders plan further negotiations
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said yesterday that
Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weizman would return to
Egypt this week for further exploratory talks, but the
Egyptian leader ruled out a resumption of full-scale
negotiations "unless there is a clear change in the Israeli
position."
Syria, meanwhile, accused Israel of sending "ter
rorist" infiltrators to mine a key highway linking Syria
and Jordan and said 12 Syrians, including nine soldiers,
were killed in an attempt to defuse the mines.
An Israeli military command spokesman in Tel Aviv
denied knowledge of the incident.
Sadat, in an interview published in Cairo's October
Magazine, said the search for common ground between
Egypt and Israel "should continue because we are par
ties to the Mideast problem."
He said, however, that "severe differences" remain
between the two countries on how to achieve peace.
"It is impossible to resume the meetings of the milit
ary and political committees unless there is a clear
change in the Israeli position," Sadat was quoted as
saying in the interview.
Derailed car explodes, six hurt
Brownson, Neb. — A derailed tank car carrying a phos
phorous liquid exploded into flames yesterday, injuring
six workers who had been brought in after the derail
ment. More than 1500 people had been evacuated be
fore the blast.
Theexplosion sent pieces of the tank car as faras half a
mile.
Deputy State Fire Marshal jim Kuticka of Scottsbluff
said he had "no idea" why the explosion occurred. "We
were told that it was not supposed to be explosive mate
rial. We've got two experts here from Idaho and they
don't know what happened, but they're researching it,"
he said.
Cheyenne County Sheriff Oren Cox said residents of
nearby towns were evacuated after 30 cars of an 85-car
Union Pacific freight train derailed early yesterday morn
ing. The explosion came five hours later, and the
evacuees were allowed to return last night, although the
remains of the tanker were still burning.
Ed Schafer, public relations officer for Union Pacific in
Omaha, said the phosphorous would not be fatal, but
could irritate the skin.
The explosion threw a half-ton piece of the tanker an
eighth of a mile and hurled another piece of the tanker
about half a mile. An airborne set of wheels from the
railcar ripped open the tank unit of a fire truck that was
parked next to the road
PLO head predicts more fighting
Beirut, Lebanon — Yasser Arafat, Palestine Liberation
Organization leader, said yesterday PLO members still
in Israeli-occupied Lebanon will continue to disrupt the
cease-fire.
"Our volunteers and our freedom fighter is working,
and, two days ago, they declared still there is resistance
in this Israeli-occupied area, so they are working now,"
Arafat said.
His remarks came in an interview on ABC-TV's "Issues
and Answers."
The Palestinian leader said the volunteers and free
dom fighters were, however, not acting under direct
orders from him.
Airport to guard against attacks
Tokyo — The Japanese government plans to build an

electric fence and moat around Tokyo's new interna
tional airport to guard it against attacks by radicals, it was
reported yesterday.
More than 6000 demonstrators marched near the air
port, meanwhile, to celebrate the attack last weekend
that wrecked its control tower and delayed its scheduled
opening.
The newspaper Vomiuri said the government of Prime
Minister Takeo Fukuda would present to the cabinet
tomorrow its proposals for a high-voltage electric fence
and a water-filled ditch around the airport at Narita, 40
miles northeast of Tokyo.
Dollar plummets to new low
Tokyo — The U.S. dollar dropped sharply on the
Tokyo foreign exchange market today, opening at 220.00
yen and then quickly falling to a new low of 218.30 before
rallying slightly to 218.50-80.
The opening was more than 3 yen below Friday's clos
ing 223.375. Traders described the market as "very nerv
ous."
The drop followed Friday's announcement of a record
U.S. trade deficit of $4.52 billion in February.
Computer finds anti-cancer drug
Houston — With the help of a computer, scientists
have designed and produced what they call the most
potent anti-cancer drug ever made — an agent so lethal
it kills hundreds of millions of cancer cells in laboratory
mice with a single dose.
Researchers from UC-San Francisco say the drug
azetomicin is one of a new class designed to stick to
cancer cells longer than other drugs in order to intensify
its effects.
Dr. Martin Apple, head of the team that developed the
new drug, cautioned that there is no assurance azetomi
cin would have the same effect on human cancer as it did
in mice. No human tests have been made.
The California researchers drew information from
PROPHET, a nationwide computer network of chemical
and biological data sponsored by the National Institutes
of Health.
