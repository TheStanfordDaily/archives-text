A hand-painted Costa Rican ox
cart, a Zaire ceremonial mask and a
1905 Stanford football poster were
among 20,000 items sold at Treasure
Market '78 last week.
Sponsored by the Committee for
Art at Stanford, the sixth biennial sale
raised more than $175,000 for the Art
Museum's acquisition fund. It was
the most successful sale since the
Treasure Market was begun in 1968.
At least 3000 bargain-hunters filled
Roble gym Thursday, Friday and
Saturday to look over the items col
lected by 800 Committee for Art vol
unteers.
When the doors closed Saturday
evening, only a few books and
household items were left.
The most expensive purchases
were two Steinway grand pianos, au
ctioned off Thursday evening for a
total of more than $12,000. The foot
ball poster, also auctioned off that
night, brought a $120 bid.
Other unusual items sold included
a 19th century Ethiopian camel bell, a
completely furnished Bavarian dol-
Ihouse and a pair of Herb Caen's
monogrammed cuff links.
Two popular pieces of furniture
donated to the sale were a carved
wooden hall bench from the estate of

Rudolph Valentino and a wooden
sleigh-bed once slept in by President
Jimmy Carter.
Art lovers found a Nepalese
bronze and jewel elephant and sev
eral Oriental figures of ivory, porce
lain, cloissone and wood. The list of
fine metals and jewelry available in
cluded a pair of Tiffany silver vegeta
ble dishes, pearl necklaces and a
diamond bracelet.
For those with less expensive
tastes, the sale included books, car
pets, lamps and a "nostalgia" collec
tion of feather fans and old clothes.
According to Penelope Dellaporta,
the sale's publicity chairman, many
students visited the Treasure Market
Saturday afternoon, when the re
maining items were halved in price.
"One student completely outfitted
his room," she said.
All the items on sale were donated
to the Committee for Art during the
past two years.
The last Treasure Market, in 1976,
raised a total of $122,000. The full
amount presented to the museum
since the sales began is nearing
$750,000.
An exhibit of the acquisitions
made possible through the sales will
beondisplayatthe Museum through
May 7.
