## 
### 
Lagos, Nigeria (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter said yesterday the Un
ited States and Great Britain are cal
ling all sides in Rhodesia's guerrilla
war together with representatives of
the United Nations in a new effort to
bring peace and black majority rule
to the strife-torn nation.
The president made the an
nouncement at the conclusion of

talks with Nigerian chief of state
Olusegun Obasanjo. Carter said the
meeting on Rhodesia will be held as
soon as possible.
He said invitations to the new talks
will go to white Rhodesian Prime
Minister lan Smith, moderate black
leaders in Rhodesia and guerrilla
chieftains fighting from bases in
neighboring countries for political
control of the breakaway British col
ony.
Representatives of the five
neighboring "front-line" states also
will be invited, Carter said.
Carter wound up his stay in Nigeria
with a state dinner last night. He
leaves today for Liberia and a
stopover for lunch with President
William Tolbert. The Carters, daugh
ter Amy and top U.S. foreign policy
advisers return to Washington later
today after seven days in Latin
America and West Africa.
At a brief meeting with reporters,
Carter said he and Obasanjo found
no disagreement over three major
African issues — Rhodesia; South
west Africa, or Namibia, the South
African controlled territory where
western powers are proposing a new
formula for black rule; and the Horn
of Africa, where Ethiopia, backed by
Cubans and Soviets, last month de
feated its neighboring enemy,

Somalia.
"In these three major areas we
have reached a common purpose,
and so far as I know there are no
remaining differences between my
self and Gen. Obasanjo," the presi
dent said.
The president conceded that Cen.
Obasanjo wants tougher action
against South Africa's white minority
government.
South Africa is under a mandatory
U.N. arms embargo, but western
powers have rejected calls from
Third World and Communist coun
tries for a total economic boycott.
Announcing the new bid to solve
the Rhodesian issue, the president
said:
"We now will move as quickly as
possible to call together the parties
who are in dispute concerning Zim
babwe — those who have been iden
tified as the Patriotic Front, the
front-line nations who surround
Rhodesia, and also the parties to the
internal settlement: Smith,
Muzorewa, Sithole and Chirau.
"We will begin now to explore the
earliest date when this new meeting
might be accomplished," Carter
said. "We and the British will act as
hosts and we will, of course, encour
age United Nations participation as
well."
