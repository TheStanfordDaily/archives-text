# New SLAC project scheduled to begin operation in 1979

### Jim Fallon 
Despite funding and con
struction delays, the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center's
Positron-Electron Project
(SLAC-PEP) is still scheduled to
begin operation by Oct. 1,
1979.
SLAC officials said the PEP
storage ring, which will pro
duce sub-atomic particles by
colliding an electron beam and
a positron beam, will cost
about $78 million. Construc
tion of the ring is being funded
by the federal government
through the Department of
Energy.
However, Wayne Bennett,
assistant budget officer at
SLAC, said the funding of the
ring will probably extend over
four years because the funding
has not kept up with the origi
nal completion date.
"The last $6 million won't
become available until fiscal
year 1980," SLAC director
Wolfgang Panofsky said.
"We're trying hard to finish by
October 1979.
"We're trying to negotiate
with the federal government to
move later money earlier with
out increasing the total," he
added.
Bennett said last year's PEP
funding totaled $35.1 million
and SLAC is to receive $29.4
million in fiscal year 1979.

Steve Blair, assistant civil en
gineer for PEP, said construc
tion is about 60 days behind
schedule on the main control
room section.
"The rain kind of threw us off
a little bit," Blair said.
He said construction of PEP
has five main contracts. The
designs are mainly for the basic
tunnel of the ring. After the
tunnel is constructed SLAC
scientists will install the tech
nical components.
"We just hand them the shell
— the empty shell — and they
take over from there," Blair
explained. "We build the
house and they put in the furni
ture."
The PEP ring is divided into
five interaction areas where
the collisions of the positron
electron beams will be moni
tored.
As with a clock, the interac
tion areas are at regions 12,
two, four, six and eight. Region
10 is underground because of
the topography and because it
is not an interaction chamber,
Blair said.
The initial site work for the
project and its hook-up with
the linear accelerator are both
completed, he said.
Long tunnel
The $13.3 million construc
tion of the tunnel and the in
teraction halls has been going

on since November 1977.
The ring is really an octagon
with curved sections, he said.
It will be about 1.4 miles long,
which is 10 times larger than
the SPEAR ring at SLAC.
Prof. Burton Richter, head of
the SPEAR ring project, said the
PEP ring is larger because "the
smaller you want to see, the
bigger device you need to
use."
When particles collide in the
SPEAR ring, they have a
maximum energy of eight
giga-electron volts, Richter
said. The maximum collision
energy of the PEP ring will be 36
giga-electron volts.
Richter said the PEP ring is
already filled through 1982 for
the first round of experiments.
But, he added, it usually takes
at least two years to prepare an
experiment.
Detection device
The PEP ring will give the
SLAC facility another detection
device for sub-atomic parti
cles.
At present, the electron
beam of the linear accelerator
can be channeled into four dif
ferent detection facilities, Bill
Kirk, editor of the facility's
newsletter SLAC Beam Line,
explained.
The beam, which is pro
duced by a "sophisticated hot

wire," can go into one of three
monitoring stations, where it
collides with liquid hydrogen
and produces particles.
But when the beam collides
with its target, most of the
energy is wasted, Kirk said.
"The beam can also be split
and go into the SPEAR storage
ring. Here more of the energy
goes into the collision, and
more particles are produced,"
he said.
"You get a more effective
use of energy when you have
two beams," Kirk added. "Es
sentially all high-energy
physics is collision experi
ments."
Shine the light
But Kirk said one must shine
a light on these particles to dis
cover them, as one must turn
on a light in a dark room to
find an object.
"The light needed to shine
on it (the particles) is electrons
or protons coming out of an
accelerator," he said. "SLAC is
a very big electron micros
cope.
"Accelerators are fancy light
bulbs to generate artificial
light," Kifk added.
In addition to the accelerator
to produce light, you need to
"substitute for your eye some
kind of fancy gadget which says
'I have a particle,' " he said.

Thus, all the other ap
paratuses — the SPEAR and PEP
rings, the bubble chambers
and the spectroscopes — are
"fancy eyes," Kirk explained.
He said you can see more
clearly if this light is focused on
a small area, and this small, fo
cused light is high energy light
produced by an accelerator.
Panofsky said there are four
linear accelerators in the Un
ited States, all federally sup
ported. The Argonne ac
celerator in Chicago will be
shut down by the end of the
year, however, because of the
large cost required to run an
accelerator.
World's largest
For example, Bennett said
SLAC's total budget for fiscal
year 1979, which begins in Oc
tober, is $38.2 million.
The two-mile-long Stanford
Linear Accelerator, which
began operation in 1966, is the
largest electron accelerator in
the world, Panofsky said.
SLAC's research program deals
only with particle physics.

Because there are so few ac
celerators, the Stanford facility
must be made available to sci
entists from throughout the
United States and the world.
The competition for facility use
can be quite fierce, Panofsky
said.
"The problem ... is that we
are the proud owners of one of
the three large centers where
the work is done," he said.
Panofsky said the number of
scientists wanting to use SLAC
has been growing and it is a
strain on the facility to accom
modate them all.
"We spend a large amount of
effort simply allocating what
we have," he said.
Not physicists
Yet most of the people who
work at SLAC are not physi
cists.
"Many of the people work
ing here are carpenters,
machinists, plumbers or wel
ders," Panofsky said. These
people are often baffled by ex
periments conducted at SLAC,
and the SLAC Beam Line was

created to answer their ques
tions, he said.
The activities at SLAC can
also be baffling to the scientists
involved.
"It takes a great deal of im
agination for you to believe
that what you see on your elec
tric boxes is what's really going
on down in the accelerator,"
Panofsky said.
SLAC is continually pre
sented with belief conflicts.
One of these major conflicts is
between the purely academic
pursuit and the cry for practical
applications of the discoveries,
Panofsky said.
"There is no visual applica
tion of particle physics itself,"
he said.
But particle physicists can
also make technological ad
vances.
"In solving problems of par
ticle physics they solve
technological problems which
are useful in solving other
technological problems,"
Panofsky said. This can lead, as
in the case of SLAC, to better

computer systems or more ac
curate land surveying
techniques.
"But that's not the main
reason we're here," Panofsky
said. "That's not the point."
The advances are "by
products of accelerator
technology, which we need,
rather than a by-product of re
search," he said.
The real purpose of SLAC,
Panofsky said, is to find the
"fundamental nature of inani
mate matter, the fundamental
building blocks.
"Most particle physicists
have the faith that nature is
fundamentally simple," he
said. "That may be wrong."
Finding these fundamental
building blocks will "certainly
make you understand the na
ture of matter better,"
Panofsky said. The hope is that
these discoveries will enable
man to better deal with nature.
"If you understand how na
ture really works you're going
to be smarter in dealing with it
than if you didn't," he said.

Construction work is continuing on the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center's Positron-Electron Project, scheduled for completion by Oc
tober 1979. Above the south injection tunnel is seen merging with the
future PEP ring tunnel in construction work last month. The PEP ring
will give researchers at SLAC another detection device for sub
atomic particles.
