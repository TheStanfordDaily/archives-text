# New SLAC project scheduled to begin operation in 1979

Despite funding and con
struction delays, the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center's
Positron-Electron Project
(SLAC-PEP) is still scheduled to
begin operation by Oct. 1,
1979.
SLAC officials said the PEP
storage ring, which will pro
duce sub-atomic particles by
colliding an electron beam and
a positron beam, will cost
about $78 million. Construc
tion of the ring is being funded
by the federal government
through the Department of
Energy.
However, Wayne Bennett,
assistant budget officer at
SLAC, said the funding of the
ring will probably extend over
four years because the funding
has not kept up with the origi
nal completion date.
"The last $6 million won't
become available until fiscal
year 1980," SLAC director
Wolfgang Panofsky said.
"We're trying hard to finish by
October 1979.
"We're trying to negotiate
with the federal government to
move later money earlier with
out increasing the total," he
added.
Bennett said last year's PEP
funding totaled $35.1 million
and SLAC is to receive $29.4
million in fiscal year 1979.

Steve Blair, assistant civil en
gineer for PEP, said construc
tion is about 60 days behind
schedule on the main control
room section.
"The rain kind of threw us off
a little bit," Blair said.
He said construction of PEP
has five main contracts. The
designs are mainly for the basic
tunnel of the ring. After the
tunnel is constructed SLAC
scientists will install the tech
nical components.
"We just hand them the shell
— the empty shell — and they
take over from there," Blair
explained. "We build the
house and they put in the furni
ture."
The PEP ring is divided into
five interaction areas where
the collisions of the positron
electron beams will be moni
tored.
As with a clock, the interac
tion areas are at regions 12,
two, four, six and eight. Region
10 is underground because of
the topography and because it
is not an interaction chamber,
Blair said.
The initial site work for the
project and its hook-up with
the linear accelerator are both
completed, he said.
Long tunnel
The $13.3 million construc
tion of the tunnel and the in
teraction halls has been going

on since November 1977.
The ring is really an octagon
with curved sections, he said.
It will be about 1.4 miles long,
which is 10 times larger than
the SPEAR ring at SLAC.
Prof. Burton Richter, head of
the SPEAR ring project, said the
PEP ring is larger because "the
smaller you want to see, the
bigger device you need to
use."
When particles collide in the
SPEAR ring, they have a
maximum energy of eight
giga-electron volts, Richter
said. The maximum collision
energy of the PEP ring will be 36
giga-electron volts.
Richter said the PEP ring is
already filled through 1982 for
the first round of experiments.
But, he added, it usually takes
at least two years to prepare an
experiment.
Detection device
The PEP ring will give the
SLAC facility another detection
device for sub-atomic parti
cles.
At present, the electron
beam of the linear accelerator
can be channeled into four dif
ferent detection facilities, Bill
Kirk, editor of the facility's
newsletter SLAC Beam Line,
explained.

duced by a "sophisticated hot
