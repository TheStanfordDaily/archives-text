## Ten years after their split

John, Paul, George and Ringo star
ing at me from my walls as I write, I
thought I would write my thoughts
on the fab four a little under nine
years since "Beatles Break Up"
stories headlined newspapers April
10, 1969.
Well, to put it on the line, I still
think Lennon is one of the giants
walking this earth. He's had his ups
and downs, but in the end the pain
attracts sympathy, the musical talent
admiration, and the occasional mis
behavior forgiveness.
One distinct down came when
Lennon, drunk at a night club, threw
insults at the Smothers Brothers and
punches at their manager and a
cocktail waitress; her comment: "It's
not the pain that hurts; it's finding
out that one of your idols is a real
asshole."
Unsympathetic behavior true, but
it's hard to expect someone who be
came one of the world's four most
famous people at age 23 to lead a
normal life. Lennon had just been
through two miscarriages with Yoko,
a drug-dependance withdrawal, as
sorted personal problems, and was
waging a fight against deportation at
the time.
But to turn to the early days. After a
long period of being dominated by
the United States, first by its jazz,
then by its big-band and early rock
and-roll, England had four young
men who were able to bring the
world to its feet. They spearheaded
the first of an eventual five "British
Invasions" which was so complete
that it was not until the middle '70s
that the majority of groups in the
U.S. top-forty were not English.
And the Beatles continued their
domination for almost a decade.
They changed the direction of mod
ern music, not once, but three times.
With their first and second albums
they blasted away the stale American
music of the '50s, with "Sgt. Pepper"
they introduced psychedelic music
(and created the generation gap),
and with "Abbey Road," the musical
tone of the '70s was set.
Dominant force
It is at exactly those three periods
that Lennon, rather than McCartney,
was the dominant force in the Bea
tles. Actually, that's not strictly accu
rate, in the case of "Abbey Road,"
McCartney was at least influential,
but the really trendsetting songs on
the album ("Come Together" and"I
Want You/She's So Heavy") are Len
non's.
Incidentally, that is not to say that
McCartney is not immensely
talented, it is only to agree with cri
tics that have labeled McCartney's ta
lent "bourgeois." So much so, that
after the break-up Lennon would
write "You (McCartney) live with
straights who tell you you was king;
jump when your momma tell you

anything; the only thing you done
was "Yesterday . . . the sound you
make is muzak to my ears, . . . how
do you sleep?"
Lennon has never been afraid to
make his thoughts public, on "Plastic
Ono Band" he writes a touching
statement concerning his mother: I
wonder if any otherartist would have
the courage to reveal himself so.
Other memorable Lennon state
ments would include the remark
"The Beatles are bigger than Jesus
Christ" in the London Evening Stan
dard, which caused a remarkable
furor, largely because it was perhaps
true at the time.
In England Lennon did little to en
dear himself to the elder population
by sending back his Member of the
British Empire (MBE) back to the
Queen in a brown paper bag, with a
note protesting British involvement
in Biafra and against his single "Cold
Turkey" slipping in the charts. Len
non's Aunt Mimi was subsequently
quoted in the press as saying "I can
not agree (with John) that this is any
way of registering a protest. If I'd
known what he wanted to do with it, I
would not have let him have his
MBE."
Mildly talented
What about Ringo? Ringo has the
misfortune of beinga mildly talented
person in a group with two and a half
geniuses (the half-genius, George,
comes in a minute). I would like to
point out that Ringo has written and
sung a couple of the Beatles' best
selling (if not moreprofound) songs.
For instance, he wrote "Octopus'
Garden," co-wrote "Photograph"
and "What Goes On?" with assorted
Beatles. His first solo single effort
topped all the other ex-Beatle efforts
with "It Ain't Easy," which rose to
number two in the United States. As
a drummer he might not be amazing,
but as Lennon once remarked, Rin
go's massively accented triple beats
are unique.
Ringo is also an accomplished ac
tor, and, perhaps more than any
other Beatle, a simply likeable fel
low. His motivations seem simple
and pleasing. Asked why he put out
his abominable first solo album,
Ringo responded "I did it for me
Mum." Upon receiving his MBE he
commented, "There's a proper
medal, isn't there? I'll keep it to wear
when I'm old."
Half a genius
Well, getting to George Harrison.
He is certainly capable of producing
some superb music. Beatle composi
tions "Its only a Northern Song,"
"Taxman," "While my Guitar Gently
Weeps," etc. and two heavyweight
albums ("Living in the Material
World" and "All Things Must Pass")
prove he is exceedingly talented, and
could have headed up a very impres-

sive second-rate group himself.
However there is also the less im
pressive, "Within You, Without
You." Some of his solo albums show
Harrison can create trash if he is not
careful. This was somewhat limited
in the Beatles years, when Harrison
remarked "I am very conscious of
being overpowered by John and
Paul."
Frankly, I am also puzzled by Har
rison. At various times he has been
any number of things: a rebellious
youth (asked why he set fire to the
wallpaper in a hotel room, he re
marked Because it seemed the thing
to do at the time."), at other times
spiritually elevated, and at other
times crassly commercial. I couldn't
begin to synthesize my thoughts on
George in one column. The only
thing I would remark is I hope he
pulls out of his current artistic de
cline soon.
That same thought applies, I am
afraid, to Lennon as well. His last
original album, "Wall and Bridges"
was four years ago and another is
long overdue.
My final thought relates to Stan
ford, that is simply: I would be
pleased to see Lennon as next year's
graduation speaker. He is a prize
winning author, noted political ac
tivist, philanthropist, and (what more
could one want?) ex-Beatle.
