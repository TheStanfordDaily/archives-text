# Death bell tolls for equal rights

The banner of "Equality of the Sexes" is slowly
but surely being furled. Without some sort of uni
versal moral awakening (if someone is prone to
total unrealistic fantasies) the "death knell" will
sound for equal rights and we will be once again
"flogging a dead horse."
Five articles dealing in some way with this sub
ject have appeared in University publications in
the last six weeks, but not a damn one had the
courage to even attempt to speak out and identify
the devastating disease which is killing this cen
turies-old crusade.
I am not claiming to possess any panacea but
only to being able to distinguish right from wrong,
and not always having the courage to admit when I
am wrong. Herein lies the fault with us all includ
ing most equality proponents, especially those
who talk a good battle.
If higher education spawns concerns like "those
churches which base their belief that men and
women are different upon the Bible and will lose
their tax exempt status due to ERA" or "we stayed
up until 2 or 3 a.m. to see if we liked the name
Simone de Beauvoir, and to kind of get used to it"
(for a theme house) then you can take "higher"
education and shove it. My state of "limited" edu
cation is preferable, for all the good yours does for
society.
Theoretically, the basic function of the churches
should have been to teach people how to "die in a
state of grace," happily, through the "promise of
heaven or hell," depending upon whether or not
one lived by the dictates of the Ten Command
ments. By any standard the churches themselves
have been generally guilty of breaking these
commandments, by its failure to speak out firmly

and unequivocally for all racial as well as sexual
equality. I don't know of anywhere in the Bible
where Christ puts down women or minorities.
Einstein speaking on moral decay 1937: "One
misses the elementary reaction against injustice
and for justice â€” that reaction which in the long
run represents man's only protection against a
relapse into barbarism." Applying this to civil and
or equal rights it would have been nice to have this
"elementary reaction" from the Churches. They
refused to pick up either gauntlet. The state of the
world today is proof enough that they have failed
in their basic function, so who the hell cares if they
lose their "tax exempt status."
One down.
If one must base their willingness and ability to
continue the battle of equality on whether or not
one likes the name de Beauvoir, then one simply
must pack up their tent and fade into the darkness
of obscurity. This is truly sad sirice de Beauvoir is
the one person who has laid it all out so succinctly
and simply, right down to making visual the
"complex female emotions," as to make them
crystal clear and put "sexual equality" in an excit
ing perspective, even for "male chauvinists." I
hope.
Two down.
Female sweatshops disappeared because
women were informed and organized. Their resis
tance to being exploited came about because their
sisters were "willing to give up the treasures of
femininity 'even' though these cost blood and
misery" (de Beauvoir, The Second Sex), and not by
lipservice.
Feminists convening as they have so far has only
served to give one the disheartening image of an

utterly disjointed, uninformed, group of women
and men all working in opposite directions. The
Feminists convention in Kansas City in July of 1977
was an example that made me for one embarassed
to distraction on the part of informed feminists.
The hue and cry they made over President Jimmy
Carter's call for an in-depth investigation into be
nefits being denied military women, because they
said "women might be denied or deprived of cer
tain privileges due a female," shows that they were
neither informed as to the meaning of the word
"feminist" and that they didn't care enough to find
out before spouting off.
Between this occurence, and Bella Abzug and
Gloria Steinem showing the extent of the diver
sities of interests and goals of the group, the net
result was that they barely mustered enough floor
votes to support ERA ratification. Unbelievable to
say the least.
The figures published as a result of the Kansas
City meeting, and others has led me to disregard
any further published figures. Now when I want
answers I conduct my own poll. So far my figures
have hair-raising implications, not the least of
which is that at least 90 percent of those I polled do
not even have a common vocabulary when it
comes to definitions, much less a common goal.
"Don't expect privileges, or assert claims of any
peculiar protection of society beyond what
'mutual' inclination dictates through 'mutual' re
spect." How many of you so called informed
feminists can identify this paraphrased quote? If
you can't you are not informed enough to do your
movement any good.
