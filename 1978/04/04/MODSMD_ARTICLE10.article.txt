# Israel exchanging peace for war

More than 700 civilians were killed
during the recent Israeli invasion of
Lebanon, but the news photo of a
single little girl running interrorfrom
an air attack had a particular irony
and sadness. )ust 35 years ago it was
Jewish children who knew such hor
ror.
Certainly no people in modern his
tory has suffered as greatly as the
Jews of Europe. Their tragedy should
be taught and remembered as an
example of human cruelty and suffer
ing that must never be repeated.
Unfortunately, Israeli Prime Minis
ter Menachem Begin demeans that
tragedy by telling the world that be
cause of the Holocaust whatever Is
rael does today is necessary for the
survival of the Jewish people. In ef
fect the victims of the enormous
crimes against the Jews are being
used to justify acts of oppression
committed by the government of Is
rael.
Breeding terrorists
Devastating Southern Lebanon
and driving the inhabitants from
their homes will not guarantee the
security of Israel. The hatred and re
sentment aroused in the Arab world
will force Israel to depend even more
on military strength, and on security
measures more appropriate to an
armed camp than to a democratic
society. The subhuman conditions
under which Palestinian refugees
will be forced to live will only breed
more terrorists.
In any case, the Palestinians who
murdered 36 Israelis in the barbarous
raid of March 11 embarked from a
point in Lebanon well north of the
area invaded by Israel. And accord
ing to a Los Angeles Times corres
pondent, Palestinian soldiers in
Lebanon have retained their posi
tions north of the Litani River from
which their artillery can still reach Is
rael. As a Western military attache
commented, "It is hard to see what
the Israelis have gained."
It seems clear that the invasion was
never intended to end terrorism but,
far more likely, to eliminate the
Palestinians, and with them their
claim to nationhood, as a factor in
future Middle East negotiations.
The recent breakdown in talks be

tween Israel and Egypt has em
phasized once again that Israel's oc
cupation of the West Bank and Gaza
remains an obstacle to peace. Egypt,
Saudi Arabia, )ordan and even Syria
have repeatedly announced their wil
lingness to accept and make peace
with Israel once the Arab lands are
returned and the Palestinians
granted a homeland.
It is to those countries' own self
interest that the Palestinians' grie
vances be resolved. But instead of
starting the long process of finding a
way to co-exist with a Palestinian
state, of negotiating terms that
would make peace more advantage
ous to the new state than war, Israel
has chosen a more dangerous
course.
The invasion of Lebanon, obvi
ously long planned and waiting for
an excuse, was clearly aimed at dis

persing and demoralizing the Pales
tinians, their institutions and their
leadership, in order to destroy them
once and for all as a people capable
of making their demands heard.
Israel may well have succeeded in
this effort, for the time being. But in
exchange for her insistence on keep
ing Gaza and the West Bank Israel
has traded away any immediate hope
for a lasting peace with her Arab
neighbors, and condemned her own
people to the role of oppressors.
Palestinians vulnerable
Certainly there are risks involved
in returning the captured Arab lands.
But the ease with which Israeli forces
cut through Lebanon indicates that a
Palestinian state would be totally
vulnerable if it offered any provoca
tion. And obviously such a state
would not come into being until the
long and difficult job of working out

mutual guarantees of security is ac
complished.
This process itself, once the prin
ciple of eventual statehood-is estab
lished, can lead to the development
of understanding between both
sides, lewish terrorism of the 1940s
ended with the creation of Israel,
even though the stated goal of the
terrorists for a much larger state went
unmet. It seems reasonable to as
sume that the Palestinians will be
have in a similar way.
Surely a greater risk lies in the
prospect of continuing ferment in
the Middle East, the cycle of terror
and reprisal which claims innocent
victims on both sides, and — for Is
rael — an uneasy security based en
tirely on the ability to wage war and
suppress a hostile population.
