## theater /john nielsen Genius on Eighth Street 
### 
There is no better argument
for small bay area theater
than that which is currently
playing on 2525 Eighth Street in
Berkeley. There, inside what
looks to have once been some
thing of the warehouse variety,
a group called The Playhouse
Company is staging an ex
tremely potent production of
Eugene O'Neill's "The Em
peror )ones."
The offering turns the limita
tions of the location into de
cided theatrical attributes, and
it features a leading performer
that could hardly have been
better.
The play tells the story of
Brutus jones, former Pullman
Porterfrom Harlem, and his fall
from grace in the jungles of a
small West Indian Island. Jones
has convinced the natives of
that island that he possesses
supernatural powers, but as it
begins they are deserting his
palace and preparing to revolt.

The Emperor attempts his
escape and quickly loses his
bearings; what follows is a de
scent into a racial, political, re
ligious and personal, com
plexly allegorical hell. As the
action progresses it moves in
side the emperor's mind; at
the same time however it ac
quires an immediacy that
works like a vice on the audi
ence.
The play is set in eight scenes
and a prologue, with no inter
mission; it incorporates ele
ments of ballet and mime as
well as the traditional fare. In
the prologue — the play begins
in darkness, with the sound of
congas preceeding all else — a
witch doctor enters and per
forms a rituarover each of the
emperor's prized possessions.
He kneels and summons a
dancer carrying Jones' medal
infested coat, then calls
another who delivers Jones'
gloves. And another, who
brings his hat, and one more,
who carries a pearl-handled
revolver containing a silver bul
let. Then they disappear, leav
ing us with the conga.
It is something of a miracle
that O'Neill wrote this play in
1920, yet despite its venerabil
ity it is not too often per
formed. Primarily, this is a
function of its central role
being too much for anything
less than virtuouso, at the same
time the play requires for its
success a relatively close envi
ronment.
But The Playhouse Company
has both. Their "theater" holds
only a hundred odd-people,
and this brings us all closer to

O'Neill's intent; and Danny L.
Glover, who plays the lead,
makes sure none of us escape.
Glover is absolutely riveting.
His Brutus is a man of fierce
intelligence and precarious
self-confidence; more impor
tantly though he is equally ef
fective on all of O'Neill's
levels. Where other actors
might have concentrated on
making the play primarily an al
legory of the history of the
black man, or primarily a study
in the mind, Glover makes it all
of these and insures that we
never rest easy,

He descends from the upper
corner of the stylized set and
gradually takes us in; then,
when we've been trapped he
unleashes the fears that send
the theater reeling. It leaves us
stunned, and a little confused,
but it invites extended discus
sion.
And that intelligence, I sup
pose, is what is most appealing
about this production. Most of
the theater in the city these
days fosters no such desire to
think; "Jones" is distinctly dif
ferent at the same time it cuts
to the bone.
