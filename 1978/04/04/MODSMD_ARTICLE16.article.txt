### 
"Sly Fox," that play with Jac
kie Cleason that just opened in
the city, has found itself on the
receiving end of huge amounts
of publicity. Because it is gen
erally thought to be the pro
duct of an effort to bring big
lime theater to San Francisco
almost all of the ballyhoo has
been positive.
Most reviews of the play
begin with a few moments of
mock-condescension towards
the script (it is a bastardized
update of Ben Jonson's "Vol
pone," reset in the 1680s in San
Francisco); immediately there
after the comments are
apologized for or pushed aside
as irrelevant. The important
tHring, ? .ey would tell us, is not
iKa the play would send any
one expecting to see Jonson's
wo*k into a coma; rather it has
to io witl' energy and big
timeness ol the production,
the ir.jrtant thing is that "Sly
Fox" is a rollicking, happy,
never-say-die, bawdoriffic play
with a superstar in the lead,
and that it has a snappy
dialogue, funny sets, spon
tanaeity and big sets.
Theater
Watching the play, you get a
sense that the audience has
taken the publicity to heart.
They applaud everything until
they threaten to make fools of
themselves, and at the end
they bring the actors back for
one or two or three encores.

Everyone seems to have their
hearts set on being able to brag
when they get home on how
great a time they just had at the
theater.
And sometimes it is more
than you can bear. You want to
stand on your chair with a
megaphone and ask everyone
what the hell they are doing;
you want to run to the edge of
the stage and scream insults for
no reason at all. Somebody has
to tell this play that it stinks,
you keep thinking, though you
do your best not to let on —
somebody big, with small
lapels and a deep Shakespea
rean voice.
Somebody has to tell the
principles in "Sly Fox" that it
grates on the nerves to hear
every line delivered as if it were
a final chance for comic im
mortality; somebody has to
stalk out of the place waving
their copy of Ben Jonson.
Stupid
"Sly Fox" is San Francisco's
answer to The Carol Burnett
show. It is an amusing,
anaesthetic exercise in taste
fully raunchy humor, and in all
of its 2Vi hours it shows nary a
sign of a brain. It is a stupid play
engineered to capitalize on
every ounce of its stupidity,
and the worst thing about it is
that everyone involved seems
to think the thing is a gem. Well
I didn't. I liked "Volpone."

to tell this play that it stinks,
you keep thinking, though you
do your best not to let on —
somebody big, with small
lapels and a deep Shakespea
rean voice.
Somebody has to tell the
principles in "Sly Fox" that it
grates on the nerves to hear
every line delivered as if it were
a final chance for comic im
mortality; somebody has to
stalk out of the place waving
their copy of Ben Jonson.
Stupid
"Sly Fox" is San Francisco's
answer to The Carol Burnett
show. It is an amusing,
anaesthetic exercise in taste
fully raunchy humor, and in all
of its 2Vi hours it shows nary a
sign of a brain. It is a stupid play
engineered to capitalize on
every ounce of its stupidity,
and the worst thing about it is
that everyone involved seems
to think the thing is a gem. Well
I didn't. I liked "Volpone."
