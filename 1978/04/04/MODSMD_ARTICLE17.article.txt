Brian De Palma has always
been an excessive director. In
the past, these excesses have
given his films a frenzied,
bizarrely fascinating style
("Carrie," "Phantom of the
Paradise"). Style is the tough
est thing for a director to grasp,
but DePalma has always had it.
Excess and horrific style are
all that DePalma shows us in his
new film "The Fury." The
"style" here is repulsion; De-
Palma and his producer Frank
Vablans must have decided
that you can no longer surprise
an audience; the theory here is
that you hit them often and
h.ird, until fheir sensibilities
are so shell-shocked that they
think they've just experienced
something.
DePalma probably got Mr.
("Give the dumb masses what
they want") Yablans to finance
this film by persuading him
that he was going to make his
commerically successful "Car
rie" over again. And essen
tially, that's what DePalma has
done; "Carrie's" telekinesis
hocus-pocus is repeated in
"The Fury" — objects, bodies,
and blood fly about constantly.
The plot centers around a
boy — with the required super
psychic powers-— who has
been captured by "them." Kirk
Douglas plays the boy's father
and Amy Irving plays a girl who
also has the required super
psychic powers. These two
spend the whole film trying to
find the super psychic boy.

)ames Farris' screenplay is an
insipid, heavy-handed mess
with no human focus, sus
tained narrative drive, or any
recognizable human emotion.
This flaw is compounded by
DePalma's total waste of the ac
tors in this film. "The Fury"
misuses more actors than any
other film I've seen since
"Voyage of the Damned." The
normally explosive Charles
Durning (as a director of an ESP
institute) delivers his leaden
pseudo-scientific lines with an
obvious eagerness to be
somewhere else.
Needless to say, the film suf
fers from a severe loss of cre
dibility at the end. None of the
characters have been defined;
the boy's (played in witless
fashion by Andrew Stevens,
who seems to have been cho
sen for the part because of his
ability to make the veins in his
forehead stand out in menac
ing fashion) motivations are
especially unclear.
The film's "climax" is so
ridiculous that you begin to
wonder whether the film is a
conscious attempt at parody
on DePalma's part. When Amy
Irving (who has inherited the
now dead Stevens' powers) lit
erally blows up )ohn Cassa
vetes, DePalma shoots the exp
losion (complete with flying
head) from about six different
camera angles, and he shows
us each perspective in slow
motion. What can you do but
laugh (or leave the theater)? If

the rest of this all-too-serious
film were played for parody, it
might have been an hysterical
romp (like DePalma's own
"Phantom of the Paradise," a
satire on the rock business).
DePalma has the technique
and style that few directors
have ever had, but in "The Fury"
he has no soul, and that finally
is what is wrong with this
empty style piece.
☆ ☆☆
Matter-of-factness is the life
and death of "Straight Time."
At its best, the Dustin
Hoffmaned film version of Ed
ward Bunker's "No Beast So
Fierce" has a good-natured
normalcy and distance that
permits it to be objective about
an ex-con's nightmare; at its
less-than-best the thing is just
another scathing indictment of
the American criminal justice
system.
"Straight Time" is a movie
about a man named Max
Dembo (Hoffman), and his ill
fated attempt to overcome six
years in prison. Dembo finds it
hard to believe he has survived
those years, and he does every
thing in his power to avoid
more.
But Dembo has a rotten
parole office, one J. Emmette
Walsh. Walsh re-arrests
Hoffman for shooting up in his
motel room (he didn't), and
asks racist questions about
Dembo's girlfriend, so Dembo
beats up Walsh and leaves him
chained (naked) to the center

divider of a major Los Angeles
metropolitan freeway. Then he
robs a Chinese grocery store,
knocks off a bank, goes
bananas, kills his friend and
loses his girl. Back to jail.
Until the bank knock-off this
is a pretty good movie.
Hoffman's dazed posture and
good intentions make us glad
he never met Dirty Harry, and
Theresa Russel's performance
as a tough-but-easy woman
from the employment agency
is similarly well restrained. And
Harry Dean Stanton's ). Em
mett Walsh is a masterpiece of
slimyness. The exchanges be
tween Hoffman and Stanton
are the highpoints of "Straight
Time," and their final alterca
tion makes the whole picture
worthwhile, almost.
Sadly, after Dembo puts the
finishing touches on ol' fatso,
the movie goes straight down
the toilet. It remains economi
cal, and restrained, but it loses
the perspective that had thus
far kept it from being your
basic two-hour reverse "Drag
net." Dembo's good inten
tions are forever set against the
rotten and horrible force-you
into-a-1 ife-of-crime-and-t hen
some pressures of The Ameri
can Dream (booooo), and
Hoffman cannot sustain his
craftsmanship under the bur
den. "Straight Time," from that
point on, becomes indistin
guishable from 90 zillion other
ex-con movies. And I didn't
like them either.

Matter-of-factness is the life

At its best, the Dustin
Hoffmaned film version of Ed

"Straight Time" is a movie
about a man named Max
Dembo (Hoffman), and his ill
fated attempt to overcome six
years in prison. Dembo finds it
hard to believe he has survived
those years, and he does every
thing in his power to avoid
more.
But Dembo has a rotten
parole office, one J. Emmette
Walsh. Walsh re-arrests
Hoffman for shooting up in his
motel room (he didn't), and
asks racist questions about
Dembo's girlfriend, so Dembo
beats up Walsh and leaves him
chained (naked) to the center

divider of a major Los Angeles
metropolitan freeway. Then he
robs a Chinese grocery store,
knocks off a bank, goes
bananas, kills his friend and
loses his girl. Back to jail.
Until the bank knock-off this
is a pretty good movie.
Hoffman's dazed posture and
good intentions make us glad
he never met Dirty Harry, and
Theresa Russel's performance
as a tough-but-easy woman
from the employment agency

Harry Dean Stanton's ). Em
mett Walsh is a masterpiece of
slimyness. The exchanges be
tween Hoffman and Stanton
are the highpoints of "Straight
Time," and their final alterca

worthwhile, almost.
Sadly, after Dembo puts the
finishing touches on ol' fatso,
the movie goes straight down
the toilet. It remains economi
cal, and restrained, but it loses
the perspective that had thus
far kept it from being your
basic two-hour reverse "Drag
net." Dembo's good inten
tions are forever set against the
rotten and horrible force-you
into-a-1 ife-of-crime-and-t hen
some pressures of The Ameri
can Dream (booooo), and
Hoffman cannot sustain his
craftsmanship under the bur
den. "Straight Time," from that
point on, becomes indistin

ex-con movies. And I didn't

Brian De Palma has always
been an excessive director. In
the past, these excesses have
given his films a frenzied,
bizarrely fascinating style
("Carrie," "Phantom of the
Paradise"). Style is the tough
est thing for a director to grasp,
but DePalma has always had it.
Excess and horrific style are
all that DePalma shows us in his
new film "The Fury." The
"style" here is repulsion; De-
Palma and his producer Frank
Vablans must have decided
that you can no longer surprise
an audience; the theory here is
that you hit them often and
h.ird, until fheir sensibilities
are so shell-shocked that they
think they've just experienced
something.
DePalma probably got Mr.
("Give the dumb masses what
they want") Yablans to finance
this film by persuading him
that he was going to make his
commerically successful "Car
rie" over again. And essen
tially, that's what DePalma has
done; "Carrie's" telekinesis
hocus-pocus is repeated in
"The Fury" — objects, bodies,
and blood fly about constantly.
The plot centers around a
boy — with the required super
psychic powers-— who has
been captured by "them." Kirk
Douglas plays the boy's father
and Amy Irving plays a girl who
also has the required super
psychic powers. These two
spend the whole film trying to
find the super psychic boy.

)ames Farris' screenplay is an
insipid, heavy-handed mess
with no human focus, sus
tained narrative drive, or any
recognizable human emotion.
This flaw is compounded by
DePalma's total waste of the ac
tors in this film. "The Fury"
misuses more actors than any
other film I've seen since
"Voyage of the Damned." The
normally explosive Charles
Durning (as a director of an ESP
institute) delivers his leaden
pseudo-scientific lines with an
obvious eagerness to be
somewhere else.
Needless to say, the film suf
fers from a severe loss of cre
dibility at the end. None of the
characters have been defined;
the boy's (played in witless
fashion by Andrew Stevens,
who seems to have been cho
sen for the part because of his
ability to make the veins in his
forehead stand out in menac
ing fashion) motivations are
especially unclear.
The film's "climax" is so
ridiculous that you begin to

finishing touches on ol' fatso,
the movie goes straight down
the toilet. It remains economi
cal, and restrained, but it loses
the perspective that had thus
far kept it from being your
basic two-hour reverse "Drag
net." Dembo's good inten
tions are forever set against the
rotten and horrible force-you
into-a-1 ife-of-crime-and-t hen
some pressures of The Ameri
can Dream (booooo), and
Hoffman cannot sustain his
craftsmanship under the bur
den. "Straight Time," from that
point on, becomes indistin
guishable from 90 zillion other
ex-con movies. And I didn't
like them either.
