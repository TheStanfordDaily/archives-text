## An imaginative '12th' 
### 
"Twelfth Night," Shakes
peare's playful tale of mistaken
identity and misplaced love,
has been being given an im
aginative treatment by Palo Al
to's Theatreworks.
The production was per
formed in the Palo Alto Cul
tural Center gallery, amid Pam
McCormick's environment of
plastic streamers, metal rings
and multicolored pillows. Di

rector Robert Kelley removed
some of the smaller roles and
gave their lines to other charac
ters, and the result was a tigher
ensemble. The athletic staging,
fanciful set and jester-like cos
tumes complemented the un
likely turns of the plot, creating
a mythical isle of lllyria where
anything can happen, as long
as it turns out for the best.
Michelle Casey played the

spunky Viola, shipwrecked on
lllyria, who disguises herself as
a boy in order to serve the
Duke Orsino who rules the is
land. Her portrayal lacked
depth, but Cassy made up for
that lack with her energy and
appealing ingenuousness.
Tom Woosman was dashing as
her distracted love, Orsino.
Mark Kemp as Viola's twin
brother, Sebastian, spoke well
and had good presence for
such a young actor. His com
panion, sea captain Antonio,
was played comfortably by
bushy-bearded W. Truett
Roberts.
Molly Mayock gave the
show's best performance as
Olivia, the countess who falls
for the disguised Viola.
Mayock was utterly poised and
elegant, and managed to make
the haughty countess sym
pathetically human.
Also well-acted were the
characters that make up the
comic subplot: Nancy Palmer
lones as a self-assured and sexy
Maria, Steven Young as the
blustering sot Sir Toby Belch,
and director Kelly as the
simpleminded Sir Andrew
Aguecheek. The only disap
pointing portrayal was Burton
Suchoff's Malvolio. Suchoff
dropped some of his lines, and
played the posturing servant
too blandly; it is a part that re
quires more caricature.
The difficult role of Feste,
the fool, was made more dif
ficult by the addition of extra
lines and the responsibility of
carrying the play's transitions.
Teirrah McNair handled the
job confidently, with some
amusing anachronous touches
like her impersonalization of
the parish priest as a down
home gospel preacher.
The production was marred
by sections that dragged,
especially during monologues,
and many of the physical gags
were carried on long past
being funny. But the spirited
cast and the lightheartedness
of Shakespeare's script made it
for the most part a lively, enter
taining production.
