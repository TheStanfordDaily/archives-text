# Carter warns S. Africa over control of Namibia

### 
Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter returned home yester
day from his precedent-setting Third
World tour during which he warned
South Africa that failure to accept
reasonable proposals to end white
rule in black Namibia could lead to
serious trouble with the United
States.
The president landed at Andrews
Air Force Base outside Washington
after a nearly 10-hour flight from
Liberia on the West Coast of Africa.
Carter received a wild welcome dur
ing a four-hour stopover in Liberia.
His trip, which earlier had taken
him to Lagos, Nigeria, was the first
official visit by an American presi
dent to black Africa. Carter, who left
Washington seven days ago, also
went to Venezuela and Brazil.
"I thought it was a great trip," he
said, summing up the 14,575-mile
journey with his wife, Rosalynn, and
their 10-year-old daughter, Amy.
"Much better than we had antici
pated in every way."
Carter's most enthusiastic wel
come came in Liberia, where the
government declared a holiday and
tens of thousands — men in western
garb, youngsters in dashikis and
bare-breasted women in colorful
skirts — cheered, waved palm fronds
and danced in the streets.
"The crowd has gone wild!"
shouted an announcer on Liberian
radio. "There is absolutely no con
trol! This is impossible!"
Amy stood in her father's

limousine with its top removed and
waved. The president stood from
time to time and waved, too.
Carter told reporters on his flight
to Monrovia that if the South Africans
"reject a reasonable proposal and
move unilaterally, it would be a seri
ous indication of their unwillingness
to comply" with the views and deci
sions of the world community.
Such action by South Africa, Carter
said, was "one thing that can precipi
tate a more serious difference bet
ween us and South Africa."
The United States and four other
western powers are trying to

negotiate peaceful South African
withdrawal from Namibia, the black
nationalist name for South-West Af
rica, where the black majority is held
under white South African rule in
open defiance of the United Nations.
The president, in his warning to
South African Prime Minister John
Vorster, did not say what action the
United States might take.
U.S. rejection of a total economic
embargo against South Africa was
one of the key differences that de
veloped during the president's talks
with Nigerian leader Olusegun
Obasanjo.
