'Annie Hall' named best picture
Hollywood — "Annie Hall," Woody Allen's wry
comedy of his frustrations in love, was named best
picture of 1977 at the 50th Academy Awards pre
sentation last night.
Richard Dreyfuss, the erstwhile actor in "The
Goodbye Girl," and Diane Keaton, the wilful
sweetheart of Woody Allen in "Annie Hall," were
named best performers.
Vanessa Redgrave, the anti-Nazi martyr of
"Julia," and Jason Robards, who played mystery
writer Dashiell Hammett in the same film, won
Oscars as best supporting players.
Redgrave began the awards with a minor uproar
by congratulating Academy voters for standing
firm against "Zionist hoodlums."
The awards for best director and best original
screenplay writer went to Woody Allen for his
acerbic, autobiographical "Annie Hall."
"Star Wars," the top money-grossing film of all
time, racked up several early awards, including
best score and best visual effects.
Outside the Music Center, groups of lewish and
Arab protestors gathered hours before the cere
mony began to protest and support Redgrave's
nomination.
One released in strangler case
Los Angeles — Police released one of two men
being questioned in the so-called Hillside Strang
ler case yesterday after what had been called "a
major break" in the grisly series of murders fizzled
out.
Peter Mark Jones, a 37-year-olc| handyman,
walked out of police headquarters here shortly
after Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates told
reporters that investigators had been unable to
substantiate charges against him.
Jones had been booked for investigation of
murder last Thursday after an acquaintance,
George Francis Shamsak, implicated him in two of
the 13 murders that have stymied police since last
September. Shamshak, a 27-year-old convicted
robber, reportedly told police that he had driven
Jones' van while Jones killed two women in the
back.
"We have been unable to find evidence to sup
port the statements that Mr. Shamshak made
about Mr. Jones and we find that it would be highly
improper to continue to hold him," said Gates,
who had called (ones' arrest last Thursday "a major
break" in the case.
Court overturns safety ruling
Washington — The Supreme Court, chastising
judges for "Monday morning quarterbacking,"
gave the federal government greater freedom in
determining the nation's nuclear energy policy.
Federal courts may play only a limited role in
protecting the public from any possible dangers of
nuclear power plants, the justices said unanim
ously yesterday.

Their decision struck down a ruling by the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington that the
federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission does too
little to ensure nuclear safety.
The lower court had required the commission to
upgrade its rules covering radioactive waste. It
also had ruled that the commission must first con
sider all possible alternatives before granting
licenses for construction and operation of nuclear
reactors.
Yesterday's decision nullifies those court
imposed requirements — providing an important
legal victory for the commission and 16 power
companies which had sought Supreme Court re
versal.
Israel announces withdrawal
Israel announced yesterday that it had started a
gradual withdrawal from southern Lebanon, oc
cupied by Israeli forces in an air, land and sea
strike against Palestinian guerrilla positions last
month.
The Israeli military command said a "significant
thinning-out of forces" had begun a week ago and
that its soldiers were being replaced by United
Nations peacekeeping troops. But the command
gave no details of the withdrawal, saying: "The
plan will be made public only after the subject has
been finalized with the U.N. authorities."
In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Wal
dheim said that of a planned 4000 U.N. troops,
about 1800 have been deployed so far and a total of
3000 will be in place by next week. Israel had said
earlier it would withdraw when the U.N. force was
fully deployed.
Waldheim's report said 672 French troops, 195
Iranians, 224 Swedes and 690 Norwegians were in
place so far between the Israelis and Palestinians.
Park calls his career 'a success'
Washington — Korean rice dealer Tongsun Park,
saying his career was an "American success story,"
publicly testified yesterday that he gave more than
$850,000 to selected members of Congress.
However, he denied — as he has repeatedly —
that he was acting as an agent of the South Korean
government when he made those contributions.
Although acknowledging he had made mis
takes, he swore that he engaged in no illegal con
spiracy to buy influence for his country or for
himself.
"I want to tell you: What I have done in
Washington constitutes an American success story
on a small scale," he said.
Park gave his first public testimony in an appear
ance before the House ethics committee.
He said that while he did hope to influence
congressional opinion in favor of his country, he
was doing so simply as a patriotic and aspiring
South Korean businessman.
Steel price increase withdrawn
Pittsburgh — At President Jimmy Carter's urging,

U.S. Steel and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel with
drew a price increase yesterday and said market
forces will determine a new price level.
The announcement appeared to be a victory for
Carter's voluntary wage and price restraint prog
ram.
U.S. Steel, the nation's largest producer, and
Wheeling-Pittsburgh, the ninth-largest producer,
had announced increases of $10.50 a ton on most
mill products. But they were expected to fall in line
with other steelmakers, who have said they will
boost prices an average of $5.50 a ton.
The increases are likely to affect the prices of a
wide range of consumer products including, not
ably, appliances and cars.
Producers say higher prices are needed to offset
the added cost of bituminous coal under a con
tract t! iat sent miners back to work last week after a
110-day walkout.
The increases are the second this year for steel.
A 5.5 per cent hike for major products, including
those used by makers of autos and other con
sumer goods, took effect in February and March.
Hotel room a 'shrine' to King
Memphis, Tenn. — They don't rent Room 306 at
the Lorraine Motel anymore. It's a shrine to a guest
assassinated 10 years ago on the balcony outside.
"That room belongs to the memory of Dr. Mar
tin Luther King and will never be occupied again by
a mortal man," says Walter Bailey Sr., the motel's
owner.
In the decade since, the Lorraine has fallen on
hard times, in part, ironically, because the civil
rights movement has enabled blacks to freely use
the plush national chain hostelries all over Mem
phis.
At first, thousands made their way to 406 Mul
berry Street to see the spot where King fell. Now
only a few of the curious drive slowly down the
narrow, littered street, craning for a look. Even
fewer bother to stop.
Dow Jones declines 6.32
New York — Uneasiness over the slumping dol
lar and talk of tighter credit helped drive the stock
market into a broad decline yesterday.
The Dow )ones average of 40 industrials fell 6.32
to 751.04, on top of a 4.42-point loss over the final
two sessions of last week.
Declines held an edge of nearly 3 to 1 over ad
vances on the New York Stock Exchange, with
some 1071 issues posting losses.

writer Dashiell Hammett in the same film, won
Oscars as best supporting players.
Redgrave began the awards with a minor uproar
by congratulating Academy voters for standing
firm against "Zionist hoodlums."
The awards for best director and best original
screenplay writer went to Woody Allen for his
acerbic, autobiographical "Annie Hall."
"Star Wars," the top money-grossing film of all
time, racked up several early awards, including
best score and best visual effects.
Outside the Music Center, groups of lewish and
Arab protestors gathered hours before the cere
mony began to protest and support Redgrave's
nomination.
One released in strangler case
Los Angeles — Police released one of two men
being questioned in the so-called Hillside Strang
ler case yesterday after what had been called "a
major break" in the grisly series of murders fizzled
out.
Peter Mark Jones, a 37-year-olc| handyman,
walked out of police headquarters here shortly
after Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates told
reporters that investigators had been unable to
substantiate charges against him.
Jones had been booked for investigation of
murder last Thursday after an acquaintance,
George Francis Shamsak, implicated him in two of
the 13 murders that have stymied police since last
September. Shamshak, a 27-year-old convicted
robber, reportedly told police that he had driven
Jones' van while Jones killed two women in the
back.
"We have been unable to find evidence to sup
port the statements that Mr. Shamshak made
about Mr. Jones and we find that it would be highly
improper to continue to hold him," said Gates,
who had called (ones' arrest last Thursday "a major
break" in the case.
Court overturns safety ruling
Washington — The Supreme Court, chastising
judges for "Monday morning quarterbacking,"
gave the federal government greater freedom in
determining the nation's nuclear energy policy.
Federal courts may play only a limited role in
protecting the public from any possible dangers of
nuclear power plants, the justices said unanim
ously yesterday.

Their decision struck down a ruling by the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington that the
federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission does too
little to ensure nuclear safety.
The lower court had required the commission to
upgrade its rules covering radioactive waste. It
also had ruled that the commission must first con
sider all possible alternatives before granting
licenses for construction and operation of nuclear
reactors.
Yesterday's decision nullifies those court
imposed requirements — providing an important
legal victory for the commission and 16 power
companies which had sought Supreme Court re
versal.
Israel announces withdrawal
Israel announced yesterday that it had started a
gradual withdrawal from southern Lebanon, oc
cupied by Israeli forces in an air, land and sea
strike against Palestinian guerrilla positions last
month.
The Israeli military command said a "significant
thinning-out of forces" had begun a week ago and
that its soldiers were being replaced by United
Nations peacekeeping troops. But the command
gave no details of the withdrawal, saying: "The
plan will be made public only after the subject has
been finalized with the U.N. authorities."
In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Wal
dheim said that of a planned 4000 U.N. troops,
about 1800 have been deployed so far and a total of
3000 will be in place by next week. Israel had said
earlier it would withdraw when the U.N. force was
fully deployed.
Waldheim's report said 672 French troops, 195
Iranians, 224 Swedes and 690 Norwegians were in
place so far between the Israelis and Palestinians.
Park calls his career 'a success'
Washington — Korean rice dealer Tongsun Park,
saying his career was an "American success story,"
publicly testified yesterday that he gave more than
$850,000 to selected members of Congress.
However, he denied — as he has repeatedly —
that he was acting as an agent of the South Korean
government when he made those contributions.
Although acknowledging he had made mis
takes, he swore that he engaged in no illegal con
spiracy to buy influence for his country or for
himself.
"I want to tell you: What I have done in
Washington constitutes an American success story
on a small scale," he said.
Park gave his first public testimony in an appear
ance before the House ethics committee.
He said that while he did hope to influence
congressional opinion in favor of his country, he
was doing so simply as a patriotic and aspiring
South Korean businessman.
Steel price increase withdrawn
Pittsburgh — At President Jimmy Carter's urging,

U.S. Steel and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel with
drew a price increase yesterday and said market
forces will determine a new price level.
The announcement appeared to be a victory for
Carter's voluntary wage and price restraint prog
ram.
U.S. Steel, the nation's largest producer, and
Wheeling-Pittsburgh, the ninth-largest producer,
had announced increases of $10.50 a ton on most
mill products. But they were expected to fall in line
with other steelmakers, who have said they will
boost prices an average of $5.50 a ton.
The increases are likely to affect the prices of a
wide range of consumer products including, not
ably, appliances and cars.
Producers say higher prices are needed to offset
the added cost of bituminous coal under a con
tract t! iat sent miners back to work last week after a
110-day walkout.
The increases are the second this year for steel.
A 5.5 per cent hike for major products, including
those used by makers of autos and other con
sumer goods, took effect in February and March.
Hotel room a 'shrine' to King
Memphis, Tenn. — They don't rent Room 306 at
the Lorraine Motel anymore. It's a shrine to a guest
assassinated 10 years ago on the balcony outside.
"That room belongs to the memory of Dr. Mar
tin Luther King and will never be occupied again by
a mortal man," says Walter Bailey Sr., the motel's
owner.
In the decade since, the Lorraine has fallen on
hard times, in part, ironically, because the civil
rights movement has enabled blacks to freely use
the plush national chain hostelries all over Mem
phis.
At first, thousands made their way to 406 Mul
berry Street to see the spot where King fell. Now
only a few of the curious drive slowly down the
narrow, littered street, craning for a look. Even
fewer bother to stop.
Dow Jones declines 6.32
New York — Uneasiness over the slumping dol
lar and talk of tighter credit helped drive the stock
market into a broad decline yesterday.
The Dow )ones average of 40 industrials fell 6.32
to 751.04, on top of a 4.42-point loss over the final
two sessions of last week.
Declines held an edge of nearly 3 to 1 over ad
vances on the New York Stock Exchange, with
some 1071 issues posting losses.

One released in strangler case
Los Angeles — Police released one of two men
being questioned in the so-called Hillside Strang
ler case yesterday after what had been called "a
major break" in the grisly series of murders fizzled
out.
Peter Mark Jones, a 37-year-olc| handyman,
walked out of police headquarters here shortly
after Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates told
reporters that investigators had been unable to
substantiate charges against him.
Jones had been booked for investigation of
murder last Thursday after an acquaintance,
George Francis Shamsak, implicated him in two of
the 13 murders that have stymied police since last
September. Shamshak, a 27-year-old convicted
robber, reportedly told police that he had driven
Jones' van while Jones killed two women in the
back.
"We have been unable to find evidence to sup
port the statements that Mr. Shamshak made
about Mr. Jones and we find that it would be highly
improper to continue to hold him," said Gates,
who had called (ones' arrest last Thursday "a major
break" in the case.
Court overturns safety ruling
Washington — The Supreme Court, chastising
judges for "Monday morning quarterbacking,"
gave the federal government greater freedom in
determining the nation's nuclear energy policy.
Federal courts may play only a limited role in
protecting the public from any possible dangers of
nuclear power plants, the justices said unanim
ously yesterday.

Their decision struck down a ruling by the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington that the
federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission does too
little to ensure nuclear safety.
The lower court had required the commission to
upgrade its rules covering radioactive waste. It
also had ruled that the commission must first con
sider all possible alternatives before granting
licenses for construction and operation of nuclear
reactors.
Yesterday's decision nullifies those court
imposed requirements — providing an important
legal victory for the commission and 16 power
companies which had sought Supreme Court re
versal.
Israel announces withdrawal
Israel announced yesterday that it had started a
gradual withdrawal from southern Lebanon, oc
cupied by Israeli forces in an air, land and sea
strike against Palestinian guerrilla positions last
month.
The Israeli military command said a "significant
thinning-out of forces" had begun a week ago and
that its soldiers were being replaced by United
Nations peacekeeping troops. But the command
gave no details of the withdrawal, saying: "The
plan will be made public only after the subject has
been finalized with the U.N. authorities."
In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Wal
dheim said that of a planned 4000 U.N. troops,
about 1800 have been deployed so far and a total of
3000 will be in place by next week. Israel had said
earlier it would withdraw when the U.N. force was
fully deployed.
Waldheim's report said 672 French troops, 195
Iranians, 224 Swedes and 690 Norwegians were in
place so far between the Israelis and Palestinians.
Park calls his career 'a success'
Washington — Korean rice dealer Tongsun Park,
saying his career was an "American success story,"
publicly testified yesterday that he gave more than
$850,000 to selected members of Congress.
However, he denied — as he has repeatedly —
that he was acting as an agent of the South Korean
government when he made those contributions.
Although acknowledging he had made mis
takes, he swore that he engaged in no illegal con
spiracy to buy influence for his country or for
himself.
"I want to tell you: What I have done in
Washington constitutes an American success story
on a small scale," he said.
Park gave his first public testimony in an appear
ance before the House ethics committee.
He said that while he did hope to influence
congressional opinion in favor of his country, he
was doing so simply as a patriotic and aspiring
South Korean businessman.
Steel price increase withdrawn
Pittsburgh — At President Jimmy Carter's urging,

U.S. Steel and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel with
drew a price increase yesterday and said market
forces will determine a new price level.
The announcement appeared to be a victory for
Carter's voluntary wage and price restraint prog
ram.
U.S. Steel, the nation's largest producer, and
Wheeling-Pittsburgh, the ninth-largest producer,
had announced increases of $10.50 a ton on most
mill products. But they were expected to fall in line
with other steelmakers, who have said they will
boost prices an average of $5.50 a ton.
The increases are likely to affect the prices of a
wide range of consumer products including, not
ably, appliances and cars.
Producers say higher prices are needed to offset
the added cost of bituminous coal under a con
tract t! iat sent miners back to work last week after a
110-day walkout.
The increases are the second this year for steel.
A 5.5 per cent hike for major products, including
those used by makers of autos and other con
sumer goods, took effect in February and March.
Hotel room a 'shrine' to King
Memphis, Tenn. — They don't rent Room 306 at
the Lorraine Motel anymore. It's a shrine to a guest
assassinated 10 years ago on the balcony outside.
"That room belongs to the memory of Dr. Mar
tin Luther King and will never be occupied again by
a mortal man," says Walter Bailey Sr., the motel's
owner.
In the decade since, the Lorraine has fallen on
hard times, in part, ironically, because the civil
rights movement has enabled blacks to freely use
the plush national chain hostelries all over Mem
phis.
At first, thousands made their way to 406 Mul
berry Street to see the spot where King fell. Now
only a few of the curious drive slowly down the
narrow, littered street, craning for a look. Even
fewer bother to stop.
Dow Jones declines 6.32
New York — Uneasiness over the slumping dol
lar and talk of tighter credit helped drive the stock
market into a broad decline yesterday.
The Dow )ones average of 40 industrials fell 6.32
to 751.04, on top of a 4.42-point loss over the final
two sessions of last week.
Declines held an edge of nearly 3 to 1 over ad
vances on the New York Stock Exchange, with
some 1071 issues posting losses.

'Annie Hall' named best picture
Hollywood — "Annie Hall," Woody Allen's wry
comedy of his frustrations in love, was named best
picture of 1977 at the 50th Academy Awards pre
sentation last night.
Richard Dreyfuss, the erstwhile actor in "The
Goodbye Girl," and Diane Keaton, the wilful
sweetheart of Woody Allen in "Annie Hall," were
named best performers.
Vanessa Redgrave, the anti-Nazi martyr of
"Julia," and Jason Robards, who played mystery
writer Dashiell Hammett in the same film, won
Oscars as best supporting players.
Redgrave began the awards with a minor uproar
by congratulating Academy voters for standing
firm against "Zionist hoodlums."
The awards for best director and best original
screenplay writer went to Woody Allen for his
acerbic, autobiographical "Annie Hall."
"Star Wars," the top money-grossing film of all
time, racked up several early awards, including
best score and best visual effects.
Outside the Music Center, groups of lewish and
Arab protestors gathered hours before the cere
mony began to protest and support Redgrave's
