# Senate urges more overseas teaching

### Peter Brett 
More regular faculty should be in
volved in teaching the University's
overseas academic programs, the Fa
culty Senate indicated at its Dead
Week meeting on March 16.
Its action, taken by divided voice
vote, followed a report from Over
seas Studies Director Mark Mancall
indicating that total faculty participa
tion from the home campus has de
clined from a peak of 37 in 1967-68 to
just seven this year.
English Prof. William Chace noted
that a recent ASSU task force report
on overseas studies said this prog
ram "seems to have lost touch with,
and the support of, a great portion of
the Stanford Community."
Data presented by Mancall to the
senate indicated a generally high
level of demand for the existing
programs, however.
Humanities and Sciences Dean
Halsey Royden said the decline of
Academic Council members' partici
pation overseas was "quite surpris
ing and very discouraging."
Admissions Dean Fred Hargadon
noted that "it's pretty well estab
lished that what attracts students" to
Stanford and other top universities is
"substantial academic programs."
The extent of Stanford's own prog
rams abroad is unusual and attractive
to many applicants, Hargadon said.
The Advisory Committee on
Budget Planning reported on finan
cial problems with the library, com
putation center and energy costs.
"The library problem is very
great," according to Prof. Calvin
Quate, chairman of the committee.
"The library can hardly afford to buy
books, restore them and house
them, and these problems won't dis
appear," said Quate. As a result of
their efforts, a task force has been
appointed to look into the problem.
The computation center is suffer
ing as a result of a change in technol
ogy. Furthermore, the price of com
puters hasgoneway up, according to
Quate.
Energy and maintenance costs also
are on the rise. By and large, though,
"we are very well managed," said
Quate.
The senate also passed a resolu
tion calling upon all members of the
Stanford academic community to
consider the social implications of
their use of language and to avoid

words that may be socially prejudi
cial or discriminatory. History Prof.
Dorothy Atkinson, sponsor of the re
solution, said "we as educators have
special responsibility in this area."
The use of sexist language is "intel
lectual malpractice," according to
Atkinson.
