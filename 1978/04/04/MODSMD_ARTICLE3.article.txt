# Task force looks at library cooperation
## 
### Andrea James 
One main library trying to coordi
nate its activities with six quasi
independent libraries can be difficult
for both University administrators
and researching students. To help
solve this problem the Academic
Council has appointed a task force to
look into relations among campus
libraries.
The task force, appropriately cal
led Relations Among Libraries, is a
subcommittee of the Academic
Council Committee on Libraries,
chaired by Alexander Dallin, profes
sor of history. The task force itself is
headed by Leon Seltzer, director of
the Stanford University Press.
Task force members were ap
pointed last fall.
"We are only concerned with
gathering facts right now," Seltzer
said. "We're asking questions on
how the six quasi-independent lib
raries integrate with Main (Green)
Library, how their materials are col
lected, and where those materials
appear if they are not included in the
general collection."
The task force is looking into col
lection procedures at lane Medical
Library and at libraries in Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC),
Law School, Business School,

Hoover Institution and the Food Re
search Institute.
"So far, we have only looked
closely into Hoover's library," Selt
zer said.
"The seven libraries have many
overlapping responsibilities," Selt
zer said. "So far we have found many
differences of opinion on how these
responsibilities must be carried out
and it will take quite some time to
evaluate these opinions and come to
some sort of conclusion."
He added that task force members
are "talking to all the people we can
think of" for opinions.
"We're talking to students, ad
ministrators, the provost's budget
office — everyone," Seltzer said.
"We will be fortunate if we can
make any kind of a report this year,"
Seltzer said. "We have no long
range, definite plans at this time."
He added that because facts and
information "are scattered all over
the campus/' committee members
are having to do a considerable
amount of work.
"No one knew how much work
this would involve," Seltzer said. "I
think the members of the committee
have been remarkably faithful.
We've been meeting about twice a
week for at least two hours a week."
