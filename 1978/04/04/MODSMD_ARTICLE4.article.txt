# Emergency room billing practice clarified
## 
### Andrea James 
Only faculty physicians who
"either directly deliver or directly
participate" in emergency services
can now bill for professional fees,
according to Michael Eliastam, direc
tor of emergency services at Stanford
Hospital.
The emergency room stopped all
billing for professional services last
February in order to make sure its
billing practices conformed to legal
standards, hospital authorities said at
that time.
However, Eliastam said although
some patients are now being billed, a
review is still in process.
"We're looking to see how pa
tients are being billed and when they
are being billed," he explained.
Eliastam said before billing was
halted in the emergency room, the
hospital was billinga professional f*Â»e
and an institutional fee in all in
stances except Medicare cases.
"We are now using a standard that
conforms to all guidelines," he ad
ded.
Billing patients
Carl Hitchner, associate staff
counsel for the Medical Center, said
he advised hospital administrators to
bill patients for a professional fee
only when there was "identifiable
personal involvement."
According to Hitchner, identifi
able personal involvement is used
when billing for MediCal and Medi
care services.

"The hospital must show
documented proof that this personal
involvement took place before it can
bill for services rendered under Med
iCal or Medicare," he added.
He said no one really knows what
the emergency room standard was in
billing private patients because no
documentation was ever necessary.
Other billing actions
Meanwhile, in action involving
other Stanford billing procedures,
Dr. Robert Weinmann, president of
the Union of American Physicians
(UAP) Local 7402, said in a press con
ference yesterday that Stanford
counsel "effectively concealed" the
fact that they "ghost-wrote an
amendment in order to make their
billing procedures legal.
"The union holds that Stanford is
violating billing laws and that they
effectively wrote an amendment
which would make their billing pro
cedures legal," Weinmann told the
Daily.
He added that "Stanford got the
California Medical Association
(CMA) to front the bill," a claim
which Hitchner denies.
The amendment, assembly bill AB
1781, was introduced by Assembly
man Kapiloff. According to Hitchner,
the bill merely "clarifies the language
of Section 2008 of the California Bus
iness Code."
Weinmann and the UAP say the
University is violating this code,
which states in part that medical

schools and institutions may make
"no charge for professional services
rendered patients."
"The section is very confusing, but
we do maintain that we are within the
law," Hitchner said. "The amend
ment merely clarified that law."
He said Stanford worked with Uni
versity of California Medical schools,
University of Southern California
and the University of Loma Linda in
writing the bill and that the CMA was
not involved in the bill's writing.
"We let CMA know we were writ

ing the amendment," Hitchner said.
"This was simply a matter of proper
protocol. We did not ask them for
support, and they were not in any
way involved in the bill's writing."
Hitchner explained that the bill,
which is still pending in California
legislature, assures that medical
schools which are approved by the
Board of Medical Quality Assurance
and which operate clinics staffed by
faculty physicians, can charge pro
fessional fees for services rendered
by faculty physicians.
