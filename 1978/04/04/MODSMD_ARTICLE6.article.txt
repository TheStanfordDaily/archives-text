# Meyers prefers wines, French cuisine

He drives a Fiat 128, purchased from the
factory in Turin, Italy. He enjoys French
cuisine, California wines and an occasional
Mozart piece.
His office in the Stanford Law School is
large and meticulously organized. Massive
legal volumes fill two ceiling-high book
cases.
"I would like to be an opera singer, pref
erably a baritone," he said, "justtoseewhat
it's like." But that's only if he had to do it all
over again.
Charles Meyers, 52, dean of the Stanford
Law School since August 1976, wanted to be
a lawyer from the time he was 10 years old.
He came to Stanford as a professor of law in
1962. He is a lawyer, scholar and educator
who loves opera and detests physical exer
cise.
Other positions
Besides being dean of the law school, he
is chairman of the board of Public Advo
cates, Inc., vice-chairman of Governor
Brown's Commission to Review California's
Water Rights Law, an active member of the
Association of American Law Schools, an
adviser of two ecology publications, and
the teacher of a first-year property course in
the law school.
He specializes in property, water, oil and
gas law, and has written or co-authored at
least 10 books in these fields.
"It is an on-going effort to stay active,"

said Meyers. "About 90 per cent of my time
is devoted to the goals of the Stanford Law
School.
"I like to teach. I enjoy being with stu
dents." Education isn't as restrictive as pri
vate law practice, where lawyers must serve
clients' needs, instead of pursuing their
own interests.
Meyers' hair is gray, and slight creases
run across his rugged face, but his six-foot
frame is trim and strong. It hides his lack of
physical exercise.
Navy ROTC
"Every morning at 6:30, from 1943 to 1945,
when I was in the Naval ROTC, they'd blow
the bugle," he said, laughing at the mem
ory. "We'd pile out of the dormitory, rain or
shine, and do sit-ups. I said, at the time, that
I would never do any exercise when I got
out of the Navy, and I have damn near well
held to that."
Peg Dickson, assistant to the dean, lives
in Palo Alto and works closely with Meyers.
"I've been with Charlie since August
1976," she said. "He's a very personable,
warm man; a colorful personality with a ter
rific sense of humor. He's a Texan, with a
southern charm."
Another view of Meyers is the profes
sional, the lawyer. He has been involved
with legal education since 1949. His experi
ences have produced a highly critical
character.
"I tend to be skeptical about things," he
said. "I'm always skeptical about the ability

of the government to solve problems."
Howard Williams, a Stanford professor of
law, has been a close friend of Meyers for 31
years. He taught Meyers in 1946, when
Meyers was a first-year law student, just out
of the Navy.
'Bright and sightful'
"He's very bright and sightful," said Wil
liams. "He makes and holds very warm
friendships."
Keith Mann, the associate dean of
academic affairs, explained Meyers' impati
ence.
"When he gets an idea, he wants to see it
work â€” now," said Mann. "He has a big
horizon and he's not interested in de
tours."
High-geared achiever
Mann leaned back in his chairand smiled.
He also realized that Meyers is a high
geared achiever. "As a friend, I find it hard
to keep up with him."
Meyers lives on the Stanford campus. He
and his wife, Pamela, built their house in
1966. He met Pamela on a boat going to
Europe. In 1954, they were married in
Salzburg, Austria, in a castle that was used
in the "Sound of Music" film production.
He has taught at universities across the
nation, and also at the University of Chile.
"I've lived here longer than anywhere
else in my life. This is really home for me. I
have deep roots, here," said the gray
haired Texan, with the southern charm and
the big horizons.
