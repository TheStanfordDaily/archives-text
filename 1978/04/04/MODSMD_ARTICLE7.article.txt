## Civil Rights reassessed Blacks honor Martin Luther King 
### 
Keith Archuleta

The Stanford Black Student Union
is sponsoring a memorial rally today
at noon in White Plaza, in honor of
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
The event is in recognition of the
10th anniversary of the assassination
of Dr. King and the continuing strug
gles of black and poor people in the
U.S.
In 1955, the Montgomery bus
boycott thrust King, who was at that
time a relatively obscure 26-year-old
Baptist minister, into the forefront of
the civil rights movement.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the
"gentle warrior," was the son of an
Atlanta preacher and a graduate of
Morehouse College, Crozer Semi
nary, and Boston University (Ph.D.
1955). King used the teachings of
Christianity and the methods of
Gandhi in his fight for civil rights. His
successes and failures earned him in
ternational fame and the Nobel
Peace Prize for 1964. He became the
second American black to win this
honor.
With the success of the Montgom
ery boycott and with the rise of new
black nations in Africa, beginning
with Ghana in 1957, blacks in
America became more insistent on
achieving their rights. King and a
group of ministers organized the
Southern Christian Leadership Con
ference in 1957.
King inspired millions
Dr. King became as revered a
leader as Frederick Douglas, inspir
ing millions with his Gandhi-like
philosophy of nonviolence. He
pointed out that "nonviolent resis
tance is not a method for cowards; it
does resist." But he said, "It does not
seek to defeat or humiliate the op
ponent, but to win his friendship and
understanding." Dr. King urged his
followers to love their enemies, "to
accept blows...without striking
back," and to accept jailing for refus
ing to obey unjust laws because "un
earned suffering is redemptive" and
can bring about change.
Unfortunately King's pleas for fair
dealing had a hard time bearing fruit.
For those pleas, like those which
other blacks had echoed for the past
two centuries, generally fell among
the thorns of the national dedication
to white supremacy and were soon
choked by those racist thorns.
Though the nation listened, it did
not inwardly digest his words suffi
ciently. King himself realized that
what was needed was a national
commitment to stamp out every ves
tige of racism, to rectify past oppres
sion, to overcome the disadvantages
fostered by centuries of racism and
discrimination, and to transform his
dream of brotherhood into reality.
The failure of the American people
to undertake such an effort left the
nation tragically divided as the 1960 s
ended, bringing to the fore voices far
more strident and tactics far less
peaceful than Dr. King's.

The nonviolence movement lost
much of its luster when Dr. King was
assassinated on April 4, 1968, while
aiding striking sanitation workers in
Memphis. He was only 39. White
Americans in 1969 shuddered at the
prospects of racial guerrilla warfare.
But many were too comfortable with
the economic and social advantages
of being white to make the commit
ment to a total national effort to end
racism and exploitation and to over
come the ill effects of centuries of
slavery, discrimination, and pre
judice.
Though King's death brought
some gains to blacks and the poor,
for the most part these gains have
been token. After King was mur
dered, a few black people got better
paying jobs; a few blacks achieved
motion picture stardom. So for a
while a few people have had a piece
of the pie, so everyone can now sit
back and relax; everyone is happy.
Or are they?
Since 1973, jobs and other "oppor
tunities" for blacks, nonwhites, and
women have steadily decreased.
In a recent article appearing in the
Afro-American Affairs newspaper,
Georgia State Senator Julian Bond
reported:
"All of the old sayings are still true.
Blacks are still the last hired and the
first fired — we are still poor out of
proportion to our numbers — we are
still powerless despite our ability to
elect presidents, hungry regardless
of integrated lunch counters, ignor
ant in spite of integrated schools."
Progress deceptive
"Blacks have now become doc
tors, lawyers, teachers and office
holders," Bond said, "but this prog
ress is deceptive. In 1971, we were 10
percent of the labor force in America
but only one percent of the mana
gers and administrators and six per
cent of the craftsmen."
Bond said that a close look at every
statistic shows while black people's
general condition has improved,
their relative condition has worse
ned. Bond characterized the situa
tion as "almost as though blacks
were climbing a molasses mountain
dressed in snow shoes, while
everyone else rides a rather rapid
ski lift to the top.
"Even now another blow against
the progress made so far is being or
ganized," Bond asserted. "There has
mounted a challenge to the affirma
tive action and equal opportunities
programs that all too slowly are pro
viding some compensation for the
victims of 200 years of a racially moti
vated quota system."

Bond pointed out that the system
has already guaranteed that white
Anglo-Saxon men will hold the
monopoly on good jobs on college
and university seats, on positions of
power and prestige in government
and on all the benefits and rewards
that America promises.
Bakke criticized
"If the U.S. Supreme Court up
holds the California court in the
Bakke case," Bond asserted, "the
most immediate effect will be the
lowering of quality health care avail
able to the residents of California."
Bond said that Bakke applied to
and was turned down by 13 medical
schools, but he made no objection.
"The dean of the school has tradi
tionally set aside five seats for the
sons and daughters of alumni who
are the children of big contributors
and politically important people in
California," Bond related. "Then 16
seats were set aside for disadvan
taged students. Six blacks, eight
Chicanos and two Asian students
were admitted and then Bakke said
no."
Bond said this fight over one seat
in the medical school at the Univer
sity of California at Davis is nothing
more than a continuation of a strug
gle of the priviledged and the power
ful to maintain their disproportion
ate share of the good life America has
to offer.
New strategies planned
As we mark the 10th anniversary of
Dr. King's death, we are faced with
the fierce urgency of NOW. The
black movement has been under
ground for several years to allow the
black community to regroup, to

analyze the movement of the 60's
and plan new strategies for the fu
ture.
Because we are now faced with the
fact that tomorrow is today, we wil
honor King with a commemorative
program of workshops on black
political, cultural, and social thought
and African American studies this
Friday and Saturday.
We remember and honor Dr. King
because he was a true leader, pos
sessing tremendous and overwhelm
ing verbal and mental power, but
more than that, he possessed im
measurable wisdom, dedication and
compassion. Human beings such as
this man are rare, to say the least. We
honor King because we remember
the nature of his commitment to
human equality and justice.
In remembering this, we know that
Dr. King did not die in vain. For there
may yet be hope. The final purpose
of King's life may be fulfilled
throught the hearts and minds of
many others. Only time will tell if the
confusion and lack of commitment
against racism will end while t(iere is
stil time to turn chaos into commun
ity.

10th anniversary of the assassination
of Dr. King and the continuing strug
gles of black and poor people in the
U.S.
In 1955, the Montgomery bus
boycott thrust King, who was at that
time a relatively obscure 26-year-old
Baptist minister, into the forefront of
the civil rights movement.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the
"gentle warrior," was the son of an
Atlanta preacher and a graduate of
Morehouse College, Crozer Semi
nary, and Boston University (Ph.D.
1955). King used the teachings of
Christianity and the methods of
Gandhi in his fight for civil rights. His
successes and failures earned him in
ternational fame and the Nobel
Peace Prize for 1964. He became the
second American black to win this
honor.
With the success of the Montgom
ery boycott and with the rise of new
black nations in Africa, beginning
with Ghana in 1957, blacks in
America became more insistent on
achieving their rights. King and a
group of ministers organized the
Southern Christian Leadership Con
ference in 1957.
King inspired millions
Dr. King became as revered a
leader as Frederick Douglas, inspir
ing millions with his Gandhi-like
philosophy of nonviolence. He
pointed out that "nonviolent resis
tance is not a method for cowards; it
does resist." But he said, "It does not
seek to defeat or humiliate the op
ponent, but to win his friendship and
understanding." Dr. King urged his
followers to love their enemies, "to
accept blows...without striking
back," and to accept jailing for refus
ing to obey unjust laws because "un
earned suffering is redemptive" and
can bring about change.
Unfortunately King's pleas for fair
dealing had a hard time bearing fruit.
For those pleas, like those which
other blacks had echoed for the past
two centuries, generally fell among
the thorns of the national dedication
to white supremacy and were soon
choked by those racist thorns.
Though the nation listened, it did
not inwardly digest his words suffi
ciently. King himself realized that
what was needed was a national
commitment to stamp out every ves
tige of racism, to rectify past oppres
sion, to overcome the disadvantages
fostered by centuries of racism and
discrimination, and to transform his
dream of brotherhood into reality.
The failure of the American people
to undertake such an effort left the
nation tragically divided as the 1960 s
ended, bringing to the fore voices far
more strident and tactics far less
peaceful than Dr. King's.

The nonviolence movement lost
much of its luster when Dr. King was
assassinated on April 4, 1968, while
aiding striking sanitation workers in
Memphis. He was only 39. White
Americans in 1969 shuddered at the
prospects of racial guerrilla warfare.
But many were too comfortable with
the economic and social advantages
of being white to make the commit
ment to a total national effort to end
racism and exploitation and to over
come the ill effects of centuries of
slavery, discrimination, and pre
judice.
Though King's death brought
some gains to blacks and the poor,
for the most part these gains have
been token. After King was mur
dered, a few black people got better
paying jobs; a few blacks achieved
motion picture stardom. So for a
while a few people have had a piece
of the pie, so everyone can now sit
back and relax; everyone is happy.
Or are they?
Since 1973, jobs and other "oppor
tunities" for blacks, nonwhites, and
women have steadily decreased.
In a recent article appearing in the
Afro-American Affairs newspaper,
Georgia State Senator Julian Bond
reported:
"All of the old sayings are still true.
Blacks are still the last hired and the
first fired — we are still poor out of
proportion to our numbers — we are
still powerless despite our ability to
elect presidents, hungry regardless
of integrated lunch counters, ignor
ant in spite of integrated schools."
Progress deceptive
"Blacks have now become doc
tors, lawyers, teachers and office
holders," Bond said, "but this prog
ress is deceptive. In 1971, we were 10
percent of the labor force in America
but only one percent of the mana
gers and administrators and six per
cent of the craftsmen."
Bond said that a close look at every
statistic shows while black people's
general condition has improved,
their relative condition has worse
ned. Bond characterized the situa
tion as "almost as though blacks
were climbing a molasses mountain
dressed in snow shoes, while
everyone else rides a rather rapid
ski lift to the top.
"Even now another blow against
the progress made so far is being or
ganized," Bond asserted. "There has
mounted a challenge to the affirma
tive action and equal opportunities
programs that all too slowly are pro
viding some compensation for the
victims of 200 years of a racially moti
vated quota system."

Bond pointed out that the system
has already guaranteed that white
Anglo-Saxon men will hold the
monopoly on good jobs on college
and university seats, on positions of
power and prestige in government
and on all the benefits and rewards
that America promises.
Bakke criticized
"If the U.S. Supreme Court up
holds the California court in the
Bakke case," Bond asserted, "the
most immediate effect will be the
lowering of quality health care avail
able to the residents of California."
Bond said that Bakke applied to
and was turned down by 13 medical
schools, but he made no objection.
"The dean of the school has tradi
tionally set aside five seats for the
sons and daughters of alumni who
are the children of big contributors
and politically important people in
California," Bond related. "Then 16
seats were set aside for disadvan
taged students. Six blacks, eight
Chicanos and two Asian students
were admitted and then Bakke said
no."
Bond said this fight over one seat
in the medical school at the Univer
sity of California at Davis is nothing
more than a continuation of a strug
gle of the priviledged and the power
ful to maintain their disproportion
ate share of the good life America has
to offer.
New strategies planned
As we mark the 10th anniversary of
Dr. King's death, we are faced with
the fierce urgency of NOW. The
black movement has been under
ground for several years to allow the
black community to regroup, to

analyze the movement of the 60's
and plan new strategies for the fu
ture.
Because we are now faced with the
fact that tomorrow is today, we wil
honor King with a commemorative
program of workshops on black
political, cultural, and social thought
and African American studies this
Friday and Saturday.
We remember and honor Dr. King
because he was a true leader, pos
sessing tremendous and overwhelm
ing verbal and mental power, but
more than that, he possessed im
measurable wisdom, dedication and
compassion. Human beings such as
this man are rare, to say the least. We
honor King because we remember
the nature of his commitment to
human equality and justice.
In remembering this, we know that
Dr. King did not die in vain. For there
may yet be hope. The final purpose
of King's life may be fulfilled
throught the hearts and minds of
many others. Only time will tell if the
confusion and lack of commitment
against racism will end while t(iere is
stil time to turn chaos into commun
ity.

boycott thrust King, who was at that
time a relatively obscure 26-year-old
Baptist minister, into the forefront of
the civil rights movement.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the
"gentle warrior," was the son of an
Atlanta preacher and a graduate of
Morehouse College, Crozer Semi
nary, and Boston University (Ph.D.
1955). King used the teachings of
Christianity and the methods of
Gandhi in his fight for civil rights. His
successes and failures earned him in
ternational fame and the Nobel
Peace Prize for 1964. He became the
second American black to win this
honor.
With the success of the Montgom
ery boycott and with the rise of new
black nations in Africa, beginning
with Ghana in 1957, blacks in
America became more insistent on
achieving their rights. King and a
group of ministers organized the
Southern Christian Leadership Con
ference in 1957.
King inspired millions
Dr. King became as revered a
leader as Frederick Douglas, inspir
ing millions with his Gandhi-like
philosophy of nonviolence. He
pointed out that "nonviolent resis
tance is not a method for cowards; it
does resist." But he said, "It does not
seek to defeat or humiliate the op
ponent, but to win his friendship and
understanding." Dr. King urged his
followers to love their enemies, "to
accept blows...without striking
back," and to accept jailing for refus
ing to obey unjust laws because "un
earned suffering is redemptive" and
can bring about change.
Unfortunately King's pleas for fair
dealing had a hard time bearing fruit.
For those pleas, like those which
other blacks had echoed for the past
two centuries, generally fell among
the thorns of the national dedication
to white supremacy and were soon
choked by those racist thorns.
Though the nation listened, it did
not inwardly digest his words suffi
ciently. King himself realized that
what was needed was a national
commitment to stamp out every ves
tige of racism, to rectify past oppres
sion, to overcome the disadvantages
fostered by centuries of racism and
discrimination, and to transform his
dream of brotherhood into reality.
The failure of the American people
to undertake such an effort left the
nation tragically divided as the 1960 s
ended, bringing to the fore voices far
more strident and tactics far less
peaceful than Dr. King's.

The nonviolence movement lost
much of its luster when Dr. King was
assassinated on April 4, 1968, while
aiding striking sanitation workers in
Memphis. He was only 39. White
Americans in 1969 shuddered at the
prospects of racial guerrilla warfare.
But many were too comfortable with
the economic and social advantages
of being white to make the commit
ment to a total national effort to end
racism and exploitation and to over
come the ill effects of centuries of
slavery, discrimination, and pre
judice.
Though King's death brought
some gains to blacks and the poor,
for the most part these gains have
been token. After King was mur
dered, a few black people got better
paying jobs; a few blacks achieved
motion picture stardom. So for a
while a few people have had a piece
of the pie, so everyone can now sit
back and relax; everyone is happy.
Or are they?
Since 1973, jobs and other "oppor
tunities" for blacks, nonwhites, and
women have steadily decreased.
In a recent article appearing in the
Afro-American Affairs newspaper,
Georgia State Senator Julian Bond
reported:
"All of the old sayings are still true.
Blacks are still the last hired and the
first fired — we are still poor out of
proportion to our numbers — we are
still powerless despite our ability to
elect presidents, hungry regardless
of integrated lunch counters, ignor
ant in spite of integrated schools."
Progress deceptive
"Blacks have now become doc
tors, lawyers, teachers and office
holders," Bond said, "but this prog
ress is deceptive. In 1971, we were 10
percent of the labor force in America
but only one percent of the mana
gers and administrators and six per
cent of the craftsmen."
Bond said that a close look at every
statistic shows while black people's
general condition has improved,
their relative condition has worse
ned. Bond characterized the situa
tion as "almost as though blacks
were climbing a molasses mountain
dressed in snow shoes, while
everyone else rides a rather rapid
ski lift to the top.
"Even now another blow against
the progress made so far is being or
ganized," Bond asserted. "There has
mounted a challenge to the affirma
tive action and equal opportunities
programs that all too slowly are pro
viding some compensation for the
victims of 200 years of a racially moti
vated quota system."

Bond pointed out that the system
has already guaranteed that white
Anglo-Saxon men will hold the
monopoly on good jobs on college
and university seats, on positions of
power and prestige in government
and on all the benefits and rewards
that America promises.
Bakke criticized
"If the U.S. Supreme Court up
holds the California court in the
Bakke case," Bond asserted, "the
most immediate effect will be the
lowering of quality health care avail
able to the residents of California."
Bond said that Bakke applied to
and was turned down by 13 medical
schools, but he made no objection.
"The dean of the school has tradi
tionally set aside five seats for the
sons and daughters of alumni who
are the children of big contributors
and politically important people in
California," Bond related. "Then 16
seats were set aside for disadvan
taged students. Six blacks, eight
Chicanos and two Asian students
were admitted and then Bakke said
no."
Bond said this fight over one seat
in the medical school at the Univer
sity of California at Davis is nothing
more than a continuation of a strug
gle of the priviledged and the power
ful to maintain their disproportion
ate share of the good life America has
to offer.
New strategies planned
As we mark the 10th anniversary of
Dr. King's death, we are faced with
the fierce urgency of NOW. The
black movement has been under
ground for several years to allow the
black community to regroup, to

analyze the movement of the 60's
and plan new strategies for the fu
ture.
Because we are now faced with the
fact that tomorrow is today, we wil
honor King with a commemorative
program of workshops on black
political, cultural, and social thought
and African American studies this
Friday and Saturday.
We remember and honor Dr. King
because he was a true leader, pos
sessing tremendous and overwhelm
ing verbal and mental power, but
more than that, he possessed im
measurable wisdom, dedication and
compassion. Human beings such as
this man are rare, to say the least. We
honor King because we remember
the nature of his commitment to
human equality and justice.
In remembering this, we know that
Dr. King did not die in vain. For there
may yet be hope. The final purpose
of King's life may be fulfilled
throught the hearts and minds of
many others. Only time will tell if the
confusion and lack of commitment
against racism will end while t(iere is
stil time to turn chaos into commun
ity.
