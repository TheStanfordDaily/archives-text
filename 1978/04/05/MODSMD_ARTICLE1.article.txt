# Internal conflicts mark USE meeting
## 
### Bill Burger 
More than 180 United Stanford
Employees (USE) members crowded
into a Tresidder room last night, wag
ing personal battles and closing
nominations for the May 2 general
officers election.
Bob Britton, USE Reporter, faces
union Secretary Jim Berk, who was
nominated last night, in the race for
USE president. The offices of assis
tant president, secretary, treasurer
and reporter will each be vied for by
at least three candidates.
The meeting once again focused
on internal disputes within the un
ion, more specifically the dissatisfac

tion of many members with the pre
sent leadership of President Anne
Schlagenhaft and Berk.
Schlagenhaft is a candidate for as
sistant president and secretary in the
upcoming election. The Britton slate
includes Don Ramsay running for as
sistant president, Mike Harris for
secretary, Karl Schroeder for trea
surer and Sylvia Harris for reporter.
Chaired meeting
Tim Twomey, a vice president of
the Service Employees International
Union from San Francisco, chaired
the meeting at the request of people
on both sides of the dispute.
The validity of the March member
ship meeting has been questioned
on the constitutionality of the re
placement of Schlagenhaft as chair
person by a vote of members pre
sent. This issue remained unresolved
after last night's meeting.
Berk called the internal disputes
"totally destructive" for the union
and said the people opposing him
are "former union bigshots who are
trying to take over the union."
Last night's meeting was very one
sided in most votes with a group of at

least 150 voting as a block on almost
every issue raised. Reports of the tre
asurer and president were resound
ingly defeated along with the prop
osed agenda.
The mail ballot passage of a con
stitutional amendment by a vote of
411 to 147 prohibiting union mem
bers from serving in office and being
a paid union employee was an
nounced at the meeting.
Anti-Berk amendment
This amendment was aimed
against Berk, who is a paid staff
employee in addition to being sec
retary. The anti-Berk forces claim the
amendment will prevent a concent
ration of power within the union
while the Berk supporters say his ta
lent must be utilized.
The amendment had been passed
at the March meeting but ir
regularities in the ballot led to a
re-run of the vote.
Another constitutional amend
ment was proposed by Schlagenhaft
which would change the regular
membership meeting from the first
Tuesday to the second Tuesday of
each month. This passed and will be

sent to the membership before the
May meeting for the two-thirds vote
required for ratification.
Berk's expenditure of over $60,000
fQr computer usage since January,
1974, drew considerable criticism at
last night's meeting. Ramsay pointed
out that "only" $36,000 had been put
iifto the union's strike fund during
that period. Some members spoke of
the added "negotiating strength"
that a larger strike fund would carry
with the University.
Written report
Motions passed at the meeting re
quiring Berk to furnish the member
ship with a written report of compu
ter costs determining "what is neces
sary from what are frills" by April 25
and limiting monthly computer costs
to $500.
Another controversy surrounded a
"phony" union newspaper that was
circulated among members on
March 30. Berk said the issue didn't
pretend to be Employees Organize
(the official USE newspaper). "We
did everything we could to keep it
from looking like the real paper,"
