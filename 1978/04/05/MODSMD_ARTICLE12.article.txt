# Harvesting machines a threat
## 
### 
Steve Barkan

The farm workers call them los
monstruos — the monsters. It is not
vampires or werewolves that the
workers look upon with such alarm,
but rather harvesting machines
being developed by the University of
California.
Used to gather such crops as to
matoes, lettuce and grapes, these
machines threaten to throw over
120,000 farm workers out of work
over the next 10 years, adding 1.2 per
cent to the state's unemployment
rate. Last summer alone the
electronic-eye tomato sorter dis
placed over 7500 workers. As a result
of such "progress," farm workers
will be forced onto the unemploy
ment lines and welfare rolls, costing
over $2 billion in lost revenues on the
one hand and increased government
services on the other.
Mechanization in the fields has
other costs as well. The smaller ag
ricultural growers can't afford the

thousands of dollars it takes to
mechanize. In 1964, when the to
mato harvester was first introduced,
there were over 4000 independent
tomato growers in California; in 1972
there were fewer than 600 such
growers.
Prices rise
Nor does mechanized harvesting
promise lower prices for the con
sumer, the supposed beneficiary of
such "progress." Since 1964 the
price of a can of tomatoes has risen
111 per cent, while the price of all
foods rose only 90 per cent. And
since most fruits and vegetables are
too fragile to be harvested by
machines, the UC system is develop
ing tougher, harder, and more taste
less crops. As one state senator puts
it, we now have tomatoes that "taste
like rubber."
There may be one other cost as
well, that may not show up for years
to come. One kind of lettuce harves
ter that has been developed uses
radiation to determine the density,
and hence the ripeness, of heads of
lettuce growing in the fields. Will the
radiation affect the handful of work
ers it takes to run the machine? Will it
affect the consumer who finally gets
the lettuce? No one seems to know.
Anti-union strategy
Just as disturbing is the blatant
anti-union strategy underlying de
velopment of these monstruos. In
the words of the UC professor who
designed the lettuce harvester, "The
machine won't strike; it will work
when they" — the growers — "want
it to." In large part increased
mechanization in the fields can be
seen as a reaction to attempts by the
United Farm Workers Union over the
last 12 years to organize workers and
provide decent wages and living
standards.
After the lettuce strike began in the
Salinas Valley in 1970, a group of
growers gave the University of
California $13,500 to develop a let
tuce harvester. In 1973, there was a
melon strike near Fresno. Into the
melon fields came a melon harvester
recently developed at UC-Davis; the
machine was supposedly there as a
scientific test of its capabilities.
The Dean of Agriculture at Davis
admitted that even though the Uni
versity wasn't "designing the
machines to be strikebreakers," he
knew that was why the growers were
buying them.
It is not surprising, though still
dismaying, that the UC system is

cooperating with the growers in this
fashion, spending taxpayers' money
in the process. Several of the UC Re
gents have direct ties to major ag
ribusiness companies. One Regent is
on the Board of Directors of Del
Monte. Another's law firm repre
sents the Irvine Company, a large ag
ribusiness concern.
But UC has done more than de
velop harvesting machines. Shortly
after the passage of the 1975 Farm
Labor Law that provided for elections
in the fields, UC's Division of Ag
ricultural Sciences produced a pam
phlet aimed at helping the growers
fight the UFW. The pamphlet discus
sed such questions as "Stopping the
union is a big job. How could we go
about it?" and "Maybe I should just
mechanize and forget labor prob
lems?" The pamphlet included a
note that it was meant for growers
who hadn't attended the Division's
classes on the new law.
In 1977 UC Extension offered a
class to growers on the legal aspects
of the union elections. As the Wood
land Daily Democrat of March 31,
1977 reported, "A group of California
growers . . . got a lesson in combat
ting unions at UC-Davis Extension."
Mechanization inevitable
The UFW recognizes that
mechanization is inevitable; it is not
demanding that all mechanization be
halted. Rather it is asking that social
impact studies be conducted prior to
continued mechanization research,
and that California institute a plan to
compensate, retrain, and reemploy
farm workers displaced by the
machines.
These would seem to be reasona
ble demands in light of the many
problems that mechanization
threatens both for farm workers and
for the public. But modern progress
has often claimed its victims before,
and may well do so again this time.
The growers and their friends in
the University of California and the
State Assembly are powerful figures;
having tried to destroy the UFW in
the past, they are not about to stop
their efforts now.
But with public support the UFW
has triumphed in ways never
dreamed possible. Now the enemy is
los monstruos, and a new kind of
struggle is underway. The UFW and
its supporters throughout the coun
try are not about to let these
machines negate the hard-fought
successes of the past dozen years.

velop harvesting machines. Shortly
after the passage of the 1975 Farm
Labor Law that provided for elections
in the fields, UC's Division of Ag
ricultural Sciences produced a pam
phlet aimed at helping the growers
fight the UFW. The pamphlet discus
sed such questions as "Stopping the
union is a big job. How could we go
about it?" and "Maybe I should just
mechanize and forget labor prob
lems?" The pamphlet included a
note that it was meant for growers
who hadn't attended the Division's
classes on the new law.
In 1977 UC Extension offered a
class to growers on the legal aspects
of the union elections. As the Wood
land Daily Democrat of March 31,
1977 reported, "A group of California
growers . . . got a lesson in combat
ting unions at UC-Davis Extension."
Mechanization inevitable
The UFW recognizes that
mechanization is inevitable; it is not
demanding that all mechanization be
halted. Rather it is asking that social
impact studies be conducted prior to
continued mechanization research,
and that California institute a plan to
compensate, retrain, and reemploy
farm workers displaced by the
machines.
These would seem to be reasona
ble demands in light of the many
problems that mechanization
threatens both for farm workers and
for the public. But modern progress
has often claimed its victims before,
and may well do so again this time.
The growers and their friends in
the University of California and the
State Assembly are powerful figures;
having tried to destroy the UFW in
the past, they are not about to stop
their efforts now.
But with public support the UFW
has triumphed in ways never
dreamed possible. Now the enemy is
los monstruos, and a new kind of
struggle is underway. The UFW and
its supporters throughout the coun
try are not about to let these
machines negate the hard-fought
successes of the past dozen years.

The farm workers call them los
monstruos — the monsters. It is not
vampires or werewolves that the
workers look upon with such alarm,
but rather harvesting machines
being developed by the University of
California.
Used to gather such crops as to
matoes, lettuce and grapes, these
machines threaten to throw over
120,000 farm workers out of work
over the next 10 years, adding 1.2 per
cent to the state's unemployment
rate. Last summer alone the
electronic-eye tomato sorter dis
placed over 7500 workers. As a result
of such "progress," farm workers
will be forced onto the unemploy
ment lines and welfare rolls, costing
over $2 billion in lost revenues on the
one hand and increased government
services on the other.
Mechanization in the fields has
other costs as well. The smaller ag
ricultural growers can't afford the

thousands of dollars it takes to
mechanize. In 1964, when the to
mato harvester was first introduced,
there were over 4000 independent
tomato growers in California; in 1972
there were fewer than 600 such
growers.
Prices rise
Nor does mechanized harvesting
promise lower prices for the con
sumer, the supposed beneficiary of
such "progress." Since 1964 the
price of a can of tomatoes has risen
111 per cent, while the price of all
foods rose only 90 per cent. And
since most fruits and vegetables are
too fragile to be harvested by
machines, the UC system is develop
ing tougher, harder, and more taste
less crops. As one state senator puts
it, we now have tomatoes that "taste
like rubber."
There may be one other cost as
well, that may not show up for years
to come. One kind of lettuce harves
ter that has been developed uses
radiation to determine the density,
and hence the ripeness, of heads of
lettuce growing in the fields. Will the
radiation affect the handful of work
ers it takes to run the machine? Will it
affect the consumer who finally gets
the lettuce? No one seems to know.
Anti-union strategy
Just as disturbing is the blatant
anti-union strategy underlying de
velopment of these monstruos. In
the words of the UC professor who
designed the lettuce harvester, "The
machine won't strike; it will work
when they" — the growers — "want
it to." In large part increased
mechanization in the fields can be
seen as a reaction to attempts by the
United Farm Workers Union over the
last 12 years to organize workers and
provide decent wages and living
standards.
After the lettuce strike began in the
Salinas Valley in 1970, a group of
growers gave the University of
California $13,500 to develop a let
tuce harvester. In 1973, there was a
melon strike near Fresno. Into the
melon fields came a melon harvester
recently developed at UC-Davis; the
machine was supposedly there as a
scientific test of its capabilities.
The Dean of Agriculture at Davis
admitted that even though the Uni
versity wasn't "designing the
machines to be strikebreakers," he
knew that was why the growers were
buying them.
It is not surprising, though still
dismaying, that the UC system is

cooperating with the growers in this
fashion, spending taxpayers' money
in the process. Several of the UC Re
gents have direct ties to major ag
ribusiness companies. One Regent is
on the Board of Directors of Del
Monte. Another's law firm repre
sents the Irvine Company, a large ag
ribusiness concern.
