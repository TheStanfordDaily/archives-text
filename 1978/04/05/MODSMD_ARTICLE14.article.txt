# 32 Congressmen receive disability, military checks
## 
### 
Washir ton (AP) — The fed
eral government says 18 mem
bers of Congress are disabled
and it sends them checks every
month to compensate for their
disabilities.
At least another 14 senators
and congressmen get a
monthly military pension
check or Veterans Administra
tion payment in addition to
their $57,000-a-year salary,
their travel allowances and
other benefits.
Recipients of the extra
checks include such well
known and powerful members
as Sens. John Glenn, Strom
Thurmond and Robert Dole
and Reps. Olin Teague, John
Flynt, John Young and Al
Ullman.
The extra checks range from
$41 a month to $1109 a month.
And the payments are quite
legal.
"When people ask if it is
right that I get it, I say, 'Under
present circumstances, clearly
yes,' " says Rep. James Lloyd
(D-Calif.), who draws $618 a
month in military pension for
his 21 years in the Navy. "But is
it morally right? No. We need
to make a change in the sys
tem."
The second checks have
been severely criticized by
those who say Congress
should change federal retire
ment systems to limit or elimi
nate the second checks.
"It's high time we got Con
gress off the Pentagon
payroll," said Sid Taylor, the
research director of the Na
tional Taxpayers Union, a gras
sroots lobbying group. "We
have too many senator
generals, senator-colonels and
congressman-colonels in to
day's U.S. Congress."
Four members of Congress
receive military disability pen
sions, which are based on
rank, pay at time of retirement
and percentage of disability.

Fourteen others receive Vete
rans Administration pensions,
which are based on the percen
tage of service-connected dis
ability. And 13 others receive
non-disability related military
pensions.
Four of the congressmen do
not keep their checks. Two
send the checks back to the
government, one turns his
over to charity, and one says he
is putting his into a charitable
fund he is setting up.
The biggest two-check in
come goes to Sen. Howard
Cannon, who gets $1072-a
-month in regular military pen
sion plus his congressional sal
ary, making the Nevada Demo
crat's annual income from the
government $70,369. Cannon
was a major general in the Air
Force reserve.
"He feels that he earned his
pension regardless of how
much he makes, that what you
do for a living should not affect
your pension," said Cannon
press aide Mike Vernetti.
The largest second check
goes to Rep. Charles Bennett
(D-Fla.), who receives $1109 a
month from the Veterans Ad
ministration. However, Ben
nett, who contracted polio
while fighting in the Phillipines
and now walks with abraceand
a cane, returns the money to
the government.
Rep. William Nichols (D-
Ala.), gets a monthly VA pen

sion of $983. He stepped on a
hnd mine in Europe during
World War 11, costing him the
lower part of his left leg, half a
lung and paralyzing his right
foot.
Teague, a Texas Democrat,
gets $951 a month in military
disability pension for the war
wound which eventually cost
him his leg.
Dole, the Kansas Republican
who was Gerald Ford's running
mate in 1976, gets $704 a
month, or $8458 a year. He was
critically wounded by a shell
fragment in Italy. His right
hand and arm are still crippled
and he has no feeling in his left
hand.
Also drawing $8458 annually
in military disability pension is
Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii),
who lost his right arm when he
fought as a major in the Nisei
442 nd Regimental Combat
Team in Italy.
Ullman, who heads the
House Ways and Means Com
mittee, gets $506 a month in
regular military pension. An
Ullman spokesman said the
Oregon Democrat opposes the
current two-check situation
and would support a change.
Flynt, the Georgia Democrat
who heads the House Ethics
Committee, receives $669 a
month from his regular military
pension. Young (D-Texas) gets
$599 a month in military disabil
ity pension.

month from his regular military
pension. Young (D-Texas) gets
$599 a month in military disabil
ity pension.
Washir ton (AP) — The fed
eral government says 18 mem
bers of Congress are disabled
and it sends them checks every
month to compensate for their
disabilities.
At least another 14 senators
and congressmen get a
monthly military pension
check or Veterans Administra
tion payment in addition to
their $57,000-a-year salary,
their travel allowances and
other benefits.
Recipients of the extra
checks include such well
known and powerful members
as Sens. John Glenn, Strom
Thurmond and Robert Dole
and Reps. Olin Teague, John
Flynt, John Young and Al
Ullman.
The extra checks range from
$41 a month to $1109 a month.
And the payments are quite
legal.
"When people ask if it is
right that I get it, I say, 'Under
present circumstances, clearly
yes,' " says Rep. James Lloyd
(D-Calif.), who draws $618 a
month in military pension for
his 21 years in the Navy. "But is
it morally right? No. We need
to make a change in the sys
tem."
The second checks have
been severely criticized by
those who say Congress
should change federal retire
ment systems to limit or elimi
nate the second checks.
"It's high time we got Con
gress off the Pentagon
payroll," said Sid Taylor, the
research director of the Na
tional Taxpayers Union, a gras
sroots lobbying group. "We
have too many senator
generals, senator-colonels and
congressman-colonels in to
day's U.S. Congress."
Four members of Congress
receive military disability pen
sions, which are based on
rank, pay at time of retirement
and percentage of disability.

Fourteen others receive Vete
rans Administration pensions,
which are based on the percen
tage of service-connected dis
ability. And 13 others receive
non-disability related military
pensions.
Four of the congressmen do
not keep their checks. Two
send the checks back to the
government, one turns his
over to charity, and one says he
is putting his into a charitable
fund he is setting up.
The biggest two-check in
come goes to Sen. Howard
Cannon, who gets $1072-a
-month in regular military pen
sion plus his congressional sal
ary, making the Nevada Demo
crat's annual income from the
government $70,369. Cannon
was a major general in the Air
Force reserve.
"He feels that he earned his
pension regardless of how
much he makes, that what you
do for a living should not affect
your pension," said Cannon
press aide Mike Vernetti.
The largest second check
goes to Rep. Charles Bennett
(D-Fla.), who receives $1109 a
month from the Veterans Ad
ministration. However, Ben
nett, who contracted polio
while fighting in the Phillipines
and now walks with abraceand
a cane, returns the money to
the government.
Rep. William Nichols (D-
Ala.), gets a monthly VA pen

sion of $983. He stepped on a
hnd mine in Europe during
World War 11, costing him the
lower part of his left leg, half a
lung and paralyzing his right
foot.
Teague, a Texas Democrat,
gets $951 a month in military
disability pension for the war
wound which eventually cost
him his leg.
Dole, the Kansas Republican
who was Gerald Ford's running
mate in 1976, gets $704 a
month, or $8458 a year. He was
critically wounded by a shell
fragment in Italy. His right
hand and arm are still crippled
and he has no feeling in his left
hand.
Also drawing $8458 annually
in military disability pension is
Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii),
who lost his right arm when he
fought as a major in the Nisei
442 nd Regimental Combat
Team in Italy.
Ullman, who heads the
House Ways and Means Com
mittee, gets $506 a month in
regular military pension. An
Ullman spokesman said the
Oregon Democrat opposes the
current two-check situation
and would support a change.
Flynt, the Georgia Democrat
who heads the House Ethics
Committee, receives $669 a
month from his regular military
pension. Young (D-Texas) gets
$599 a month in military disabil
ity pension.
