# College costs to rise 6 per cent
## 
### 
New York (AP) — It will cost an aver
age of 6 per cent more to go to college
next year than it does this year, says a
new study which shows that a resident
student at a private, four-year college
will spend more than $5000 in the
academic year starting in September.
That $5000 is equivalent to about
one-third the median family income in
the United States. And it means that
even if there is no further inflation —
and that is not likely — a freshman who
enters a private school this fall and lives
on campus will have to pay more than
$20,000 for a college education.
The study, released yesterday, was
conducted by the College Scholarship
Service of the College Board, a non
profit organization of schools, educa
tional associations and scholarship
agencies. The findings were based on
reports from 2693 colleges and univer

sities.
Costs vary according to the type of
institution involved and such factors as
whether a student commutes or lives
on campus.
The board study showed, for exam
ple, that 1978-79 school expenses for a
commuting student at a public, four
year college will total $2604, up 4.8 per
cent from this year. A student at the
same school who lives on campus will
spend $3054, up 5.3 per cent from this
year.
Other findings of the study include:
—Expenses at private, four-year col
leges will average $5110 for on-campus
students, up 6.1 per cent from this year,
and $4577 for commuters, up 5.7 per
cent.
—There will be $12.3 billion in public
and private financial aid for students
during the coming academic year. That

does not count possible benefits from
congressional and administration
proposals to help middle-income
families burdened by high education
bills.
—Tuition and fees are the items
which vary most from school to school.
At private, four-year colleges, tuition
and fees will average $2647 next year; at
public, four-year schools, the average
is $651 although costs can increase
sharply for out-of-state students.
—Dollar amounts for items other
than tuition and fees are fairly similar
from one college to another. As an av
erage, the College Board says students
should plan on $245 for transportation,
$210 for books and supplies, $470 for
personal expei.»es and either $890 or
$1440 for room and board, depending
on whether they live home or on cam
pus.
