## Parachuting gains popularity here

As you step out of the
cockpit onto the wing strut, a
90 mph wind hits you in the
face. You cling to the strut and
it is all you can do to keep from
being torn away.
Then you feel the jumpmas
ter's hand tap your shoulder
and you know that this means
you have to let go now or you
will miss your target. You re
lease your grip, push off to the
right, and suddenly fall to
wards the ground at 120 mph,
or 60 yards per second.
After a few seconds, you feel
yourself being yanked from
above. Your eyes look up 28
feet to see a big open canopy
and your next breath seems
strangely loud compared to the
stillness around you.
"You will be jumping from
3000 feet today. But before you
do that, you'll go through in
tensive training. By the end of
the day, you may have a
headache. If so, we have aspi
rin," skydiving instructor Larry
Arcadi said in a matter-of-fact
tone to his class of 20 students.
Lessons popular
Recently, skydiving lessons
at the Stevens School of Sport
Parachuting in Antioch have
become popular among Stan
ford students.
According to Perry Stevens,
owner of the school, most
people take the beginning les
son with the intention of jump

ing only once. Few people
realize, however, that the les
son, which begins at 8:30 a.m.
lasts until about five in the af
ternoon.
"People come into the class
without one single serious
thought. Their attitude is much
too light," Stevens said.
The entire day is spent learn
ing how to fall, how to land,
and what to do if there is a mal
function.
Great pressure
"They drill things into you so
that you don't panic under
pressure. Skydiving has an in
credible amount of pressure,"
said freshman Bob Sick.
"A lot of people just won't
have their minds when they
jump — they'll leave them in
the plane. Your reactions to a
malfunction have to be au
tomatic," Sick said.
According to students, the
part of the course where they
start to lose their strong desire
to skydive is where they learn
the various parachute malfunc
tions. The chances of one oc
curring are slim, yet the school
tries to prepare a student to
deal with the worst malfunc
tion situations.
"In the beginning of the
class, it's a game for some
people, but when it starts get
ting serious, that's when we
see funny looks," Stevens said.
"They didn't hesitate to tell
you that if you fell o.i your head

you'd break your neck," said
senior Hugh Kuhn.
"If something does go
wrong, it's basically your own
fault. That's one of the main
things they make you realize so
that you do take the course
seriously," said senior Brent
Smith.
Sometimes when a student is
not catching on, the instruc
tors' assuring manner helps
make that student feel more at
ease.
"Atsome point in the day, I'll
single the student out and talk
to him. I'll find out where the
problem is and I'll try to find a
way to make things easier.
Sometimes it may be just a
mental block," Arcadi said.
Drill sergeant
"My instructor, Larry (Ar
cadi), was a great guy, but
when he was teaching, he was
like a drill sergeant and you felt
like he knew what he was talk
ing about," Sick said.
With Arcadi as his jumpmas
ter in the plane, Sick recalled
that as he was ready to finally
make his first jump, Arcadi
"made me feel at ease."
The cost of the all-day lesson
and the skydive for Stanford
groups is $45 per person.
"I definitely think it was
worth it, because I thought the
training that they gave me was
excellent," said Kuhn. He

added that the cost includes
paying for a person licensed by
the Federal Aviation Administ
ration to pack your parachute,
the jumpmaster, the pilot, and
the instructors.
Despite the expensive fee,
the pre-jump training, and the
pre-jump panic, many students
here describe skydiving as a
thrill that they would do again.
"Though it's one of the
scariest things you can do,
people are going to do it any
way, even if it is only a three
minute pleasure," said Loen
Kelley, a Wilbur freshman who
organizes student groups wish
ing to take skydiving lessons.
Kuhn said, "The worst part
was the two seconds of fear
when they opened the plane's
door and I saw 3000 feet of air."
Spectacular view
He agreed with Kelley that
despite this feeling of fear, it
was worth it. Kuhn described
the spectacular view he had a
rare opportunity to see as he
was floating down.
"The sun was setting, I could
see the silhouette of Mount
Diablo, there was a rainbow
behind me and a storm on the
horizon in front of me."
Stevens tells his students
that besides experiencing this
serentiy of floating to earth,"
parachuting is the second thrill
of your life." The first biggest
thrill he leaves to a person's
imagination.

Kelley, a Wilbur freshman who
organizes student groups wish
ing to take skydiving lessons.
Kuhn said, "The worst part
was the two seconds of fear
when they opened the plane's
door and I saw 3000 feet of air."
Spectacular view
He agreed with Kelley that
despite this feeling of fear, it
was worth it. Kuhn described
the spectacular view he had a
rare opportunity to see as he
was floating down.
"The sun was setting, I could
see the silhouette of Mount
Diablo, there was a rainbow
behind me and a storm on the
horizon in front of me."
Stevens tells his students
that besides experiencing this
serentiy of floating to earth,"
parachuting is the second thrill
of your life." The first biggest
thrill he leaves to a person's
imagination.
As you step out of the
cockpit onto the wing strut, a
90 mph wind hits you in the
face. You cling to the strut and
it is all you can do to keep from
being torn away.
Then you feel the jumpmas
ter's hand tap your shoulder
and you know that this means
you have to let go now or you
will miss your target. You re
lease your grip, push off to the
right, and suddenly fall to
wards the ground at 120 mph,
or 60 yards per second.
After a few seconds, you feel
yourself being yanked from
above. Your eyes look up 28
feet to see a big open canopy
and your next breath seems
strangely loud compared to the
stillness around you.
"You will be jumping from
3000 feet today. But before you
do that, you'll go through in
tensive training. By the end of
the day, you may have a
headache. If so, we have aspi
rin," skydiving instructor Larry
Arcadi said in a matter-of-fact
tone to his class of 20 students.
Lessons popular
Recently, skydiving lessons
at the Stevens School of Sport
Parachuting in Antioch have
become popular among Stan
ford students.
According to Perry Stevens,
owner of the school, most
people take the beginning les
son with the intention of jump

ing only once. Few people
realize, however, that the les
son, which begins at 8:30 a.m.
lasts until about five in the af
ternoon.
"People come into the class
without one single serious
thought. Their attitude is much
too light," Stevens said.
The entire day is spent learn
ing how to fall, how to land,
and what to do if there is a mal
function.
Great pressure
"They drill things into you so
that you don't panic under
pressure. Skydiving has an in
credible amount of pressure,"
said freshman Bob Sick.
"A lot of people just won't
have their minds when they
jump — they'll leave them in
the plane. Your reactions to a
malfunction have to be au
tomatic," Sick said.
According to students, the
part of the course where they
start to lose their strong desire
to skydive is where they learn
the various parachute malfunc
tions. The chances of one oc
curring are slim, yet the school
tries to prepare a student to
deal with the worst malfunc
tion situations.
"In the beginning of the
class, it's a game for some
people, but when it starts get
ting serious, that's when we
see funny looks," Stevens said.
"They didn't hesitate to tell
you that if you fell o.i your head

you'd break your neck," said
senior Hugh Kuhn.
"If something does go
wrong, it's basically your own
fault. That's one of the main
things they make you realize so
that you do take the course
seriously," said senior Brent
Smith.
Sometimes when a student is
not catching on, the instruc
tors' assuring manner helps
make that student feel more at
ease.
"Atsome point in the day, I'll
single the student out and talk
to him. I'll find out where the
problem is and I'll try to find a
way to make things easier.
Sometimes it may be just a
mental block," Arcadi said.
Drill sergeant
"My instructor, Larry (Ar
cadi), was a great guy, but
when he was teaching, he was
like a drill sergeant and you felt
like he knew what he was talk
ing about," Sick said.
With Arcadi as his jumpmas
ter in the plane, Sick recalled
that as he was ready to finally
make his first jump, Arcadi
"made me feel at ease."
The cost of the all-day lesson
and the skydive for Stanford
groups is $45 per person.
"I definitely think it was
worth it, because I thought the
training that they gave me was
excellent," said Kuhn. He

added that the cost includes
paying for a person licensed by
the Federal Aviation Administ
ration to pack your parachute,
the jumpmaster, the pilot, and
the instructors.
Despite the expensive fee,
the pre-jump training, and the
pre-jump panic, many students
here describe skydiving as a
thrill that they would do again.
"Though it's one of the
scariest things you can do,
people are going to do it any
way, even if it is only a three
minute pleasure," said Loen
Kelley, a Wilbur freshman who
organizes student groups wish
ing to take skydiving lessons.
