memorated the 10th anniversary of the assassination
of black rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. by hold
ing a rally in White Plaza.
The commemorative service began at noon with
taped excerpts from King's speeches. Within mi-
racially-mixed audience of 200 had gathered.
Rally participants sang the black national anthem,
"Lift Every Voice and Sing," and listened to a short
biography of King, which told how he came to believe
in and practice his policies of non-violence and non
aggression.
"America is only a dream," King once said. "The
Negro is still trampled on by the iron feet of oppres
sion. This is scarring the American Dream. Let us not
try and satisfy our thirsts by drinking from the cup of
bitterness and hatred."
The biography detailed King's life until 1968, when
he was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn.

ney lohnson gave a short speech on King's societal
impact, stressing the changes brought by King and
the protests of the 19605.
"Dr. King has had a significant impact on our soci
ety and the world as a whole," )ohnson said. "Were it
not for Martin Luther King and the protests of the
'60s, I have no guarantee that I would be here at
Stanford, at a university. The term 'black college stu
dent' used to be a contradiction in terms. These
places were once reserved for whites only."
lohnson also touched on coniemporary minority
issues, denouncing the Bakke decision, and calling
the concept of reverse-discrimination "contrived"
and non-existent.
The rally ended with the announcement of a two
