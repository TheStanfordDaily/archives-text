# Student groups hope to ignite political climate
## 
### Caryn Coulter 
A forecast on intensity of
political activity this spring
shows highs and lows over the
nation, but political activity
here is expected to be low
compared to recent years.
A quick glimpse at the Uni
versity weather vane shows
temperate breezes blowing in
the direction of Sacramento
gubernatorial races, scattered
heat waves centered in the
White Plaza region and alluring
solar rays along the tropical
shores of Lake Lagunita.
This spring, Columbae
House and Ola Union appear
to be hot bed areas of the Uni
versity volcano, but the likeli
hood of eruption appears slim.
After sizzling '60s and
scorching early 70s, the politi
cal forecast for spring quarter
here looks relatively mild. A
pre-spring survey of leading
political indicators points to
lukewarm activity, centered
around state and national
primary elections, human
rights and the quest for politi
cal alternatives.
No sexy issues
"It's a shame there won't be
any real sexy issues on the bal
lot this spring," said Jon Schec
ter, a co-leader of spring
SWOPSI Course 196 entitled
"California Politics: Campaign
Tactics and Strategies," who
considers himself "a
political."
"I mean — what student at
this university really cares
about property taxes?" Schec
ter asked, referring to Califor
nia's Jarvis-Gann debate.
Still, the spring climate
promises to raise the level of
campus political awareness
with a helping hand from
specially-designed courses
and campus organizations. For
example, in addition to the
campaigning course, which
"emphasizes electoral politics
as a means of social change,"
SWOPSI offers three other
courses in community organiz
ing for spring quarter,
explained Chris Coleman,
SWOPSI course coordinator.
The other courses — Non
violent Resistance, Anarchist
Organizing, and Social Change
and Personal Lifestyle — will be
geared toward political change

and alternatives, with special
emphasis on actual practice:
workshops, journals, new lec
ture series and examination of
existing organizing efforts,
Coleman said.
Alternatives
Brad Krevoy, the other
leader of the Campaign Tactics
class, said SWOPSI provides
needed alternatives to the
existing academic political of
ferings.
"If our course had anything
to do with political science cur
riculum," he said, "it couldn't
be offered as a SWOPSI
course."
SWOPSI is not the only body
readying itself for spring.
Members of many other stu
dent organs hoping to ignite
Stanford's political climate
agree the campus is ready for a
new spring political wave.
Political preferences
One way to forecast the
political climate here is to sur
vey political preferences, Ac
cording to comments by lead
ers of some of Stanford's more
politically oriented groups, the
temperature varies depending
on the organization.
For example, the Conserva
tive Students Union (CSU) sees
itself at 45 degrees on a ther
mometer where 100 degrees is
most liberal. The Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), on the
other hand, puts itself at 90 de
grees.
Nearer to the radical end of
the political thermometer is
New Directions, Stanford's
new "internationalist" organi
zation which is designed to
educate students on domestic
and foreign policy. Cedric
Smith, steering committee
member and publicity chair
man, would put New Direc
tions at 70 degrees. He would
place the average Stanford
student at 50.
"Most of the time we are
supporting liberal causes,"
Smith said, "but political iden
tity really doesn't come up with
us — we're just trying to get the
facts out."
Libertarians
Michael Roberts, head of the
Young Libertarian Alliance,
with a perpetually updated list
of about 200 members, said his
group measures the climate of

political preference in a diffe
rent way.
"Libertarians are essentially
non-political people," he said.
"We tend to take a look at
modern politics, see that it's a
crock, and run for the hills."
Roberts said if one were to
grossly generalize by dividing
the political spectrum into two
sides — one the "economic"
outlook of the conservatives
and the other the "civil liber
ties" perspective of liberal,
communist and socialist
groups — libertarians would
straddle the fence.
"All the libertarians do is
recognize both kinds," he
said. "We just say, 'Hey gang!
It's all liberties, it's all human
rights, it's all the same thing.' "
Other measures of the local
political climate relate to the
general observations of non
partisan groups.
ASSU Senate
If one were to use the ASSU
Senate as an indicator, this
year's temperature would be
especially toasty. With a 12-
senator majority of Stanford
Organizing Committee (SOC)
members, the radical/
progressive contingent out
numbers the liberal/
moderate/conservative wing
by a margin of two to one.
Several senators recently
told a Stanford Daily reporter
that the ASSU is not an accurate
reflection of the political prop
ortions of Stanford students
and that more radical/
progressive opinions are rep
resented in the ASSU Senate
than exist proportionally in the
student body.
The CSU Arena recently re
ported that "the Senate's legis
lative record has, thankfully,
been relatively harmless."
Political candidate
Rick Weber, Stanford
Democrat and co-chairman of
the Stanford Committee on
Political Education (SCOPE),
has another method of gauging
the student body's political
stance. He describes the aver
age Stanford student accord
ing to his choice of political
candidate. This is because, he
said, "most students do not
wear their politics on their
sleeve."
"A good indicator of the

Stanford temperature might be
Congressman Pete McClos
key," he said. "For most Stan
ford Democrats and Republi
cans, David Harris was just a bit
too liberal. When I have talked
to Stanford students, in gen
eral I have been surprised at
their political conservatism."
Another clue to the student
body's political leaning might
be its overall voter registration.
Out of the 5355 Stanford voters
registered with Santa Clara
County, 61 per cent are Demo
crat and 25 per cent Republi
can, according to the county
registrar of voters.
Decline to state
A full 13 per cent are "D.S."
voters, meaning they "decline
to state" their political prefer
ence, and the remaining 1
per cent is registered American
Independent, Peace and Free
dom or "miscellaneous." Stan
ford's proportion of D.S. vot
ers is a significant 5 per cent
higher than the country aver
age, and its 8 per cent in
the American Independent
category is lower.
It is important to remember
the limitations of each type of
thermometer. Political perter
ence statistics alone are not
necessarily accurate indicators
of political "sizzle" on campus,
nor can they serve to forecast
the overall temperature for
spring.
The general consensus on
student awareness among stu
dent group leaders points to a
significant need for en
lightenment. For one reason or
another, most students lack
both the skills and the aware
ness to make the outside polit
ical system work for them.
Educational objectives
"We're working on the pre
mise that the public is una
ware," Smith said of New Di
rections, "so the objectives of

our activities are basically edu
cational."
"I wouldn't say that it was so
much apathy any more, I
would say it's just that people
are unaware of their involve
ment in international issues,"
he continued. "I think the
reason people don't know is
because they think it's too
complex — too abstract.
"There is not really any
clear-cut threat like a com
munist monolith or capitalist
conspiracy to make things
simpler for people," he said.
Little interest
Another reason for little
political awareness may be lit
tle political interest, suggested
ARC member Rick Levy. The
ARC is helping sponsor Dis
orientation Week, scheduled
for April 15 though 23. The
week will propose all kinds of
alternatives to students' politi
cal leanings, "so people can ac
tually think about what they're
doing instead of being chan
nelled automatically by Stan
ford into the so-called Real
World," Levy said.
"I can't imagine people get
ting too excited over the gov
ernorship campaign because
of the limited range of
choices," he said. "You can
only work really hard on the
things you believe in."
Time and priorities
Roger Greene, president of
the CSU, said he thinks ac
tivism is a function of available
time and priorities. "For the
most part, people get so wrap
ped up in what they're doing
here they don't really know
what's going on outside," he
said.
Other groups may be
ideologically disenchanted
with the political scene, said
Roberts of the Young Liberta
rians.
"Politics has earned its dirty

hands over the years," Roberts
said. "Those aspects of it which
are not clean, we stay away
from. For example, we're out
for minimizing government
participation to a great extent,
so what do we do about cam
paign contributions?" he
asked. "We don't accept fed
eral funds at all. And that kind
of ties our hands."
Roberts said he is not sure
how most students here re
spond to libertarianism be
cause of his time limitations. "I
haven't had the time to get the
ball rolling," he complained.
"There has not been enough
input from me to gauge how
the Stanford student body as a
whole reacts to liber
tarianism."
The question arises, is there
a need for political sympathy?
Do Stanford students require
political organizing skills and
active experience?
"Obviously," is Cheverton's
answer. He also said he is en
couraging many College Re
publicans to take advantage of
the SWOPSI course offered by
Krevoy and Schecter.
Krevoy, who sees his course
as a "catch-all for everyone
from novices to political vete
rans," said he finds it "person
ally distasteful that student
campaigners are reduced to
envelope-stuffing type ac
tivities" in political campaigns.
He said political awareness is
an asset in today's world, for
other reasons as well.
"You can't live without the
government. It's a monster
that's here to stay. . . . There's
no place you can hide from gov
ernment, whether you're talk
ing about parking tickets,
marijuana, or buying alcoholic
beverages in Palo Alto," he
said.
Schecter agrees. "The gov
ernments so damn pervasive,"

he said. "People in college are
so 'now' oriented that they
don't worry about things like
the Panama Canal, the Jarvis-
Gann initiative, the falling dol
lar because they won't feel the
impact.
All affected
"As much as government
doesn't affect us directly, al
most everybody is going to be
affected in some way," he ad
ded.
"The odds are good that
someday a large number of
people at this university are
going to take an active part in
the political system, other than
voting," he said.
Schecter, a veteran of the
Bob Finch campaign for U.S.
Senate in 1976 said, "This class
isn't going to be an equivalent
to taking a year off and working
full-time on a political cam
paign."
"But it's possibly the next
best thing," said Krevoy, also a
veteran campaign worker.
Speakers
The University can look for
ward to more than just
academics in the spring politi
cal scene. SCOPE promises an
energy program with Sen.
Lowell P. Weicker (R-Conn.),
and possible speaking appear
ances by Republican guber
natorial candidates and in
cumbent Jerry Brown.
Other possible speakers in
clude Theodore Sorenson, Ar
thur Schlesinger and "leading
officials from Carter's ad
ministration who are in
terested in speaking to West
Coast audiences," Weber said.
Political consultants Maxwell
Arnold and Bill Roberts, former
White House aide Robert Finch
and State Democratic Chair
man Burt Coffey are confirmed
to speak at the Krevoy and
Schecter workshop.

lative record has, thankfully,
been relatively harmless."
Political candidate
Rick Weber, Stanford
Democrat and co-chairman of
the Stanford Committee on
Political Education (SCOPE),
has another method of gauging
the student body's political
stance. He describes the aver
age Stanford student accord
ing to his choice of political
candidate. This is because, he
said, "most students do not
wear their politics on their
sleeve."
"A good indicator of the

Stanford temperature might be
Congressman Pete McClos
key," he said. "For most Stan
ford Democrats and Republi
cans, David Harris was just a bit
too liberal. When I have talked
to Stanford students, in gen
eral I have been surprised at
their political conservatism."
Another clue to the student
body's political leaning might
be its overall voter registration.
Out of the 5355 Stanford voters
registered with Santa Clara
County, 61 per cent are Demo
crat and 25 per cent Republi
can, according to the county
registrar of voters.
Decline to state
A full 13 per cent are "D.S."
voters, meaning they "decline
to state" their political prefer
ence, and the remaining 1
per cent is registered American
Independent, Peace and Free
dom or "miscellaneous." Stan
ford's proportion of D.S. vot
ers is a significant 5 per cent
higher than the country aver
age, and its 8 per cent in
the American Independent
category is lower.
It is important to remember
the limitations of each type of
thermometer. Political perter
ence statistics alone are not
necessarily accurate indicators
of political "sizzle" on campus,
nor can they serve to forecast
the overall temperature for
spring.
The general consensus on
student awareness among stu
dent group leaders points to a
significant need for en
lightenment. For one reason or
another, most students lack
both the skills and the aware
ness to make the outside polit
ical system work for them.
Educational objectives
"We're working on the pre
mise that the public is una
ware," Smith said of New Di
rections, "so the objectives of

our activities are basically edu
cational."
"I wouldn't say that it was so
much apathy any more, I
would say it's just that people
are unaware of their involve
ment in international issues,"
he continued. "I think the
reason people don't know is
because they think it's too
complex — too abstract.
"There is not really any
clear-cut threat like a com
munist monolith or capitalist
conspiracy to make things
simpler for people," he said.
Little interest
Another reason for little
political awareness may be lit
tle political interest, suggested
ARC member Rick Levy. The
ARC is helping sponsor Dis
orientation Week, scheduled
for April 15 though 23. The
week will propose all kinds of
alternatives to students' politi
cal leanings, "so people can ac
tually think about what they're
doing instead of being chan
nelled automatically by Stan
ford into the so-called Real
World," Levy said.
"I can't imagine people get
ting too excited over the gov
ernorship campaign because
of the limited range of
choices," he said. "You can
only work really hard on the
things you believe in."
Time and priorities
Roger Greene, president of
the CSU, said he thinks ac
tivism is a function of available
time and priorities. "For the
most part, people get so wrap
ped up in what they're doing
here they don't really know
what's going on outside," he
said.
Other groups may be
ideologically disenchanted
with the political scene, said
Roberts of the Young Liberta
rians.
"Politics has earned its dirty

hands over the years," Roberts
said. "Those aspects of it which
are not clean, we stay away
from. For example, we're out
for minimizing government
participation to a great extent,
so what do we do about cam
paign contributions?" he
asked. "We don't accept fed
eral funds at all. And that kind
of ties our hands."
Roberts said he is not sure
how most students here re
spond to libertarianism be
cause of his time limitations. "I
haven't had the time to get the
ball rolling," he complained.
"There has not been enough
input from me to gauge how
the Stanford student body as a
whole reacts to liber
tarianism."
The question arises, is there
a need for political sympathy?
Do Stanford students require
political organizing skills and
active experience?
"Obviously," is Cheverton's
answer. He also said he is en
couraging many College Re
publicans to take advantage of
the SWOPSI course offered by
Krevoy and Schecter.
Krevoy, who sees his course
as a "catch-all for everyone
from novices to political vete
rans," said he finds it "person
ally distasteful that student
campaigners are reduced to
envelope-stuffing type ac
tivities" in political campaigns.
He said political awareness is
an asset in today's world, for
other reasons as well.
"You can't live without the
government. It's a monster
that's here to stay. . . . There's
no place you can hide from gov
ernment, whether you're talk
ing about parking tickets,
marijuana, or buying alcoholic
beverages in Palo Alto," he
said.
Schecter agrees. "The gov
ernments so damn pervasive,"

he said. "People in college are
so 'now' oriented that they
don't worry about things like
the Panama Canal, the Jarvis-
Gann initiative, the falling dol
lar because they won't feel the
impact.
All affected
"As much as government
doesn't affect us directly, al
most everybody is going to be
affected in some way," he ad
ded.
"The odds are good that
someday a large number of
people at this university are
going to take an active part in
the political system, other than
voting," he said.
Schecter, a veteran of the
Bob Finch campaign for U.S.
Senate in 1976 said, "This class
isn't going to be an equivalent
to taking a year off and working
full-time on a political cam
paign."
"But it's possibly the next
best thing," said Krevoy, also a
veteran campaign worker.
Speakers
The University can look for
ward to more than just
academics in the spring politi
cal scene. SCOPE promises an
energy program with Sen.
Lowell P. Weicker (R-Conn.),
and possible speaking appear
ances by Republican guber
natorial candidates and in
cumbent Jerry Brown.
Other possible speakers in
clude Theodore Sorenson, Ar
thur Schlesinger and "leading
officials from Carter's ad
ministration who are in
terested in speaking to West
Coast audiences," Weber said.
Political consultants Maxwell
Arnold and Bill Roberts, former
White House aide Robert Finch
and State Democratic Chair
man Burt Coffey are confirmed
to speak at the Krevoy and
Schecter workshop.

A forecast on intensity of
political activity this spring
shows highs and lows over the
nation, but political activity
here is expected to be low
compared to recent years.
A quick glimpse at the Uni
versity weather vane shows
temperate breezes blowing in
the direction of Sacramento
gubernatorial races, scattered
heat waves centered in the
White Plaza region and alluring
solar rays along the tropical
shores of Lake Lagunita.
This spring, Columbae
House and Ola Union appear
to be hot bed areas of the Uni
versity volcano, but the likeli
hood of eruption appears slim.
After sizzling '60s and
scorching early 70s, the politi
cal forecast for spring quarter
here looks relatively mild. A
pre-spring survey of leading
political indicators points to
lukewarm activity, centered
around state and national
primary elections, human
rights and the quest for politi
cal alternatives.
No sexy issues
"It's a shame there won't be
any real sexy issues on the bal
lot this spring," said Jon Schec
ter, a co-leader of spring
SWOPSI Course 196 entitled
"California Politics: Campaign
Tactics and Strategies," who
considers himself "a
political."
"I mean — what student at
this university really cares
about property taxes?" Schec
ter asked, referring to Califor
nia's Jarvis-Gann debate.
Still, the spring climate
promises to raise the level of
campus political awareness
with a helping hand from
specially-designed courses
and campus organizations. For
example, in addition to the
campaigning course, which
"emphasizes electoral politics
as a means of social change,"
SWOPSI offers three other
courses in community organiz
ing for spring quarter,
explained Chris Coleman,
SWOPSI course coordinator.
The other courses — Non
violent Resistance, Anarchist
Organizing, and Social Change
and Personal Lifestyle — will be
geared toward political change

and alternatives, with special
emphasis on actual practice:
workshops, journals, new lec
ture series and examination of
existing organizing efforts,
Coleman said.
Alternatives
Brad Krevoy, the other
leader of the Campaign Tactics
class, said SWOPSI provides
needed alternatives to the
existing academic political of
ferings.
"If our course had anything
to do with political science cur
riculum," he said, "it couldn't
be offered as a SWOPSI
course."
SWOPSI is not the only body
readying itself for spring.
Members of many other stu
dent organs hoping to ignite
Stanford's political climate
agree the campus is ready for a
new spring political wave.
Political preferences
One way to forecast the
political climate here is to sur
vey political preferences, Ac
cording to comments by lead
ers of some of Stanford's more
politically oriented groups, the
temperature varies depending
on the organization.
For example, the Conserva
tive Students Union (CSU) sees
itself at 45 degrees on a ther
mometer where 100 degrees is
most liberal. The Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), on the
other hand, puts itself at 90 de
grees.
Nearer to the radical end of
the political thermometer is
New Directions, Stanford's
new "internationalist" organi
zation which is designed to
educate students on domestic
and foreign policy. Cedric
Smith, steering committee
member and publicity chair
man, would put New Direc
tions at 70 degrees. He would
place the average Stanford
student at 50.
"Most of the time we are
supporting liberal causes,"
Smith said, "but political iden
tity really doesn't come up with
us — we're just trying to get the
facts out."
Libertarians
Michael Roberts, head of the
Young Libertarian Alliance,
with a perpetually updated list
of about 200 members, said his
group measures the climate of

political preference in a diffe
rent way.
"Libertarians are essentially
non-political people," he said.
"We tend to take a look at
modern politics, see that it's a
crock, and run for the hills."
Roberts said if one were to
grossly generalize by dividing
the political spectrum into two
sides — one the "economic"
outlook of the conservatives
and the other the "civil liber
ties" perspective of liberal,
communist and socialist
groups — libertarians would
straddle the fence.
"All the libertarians do is
recognize both kinds," he
said. "We just say, 'Hey gang!
It's all liberties, it's all human
rights, it's all the same thing.' "
Other measures of the local
political climate relate to the
general observations of non
partisan groups.
ASSU Senate
If one were to use the ASSU
Senate as an indicator, this
year's temperature would be
especially toasty. With a 12-
senator majority of Stanford
Organizing Committee (SOC)
members, the radical/
progressive contingent out
numbers the liberal/
moderate/conservative wing
by a margin of two to one.
Several senators recently
told a Stanford Daily reporter
that the ASSU is not an accurate
reflection of the political prop
ortions of Stanford students
and that more radical/
progressive opinions are rep
resented in the ASSU Senate
than exist proportionally in the
student body.
The CSU Arena recently re
ported that "the Senate's legis
lative record has, thankfully,
been relatively harmless."
Political candidate
Rick Weber, Stanford
Democrat and co-chairman of
the Stanford Committee on

ernment, whether you're talk
ing about parking tickets,
marijuana, or buying alcoholic
beverages in Palo Alto," he
said.
Schecter agrees. "The gov
ernments so damn pervasive,"

he said. "People in college are
so 'now' oriented that they
don't worry about things like
the Panama Canal, the Jarvis-
Gann initiative, the falling dol
lar because they won't feel the
impact.
All affected
"As much as government
doesn't affect us directly, al
most everybody is going to be
affected in some way," he ad
ded.
"The odds are good that
someday a large number of
people at this university are
going to take an active part in
the political system, other than
voting," he said.
Schecter, a veteran of the
Bob Finch campaign for U.S.
Senate in 1976 said, "This class
isn't going to be an equivalent
to taking a year off and working
full-time on a political cam
paign."
"But it's possibly the next
best thing," said Krevoy, also a
veteran campaign worker.

academics in the spring politi

A forecast on intensity of
political activity this spring
shows highs and lows over the
nation, but political activity
here is expected to be low
compared to recent years.
A quick glimpse at the Uni
versity weather vane shows
temperate breezes blowing in
the direction of Sacramento
gubernatorial races, scattered
heat waves centered in the
White Plaza region and alluring
solar rays along the tropical
shores of Lake Lagunita.
This spring, Columbae
House and Ola Union appear
to be hot bed areas of the Uni
versity volcano, but the likeli
hood of eruption appears slim.
After sizzling '60s and
scorching early 70s, the politi
cal forecast for spring quarter
here looks relatively mild. A
pre-spring survey of leading
political indicators points to
lukewarm activity, centered
around state and national
primary elections, human
rights and the quest for politi
cal alternatives.
No sexy issues
"It's a shame there won't be
any real sexy issues on the bal
lot this spring," said Jon Schec
ter, a co-leader of spring
SWOPSI Course 196 entitled
"California Politics: Campaign
Tactics and Strategies," who
considers himself "a
political."
"I mean — what student at
this university really cares
about property taxes?" Schec
ter asked, referring to Califor
nia's Jarvis-Gann debate.
Still, the spring climate
promises to raise the level of
campus political awareness
with a helping hand from
specially-designed courses
and campus organizations. For
example, in addition to the
campaigning course, which
"emphasizes electoral politics
as a means of social change,"
SWOPSI offers three other
courses in community organiz
ing for spring quarter,
explained Chris Coleman,
SWOPSI course coordinator.
The other courses — Non
violent Resistance, Anarchist
Organizing, and Social Change
and Personal Lifestyle — will be
geared toward political change

and alternatives, with special
emphasis on actual practice:
workshops, journals, new lec
ture series and examination of
existing organizing efforts,
Coleman said.
Alternatives
Brad Krevoy, the other
leader of the Campaign Tactics
class, said SWOPSI provides
needed alternatives to the
existing academic political of
ferings.
"If our course had anything
to do with political science cur
riculum," he said, "it couldn't
be offered as a SWOPSI
course."
SWOPSI is not the only body
readying itself for spring.
Members of many other stu
dent organs hoping to ignite
Stanford's political climate
agree the campus is ready for a
new spring political wave.
Political preferences
One way to forecast the
political climate here is to sur
vey political preferences, Ac
cording to comments by lead
ers of some of Stanford's more
politically oriented groups, the
temperature varies depending
on the organization.
For example, the Conserva
tive Students Union (CSU) sees
itself at 45 degrees on a ther
mometer where 100 degrees is
most liberal. The Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), on the
other hand, puts itself at 90 de
grees.
Nearer to the radical end of
the political thermometer is
New Directions, Stanford's
new "internationalist" organi
zation which is designed to
educate students on domestic
and foreign policy. Cedric
Smith, steering committee
member and publicity chair
man, would put New Direc
tions at 70 degrees. He would
place the average Stanford
student at 50.
"Most of the time we are
supporting liberal causes,"
Smith said, "but political iden
tity really doesn't come up with
us — we're just trying to get the
facts out."
Libertarians
Michael Roberts, head of the
Young Libertarian Alliance,
with a perpetually updated list
of about 200 members, said his
group measures the climate of

political preference in a diffe
rent way.
"Libertarians are essentially
non-political people," he said.
"We tend to take a look at
modern politics, see that it's a
crock, and run for the hills."
Roberts said if one were to
grossly generalize by dividing
the political spectrum into two
sides — one the "economic"
outlook of the conservatives
and the other the "civil liber
ties" perspective of liberal,
communist and socialist
groups — libertarians would
straddle the fence.
"All the libertarians do is
recognize both kinds," he
said. "We just say, 'Hey gang!
It's all liberties, it's all human
rights, it's all the same thing.' "
Other measures of the local
political climate relate to the
general observations of non
partisan groups.
ASSU Senate
If one were to use the ASSU
Senate as an indicator, this
year's temperature would be
especially toasty. With a 12-
senator majority of Stanford
Organizing Committee (SOC)
members, the radical/
progressive contingent out
numbers the liberal/
moderate/conservative wing
by a margin of two to one.
Several senators recently
told a Stanford Daily reporter
that the ASSU is not an accurate
reflection of the political prop
ortions of Stanford students
and that more radical/
progressive opinions are rep
resented in the ASSU Senate
than exist proportionally in the
student body.
The CSU Arena recently re
ported that "the Senate's legis
lative record has, thankfully,
been relatively harmless."
Political candidate
Rick Weber, Stanford
Democrat and co-chairman of
the Stanford Committee on
Political Education (SCOPE),
has another method of gauging
the student body's political
stance. He describes the aver
age Stanford student accord
ing to his choice of political
candidate. This is because, he
said, "most students do not
wear their politics on their
sleeve."
"A good indicator of the

Stanford temperature might be
Congressman Pete McClos
key," he said. "For most Stan
ford Democrats and Republi
cans, David Harris was just a bit
too liberal. When I have talked
to Stanford students, in gen
eral I have been surprised at
their political conservatism."
Another clue to the student
body's political leaning might
be its overall voter registration.
Out of the 5355 Stanford voters
registered with Santa Clara
County, 61 per cent are Demo
crat and 25 per cent Republi
can, according to the county
registrar of voters.
Decline to state
A full 13 per cent are "D.S."
voters, meaning they "decline
to state" their political prefer
ence, and the remaining 1
per cent is registered American
Independent, Peace and Free
dom or "miscellaneous." Stan
ford's proportion of D.S. vot
ers is a significant 5 per cent
higher than the country aver
age, and its 8 per cent in
the American Independent
category is lower.
It is important to remember
the limitations of each type of
thermometer. Political perter
ence statistics alone are not
necessarily accurate indicators
of political "sizzle" on campus,
nor can they serve to forecast
the overall temperature for
spring.
The general consensus on
student awareness among stu
dent group leaders points to a
significant need for en
lightenment. For one reason or
another, most students lack
both the skills and the aware
ness to make the outside polit
ical system work for them.
Educational objectives
"We're working on the pre
mise that the public is una
ware," Smith said of New Di
rections, "so the objectives of

our activities are basically edu
cational."
"I wouldn't say that it was so
much apathy any more, I
would say it's just that people
are unaware of their involve
ment in international issues,"
he continued. "I think the
reason people don't know is
because they think it's too
complex — too abstract.
"There is not really any
clear-cut threat like a com
munist monolith or capitalist
conspiracy to make things
simpler for people," he said.
Little interest
Another reason for little
political awareness may be lit
tle political interest, suggested
ARC member Rick Levy. The
ARC is helping sponsor Dis
orientation Week, scheduled
for April 15 though 23. The
week will propose all kinds of
alternatives to students' politi
cal leanings, "so people can ac
tually think about what they're
doing instead of being chan
nelled automatically by Stan
ford into the so-called Real
World," Levy said.
"I can't imagine people get
ting too excited over the gov
ernorship campaign because
of the limited range of
choices," he said. "You can
only work really hard on the
things you believe in."
Time and priorities
Roger Greene, president of
the CSU, said he thinks ac
tivism is a function of available
time and priorities. "For the
most part, people get so wrap
ped up in what they're doing
here they don't really know
what's going on outside," he
said.
Other groups may be
ideologically disenchanted
with the political scene, said
Roberts of the Young Liberta
rians.
"Politics has earned its dirty

hands over the years," Roberts
said. "Those aspects of it which
are not clean, we stay away
from. For example, we're out
for minimizing government
participation to a great extent,
so what do we do about cam
paign contributions?" he
asked. "We don't accept fed
eral funds at all. And that kind
of ties our hands."
Roberts said he is not sure
how most students here re
spond to libertarianism be
cause of his time limitations. "I
haven't had the time to get the
ball rolling," he complained.
"There has not been enough
input from me to gauge how
the Stanford student body as a
whole reacts to liber
tarianism."
The question arises, is there
a need for political sympathy?
Do Stanford students require
political organizing skills and
active experience?
"Obviously," is Cheverton's
answer. He also said he is en
couraging many College Re
publicans to take advantage of
the SWOPSI course offered by
Krevoy and Schecter.
Krevoy, who sees his course
as a "catch-all for everyone
from novices to political vete
rans," said he finds it "person
ally distasteful that student
campaigners are reduced to
envelope-stuffing type ac
tivities" in political campaigns.
He said political awareness is
an asset in today's world, for
other reasons as well.
"You can't live without the
government. It's a monster
that's here to stay. . . . There's
no place you can hide from gov
ernment, whether you're talk
ing about parking tickets,
marijuana, or buying alcoholic
beverages in Palo Alto," he
said.
Schecter agrees. "The gov
ernments so damn pervasive,"

he said. "People in college are
so 'now' oriented that they
don't worry about things like
the Panama Canal, the Jarvis-
Gann initiative, the falling dol
lar because they won't feel the
impact.

"As much as government

most everybody is going to be

ded.
"The odds are good that
someday a large number of
people at this university are

Radical Change (ARC), on the
other hand, puts itself at 90 de
grees.
Nearer to the radical end of
the political thermometer is
New Directions, Stanford's
new "internationalist" organi
zation which is designed to
educate students on domestic
and foreign policy. Cedric
Smith, steering committee
member and publicity chair
man, would put New Direc
tions at 70 degrees. He would
place the average Stanford
student at 50.
"Most of the time we are
supporting liberal causes,"
Smith said, "but political iden
tity really doesn't come up with
us — we're just trying to get the
facts out."
Libertarians
Michael Roberts, head of the
Young Libertarian Alliance,
with a perpetually updated list
of about 200 members, said his
group measures the climate of

political preference in a diffe
rent way.
"Libertarians are essentially
non-political people," he said.
"We tend to take a look at
modern politics, see that it's a
crock, and run for the hills."
Roberts said if one were to
grossly generalize by dividing
the political spectrum into two
sides — one the "economic"
outlook of the conservatives
and the other the "civil liber
ties" perspective of liberal,
communist and socialist
groups — libertarians would
straddle the fence.
"All the libertarians do is
recognize both kinds," he
said. "We just say, 'Hey gang!
It's all liberties, it's all human
rights, it's all the same thing.' "
Other measures of the local
political climate relate to the
general observations of non
partisan groups.
ASSU Senate
If one were to use the ASSU
Senate as an indicator, this
year's temperature would be
especially toasty. With a 12-
senator majority of Stanford
Organizing Committee (SOC)
members, the radical/
progressive contingent out
numbers the liberal/
moderate/conservative wing
by a margin of two to one.
Several senators recently
told a Stanford Daily reporter
that the ASSU is not an accurate
reflection of the political prop
ortions of Stanford students
and that more radical/
progressive opinions are rep
resented in the ASSU Senate
than exist proportionally in the
student body.
The CSU Arena recently re
ported that "the Senate's legis
lative record has, thankfully,
been relatively harmless."
Political candidate
Rick Weber, Stanford
Democrat and co-chairman of
the Stanford Committee on
Political Education (SCOPE),
has another method of gauging
the student body's political
stance. He describes the aver
age Stanford student accord
ing to his choice of political
candidate. This is because, he
said, "most students do not
wear their politics on their
sleeve."
"A good indicator of the

Stanford temperature might be
Congressman Pete McClos
key," he said. "For most Stan
ford Democrats and Republi
cans, David Harris was just a bit
too liberal. When I have talked
to Stanford students, in gen
eral I have been surprised at
their political conservatism."
Another clue to the student
body's political leaning might
be its overall voter registration.
Out of the 5355 Stanford voters
registered with Santa Clara
County, 61 per cent are Demo
crat and 25 per cent Republi
can, according to the county
registrar of voters.
Decline to state
A full 13 per cent are "D.S."
voters, meaning they "decline
to state" their political prefer
ence, and the remaining 1
per cent is registered American
Independent, Peace and Free
dom or "miscellaneous." Stan
ford's proportion of D.S. vot
ers is a significant 5 per cent
higher than the country aver
age, and its 8 per cent in
the American Independent
category is lower.
It is important to remember
the limitations of each type of
thermometer. Political perter
ence statistics alone are not
necessarily accurate indicators
of political "sizzle" on campus,
nor can they serve to forecast
the overall temperature for
spring.
The general consensus on
student awareness among stu
dent group leaders points to a
significant need for en
lightenment. For one reason or
another, most students lack
both the skills and the aware
ness to make the outside polit
ical system work for them.
Educational objectives
"We're working on the pre
mise that the public is una
ware," Smith said of New Di
rections, "so the objectives of

our activities are basically edu
cational."
"I wouldn't say that it was so
much apathy any more, I
would say it's just that people
are unaware of their involve
ment in international issues,"
he continued. "I think the
reason people don't know is
because they think it's too
complex — too abstract.
"There is not really any
clear-cut threat like a com
munist monolith or capitalist
conspiracy to make things
simpler for people," he said.
Little interest
Another reason for little
political awareness may be lit
tle political interest, suggested
ARC member Rick Levy. The
ARC is helping sponsor Dis
orientation Week, scheduled
for April 15 though 23. The
week will propose all kinds of
alternatives to students' politi
cal leanings, "so people can ac
tually think about what they're
doing instead of being chan
nelled automatically by Stan
ford into the so-called Real
World," Levy said.
"I can't imagine people get
ting too excited over the gov
ernorship campaign because
of the limited range of
choices," he said. "You can
only work really hard on the
things you believe in."
Time and priorities
Roger Greene, president of
the CSU, said he thinks ac
tivism is a function of available
time and priorities. "For the
most part, people get so wrap
ped up in what they're doing
here they don't really know
what's going on outside," he
said.
Other groups may be
ideologically disenchanted
with the political scene, said
Roberts of the Young Liberta
rians.
"Politics has earned its dirty

hands over the years," Roberts
said. "Those aspects of it which
are not clean, we stay away
from. For example, we're out
for minimizing government
participation to a great extent,
so what do we do about cam
paign contributions?" he
asked. "We don't accept fed
eral funds at all. And that kind
of ties our hands."
Roberts said he is not sure
how most students here re
spond to libertarianism be
cause of his time limitations. "I
haven't had the time to get the
ball rolling," he complained.
"There has not been enough
input from me to gauge how
the Stanford student body as a
whole reacts to liber
tarianism."
The question arises, is there
a need for political sympathy?
Do Stanford students require
political organizing skills and
active experience?
"Obviously," is Cheverton's
answer. He also said he is en
couraging many College Re
publicans to take advantage of
the SWOPSI course offered by
Krevoy and Schecter.
Krevoy, who sees his course
as a "catch-all for everyone
from novices to political vete
rans," said he finds it "person
ally distasteful that student
campaigners are reduced to
envelope-stuffing type ac
tivities" in political campaigns.
He said political awareness is
an asset in today's world, for
other reasons as well.
"You can't live without the
government. It's a monster
that's here to stay. . . . There's
no place you can hide from gov
ernment, whether you're talk
ing about parking tickets,
marijuana, or buying alcoholic
beverages in Palo Alto," he
said.
Schecter agrees. "The gov
ernments so damn pervasive,"

he said. "People in college are
so 'now' oriented that they
don't worry about things like
the Panama Canal, the Jarvis-
Gann initiative, the falling dol
lar because they won't feel the
impact.
All affected
"As much as government
doesn't affect us directly, al
most everybody is going to be
affected in some way," he ad
ded.
"The odds are good that
someday a large number of
people at this university are
going to take an active part in
the political system, other than
voting," he said.
Schecter, a veteran of the
Bob Finch campaign for U.S.
Senate in 1976 said, "This class
isn't going to be an equivalent
to taking a year off and working
full-time on a political cam
paign."
"But it's possibly the next
best thing," said Krevoy, also a
veteran campaign worker.
Speakers
The University can look for
ward to more than just
academics in the spring politi
cal scene. SCOPE promises an
energy program with Sen.
Lowell P. Weicker (R-Conn.),
and possible speaking appear
ances by Republican guber
natorial candidates and in
cumbent Jerry Brown.
Other possible speakers in
clude Theodore Sorenson, Ar
thur Schlesinger and "leading
officials from Carter's ad
ministration who are in
terested in speaking to West
Coast audiences," Weber said.
Political consultants Maxwell
Arnold and Bill Roberts, former
White House aide Robert Finch
and State Democratic Chair
man Burt Coffey are confirmed
to speak at the Krevoy and
Schecter workshop.

Democrats co-president; Cedric Smith, New Directions steering
committee and publicity member; and Rick Levy, member speaking
for ARC.
A forecast on intensity of
political activity this spring
shows highs and lows over the
nation, but political activity
here is expected to be low
compared to recent years.
A quick glimpse at the Uni
versity weather vane shows
temperate breezes blowing in
the direction of Sacramento
gubernatorial races, scattered
heat waves centered in the
White Plaza region and alluring
solar rays along the tropical
shores of Lake Lagunita.
This spring, Columbae
House and Ola Union appear
to be hot bed areas of the Uni
versity volcano, but the likeli
hood of eruption appears slim.
After sizzling '60s and
scorching early 70s, the politi
cal forecast for spring quarter
here looks relatively mild. A
pre-spring survey of leading
political indicators points to
lukewarm activity, centered
around state and national
primary elections, human
rights and the quest for politi
cal alternatives.
No sexy issues
"It's a shame there won't be
any real sexy issues on the bal
lot this spring," said Jon Schec
ter, a co-leader of spring
SWOPSI Course 196 entitled
"California Politics: Campaign
Tactics and Strategies," who
considers himself "a
political."
"I mean — what student at
this university really cares
about property taxes?" Schec
ter asked, referring to Califor
nia's Jarvis-Gann debate.
Still, the spring climate
promises to raise the level of
campus political awareness
with a helping hand from
specially-designed courses
and campus organizations. For
example, in addition to the
campaigning course, which
"emphasizes electoral politics
as a means of social change,"
SWOPSI offers three other
courses in community organiz
ing for spring quarter,
explained Chris Coleman,
SWOPSI course coordinator.
The other courses — Non
violent Resistance, Anarchist
Organizing, and Social Change
and Personal Lifestyle — will be
geared toward political change

and alternatives, with special
emphasis on actual practice:
workshops, journals, new lec
ture series and examination of
existing organizing efforts,
Coleman said.
Alternatives
Brad Krevoy, the other
leader of the Campaign Tactics
class, said SWOPSI provides
needed alternatives to the
existing academic political of
ferings.
"If our course had anything
to do with political science cur
riculum," he said, "it couldn't
be offered as a SWOPSI
course."
SWOPSI is not the only body
readying itself for spring.
Members of many other stu
dent organs hoping to ignite
Stanford's political climate
agree the campus is ready for a
new spring political wave.
Political preferences
One way to forecast the
political climate here is to sur
vey political preferences, Ac
cording to comments by lead
ers of some of Stanford's more
politically oriented groups, the
temperature varies depending
on the organization.
For example, the Conserva
tive Students Union (CSU) sees
itself at 45 degrees on a ther
mometer where 100 degrees is
most liberal. The Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), on the
other hand, puts itself at 90 de
grees.

and foreign policy. Cedric

nelled automatically by Stan
ford into the so-called Real
World," Levy said.
"I can't imagine people get
ting too excited over the gov
ernorship campaign because
of the limited range of
choices," he said. "You can
only work really hard on the
things you believe in."
Time and priorities
Roger Greene, president of
the CSU, said he thinks ac
tivism is a function of available
time and priorities. "For the
most part, people get so wrap
ped up in what they're doing
here they don't really know
what's going on outside," he
said.
Other groups may be
ideologically disenchanted
with the political scene, said
Roberts of the Young Liberta
rians.
"Politics has earned its dirty

hands over the years," Roberts
said. "Those aspects of it which
are not clean, we stay away
from. For example, we're out
for minimizing government
participation to a great extent,
so what do we do about cam
paign contributions?" he
asked. "We don't accept fed
eral funds at all. And that kind
of ties our hands."
Roberts said he is not sure
how most students here re
spond to libertarianism be
cause of his time limitations. "I
haven't had the time to get the
ball rolling," he complained.
"There has not been enough
input from me to gauge how
the Stanford student body as a
whole reacts to liber
tarianism."
The question arises, is there
a need for political sympathy?
Do Stanford students require
political organizing skills and
active experience?
"Obviously," is Cheverton's
answer. He also said he is en
couraging many College Re
publicans to take advantage of
the SWOPSI course offered by
Krevoy and Schecter.
Krevoy, who sees his course
as a "catch-all for everyone
from novices to political vete
rans," said he finds it "person
ally distasteful that student
campaigners are reduced to
envelope-stuffing type ac
tivities" in political campaigns.
He said political awareness is
an asset in today's world, for
other reasons as well.
"You can't live without the
government. It's a monster
that's here to stay. . . . There's
no place you can hide from gov
ernment, whether you're talk
ing about parking tickets,
marijuana, or buying alcoholic
beverages in Palo Alto," he
said.
Schecter agrees. "The gov
ernments so damn pervasive,"

he said. "People in college are
so 'now' oriented that they
don't worry about things like
the Panama Canal, the Jarvis-
Gann initiative, the falling dol
lar because they won't feel the
impact.
All affected
"As much as government
doesn't affect us directly, al
most everybody is going to be
affected in some way," he ad
ded.
"The odds are good that
someday a large number of
people at this university are
going to take an active part in
the political system, other than
voting," he said.
Schecter, a veteran of the
Bob Finch campaign for U.S.
Senate in 1976 said, "This class
isn't going to be an equivalent
to taking a year off and working
full-time on a political cam
paign."
"But it's possibly the next
best thing," said Krevoy, also a
veteran campaign worker.
Speakers
The University can look for
ward to more than just
academics in the spring politi
cal scene. SCOPE promises an
energy program with Sen.
Lowell P. Weicker (R-Conn.),
and possible speaking appear
ances by Republican guber
natorial candidates and in
cumbent Jerry Brown.
Other possible speakers in
clude Theodore Sorenson, Ar
thur Schlesinger and "leading
officials from Carter's ad
ministration who are in
terested in speaking to West
Coast audiences," Weber said.
Political consultants Maxwell
Arnold and Bill Roberts, former
White House aide Robert Finch
and State Democratic Chair
man Burt Coffey are confirmed
to speak at the Krevoy and
Schecter workshop.

A forecast on intensity of
political activity this spring
shows highs and lows over the
nation, but political activity
here is expected to be low
compared to recent years.
A quick glimpse at the Uni
versity weather vane shows
temperate breezes blowing in
the direction of Sacramento
gubernatorial races, scattered
heat waves centered in the
White Plaza region and alluring
solar rays along the tropical
shores of Lake Lagunita.
This spring, Columbae
House and Ola Union appear
to be hot bed areas of the Uni
versity volcano, but the likeli
hood of eruption appears slim.
After sizzling '60s and
scorching early 70s, the politi
cal forecast for spring quarter
here looks relatively mild. A
pre-spring survey of leading
political indicators points to
lukewarm activity, centered
around state and national
primary elections, human
rights and the quest for politi
cal alternatives.
No sexy issues
"It's a shame there won't be
any real sexy issues on the bal
lot this spring," said Jon Schec
ter, a co-leader of spring
SWOPSI Course 196 entitled
"California Politics: Campaign
Tactics and Strategies," who
considers himself "a
political."
"I mean — what student at
this university really cares
about property taxes?" Schec
ter asked, referring to Califor
nia's Jarvis-Gann debate.
Still, the spring climate
promises to raise the level of
campus political awareness
with a helping hand from
specially-designed courses
and campus organizations. For
example, in addition to the
campaigning course, which
"emphasizes electoral politics
as a means of social change,"
SWOPSI offers three other
courses in community organiz
ing for spring quarter,
explained Chris Coleman,
SWOPSI course coordinator.
The other courses — Non
violent Resistance, Anarchist
Organizing, and Social Change
and Personal Lifestyle — will be
geared toward political change

and alternatives, with special
emphasis on actual practice:
workshops, journals, new lec
ture series and examination of
existing organizing efforts,
Coleman said.
Alternatives
Brad Krevoy, the other
leader of the Campaign Tactics
class, said SWOPSI provides
needed alternatives to the
existing academic political of
ferings.
"If our course had anything
to do with political science cur
riculum," he said, "it couldn't
be offered as a SWOPSI
course."
SWOPSI is not the only body
readying itself for spring.
Members of many other stu
dent organs hoping to ignite
Stanford's political climate
agree the campus is ready for a
new spring political wave.
Political preferences
One way to forecast the
political climate here is to sur
vey political preferences, Ac
cording to comments by lead
ers of some of Stanford's more
politically oriented groups, the
temperature varies depending
on the organization.
For example, the Conserva
tive Students Union (CSU) sees
itself at 45 degrees on a ther
mometer where 100 degrees is
most liberal. The Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), on the
other hand, puts itself at 90 de
grees.
Nearer to the radical end of
the political thermometer is
New Directions, Stanford's
new "internationalist" organi
zation which is designed to
educate students on domestic
and foreign policy. Cedric
Smith, steering committee
member and publicity chair
man, would put New Direc
tions at 70 degrees. He would
place the average Stanford
student at 50.
"Most of the time we are
supporting liberal causes,"
Smith said, "but political iden
tity really doesn't come up with
us — we're just trying to get the
facts out."
Libertarians
Michael Roberts, head of the
Young Libertarian Alliance,
with a perpetually updated list
of about 200 members, said his
group measures the climate of

political preference in a diffe
rent way.
"Libertarians are essentially
non-political people," he said.
"We tend to take a look at
modern politics, see that it's a
crock, and run for the hills."
Roberts said if one were to
grossly generalize by dividing
the political spectrum into two
sides — one the "economic"
outlook of the conservatives
and the other the "civil liber
ties" perspective of liberal,
communist and socialist
groups — libertarians would
straddle the fence.
"All the libertarians do is
recognize both kinds," he
said. "We just say, 'Hey gang!
It's all liberties, it's all human
rights, it's all the same thing.' "
Other measures of the local
political climate relate to the
general observations of non
partisan groups.
ASSU Senate
If one were to use the ASSU
Senate as an indicator, this
year's temperature would be
especially toasty. With a 12-
senator majority of Stanford
Organizing Committee (SOC)
members, the radical/
progressive contingent out
numbers the liberal/
moderate/conservative wing
by a margin of two to one.
Several senators recently
told a Stanford Daily reporter
that the ASSU is not an accurate
reflection of the political prop
ortions of Stanford students
and that more radical/
progressive opinions are rep
resented in the ASSU Senate
than exist proportionally in the
student body.
The CSU Arena recently re
ported that "the Senate's legis
lative record has, thankfully,
been relatively harmless."
Political candidate
Rick Weber, Stanford
Democrat and co-chairman of
the Stanford Committee on
Political Education (SCOPE),
has another method of gauging
the student body's political
stance. He describes the aver
age Stanford student accord
ing to his choice of political
candidate. This is because, he
said, "most students do not
wear their politics on their
sleeve."
"A good indicator of the

Stanford temperature might be
Congressman Pete McClos
key," he said. "For most Stan
ford Democrats and Republi
cans, David Harris was just a bit
too liberal. When I have talked
to Stanford students, in gen
eral I have been surprised at
their political conservatism."
Another clue to the student
body's political leaning might
be its overall voter registration.
Out of the 5355 Stanford voters
registered with Santa Clara
County, 61 per cent are Demo
crat and 25 per cent Republi
can, according to the county
registrar of voters.
Decline to state
A full 13 per cent are "D.S."
voters, meaning they "decline
to state" their political prefer
ence, and the remaining 1
per cent is registered American
Independent, Peace and Free
dom or "miscellaneous." Stan
ford's proportion of D.S. vot
ers is a significant 5 per cent
higher than the country aver
age, and its 8 per cent in
the American Independent
category is lower.
It is important to remember
the limitations of each type of
thermometer. Political perter
ence statistics alone are not
necessarily accurate indicators
of political "sizzle" on campus,
nor can they serve to forecast
the overall temperature for
spring.
The general consensus on
student awareness among stu
dent group leaders points to a
significant need for en
lightenment. For one reason or
another, most students lack
both the skills and the aware
ness to make the outside polit
ical system work for them.
Educational objectives
"We're working on the pre
mise that the public is una
ware," Smith said of New Di
rections, "so the objectives of

our activities are basically edu
cational."
"I wouldn't say that it was so
much apathy any more, I
would say it's just that people
are unaware of their involve
ment in international issues,"
he continued. "I think the
reason people don't know is
because they think it's too
complex — too abstract.
"There is not really any
clear-cut threat like a com
munist monolith or capitalist
conspiracy to make things
simpler for people," he said.
Little interest
Another reason for little
political awareness may be lit
tle political interest, suggested
ARC member Rick Levy. The
ARC is helping sponsor Dis
orientation Week, scheduled
for April 15 though 23. The
week will propose all kinds of
alternatives to students' politi
cal leanings, "so people can ac
tually think about what they're
doing instead of being chan
nelled automatically by Stan
ford into the so-called Real
World," Levy said.
"I can't imagine people get
ting too excited over the gov
ernorship campaign because
of the limited range of
choices," he said. "You can
only work really hard on the
things you believe in."

Roger Greene, president of
the CSU, said he thinks ac
tivism is a function of available
time and priorities. "For the
most part, people get so wrap
