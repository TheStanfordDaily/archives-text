# Legitimate recreational activity
## Agency head favors hunting 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service Director
Lynn Greenwalt, in a rare out
burst of anger, wants to stop
any movement aimed at end
ing hunting, fishing or trapping
on some national wildlife re
fugees.
"It should be made clear that
the service holds that hunting,
fishing and trapping . . . are
recognized and legitimate re
creational activities," Green
walt said.
Greenwalt's declaration sur
prised many observers be
cause it came prior to the re
lease of a refuge task force
suggestion that some forms of
hunting, especially resident,
nonmigratory species of birds
and animals, should be halted.
Traditionally, task force re
ports are issued with the re
quest that interested parties
comment on any recommen
dations. The service then re
views the comments before
deciding which recommenda
tions to adopt or reject.
But Greenwalt apparently
felt so strongly about the issue
that he decided to include his
comments with the task force
report, and ordered 10,000
copies printed. At the same
time, he asked for individuals
to give their opinion on the is
sue.
One task force member, Dr.
John Grandy, executive vice
president of Defenders of
Wildlife and a critic of refuge
hunting, argued Greenwalt's
actions make the process
meaningless.
"What's left for the public to
comment about?" he asked.
"Greenwalt's already made up
his mind."
The issue, which first sur
faced publicly in an Associated
Press report, threatens to be
come more heated in the fu
ture, especially over the
method in which it was hand
led.
While Greenwalt asked for
comments on his personal
opinions, he also spoke for the
service.
"The service cannot agree
with the implication that hunt
ing or fishing or trapping is not

a legitimate activity," he said in
the report.
National wildlife refuges
provide some sportsmen with
a place to hunt. The species
hunted include big game,
small game, upland birds and
waterfowl.
Some individuals like
Crandy argue that wildlife re
fuges should give priority to
wildlife, providing them with
surcease from hunting pres
sure.
Greenwalt, however, argues
that nature often provides an
abundance, and that these in

dividuals will die regardless of
man's activity. Some birds will
succumb to disease, others will
be eaten by hawks, and still
others may perish from starva
tion.
There is no reason, Green
wait argues, to prohibit man
from taking excess wildlife via
the gun, bow or trap, even on
some wildlife refuges.
"Consumptive use of
wildlife, when properly man
aged, has no adverse effect on
the long-term well-being of
fish or wildlife populations or
their habitats," he said.
