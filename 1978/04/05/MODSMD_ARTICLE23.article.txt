# China, Europeans sign trade treaty

Brussels, Belgium (AP) —
China and the Common Mar
ket signed their first trade tre
aty Monday, a document short
on specifics but symbolizing
Western Europe's rivalry with
America and Japan to supply
China's crash industrialization
program.
Under the five-year pact,
China and the Europeans
promise favorable considera
tion to each other's exports,
but make no commitments on
the kind or amount of goods to
be traded.
The treaty establishes a joint
trade committee that will meet
every year and includes a
pledge to consult each other
before drastic action, such as
imposing tariffs or import
quotas. The Europeans also
promise to ease some current
quotas on imports from China.
The document was signed
here by Li Chiang, Chinese
minister for external trade, and
Danish Foreign Minister K.B.
Anderson, current chairman of
the Common Market Council
of Ministers.
Li represents a Communist
government now firmly domi
nated by pragmatists who,
after a period of ferment dur
ing which powerful radicals
militated against foreign influ

ence, are seeking outside help
to reach a goal of full industrial
modernization by the year
2000.
Anderson represents nine
West European govern
ments — including West
Germany, Britain, France and
Italy—whose population and
combined economic power ri
vals that of the United States.
They also have modern indust
rial plants, 6.5 million un
employed and a depressed
business community eager to
deal with China, the world's
most populous nation.
The Europeans would like
eventually to sell China a series
of factories — chemical plants,
metal industries, automobile
works and arms factories.
China may be able to pay for
much of this with oil from its
petroleum reserves, which are
largely unexplored but which
China believes to be extensive.
American businessmen also
hope to get a slice of the
Chinese trade pie. But U.S. re
luctance to extend full dip
lomatic recognition to China at
the expense of Taiwan is be
lieved to have influenced the
Chinese to conclude deals first
with the Japanese and Euro
peans.
