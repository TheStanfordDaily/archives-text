# At Academy Awards
## Redgrave speech causes uproar 
### 
Hollywood (AP) — The movie
stars and the hangers-on
danced into the wee hours yes
terday at the Academy Ball —
celebrating Oscar's 50th birth
day and grumbling about Van
essa Redgrave's political out
burst.
While the British star's award
for supporting actress in
"Julia" was applauded, her ac
ceptance speech was booed.
The jeering began when she re
ferred to some of her critics as
"Zionist hoodlums."
"She insuted the Academy;
vve voted for her performance,
not her politics," snapped an
.actress who declined to be
identified.
"When you invite a re
volutionary to dinner, you're
going to get a speech,"
reasoned a producer.
Most officials declined to
enter the controversy. Howard
Koch, president of the
Academy, refused to com
ment, preferring to cite audi
ence ratings — "the biggest in
Academy history."
Emcee Bob Hope ducked out
after the telecast and didn't at
tend the ball.
An informal poll at the
$150-a-plate gala indicated
support for writer Paddy
Chayefsky's on-camera riposte
to Redgrave:
"I'm sick and tired of people
exploiting the occasion of the
Academy Awards for the prop
agation of their own personal
political propaganda. I would
like to suggest to Miss Red
grave that her winning an
Academy Award is not a pivotal
moment in history — does not
require a proclamation. A sim
ple 'thank you' would have suf
ficed."
The New York Post yesterday
quoted Chayefsky as saying:
"She tried to speak to me af
terward and I cut her dead. I
wanted to say more to the
worldwide audience, but the
hell with it, why make her the
martyr she wants to be?"
And, the Post quoted come
dian Alan King as saying, "I am
that Zionist hoodlum she was
talking about. It's just a pity I
wasn't on the platform ... I
would have gone for the jugu
lar."
Expectably for a golden an
niversary, the Oscarcast was
long — just under three hours.
But the film crowd seemed to
think that it was one of the

best. The glamorous look was
back, along with Hollywood's
good ole boy, Bob Hope. Judg
ing from the ratings, the home
audience liked the show.
ABC, which telecast the
show nationwide, said yester
day that preliminary research
from New York, Chicago and
Los Angeles indicated that
about 70 million people
watched the show — the
largest audience in the history
of the Oscar programs. The
show ended shortly before 1
a.m. EST.
The Redgrave imbroglio al
most overshadowed the other
awards, but not quite. While
Woody Allen was tooting a
clarinet in a Manhattan pub, he
won Oscars for writing and di
recting "Annie Hall" — but not
for his starring role. Richard
Dreyfuss, who portrayed an
actor on the rise in "The
Goodbye Girl," was chosen
best actor instead of Allen.

Diane Keaton was best ac
tress for playing an aspiring ac
tress in "Annie Hall," and Al
len's comedy was declared
best picture of 1977. Jason
Robards, as Dashiell Hammett
in "Julia," won his second
straight supporting-actor Os
car.
Redgrave's award was the
first of the Monday night tele
cast. She pushed the awards
off to a controversial start by
congratulating the voters for
"refusing to be intimidated by
the actions of a small bunch of
Zionist hoodlums."
She referred to protests of
the Jewish Defense League
over her pro-Palestinian film
documentary which features
an interview with Palestine
Liberation Organization chief
Yasser Arafat.
Jane Fonda was quoted yes
terday in Daily Variety as hav
ing refused Redgrave's invita
tion to join her in filming the

documentary, "The Palesti
nians."
Fonda, who won a best ac
tress Oscar in 1971 for the
movie "Klute," told Variety: "I
said it was a mistake for her to
be in it. I think her Mideast
views are highly unrealisticand
can lead only to more turmoil."
The politicization of the
awards in recent years con
cerns Academy leaders, but
they have found no way to
combat it. Marlon Brando used
the event in 1972 to decry film
treatment of the American In
dian, sending Sacheen
Littlefeather to regretfully re
fuse his Oscar for "The God
father."
In accepting an award for an
anti-war documentary in 1974,
producer Bert Schneider ex
pressed greetings to the Viet
Cong. Bob Hope was so upset
that he wrote a disclaimer
which Frank Sinatra read on
the telecast.

Expectably for a golden an
niversary, the Oscarcast was
long — just under three hours.
But the film crowd seemed to
think that it was one of the

best. The glamorous look was
back, along with Hollywood's
good ole boy, Bob Hope. Judg
ing from the ratings, the home
audience liked the show.
ABC, which telecast the
show nationwide, said yester
day that preliminary research
from New York, Chicago and
Los Angeles indicated that
about 70 million people
watched the show — the
largest audience in the history
of the Oscar programs. The
show ended shortly before 1
a.m. EST.
The Redgrave imbroglio al
most overshadowed the other
awards, but not quite. While
Woody Allen was tooting a
clarinet in a Manhattan pub, he
won Oscars for writing and di
recting "Annie Hall" — but not
for his starring role. Richard
Dreyfuss, who portrayed an
actor on the rise in "The
Goodbye Girl," was chosen
best actor instead of Allen.

Diane Keaton was best ac
tress for playing an aspiring ac
tress in "Annie Hall," and Al
len's comedy was declared
best picture of 1977. Jason
Robards, as Dashiell Hammett
in "Julia," won his second
straight supporting-actor Os
car.
Redgrave's award was the
first of the Monday night tele
cast. She pushed the awards
off to a controversial start by
congratulating the voters for
"refusing to be intimidated by
the actions of a small bunch of
Zionist hoodlums."
She referred to protests of
the Jewish Defense League
over her pro-Palestinian film
documentary which features
an interview with Palestine
Liberation Organization chief
Yasser Arafat.
Jane Fonda was quoted yes
terday in Daily Variety as hav
ing refused Redgrave's invita
tion to join her in filming the

documentary, "The Palesti
nians."
Fonda, who won a best ac
tress Oscar in 1971 for the
movie "Klute," told Variety: "I
said it was a mistake for her to
be in it. I think her Mideast
views are highly unrealisticand
can lead only to more turmoil."
The politicization of the
awards in recent years con
cerns Academy leaders, but
they have found no way to
combat it. Marlon Brando used
the event in 1972 to decry film
treatment of the American In
dian, sending Sacheen
Littlefeather to regretfully re
fuse his Oscar for "The God
father."
In accepting an award for an
anti-war documentary in 1974,
producer Bert Schneider ex
pressed greetings to the Viet
Cong. Bob Hope was so upset
that he wrote a disclaimer
which Frank Sinatra read on
the telecast.
Hollywood (AP) — The movie
stars and the hangers-on
danced into the wee hours yes
terday at the Academy Ball —
celebrating Oscar's 50th birth
day and grumbling about Van
essa Redgrave's political out
burst.
While the British star's award
for supporting actress in
"Julia" was applauded, her ac
ceptance speech was booed.
The jeering began when she re
ferred to some of her critics as
"Zionist hoodlums."
"She insuted the Academy;
vve voted for her performance,
not her politics," snapped an
.actress who declined to be
identified.
"When you invite a re
volutionary to dinner, you're
going to get a speech,"
reasoned a producer.
Most officials declined to
enter the controversy. Howard
Koch, president of the
Academy, refused to com
ment, preferring to cite audi
ence ratings — "the biggest in
Academy history."
Emcee Bob Hope ducked out
after the telecast and didn't at
tend the ball.
An informal poll at the
$150-a-plate gala indicated
support for writer Paddy
Chayefsky's on-camera riposte
to Redgrave:
"I'm sick and tired of people
exploiting the occasion of the
Academy Awards for the prop
agation of their own personal
political propaganda. I would
like to suggest to Miss Red
grave that her winning an
Academy Award is not a pivotal
moment in history — does not
require a proclamation. A sim
ple 'thank you' would have suf
ficed."
The New York Post yesterday
quoted Chayefsky as saying:
"She tried to speak to me af
terward and I cut her dead. I
wanted to say more to the
worldwide audience, but the
hell with it, why make her the
martyr she wants to be?"
And, the Post quoted come
dian Alan King as saying, "I am
that Zionist hoodlum she was
talking about. It's just a pity I
wasn't on the platform ... I
would have gone for the jugu
lar."
