# Silver dollars to be sold
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — If you
yearn to own a dollar that has
increased in value instead of
depreciating, you may soon
have a chance to buy one from
the government.
In fact, something over one
million chances.
The General Services Ad
ministration, thegovernment's
housekeeping agency, wants
to dispose of what is left of a
hoard of silver dollars that was
discovered in the Treasury's
vaults in 1964 when silver coin
age was discontinued.
General Services Adminis
trator ]ay Solomon asked a
House banking subcommittee
Monday to approve legislation
that would simplify the pro
ceedings for selling the coins.
Although the coins are legal
tender, using them to pay the
rent is not advised. They're
worth far more than the value
stamped on their face.
Solomon said the GSA has
about 4200 silver dollars dated
1880, 19,000 dated 1881, and
31,500 dated 1885. Previous
sale c of coins of this type
brought minimum bids of $60
each.
There are also 195,000 coins
dated 1883 and 430,000 dated
1884, both of which previously

brought $30 bids when coins of
this type were offered. And
there are 300,000 coins of vari
ous years in less than perfect
condition. Coins of this type
previously sold for $15.
The earlier sales were made
undera complex procedure for
bids by mail. Existing law re
quires that this procedure be
followed in disposing of the
remainder, even though in
terest in buying the coins
under the old method appears
to have fallen off, Solomon
said.
The GSA proposes to offer
the remaining coins for sale at
fixed prices, probably at or
close to the previous minimum
bids, on a first come, first
served basis. There would be
no limitation on the amount of

1883 and 1884 coins a person
might buy, but there would
be a limit of up to 100 coins per
person in the 1880, 1881 and
1885 categories.
The dollars involved in the
past and future sales were pro
duced for only 13 years at the
Carson City, Nev. mint and
were designed by George
Morgan. They are known to
collectors as Morgan dollars.
It was long thought that th
ese, alongwithothersilverdol
lars, had been melted down
early in this century to meet
World War I demands for
silver.
But when Treasury stocks
were checked in 1964, nearly
three million coins, most of
them uncirculated Carson City
silver dollars, were discovered.
