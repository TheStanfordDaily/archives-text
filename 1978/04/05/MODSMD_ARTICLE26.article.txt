# Non-league efforts hold promise for Pac-8 slate
## Stanford carries 24-5 record; UCLA series opens conference play Friday 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford varsity baseball te am had a
single contest against UC-Davis postponed
yesterday due to heavy rains and bad road
conditions between here and D avis. The
game has been rescheduled for i his after
noon at 2:30 p.m. at Davis. Today's game
wraps up pre-season play for the Cardinal
nine as this coming weekend Stanford
faces UCLA in their first Pac-8 Southern
Division league series of 1978 here in Sun
ken Diamond.
The Cards have fared very well in pre
season play this year, as they did. last year,
running up 24 wins against only 5 losses
and one tie. In 1977, Stanford began
league play with 27 games in thii win col
umn and 5 in the loss, well on their way to
becoming the most winning team ever in
Stanford history with a total of '13.
Three of Stanford's five pre-soason los
ses came last week in the Riverside Tour
nament which turned out to be a bit of a
disappointment for both the Stanford
players and coaches. The Cards surren
dered to Washington State in their third
game of the tourney after pulling out two
tough overtime victories. The University
of Maine defeated Stanford and handed
freshman Paul Crame a loss in his first var
sity start. And Oral Roberts University
proved too much for the Cards downing

them 9-1 in the final round-robin matchup
of the tournament.
"We wanted to take the championship,
or at least get into the championship
game," remarked Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "We didn't pitch or hit
well but there is one positive thing ... we
didn't play well but we won four games."
Marquess doesn't expect the recent
flurry of losses to continue, however,
calling it "just one of those things that
happen."
Stanford's other two pre-season losses
occurred back in February over the
Washington's Birthday Holiday road trip.
Fresno State defeated the Cardinals 4-2
and 9-8 in a well-played twinbill in Fresno.
The Cards later beat the Bulldogs, 8-5, at
home, early in March. The rest of the pre
season contests have been Stanford vic
tories except for a 3-3 tie with UOP in a
game called after six innings on account of
darkness that was never made up.
Approaching league competition, the
Cardinals as a team are batting .284 and the
Stanford pitchers have a combined earned
run average of 2.82. Mike Codiroli and
Randy Wong lead the regular starters each
with a .340 batting average. Codiroli, the
Cardinal centerfielder, recently made the
All-tourney team in Riverside. Senior
Wong, who has been trading off with Tom

Guardino at the firstbase and designated
hitter positions has 23 RBI and three home
runs — one of which was a grand slam
which gave Stanford an 11-7 victory in
extra innings against Oregon State in the
Riverside Tournament.
Guardino currently leads the team in
several offensive categories including RBI
with 27 and homeruns with six while main
taining a .316 batting average. Meanwhile,
on the bases, junior Larry Reynolds has
successfully stolen 13 bases in 17 attempts
which is also equalled by Codiroli.
Defensively, the Cardinals have been
showy in pre-season play having turned 29
doubleplays and sporting a .965 fielding
percentage. The pitching has been the
mainstay of Stanford's defense thus far,
though, being provided by an experi
enced and enthusiastic bullpen staff.
Bruce Fiala, righthanded junior who re
cently pitched 9-1/3 scoreless innings in
the Riverside Tournament, has collected
six wins without a loss and has three saves
in his pre-season appearances. Brian Har
rison, after nine starts, has a 5-1 record,
Larry Kuhn's record stands at 4-0 even
though he leads the staff with 56-2/3 in
nings pitched thus far. Lefthander Rob
Irwin has a 3-1 record after sitting out the
first couple of weeks of the year with an
arm injury.

Marquess doesn't expect the recent
flurry of losses to continue, however,
calling it "just one of those things that
happen."
Stanford's other two pre-season losses
occurred back in February over the
Washington's Birthday Holiday road trip.
Fresno State defeated the Cardinals 4-2
and 9-8 in a well-played twinbill in Fresno.
The Cards later beat the Bulldogs, 8-5, at
home, early in March. The rest of the pre
season contests have been Stanford vic
tories except for a 3-3 tie with UOP in a
game called after six innings on account of
darkness that was never made up.
Approaching league competition, the
Cardinals as a team are batting .284 and the
Stanford pitchers have a combined earned
run average of 2.82. Mike Codiroli and
Randy Wong lead the regular starters each
with a .340 batting average. Codiroli, the
Cardinal centerfielder, recently made the
All-tourney team in Riverside. Senior
Wong, who has been trading off with Tom

Guardino at the firstbase and designated
hitter positions has 23 RBI and three home
runs — one of which was a grand slam
which gave Stanford an 11-7 victory in
extra innings against Oregon State in the
Riverside Tournament.
Guardino currently leads the team in
several offensive categories including RBI
with 27 and homeruns with six while main
taining a .316 batting average. Meanwhile,
on the bases, junior Larry Reynolds has
successfully stolen 13 bases in 17 attempts
which is also equalled by Codiroli.
Defensively, the Cardinals have been
showy in pre-season play having turned 29
doubleplays and sporting a .965 fielding
percentage. The pitching has been the
mainstay of Stanford's defense thus far,
though, being provided by an experi
enced and enthusiastic bullpen staff.
Bruce Fiala, righthanded junior who re
cently pitched 9-1/3 scoreless innings in
the Riverside Tournament, has collected
six wins without a loss and has three saves
in his pre-season appearances. Brian Har
rison, after nine starts, has a 5-1 record,
Larry Kuhn's record stands at 4-0 even
though he leads the staff with 56-2/3 in
nings pitched thus far. Lefthander Rob
Irwin has a 3-1 record after sitting out the
first couple of weeks of the year with an
arm injury.

Catcher Bruce Walters fire*, to pick off a would-be Pacific base th'ief. Walters, who had been injured
earlier this year, will be back in the lineup against UC-Davis today.
The Stanford varsity baseball te am had a
single contest against UC-Davis postponed
yesterday due to heavy rains and bad road
conditions between here and D avis. The
game has been rescheduled for i his after
noon at 2:30 p.m. at Davis. Today's game
wraps up pre-season play for the Cardinal
nine as this coming weekend Stanford
faces UCLA in their first Pac-8 Southern
Division league series of 1978 here in Sun
ken Diamond.
The Cards have fared very well in pre
season play this year, as they did. last year,
running up 24 wins against only 5 losses
and one tie. In 1977, Stanford began
league play with 27 games in thii win col
umn and 5 in the loss, well on their way to
becoming the most winning team ever in
Stanford history with a total of '13.
Three of Stanford's five pre-soason los
ses came last week in the Riverside Tour
nament which turned out to be a bit of a
disappointment for both the Stanford
players and coaches. The Cards surren
dered to Washington State in their third
game of the tourney after pulling out two
tough overtime victories. The University
of Maine defeated Stanford and handed
freshman Paul Crame a loss in his first var
sity start. And Oral Roberts University
proved too much for the Cards downing

them 9-1 in the final round-robin matchup
of the tournament.
"We wanted to take the championship,
or at least get into the championship
game," remarked Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "We didn't pitch or hit
well but there is one positive thing ... we
didn't play well but we won four games."
Marquess doesn't expect the recent
flurry of losses to continue, however,
