# Spikers face Bears in rematch
## 
### 
We already have the Big
Game, the Big Meet and the Big
Splash. And now there's the
Big Spike.
Division-leaders Stanford
and Cal clash tomorrow night
atB p.m. in Maples Pavilion in a
volleyball match which should
serve as a barometer for the
Northern California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Conference
tournament April 14 and 15 in
Berkeley.
"At the beginning of the sea
son I labeled Cal the confer
ence favorite," said Stanford
coach Art Lambert. "And I still
feel the same way. However,
we did not play well in our first
game with them, and we've
been improving since then."
In early March, Cal took the
Cards in a five-game match in
Berkeley, 15*7, 10-15, 16-14,
3-15, 15-9. That's the only con

ference loss for the Cards this
season.
Stanford is 8-0 in the confer
ence's Southern Division (10-7
overall) while the Bears are 6-0
in the Northern Division (9-5
overall). Both teams have al
ready qualified for the confer
ence's tournament which takes
the top teams from each divi
sion.
The Cards are coming off a
split in a pair of games in Los
Angeles.' Top-ranked USC
downed Stanford in three
straight games and then the
Cards edged out Loyola-
Marymount three games to
two.
"Although the Cal game
means little in the standings, a
win would give one of the
teams a bit of a psychological
edge heading into the tourna
ment," said Lambert.
