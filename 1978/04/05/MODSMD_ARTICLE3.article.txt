Washington (AP) — Millionaire rice
dealei Tongsun Park told House in
vestigators yesterday that despite the
implications of a report found in
Park's home, Speaker Thomas
O'Neill (D-Mass.) never asked him
for campaign contributions.
Park angrily complained that
someone is "trying to zing me," and
said, "Who knows who placed that
document in my house?"
And he repeated assertions that
while he gave hundreds of
thousands of dollars in campaign
contributions on request he never
did so as an agent of the Korean gov
ernment. He said he never tried to
use his contributions to "twist arms"
or buy influence.
The document mentioning
O'Neill's alleged requ st was seized
by federal agents in P/,rk's home last
year after Park !cfL the country for
Korea.
"He never made any request to
make any contribution to anyone,
including himself," Park said of
O'Neill. Park did acknowledge that
he paid for birthday parties for the
Massachusetts Democrat, including
one in 1974 which cost $4000.
The dotument found in Park's
home is hand-written in the Korean
language and purports to be a report
to Korean officials recommending
that they take certain actions to in
crease the effectiveness of a visit to
Korea of a U.S. congressional delega
tion. O'Neill headed the group of vis
iting congressmen.

The unsigned document stated
that many of the congressmen on the
trip had "contributed decisively" to
electing O'Neill as House majority
leader.
"And, therefore, Mr. O'Neill spec
ifically requested us to provide those
congressmen with election cam
paign funds and their wives with
necessary expenses," the document
said.
"This will be an ideal opportunity
to hand them the funds," it said. "But
should it be impossible, we recom

mend that you pay them in the near
future."
John Nields, chief counsel of the
House ethics committee, asked
Park: "Is that true?"
Park replied: "No."
O'Neill confirmed yesterday that
committee investigators have ques
tioned him about the note.
"I don't know who authored it,
where it was written, where it went
out or who exercised control over
it," O'Neill said. "I do know, how

ever, it is self-serving and a total fab
rication."
O'Neill said he never requested
funds from Tongsun Park or the
South Korean government. "The al
legation that I wished to reward a
limited group that helped elect me
majority leader is absurd — I had no
opposition and was elected unanim
ously."
Park complained that the federal
government violated his rights by
searching his home and office and
carting away documents.
