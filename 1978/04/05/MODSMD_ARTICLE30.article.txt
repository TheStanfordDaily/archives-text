### 
Two of water polo head coach Dante De
ttamanti's top five recruits have stated their in
tent to attend Stanford next fall.
Though letters of intent will not be received
until April 12, Dettamanti announced yesterday
that his No. 2 recruit, Chris Kelsey, and his No. 4
recruit, John Hendrickson, have expressed their
intent to play for the Cardinals next fall.
Kelsey, from Maricosta High School, is a
member of the Junior National team and is con
sidered by Dettamanti to be the second best
prep prospect in the country.
Hendrickson, who attends Bookser High
School, is "one of the top three players in
Northern California," said Dettamanti.
The other three recruits, Jody Campbell and

Bill Lobdell from Long Beach Wilson and Alan
Mouchawar from Long Beach Poly â€” have all
been accepted to Stanford but have not yet
made a final decision. Campbell, who has been
offered a full-ride scholarship from Cal, is a star
ter on the Junior National team and ranks as the
top high school player in the country, according
to Dettamanti.
Mouchawar, who has full ride offers from
numerous schools, is leaning toward Stanford,
Dettamanti said, but is reportedly hoping to get
a scholarship from the Cardinals.
"If Campbell chooses Cal," explained De
ttamanti, "then I'll probably give his scholarship
to Mouchawar. Realistically, I think we can get
four of the five guys. If we do, we'll have the top
frosh recruits in the country."
