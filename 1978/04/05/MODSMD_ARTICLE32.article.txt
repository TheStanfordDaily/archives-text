# Long preparation ends as crew starts racing

With the coming of spring quarter, many
intercollegiate sports begin. One may notice
people running about with rackets in their
hands, spikes in their shoes, or others with
mitts and chewing tobacco. But there is
another team that has been working out
since the beginning of fall, five to seven days
a week: The Stanford crew team.
Crew may not be a glamour sport where
graduates sign lucrative professional con
tracts, but nevertheless the required dedica
tion and teamwork are comparable to any
sport. The races match up 8-man shells in
2000 meter sprints. The boats require a crew
with strength, stamina and synchronization to
be successful. Depending on the conditions,
the boats usually average over five meters per
second.
In intercollegiate matches, Stanford will be
launching a varsity eight and four-man boat, a

Junior varsity eight, and two freshmen
eight-man boats. Sam Francis, coach of the
varsity team, expects to see six returning let
termen including team captain Jed Corlin.
Corlin said, "We have a tough race schedule,
but if we start out winning, I think we can
keep momentum and finish out the season
doing very well."
This year marked the best freshman turn
out ever, with close to 60 oarsmen and coxs
wain. Now only about 25 remain after a rigor
ous initiation. They are led by captain Tom
Hunt. Coach Miles White sees great potential
in the frosh and said, "We're definitely look
ing forward to beating Cal."
The first and only home race will be on
Saturday, April 8 at nearby Redwood Shores
in Belmont. Stanford will be hosting rivals
Oregon State, USC and Santa Clara in the
Conn Findlay Cup.

shell on the Bay. This year's team opens its season on Saturday with

their first and only home race at Redwood Shores in Belmont.
