I In the Pacific-8 Conference gymnastics
championships held just before exam
tveek, Oregon took team honors with a
■fatal of 426.80 points and California's War
iren Long won the all-around title with
Fl 07.95.
! The action in the Seattle meet was close
'in both the team and all-around competi
tion. Only 1.35 separated Oregon and
second-place Cal, while in the all-around
event, the top three individuals, including
Jim Kelch of Oregon and Mike Dubos of
Cal, were only .75 apart.
Stanford finished sixth out of the seven
teams entered. In Thursday's compulsory
meet, the Cardinals placed sixth with
176.95, and compiled 196.15 in the op
tional meet Friday night, good for fifth
place.

Stanford head coach Sadao Hamada
explained that the team total in optionals
was "our highest team score of the season.
We beat Washington State and USC and
came in right behind UCLA, so that was
really encouraging for our future."
Stanford's invididual performances
were highlighted by strong sho /ings in
floor exercise and pommel horse events.
In the preliminary competition, Steve
Waichler lead, while Ken Gorman placed
sixth. Chris Takimoto placed third in the
pommel horse preliminaries.
The individual finals, held Saturday
night, ended with Waichler and Gorman
placing fifth and ninth in floor exercise and
Takimoto finishing third on pommel
horse.
Takimoto qualified for the NCAA

championships slated for Thursday
through Saturday in Eugene, Oregon. His
success "all depends on how he does in
the compulsory competition. His optional
routine is good — he can score 9.6, not too
many people can score 9.6 — but his com
pulsory routine is weak. If he can score 9.3
and a 9.5 or 9.6 optional he can go to the
finals for sure," said Hamada.
Takimoto was working out at UCLA over
the break and will fly with Hamada to
Eugene today.
Another good showing in all-around
was given by Tad Bostick who compiled
99.45 points for eighth place. "He hit ev
erything pretty well. He was a little off, but
had no major mistakes. He scored 48.45 in
compulsories and 51.00 in optionals — I
think this is his career high so far,"
Hamada explained.
