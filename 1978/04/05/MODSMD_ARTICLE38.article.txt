Palestinian killers sentenced to hang
Nicosia, Cyprus — A court yesterday sentenced two
Palestinians to hang for the assassination of a prominent
Egyptian editor that led to a bloody gun battle between
Cypriot troops and Egyptian commandos.
The three-judge tribunal convicted Samir Mohammed
Khadar, 28, and Zayed Hussein al-Ali, 26, of premedi
tated murder and, over their protestations of innocence,
set their execution for June 1.
Defense attorney Lefcos Clerides announced he
would appeal, arguing that the death sentence had not
been carried out on this Mediterranean island for 10
years and therefore had been abolished "de facto."
The judicial process was completed rapidly in an
apparent attempt to mollify Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat. He broke diplomatic relations with Cyprus after
the Feb. 18 assassination of his close friend and confid
ant, Youssef el-Sebaei, and the deaths of 15 Egyptian
commandos the next day in a shootout at Cyprus' Lar
naca Airport, where the two Palestinians held hostages
in a plane.
House committee supports tax cut
Washington — The House Budget Committee voted
yesterday to recommend a $7.5 billion rollback in Social
Security taxes as part of an overall $20 billion tax cut. The
reduction would be $5 billion less in tax relief than Presi
dent Jimmy Carter had proposed.
The committee essentially adopted the proposal of its
chairman, Rep. Robert Giaimo (D-Conn.) on revenues
for the year beginning next Oct. 1.
Giaimo's proposal was designed to soften the blow of
the $227 billion, 10-year Social Security payroll tax in
crease Congress approved last year.
The committee agreed to his overall figures but voted
to leave room for alternatives to the specific Social Sec
urity tax changes that he advocated.
Burglary suspect linked to rapes
Los Angeles — A fingerprint from a 1976 "Pillowcase
Rapist" attack was linked to a man arrested trying to "fly
away" from a rooftop yesterday after a woman was tied
up in her home, police Capt. Matt Hunt said.
Yesterday's attack was thwarted when a teenage girl
"beat the living bejesus" out of her mother's assailant
with a golf club, said police Lt. Dan Cooke. As he fled the
man fell to the ground, flapping his arms like a bird,
while attempting to leap from the roof to the top of a
neighboring house, Cooke said.
"It's looking better all the time," said Hunt after Re
ginald Muldrew, 29, was booked for investigation of
burglary in the latest incident.
Police blame the Pillowcase Rapist for at least 162 rape
attacks since 1975 in the Los Angeles area, including 20
so far this year. Most of the rapes occurred in the city's
south-western section and southern suburbs, including
Inglewood, Gardena and Lynwood.
Oil companies heed Navajo protest
Montezuma Creek, Utah — Navajo tribal officials and
oil company executives pieced together yesterday a
proposal to offer about 100 rebellious Indians whose
sit-in has shut down private oil drilling in this corner of
the Navajo Reservation for six days.
The protestors say four oil companies drilling on
leased reservation land are guilty of discrimination in
hiring and are careless about the reservation's environ
ment.

They also argue with the tribal leadership that money
from the leases — millions of dollars a year — should go
to individual Indians living in the area rather than to the
tribe as a whole.
'Chicago 7' judge under fire again
Chicago — Nine years after he was widely criticized
during the Chicago 7 trial, 82-year-old Judge Julius
Hoffman is again stirring controversy — this time in the
trial of Frank Walus, who could lose his citizenship if it is
proven he was a World War II mass murderer.
At one point, the defense attorney accused the judge
of falling asleep in court. The judge has threatened the
lawyer with contempt citations.
And on Monday — before the defense started its case
— Hoffman denied a defense motion for acquittal by
saying the government's case "is clear and convincing
and unequivocal that the defendant did commit war
crimes, was a member of the Gestapo. . . and concealed
information when he obtained U.S. citizenship."
That prompted the Chicago Sun-Times to report in a
news story yesterday that "Hoffman all but declared him
guilty."
Mine workers ratify new contract
Washington — Striking mine construction workers
ratified a new contract yesterday and union officials said
most would return to their jobs today, ending a 120-day
walkout.
Sam Church, vice president of the United Mine Work
ers, said that with 35 out of 51 construction locals report
ing, the vote was 2306, or 64 per cent, for ratification and
1278, or 36 per cent, against the proposed accord.
S.F. Board votes homosexual rights
San Francisco — A new ordinance banning discrimina
tion against homosexuals in employment, housing and
public accommodations needs only the mayor's signa
ture before it takes effect in this city where an estimated
one in seven residents is gay.
The Board of Supervisors gave final approval to the
ordinance Monday on a 10-1 vote with no discussion,
adding San Francisco to a list of more than 40 cities that
have such ordinances on the books.
Mayor George Moscone is expected to sign the ordi
nance.
The ban is similar to one repealed last year in Miami
after singer Anita Bryant led a successful repeal cam
paign that brought gay rights to the nation's attention.
Dow Jones rises 4.33
New York — The stock market staged a quiet rally
yesterday, with a steadier showing by the dollar in
foreign exchange supplying some of the spark.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had
dropped 10.74 points in the three previous sessions,
rose 4.33 to 755.37.
Gainers held a 5-3 advantage over losers on the New
York Stock Exchange, and the exchange's composite
common-stock index climbed .22 to 49.66.
Today's Weather
Increasing clouds and chance of rain today. Rain likely

for westerly winds 15 to 25 mph. Continued cool. Lows
mostly 40s. Highs 50s and lower 60s both days. Chance of
