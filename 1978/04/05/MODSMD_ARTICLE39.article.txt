# Campus YWCA stock divestment action receives regional backing
## 
### Joel Dickholtz Amy Davidson 
The Stanford YWCA, which voted
on March 8 to divest itself of stock in
American corporations with South
African business investments, has
received support of its action from
YWCAs throughout the western Un
ited States.
The support came at the YWCA
Western Regional Conference held
last week, where 200 representatives
voted to bring the issue before a na
tional convention.
"The ball is rolling now," said
Susan Tilson, director of the Stanford
branch.
She explained that the Stanford
YWCA has an endowment of approx
imately $100,000, 40 per cent of
which is presently invested in a
mutual fund. Analysis of the stocks
held in that fund as of )anuary 31 re
vealed that 34 per cent of the YWCA's
mutual fund ownership was in com
panies with direct South African in
vestment.
Before voting on the divestment
issue, Stanford YWCA board of di
rectors heard a panel of speakers
discuss two possible alternatives: di
vestment and reform through re
sponsible investment.
The speakers were Robert
Hamerton-Kelly, dean of the Memo
rial Church, who was born and raised
in South Africa; Kim McCall, a senior
in philosophy who spent two years as
a missionary in South Africa; and
Jeanne Hendrickse, a black South Af
rican citizen who is currently a doc
toral student in theology at San Fran
cisco Theological Seminary.
Hamerton-Kelly argued for an end
to apartheid through continued in
vestment in South Africa and
through the use of proxy votes and
stockholder involvement.

He stated that black workers
would be the first to suffer economi
cally if foreign firms withdrew, and
that much good might be ac
complished if these firms were pe -
suaded to instead take positive ac
tion.
McCall, who spoke on behalf of
Stanford Committee for Responsible
Investment Policy (SCRIP), pointed
out that substantive changes on the
part of American firms to improve
the conditions of black workers
would be in violation of South Afri
can law.
He further noted that black South
Africans themselves were urging
withdrawal of American corpora
tions as the best means of ending
apartheid. He added that corporate

pressure from within South Africa
had proved ineffective.
Hendrickse pleaded with the
YWCA board to listen to the requests
of black South Africans.
"The government has tried to di
vide us," Hendrickse said, "but we
speak with one voice, and we say to
you, get out of South Africa. Vou will
help us most by leaving. Yes, in the
short run there will be increased
hardship, but you must understand
that we are quite willing to undergo
that hardship. We are not looking for
band-aids. We want our full human
rights and human dignity restored."
A lengthy discussion followed the
presentation, after which the board
voted. Divestiture was approved by
an almost two-to-one margin.
