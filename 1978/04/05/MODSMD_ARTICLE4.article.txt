# Carter tentatively nixes neutron bomb

Washington (AP) â€” President Jimmy Carter has tenta
tively decided against production of the neutron bomb,
a weapon designed to kill enemy troops with radiation
while limiting destruction of the surroundings.
There was no indication of a change in his thinking
after talks yesterday with a West German diplomat who
wants the weapon in the NATO arsenal in case of Soviet
tank attack on Western Europe.
Carter conferred yesterday with West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who arrived earlier in
the day to press his government's support for produc
tion of neutron weapons.
"All these questions are subject to consultation within
the alliance," Genscher told reporters after a prior meet
ing with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance.
Vance, who accompanied Genscher to separate meet
ings with Carter and his national security adviser, Zbig
niew Brzezinski, said afterward that Carter had made no
decision on the neutron bomb.
But, Vance added, "I should think in the not too dis
tant future that we should be able 'o make a decision."

It was understood, however, that Carter's tentative
decision was relayed to Bonn late last week through
Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
Genscher's visit was hurriedly arranged in a final effort
by the West Germans to persuade Carter to modify his
decision.
State Department officials said privately that Carter
probably would make a final decision after his meeting
with Genscher but that it would not be announced for
several days.
Supporters of the weapon have said they would prefer
that Carter defer any decision rather than rule against
production.
The New York Times, quoting unidentified administ
ration officials, reported yesterday that Carter had de
cided against production o' the weapon despite con
trary advice from most of his senior foreign policy advis
ers.
The newspaper said Carter hoped the Soviet Union
would respond by showing restraint in deploying new
nuclear weapons.
