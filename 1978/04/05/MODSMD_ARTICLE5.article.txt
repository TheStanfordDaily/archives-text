# Senate approves $1700 for Disorientation Week
## 
### Sara Lessley 
The SOC slate of the ASSU Senate
voted to give $1700 to the SOC
sponsored Disorientation Week last
night as seven non-SOC senators
walked out on the roll call.
The vote was called 1 % hours after
debate began. Final count was 13 to
0, with 12 SOC senators and Alter
nate Sen. Lamar Nelson voting. Nel
son, who has attended few Senate
meetings, appeared at the end of the
evening.
The Stanford Organizing Commit
tee (SOC), is a "coalition of progres
sives," according to members. The
slate holds a majority in the senate.
The issue did not concern the
"worthiness" of the week of
scheduled events, according to the
SOC resolution's opponents, but the
amount of money being requested.
Disorientation Week, sponsored
by SOC and other campus organiza
tions, will be a series of workshops,
panels, films and other activities with
a "left of the middle of the road"
bent, according to one senator.
Disorientation Week is being or
ganized in conjunction with various
SOC groups, ASSU and SWOPSI,
and it is soliciting support from vari
ous campus sources. The entire
budget is estimated to be $11,000.
Discretionary fund
The $1700 will come from the se
nate discretionary fund, which was
increased to $4000 at the start of the
year. Currently the fund contains
$2500. Historically the discretionary
fund has been $1500.
Sen. Doug Bandow said he ob
jected to the $1700 because more
than 40 per cent of the entire dis
cretionary fund would be spent on
one project.
Calling the project a "very good
activity," Sen. Tom McCormack also

objected to the amount of money.
The senate divided into two camps
as the issue became more and more
political.
Senate chairperson Fred Crethel,
an SOC member, said the problem
was that the opposition senators
"can't seem to transcend their initial
belief that SOC is bad" and therefore
anything it proposes must be bad
also.
Sen. Lynn Rubinett, also an SOC
member, said SOC would not com
promise and lower the amount
A move to reduce the amount to

$1000 was defeated 12 to seven. The
nay votes came entirely from SOC
members.
Sen. Rick Levy said the amount of
money was justified because the
events will interest a broad range of
students. Fellow SOC member Sen.
Nick Valenzuela agreed.
Valenzuela said the issue was not
that SOC was voting for the proposal
and non-SOC members were not.
Instead, he said, the point is that
more than 85 per cent of funds for
the week are being gathered from
