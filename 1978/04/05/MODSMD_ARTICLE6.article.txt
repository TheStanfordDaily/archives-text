### Andrea James 
The so-called "Stanford amend
ment," which would assure that
medical schools could charge pro
fessional fees for services rendered
by faculty physicians, is being
"amended out," according to a legis
lative spokesperson and University
personnel.
A staff person from the office of
Assemblyman Lawrence Kapiloff
(D-San Diego), confirmed yesterday
that the amendment is no longer an
active part of the original legislative
bill, AB 1781.
According to the staff person, the
amendment is being dropped be
cause "its provisions are not perti
nent to the original purpose of the
bill."
Reportedly, the bill's original pur
pose was to revise the Clinic Act and
exempt educational institutions from
licensing requirements.

Since its original introduction sev
eral months ago, the bill has been
amended at least five times, said
Spyros Andreopoulos of the Medical
Center News Bureau.
Dr. Robert Weinmann, president
of the Union of American Physicians
(UAP) Local 7402, said earlier this
week the amendment was written by
Stanford counsel "in order to make
the University's billing procedures
legal."
Carl Hitchner, associate staff
counsel for the Medical Center, said
the dying amendment was designed
to "clarify" Section 2008 of the
California Business Code which
states in part that "schools and in
stitutions may make no charge for
professional services rendered pa
tients."
Andreopoulos said the University
will continue to "seek the law's
clarification through other means."
