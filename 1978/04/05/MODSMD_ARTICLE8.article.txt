# Toward a secure world

On November 3, 1977, the former Prime Minister of
Sweden, Olof Palme, gave a lecture at the University on
"Disarmament and Development." He argued that
transferring funds and labor from the military to de
velopment is critical if we are to avoid destruction, or the
increasing misery of the poorest countries.
But the U.S. public seems unwilling to call for disar
mament for development. Their reason is that we must
safeguard the U.S. — we do not plan on attacking any
one, but we must defend ourselves against the com
munists or numerous Third World countries. It is time
we address the basis of this fear of attack. Disarmament
can be possible only when the causes of these concerns
are resolved.
We fear the communists because they have a socio
economic system that depends heavily on bureaucratic
government control. The people are not responsible for
communist policy; they are ordered and kept in line by
their governments.
We fear the communists may wish to destroy us to
take away the example of democracy, even though li
mited, which the western countries present. Or they
may need our resources, or those of countries that favor
us. They may desire to control those other countries, to
spread communist political power against the democra
tic example.
I believe we have to strengthen the economic systems
in the U.S. and the communist countries so that the
threat of economic decline will not inspire bureaucratic,
military dominance.
We must assure people of a means of support which
will be stable in the long-term future. This means we
must not run short of resources, for this raises prices.
We should maximize conversion to renewable re
sources and systems. For instance, we must maximize
the use of solar energy.
Nuclear energy is also a renewable resource, but it is
not a renewable system, as the large amounts of radia
tion likely to be released by accidents or terrorism would
irreversibly damage the genetic biosystems of which
we are a part.
If people are assured of a virtually unlimited energy
supply, which will be almost free once we pay for the
collecting equipment, and stable supplies of other re
sources through conservation and recycling, they will be
more likely to be democratic, because making a living
will be easier.
We must also encourage strong family-planning prog
rams, with a goal of zero population growth (ZPG) as fast
as possible, for economic gains can be negated by popu
lation growth.
Reducing frustration
I strongly believe that smaller families would reduce
the amount of frustration, poverty, and crime among the
U.S.'s lower classes. Those poor families with fewer
children would set an example in terms of standard of
living to those with large families, provided there were
adequate social security and employment.
But we are not willing to spend the comparatively
small sum to provide birth control as witnessed by the
cutoff of federal funds for abortion for the poor. Of
course, the morally offensive act of abortion would not
be necessary if we provided enough funds for pre
gnancy prevention.
The poor must limit their numbers before an expan
sion of equality can occur; now, the success of the poor
is limited by burdens of children to feed. We should
encourage our "enemies" to achieve ZPC.
We should, in addition, realize that international en

vironmental problems can be a source of conflict. The
world-wide drought is doubtless being accelerated by
the unrestricted extraction of water from the earth, and
by allowing this water to wash away quickly to the sea,
—because there are fewer plants to hold moisture in
the soil;
—water runs quickly off concrete;
—used water is contaminated beyond reuse by sewers
(which have dissolved auto emissions from streets),
pipes, and sewage or industrial wastes, and then
dumped into bodies which lead to the sea.
To ensure an adequate water supply, we must stop
wasting water, and not mix relatively clean water with
contaminants but recycle it onto the ground or purify it
for recycled drinking water. We can find better ways to
dispose of wastes — many wastes can be used for fuel
and even fertilizer, and other wastes should be reduced
and protectively isolated.
Threatened by insecurity
Next, let me turn to the threat from Third World coun
tries. Their threat comes from their economic insecurity
also. They are way below us in their standard of living
and feel resentful. We must help them, not arm ourse
lves against them. The U.S. also spends large sums on
arms aid to Third World countries to get them on our
side — but we could reduce this and offer them more
useful things.
We should help them to adopt safe alternative energy
sources, to safeguard the water supply, and to limit their
populations. Costa Rica, Taiwan, and South Korea are
developing faster and more equitably than many other
countries due to their efforts at population control and
providing jobs for the poor.
Imagine what they could do with more U.S. popula
tion and technical aid. The countries that would accept
our aid and start far-reaching programs.
I believe population control should have first priority
in our aid to developing nations. Some people in the
developing countries would limit their families right
away, while the remainder would wait until examples
overcame their suspicion of this new policy, or until
economic conditions improved. Getting these conditions
improved would be much easier if everyone who
wanted to limit their families could do so.
Fear competition
Perhaps we fear the development of developing coun
tries because we do not want them to compete with
American production. But if we produced more wisely,
and required less resources and consumption, we
would not need to fear competition for our "privileged"
place in the world. Wemust help produce a stable world
economic system.
Palme noted that a major obstacle to reducing the
military is fears of unemployment. But civilian produc
tion is much more labor-intensive than the military. I
might add that another strategy for reducing un
employment and increasing equality, supported by
population biologist Paul EhrTich, is to gradually reduce
working hours for those in higher-paying occupations.
We could also help the unemployed in the U.S. and
other countries to start gardens, which would help the
world food shortage.
In summary, we must begin development for disar
mament. I feel I have dealt here with more facets of our
world crises than is usual. If anyone disagrees with these
hypotheses, I suggest they experiment and test them.
The best way to maintain our quality of life is to take
these steps to reduce the terrible threat of war.
