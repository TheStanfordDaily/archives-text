# Good nutrition and what Mikey says

Taking advice on how to eat from
Colonel Sanders is like taking les
sons on how to be well-liked from
Richard Nixon. Yet the current trend
in how we eat seems to conform to
those foods advocated by such nutri
tion experts as Mikey, The Frito Ban
dito, Rodney Allen Rippey, and oh
yes, let's not forget the jolly old Col
onel.
Food manufacturers are actively
working tochannel our food prefer
ences toward those processed foods
that mean dollarsignstothem. There
is no quirk to the fact that the pro
ducts food manufacturers spend the
most money on in advertising cam
paigns, are the same products that
violate the "Dietary Goals For The
United States" established by the
Senate Committee On Nutrition And
Human Needs. These manufacturers
advocated reduced consumption of
meat, total dietary fat, cholesterol,
sugar, and salt with an increase in

consumption of fresh fruits, fresh
vegetables, and other foods high in
dietary fiber.
An increase in nutritional aware
ness is of paramount importance in
dealing with this deluge of profit
oriented products. This is especially
true in many lower income com
munities where resources are ex
tremely limited. In a home where 40
per cent of the income is spent on
food the importance of spending re
sources as wisely as possible to get
the most out of the dollar is all but
too clear.
Fad diets can be as harmful to the
consumer as the high fat, high sugar
content, highly processed diet that
most Americans adhere to today. The
difference between the "health
foods" pushed by many health food
stores and the empty calorie pro
ducts sold by the traditional food
stores is often minimal. Such pro
ducts merely create a new market to

be exploited at the expense of the
uninformed.
The fact that brown sugar is no
thing but the same table sugar you
usually eat with a little molasses
thrown in for coloring and flavor is
not explained by many manufactur
ers that proclaim brown sugar as a
vastly more nutritious product than
table sugar. But why should they? IT
SELLS!
It is not simply an irony that the
amount of money spent on advertis
ing for food products is inversely
proportional to their total nutritional
value. ! t is not coincidental that the
price of fresh produce rose dispro
portionately when compared to the
price increase of its more highly re
fined (more expensive to produce)
canned and frozen counterparts.
Nutrition in and of itself is a very
simple matter. The corner stone of a
balanced diet is variety. Cement
that into place by emphasizing

moderation, and you are on your
way to better eating. If you educate
yourself to the simple ideas of good
eating, you can separate fake from
fact, and determine what is good for
you.
In this interest a course entitled
"Nutrition, Health and the Black
Community" will be taught this quar
ter, through the African and Afro-
American Studies Department.
The basic rules of nutrition will be
addressed in the first half of the
course. This ground work will pro
vide the catalyst for guest lecturers to
examine how those rules specifically
apply to the black community.
This will hopefully provide a start
ing point to increase our understand
ing of nutrition and alter the course
set for us by food processers.
