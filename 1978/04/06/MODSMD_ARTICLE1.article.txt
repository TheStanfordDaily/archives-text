# Students try to block SOC expenditure
## 
### Sara Lessley 
Several ASSU senators and other
students opposed to the $1700 ap
propriation for Disorientation Week
passed by the senate's Stanford Or
ganizing Committee (SOC) slate
Tuesday have begun circulating a
petition to annul the senate's act.
Calling the action a "blatant power
play," the petition's author, Andy
Lundberg, said "over 40 per cent of
the total discretionary fund allocated
to one cause and one that the voting
senators are intimately involved with
is a breach of faith" with the student
body.
Seven senators walked out during
the roll call vote on the act.
According to the ASSU Constitu
tion, the "membership of the As
sociation" (all students) has the
power to annul any senate act with
the signatures of 5 per cent of the
student body calling for an election
on the act in question. About 600 sig
natures are necessary in this case.
Senate Chairperson Fred Grethel,
a SOC member, called the attitude of
those initiating the referendum "ab
surd."
Also involved in the petition seek
ing to annul the senate act are
Senators Tom McCormack, Steve
Buckley and Doug Bandow.
Sen. Lynn Rubinett, also a SOC
member, commented, "This is about
the first time we (SOC) all voted to
gether as a bloc . . . because we
honestly thought it was a good thing
. . . the backlash is amazing."
Co-president Greg Larson, speak
ing for himself, said that "if a number
of SOC senators aren't willing to
promise to make a compromise" on
the amount of money appropriated
he would push for a COP veto.
A COP veto of the senate action is
possible. However, a veto can be
overriden by 11 senators, and SOC
holds a senate majority.
