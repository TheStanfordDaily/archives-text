# Urban renewal warmed over

President Carter recently unveiled
his urban policy and there is some
good news and some bad news. The
good news is that Carter has finally
proposed some programs, such as
direct financing of neighborhood
groups, which are long overdue.
The bad news is that Carter's policy
confirms what many urban experts
feared: Washington doesn't really
know any more than the rest of us
when it comes to solving the prob
lems of our cities.
In announcing his urban policy,
Carter made it clear that he was more
interested in revising current urban
programs, than in proposing any
large-scale new ones. To quote his
policy paper, "The bottom line of the
Carter approach is to make better
use of what we already have on the
books."
Thus, Carter has offered the states
additional $200 million a year,
provided they can demonstrate their
willingness to spend it on distressed
cities. There is little in the form of
additional money for social services
and mass transit.
And for existing housing prog
rams, Carter has proposed a meager
$150 million, an amount which, as
one sarcastic editorial in the Wall
Street journal pointed out, ". . . will
buy a dog house and a bird house for
every town and city in America. .
But it is interesting that the bulk of
Carter's urban package relies heavily
on private investment. There are
specific provisions for the establish
ment of a national development
bank which would guarantee up to
$11 billion in loans to private busi
ness as an inducement to invest in
distressed city areas.
In addition, the Carter administra
tion has offered to raise the current
10 per cent investment tax credit
another 5 per cent, thereby making it
even more attractive for business to

locate or remain in decaying urban
districts.
However, Carter's emphasis on
the private investment aspect of the
urban solution is not surprising. Sev
eral months ago, I had the opportun
ity to talk with an Assistant Secretary
for HUD who had been put in charge
of that agency's efforts to rehabilitate
New York's dismal South Bronx area.
If this country's decayed urban
areas have reached the point where
even realistic amounts of Federal
money are futile, then Carter clearly
has no choice but to turn to the busi

ness sector tor help. But it may take
years for private enterprise to re
spond, and time is rapidly running
out.
As the unemployment rate for
central city minorities continues t6
climb, big city mayors are casting
worried glances at the calendar. The
hot days of summer are just around
the corner and, like many of this
country's distressed cities, Carter's
dreams of urban revitalization may
just go up in smoke.
