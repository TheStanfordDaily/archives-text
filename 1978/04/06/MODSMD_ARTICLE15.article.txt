# Raubitschek combines husband, children, career
## 
### Jill Liscom 
"I am not a 'liberated'
female," claimed 63-year-old
Art History Professor Isabelle
Raubitschek. "My husband
comes first and I go where he
goes. Next comes the children
and then comes my career. I
think that's the only possible
solution."
Being a woman has not hin
dered her progress, however.
"I have been able to ac
complish all I've wanted to,
just maybe not with the same
intensity," she added.
The white-haired woman
leaned forward, resting her el
bows on her tidy desk. Despite
her warm smile, gleaming blue
eyes partially hidden by
pointed glasses, and gentle,
grandmotherly appearance,
she spoke with strong convic
tions.
"My husband is very, very
helpful, my children are
cooperative and that's the only
way this can work out," she
explained.
Family
Her husband, Antony, is a
professor in the Classics de
partment here. She has tour
children, three of whom are
married, and the fourth who is
planning to marry in April.
Mrs. Raubitschek and her
husband moved to California
from Princeton in 196 5 when
he was offered a teaching posi
tion at Stanford. Mrs

Raubitschek served as Chair
man of the Archeology De
partment at San Francisco State
University until 1966, when she
became a lecturer in ancient art
here.
Mrs. Raubitschek said she
likes Northern California very
much because of "the general
openness of it. I began to feel a
little suffocated by Princeton."
She laughed as she recalled
how someone had onde said
that at Princeton the "cultural
density" was so great. "I guess
the cultural density is much
less out here," she added.
Fond students
Mrs. Raubitschek said she
enjoys her students here "tre
mendously" and her students
obviously are very fond of her.
"Isabelle Raubitschek is one
of my very favorite teachers.
She is a very, very strong
woman and very noble. I have a
tremendous respect for her,"
commented one student.
Another student said, "She's
very friendly and interested in
what her students aredoing. In
some instances of people get
ting ill, she's been very
motherly almost, and very un
derstanding." Mrs.
Raubitschek herself, however,
is not in good health.
"In spite of illness of a seri
ous nature, she doesn't miss
any classes and doesn't miss
any office hours," said Art Pro
fessor Albert Elsen. "I don't

know anyone who puts as
much of themselves into so
many different things. None of
my colleagues surpass her in
standards of excellency."
"It's unfortunate more
people don't take my classes,
but I'm pleased to have a wide
range of students from physi
cists to engineers, whom you
don't expect to see in an an
cient art history course," Mrs.
Raubitschek commented.
Ancient architecture
Mrs. Raubitschek's specialty
is ancient architecture, but her
scholarship extends beyond it.
Currently she is publishing the
bronzes found at the American
excavation at Isthmia in
Greece. Isthmia is the inter
national sanctuary near
Corinth of the ancient Creek
god Poseidon.
Mrs. Raubitschek and her
husband took a two quarter
leave from Stanford last year to
be in Corinth, and they plan to
return there this summer for
further work. Studying the
bronze pots is "proving both
exciting and frustrating. They
are turning out to be from all
over the Mediterranean, not
just from Corinth, as had been
assumed."
Mrs. Raubitschek reads
many foreign languages in
cluding both Ancient and
Modern Greek, Latin, Italian,
French and German. She
began to study most of these

languages as a child. She said
she firmly believes students
should learn languages when
they are young.
Knowledge of foreign lan
guages is a necessary tool for
everyone, Mrs. Raubitschek
said. "We're becoming so insu
lated in the United States be
cause of lack of languages."
Extensive education
Mrs. Raubitschek was born
in Boston, Massachusetts, and
raised on the East Coast. Her
extensive education includes
an A.B. at Barnard College (a
women's college associated
with Columbia University), and
a Ph.D. in Art and Archeology
from Columbia University.
"In between times I studied
in Paris and at the American
School for Classical Archeol
ogy in Athens," she added.
Mrs. Raubitschek said she
wanted to be an archeologist
since she was eight years old.
Her parents amused her on
Sundays by looking with her at
newspaper reports on the
latest finds in Tutankhamen's
tomb.
She went to a girls' Latin
school in Boston and then to a
public high school where she
"had a wonderful Creek his
tory teacher."
Benefit mankind
In college, she majored in
classics, "Except I got pangs of
conscientiousness because I
wanted to do something to be

nefit mankind. So for one year I
took pre-med courses and lost
40 pounds; I couldn't eat any
thing because everything smel
led of formaldehyde," she
said.
Mrs. Raubitschek has been
teaching for 38 years. Before
coming to Stanford she taught
Creek and Creek art at Alberus
Magnus College in New Haven
and was an instructor in Latin
and Roman art at Miss Fine's
School for women in Princeton
while her husband was a pro
fessor at Princeton University.
Mrs. Raubitschek's outside
interests are limited, she said,
because "work and my family
are the only things I have time
for." However, she enjoys
music and playing the piano,
"although I have little to play
any more," she said.
"My only disappointment
with my children is that not one
of them turned out to be a
musician," Mrs. Raubitschek
admitted, even though she
started teaching them to play
the piano at age three.
Her oldest son is a patent at
torney; her eldest daughter is a
certified mid wife and "an ad
ministrator, Heaven help us!";
her other daughter is a
psycho-linguist; and her
youngest child, a son, will be
getting his M.D. from Univer
sity of California at San Fran
cisco and his Ph.D. from UC-
Berkeley in )une.

"They're all doing interest
ing things, but the only one
who is following in our
footsteps we had to acquire by
marriage," Mrs. Raubitschek
said with a grin. Her son-in-law
is Curator of Ancient Art at the
Toledo Museum. "They got an
overdose of classical archeol
ogy at home."
Mrs. Raubitschek said she
also used to enjoy sailing as a
girl, but finally gave up the
sport about eight years ago
when she and her son capsized
when they ran into a sand bar
in San Francisco Bay and had to
be rescued by a helicopter.
"The next day the article
came out on the front page of
the Palo Alto Times and I had

people I had never met asking
me about the Incident. It was
so embarrassing," she recal
led.
Mrs. Raubitschek said she
loves to swim, and one reason
she and her husband chose
their house on Embarcadero
Rd. in Palo Alto is because it is
near a public swimming pool.
According to Mrs.
Raubitschek, she sees the most
rewarding aspect of her career
as "a matter of having made a
small contriburion to per
petuate the classical tradition,
both by teaching and prepar
ing students and by my own
scholarly work. I really believe
in it, you know."

Isabelle Rauhitschek is ,1 warm and respec led professor of art history
here. This quarter she is teaching classes on the Greek theater and on
Roman and Etruscan art. She is the wife of Classics Prof. Antony
Raubitschek.
"I am not a 'liberated'
female," claimed 63-year-old
Art History Professor Isabelle
Raubitschek. "My husband
comes first and I go where he
goes. Next comes the children
and then comes my career. I
think that's the only possible
solution."
Being a woman has not hin
dered her progress, however.
"I have been able to ac
complish all I've wanted to,
just maybe not with the same
intensity," she added.
The white-haired woman
leaned forward, resting her el
bows on her tidy desk. Despite
her warm smile, gleaming blue
eyes partially hidden by
pointed glasses, and gentle,
grandmotherly appearance,
she spoke with strong convic
tions.
"My husband is very, very
helpful, my children are
cooperative and that's the only
way this can work out," she
explained.
Family
Her husband, Antony, is a
professor in the Classics de
partment here. She has tour
children, three of whom are
married, and the fourth who is
planning to marry in April.
Mrs. Raubitschek and her
husband moved to California
from Princeton in 196 5 when
he was offered a teaching posi
tion at Stanford. Mrs

Raubitschek served as Chair
man of the Archeology De
partment at San Francisco State
University until 1966, when she
became a lecturer in ancient art
here.
Mrs. Raubitschek said she
likes Northern California very
much because of "the general
openness of it. I began to feel a
little suffocated by Princeton."
She laughed as she recalled
how someone had onde said
that at Princeton the "cultural
density" was so great. "I guess
the cultural density is much
less out here," she added.
Fond students
Mrs. Raubitschek said she
enjoys her students here "tre
mendously" and her students
obviously are very fond of her.
"Isabelle Raubitschek is one
of my very favorite teachers.
She is a very, very strong
woman and very noble. I have a
tremendous respect for her,"
commented one student.
Another student said, "She's
very friendly and interested in
what her students aredoing. In
some instances of people get
ting ill, she's been very
motherly almost, and very un
derstanding." Mrs.
Raubitschek herself, however,
is not in good health.
"In spite of illness of a seri
ous nature, she doesn't miss
any classes and doesn't miss
any office hours," said Art Pro
fessor Albert Elsen. "I don't

know anyone who puts as
much of themselves into so
many different things. None of
my colleagues surpass her in
standards of excellency."
"It's unfortunate more
people don't take my classes,
but I'm pleased to have a wide
range of students from physi
cists to engineers, whom you
don't expect to see in an an
cient art history course," Mrs.
Raubitschek commented.
Ancient architecture
Mrs. Raubitschek's specialty
is ancient architecture, but her
scholarship extends beyond it.
Currently she is publishing the
bronzes found at the American
excavation at Isthmia in
Greece. Isthmia is the inter
national sanctuary near
Corinth of the ancient Creek
god Poseidon.
Mrs. Raubitschek and her
husband took a two quarter
leave from Stanford last year to
be in Corinth, and they plan to
return there this summer for
further work. Studying the
bronze pots is "proving both
exciting and frustrating. They
are turning out to be from all
over the Mediterranean, not
just from Corinth, as had been
assumed."
Mrs. Raubitschek reads
many foreign languages in
cluding both Ancient and
Modern Greek, Latin, Italian,
French and German. She
began to study most of these

languages as a child. She said
she firmly believes students
should learn languages when
they are young.
Knowledge of foreign lan
guages is a necessary tool for
everyone, Mrs. Raubitschek
said. "We're becoming so insu
lated in the United States be
cause of lack of languages."
Extensive education
Mrs. Raubitschek was born
in Boston, Massachusetts, and
raised on the East Coast. Her
extensive education includes
an A.B. at Barnard College (a
women's college associated
with Columbia University), and
a Ph.D. in Art and Archeology
from Columbia University.
"In between times I studied
in Paris and at the American
School for Classical Archeol
ogy in Athens," she added.
Mrs. Raubitschek said she
wanted to be an archeologist
since she was eight years old.
Her parents amused her on
Sundays by looking with her at
newspaper reports on the
latest finds in Tutankhamen's
tomb.
She went to a girls' Latin
school in Boston and then to a
public high school where she
"had a wonderful Creek his
tory teacher."
Benefit mankind
In college, she majored in
classics, "Except I got pangs of
conscientiousness because I
wanted to do something to be

nefit mankind. So for one year I
took pre-med courses and lost
40 pounds; I couldn't eat any
thing because everything smel
led of formaldehyde," she
said.
Mrs. Raubitschek has been
teaching for 38 years. Before
coming to Stanford she taught
Creek and Creek art at Alberus
Magnus College in New Haven
and was an instructor in Latin
and Roman art at Miss Fine's
School for women in Princeton
while her husband was a pro
fessor at Princeton University.
Mrs. Raubitschek's outside
interests are limited, she said,
because "work and my family
are the only things I have time
for." However, she enjoys
music and playing the piano,
"although I have little to play
any more," she said.
"My only disappointment
with my children is that not one
of them turned out to be a
musician," Mrs. Raubitschek
admitted, even though she
started teaching them to play
the piano at age three.
Her oldest son is a patent at
torney; her eldest daughter is a
certified mid wife and "an ad
ministrator, Heaven help us!";
her other daughter is a
psycho-linguist; and her
youngest child, a son, will be
getting his M.D. from Univer
sity of California at San Fran
cisco and his Ph.D. from UC-
Berkeley in )une.

"They're all doing interest
ing things, but the only one
who is following in our
footsteps we had to acquire by
marriage," Mrs. Raubitschek
said with a grin. Her son-in-law
is Curator of Ancient Art at the
Toledo Museum. "They got an
overdose of classical archeol
ogy at home."
Mrs. Raubitschek said she
also used to enjoy sailing as a
girl, but finally gave up the
sport about eight years ago
when she and her son capsized
when they ran into a sand bar
in San Francisco Bay and had to
be rescued by a helicopter.
"The next day the article
came out on the front page of
the Palo Alto Times and I had

people I had never met asking

cisco and his Ph.D. from UC-
Berkeley in )une.

"They're all doing interest
ing things, but the only one
who is following in our
footsteps we had to acquire by
marriage," Mrs. Raubitschek
said with a grin. Her son-in-law
is Curator of Ancient Art at the
Toledo Museum. "They got an
overdose of classical archeol
ogy at home."
Mrs. Raubitschek said she
also used to enjoy sailing as a
girl, but finally gave up the
sport about eight years ago
when she and her son capsized
when they ran into a sand bar
in San Francisco Bay and had to
be rescued by a helicopter.
"The next day the article
came out on the front page of
the Palo Alto Times and I had

people I had never met asking
me about the Incident. It was
so embarrassing," she recal
led.
Mrs. Raubitschek said she
loves to swim, and one reason
she and her husband chose
their house on Embarcadero
Rd. in Palo Alto is because it is
near a public swimming pool.
According to Mrs.
Raubitschek, she sees the most
rewarding aspect of her career
as "a matter of having made a
small contriburion to per
petuate the classical tradition,
both by teaching and prepar
ing students and by my own
scholarly work. I really believe
in it, you know."

Isabelle Rauhitschek is ,1 warm and respec led professor of art history
here. This quarter she is teaching classes on the Greek theater and on
Roman and Etruscan art. She is the wife of Classics Prof. Antony
Raubitschek.
"I am not a 'liberated'
female," claimed 63-year-old
Art History Professor Isabelle
Raubitschek. "My husband
comes first and I go where he
goes. Next comes the children
and then comes my career. I
think that's the only possible
solution."
Being a woman has not hin
dered her progress, however.
"I have been able to ac
complish all I've wanted to,
just maybe not with the same
intensity," she added.
The white-haired woman
leaned forward, resting her el
bows on her tidy desk. Despite
her warm smile, gleaming blue
eyes partially hidden by
pointed glasses, and gentle,
grandmotherly appearance,
she spoke with strong convic
tions.
"My husband is very, very
helpful, my children are
cooperative and that's the only
way this can work out," she
explained.
Family
Her husband, Antony, is a
professor in the Classics de
partment here. She has tour
children, three of whom are
married, and the fourth who is
planning to marry in April.
Mrs. Raubitschek and her
husband moved to California
from Princeton in 196 5 when
he was offered a teaching posi
tion at Stanford. Mrs

Raubitschek served as Chair
man of the Archeology De
partment at San Francisco State
University until 1966, when she
became a lecturer in ancient art
here.
Mrs. Raubitschek said she
likes Northern California very
much because of "the general
openness of it. I began to feel a
little suffocated by Princeton."
She laughed as she recalled
how someone had onde said
that at Princeton the "cultural
density" was so great. "I guess
the cultural density is much
less out here," she added.
Fond students
Mrs. Raubitschek said she
enjoys her students here "tre
mendously" and her students
obviously are very fond of her.
"Isabelle Raubitschek is one
of my very favorite teachers.
She is a very, very strong
woman and very noble. I have a
tremendous respect for her,"
commented one student.
Another student said, "She's
very friendly and interested in
what her students aredoing. In
some instances of people get
ting ill, she's been very
motherly almost, and very un
derstanding." Mrs.
Raubitschek herself, however,
is not in good health.
"In spite of illness of a seri
ous nature, she doesn't miss
any classes and doesn't miss
any office hours," said Art Pro
fessor Albert Elsen. "I don't

know anyone who puts as
much of themselves into so
many different things. None of
my colleagues surpass her in
standards of excellency."
"It's unfortunate more
people don't take my classes,
but I'm pleased to have a wide
range of students from physi
cists to engineers, whom you
don't expect to see in an an
cient art history course," Mrs.
Raubitschek commented.
Ancient architecture
Mrs. Raubitschek's specialty
is ancient architecture, but her
scholarship extends beyond it.
Currently she is publishing the
bronzes found at the American
excavation at Isthmia in
Greece. Isthmia is the inter
national sanctuary near
Corinth of the ancient Creek
god Poseidon.
Mrs. Raubitschek and her
husband took a two quarter
leave from Stanford last year to
be in Corinth, and they plan to
return there this summer for
further work. Studying the
bronze pots is "proving both
exciting and frustrating. They
are turning out to be from all
over the Mediterranean, not
just from Corinth, as had been
assumed."
Mrs. Raubitschek reads
many foreign languages in
cluding both Ancient and
Modern Greek, Latin, Italian,
French and German. She
began to study most of these

languages as a child. She said
she firmly believes students
should learn languages when
they are young.
Knowledge of foreign lan
guages is a necessary tool for
everyone, Mrs. Raubitschek
said. "We're becoming so insu
lated in the United States be
cause of lack of languages."
Extensive education
Mrs. Raubitschek was born
in Boston, Massachusetts, and
raised on the East Coast. Her
extensive education includes
an A.B. at Barnard College (a
women's college associated
with Columbia University), and
a Ph.D. in Art and Archeology
from Columbia University.
"In between times I studied
in Paris and at the American
School for Classical Archeol
ogy in Athens," she added.
Mrs. Raubitschek said she
wanted to be an archeologist
since she was eight years old.
Her parents amused her on
Sundays by looking with her at
newspaper reports on the
latest finds in Tutankhamen's
tomb.
She went to a girls' Latin
school in Boston and then to a
public high school where she
"had a wonderful Creek his
tory teacher."
Benefit mankind
In college, she majored in
classics, "Except I got pangs of
conscientiousness because I
wanted to do something to be

nefit mankind. So for one year I
took pre-med courses and lost
40 pounds; I couldn't eat any
thing because everything smel
led of formaldehyde," she
said.
Mrs. Raubitschek has been
teaching for 38 years. Before
coming to Stanford she taught
Creek and Creek art at Alberus
Magnus College in New Haven
and was an instructor in Latin
and Roman art at Miss Fine's
School for women in Princeton
while her husband was a pro
fessor at Princeton University.
Mrs. Raubitschek's outside
interests are limited, she said,
because "work and my family
are the only things I have time
for." However, she enjoys
music and playing the piano,
"although I have little to play
any more," she said.
"My only disappointment
with my children is that not one
of them turned out to be a
musician," Mrs. Raubitschek
admitted, even though she
started teaching them to play
the piano at age three.
Her oldest son is a patent at
torney; her eldest daughter is a
certified mid wife and "an ad
ministrator, Heaven help us!";
her other daughter is a
psycho-linguist; and her
youngest child, a son, will be
getting his M.D. from Univer
sity of California at San Fran
cisco and his Ph.D. from UC-
Berkeley in )une.
