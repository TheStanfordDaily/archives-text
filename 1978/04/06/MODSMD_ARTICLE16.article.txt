# Authoritative Americanist chairs program
## International relations professor breaks new ground 
### Philip Lane 
Though he's done it before,
David Michael Kennedy is once
again breaking new ground.
Since September, he has
chaired the rapidly growing In
ternational Relations Program
here—a unique circumstance
for an American history
specialist.
Kennedy's professional cre
dentials are impeccable. "One
of the most promising Ameri
can historians" is how Halsey
Royden, dean of Humanities
and Sciences, describes this
56-year-old associate professor
of history.
Kennedy's first book, "Birth
Control in America: The
Career of Margaret Sanger"
(Yale Press, 1970), brought his
instant acclaim as well as the
prestigious Shea and Bancroft
prizes for historical scholar
ship.
Americanist
Why was an Americanist,
even a good one, offered the
international relations chair?
Royden said: "I've often won
dered about that myself." He
said that "people in the prog
ram" chose to offer Kennedy
the chair, after political science
professor Robert Keohane vac
ated it last year for a sabbatical
leave.
Kennedy says he accepted
the offer because his overseas
experience last year drew him
into international affairs. He
taught a three quarter "focus
program" with English profes
sor Martin Evans on cross
cultural perception and adap
tation at the Florence campus
in 1976-77. The pair also taught
overseas in 1972-7 J.
"Europe is so much an inter
national place. You're exposed
to a multitude of differen!
nationalities simply by living
there," he explained in an in
terview. "Even the Palo Alto
Times now has front page
stories on the dollar value," he
grinned.

The development of Ken
nedy's Margaret Sanger study
displayed the same sort of ex
panding interests that led Ken
nedy into international rela
tions. Originally focused on
the life ot this birth-control
pioneer, the book departed
from a narrow biographic track
to become a broad study of the
societal impact and implica
tions of birth control.
Kennedy's current research,
for a book provisionally enti
tled "Over Here: World War I
and American Society," hasn't
escaped revision either. He
now plans to add chapters on
the international economic ef
fects of the war before the
work is published next year.
Change has also charac
terized Kennedy's relations
with students over the years.
"With age, you inevitably get
more distant from students in
personal terms," he said. But
other interests, such as scho
larship and family now demand
increasing amounts of Ken
nedy's time. "I don't particu
larly regret it,"he added.
Excellent lecturer
His reputation for teaching
certainly hasn't suffered. Jim
Melamed, a psychology senior
in one of Kennedy's classes,
echoed common opinion
when he described Kennedy as
"an excellent lecturer, and a
great organizer of masses of
material."
Kennedy's approach to
teaching has upset some stu
dents, who have called him
"arrogant" and "intimidating."
He suspects that his authorita
tive teaching style — which he
terms "as definite as possible"
— may arouse such feelings.
But he adds, "I like to think
there's a difference between
being authoritative and au
thoritarian."
Charismatic
Unlike some professors,
Kennedy leaves a charismatic
personal impression. His

wire-rim glasses are the only
academic hint on a trim, athle
tic figure; a coworker termed
him a "snappy dresser." With
feet propped on a table and
hands behind head, he talked
to this reporter with equal
animation about his career, his
wife |udy, their three children,
his wine-tasting and his fish
ing. "In my next life," he
smiles, "I want to bean expedi
tion guide for tly fishermen."
English professor Martin
Evans, Associate Dean of
Humanities and Sciences,
team-taught a wine-tasting
course with Kennedy in Italy.
In response to Kennedy's label
for the team as "comrades of
the bottle," Evans responded
that they were "comrades of all
kinds."
Evans called Kennedy "one
of the most humanistic histo
rians I know,"and agreed that
his flexibility is an asset. "Ken
nedy taught a course on Henry
James that I thought was
supurb — that any English
teacher would have been
proud of." High praise for an
historian.
Kennedy's connection with
the overseas campuses began
long before his team teaching

with Evans. As a Stanford
sophomore, he was among the
first group of students to study
in Florence in 1963. There he
met history professor Wayne
Vucinich, who Kennedy credits
with first directing his interests
into American studies.
"I used to engage in polite
proselytism," says Vucinich
now. "I tried to talk to the stu
dents, to give them some di
rection." But in one area at
least, Kennedy needed none.
"He went over to Italy with a
purpose — and came home
after two quarters speaking
fluent Italian."
Kennedy graduated from
Stanford with honors in His
tory, then traveled east to Yale
to earn his M.A. in 1964 and his
Ph.D. in 1968 in American
Studies. He turned down a Yale
job to join the faculty here in
1967. He received tenure in
1972.
Currently, integration of the
overseas courses with the in
ternational relations program
is one of Kennedy's goals,
along with creating more struc
ture and improved sequencing
in the home campus I.R. prog
ram. Kennedy wants increased
emphasis on "first-world"

studies to balance what he sees
as a slant in current course of
ferings towards the developing
world.
"The trade relations of North
America, Europe, and Japan
are the international center of
gravity," and deserve more
courses, he said. "There's vir
tually no-one on this campus
who can tell you about U.S.-
Canada relations — and they're
our biggest trading partner."
Mark Mancall, Director of
the Overseas Studies Prog
rams, said that "when the con
cept of area studies developed,
it was concerned primarily with
third world studies." He said
he does not feel that the cur
rent curriculum is lopsided to
ward the third world, but he
agrees that "there ought to be"
more European studies em
phasis.
David Kennedy will hold the
international relations chair for
two or three years before it
goes to someone else. Where
his evolving interests will take
him after that is anyone's
guess, but if his track record is
any indicator, it's a safe bet
he'll remain as popular a
teacher as he's been since
coming to Stanford.

department. Although he is charismatic, his teaching style can be
described as "authoritative."
