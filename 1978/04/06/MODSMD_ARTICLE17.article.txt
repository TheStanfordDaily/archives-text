# 'On Photography' book review
## Photography's anesthetizing effect discussed 
### Tony Back 
A dependence on inter
changes between image and
reality is one of the characteris
tics that define a "modern"
society. Television, cinema
and most importantly, the
photograph bombard us with
images — and these influences
are the object of Susan Son
tag's concern in a collection of
essays entitled "On Photo
graphy."
Lively and provocative, "On

Photography" is far from the
pedantic excursion into
esoterica that those lacking in
curiosity will predict. I will
concede that a cosmic aura
might surround this critique of
the moral and esthetic prob
lems raised by the presence
and authority of the photo
graphic image, but a more
specific discussion will make
the subject more tangible.
The book is not a critique of
specific photographers; it con

tains not a single photograph.
The relationship between
image and our perception of
reality is the real subject.
"In teaching us a new visual
code, photographs alter and
enlarge our notions of what is
worth looking at and what we
have a right to observe. They
are a grammar and, even more
importantly, an ethics of se
eing."
Photographs have become a
way of certifying experience,
and even further, a device for
experiencing something, for
giving an appearance of par
ticipation. An experience be
comes equivalent to a photo
graph taken of it.
Time and death
Another of Sontag's con
cerns are the endearing effects
of time and death. She notes
that old daguerroeotypes ac
quire importance simply be
cause of their age; likewise,
Diane Arbus' suicide lent

drama to her portraits, as if
they had been dangerous.
Photography disassembles
reality; details are fixed forever
in a click — "an endlessly allur
ing, poignantly reductive way
of dealing with the world."
But, Sontag continues, life is
not about a magnification of
details. In this fragmentation,
ideals of beauty are chal
lenged. Edward Weston found
intense beauty in his toilet
bowl.
Some of these observations
may seem obvious, particularly
to photographers (for in
stance, the prejudices built
into the composition of a
photograph), but Sontag
penetrates the cliches with deft
insight. The correlation she re
veals between Chinese culture
and their use of the photo
graphic image, always posed,
never fragmentary close-ups,
is a fascinating introduction to
the aims of politics.

Sontag affirms Marshall
McLuhan: the medium is the
message. The image is subor
dinate to its context: folds of
cloth increase in interest and
beauty because the cloth is ac -
tually a cabbage leaf. I his
"wrenching things from tlu>ir
context . . . bringing things to
gether elliptic ally, according to
the imperious but often arbit
rary demands of subjectivity,"
Sontag contends. There is no
morality.
The most disturbing facet of
photography, in Sontag's view,
is its ability to anesthetize, "For
Photographic images tend to
subtract feeling from some
thing we experience first hand
and the feeling they arouse
are, largely, not those we have
in real life."
Certainly the most ambitious
critiqueof photography ever, it
deserves a thoughtful read, it
only for the questions it will
raise.

specific discussion will make
the subject more tangible.
The book is not a critique of
specific photographers; it con

tains not a single photograph.
The relationship between
image and our perception of
reality is the real subject.
"In teaching us a new visual
code, photographs alter and
enlarge our notions of what is
worth looking at and what we
have a right to observe. They
are a grammar and, even more
importantly, an ethics of se
eing."
Photographs have become a
way of certifying experience,
and even further, a device for
experiencing something, for
giving an appearance of par
ticipation. An experience be
comes equivalent to a photo
graph taken of it.
Time and death
Another of Sontag's con
cerns are the endearing effects
of time and death. She notes
that old daguerroeotypes ac
quire importance simply be
cause of their age; likewise,
Diane Arbus' suicide lent

drama to her portraits, as if
they had been dangerous.
Photography disassembles
reality; details are fixed forever
in a click — "an endlessly allur
ing, poignantly reductive way
of dealing with the world."
But, Sontag continues, life is
not about a magnification of
details. In this fragmentation,
ideals of beauty are chal
lenged. Edward Weston found
intense beauty in his toilet
bowl.
Some of these observations
may seem obvious, particularly
to photographers (for in
stance, the prejudices built
into the composition of a
photograph), but Sontag
penetrates the cliches with deft
insight. The correlation she re
veals between Chinese culture
and their use of the photo
graphic image, always posed,
never fragmentary close-ups,
is a fascinating introduction to
the aims of politics.

Sontag affirms Marshall
McLuhan: the medium is the
message. The image is subor
dinate to its context: folds of
cloth increase in interest and
beauty because the cloth is ac -
tually a cabbage leaf. I his
"wrenching things from tlu>ir
context . . . bringing things to
gether elliptic ally, according to
the imperious but often arbit
rary demands of subjectivity,"
Sontag contends. There is no
morality.
The most disturbing facet of
photography, in Sontag's view,
is its ability to anesthetize, "For
Photographic images tend to
subtract feeling from some
thing we experience first hand
and the feeling they arouse
are, largely, not those we have
in real life."
Certainly the most ambitious
critiqueof photography ever, it
deserves a thoughtful read, it
only for the questions it will
raise.
