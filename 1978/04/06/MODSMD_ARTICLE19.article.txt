# Unruh: 'still young enough to wait'

"It's like being a flat of mus
hrooms— they keep you in the
dark and then once in a while
someone comes in and throws
a bucket of crap on you."
If Jesse Unruh's description
of his job as state treasurer
doesn't tell you he's got a mind
of his own, his influential his
tory in California state politics
will.
As Speaker of the Assembly
from 1961 to 1969, when he was
ousted in a Republican
takeover, "Big Daddy" jesse
Unruh was the unquestioned
power behind the California
Democratic party.
I;p the early 1960s Unruh
brought in young staff to con
duct research and change the
"g9od old boy" atmosphere of
the legislature. But during that
time some staff became as
powerful as the politicians who
employed them, and they
began writing bills, arranging
hearings and lining up votes.
As "Big Daddy," Unruh
groomed Kenneth Cory, now
Sta&e Controller, for a promis
ing political career.
Wnruh lost to Reagan in a
bid for governor and was
elected State Treasurer in 1974.
who at one time
wejghed in at over 300 pounds,
would still make a good Santa.
HK thick face and head and
looming barrel of a body give
him the ability to physically
dominate almost anyone.
Unruh makes no secret of his
displeasure with )erry Brown's

politics.
"First of all, there is no
Democratic party in this state,"
he said. "Whatever little there
was was snuffed out by Jerry."
But Unruh is realistic about
his relationship with the gov
ernor.
"He doesn't have a hell of a
lot that I want," he said. "I
don't have to act. I'm not look
ing for any appointments."
With political campaigning
gearing up for the June 6
primaries, Unruh lashes out at
one of his pet peeves — cam
paign financing.
Unruh compared the cam
paign financing atmosphere to
an ancient game of competitive
potlatch.
"One fellow rips off his coat
and rips it to shreds with his
knife and then the other guy
rips off his coat and shirt and
rips it to shreds with his knife.
And then it gets to the point
when one has to kill his wife to
prove that he is willing to sac
rifice more than the other," he
said.
Unruh is not happy with in
consistencies of "proper cam
paign financing." He said one
state legislator was elected
with $50,000 from a single bus
iness and was considered
bought out, while it went un
questioned when one legis
lator supported his campaign
through money from his
grandfather.
"It doesn't make any differ
ence that they ripped that
money off from people selling

junky CM cars," he said. "If it's
one generation removed, it's
OK."
Unruh said, campaign
financing disclosure is, in
theory, supposed to cure all
illnesses of campaign corrup
tion, but that people really
don't pay much attention to
who finances whom.
He added that people aren't
prepared to pay the cost of
publicly'financed elections.
"They somehow have the
very naive belief that they
aren't already paying for it,"he
said.
One of the most compelling
reasons for public financing of
elections is that it constitutes
the greatest curb on political
corruption, Unruh said. He
singled out the press as being
everything but a curb on politi
cal corruption.
"Political corruption only
gets uncovered by the press
when it becomes popular," he
said. "They only uncovered
Watergate when a politician
got fed up and decided to feed
information to them."
Unruh explained he is no fan
of the media.
"The media own this country
lock, stock and barrel and
more's the pity," he said. "The
most successful politicians are
the ones who know how to
manipulate the media."
But Unruh said the media
has become very fickle and will
descend on a politician for no
particular reason.
"Can you imagine what the

furor would have been and
what the catastrophic effect
would have been if Bert Lance
had been a million dollar con
tributor to Jimmy Carter's
campaign?" he asked.
For all his criticisms of the
political system and the media,
Unruh isn't about to bail out.
"I think Winston Churchill
once upon a time said there is
no other life as exciting as the
legislative branch of govern
ment except the front lines in
the trenches, and I think that's
true," he said.
However, Unruh hinted he is
not completely content to live
out his political career as trea
surer. As he put it, "I'm still
young enough to wait and old
enough to be patient."
