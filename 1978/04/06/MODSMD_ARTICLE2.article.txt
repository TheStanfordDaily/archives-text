# Democratic caucus votes for Social Security tax decrease
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” House Democrats voted yesterday
to reduce Social Security tax hikes that go into effect
next year and to use income tax revenues to save the
retirement system from bankruptcy.
The 150 to 57 vote by the caucus is not binding on the
regular legislative committees. But it puts pressure on
the Democrats who control and dominate those com
mittees to push for the changes. Democrats control the
House by a 2 to 1 margin.
Congress last year voted Social Security tax increases
to bring in an additional $227 billion over the 10 years
beginning in 1979. The increases, aimed at keeping the
system financially solvent, would be particularly high for
employees in the upper earnings brackets and for their
employers.
The caucus vote came one day after the House budget
committee voted to make room in its tentative financial
plan for the year beginning Oct. 1 for a $7.5 billion cut in
Social Security taxes.
The resolution adopted by the Democratic caucus
does not specify any dollar amounts but does put
Democrats on record as favoring "the use of general
revenue funds to finance a portion of the Social Security
system with appropriate reductions in Social Security
payroll taxes."

The caucus resolution calls on Democratic members
of the House Ways and Means Committee to prepare
legislation as soon as possible. This legislation would
determine how much of a reduction in Social Security
taxes would be made and how much general treasury
revenues would be shifted to pay Social Security costs.
Despite the caucus action, any change likely faces
opposition from several sources.
Even as House Democrats were debating the ques
tion, Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal urged
Congress not to change Social Security taxes this year.
"We do not believe that there is any urgent need in
view of the president's income tax cut proposals that this
be done this year," Blumenthal said, referring to Car
ter's proposal to partially offset the Social Security tax
hikes by reducing income taxes # .
White House spokesman Jody Powell also said the
president opposes reopening the Social Security bill,
saying "He thinks it would be a mistake to reopen an
extremely complicated matter like this at this point."
Powell noted that the administration proposed using
general treasury revenues to fund Social Security prog
rams last year but that Congress rejected this approach,
opting instead for the increased payroll taxes.
