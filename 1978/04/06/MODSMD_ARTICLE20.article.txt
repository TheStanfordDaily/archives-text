# Doctors find diarrhea prevention

Boston (AP) â€”Doctors report that regular
doses of a seldom-used antibiotic can pre
vent Montezuma's Revenge, the perennial
intestinal affliction of tourists in underde
veloped lands
The researchers said the drug can give
most people at least one month's protec
tion against the unpleasant malady, also
known as Delhi Belly, or simply traveler's
diarrhea.
They predicted that the drug, called
dojtycycline, will be routinely prescribed
for Americans who travel to underde
veloped parts of the Middle East, South
America, Africa and Asia.
The drug was tested on Peace Corps

volunteers in Kenya by doctors from Bal
timore City Hospitals. Their findings were
published in today's issue of the New Eng
land journal of Medicine.
Dr. R. Bradley Sack, one of the resear
chers, said Americans have a 50 to 60 per
cent chance of getting traveler's diarrhea if
they go to countries where it is prevalent.
"This is the first drug that has really been
shown to be highly effective," Sack said in
an interview. Several drugs currently in
use are said to help ease the symptoms of
diarrhea once it strikes.
The doctors gave doxycycline to 18
American volunteers for three weeks, and
only one of them contracted the illness.

Another 21 people got inactive pills, called
placebos, and nine of them became sick.
The protection lasted for one week after
the medication stopped, but then it wore
off, they said.
The volunteers took one pill a day, and
the researchers cautioned doctors against
prescribing the drug for longer than three
weeks until more tests are done.
Doxycycline is a form of tetracycline, a
commonly used drug. It is sometimes
used to treat cholera and Rocky Mountain
spotted fever.
Sack said the medicine fights a disease
causing variety of the common micros
copic organism called Escherichia coli.
