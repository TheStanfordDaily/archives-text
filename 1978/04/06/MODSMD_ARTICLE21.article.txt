## Anorexia starves women 
### Jo Harshbarger-Clark 
Thin may be in, but a bizarre disease known as
anorexia nervosa, literally, "loss of appetite due
to nerves," which causes young women to vol
untarily starve themselves is not cool.
Anorexia nervosa is a psychological disorder
which primarily affects women between the
ages of 14 and 25. Most come from affluent and
educated families that tend to be success-,
achievement- and appearance-oriented.
These general criterion of the typical anorexic
person match the stereotypical standards of a
Stanford woman. Based on this information,
Stanford women comprise a portion of the risk
population of anorexia nervosa.
According to Dr. Stewart Agras, a specialist in
the treatment of anorexia nervosa here, there
has been a rapid increase of anorexic women at
Stanford.
Agras feels that anorexia nervosa is a "bad
name" for the disease. He says that "patients do
not really experience a loss of appetite but an
aversion to food which makes them starve
themselves."
Agras has treated patients who have lost
nearly one-half of their total body weight. He
said this "devastating weight loss is the chief
symptom of the condition and one that should
be dealt with as soon as possible."
Aside from treating the grotesque emaciation
of the illness, doctors must also deal with the
patient's serious psychological disturbances
which caused the weight loss.
Fears trigger disease
The causes of the disorder are not well de
fined. Most psychiatrists and doctors agree,
however, that the illness reflects intense fears
that the patient faces as she matures.
The first menstrual period is believed to be a
sign of approaching adulthood for a young wo
man. Afraid to face adult responsibilities, the
anorexic focuses on extreme dieting to de
monstrate self-control.
In fact, any event that the young woman per
ceives as a major challenge, such as leaving
home for college, may cause her to seek a solu
tion by extreme dieting.
And it is quite possible that the enormous
emphasis on slimness in our society may be
partially responsible for the increased incidence
of anorexia nervosa.
Symptoms outlined
Though no specific cause of the disease has
been discovered, the behavior of the anorexic is
fairly consistent in all cases. Some of the
symptoms include a denial of hunger, excessive
exercising, eating binges followed by removal of

food through self-induced vomiting and laxa
tives.
One 18-year-old woman here suffered a se
vere case of anorexia nervosa which led to hos
pitalization and she missed a year of school.
She recalled some of her experiences during
her illness.
"I would do almost anything to avoid eating. If
a friend asked me to eat dinner in her dorm, I
would say that I planned to eat with my room
mate. When my roommate wanted to eat with
me, I would tell her that I was going to eat with a
friend. Really though, I would go to the library
and have a Tab for dinner.
"I would also go on occasional eating binges
when I ate anything I could find — cookies,
cake, candy. Then I would feel so guilty and fat
about eating that I would make myself sick. The
next day I wouldn't eat anything, sort of a
punishment for porking out the day before."
Last year an athletic and vivacious Stanford
freshman dropped from her ideal weight of 135
pounds to 98 pounds and also dropped out of
most social and athletic activities.
Laxatives remove guilt
"I wanted to be thin really bad so I started
exercising more and eating less," she said. "I
kept a secret diary of my weight and diet and lied
about how much I weighed if people seemed
concerned that I was too thin.
"Sometimes I would eat a whole lot — I ate a
whole gallon of ice cream once — then take
laxatives to get the food out of me. I exercised
constantly without admitting to being tired so
that I would lose more weight."
Behind all these signs and symptoms lies a
"distorted body image" in which the women
who appear emaciated insist that they are fat and
must lose more weight. This "imaginary fat" is
what causes the dieting, vomiting, exercise and
so forth.
Treatment for the anorexic is twofold. First,
the patients must put the weight back on to get
them out of medical danger. Then the underly
ing emotional problems must be reached
through psychotherapy.
Dr. Agras advocates a behavior modification
approach to treatment. When the patient eats
well and gains weight she is rewarded. Accord
ing to Agras, a vital element in treatment is to
reassure her that she will not become fat once
she begins to eat, and that someone will warn
her if she goes above her ideal weight.
He describes his treatment as "reasonably
successful" but feels that complete recovery is
sometimes impossible because of the complex
ity of the disease.
