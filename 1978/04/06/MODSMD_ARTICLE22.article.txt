London (AP) — Princess Mar
garet, whose cavorting with a
would-be rock star has brought
demands that she renounce
her royal rights, stayed out of
sight in Windsor Castle Wed
nesday, missing the church
confirmation of her 13-year-old
daughter.
Officially, the 47-year-old
sister of Queen Elizabeth II had
the flu.
Newspapers say the queen
has ordered Margaret to give
up brewery heir and singer
Roddy Llewellyn, 30, or with
draw from public life.
The queen was said to be dis

tressed that the relationship
with Llewellyn, which included
a recent trip to the Caribbean,
is damaging the royal image.
Members of Parliament ar
gued about the princess, amid
public speculation that the
government might slash Mar
garet's $95,000 tax-free allo
wance because of the affair.
She missed the confirmation
into the Church of England of
her 13-year-old daughter, Lady
Sarah Armstrong-Jones, and
three children of other royalty.
A statement from Margaret's
Kensington Palace home said:
"Against her personal wishes
but on the strict advice of her
doctors, Princess Margaret was
prevented from attending the
service."
Margaret's estranged hus
band, Lord Snowdon, who was
photographer Anthony

Armstrong-Jones before he as
sumed his royal title, was at the
ceremony in St. George's
Chapel adjoining Windsor Cas
tle where Archbishop of Can
terbury Donald Coggan con
firmed the children into the
Church of England. Sixteen
members of the royal family,
including the queen, attended
the private ceremony.
Margaret has had a cold
since she returned last month
from the Caribbean with
Llewellyn.
Llewellyn was in London
Wednesday, choosing songs
for an album to launch his new
career as a pop singer.
Prime Minister James Cal
laghan has his regular weekly
audience with the queen this
week, which could lead to a
statement on Margaret's fu
ture.

The princess is one of 11
members of the royal family
who share $4.51 million a year
from the government.
There is a possibility an in
crease in the total amount will
be announced Friday, causing
some interest in what Mar
garet's share would be in light
of demands that her allowance
be cut.
The allowances officially are
paid to enable members of the
royal family to carry out public
engagements and critics say
Margaret's share of such func
tions has declined sharply dur
ing her attachment to Llewel
lyn. She had 115 official en
gagements last year and only
nine so far this year.
Besides her allowance, the
princess lives rent-free at No.
