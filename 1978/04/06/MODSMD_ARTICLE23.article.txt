# UC Board of Regents votes to join investment research firm
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) —The Uni
versity of California Board of
Regents voted March 17 to
subscribe to a research organi
zation that will provide infor
mation on how money is spent
by companies in which UC may
invest.
A proposal that the board
join the Investor Responsibility
Research Center at a cost of
$6700 fdr a one-year trial—a
proposal defeated several
times previously—had been in
troduced by a special commit
tee on social responsibility in
investments.
The social responsibility
committee was appointed last

September after years of stu
dent protest, much of it pro
voked recently by UC's in
vestments in South Africa. The
board has refused to withdraw
the university's $449 million in
stocks of companies doing
business there.
Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally in
troduced a motion that the
board meet in special session
this month to discuss the South
African investment issue, but
the proposal was overwhelm
ingly defeated.
About 12 members of the
Students Against Apartheid at
tended the session at the Los
Angeles Convention Center on
Friday, March 17, but did not

address the board. Nearly 100
protestors marched outside,
some carrying signs reading
"Christians Against Apar
theid," "U.S. Out of Africa" or
"Stop Corporate Exploitation."
On Thursday, March 16, the
board discussed the special
committee's recommendation
that an advisory council on in
vestments be created to re
commend action when a cor
poration in which UC invests
"appears to be in violation of
fundamental social and moral
considerations."
Action on that and other
proposed changes in invest
ment policy was put off until a
later meeting.
