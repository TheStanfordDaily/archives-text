When I returned to my office
after vacation sporting a tan
and being generally cheerful, I
found the mail on my desk
stacked higher than the Trans
America building. Release after
release, after message, after
publicity photo. The office
looked like a recycling station
and there was nothing to do
but separate the stuff that was
really going to be recycled
from that which I actually in
tended to read. After wading
through it all, I finally found
out what's happening here this
week. First, two quasi
entertainment events.
If you've never seen Ulti
mate Frisbee your chance of a
lifetime is coming this Friday
and Saturday. Stanford will
host the Western National Ul
timate Frisbee Championships
on the athletic fields near the
stadium. Ultimate Frisbee is
sort of a game of mass chicken
with a frisbee that is traveling
about 90 mph. Real good for
your fingers.

Trivia experts will try their
brains at the annual Trivia Bowl
held in Tresidder next week.
Forget the broad concepts
your professors told you were
the important part of the
course. They won't do you any
good in this contest. The insig
nificant and the unimportant
become vital.
The Lively Arts is bringing
three groups here right off.
First, on Friday in Memorial
Auditorium, the New York
ChamberSoloistswill perform.
They have been around for as
long as I am old which is a tes
tament to their popularity.
They will play Bach's six Bran
denburg Concerti.
Next, on Sunday afternoon
the Beaux Arts Trio will be at
Dinkelspiel. Violin, cello and
piano combine for Hayden's
Trio in A, Shostakovich's Trio,
Op. 67 and Shubert's (guess
what) Trio, Op. 100. They will
also be giving a master's class
that evening in Kresge which is
free to Stanford students.
Finally, next week Wednes
day through Friday, the Paul
Taylor Dance Company will be
here. There will be a free
lecture-demonstration on
Wednesday at 8 p.m. in Memo
rial Auditorium and perfor
mances follow on Thursday
and Friday. They have been on
the modern dance scene for
over 20 years now.
Films, films, films, films,

films, films. The Law School
will show "Woman of the
Year" this Friday. Kate Hep
burn marries Spencer Tracy.
Both are correspondents for
the same newspaper and she is
woman of the year. The theme
is husband versus career wife.
It should be funny.

There's also "Running
Fence" on Friday at Cubberley,
if you like movies about
fences. (See preview this
page.)
"King Kong" is the Chappie
offering this Saturday. This is
the new version. It's a little
sexier, the World Trade Center
is substituted for the Empire
State Building, and it costs ten
times more than the original.
The Sunday Flicks is showing
"Cousin, Cousine," an in
teresting portrait of platonic
love that everyone else in the
movie assumes is not platonic.

Next week is Francois Truf
faut week. On Monday the
Stanford Film Society shows
"Jules et )im." Jules and |im
become friends before World
War I. Then they fight on op

posite sides. Later they come
together again, jules marries
Catherine. Jim gets to know
her with Jules' blessing, but
there is an inevitable strain on
the relationships among the
three. It is a "sensitive, impas
sioned and absorbing" work, a
reputable source has said.
On Wednesday the French
Film series is showing Truf
faut's "The Story of Adele H."
at Bishop. Truffaut happened
on the diaries of Victor Hugo's
daughter, Adele and found a
fascinating story of unrequited
love. Adele leaves France with
Victor, meets an English
lieutenant and falls madly in
love with him. He promptly
takes off to Nova Scotia and
she follows later. He has lost
interest, but she never does.
The frustration of one-way pas
sion follows.

"The Red Shoes" will be at
the Coffee House this Wed
nesday. A ballerina is torn bet
ween her love for a man and
her devotion to her work and
her mentor. The color photo
graphy is memorable. The rest
of the movie is a nice try.
And now for some an

nouncements. I'm talking toall
you amateur and semi-pro ac
tors and actresses, producers,
directors, etc. We are very in
terested in knowing what you
and your group are doing, but
there is no way we can find out
by osmosis. You must contact
us well in advance of your
opening if you are interested in
getting any kind of publicity,
be it a review, a preview or
even a mention in this column.
The best thing you can do is
send us a release. (Something
written always gets more atten
tion at this office.) Then give us
a call.

We can't promise you we'll
do everything you want us to,
but we will surely end updoing
nothing for your show unless
you contact us. We have a
small staff, a limited budget
and limited space and we rarely
do more than we are asked to
do with respect to local enter
tainment because of these limi
tations.
Incidentally, the deadline for
getting announcements into
Bay Area Events is the Friday
before publication.
