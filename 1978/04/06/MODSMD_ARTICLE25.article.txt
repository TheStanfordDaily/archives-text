## Andrew who? 
### 
For those of you who ask that question, An
drew Cold is a very talented musician, a solid
performer who deserves more credit and rec
ognition than he gets. Linda Ronstadt fans may
recognize him from his years as her lead
guitarist. Three years ago, he split from
Ronstadt's band to record his first album, "An
drew Gold," and toured as a warmup for Linda
Ronstadt and the Eagles. Since then, he has re
corded two more albums, "What's Wrong With
This Picture?" and "All This And Heaven Too,"
and had two hit singles, "Lonely Boy" — which
reached number four on the charts — and
"Thank You For Being A Friend" — currently
number 15 and still moving up.
Andrew Gold has been called a Frampton
waiting-to-happen, and his concert at The Board
ing House last Wednesday bolstered my confi
dence in his future. He started off with a couple
of rockers from his first two albums, "I'm a
Gambler" and "Hope Vou Feel Good," which
perked up the audience a little. But the crowd
really didn't react much until he started into a
series of four songs from "All This And Heaven
Too," beginning with "Thank You For Being A
Friend."
Oh Andrew
These he followed with some of the best
songs from hisearlieralbums, finishingwith the
hit "Lonely Boy." I was impressed that he didn't
try to promote his latest album; instead, he
played an equal numbers of songs from each of
his records.
Gold showed off his musical talents by per
forming the vocals on all the songs while switch
ing from guitar to piano with ease. Guitar solos
in "I'm A Gambler" and "One of Them is Me"
hinted at the abilities of the musician who Chet
Atkins has called the best young guitarist in the

business.
Band member Brock Walsh, who helped Gold
produce "All This And Heaven Too," deserves
special attention. He was outstanding on piano,
guitar, synthesizer, and harmony vocals, but he
seemed to be trying to upstage Gold.
One disappointment of the concert was that
Gold didn't play "Never Let It Slip Away," which
is rumored to be the next single released from
"Heaven Too." Already the most played single
on British radio, the song is a favorite of many
Andrew Gold fans — hard-core old-timers and
newcomers alike.
How could you
Despite his talents Gold does have problems
with his lyrics. Some of the lines just leap out in
vacuous rhymes, devoid of any meaning. For
example, this couplet from "Hope You Feel
Good': "I feel so good/ lust like I always wished I
would." Or this from "Thank You For Being A
Friend": "If it's a car you lack/ I'd surely buy a
Cadillac." Gold definitely needs some work on
his poetry.
A more noticeable problem is Gold's lack of
stage presence. He had trouble getting the au
dience excited — he's not an electric personal
ity. But worse than that, he broke a primary rule
of the stage: He turned his back on the audi
ence. During the guitar solos he turned to jam
with the band. This probably stems from his
years as guitarist in Ronstadt's band, but having
been on his own for three years, he should
know by now who the star is.
Gold, however, has much talent, both in
strumental and vocal, and consistently writes
winning music. He is an artist worth listening to
and watching for. Someday soon Andrew Gold
may attain superstar status.
