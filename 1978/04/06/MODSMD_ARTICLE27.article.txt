"Running Fence" is a
documentary about the con
troversial 24 mile long, 18
foot high white nylon fence
that artist Christo favacheff
erected in Marin and Sonoma
counties in 7976. The fence
was an enormous physical
task, from the battles bet
ween Christo (joined later by
the ranchers of the area) vs.
the various agencies involved
and continuing on through
the huge construction job in
volved in building the fence
itself at a cost of three million
dollars.
Christo is obviously an ob
sessed artist - he threw over
four years of his life into the
project. I wish the film would
have explored the motiva
tions behind Christo's obses
sion, but the focus here is on
the fence itself, and the
filmmakers (David and Albert
Maysles, and Charlotte Zwe
rin - whose credits include
"Gimme Shelter") employ
superb technique (particu
larly the expressive photo
graphy) to develop this focus.
"Running Fence" will be
shown Friday, April 7, in
Cubberley Auditorium.
Showtimes are 7:30 and 9:30
