### 
Six student conduct cases have been decided this academic year. They include
one Fundamental Standard case and five Honor Code cases, and involve a total of
seven students.
In the Fundamental Standard case, a graduate student admitted to altering
grades on copies of his official transcript and supplying the altered copies to
prospective employers. The Dean of Student Affairs recommended suspension for
one term and the President concurred.
Of the Honor Code cases, one was heard by the Stanford Judicial Council. In
this case, the SJC recommended that two students charged with impermissible
collaboration on a take-home examination be found not guilty of violating the
Honor Code due to "extreme ambiguity" regarding collaboration on homework
and exams in the course.
The President concurred in the SJC's recommendation on the basis of the
totality of factors in this particular case, but emphasized that none of these factors
by themselves could be sufficient to confuse students with respect to the obvious
expectation that they may not collaborate on examinations in absence of per
mission to do so.
The four remaining Honor Code cases were heard by the Dean of Student
Affairs, whose recommendations as to penalty were affirmed by the President.
In the first case, a coterminal senior who admitted to violating the Honor Code
by giving unpermitted aid on a final examination received a one-quarter delay in
the conferral of his Stanford degree.
In another case, a graduate student who admitted to the unpermitted use of
notes during an in-class final exam received a one-quarter suspension and a grade
of No Credit for the exam.
Finally, there were two cases involving plagiarism
In the first case, an undergraduate who copied substantial portions of his term
paper from a published work and represented it as his own received a one-quarter
suspension and a grade of No Credit for the course.
In a similar case, another student who copied a substantial portion of a paper
from documents prepared by a federal agency and represented it as his own work
also received a one-quarter suspension and a grade of No Credit for the course.
Every student who registered for the winter quarter should have received a
brochure entitled "Regulations Governing Student Conduct and Procedures for
Their Enforcement ."
For those who do not have one, extra copies are available at the Information
window on the first floor of the Old Union or the Office of Student Affairs. All
members of the Stanford community should be aware of the existence of these
regulations and procedures.
The foregoing report, based on information from the Stanford Judicial
Council, the Dean of Students Office, and the President's Office, teas released by
John Schwartz, University counsel. (SpaitÂ» paid by News and Publications Service
