# Sadat calls for Israeli flexibility

### 
Cairo (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin "should be more
flexible" in peace negotiations, Pres
ident Anwar Sadat said yesterday. He
added that Defense Minister Ezer
Weizman, seen as Begin's growing
political rival, is welcome to return to
Cairo "whenever there are new
ideas."
The Egyptian leader spoke to an
international group of journalists
and academics here for a conference
on news exchanges with the Third
World.
He was asked whether Begin per
sonally was regarded as responsible
for the current deadlock in the
Israeli-Egyptian peace process.
"Well, I don't want to interfere in
others' domestic problems," Sadat
replied. "What I feel is this — Mr.
Begin should be more flexible, and I
told this to Weizman when he visited
me last time. I don't teel like making
any comment other than this."
The Egyptian president also said,
as he had Sunday, that the estimated
JO,OOO Israelis who demonstrated in
Tel Aviv over the weekend for Begin
to make more concessions to the
Arabs were "wise."
Formal talks between the two na
tions were suspended more than two
months ago, although Weizman vis
ited Egypt last week and met twice
with Sadat. The defense minister is
expected to return next week.
Israeli spokesmen said Weizman
brought new proposals last week,
but the Egyptians said there had been

no progress.
The stalemate centers on Egypt's
insistence that Israel withdraw from
all occupied Arab land and allow the
Palestinians to determine their own
future. Israel rejects the idea of total
withdrawal and Begin has offered
home rule with a continued Israeli
military presence for the Palestinians
of the Gaza Strip and West Bank of
the Jordan River.
Also yesterday, Foreign Minister
Moshe Dayan returned to Israel from
a three-day visit to Romania and
Mideast talks with President Nicolae
Ceausescu which Dayan said yielded
no concrete results.

—A symbolic force of 30 Lebanese
national police entered the port city
of Tyre, a Palestinian enclave in
Israeli-occupied south Lebanon, and

joined French paratroopers of the
United Nations peace-keeping force
in patrolling coastal areas. It was the
first regular Lebanese force to enter
Tyre in three years and its deploy
ment, officials in Beirut said, was an
attempt to start restoring state con
trol of the war-torn region.

plans for evacuating the 500-

vaded by Israeli forces beginning
March 15. The cease-fire Israel de
clared March 21 was reported hold
ing, with a single morning incident of
firing between Israeli and Palestinian
guerrilla positions. But independent
observers said little sign was visible
of the thinning-out of occupation
forces Israel claimed it began more
than a week ago.
