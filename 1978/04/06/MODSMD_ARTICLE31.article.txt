## Easter films 
### 
Easter usually features an in
ordinate number of "Hol
lywood entertainment" re
leases, and this year is no ex
ception. I've taken a random
sampling of these pictures;
none of them are particularly
distinguished, but then they
aren't terrible either (except
"Crossed Swords").
Both "House Calls" and
"Casey's Shadow" star Walter
Matthau, long one of my favo
rite performers. He is not a
great actor, but what he can't
do well, he can fake (and fake
with style). For Matthau,
"House Calls" is meat and
potatoes; he fakes his way,
however, through "Casey's
Shadow."
"House Calls" is a geriatric
love comedy in the "Goodbye
Girl" vein. Matthau plays a
just-widowed middle-aged doc
tor who turns playboy. Though
successful, he's not really satis
fied until he meets Glenda
Jackson. Jackson, looking very
pretty, delivers a fine under
stated performance as the
woman who forces Matthau to
settle down (after a fashion)
once again.
Too many writers
The script (written by four
screenwriters, which is. almost
always too many) isn't very
good, and the film is directed
in a surprisingly functional
manner by Howard Zieff,
whose previous films
("Slither" and "Hearts of the
West") were directed with
fresh and original style. Here
Zieff just keeps things moving
along, directing more like a
TV-director than a film direc
tor. One thing is typical about
Zieff's direction: he gets solid
comic performances from his
cast, including Art Carney as a
doddering elder head of the
hospital and Richard Benjamin
as Matthau's younger friend.
The best performance in
"House Calls" is Matthau's. He
exaggerates his already unique
walk to the point where it ap
pears he's ready to fall over at
any time. Hilarious as a
swinger, bittersweet as
Jackson's lover, Matthau is ex
cellent throughout this other
wise too-typical (though pleas
ant enough) movie.
"Casey's Shadow" is a family
entertainment picture of the
type Martin Ritt, the director,
usually handles with aplomb
("Sounder"). In "Casey's
Shadow," Ritt — while main
taining his solid craftmanship
— appears uninspired. Con
sidering the material that Ritt is

working with, this is not sur
prising. The screenplay is basi
cally a "Will they win the big
one?" story of a poor horse
training family (headed by
Matthau) who finally gets a
chance to compete for quar
terhorse racing's biggest prize.
Typically, the family endures
trial and tribulations along the
way.
Cajun country
The film's biggest assets are
Ritt's (with an able assist from
brilliant cinematographer John
Alonzo) capturing of the mood
and atmosphere of the
Louisiana Cajun country and
Matthau's offbeat perfor
mance. He speaks in what I as
sume to be Cajun dialect,
which can best be described as
garbled Brooklynese.
Two other Easter releases are
"American Hot Wax" and
"Crossed Swords." "American
Hot Wax" is an energetic and
fast-paced look at D) Alan
Freed and the early days of
rock 'n' roll. Freed was daring;
he took on the big established
record industry, served as a
catalyst for the growth of rock,
and finally ended up losing his
career because of it.
The film is very superficial;
we never really see inside the
characters. The question,
"Why was Freed the way he
was?" is not asked, let alone
answered. Director Floyd Mut
rux, while failing to meet such
questions, does manage to
capture the hustling, frenetic
pace of Freed's life.
I'd much rather watch the
"no name" cast of the small
budget "American Hot Wax"
than the expensive dross of the
miserable "Crossed Swords'
with its all star cast. "Crossed
Swords" was held out of re
lease for nearly two years, pre
sumably to work the film into
something worth distributing.
But no amount of work can
change the basic problem of
this film: its hack director
Richard Fleischer. Fleischer is
best known for his bombs, of
which "Tora, Tora, Tora!" is
the best example.
The movie is based on
Twain's tale "The Prince and
the Pauper." The material de
mands high style; Fleischer
gives us bawdiness. It begs for
swashbuckling and intelli
gence; Fleischer gives us
wrestling and exploitation. The
film is overlighted, it looks ter
rible, and Fleischer and his
score of screenwriters can't
even manage to advance the
plot clearly.
