# COP fulfills most of its campaign promises
## 
### Lance Goto News analysis 
Campaign promises can prove dif
ficult to carry out, but this year, the
ASSU Council of Presidents (COP)
kept most of its many campaign
pledges. Only a few of the co
presidents' campaign topics were
neglected, and these topics were
minor compared to the issues they
did tackle.
The four co-presidents — Glenn
Jordan, Greg Larson, Anne Henkels
and Steve Westly — will end their
terms next month. In accordance
with their campaign promises, they
concentrated on the evaluation of fa
culty members, possible instruc
tional improvements, academic ad
vising, the University's corporate in
vestment policies and the develop
ment of the Western Culture re
quirement.
They have also followed their
campaign promises involving minor
ity affairs, graduate student issues,
rights of women and gays, University
internships and election reform.
COP also provided new ASSU ser
vices to students, including an ASSU
Recycling Center.
Besides directing activities toward
their platform promises, the co
presidents became involved with
budgeting processes at the Univer
sity, the Honor Code Commission,
the ASSU Senate election con
troversy and the ASSU Nominations
Committee.
Fraternity issues, club sport fund
ing, and Co-op housing concerns
were put aside for issues like the
Honor Code, the Election Review
Board and the Nominations Commit
tee.
After being elected last April, Lar
son made a list of the responsibilities
of each COP member, including all
promises that were made during the
campaign. The COP duties were di
vided among the four co-presidents
with each co-president being held
responsible for specific issues. Lar

son's list was later used to check their
individual progress.
The division of responsibility has
been highly effective in producing
COP activity and results.
For example, Larson, who worked
on the ASSU Course Guide last year,
was a member of the Faculty Senate
Committee on the Evaluation and
Improvement of Teaching. This
committee worked on teaching

evaluations and questionnaires,
proposed a center for teaching im
provement and implemented an ad
visory association for faculty mem
bers.
Larson was also responsible for a
study of the academic advising prog
ram of the University.
"We've put together a group of
about 20 students, called the Com
mission on Advising," he said. This

commission is currently processing a
recent survey of student body views
on the advising system.
Co-presidents Henkels and Jordan
promoted student concerns for the
University's corporate investments.
While Henkels served on the ad hoc
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR), Jordan did promotional
work. He participated in panels on
South Africa and talked to groups
such as the National Black Law As
sociation.
Minority affairs
Jordan also worked on the minor
ity affairs section of the COP plat
form. He encouraged minority in
volvement on committees and pub
licized minority issues.
The COP is currently monitoring
graduate minority admissions and
the admissions of women graduate
students.
The graduate student issues, em
phasized during the campaign, were
the responsibility of both Jordan and
Larson.
These two co-presidents also tried
to set the groundwork for graduate
student involvement in University af
fairs. They set up the graduate stu
dent orientation funds for next year
and worked for the funding of
graduate student social activities.
Henkels was assigned to the con
servation and recycling issue. She
helped develop the ASSU Recycling
Project, which has had tremendous
success.
Westly has been busy heading the
ASSU Ad Hoc Panel on Western Cul
ture. The panel insures student rep
resentation in the development of
the course requirement. It was an
important point in the campaign.
Westly was chairman for both the
Honor Code Commission and the
Nominations Committee.
The Honor Code Commission was
a creation of this year's COP. Its pur
pose is to publicize and re
emphasize the importance of the

Honor Code.
The COP has been successful in
fulfilling almost all of their diverse
campaign promises. Two students
aided the four co-presidents because
of the work load, and, as Jordan em
phasized, the co-presidents kept the
COP office open about 40 hours
every week.
Fred Crethel, ASSU Senate chair
man, analyzed the COP's success
this year.
"The diversity of the people within
the COP this year gave them a little
bit of a vantage point, in that some of
their people, at times, could remove
themselves from the situation a little
bit and critique what was going on,"
he said.

These two co-presidents also tried
to set the groundwork for graduate
student involvement in University af
fairs. They set up the graduate stu

and worked for the funding of
graduate student social activities.
Henkels was assigned to the con

helped develop the ASSU Recycling
Project, which has had tremendous
success.
Westly has been busy heading the
ASSU Ad Hoc Panel on Western Cul

the course requirement. It was an

Westly was chairman for both the
Honor Code Commission and the
Nominations Committee.

Honor Code.
The COP has been successful in
fulfilling almost all of their diverse
campaign promises. Two students
aided the four co-presidents because
of the work load, and, as Jordan em
phasized, the co-presidents kept the
COP office open about 40 hours
every week.
Fred Crethel, ASSU Senate chair
man, analyzed the COP's success
this year.
"The diversity of the people within
the COP this year gave them a little
bit of a vantage point, in that some of
their people, at times, could remove
themselves from the situation a little
bit and critique what was going on,"
he said.
Campaign promises can prove dif
ficult to carry out, but this year, the
ASSU Council of Presidents (COP)
kept most of its many campaign
pledges. Only a few of the co
presidents' campaign topics were
neglected, and these topics were
minor compared to the issues they
did tackle.
The four co-presidents — Glenn
Jordan, Greg Larson, Anne Henkels
and Steve Westly — will end their
terms next month. In accordance
with their campaign promises, they
concentrated on the evaluation of fa
culty members, possible instruc
tional improvements, academic ad
vising, the University's corporate in
vestment policies and the develop
ment of the Western Culture re
quirement.
They have also followed their
campaign promises involving minor
ity affairs, graduate student issues,
rights of women and gays, University
internships and election reform.
COP also provided new ASSU ser
vices to students, including an ASSU
Recycling Center.
Besides directing activities toward
their platform promises, the co
presidents became involved with
budgeting processes at the Univer
sity, the Honor Code Commission,
the ASSU Senate election con
troversy and the ASSU Nominations
Committee.
Fraternity issues, club sport fund
ing, and Co-op housing concerns
were put aside for issues like the
Honor Code, the Election Review
Board and the Nominations Commit
tee.
After being elected last April, Lar
son made a list of the responsibilities
of each COP member, including all
promises that were made during the
campaign. The COP duties were di
vided among the four co-presidents
with each co-president being held
responsible for specific issues. Lar

son's list was later used to check their
individual progress.
The division of responsibility has
been highly effective in producing
COP activity and results.
For example, Larson, who worked
on the ASSU Course Guide last year,
was a member of the Faculty Senate
Committee on the Evaluation and
Improvement of Teaching. This
committee worked on teaching

evaluations and questionnaires,
proposed a center for teaching im
provement and implemented an ad
visory association for faculty mem
bers.
Larson was also responsible for a
study of the academic advising prog
ram of the University.
"We've put together a group of
about 20 students, called the Com
mission on Advising," he said. This

commission is currently processing a
recent survey of student body views
on the advising system.
Co-presidents Henkels and Jordan
promoted student concerns for the
University's corporate investments.
While Henkels served on the ad hoc
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR), Jordan did promotional
work. He participated in panels on
South Africa and talked to groups
such as the National Black Law As
sociation.
Minority affairs
Jordan also worked on the minor
ity affairs section of the COP plat
form. He encouraged minority in
volvement on committees and pub
licized minority issues.
The COP is currently monitoring
graduate minority admissions and
the admissions of women graduate
students.
The graduate student issues, em
phasized during the campaign, were
the responsibility of both Jordan and
Larson.
