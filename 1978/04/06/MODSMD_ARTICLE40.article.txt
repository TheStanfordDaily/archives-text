Carter attempting to cut inflation
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, beset by a fal
ling dollar, rising prices and large oil imports, is diafting
what is described as a new, get-tough approach to con
trolling inflation.
He told congressional leaders at a breakfast meeting
yesterday that he will take a larger personal role in lobby
ing for his energy bill, which he said is crucial to control
ling oil imports and inflation, according to some who
attended the meeting.
And he expressed what was described as "hostility" to
the multi-billion-dollar farm subsidy bill being consi
dered by Congress, which he considers inflationary.
White House spokesman Jody Powell said Carter con
siders the bill "unacceptable."
European unemployment protested
Brussels, Belgium — Angry over rising unemployment,
millions of Western European workers walked off the
job, rallied in plants or demonstrated in the street yes
terday in their first such international labor protest.
At least 31 trade unions representing some 40 million
workers in 18 countries were included in "Action Day,"
officials said.
An estimated 15 million laborers staged staggered
strikes in Spain, Italy, Greece and Belgium lasting from
one to four hours. Union leaders said the protest was
aimed not at crippling the region but to warn officials of
more walkouts unless people are put back to work.
Cut in U.S. Navy size questioned
Washington — Congressional supporters of a stronger
U.S. Navy said yesterday that President Jimmy Carter's
efforts to cut funds for naval shipbuilding poses a clear
threat to national security.
Representative Charles Bennett, chairman of the sea
power subcommittee of the House Armed Services
Committee, opened hearings on Sea Plan 2000, a study
which Bennett said shows the need for a larger and
balanced U.S. fighting force at sea.
In a statement delivered on the Senate floor, Senator
Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) called the Carter plan "a
blueprint for disaster when weighed against the real
needs of the U.S. Navy and the threat posed by the
Soviet Navy."
Israel 'thinning' forces in Lebanon
Abassiyeh, Lebanon —Though Israel says it is thinning
out its forces in southern Lebanon, its soldiers are acting
as policemen, carpenters, doctors, administrators and
water workers for Lebanese civilians in the area.
Much of this activity is directed at alleviating the plight
of refugees returning from north of the Litani River after
being driven from their homes by the Israeli invasion
three weeks ago.
But there was little evidence of the "thinning-out"
announced by the army on Monday. A reporter who
drove through the occupied area from east to west saw
tanks and mobile artillery in the same positions they
occupied when southern Lebanon was first opened to
journalists two weeks ago.

Emergency farm aid bill called hoax
Washington — The emergency farm aid package
headed for votes in the Senate and House — and a
presidential veto if it passes — is an election-year hoax,
says a disgruntled congressman, designed to lay blame
for farmers' troubles on the president.
The bill was approved Tuesday by conferees from the
House and Senate, despite administration promises of a
veto. It now goes to a Senate vote, possibly this week,
and then to th:» House.
"It'san election issue, and it's rotten," said Represen
tative Frederick Richmond (D-N.Y.), a dissenting
member of the conference committee. "It's a hoax on
the farmers that this will become law."
Aldo Moro pleads again for release
Rome — Former Premier Aldo Moro, in a letter attri
buted to him by his terrorist kidnappers, declared Tues
day that time was running out and called for an exchange
of prisoners to win his release as "the only possible
positive solution.
"May Cod enlighten you. We hope that you do
quickly what is necessary," concluded the letter to lead
ers of his Christian Democrat Party.
Copies of Moro's typewritten and signed letter and a
three-page message from the Red Brigades, Italy's most
feared terrorist group, were made public as Premier
Ciulio Andreotti was telling Parliament his government
was basically in the dark 19 days after the kidnapping
took place.
Jack Anderson loses Nixon suit
Washington — A damage suit asking more than $20
million from Richard Nixon and former top officials of
his administration was dismissed Tuesday because the
plaintiff, columnist Jack Anderson, refused to reveal
some of his sources.
"There is substantial indication," said U.S. District
Judge Gerhard Gesell, "that plaintiff can prove acts of
official harassment and efforts at high levels of the Nixon
administration to interfere with his work as a news
paperman."
