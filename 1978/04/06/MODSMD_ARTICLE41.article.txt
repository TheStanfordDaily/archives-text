# Done for fun
## ISC schedules rush activities 
### Ann Lincoln 
"Yes, we really are having rush!"
says an Inter-Sorority Council (ISC)
information sheet.
University sororities, re
established in December after a ban
of more than 30 years, are now plan
ning parties that members hope will
win many girls to their ranks.
In the works for Kappa Alpha Theta
are a Polynesian luau, a jungle party
and a French cerie, according to
Wendy Jalonei membership chair
man of the sorurity.
Alpha Phi is pi,inning an Italian
picnic, a beach party and a party that
is a take-off on the Sweet Dreams
Candy Shop, said Janice Kimball,
Alpha Phi president.
"The Alpha Phi's have chosen
themes that will coordinate the re
freshments and activities that will be
taking place," Kimball said.
Leslie Crozier, membership
chairman of Kappa Kappa Camma,
said that her group is planning to
have the theme of "Kappa-ret" for
one of their functions.
Rush will begin Monday and will
conclude on April 22 with the issuing
of bids.
The ISC is regulating most of these
rush week activities in an effort to
make them fair and equal for all of
the groups that are participating.
"Just remember, we have de
signed this rush to be fair to all
groups. We want sororities to be
strong at Stanford," states the list of
ISC rush decisions.
The ISC has also set up a calendar
of activities to be held by all groups
during rush. On Monday night all
groups will be present in Stern for
rotational parties between 7 and 9
p.m.
"Rotational parties give girls an
opportunity to see all six sororities,"
said Kimball.
On Tuesday and Wednesdays of
both weeks the sororities will hold
open houses. Each sorority has the
option of having an invitational party
on Friday, Saturday or Sunday of the
first week, according to Kimball. She
added that the party would be "just
to get to know each other better."
Rush parties will conclude on April
21 with preference night.
"Preference night each sorority
gives two parties and you have to
have been invited," said Kimball.
"You can only goto two, that'swhere
they're laying their cards on the line.
At the same time the sororities are
making a decision about the girls

they want, the girls are making a de
cision about the sorority they want."
"Preference parties just give a spe
cial idea of what a sorority means. It's
a little more serious than the other
partying that's going on during the
two weeks," said Jalonen.
She added that these parties will
differ from fraternity preference par
ties in that they will give girls a
glimpse of the real beliefs and mean
ings of each sorority.
After attending preference parties,
the girls will return to the Manzanita
Lounge where they will sign a prefer
ence list ranking their choices of
sororities, according to Kimball.

"Saturday morning bid matching
then occurs which is when the girls'
preferences are matched with the
sororities' preferences. That will be
done by women not connected with
the sororities at Stanford to insure
that it's fair and to keep it totally un
biased," Kimball said.
She said that the University ad
ministration had not made any rul
ings about rush other than to forbid
letters of reference and discrimina
tion based on race or religion. So this
first rush will be what the sororities
choose to make it, and one rush
chairperson summed up the attitude
by saying "This is just so much fun."
