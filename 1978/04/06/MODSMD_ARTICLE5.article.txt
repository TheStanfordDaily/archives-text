## 'Supertank' leaks 
### Helen Nissenbaum 
Even though it's made of
earthquake-resistant reinforced
concrete, the University's new
4-million gallon chilled-water tank
has sprung several leaks.
Construction on Supertank
began last year. The subterranean
tank, 25 feet deep and almost as
large as a football field, is located
under a volleyball court west of
the steam generating plant on
Campus Drive.
Designed to function as an
energy-conserving air con
ditioner, the tank, when opera
ble,will pump chilled water to var
ious University buildings, accord
ing to John Lerry, construction
and engineering manager.
But first, the leaks have to be
fixed.
Lerry said the leaks were disco
vered in January when the
$630,000 reservoir was filled for
the first time. At that time, the
tank was leaking at about 50 gal
lons a minute, Lerry said.
He added that minimal leakage
from a tank like Supertank is ac
ceptable, but that this leakage rate
needed to be curtailed.
Lerry said that fortunately, the

surrounding soil is "porous so it
carries the water away." There
fore, there are no large puddles
affecting the volleyball courts or
Campus Drive.
The biggest problem in repair
ing Supertank is finding the
cracks, Lerry said. When the tank
is emptied, cracks cannot be
seen, so divers are being sent
down to do patching.
The divers are "expert in de
termining leaks," Lerry said. He
added that cracks are being
patched with a plastic compound
that sets quickly underwater.
|eff Littleboy, associate editor at
news and publications service,
said the cracks were caused by
natural movements in the earth.
Lerry agreed that the cracks
were not caused by error in de
sign or construction.
Nevertheless, the "cool pool"
is still underwarrantyand the con
tracting company is taking full fi
nancial responsibility for detec
tion and repair of leaks, Lerry said.
He added that although the lo
cations of some leaks have still not
been found, he hopes repairs will
be completed by the beginning of
May.

ty's air conditioning system, to inspect leaks. Cracks in the tank resulted in
50 gallons of water per minute leaking into the surrounding earth until
repairs were begun.
