# Ethnic theme houses: A learning experience
## 
### Jill Liscom News analysis 
For one white student here, living
in one of the three ethnic theme
houses "has meant learning to get
along with other people and accept
what other people say as being true
for them even if it's not true for you."
For one minority student, the
theme house "fulfills a need to be
around some of my own people and
learn more about my own culture,
which is something I had missed out

on growing up in a predominantly
white neighborhood."
For another minority student, "the
house provides a sense of security
and a situation in which I can find
more of the type of atmosphere of
where I come from."
Vet these are only a few of the
reasons why students have chosen to
live in the black, Chicano or Asian-
American theme houses. And as all
three of their resident fellows
pointed out, "it has been a constant

struggle to define the theme because
the house means many different
things to many different people."
According to Art Pacheco, resident
fellow at Casa Zapata, the Chicano
theme house, "The many focuses
that come out of those differences
have some very positive educational
effects that make us realize how
complex our culture can be."
Problematic
However, "these differences can
also be problematic" when conflicts
of interest arise, he added
"It's hard to balance out the dorm
aspect and the theme aspect of the
house," explained Lori Cooper, a
house associate (RA) in Ujamaa, the
black theme house.
"We do want to emphasize the
black culture, but at the same time
there's a realization that 50 per cenc
of the residents are not black, and
they have needs, too," she added.
All cultural theme houses are
coeducational, four-class dorms. Up
to 50 per cent of the spaces are alot
ted to minority students on a priority
basis. Remaining spaces are filled by
students not of that minority who
either request that house or indicate
that they have no preference.
Ujamaa, the largest of the cultural
houses with approximately 150 resi
dents, is located in the Lagunita
dorm complex. Zapata in Stern Hall,
and Junipero, the Asian-American
quarters, in Wilbur Hall, each house
about 95 students.
Cultural centers
Besides providing theme-related
activities for house members, ethnic
houses also serve as cultural centers
for the rest of the campus and the
community.
As the only center for Asian stu
dents on campus, Junipero "has, in
the past, complicated the role of the
dorm and made it difficult for resi
dents to sort out what was a house
activity and what was a community
activity," said resident fellow Nancy
Okimoto.
This year, the Office of Student Af
fairs has sponsored a student intern
to coordinate all Asian-American ac
tivities. This has allowed the theme
house to "concentrate more on
being a good residential house,"
Okimoto said.
Less tension
As a result, "there has been much
less tension there this year,"
Okimoto added.
However, several residents of
Zapata and Ujamaa said they feel a
noticeable amount of tension exists
within their houses.
In Ujamaa, "The blacks basically
don't want you here and you don't
want you here. Whether it's stated or
not, it's clear â€” it's just in the atmos

phere," said one white freshman re
sident.
"Most of the initiative is taken by
the black students to have parties
and dances, so they usually end up
geared to their own culture,"
explained black Ujamaa resident fel
low Irvin Brown.
According to Cooper, who has
lived in Ujamaa for four years, the
tension stems from when the black
theme house was first located in
Roble Hall in 1971. During that year
30 per cent of the spaces were given
to black students.
In 1974 the black theme house was
moved to Olivo-Magnolia house in
Lagunita and the name was changed
to Ujamaa, which is the Swahili word
for "familyhood."
"The dorm is a home-like envi
ronment where black students might
not feel as inclined as they do all day
long to accommodate the white cul
ture. White students have to stand
up for what they feel like doing," re
marked Brown.
Segregation
Although Zapata has remained in
the same house since it was first or
ganized in 1971, it also has similar
problems of segregation, although
several staff members said the divi
sions are based on socio-economic
status rather than race.
"You find a lot of people sticking
together who are already locked into
what they're doing. The Chicanos
look down on the Anglos and people
start avoiding each other," said Jose
Gonzalez, an RA in Zapata.
On the other hand, several stu
dents said that residents often per
ceive cultural barriers that really
don't exist.
"In many cases that appear like un
friendliness, there's just a general
lack of interest that can be broken
down by being approached," com
mented Brown.
In Junipero, most students agreed
that the Asian-Americans and whites
were "fairly well mixed" and a mini
mal amount of racial tension existed.
According to Landus Lum, a theme
associate in Junipero, this is probably
because Asian-Americans are, on the
average, of a higher socio-economic
status than the average blacks and
Chicanos. Therefore there is not as
great a class difference between
Asians and whites.
Overall, most residents in all three
houses said they thought the feelings
of uneasiness were common in a
situation where minority students
are placed in the majority.
But many also said that for whites
to be put in the role of the minority is
a very positive educational experi
ence because "it opens your eyes to
what others have gone through."
