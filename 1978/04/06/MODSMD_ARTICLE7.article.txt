# Christian rationale defended

During the past couple of weeks, Pan Demetrakakes
and Patrick Frank presented convincing arguments that
humans can and do make gross mistakes and errors of
judgment. (Daily Feb. 27, and Mar. 7.)
For reasons about which I can but speculate, they
gonfined their examples to Christian foibles. (Since
Christians have been around for almost two millenia,
there is naturally a large variety of examples to cite.)
From their observations, they concluded that Christ
ians represent a threat to personal freedom, in fact, a
greater threat than other groups of people bound to
gether by a common interest.
The nature of the reasoning which led them to this
conclusion is obscure, because they presented no simi
lar examples of mistakes made by non-Christians (a his
tory which is also extensive), whereas such a demonstra
tion is surely necessary before ANY comparative state
ment can be made.
To be sure, one of them (Frank) might claim that he
had justified this conclusion by reference to the nature
of the Christian faith, in particular, its understanding of
absolute truth.
Again, though, he provided no compelling evidence
that Christian belief about the nature of absolute truth is
inherently more dangerous or unstable than other be
liefs.
Ideas mistaken
It is apparent that both Demetrakakes and Frank hold
mistaken ideas about the Christian faith. Because they
never state their understandings explicitly, it is difficult
to ferret these ideas out except by inference from inci
dental comments in their articles.
But it is important to try to do so because what pre
tends to be an argument may be only the expression of
the authors' feelings. Terry Johnson, John Bravman and
Bill Alexander (Daily, Mar. 1 and 9 ) have addressed
some of these misconceptions, and I address two more
•here.
The first is evident in the final sentence of Demet-
Vakakes' article: Christianity is antithetical to reason.
Were this the case, Christianity would indeed be ab-
Isurd: it would teach that man's reason is endowed by
Cod, but that to know Him one must discard those
reasoning faculties.
Actually, Christians believe that there are aspects of
reality which transcend reason; in other words, we can
never know everything about the universe by reasoning
alone, but there is a realm which we can know by faith.
(Immanuel Kant made this same point about two cen
turies ago.)
Even in this realm, reasoning is not invalid or useless,
ibut given the difficulties a finite mind has comprehend
ing the infinite, there are times when reason must be

subordinated to faith.
To allege that Christianity promotes antirational be
havior is to ignore the many intelligent men and women
who have written of their commitment to Christ and the
ultimate reasonableness of such a decision. Notable in
our time are C.S. Lewis, Fulton Sheen, and John W.
Stott.
Humbleness highlighted
Frank manifested a much deeper misunderstanding of
Christianity when he characterized Christians as self
righteous. Actually, to identify oneself as Christian, to
claim a relationship with God, is to say that one recog
nizes his own insufficiency to live as he ought, and that
he has responded to the call of Cod to follow and live in
His will and strength,
The Christian does not claim that he has some special
quality — is so handsome, brainy, or lovable — that
Almighty God just had to reveal Himself to him, but
rather that God chose (for reasons of His own) to make
His love known to him in a way which demanded re
sponse.
(Lest you imagine that one always responds "yes"
instantly, read Francis Thompson's poem "The Hound
of Heaven," in which he described his efforts to turn his
back on the love of God.)
You may object at this point that when I say I have a
relationship with God I am making a statement based
solely on feelings. And I admit that I cannot prove it
logically, nor can I construct an experiment to test its
truth.
But I can offer my conviction that I've seen changes in
my life during the past three years or so for which I can
offer no explanation but the direct intervention of God.
Scripture induces change
In particular, I still don't understand why I started to
read John's gospel upon retiring at night (although I
didn't tell anyone I was reading it, as such activity was
not in vogue at Swarthmore either).
But within the three weeks (one chapter a night) it
took me to read it, many people (including students,
doctors, and (horrors!) professors) remarked that I had
changed a great deal: formerly depressed and anxious
almost all the time. I looked and acted much happier;
looking back, I have to agree, though at the time I didn't
know what they meant.
Both Demetrakakes and Frank could improve their
perspectives on Christianity by finding out more about
it. I suggest talking with one or more Christians about
their faith, although just reading a book by Lewis or
Sheen could do a good deal to give them a more ba
lanced viewpoint.
