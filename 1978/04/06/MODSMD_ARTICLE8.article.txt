# Letters: Androgyny, Reps

Students irresponsible
For the second consecutive meet
ling (Mar. 9, 1978), the Panel on Re
combinant DNA Research fell one
ivote short of a quorum to act on ap
plications to perform such research
!by two of Stanford's most distin
guished microbiologists.
! On neither occasion did the stu
|dent representative, despite ample
{notification, and, at least on the sec
(ond occasion, special invitation, ap
pear. In each of the other categories,
•faculty scientist, faculty non
scientist, and community represen
tative, the percentage attendance
has been far better.
If the students cannot get their
representative to the committees on
which they are represented, they
'would do better not to be rep
presented at all.

Androgyny unjustly axed
For many years I have assumed that
good educators understood the real
purpose of academic activities:
learning. Since seeing the an
nouncement, however, that Simone
de Beauvoir House (yes, we did de
cide on a name) will not be con

tinued due to a lack of "quality of the
academic program,'' I can see that
my assumption was totally wrong.
Academia and the Office of Resi
dential Education are blind to the
value of the books on sex roles I read
on my own which were not required
for any class and which I would never
have heard of if I hadn't lived here.
They ignore the educational value
of long discussions on sex roles with
the house co-ordinators, both doc
toral students who are certainly as
qualified to lecture on their special
ties as any graduate T.A. is.
Is there no educational value to liv
ing in an environment free of sexist
humor, of sexist attitudes, of sexist
behavioral stereotypes? There seems
to be enough value in environments
for the Office of Residential Educa
tion to remove another residence
from the housing draw to create a
third language theme house.
Perhaps if we all spoke Andro
gyn. . . .
The irony of the situation is that the
activities which do count as
"academic" can be so superficial.
Anything involving a professor is
sanctioned even if the professor only
eats dinner at the house once a week
and the theme isn't even discussed.
Having resident fellows who are
professors is incredibly academic

even if you see them only once a
quarter and they don't even recog
nize you as a member of their house,
as happened last year with me.
Apparently selling food is
academic, too, since no one has
proposed discontinuing the houses
whose only "academic" activity is
running a successful restaurant. Too ;
bad there isn't a "feminist burger" of -ft
a "chauvinist shake."
Don't misunderstand me. I th>«fcW»*
theme houses can be very worth
while. But they can also be educa
tional jokes masquerading as
academic wonders. I think it is
grossly unfair to evaluate Simone de
Beauvoir by a definition of
"academic" which includes making
pizza and doesn't include indepen
dent reading.
