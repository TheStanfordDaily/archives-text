Dear Stanford Daily
I am writing this letter in my sincere and hum
ble thanks, for when I wrote my plea to you asking
for your help in helping me seek new fnends. you
not only helped me without asking why is Ray in
prison, but you gave me your help without asking
for money for your services, which I couldn t have
paid
Your ad brought me over 30 responses from
both staff and students at Stanford University,
and a few wonderfulresponses from warm loving
people who are not connected with the university
but receive the Daily
I have answered |ust about all of the letters but
a lew. and will get those few answered soon I
would give anything to be able to tell all of Stan
ford University how much I love them, for they are
very warm, forgiving, loving people
My humble thanks.

Dear Stanford Daily
I am writing this letter in my sincere and hum
ble thanks, for when I wrote my plea to you asking
for your help in helping me seek new fnends. you
not only helped me without asking why is Ray in
prison, but you gave me your help without asking
for money for your services, which I couldn t have
paid
Your ad brought me over 30 responses from
both staff and students at Stanford University,
and a few wonderfulresponses from warm loving
people who are not connected with the university
but receive the Daily
I have answered |ust about all of the letters but
a lew. and will get those few answered soon I
would give anything to be able to tell all of Stan
ford University how much I love them, for they are
very warm, forgiving, loving people
My humble thanks.
