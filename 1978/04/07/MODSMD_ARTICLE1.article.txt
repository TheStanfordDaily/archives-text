Quemoy, Taiwan — In the haze of an
early spring afternoon, mainland China is
a mere brown silhouette against the sky.
But it is China nonetheless, and for a 21-
year-old college senior born and raised
on Taiwan, this is the closest glimpse of
the world's largest civilization she may
ever have.
She is caught, as is the bulk of educated
youth on Taiwan, between pride in being
Chinese and loyalty to a government
whose own officials admit is indefinitely
confined to its island stronghold.
As the current generation of Taiwanese
youth comes of age, it will face problems
common to all nations of the semi
developed world: industrialization and
its costs, overpopulation, Westernization
and the threat of losing native culture.
But in doing so, this nation's young
people will be forced to question the as
sumptions which have maintained the
Nationalist government here for nearly 30
years after the triumph of the Chinese
Communist Party in 1949.
The central assumption — that
Taiwan's capital city, Taipei, is actually the
provisional seat of government for all
China — has been relied upon directly
and indirectly to justify a number of re
straints on individual rights as well as a
variety of collective sacrifices by this is
land's people.
In addition, it has served to perpetuate

the rule of the kuot untang or Nationalist
Party (KMT) despite the overwhelming
majority of "native Taiwanese" — de
scendents of the hinese who immig
rated here centuries ago and were only
peripherally involved in the great KMT-
Communist struggle.
All this makes the attitude of Taiwanese
youth toward the possibility of, in the
government's phrase, "recovering the
mainland," crucial in the years to come.
"It is still something we hope for, it is
still an idea we have that has some
chance. But we don't think of it as a prob
able thing any more," said the senior,
herself a native Taiwanese.
But she said that abandoning all hope
of returning to the mainland, whether by
successful invasion or by a favorable
coup in Peking, would affect the Chinese
pride of those on Taiwan. From being a
member, albeit in exile, of an 800
million-person society to becoming one
of only 18 million on a small and precari
ously positioned island is a dismal pros
pect for a young Chinese, she said.
Not all students share ever her limited
optimism. "There's no chance, no way
we can get back in the forseeable future,"
said a junior at Taipei's Fu Jen Catholic
University. "It's a terrible dilemma for
me, because even though I hate the
Communists and everything they've
done, Taiwan is part of China and I want it
to be united as a Chinese.
"Of course, I'd like to see it united
under this (KMT) government, but it
would be better, I think, to have one na
tion under a bad government than the
way it is now."
The middle position, that a combina

tion of political realism and anti-
Communism mandates a separate, inde
pendent Taiwan, is less visible now than it
was 20 years ago.
But it continues to exist and may be
come more attractive to Taiwanese youth
as the pace of the island's industrializa
tion quickens.
How does the prevalent youthful skep
ticism regarding the official KMT goal of
"recovering the mainland" affect opinion
on other, second-level national policies?
A common complaint is about the gov
ernment's restrictions on literature —
"propaganda" in the KMT phrase — from
the mainland. Students who are not in
volved in sponsored research on com
munism, and have not, therefore, been
scrutinized for what one researcher cal
led political "maturity," find it difficult to
gain access to information from the main
land.
"Sometimes I resent the rule very
much. The government says we are loyal
and yet won't allow us to see both sides. I
want to know what the communists say,"
said a Taipei University senior.
"Maybe it's true that people outside
college would be influenced by it, but we
college students should not be held
back."
Government officials emphasized that
there is no dearth of "information" about
the mainland on Taiwan — all of it from
Western or Taiwan sources, of course.
They dismissed as useless lies material
from the communist government.
"I know they lie. My government puts
out propaganda, too. I just want to bave
the right to read it," said another student.
Beyond access to information, a few

students interviewed had a more
generalized objection to KMT policies.
One, a senior at National University in
Taipei, said that as today's youth begins
to inherit power from the aging KMT
hierarchy, it will demand changes making
Taiwan more democratic.
"The National Assembly (which elected
President Chiang Ching-kuo last month
with little opposition) is made up of old
men who haven t been elected since we
left the mainland," he said.
"They are using the martial law and the
threat of the Communists and saying 'We
can't be a democracy under these cir
cumstances.' "
Asked if he would characterize
Taiwan's government as a fascist one
which, since Chiang Kai-Shek's death in
1975, is becoming more democratic, he
agreed with reservations.
"It may have been fascist, but it is im
possible to be a real democracy when you
are fighting for your life. It's just that the
you nger people want to change the struc
ture so that they can have some influence
on the government.
"No one is watching the inefficiency of
the government's policies because no
body can get into power who isn't already
there."
Others strongly disagreed with the
term "fascist" but agreed that as 1949 re
cedes into history and the problems of
Taiwan as a de facto nation become more
complex, young Taiwanese will demand
the government open its processes.
"We can't keep the same government
forever, hoping to get back someday,"
said one student. "We have to make this
place we have strong and democratic."

the world's largest civilization she may
ever have.
She is caught, as is the bulk of educated
youth on Taiwan, between pride in being
Chinese and loyalty to a government
whose own officials admit is indefinitely
confined to its island stronghold.
As the current generation of Taiwanese
youth comes of age, it will face problems
common to all nations of the semi
developed world: industrialization and
its costs, overpopulation, Westernization
and the threat of losing native culture.
But in doing so, this nation's young
people will be forced to question the as
sumptions which have maintained the
Nationalist government here for nearly 30
years after the triumph of the Chinese
Communist Party in 1949.
The central assumption — that
Taiwan's capital city, Taipei, is actually the
provisional seat of government for all
China — has been relied upon directly
and indirectly to justify a number of re
straints on individual rights as well as a
variety of collective sacrifices by this is
land's people.
In addition, it has served to perpetuate

the rule of the kuot untang or Nationalist
Party (KMT) despite the overwhelming
majority of "native Taiwanese" — de
scendents of the hinese who immig
rated here centuries ago and were only
peripherally involved in the great KMT-
Communist struggle.
All this makes the attitude of Taiwanese
youth toward the possibility of, in the
government's phrase, "recovering the
mainland," crucial in the years to come.
"It is still something we hope for, it is
still an idea we have that has some
chance. But we don't think of it as a prob
able thing any more," said the senior,
herself a native Taiwanese.
But she said that abandoning all hope
of returning to the mainland, whether by
successful invasion or by a favorable
coup in Peking, would affect the Chinese
pride of those on Taiwan. From being a
member, albeit in exile, of an 800
million-person society to becoming one
of only 18 million on a small and precari
ously positioned island is a dismal pros
pect for a young Chinese, she said.
Not all students share ever her limited
optimism. "There's no chance, no way
we can get back in the forseeable future,"
said a junior at Taipei's Fu Jen Catholic
University. "It's a terrible dilemma for
me, because even though I hate the
Communists and everything they've
done, Taiwan is part of China and I want it
to be united as a Chinese.
"Of course, I'd like to see it united
under this (KMT) government, but it
would be better, I think, to have one na
tion under a bad government than the
way it is now."
The middle position, that a combina

tion of political realism and anti-
Communism mandates a separate, inde
pendent Taiwan, is less visible now than it
was 20 years ago.
But it continues to exist and may be
come more attractive to Taiwanese youth
as the pace of the island's industrializa
tion quickens.
How does the prevalent youthful skep
ticism regarding the official KMT goal of
"recovering the mainland" affect opinion
on other, second-level national policies?
A common complaint is about the gov
ernment's restrictions on literature —
"propaganda" in the KMT phrase — from
the mainland. Students who are not in
volved in sponsored research on com
munism, and have not, therefore, been
scrutinized for what one researcher cal
led political "maturity," find it difficult to
gain access to information from the main
land.
"Sometimes I resent the rule very
much. The government says we are loyal
and yet won't allow us to see both sides. I
want to know what the communists say,"
said a Taipei University senior.
"Maybe it's true that people outside
college would be influenced by it, but we
college students should not be held
back."
Government officials emphasized that
there is no dearth of "information" about
the mainland on Taiwan — all of it from
Western or Taiwan sources, of course.
They dismissed as useless lies material
from the communist government.
"I know they lie. My government puts
out propaganda, too. I just want to bave
the right to read it," said another student.
Beyond access to information, a few

students interviewed had a more
generalized objection to KMT policies.
One, a senior at National University in
Taipei, said that as today's youth begins
to inherit power from the aging KMT
hierarchy, it will demand changes making
Taiwan more democratic.
"The National Assembly (which elected
President Chiang Ching-kuo last month
with little opposition) is made up of old
men who haven t been elected since we
left the mainland," he said.
"They are using the martial law and the
threat of the Communists and saying 'We
can't be a democracy under these cir
cumstances.' "
Asked if he would characterize
Taiwan's government as a fascist one
which, since Chiang Kai-Shek's death in
1975, is becoming more democratic, he
agreed with reservations.
"It may have been fascist, but it is im
possible to be a real democracy when you
are fighting for your life. It's just that the
you nger people want to change the struc
ture so that they can have some influence
on the government.
"No one is watching the inefficiency of
the government's policies because no
body can get into power who isn't already
there."
Others strongly disagreed with the
term "fascist" but agreed that as 1949 re
cedes into history and the problems of
Taiwan as a de facto nation become more
complex, young Taiwanese will demand
the government open its processes.
"We can't keep the same government
forever, hoping to get back someday,"
said one student. "We have to make this
place we have strong and democratic."
