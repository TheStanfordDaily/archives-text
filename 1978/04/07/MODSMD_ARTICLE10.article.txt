# Letters on rights in Israel, Pakistan
## 
### 
Pakistani democracy aborted
Being an ardent supporter of the
great American philosophy that the
forefathers of this great nation prac
ticed, and a true believer in your out
cry against the death of human
rights, it is baffling for me to under
stand why this nation should con
sider the defense of human rights in
the communistic controlled coun
tries as a just cause, while injustice
and suffocation of the basic rights of
human beings in other parts of the
world, also go unchecked. Is it be
cause some people living in some
countries are humans, while others
are to be considered as just objects
of observation?
Why is it when some political or
literary figure is impounded in Rus
sia, there is an uproar in this nation
that even shakes the foundations of

the White House? Yet when one of
the most literary and political figures
of Asia faces a death sentence be
cause of his beliefsthereis not even a
stir to stop this injustice in a country
where American has such a powerful
influence. It is one thing to demand
acceptance of human rights from un
friendly Communist block countries,
but it is unacceptable that we can't
even convince our friends to honor
human rights.
In question is the death sentence
perpetrated on the former Prime
Minister of Pakistan, Zulfiquar AM
Bhutto, by a loaded court of which
the Chief Justice was a well known
figure of the opposition party. The
prosecution consisted entirely of
members of the opposition parties,
and the judgement was so precon
ceived that it was an open secret. It is
a slap in the face of justice and a
blatant defiance of the cause of
human rights.
Are we just going to preach the
philosophy of human rights, or are
we going to practice it also?

Placing blame hard
I deplore the loss of life in Lebanon
no less than Rachelle Marshall does
(Daily, April 4) but find it much har
der than she does to blame Israel for
having to defend its sovereignty and
citizenry.
Afterthe Entebbe rescue, an article
of hers was headed "Israeli raid no
solution," (Daily, July 9, 1976). Tell
that to the Jews of various
nationalities who were separated out
at Entebbe and told they'd be killed.
What's particularly irresponsible is
to brandish the Holocaust by brac
keting Israel's attack on terrorist
bases with Nazism's massacre of mill
ions throughout Europe. Far from re
calling Hitler's victims justly or com
passionately, such a misleading
comparison only exploits them.

What's more, to equate the PLO
with Irgun's 1940's campaign wholly
ignores historical distinctions; and
Irgun did not attack civi
lians, but warned them before
an operation. That PLO terrorism
has killed 1131 people and injured
2471 in the last 10 years should also
interest us.
The PLO revealed a crucial discre
pancy between ideals and practice
when they reported this recent kil
ling to their own people (and in Rus
sia) as a guerilla skirmish against Is
raeli soldiers. While I was in Israel in
1975, a PLO rocket landed one night
in a field next to my residential

district apartment. The PLO report
was of severe structural damage to
the Knesset.
If one is indignant about killing and
the withholding of political recogni
tion, one should di rect their indigna
tion towards the PLO and those who
abet it.
What would one write to the Daily
after half one's family had been
wiped out by terrorists blowing up a
Palo Alto school bus — terrorists in
filtrating from . . . well, from where?

passionately, such a misleading
comparison only exploits them.

What's more, to equate the PLO
with Irgun's 1940's campaign wholly
ignores historical distinctions; and
Irgun did not attack civi

an operation. That PLO terrorism

2471 in the last 10 years should also
interest us.
The PLO revealed a crucial discre

Pakistani democracy aborted
Being an ardent supporter of the
great American philosophy that the
forefathers of this great nation prac
ticed, and a true believer in your out
cry against the death of human
rights, it is baffling for me to under
stand why this nation should con
sider the defense of human rights in
the communistic controlled coun
tries as a just cause, while injustice
and suffocation of the basic rights of
human beings in other parts of the
world, also go unchecked. Is it be
cause some people living in some
countries are humans, while others
are to be considered as just objects
of observation?
Why is it when some political or
literary figure is impounded in Rus
sia, there is an uproar in this nation
that even shakes the foundations of

the White House? Yet when one of
the most literary and political figures
of Asia faces a death sentence be
cause of his beliefsthereis not even a
stir to stop this injustice in a country
where American has such a powerful
influence. It is one thing to demand
acceptance of human rights from un
friendly Communist block countries,
but it is unacceptable that we can't
even convince our friends to honor
human rights.
In question is the death sentence
perpetrated on the former Prime
Minister of Pakistan, Zulfiquar AM
Bhutto, by a loaded court of which
the Chief Justice was a well known
figure of the opposition party. The
prosecution consisted entirely of
members of the opposition parties,
and the judgement was so precon
ceived that it was an open secret. It is
a slap in the face of justice and a
blatant defiance of the cause of
human rights.
Are we just going to preach the
philosophy of human rights, or are
we going to practice it also?

Placing blame hard
I deplore the loss of life in Lebanon
no less than Rachelle Marshall does
(Daily, April 4) but find it much har
der than she does to blame Israel for
having to defend its sovereignty and
citizenry.
Afterthe Entebbe rescue, an article
of hers was headed "Israeli raid no
solution," (Daily, July 9, 1976). Tell
that to the Jews of various
nationalities who were separated out
at Entebbe and told they'd be killed.
What's particularly irresponsible is
to brandish the Holocaust by brac
keting Israel's attack on terrorist
bases with Nazism's massacre of mill
ions throughout Europe. Far from re
calling Hitler's victims justly or com
passionately, such a misleading
comparison only exploits them.

What's more, to equate the PLO
with Irgun's 1940's campaign wholly
ignores historical distinctions; and
Irgun did not attack civi
