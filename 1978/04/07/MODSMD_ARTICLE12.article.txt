# Presbyterian Church considers ordination of homosexuals

John Calvin would be chag
rined.
The Presbyterian Church of
America, sculpted by his prin
ciples, is haggling over the or
dination of avowed homosex
uals.
In May, representatives of
the 2.6 million-member church
will meet in San Diego for a
national convention where
they will vote on the report of a
task force that has recom
mended allowing homosexu
als to enter the ministry.
Should the General Assem
bly approve the report despite
stiffening opposition, the Pre
sbyterian Church would be the
largest church in America to
take such a "liberal" stance.
"It'll go down, it'll go down
hard," said WalterGerber, pas
tor of Menlo Park Presbyterian
Church which is officially op
posed to the report.
Gerber, who will be a dele
gate to the convention, said
that even the inner city
churches in San Francisco,
"the gay center of the world,"
are "diametrically opposed" to
the report.
But after spending 15
months and $70,000 to chart
"Christian approaches to
homosexuality," the majority
of the task force concluded:
"For some homosexual
Christians growth toward ma
ture Christian living may imply

accepting celibacy; for some it
may imply accomplishing
reorientation to heterosexual
ity; however, for others it may
imply remaining open to or at
taining full companionship and
partnership with a person of
the same sex."
The task force described
homosexuality as "strong, en
during, not consciously cho
sen and usually irreversible."
A minority report radically
dissented.
"It is neither a gift from God
nor a state or a condition like
race; it is a result of man's fal
len condition," this report
stated.
"This has more potential to
split the church than anything
since slavery and the Civil
War," Rev. Don Williams, pro
fessor of religion at Claremont
Men's College, told the Los
Angeles Times recently.

"It is a major departure in the
history of the Christian
church," he added.
But the issue may have some
surprising side effects.
"Issues like this make me
even more desirous of getting
into the Presbyterian minis
try," said Don Barton, a Stan
ford student who is applying to
be taken "under care" by the
San Francisco Presbytery.
The church should discrimi
nate in this case and not ordain
homosexuals, he said.
"But I think the church
should be against hiring liars
and thieves and people who
hate and don't repent of these
things," Barton added.
The controversy began two
years ago when a lesbian asked
to be ordained by the New
York Presbytery. The presbyt
ery, a regional unit of

churches, raised the issue at
the 188 th General Assembly.
Classifying homosexuality as
a "sin," the Assembly said or
daining avowed homosexuals
would "at the present time be
injudicious if not improper."
But it sanctioned a study
"with special reference to the
ordination of avowed practic
ing homosexuals. . . ."
"That was probably a mis
take," said Gerber. He said the
appellate structures of a
hierarchical church like the
Presbyterians' make it suscep
tible to small, publicity
hunting pressure groups.
The church was forced to
make this move by a "caucus"
of gays which forms one of the
groups that "keeps rattling the
cage and blaspheming the
name of Christ," Gerber said.
The committee, composed
of experts in psychiatry,
sociology, ethics, theology,
biblical interpretation and law,
was "stacked," Gerber
claimed.
"They had a homosexual on
it,"he said. "It wasn't even
representative."
He added that the leadership

of the church is prone to play
into the hands of caucuses.
"It's a real fringe group that
controls the upper echelon of
the church," he said.
In recent years, church offi
cials have drawn heat from
member churches for earmark
ing funds to defend Angela
Davis and to support political
groups in Latin America.
These executive "crackpots"
are out "to learn their iden
tities instead of doing the work
of the church," said Rev. Harry
Wooding, of the First Presbyte
rian Church in Mountain View.
He said his congregation is
"110 per cent against" the or
dination of homosexuals and is
withdrawing contributions to
the church's national treasury
"until peace, unity and sanity
return to the church."
But the Covenant Presbyte
rian Church of Palo Alto is
more congenial to the task
force's verdict. "The mood of
the church is generally suppor
tive," said Pastor Don Mason.
If the General Assembly
adopts the majority report, it
would not force local churches
to ordain homosexuals.

"It would nevertheless,
make it illegal to make
homosexuality an issue," said
Dr. Clifford Smith, former pas
tor of the Menlo Park Presbyte
rian Church in his report on the
church's national constitution.
"A presbytery could not leg
ally make homosexuality a
reason for refusal to ordain a
candidate nor could a local
congregation make homosex
uality a reason for not calling a
pastor," he said.
"I'd just as soon let each pre
sbytery deal with each pros
pective candidate on his own
merit," he added.
Smith said he believes this
condition might open the way
for civil suits to be brought
against the church for depriv
ing homosexuals of their right
to be ordained.
But Mason said he thought
"the separation of church and
state" would prevent that.
Smith also objects to the re
port calling homosexuality "a
minor theme" in Scripture be
cause "it is not mentioned by
any of the prophets or by Jesus
Himself."
The report says Leviticus 18

and 20 and Romans 1:18-3:20
"appear potentially enlighten
ing," but do not conclusively
prove that the writers con
demned modern homosexual
lifestyles.
"It implies that the Holy
Spirit did not guide the writers
of these passages, or, if He did,
that He was wrong," said
Smith. "Our Constitution
teaches otherwise."
"People interpret the Bible
in quite a few different ways,"
said Mason, who added his
people have done their
"homework" on the issue in a
recent five-week Bible study.
"It's an issue where those
who haven't studied the Scrip
tures are guided so much by
their emotions that there
would be a backlash on either
side," he said.
Though he believes the con
troversy jolted some of his lib
eral members out of their slide
away from the authority of the
Bible, Pastor Gerber looks war
ily at the trend it reflects.
"When a nation gets
homosexually decadent, his
torically that's the last sign of
decadence," he said.
