Who pays for the dinners eaten hy the Daily's
restaurant reviewers?
The meals are provided free of charge by the
restaurants in return for a review. The Daily cop
tacts the restaurant, and if it responds favorably,
a reviewer is sent to eat there. Afterward, the
Daily sends two copies of the review to the re
staurant.
In the past, there have been problems with
persons who pretended to be Daily staffers in
order to receive a free meal. Thus, a new system
which includes written correspondence and
acknowledgment cards has been implemented
in order to decrease the number of impostors.
If you're interested in becoming a restaurant
reviewer, contact Laura Clark at the Daily — you
might get a free meal in return for a review.

I took the opportunity to wander around the
nearly completed Hoover Building a few nights
ago, and it suddenly dawned on me that I don't
really know what its purpose is.

For what will the new building be used? Will
students be allowed access to any of the
facilities, even just to look around?

Dennis Spellmire, facilities coordinator for
the Hoover Institution, said the new building
will be "primarily a research building." Most of
it will contain private offices for the National
Fellows, Domestic Studies Staff, and Associate
Directors. Hoover Institution Archives will also
go into the new building.
Persons who previously had access to the arc
hives will still be allowed in, but otherwise
Spellmire said, "it is not an open building." This
in part due to the large amount of private office
space. So you can look, but you'll be doing most
of it from the outside.
