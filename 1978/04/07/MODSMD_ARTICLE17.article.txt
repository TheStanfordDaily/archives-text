# Construction of Albers' Wall to begin this summer
## 
### Susan Larsen 
With all the controversy
raised last year over the loca
tion site for the relief donated
by sculptor Josef Albers, many
students have been unaVvareof
the story behind its donation
and the process involved in its
construction. *
Albers was contacted in 1971
by a private collector in
terested in purchasing his first
design fora free-standing work
of art. Albers refused the col
lector's offer, saying he
"wanted the sculpture to go to
a university, to be part of a
community, rather than some
one's private property," ac
cording to Art History Profes
sor Albert Elsen.
The collector then asked Al
bers if he would consider a
West Coast university, and Al
bers assented because he
wanted to be represented on
the West Coast. The collector
contacted Elsen, who then
contacted Albers to ask if he
would consider donating the
sculpture to Stanford.
Albers agreed, on the condi
tion that the University pro
vided all the funds to build the
sculpture and "a site with
prominence, dignity and sec
urity," according to Elsen.
After six years spent refining
and engineering the design,

fundraising, and deciding on a
suitable site, construction is
scheduled to begin "early this
summer," according to Roger
Cairns, senior planner of
facilities and properties.
Albers' only connection with
the sculpture was the design
itself.
Once Albers finished the de
sign, he gave it to Los Angeles
architect Craig Elwood, who
did the interior structure of the
54-foot, six-inch by eight-foot
BVi-inch wall.
Drawing
Then Robert Mittelstadt,
hired to oversee the actual
construction of the sculpture
by Delcon Associates of Hay
ward, did the engineering
drawing. Mittelstadt, formerly
a Stanford architecture profes
sor, is now head of Cal Poly's
architecture department.
Everyone involved with the
design and construction of Al
bers' wall is "a skilled profes
sional," stated Elsen.
"Albers' design is an unfor
giving one," he continued. "It
leaves no leeway for error —
every row of brick must be ab
solutely horizontal.
"The polished slabs of black
granite can be no more than
one-sixteenth of an inch away
from being exactly perpen
dicular to the ground. It's a

very complicated design — not
at all a simple thing to build,"
said Elsen.
Granite panels
One side of the sculpture
consists of 18 panels of black
granite which must be cut and
polished to provide a straight
flat plane on which to mount
four polygonal designs in one
inch bars of stainless steel.
These polygons must be
"very carefully welded" in the
artist's studio, explained
Cairns. "It's too fine a process
to be done on the construction
site. Then all the welds must be
polished and the whole thing
must be transported from the
studio to the site without
breaking, bending, or splitting
anything."
The sculpture's other face is
white brick with thin steel bars
of dark, anodyzed steel
mounted in the joint between
the bricks.
The bars differ in length, but
must be cut so that their ends
match the bricks' ends.
Reasons for delay
One reason for the delayed
construction date is "very few
artists work in stainless steel,"
said Cairns.
Bruce Beasley, the Oakland
sculptor hired to do the weld
ing and preparation of the steel
designs, had "prior commit

ments to other works of art"
and could not start on the Al
bers' sculpture until this sum
mer.
Beasley had not expected to
be free until next October, and
the University had tried to find
another artist, but "we
couldn't find anyone else cap
able of the work," Cairns
explained.
Previous delays were due to
difficulties in fundraising and
agreeing on a site for the
sculpture. While Elsen was try
ing to raise money for the
sculpture's construction, Stan
ford was engaged in a $300 mill
ion campaign for other needs.
Eventually the Josef Albers
foundation, a private organiza
tion established shortly before
Albers' death, contributed a lit
tle more than half the $100,000
needed.
The other half of the money
came from "private sources
outside the University," ac
cording to Elsen.
Location
Controversy over the site
also delayed the project, but
the grass hexagon between the
Physics Tank and the outer
Quad was finally chosen. The
wall will lie on a diagonal
bisecting the hexagon at a
midpoint.
"Placing the wall on the
diagonal is a more dramatic
way of focusing the sculpture
within the mall and will make it
seem less of a barrier," said
Elsen.
The wall is placed roughly
east and west so that both sides
will receive light all day long,
according to Elsen.
"There will be some
shadows and highlights as the
steel elements will pick up sun
light, and there will be change
throughout the day,"he ad
ded.
Practical
However, the materials
selected for the sculpture have
practical as well as aesthetic
appeal.
"We hope that because of
these materials it will be easier
to keep the sculptureclean and
in good condition," explained
Elsen. "We are fortunate in that
the type of granite we are using
holds its color well."
The materials being used are

stainless and anodyzed steel,
black granite from Africa, and a
special white brick. Due to the
delays, the white marble brick
was no longer available, so a
similar brick was substituted.
"A great deal of thought and
time have gone into the pro
ject," remarked Elsen. One
reason for its "great cost" is the
tremendous amount of steel
used in the sculpture's interior
ribbing to fortify it against ear
thquakes.
Completion
"This is considered an ex
traordinary work of art — I
know of no other similar,"
Cairns said. "It's difficult to
predict how long construction
will take because there's no
precedent. Ideally, if every

thing went well, the sculpture
could be completed in two
months, but we've never con
structed a fine work of art on
campus before."
Albers has designed large
bas-reliefs for other institu
tions, such as Hanover, Har
vard and Yale Universities, but
the relief to be built here is his
only free-standing work, ac
cording to Elsen.
"Albers was best-known as a
painter — his paintings are very
easy to visualize," explained
Elsen. "They're a series of con
centric squares, each of which
is a different color. Albers did
over 100 with the same format
and title, "Homage to the
Square," but each was diffe
rent because of the use of

color.
"Stanford has some of Al
bers' prints, but none of his
paintings," said Elsen. "It is the
hope of the sponsors of the
wall that after the sculpture is
completed, it may be possible
to bring to the University Al
bers' archives and a represen
tative selection of his paint
ings."
According to Elsen, Albers
intended no symbolism when
he designed the sculpture.
"It's not a homage to math or
engineering, simply the result
of about 60 years of making art
and research into the use of
straight lines, color, space, and
irrational types of perspec
tive."

The relief which has been donated to the University by sculptor Josef Albers will be built midway between
the Physics Tank and the Quad at an angle such that both sides will receive light. According to the
University's Senior Planner Roger Cairns, construction will begin this summer and may take only two
months to complete.
