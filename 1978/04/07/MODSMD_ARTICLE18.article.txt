# California Highway Patrol
## Women succeeding as officers 
### 
Sacramento (AP)—Women will never be in the
California Highway Patrol (CHP) because they
couldn't handle hazards like shootouts, Dan
Lanza, then deputy CHP commissioner, said five
years ago.
"A woman will just not be able to cope with
situations like that as we are finding many times
that a man cannot cope with them," he said.
But four years after his statement, CHP officer
Janet Cray of Barstow shot a man who had dis
armed her male partner at a remote abandoned
desert gas station.
"Our people and our administrators in our
organization recognized fully that women have
a place in law enforcement and are working to
place women," Commissioner Glen Craig says
now.
The CHP now has 24 womep riding in patrol
cars, giving out traffic tickets and taking risks
along with 5110 men. Some 15 other women are
among 191 cadets now going through the CHP
Academy's grueling 20-week course.The patrol
now has more than 2400 applications of still
more young women who want to don the brown
uniform.
The CHP was among the first police organiza
tions in the country to hire women for patrol
jobs, preceeded by Michigan, Illinois, Pennsyl
vania and New York. In the last two years, most
other states have been tentatively adding wo
men, allowing them to do the same jobs as men.
"The attitude of law enforcement adminis
trators in many states is maybe they can do the
job, but you wouldn't want to put those little
girls out on the road alone," Craig said.
The CHP is putting "those little girls," all of
whom have passed the same Academy fitness
tests as men, on the road alone in cruisers, and

officers and drivers alike are surprised to find
they can do the job, Craig said.
There's still some resistence among old-line
officers, he admits, but mostly in areas that ha
ven't yet had women officers.
The CHP began its campaign to hire women in
1974, a year after Lanza's remark and a year after
Jennie Schulteis of Sacramento filed a federal
discrimination suit against the CHP.
In 1974, Craig recalls, there was little informa
tion anywhere on how women could perform as
police officers.
"We looked at what other states had done. At
the time we looked, very tew police agencies
had women on road patrol without having a man
along or without putting them on special details,
like jail, vice or juveniles."
So the CHP undertook a two-year study, be
ginning with a test class of 40 women and 40 men
that started through the old Sacramento
Academy on Sept. 30, 1974.
The qualifications are the same for men and
women: 20 to 31 years old, 5 feet 6 inches to 6
feet 6 inches tall, weight in proportion to height,
high school graduate, good hearing and vision.
Candidates take a written examination and phys
ical agility test.
In January 1975, 27 women and 31 men
graduated and received their first assignments. '•
The study conclusion was that all cadets, male
and female, had reached an adequate level of
physical strength.
Thirteen of the original 27 women graduates
are still in the CHP. Eleven women graduated
from the first two classes to go through the new
Academy in Yolo County last year.
With its 2400 applicants, the CHP is looking for
women to fill its future classes.

The CHP was among the first police organiza
tions in the country to hire women for patrol
jobs, preceeded by Michigan, Illinois, Pennsyl
vania and New York. In the last two years, most
other states have been tentatively adding wo
men, allowing them to do the same jobs as men.
"The attitude of law enforcement adminis
trators in many states is maybe they can do the
job, but you wouldn't want to put those little
girls out on the road alone," Craig said.
The CHP is putting "those little girls," all of
whom have passed the same Academy fitness
tests as men, on the road alone in cruisers, and

officers and drivers alike are surprised to find
they can do the job, Craig said.
There's still some resistence among old-line
officers, he admits, but mostly in areas that ha
ven't yet had women officers.
The CHP began its campaign to hire women in
1974, a year after Lanza's remark and a year after
Jennie Schulteis of Sacramento filed a federal
discrimination suit against the CHP.
In 1974, Craig recalls, there was little informa
tion anywhere on how women could perform as
police officers.
"We looked at what other states had done. At
the time we looked, very tew police agencies
had women on road patrol without having a man
along or without putting them on special details,
like jail, vice or juveniles."
So the CHP undertook a two-year study, be
ginning with a test class of 40 women and 40 men
that started through the old Sacramento
Academy on Sept. 30, 1974.
The qualifications are the same for men and
women: 20 to 31 years old, 5 feet 6 inches to 6
feet 6 inches tall, weight in proportion to height,
high school graduate, good hearing and vision.
Candidates take a written examination and phys
ical agility test.
In January 1975, 27 women and 31 men
graduated and received their first assignments. '•
The study conclusion was that all cadets, male
and female, had reached an adequate level of
physical strength.
Thirteen of the original 27 women graduates
are still in the CHP. Eleven women graduated
from the first two classes to go through the new
Academy in Yolo County last year.
With its 2400 applicants, the CHP is looking for
women to fill its future classes.
