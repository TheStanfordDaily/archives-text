# Muscular dystrophy
## Couples dance to raise money 
### Kathy Trafton 
Plans for the first annual Stanford Uni
versity Dance-A-Thon, designed to benefit
the local Muscular Dystrophy Association
(MDA), are in their final stages.
Everyone here including students, fa
culty and staff is encouraged to dance for
money at an eight-hour party that will be
held later this month in the Inner Quad.
Each cOuple that participates is asked to
raise a minimum of $125 in sponsorship.
Sponsors can be anything from organiza
tions, businesses and dormitories to indi
vidual people.
The evening is being presented by a
number of campus groups including the
ASSU, the Black Students Union, the
Council of Presidents, the Interfraternity
Council (IFC), the Intersorority Council,
KZSU, the Senior Class Presidents and the
Stanford Daily.
$10,000 target
All of the net proceeds from the evening
will be donated to the local chapter of the
MDA for the support of local research and
patient care programs that provide free
services to victims. The program target is
to raise $10,000 and all of the money raised
will be spent in the local community.
The MDA's local patient services budget
this year will exceed $75,000. Over the past
four years the MDA has spent over
$250,000 on research at the Stanford Uni
versity Medical Center and the Children's
Hospital.
Muscular dystrophy is a term that refers
to a group of chronic diseases that results
in the progressive degeneration of the
skeletal or voluntary muscles.
The most common form of the disease
attacks children between ages two to six,
when youngsters first gain muscular con
trol. The muscular degeneration proceeds
from the appearance of uncoordination to
a state of helplessness. Death occurs 10 to
15 years later when the muscle degenera
tion causes respiratory or heart failure.

Victims rarely survive their teens.
The causes of muscular dystrophy are
hereditary but they are not entirely under
stood. So far, a successful treatment to
correct either the underlying pathology or
the relentless progression of the disease
has not yet been developed. Fortunately,
progress has been made in the search for a
cure.
Researchers now are "at the point of
trying to understand the causes and are
trying to find chemicals to cure the ill
ness," according to Dr. Alan Kelts, assis
tant professor of neurology.
However, it is important to realize that
"muscular dystrophy affects just as many
adults as it does children," said Kelts.
Coordinating committee
The coordinating committee that is or
ganizing the dance is comprised of 14
people. The committee went through a
bureaucratic maze to get the project ap
proved by the University. There were legal
proceedings and there was the problem of
where to hold the dance.
Many other universities throughout the
nation have organized dance-a-thons and
dance marathons to raise money for re
search into muscular dystrophy. Some of
the colleges have sponsored dance
marathons lasting 60 to 70 hours,
Thompson said.
The coordinating committee decided
against a dance marathon because "No
body would do it here," |ere Thompson,
chairman of the committee, said.
Enthusiastic response
Thompson said campus and community
response to the project has been en
thusiastic.
Each campus residence is asked to raise
enough money to support two couples â€”
$250. Many groups have devised imagina
tive methods of getting the money.
For example, Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity and Kappa Kappa Gamma soror
ity are putting on a pancake breakfast.

Some sororities will be holding bake sales
in White Plaza. Other houses will seek
money through friends and family.
Prizes
If net proceeds reach $15,000 or more,
the organization that raises the most
money can send a representative to Las
Vegas to present a check to Jerry Lewis on
his nationally televised Labor Day Tele
thon.
No matter what the net proceeds are,
the single couple that raises the most
sponsorship money wins five days and
four nights, including room, ski rental and
lift tickets, at Snowbird ski resort in Utah.
Other prizes for top fundraising couples
and organizations will include bicycles,
radios, tickets and dinners. Prizes will be
awarded for the amount of money raised
by 11 p.m. on April 28. And there will be
raffles.
Free food
During the dance itself, free food and
liquid refreshments will be provided for
participants by certain corporate spon
sors. There will be three diverse rock
bands to play that will be donating their
time and effort free of charge.
Thompson said he is hoping for several
thousand people to show up at the
Dance-A-Thon, for even non-participants
are invited to the affair to dance, watch
and party. Cooperation for the dance is
being provided by the IFC, which has
promised that no rush functions will take
place that night.
The only conflict, according to
Thompson, is with the play "Music Man."
He said special arrangements will be made
for participants whose dormitories have
purchased block seats.
Anyone who wishes to be in the
Dance-A-Thon should contact his dormit
ory representative or call 497-4331 for de
tails and an information packet. Particip
ants should work on getting sponsors
early.
