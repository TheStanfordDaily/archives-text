# Bargaining over bodies in Lebanon
## 
### Associated Press 
Palestinian guerrillas claimed yes
terday they were holding bodies of
Israeli soldiers killed in an incident
inside a guerrilla-held portion of
southern Lebanon. Sources said they
would try to bargain for the body of a
female terrorist who led the March 11
highway attack inside Israel that
touched off the big Israeli push into
Lebanon.
Conflicting reports of the number
of dead ranged from three to five, the
first Israeli casualties reported since
a cease-fire was declared March 21.
Israel claimed the guerrillas had am
bushed an Israeli jeep Wednesday
four miles south of the port of Tyre.
Diplomatic sources at the United
Nations reported that the 21-nation
Arab bloc will call for a Security
Council meeting to consider possi
ble sanctions against Israel for refus
ing to remove its troops.
In lerusalem, a U.N. spokesman
said Israel yesterday had presented a
plan for partial withdrawal of its
forces.
Israel reported three dead in the
Wednesday ambush. Palestinian
guerrillas in Beirut claimed four were
slain and one captured "unharmed,"
and the United Nations said its re
ports indicated all five were killed.
The Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion claimed the jeep was an Israeli
patrol trying to infiltrate guerrilla
held positions, and sources said the
PLO would try to bargain for the
body of Dalai Mograbi, 22, the
female guerrilla who led the March
11 terrorist attack inside Israel.
