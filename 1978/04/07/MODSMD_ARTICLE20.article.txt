## Latin American cookbook raises funds for research 
### Beth Connor 
Food. Thoughts of it underscore the lives of
gourmets and indiscriminates alike. We're all in
constant vursuit of new ways to eat and new
food to cook. Stanford's Center for Latin Ameri
can Studies has developed an original idea in
food preparation — a Latin American cookbook
entitled "Comida Latina."
Plans for the cookbook were first devised
when the Center's director, Professor John
Wirth, decided the Center needed a new idea
for raising funds for the undergraduate summer
research program sponsored by the Latin
Amsrican Studies Department. Wirth claims the
undergraduate program is one of the specialties
of the department.
The program is open to all undergraduate
students here on a competitive basis, said
Wirth. The number of students selected to par
ticipate "all depends on the quality of the applic
ants," he added, but usually about four students
are chosen.
Honors work
The students interested in the program must
work under a faculty member spring quarter
designing their research project and determin
ing its feasibility, then carry out the project dur
ing their summer in Latin America and write up
the project results autumn quarter as an honors
thesis, Wirth explained.
This summer four students will be going to
Mexico, Brazil and Colombia to research topics

including migration to the United States, the
impact of oil and gas, and banking.
According to Wirth, the summer-abroad
program is "an unequalled educational experi
ence and a rare personal opportunity." His in
terest in building greater support for the prog
ram prompted creation of the cookbook.
What started out as a fundraising project last
spring became, as Wirth put it, "a helluva lot of
fun."
Students, faculty and staff from the Stanford
community who are related to Latin America
cooperated in the effort by providing their favo
rite Latin recipes.
The book includes soups, seafood, main
dishes and "others" (like Buckaroo Stew) — all
tried and true family recipes.
Sales profits
Wirth said the program costs the Center about
$5000 to sponsor. Since the cookbooks went on
sale in November, almost all of the 800 copies
have been sold, for a profit of almost $2000,
Wirth added.
"The cookbook sales have really given that
program an extra boost of money. I'm just de
lighted," said Wirth.
Wirth also said the sales have been greater
than expected and he is optimistically anticipat
ing a second edition.
The cookbook can be pure hased for $3 at the
Stanford Bookstore or at Bolivar House, 582 Al
varado Row.
