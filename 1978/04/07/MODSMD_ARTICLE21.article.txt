# Publishing course to be offered
## 
### 
The Stanford Alumni Associ
ation, following a trend of pro
viding "continuing education"
for Stanford graduates, will
offer a course in publishing
July 9 to 22.
Stanford Magazine editor
Delia van Heyst will direct the
program, which will offer in
tensive training in magazine
and book publishing for recent
college graduates, profession
als already working in publish
ing or persons interested in
switching to careers in publish
ing.
"We feel that this type of
course is a necessary function
of the Alumni Association
since the University prefers to
concentrate solely on degree
programs. What we're doing is
acknowledging the need for
further education," van Heyst
said.
Open guidelines
Van Heyst said the
guidelines for acceptance to
the program "are kind of wide
open."
"We want to try to weed out
the dilettantes who just want to
spend a summer playing
around. We wantourpeopleto
be alert, able to grasp the es
sence of the industry through
the assignments and able to ar
ticulate their desires and cur
rent skills," she said.
With the April 15 application
deadline bearing down, van
Heyst said the majority of

applicants are current profes
sionals and other "non
student" types. For this
reason, she said the recent col
lege graduates who apply will
have to "demonstrate a clear
interest in the field."
Three aspects
The course will spend inten
sive time on three aspects of
publishing: editorial, design
and finance, and marketing. All
the workshops will be taught
by professionals currently
working in publishing, many of
whom have contacts with Stan
ford.
There are currently a
number of courses in bookand
magazine publishing, most
notably the Radcliffe Publish
ing Procedures Course, which
enters its 31st year this sum
mer.
However, the course here
will concentrate solely on West
Coast publishing, something
not offered by most of the
other programs.
Differences
"There are major differences
between publishing in the East
and the West," van Heyst said.
"There is more opportunity in
the East, but there are more
than 1000 publishers in the
West. Most of them are much
smaller, but still have all the
elements in publishing," she
said.
"What we want to offer is the
flavor of West Coast publish

ing," she said.
Participants in the course
will "come away with a know
ledge of the complex nature of
publishing house," she said.
"Just getting to know the jar
gon and the structure can be a
tremendous help in securing a
job."
Not job placement
However, van Heyst em
phasized that the Alumni As
sociation is not in the job
placement business. Since
many of the participants will al
ready be working profession

als, there will be much contact
between persons seeking
employment and those who
would be in the position to hire.
Van Heyst said the program
would include one day de
voted to careers, especially
such issues as resume prepara
tion and application proce
dures.
Tuition for the 13-day course
is $425, which includes books,
working materials, field trips
and lunches. Housing space in
Roble Hall will be reserved for
a nominal fee.
