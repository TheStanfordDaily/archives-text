# Campaign funding
## Big bucks, big rules, big headaches

Price tags on political cam
paigns may be higher today
than price tags on groceries,
homes or education. The
amount of political dollars
needed to win competitive
state elections alone, has
skyrocketed into the six-digit
category.
Political office prospects
look dimmest for non
incumbent challengers, ac
cording to Michael Cobb, party
chairman for the Santa Clara
County Republicans.
"There are three classes of
candidates: the incumbents,
the already-rich and the
already-well-known," he said.
"Incumbency has a built-in
dollar value."
If a candidate is not an in
cumbent, an astronaut, an heir
to a great fortune or a movie
star, he must virtually "buy of
fice" by going to the media,
Cobb asserts.
Horribly expensive
"The media is horribly, hor
ribly expensive," he added. "If
you don't start talking
$100,000, you're not going to
mount a really credible cam
paign."
Cobb should know. Fie is at
the helm of an organization
which is the county's financial
and political underdog. Yet it
must force two Democrat in
cumbents from office in
November in order to turn
county tables even the
slightest bit.
The incumbents are state
Sen. Arlen Cregorio (D-Menlo
Park), and Assemblyman Vic
tor Calvo (D-Mountain View).
The price tag on campaigns for
Republican opponents in each
of these races should run at
least 50 per cent higher than
those of the incumbents, Cobb
said.
Although it is a party whose
candidates were once said to
have been nominated by the
Chase-Manhattan National
Bank, the local GOP looks
quite different now. Nowhere
is the lack of funds more evi
dent than at county headquar
ters.
In debt
"There was a point in De
cember," Cobb recalled,
"when we were down to $19 in
our checking account." That
moment followed the commit

tee's purchase of a county of
fice building, leaving the COP
Central Committee with a new
$65,000 debt. But fortunately
for local COP candidates, the
county coffers are never used
for campaign funding.
In addition to the obstacles
of incumbency and party pov
erty, Cobb said, is the new
campaign fund disclosure law
in California which provides
that background information
and dollar amounts he dis
closed for all campaign con
tributors.
"The election process has
been aided and abetted by
campaign laws which make it
all the tougher to beat Democ
rat incumbents," he said. "The
law simply further entrenched
the people who were al ready in
office," he added.
"They're killing us," he said,
referring to legislators who
created the law.
Bogs 'em down
Cobb said that extensive dis
closure requirements bog
down party administration and
turn away potential con
tributors, building in a more
disadvantageous leverage for
the COP and making their
"sucker list" shorter than ever.
On the other hand, Brian
O'Toole, GOP assistant trea
surer, said the law may be use
ful in determining the sources
of the more than $8 million
spent in the 1976 election and
in measuring the cost of
California elections state-wide.
A 1976 study by the state Fair
Political Practices Commission
(FPPC) shows, for example,
that incumbents out-spent
non-incumbents by a three
to-one margin in 1976, and that
winners spent about double
the amount put out by losing
candidates.
The FPPC estimates the me
dian cost of a competitive as

sembly campaign at $70,571. To
run for a competitive seat in
the state senate, the report
shows a major party candidate
should expect to put out
$97,608.
That was in 1976. Adjusted
for inflation, those figures may
read at nearly $80,000 and
$110,000 in 1978, and even
higher for incumbent challen
gers.
No guarantee
Moreover, there is no
guarantee that any amount will
purchase a victory. In 1976,
David Harris spent $157,226, in
his race for Congress. This was
nearly $50,000 more than com
peting incumbent Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park).
But nevertheless, Harris lost by
a two-to-one margin.
Harris, having just paid off
his $9000 campaign debt, said
recently he could not justify
another attempt to replace the
incumbent McCloskey, due to
the time and money required
for a successful campaign. But
if he were to run again, he said
he would devote his time and
money "much more wisely."
Harris' campaign bankroll
was high because he belonged
to the "already-known" class
of candidates, Cobb said.
Fund-raising for him was not
the near-insumountable task it
is for most office-seekers, be
cause he already had high
name identification in the 12th
Congressional district, he ad
ded.
Not easy
Starting rrom scratch is not
easy, no matter how bright or
well-qualified a candidate may
be, Cobb asserted.
"I would say that 15 per cent
of the people who were voting
for Gov. Jerry Brown thought
they were voting for his
father," Cobb said. "If you go
out and do some polling at the

average level, you'll find that
incumbents have about 20 per
cent name identification, and
the challengers are starting at
zero."
Without built-in name iden
tification, candidates may have
to shell out money for ads and
mailings. Costs run up to $2000
per newspaper page, $500 per
series of radio spots and
thousands of dollars in postage
for brochures and production,
Cobb calculated.
Insurmountable
Given these seemingly in
surmountable conditions plus
the fact that "the Republican
coffers are never full," as Bob
Walker, director of GOP
county headquarters said, how
can local candidates manage to
raise enough money to thwart
incumbents?
Laddie Hughes, Gregorio's
Republican challenger, said
she is already tapping the "fat
cat" and "little guy" donors
through herfriends, neighbors
and relatives. She said she may
later ask the state central
committee for help.
"I will solicit but that is not to
say that I will get," she said.
Cobb predicts that Hughes
must spend $60,000 to $70,000
to win the seat.
Another Republican chal
lenger, Greg Morris, who said
he will quit his law practice in
May to run against Calvo, may
need "over $100,000 to win,"
O'Toole predicted. But Morris,
whose campaign is based on
"the man" rather than "the
party," may try a more elabo
rate tactic, Cobb said.
Democrat Jesse Unruh, state
treasurer, once referred to
money as "the mother's milk of
politics." In keeping with the
theme, Morris may try to
"milk" his supporters by win
ing and dining them at $50 per
plate, Cobb suggested.
