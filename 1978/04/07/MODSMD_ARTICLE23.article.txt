# Windmills: energy alternative
## 
### 
National Geographic News Service
Washington — A modern generation of giant
machines that run on air and make electricity
may help keep America going as oil, gas, and
coal run out.
They're called windmills. And already the
world's biggest — a 200-kilowatt wind turbine,
as engineers call it — is reaping the winds whirl
ing over Clayton, N.M.
It introduces a family of wind turbines to be
set up in the United States during the next few
years, one to sweep the air with blades measur
ing 300 feet tip to tip — the length of a football
field.
Even bigger ones, generating as much as 3000
kilowatts, may come later, the National Geog
raphic Society has learned.
Slicing the air
The idea is to generate electricity for com
munity use and eventually at costs competitive
with the rates of power produced by burning

fossil fuels, today about 1 to 2 cents per
kilowatt-hour.
The Department of Energy picked Clayton,
with a population of some 3000, as a site for the
new turbine because it has a lot of wind and
because the town now generates electric power
only with oil trucked a long distance.
The giant windmill is visible for miles across
the flat sagebrush country, the turbine perched
atop a 100-foot tower and turned by what looks
like a huge airplane propeller with the two
blades slicing a 125-foot circle through the clean
air.
It revolves 40 times a minute, generating up to
200 kilowatts of power when the wind blows 18
to 34 miles an hour, enough for 35 to 80 homes.
The Clayton turbine is the first intended for
community service. When the wind drops
below about 10 miles an hour, the oil-fired
generators go into action.
