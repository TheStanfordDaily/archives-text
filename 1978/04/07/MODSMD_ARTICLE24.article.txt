# Stiff challenge
## Netters open Pac-8 
### Pete Snell 
How would you feel as a ten
nis coach if you: 1) had
everyone returning from last
year's No. 1 nationally-ranked
team? 2) added a Wimbledon
semifinalist who is currently
the 10th-ranked U.S. men's
singles player? 3) and had last
year's NCAA singles champion
returning but managing to land
only the no. 4 spot on your
team?
Pretty pleased, probably.
And although Stanford
men's coach Dick Gould is ecs
tatic about his team's potential,
he is concerned about how his
team will perform this
weekend as it heads down to
Los Angeles for what Gould
calls "the biggest weekend of
the year."
Today the Cards will face the
ever improving USC Trojans
(ranked No. 10 in the nation)
who last week knocked off No.
4 Southern Methodist Univer
sity 8-1. Gould said, "USC
started slow this year and re
ceived the relatively poor na
tional ranking but as of late
they've been playing very welj
and with a lot of confidence."
The Trojans are led by
freshman Robert Van t'Hof and
senior Chris Lewis who last
year was an NCAA semifinalist
in singles. The Cards lost 6-3 to
the Trojans last year and if they
overlook USC for the tougher
UCLA, they could lose again.
UCLA tough
The match against formida
ble UCLA will be on Saturday.
The courts at Westwood have
just been resurfaced (they are
hardcourts), making them very
slow and along with the home
court fans will give the Bruins a
big boost.
Although Gould feels that
"against USC we should be a
slight favorite, against UCLA
we have no better than a 50-50

chance." Part of Gould's con
cern is because of John McEn
roe's continued illness and a
leg injury to Perry Wright.
"Mac" has strep throat and
Wright has a knee strain that is
na gg' n g but not serious
enough to require surgery.
The match against the Bruins
will feature the nation's two
best freshman phenoms:
McEnroe vs. Eliot Telscher who
is ranked No. 23 in the nation.
In their last meeting, he de
feated McEnroe on hardcourt
in the L.A. Open. McEnroe de
feated Telscher earlier in the
year but that was on clay.
The rest of UCLA's squad is
impressive. At No. 2 position
they will field John Austin, the
brother of 15-year-old sensa
tion Tracy, and at third singles
they will have Tony Graham,
the man that Matt Mitchell de
feated for the NCAA singles
crown last June.
At the fourth and fifth posi
tions the Bruins are particularly
solid, with Robby Ventnor and
Bruce Nichols, respectively.
Ventnor is the No. 1 junior in
South Africa and the No. 6
junior in the world while
Nichols was an Ail-American
last year (as was the entire
UCLA team last year) and is
very experienced. The Bruins'
sixth man will be announced at
match time.
Singles key
Gould said he feels the sing
les will be the key to a Stanford
victory. "We'll have to win at
least three of the singles
matches to have a chance."
The Cards also lost last year to
UCLA 6-3 and have never
beaten a good UCLA team at
home. The Bruins are currently
ranked No. 3 in the nation but
according to Gould, "The
Bruins should really be ranked
No. 2. Trinity's current No. 2
ranking is due to its second

place finish in the NCAAs last
year and that was because
UCLA and us were on the same
side of the draw. We've never
beaten both USC and UCLA
down there on the same
weekend so this will be our
biggest challenge."
The Cards will be taking
down McEnroe, Bill Maze,
Wright, Mitchell, John Rast,
Peter Rennert and Jim Hodges
with Lloyd Bourne as a reserve.
After the winter quarter chal
lenge matches McEnroe
emerged as the No. 1 player
and is definitely "my best
player," according to Gould.
NCAA singles champion
Mitchell wasn't playing up to
par during the challenge
matches and lost in close three
set matches to McEnroe, Maze
and Wright. But during last
week's Texas matches Gould
said he felt Mitchell played bet
ter than anyone and was prob
ably the person most respon
sible for the Cards' winning.
With the addition of McEn
roe the Cards are nothing short
of awesome and potentially the
best collegiate team in two de
cades. After this weekend
Gould will have a much better
idea of how good the 1978 Car
dinals really are.

team will perform this
weekend as it heads down to
Los Angeles for what Gould
calls "the biggest weekend of
the year."
Today the Cards will face the
ever improving USC Trojans
(ranked No. 10 in the nation)
who last week knocked off No.
4 Southern Methodist Univer
sity 8-1. Gould said, "USC
started slow this year and re
ceived the relatively poor na
tional ranking but as of late
they've been playing very welj
and with a lot of confidence."
The Trojans are led by
freshman Robert Van t'Hof and
senior Chris Lewis who last
year was an NCAA semifinalist
in singles. The Cards lost 6-3 to
the Trojans last year and if they
overlook USC for the tougher
UCLA, they could lose again.
UCLA tough
The match against formida
ble UCLA will be on Saturday.
The courts at Westwood have
just been resurfaced (they are
hardcourts), making them very
slow and along with the home
court fans will give the Bruins a
big boost.
Although Gould feels that
"against USC we should be a
slight favorite, against UCLA
we have no better than a 50-50

chance." Part of Gould's con
cern is because of John McEn
roe's continued illness and a
leg injury to Perry Wright.
"Mac" has strep throat and
Wright has a knee strain that is
na gg' n g but not serious
enough to require surgery.
The match against the Bruins
will feature the nation's two
best freshman phenoms:
McEnroe vs. Eliot Telscher who
is ranked No. 23 in the nation.
In their last meeting, he de
feated McEnroe on hardcourt
in the L.A. Open. McEnroe de
feated Telscher earlier in the
year but that was on clay.
The rest of UCLA's squad is
impressive. At No. 2 position
they will field John Austin, the
brother of 15-year-old sensa
tion Tracy, and at third singles
they will have Tony Graham,
the man that Matt Mitchell de
feated for the NCAA singles
crown last June.
At the fourth and fifth posi
tions the Bruins are particularly
solid, with Robby Ventnor and
Bruce Nichols, respectively.
Ventnor is the No. 1 junior in
South Africa and the No. 6
junior in the world while
Nichols was an Ail-American
last year (as was the entire
UCLA team last year) and is
very experienced. The Bruins'
sixth man will be announced at
match time.
Singles key
Gould said he feels the sing
les will be the key to a Stanford
victory. "We'll have to win at
least three of the singles
matches to have a chance."
The Cards also lost last year to
UCLA 6-3 and have never
beaten a good UCLA team at
home. The Bruins are currently
ranked No. 3 in the nation but
according to Gould, "The
Bruins should really be ranked
No. 2. Trinity's current No. 2
ranking is due to its second

place finish in the NCAAs last
year and that was because
UCLA and us were on the same
side of the draw. We've never
beaten both USC and UCLA
down there on the same
weekend so this will be our
biggest challenge."
The Cards will be taking
down McEnroe, Bill Maze,
Wright, Mitchell, John Rast,
Peter Rennert and Jim Hodges
with Lloyd Bourne as a reserve.
After the winter quarter chal
lenge matches McEnroe
emerged as the No. 1 player
and is definitely "my best
player," according to Gould.
NCAA singles champion
Mitchell wasn't playing up to
par during the challenge
matches and lost in close three
set matches to McEnroe, Maze
and Wright. But during last
week's Texas matches Gould
said he felt Mitchell played bet
ter than anyone and was prob
ably the person most respon
sible for the Cards' winning.
With the addition of McEn
roe the Cards are nothing short
of awesome and potentially the
best collegiate team in two de
cades. After this weekend
Gould will have a much better
idea of how good the 1978 Car
dinals really are.

Stanford's Barb Jordan started the Cards' rout of San Jose State
yesterday with a 6-0, 6-3 triumph over Kim Purcell.
How would you feel as a ten
nis coach if you: 1) had
everyone returning from last
year's No. 1 nationally-ranked
team? 2) added a Wimbledon
semifinalist who is currently
the 10th-ranked U.S. men's
singles player? 3) and had last
year's NCAA singles champion
returning but managing to land
only the no. 4 spot on your
team?
Pretty pleased, probably.
And although Stanford
men's coach Dick Gould is ecs
tatic about his team's potential,
he is concerned about how his
team will perform this
weekend as it heads down to
Los Angeles for what Gould
