# Card women rip SJS

### Alfred Nakatsuma 
After big wins on the road, the Stanford wo
men's tennis team returned home to resume
league competition. Yesterday afternoon it
breezed to another win by defeating San Jose
State 8-1. The win improved the Cards' seasonal
mark to 9-0, and raised the Cards' league record
to 2-0.
Playing top singles, Barbara )ordan had no
difficulty in beating an erratic Kim Purcell. Pur
cell never seemed to get started against the
steady, forcing strokes of Jordan.
In the No. 3 singles spot, Stanford's Nancy
Rudd toppled San Jose's Sue Guyon by playing a
consistent and well-balanced game. The Stan
ford senior tamed Cuyon's aggressive
groundstrokes, and poked many winners dur
ing Cuyon's frequent visits to the net.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles team of Nancy Rudd
and Caryn Hertel and the No. 2 team of Wendy

Richard and Corinne Nevinny both came from
behind to defeat San Jose's teams.
Continued lopsided scores in the future
might be more difficult for the Cards, who took
second in the nation last year. Jordan said, "It
will be tougher this year because more teams
are better than last year. We have a chance to do
as well or better than last year, but everybody
has to play up to their potential."
The next matches will be against Fresno State
on Saturday, and UC-lrvine on Sunday at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium.
