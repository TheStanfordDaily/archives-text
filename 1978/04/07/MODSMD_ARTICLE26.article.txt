The Stanford men's vol
leyball team defeated Califor
nia last night 11-15,15-12,16-14
and 15-11 in their next-to-last
regular season match.
Stanford began the match
sluggishly, falling behind
quickly 5-0. The Cards soon ral
lied to take the lead 6-5, but
lost 15-11 due to poor passing
and weak spikes.
The second game was all
Stanford as the Cards control
led the pace of the contest the
entire way. The Cardinals
jumped out to a 4-0 lead, but
then fell behind 7-4. From
there, however, they out
scored the Bears 11-5 to win
15-12.
The third game was defi
nitely the most exciting of the
match as the Bears led the en
tire way only to see Stanford

catch them at 14-14 and close
out the win 16-14.
The final contest was anti
climactic as Stanford quickly
led 14-5, fought off a valiant
Bear rally, and won 15-11.
The Cardinals were impres
sive in all aspects of volleyball
in the final three games. De
fensively, they passed ex
tremely well, and took advan
tage of frequent dead balls.
Their shot blocking at times
was the best they had dis
played all season as Dave
Saeta, Rich Yardley and Jack
Foxworth constantly stuck Bear
smashes back in the spiker's
face.
On offense the Cards were
led by the fabulous setting of
Saeta and the tremendous
spikes by Yardley, Rod Fletcher
and Ace Edwards.
Coach Art Lambert was

generally pleased with the per
formance, but he added, "We
need to be able to dig the balls
out on defense. We let far too
many shots drop and this ad
versely affects our defensive
play."
As for the rest of the season,
Lambert remained cautiously
optimistic. "We are really
ready for next week's confer
ence championship; we are
justgettingour momentum go
ing. This team has really re
sponded well and things are
really improving rapidly."
Lambert said he was impre
ssed with the improvement of
the passing and setting — di
rected by Saeta — and said,
"This, combined with the
strong outside hitting of Ed
wards and Yardley, lends real
credence to our hopes for a re
gional berth."
