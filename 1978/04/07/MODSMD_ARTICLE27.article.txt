## Cardinal nine faces Bruins 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Even though the weather outside doesn't quite feel like spring,
it is. And it has been said spring is the time when young men's
hearts turn to thoughts of . . . baseball!
Today at 2:30 p.m. the thoughts of a couple dozen players and
two coaches will be on nothing other than that as the Stanford
Cardinals meet the UCLA Bruins in their first conference game of
the 1978 season at Stanford's Sunken Diamond.
The Cards bring a 24-6-1 record into today's game after an 8-2
loss to UC-Davis yesterday. That loss was the fourth in the team's
past six games, and continues the slump that began a week
and-a-half ago during the Riverside Tournament.
Though Stanford coach Mark Marquess considers the slump
something that "just happens," he nevertheless expressed his
concern over the uncertainty it causes.
"I'm a little scared because we haven't played well for two
weeks now," Marquess said after the loss to Davis. "But we'll
battle them (UCLA), we'll be competitive, and we'll hope that
everything falls together for us. The kids always work very hard,
play hard, and play with a lot of intensity," he continued. "They'll
play hard Friday and play hard Saturday— really that's all we can
ask."
Last year the Cards stormed into league competition with a
remarkable 27-5 record, and then fell into a slump, losing their
first six league games. The important difference in this year's
slump is it has occurred just before league play begins and so the
team members know they have to work hard right from the very
start. Experiencing the slump over the past two weeks may pre
vent the occurrence of a more serious one now.
UCLA, meanwhile, comes into town with a 21-9 record after
experiencing a similar slump on the road in Hawaii. The Bruins
lost five of six games on the Islands.
Like the Cards, the Bruins return this year with basically the
same team as 1977. UCLA lost only four starters and is fielding 14
returning lettermen. Pitching should be its strength this year with
three-year letterman Floyd Chiffer and two-year letterman Tim
O'Neill, both seniors, heading the staff.
Delany dominates
The Bruin offense will be led by two year all-conference catcher
Dennis Delany who completed the '77 season with a .339 batting
average, 11 homeruns and 37 RBI. Dave Baker, who received
all-conference honors in the outfield lastyear, has moved to third
base for this season and will aid Delany in UCLA's offensive
attack. Baker had 43 RBI and 10 homeruns last year and currently
has 26 RBI and 8 homeruns coming into league competition.
Defensively, UCLA is much different from last year's squad.
Baker's move to third has left a hole in the Bruin outfield that has
been filled by some of the younger players on the team. First and
second base, opened up by the graduation of Brian Viselli and
Gary Rasmussen, have been taken over by junior college transfer
Mike Carpenter and freshman David Montanari. Mobil Cox re
turns to the shortstop position after spending the summer play
ing semi-pro ball with the Humboldt Crabs.
UCLA's pitching staff, however, makes an excellent defense
less than necessary. Bruin righthander Chiffer is scheduled to
start this afternoon's game against the Cards and looks to make
things difficult at the plate with his ERA of 0.36 and a 7-1 record.
Chiffer throws a hard fastball and was drafted by the St. Louis
Cardinals at the end of last year but chose to stay at UCLA.
Sophomore Tim Leary will start the first game of Saturday's
doubleheaderfor the Bruins, and represents a major challenge to
the Cards. Leary was the ace of the staff in the Fairbanks, Alaska
semi-pro organization this past summer and has had his fastball
clocked at 94 mph. O'Neill, who is slated to start the second game
of Saturday's twinbill, was a mainstay of the 1977 Bruin team.
Scott Bollens, a sinking fastball reliever, will aid the UCLA star
ters.
Where's the power?
Last year UCLA beat Stanford in four of the six games they
played, but the Cards took two out of three at home — one by a
score of 19-3.
The homerun ball devastated Stanford last year in league play,
but with the exception of Delany and Baker, UCLA doesn't appear
to be a power hitting team this year. Sophomore John Violette,
who hit two of his four homeruns against the Cards last year, has
not been playing regularly for the Bruins this year.
Stanford will start senior lefthander Rob Irwin (3-1) this after
noon against the predominately righthanded Bruins. Tomorrow
Brian Harrison (5-1) and Larry Kuhn (4-0) are scheduled for the
mound duties.

remarkable 27-5 record, and then fell into a slump, losing their
first six league games. The important difference in this year's
slump is it has occurred just before league play begins and so the
team members know they have to work hard right from the very
start. Experiencing the slump over the past two weeks may pre
vent the occurrence of a more serious one now.
UCLA, meanwhile, comes into town with a 21-9 record after
experiencing a similar slump on the road in Hawaii. The Bruins
lost five of six games on the Islands.
Like the Cards, the Bruins return this year with basically the
same team as 1977. UCLA lost only four starters and is fielding 14
returning lettermen. Pitching should be its strength this year with
three-year letterman Floyd Chiffer and two-year letterman Tim
O'Neill, both seniors, heading the staff.
Delany dominates
The Bruin offense will be led by two year all-conference catcher
Dennis Delany who completed the '77 season with a .339 batting
average, 11 homeruns and 37 RBI. Dave Baker, who received
all-conference honors in the outfield lastyear, has moved to third
base for this season and will aid Delany in UCLA's offensive
attack. Baker had 43 RBI and 10 homeruns last year and currently
has 26 RBI and 8 homeruns coming into league competition.
Defensively, UCLA is much different from last year's squad.
Baker's move to third has left a hole in the Bruin outfield that has
been filled by some of the younger players on the team. First and
second base, opened up by the graduation of Brian Viselli and
Gary Rasmussen, have been taken over by junior college transfer
Mike Carpenter and freshman David Montanari. Mobil Cox re
turns to the shortstop position after spending the summer play
ing semi-pro ball with the Humboldt Crabs.
UCLA's pitching staff, however, makes an excellent defense
less than necessary. Bruin righthander Chiffer is scheduled to
start this afternoon's game against the Cards and looks to make
things difficult at the plate with his ERA of 0.36 and a 7-1 record.
Chiffer throws a hard fastball and was drafted by the St. Louis
Cardinals at the end of last year but chose to stay at UCLA.
Sophomore Tim Leary will start the first game of Saturday's
doubleheaderfor the Bruins, and represents a major challenge to
the Cards. Leary was the ace of the staff in the Fairbanks, Alaska
semi-pro organization this past summer and has had his fastball
clocked at 94 mph. O'Neill, who is slated to start the second game
of Saturday's twinbill, was a mainstay of the 1977 Bruin team.
Scott Bollens, a sinking fastball reliever, will aid the UCLA star
ters.
Where's the power?
Last year UCLA beat Stanford in four of the six games they
played, but the Cards took two out of three at home — one by a
score of 19-3.
The homerun ball devastated Stanford last year in league play,
but with the exception of Delany and Baker, UCLA doesn't appear
to be a power hitting team this year. Sophomore John Violette,
who hit two of his four homeruns against the Cards last year, has
not been playing regularly for the Bruins this year.
Stanford will start senior lefthander Rob Irwin (3-1) this after
noon against the predominately righthanded Bruins. Tomorrow
Brian Harrison (5-1) and Larry Kuhn (4-0) are scheduled for the
mound duties.

Even though the weather outside doesn't quite feel like spring,
it is. And it has been said spring is the time when young men's
hearts turn to thoughts of . . . baseball!
Today at 2:30 p.m. the thoughts of a couple dozen players and
two coaches will be on nothing other than that as the Stanford
Cardinals meet the UCLA Bruins in their first conference game of
the 1978 season at Stanford's Sunken Diamond.
The Cards bring a 24-6-1 record into today's game after an 8-2
loss to UC-Davis yesterday. That loss was the fourth in the team's
past six games, and continues the slump that began a week
and-a-half ago during the Riverside Tournament.
Though Stanford coach Mark Marquess considers the slump
something that "just happens," he nevertheless expressed his
concern over the uncertainty it causes.
"I'm a little scared because we haven't played well for two
weeks now," Marquess said after the loss to Davis. "But we'll
battle them (UCLA), we'll be competitive, and we'll hope that
everything falls together for us. The kids always work very hard,
play hard, and play with a lot of intensity," he continued. "They'll
play hard Friday and play hard Saturday— really that's all we can
ask."
