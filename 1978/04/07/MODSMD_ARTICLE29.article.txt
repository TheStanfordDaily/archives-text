# Card defense could carry the ball
## Offensive replacements have big slots to fill as spring practice opens

Springtrainingisover, right?
Wrong.
For the Stanford football
team, it's just starting.
The Cardinals will toil and
sweat four days a week for five
weeks to prepare for the ad
vent of Pacific-10 football next
fall and the toughest schedule
in several years.
In his first season on the
Farm, head coach Bill Walsh
led Stanford to a 9-3 record, a
victory in the Sun Bowl and a

No. 15 national ranking. Re
peating the successes of 1977
will not be easy as the Cards
face four bowl teams in 1978 —
Oklahoma, USC, Washington
and Arizona State.
Walsh and his staff will use
spring practice to install a 3-4
defensive alignment and push
the development of Stanford's
running game.
Last fall Stanford ranked
seventh in the nation in total
offense, third in passing of
fense. But gone are Ail-

America quarterback Guy Ben
jamin, All-America tackle
Gordy King and standout re
ceivers James Lofton and Bill
Kellar.
"We'll be much more de
pendent on our defense this
year," Walsh said. "We expect
our defense, on a seasonal
basis, to be dramatically im
proved over 1977."
Walsh said the last two
games of the season, when
Stanford held California to
three points in the Big Game
and LSU to 14 in the Sun Bowl,
gave evidence to the im
provement in the youthful
Card defense.
"We are changing to a 3-4
because of our apparent
strength at linebacker," Walsh
said. "We not only have four
good men for the starting
spots, but we have up to eight
top linebackers."
The coaching staff and team
have been reviewing training
films of the famed "No Name
Defense" which carried the
Miami Dolphins to two Super
Bowl victories in the early
19705.
"It was a relentless de
fense," Walsh said. "With our
personnel at the collegiate
level, Miami will be the team
we're emulating."
All-pro linebacker Nick
Buoniconti anchored Miami's
3-4 alignment, the so-called 50
defense. The man who will an
chor Stanford's 3-4, linebacker
Gordy Ceresino, reminds
Walsh of Buoninconti.
"He's explosive, decisive,
quick and relentless," Walsh
said of Ceresino. "He should
play in the 3-4 the way
Buoniconti did at Miami."
Walsh said the coaching staff
would like to see more quick
ness in the defense this year.
The 1977 Pacific-8 Coach of the
Year said that the secondary
was hampered much of last
season by a lack of speed and
mobility. "We think that will be
rectified this year," Walsh said.
Late-season starters Robby
Chapman and Rick Parker and
regular John Pigott all return to
the defensive backfield. Steve
Foley, a junior college transfer
from Orange Coast College,
and three-year letterman
Savann Thompson will also
compete with the three return

ing starters for jobs.
The defensive line will be
spearheaded by Dean Wilson,
a starter at end last season,
who moves to nose guard.
Chuck Evans, the other starter
at end, moves to one of the
tackle spots while Larry Fisher
and Chuck Bedford are ex
pected to duel for the other
end slot.
Last August Walsh said that
much of the success of Stan
ford's team in 1977 would de
pend on the development of
James Lofton as an instant scor
ing threat. Lofton caught 14
touchdown passes and the
Cards went 9-3.
"The main thing that remains
to be seen is whether we can
make the big play throwing the
ball as we did in 1977," Walsh
said.
"We will have a much
improved defense. Our run
ning game will be better. But to
repeat the success of last sea
son we will have to have one or
more players who can make
the big play.
"We have to have that di
mension of scoring and mak
ing the big play that Lofton
gave us," Walsh added.
Freshman Larry Harris has
been moved back from the de
fensive secondary to wide re
ceiver and Walsh said the
coaching staff will look at Har
ris to see if he can provide the
Lofton element.
Walsh said that another
freshman receiver, Ken
Margerum, may also be some
one who can give the Cards the
scoring potential Lofton pro
vided. But Margerum is cur
rently out for track.
While the coaches search for
a replacement for Lofton,
Steve Dils is the heir apparent
to Guy Benjamin's quarter
backing spot. Last fall Dils
came in late in the game
against Oregon and helped
Stanford to a 20-10 victory over
the Ducks and then en
gineered a 32-;28 upset of UCLA
the next week.
"The offense we will run is
predicated on Steve Dils'
abilities," Walsh said. Walsh
said that means the Cards will
do more passing from a rollout
and use even more play-action
passes than during the 1977
season. Walsh added, how

ever, that Dils will receive
competition for the signal cal
ler's job from Turk Schonert
and Grayson Rogers.
When looking for targets,
the Card quarterback will often
look to the tight end, the posi
tion Walsh said he considers
the strongest on the team.
Stanford will emphasize a two
tight end offense to make bet
ter use of Mitch Pleis, Pat Bowe
and Marty Smith.
Much of it is also dependent
on freshman halfback Darrin
Nelson, who is now dazzling
Stanford sports fans while run
ning for the Stanford track
team. But fullbacks Phil Francis
and Todd Wasik and halfbacks
Billy Anderson and Jim Brown,
a transfer from Arkansas, will
work to give the Cards a ba
lanced running attack during
the fall.
If you head over to deGuerre
in the afternoon to catch some
rays, stop by and watch some
of practice. Spring football may
not sound like fun, but it can
make the fall a lot more enjoy
able.

Cardinal middle linebacker Gordy Ceresino (95) flies in to finish off
an Illinois runner last season. Ceresino led the Cards in tackles with a
school single season record of 174. Linehacking partner Tom Hall
(58) will be joining Ceresino in the Cards' new tnree-four defensive
alignment. Chuck Bedford (96) also returns at right tackle, but the
graduation of Ralph Phillips (41) will leave a gap at safety.

Margerum, may also be some
one who can give the Cards the
scoring potential Lofton pro
vided. But Margerum is cur
rently out for track.
While the coaches search for
a replacement for Lofton,
Steve Dils is the heir apparent
to Guy Benjamin's quarter
backing spot. Last fall Dils
came in late in the game
against Oregon and helped
Stanford to a 20-10 victory over
the Ducks and then en
gineered a 32-;28 upset of UCLA
the next week.
"The offense we will run is
predicated on Steve Dils'
abilities," Walsh said. Walsh
said that means the Cards will
do more passing from a rollout
and use even more play-action
passes than during the 1977
season. Walsh added, how

ever, that Dils will receive
competition for the signal cal
ler's job from Turk Schonert
and Grayson Rogers.
When looking for targets,
the Card quarterback will often
look to the tight end, the posi
tion Walsh said he considers
the strongest on the team.
Stanford will emphasize a two
tight end offense to make bet
ter use of Mitch Pleis, Pat Bowe
and Marty Smith.
Much of it is also dependent
on freshman halfback Darrin
Nelson, who is now dazzling
Stanford sports fans while run
ning for the Stanford track
team. But fullbacks Phil Francis
and Todd Wasik and halfbacks
Billy Anderson and Jim Brown,
a transfer from Arkansas, will
work to give the Cards a ba
lanced running attack during
the fall.
If you head over to deGuerre
in the afternoon to catch some
rays, stop by and watch some
of practice. Spring football may
not sound like fun, but it can
make the fall a lot more enjoy
able.

Cardinal middle linebacker Gordy Ceresino (95) flies in to finish off
an Illinois runner last season. Ceresino led the Cards in tackles with a
school single season record of 174. Linehacking partner Tom Hall
(58) will be joining Ceresino in the Cards' new tnree-four defensive
alignment. Chuck Bedford (96) also returns at right tackle, but the
graduation of Ralph Phillips (41) will leave a gap at safety.
Springtrainingisover, right?
Wrong.
For the Stanford football
team, it's just starting.
The Cardinals will toil and
sweat four days a week for five
weeks to prepare for the ad
vent of Pacific-10 football next
fall and the toughest schedule
in several years.
In his first season on the
Farm, head coach Bill Walsh
led Stanford to a 9-3 record, a
victory in the Sun Bowl and a

No. 15 national ranking. Re
peating the successes of 1977
will not be easy as the Cards
face four bowl teams in 1978 —
Oklahoma, USC, Washington
and Arizona State.
Walsh and his staff will use
spring practice to install a 3-4
defensive alignment and push
the development of Stanford's
running game.
Last fall Stanford ranked
seventh in the nation in total
offense, third in passing of
fense. But gone are Ail-

America quarterback Guy Ben
jamin, All-America tackle
Gordy King and standout re
ceivers James Lofton and Bill
Kellar.
"We'll be much more de
pendent on our defense this
year," Walsh said. "We expect
our defense, on a seasonal
basis, to be dramatically im
proved over 1977."
Walsh said the last two
games of the season, when
Stanford held California to
three points in the Big Game
and LSU to 14 in the Sun Bowl,
gave evidence to the im
provement in the youthful
Card defense.
"We are changing to a 3-4
because of our apparent
strength at linebacker," Walsh
said. "We not only have four
good men for the starting
spots, but we have up to eight
top linebackers."
The coaching staff and team
have been reviewing training
films of the famed "No Name
Defense" which carried the
Miami Dolphins to two Super
Bowl victories in the early
19705.
"It was a relentless de
fense," Walsh said. "With our
personnel at the collegiate
level, Miami will be the team
we're emulating."
All-pro linebacker Nick
Buoniconti anchored Miami's
3-4 alignment, the so-called 50
defense. The man who will an
chor Stanford's 3-4, linebacker
Gordy Ceresino, reminds
Walsh of Buoninconti.
"He's explosive, decisive,
quick and relentless," Walsh
said of Ceresino. "He should
play in the 3-4 the way
Buoniconti did at Miami."
Walsh said the coaching staff
would like to see more quick
ness in the defense this year.
The 1977 Pacific-8 Coach of the
Year said that the secondary
was hampered much of last
season by a lack of speed and
mobility. "We think that will be
rectified this year," Walsh said.
Late-season starters Robby
Chapman and Rick Parker and
regular John Pigott all return to
the defensive backfield. Steve
Foley, a junior college transfer
from Orange Coast College,
and three-year letterman
Savann Thompson will also
compete with the three return

ing starters for jobs.
The defensive line will be
spearheaded by Dean Wilson,
a starter at end last season,
who moves to nose guard.
Chuck Evans, the other starter
at end, moves to one of the
tackle spots while Larry Fisher
and Chuck Bedford are ex
pected to duel for the other
end slot.
Last August Walsh said that
much of the success of Stan
ford's team in 1977 would de
pend on the development of
James Lofton as an instant scor
ing threat. Lofton caught 14
touchdown passes and the
Cards went 9-3.
"The main thing that remains
to be seen is whether we can
make the big play throwing the
ball as we did in 1977," Walsh
said.
"We will have a much
improved defense. Our run
ning game will be better. But to
repeat the success of last sea
son we will have to have one or
more players who can make
the big play.
"We have to have that di
mension of scoring and mak
ing the big play that Lofton
gave us," Walsh added.
Freshman Larry Harris has
been moved back from the de
fensive secondary to wide re
ceiver and Walsh said the
coaching staff will look at Har
ris to see if he can provide the
Lofton element.
Walsh said that another
freshman receiver, Ken
Margerum, may also be some
one who can give the Cards the
scoring potential Lofton pro
vided. But Margerum is cur
rently out for track.

Walsh of Buoninconti.
"He's explosive, decisive,
quick and relentless," Walsh
said of Ceresino. "He should
play in the 3-4 the way
Buoniconti did at Miami."
Walsh said the coaching staff
would like to see more quick
ness in the defense this year.
The 1977 Pacific-8 Coach of the
Year said that the secondary
was hampered much of last
season by a lack of speed and
mobility. "We think that will be
rectified this year," Walsh said.
Late-season starters Robby
Chapman and Rick Parker and
regular John Pigott all return to
the defensive backfield. Steve
Foley, a junior college transfer
from Orange Coast College,
and three-year letterman
Savann Thompson will also
compete with the three return

ing starters for jobs.
The defensive line will be
spearheaded by Dean Wilson,
a starter at end last season,
who moves to nose guard.
Chuck Evans, the other starter
at end, moves to one of the
tackle spots while Larry Fisher
and Chuck Bedford are ex
pected to duel for the other
end slot.
Last August Walsh said that
much of the success of Stan
ford's team in 1977 would de
pend on the development of
James Lofton as an instant scor
ing threat. Lofton caught 14
touchdown passes and the
Cards went 9-3.
"The main thing that remains
to be seen is whether we can
make the big play throwing the
ball as we did in 1977," Walsh
said.
"We will have a much
improved defense. Our run
ning game will be better. But to
repeat the success of last sea
son we will have to have one or
more players who can make
the big play.
"We have to have that di
mension of scoring and mak
ing the big play that Lofton
gave us," Walsh added.
Freshman Larry Harris has
been moved back from the de
fensive secondary to wide re
ceiver and Walsh said the
coaching staff will look at Har
ris to see if he can provide the
Lofton element.
Walsh said that another
freshman receiver, Ken
Margerum, may also be some
one who can give the Cards the
scoring potential Lofton pro
vided. But Margerum is cur
rently out for track.
While the coaches search for
a replacement for Lofton,
Steve Dils is the heir apparent
to Guy Benjamin's quarter
backing spot. Last fall Dils
came in late in the game
against Oregon and helped
Stanford to a 20-10 victory over
the Ducks and then en
gineered a 32-;28 upset of UCLA
the next week.
"The offense we will run is
predicated on Steve Dils'
abilities," Walsh said. Walsh
said that means the Cards will
do more passing from a rollout
and use even more play-action
passes than during the 1977
season. Walsh added, how

ever, that Dils will receive
competition for the signal cal
ler's job from Turk Schonert
and Grayson Rogers.
When looking for targets,
the Card quarterback will often
look to the tight end, the posi
tion Walsh said he considers
the strongest on the team.
Stanford will emphasize a two
tight end offense to make bet
ter use of Mitch Pleis, Pat Bowe
and Marty Smith.
Much of it is also dependent
on freshman halfback Darrin
Nelson, who is now dazzling
Stanford sports fans while run
ning for the Stanford track
team. But fullbacks Phil Francis
and Todd Wasik and halfbacks
Billy Anderson and Jim Brown,
a transfer from Arkansas, will
work to give the Cards a ba
lanced running attack during
the fall.
If you head over to deGuerre
in the afternoon to catch some
rays, stop by and watch some
of practice. Spring football may
not sound like fun, but it can
make the fall a lot more enjoy
able.

Cardinal middle linebacker Gordy Ceresino (95) flies in to finish off
an Illinois runner last season. Ceresino led the Cards in tackles with a
school single season record of 174. Linehacking partner Tom Hall
(58) will be joining Ceresino in the Cards' new tnree-four defensive
alignment. Chuck Bedford (96) also returns at right tackle, but the
graduation of Ralph Phillips (41) will leave a gap at safety.
