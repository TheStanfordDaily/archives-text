### Hardy Iredale 
The Faculty Senate voted yesterday
to give official recognition to stu
dents completing requirements for
two majors. The move was proposed
by Political Science Prof. Jan Triska,
speaking for the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies (CUS).
The proposal, according to Triska,
will require that "when a student
completes more than one major the
University will recognize, and give
equal weight to both the major fields
on the bachelor's diploma and on of
ficial academic transcripts," pro
vided the requirements for both
majors do not overlap.
This means both majors will be
listed on a student's diploma. In the
past, Stanford listed only one major
even if a student had completed the
requirements for more than one.
The move was discussed at length
by the Faculty Senate before it was
passed by a margin of one vote.
AccordingtoTriska, CUS made the
proposal as a result of the increasing
number of students who have fulfil
led requirements for two majors over
the past few years.
Economics Prof. James Rosse said
he was concerned that official rec
ognition of more than one major

field would induce students to spend
less time acquiring breadth and
depth.
Triska said the proposal would
offer inducement to students to take
fuller advantage of the departmental
resources of the University, espe
cially departmental advisers.
Assoc. English Prof. Ronald Re
bholz said many of the best advanced
seminars are only open to declared
majors. FHe said the inducement to
major in two fields may increase pos
sible student access to these smaller
seminars.
It was noted that the move would
not affect students completing
majors in both an arts and science
field. As in the past, they will con
tinue to receive two bachelor's de
grees.
CUS also floored a proposal to
broaden the criteria governing the
selection of students for the "gradu
ation with honors" distinction.
Triska said currently departments
nominate a certain number of
graduating students for the distinc
tion. Fie said this fails to take into
account a student's performance
outside his or her major field.
