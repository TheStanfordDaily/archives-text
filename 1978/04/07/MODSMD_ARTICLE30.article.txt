# Teacher, pupil meet in track
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
The Stanford track team travels back to Los Angeles this
weekend with the hope that a better fate awaits it in a dual meet
against Occidental College. Last week, the Cardinals (1-1) were
shellacked by USC, 111-39.
However, veteran track coach Payton ]ordan acknowledged
Stanford is going in Saturday as a favorite.
"We should be favored on paper,'' says Jordan, "and we II be in
a battle for every point."
Battling the Cards will be an Occidental squad under the direc
tion of first-year coach Kevin McNair. McNair, a 1971 graduate of
Stanford, was a sprinter on lordan's track squads from 1968 to
1971.
Ironically, Jordan's coaching career began with a 10-year stint at
Occidental, where his teams won 10 league championships and
two NAIA titles. The meet is McNair's first against his former
mentor, and Jordan is not taking him or the Tigers lightly.
"Occidental is traditionally a high-spirited team, and Kevin is
noted for developing team unity, said Jordan.
The Tigers, 0-1 on the season after an 88-56 loss to Arizona, are
strongest in the distances and the jumps.
The long distance men are led by seniors Tom Colley and Steve
Bitterly. Colley is the current Division 111 cross country champion,
and a former Division 111 champion miler. He is also an All-
American in cross country. Bitterly is a two-miler who won All-
American honors as a cross country runner a year ago.
In the high jump, Occidental sports a one-two punch with
defending Division 111 champ Rudy Beaver and Kevin Hall, who
was third behind Beaver for the Division 111 title, and has jumped
6-feet-11 this year.
The Tigers also have the Division 111 triple jump champion in
Randy Williams, who has a lifetime best of 50-4, and has leaped
47-10 this season.
Jordan's Cardinals will be paced by do-it-all senior James Lof
ton. Lofton leaped to a season best of 25-9'/« in the long jump
against USC.
Also expected for big things are junior Roy Kissin who besides
Lofton was Stanford's only other winner against USC with a time
of 14:28.2 in the 5000 meters. Sophomore discus thrower Rick
Buss, who threw a lifetime best of 169-9 against USC, and Doug
Greenwood, whose toss of 51-7 in the shot put was a season high,
are being counted on by the Cards.
"We have enough talent to win, unless we fall asleep," said
Jordan.
