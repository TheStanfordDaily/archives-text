At the Monterey Rugby Tournament March 27
to 28 Stanford's ruggers finished 10th in a field of
the 32 best teams in the U.S. and Canada. With a
little luck they might have finished fifth.
In Stanford's first game the Cards upset a
previously-undefeated Chuckanut Bay side 6-0.
Chuckanut went on to win the second division
title.
The Cards' second game against the
nationally-ranked BATS was a heartbreaker. The
game ended in a 3-3 tie but was awarded to the
BATS in a kickoff. The BATS then went on to
place fifth in the tournament.
Stanford played two more games the first day
and savage games they were. Kern County fell
33-3 in a riotous offensive display. Then the
highly-ranked Palo Alto Rugby Club fell 9-3 to
Stanford's determined assaults.
The first day ended without a single tr.y having
been scored against the Cards.
But on Sunday — Armageddon. An older, big
ger team from Puget Sound wore down the
Cards and overcame an 8-0 Stanford halftime
lead.
The second half belonged to Puget Sound as it
prevailed 19-8. Its command of scrummage, maul
and line-out was almost total. Puget Sound
showed determined running, fine kicking and
sure handling behind the line.
Earlier in the season, Chuckanut Bay had
downed Puget Sound.
The Old Blues, a team composed mostly of
former Cal football players, won the tourna

ment with a dazzling performance over an all
star Canadian team.

On March 29, the Stanford ruggers went north
for a week of rugby against Canadian teams.
Playing against many members of the Canadian
National squad the Cards took one of three
games.
The University of British Columbia took the
first game 17-7.
The next opponent, the University of Victoria,
has a reputation for partying. Though it lured
the Cards into pubs and bars for most of the
night before the game, UV fell the next day,
16-6. After the game the Cardinals then outpar
tied UV.
Saturday Stanford contested its ninth game in
seven days. The Cards lost JO-10 to an all-star
team.
The Canadian tour was the highlight of a suc
cessful Stanford rugby season which showed
once again Stanford can play exciting rugby with
the best teams in the U.S. and Canada. Against
university teams Stanford was 6-3, but lack of
size and experience hurt the Cards in crucial
games.
Their improvement this year was due to the
professional coaching of Dr. )oe Cummiskey, a
soft-spoken Irishman. Cummiskey taught them
proper rugby and whipped them up to feverish
play. He would quietly say with a rich gentle
Irish brogue, "Now lads, you don't want to in
jure the man, but you want to hurt him."
