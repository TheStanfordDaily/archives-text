chance to gain experience without jeopardizing the league stand
ings.
"I wanted us to have this game be a game that really em

pressure on us. We were winning the game, so the only thing
people had to think about was that they were having a eood
time," Wright added.

places importance on "having fun, more than winning" really
helps. "With that kind of attitude we have more fun," she said.

I'm having a lot of fun. Now I know the game."
Mary Van Maren said, "I really respect Phil, John (Jenke) and
Mike (Lohrer) running the soccer program. Phil made a special
effort to suit up as many players as he could — he went out of his
way in asking the (Bronco) coach if he could play all of us."
Van Maren said she enjoys soccer and encourages others to
join the sport.
"It's really different than succeeding in academics. It's a team
experience; it's making the whole Stanford experience better.
Soccer's got room for you, if you've got room for soccer," she
added.
