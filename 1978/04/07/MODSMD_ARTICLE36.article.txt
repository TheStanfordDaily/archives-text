Ford, a 'candidate/ pans Carter
Washington — Former President Gerald Ford referred
to himself as a candidate last night when he said any
Republican presidential contender, himself included,
could do a better job than President Jimmy Carter.
"The fastest way to pump new life into the Republican
Party is to turn the country over to the Democrats for a
while," Ford said. "The longer we are out, the better we
look.
"And I say 'we' emphatically," Ford added. "The qual
ity and experience of any Republican candidate — How
ard Baker, George Bush, John Connally, Bob Dole, Ron
Reagan, or Jerry — surpasses unquestionably the lead
ership we currently have."
The six men Ford named as candidates are among the
leading contenders being mentioned for the 1980 Re
publican presidential nomination.
Although it is no secret Ford is keeping a watchful eye
on the political situation leading toward 1980, this was
the first time he publicly referred to himself as a candi
date.
Inflation forecast by government
Washington — Food prices slowed their rise in March,
helping to hold the month's increase in wholesale prices
to 0.6 per cent, the government said yesterday.
Meanwhile, in a separate report, the Carter administ
ration's wage and price agency said overall inflation
"seems hopelessly stuck" in the 6 per cent to 7 per cent
range, and that the threat of it getting worse is greater
than chances of improvement.
The administration officially is forecasting an overall
increase in consumer prices this year of 6.1 per cent,
although recent sharp increases in farm prices will push
them up at least 6.5 per cent, officials now concede.
Tax increases called beneficial
Washington — Two authorities on Social Security
urged Congress yesterday not to be panicked into rol
ling back the Social Security tax increases enacted last
year.
They told the Senate Finance subcommittee on Social
Security that — taken as a whole — the benefit changes
and tax increases voted in December were a great step
forward.
Robert Ball and Robert Myers, who was the nation's
chief Social Security actuary for 23 years, agreed that the
public has zeroed in on last year's tax increases and
ignored the improved benefits.
Navy endorses larger budget
Washington — The secretary of the Navy and the chief
of naval operations endorsed yesterday a far bigger
shipbuilding budget than that proposed by President
Jimmy Carter.
Navy Secretary Graham Claytor and Adm. James Hol
loway, the Navy's highest ranking officer, said they con
sidered a five-year, $45 billion shipbuilding program
proposed by Carter to be inadequate.
They won immediate allies in Rep. Charles Bennett
(D-Fla.) and other subcommittee members who said
they will support efforts to increase the shipbuilding
budget.
Lawmaker charged with sex offense
Washington — Rep. Frederick Richmond (D-N.Y.) con
fessed to his constituents but pleaded innocent in the
courtroom yesterday to having solicited sex from two

young men at his capital home.
After sending Brooklyn voters a letter in which he said,
"I prayerfully ask for your compassion and understand
ing" of his homosexual overtures, Richmond stood
mute as he was formally charged in city court.
The arraignment, on a misdemeanor count of sex sol
icitation, took a scant two minutes after Richmond's
attorneys had arranged with prosecutors to have the
two-term congressman enrolled in a program for first
offenders.
AFL-CIO endorses Jerry Brown
San Francisco — The California AFL-CIO yesterday en
dorsed Gov. Jerry Brown for re-election over objections
of construction workers and state college professors.
The AFL-CIO refused to endorse any Republican for
governor, although Evelle Younger was praised by sta t "
AFL-CIO chief John Henning as "a good attorney gen
eral."
Brown, whose relationship with labor has blown hot
and cold over the past four years, was criticized from all
directions before he won the endorsement on a fairly
close voice vote.
Trains collide in Pico Rivera
Los Angeles — Two persons were seriously injured and
a number of others sustained injuries last night
when a freight train and a passenger train collided in
Pico Rivera, officials said.
A county fire department spokesman said Santa Fe
Railway officials notified the fire department of the inci
dent at 10:19 p.m.
He said the Santa Fe spokesman described the colli
sion as a "major incident."
Radio malfunctions on Voyager 2
Pasadena — Voyager 2, more than 286 million miles
from Earth on its way to Jupiter and Saturn, has de
veloped a radio receiver problem that could end its
mission, officials said yesterday.
Engineers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) learned
Wednesday night that the craft's primary radio receiver
was malfunctioning, rendering the craft unable to re
ceive commands from Earth. A computer on board Voy
ager 2 was to automatically switch to a backup receiver
next week, but scientists were afraid that receiver was
also malfunctioning, said JPF spokesman Al Wood.
