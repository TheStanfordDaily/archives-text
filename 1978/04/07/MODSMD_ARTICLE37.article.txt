# Escondido Village offering do-it-yourself garden plots

### Lori Roback 
Have a friend who wants a garden
plot? Or have you always longed for a
plot of your very own? Lucy Williams,
an assistant maintenance secretary of
the Escondido Village Maintenance
Department, will loan students a 13
foot by 19 foot gardening plot lo
cated between Bowdoin Street and
the Mirrielees apartments.
Each January, these garden plots
are issued without charge to stu
dents living on campus. Highest

priority is given to residents of Es
condido Village and Mirrielees
Apartments. Already 243 of the 266
available plots have been secured.
Williams said "Anything may be
grown in the individual plots, any
thing legal, that is!"
About one-third of the plots are
left unplowed to grow varieties of
fruits and flowers such as strawber
ries which cannot thrive in cultivated
fields.
A plot is "a lot of work for one

student, so group efforts tend to be
more successful," Williams said. She
added that the ZAP and Terra row
houses have maintained extremely
productive gardens for several years.
A possible dorm project, she
suggested, might be to acquire and
to cultivate a plot. She pointed out
that the project's benefits can be
reaped later in the quarter in the
form of fresh fruits and vegetables.
Last year, the drought forced a
drastic cutback of water. This shor
tage reduced the enthusiasms of
many future "gardeners," resulting
in many untilled plots. Even the an
nual row house plantings were ter
minated in an effort to conserve wa
ter.
But the past "wet" winter refilled
nearby reservoirs, allowing the Es
condido Village Maintenance De
partment to guarantee gardeners
sufficient amounts of water for the
upcoming planting season.
