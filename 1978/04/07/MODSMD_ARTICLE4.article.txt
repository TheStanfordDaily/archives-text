# Weicker calls for tough energy policy

### Jonathan Slater 
Rejecting partisan politics, Sen.
Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.) urged
mandatory fuel conservation laws
and a deregulation of controls on
energy production to solve the na
tion's energy problems at a forum in
Bishop Auditorium last night.
Weicker criticized President
|immy Carter's energy policy, calling
it "clearly lacking" in substance.

"What we need in this country is not
more politics, but more energy,"
added the senator.
Joining Weicker in the forum were
Carter Administration representative
William Arntz, of the Department of
Energy and industrialist representa
tive Dr. Paul Tucker, a Phillips Pet
roleum executive.
Arntz opened the discussion by
emphasizing the importance of the
energy issue in "every sector of
American life." He added that a
"simple solution" does not exist to
the "complicated" energy situation.
He outlined four phases of Carter's
National Economic Policy (NEP):
conservation of present energy re
sources, development of coal re
serves, institutional change in utility
rates, with the government provid
ing the proper incentive role and,
rationalization of the price structure
of oil and gas in a politically accepta
ble way.
This last aspect of the NEP Arntz
described as "fundamental to the
other three points." He said ac
complishing these four goals was
"going to be tough," but added "we
are getting close to it."
All three speakers alluded to the
immediacy of an energy problem.
"We do have a problem that is
going to become a crisis if we con
tinue to talk about it and not do
something about it," said Tucker. "It
becomes critical before it even ap
pears serious," he added.
He said he favored conservation,
calling it both desirable and neces
sary. "The energy problem cannot be
solved with an active government
and a passive people," said Tucker.
Tucker also suggested develop
ment of the nation's coal and
uranium supplies, which he esti
mated will last for .300 years.
As for deregulation, Tucker said,
"We need not have a crisis unless we
talk ourselves into one, regulate our
selves into one and bureaucratize
ourselves into one."

Tucker presented his list of solu
tions which range from the simul
taneous refinment of all gas and oil
from traditional reserves, their
further exploration, coal usage, and
to expansion of nuclear and breeder
reactor construction.
He gave responsibility for much of
the solution to private enterprise and
the free market. The government,
said Tucker, "should play a limited
role in our society," adding "the
government is designed to be the
servant of the people and not the

master."
Weicker agreed that a solution to
the energy problem will not be easy,
but will involve "a lot of small con
tributions." He disagreed, however,
that the energy problem requires a
complex solution.
The failure of voluntary conserva
tion has led Weicker to propose
mandatory conservation laws, ad
ding that "if that goes against the
grain of my own party, that's what
has to be done."
