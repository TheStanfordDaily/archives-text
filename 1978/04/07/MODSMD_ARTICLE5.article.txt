# Funding change may cost millions

Stanford could lose more than $7.5
million annually in federal payments
under a U.S. Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) proposal to
change the method by which re
search project costs are determined.
University officials contend the
complicated new accounting
methods would, among other
things, make it substantially more
expensive for researchers here to
use student assistants in their
federally-sponsored investigations.
Last year the federal government
reimbursed the University $82 mill
ion for the overhead costs operated
by federal grants and contracts.
The new approach would affect
the way the University calculates the
costs of paying salaries and purchas
ing materials for federal grants as
well as the "indirect" expenses of

conducting the research.
Such indirect costs include
utilities, janitorial services, library
use and general University administ
ration.
The new plan would reduce the
government's reimbursements by at
least $7.5 million each year, accord
ing to an estimate by Associate Con
troller Frank Riddle and |anet Sweet,
manager of government studies.
"The impact on graduate educa
tion at Stanford could be devastat
ing," said both Riddle and Sweet.
While the University has tradition
ally required that research projects
involve students, usually at the
graduate level, the new OMB
guidelines would cost the University
about $1.5 million more per year to
maintain that policy, they estimate.
Teaching assistants and research
assistants usually obtain tuition re
missions, for which the government
pays back the University. But under
the new plan, these costs would be
charged directly to each
government-sponsored project.
Riddle and Sweet predict this
would result in a large drop in
graduate student participation in
studies.
They believe that another "costly
and inequitable" effect of the prop
osals will be on recovering indirect
library costs. The expenses of stu
dent library use would be attributed
entirely to instruction, even though
graduate students often use the lib
raries to assist their research pro
jects.
Instead of refunding a portion of
library costs, as it does now, the gov
ernment would require the Univer
sity to bear the entire expense, to the
tune of about $2 million in additional
costs.
Present rules permit a small frac
tion of Stanford's administrative
costs to be attributed to student par
ticipation in research and refunded
by the government. The OMB prop

osals would eliminate this, at a cost
of about $1 million.
According to William Massy, vice
president for business and finance,
the OMB proposals will do nothing
to reduce actual research costs. In
stead, they will increase burdens on
the administration and shift costs
from the government to other
sources of income.
