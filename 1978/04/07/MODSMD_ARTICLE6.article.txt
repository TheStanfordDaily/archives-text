# Christian orientation week set
## 
### Lane Webster 
"It's intellectually shortchanging
things to take all these humanities
and never get down and study the
Bible."
"We wanted to do something
again to make Christ an issue on
campus."
What these and other Stanford
Christians have come up with re
cently to fill the void of understand
ing about their beliefs is a "New
Orientation Week," beginning to
day.
Panels, speakers, music and street
theatre groups will seek to ignite
seriousthinking, said Jim Tilley, pres
ident of the Stanford Christian Fel
lowship (SCF).
The Christian world view is seen as
"irrelevant to intellectual things" on
campus and therefore ignored and
belittled as something for those who
don't have "the guts to commit
themselves to some humanistic vie
wpoint," said Tilley.
Recent Daily letters like one
claiming Christians are political
threats made Christians anxious to
get on with the week, said Dave Len
nert, a member of the SCF. If people
reject Christianity, they ought to at
least know what it is they're reject
ing, Lennert added.
")esus is not some institution, but

an active force inside of us," Tilley
said.
"Anyone who is in the modern
world and doesn't know what Christ
said is really missing it," added Rick
Harpel, another SCF member.
"Christianity is more than just a
weekend thing," Harpel said. It af
fects your orientation to South Af
rica, world hunger and other crying
needs, he added.
One speaker who capsulizes these
concerns is a business man from
Boulder, Colorado named Gene
Thomas. "His real occupation is lov
ing anyone who stumbles across his
path," Tilley said.
Thomas runs a half-way house in
Boulder for street people "washed
out by society," Lennert said.
"His rugs get burnt out every six
months and his house gets
wrecked," he said. "He represents a
wholly new kind of loving — intense
personal self-sacrifice for the sake of
the one being loved," Lennert ad
ded.
Thomas' topic for his three lec
tures on Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday will be "What ]esus Re
ally Taught."
Another personality lecturing dur
ing the week is rock artist Larry Nor
man, pioneer of Christian rock 'n'

roll.
Norman, who runs and owns his
own record label, will speak on
"Christ, Music and Culture" to con
clude the week.
"He comes across to me as a per
son who is no hypocrite," said Len
nert. "He'll get down equally on
Christians and non-Christians."
Though Christian mavericks like
Thomas and Norman are ready to
speak what they take tor truth, the
week is not meant to be a "pushy"
publicity campaign, according to
Harpel.
"Bumper sticker Christianity de
means the dignity of Christianity and
the seriousness of it in our lives," he
added.
"Everyone involved respects the
opinions of non-Christians," said
Harpel. The sponsors are sensitive to
past abuses by Christians indented in
many people's minds, and will not
"clobber anyone over the head" with
their beliefs, he added.
But some tension may result. "The
nature of the message calls for com
mitment and it's offensive to some
people," he said. "But it isn't meant
to be pushy."
To kick off the week tonight,
Professor of Material Sciences
Richard Bubeand Stanford graduates
Paul Larson, pastor of Peninsula Co
venant Church, and Peter Payne, of
Inter-Varsity staff, will discuss
whether Christians are psychologi
cally conditioned to believe as they
do.
Saturday night Dr. Irving Hexam,
professor of philosophy and religion
at Regent College, Vancouver, will
delve into the claim of some white
South Africans, that the Bible sanc
tions apartheid.
A street threatre group called
"Lamb's Head" will troop through
White Plaza and several freshman
dorms staging humorous versions of
gameshows and sonorous commer
cials next week.
Other Stanford Christians are or
ganizing a non-evangelical Social Ac
tion Fair coinciding with the last
three days of New Orientation
Week.
Fifty local service agencies will take
turns setting up information booths
in White Plaza. On Wednesday;
minority, counseling and hospital
groups will participate; on Thursday,
children, women, seniorcitizensand
prisoners groups; and Friday will
pick up political, consumer, ecology
housing and food concerns.
The groups hope to attract student
volunteers and to educate students
about the needs of the community
surrounding their campus.

groups will participate; on Thursday,
children, women, seniorcitizensand
prisoners groups; and Friday will
pick up political, consumer, ecology
housing and food concerns.
The groups hope to attract student
volunteers and to educate students
about the needs of the community
surrounding their campus.
"It's intellectually shortchanging
things to take all these humanities
and never get down and study the
Bible."
"We wanted to do something
again to make Christ an issue on
campus."
What these and other Stanford
Christians have come up with re
cently to fill the void of understand
ing about their beliefs is a "New
Orientation Week," beginning to
day.
Panels, speakers, music and street
theatre groups will seek to ignite
seriousthinking, said Jim Tilley, pres
ident of the Stanford Christian Fel
lowship (SCF).
The Christian world view is seen as
"irrelevant to intellectual things" on
campus and therefore ignored and
belittled as something for those who
don't have "the guts to commit
themselves to some humanistic vie
wpoint," said Tilley.
Recent Daily letters like one
claiming Christians are political
threats made Christians anxious to
get on with the week, said Dave Len
nert, a member of the SCF. If people
reject Christianity, they ought to at
least know what it is they're reject
ing, Lennert added.
")esus is not some institution, but

an active force inside of us," Tilley
said.
"Anyone who is in the modern
world and doesn't know what Christ
said is really missing it," added Rick
Harpel, another SCF member.
"Christianity is more than just a
weekend thing," Harpel said. It af
fects your orientation to South Af
rica, world hunger and other crying
needs, he added.
One speaker who capsulizes these
concerns is a business man from
Boulder, Colorado named Gene
Thomas. "His real occupation is lov
ing anyone who stumbles across his
path," Tilley said.
Thomas runs a half-way house in
Boulder for street people "washed
out by society," Lennert said.
"His rugs get burnt out every six
months and his house gets
wrecked," he said. "He represents a
wholly new kind of loving — intense
personal self-sacrifice for the sake of
the one being loved," Lennert ad
ded.
Thomas' topic for his three lec
tures on Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday will be "What ]esus Re
ally Taught."
Another personality lecturing dur
ing the week is rock artist Larry Nor
man, pioneer of Christian rock 'n'

roll.
Norman, who runs and owns his
own record label, will speak on
"Christ, Music and Culture" to con
clude the week.
"He comes across to me as a per
son who is no hypocrite," said Len
nert. "He'll get down equally on
Christians and non-Christians."
Though Christian mavericks like
Thomas and Norman are ready to
speak what they take tor truth, the
week is not meant to be a "pushy"
publicity campaign, according to
Harpel.
"Bumper sticker Christianity de
means the dignity of Christianity and
the seriousness of it in our lives," he
added.
"Everyone involved respects the
opinions of non-Christians," said
Harpel. The sponsors are sensitive to
past abuses by Christians indented in
many people's minds, and will not
"clobber anyone over the head" with
their beliefs, he added.
But some tension may result. "The
nature of the message calls for com
mitment and it's offensive to some
people," he said. "But it isn't meant
to be pushy."
To kick off the week tonight,
Professor of Material Sciences
Richard Bubeand Stanford graduates
Paul Larson, pastor of Peninsula Co
venant Church, and Peter Payne, of
Inter-Varsity staff, will discuss
whether Christians are psychologi
cally conditioned to believe as they
do.
Saturday night Dr. Irving Hexam,
professor of philosophy and religion
at Regent College, Vancouver, will
delve into the claim of some white
South Africans, that the Bible sanc
tions apartheid.
A street threatre group called
"Lamb's Head" will troop through
White Plaza and several freshman
dorms staging humorous versions of
gameshows and sonorous commer
cials next week.
Other Stanford Christians are or
ganizing a non-evangelical Social Ac
tion Fair coinciding with the last
three days of New Orientation
Week.
Fifty local service agencies will take
turns setting up information booths
in White Plaza. On Wednesday;
minority, counseling and hospital
groups will participate; on Thursday,
children, women, seniorcitizensand
prisoners groups; and Friday will
pick up political, consumer, ecology
housing and food concerns.
