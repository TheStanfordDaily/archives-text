# What de Beauvoir offered
## A 						shelter from the storm 
### 
Ellen Byrne

Fall quarter, when the new resi
dents of Simone de Beauvoir (also
known as Androgyny and Mystery)
House arrived, there were no beds or
desks in the rooms, no pots in the
kitchen, and the house's cracking
foundation had not been repaired
over the summer. Several weeks pas
sed before the house had the basic
equipment that it needed, and not all
that was provided was satisfactory.
During Dead Week winter quarter,
the House received a memo asking
for information about how the next
year's residential education re
quirements would be fulfilled. After
a week and a half of meetings and
memos, on Wednesday of Finals
Week, the House was informed that
it will be replaced by the new Ger
man Theme House.
Is this the case of benign neglect or
complicated conspiracy on the part
of the many offices and adminis
trators who control our housing? If
the theme house was ever taken
seriously by the Row Office, why
were some 40 people, some of whom
had never lived in a co-op before,
forced to start out the year without
pots to cook in?
Evaluation poorly planned
Without answering these ques
tions, I can say that it is clear that the
house, potentially one of Stanford's
most disturbing, catalytic and excit
ing resources, was evaluated and un
ceremoniously axed during the two
weeks of the quarter when its resi
dents were least able to defend
themselves. The house was termi
nated before the draw when stu
dents show their preference for
housing, and both the co-op and the
theme were given less than a year to
develop.
Stanford desperately needs de
Beauvoir House, as it needs
feminism for both men and women.
It needs alternative housing ar
rangements like co-ops, where stu
dents can learn to feed each other
and clean up after themselves, living
independently of the usual Univer
sity bureaucracy.
De Beauvoir House represents a
unique resourceon this campus. Asa
community formed with the explicit
purpose of providing a supportive
environment for the examination of
sex roles (and much more) it can only
challenge all of us. Most of the be
havior seemingly demanded of us if

we are to survive at the University is
sexist. De Beauvoir House is one of
the few places where men in particu
lar are encouraged to change this.
Stanford's ethos is overwhelm
ingly sexist. This is because many of
us are here so we can be successful in
the future. The University prepares
us accordingly. Power and success in
our society are associated with so
called masculine traits of aggressive
ness, competition, assertiveness and
the possible threat of violence.
Passivity, politeness, a quiet voice
and uncertainty — normally consi
dered female traits — connote
weakness and therefore an inability
to succeed. In our community, com
petition, individualism and lonely
aggressiveness are the unarticulated
but unquestioned prerequisites for
successful careers.
Developing traits
To make our time here more
human and less lonely, we might first
consider androgyny, just as the
theme house did. The traits of ra
tionality, strength, determination
and aggressiveness, always assigned
to the male, should be allowed to
develop in women also. The qualities
of nurture, emotional insight expres
siveness and tenderness should be
encouraged in men, and both sexes
can learn to look for these qualities in
one another and not just the oppo
site sex.
This is the first result of an explora
tion into feminism, and shows us the
first reasons why feminism is not just
a woman's issue. There is much for
men to regain and claim as their own
in the free space where human qual
ities and work are not artificially de
signated as male or female.
Is this enough? Androgyny
changed its name to Simone de
Beauvoir House because it thought
that she had contributed something
to the University and the house's de
velopment even if she hadn't do
nated a row house. The house consi
dered feminism to be a better ex
pression of their philosophy; an
drogyny being a possible part but not
the whole of women's equality.
If Stanford people were all to be
come more androgynous, our com
munity would undoubtedly become
a richerand more supportive place to
live in. However, when I was speak
ing toa woman friend about the need
for de Beauvoir to continue and the

benefits of feminism for men, she
asked me whether feminism for men
and for Stanford is a question of be
nefits or necessity.
Chance for expression
What de Beauvoir House might
have continued into, and what Stan
ford needs, is a real expression of
equality for women. This goes far
beyond the male benefits of break
ing down sex roles to free human
potential.
The things that men must consider
and begin to change their attitudes
towards are those things that are still
"women's issues." Rape prevention,
contraception and abortion
are women's issues because it
"happens" to her. Our society needs
to examine the male role in these
issues, as well as the incredible level
of violence against women that is ac
cepted in movies and real life.
Stanford neither encourages nor
gives us time to think about these
things. De Beauvoir House has been
a small shelter from the storm where
men and women could begin to reas
sess their patterning. With the alter
natives to fraternities, sororities and
sterile dorm life diminishing, it
should be fought for.

ing toa woman friend about the need
for de Beauvoir to continue and the

benefits of feminism for men, she
asked me whether feminism for men
and for Stanford is a question of be
nefits or necessity.
Chance for expression
What de Beauvoir House might
have continued into, and what Stan
ford needs, is a real expression of
equality for women. This goes far
beyond the male benefits of break
ing down sex roles to free human
potential.
The things that men must consider
and begin to change their attitudes
towards are those things that are still
"women's issues." Rape prevention,
contraception and abortion
are women's issues because it
"happens" to her. Our society needs
to examine the male role in these
issues, as well as the incredible level
of violence against women that is ac
cepted in movies and real life.
Stanford neither encourages nor
gives us time to think about these
things. De Beauvoir House has been
a small shelter from the storm where
men and women could begin to reas
sess their patterning. With the alter
natives to fraternities, sororities and
sterile dorm life diminishing, it
should be fought for.

Fall quarter, when the new resi
dents of Simone de Beauvoir (also
known as Androgyny and Mystery)
House arrived, there were no beds or
desks in the rooms, no pots in the
kitchen, and the house's cracking
foundation had not been repaired
over the summer. Several weeks pas
sed before the house had the basic
equipment that it needed, and not all
that was provided was satisfactory.
During Dead Week winter quarter,
the House received a memo asking
for information about how the next
year's residential education re
quirements would be fulfilled. After
a week and a half of meetings and
memos, on Wednesday of Finals
Week, the House was informed that
it will be replaced by the new Ger
man Theme House.
Is this the case of benign neglect or
complicated conspiracy on the part
of the many offices and adminis
trators who control our housing? If
the theme house was ever taken
seriously by the Row Office, why
were some 40 people, some of whom
had never lived in a co-op before,
forced to start out the year without
pots to cook in?
Evaluation poorly planned
Without answering these ques
tions, I can say that it is clear that the
house, potentially one of Stanford's
most disturbing, catalytic and excit
ing resources, was evaluated and un
ceremoniously axed during the two
weeks of the quarter when its resi
dents were least able to defend
themselves. The house was termi
nated before the draw when stu
dents show their preference for
housing, and both the co-op and the
theme were given less than a year to
develop.
Stanford desperately needs de
Beauvoir House, as it needs
feminism for both men and women.
It needs alternative housing ar
rangements like co-ops, where stu
dents can learn to feed each other
and clean up after themselves, living
independently of the usual Univer
sity bureaucracy.
De Beauvoir House represents a
unique resourceon this campus. Asa
community formed with the explicit
purpose of providing a supportive
environment for the examination of
sex roles (and much more) it can only
challenge all of us. Most of the be
havior seemingly demanded of us if

we are to survive at the University is
sexist. De Beauvoir House is one of
the few places where men in particu
lar are encouraged to change this.
Stanford's ethos is overwhelm
ingly sexist. This is because many of
us are here so we can be successful in
the future. The University prepares
us accordingly. Power and success in
our society are associated with so
called masculine traits of aggressive
ness, competition, assertiveness and
the possible threat of violence.
Passivity, politeness, a quiet voice
and uncertainty — normally consi
dered female traits — connote
weakness and therefore an inability
to succeed. In our community, com
petition, individualism and lonely
aggressiveness are the unarticulated
but unquestioned prerequisites for
successful careers.
Developing traits
To make our time here more
human and less lonely, we might first
consider androgyny, just as the
theme house did. The traits of ra
tionality, strength, determination
and aggressiveness, always assigned
to the male, should be allowed to
develop in women also. The qualities
of nurture, emotional insight expres
siveness and tenderness should be
encouraged in men, and both sexes
can learn to look for these qualities in
one another and not just the oppo
site sex.
This is the first result of an explora
tion into feminism, and shows us the
first reasons why feminism is not just
a woman's issue. There is much for
men to regain and claim as their own
in the free space where human qual
ities and work are not artificially de
signated as male or female.
Is this enough? Androgyny
changed its name to Simone de
Beauvoir House because it thought
that she had contributed something
to the University and the house's de
velopment even if she hadn't do
nated a row house. The house consi
dered feminism to be a better ex
pression of their philosophy; an
drogyny being a possible part but not
the whole of women's equality.
If Stanford people were all to be
come more androgynous, our com
munity would undoubtedly become
a richerand more supportive place to
live in. However, when I was speak
ing toa woman friend about the need
for de Beauvoir to continue and the
