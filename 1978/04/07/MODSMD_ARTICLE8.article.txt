# Concert publicity corrected
## 
### 
I wish to correct certain statements
I was supposed to have made in an
article last quarter on the difficulties
of promoting concerts on campus
(Feb. 21). While the article did not
quote me incorrectly in any specific
instance, there are statements taken
out of the context of a long conversa
tion which are incorrect.
To begin with, I can not be quoted
as saying "abou* half of Graham's
concerts lose money," when I do not
know or have any idea.
Secondly, when Bill Graham
breaks a minor act, there is no con
tractual agreement that the group
must play for him should they gain in
popularity.
Third, I never said Bill Graham
drove around in a "pickup truck"
with a staple gun. Furthermore, I
never called Berkeley's Special
Events a "doorplate." I did say that
their close proximity made it ex
tremely difficult if not impossible for

them to compete effectively.
Finally, at the beginning and at the
end of the interview I told the repor
ter that I wanted copy approval on
the article before it ran. I was not
allowed to see the article nor was I
even informed that the article was
even printed until the day it ran.
I would like to apologize to Bill
Graham and his organization for any
bad publicity or misrepresentation
this article might have created.
Mark Curtis
ASSU Special Events
(Editor's note: Richard Bowditch,
the reporter who wrote "Concerts
here face problems" agrees that he
erred as Curtis says, and that the tone
of the story did not reflect Curtis'
opinions. Bowditch maintains, how
ever, that Curtis did use the term
"doorplate" during the interview.
We regret that these errors occur
red and apologize to Curtis and Bill

Graham Presents for publishing
them.
With regard to "copy approval" of
an article, it is the policy of the Daily -
and of most other newspapers - to
discourage reporters offering sources
the opportunity to approve or disap
prove articles or portions of articles
after they have been written.
The reasons for this are both prac
tical and ethical. Tracking down
sources to approve every word of an
article wreaks havoc on deadlines
and many sources would have us
produce nothing but carefully tai
lored public relations pieces.
A journalist's dream is for every ut
terance to be on the record and pre
served untarnished in print. This
doesn't happen terribly often. But
any reservations, restrictions and
concerns that a source might have
should be raised and agreed upon
before an interview commences.)
