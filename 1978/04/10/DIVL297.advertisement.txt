The United States Marine Corps is contin
ually looking to the nation's colleges and univer
sities for a few good men with the potential to lead
Marines.
Men selected for Marine officer programs
attend pre-commission training either in summer
sessions between academic years, or after college
graduation.
There are two basic officer programs, Platoon
Leaders Class (PLC) and Officer Candidate Class
(OCC). In addition to ground officer preparation,
each program has aviation options. Men qualified
for training either as future pilots or flight officers
are guaranteed post-comission aviation training
before they enroll.
In terms of monetary incentives it is important
to realize that the amount an officer is paid is
based on length of service as well as rank. Your
longevitey is counted from the time you enter one of
our college programs. Begin PLC in your freshman
year, and you II have a three year advantage over
the senior enrolled in OCC. In dollars and cents
that can mean over $1,850 in additional annual
compensation after commissioning.
Another monetary plus is the financial assist
ance that selected PLC members can receive. You
could get $100 each month of the school year in
exchange for additional active duty obligations.
This assistance may be payable for up to three
years. That's a total of $2,700.
