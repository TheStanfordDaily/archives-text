EARN OVER $ 650 A MONTH
RIGHT THROUGH YOUR
SENIOR YEAR.
If you're a junior or a senior majoring in math, physics or
engineering, the Navy has a program you should know about.
It's called the Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate-
Collegiate Program (NUPOC-C for short) and if you qualify,
you can earn as much as $650 a month right through your
senior year. Then after 16 weeks of Officer Candidate School,
you'll receive an additional year of advanced technical
education. This would cost you thousands in a civilian school,
but in the Navy, we pay you. And at the end of the year of
training, you'll receive a $3,000 cash bonus.
It isn't easy. There are fewer than 400 openings and only
one of every six applicants will be selected. But if you make
it, you'll have qualified for an elite engineering training
program. With unequaled hands-on responsibility, a $24,000
salary in four years, and gilt-edged qualifications for jobs
in private industry should you decide to leave the Navy
later. (But we don't think you'll want to.)
Ask your placement officer to set up an interview with a
Navy representative when he visits the campus on April 13,
or contact your Navy representative at 415-273-7377 (collect).
If you prefer, send your resume to the Navy Nuclear Officer
Program, Code 312-8468, 4015 Wilson Blvd., Arlington,
Va, 22203, and a Navy representative will contact you directly.
The NUPOC-Collegiate Program. It can do more than help
you finish college: it can lead to an exciting career opportunity.
NAVY OFFICER.
ITS NOT JUST A JOB, IT'S AN ADVENTURE.
