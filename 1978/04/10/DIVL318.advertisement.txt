Vc don't have John
Muir on our staff. . .
But we do have a lot of naturalists almost as good.
If you'd like to spend two, three or five days in
Yosemite studying birds, trees, rocks, glaciers,
flowers, stars, Indians, meadows, reptiles, amphi
bians or go on a six-day field trip into the Clark
Range and get UCB Extension credit, let us know.
We'll send you a catalog of the field classes we're
offering this summer.
