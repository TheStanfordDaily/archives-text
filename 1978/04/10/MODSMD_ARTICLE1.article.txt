# SOC accepts compromise to $1000
## 
### Sara Lessley 
Senate members reached an ag
reement Friday to compromise over
the controversial $1700 allotment
approved last week by the SOC slate
of the ASSU Senate for SOC Dis
orientation Week.
Seven non-Stanford Organizing
Committee senators were joined by
other students in circulating a peti
tion to annul the senate act following
the Tuesday night action.
Students have the power to annul
any senate act with the signatures of
5 per cent of the student body calling
foran election on the act in question.
In this case about 600 signatures
would have been necessary.
At a Senate Finance Committee
meeting, both sides "agreed to com
promise." Senate Chairperson Fred
Grethel said SOC learned that Dis
orientation Week funding would re
ceive money from several "unex
pected sources" and thus the SOC
slate would be willing to com
promise on the amount of the senate
allocation.
Grethel said he and other SOC
members wanted to "make the tenor
of the week better and avoid infight
ing" between senate members and
students.
Next meeting
Sen. Doug Bandow, who originally
helped initiate the petition, said one
of the SOC members will move to
reconsider the original approval of
$1700 at the next senate meeting. He
added that a member of the "win
ning side" has to make the move to
reconsider the vote.
Bandow said it was agreed that a
new figure of $1000 would be prop
osed. The "crisis is over" and the pet
ition drive is being closed down
since it is now "unnecessary," he
said.
Bandow and other opposition
senators originally objected to al
locating $1700, 40 per cent of the se
nate discretionary fund, to one pro
ject.
The petition attempt was "proba
bly the catalyzing effect . . i it
equalized the bargaining power,"
Bandow said.
Tone 'muted'
According to Grethel, the tone of
the meeting was "muted." Several of
the "opposition feel glory in (heir
victory," Grethel said, but "it's not a
victory." With the other funding
sources, he said, SOC Disorientation
Week funding doesn't need as much
money from the senate. Grethel said
the extra funding sources were not
assured at the time of Tuesday's se
nate meeting.
The other funding sources include
the Career Planning and Placement
Center and the Council of Presi
dents, according to Co-president
Anne Henkels.
Henkels added that the COP will
not veto the senate action. A COP
veto is only possible within 72 hours
of a senate act. The deadline would
have been Friday evening.
Henkels said a COP veto would
only have been a "stalling tactic"
since such a veto can be overriden by
a majority vote. The SOC slate holds
a majority in the senate.
Disorientation Week, to be held
April 15-22, will be a "great thing for
the whole community," Henkels
said.
