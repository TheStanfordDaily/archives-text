# Christian basics presented

Tom Faletti

Welcome to New Orientation
Week. We are already in the midst of
this week-long look at the ideas and
teachings of one of the biggest radi
cals of his time.
He didn't teach about dialectical
class struggle, nor about economic
liberty and equality. Vet his teachings
stirred up the world so fundamen
tally that the effects are still seen to
day.
The man is Jesus Christ. He lived
more than 1900 years ago. And his
teachings still form the basis for
much of Western moral, political,
and social philosophy today.
On Monday, Tuesday, and Wed
nesday of this week, Gene Thomas
will be giving a series of hour-long
talks on "What |esus Really Taught."
This will not be a high-pressure job'
intended to twist your arm.
There will be no altar calls, no pro
fessions of faith asked for. But since
Jesus' teachings have had such a
drastic effect on society for so long,
we think everyone should know the
basics of what Christ taught.
Basic ideas emphasized
The purpose of New Orientation
Week is to present to Christians and
non-Christians alike the basic ideas
in Christ's teachings, in a challenging
and interesting way.
Much of what is published about
Christ is only a caricature of his
teachings. Much is untrue or taken
out of context. Even many Christians
do not have an accurate understand
ing of what Christ taught.
Many people won't go far enough

in following Christ's teachings; they
pick and choose but they don't un
derstand the full picture. Only then
can we accept or reject Christ's
teachings.
Why didwe call it New Orientation
Week? First, because Jesus tried to
give a new orientation, a different
perspective, to the thinking of the
people of his time. Second, because
those teachings can provide a new
perspective for us today, even for
Christians.
An even different perspective will
be given Thursday evening when
Larry Norman comes to speak on
"Christ, Music and Culture." Nor

man was one of the earliest Christian
rock music artists, and will give a dif
ferent perspective from that of more
traditional Christian musicians.
Social Fair coordinated
In conjunction with New Orienta
tion Week, there will be a Social Ac
tion Fair in White Plaza, Wednesday
through Friday.
The purpose of the Fair will be to
increase our consciousness of social
action issues and to provide informa
tion about how to help, as well as to
show specific ways in which Christ
ians are involved in social action.
