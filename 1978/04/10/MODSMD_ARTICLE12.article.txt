(This is a reprint of the famous "blue
flyer" distributed six months ago for
the ASSU elections.)
If the past is indeed prologue,
Stanford voters would be wise to
study the history of the ASSU Senate.
In the fall of 1975, the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC) ran a slate of
candidates for the ASSU Senate, cal
ling themselves the "Students Taking
A New Direction" or STAND. Their
campaign was successful — they
took 6 out of 10 seats — but their
performance fell far short of even
their own hopes and purposes. To
gether with the STAND graduate
senators and a leftist Council of Pres

idents, the radicals used the funds
and power of the ASSU Senate for
their own political interests, while
virtually ignoring the student body
they claimed to serve.
Today we see a slate of 17 candi
dates seeking to make history repeat
itself in the ASSU Senate. History has
shown there is great danger to stu
dents' freedom when their voices are
represented and money spent by a
slate with 17 votes and only one
ideology.
The current Council of Presidents
has worked closely with the SOC
slate. In fact, many feel the COP or
ganized the slate from the begin
ning. Their attempt to have a veto
proof, rubber-stamp Senate for pet
left-wing political causes spells
danger for responsible student poli
tics.
We urge you to elect candidates
who haveseen abuses of the pastand
are committed to fairness for a// view
points on campus; to elect inde
pendents who have not used their
offices in student government to
further their own political interests;
to elect believers in the power of the
individual rather than the power of
the mass, for we believe that each
student is more able to decide what
is best for himself than for a group of
left-wing idealogues in elected office
to tell them what they should think,
what they should vote on, and how
they should spend their money.
The mass emotion that charac
terized the Stanford campus in the
past has hopeful ly given way to a new
era of individual freedom of expres
sion and responsibility. Let's not re
surrect the ghost of power politics in
the student senate by electing a full
slate of candidates representing a
very narrow political viewpoint. Vote
independently. Vote responsibly.
Make your voice heard now, and
hopefully it will continue to be heard
this year in the ASSU Senate.
