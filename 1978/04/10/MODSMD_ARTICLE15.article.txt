# Outreach program offers rape prevention ideas

"One out of every 10 women
can expect to be assaulted."
This statement was made by
Marcia Quackenbush at a rape
forum held in Casa Zapata in
Stern Hall last Thursday night.
Quackenbush is responsible
for the organization and initia
tion of several rape discussion
groups around campus.
"The subject of rape needs
to be talked about more. There
are too many false ideas and
misconceptions," said Quac
kenbush. "These need to be
dispelled and replaced with an

attitude that recognizes the
threat of rape in our society
and acknowledges a need to
inform both men and women
about this threat."
The need for some type of
rape forum organization was
first recognized by Leah Kap
lan, assistant dean of student
affairs. Kaplan became aware
of a similar program taking
place on the Berkeley campus
and invited one of the organiz
ers of the Berkeley forums to
* speak here.
Because of her work at Cow
ell, Kaplan knew that more

rapes were committed here
than were reported, and for
that very reason felt that some
type of rape discussion group,
where students could become
more informed about the rape
situation, was necessary, ac
cording to Quackenbush.
Quackenbush, who works as
secretary for Kaplan in the Of
fice of Student Affairs, led the
discussion at Casa Zapata with
the help of Barry Corden, a re
sident of Roble Hall who be
came concerned about the
problem of rape after an inci
dent of attempted rape in

Roble earlier this year.
Quackenbush and Corden
said they hoped that the educa
tional presentation and ensu
ing discussion about rape
would break down some of the
barriers and bad attitudes that
help to perpetuate rape. They
said they feel people should be
aware of these attitudes and
the myths that accompany
rape.
Six previous forums were
held in campus residences last
quarter, and Quackenbush
said she would be glad to con
duct additional meetings this
quarter anywhere there is in
terest.
Among the 17 people attend
ing the presentation at Casa
Zapata, there was active par
ticipation in the discussion.
The first question of the even
ing concerned the definition of
rape.
Force situations
"When a woman tells a man
she has V.D. and he forces her
to perform fellatio, is this an
incident of rape?" asked
Quackenbush. Too often
people do not realize that any
situation in which a woman is
forced, to any degree, to have
sexual relations is an act of
rape, she added.
"There is no such thing as a
woman who asks to be raped,"
said Quackenbush. Suggestive
clothing, or walking alone at

night must not be considered
as invitations. What makes a
woman more likely to be raped
is her vulnerability, she
explained.
A man plans to commit an act
of rape 90 per cent of the time.
A woman becomes a rape vic
tom because she is in the
wrong place at the wrong time,
said Quackenbush.
No control
"No one wants to admit that
they might get raped. Women
don't want to recognize the
possibility of being in a situa
tion where they have no con
trol over what is happening to
them," Quackenbush com
mented.
Because of this fear, stu
dents agreed that rape has be
come a subject that is joked
about.
"This attitude causes people
to ignore the screams so often
heard in excitable living envi
ronments like dormitories,"
said Corden. •
Another common miscon
ception discussed was that
rapists are "losers" with no
other sources for sexual activ
ity. To disprove this, Corden
stated, "The profiles of 100
convicted rapists were com
pared to the psychological pro
files of 100 freshmen men at
Berkeley. The profiles were
remarkably similar. Further
more, most rapists have other

sexual outlets besides rape av
ailable to them."
"Rape is a problem on Stan
ford campus," said Quacken
bush. "What are some things
women can do to protect
themselves?"
Suggestions
Suggestions from the group
at Casa Zapata included: Make
friends with your neighbors in
the dorm, post your schedules
and keep them so others may
know where you are, be aware
of where the fire alarms are in
buildings and where the red
pull boxes are located around
campus. Don't hesitate to use
them. The red-lighted pull
boxes are meant to be pulled in
cases of emergency, and the
fire department will be on loca
tion within two minutes.
If you are being followed, or
are not sure, you may call the
Department of Public Safety at
any time and they have agreed
to provide an escort home for
you.
Women should not feel em
barrassed in asking a friend to
walk them home at night. Be
aware of potentially dangerous
situations and protect yourself
against a possible assault.
Quackenbush suggested wear
ing shoes you can run in, com
fortable clothing, and using
your common sense and intui
tion.

If you are assaulted, you
should dial 911. Even if all that
is said into the receiver is
"Help," if the receiver is left off
the hook, the phone company
can trace the call within two
minutes and alert the police.
"Ask yourself if you are wil
ling to make a scene in order to
get help," said Quackenbush.
Throw a rock through a win
dow, or yell out the names of
specific people who can help
you in the dorm. Stall for time,
and always leave yourself ah
out.
Corden claimed that within
eight to 10 seconds after a man
has approached a woman, hfc
has decided whether to assault
her or not. The key is not to
appear vulnerable. Running
away may not be such a good
thing. Turn and confront thf
man. Ask him what he's doing-.
Off guard
"This will throw him off his
guard," said Quackenbush*
"Screaming makes you appear
more vulnerable. Loud shout
ing and swearing is a better
idea. Assume an assertive al
titude."
It's important that men alsb
think about and discuss the
rape problem, said Corden.
Through not laughing or crack
ing jokes, but by being suppof
tive, men can help alleviate the
problem, he added.

Residents of Casa Zapata in Stern Hall met with representatives of a rape outreach program last Thursday
night to discuss common myths about rape and ways in which students here can deal with the problem.
