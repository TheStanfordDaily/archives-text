# Entertainment business practices questioned
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP)—lt has all the
lements of a blockbuster
lovie hit: Big name stars, pro
essional and personal risk,
ourtroom and executive suite
Irama. But it isn't a movie. It's a
eal-life conflict that is spread
ng through the film, television
ind recording industries.
The conflict centers on ac
:ounting and other business
jractices of major entertain

ment firms, especially how
they divide profits among ac
tors, musicians, producers, di
rectors, writers and others with
profit-sharing contracts.
Major movie studios are ac
cused of padded production
charges, among them studio
overhead and payroll taxes;
improper allocation of adver
tising expenses; and the inclu
sion of foreign taxes in a film's

cost.
In turn, they are credited
against a studio's federal in
come taxes, so they get some
of the money back.
The object of all that, indus
try critics say, is to inflate a
movie's cost and delay the
break-even point, which must
be reached before actors, pro
ducers, writers and others
share in the profits.

The studios reply that most
questions involve minor cleri
cal errors and disagreements
over contract clauses and that
there is no pattern of abuse.
The conflicts are increasing
at a time when Hollywood al
ready is under intense public
scrutiny due to the "Begelman
Affair." David Begelman, Col
umbia Pictures' TV-movie
chief, has been charged with

grand theft and forgery for
misappropriating $40,000 from
the company and others earlier
this year.
In television, the disputes
involve an accounting system
that results in hugely popular
shows such as "Happy Days,"
"All In The Family" and"The
Mary Tyler Moore Show"
showing paper losses during
most of their original network
runs. Here, too, those who
would share in profits claim
that studies often use book
keeping devices to make a
winner look like a loser with no
profits to share.
The studios say the problem
is caused by the networks,
which allegedly so control the
industry that they can get away
with paying the studios less
than the programs really cost.
In the recording business,
similar complaints by singers,
musicians, music publishers
and others involve royalty
payments on the sale of re
cords. Those people charge
that recording firms some
times hide sales and profits to
avoid paying royalties.
The firms deny it.
At stake is a share in hun
dreds of millions of dollars in
annual profits from movies,
television programs abnd re
cords and tapes.
