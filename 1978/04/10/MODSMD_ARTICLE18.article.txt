## Cards dumped in lacrosse fete

The Los Angeles Lacrosse Association team overcame a com
eback threat and heavy penalty assessments to defeat the San
Francisco Lacrosse Club 11-8 yesterday in the championship
game of the Western States Regional Lacrosse Tournament.
The Stanford team did not demonstate the same power and
grace it had last year in defending the tournament championship
this year. The Cardinals lost their first two games, 9-2 and 4-2. But
they salvaged a 9-5 win over Sacramento in their final game.
Teams from five different states participated in the weekend
tournament, including squads from Arizona, Oregon and Sac
ramento.
The Los Angeles team overwhelmed its opponents in the first
two rounds, and then narrowly defeated the Palo Alto club 8-7 to
reach the final bracket. L.A outscored its opponents 46-15
through the first three games.
Similarly, the San Francisco club soundly defeated the teams it
played, although with smaller score differences. The club suf
fered numerous injuries through the early rounds, which may
have been a factor in their loss in the final game.
Through the first half, the game remained close as San Fran
cisco dominated possession of the ball. At one stretch, it missed
six consecutive shots within a short period, and lost the oppor
tunity to grab a quick lead. The half ended with L.A. ahead 6-5.
In the third quarter, after San Francisco scored to tie the game
at 6-6, L.A. blew the game open with five consecutive goals to put
the game away. However, L.A.'s confidence was shaken in the
final quarter, as San Francisco staged a strong comeback attempt
with two quick goals. But L.A. shut down San Francisco the rest of
the way with an aggressive defense for an 11-8 win.
)im Lewis, former Navy All-American, credited his team's vic
tory to "the influx of young players and a more positive attitude."
He added, "We're playing a better brand of lacrosse, passing
more and running less." Another L.A. attributed the victory to
"plain old teamwork and hustle."
Al Cummings, the San Francisco team captain, offered "no
excuses for the loss." He agreed with Lewis, recognizing L.A.'s
strength coming from the new players it had picked up over the
year.
