Los Angeles — For the first
time in Stanford tennis history,
the Cards beat both UCLA and
USC on the same weekend in
Los Angeles. Paced by
freshman phenom |ohn McEn
roe's undefeated weekend in
L.A., the Cards proved their
No. 1 national ranking by beat
ing both No. 6 USC and No. 2
UCLA.
"When you beat UCLA and
USC on consecutive days on
their home courts, which are
much slower and different
from what we usually practice
on, that's quite a feat," said
Stanford coach Dick Could.
"When you throw in capacity
crowds which are extremely

partisan, that's really amaz
ing."
Friday Wimbledon
semifinalist McEnroe crushed
USC's freshman sensation
Robert Van't Hof by the amaz
ing score of 6-0, 6-0. He then
teamed up with Bill Maze to
win the first doubles match 6-3,
6-3 over Van't Hof and Chris
Lewis.
But the Cards won the match
in the doubles as they took two
of three. Last year's No.
1-ranked college doubles team
of Matt Mitchell and Perry
Wright provided the clincher
with a 6-1, 7-5 victory over
USC's second doubles team ot
Buzzy Strode and Glenn Pet
rovic.
The match win was the

Cards' 11th win in their last 12
matches against the Trojans.
The Saturday match was bil
led by UCLA coach Glenn Bas
set as the greatest in college
history. In the battle of un
beatens Stanford (11-0) and
UCLA (15-0) squared off in
front of an overflow crowd of
2200 at UCLA's tennis stadium.
In the feature match, the top
two ranked amateurs in the na
tion — McEnroe and UCLA's
Eliot Teltscher — faced off. Last
September Teltscher had
beaten "Mac" in a pro tourna
ment in Los Angeles. This time
however the outcome was
turned around.
After dropping the first set
6-2 and behind 5-3 in the sec
ond with Teltscher serving for

the match at 3-all, McEnroe hit
an incredible backhand angled
passing shot for the service
break. Card coach Dick Gould
described the shot as "impos
sible" because McEnroe
seemed out of position.
After that McEnroe took
charge, winning the second set
7-5 and the third 6-3 to estab
lish himself as the top college
player in the nation.
Mitchell bounced back from
his singles defeat Friday and
played a solid match to defeat
UCLA's tough baseliner Rob
bie Ventnor, 6-4, 7-5. Peter Re
nnert fought off three match
points to beat Fritz Buenningin
a battle of tie-breakers 7-6,6-7,
7-6.
But the Bruins also won
three singles matches to dead
lock the Cards at 3-3 and rain
postponed the deciding dou
bles matches until yesterday.
In the doubles matches,
Pacific Coast Doubles Champ
ions McEnroe and Bill Maze
had few problems in beating
John Austin and Bruce Nichols
£-3, 6-2. A 6-3,6-3 win by Buen
king and Mike Harrington over
Jennert and Jim Hodges put
the outcome of the match on
the final doubles competition.
Mitchell and Wright rallied
in the first set for a 7-6 win and
then cruised to a 6-2 triumph to
take the match.
"I'm really quite pleased
with our team," said Gould.
"But you know we really ha
ven't had everyone on our
team playing well at the same
time. When that happens, we'll
be awful tough to beat."
Gould calied the triumph the
Cards' third big achievement
of the season, the other two
being the National Team In
door Championship and the
downing of Trinity a few weeks
ago.
