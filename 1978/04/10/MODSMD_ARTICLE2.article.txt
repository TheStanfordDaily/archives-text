Sail boats, canoes, rafts and swimmers on Lake Lag came under fire yester
day as approximately 150 residents of Florence Moore — particularly
Gavilan, I oro and Paloma Houses — stormed the lake, hurling hundreds of
water balloons at their victims. The ensuing battle lasted for approximately
45 minutes, until the group decided to return to a keg of beer at Gavilan
house. Commented one slightly-wasted participant: "Ho Hay! So this is the
collegiate life."
