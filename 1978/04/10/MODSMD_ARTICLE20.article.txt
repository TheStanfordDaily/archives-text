# Card volleyballers upset
## 
### Ken Betts 
The Stanford men's volleyball team saw its
slim hopes for a NCAA regional bid almost van
ish as it fell to Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo Friday
night 3-15, 5-15 and 11-15 in Maples Pavilion.
Coach Art Lambert was hard pressed to find a
reason for his club's collapse, but he said, "They
just didn't want to play."
The first game of the match was close only
briefly at 2-2. That was the closest Stanford came
to leading as Cal Poly ran off a string of nine
straight points before Stanford could retaliate.
The second game began a bit more auspici
ously as Stanford led early, 5-3. The Cards
looked much sharper on defense and their
spikes were finding open holes. But, as in the
first game, they came unglued, and Cal Poly ran
off 12 unanswered points to win the contest
15-5.
In the third game the Cards appeared to be on
the verge of putting it all together as they fought
back from an early 5-1 deficit to tie the contest at
5-5. Unfortunately, that was all the noise Stan
ford made because it quickly fell behind 11-5
and eventually lost 15-11.
This was not the same team that trounced Cal

Thursday night, and its apparent lack of intensity
left Lambert mystified. "I couldn't even begin to
tell you what went wrong out there. Nothing we
tried succeeded, and it looked as though no one
even cared," he said.
The sharp passing, good setting, and power
ful spiking, all in evidence against Berkeley,
were completely missing when the Cards bat
tled Cal Pol). Stanford's inability to dig balls out
came back to haunt them Friday, as it let many
spikes drop in for easy points. The Cards were
often caught out of position, and generally
lacked the tight defense they showed Thursday.
. The loss all but destroyed any chance Stanford
had of receiving a regional bid. Lambert
explained, "If we had a ghost of a chance be
fore, we have absolutely none now."
In retrospect, however, the season has been
quite successful. The Cards had an 8-0 division
record. The team also matured rapidly, and will
definitely be even stronger next year with only
two players lost to graduation.
The Cards' next matches will be April 14 and 15
when they compete in the Nor-Cal Conference
Championship to be played in Berkeley.
