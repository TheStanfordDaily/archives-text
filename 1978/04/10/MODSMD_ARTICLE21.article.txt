# The 						Farm's busy weekend
## Takes UCLA series Stanford powers to top 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford Cardinal
baseball team rattled the pow
erful UCLA Bruins over the
weekend and immediately put
itself on top of the Pacific-8
Southern Division as the Cards
took two of three games from
UCLA in the opening series of
1978 league play at Sunken
Diamond.
The Cards won the opener
Friday, 8-7 in 10 innings. They
split the doubleheader Satur
day, pulling out a 10-9 victory in
the last inning of the first con
test, then falling to the Bruins
4-2 in the second game.
Stanford's league record of
2-1 puts it in uncontested first
place in its division of the
Pac-8, ahead of both USC and
Cal, who had their weekend
series shortened to two games
due to a wet field. The two
teams split their doubleheader
Saturday.
Meanwhile, the Cardinals
are off to a radically different
start in league this year as
compared to last when they
opened against USC and lost
the first three games.
"We're a little disap
pointed," Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess commented
about the loss on Saturday,
"but looking back, we did well
to take two out of three . . .
both come from behind vic
tories," Marquess said. "The
positive thing is," Marquess
continued, "whether we won
or lost, it was a complete tur
naround from the way we had
been playing. We finally swung
the bat and got out of our
slump."
In Friday's game the Cardi
nals tallied 10 hits and three of
the six homeruns in the extra

inning affair. Stanford jumped
out to a 1-0 lead in the first in
ning of the seesaw contest, but
a solo home run by Bruin
shortstop Mobil Cox tied the
score in the top of the second.
Stanford added another run in
the bottom half of that inning,
but UCLA answered in the top
of the thi rd with three runs on a
two-run homer by catcher
Dennis Delany and a well exe
cuted squeeze play by outfiel
der Dan Causepohl.
Stanford added another run
in the fourth; then with two
men down in the fifth, the
Cards took the lead 5-4 on a
Randy Wong homerun with
Larry Reynolds on first base.
Pitcher Mark Abbondola, in re
lief of Stanford starter Rob Ir
win, ran into some control
problems in the seventh by
walking two UCLA batters and
then giving leftfielder Craig
Johnson too good of a pitch
which Johnson sent out of the
park.
Second baseman Todd Ervin
tied the score at 7-7 in the bot
tom of the seventh with a two
run homerun — the first of his
Stanford career.
Guardino wins it
Leading off the bottom of the
10th, Stanford first baseman
Tom Guardino looked at a
couple of ace reliever Scott
Bollens' pitches and then with
one swing of the bat won the
game for the Cards by pound
ing a homerun 425 feet over the
left field fence.
The first game was similar to
Friday's game, including
another game-winning per
formance by Guardino. Stan
ford collected three runs in the
first inning, but starter Brian
Harrison was missing some

thing out on the mound and
had difficulty finding the plate
in the three innings he pitched.
Control problems
After walking the first three
batters he faced in the top of
the fourth, Harrison was re
lieved by junior Bruce Fiala. He
allowed a sacrifice fly, a walk,
and two solid base hits to right
field as UCLA scored five runs.
The Cards scored once in the
fifth and sixth, but UCLA
scored two in both the sixth
and seventh innings.
After Johnson's two-run
homerun off Fiala in the
seventh, Joe LoPresti took over
on the mound and held UCLA
scoreless for the rest of the
game.
In the bottom of the eighth
the Cards made it 9-7. In the
ninth, John Pyle, who was play
ing in place of leftfielder in
jured Pepe Hinojosa, .led
things off with a single to
center.
Ervin drew a walk and a pas
sed ball advanced both run
ners. Reynolds came through
with a clutch two-bagger to
center to tie the game. Then
with two outs, Guardino sing
led home Reynolds from third.
In the second game, both
starters — Stanford's Larry
Kuhn and UCLA's Tim O'Neill
— went the distance, with the
Bruins taking the 4-2 decision.
Kuhn walked in a run in the
fourth to put the Bruins ahead,
and a sacrifice fly by John Vio
lette added another.
The Bruins extended their
lead to 4-0 with two unearned
runs in the seventh, but Guar
dino continued his hot series at
the plate with a moon shot over
the outer fence in left field in
the bottom of the inning.
But the Cards could only
muster another run in the
eighth before going quietly in
the ninth. "We had to win,"
said Adams. "If we had lost this
one we'd be three games out of
first place, whereas by winning
we're only one game behind.
And that's a big difference."

Larry Reynolds crosses the plate with another Stanford run against UCLA. Reynolds scored the winning
run in the Cards' comeback win in the opening game of Saturday's doubleheader. The Cards took the
series, two games to one.
The Stanford Cardinal
baseball team rattled the pow
erful UCLA Bruins over the
weekend and immediately put
itself on top of the Pacific-8
Southern Division as the Cards
took two of three games from
UCLA in the opening series of
1978 league play at Sunken
Diamond.
The Cards won the opener
Friday, 8-7 in 10 innings. They
split the doubleheader Satur
day, pulling out a 10-9 victory in
the last inning of the first con
test, then falling to the Bruins
4-2 in the second game.
Stanford's league record of
2-1 puts it in uncontested first
place in its division of the
Pac-8, ahead of both USC and
Cal, who had their weekend
series shortened to two games
due to a wet field. The two
teams split their doubleheader
Saturday.
Meanwhile, the Cardinals
are off to a radically different
start in league this year as
compared to last when they
opened against USC and lost
the first three games.
"We're a little disap
pointed," Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess commented
about the loss on Saturday,
"but looking back, we did well
to take two out of three . . .
both come from behind vic
tories," Marquess said. "The
positive thing is," Marquess
continued, "whether we won
or lost, it was a complete tur
naround from the way we had
been playing. We finally swung
the bat and got out of our
slump."
In Friday's game the Cardi
nals tallied 10 hits and three of
the six homeruns in the extra

inning affair. Stanford jumped
out to a 1-0 lead in the first in
ning of the seesaw contest, but
a solo home run by Bruin
shortstop Mobil Cox tied the
score in the top of the second.
Stanford added another run in
the bottom half of that inning,
but UCLA answered in the top
of the thi rd with three runs on a
two-run homer by catcher
Dennis Delany and a well exe
cuted squeeze play by outfiel
der Dan Causepohl.
Stanford added another run
in the fourth; then with two
men down in the fifth, the
Cards took the lead 5-4 on a
Randy Wong homerun with
Larry Reynolds on first base.
Pitcher Mark Abbondola, in re
lief of Stanford starter Rob Ir
win, ran into some control
problems in the seventh by
walking two UCLA batters and
then giving leftfielder Craig
Johnson too good of a pitch
which Johnson sent out of the
park.
Second baseman Todd Ervin
tied the score at 7-7 in the bot
tom of the seventh with a two
run homerun — the first of his
Stanford career.
Guardino wins it
Leading off the bottom of the
10th, Stanford first baseman
Tom Guardino looked at a
couple of ace reliever Scott
Bollens' pitches and then with
one swing of the bat won the
game for the Cards by pound
ing a homerun 425 feet over the
left field fence.
The first game was similar to
Friday's game, including
another game-winning per
formance by Guardino. Stan
ford collected three runs in the
first inning, but starter Brian
Harrison was missing some

thing out on the mound and
had difficulty finding the plate
in the three innings he pitched.
Control problems
After walking the first three
batters he faced in the top of
the fourth, Harrison was re
lieved by junior Bruce Fiala. He
allowed a sacrifice fly, a walk,
and two solid base hits to right
field as UCLA scored five runs.
The Cards scored once in the
fifth and sixth, but UCLA
scored two in both the sixth
and seventh innings.
After Johnson's two-run
homerun off Fiala in the
seventh, Joe LoPresti took over
on the mound and held UCLA
scoreless for the rest of the
game.
In the bottom of the eighth
the Cards made it 9-7. In the
ninth, John Pyle, who was play
ing in place of leftfielder in
jured Pepe Hinojosa, .led
things off with a single to
center.
Ervin drew a walk and a pas
sed ball advanced both run
ners. Reynolds came through
with a clutch two-bagger to
center to tie the game. Then
with two outs, Guardino sing
led home Reynolds from third.
In the second game, both
starters — Stanford's Larry
Kuhn and UCLA's Tim O'Neill
— went the distance, with the
Bruins taking the 4-2 decision.
Kuhn walked in a run in the
fourth to put the Bruins ahead,
and a sacrifice fly by John Vio
lette added another.
The Bruins extended their
lead to 4-0 with two unearned
runs in the seventh, but Guar
dino continued his hot series at
the plate with a moon shot over
the outer fence in left field in
the bottom of the inning.
But the Cards could only
muster another run in the
eighth before going quietly in
the ninth. "We had to win,"
said Adams. "If we had lost this
one we'd be three games out of
first place, whereas by winning
we're only one game behind.
And that's a big difference."

jured Pepe Hinojosa, .led
things off with a single to
center.

center to tie the game. Then
with two outs, Guardino sing
led home Reynolds from third.
In the second game, both

Kuhn walked in a run in the
fourth to put the Bruins ahead,
and a sacrifice fly by John Vio
lette added another.
The Bruins extended their

But the Cards could only
muster another run in the
eighth before going quietly in
the ninth. "We had to win,"
said Adams. "If we had lost this
one we'd be three games out of

we're only one game behind.
And that's a big difference."

Larry Reynolds crosses the plate with another Stanford run against UCLA. Reynolds scored the winning
run in the Cards' comeback win in the opening game of Saturday's doubleheader. The Cards took the
series, two games to one.
The Stanford Cardinal
baseball team rattled the pow
erful UCLA Bruins over the
weekend and immediately put
itself on top of the Pacific-8
Southern Division as the Cards
took two of three games from
UCLA in the opening series of
1978 league play at Sunken
Diamond.
The Cards won the opener
Friday, 8-7 in 10 innings. They
split the doubleheader Satur
day, pulling out a 10-9 victory in
the last inning of the first con
test, then falling to the Bruins
4-2 in the second game.
Stanford's league record of
2-1 puts it in uncontested first
place in its division of the
Pac-8, ahead of both USC and
Cal, who had their weekend
series shortened to two games
due to a wet field. The two
teams split their doubleheader
Saturday.
Meanwhile, the Cardinals
are off to a radically different
start in league this year as
compared to last when they
opened against USC and lost
the first three games.
"We're a little disap
pointed," Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess commented
about the loss on Saturday,
"but looking back, we did well
to take two out of three . . .
both come from behind vic
tories," Marquess said. "The
positive thing is," Marquess
continued, "whether we won
or lost, it was a complete tur
naround from the way we had
been playing. We finally swung
the bat and got out of our
slump."
In Friday's game the Cardi
nals tallied 10 hits and three of
the six homeruns in the extra

inning affair. Stanford jumped
out to a 1-0 lead in the first in
ning of the seesaw contest, but
a solo home run by Bruin
shortstop Mobil Cox tied the
score in the top of the second.
Stanford added another run in
the bottom half of that inning,
but UCLA answered in the top
of the thi rd with three runs on a
two-run homer by catcher
Dennis Delany and a well exe
cuted squeeze play by outfiel
der Dan Causepohl.
Stanford added another run
in the fourth; then with two
men down in the fifth, the
Cards took the lead 5-4 on a
Randy Wong homerun with
Larry Reynolds on first base.
Pitcher Mark Abbondola, in re
lief of Stanford starter Rob Ir
win, ran into some control
problems in the seventh by
walking two UCLA batters and
then giving leftfielder Craig
Johnson too good of a pitch
which Johnson sent out of the
park.
Second baseman Todd Ervin
tied the score at 7-7 in the bot
tom of the seventh with a two
run homerun — the first of his
Stanford career.
Guardino wins it
Leading off the bottom of the
10th, Stanford first baseman
Tom Guardino looked at a
couple of ace reliever Scott
Bollens' pitches and then with
one swing of the bat won the
game for the Cards by pound
ing a homerun 425 feet over the
left field fence.
The first game was similar to
Friday's game, including
another game-winning per
formance by Guardino. Stan
ford collected three runs in the
first inning, but starter Brian
Harrison was missing some

thing out on the mound and
had difficulty finding the plate
in the three innings he pitched.
Control problems
After walking the first three
batters he faced in the top of
the fourth, Harrison was re
lieved by junior Bruce Fiala. He
allowed a sacrifice fly, a walk,
and two solid base hits to right
field as UCLA scored five runs.
The Cards scored once in the
fifth and sixth, but UCLA
scored two in both the sixth
and seventh innings.
After Johnson's two-run
homerun off Fiala in the
seventh, Joe LoPresti took over
on the mound and held UCLA
scoreless for the rest of the
game.
In the bottom of the eighth
the Cards made it 9-7. In the
ninth, John Pyle, who was play
ing in place of leftfielder in
jured Pepe Hinojosa, .led
things off with a single to
center.
Ervin drew a walk and a pas
sed ball advanced both run
ners. Reynolds came through
with a clutch two-bagger to
center to tie the game. Then
with two outs, Guardino sing
led home Reynolds from third.
In the second game, both
starters — Stanford's Larry
Kuhn and UCLA's Tim O'Neill
— went the distance, with the
Bruins taking the 4-2 decision.
Kuhn walked in a run in the
fourth to put the Bruins ahead,
and a sacrifice fly by John Vio
lette added another.
The Bruins extended their
lead to 4-0 with two unearned
runs in the seventh, but Guar
dino continued his hot series at
the plate with a moon shot over
the outer fence in left field in
the bottom of the inning.
But the Cards could only

the ninth. "We had to win,"
said Adams. "If we had lost this
one we'd be three games out of
first place, whereas by winning
we're only one game behind.
