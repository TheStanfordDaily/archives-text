# Condors display ultimate power
## 
### Chris Haft 
The Condors I team from Santa Barbara, winning all nine of its
games, won the 1978 Western National Ultimate Frisbee Tourna
ment held at Stanford this past weekend.
The Condors breezed through Saturday's preliminary round
with a 7-0 record. Yesterday they blitzed Northwind of San Jose in
the semifinals, 24-12, and faced the Foothill Institute of Frisbee
Culture in the finals.
The Condors outlasted determined Foothill in the champion
ship match, 14-11, displaying an unbelievably tight man-to-man
defense and controlling the disk well.
Stanford's ultimate Frisbee team finished Saturday's pre
liminaries with a 3-4 record and failed to advance to Sunday's
playoff round. Stanford's victories came over Colorado, 8-4; New
Mexico, 13-5, and San Diego, 10-3.
The tournament was a manifestation of the growth of ultimate
Frisbee, or just "ultimate," as the players call it."It is a very hot
and contemporary sport," says Tom Mcßann, who organized the
Stanford tourney and is recognized as one of the world's top
Frisbee experts.
Ultimate Frisbee began several years ago at Maplewood High
School in New Jersey. Many of those pioneers went on to college
at Rutgers, and the game spread from there.
One Maplewood student, John Hadley, came to Stanford, and
began popularizing ultimate here along with Mcßann around
1974. They had wanted to make ultimate an intercollegiate sport,
but they couldn't get enough backing.
Because it originated on the East Coast, ultimate is played on a
somewhat more advanced level there. "They've been organized
for three more years, and they've had a structured intercollegiate
program," explained Mcßann.
Mcßann said he knew that ultimate would inevitably grow and
gel. "It is the best team game developed. It is perfect for schools,
because you can get people playing who are inexperienced or
just semiathletic," he said.
According to Mcßann, Stanford has 38 teams signed up for
intramural ultimate Frisbee, up from 18 two years ago. According
to Mcßann, this figure is an intramural record for any school.
On the surface, ultimate is similar to football, basketball and
soccer. The kickoff and the pass patterns of football, the man
to-man and zone defenses of basketball, and the variety of passes
of soccer are all present in ultimate Frisbee.
Growing sport
So why are a growing number of people attracted to ultimate?
John "Dreamer" Weyand, a member of the Foothill team, said
part of the sport's magic lies in the Frisbee itself. "You can throw a
Frisbee farther than any single object, and you can control it
better than any kind of ball. It's a real extension of yourself to be
able to control the disk," he said.
Weyand, who has played tennis, handball, soccer and baseball,
rates ultimate as tops, mainly because it commands total in
volvement from the players. "The major difference in ultimate is
that we judge everything ourselves," he points out.
"We don't have officials or referees out there, so we have to
play honest — none of this underhanded stuff. Our attitude
represents a commitment to the game rather than just winning."
Many sports purists may scoff at ultimate Frisbee and believe it
is just another passing fancy. However, after seeing the en
thusiasm displayed by both players and spectators and consider
ing the merit of Mcßann's and Weyand's words, the conclusion is
that ultimate is legitimately increasing in popularity and could
someday gain a significant place in the American sports scene.

Growing sport
So why are a growing number of people attracted to ultimate?
John "Dreamer" Weyand, a member of the Foothill team, said
part of the sport's magic lies in the Frisbee itself. "You can throw a
Frisbee farther than any single object, and you can control it
better than any kind of ball. It's a real extension of yourself to be
able to control the disk," he said.
Weyand, who has played tennis, handball, soccer and baseball,
rates ultimate as tops, mainly because it commands total in
volvement from the players. "The major difference in ultimate is
that we judge everything ourselves," he points out.
"We don't have officials or referees out there, so we have to
play honest — none of this underhanded stuff. Our attitude
represents a commitment to the game rather than just winning."
Many sports purists may scoff at ultimate Frisbee and believe it
is just another passing fancy. However, after seeing the en
thusiasm displayed by both players and spectators and consider
ing the merit of Mcßann's and Weyand's words, the conclusion is
that ultimate is legitimately increasing in popularity and could
someday gain a significant place in the American sports scene.

Frisbee Tournament.
The Condors I team from Santa Barbara, winning all nine of its
games, won the 1978 Western National Ultimate Frisbee Tourna
ment held at Stanford this past weekend.
The Condors breezed through Saturday's preliminary round
with a 7-0 record. Yesterday they blitzed Northwind of San Jose in
the semifinals, 24-12, and faced the Foothill Institute of Frisbee
Culture in the finals.
The Condors outlasted determined Foothill in the champion
ship match, 14-11, displaying an unbelievably tight man-to-man
defense and controlling the disk well.
Stanford's ultimate Frisbee team finished Saturday's pre
liminaries with a 3-4 record and failed to advance to Sunday's
playoff round. Stanford's victories came over Colorado, 8-4; New
Mexico, 13-5, and San Diego, 10-3.
The tournament was a manifestation of the growth of ultimate
Frisbee, or just "ultimate," as the players call it."It is a very hot
and contemporary sport," says Tom Mcßann, who organized the
Stanford tourney and is recognized as one of the world's top
Frisbee experts.
Ultimate Frisbee began several years ago at Maplewood High
School in New Jersey. Many of those pioneers went on to college
at Rutgers, and the game spread from there.
One Maplewood student, John Hadley, came to Stanford, and
began popularizing ultimate here along with Mcßann around
1974. They had wanted to make ultimate an intercollegiate sport,
but they couldn't get enough backing.
Because it originated on the East Coast, ultimate is played on a
somewhat more advanced level there. "They've been organized
for three more years, and they've had a structured intercollegiate
program," explained Mcßann.
Mcßann said he knew that ultimate would inevitably grow and
gel. "It is the best team game developed. It is perfect for schools,
because you can get people playing who are inexperienced or
just semiathletic," he said.
According to Mcßann, Stanford has 38 teams signed up for
intramural ultimate Frisbee, up from 18 two years ago. According
to Mcßann, this figure is an intramural record for any school.
On the surface, ultimate is similar to football, basketball and
soccer. The kickoff and the pass patterns of football, the man
to-man and zone defenses of basketball, and the variety of passes
of soccer are all present in ultimate Frisbee.
