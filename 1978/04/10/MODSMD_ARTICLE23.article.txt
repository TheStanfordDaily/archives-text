Los Angeles — "We did
some things differently,"
said Stanford track coach
Peyton Jordan following the
Cards' 87-67 track meet vic
tory over Occidental Col
lege Saturday.
But the Cards' top
trackman James Lofton did
things the way he usually
does — in a winning man
ner. Lofton won three
events — the long jump, the
100-meter dash and the 200
— to pace the Cards.
His jump of 25-feet-8%
began the Cards' sweep of
the event. It was the 33rd
time in his Stanford career
Lofton has leaped over 25
feet. Clay Bullwinkel and
Darrin Nelson took second
and third, respectively.
"We didn't anticipate get
ting a nine-point sweep,"
said Jordan.

Lofton made a rare ap
pearance in the 100, win
ning the sprintinlO.3. Many
of the Cards runners drop
ped down in distance in
order to work on their
speed in preparation for the
UCLA meet this Saturday at
Stanford.
The Cards also swept the
100 as well as the 200. Gor
don Banks took third be
hind Nelson in the 100 and
ran 21.7 in the 200 for sec
ond.
In theBoo, Tom Lobsinger
nosed out two Oxy runners
for the win in 1:52.8. "That
was a real gutsy etfort by
Lobsinger," said Jordan.
