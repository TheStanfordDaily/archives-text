Stanford junior Chris
Takimoto placed 11th in the
pommel horse competition of
the NCAA championships held
Thursday through Saturday in
Eugene, Ore.
The Cardinal's only rep
resentative had an identical
performance in last year's na
tional meet. The field was nar
rowed to 24 individual finalists,
of which only eight qualified
for Saturday night's final meet.
Takimoto missed the cutoff
mark by .15.
"I'm a little disappointed
that I didn't make it into final
night competition, but I can't
really be that upset because I
feel I did a pretty good routine.
I did just about the best com
pulsory that I could have ex
pected to do," Takimoto said.
The biggest difference bet
ween the two NCAA meets
Takimoto has been in was the
level of competition.
"Compared to last year, the
quality was a lot higher. There
were a lot more really good
pommel horse men. People
were a lot more consistent,"
said Takimoto.
"The scores I had this year
would have been like third
place going into the finals of
last year's competitions. Sud
denly there seems to be a lot

more people working a lot
harder," he added.
While Takimoto scored 9.5 in
the optional competition, it
was the compulsory routine,
where he scored a 9.35, that
hurt him.
"I still didn't do very well in
the compulsory — that's
primarily where I lost my
points. I was just a few tenths
below where everybody else
was. If I had it to do all over
again, I would work a lot har

der on my compulsory sets,"
Takimoto said.
"The whole season has been
a really rewarding one. As a
team, we didn't do all that well
in the Pac-8, but we improved.
It was our best season since
I've been here. I think Stan
ford's team has an optimistic
outlook. The recruiting this
past year has been excellent —
Sadao (Hamada) seems to be
getting in some very good
gymnasts," he said.
