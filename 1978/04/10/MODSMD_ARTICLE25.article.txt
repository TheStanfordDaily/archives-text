### Andy Lowe 
Showing incredible dominance in the middle
distance and distance freestyle events, the Stan
ford women's team stroked to a third place
finish in the AIAW Swimming and Diving
Championships, two notches ahead of pre
season predictions. Arizona State University, as
expected, won the team title, and a strong Uni
versity of Florida team took runner-up honors.
The Cards were led by three-event defending
titlist Valerie Lee and Olympian Kim Peyton. Lee
was Stanford's only event winner, as she outdis
tanced teammates Jo Clark and Anne Brodell in
the 1650 yard freestyle, breaking her own AIAW
record with a 16:22.21. Lee alsocaptured second
places in the 500 freestyle and 200 butterfly, es
tablishing new Stanford records in both (4:47.85
and 2:00.90, respectively), and finished third in
the 200 freestyle and ninth in the 100 butterfly.
Peyton was twice touched out for first by

ASU's Cail Amundrud, in the 100 and 200 frees
tyle. The versatile sophomore also made the
finals in the 50 and 500 freestyle, as she placed
third in the 500 and seventh in the 50.
Providing support for Lee and Peyton in the
freestyle events were senior Anne Brodell,
junior Jo Clark, and freshman Laura Raymond.
"Anne, Jo and Laura really came through for
us," praised coach Jim Caughran. "Anne did her
career best times, which is unusual for a college
senior in swimming. Jo surprised us by dropping
her times by leaps and bounds and Laura swam
super despite being sick for several weeks."
Copping All-America honors for their efforts,
Brodell placed third in the 1650, fifth in the 500
freestyle, and 12th in the 200 freestyle; Clark
took second in the 1650, and seventh in the 500
freestyle; and Raymond finished ninth in the 100
freestyle, fourth in the 200 freestyle, fourth in
the 500 freestyle, and seventh in the 1650.
