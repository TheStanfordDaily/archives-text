our internal affairs . . . and as a consequence of which
we reject the treaty."

the canal, said in a telephone interview that the treaty is
"immoral because the strong once again are trying to
wield excessive power over the weak, and illegal be

march yesterday protesting the "death of freedom and
democracy" here and arrested all 800 demonstrators,
packing them into comandeered buses and hauling
them off to nearby military camps.

contained the "remains of freedom and democracy"
after Friday's interim National Assembly elections, the
first in the Philippines since President Ferdinand Marcos
declared martial law in 1972.

it may represent the first time specific demands have
been laid down for Moro's freedom.
Humphrey not to run for Senate
St. Paul, Minn. — Muriel Humphrey, who stepped
briefly from behind the shadow of her late husband into
the U.S. Senate, says she'll return to the privacy of her

Farmer-Labor Party at a fundraising dinner Saturday
night that she would not run for the four years left in the
Senate term of Hubert Humphrey.
