Stanford's Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) voted unanimously last Monday against U.S. cor
porate expansion in South Africa and in favor of adop
tion of affirmative action policies there. The commission
also voted 8-4 in favor of U.S. corporate withdrawal
there over time, according to a report released Friday by
CIR Chairman Fred Hillier.
These and other recommendations were sent Friday
to the Board of Trustees for their consideration at meet
ings to be held today and tomorrow in San Francisco.
The Stanford Committee for Responsible Investment
Policy (SCRIP) said yesterday its plans on sending 50
student demonstrators to tomorrow's full board meet
ing to demand that the trustees follow the ClR's recom
mendations.
"We are not calling for divestment of Stanford stocks
because that measure would be far less effective in br
inging about change of the unfair and oppressive apar
theid policies in South Afirca," Hillier said.
For and against
The eight members supporting withdrawal were
David Abernethy, professor of political science; Lee
Goldman, student; Frederick Hillier, chairman and pro
fessor of operations research; Ron Johnson, student;
Ryland Kelley, alumnus; Jeffrey Sultan, staff member,
William Todd, 111, professor of humanities; and Mar
garet Willis, staff member.
The four members opposing withdrawal as defined by
the majority were Susan Burrus, student; Larry Horton,
associate dean; Robert Levison, alumnus; and Elizabeth

Stevenson, alumna
Withdrawal calls fora corporation to halt operations in
a given country, while divestment merely implies an
institution's selling its stock in that corporation, Hillier
said.
"The most effective way of bringing about withdrawal
is to remain a shareholder and retain our influence with
the corporation. If we sell our stock, another less mor
ally conscious individual might buy stock at a profit and
that individual might not vote for withdrawal," Hillier
said.
Must meet two conditions
According to the majority statement, withdrawal is not
an "unconditional imperative." A corporation may re
main in South Africa if two of the following three condi
tions are met:
—announced corporate willingness to work openly
for the cancellation of laws which render the political
and economic system racially discriminatory;
—concentration on the production of goods and ser
vices in South At 'ca which would not be readily availa
ble to the government for repressive purposes;
—exceptional corporate progress in recent years in
socially affirmative action in South Africa.
Refrain from loans
The commission also voted to recommend voting in
favor of shareholder resolutions which call upon Ameri
can financial institutions, i.e. banks, to refrain from
lending to any element of South Africa's public sector or
to renew existing loans to the public sector. The com
mission also urged American financial institutions to
refrain from expanding the scope of their loans to the
South African private sector.
Collected viewpoints
The commission has heard several speakers during
their deliberations, some natives of South Africa, both
black and white. The CIR also held a public forum in
which all speakers either urged divestment of stocks in
U.S. corporations in South Africa or total withdrawal.
"We al I agreed that the practices of many corporations
were causing substantial social injury within South Af
rica, but we disagreed as to whether withdrawal was the
most logical step to take," Hillier said.
Of the 12 members of CIR, eight supported with
drawal. The CIR report to the trustees indicates that
those members opposed to withdrawal prefered to look
at individual company cases to determine withdrawal
rather than making general policy recommendations.
Minority position
The minority disagrees with the majority position that
withdrawal would necessarily enable United States
foreign policy to exert more effective pressure on the
South African government.
"On the contrary, the presence in South Africa of U.S.
firms promoting change could give added incentive for
U.S. foreign policy to work more aggressively for im
provements in South Africa," the minority report states.
The minority report further states that voting to abs
tain on a withdrawal resolution is more likely to prompt a

positive response from management than a vote for
withdrawal, which many corporate leaders may dismiss
as premature or ill considered.
Commission members feel a variety of inputs were
influential in making decisions regarding investment
policy.
Withdrawal over time
"For me, the most influential point was my own reali
zation that withdrawal could be phased out over a
period of time. It is not that you're gone overnight. By
phasing out withdrawal, we will be able to lobby with the
South African government for responsible policies to
ward blacks and other minorities.
"I also realized that withdrawal is not inconsistent
with implementing affirmative action policies such as
the Sullivan principles. While the corporations are
there, they can install affirmative action policies," David
Abernethy, professor of political science, said.
The Sullivan Principles call for non-segregation of the
races and equal and fair employment practices for all
employees, among other affirmative action policies.
"For others, the forum and the virtual unanimity for
withdrawal or divestment revealed there were crucial,"
Abernethy said.
"I was careful not to give too much weight to a verbal
statement, either by people at the forum or by other
individuals we heard because of the unreliability. I
tended to rely on documented written evidence," Lee
Goldman, a student member, said.
Before the trustees meet tomorrow, the Subcommit
tee on Investment Policy and the Committee of Invest

merits of the board will be reviewing the recommenda
tions of the CIR. The board will then make its decisions
regarding the guidelines, according to William Massy,
vice president for business and finance.
"From where I sit, the CI R's given good counsel. Their
decision not to recommend divestment is a good one, I
think. Their support of the Sullivan Principles for affir
mative action and the idea to send a letter with each
proxy vote cast explaining Stanford policies is a good
one. Their recommendations for withdrawal and other
proxies will take careful discussion. I'm not willing to
buy all that the CIR has said," Massy said.
SCRIP responds
SCRIP members are pleased with the ClR's recom
mendations as well, according to Stuart Ozer, Stanford
alumnus and SCRIP member.
"Last year's CIR was ignored after we called for action
last spring. We hope this CIR will not be ignored by the
trustees. Broad-based support for withdrawal has been
shown throughout this University," Ozer said.
Hillier said he expects the results to be taken quite
seriously by the trustees before they make their own
independent judgment.
"Assuming they approve all of our recommendations I
think there will be a substantial impact nationwide,"
Hillier said.
"Stanford is a prestigious institution, that would be
taking a strong step by voting against management. We
will have an effect on other institutions. We aren't the
first to call for withdrawal, though, and we won't be the
last," Hillier said.

proxies will take careful discussion. I'm not willing to
buy all that the CIR has said," Massy said.
SCRIP responds
SCRIP members are pleased with the ClR's recom
mendations as well, according to Stuart Ozer, Stanford
alumnus and SCRIP member.
"Last year's CIR was ignored after we called for action
last spring. We hope this CIR will not be ignored by the
trustees. Broad-based support for withdrawal has been
shown throughout this University," Ozer said.
Hillier said he expects the results to be taken quite
seriously by the trustees before they make their own
independent judgment.
"Assuming they approve all of our recommendations I
think there will be a substantial impact nationwide,"
Hillier said.
"Stanford is a prestigious institution, that would be
taking a strong step by voting against management. We
will have an effect on other institutions. We aren't the
first to call for withdrawal, though, and we won't be the
last," Hillier said.
Stanford's Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) voted unanimously last Monday against U.S. cor
porate expansion in South Africa and in favor of adop
tion of affirmative action policies there. The commission
also voted 8-4 in favor of U.S. corporate withdrawal
there over time, according to a report released Friday by
CIR Chairman Fred Hillier.
These and other recommendations were sent Friday
to the Board of Trustees for their consideration at meet
ings to be held today and tomorrow in San Francisco.
The Stanford Committee for Responsible Investment
Policy (SCRIP) said yesterday its plans on sending 50
student demonstrators to tomorrow's full board meet
ing to demand that the trustees follow the ClR's recom
mendations.
"We are not calling for divestment of Stanford stocks
because that measure would be far less effective in br
inging about change of the unfair and oppressive apar
theid policies in South Afirca," Hillier said.
For and against
The eight members supporting withdrawal were
David Abernethy, professor of political science; Lee
Goldman, student; Frederick Hillier, chairman and pro
fessor of operations research; Ron Johnson, student;
Ryland Kelley, alumnus; Jeffrey Sultan, staff member,
William Todd, 111, professor of humanities; and Mar
garet Willis, staff member.
The four members opposing withdrawal as defined by
the majority were Susan Burrus, student; Larry Horton,
associate dean; Robert Levison, alumnus; and Elizabeth

Stevenson, alumna
Withdrawal calls fora corporation to halt operations in
a given country, while divestment merely implies an
institution's selling its stock in that corporation, Hillier
said.
"The most effective way of bringing about withdrawal
is to remain a shareholder and retain our influence with
the corporation. If we sell our stock, another less mor
ally conscious individual might buy stock at a profit and
that individual might not vote for withdrawal," Hillier
said.
Must meet two conditions
According to the majority statement, withdrawal is not
an "unconditional imperative." A corporation may re
main in South Africa if two of the following three condi
tions are met:
—announced corporate willingness to work openly
for the cancellation of laws which render the political
and economic system racially discriminatory;
—concentration on the production of goods and ser
vices in South At 'ca which would not be readily availa
ble to the government for repressive purposes;
—exceptional corporate progress in recent years in
socially affirmative action in South Africa.
Refrain from loans
The commission also voted to recommend voting in
favor of shareholder resolutions which call upon Ameri
can financial institutions, i.e. banks, to refrain from
lending to any element of South Africa's public sector or
to renew existing loans to the public sector. The com
mission also urged American financial institutions to
refrain from expanding the scope of their loans to the
South African private sector.
Collected viewpoints
The commission has heard several speakers during
their deliberations, some natives of South Africa, both
black and white. The CIR also held a public forum in
which all speakers either urged divestment of stocks in
U.S. corporations in South Africa or total withdrawal.
"We al I agreed that the practices of many corporations
were causing substantial social injury within South Af
rica, but we disagreed as to whether withdrawal was the
most logical step to take," Hillier said.
Of the 12 members of CIR, eight supported with
drawal. The CIR report to the trustees indicates that
those members opposed to withdrawal prefered to look
at individual company cases to determine withdrawal
rather than making general policy recommendations.
Minority position
The minority disagrees with the majority position that
withdrawal would necessarily enable United States
foreign policy to exert more effective pressure on the
South African government.
"On the contrary, the presence in South Africa of U.S.
firms promoting change could give added incentive for
U.S. foreign policy to work more aggressively for im
provements in South Africa," the minority report states.
The minority report further states that voting to abs
tain on a withdrawal resolution is more likely to prompt a

positive response from management than a vote for
withdrawal, which many corporate leaders may dismiss
as premature or ill considered.
Commission members feel a variety of inputs were
influential in making decisions regarding investment
policy.
Withdrawal over time
"For me, the most influential point was my own reali
zation that withdrawal could be phased out over a
period of time. It is not that you're gone overnight. By
phasing out withdrawal, we will be able to lobby with the
South African government for responsible policies to
ward blacks and other minorities.
"I also realized that withdrawal is not inconsistent
with implementing affirmative action policies such as
the Sullivan principles. While the corporations are
there, they can install affirmative action policies," David
Abernethy, professor of political science, said.
The Sullivan Principles call for non-segregation of the
races and equal and fair employment practices for all
employees, among other affirmative action policies.
"For others, the forum and the virtual unanimity for
withdrawal or divestment revealed there were crucial,"
Abernethy said.
"I was careful not to give too much weight to a verbal
statement, either by people at the forum or by other
individuals we heard because of the unreliability. I
tended to rely on documented written evidence," Lee
Goldman, a student member, said.
Before the trustees meet tomorrow, the Subcommit
tee on Investment Policy and the Committee of Invest

merits of the board will be reviewing the recommenda
tions of the CIR. The board will then make its decisions
regarding the guidelines, according to William Massy,
vice president for business and finance.
"From where I sit, the CI R's given good counsel. Their
decision not to recommend divestment is a good one, I
think. Their support of the Sullivan Principles for affir
mative action and the idea to send a letter with each
proxy vote cast explaining Stanford policies is a good
one. Their recommendations for withdrawal and other
proxies will take careful discussion. I'm not willing to
buy all that the CIR has said," Massy said.

"For others, the forum and the virtual unanimity for
withdrawal or divestment revealed there were crucial,"
Abernethy said.
"I was careful not to give too much weight to a verbal
statement, either by people at the forum or by other
individuals we heard because of the unreliability. I
tended to rely on documented written evidence," Lee
Goldman, a student member, said.
Before the trustees meet tomorrow, the Subcommit
tee on Investment Policy and the Committee of Invest

merits of the board will be reviewing the recommenda
tions of the CIR. The board will then make its decisions
regarding the guidelines, according to William Massy,
vice president for business and finance.
"From where I sit, the CI R's given good counsel. Their
decision not to recommend divestment is a good one, I
think. Their support of the Sullivan Principles for affir
mative action and the idea to send a letter with each
proxy vote cast explaining Stanford policies is a good
one. Their recommendations for withdrawal and other
proxies will take careful discussion. I'm not willing to
buy all that the CIR has said," Massy said.
SCRIP responds
SCRIP members are pleased with the ClR's recom
mendations as well, according to Stuart Ozer, Stanford
alumnus and SCRIP member.
"Last year's CIR was ignored after we called for action
last spring. We hope this CIR will not be ignored by the
trustees. Broad-based support for withdrawal has been
shown throughout this University," Ozer said.
Hillier said he expects the results to be taken quite
seriously by the trustees before they make their own
independent judgment.
"Assuming they approve all of our recommendations I
think there will be a substantial impact nationwide,"
Hillier said.
"Stanford is a prestigious institution, that would be
taking a strong step by voting against management. We
will have an effect on other institutions. We aren't the
first to call for withdrawal, though, and we won't be the
last," Hillier said.
Stanford's Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) voted unanimously last Monday against U.S. cor
porate expansion in South Africa and in favor of adop
tion of affirmative action policies there. The commission
also voted 8-4 in favor of U.S. corporate withdrawal
there over time, according to a report released Friday by
CIR Chairman Fred Hillier.
These and other recommendations were sent Friday
to the Board of Trustees for their consideration at meet
ings to be held today and tomorrow in San Francisco.
The Stanford Committee for Responsible Investment
Policy (SCRIP) said yesterday its plans on sending 50
student demonstrators to tomorrow's full board meet
ing to demand that the trustees follow the ClR's recom
mendations.
"We are not calling for divestment of Stanford stocks
because that measure would be far less effective in br
inging about change of the unfair and oppressive apar
theid policies in South Afirca," Hillier said.
For and against
The eight members supporting withdrawal were
David Abernethy, professor of political science; Lee
Goldman, student; Frederick Hillier, chairman and pro
fessor of operations research; Ron Johnson, student;
Ryland Kelley, alumnus; Jeffrey Sultan, staff member,
William Todd, 111, professor of humanities; and Mar
garet Willis, staff member.
The four members opposing withdrawal as defined by
the majority were Susan Burrus, student; Larry Horton,
associate dean; Robert Levison, alumnus; and Elizabeth

Stevenson, alumna
Withdrawal calls fora corporation to halt operations in
a given country, while divestment merely implies an
institution's selling its stock in that corporation, Hillier
said.
"The most effective way of bringing about withdrawal
is to remain a shareholder and retain our influence with
the corporation. If we sell our stock, another less mor
ally conscious individual might buy stock at a profit and
that individual might not vote for withdrawal," Hillier
said.
Must meet two conditions
According to the majority statement, withdrawal is not
an "unconditional imperative." A corporation may re
main in South Africa if two of the following three condi
tions are met:
—announced corporate willingness to work openly
for the cancellation of laws which render the political
and economic system racially discriminatory;
—concentration on the production of goods and ser
vices in South At 'ca which would not be readily availa
ble to the government for repressive purposes;
—exceptional corporate progress in recent years in
socially affirmative action in South Africa.
Refrain from loans
The commission also voted to recommend voting in
favor of shareholder resolutions which call upon Ameri
can financial institutions, i.e. banks, to refrain from
lending to any element of South Africa's public sector or
to renew existing loans to the public sector. The com
mission also urged American financial institutions to
refrain from expanding the scope of their loans to the
South African private sector.
Collected viewpoints
The commission has heard several speakers during
their deliberations, some natives of South Africa, both
black and white. The CIR also held a public forum in
which all speakers either urged divestment of stocks in
U.S. corporations in South Africa or total withdrawal.
"We al I agreed that the practices of many corporations
were causing substantial social injury within South Af
rica, but we disagreed as to whether withdrawal was the
most logical step to take," Hillier said.
Of the 12 members of CIR, eight supported with
drawal. The CIR report to the trustees indicates that
those members opposed to withdrawal prefered to look
at individual company cases to determine withdrawal
rather than making general policy recommendations.
Minority position
The minority disagrees with the majority position that
withdrawal would necessarily enable United States
foreign policy to exert more effective pressure on the
South African government.
"On the contrary, the presence in South Africa of U.S.
firms promoting change could give added incentive for
U.S. foreign policy to work more aggressively for im
provements in South Africa," the minority report states.
The minority report further states that voting to abs
tain on a withdrawal resolution is more likely to prompt a

positive response from management than a vote for
withdrawal, which many corporate leaders may dismiss
as premature or ill considered.
Commission members feel a variety of inputs were
influential in making decisions regarding investment
policy.
Withdrawal over time
"For me, the most influential point was my own reali
zation that withdrawal could be phased out over a
period of time. It is not that you're gone overnight. By
phasing out withdrawal, we will be able to lobby with the
South African government for responsible policies to
ward blacks and other minorities.
"I also realized that withdrawal is not inconsistent
with implementing affirmative action policies such as
the Sullivan principles. While the corporations are
there, they can install affirmative action policies," David
Abernethy, professor of political science, said.
The Sullivan Principles call for non-segregation of the
races and equal and fair employment practices for all
employees, among other affirmative action policies.
"For others, the forum and the virtual unanimity for
withdrawal or divestment revealed there were crucial,"
Abernethy said.
"I was careful not to give too much weight to a verbal
statement, either by people at the forum or by other
individuals we heard because of the unreliability. I
tended to rely on documented written evidence," Lee
Goldman, a student member, said.
