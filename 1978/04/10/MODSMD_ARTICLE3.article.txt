Stanford's Commission on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) voted unanimously last Monday against U.S. cor
porate expansion in South Africa and in favor of adop
tion of affirmative action policies there. The commission
also voted 8-4 in favor of U.S. corporate withdrawal
there over time, according to a report released Friday by
CIR Chairman Fred Hillier.
These and other recommendations were sent Friday
to the Board of Trustees for their consideration at meet
ings to be held today and tomorrow in San Francisco.
The Stanford Committee for Responsible Investment
Policy (SCRIP) said yesterday its plans on sending 50
student demonstrators to tomorrow's full board meet
ing to demand that the trustees follow the ClR's recom
mendations.
"We are not calling for divestment of Stanford stocks
because that measure would be far less effective in br
inging about change of the unfair and oppressive apar
theid policies in South Afirca," Hillier said.
For and against
The eight members supporting withdrawal were
David Abernethy, professor of political science; Lee
Goldman, student; Frederick Hillier, chairman and pro
fessor of operations research; Ron Johnson, student;
Ryland Kelley, alumnus; Jeffrey Sultan, staff member,
William Todd, 111, professor of humanities; and Mar
garet Willis, staff member.
The four members opposing withdrawal as defined by
the majority were Susan Burrus, student; Larry Horton,
associate dean; Robert Levison, alumnus; and Elizabeth

Stevenson, alumna
Withdrawal calls fora corporation to halt operations in
a given country, while divestment merely implies an
institution's selling its stock in that corporation, Hillier
said.
"The most effective way of bringing about withdrawal
is to remain a shareholder and retain our influence with
the corporation. If we sell our stock, another less mor
ally conscious individual might buy stock at a profit and
that individual might not vote for withdrawal," Hillier
said.
Must meet two conditions
According to the majority statement, withdrawal is not
an "unconditional imperative." A corporation may re
main in South Africa if two of the following three condi
tions are met:
—announced corporate willingness to work openly
for the cancellation of laws which render the political
and economic system racially discriminatory;
—concentration on the production of goods and ser
vices in South At 'ca which would not be readily availa
ble to the government for repressive purposes;
—exceptional corporate progress in recent years in
socially affirmative action in South Africa.
Refrain from loans
The commission also voted to recommend voting in
favor of shareholder resolutions which call upon Ameri
can financial institutions, i.e. banks, to refrain from
lending to any element of South Africa's public sector or
to renew existing loans to the public sector. The com
