# Professors discuss minority conditions

Minority university administrators
are appointed "merely to placate
people (rather) than to take serious
action," U.C.-San Diego Prof. Joseph
Watson said here Saturday.
Participating in the Martin Luther
King, Jr. Commemorative Work
shop, Watson said minority ap
pointments are only a university's
reaction to external pressures. They
also provide a "means of directing
minority concerns away from the
central core of the university" by
placing them in offices such as the
dean of student affairs.
Prof. J. Herman Blake of U.C.-
Santa Cruz, another speaker at the
workshop, said, "If you are con
cerned about enrolling minority stu
dents in the university, you do not
modify the admissions office. You
add an ad hoc office. You put it in the
meakest place, or a less prestigious
place in the university, the student
affairs office."
These methods are an ineffective
means to an end from a minority
perspective, Blake said.
"The only way we can make a dif
ference is if we can say who gets
hired or who does not. If you do not

have that power, then your ability to
make effective decisions is severely
limited," he said.
Blake and Watson are provosts in
the U.C. system.
There are a "number of miscon
ceptions associated with being a
black administrator," said Watson. It
is assumed that a black's top priority
is to public service and not his or her
career. Also, in the position a black
holds, he may not have the capacity
to deal with all black issues, he said.
Most importantly, the belief by
blacks that if there isn't a black in a
position of power, then they have no
basis for claim is false, Watson said.
"It is a step backwards from the
'605," he said. "It was assumed that
the university had obligations, too.
Now, many (blacks) feel they cannot
exercise influence through the regu
lar channels.
"We could achieve the goal of
meeting black needs without black
administrators, but not very easily,"
Watson said.
The two-day workshop, sponsored
by the African and Afro-American
Studies program and the Center for
Teaching and Learning, featured 12
scholars from across the country.
