# Weicker demonstrates humanitarian concerns
## 
### Jonathan Slater News analysis 
"We all have to be very careful that
when we define the strength of the
U.S. that we don't leave out the
American citizen. If you don't have a
roof over your hear, you're not going
to be motivated to defend the United
States of America."
So commented Sen. Lowell
Weicker (R-Conn.) in an interview
with the Daily and KZSU last Thurs
day. Weicker was on campus to par
ticipate in an energy forum spon
sored by the Stanford Committee on
Political Education (SCOPE).
It is statements such as this one,
demonstrating a fundamental
humanitarian concern by the
senator, which seems to dominate
his policy decisions.
Weicker is termed a moderate Re
publican, one who is willing to reject
partisan politics when he feels it's
necessary.
On social issues, his views are
rather liberal — especially for a Re
publican. He supports full employ
ment legislation, extensive public
housing programs and improved
mass transportation.
To fund these programs Weicker
suggests cutbacks in military spend
ing.
Favors canal treaty
On foreign policy, he favors both
the Panama Canal Treaty and Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's new approach
which Weicker feels beging "to deal
with our neighbors as equals," and
represents "a great reversal in
foreign policy by a major power."
He proposes mandatory Tuel con
servation laws to help solve the na
tion's energy problem.
And yet Weicker also has his con
servative streak, probably influenced
by having been raised and lived in
Creenwick, Conn., a traditional
conservative-Republican stronghold.
Weicker is particularly adamant in
his support of the free enterprise sys

tem, the role of big business and
traditional economic policies.
He is a strong proponent of gov
ernmental deregulation in the busi
ness arena. "Get government off the
backs of private industry; stop reg
ulating them to death. That's what
they're doing right now," urged the
senator.
Weicker said, "I have great faith in
the free enterprise system. I think
the free enterprise system left alone
can help itself, if government will
stop badgering it to death."
Competition important
The ranking Republican on the Se
nate Small Business Committee,
Weicker stressed the importance of
small businesses competing to keep
prices down and quality high. "I
think we always want to make certain
that competition is alive in this coun
try," Weicker added.
He said that "the business of capi

tal formation," which allows new
businesses to open and others to ex
pand, "is a very serious problem in
this country."
Big Business 'alright'
But Weicker did not express any
worries about big business, and its
role in the economy. "My fears are
not so much for big business. I think
big business and big labor do alright
for themselves," commented
Weicker. He did remark, however,
that he thought there has been "too
great a concentration of economic
power in some areas."
It is on this subject, the role of bus
iness and the functioning of the
economy, that Weicker appears
most conservative.
With the presidential elections just
two years away, and the Republican
nomination virtually up for grabs,
Weicker must not come across as too

liberal in a field of conservatives, to
have any chance to represent his
party.
Tired of Republican losses
Weicker has considered the presi
dency and the prospects of his own
candidacy. "We've thought about it.
I'm getting a little tired sitting on the
Republican bench, if you will, with
many of my colleagues and seeing us
lose election after election," said
Weicker.
He added, "I think it's time we
brought our case to the rank and file.
You're not going to do it within the
Republican leadership itself; that's
just too darn conservative and it only
favors the conservative element."
Weicker did not commit himself
personally, however, to challenging
the conservative element for the
nomination. He said that the chal
lenge could come from himself or
any one of four or five Republicans.

Yet when asked if he felt a growing
conservative trend in this country,
Weicker became defensive. He in
cluded himself and many of his
policies in the conservative realm.
His last remark seemed to encap
sulate his whole political philosophy,
while at the same time pointing out
that he is no more drastic than any
one else:
"There has always been conserva
tive thought and indeed some of it is
very healthy — indeed that portion
which says that the government can't
do everything for all of us and ought
to get off our backs."
It became clearer that with the
primary elections approaching
Weicker did not want to be consi
dered a liberal among conservatives,
but a moderate among Republicans.
Perhaps that's just a semantic ges
ture, but in politics words are just
about everything.

pand, "is a very serious problem in
this country."
Big Business 'alright'
But Weicker did not express any
worries about big business, and its
role in the economy. "My fears are
not so much for big business. I think
big business and big labor do alright
for themselves," commented
Weicker. He did remark, however,
that he thought there has been "too
great a concentration of economic
power in some areas."
It is on this subject, the role of bus
iness and the functioning of the
economy, that Weicker appears
most conservative.
With the presidential elections just
two years away, and the Republican
nomination virtually up for grabs,
Weicker must not come across as too

liberal in a field of conservatives, to
have any chance to represent his
party.
Tired of Republican losses
Weicker has considered the presi
dency and the prospects of his own
candidacy. "We've thought about it.
I'm getting a little tired sitting on the
Republican bench, if you will, with
many of my colleagues and seeing us
lose election after election," said
Weicker.
He added, "I think it's time we
brought our case to the rank and file.
You're not going to do it within the
Republican leadership itself; that's
just too darn conservative and it only
favors the conservative element."
Weicker did not commit himself
personally, however, to challenging
the conservative element for the
nomination. He said that the chal
lenge could come from himself or
any one of four or five Republicans.

Yet when asked if he felt a growing
conservative trend in this country,
Weicker became defensive. He in
cluded himself and many of his
policies in the conservative realm.
His last remark seemed to encap
sulate his whole political philosophy,
while at the same time pointing out
that he is no more drastic than any
one else:
"There has always been conserva
tive thought and indeed some of it is
very healthy — indeed that portion
which says that the government can't
do everything for all of us and ought
to get off our backs."
It became clearer that with the
primary elections approaching
Weicker did not want to be consi
dered a liberal among conservatives,
but a moderate among Republicans.
Perhaps that's just a semantic ges
ture, but in politics words are just
about everything.
"We all have to be very careful that
when we define the strength of the
U.S. that we don't leave out the
American citizen. If you don't have a
roof over your hear, you're not going
to be motivated to defend the United
States of America."
So commented Sen. Lowell
Weicker (R-Conn.) in an interview
with the Daily and KZSU last Thurs
day. Weicker was on campus to par
ticipate in an energy forum spon
sored by the Stanford Committee on
Political Education (SCOPE).
It is statements such as this one,
demonstrating a fundamental
humanitarian concern by the
senator, which seems to dominate
his policy decisions.
Weicker is termed a moderate Re
publican, one who is willing to reject
partisan politics when he feels it's
necessary.
On social issues, his views are
rather liberal — especially for a Re
publican. He supports full employ
ment legislation, extensive public
housing programs and improved
mass transportation.
To fund these programs Weicker
suggests cutbacks in military spend
ing.
Favors canal treaty
On foreign policy, he favors both
the Panama Canal Treaty and Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's new approach
which Weicker feels beging "to deal
with our neighbors as equals," and
represents "a great reversal in
foreign policy by a major power."
He proposes mandatory Tuel con
servation laws to help solve the na
tion's energy problem.
And yet Weicker also has his con
servative streak, probably influenced
by having been raised and lived in
Creenwick, Conn., a traditional
conservative-Republican stronghold.
Weicker is particularly adamant in
his support of the free enterprise sys

tem, the role of big business and
traditional economic policies.
He is a strong proponent of gov
ernmental deregulation in the busi
ness arena. "Get government off the
backs of private industry; stop reg
ulating them to death. That's what
they're doing right now," urged the
senator.
Weicker said, "I have great faith in
the free enterprise system. I think
the free enterprise system left alone
can help itself, if government will
stop badgering it to death."
Competition important
The ranking Republican on the Se
nate Small Business Committee,
Weicker stressed the importance of
small businesses competing to keep
prices down and quality high. "I
think we always want to make certain
that competition is alive in this coun
try," Weicker added.
He said that "the business of capi

tal formation," which allows new
businesses to open and others to ex
pand, "is a very serious problem in
this country."
