# Lyman supports' piecemeal' education

"There is little appetite here for another attempt
at a thoroughgoing review of undergraduate edu
cation," President Richard Lyman said Friday at the
spring Academic Council meeting.
"The comparative recentness of the Study of
Education at Stanford, conducted during the last
decade, no doubt has something to do with this,"
said Lyman.
"Given the general reluctance of contemporary
academics to assert the traditional kind of
magesterial judgements about what constitutes an
educated human being, it may be that for many of
us a piecemeal approach is inheremntly more at
tractive," he said.
At present, attention is focused on the "final
report" of the task force on a Western Culture
Requirement, issued March 8, to be taken up in
the Faculty Senate later this quarter, Lyman said.
Neatness lacking
"If we were approaching this whole subject de
novo, with a clean slate, I would have considerable

difficulty in deciding whether our piecemeal ap
proach was the right one. Our proceedings do lack
a certain neatness; but so does the world we live
in, and so does higher education's portion of that
world just at the moment," Lyman said.
"We are still at a fairly early stage in (the) de
velopment (of a Western Culture Requirement)."
If the task force's recommendations meet with
approval in the senate, "the hard work of actually
recruiting faculty and devising the experimental
courses can start in earnest," Lyman said.
"At that point, it will be incumbent on those of
us who have pursued this objective for several
years now to rally to support the effort. A period of
energetic but relatively pragmatic effort to im
prove our performance in helping high school
graduates to become educated people seems very
far from a bad idea," he said.
Improved cultural pattern
"A university of our size and complexity will
never achieve the same sense of intellectual com
munity of the best liberal arts colleges. But an

improved cultural platform from which our stu
dents could launch themselves into their inevita
ble specialties and preprofessional careers would
be no small gain over present conditions," Lyman
said.
"The debates that are already underway in many
institutions across the country are bound to be
influenced by the approach that Harvard appears
to be taking," he said.
The Rosovsky Report, now being discussed by
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard, sets
forth a model of undergraduate education consist
ing ofthree basic parts: a field of concentration, or
major, a core curriculum and electives. The core
curriculum is to encompass five broad areas and
occupy approximately a full year of study.
"We should not be complacent about our own
capacity to adapt to new needs. But adapt we
must, if the Stanford of the 1980s is to provide true
excellence in undergraduate education, and not
just a credentialling system with more prestige
than it will deserve," Lyman concluded.
