# Case — seven dirty words
## Law students argue cases in 'moot court' 
### Mike Charlson 
The question before the court was complex
— should a radio station be allowed to broad
cast indecent language during hours when
children are likely to be exposed to it?
The judges were distinguished — legal scho
lars from the U.S. Court of Appeals and the
Supreme Court of Oregon.
And the advocates were poised, ready for
intense badgering from the justices empaneled
to hear the case.
But after two hours of oral arguments, which
culminated months of brief preparation and ar
gument organization, the justices returned no
decision in the case Federal Communications
Commission v. Atlantica Foundation.
Although the justices did not hand down a
ruling on the merits of the case, they did
choose Mary Alice McKeen, a third-year law
student here, as winner of the "best advocate"
and "best written brief" awards in the 26th An
nual Marion Rice Kirkwood Competition held
Friday at the Law School.
Argue issues
Better known as "moot court,"the competi
tion "offers participants an opportunity to brief
and argue legal issues of current interest and
significance."

The case before the court involved the
broadcasting of "dirty words" during the after
noon on radio station KSJD, owned and oper
ated by the Atlantica Foundation. The radio sta
tion had broadcast a selection from a record
album entitled "Carl Georgian; Occupation:
IDIOT," which contained frequent use of sev
eral words admittedly offensive to many indi
viduals.
The case is based on an actual case now be
fore the Supreme Court in which a radio station
owned by Pacifica Foundation played similarly
offensive language from a track off a George
Carlin record.
Strangely the Court of Appeals ruling in At
lantica is the same as the actual Court of Appe
als finding in Pacifica. The appellate court over
turned a Federal Communications Commission
order which would effectively "channel" such
broadcasts to later hours of the evening, thus
lowering the likelihood that young children
would be exposed to the indecency.
Prohibits FCC
The Court of Appeals held that such a ruling
violated section 326 of the Federal Communica
tions Act which prohibits the FCC from censor
ing programming material on licensee broad
casts.
According to John Emanuel, Moot Court

Board president, the competition began with
about 50 persons writing briefs in the case.
Through a series of preliminary rounds judged
by lawyers and judges from the Bay Area, the
number of competitors was narrowed to four.
The four submitted their briefs to the three
justice panel which simulated the Supreme
Court during oral arguments.
Included in the panel were J. Skelly Wright
from the District of Columbia Circuit of the U .S.
Court of Appeals; Hans Linde from the Oregon
Supreme Court; and Ben Duniway from the
Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals.
Amateur banisters
Amateur banisters included McKenn, David
Fairweather, who was named runner-up in the
competition, Paul Fryd and Mark Medearis.
According to Emanuel, cash awards totaling
$300 plus approximately 12 text and case books
donated by legal text publishers were awarded
to the participants.
The court heard two sets of oral arguments,
the first including Medearis and Fryd and the
second featuring McKeen and Fairweather.
Wright called the hearings "a superb perfor
mance" in his announcement of the winners.
The competition, he said, "is a testament to the
legal education available at Stanford."

viduals.
The case is based on an actual case now be
fore the Supreme Court in which a radio station
owned by Pacifica Foundation played similarly
offensive language from a track off a George
Carlin record.
Strangely the Court of Appeals ruling in At
lantica is the same as the actual Court of Appe
als finding in Pacifica. The appellate court over
turned a Federal Communications Commission
order which would effectively "channel" such
broadcasts to later hours of the evening, thus
lowering the likelihood that young children
would be exposed to the indecency.
Prohibits FCC
The Court of Appeals held that such a ruling
violated section 326 of the Federal Communica
tions Act which prohibits the FCC from censor
ing programming material on licensee broad
casts.
According to John Emanuel, Moot Court

Board president, the competition began with
about 50 persons writing briefs in the case.
Through a series of preliminary rounds judged
by lawyers and judges from the Bay Area, the
number of competitors was narrowed to four.
The four submitted their briefs to the three
justice panel which simulated the Supreme
Court during oral arguments.
Included in the panel were J. Skelly Wright
from the District of Columbia Circuit of the U .S.
Court of Appeals; Hans Linde from the Oregon
Supreme Court; and Ben Duniway from the
Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals.
Amateur banisters
Amateur banisters included McKenn, David
Fairweather, who was named runner-up in the
competition, Paul Fryd and Mark Medearis.
According to Emanuel, cash awards totaling
$300 plus approximately 12 text and case books
donated by legal text publishers were awarded
to the participants.
The court heard two sets of oral arguments,
the first including Medearis and Fryd and the
second featuring McKeen and Fairweather.
Wright called the hearings "a superb perfor
mance" in his announcement of the winners.
The competition, he said, "is a testament to the
legal education available at Stanford."

The question before the court was complex
— should a radio station be allowed to broad
cast indecent language during hours when
children are likely to be exposed to it?
The judges were distinguished — legal scho
lars from the U.S. Court of Appeals and the
Supreme Court of Oregon.
And the advocates were poised, ready for
intense badgering from the justices empaneled
to hear the case.
But after two hours of oral arguments, which
culminated months of brief preparation and ar
gument organization, the justices returned no
decision in the case Federal Communications
Commission v. Atlantica Foundation.
Although the justices did not hand down a
ruling on the merits of the case, they did
choose Mary Alice McKeen, a third-year law
student here, as winner of the "best advocate"
and "best written brief" awards in the 26th An
nual Marion Rice Kirkwood Competition held
Friday at the Law School.
Argue issues
Better known as "moot court,"the competi
tion "offers participants an opportunity to brief
and argue legal issues of current interest and
significance."

The case before the court involved the
broadcasting of "dirty words" during the after
noon on radio station KSJD, owned and oper
ated by the Atlantica Foundation. The radio sta
tion had broadcast a selection from a record
album entitled "Carl Georgian; Occupation:
IDIOT," which contained frequent use of sev
eral words admittedly offensive to many indi
viduals.
The case is based on an actual case now be
fore the Supreme Court in which a radio station
owned by Pacifica Foundation played similarly
offensive language from a track off a George
Carlin record.
Strangely the Court of Appeals ruling in At
