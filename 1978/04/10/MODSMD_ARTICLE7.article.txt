## Editorials CIR, SOC actions viewed 
### 
Withdraw from South Africa
The new Commission on Investment Responsi
bility has just forwarded its recommendations on
South African investment to the Board of Trustees.
The ClR's members should be commended for the
long hours they have put into the commission and
for the well-thought out and detailed report which
they have written.
The CIR has unanimously called for the en
dorsement of the Sullivan principles on affirmative
action in South Africa, and has called for the with
drawal of American corporations which fail to
meet certain conditions by an 8 to 4 vote.
We agree with all of the ClR's recommenda
tions, and we believe the time has come for the
trustees to begin to work toward the withdrawal of
corporations from South Africa under the
guidelines of the CIR. The trustees must begin by
voting "yes" on proxies advocating withdrawal; no
longer can the University play the game of abstain
ing on proxies and at the same time refusing to
draft its own proxy resolutions.
When trustee committees meet today and the
full board meets tomorrow, the trustees must re
member the statements of last winter that the trus
tees issued their unanimous statement on invest
ment responsibility in good faith. Administrators
said the trustees would not take the recommenda
tions of the CIR lightly, and we hope this will be the
case.
Above all, the trustees must be aware that, with
the ClR's report in their hands, the bulk of the
work ahead and all of the consequences of that
work are now solely on the shoulders of the trus
tees.
We hope the trustees will follow the ClR's re
commendation and also begin voting in favor of
proxies which will prevent American financial in
stitutions from sending more money to South Af
rica.
As to the crucial issue of withdrawal, the CIR has
intelligently recommended that this be done over
a period of time. We think this course of action will
force the South African government to realize how
serious Americans are about this and to begin to
change its policies.
Most of all, we agree with the CIR that divest
ment is not the step to take. As we said last fall,
divestment will deny the Stanford the opportunity
to be an active leader in changing life in South
Africa.
Only nine more weeks
At last week's ASSU Senate meeting, the Stan
ford Organizing Committee slate of 12 senators
voted to allocate $1700 of the senate's discretio
nary fund — 40 per cent of the fund — to the
SOC-sponsored Disorientation Week.

During that meeting, SOC senators even tele
phoned a non-SOC alternate senator who had
never attended a senate meeting and asked him to
come to the meeting. The final vote on the matter
was 13 to 0, with all seven non-SOC senators walk
ing out during the roll call.
Following the backlash of outraged students in
itiating a petition drive for a student referendum
and student officials voicing concern, the SOC
senators — who control a majority of the senate —
have agreed to allocate only $1000 to Disorienta
tion Week.
The actions of the SOC senators are trouble
some for several reasons. First, the SOC senators
compromised only under pressure from students
and some members of the Council of Presidents.
This is apparently in accordance with what SOC
calls "responsibility." SOC has finally realized that
$1700 is too much to donate to one project, espe
cially since the senate only had $2500 left in the
discretionary fund. The senate may even realize
that this is spring quarter, and that means more
student activities and hence more requests for
funding. The senate, after SOC's battlefield com
promise, now has just $1500 to allocate groups
who didn't beat SOC into the senate chambers.
We like Disorientation Week, and so do many
others — witness the amount of funding from
other University offices and groups which will give
Disorientation Week a budget of more than
$10,000. Yet the purpose of the Senate's discretio
nary fund should be to give a substantial portion of
funding to projects which can not get funding
elsewhere — not to provide icing on an already
very large cake.
We also wonder whether the SOC senators, who
call themselves "progressives," understand that
they represent all the students. We doubt that the
SOC slate would have awarded $1700 to the Con
servative Students Union or the Young Libertarian
Alliance for one of their projects.
The most troubling aspect of the SOC slate's
action is that when this year's "do-nothing" senate
does act, it acts contrary to the interests of the
student body. And the senate, rather, the SOC
slate, has corrected its actions (the Elections Re
view Board and the $1700 allocation) only when it
has stared down the barrel of either petitions cal
ling for a student vote on the matter or a presiden
tial veto. This year's senate has shown an amazing
disregard for the senate's perennially low credibil
ity.
Last week Senate Chairperson Fred Grethel,
who is also an SOC member, termed the attitude
of those behind the petition drive "absurd." After
two quarters in the senate, Grethel and the SOC
slate should know all about absurdity. The only
solace we can find is that the senate's term expires
in nine weeks.
