# SOC 'swindles' students

From the folks that brought you a unisex constitution,
free Daily advertising, and (barely) the Election Review
Board, now enjoy SOC Dollar Days, during which your
favorite senate majority will donate $1700 of your money
to the political cause of their choice.
Well, that sounds pretty bitter. But then, it's hard to
get excited about much the SOC's senate circus has
done that isn't some kind of an outrage. In its latest
demonstration of highter ethical ideals and political
genius, though, the SOC senate has given us some
stimulating questions to ponder.
Why did the SOC want the senate's discretionary in
creased? Why did all but one non-SOC senator walk out
of the last senate meeting in disgust? And, just what the
hell is our senate trying to pull?
Power abused
The SOC's feathering of its own nest (in the form of
"Disorientation Week" activities) with senate funds has
got to be the most blatant abuse of power that this
relatively impotent body could conceivably have com
mitted. It could have been worse; but then, they only
had $2500 left to spend.
The very idea of the SOC senate using 70 per cent of its
remaining discretionary funds to directly support a
single event, an event devoted entirely to the political
views to which the voting senators are openly commit
ted, is so fantastic that even a normally cynical observer
of ASSU antics is shocked into disbelief.
You don't have to agree with me that the SOC slate's
tactics are unethical. The sheer political chutzpah of the
operation should be enough to make you wonder just
what kind of fools the students are being played for. The
answer is, first class. Ask yourself some simple hypothet
ical questions and you'll see what kind of sting has been
perpetrated.
Ask, for instance: What if the Hammer and Coffin
dominated Senate of a year ago had donated half of its
total available funds to support that erstwhile bastion of
campus comedy, the Chaparral? Would the SOC have
remained mute, in silent deference to the principle of
the tyranny of an irresponsible majority? Of course not.
Granted, Disorientation Week is a masterpiece of or
ganization and a sincere effort to encourage the discus
sion of important issues (in this respect it may even
surpass the commitment of the aforementioned
Chaparral). It's not a farce.
What is a farce is the senate handing over in one stroke
more money than any previous Senate has even had at

its disposal.
Now, let's be fair (even in the absence of a proper
example). The SOC's fancy financial footwork isn't pro
hibited anywhere in the ASSU Constitution. For that
matter, neither are murder, arson, embezzlement, or
stuffing your favority turkey with SOC leaflets.
No, the SOC's maneuver is well within the guidelines
of the Constitution — a document for which the SOC
must have great respect, since they term at least one of
its provisions "bourgeois."
Still, despite this faith to the written constitution, I
really feel like I've been swindled, and you should, too.
It's pretty plain to anyone who's been watching that the
SOC slate has managed to "represent" students in the
absence of anything faintly resembling majority sup
port.
Of course, that's how politics works sometimes, and
at those times, you just have to suffer in silence. But this
incident isn't just political business-as-usual; it's virtual
banditry.
The SOC senators who kicked in the bucks for Dis
orientation Week simply decided that their cause de
served your support to the tune of $1700, and anted up
with no regard to offers of compromise. Why com
promise, they ask, when you've got the votes?
I'm not going to miss my fifteen-cent share, it's true.
But I don't particularly like it being pried from my pocket
to fill the SOC's chosen coffers, either. That kind on
panhandling isn't allowed on city streets, and the rubber
stamp of the SOC doesn't do much to dignify it.
Election dreams fulfilled
The SOC slate's action is the sort of thing that an
aspiring Senator pulls off in his most fanciful election
eve dreams — certainly wouldn't have the nerve to even
half-seriously suggest during his waking hours. It's a
power play of which the SOC will, I assume, be proud.
Yet I can't help but think that this has been the most
flagrant, heavy-handed piece of ends-justifies-means
politics masquerading as "idealim" that I've seen. All in
all, it's an education in the ideals of the SOC that will be
costly for all concerned.
The SOC slate should put a big hunk of that money
back, or somewhere, where it belongs, before they suf
fer the embarrassment of having the matter taken out of
their hands. Otherwise, they've got something of which
they can be genuinely ashamed.
