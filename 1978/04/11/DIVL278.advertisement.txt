HOW TO TAP A KEG.
Few things in life are as rewarding or as easy as tapping a keg of cold
Schlitz draught beer, providing you follow a few simple rules:
1. Do not roll the keg down a hill before attempting to tap it.
2. Do not pump in too much pressure after tapping. This can force
the natural carbonation out of the beer and make it foamy.
3. If the person tapping the keg makes either of these mistakes.
politely point out the error of his ways. Unless, of course, he weighs
265, plays tackle, and goes by the nickname of Moose. In this case
you should simply say, "Nice goin' Moose!"
To get a keg for your next party, call Siglinda's Beer Person on
Campus, or look in the yellow pages under "Beer!'
