SCRlPcommends the Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR)
on its decision regarding Stanford's in
vestments in corporations operating in
South Africa. The commitment to work
for the withdrawal of U.S. corpora
tions from South Africa is an important
first step in helping to bring an end to
apartheid.
We support the CIR in its call for
"yes" votes on shareholder resolu
tions calling for withdrawal, non
expansion, and the termination of
bank loans. We urge the trustees to
concur.
In reaching its decision, the CIR has
correctly concluded that in the past
30 years U.S. corporations have done
much to strengthen the formation of
the apartheid structure in South Af
rica. In the word of the CIR Report,
"Foreign firms . . . have for years di
rectly and indirectly contributed to
the development and consolidation
of a racially repressive system."
As the report goes on to state, this
aid has come in the form of needed
capital, the modernization of the
South African economy, taxes paid to
the government, the sale of goods
and services to the government for
use as instruments of repression,
and by the failure of American firms
to challenge the many laws that form
the basis of the apartheid structure.
Since the maintenance of the apar
theid system ensures the existence
of a climate where corporations may
reap huge profits, it is little wonder
that companies have been so willing
to extend their aid to that system.
Prosperity enhances oppression
But most important, in its majority
report, the CIR rejected the notion

that U.S. corporations could be a
progressive force for change in the
future. The progressive force argu
ment is based on the belief that the
influx of foreign capital would have a
liberalizing effect on South African
society.
However, the committee's analysis
of this argument stresses that
"economic prosperity has coincided
with — and to some degree been a
cause of — greater political oppres
sion of South African blacks."
Furthermore, the report argues
that U.S. firms have not been "prog
ressive" in the past and that this per
formance "leads us to doubt that
substantial improvement will occur
in the future."
The CIR has correctly recognized
that U.S. corporations have done
much to hurt the position of blacks in
South Africa and that they can and
will do little in the future to remedy
the inequality and oppression they
have helped to foster.
The committee thus recommends
that Stanford support proxies calling
for corporate non-expansion, with
drawal, and the termination of bank
loans to South Africa. These actions
will finally remove U.S. vested in
terests there and will clear the way
for the incorporation of a responsible
foreign policy with respect to South
Africa.
Stanford's support of withdrawal
will serve as a powerful statement to
U.S. companies and the Pretoria
government that U.S. economic
support of apartheid will not be tol
erated.
Trustees must vote 'yes'
This year, the trustees have no re
spectable alternative to voting in
favor of proxies for corporate with
drawal and an end to bank loans. But
will they? Since 1972, the trustees
have abstained or voted against all
South African proxies. This year, they
must vote "yes."
We call upon the Stanford Com
munity to watch for the Trustees' re
sponse to the CIR recommenda
tions. We also ask the community to
observe the effectiveness of proxy
voting.
SCRIP believes that while proxies
are valuable in bringing attention to
the South African situation, divest
ment is the most convincing action
for promoting corporate withdrawal.
Shareholders' resolutions routinely
fail by over 90 per cent since most
stock is owned and voted by man
agement or individuals sympathetic

with their interests.
Since last fall, SCRIP has been cal
ling for divestment of stocks in eight
corporations whose activities es
pecially benefit the apartheid sys
tem. We feel that the university, as an
owner of these corporatins, is obli
gated t«. divest once it has taken a
position such as ClR's i.e. against
corporate activities in South Africa.
Divestment is the most effective
means to bring about the changes we
all hope for. Already the universities
of Wisconsin, Massachusetts and
Oregon; Hampshire and Smith col
lege; and several trade unions have
decided to sever all ties to profits
wrung from the black majority in
South Africa.
Just recently Citibank, one of the
major lenders to the South African
Government, has decided to make
no new loans to apartheid. It's no
coincidence that Citibank's decision
came in the wake of divestment by
these institutions.
Divestment by Stanford will
catalyze the sale of stock at many of
the 100 universities with active cam
pus movements against apartheid,
and will have a resounding effect in
corporate boardrooms.
Hearings called for
In anticipation of the probable
outcome of the proxies, and in light
of the ClR's commitment to corpo
rate withdrawal, we call upon the CIR
to hold hearings this month concern
ing divestment of corporations
operating in South Africa.
In particular, the CIR and the trus
tees should look at the activities of
the major lenders to the South Afri
can Government. IBM's computers
are used by the Department of De
fense for South Africa's atomic
energy and strategic arms programs,
as well as by the Department of Pris
ons and the pass book system. Mobil
has broken U.S. law by selling oil to
Rhodesia through South Africa as
well as providing petroleum to the
police and military.
We hope that the ClR's stand on
corporate withdrawal will lead to
their serious consideration of di
vestment in the weeks ahead. Yet
their decision to recommend the sup
port of proxies calling for with
drawal, non-expansion, and the end
of bank loans to South Africa is a
positive step foreward in the move
ment to end apartheid. It should be
supported.

"economic prosperity has coincided
with — and to some degree been a
cause of — greater political oppres
sion of South African blacks."
Furthermore, the report argues
that U.S. firms have not been "prog
ressive" in the past and that this per
formance "leads us to doubt that
substantial improvement will occur
in the future."
The CIR has correctly recognized
that U.S. corporations have done
much to hurt the position of blacks in
South Africa and that they can and
will do little in the future to remedy
the inequality and oppression they
have helped to foster.
The committee thus recommends
that Stanford support proxies calling
for corporate non-expansion, with
drawal, and the termination of bank
loans to South Africa. These actions
will finally remove U.S. vested in
terests there and will clear the way
for the incorporation of a responsible
foreign policy with respect to South
Africa.
Stanford's support of withdrawal
will serve as a powerful statement to
U.S. companies and the Pretoria
government that U.S. economic
support of apartheid will not be tol
erated.
Trustees must vote 'yes'
This year, the trustees have no re
spectable alternative to voting in
favor of proxies for corporate with
drawal and an end to bank loans. But
will they? Since 1972, the trustees
have abstained or voted against all
South African proxies. This year, they
must vote "yes."
We call upon the Stanford Com
munity to watch for the Trustees' re
sponse to the CIR recommenda
tions. We also ask the community to
observe the effectiveness of proxy
voting.
SCRIP believes that while proxies
are valuable in bringing attention to
the South African situation, divest
ment is the most convincing action
for promoting corporate withdrawal.
Shareholders' resolutions routinely
fail by over 90 per cent since most
stock is owned and voted by man
agement or individuals sympathetic

with their interests.
Since last fall, SCRIP has been cal
ling for divestment of stocks in eight
corporations whose activities es
pecially benefit the apartheid sys
tem. We feel that the university, as an
owner of these corporatins, is obli
gated t«. divest once it has taken a
position such as ClR's i.e. against
corporate activities in South Africa.
Divestment is the most effective
means to bring about the changes we
all hope for. Already the universities
of Wisconsin, Massachusetts and
Oregon; Hampshire and Smith col
lege; and several trade unions have
decided to sever all ties to profits
wrung from the black majority in
South Africa.
Just recently Citibank, one of the
major lenders to the South African
Government, has decided to make
no new loans to apartheid. It's no
coincidence that Citibank's decision
came in the wake of divestment by
these institutions.
Divestment by Stanford will
catalyze the sale of stock at many of
the 100 universities with active cam
pus movements against apartheid,
and will have a resounding effect in
corporate boardrooms.
Hearings called for
In anticipation of the probable
outcome of the proxies, and in light
of the ClR's commitment to corpo
rate withdrawal, we call upon the CIR
to hold hearings this month concern
ing divestment of corporations
operating in South Africa.
In particular, the CIR and the trus
tees should look at the activities of
the major lenders to the South Afri
can Government. IBM's computers
are used by the Department of De
fense for South Africa's atomic
energy and strategic arms programs,
as well as by the Department of Pris
ons and the pass book system. Mobil
has broken U.S. law by selling oil to
Rhodesia through South Africa as
well as providing petroleum to the
police and military.
We hope that the ClR's stand on
corporate withdrawal will lead to
their serious consideration of di
vestment in the weeks ahead. Yet
their decision to recommend the sup
port of proxies calling for with
drawal, non-expansion, and the end
of bank loans to South Africa is a
positive step foreward in the move
ment to end apartheid. It should be
supported.

We support the CIR in its call for

In reaching its decision, the CIR has

much to strengthen the formation of
the apartheid structure in South Af

"Foreign firms . . . have for years di
rectly and indirectly contributed to
the development and consolidation
of a racially repressive system."
As the report goes on to state, this
aid has come in the form of needed
capital, the modernization of the
South African economy, taxes paid to
the government, the sale of goods
and services to the government for
use as instruments of repression,
and by the failure of American firms
to challenge the many laws that form
the basis of the apartheid structure.
Since the maintenance of the apar

of a climate where corporations may
reap huge profits, it is little wonder
that companies have been so willing
to extend their aid to that system.

fail by over 90 per cent since most
stock is owned and voted by man
agement or individuals sympathetic

with their interests.
Since last fall, SCRIP has been cal
ling for divestment of stocks in eight
corporations whose activities es
pecially benefit the apartheid sys
tem. We feel that the university, as an
owner of these corporatins, is obli
gated t«. divest once it has taken a
position such as ClR's i.e. against
corporate activities in South Africa.
Divestment is the most effective
means to bring about the changes we
all hope for. Already the universities
of Wisconsin, Massachusetts and
Oregon; Hampshire and Smith col
lege; and several trade unions have
decided to sever all ties to profits
wrung from the black majority in
South Africa.
Just recently Citibank, one of the
major lenders to the South African
Government, has decided to make
no new loans to apartheid. It's no
coincidence that Citibank's decision
came in the wake of divestment by
these institutions.
Divestment by Stanford will
catalyze the sale of stock at many of
the 100 universities with active cam
pus movements against apartheid,
and will have a resounding effect in
corporate boardrooms.
Hearings called for
In anticipation of the probable
outcome of the proxies, and in light
of the ClR's commitment to corpo
rate withdrawal, we call upon the CIR
to hold hearings this month concern
ing divestment of corporations
operating in South Africa.
In particular, the CIR and the trus
tees should look at the activities of
the major lenders to the South Afri
can Government. IBM's computers
are used by the Department of De
fense for South Africa's atomic
energy and strategic arms programs,
as well as by the Department of Pris
ons and the pass book system. Mobil
has broken U.S. law by selling oil to
Rhodesia through South Africa as
well as providing petroleum to the
police and military.
We hope that the ClR's stand on
corporate withdrawal will lead to
their serious consideration of di
vestment in the weeks ahead. Yet
their decision to recommend the sup
port of proxies calling for with
drawal, non-expansion, and the end
of bank loans to South Africa is a
positive step foreward in the move
ment to end apartheid. It should be
supported.
