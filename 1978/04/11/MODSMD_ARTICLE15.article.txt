A $1.05 million project to for
tify the central plant against
Rossible earthquake damage
eads a list of some 18 projects
totalling $3.5 million to be con
sidered by the Board of Trus
tees at its meeting today.
The projects, collectively
known as the General Plant
Improvements (CPI) Program,
will be in part debt financed
through bonding from the
California Educational
Facilities Authority (CEFA). The
board approved CEFA bonding
in a meeting earlier this
academic year.
Continuation of the CPI
program is the only major ac
tion slated for board attention.
The largest single project will
be anchorage of the central
plant oilers, chillers, piping
and condensate receiver tank
to guard against major damage
from potential earthquakes.
According to the trustee
background report, a major
quake would likely result in
collapse of the facility "permit
ting live steam to escape with
consequent explosions, loss of
life and most likely total loss of
the plant."
"In such an event,"the re
port states, "the University can
be expected to be without
heat, cooling or emergency
power for some two years."
When completed, the an
chorage should reduce the
outage to a period "of a few
days."

Other large projects include
$347,000 to provide electrical
hookups for the new Stanford
Center for Information Proces
sing Computer Facility, a
$328,000 parking lot of Lagunita
Court and a $324,000 Calvez
Mall landscaping project which
will "formalize closure" of
Calvez Street to vehicular traf
fic from Serra Street to Escon
dido Road and provide a land
scaped setting for pedestrion
and bicycle circulation.
The SCIP facility, recently
approved by the trustees for
construction in Jordan Quad,

will require power for both the
computer-oriented functions
and for building operations
such as lighting, fans, pumps
and elevators.
The SCIP facility will be
hooked into the University
central plant chilled-water
loop at a cost of $130,400. The
new Margaret Jacks Hall, under
construction in the main
Quad, will also get $90,000 of
the CPI appropriation for a
similar link-up.
Hot water distribution to the
new SCIP facility is also being
included in the CPI program.

The ilBB,OOO project will re
plate the gas-fired hot water
boilers in various Jordan Quad
buildings and connect the
building with the central plant
for heating.
Other smaller parking,
roadwork, lighting and land
scaping projects are included
in the program.
Also included in the CPI
program is a continuation of
several energy conservation
programs begun in previous
years, however, no major pro
jects are anticipated in the
coming year.
