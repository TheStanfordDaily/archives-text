# LAC presents study workshops
## 
### Janet Bailey 
The Learning Assistance Center will present a
variety of short workshops during spring quar
ter on areas related to study skills.
In addition to workshops on time manage
ment, vocabulary development, test prepara
tion and test anxiety, which are being repeated
from last quarter, a new course on grammar wiil
be offered.
Sallie Kueny, an instructor at the center, said
the grammar workshop will focus on elements
of style, word choice and analogies as well as on
basic grammar and punctuation. The course
should be especially helpful for foreign students
and for students preparing for the Graduate Re
cords examination.
The non-credit short courses differ from the
quarter-long LAC-1, Effective Learning Skills, in
that each workshop focuses on a specific skill
area.
"This way a student can concentrate on one

particular area of interest without taking the
general course fora whole quarter," Kueny said.
A workshop usually meets two hours a week for
a month.
Students have responded positively to past
workshops, though numbers have been small,
Kueny said.
"I've had several students drop by to say they
felt much better about their test performance
after taking the test anxiety course," said Kueny.
"But publicity is a continual problem. Many stu
dents just don't know about the services we
offer."
The center also provides credit courses in
reading rate improvement and critical reading
and writing, tutoring by students in most
academic areas, and training for peer coun
selors.
Interested students are encouraged to drop
by the center at 123 Meyer Library or to call the
office at 497-2207 for more information.
