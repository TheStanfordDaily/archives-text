American women "are put in
a Catch-22 situation where if
they don't pursue their own in
terests, others don't either,"
according to Lee Novick, ASSU
guest professor. •
"We understand that we
have to do for ourselves and
we're doing it," Novick said.
"What bothers me is the fact
that we're doing our own thing
seems to make men defen
sive."
One of three spring lectu
rers sponsored by the ASSU
Guest Professorship Board,
Novick, 46, is currently teach
ing an undergraduate specials
seminar entitled "Women's
Rights in America; A Political
Perspective."
"I think it's because the fun
damental issues of the wo
men's movement are a threat
to men," she said. "We are ad
vocating a revolution of sex
roles which I think is very dif
ficult for people to deal with on
a personal basis.
"Men could become much
more supportive to the politi
cal goals of the women's
movement," she added. Some
men shy away because
"they've been a little burnt by
the civil rights movement" and
others "haven't found a vehi
cle through which to help."
Positions held
Described by Cecelia Bur
ciaga, assistant provost, as
"one of the most knowledge
able feminists in the women's
movement," Novick is cur
rently coordinator of the Na
tional Women's Political Con
ference in Houston.
In the past she has served as
vice-chairwoman of the Na
tional Women's Political
Caucus and as administrative
assistant to former representa
tive Bella Abzug (D-New 'York
City).
Describing herself as a
"1960s person," Novick said
that "I was happiest in the '60s. I
think I'm essentially an or
ganizer and an activist" whose
"greatest pleasure comes from
seeing growth and develop
ment and challenge."

The objective of hc> course
is to analyze the role of women
in American politics through a
comparison of the contempor
ary feminist movement and its
predecessors, relating it to
other movements for social
change, Novick said.
"While American women
have been traditionally
excluded from power, they
have rarely allowed themselves
to become alienated from the

political process," she said,
adding that women "have
functioned as the great rede
mptive spirit in all the
humanitarian efforts that have
gone into building this coun
try."
One of the obstacles to the
political success of the wo

men's movement is the con
tinuing "trivialization of wo
men's issues and a lack of un
derstanding of how they inter
face with all human issues,"
Novick said.
Problems
Other problems include
"getting legislators and Con
gresspeople to understand
that women are a very large
constituency" and a lack of
sustained press coverage, she

said.
Novick described the transi
tion from the women's move
ment of the '60s to the '70s as a
movement from "protest to
politics."
"The reason is that so many
of the things that directly affect
our lives as women — jobs,

health, child care, the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) —
are controlled and bottled up
by male legislators," she said.
Citing public opinion polls
which indicate public support
for the ERA, the Supreme
Court abortion decision, and
women in public offices,
Novick claimed that "political
leadership and institutions are
still controlled by middle-aged
white men who are not mov
ing."
Getting change
"The way in which you get
change is that you've got to
keep pressuring," Novick said.
"I think the women's move
ment needs to become a mass
movement with millions of
members the way the suffrage
movement was and that we
have to find some way of exer
cising our power."
Novick criticized the dearth
of women in the federal gov
ernment. While its encourag
ing that women are "moving
into municipal offices and state
offices" it is "also sort of typical
— women have been allowed
entry in the places closest to
home and which pay the least
anvunt," she said.
She emphasized that the
situation is changing, how
ever; men and women
everywhere demonstrate "a
much greater responsiveness
to female candidates."
For the future Novick pre
dicts "a new pattern of women
in politics."
Role model
"I think the new role model
is going to be the young
woman who leaves Stanford,
goes to law school, comes out,
works in a few campaigns and
maybe a year or two later runs
for the state legislature and
then for Congress — or maybe
runs directly for Congress,"
she said.
Novick's past political,
communication and research
work have earned her honors
such as the 1975 UNA-USA
Woman of the Year Award and
a listing in "Who's Who in
American Politics."
Born in a mining town

ouside of Scranton, Pa.,
Novick said she became con
scious of social issues such as
the welfare system, union or
ganizing and environmental
destruction while still a child.
"I think I have been a
feminist since I was a kid,"
Novick said. "I grew up in a
very orthodox Jewish family
and I was very conscious of
role assignments. I know that
even as a child I'd try to break
out of them."
"The fact that I was a very
quick learner" produced con
flict because "my family didn't
believe very much in educating
girls," she said.
Family life
Married early, she has three
children and is now separated.
"We are an example of a family
which had difficulty surmount
ing traditional expectations,"
Novick said. "We found that it
was very difficult for both
people to pursue their
careers."
Although she said her chil
dren are her "greatest
achievement," Novick is proud
of her contribution to the Nati
nal Women's Political Caucus's

Houston Conference, which
concluded the International
Women's Year.
One of the major ac
complishments of the Con
gressionally funded confer
ence was the putting "down on
paper of a plan of action which
I think will provide the basis for
a decade of legislation," she
said.
"Houston was a political
convention with soul," Novick
said. "It showed that when
women run something, they
not only can do it efficiently,
they can allow for both effi
ciency and emotion."
Although Novick described
politics as a "potential bridge"
by which men and women can
work together, she said the
system needs to be reformed
and made "operational."
Earlier education
"Part of the system really de
pends on us. We have to begin
our political education much
earlier and people have to
learn to make their way around
the system," she said.
One of her reasons for com
ing here "is that students are not
sufficiently exposed to learn

ing how to use the political sys
tem," Novick said. Laughing,
she said that "part of the
reason I'm here at Stanford is
that I'm casing the joint for my
kids."
Her class is divided into
Tuesday and Thursday evening
lectures. In the Thursday lec
tures, open to the public,
Novick plans to tackle "the
more popular aspects of the
political issues." Enrollment
for Tuesday sessions is still
open.
One course highlight al
ready scheduled is a seminar on
viewpoints of minority women
for Disorientation Week which
will feature representatives of
Asian, Black, Hispanic, and Na
tive American caucuses.
Novick said she hopes to get
involved in the Stanford com
munity during her'stay. She is
already involved with her stu
dents: "Some want to go to
Washington to work, arid I'd
like to give them direction or
assistance. I'd like to have an
impact on them becoming
more politicized," she said.
"Someday I hope to see them
running for office."

American women "are put in
a Catch-22 situation where if
they don't pursue their own in
terests, others don't either,"
according to Lee Novick, ASSU
guest professor. •
"We understand that we
have to do for ourselves and
we're doing it," Novick said.
"What bothers me is the fact
that we're doing our own thing
seems to make men defen
sive."
One of three spring lectu
rers sponsored by the ASSU
Guest Professorship Board,
Novick, 46, is currently teach
ing an undergraduate specials
seminar entitled "Women's
Rights in America; A Political
Perspective."
"I think it's because the fun
damental issues of the wo
men's movement are a threat
to men," she said. "We are ad
vocating a revolution of sex
roles which I think is very dif
ficult for people to deal with on
a personal basis.
"Men could become much
more supportive to the politi
cal goals of the women's
movement," she added. Some
men shy away because
"they've been a little burnt by
the civil rights movement" and
others "haven't found a vehi
cle through which to help."
Positions held
Described by Cecelia Bur
ciaga, assistant provost, as
"one of the most knowledge
able feminists in the women's
movement," Novick is cur
rently coordinator of the Na
tional Women's Political Con
ference in Houston.
In the past she has served as
vice-chairwoman of the Na
tional Women's Political
Caucus and as administrative
assistant to former representa
tive Bella Abzug (D-New 'York
City).
Describing herself as a
"1960s person," Novick said
that "I was happiest in the '60s. I
think I'm essentially an or
ganizer and an activist" whose
"greatest pleasure comes from
seeing growth and develop
ment and challenge."

The objective of hc> course
is to analyze the role of women
in American politics through a
comparison of the contempor
ary feminist movement and its
predecessors, relating it to
other movements for social
change, Novick said.
"While American women
have been traditionally
excluded from power, they
have rarely allowed themselves
to become alienated from the

political process," she said,
adding that women "have
functioned as the great rede
mptive spirit in all the
humanitarian efforts that have
gone into building this coun
try."
One of the obstacles to the
political success of the wo

men's movement is the con
tinuing "trivialization of wo
men's issues and a lack of un
derstanding of how they inter
face with all human issues,"
Novick said.
Problems
Other problems include
"getting legislators and Con
gresspeople to understand
that women are a very large
constituency" and a lack of
sustained press coverage, she

said.
Novick described the transi
tion from the women's move
ment of the '60s to the '70s as a
movement from "protest to
politics."
"The reason is that so many
of the things that directly affect
our lives as women — jobs,

health, child care, the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) —
are controlled and bottled up
by male legislators," she said.
Citing public opinion polls
which indicate public support
for the ERA, the Supreme
Court abortion decision, and
women in public offices,
Novick claimed that "political
leadership and institutions are
still controlled by middle-aged
white men who are not mov
ing."
Getting change
"The way in which you get
change is that you've got to
keep pressuring," Novick said.
"I think the women's move
ment needs to become a mass
movement with millions of
members the way the suffrage
movement was and that we
have to find some way of exer
cising our power."
Novick criticized the dearth
of women in the federal gov
ernment. While its encourag
ing that women are "moving
into municipal offices and state
offices" it is "also sort of typical
— women have been allowed
entry in the places closest to
home and which pay the least
anvunt," she said.
She emphasized that the
situation is changing, how
ever; men and women
everywhere demonstrate "a
much greater responsiveness
to female candidates."
For the future Novick pre
dicts "a new pattern of women
in politics."
Role model
"I think the new role model
is going to be the young
woman who leaves Stanford,
goes to law school, comes out,
works in a few campaigns and
maybe a year or two later runs
for the state legislature and
then for Congress — or maybe
runs directly for Congress,"
she said.
Novick's past political,
communication and research
work have earned her honors
such as the 1975 UNA-USA
Woman of the Year Award and
a listing in "Who's Who in
American Politics."
Born in a mining town

ouside of Scranton, Pa.,
Novick said she became con
scious of social issues such as
the welfare system, union or
ganizing and environmental
destruction while still a child.
"I think I have been a
feminist since I was a kid,"
Novick said. "I grew up in a
very orthodox Jewish family
and I was very conscious of
role assignments. I know that
even as a child I'd try to break
out of them."
"The fact that I was a very
quick learner" produced con
flict because "my family didn't
believe very much in educating
girls," she said.
Family life
Married early, she has three
children and is now separated.
"We are an example of a family
which had difficulty surmount
ing traditional expectations,"
Novick said. "We found that it
was very difficult for both
people to pursue their
careers."
Although she said her chil
dren are her "greatest
achievement," Novick is proud
of her contribution to the Nati
nal Women's Political Caucus's

Houston Conference, which
concluded the International
Women's Year.
One of the major ac
complishments of the Con
gressionally funded confer
ence was the putting "down on
paper of a plan of action which
I think will provide the basis for
a decade of legislation," she
said.
"Houston was a political
convention with soul," Novick
said. "It showed that when
women run something, they
not only can do it efficiently,
they can allow for both effi
ciency and emotion."
Although Novick described
politics as a "potential bridge"
by which men and women can
work together, she said the
system needs to be reformed
and made "operational."
Earlier education
"Part of the system really de
pends on us. We have to begin
our political education much
earlier and people have to
learn to make their way around
the system," she said.
One of her reasons for com
ing here "is that students are not

Although she said her chil

achievement," Novick is proud
of her contribution to the Nati

Houston Conference, which
concluded the International
Women's Year.
One of the major ac
complishments of the Con
gressionally funded confer

paper of a plan of action which
I think will provide the basis for

said.
"Houston was a political
convention with soul," Novick
said. "It showed that when
women run something, they
not only can do it efficiently,
they can allow for both effi
ciency and emotion."
Although Novick described
politics as a "potential bridge"
by which men and women can
work together, she said the
system needs to be reformed
and made "operational."
Earlier education
"Part of the system really de

Her class is divided into
Tuesday and Thursday evening

Novick plans to tackle "the
more popular aspects of the

American women "are put in
a Catch-22 situation where if
they don't pursue their own in
terests, others don't either,"
according to Lee Novick, ASSU
guest professor. •
"We understand that we
have to do for ourselves and
we're doing it," Novick said.
"What bothers me is the fact
that we're doing our own thing
seems to make men defen
sive."
One of three spring lectu
rers sponsored by the ASSU
Guest Professorship Board,
Novick, 46, is currently teach
ing an undergraduate specials
seminar entitled "Women's
Rights in America; A Political
Perspective."
"I think it's because the fun
damental issues of the wo
men's movement are a threat
to men," she said. "We are ad
vocating a revolution of sex
roles which I think is very dif
ficult for people to deal with on
a personal basis.
"Men could become much
more supportive to the politi
cal goals of the women's
movement," she added. Some
men shy away because
"they've been a little burnt by
the civil rights movement" and
others "haven't found a vehi
cle through which to help."
Positions held
Described by Cecelia Bur
ciaga, assistant provost, as
"one of the most knowledge
able feminists in the women's
movement," Novick is cur
rently coordinator of the Na
tional Women's Political Con
ference in Houston.
In the past she has served as
vice-chairwoman of the Na
tional Women's Political
Caucus and as administrative
assistant to former representa
tive Bella Abzug (D-New 'York
City).
Describing herself as a
"1960s person," Novick said
that "I was happiest in the '60s. I
think I'm essentially an or
ganizer and an activist" whose
"greatest pleasure comes from
seeing growth and develop
ment and challenge."

The objective of hc> course
is to analyze the role of women
in American politics through a
comparison of the contempor
ary feminist movement and its
predecessors, relating it to
other movements for social
change, Novick said.
"While American women
have been traditionally
excluded from power, they
have rarely allowed themselves
to become alienated from the

political process," she said,
adding that women "have
functioned as the great rede
mptive spirit in all the
humanitarian efforts that have
gone into building this coun
try."
One of the obstacles to the
political success of the wo

men's movement is the con
tinuing "trivialization of wo
men's issues and a lack of un
derstanding of how they inter
face with all human issues,"
Novick said.
Problems
Other problems include
"getting legislators and Con
gresspeople to understand
that women are a very large
constituency" and a lack of
sustained press coverage, she

said.
Novick described the transi
tion from the women's move
ment of the '60s to the '70s as a
movement from "protest to
politics."
"The reason is that so many
of the things that directly affect
our lives as women — jobs,

health, child care, the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) —
are controlled and bottled up
by male legislators," she said.
Citing public opinion polls
which indicate public support
for the ERA, the Supreme
Court abortion decision, and
women in public offices,
Novick claimed that "political
leadership and institutions are
still controlled by middle-aged
white men who are not mov
ing."
Getting change
"The way in which you get
change is that you've got to
keep pressuring," Novick said.
"I think the women's move
ment needs to become a mass
movement with millions of
members the way the suffrage
movement was and that we
have to find some way of exer
cising our power."
Novick criticized the dearth
of women in the federal gov
ernment. While its encourag
ing that women are "moving
into municipal offices and state
offices" it is "also sort of typical
— women have been allowed
entry in the places closest to
home and which pay the least
anvunt," she said.
She emphasized that the
situation is changing, how
ever; men and women
everywhere demonstrate "a
much greater responsiveness
to female candidates."
For the future Novick pre
dicts "a new pattern of women
in politics."
Role model
"I think the new role model
is going to be the young
woman who leaves Stanford,
goes to law school, comes out,
works in a few campaigns and
maybe a year or two later runs
for the state legislature and
then for Congress — or maybe
runs directly for Congress,"
she said.
Novick's past political,
communication and research
work have earned her honors
such as the 1975 UNA-USA
Woman of the Year Award and
a listing in "Who's Who in
American Politics."
Born in a mining town

ouside of Scranton, Pa.,
Novick said she became con
scious of social issues such as
the welfare system, union or
ganizing and environmental
destruction while still a child.
"I think I have been a
feminist since I was a kid,"
Novick said. "I grew up in a
very orthodox Jewish family
and I was very conscious of
role assignments. I know that
even as a child I'd try to break
out of them."
"The fact that I was a very
quick learner" produced con
flict because "my family didn't
believe very much in educating
girls," she said.
Family life
Married early, she has three
children and is now separated.
"We are an example of a family
which had difficulty surmount
ing traditional expectations,"
Novick said. "We found that it
was very difficult for both
people to pursue their
careers."
