## â€”classical music/thomas hempel On New York's chamber soloists 
### 
Judging from Friday night's
performance here of the six
Brandenburger Concerti of
Johann Sebastian Bach, the
New York Chamber Soloists
are an ensemble who truly jus
tify their name. Their playing
shows overall a polish which
quickly betrays their 20 year
history.
The evening started with the
third concerto, really the first
in composition. Scored for
strings and continuo, this
work, as compared to the later
ones, is still relatively conser
vative and shows little contrast
between solo and tutti. The
NYCS immediately distin
guished themselves by their
sense of ensemble; they
played not as a chamber or
chestra, but as one instrument.
This was followed by the last
of the concerti, No. 5. Written
for flute, harpsichord, violin
and strings it is remarkable for
the use of harpsichord as sol
oist, rather than merely to pro
vide continuo. As such it rep
resents a historically isolated
attempt, for it had absolutely
no influence on the history of
the keyboard concerto, not
even those of his son C.P.E.
Bach.
Here the audience was
treated to a positively gripping
interpretation. The first move
ment slowly builds up tension,
culminating in a great cadenza
for harpsichord solo, beauti
fully performed by Harriet
Wingreen, which rather than
dispelling the tension, in
creases it further.This was fol
lowed by a grave affetuoso and
a dramatic finale, every note
reflecting the soloists con
summate understanding of
these works.
The first half of the concert
closes with No. 1, Bach's third
try in this collection. Ambiti
ously scored for violin, three
oboes, two horns, bassoon,
strings and continuo, the work
clearly shows the differences
between Bach's and Vivaldi's
style.
After the intermission there
followed No. 6, second in
composition. A fascinating
work, it is scored for strings
without violins and continuo,
the work clearly shows the dif
ferences between Bach's and
Vivaldi's style.
In the first movement Bach

derives, quite in contrast to
Vivaldi, all the material from
the opening tutti. The result
has less variety and clarity of
phrase, but is surely much
more intense. Bach makes
such a movement work by his
clever imitative counterpoint,
which gave the performers
ample opportunity to show
their solistic virtuosity as the
opening theme was thrown
around from instrument to in
strument.
This was followed by a very
chromatic slow movement, an
enjoyable allegro and a stately
concluding series of dances.
Throughout the work the wind
players showed their prowess,
from the opening horn calls to
the oboe passage in the fourth
movement.
After the intermission there
followed No. 6, second in
composition. A fascinating
work, it is scored for strings
without violins and continuo,
and is made up of two cheerful
outer movements flanking a
dark and brooding adagio.
With only seven players par
ticipating here, the listener was
once again struck by the fluid
ity and grace of the group's
playing, by the way even the
solo passages were integrated
into the total ensemble.
Next came a thoughtful
realization of No. 4, written
just before and on a par with
No. 5. In spite of the surface
brilliance of the first move
ment, this is a very reflective,
introspective piece, especially
in the almost tragic slow
movement. The concert closed
with a spirited rendition of the
fourth concerto, No. 2 in D.
Scored for violin, flute, oboe,
trumpet, strings and continuo,
it is one of the most colorful
works in the collection.
Trumpeter Edward Carrol
should be complemented for
his fresh and lively perfor
mances in the outer move
ments. The oboist also deli
vered a fine performance in the
haunting slow movement. This
is why I said at the outset that
the group justifies its name: its
combination of perfect en
semble and solistic virtuosity,
together with a profound feel
ing for the music makes them
truly chamber soloists, and as
sures audiences of a memora
ble performance.

ferences between Bach's and
Vivaldi's style.
In the first movement Bach

derives, quite in contrast to
Vivaldi, all the material from
the opening tutti. The result
has less variety and clarity of
phrase, but is surely much
more intense. Bach makes
such a movement work by his
clever imitative counterpoint,
which gave the performers
ample opportunity to show
their solistic virtuosity as the
opening theme was thrown
around from instrument to in
strument.
This was followed by a very
chromatic slow movement, an
enjoyable allegro and a stately
concluding series of dances.
Throughout the work the wind
players showed their prowess,
from the opening horn calls to
the oboe passage in the fourth
movement.
After the intermission there
followed No. 6, second in
composition. A fascinating
work, it is scored for strings
without violins and continuo,
and is made up of two cheerful
outer movements flanking a
dark and brooding adagio.
With only seven players par
ticipating here, the listener was
once again struck by the fluid
ity and grace of the group's
playing, by the way even the
solo passages were integrated
into the total ensemble.
Next came a thoughtful
realization of No. 4, written
just before and on a par with
No. 5. In spite of the surface
brilliance of the first move
ment, this is a very reflective,
introspective piece, especially
in the almost tragic slow
movement. The concert closed
with a spirited rendition of the
fourth concerto, No. 2 in D.
Scored for violin, flute, oboe,
trumpet, strings and continuo,
it is one of the most colorful
works in the collection.
Trumpeter Edward Carrol
should be complemented for
his fresh and lively perfor
mances in the outer move
ments. The oboist also deli
vered a fine performance in the
haunting slow movement. This
is why I said at the outset that
the group justifies its name: its
combination of perfect en
semble and solistic virtuosity,
together with a profound feel
ing for the music makes them
truly chamber soloists, and as
sures audiences of a memora
ble performance.
Judging from Friday night's
performance here of the six
Brandenburger Concerti of
Johann Sebastian Bach, the
New York Chamber Soloists
are an ensemble who truly jus
tify their name. Their playing
shows overall a polish which
quickly betrays their 20 year
history.
The evening started with the
third concerto, really the first
in composition. Scored for
strings and continuo, this
work, as compared to the later
ones, is still relatively conser
vative and shows little contrast
between solo and tutti. The
NYCS immediately distin
guished themselves by their
sense of ensemble; they
played not as a chamber or
chestra, but as one instrument.
This was followed by the last
of the concerti, No. 5. Written
for flute, harpsichord, violin
and strings it is remarkable for
the use of harpsichord as sol
oist, rather than merely to pro
vide continuo. As such it rep
resents a historically isolated
attempt, for it had absolutely
no influence on the history of
the keyboard concerto, not
even those of his son C.P.E.
Bach.
Here the audience was
treated to a positively gripping
interpretation. The first move
ment slowly builds up tension,
culminating in a great cadenza
for harpsichord solo, beauti
fully performed by Harriet
Wingreen, which rather than
dispelling the tension, in
creases it further.This was fol
lowed by a grave affetuoso and
a dramatic finale, every note
reflecting the soloists con
summate understanding of
these works.
The first half of the concert
closes with No. 1, Bach's third
try in this collection. Ambiti
ously scored for violin, three
oboes, two horns, bassoon,
strings and continuo, the work
clearly shows the differences
between Bach's and Vivaldi's
style.
