# Conference warns of sleeping pill hazards

Sleeping pills are the riskiest way
to get to sleep, but most doctors and
patients don't know it, said a group
of sleep researchers during a recent
seminar in Palo Alto.
However, the researchers said that
the convenience of dispensing hyno
tics, or sleep-causing drugs, to pa
tients complaining of insomnia to
gether with carefully shielded
doctor-patient relationships has
stunted the use of other treatments
for insomnia.
Researchers added that these fac
tors have also created the need for

studies on the use of sleeping pills.
The sleep researchers attended
the 18th Annual meeting of the As
sociation for the Psychophysiologi
cal Study of Sleep held last week at
Rickey's Hyatt House. The meeting
was sponsored by the Stanford Med
ical School Sleep Disorders Clinic
and Research Center.
"Pills are not the solution to
American problems of anxiety and
life," said James Ferguson of the Na
tional Institute on Drug Abuse. Most
hypnotics lose their hypnotic effect
when they are taken for more than
three nights in a row, he said.

But a recent study showed that de
spite the risks 8.7 per cent of U.S.
adults have used hypnotic drugs,
said Ferguson. The report said prac
ticing physicians continue to pre
scribe hypnotics in a manner "incon
sistent with the bulk of information"
published on the subject, he added.
"I personally have not given any
body a barbituate for five or six
years," said Cowell Dr. David Doro
sin. "We look for alternatives," he
said, such as Cowell's psychological
counseling services.
But older doctors or those unfamil
iar with the latest medical lore on

hypnotics are prone to stick to their
routines of prescribing the pills, Fer
guson said at the seminar.
Doctors must summon the cour
age to refuse patient's request for
hypnotics because of the dangers
being discovered, said James Minard
of the College of Medicine and De
ntistry in the New Jersey Medical
School.
John Bunker, acting director of
community and preventive medicine
at Stanford Medical School, said he
saw the problem rooted in the con
venience of pills.
"I am struck as you try to look at
the dollar sign of this that it's easier
to prescribe a drug than to look at the
underlying problem," he said.
Cowell Student Health Center Di
rector Dr. James McClenahan ag
reed. "Sometimes the simplest thing
is to give someone a sleeping pill and
give them a good night's sleep," he
said.
Cowell receives frequent com
plaints of people troubled by insom
nia, said Dorosin, who has practiced
there for 10 years.
"It is the unusual human being,
whether a student or non-student,
who hasn't had insomnia at a period
of emotional stress," he said.
Cowell does not have its own pol
icy on sleeping pills, said McClena
han, but leaves prescriptions to the
discretion of individual physicians.
The weeklong series of lectures
ana seminars also dealt with the
psychology of repeated dreams, the
influence of aspirin on dreams, in
fant deaths during sleep and other
sleep disorders.
