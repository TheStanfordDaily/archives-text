## Album notes 
### 
HUBRIS/RICHARD BEIRACH • ECM
Richie Beirach's first album for
ECM, "Eon," was an impressive
debut performance; but it was not
until I stumbled into Beirach's
group last Spring at New York's
Sweet Basils club that I became fully
aware of this young man's remark
able talent.
At the time I was heading to the
Village Vanguard to hear Zoot Sims
when I noticed Beirach's name on
the marquee.
Beirach's live performances cap
ture the intensity of his music
which his records have not been
able to comunicate. His solos were
all brief, yet played with an aggres
sive fervor. His playing, like that of
most ECM pianists, is orchestral
and full-toned.
His new album from ECM, "Hub
ris," is an extremely listenable ven
ture in solo piano playing, much in
the same vein as the Keith Jarrett
Koln Concert of a couple years
back. The opening "Sunday Song" is
a beautiful hymn of almost childlike
innocence. The following number,
"Leaving," is a bouncy song that oc
casionally dips into a tango rhythm.
The title cut is a waltz which fea
tures some lovely shifting har
monies; Beirach is a master at tak
ing a simple chord sequence and
drastically changing its whole bear
ing with the inclusion of a com
pletely unexpetcted, yet perfectly
logical chord. Thus he can weave in
and out of melodies, often briefly
passing through ideas that could
themselves be material for indi
vidual songs.

Richard Beirach must be consi
dered as one of the premier young
pianists in jazz; certainly in the next
decade he will become widely rec
ognized and known. Already his
work with Dave Liebman, Stan
Getz, Chet Baker and others has
exposed him to a wide variety of the
jazz listening public. Still Beirach
has yet to develop a style which is
uniquely his own; at times one
could mistake him for a young
Chick Coreu or Keith Jarrett. Yet,
without doubt, Beirach seems cap
able of carrying out whatever he
sets his mind on doing. The odds
are his considerable talent will
eventually bring him to new and
unexplored musical areas.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU
ROY HAYNES • GALAXY
During the late '40s and early '50s
Roy Haynes emerged as one of the
foremost bop drummers. Haynes
(known for a while as "Sergeant"
Roy Haynes) played with Charlie
Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell and
other greats of that decade.
Haynes latest release on Galaxy,
"Thank You, Thank You," de
monstrates this new variety in
Haynes playing. The title cut is ex
tremely "funky," as they say in the
vernacular; yet Haynes also dips
into Spanish stylings ("Bullfight")
and straight-ahead jazz ("Quiet
Fire"). Contributions of sidemen
John Klemmer, George Cables and
Bobby Hutcherson are also consid
erable. Klemmer, in particular,
plays with a force which is rare,
much in contrast to his usual lullaby
stylings.

At the time I was heading to the
Village Vanguard to hear Zoot Sims
when I noticed Beirach's name on
the marquee.
Beirach's live performances cap
ture the intensity of his music
which his records have not been
able to comunicate. His solos were
all brief, yet played with an aggres
sive fervor. His playing, like that of
most ECM pianists, is orchestral
and full-toned.
His new album from ECM, "Hub
ris," is an extremely listenable ven
ture in solo piano playing, much in
the same vein as the Keith Jarrett
Koln Concert of a couple years
back. The opening "Sunday Song" is
a beautiful hymn of almost childlike
innocence. The following number,
"Leaving," is a bouncy song that oc
casionally dips into a tango rhythm.
The title cut is a waltz which fea
tures some lovely shifting har
monies; Beirach is a master at tak
ing a simple chord sequence and
drastically changing its whole bear
ing with the inclusion of a com
pletely unexpetcted, yet perfectly
logical chord. Thus he can weave in
and out of melodies, often briefly
passing through ideas that could
themselves be material for indi
vidual songs.

Richard Beirach must be consi
dered as one of the premier young
pianists in jazz; certainly in the next
decade he will become widely rec
ognized and known. Already his
work with Dave Liebman, Stan
Getz, Chet Baker and others has
exposed him to a wide variety of the
jazz listening public. Still Beirach
has yet to develop a style which is
uniquely his own; at times one
could mistake him for a young
Chick Coreu or Keith Jarrett. Yet,
without doubt, Beirach seems cap
able of carrying out whatever he
sets his mind on doing. The odds
are his considerable talent will
eventually bring him to new and
unexplored musical areas.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU
ROY HAYNES • GALAXY
During the late '40s and early '50s
Roy Haynes emerged as one of the
foremost bop drummers. Haynes
(known for a while as "Sergeant"
Roy Haynes) played with Charlie
Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell and
other greats of that decade.
Haynes latest release on Galaxy,
"Thank You, Thank You," de
monstrates this new variety in
Haynes playing. The title cut is ex
tremely "funky," as they say in the
vernacular; yet Haynes also dips
into Spanish stylings ("Bullfight")
and straight-ahead jazz ("Quiet
Fire"). Contributions of sidemen
John Klemmer, George Cables and
Bobby Hutcherson are also consid
erable. Klemmer, in particular,
plays with a force which is rare,
much in contrast to his usual lullaby
stylings.
