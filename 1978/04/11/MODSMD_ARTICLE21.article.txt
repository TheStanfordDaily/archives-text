## More outstanding Horowitz releases 
### 
There is only one pianist
alive today for whom music
lovers would be willing to
stand in line for hours to buy
exhorbitant standing room tic
kets. There is only one pianist
alive who can sell out an entire
audience at ticket prices rang
ing up to $500. His name? Vla
dimir Horowitz.
This year marks the 50th an
niversary of Horowitz's Ameri
can debut at Carnegie Hall. In
celebration, the artist has
made a historic tour of the na
tion including concerts in Car
negie Hall, Los Angeles, San
Francisco as well as a televised
recital from the White House in
Washington. Fortunately for
those of us who could not get

tickets, RCA has recorded the
concerts and has just recently
released them. Thus far, two
recordings have been re
leased, the Rachmaninoff
Piano Concerto N. 3, and the
Liszt Sonata in B Minor. With
luck, more may be coming.
The Rachmaninoff Concerto
as recorded at the Carnegie
Hall concert last January with
the New York Philharmonic
under the baton of Eugene
Ormandy. Such a formidable
meeting of musical genius
makes the record worth buying
by itself. Though in his '90s, Or
mandy still has the energy to
conduct excellently; having
worked with virtually every
notable musician and corn

poser since the beginning of
the century, including
Rachmaninoff himself, he is
quite likely ithe world's
foremost authority on musical
interpretation. (Horowitz also
was a close friend of
Rachmaninoff and makes spe
cial efforts to make the record
ing as true to the composer as
possible.)
There is little doubt that this
recording is a masterpiece. The
music is restless, passionate,
brooding and speaks with
power and authority that only
Horowitz can give it. My only
complaint is that the piano is
perhaps a little overpowering
and tends at times to drown
out the orchestra altogether. I

was also a little disappointed
that a few of the piano passages
were played a little sloppily for
the sake of gaining speed.
The second recording con
tains the Liszt B Minor Sonata,
a Nocturne and Impromptu by
Faure. Horowitz's perfor
mance of the Liszt makes it
quite clear why at the begin
ning of his career he was dub
bed "The Thunderer."
The Sonata is a work of many
and varied contrasts which
Horowitz understands like few
other pianists. The outbursts of
violence juxtaposed with the
milder passages leave one feel
ing slightly uneasy. The Sonata
leaves the same way it came in:
asking a question. It is

nevertheless an experience to
hear the Sonata interpreted by
a pianist whose technical
command of the piano ap
proaches that of Liszt himself.
A pleasant little set of pieces by
Faure follows to reassure us
that Horowitz hasn't made
kindling out of his Steinway
from the Sonata. I find myself
somewhat less enthusiastic
about this recording than the
Rachmaninoff.
I would highly recommend
both of these records even if
for purely sentimental reasons.
Horowitz, even at age 73, still
stands out as a giant among
pianists of this or of any other
age.
