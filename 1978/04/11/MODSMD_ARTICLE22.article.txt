## Fashion photography's avant-garde 
### 
After strolling past nearly 150 shots in
"The History of Fashion Photography,"
the viewer may remember little about
the couture itself. This only testifies to
the success of the exhibition, now at
the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art. One of its stated objectives is, in
fact, "to prove . . . that a great fashion
photograph is more than great fashion
and no less than great photography."
The show's title is perhaps mislead
ing; it is not, nor should it be, a com
plete "history." The viewer does not
get even a feeling for the full range of
styles in fashion photography. The ar
tists on exhibit were the avant-garde
from London, Paris and New York.
Many were not giants in fashion but
well-known only in other aspects of
photography and design. Even Salvador
Dali referred to his paintings as
"hand-painted dream photographs."
He also designed jewelry, and one of
his photographic compositions for
Vogue is in the show.
All of the featured artists were, in the
view of this exhibition, trend-setters.
And the limitations of this show as a
"history" are in part justified by this
focus on the artistic evolution of
photography itself. Fashion advertise
ment was merely one vehicle toward
this end, but it made its own peculiar
contributions, that are highlighted by
this show.
While we take photography for
granted as the classic medium of adver
tising, the exhibition points out that it is
inherently a more potent selling device
than drawings or sketches, for in
stance. Ads commonly try to convince
us that certain articles will transform us
into desirable likenesses of the models.
No matter how contrived we know they
may be, photographs show that these
images are "real," so that we can most
easily make the psychological connec
tion with our own reality.
Because of its very nature as advertis
ing, fashion photography motivated
innovation in eye-catching techniques.
The show highlights these in
chronological order. While this organi
zation is effective, the placement of the
photographs on opposite walls causes
the viewer some initial confusion and a
lot of back-and-forth movement to take
full advantage of the chronological de
velopment.
From its origins in the 1860s through
the turn of the century, models posed
in the traditional postures of charm and
wealth. The richness of high society
made up the attractive images of poise
and breeding. The work of Baron von
Mayer, in the early 20s, heightened

romantic elegance. He developed the
snob appeal of high fashion with his
extravagant settings and shimmering or
luminescent lighting techniques.
Grand pianos
Edward Steichen's influence took
over later in the 20s, with a very diffe
rent tone. His compositions extended
beyond fashion itself toward a more
thematic emphasis. His works merged
fashion with its settings. Examples are
his shot of an Art Deco gown that seems
continuous with its own art deco
backdrop, and "Black," which uses a
pair of grand pianos to accentuate a
duo of black gowns.
A more natural strain was achieved by
George Hoyningen-Huene who broke
through contrived, static settings to
show models as real, smiling people.
This was appropriate to his work with
sportswear.
Techniques had long been eye
catching in the sense that they were
attractive. But from the 30s onward,
with the exception of the wartime
period, the offbeat and the unnatural
dominated high fashion photography.
Experimentation then became more
possible and desirable.
In the 30s Cecil Beaton and Horst P.
Horst were masters of the unlikely in
composition and setting. Horst's "In
the News Today" finds an impeccably
suited woman reading a newspaper but
surrounded by a dirty construction site
— refinement in the midst of disorder.
Surrealism
Realism and surrealism coexisted in
the 30s and 40s. Surrealism provided
bizarre appeal in fashion and allowed
for much conceptual and technical ex
perimentation. Man Ray portrays a new
fashion "coming over" the short waves.
The work, in black and white, gives the
effect of the "new line" in fasion with
out the detail of the fashion itself, as it is
transmitted from Paris to New York.
Among Erwin Blumenfeld's most effec
tive experimentation was his work with
negatives.
In contrast, Martin Munkacsi and
Herman Landshoff placed models in
more real-life, though frequently un
usual, situations. With the blurred
motion style, their "snapshot realism"
rivalled studio work for the first time.
With World War 11, the work of
Louise Dahl-Wolfe and John Rawlings
reflected the most documentary ap
proach yet. Fashion pnotography was
downplayed, however, since its
"frivolousness" did not match the gen
eral demoralization of the time. Fash
ions and the roles of women are re
vealed as functional, even drab, as

compared to earlier works.
In the 50s and 60s graphic experimen
tation and glamor were again in Vogue
(and in Harper's Bazarr). New prosper
ity inflated advertising budgets, and
New York became the fashion capital of
the world. Richard Avedon's sexual ap
proach, Irving Penn's dramatic sophis
tication and Hiro's experimentation are
prominent in the exhibition.
Photography of the 70s, represented
by Guy Bourdin, Helmut Newton,
Sarah Moon and Deborah Turbeville is
the most psychologically disturbing
work in this show. All except Sarah
Moon depersonalize the models within
strange, isolated, or threatening envi
ronments. One wishes the exhibition
had explored further the artistic moti
vations behind these fashion shots as
obvious cultural statements.
In one sense, each fashion photo
graph places the human expression of
clothing into a whole artistic context —
through setting, lighting, pose and

facial expression, etc. For those in
terested in the artistic angle that the
show professes, comments on a sub
stantial number of individual shots
would have been educational and en
joyable.
The social and cultural implications
of these images are also important but
unfortunately neglected. Advertising
could be considered a popular art form,
yet this photography was as elite as high
fashion itself in its appeal.
The art of haute couture is nonethe
less satisfying, and the exhibition is val
uable to all those interested in fashion
or in the little-known ventures into
fashion advertising of some of the
foremost photogaraphers and desig
ners of the past century.
Organized by Nancy Hall-Duncan for
the International Museum of Photo
graphy at George Eastmas House, the
show will remain at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art through April
16th.
