## Erratic, but good 
### 
The present Theatreworks' produc
tion of "The Goodbye People" at the
Palo Alto Community Theatre is an in
teresting mixture. This playful comedy,
written by Herb Gardner, portrays the
last days of Max Silverman, as he
reopens his Coney Island Hot Dog
stand after 22 of "renovation."
While continually cracking Jewish-style
witticisms, Max infects his lonely
daughter and a neurotic jinglebell de
signer with that terminal enthusiasm
that comes through a positive belief in
something. In this case, the "some
thing" involves the transformation of a
dilapidated shcack into the brightly
decorated Max's Hawaiian Ecstasies.
When taken together, the pros of this
show outweigh the negative points. For
example, the set, which is a amazing
collection of docklike pillars, shack,
pier and sandbox, gives the actors ob
vious difficulties as they trudge through
the sand. Another example is the excel
lent lighting concept of )ohn Rathman,
which is effectively destroyed by poor
operation and flickering of nearly
exhausted bulbs. And while the cos
tumes and makeup are both fine, the
set changes (or additions as it were) in
the last half by the cast themselves are
much too complicated to be done in
stantly in near-total darkness.

As any community-type production
necessarily draws from the small group
of iocal performers, it is seldom that
one can applaud casting in the
stereotypical sense. In this one produc
tion it is possible to do so, in that every
player conforms physically to the pre
conceptions of his or her role. Individu
ally the cast of six are each one a per
former verifiably believeable in man
ner, accent and style. But putting them
together greatly reduces their qualities
as they jump each others' lines and fail
to draw any support from each other.
Even so, the funny dialogue comes ac
ross very well vocally; this must be the
most well-defined aural production I've
seen. Especially amusing are Bernard
Hern as Max Silverman and Lee Carrau
as Max's ex-partner Marcus Soloway. It
is certainly possible to agree with the
line of the latter, when he states that he
does a great old man.
Audience reaction to the perfor
mance I saw was as varied as my own
views. Although there was a great deal
of criticism at the intermission and
some snores audible during the second
act, the cast received much laughter
and two curtain calU at the end.
Performances of "The Coodby
People" will be shown on April 13, 14,
15, 20, 21 and 22 at 8:30 p.m.
