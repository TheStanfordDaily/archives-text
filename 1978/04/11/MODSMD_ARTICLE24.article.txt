Long Beach Naval Hospital yesterday for treatment of
what doctors described as a "problem with medica
tion."
Ford, 60, who has suffered for several years from ar

needed the tapes of the 40-hour Shamshak interrogation
to properly represent his client.
Negotiations slated on killer satellites
Washington — Taking a major step on arms control,
the Carter administration disclosed yesterday oncoming
negotiations with the Soviet Union to ban hunter-killer
satellites in space and to limit sales of weapons through
out the world.
The administration's moves, which parallel a renewed
drive for a U.S.-Soviet treaty to limit offensive nuclear
weapons, follow a blistering attack by Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev, who suggested President jimmy Car
ter was giving ground to hard-liners at home.
Military retirement changes urged
Washington — A presidential commission yesterday
urged an end to 20-year retirements and "double
dipping" for the next generation of military personnel.
President jimmy Carter received the report saying he
agrees that there are "serious defects" in the military
retirement system. He said he would try to send a bill to
Congress by January to correct them.

Compensation urged a new system of old-age pensions
and deferred pay to replace the present military retire
ment system.
Refugees return to south Lebanon

mass repatriation of refugees to south Lebanon will

Israel's real intentions on how serious the withdrawal
will be," official Lebanese radio said yesterday.
Moro 'message' received
Rome — Italian newspapers yesterday received an ap
parently authentic message from kidnapped former
Premier Aldo Moro calling on authorities again to trade
jailed terrorists for his freedom.

West Germany could be behind the government's tough
"no deal" stance.
Cuts in ship building urged
Washington — Defense Secretary Harold Brown called
on a House seapower subcommittee yesterday to en
dorse President Jimmy Carter's scaled-down, five-year
shipbuilding program and to defer."grandiose plans and
impressive promises."
Brown said a more ambitious plan than the proposal to
build and convert 83 ships at a cost of $32 billion cannot
be justified now because of uncertainties and problems
concerning rapidly advancing technology and costs.

critically wounded while filming a movie on the Mojave
Desert as a university class project, authorities reported

Testimony given in Van Houten trial

black, came back to testify yesterday about the terrifying
summer of 1969 when Charles Manson's thirst for mur
der could not be quenched.
Kasabian, who was granted immunity from prosecu
tion for her role in the notorious Sharon Tate-Laßianca
murders, took the stand in Leslie Van Houten's third
murder trial and at first pleaded a poor memory of the
violence of nine years ago.
But under additional questioning by Deputy District
Attorney Stephen Kay, she poured out the story once
more of life with Manson, embellishing it with new de
tails which might help incriminate Van Houten.
