The Elections Review Board (ERB) report on the fall
ASSU senate race will not be ready until after the upcom
ing Council of Presidents election, according to ERB
member Deric Jennings.
The report will contain the results of the ERB investiga
tion of the alleged "campaign irregularities" in the fall
senate election.
The ERB report was originally scheduled to be com
pleted fall quarter but delays in preparation of the com
mittee's minutes and the size of the task have held the
report back, according to Jennings. The report will be 50
pages or more, he said.
"With another two weeks of work we could have a
good report rather than a mess," Jennings added. "It will
be a good report when it comes out."
Jennings and Dorothy Parrish, another committee

member, both said that no one person on the committee
has been responsible for the delay.
Jennings said he received the four rough draft sec
tions of the report, written by each of the four other
members of the ERB, during dead week of winter quar
ter. Jennings said he was to do the final editing and
compile the report.
However, the four parts of the report "didn't fit to
gether very well," according to Jennings. He said he is
discussing corrections with the other ERB members.
The ASSU elections commission budget is paying for
costs incurred compiling the report according to Elec
tions Commissioner Sean Murphy.
"The report should cost about $400, but it could run
higher," he said. "$240 has already been spent for prep
aration of the committee meeting minutes."
Murphy said ERB members have not been paid.
