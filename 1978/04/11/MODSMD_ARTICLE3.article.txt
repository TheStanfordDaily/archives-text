Stanford Trustee Armin Rosen
cranz called the latest Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR)
study a "great report" yesterday at a
taped session of Campus Confer
ence.
The CIR report to the trustees re
commended a halt to expansion of
U.S. corporations in South Africa and
supported corporate withdrawal.
Rosencranz said he based his
statement on his reading of the CIR
article in the Daily. He said he has not
seen the actual report.
Rosencranz and trustee Stender
Sweeney will both be guests on to
night's Campus Conference.
Sweeney said he has not had a
chance yet to see or read about the
report.

After the controversy surrounding
the ClR's formation, Rosencranz said
the "board is under obligation to
consider the report very seriously
and give it every benefit of a doubt."
Sweeney agreed that similar re
ports to the board in the past have
been well received.
Turning to President Richard Ly
man's method of appointing stu
dents to the CIR, Sweeney said he
felt Lyman had no other choice after
the ASSU failed to participate in the
selection process.
On the subject of sororities,
Sweeney said he did not have a
"strong reaction one way or the
other" about recent sorority activity
and the upcoming rush.
"Our biggest worry was the threat
of national sororities imposing on

groups here, but that does not seem
to be in the cards." He said he sup
ported sororities in the trustee vote.
"Selective selection has no place
in the University," said Rosencranz,
who voted against the return of
sororities to campus. Rosencranz
said thdt if a discrepancy existed be
tween the rights allowed men and
women, he thought the solution was
to phase out fraternities.
Turning to the discrepancies in fa
culty and staff pay, Rosencranz said
he felt the salaries of junior faculty
and junior staff are much too low.
Sweeney disagreed, saying the dif
ferences provide incentive. He said
that if the salaries were not "good
enough" to maintain the high level of
education, the salaries would in
crease.
