### Andrea James 
A Stanford Hospital employee and
ex-employee have filed a $1.2 million
damage suit against three Hospital
facilities administrators who al
legedly "conspired" to use Hospital
materials and labor for their own be
nefit.
The two plaintiffs also ask another
$1.2 million in damages from the
University and one administrator col
lectively because the University al
legedly confirmed and ratified the
administrators' "wanton and reck
less" actions.
Frank Petta, who served as the
Hospital's chief engineer from Au
gust 1976 until his alleged forced res
ignation in January 1978, and General
Foreman Conroe McGee, claim the
three Hospital administrators
"knowingly and willfully conspired"
to divert materials and laborfrom the
Hospital's construction projects "for
their individual and mutual use and
benefit."
They also claim the three named
defendents assisted each other "in
obtaining positions of higher author
ity" within the Hospital.
The three administrators named in
the Santa Clara County Superior
Court suit are James McNally, direc
tor of facilities; William Ferguson,
chief engineer; and David Domin

guez, general foreman. Twenty John
Does are also named as defendants.
Hospital officials denied that the
Hospital acted improperly in dealing
with McNally's personnel actions
concerning McGee and Petta, ac
cording to Spyros Andreopoulos of
the Medical Center News Bureau.
The News Bureau also stated Mc-
Nally, Ferguson and Dominguez
have denied charges of w.rongdoing.
McGee claims he "suffered
humiliation, mental anguish and
emotional and physical distress" be
cause McNally, who several times
requested a voluntary demotion,
"withdrew all practical authority
from McGee in violation of person
nel rules and procedures" estab

lished by the Hospital.
Defendants allegedly attempted to
cause McGee's resignation "through
the use of threats, intimidation and
harrassment."
Petta also claims he suffered
humiliation, mental anguish and
emotional and physical distress at
the hands of McNally because he
signed a resignation under duress.
Besides claiming the three named
defendents diverted materials and
labor from the University, Petta and
McGee say they also attempted to
"remove other employees . . . who
did not cooperate in said conspiracy
or who impeded the purposes of the
conspiracy."
