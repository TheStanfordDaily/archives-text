Willingness to work hard

with the University bureaucracy, a
knowledge of issues that deeply af
fect students and a willingness to
work hard."

needs, and to make sure that the
COP continues the good things it is
presently doing.
Docters, who ran for COP last
year, said this time he is a serious
contender and that last year his pur
pose in running was to get publicity
for his ASSU senate race.
Docters said one of the main goals

prove teaching here. He also said
that "COP decisions should be con
sidered from a number of points of
view."

with the University bureaucracy, a
knowledge of issues that deeply af
fect students and a willingness to
work hard."

represent one ideology group or
point of view. Their elections mate

matism with idealism in dealing with
the issues they will confront if
elected to the COP.

sidered from a number of points of
view."
