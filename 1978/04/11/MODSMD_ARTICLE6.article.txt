# Richter after Nobel Prize
## Stanford prof reviews work

Man is an eternal tinkerer.
Put on this planet by some unknown force or infi
nitely complicated process, he has since struggled to
discover how everything works. It's an eternal ques
tion with, as yet, no eternal answer.
Yet he continues to search. One of these searchers
is Burton Richter, director of the Stanford Positron-
Electron Asymmetric Ring (SPEAR), part of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center.
Richter shared a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1976 for
discovering a new sub-atomic particle, the psi-J parti
cle. At the same time the particle was discovered at
SLAC by Richter, it was observed by Samuel C.C. Ting
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Brookhaven National Laboratory.Richter said the
existence of the particle is well substantiated now.
"I've kind of lost interest in that," he said. "There's
a large number of detail questions. The very detailed
studies never interested me a lot. I guess everybody
likes to blaze new trails."
Although he's no longer directly involved with the
psi-J particle, the path to the Nobel Prize was a dif
ficult one. Richter had trouble getting funding to
construct the SPEAR ring, which was central to his
experiment.
"Most people didn't believe in electron-positron
storage rings," Richter said. "They were not very
popular."
The storage ring produces sub-atomic particles by
having two beams, one a positron beam and one an
electron beam, circle in opposite directions and col
lide, Richter explained.
Bill Kirk, editor of the SLAC Beam Line, the facility's
newsletter, said Richter couldn't get funding for the

SPEAR ring until SLAC's director gave him money
earmarked for something else.
"He worked his ass off for five years," Kirk said.
"The electron-positron ring is a clear window into the
unknown."
All the time Richter's search for funding was going
on, he knew what type of sub-atomic particle he was
looking for, Kirk said.
Richter wasn't bothered by the same discovery
being made simultaneously elsewhere.
"I was too euphoric to be disconcerted," he said.
"It's not often an experiment comes up with some
thing completely new. It was an answer to a question
asked. We expected a particle at that energy level."
But the properties of the particle, including its
mass, were totally unexpected.
"It was an unusually heavy normal kind of parti
cle," Richter said. "The new one made it all so won
derful."
This particle helped substantiate the earlier quark
theory, W.K.H. Panofsky, SLAC's director, said. This
theory holds that all matter is composed of three
quarks.
Yet while Richter's discovery substantiated the
quark theory, it also said there has to be at least four
quarks and perhaps more, Panofsky said.
Thus, while proving the quark theory, Richter also
weakened the view that three quarks form the fun
damental particle of nature.
The elusiveness of this fundamental particle could
be frustrating, yet Richter said the frustration is eased
because you know your answer will probably be
wrong. But that answer will have some value, he said.


Nobel prize winner, Burton Richter, a Stanford profes
sor, was honored in 1976 for his discovery of a new
sub-atomic particle. He is director of the Stanford

Positron-Electron Asymmetric Ring at SLAC. Richter is
also involved in furtner experimental efforts as a new
storage ring begins operation.
