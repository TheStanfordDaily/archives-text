## Stanford, Harvard compared Role of education needs review 
### 
Allan Chen

Education in America is once again
in a state of turmoil. At the pre
college level, we are informed of rais
ing drop-out and crime rates, illiter
acy and absenteeism. In higher edu
cation, students are going through
four years without ever studying sci
ence in some cases, or the
humanities or social sciences in
others. Some entering students
don't know how to write; some are
substandard readers.
The glut of graduate students has

lowered the quality and prestige of
the Ph.D., especially in the
humanities and social sciences.
Educators warn that if present trends
go unchecked, American citizens
will not have a knowledge of their
cultural heritage, or the ability to
think and decide for themselves.
It happened before, only it wasn't
so serious. In October of 1957, the
Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, a
technological feat which would have
vast consequences for American

education.
Worries that we would fall behind
in technological capabilities promp
ted educators to restructure the
pre-college science and math cur
ricula. Innovation and experimen
tation became the rule.
During the 60s, most requirements
were dropped by college adminis
trators under siege. Now, more than
20 years after the first wave of panic,
we are feeling the effects of a hasty,
poorly thought out mad dash at re
form.
Prestige lost
The educational establishment has
fallen into such straits that it may
never fully recover the prestige it
once had. The pessimists among us
believe it will never recover at all, it
will merely hasten the end of civiliza
tion which will surely come in a fall of
ICBM's or the final anarchic roits of
an energy and resource-depleted
world. That such an educational de
cline might contribute to the end is
inarguable.
The more puzzling question, is
how may we reform the educational
enterprise quickly enough to ensure
that educated people will be there to
help resolve other crises that will cer
tainly come?
One small part of the answer lies
with the universities in the so-called
general education concept. Distribu
tion requirements are supposed to
expose students to a broad cross
section of knowledge, in the hope
that they will get a common
background in culture, the sciences,
the arts, and in the hope that they will
extract the ways of thinking peculiar
to these disciplines.
A sound justification for this is that
we will need some small familiarity
with all of knowledge to be able to
deal with the techno-social problems
of the world.
Programs redirected
To this end, colleges all across the
country have been reevaluating their
distribution requirements (or lack
thereof). Institutions who are trying
to redirect their programs have
seized on such catch-alls as 'cohe
siveness,' 'integration of know
ledge,' 'core curriculum,' etc. (What
ever happened to 'relevance'?)
Harvard, traditionally the pace
setter, is totally redesigning and
strengthening its requirements to
place more emphasis on imparting
an appreciation for the broad view of
knowledge, the transdisciplinary na
ture of knowledge, and the ways of
thinking. They hope to do this by de
signating a core curriculum which
embodies all of these principles.
There are several problems with
this kind of approach. Requirements
are static, and they can't always
change fast enough to adjust to a
changing intellectual environment
where different ways of thinking
quickly lose and gain importance.
It is difficult, if not impossible, to
communicate the trans-disciplinary
features of knowledge within the
framework of discipline-oriented
courses. Overly restrictive require
ments discourage independent and
creative exploration.
Stanford compared
Nonetheless, Harvard's approach
to reforming general education has
merits, the most important of which
is its holistic, transdisciplinary view.
It is instructive to compare this ap
proach to Stanford's. Our curricular
reform attempts are embodied in the
Western Culture requirement which

seeks to add to, not modify under
graduate education. This is like try
ing to repair a dilapidated, run-down
house by adding a new room.
While Harvard's approach is
fraught with dangers from the tunnel
vision of academic dogma, it is far
healthier than Stanford's. General
education here definitely needs re
structuring both for cohesiveness
and relevance. We should not view
education through the filter of West
ern Culture alone.
It is time for another study of
education at Stanford. We have an ob
ligation to once again reevaluate the
total educational program here, and
the approach to this must seek a re
definition of the role of education in
society.
It must ask how best to teach stu
dents to think for themselves, and it
must avoid the hasty reforms charac
teristic of the 60s. Above all, it must
determine how best to prepare us to
deal with the techono-social prob
lems of the coming decades.
