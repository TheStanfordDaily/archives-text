SCRIP effective
I'm glad to see that the Daily finally
supports the withdrawal of U.S. cor
porations from South Africa. It's nice
to know that SCRIP is having an effect
on campus.

Merely recognition
I was very disturbed to read about
the termination of Androgyny House
after this year. In two-thirds of a year
the kinds of goals and commitments
which Androgyny House was
founded on can not possibly be
realized in full.
The fact that sex roles and
feminism are not strictly academic
areas of pursuit is something which
makes the house so valuable, and
vital to this community, whose
perspective is too severely confined
to "academic content." '
Was Androgyny House merely in
tended as a symbol of Stanford's
1977-78 recognition of the crucial and
long-term questions related to
feminism — approved in the spirit of
it being a project for Stanford's "Year
for Feminism" — and not meant to
continue after the end of the
academic year in June?

Placing blame hard
I deplore the loss of life in Lebanon
no less than Rachelle Marshall does
(Daily, April 4), but find it much har
der than she does to blame Israel for
having to defend its sovereignty and
citizenry.
After the Entebbe rescue, an article
of hers was headed "Israeli raid no
solution," (Daily, July 9, 1976). Tell
that to the lews of various

nationalities who were separated out
at Entebbe and told they'd be killed.
What's particularly irresponsible is
to brandish the Holocaust by brac
keting Israel's attack on terrorist
bases with Nazism's massacre of mill
ions throughout Europe. Far from re
calling Hitler's victims justly or com
passionately, such a misleading
comparison only exploits them.
What's more, to equate the PLO
with Irgun's 1940's campaign wholly
ignores historical distinctions; and
Irgun did not attack civilians, but
warned them before an operation.
That PLO terrorism has killed 1131
people and injured 2471 in the last
ten years should also interest us.
The PLO revealed a crucial discre
pancy between ideals and practice
when they reported this recent kil
ling to their own people (and in Rus
sia) as a guerrilla skirmish against Is
raeli soldiers. While I was in Israel in
1975, a PLO rocket landed one night
in a field next to my residential
district apartment. The PLO report
was of severe structural damage to
the Knesset.
If one is indignant about killing
and the withholding of political rec
ognition, one should direct his or her
indignation towards the PLO and
those who abet it.
What would one write to the Daily
after half one's family had been
wiped out by terrorists blowing up a
Palo Alto school bus — terrorists in
filtrating from . . . well, from where?
We in this country can't imagine such
an invasion of U.S. sovereignty, and
that's part of the problem.

ions throughout Europe. Far from re
calling Hitler's victims justly or com
passionately, such a misleading
comparison only exploits them.
What's more, to equate the PLO
with Irgun's 1940's campaign wholly
ignores historical distinctions; and
Irgun did not attack civilians, but
warned them before an operation.
That PLO terrorism has killed 1131
people and injured 2471 in the last
ten years should also interest us.
The PLO revealed a crucial discre
pancy between ideals and practice
when they reported this recent kil
ling to their own people (and in Rus
sia) as a guerrilla skirmish against Is
raeli soldiers. While I was in Israel in
1975, a PLO rocket landed one night
in a field next to my residential
district apartment. The PLO report
was of severe structural damage to
the Knesset.
If one is indignant about killing
and the withholding of political rec
ognition, one should direct his or her
indignation towards the PLO and
those who abet it.
What would one write to the Daily
after half one's family had been
wiped out by terrorists blowing up a
Palo Alto school bus — terrorists in
filtrating from . . . well, from where?
We in this country can't imagine such
an invasion of U.S. sovereignty, and
that's part of the problem.

SCRIP effective
I'm glad to see that the Daily finally
supports the withdrawal of U.S. cor
porations from South Africa. It's nice
to know that SCRIP is having an effect
on campus.

Merely recognition
I was very disturbed to read about
the termination of Androgyny House
after this year. In two-thirds of a year
the kinds of goals and commitments
which Androgyny House was
founded on can not possibly be
realized in full.
The fact that sex roles and
feminism are not strictly academic
areas of pursuit is something which
makes the house so valuable, and
vital to this community, whose
perspective is too severely confined
to "academic content." '
Was Androgyny House merely in
tended as a symbol of Stanford's
1977-78 recognition of the crucial and
long-term questions related to
feminism — approved in the spirit of
it being a project for Stanford's "Year
for Feminism" — and not meant to
continue after the end of the
academic year in June?

Placing blame hard
I deplore the loss of life in Lebanon
no less than Rachelle Marshall does
(Daily, April 4), but find it much har
der than she does to blame Israel for
having to defend its sovereignty and
citizenry.
After the Entebbe rescue, an article
of hers was headed "Israeli raid no
solution," (Daily, July 9, 1976). Tell
that to the lews of various

nationalities who were separated out
at Entebbe and told they'd be killed.
What's particularly irresponsible is
to brandish the Holocaust by brac
keting Israel's attack on terrorist
bases with Nazism's massacre of mill
ions throughout Europe. Far from re
calling Hitler's victims justly or com
passionately, such a misleading
comparison only exploits them.
What's more, to equate the PLO
with Irgun's 1940's campaign wholly
ignores historical distinctions; and
