INNOVATIVE USES OF LANGUAGE:
CASE STUDY OF A GORILLA.
q During her 5 1 /2 years of exposure to language, Koko (a 6V2 year old female lowland !
j gorilla) has used sign language in a number of interesting and innovative ways. She |
has created as well as learned signs, names, and linguistic stategies. These
1 innovations appear to be the product of several factors including Koko's biological fl
Q heritage as a gorilla, her cognitive abilities, and the structure and functioning of sign g
as a visual language.
