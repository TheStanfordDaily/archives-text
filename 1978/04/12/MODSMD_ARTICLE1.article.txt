# Trustees agree
## Freeze on U.S. investments 
### Mike Charlson 
The University Board of Trustees
went on the record as opposed to
corporate expansion by U.S. firms in
South Africa as it acted on various
corporate proxy resolutions at yes
terday's meeting.
The board also stated an opposi
tion to additional loans from Ameri
can firms to the South African gov
ernment or its agencies.
The board voted 15 to 8, with one
abstention, to vote yes on proxies
coming before Union Carbide and
U.S. Steel which would prohibit ex
pansion of investment in South Af
rica until racist policies of apartheid
are ended, according to Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for pub
lic affairs.
The vote affirmed a recommenda
tion from the Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR) to halt ex
pansion in South Africa.
Bank of America referendum
In a separate proxy proposal, the
board voted 13 to 8 to abstain on a
Bank of America referendum which
would prohibit new loans or renewal
of loans to the South African gov
ernment or "any companies," mean
ing private corporations, doing busi
ness there.
But along with the abstention, the
board will issue a letter to the bank
urging it to adopt a policy of extend
ing no new loans to the South African

government or its agencies.
According to President Richard
Lyman, the trustees opposed the
Bank of America proxy because it af
fected the private as well as the pub
lic sector.
Lyman said he voted against the
abstention and said he and most of
the eight others who opposed the
board's decision would have voted
to support the proxy resolution as
stated.

The CIR recommendation had
been to vote in favor of the resolu
tion, but last night CIR Chairman
Frederick Hillier said the board ac
tion was "not inconsistent with the
CIR recommendation."
According to Hillier, the CIR had
considered only a preliminary proxy
proposal from Bank of America. In
that proposal, only loans made to the
South African government would
have been prohibited. The final
proxy proposal also includes loans to
private corporations dealing in that
country.
Reaction to the board action was
swift and generally favorable. Hillier
said he was "very pleased. I think
(the trustee's decision) in regard to
voting in favor of shareholder prop
osals against corporate expansion in
South Africa is very significant."

Because many of the trustees are
tied to the business community, Hill
ier said he viewed the action as
"courageous and positive."
The Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP)
also indicated pleasure with the trus
tee actions on the nonexpansion
proxies, but the group attacked the
board for its vote on the Bank of
America issue.
"We are really appalled that they
(the trustees) decided not to vote yes
because loans to both the public and
private sector are equally important
in the support of apartheid," said
SCRIP spokesperson Charlie Hus
kins.
Both Hillier and Huskins expres
sed "disappointment" that the trus
tees did not issue a position state
ment on withdrawal of corporations
from South Africa. No withdrawal
mandating proxies came before the
board at the meeting because CIR
has yet to deal with them.
But CIR did say in its report issued
last Friday that it generally favored
withdrawal from South Africa with a
few exceptions, and Hillier said he
anticipated a CIR recommendation
to vote yes on proxies calling for
withdrawal coming soon before an
nual meetings of Texaco, Motorola
and Phelps Dodge.


Approximately 25 SCRIP members picketed the Board of
Trustees monthly meeting yesterday in San Francisco, hop
ing to move the trustees toward divestment. Also protested
was the Bank of America's refusal to discontinue loans to

South Africa, in the face of the apartheid government there.
Rhyming chants occupied the protestors through their pic
