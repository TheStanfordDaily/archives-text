"What Is Black Liberation? Where
Do We Co From Here?"
This was the central theme of the
Black Liberation Month Symposium
which last month called for re
sponses by prominent figures in to
day's black struggle.
The symposium, the major event
of Black Liberation Month, was an
attempt to stimulate intellectual de
bate on "What Is Black Liberation."
The program was designed to bring a
wide range of viewpoints about cur
rent politics to the Stanford com
munity.
To provide this wide spectrum of
thought, the Stanford community
called upon James Turner, James
Boggs, Ed Boston and Margaret Bush
Wilson.
Turner is head of the Africana Re
search Center at Cornell University.
He headed the North American de
legation to the 6th Pan African Con
gress held in Tanzania, holds a lead

ership position in the African Herit
age Assoc. , and is known to be a
scholar-activist.
Boggs is an auto worker in Detroit
and is known for his political work
among auto workers and laborers.
He is also noted for his books "The
American Revolution," published in
1963, and "Racism and Class Strug
gle" (1968).
Boston is an organizer for the All
African People's Revolutionary Party
(AAPRP) which is an international
Pan-Africanist organization headed
by Stokely Carmichael.
Prospects for nationalism
Turner focused on prospects for
black nationalism. He stated that
"nationalism" is a concept to which
black leaders must give serious con
sideration. He views race (as op
posed to class) as being the most crit
ical issue in planning the direction of
strategies for black struggle.
Blacks must have a clear concept of
self and group identity if they are
truly to understand why they should
struggle, and for what they are
struggling. Living in an oppressive
system, blacks have internalized the
negative attitudes of the larger soci
ety towards them as their own.
By forcing a people to internalize
the attitudes, they are also forced to
then use them as a basis for defining
and developing their ideas of self im
age. Turner feels that blacks must
develop positive self concepts.
He stated that they should seek to
become aware of the elements
which, to a great extent, cause
similarities among all blacks no mat
ter where they are located. He also
said that blacks should seriously
consider making Africa the geog
raphical location to invest their pat
riotism.
Turner addressed the necessity for
ending the capitalistic economic sys
tem which causes world wide op
pression and stressed the need to
study black history and the teachings
of black leaders, such as Malcolm X.
Nature of black struggle
Boggs addressed some important
concepts that black leaders have
tended to overlook in developing
their ideologies and strategies for the
black struggle. He began by saying,
"I did not come here to comfort you
or make you happy because these
are not happy times."
Boggs elaborated on the nature of
the black struggle in this country.
Black struggle has historically raised
the human question: whether any
group has the right to oppress and
exploit another group? But as the
struggle advanced, blacks turned

toward having immediate, specific
issues dealt with (segregation, edu
cation, housing, etc.).
Once many of these concessions
were made blacks were faced with
the decision as to what was the next
step.
Boggs pointed out that at that time
patient ideological planning should
have taken place, but instead blacks
became fragmented, many groups
formed and went off in separate di
rections. Boggs attributes the chaos
of the black struggle today to this
fragmentation.
African state formation
Boston centered his discussion on
the formation of an African state. He
stressed the importance of establish
ing a sound economic base which
would allow the African people to
pool their own resources and there
fore create a somewhat independent
state which could be less vulnerable
to exploitation.
Boston expressed an awareness
that in order for the unified state to
be established blacks would have to
work out the internal conflicts bet
ween the different groups which
compose all African people. He also
stressed that an objective of the
AAPRP is to free the states in Africa
that are currently under foreign rule,

such as Azania (South Africa) and
Zimbabwe (Rhodesia), as well as
those African states in which African
people are struggling under dictator
ships for control of their social, polit
ical, and economic destiny.
Boggs commented during the
symposium that "Blacks are waiting
for another king, Malcolm X, a mes
siah to guide them away from their
troubles."
Well, if the black struggle is to ad
vance to any significant stage, the fu
ture leadership must not be one man
but must be many men and women
who are willing to do the patient
ideological planning so desperately
needed.
The Black Liberation Month Steer
ing Committee doesn't expect the
symposium to create a singular road
to black liberation. Nor can we ex
pect that this symposium will answer
all questions.
We do know that at this critical
period of black history and black
struggle, we must debate, question,
and critically analyze the various
strategies for and even the very de
finitions and goals of black libera
tion.
