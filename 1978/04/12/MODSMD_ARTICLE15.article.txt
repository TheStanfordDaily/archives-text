# Photo club meets Ansel Adams
## 
### 
Fifteen members of the Stanford Photo Club
traveled to Monterey and Carmel last Saturday.
The highlight of the trip was a two-hour visit
with master photographer Ansel Adams. After a
two-hour car ride from campus, the group first
gathered at Point Lobos Reserve, along the
south shore of Carmel Bay.
following an all-too-brief stay at Point Lobos,
the group traveled into Carmel for lunch, a tour
of the "Friends of Photography" gallery, and a
chance to snap photos of the people and places
of the Pebble Beach vicinity.
At 5 p.m. the expedition arrived at the
doorstep of Adams' home, which sits atop a
wooded hill overlooking the ocean, roaring
against the rocks below.
A friendly and enthusiastic Adams welcomed

all of us into his home; and we were soon sitting
comfortably with him in his living room, over
looking the Pacific. He was eager to answer all
of our questions, displaying a complete techni
cal mastery as well as a unique aesthetic insight
in his field. The visit included a tour of his dar
kroom, with its impressive array of equipment
especially adapted to Adams' own refined and
personal printing style.
Adams is a warm-hearted individual, exhibit
ing a kind of benevolent patience that is also
reflected in his photographs. After two hours of
talking with this grand old master, seeing his
photographs and touring his darkroom, our visit
was over. It was an opportunity few people
could turn down, certainly none with anv in
terest or appreciation of photography at its best.
