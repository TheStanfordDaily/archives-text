# Growth fighters battle elitist image
## 
### Jill Stewart 
Its board of directors reads
like a "Who's Who on the
Peninsula," and critics have re
ferred to its members as the
ones with diamonds on their
fingers, but the Committee for
Creen Foothills is a group of
hard-hitting environmentalists
who do not think of them
selves as elitists.
They think of themselves as
hard workers.
Creen Foothills was formed
in 1962 when a handful of
Menlo Park and Palo Alto area
residents combined forces to
combat a planned develop
ment of high rises and a shop
ping center in the foothills be
hind the University.
"There were 28 of us hand
picked people, and we knew
we were concerned about the
environment," said Palo Alto
resident Lois Hogle, 64, a
founding member of the
committee.

"We didn't want to see Daly
City trounce down the
skyline," she said. "And I think
they would have."
870 members
Since that year the commit
tee has grown to an 870 mem
bership, with self-made ex
perts on almost every en
vironmental issue on the
Peninsula.
Recently the committee
fought plans to build a
peripheral canal in the Sac
ramento Delta area. They also
worked against a proposed
sewage system in Half Moon
Bay which would support a
population of 30,000 people by
1990, instead of the normal
projected population of
19,000.
Neither plan gained ap
proval.
The committee is a re
spected, though not always
welcome, voice in every city
and county council meeting

from Redwood City to Cilroy.
Two paid representatives act as
watchdogs at meetings of
county supervisors and plan
ners, while volunteer mem
bers can be found at meetings
concerning everything from
bayland development to forest
preservation zoning.
Across country
"We've had calls from across
the country," Hogle said. "We
had a call once from New Jer
sey asking us how we had done
something."
One of the reasons the
committee has been so suc
cessful is that it has limited its
scope to a small geographic
area, said Isabel Sewell, 58,
Menlo Park resident and
member of the committee's
board of directors.
She added that another
reason for their success is that
the group doesn't hesitate to
fight things out in court.
"The committee has never
been afraid to consider a law
suit," Sewell said. "They make
their own decisions with their
own board and they can make
those decisions in one night if
they need to."
Community support has also
carried the committee a long
way, said Barrie Cirard, 32, a
Menlo Park attorney on the
board of directors.
Marshal forces
"We can marshal a lot of
forces," Girard said. "We are a
large group for something like
this and we find there is a lot of
unstated environmental sup
port in the area.
"Open space. Cleaner air. It
is the reason a lot of people
move into the Bay Area, and
watching it deteriorate isn't
their favorite game," she ad
ded.
Cirard, who championed the
committee's fight against coas
tal development in the Half
Moon Bay area, said the
strength of the committee lies
in the diversity of its member
ship.
People with specific in
terests can feel free to come
forward and work in that in
terest because one or two
people aren't trying to do ev
erything, Cirard said.
But the strength of the com
mittee is that it asks very penet
rating questions about the use
of public monies, Sewell said.

Although the committee has
made enemies in the business
and political arenas, the tradi
tional schism between en
vironmentalists and commer
cial interests is beginning to
blur, said James Pinneo, Palo
Alto resident and director of
the committee.
"It's an artificial distinction
and it's going to go away as
people become more edu
cated," she said. "The Ameri
can Dream is your own little
house on your own little piece
of land. It's going to be hard to
start rethinking that."
Some members agree that
one of the problems facing the
committee is to overcome its
elitist image.
"Conservation groups are
always accused of being elite,"
Sewell said, "because , let's
face it, other people are
scratching to make a living,
make payments on their
houses, their cars, and they
may not have the time to get
involved in environmental
concerns."
The causes the committee
has pushed for just don't
square with the criticisms of
elitism, Girard added.
"There is not a lot of green or
open space in the downtown
developments here, but saving
the foothills here is as accessi
ble to Joe Schmoe in his apart
ment building as anybody,"
she said.
"There's nothing esoteric
about what we do," Girard
said. "It's just that we do it."

they would have."
870 members
Since that year the commit
tee has grown to an 870 mem
bership, with self-made ex
perts on almost every en
vironmental issue on the
Peninsula.
Recently the committee
fought plans to build a
peripheral canal in the Sac
ramento Delta area. They also
worked against a proposed
sewage system in Half Moon
Bay which would support a
population of 30,000 people by
1990, instead of the normal
projected population of
19,000.
Neither plan gained ap
proval.
The committee is a re
spected, though not always
welcome, voice in every city
and county council meeting

from Redwood City to Cilroy.
Two paid representatives act as
watchdogs at meetings of
county supervisors and plan
ners, while volunteer mem
bers can be found at meetings
concerning everything from
bayland development to forest
preservation zoning.
Across country
"We've had calls from across
the country," Hogle said. "We
had a call once from New Jer
sey asking us how we had done
something."
One of the reasons the
committee has been so suc
cessful is that it has limited its
scope to a small geographic
area, said Isabel Sewell, 58,
Menlo Park resident and
member of the committee's
board of directors.
She added that another
reason for their success is that
the group doesn't hesitate to
fight things out in court.
"The committee has never
been afraid to consider a law
suit," Sewell said. "They make
their own decisions with their
own board and they can make
those decisions in one night if
they need to."
Community support has also
carried the committee a long
way, said Barrie Cirard, 32, a
Menlo Park attorney on the
board of directors.
Marshal forces
"We can marshal a lot of
forces," Girard said. "We are a
large group for something like
this and we find there is a lot of
unstated environmental sup
port in the area.
"Open space. Cleaner air. It
is the reason a lot of people
move into the Bay Area, and
watching it deteriorate isn't
their favorite game," she ad
ded.
Cirard, who championed the
committee's fight against coas
tal development in the Half
Moon Bay area, said the
strength of the committee lies
in the diversity of its member
ship.
People with specific in
terests can feel free to come
forward and work in that in
terest because one or two
people aren't trying to do ev
erything, Cirard said.
But the strength of the com
mittee is that it asks very penet
rating questions about the use
of public monies, Sewell said.

Although the committee has
made enemies in the business
and political arenas, the tradi
tional schism between en
vironmentalists and commer
cial interests is beginning to
blur, said James Pinneo, Palo
Alto resident and director of
the committee.
"It's an artificial distinction
and it's going to go away as
people become more edu
cated," she said. "The Ameri
can Dream is your own little
house on your own little piece
of land. It's going to be hard to
start rethinking that."
Some members agree that
one of the problems facing the
committee is to overcome its
elitist image.
"Conservation groups are
always accused of being elite,"
Sewell said, "because , let's
face it, other people are
scratching to make a living,
make payments on their
houses, their cars, and they
may not have the time to get
involved in environmental
concerns."
The causes the committee
has pushed for just don't
square with the criticisms of
elitism, Girard added.
"There is not a lot of green or
open space in the downtown
developments here, but saving
the foothills here is as accessi
ble to Joe Schmoe in his apart
ment building as anybody,"
she said.
"There's nothing esoteric
about what we do," Girard
said. "It's just that we do it."
Its board of directors reads
like a "Who's Who on the
Peninsula," and critics have re
ferred to its members as the
ones with diamonds on their
fingers, but the Committee for
Creen Foothills is a group of
hard-hitting environmentalists
who do not think of them
selves as elitists.
They think of themselves as
hard workers.
Creen Foothills was formed
in 1962 when a handful of
Menlo Park and Palo Alto area
residents combined forces to
combat a planned develop
ment of high rises and a shop
ping center in the foothills be
hind the University.
"There were 28 of us hand
picked people, and we knew
we were concerned about the
environment," said Palo Alto
resident Lois Hogle, 64, a
founding member of the
committee.

"We didn't want to see Daly
City trounce down the
skyline," she said. "And I think
they would have."
