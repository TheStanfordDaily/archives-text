How will they vote their shares today?
Profitability, profitability.
How will they vote their shares today?
Profits across the sea.
—SCRIP chant, sung to the
tune of "The Old Gray Mare"
Members of the Stanford Committee for Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) picketed the trustees' monthly meeting in San Francisco yesterday
while the board deliberated over shareholder proxies calling for U.S. corpo
rate withdrawal from South Africa.
"We wanted to let them know just how we felt about this issue," said SCRIP
member Chris Gray. "It has been easy for the trustees to say that they're
against apartheid, but so far they've taken zero action. We'll see what they do
today.''
About 25 demonstrators began marching with protest signs at 8 a.m. shout
ing "Vote yes, then divest!' as they distributed literature to passers-by and
trustees entering the building. SCRIP was calling for a yes vote by the trustees
on the shareholder proxies.
SCRIP members also voiced support of the recent decision of the Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility (CIR), chanting "Nowhere to run to,
nowhere to hide; we've got the CIR on our side."
The protest placed particular emphasis on the Bank of America referendum
because, according to SCRIP spokesperson Maggie Coud, the bank has
refused to consider any factors other than maximization of financial return in
giving loans.
