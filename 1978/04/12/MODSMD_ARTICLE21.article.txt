## Cardinal baseballers, preparing for tough USC weekend series... 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Coming off a successful
opening series against the
UCLA Bruins this past
weekend, the Stanford varsity
baseball team wings its way to
Los Angeles tomorrow morn
ing for a three game league
series with the USC Trojans,
last year's Pac-8 Southern Divi
sion champs and the toughest
competitor in the division
again this year.
Stanford (2-1) will play USC
(1-1) Thursday night at 7 p.m.
Friday night at 7 p.m. and
Saturday at 1 p.m. at the Tro
jans' Dedeaux field.
"The series is pivotal for us,"
said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess. "It's always tough for us
to play down there, but we're
playing our type of game now.
If we get good pitching, we'll
do well."
Larry Kuhn, sophomore
righthander, is tentatively
scheduled to face USC in to
morrow night's game and
Marquess will choose between
Mark Abbondola, Brian Harri
son and Joe LoPresti for the
mound duties on Friday and
Saturday. USC plans to throw
sophomore lefthander Bill
Bordley in the opener — the
ace of the Trojan staff — whose
14-0 record last year earned
him an Ail-American title as a
freshman.
Pitching will be the strong
point of the USC defense this
weekend; the Trojans having

three other pitchers with two
years of varsity experience
each. Rod Boxberger, the only
righthander in USC's starting
rotation, who was drafted in
the second round of the June
draft by the New York Mets;
junior Brian Hayes, who led the
Trojans last year with an ERA of
1.77; and Ernie Mauritson who
currently has a 6-0 record in his
senior year.
Leading the offense for USC
will be the All-Conference big
guns: catcher Dave Van Gor
der, thirdbaseman Dave Engle,
and firstbaseman Dave Hoste
tler.
Van Corder's .339 batting
average led the Trojans last
year, Engle finished close be
hind at .337, and Hostetler
added 13 homeruns and 48 RBI
for the season.
Last year, the Cardinals
opened league play down
south against USC and were
beaten in all three games of the
series. Later in the season,
however, Stanford handed the
Trojans one of their only two
losses in league play, beating
them 11-3 behind Rob irwin in
Sunken Diamond. The Cards
will be looking for at least a
couple of victories in the up
coming matchup.
Though Stanford isn't as
highly ranked nationally as the
powerful Trojans, on paper
they look just as impressive
with a 26-7-1 record compared
to USC's 26-6 mark. Spot star

ter John Pyle currently leads
the team with a .364 average
followed closely by hot hitting
Randy Wong at .333 and clutch
performer Tom Guardino at
.313.
Guardino already has eight
homeruns this season along
with six doubles and 30 RBI.
Wong has contributed 27 RBI
along with four homeruns and
six doubles thus far.
Meanwhile, on the bases,
Mike Codiroli leads the team
with 18 stolen bases in 22 at
tempts and Larry Reynolds has
successfully stolen 16 of 21.
Pepe Hinojosa is not far from
a national collegiate record for
receiving the most walks in a
career, and will most likely ap
proach that record this
weekend. Hinojosa has 47

walks thus far, which brings his
career total to 192 — just 10
away from the record of 202 set
by Arizona's Dave Stegman.
Hinojosa will be back in action
this weekend after suffering a
pulled hamstring against
UCLA.
Playing under the lights at
Dedeaux field may give a
couple of the Cards trouble at
the plate by making the already
hard throwing Trojan pitchers
look even faster, but Marquess
doesn't see this as presenting
too great of a problem. "We
played three night games in the
Riverside Tournament," said
Marquess, "so being under the
lights won't be new to us ... I
think the kids will adjust very
well."

proach that record this
weekend. Hinojosa has 47

walks thus far, which brings his
career total to 192 — just 10
away from the record of 202 set
by Arizona's Dave Stegman.
Hinojosa will be back in action
this weekend after suffering a
pulled hamstring against
UCLA.
Playing under the lights at
Dedeaux field may give a
couple of the Cards trouble at
the plate by making the already
hard throwing Trojan pitchers
look even faster, but Marquess
doesn't see this as presenting
too great of a problem. "We
played three night games in the
Riverside Tournament," said
Marquess, "so being under the
lights won't be new to us ... I
think the kids will adjust very
well."

Stanford's Tom Guardino (top) makes contact for the game winning homerun in the bottom of the tenth
inning against UCLA over the weekend. Afterward, he gets well-deserved congratulations from team
mates (bottom). Guardino's power will be heavily counted on in this weekend's series against the No. 2
ranked Trojans.
Coming off a successful
opening series against the
UCLA Bruins this past
weekend, the Stanford varsity
baseball team wings its way to
Los Angeles tomorrow morn
ing for a three game league
series with the USC Trojans,
last year's Pac-8 Southern Divi
sion champs and the toughest
competitor in the division
again this year.
Stanford (2-1) will play USC
(1-1) Thursday night at 7 p.m.
Friday night at 7 p.m. and
Saturday at 1 p.m. at the Tro
jans' Dedeaux field.
"The series is pivotal for us,"
said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess. "It's always tough for us
to play down there, but we're
playing our type of game now.
If we get good pitching, we'll
do well."
Larry Kuhn, sophomore
righthander, is tentatively
scheduled to face USC in to
morrow night's game and
Marquess will choose between
Mark Abbondola, Brian Harri
son and Joe LoPresti for the
mound duties on Friday and
Saturday. USC plans to throw
sophomore lefthander Bill
Bordley in the opener — the
ace of the Trojan staff — whose
14-0 record last year earned
him an Ail-American title as a
freshman.
Pitching will be the strong
point of the USC defense this
weekend; the Trojans having

three other pitchers with two
years of varsity experience
each. Rod Boxberger, the only
righthander in USC's starting
rotation, who was drafted in
the second round of the June
draft by the New York Mets;
junior Brian Hayes, who led the
Trojans last year with an ERA of
1.77; and Ernie Mauritson who
currently has a 6-0 record in his
senior year.
Leading the offense for USC
will be the All-Conference big
guns: catcher Dave Van Gor
der, thirdbaseman Dave Engle,
and firstbaseman Dave Hoste
tler.
Van Corder's .339 batting
average led the Trojans last
year, Engle finished close be
hind at .337, and Hostetler
added 13 homeruns and 48 RBI
for the season.
Last year, the Cardinals
opened league play down
south against USC and were
beaten in all three games of the
series. Later in the season,
however, Stanford handed the
Trojans one of their only two
losses in league play, beating
them 11-3 behind Rob irwin in
Sunken Diamond. The Cards
will be looking for at least a
couple of victories in the up
coming matchup.
Though Stanford isn't as
highly ranked nationally as the
powerful Trojans, on paper
they look just as impressive
with a 26-7-1 record compared
to USC's 26-6 mark. Spot star

ter John Pyle currently leads
the team with a .364 average
followed closely by hot hitting
Randy Wong at .333 and clutch
performer Tom Guardino at
.313.
Guardino already has eight
homeruns this season along
with six doubles and 30 RBI.
Wong has contributed 27 RBI
along with four homeruns and
six doubles thus far.
Meanwhile, on the bases,
Mike Codiroli leads the team
with 18 stolen bases in 22 at
tempts and Larry Reynolds has
successfully stolen 16 of 21.
Pepe Hinojosa is not far from
a national collegiate record for
receiving the most walks in a
career, and will most likely ap
proach that record this
weekend. Hinojosa has 47

walks thus far, which brings his
career total to 192 — just 10
away from the record of 202 set
by Arizona's Dave Stegman.
