Linda Jezek, the American
record-holder in the 100 and
200 yard backstroke events,
has signed a national letter of
intent to attend Stanford, head
swimming coach Jim Gaughran
announced yesterday.
Jezek, a senior at Homestead
High School and a member of
the Santa Clara Swim Club,
broke her own national re
cords last weekend at the AAU
National Swimming Champ
ionships in Austin, Texas. She
was timed in 54.94 for the 100
and 1:57.79 for the 200.
Gaughran, whose women's
team finished third in the na
tion this season, said (ezek's
addition makes the Cardinals a
contender for the national title
in 1979.
"Linda is the best
backstroker in the nation, if
not the world," Gaughran said.
"She makes us quite tough in
an event that didn't bring us a
lot of points at the AIAW Na
tional Championships. She is
also outstanding in the indi
vidual medley and butterfly,
and could swim on our frees
tyle relay teams."
Gaughran also announced
the signing of Noel Moran, a
teammate of Jezek's at the
Santa Clara Swim Club and a
senior at Sacred Heart High
School in Menlo Park. Gaug
hran rates Moran as one of the

top breaststrokers in the na
tion. She broke 2:18 in the 200
breaststroke in last year's dual
meet with East Germany.
"The addition of Jezek and
Moran could lower our time in
the medley relay by as much as
10 seconds," Gaughran said.
"Not only are we getting two of
the top swimmers in the na
tion, but we are getting them in
the events where we are
weakest."

Two high school All-
Americas in women's basket
ball have signed letters of in

1977 Junior Pan American Team
