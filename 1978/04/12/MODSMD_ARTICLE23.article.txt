The Stanford baseball team,
looking ahead to this
weekend's games with USC in
Los Angeles, was shocked
13-11, in 13 innings, by Cal
State-Dominguez Hills.
Stanford fell behind 2-0 in
the first on a homerun by the
Toros' Walter Greer. Cal State
added another run in the sec
ond off starter Brian Harrison,
but Bruce Walters' 2 RBI single
in the bottom of the second cut
Stanford's deficit to one.
In the bottom of the fourth,
designated hitter John Pyle
poked a towering shot over the
rightfield fence to pull Stan
ford into a tie at four all. Todd
Ervin's second homer of his
career, and second in three
days, was the key hit in the
three-run fifth that put Stan
ford ahead for the first time.
Rob Irwin pitched well in his
three-inning spin, leaving
Stanford ahead 7-4, but re
liever Rick Halstead could not

hold off the Toros. Cal State
scored once in the seventh and
six times in the eighth chasing
both Halstead and Bruce Fiala
off the mound. Stanford tied
the game at 11 all with three
runs in the ninth, sending the
game into extra innings.
Stani jrd had won all six pre
vious extra-inning games this
season and losing pitcher Joe
LoPresti (3-9) held Cal State
scoreless through the twelfth,
but Stanford could not score
either. LoPresti left in the thir
teenth with bases loaded and
one out. Larry Kuhn gave up an
RBI single to the Toros' Mike
Ferguson for the eventual win
ning run. This was followed by
a run scoring sacrifice fly that
sent Cardinal rightfielder Mike
Codiroli to the wall. Stanford
retired in order in their half of
the thirteenth.
