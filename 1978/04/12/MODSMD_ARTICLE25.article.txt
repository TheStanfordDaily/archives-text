The undefeated Stanford
women's tennis team, despite
resting several top players, rol
led its 12th win of the season
yesterday with a 9-0 shutout
win over Santa Clara at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium.
The sweep was the second
straight for the women, who
crushed the UC-lrvine Anteat
ers by the same score Sunday.
And yesterday, as on Sun
day, the Cards also won every
set. In the last four team meets,
Stanford has lost only five of 36
matches.
In addition to resting Sue
Hagey, who sat out Sunday,
the Cards also played without
Kathy Jordan, who Sunday
upset defending national
champion Lindsay Morse 6-3,
6-4. Sunday winners Diane
Morrison and Nancy Rudd also
did not participate yesterday.
Barb Jordan took over the
No. 1 singles spot yesterday
and blitzed the Broncos'
Tammy Teichgraber 6-3, 6-3.
Donna Rubin, who Sunday
triumphed in singles and dou

bles, came back yesterday to
pick up two wins again. She
stopped Becki Leify 6-2, 6-0,
and then teamed with Caryn
Hertel in the No. 1 doubles for
a 6-3, 6-3 win over Teichgraber
and Leify.
Hertel, who also collected
two wins Sunday, took her
singles match with a 6-0, 6-3
win over Kathy Reilly yester
day.
Hertel, who tried out for the
team as a walk-on, has worked
her way to the No. 7 slot. "She
has improved a lot, and will
improve a lot more," said
coach Ann Gould.
Today the Cards face the
University of San Diego in a
2:30 p.m. match at the tennis
stadium.
