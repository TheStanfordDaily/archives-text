### Andrea lames 
A California Court of Appeals has
ruled that the state may not subsidize
private medical schools and as a re
sult, the University may lose $448,000
in state grants.
A unanimous ruling by the Third
District Court of Appeals was issued
Monday. It found State grants to pri
vate medical schools unconstitu
tional because Article 9 of the
California Constitution states that
"no public money shall ever be ap
propriated for the support" of any
schools "not under the exclusive
control of the officers of the public
schools."
University Counsel John Schwartz
said the University will probably "re
quest the State Supreme Court to re
view the matter."
The University filed suit last year
against State Controller Kenneth

Cory and State Treasurer Jesse Un
ruh, claiming the state owed it
$440,0(X) in support.
Written contract with state
In accordance with a program set
up by the State Scholarship and Loan
Commission, the University signed a
written contract with the state in
1973, assuring that it would receive
capitation or "per head" grants for
each additional student it enrolled
after 1970-71, Schwartz said.
The program provided that medi
cal schools which enrolled more stu
dents than it had in 1970-71 would
receive up to $12,000 for each new
student.
The state program was originally
established by the legislature for the
purpose of increasing the number of
physicians in the state, according to
Spyros Andreopoulos of the Medical
Center News Bureau here.

The legislature found it wo d be
cheaper to train physicians in exist
ing medical schools than to build
new ones, and hence provided in
centive for medical schools to in
crease their enrollment.
Increased enrollment
According to Carl Hitchner, as
sociate staff counsel for the Univer
sity, Stanford increased its Medical
School enrollment by 35 students in
1973 and by 26 students in 1974 and
received money for each student.
However, in 1975, the state con
troller refused to pay the $10,200 per
student when the University submit
ted a similar application to enlarge its
enrollment by 44 students.
In oral arguments heard in court
last November, the University ar
gued that contracts serving impor
tant public purposes are not "sup
port" under the terms of the Califor

nia Constitution.
'The funds were not given to us,"
Schwartz said after the oral argu
ments. "It was a contract with the
state. We (Stanford) had to do some
thing to get those funds; we had to
increase our enrollment."
At that time, Cory told the Daily he
had to refuse making payments to
the University because "the program
which set up the payments was ruled
unconstitutional."
Corywas referringtoa ruling made
in 1975 by the attorney general.
