Washington — Former FBI Director L. Patrick Gray 111
and two other former key FBI officials were indicted

ments at a news conference, said the charges arose from
FBI activities earlier in the decade when the agency was
pursuing radical fugitives.
The federal grand jury in Washington indicted Gray,
former Associate FBI Director W. Mark Felt and former
Assistant Director Edward Miller on a single charge of
conspiring to violate the rights of citizens.
That charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in
prison and a fine of $10,000.
Soviet U.N. official in hiding in U.S.
Arkady Shevchenko, the top Soviet employee of the
United Nations, remained in hiding yesterday while a
Soviet official sought to portray him as a problem
drinker influenced by U.S. intelligence agents to walk
off his job and stay in the United States.
The official, Second Secretary Evgeny Lukyantsev of
the Soviet U.N. mission in New York, said his govern
ment would ask that Shevchenko be fired from his U.N.
post. He is undersecretary general for political and Sec
urity Council affairs.
In Moscow, a woman claiming to be Shevchenko's
wife said she believed he was being held by Americans
against his will. But the U.S. government denied in
volvement in the incident, which Shevchenko's Ameri
can lawyer declined to characterize as a defection.
Voluntary anti-inflation efforts urged
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, in a new effort
to slow inflation, asked business and labor for voluntary
cooperation yesterday and promised not to use wage
and price controls except in "a national emergency like
all-out war."
The president, launching a new anti-inflation offen
sive, also chided Congress for not enacting his long
stalled energy program and threatened administrative
action to restrict foreign oil imports.
Carter said he would set an example by seeking to
limit federal pay increases to about 5.5 per cent this year
and by vetoing legislation that would fuel inflation.
Carter gave his White House staff a pay raise of up to
25 per cent in March 1977 and another of 7.05 per cent in
November.

their government, returned home to south Lebanon yes

from the Israeli-occupied coastal town of Abassiye. "We
just don't have any choice."
The government says it will cut off rations to refugees
who refuse to return to homes in the south. Those who
return will get a month's supply of food.
To the north, in Beirut, bitter fighting continued bet

Strike end has not guaranteed jobs
Charleston, W. Va. — For several thousand Appalac
hian coal miners, the end of the 111-day United Mine
Workers strike has not meant an end to hardship.
They're laid off because the export market for metal
lurgical coal is bad and the strike left shipping tangled.
As a result, some mines serving foreign customers are
idle.
Hugh Flaherty, a spokesman at Pittston headquarters
in Greenwich, Conn., said, "The strike made it impossi
ble for our foreign coal customers, mainly the Japanese,
to schedule vessels into the port until they were certain
the strike would be over."
Unconstitutional, costly bills vetoed
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, speaking
shortly after a House committee trimmed back its tuition
tax credit bill, said yesterday he would veto any such bill
that he considers either unconstitutional or too costly.
"Every proposal I have seen in the Congress so far is
both costly and unconstitutional," the president told the
American Society of Newspaper Editors.
"I don't favor tuition tax credits under any cir
cumstance, even at a very slight level," Carter said. "It's
very detrimental to the future of education in our coun
try."
Students with federal grants audited

selected for the audits each year. About two million

cost to the government of $1.7 billion. HEW said it esti
mates that $120 million went to ineligible students or in
overpayments to eligible students in 1977.

in Greenwich, Conn., said, "The strike made it impossi
ble for our foreign coal customers, mainly the Japanese,
to schedule vessels into the port until they were certain
the strike would be over."
Unconstitutional, costly bills vetoed
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, speaking
shortly after a House committee trimmed back its tuition
tax credit bill, said yesterday he would veto any such bill
that he considers either unconstitutional or too costly.
"Every proposal I have seen in the Congress so far is
both costly and unconstitutional," the president told the
American Society of Newspaper Editors.
"I don't favor tuition tax credits under any cir
cumstance, even at a very slight level," Carter said. "It's
very detrimental to the future of education in our coun
try."
