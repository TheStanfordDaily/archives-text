# CPPC: define and find jobs
## 
### Helen Nissenbaum 
"The essential purpose of the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC) is to help students make deci
sions about their careers, and to help them find jobs"
after graduation, according to CPPC Director Ralph Kel
ler.
One measure of the success of this aim is the fact that
with the exception of one year, CPPC has consistently
increased its job placement rate for the past 11 years,
Keller said. This contrasts with the opposite trend in the
job placement of college graduates in general, he ad
ded.
Keller said he "does not know of any center (at
another college) that has a career planning program as
extensive as this one."
"We help individuals get their act together so they
have as good a chance as possible" to get the jobs they
want, he added.
Serves students, alumni
CPPC, located between the Bookstore and Green
(Main) Library, serves currently enrolled students, stu
dent spouses and alumni.
In the 1976-77 academic year 80 per cent of students
not planning to go immediately to graduate school regis
tered with the CPPC, Keller said.
The present structure of the CPPC was determined in
1970 when a study of education here recommended that
the existing placement center include a "career gui
dance center," Keller said.
Many students go through college without giving
much thought to what they're ultimately going to be
doing, Keller said.
Potential careers
The CPPC helps guide students toward potential
careers, but "we don't tell a student what to do, or

decide for them what their needs are," Keller said. CPPC
tries to respond "in terms of what they (students) per
ceive their needs to be," he added.
CPPC organizes about 90 seminars and workshops
each year. The seminars deal with career options and
opportunities, job hunting, resume writing techniques,
and self assessment, according to Keller.
The center also offers individual counseling from
permanent staff members and trained peer counselors,
and has a library stocked with career information.
Individuals registered with CPPC receive a weekly list
of jobs available in their area of specialization, compiled
from continual research by the center.
Employment files
A person registered with CPPC can also maintain a file.
On request CPPC will send the file to prospective
employers.
"We send over 25,000 confidential files each year,"
Keller said. "We have taken a lot of pride in our place
ment files so that when they go out from here, they look
better than anybody else's."
CPPC also facilitates campus interviews and recruiting
by companies. CPPC does this because "students want
to talk to them about employment," Keller said.
Last year representatives from about 500 companies
visited campus and 15,000 interviews were held.
Student Employment Office
The Student Employment Office (SEO), a section of
CPPC, is located in a separate office adjacent to the main
office. SEO handles part time and temporary employ
ment for students. SEO lists available jobs and offers
employment counseling.
Keller said CPPC is used extensively, but added that
"there are still many students who do not use the center
and only realize when they've left that they should
have."

While student marchers protested outside yesterday's meeting of the Board of
Trustees, members of the Board inside went on record as being opposed to
corporate expansion by U.S. firms in South Africa. The trustees voted to prohibit
expansion until racist policies of apartheid cease.

tries to respond "in terms of what they (students) per
ceive their needs to be," he added.
CPPC organizes about 90 seminars and workshops
each year. The seminars deal with career options and
opportunities, job hunting, resume writing techniques,
and self assessment, according to Keller.
The center also offers individual counseling from
permanent staff members and trained peer counselors,
and has a library stocked with career information.
Individuals registered with CPPC receive a weekly list
of jobs available in their area of specialization, compiled
from continual research by the center.
Employment files
A person registered with CPPC can also maintain a file.
On request CPPC will send the file to prospective
employers.
"We send over 25,000 confidential files each year,"
Keller said. "We have taken a lot of pride in our place
ment files so that when they go out from here, they look
better than anybody else's."
CPPC also facilitates campus interviews and recruiting
by companies. CPPC does this because "students want
to talk to them about employment," Keller said.
Last year representatives from about 500 companies
visited campus and 15,000 interviews were held.
Student Employment Office
The Student Employment Office (SEO), a section of
CPPC, is located in a separate office adjacent to the main
office. SEO handles part time and temporary employ
ment for students. SEO lists available jobs and offers
employment counseling.
Keller said CPPC is used extensively, but added that
"there are still many students who do not use the center
and only realize when they've left that they should
have."

While student marchers protested outside yesterday's meeting of the Board of
Trustees, members of the Board inside went on record as being opposed to
corporate expansion by U.S. firms in South Africa. The trustees voted to prohibit
expansion until racist policies of apartheid cease.
"The essential purpose of the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC) is to help students make deci
sions about their careers, and to help them find jobs"
after graduation, according to CPPC Director Ralph Kel
ler.
One measure of the success of this aim is the fact that
with the exception of one year, CPPC has consistently
increased its job placement rate for the past 11 years,
Keller said. This contrasts with the opposite trend in the
job placement of college graduates in general, he ad
ded.
Keller said he "does not know of any center (at
another college) that has a career planning program as
extensive as this one."
"We help individuals get their act together so they
have as good a chance as possible" to get the jobs they
want, he added.
Serves students, alumni
CPPC, located between the Bookstore and Green
(Main) Library, serves currently enrolled students, stu
dent spouses and alumni.
In the 1976-77 academic year 80 per cent of students
not planning to go immediately to graduate school regis
tered with the CPPC, Keller said.
The present structure of the CPPC was determined in
1970 when a study of education here recommended that
the existing placement center include a "career gui
dance center," Keller said.
Many students go through college without giving
much thought to what they're ultimately going to be
doing, Keller said.
Potential careers
The CPPC helps guide students toward potential
careers, but "we don't tell a student what to do, or

decide for them what their needs are," Keller said. CPPC
tries to respond "in terms of what they (students) per
ceive their needs to be," he added.
CPPC organizes about 90 seminars and workshops
each year. The seminars deal with career options and
opportunities, job hunting, resume writing techniques,
and self assessment, according to Keller.
