# Part of nation-wide trend
## Hospital income down $1.5 million 
### Andrea lames 
The Stanford Hospital has received about $1.5 million
less than it projected for this fiscal year, and hospital
authorities do not see a forthcoming end to the budget
ary loss.
Gary Mecklenburg, a Hospital administrator, said the
Hospital is currently working at about six or seven per
cent below budgetary level because of ar. unexpected
decline in patient admittance.
"We have a traditional high capacity of about 80 per
cent, which is considered to be very high by today's
standards," Mecklenburg said. "We are still working at
about 70 per cent, but we are about six or seven per cent
below budget level."
Mecklenburg said the lower occupancy level is part of
a nation-wide trend of less hospitalization.
The Hospital may also be losing patients because
there is a lack of certain facilities. Mecklenburg said the
shortage of operating rooms may be one factor which is
forcing some patients to go elsewhere for surgery.
The Hospital is attempting to cut costs to make up the

budgetary difference, Mecklenburg said. Earlier this
year, the Hospital closed one unit in Hoover Pavilion,
reducing the Hospital's operating size by 32 beds.
No employees were laid off but were instead incorpo
rated into different units of the Hospital.
"There were no lay-offs at all," Mecklenburg said.
"However, now when there is an opening, we are look
ing selectively at that opening and not filling it if possi
ble."
The Hospital has also "deferred purchase" of equip
ment but Mecklenburg said the purchase postpone
ment would not affect the care of patients.
Mecklenburg said the Hospital is conducting ongoing
efforts, as is the whole nation, to contain health care
costs.
"We have a recently-formed committee of manage
ment staff and medical staff which is looking closely at
ways in which we can cut health care costs," he said.
He added he did not know when the committee's first
report would be available because "the committee is so
new."
