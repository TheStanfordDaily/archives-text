## 
### Kathy Andrews 
Topics ranging from women and
government, racist extremism and
the Bakke decision to the United
Mine Workers strike are scheduled
for speeches, films and events in the
upcoming Stanford Organizing
Committee (SOC) Disorientation
Week.
SOC, which describes itself as a
coalition of progressive, feminist,
labor and Third World groups, will
present Disorientation Week bet
ween April 16 and 23.
"SOC will provide the community
with different points of view not rep
resented by the dominant Western
culture ideology," said Phyllis
Brown, a Half the Sky representative.
"The week is intended to educate
and to enlighten members of the
community," Brown added. "It is not
in any way intended to indoctrinate
them, but to expose them to the idea
that these other points of view are
valid."
Benefit SOC groups, too
The week will also benefit the SOC
groups themselves, expressing their
solidarity and getting them to
examine one another's issues,
Brown said.
According to SOC member Jim
Lutz, "The first Disorientation Week
was put on by the Alliance for Radical
Change two years ago."
The first Disorientation Week was
"more narrow" and a smaller scaled
version of this year's week, Lutz
ded.

Contributors to the week's funds
include the Office of Student Ac
tivities, the Office of the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies, the Career
Planning and Placement Center, and
the University Lectures Committee.
Funding sources
"We did not expect so many fund
ing sources to come through with so
much," said David Catanzarite, a
member of Hillel's Oppressed Jewry
Committee.
