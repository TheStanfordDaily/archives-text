# Herb Caen: more than your basic curmudgeon
## 
### John Nielsen 
Herb Caen is the last columnist in the country to
write six times a week, at a thousand words a shot.
Most of his in-trade peers do three, or sometimes
four such pieces, but no one without ghost writers
does six anymore, except Herb Caen.
"I used to do seven," he says from his chair in his
fourth floor San Francisco office with a view. "Seven
was ridiculous. Six is still madness, but I'm sort of a
workaholic, so it doesn't bother me that much.
Someone's got to keep all those myths alive."
Herb Caen is not your everyday curmudgeon. He's
very interested in what people think about his col
umn. "After all, its my bread and butter/' he says."I
understand that it's a turkey if it doesn't make people
look up from their coffee. I try most of all to be
entertaining. Things like blind items — those that
expose people — those are always secondary unless
something's been really disastrous or somebody's
been really reprehensible, and I'm the only one that
knows about it. I try to be entertaining, then, if that
doesn't work then the whole thing is usually a bum
mer."
Caen writes his columns at his desk in the morn
ings. "Luckily I can rap it out because I am able to
write fast." Between himself and one "worthy'' sec
retary all phone calls and letters are dealt with. That
too distinguishes him from most other major
nists. "I'm very accessible," he says."I want to be.

"I don't want people to think Herb Caen is a corpo
ration, or something like Prudence Penny or Carrie
Cash, so I sit here and answer the phone and then
people don't believe me. They're so used to the voice
of American Express or a third assistant that it takes 10
minutes to convince them, and then they blurt out a
story that I don't use anyway and they end up hating
me.
"Those are the phone calls. I also get about a
thousand letters a week. Half of them have stories in
them, and the other half say 'you stink,' or when are
you going to quit,' or 'my grandfather read your col
umn, and so did his grandfather, and they hate you.' I
like those kinds of letters in a way because they let me
know people are still reading.
"As for getting in trouble, I've only been sued a
couple of times in 40 years, and that's not a bad
record. I've been wrong many times, Lord knows, but
so far there's only been one invasion of privacy and
one libel. That's pretty good. I don't know what my
batting average is. I hope its over 500. It should be
1000, but it never is."
Herb Caen is appreciative of the help he is often

offered, but he doesn't think he has any sort of a
Stoolie network established. "I don't have that many
'informants,' actually, its mostly just a matter of my
calling people up frantically in the morning saying 'its
deadline time, quick, whadda ya know!' The few
'formal' informants I have don't get paid or anything;
they've just been friends for so long that they know
they're supposed to be looking for stories.
"I also get a lot of tips from strangers. They call in
with what they think is a funny story, or something
nasty about their friends, or they say 'I can't give you
my name but you can go and check this out.'
"Most anonymous messages are true; they'll be
from the police department, or from a sensitive job. A
lot of it is too self serving, but most of it is true."
Caen does not want his column to get flabby. "Enter
tainment needs opinions, and I have a lot of those.
I've always been opinionated, outspoken and mis
guided, and I think people like to read those things
rather than have me be a complete mystery. Re
member, it is very important to know what motivates
someone before you decide to hate them or not."

How has the city changed?
"It is harder to write about now. Even though it's
still relatively small in population the demographics
are different, and that makes it harder. Great word,
'demographics.' The city is sensitive now. A lot of San
Francisco doesn't like to read anything that could be
construed as being remotely critical of them or the
waythey live, so there are whole areas of thecity that I
have to ignore.
"It was like one continual party, it seemed to me,
when I was young. I used to go to eight or 10 places a
night, and stay up for 18 out of 24 hours. It's harder
now than when we had the phony feeling that we
were just one big happy family on the edge of the
Pacific. Then you could kid anyone and get away with
it."
Does this mean Caen thinks the city has passed him
by?
"Maybe. Part of it has. I'm not as conservative as
the old timers were, but there's nothing worse than
pretending to be young. But then again, if anybody
thinks they can do a better job than me I'd be happy
to turn over my typewriter.
"I do some talking about the cold gray city of hate
and the warm gray city of love, and the heartstrings of
the bridge, but I'm pretty tired of it and I only do it to
keep the franchise.
"People expect me to reminisce about old San
Francisco, but I only do it every now and then. After
all, it is San Francisco. It's not just some lumpy
Salinas."
