## Legality and drug use Consistent policy needed 
### 
Doug Bandow

America currently finds itself
caught in conflicting cross-current
on legal attitudes towards drug use.
Alcoholic beverages were outlawed
during "Prohibition," but are now
legal. Cigarettes, removed from the
jurisdiction of the FDA in 1905, now
face greater government regula
tions.
Marijuana, once thought to be
very dangerous, and still the subject
of conflicting studies, has been
gradually moving toward de
criminalization — at the same time,
the U.S. is paying millions to have it
sprayed with Paraquat, a toxic her
bicide, which is creating a new health
hazard. And finally, laetrile, though
outlawed by the FDA, is now legal in
more than eight states, and is gather
ing support.
A consistent policy toward the vol
untary ingestion of all these drugs is
needed; only libertarians offer one.
Most everyone else is curiously in
consistent — even perversely so. For
example, conservatives tend to ad
vocate the prohibition of marijuana,
though not alcohol, cigarettes, and
laetrile. Liberals tend to support the
suppression of laetrile (and some do
for cigarettes) but not alcohol and
marijuana.
There is really no principled basis
upon which to distinguish these dif
ferent drugs, and to treat them in
consistently; each side, conservative
and liberal, jettisons "personal free
dom" and "freedom of choice"
when its own pet peeve is at issue.
Obviously, neither group can really
be trusted with our liberty.
Controlling external factors
The most important factor to con
sider in deciding whether to ban the
drug or not is whether it poses any
externalities for others, and whether
those externalities can be controlled
in other less burdensome ways.
Alcohol may pose the clearest
danger. It is estimated that at least
one half of each year's 55,000 auto
deaths and million major injuries are
directly attributable to alcohol.
Cigarettes directly offend innocent
bystanders, and may exacerbate al
lergies and respiratory conditions.
The.problems with marijuana
seem to be similar to those of al
cohol; for example, in some cities,
up to 16 per cent of drivers involved
in fatal accidents have been found to
have been smoking marijuana. Fi
nally, laetrile appears to be the least
affected by this category.
Thus on the basis of exernalities,
alcohol — which virtually no one
proposes banning — seems to be the
most harmful. Conservatives seeking
to ban marijuana, and not alcohol

and cigarettes, and liberals seeking
to ban cigarettes and laetrile, but
not the others, are behaving rather
oddly.
Furthermore, regulation of the
conduct leading to externality (e.g.,
driving while intoxicated, smoking in
public) is the proper means of con
trol.
Social interest
There is also the argument of a
general social interest — that society
is itself harmed by certain conduct.
For example, it has been estimated
that the cost of alcoholism in the U.S.
is as high as $15 billion a year, much
of that from lost work time. Similarly,
with regard to marijuana, columnist
Patrick Buchanon has argued that
legalization would "rapidly create
millions of new users and a genera
tion of potheads to join the current
generation of alcoholics as a menace
to, and burden upon, the rest of soc
iety."
Similar arguments can be made
about possible deaths from cigarette
and laetrile use. What is amazing is to
see a conservative, like Buchanon,
argue this way on marijuana, but not
on cigarettes, ora liberal talk this way
on laetrile, but not marijuana.
This idea of a social interest should
be treated directly and consistently.
The argument fails, because it goes
too far. Taking laetrile (and pot,
cigarettes, and alcohol), participat
ing in risky sports, riding motorcy
cles without helmets, and most ev
erything else arguably imposes "so
cial costs" if someone is injured or
killed. If we are willing to subordi
nate individual liberty any time there
is a "social interest," liberty will no
longer exist. We will merely be prop
erty of the U.S. government.
Question of danger
Finally, there is the question of
dangerousness to the person taking
the drug. Alcohol may impair many
physical and mental functions, cause
liver disease, negatively affect brain
functioning, and weaken heart mus
cles. It is well-established that
cigarette smoking can lead to heart
disease, circulatory diseases, em
physema, chronic bronchitis, lung
and other cancers, and hyperten
sion.
Marijuana has been charged with
being dangerous — such as causing
genetic damage, the impairment of
the body immunities to disease, sex
ual impotency, psychological addic
tion, etc. — but the studies have
been conflicting. And most physi
cians consider laetrile to be harmless
unless taken instead of regular
treatment (though there are a couple
of recent studies suggesting there is

some danger if laetrile is taken in
conjunction with certain other
foods).
Thus we find conservatives attack
ing marijuana for its possible danger,
but not cigarettes and alcohol. Liber
als attack cigarettes and laetrile, but
not alcohol and marijuana.
This question of danger should
also be treated consistently, though
in any case it is basically irrelevant. As
long as we are dealing with compe
tent individuals, able to understand
the relevant information and assess
the risks, those individual choices
should stand. If an individual feels
the pleasure of pot outweighs its po
tential risks, or that the placebo ef
fect of laetrile justifies its cost, or that
the use of cigarettes and alcohol is
worth the risk, then society should
not impose its own arbitrary balance.
Both liberals and conservatives
should unite to fight Big Brother on
these issues. The Big Brother that
protects us from marijuana by
poisoning it is the same Big Brother
that protects us from laetrile by forc
ing us to pay exorbitant prices for it
in other countries. Unfortunately,
what we really need protection from
is Big Brother.

be trusted with our liberty.
Controlling external factors
The most important factor to con
sider in deciding whether to ban the
drug or not is whether it poses any
externalities for others, and whether
those externalities can be controlled
in other less burdensome ways.
Alcohol may pose the clearest
danger. It is estimated that at least
one half of each year's 55,000 auto
deaths and million major injuries are
directly attributable to alcohol.
Cigarettes directly offend innocent
bystanders, and may exacerbate al
lergies and respiratory conditions.
The.problems with marijuana
seem to be similar to those of al
cohol; for example, in some cities,
up to 16 per cent of drivers involved
in fatal accidents have been found to
have been smoking marijuana. Fi
nally, laetrile appears to be the least
affected by this category.
Thus on the basis of exernalities,
alcohol — which virtually no one
proposes banning — seems to be the
most harmful. Conservatives seeking
to ban marijuana, and not alcohol

and cigarettes, and liberals seeking
to ban cigarettes and laetrile, but
not the others, are behaving rather
oddly.
Furthermore, regulation of the
conduct leading to externality (e.g.,
driving while intoxicated, smoking in
public) is the proper means of con
trol.
Social interest
There is also the argument of a
general social interest — that society
is itself harmed by certain conduct.
For example, it has been estimated
that the cost of alcoholism in the U.S.
is as high as $15 billion a year, much
of that from lost work time. Similarly,
with regard to marijuana, columnist
Patrick Buchanon has argued that
legalization would "rapidly create
millions of new users and a genera
tion of potheads to join the current
generation of alcoholics as a menace
to, and burden upon, the rest of soc
iety."
Similar arguments can be made
about possible deaths from cigarette
and laetrile use. What is amazing is to
see a conservative, like Buchanon,
argue this way on marijuana, but not
on cigarettes, ora liberal talk this way
on laetrile, but not marijuana.
This idea of a social interest should
be treated directly and consistently.
The argument fails, because it goes
too far. Taking laetrile (and pot,
cigarettes, and alcohol), participat
ing in risky sports, riding motorcy
cles without helmets, and most ev
erything else arguably imposes "so
cial costs" if someone is injured or
killed. If we are willing to subordi
nate individual liberty any time there
is a "social interest," liberty will no
longer exist. We will merely be prop
erty of the U.S. government.
Question of danger
Finally, there is the question of
dangerousness to the person taking
the drug. Alcohol may impair many
physical and mental functions, cause
liver disease, negatively affect brain
functioning, and weaken heart mus
cles. It is well-established that
cigarette smoking can lead to heart
disease, circulatory diseases, em
physema, chronic bronchitis, lung
and other cancers, and hyperten
sion.
Marijuana has been charged with
being dangerous — such as causing
genetic damage, the impairment of
the body immunities to disease, sex
ual impotency, psychological addic
tion, etc. — but the studies have
been conflicting. And most physi
cians consider laetrile to be harmless
unless taken instead of regular
treatment (though there are a couple
of recent studies suggesting there is

some danger if laetrile is taken in
conjunction with certain other
foods).
Thus we find conservatives attack
ing marijuana for its possible danger,
but not cigarettes and alcohol. Liber
als attack cigarettes and laetrile, but
not alcohol and marijuana.
This question of danger should
also be treated consistently, though
in any case it is basically irrelevant. As
long as we are dealing with compe
tent individuals, able to understand
the relevant information and assess
the risks, those individual choices
should stand. If an individual feels
the pleasure of pot outweighs its po
tential risks, or that the placebo ef
fect of laetrile justifies its cost, or that
the use of cigarettes and alcohol is
worth the risk, then society should
not impose its own arbitrary balance.
Both liberals and conservatives
should unite to fight Big Brother on
these issues. The Big Brother that
protects us from marijuana by
poisoning it is the same Big Brother
that protects us from laetrile by forc
ing us to pay exorbitant prices for it
in other countries. Unfortunately,
what we really need protection from
is Big Brother.

America currently finds itself
caught in conflicting cross-current
on legal attitudes towards drug use.
Alcoholic beverages were outlawed
during "Prohibition," but are now
legal. Cigarettes, removed from the
jurisdiction of the FDA in 1905, now
face greater government regula
tions.
Marijuana, once thought to be
very dangerous, and still the subject
of conflicting studies, has been
gradually moving toward de
criminalization — at the same time,
the U.S. is paying millions to have it
sprayed with Paraquat, a toxic her
bicide, which is creating a new health
hazard. And finally, laetrile, though
outlawed by the FDA, is now legal in
more than eight states, and is gather
ing support.
A consistent policy toward the vol
untary ingestion of all these drugs is
needed; only libertarians offer one.
Most everyone else is curiously in
consistent — even perversely so. For
example, conservatives tend to ad
vocate the prohibition of marijuana,
though not alcohol, cigarettes, and
laetrile. Liberals tend to support the
suppression of laetrile (and some do
for cigarettes) but not alcohol and
marijuana.
There is really no principled basis
upon which to distinguish these dif
ferent drugs, and to treat them in
consistently; each side, conservative

when its own pet peeve is at issue.

that the cost of alcoholism in the U.S.
is as high as $15 billion a year, much
of that from lost work time. Similarly,
with regard to marijuana, columnist
Patrick Buchanon has argued that
legalization would "rapidly create
millions of new users and a genera
tion of potheads to join the current
generation of alcoholics as a menace
to, and burden upon, the rest of soc
iety."
Similar arguments can be made
about possible deaths from cigarette
and laetrile use. What is amazing is to
see a conservative, like Buchanon,
argue this way on marijuana, but not
on cigarettes, ora liberal talk this way
on laetrile, but not marijuana.
This idea of a social interest should
be treated directly and consistently.
The argument fails, because it goes
too far. Taking laetrile (and pot,
cigarettes, and alcohol), participat
ing in risky sports, riding motorcy
cles without helmets, and most ev
erything else arguably imposes "so
cial costs" if someone is injured or
killed. If we are willing to subordi
nate individual liberty any time there
is a "social interest," liberty will no
longer exist. We will merely be prop
erty of the U.S. government.
Question of danger
Finally, there is the question of
dangerousness to the person taking
the drug. Alcohol may impair many
physical and mental functions, cause
liver disease, negatively affect brain
functioning, and weaken heart mus
cles. It is well-established that
cigarette smoking can lead to heart
disease, circulatory diseases, em
physema, chronic bronchitis, lung
and other cancers, and hyperten
sion.
Marijuana has been charged with
being dangerous — such as causing
genetic damage, the impairment of
the body immunities to disease, sex
ual impotency, psychological addic
tion, etc. — but the studies have
been conflicting. And most physi
cians consider laetrile to be harmless
unless taken instead of regular
treatment (though there are a couple
of recent studies suggesting there is

some danger if laetrile is taken in
conjunction with certain other
foods).
Thus we find conservatives attack
ing marijuana for its possible danger,
but not cigarettes and alcohol. Liber
als attack cigarettes and laetrile, but
not alcohol and marijuana.
This question of danger should
also be treated consistently, though
in any case it is basically irrelevant. As
long as we are dealing with compe
tent individuals, able to understand
the relevant information and assess
the risks, those individual choices
should stand. If an individual feels
the pleasure of pot outweighs its po
tential risks, or that the placebo ef
fect of laetrile justifies its cost, or that
the use of cigarettes and alcohol is
worth the risk, then society should
not impose its own arbitrary balance.
Both liberals and conservatives
should unite to fight Big Brother on
these issues. The Big Brother that
protects us from marijuana by
poisoning it is the same Big Brother
that protects us from laetrile by forc
ing us to pay exorbitant prices for it
in other countries. Unfortunately,
what we really need protection from
is Big Brother.
