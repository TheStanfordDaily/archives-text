# Daily not objective

I could only shake my head in dis
belief to pick up Monday's Daily (April
10) and find yet another Daily attempt
to attack SOC and the SOC slate with
utter disregard for the editorial fair
ness and "objective" perspective it
purports to maintain.
I am not going to try here to dis
pute once more the slander that 13
extremely diverse groups can some
how follow one monolithic ideology.
I am not going to respond to the fact
that over eight days of noon-to
midnight workshops, films, forums,
speeches and performances, which
will cover such a broad spectrum that
almost everyone on campus should
find at least a few activities of in
terest, could conceivably be called
"a single event."
The Stanford Organizing Commit
tee's Disorientation Week will speak
for itself. I do not need to defend the
SOC slate for appropriating one cent
per student per day for the biggest
extracurricular program ever to hit
Stanford; as a member of the slate I
felt it was both moral and responsi
ble to help a program which is not
receiving aid from the Hoover Insti
tute, Hewlett Packard, or any other
outside sources . . . and which is
struggling hard to obtain a $10,000
budget, in order to provide activities
to the entire community free of

charge.
I would, however, like t9 ask the
Daily some questions: Why did three
opinion articles attacking SOC and
the left in general appear in one issue
of the Daily, without a discussion of
the other point of view? How can the
Daily call this year's Senate "do
nothing" after all the hard work put
in by senators, both SOC and non-
SOC, on the CI R issue, constitutional
reforms, revamping of the program
fee and budgeting processes, and a
variety of other important issues?
How can Daily editors criticize
SOC for misusing ASSU funds when,
receiving a $10,000 fee assessment,
the Daily repeatedly (and self
admittedly) misrepresents or fails to
represent almost every minority,
women's, gay or just plain progres
sive cultural or political activity on
campus?
Finally, why, how, can you morally
justify having printed Andy
Lundberg's and Dan Livingston's
editorials after the appropriations
issue had been resolved to the satis
faction of the entire senate — and
Lundberg and Livingston — well
ahead of press time, rendering their
articles no longer necessary or accu
rate?
Every competent journalist is
acutely aware that there are two ways

of lying: one is to falsify information;
the other is to leave half the truth
out. I think therecan bea much more
dangerous threat on campus than
this year's progressive ASSU gov
ernment — that is, a one-sided and
sensationalistic editorial staff like the
one we have had this year.
(David Catanzarite, an ASSU
senator, identifies himself as a radi
cal hippie pinko robot who takes or
ders directly from Moscow.)
(Editor's note: This column, received
Monday afternoon, was the first mail
we received supporting the SOC al
location.
Regarding Lundberg and
Livingston's columns, the Daily does
not remove an article from considera
tion for publication unless the author
requests it. Livingston did telephone
the Daily with this request, but the
message was accidentally not re
ceived by the proper editor before
press time. We apologize for this er
ror.
Lundberg said he had been under
the impression that since his column
didn't appear Friday it would not be
published, but this was not verified
with any editor. Both Livingston and
Lundberg have since said they
nevertheless stand by their col
umns.)
