# Advising system surveyed
## 
### Monika Guttman 
A recent ASSU survey asking stu
dents to evaluate the advising system
at the University, has "already done
some good," according to ASSU co
president Greg Larson.
"There is nothing new in this sur
vey," Larson said. "Advising is widely
recognized as a major problem. But
this survey is a significant step in that
it finally pinpoints what students are
unhappy about and what they want."
The survey was distributed late in
February to 300 randomly selected
sophomore, junior, senior and co
terminal students. Persons polled
were asked to rate the value of vari
ous aspects of advising at the Univer
sity on a scale of one to seven.
Overall, students were most satis
fied with major advising, which re
ceived a 4.6 rating. Second year gen
eral advising for undeclared majors
received 3.5, and first year general
advising was rated 3.05.
On the basis of the survey results,
Larson said he and the ASSU Advis
ing Committee plan to make con
crete suggestions to the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies for
improving the advising system.
"One thing I would like to see is
more emphasis on advising by both
the students and the University,"
said Carol Finney, a member of the
ASSU Advising Committee and fa
culty subcommittee on advising. "At
best, advising is now seen as 'some
thing you have to do.' "
"We'll probably be recommend
ing something financial," said Lar
son, "for example financial compen
sation for advisers."
University officials have not re
viewed the results of the survey or
the ASSU recommendations, and
were unable to comment at this time.
The survey showed students want
their advisers to help "solve
academic problems" and to "serve as
an intellectual role model."
Students also indicated thev want
advisers "to share knowledge about
Stanford's programs and policies"
