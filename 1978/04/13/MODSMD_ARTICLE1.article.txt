# Advising system surveyed
## 
### Monika Guttman 
A recent ASSU survey asking stu
dents to evaluate the advising system
at the University, has "already done
some good," according to ASSU co
president Greg Larson.
"There is nothing new in this sur
vey," Larson said. "Advising is widely
recognized as a major problem. But
this survey is a significant step in that
it finally pinpoints what students are
unhappy about and what they want."
The survey was distributed late in
February to 300 randomly selected
sophomore, junior, senior and co
terminal students. Persons polled
were asked to rate the value of vari
ous aspects of advising at the Univer
sity on a scale of one to seven.
Overall, students were most satis
fied with major advising, which re
ceived a 4.6 rating. Second year gen
eral advising for undeclared majors
received 3.5, and first year general
advising was rated 3.05.
On the basis of the survey results,
Larson said he and the ASSU Advis
ing Committee plan to make con
crete suggestions to the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies for
improving the advising system.
"One thing I would like to see is
more emphasis on advising by both
the students and the University,"
said Carol Finney, a member of the
ASSU Advising Committee and fa
culty subcommittee on advising. "At
best, advising is now seen as 'some
thing you have to do.' "
"We'll probably be recommend
ing something financial," said Lar
son, "for example financial compen
sation for advisers."
University officials have not re
viewed the results of the survey or
the ASSU recommendations, and
were unable to comment at this time.
The survey showed students want
their advisers to help "solve
academic problems" and to "serve as
an intellectual role model."
Students also indicated thev want
advisers "to share knowledge about
Stanford's programs and policies"
r O '
and to give them guidance in making
decisions.
"The students probably expect too
much and therefore have unreason
able demands," Larson said. "Even
the president of the University
doesn't know everything about the
programs and policies."
Larson said he feels that there has
to be a better flow of communica
tion. This could be achieved by in
stituting a requirement that forces
students "to look at their broader
educational goals, both when they
first arrive and when they declare a
major," he added.
This could be accomplished, ac
cordingto Larson, by requiringa new
student to tentatively plan his
courses for the next two years when
he arrives at orientation. Before the
adviser signs the study list, the stu
dent and the adviser should discuss
the schedule.
"In this way, they could both ex

change expectations," said Larson,
"and discuss broader educational
goals."
Part of the problem with the cur
rent advising system is that some
students don't make an effort to seek
out their adviser, according to the
survey.
"You can't say which came first, a
low rating of the system on the part
of the students, or a low effort to
seek out advising," Larson said. "But
they do seem to move together."
Larson added that the committee
plans to emphasize peer advising in

its recommendations because 63 per
cent of those students polled said
they had placed upperclassmen into
some sort of an advisory role, while
60 per cent said they had asked a
friend or roommate for advice.
"Our fear is that, for the most part,
this current peer advising is un
trained," Larson said.
"The office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies is making definite
efforts to improve the advising sys
tem," Larson said. "But when it
comes to money or effort, they don't
really know if it's worth the change."

University officials have not re
viewed the results of the survey or
the ASSU recommendations, and
were unable to comment at this time.
The survey showed students want
their advisers to help "solve
academic problems" and to "serve as
an intellectual role model."
Students also indicated thev want
advisers "to share knowledge about
Stanford's programs and policies"
r O '
and to give them guidance in making
decisions.
"The students probably expect too
much and therefore have unreason
able demands," Larson said. "Even
the president of the University
doesn't know everything about the
programs and policies."
Larson said he feels that there has
to be a better flow of communica
tion. This could be achieved by in
stituting a requirement that forces
students "to look at their broader
educational goals, both when they
first arrive and when they declare a
major," he added.
This could be accomplished, ac
cordingto Larson, by requiringa new
student to tentatively plan his
courses for the next two years when
he arrives at orientation. Before the
adviser signs the study list, the stu
dent and the adviser should discuss
the schedule.
"In this way, they could both ex

change expectations," said Larson,
"and discuss broader educational
goals."
Part of the problem with the cur
rent advising system is that some
students don't make an effort to seek
out their adviser, according to the
survey.
"You can't say which came first, a
low rating of the system on the part
of the students, or a low effort to
seek out advising," Larson said. "But
they do seem to move together."
Larson added that the committee
plans to emphasize peer advising in

its recommendations because 63 per
cent of those students polled said
they had placed upperclassmen into
some sort of an advisory role, while
60 per cent said they had asked a
friend or roommate for advice.
"Our fear is that, for the most part,
this current peer advising is un
trained," Larson said.
"The office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies is making definite
efforts to improve the advising sys
tem," Larson said. "But when it
comes to money or effort, they don't
really know if it's worth the change."
A recent ASSU survey asking stu
dents to evaluate the advising system
at the University, has "already done
some good," according to ASSU co
president Greg Larson.
"There is nothing new in this sur
vey," Larson said. "Advising is widely
recognized as a major problem. But
this survey is a significant step in that
it finally pinpoints what students are
unhappy about and what they want."
The survey was distributed late in
February to 300 randomly selected
sophomore, junior, senior and co
terminal students. Persons polled
were asked to rate the value of vari
ous aspects of advising at the Univer
sity on a scale of one to seven.
Overall, students were most satis
fied with major advising, which re
ceived a 4.6 rating. Second year gen
eral advising for undeclared majors
received 3.5, and first year general
advising was rated 3.05.
On the basis of the survey results,
Larson said he and the ASSU Advis
ing Committee plan to make con
crete suggestions to the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies for
improving the advising system.
"One thing I would like to see is
more emphasis on advising by both
the students and the University,"
said Carol Finney, a member of the
ASSU Advising Committee and fa
culty subcommittee on advising. "At
best, advising is now seen as 'some
thing you have to do.' "
"We'll probably be recommend
ing something financial," said Lar
son, "for example financial compen
sation for advisers."
