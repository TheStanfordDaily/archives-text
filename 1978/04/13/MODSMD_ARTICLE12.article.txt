# Few have collected their $
## Chem lab fees refunded 
### Ben Pollock 
Less than half the members of fall quarter's
Chem 130 class have picked up their lab material
breakage fee refunds.
When the usual prepaid $20 fee was found to
be insufficient to cover costs, the Chemistry
Department levied an additional $5 on each stu
dent. Though reluctantly, nearly all of the 286
students in Chemistry Lecturer lames LuVal
le's "Theory and Practice of Indentifica
tion," paid the fee.
A number of students, however, brought the
matter to the attention of Ombudsman John
Coheen and to Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Halsey Royden. The students said the
extra fee was unfair because they were told the
original $20 fee was the only charge for which
they were responsible.
The dean, with the recommendation of the
ombudsman, instructed the Chemistry Depart
ment to have the Student Accounting Office

refund the additional fee. The department
posted and announced that information in ap
propriate classes. But so far, only 105 students
have picked up their $5 cash refunds.
The Chemistry Department pays 25 per cent of
the broken glassware replacement costs and
students pay the remaining 75 per cent from their
$20 breakage fee. Total cost is divided equally
among the students as it is difficult to place
blame on individual students under the current
bookkeeping system.
Inflation seems to be the primary reason for
the increased costs, according to Curt Wherry,
Chemistry Department administrative officer.
Statistics recently compiled by Wherry indi
cate that over the last three years the average
annual increase of lab materials breakage costs
per student has been 29 per cent. Wherry said
he is working on a proposal to make the fee
system more fair and also to avoid such unex
pected costs.
