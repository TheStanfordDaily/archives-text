COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBILITY
REPORT ON SOUTH AFRICA
SUMMARY OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
1. The Commission voted unanimously to recommend
voting in favor of shareholder resolutions calling for the
adoption of affirmative action as expressed in the
Sullivan Principles (see Section 11. A) to reduce racially
discriminatory barriers in employment in South Africa.
2. The Commission voted unanimously to recommend
voting in favor of shareholder resolutions which call upon
American corporations to refrain from expanding the
scope of their operations in South Africa
3. The Commission voted unanimously to recommend
voting in favor of shareholder resolutions which call upon
American financial institutions to refrain from lending to
any element of South Africa's public sector and from
renewing existing loans to the public sector.
4. The Commission voted unanimously to recommend
voting in favor of shareholder resolutions which call upon
American financial institutions to refrain from expanding
the scope of their loans to the South African private
sector.
5. A majority of eight is predisposed to recommend voting in
favor of shareholder resolutions calling for American
corporations to withdraw from South Africa. It is un
derstood that withdrawal need not be precipitous.
Withdrawal need not occur if at least two of the
following conditions obtain:
a) Announced corporate willingness to work openly for
the abrogation of laws which render the political and
economic system racially discriminatory.
b) Concentration on the production of goods and ser
vices in South Africa which would not be readily
available to the government for repressive purposes.
c) Exceptional corporate progress in recent years in
socially affirmative action in South Africa.
A minority of four does not share the majority
predisposition.
6. The Commission voted unanimously to recommend
adoption of the guidelines of the Trustees of TIAA/CREF
(see Section III) concerning investments in South Africa.
7. The Commission voted unanimously to recommend that
each proxy vote pertaining to South Africa be ac
companied by a letter explaining Stanford's rationale in
casting its vote
(Note: Although all but one recommendation is put forward
unanimously, some Commission members may not sub
scribe to all of the rationale and reasons contained hereafter
to support these recommendations.)
I. UNITED STATES BUSINESS IN SOUTH AFRICA AND
THE ISSUE OF SOCIAL INJURY
The charge to the Commission requires that a deter
mination that a corporation has caused substantial social
injury must precede a recommendation to vote on a
shareholder resolution. This section, therefore, ad
dresses the question: to what extent U.S. firms operating
in South Africa can be said to have caused substantial
social injury.
The Republic of South Africa is by no means the only
country in which large scale, purposeful, and systematic
violations of basic human rights are occurring. However,
it is the most manifest case, in several respects, of a
country whose government policies and practices violate
rules of international law intended to protect individuals
against deprivation of health, safety, or basic freedoms.
The objectional policies and practices include—but are
not limited to:
A. An apparatus of laws, built up quite deliberately over a
period of decades, whose purpose and net effect is
systematic and severe discrimination against certain
racial groups—in this case groups which constitute a
substantial majority of the country's population.
Indeed, Senator Clark has pointed out that "South
Africa is the only country in the world in which men
and women are systematically denied fundamental
freedoms in virtually every sphere of human endeavor
on the sole basis of the color of their skin." (Senator
Dick Clark, Chairman of Subcommittee on African
Affairs, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, New
York Times, Feb 21, 1978 ) The result is an ex
traordinary contrast between the extensive political
rights and enviable economic prosperity enjoyed by
the white ruling group, on the one hand, and the
virtual extinction of political rights and the poverty
experienced by nonwhite groups, on the other hand.
B. Evolution in recent years of the so-called
"Homelands" policy, which would divide South Africa
into a number of ostensibly sovereign (and
economically highly unequal) states, without the
consent of the nonwhite majority Implementation of
the "Homelands" policy threatens millions of Africans
with loss of their citizenship in South Africa, the
country of their birth and one to whose prosperity they
have signally contributed.
C. Laws and regulations governing the migration of black
South African labor from rural to urban areas, the
effect of which is to break up the family life of blacks
on a massive scale.
D. Laws and regulations according highly unequal
treatment to different racially-based trade unions and
thus reinforcing a pattern of racially unequal scales of
pay, conditions of service, etc.
E. Laws and regulations making it extremely difficult for
nonwhite workers to rise, on the basis of experience
and merit, to positions of administrative responsibility
within a private sector enterprise.
The roots of white racism in South Africa long antedate
the arrival of the bulk of American private investment in the
country. More recently, the political factor of Afrikaner
nationalism has continued to mold the structures of racial
discrimination and repression, especially since 1948
It can be said, however, that American and other foreign
based firms have taken advantage of the substantial social
injury primarily caused by the South African government. But
such a conclusion, while correct, is also incomplete.
Foreign firms may be said to cause substantial social
injury in the sense that they have for many years directly and
indirectly contributed to the development and consolidation
of a racially repressive system. The nature and extent of this
contribution varies from one company to another. But among
the contributions which most if not all foreign firms have
made to the substantial social injury already noted are:
A. Provision of large amounts of external investment
capital, desperately needed by a country facing
chronic balance of trade deficits.
B. Provision of advanced technology, organization, and
access to non-South African markets, which has
facilitated the remarkable economic modernization of
the country over the past three decades Economic
modernization has not been, on balance, a socially or
politically liberating influence for nonwhites; on the
contrary it has enabled the government to violate
more efficiently the basic rights of the nonwhite
majority.
C. Direct payment of taxes to the South African
government which can then use these funds to
consolidate its domestic power position.
D. In many instances, the sale of goods and services to
South African government agencies, which rightly
consider these goods and services to be actual or
potential resources for strengthening the regime in
power
E. Past failure openly and directly to challenge the set of
laws rendering the entire political and economic
system racially discriminatory, even when companies
were proclaiming their commitment, when employing
American citizens, to take various forms of racially
affirmative action. We refer here to South African
policies regarding migrant labor, the reference or
pass book, the right to organize trade unions and
political parties, the franchise, and so forth.
F. Past failure to take a visible leadership role as a
progressive force in those areas over which private
firms do have some leeway within existing South
African law —e.g., recruitment of workers, salary and
pay scales, promotion, terms of service, access to
plant facilities, and bargaining arrangements with
nonwhite trade unions.
Not all members of the Commission subscribe to the view
that each of the factors just listed constitutes a corporate

cause of substantial social injury. However, we do concur
that on balance a persuasive case can be made that foreign
corporations contribute in various ways and hence cause
the continuation of a pattern of substantial social injury. We
therefore conclude that proxy resolutions relating to cor
porate activity in South Africa are covered by the "sub
stantial social injury" wording of the Board of Trustees'
recent "Statement on Investment Responsibility."
In making our recommendations, the Commission has
attempted to take into account the likely economic and
noneconomic costs to the University of voting against
management on the resolutions before us. Although there
can never be grounds for certainty on such matters, we do
not foresee any large costs arising from such an action.
II SHAREHOLDER RESOLUTIONS WHICH SEEK TO
MITIGATE SOCIAL INJURY IN SOUTH AFRICA
Most of the shareholder resolutions pertaining to South
Africa can be divided into three basic categories, those
calling for Affirmative Action in South Africa, a
Moratorium on Further Investment in South Africa, and
Corporate Withdrawal from South Africa. The Com
mission's analysis and conclusions are given below for
these respective categories.
A. Affirmative Action
Analysis. In light of our conclusion in Section I, the
Commission feels that U.S. firms operating in South
Africa carry a heavy responsibility for compensatory
action. As long as a corporation remains there, its
responsibility to mitigate social injury requires strong
affirmative action.
Concluslons.The Commission voted unanimously to
recommend voting for shareholder resolutions calling
for the adoption of the Sullivan Principles (listed
below), provided that a clarifying letter accompany
the vote indicating that the principles do not go far
enough in certain important ways. In particular,
corporations should permit employees of all races to
participate fully in all aspects of the employer
employee relationship including collective bargaining,
and corporations should distribute information at
least annually that will permit evaluations of their
affirmative action performance. (See TIAA/CREF
guidelines 2 and 3 in Section III.)
Sullivan Principles
The so-called Sullivan principles include a com
mitment by each corporation to:
1. nonsegregation of the races in all eating, comfort, and
work facilities;
2. equal and fair employment practices for all em
ployees;
3. equal pay for all employees doing equal or com
parable work for the same period of time;
4. the initiation and development of training programs
that will prepare, in substantial numbers, blacks and
other nonwhites for supervisory, administrative,
clerical, and technical jobs;
5. an increase in the number of blacks and other non
whites in management and supervisory positions; and
6. improvement in the quality of employees' lives outside
the work environment in such areas as housing,
transportation, schooling, recreation and health
facilities.
B Moratorium on Further Investment
Analysis. The Commission recognized three im
portant concerning the general issue of
moratorium on further investment in South Africa.
1. Each of the arguments for withdrawal also applies
here (see next subsection) without incurring the
costs associated with withdrawal.
2. A moratorium on further investment is a prudent
course of action to ensure that, at a minimum, no
increase in social injury would occur.
3. The report of the Clark Subcommittee on African
Affairs of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee recommends that U.S. foreign policy
should be changed to actively discourage
American investment in South Africa. (Senator
Dick Clark, "U.S. Corporate Interests in South
Africa," Report to the Committee on Foreign
Relations, Jan., 1978, p. 13 )
Conclusions. The Commission voted unanimously to
recommend voting in favor of shareholder resolutions
which call upon U .S. firms to:
1. Refrain from expanding the scope of their
operations in South Africa;
2. Refrain from expanding the scope of their loans to
the South African private sector;
3. Halt all new loans or the renewal of existing loans
to the South African public sector.
C Withdrawal
Majority Analysis. A number of arguments, taken
together, persuaded eight of the Commission's twelve
members that withdrawal was a reasonable and
appropriate course of action at this time.
1. During the past three decades economic
prosperity has coincided with—and to some
degree been a cause of—greater political
repression of South African blacks. In fact, a
recent study by the Subcommittee on African
Affairs of the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee has concluded that American capital and
credit have played a pivotal role in assisting the
South African government to entrench its policy
of apartheid:
"The role of United States capital and credit in
supporting apartheid is documented in a 2J2
page report on United Stales corporate in
terests in South Africa conducted by the
Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and the
Congressional Research Service.... Its maior
conclusion is that United States corporate
interests have strengthened the economic and
military status quo in South Africa, un
dermining United States foreign policy."
Senator Dick Clark, Subcommittee Chairman,
New York Times, Feb. 21, 1978.
This suggests a serious danger that a strong future
South African economy—its strength enhanced
by the continued presence or expansion of
American firms operating there —will continue !o
have net negative effects for blacks.
The prominent white South African economist,
Francis Wilson, argues cogently against the
conclusion of many Americans that increasing
economic prosperity in South Africa made
possible by foreign investments will lead to the
erosion of apartheid and its abhorrent
corollary, the migratory labor system. "Thus
we conclude with regard to migrant labor that
the impact of economic growth by itself will
not lead to a withering away of the system, but
will serve to entrench It more firmly as the
centerpiece of the apartheid structure and also
to generate a considerable growth In the
number of persons who must move like
shuttles across the productive looms of the
society." (See p. 183 in "The Political Im
plications for Blacks of Economic Changes
Now Taking Place in South Africa," Chap. 7in
L. Thompson and J. Butler [eds ], Change In
Contemporary South Africa, U. of California
Press, Berkeley, 1975.)
The "experiment" in liberalizing the society by
infusing foreign capital into it has been a failure. It
is time openly to recognize this and remedy the
social injury by attempting an alternative approach
that uses the threat and fact of withdrawal as both
a signal of protest and a lever for possible
government change.
2. The past behavior of American firms in South
Africa does not lead us to believe that they have
been a particularly progressive force within their
own operations and within the framework of what
is formally permitted by South African law. This
record, coinciding as it did with considerable
pressure within the United States during the past
decade to engage in more active affirmative
action at home and abroad, leads us to doubt that

Space paid for by News and Publications

substantial improvement will occur in the future
Companies should demonstrate that their internal
practices have actually changed in dramatic ways
before any "progressive force" arguments for
remaining in South Africa are to be given
credibility.
3. Even if a firm operates as a strongly progressive
force within its own sphere of operations, the
larger economic and political system in which it
operates virtually guarantees that the effect of its
example on other employers—and on the
government itself—will be slight indeed A
company needs to declare openly that it cannot
operate responsibly in South Africa unless certain
laws which apply to all black South Africans are
taken off the books or drastically revised Normally
we would not favor a position of requesting a U.S.-
based firm to act as a lobbyist in a foreign country
However, when the laws of that country severely
inhibit certain employment practices to which the
company is formally committed to at home both by
federal law and by its own policy statements, then
we think that a valid case can be made for an
exception to an antilobbying posture. Until
companies are willing openly and directly to
discuss with the government the necessity of
changing its laws regulating race relations, these
firms should not continue to benefit economically
from the enforcement of those law^.
4. It is possible that corporate withdrawal, or even
the announced threat of withdrawal, could send
shock waves through the political as well as the
economic system, given the pivotal importance of
foreign investment as a signal of foreign support
for the South African regime and as an instrument
for its prosperity and structural transformation. It
is further possible that the government might be
persuaded by this act of withdrawal of external
support to alter its domestic racial policies.
Knowing the history of the ruling Nationalist Party
and the very considerable power it wields, we are
not naive enough to claim confidently that with
drawal will lead to desired changes in government
policy, much less to a fundamental change in the
composition of South Africa's rulers. Nonetheless,
the slight possibility of improvement through
external economic leverage is worth exploring
when one considers the virtual certainty that a
continuation of the foreign corporate presence in
South Africa will not lead to desired changes.
5. A withdrawal policy is likely to produce social
injury for South African blacks in the sense that
many of the 70,000 blacks currently working for
U.S. subsidiaries would face unemployment. This
negative consequence cannot be lightly
dismissed. Nonetheless, we find it significant that
a large number of prominent black South Africans
have called for withdrawal in spite of the ex
pected economic hardships. According to the
white South African editor (who recently fled),
Donald Woods, "Those who oppose economic
sanctions on the grounds of attendant economic
hardship to blacks should take note of the fact
that the most authentic black spokesmen in South
Africa have consistently stated that they would
prefer such hardship to a continuation of a policy
they regard as a negation of their numanity in
every facet of their lives." (Address to the
Security Council of the United Nations, Jan. 28,
1978.) I*ii \J.)
Shortly before his death in police custody, Steve
Biko noted that "While it is illegal for us to call for
trade boycotts, arms embargo, withdrawal of
investments, etc., America herself is quite free to
decide what price South Africa must pay for
maintaining obnoxious policies." (New York
Times, Sept. 18,1977.)
Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, a long-time black hold-out
in supporting foreign investment, indicated a
change in his thinking following Biko's death and
other recent events: "Sanctions are better than
blood and the stage has now been reached where
people should support such action which they did
not do before; while we know that sanctions will
hurt blacks more than whites, we would rather
accept this hardship than continue to suffer
wholesale arrests." (Durham Daily News quoted
in Tanzania Daily News, Nov. 5,1977.)
6. Withdrawal would reduce vested American
economic interests in the South African status
quo, thereby freeing American foreign policy to
exert more effective pressure on the South African
government to undertake significant changes.
Recognizing that a proxy issue calling for cor
porate withdrawal from South Africa is not likely to
pass at this time, and that voluntary withdrawal
also is unlikely currently, the practical effect of
Stanford University voting for withdrawal must be
considered. This leads to the following additional
rationale for such a vote.
7. Even if withdrawal does not result, voting for
withdrawal is the most effective means to convey
the most frequently expressed opinion within the
Stanford community, and for communicating to
the company our sense that more urgent attention
should be devoted to its social responsibilities
regarding South Africa.
At the open forum held by the Commission on
Investment Responsibility on March 6, 1978, 27
individuals from every major segment of the
Stanford community (student, faculty, staff,
alumni) chose to speak. Without exception, every
speaker called for either U.S. corporate with
drawal from South Africa or what they viewed as
even stronger action (e.g., Stanford divestment of
stock in companies active in South Africa).
The Board should note that what is significant here
is that while different opinions and views are being
expressed on the campus, there does appear to be
unanimous support for taking a meaningful stand
in opposition to apartheid. Support for withdrawal
proposals communicates a message to com
panies, especially to those companies that are
"doing business as usual" in South Africa and not
evidencing any effort towards being a progressive
force.
8. From the evidence and opinion presented to us,
we do not believe that a vote for withdrawal is
likely to have an important negative impact on
Stanford University. Nor does it seem that with
drawal would have an important adverse effect on
the value of the stock of most American firms
operating in South Africa, as the total of these
firms' sales and profits derived from South Africa
is usually under 1%,
It is important that the Commission taKe such cost
factors into account when making its recom
mendation. We have done so in this case and
conclude that the costs are not likely to be suf
ficiently large to raise questions about a possible
violation of the Board's fiduciary obligations in the
event of a vote against management.
Majority Conclusions. Eight of the Commission's
members listed below are predisposed to recommend voting
in favor of shareholder resolutions calling for the withdrawal
of corporate assets from South Africa. However, we do not
see withdrawal as an unconditional imperative. If a company
meets at least two of the following three conditions, a
plausible case can be made for remaining in South Africa:
1. Announced corporate willingness to work openly
for the abrogation of laws which render the
political and economic system racially
discriminatory.
2. Concentration on the production of goods and
services in South Africa which would not be readily
available to the government for repressive pur
poses.
3. Exceptional corporate progress in recent years in
socially affirmative action in South Africa.
Withdrawal need not be precipitous. A company can

announce its intention to phase out operations over a period
of years. Indeed, such an announcement, coupled with
action to indicate that the company is serious in its in
tentions, has the practical advantage of enabling the
company to influence South African government policy more
effectively than a policy of selling quickly to foreign or South
African investors.
We see only an apparent-not a real-conflict between the
objective of withdrawal and the objective of affirmative
action. As long as a company remains in South Africa, it
should be expected to adhere to the Sullivan Principles, and
in fact, to go beyond them in treating different racially based
unions in the same manner. At the same time, it can be made
clear that the company does not intend to remain for long in
South Africa, given the larger system of racial discrimination
from which it benefits and to which, by its continued
presence, it contributes If the economic costs of affirmative
action are high, these could be valid reasons for ac
celerating the schedule of withdrawal; they need not be used
as reasons to remain in South Africa indefinitely.

Minority Statement.
The four minority members do not share the majority's
predisposition to recommend voting in favor of shareholder
resolutions calling for withdrawal from South Africa. Several
reasons support our conclusion.
First, we prefer to judge each resolution independently
and to determine the question of support of withdrawal on
the basis of individual facts rather than adopt a general
policy direction.
Second, the effects of corporate withdrawal are highly
speculative, and we are not persuaded that the results
predicted by the majority's analysis will occur. It is possible
that withdrawal would work against some of the changes
that all twelve members of the Commission agree are
desirable. We fear such adverse consequences of with
drawal as further isolation of South Africa from internal
pressures for improvement and the elimination of jobs and
educational and training opportunities provided to black
employees by American companies.
Third, we disagree with the position that withdrawal would
necessarily enable United States foreign policy to exert
more effective pressure on the South African government.
To the contrary, the presence in South Africa of U.S. firms
promoting change could give added incentive for U.S.
foreign policy to work more aggressively for improvements
in South Africa. U.S. foreign policy need not be blind, gun
boat diplomacy supporting U.S. firms no matter what their
conduct; United States foreign policy and corporate action
could function together progressively.
The extent to which U.S. corporations can induce a
significant change in South Africa is, like the majority's
conclusions, highly speculative. We do not endorse the
notion that American businesses have been a progressive
force in South Africa to date. We believe, nevertheless, that
positive efforts should be undertaken and that serious
adoption and implementation of the guidelines the Com
mission is recommending provides an important first step.
While the minority cannot in good conscience recommend
a general policy of withdrawal, we are concerned about
effective representations to management of Stanford's
position on the conduct of businesses in South Africa. We
think voting to abstain on a withdrawal resolution is more
likely to prompt a positive response from management than
a vote for withdrawal, which many corporate leaders may
dismiss as premature or ill considered.
Votes of absention are not votes in favor of management,
and they can receive considerable attention when ac
companied by an explanatory letter. We note, too, that by
including in Stanford's explanatory letter the recom
mendation on limiting further investment in South Africa
management cannot fail to understand the seriousness of
Stanford's intention.
Although we do not share the majority's general
predisposition, we may well support withdrawal in specific
instances if the circumstances, in our judgment, warrant it.

Robert M. Levison, and Elizabeth Stevenson.
11l ADOPTION OF TIAA/CREF GUIDELINES
The Commission reviewed each of the guidelines
adopted by the Trustees of TIAA/CREF on March 15,
1978 and voted unanimously, by separate vote on each
item, to recommend that the Board of Trustees adopt
these guidelines.
In arriving at this decision, the Commission did not simply
adopt a convenient, prepared list. Vigorous debate of the
issues preceded our consideration of the TIAA/CREF
guidelines, and in the end, we were unanimously satisfied
that each of these guidelines, listed below, accurately
expressed our conclusions.
1. Portfolio corporations active in South Africa should
affirmatively take steps to reduce discriminatory
barriers and should strive to eliminate the economic
and social inequalities that have resulted from such
discrimination.
2. Such corporations should be cooperative and
responsive in meeting South African employees'
needs for mechanisms that promote communications
between employees and corporate management.
Such mechanisms should apply equally to employees
of all races and should also permit employees to
participate in all aspects of the employer-employee
relationship.
3. Each such corporation should at least annually
develop and distribute comprehensive information
that will permit evaluations of the corporation's ac
complishments and future ability to meet the
responsibilities associated with the conduct of
business in South Africa.
4. At the present time, South African government racial
policies are so aggressively discriminatory that
corporations should refrain from making additional
investment or otherwise expanding the scope of their
operations in that country.
5. No such corporation or financial institution should
expand the scope of its loans to the South African
private sector.
6. As the South African government has accepted
racism as official policy, no funds should be loaned to
any element of that country's public sector, nor
should extant loans be renewed.
IV. THE DIVESTMENT ISSUE
One of Stanford's options is to divest itself of some or all
of the University's securities in companies doing
business in South Africa. Proponents of this option within
the Stanford community have presented at least three
supporting arguments:
Argument I—Divestment would drive the price of the
stock down and thereby place economic pressure on the
company to change its policies regarding South Africa.
Commission Conclusion: Available evidence suggests
that any such impact on stock price is likely to be
negligible and temporary. (J.G. Simon, C.W Powers, and
J.P. Gunnemann, The Ethical Investor, Yale University
Press, New Haven, 1972, pp. 53, 91, 140.)
Argument 2—Divestment is the action which attracts
the most attention in the news media, and therefore is the
most effective in generating public awareness and
pressure for change.
Commission Conclusion: Even putting aside questions
of whether such modes of social advocacy are ap
propriate for institutions such as Stanford, it is debatable
whether such a one-shot action would be more effective
in the long run than continuing to apply pressure from
within as a major and prestigious stockholder of the
affected companies.
Argument 3—lt is unconscionable and demeaning to an
institution of world-wide repute dedicated to the pursuit of
knowledge and the betterment of mankind to maintain the
intimate relationship with apartheid implied by in
vestments in companies doing business in South Africa.
Commission Conclusion: We respect the moral force
supporting this argument. In (act, we feel that Stanford's
educational mission in training future leaders of society
places a special obligation upon us to demonstrate that
strong ethical standards have an important central role in
our institutional decision-making.
The Commission believes, however, that using Stanford's
proper role as an investor to exert influence on cor
porations for the correction of an injurious social
situation is a wholly justified moral position. The Com
mission felt that the ineffectiveness of divestment as a
tool for change might render such action to be a mere
washing of hands over the issue, a posture we found
disagreeable.
In addition to considering the arguments presented for
divestment, the Commission is mindful of the findings of
the Massy Report concerning the very substantial
financial impact on Stanford of complete divestment of
stock in companies active in South Africa.
Although the Commission unanimously chose not to
recommend divestment at this time, this option remains
open for future use should circumstances warrant such
action.

Summary of Trustee actions
Following is a news summary of the Board of
Trustees actions on proxy issues April 11:
In a series of stock proxy votes, the Stanford Board of
Trustees Tuesday, April 11, opposed U.S. corporate ex
pansion in South Africa and loans to the South African
government or its agencies
The board took no position on U.S. bank loans to private
corporations in South Africa
Specifically, the Board:
• Unanimously supported shareholder proposals
backing the so-called Sullivan principles for equal em
ployment opportunity and affirmative action in South Africa
The proxy involves Motorola, in which Stanford holds 500
shares.
• Voted 15-8, with one abstention, in favor of

theid This proxy issue arose in two companies: U.S. Steel, in
which Stanford has 2,400 shares; and Union Carbide, 59,700

• Voted 13-8 to abstain on Bank of America shareholder
proposals opposing any new loans or renewal to the South

ment or its agencies, but taking no position on loans to

Life Insurance shareholder proposals concerning redlining,
sending a letter to management opposing redlining and
urging the company to pursue industry self regulation

• Voted 20-3 in favor of American Home Products
shareholder proposals asking for creation of an internal
committee to review the company's promotional practices
on infant formulas Stanford has 300 shares in this firm

Citicorp calling for detailed information on South African
loans. The bank already has announced a policy of making
no balance of-payment loans to South Africa and no loans to
the South African government or its agencies The board
regarded the information requested by the shareholder
proposal as excessive Stanford owns 300 shares.
In five of its seven proxy votes, the Trustees followed
recommendations from the Commission on Investment
Responsibility On Bank of America, the CIR had recom
mended a vote against management. CIR has made no
recommendation on Citicorp
The board accepted the commission's report on South
African investment policy with thanks and said its policy
recommendations will be used as a working document in
consideration of specific proxy issues in the future
In keeping with CIR recommendations, the Trustees will
send each corporation a letter explaining the rationale for its
vote.
The CIR unanimously opposed U.S. corporate expansion
in South Africa and voted 8-4 in favor of U.S. corporate
withdrawal there over time No proxy issue before the board
specifically addressed the latter issue.
The CIR also unanimously opposed Stanford divestment
of its $125 million in U S firms active in South Africa,
unanimously opposed any loans or renewals to the South
African government or its agencies, and unanimously op
posed any expansion of loans to the private sector in South
Africa.
In its report on Connecticut General, the CIR said "Our
recommendation that the Board, . abstain reflects our
concern that arbitrary underwriting practices resulting in
redlining should not continue, but there was no clear
evidence on either side demonstrating that such practices
by Connecticut General are or are not occuring "
The Trustees did not accept the ClR's suggestion that the
board send a letter to sponsors of the shareholder proposal
specifying this rationale for the University's vote and en
couraging them to continue their efforts to seek industry
wide solutions to the problems of redlining.
