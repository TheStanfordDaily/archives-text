# Aqua Follies returns to Lag
## 
### Monika Guttman 
The Aqua Follies are back
this spring! On Sunday, April
16, Lake Lagunita's return will
be celebrated with such events
as a water ski show, inter
dormitory competition, con
certs by the Stanford Band and
the Mendicants, concessions
and hopefully sun.
Proceeds arising from con
cession stands and entry fees
for competition events will be
donated to the Stanford Chil
dren's hospital.
The Follies will be like an
all-day carnival, according to
Peter McKenna, co-ordinator
of the event which is co
sponsored by the ASSU and
the Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC). jugglers and musicians
will abound.
There will be three trick
water skiiers, and kite skiiers as
well. Kite skiiers hold on to a
hang-gliding kite which is at
tached to a boat. The skiier is
lifted out of the water, and
when he is as high as he is wil
ling to go, he drops the rope
and lands in the water. This
maneuver is quite dangerous
in heavy wind, so the perfor
mance may have to be cancel
led.
The Hot Air Balloon club will
also be there if the wind is right
to sell 25 cent rides in a bal
loon.
Other possible attractions
include car smashing and a
dunking machine. According
to Clark Callander, events
coordinator of the Follies,
there have been difficulties in

finding faculty and administra
tive volunteers, big crowd
drawers, for the dunking
booth. But he said he expects
that student politicians will be
money-makers themselves.
Finally, the Coast Guard is
planning to demonstrate water
rescue techniques and
helicopter maneuvers. The
helicopter will be on display on
Roble field from noon to 3 pm
on Sunday.
Various organizations and
living groups will compete in
log rolling and greased
watermelon contests as well as
tug-o-war, and canoe races and
jousts . Reid Butler, president
of the IFC, said that still more
teams can be accommodated.
"There will be a certain
amount of spontaneity," Butler
said. "We want to get the

whole community involved."
Butler, who saw Aqua Follies
in the past, said the Follies
seemed "a natural thing to do"
once the lake had filled.
"But it was too big for the
fraternities to handle on their
own, and consequently the
ASSU has become very in
volved," he said.
The Aqua Follies origi
nated in the 1920's as part of a
benefit week for Children's
Hospital. The hospital used to
be called "Con-Home" be
cause it served mainly as a con
valescent home for children.
At the end of "Con-Home
Week," a week of events speci
fically for the children of
Con-Home, University stu
dents would have one day of
events on the lake as a grand
finale.
Today Children's Hospital

specializes in pediatric oncol
ogy, which treats such diseases
as cancer and hemophilia. Ac
cording to Vicki Applegate, di
rector of Community Relations
at the hospital, no child is ever
turned away because they can
not afford services. Extra costs
are absorbed by the hospital.
The Aqua Follies have bene
fited other groups in the past as
well. In 1975, opticon units
were purchased for blind stu
dents here.
The Follies, which will last
from approximately 12 noon to
6:30 p.m. promises to be an af
ternoon of fun and entertain
ment for the entire commun
ity.
"It's fun when a lot of people
get together, drinking
and just being kinda crazy,"
said Butler.

Bob Bernstein, co-ordinator of the water-skiing show at the Aqua Follies, demonstrates what he himself
will perform in the show.
The Aqua Follies are back
this spring! On Sunday, April
16, Lake Lagunita's return will
be celebrated with such events
as a water ski show, inter
dormitory competition, con
certs by the Stanford Band and
the Mendicants, concessions
and hopefully sun.
Proceeds arising from con
cession stands and entry fees
for competition events will be
donated to the Stanford Chil
dren's hospital.
The Follies will be like an
all-day carnival, according to
Peter McKenna, co-ordinator
of the event which is co
sponsored by the ASSU and
the Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC). jugglers and musicians
will abound.
There will be three trick
water skiiers, and kite skiiers as
well. Kite skiiers hold on to a
hang-gliding kite which is at
tached to a boat. The skiier is
lifted out of the water, and
when he is as high as he is wil
ling to go, he drops the rope
and lands in the water. This
maneuver is quite dangerous
in heavy wind, so the perfor
mance may have to be cancel
led.
The Hot Air Balloon club will
also be there if the wind is right
to sell 25 cent rides in a bal
loon.
Other possible attractions
include car smashing and a
dunking machine. According
to Clark Callander, events
coordinator of the Follies,
there have been difficulties in

finding faculty and administra
tive volunteers, big crowd
drawers, for the dunking
booth. But he said he expects
that student politicians will be
money-makers themselves.
Finally, the Coast Guard is
planning to demonstrate water
rescue techniques and
helicopter maneuvers. The
helicopter will be on display on
Roble field from noon to 3 pm
on Sunday.
Various organizations and
living groups will compete in
log rolling and greased
watermelon contests as well as
tug-o-war, and canoe races and
jousts . Reid Butler, president
of the IFC, said that still more
teams can be accommodated.
"There will be a certain
amount of spontaneity," Butler
said. "We want to get the

whole community involved."
Butler, who saw Aqua Follies
in the past, said the Follies
seemed "a natural thing to do"
once the lake had filled.
"But it was too big for the
fraternities to handle on their
own, and consequently the
ASSU has become very in
volved," he said.
The Aqua Follies origi
nated in the 1920's as part of a
benefit week for Children's
Hospital. The hospital used to
be called "Con-Home" be
