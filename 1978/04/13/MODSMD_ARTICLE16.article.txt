## Stanford-in-Greece program Greek study and fun offered 
### Jean Kimmel 
Have you ever dreamed of
standing at the top of the Ac
ropolis under a full moon or
climbing a volcanic mountain
to view the turquoise-blue Ae
gean Sea around you?
Six lucky students may do so
each summer through the
Classics department's
Stanford-in-Greece program.
"The program consists of six
weeks of intense travel during
the summer. The main pur
pose is to see the art and ar
chaeology," said Lisa Heidorn,
who attended the program last
year.
Tresidder grant
Professor Antony
Raubitschek started the prog
ram seven years ago using the
stocks and bonds donated to
the program by a Tresidder
grant. Each student is sub
sidized for the entire trip ex
cept for the airplane flight to
and from Athens. The subsidy
includes room, board and
intra-Greece transportation.
No tuition is charged to stu
dents.
The number of students in
the program is kept to a
minimum because "We want a
quality experience for those
students who go," said Mark
Edwards, chairman of the Clas
sics department. "If there are
more interested than we can
take, we choose those whom
we think will benefit best from
the experience."
Interest
The trip is not limited to just
Classics majors. "The main re
quirement is interest, a desire

to participate," said Mike Glaf
kides, a participant in the 1977
trip.
Non-classics majors should
have some background, and
could in preparation take such
classes as Ancient Creek,
Greek art and Greek history,
Glafkides said. Some classes
are required for those who are
chosen, including Greek To
pography and Monuments and
Modern Greek.
Students are not expected to
be fluent in Modern Greek, but
of course the group leaders
are, according to Heidorn.
Athens
The trip begins each summer
when the students and their
leader meet in Athens. Ac
commodations are in a small
hotel. "We hope someday to
own a house for the Stanford
in-Greece program," said
Raubitschek.
The group spends one week
studying Athens itself. "I dis
liked Athens, it is too rushed
and too touristy," said
Heidorn.
After Athens, the group
travels around most of south
ern Greece, seeing a minimum
of one archaeological site a
day. Trips to nearby islands
such as Mykonos, Delos and
Aegina are also on the agenda.
"The six weeks were jammed
with travels. I'm amazed we did
all that we did," said Glafkides.
Art and architecture
The emphasis of the prog
ram is on art and architecture,
and some students said that
there was not enough contact
with people outside the group.

"It is not the greatest way to
experience Greek culture be
cause you are travelling so
much and so intimately with
the group," Heidorn said.
Most of the sightseeing is
done in the mornings because
of the hot afternoon sun.
Rugged
Even though tourism is a big
business in Greece, the coun
try is still quite rural and rug
ged. "Inordertogettomany of
the archaeological sites we had
to climb dusty mountain roads
that the goat herders still use.
But seeing the site was well
worth the effort it took to get
there in the head," said .Deb
Byron, who went on the 1973
trip.
"My favorite part was the is
land trips, especially the trip to
Crete. The water of the Aegean
was so warm. We sunbathed
every day," Heidorn said.
Before the trip, each student
researches a particular ar
chaeological site or work of art.
Thus each student is able to
lead the group for a day at
"his" site.
"I researched Delphi, the
Olympic stadium of Zeus, be
fore the trip. It was such a thrill
to actually see it. Me and my
buddy raced a couple of Yugos
lavs around the stadium and
won," Glafkides said.
Living in Greece is relatively
inexpensive. The food is
cheap, but some students said
it took some getting used to
both it and the drinks. Other
students, particularly those of
Greek ancestry, had no prob
lems.

"The food was delicious. We
took turns ordering dinner in
Creek. Exotic dishes such as
squid or octopus cost only $4
per person. We always had
wine with every dinner; it is
good for the digestion," Glaf
kides said.
"I wish we had longer," said
Heidorn.
"I would love to back,"
said Byran.

fore the trip. It was such a thrill
to actually see it. Me and my
buddy raced a couple of Yugos
lavs around the stadium and
won," Glafkides said.
Living in Greece is relatively
inexpensive. The food is
cheap, but some students said
it took some getting used to
both it and the drinks. Other
students, particularly those of
Greek ancestry, had no prob
lems.

"The food was delicious. We
took turns ordering dinner in
Creek. Exotic dishes such as
squid or octopus cost only $4
per person. We always had
wine with every dinner; it is
good for the digestion," Glaf
kides said.
"I wish we had longer," said
Heidorn.
"I would love to back,"
said Byran.
Have you ever dreamed of
standing at the top of the Ac
ropolis under a full moon or
climbing a volcanic mountain
to view the turquoise-blue Ae
gean Sea around you?
Six lucky students may do so
each summer through the
Classics department's
Stanford-in-Greece program.
"The program consists of six
weeks of intense travel during
the summer. The main pur
pose is to see the art and ar
chaeology," said Lisa Heidorn,
who attended the program last
year.
Tresidder grant
Professor Antony
Raubitschek started the prog
ram seven years ago using the
stocks and bonds donated to
the program by a Tresidder
grant. Each student is sub
sidized for the entire trip ex
cept for the airplane flight to
and from Athens. The subsidy
includes room, board and
intra-Greece transportation.
No tuition is charged to stu
dents.
The number of students in
the program is kept to a
minimum because "We want a
quality experience for those
students who go," said Mark
Edwards, chairman of the Clas
sics department. "If there are
more interested than we can
take, we choose those whom
we think will benefit best from
the experience."
Interest
The trip is not limited to just
Classics majors. "The main re
quirement is interest, a desire

to participate," said Mike Glaf
kides, a participant in the 1977
trip.
Non-classics majors should
have some background, and
could in preparation take such
classes as Ancient Creek,
Greek art and Greek history,
Glafkides said. Some classes
are required for those who are
chosen, including Greek To
pography and Monuments and
Modern Greek.
Students are not expected to
be fluent in Modern Greek, but
of course the group leaders
are, according to Heidorn.
Athens
The trip begins each summer
when the students and their
leader meet in Athens. Ac
commodations are in a small
hotel. "We hope someday to
own a house for the Stanford
in-Greece program," said
Raubitschek.
The group spends one week
studying Athens itself. "I dis
liked Athens, it is too rushed
and too touristy," said
Heidorn.
After Athens, the group
travels around most of south
ern Greece, seeing a minimum
of one archaeological site a
day. Trips to nearby islands
such as Mykonos, Delos and
Aegina are also on the agenda.
"The six weeks were jammed
with travels. I'm amazed we did
all that we did," said Glafkides.
Art and architecture
The emphasis of the prog
ram is on art and architecture,
and some students said that
there was not enough contact
with people outside the group.

"It is not the greatest way to
experience Greek culture be
cause you are travelling so
much and so intimately with
the group," Heidorn said.
Most of the sightseeing is
done in the mornings because
of the hot afternoon sun.
Rugged
Even though tourism is a big
business in Greece, the coun
try is still quite rural and rug
ged. "Inordertogettomany of
the archaeological sites we had
to climb dusty mountain roads
that the goat herders still use.
But seeing the site was well
worth the effort it took to get
there in the head," said .Deb
Byron, who went on the 1973
trip.
"My favorite part was the is
land trips, especially the trip to
Crete. The water of the Aegean
was so warm. We sunbathed
every day," Heidorn said.
Before the trip, each student
researches a particular ar
chaeological site or work of art.
Thus each student is able to
lead the group for a day at
"his" site.
"I researched Delphi, the
Olympic stadium of Zeus, be
fore the trip. It was such a thrill
to actually see it. Me and my
buddy raced a couple of Yugos
lavs around the stadium and
won," Glafkides said.
