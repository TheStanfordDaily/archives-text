# Office of state controller race
## 'A tough proposition/ says Arnett 
### Cynthia Lehigh 
Running for a major office in a state like
California is "a tough proposition," ac
cording to Dixon Arnett, representative of
the 20th Assembly District and Republican
candidate for the office of state controller.
Against the backdrop of the Sacramento
skyline outside his Capitol building office,
Arnett leaned back in his cushioned,
swivel chair. On the wall hangs a framed
color picture of Arnett shaking hands with
former President Gerald Ford.
About $1 million and a minimum two
year time committment are needed for a
successful campaign for statewide elec
tion, Arnett said. He estimated about
$800,000 will be spent for television and
radio advertising time.
"It's a long committment, a tough prop
osition," the tall, slender and slightly bald
man of 40 commented. "Especially when,
as in my case, you're running against an
incumbent."
Arnett said he plans to run a "largely
bipartisan campaign" that will focus, at
least in the early stages, on what he calls
the faults of his opponent, incumbent

Democrat Kenneth Cory.
"He and I are very different people â€”
what motivates us, our ideas about what
the controller's office should be, could
be," he said slowly, carefully weighing
every word.
Arnett is confident that he will be able to
swing a large number of Democratic votes
because, he says, Cory "has become a
stain on the conscience of the Democratic
Party.
"His political activities finally reached
the point of political arrogance," Arnett
contended, citing Cory's acceptance of
nearly $600,000 during his 1974 campaign
from two Orange County businessmen,
Richard O'Neill and Dr. Louis Cella )r.
Cella has since been convicted of Medi
care fraud.
"A substantial amount of the money he
(Cella) gave Cory was embezzeled," Ar
nett continued, calling the scandal
"California's own mini-Watergate."
Arnett also charged Cory with "bringing
back the spoils system" by appointing re
latives of campaign contributors to lucra
tive positions as inheritance tax referees.

If elected controller, Arnett promises to
make the exams for the tax referee jobs
much more difficult. He said he will try to
change the inheritance tax law itself to
"lessen reliance on inheritance tax re
ferees" and ultimately reduce the number
of positions.
As the state's chief fiscal officer, Arnett
said, the controller "ought to be a vocal
spokesman on tax questions. ... He
ought to sponsor legislation, testify on
that legislation, go and give speeches, and
make press in an attempt to convince the
people" of his position on tax issues.
Arnett said he feels his political experi
ence qualifies him for the office of control
ler. Eight years after his graduation from
Stanford in 1960, with a degree in political
science, Arnett was elected to the City
Council of Redwood City. He was Director
of Community Relations here when, in
1970, he was first elected to the state As
sembly.
His experience as an Assemblyman, he
said, is especially important because
"when I walk into the controller's office,
I'll know what questions to ask."
