## rock/john nielsen and dave ford Bowie shows his strengths 
### 
Most retrospective concerts are disap
pointing. They generally have an air of frust
ration about them, sometimes of despera
tion; nearly all of the time they inspire a
feeling that the performer is taking it easy,
not working, getting flabby. It is very dif
ficult to sing old favorites in such a way that
the audience does not judge according to
how well the singer or the song mimics the
recordings.
Only a legitimate present-tense star can
bring these things off with genuine intelli
gence, and most present-tense stars don't
have enough material to justify returning to
where they've been for anything other than
the money.
David Bowie's April concert in the Oak
land Coliseum was a striking exception to
this rule. It was by no means simply a run
through of dead or dying hit tunes, in that
most of the first set was devoted to expres
sing things done recently; yet at the same
time it was clear throughout the show that
the performer was attempting to show us
the relationship between his performance
and his past. Bowie was passing judgment
on himself in the Coliseum, and he suc
cessfully managed to do it and still maintain
perspective. He took a few steps back, and
turned the house lights up, and reviewed
what he'd said and done, and he left us with
the distinct impression that he's still alive
and thinking.
The set was stark, metallic, clinical,
dominated by the same two-story block of
neon lights that Bowie had used on his
"Thin White Duke" tour in '76. He entered
with his musicians in a business-like man
ner, with the building still fully lit, and then
paused while all the lights went down (no
thing — even the stage; the place was
completely black). Guitarist Carlos Alomar
took a baton and led the band towards a
precise, increasingly powerful conver
gance on a single note low on the register;
the lights came on as the volume increased
until the stage was encased in white.
And Bowie did some instrumental selec

tions from "Low" that established his dis
tance from where he'd been. He began
rather quietly, with "Warszsma" from that
album, calming the crowd, then carefully
and gradually increased his energy in
movement. He appeared uncomfortable at
first, especially when he wasn't behind his
portable keyboard rig, and used nervous,
stylized gestures to emphasize his vocals.
But once he warmed up, Bowie actually
appeared to be having fun: dressed in
fisherman's windbreakerand brown plastic
pants, he kidded with his band, played to
the audience, smoked cigarettes, and
beamed all the while. During the set clos
ing "Fame" he turned in an especially cal
culated, machine-like disco performance
— Soul Train with starch.
Bowie's recent claim that his return to
touring is a determined effort to fulfill his
commitment to his audience without rely
ing on past pretentions and poses was
borne out by the second set, a faithful run
through of pieces from "Ziggy Stardust."
And Bowie, outfitted this time in white
T-shirt, sailor's pantaloons, and fake
snakeskin maxi coat, showed his strength
here. Every self-respecting fan knows this
album does down to its finest shades of
eye-liner, and with few exceptions (caused
by the band, which from time to time got a
little over-anxious, a little too sloppy)
Bowie performed the material passion
ately, lending the songs a new depth with
the conspicuous absence of their flam
boyant stage characterizations.
No one in rock music has changed so
drastically, so frequently, so deliberately as
Bowie. No one has learned as much from
his past either. If the recent Oakland con
cert did not demonstrate exactly what
Bowie plans to do with himself now that he
has shown that he is more capable than
ever, it did prove that he is a clever, eclectic
performer who is unfailingly able to antici
pate his audience's needs, and so give
them exactly what they want. Which is
exactly what he did.

tion; nearly all of the time they inspire a
feeling that the performer is taking it easy,
not working, getting flabby. It is very dif
ficult to sing old favorites in such a way that
the audience does not judge according to
how well the singer or the song mimics the
recordings.
Only a legitimate present-tense star can
bring these things off with genuine intelli
gence, and most present-tense stars don't
have enough material to justify returning to
where they've been for anything other than
the money.
David Bowie's April concert in the Oak
land Coliseum was a striking exception to
this rule. It was by no means simply a run
through of dead or dying hit tunes, in that
most of the first set was devoted to expres
sing things done recently; yet at the same
time it was clear throughout the show that
the performer was attempting to show us
the relationship between his performance
and his past. Bowie was passing judgment
on himself in the Coliseum, and he suc
cessfully managed to do it and still maintain
perspective. He took a few steps back, and
turned the house lights up, and reviewed
what he'd said and done, and he left us with
the distinct impression that he's still alive
and thinking.
The set was stark, metallic, clinical,
dominated by the same two-story block of
neon lights that Bowie had used on his
"Thin White Duke" tour in '76. He entered
with his musicians in a business-like man
ner, with the building still fully lit, and then
paused while all the lights went down (no
thing — even the stage; the place was
completely black). Guitarist Carlos Alomar
took a baton and led the band towards a
precise, increasingly powerful conver
gance on a single note low on the register;
the lights came on as the volume increased
until the stage was encased in white.
And Bowie did some instrumental selec

tions from "Low" that established his dis
tance from where he'd been. He began
rather quietly, with "Warszsma" from that
album, calming the crowd, then carefully
and gradually increased his energy in
movement. He appeared uncomfortable at
first, especially when he wasn't behind his
portable keyboard rig, and used nervous,
stylized gestures to emphasize his vocals.
But once he warmed up, Bowie actually
appeared to be having fun: dressed in
fisherman's windbreakerand brown plastic
pants, he kidded with his band, played to
the audience, smoked cigarettes, and
beamed all the while. During the set clos
ing "Fame" he turned in an especially cal
culated, machine-like disco performance
— Soul Train with starch.
Bowie's recent claim that his return to
touring is a determined effort to fulfill his
commitment to his audience without rely
ing on past pretentions and poses was
borne out by the second set, a faithful run
through of pieces from "Ziggy Stardust."
And Bowie, outfitted this time in white
T-shirt, sailor's pantaloons, and fake
snakeskin maxi coat, showed his strength
here. Every self-respecting fan knows this
album does down to its finest shades of
eye-liner, and with few exceptions (caused
by the band, which from time to time got a
little over-anxious, a little too sloppy)
Bowie performed the material passion
ately, lending the songs a new depth with
the conspicuous absence of their flam
boyant stage characterizations.
No one in rock music has changed so
drastically, so frequently, so deliberately as
Bowie. No one has learned as much from
his past either. If the recent Oakland con
cert did not demonstrate exactly what
Bowie plans to do with himself now that he
has shown that he is more capable than
ever, it did prove that he is a clever, eclectic
performer who is unfailingly able to antici
pate his audience's needs, and so give
them exactly what they want. Which is
exactly what he did.
