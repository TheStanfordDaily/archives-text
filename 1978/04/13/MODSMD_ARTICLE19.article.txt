## Trio stuns crowd 
### 
From the moment The Beaux
Arts Trio strode on stage in
Dinkelspiel Sunday it was ap
parent that they had no inten
tion of offering the audience
just another leisurely, spring
concert. Their entrance was
brisker than normal, their bow
to the audience more exacting
than normal, and their music
so surpassed generally ac
cepted standards of excellence
that by the end of the first
piece, by Haydn, the capacity
crowd was quite literally stun
ned.
The Trio, pianist Menahem
Pressler, violinist Isodore
Cohen and cellist Bernard
Greenhouse, sensed the vital
interplay in Haydn's "Trio in A
Major" and nurtured it hand
somely. After 21 years of per
formances they have beauti
fully mastered the art of ex
changing the lead, phrase by
phrase and note by note. But
they did not content them
selves with stringing together
melodies. Even the most re
petitive harmony lines sprang
to life, and for measures on
end they drew forth interpreta
tions which came like so many
revelations of what Haydn
must have expected from
seemingly inert parts.
As a result, Haydn sounded
uncommonly complex and en
gaging. And the Trio's pre
sence grew so commanding
that in the midst of the alter
nately funny, sensitive and
bawdy passages one could
even cease to notice the vio
linist's and pianist's somewhat
eccentric habits of raising up
off their chairs and shuffling
their feet.
By contrast, "Trio, Opus 67,"
by Shostakovich, an inherently
complex work, stood out for its
more tangible solos. Of par
ticular note were two cello
solos, the first composed en
tirely of harmonics and the
second, a rich, plaintive piece,
drawn from Russian peasant
music.
At the end of the work, one
was struck by the unyielding
coherence which the Trio kept
throughout the divers solos

and in spite of long pauses be
tween movements for tuning,
necessitated by the heat of the
room.
The program finished with
"Trio in E-flat Major," by
Schubert, which came off as a
fine bit of teamwork, though as
a whole, it lacked some of the
luster of the first two works.
Crescendos and diminuendos
meshed perfectly and at all
times the Trio conserved a feel
ing of balance and unity, de
spite the extreme liberties they
took with the tempo.
The famous second move
ment, "andante con moto,"
was breathtaking, and while
Pressler occasionally lapsed
into uninspired (though tech
nically accurate) piano har
mony, Bernard Greenhouse
once again demonstrated the
subtlety which has brought the
Trio to international fame.
Taken together these three
works made for an hour and a
half of music that defied idle
listening, and royally rewarded
those who attended. Let us
hope that in the next 21 years
The Beaux Arts Trio will remain
as superb.

meshed perfectly and at all
times the Trio conserved a feel
ing of balance and unity, de
spite the extreme liberties they
took with the tempo.
The famous second move
ment, "andante con moto,"
was breathtaking, and while
Pressler occasionally lapsed
into uninspired (though tech
nically accurate) piano har
mony, Bernard Greenhouse
once again demonstrated the
subtlety which has brought the
Trio to international fame.
Taken together these three
works made for an hour and a
half of music that defied idle
listening, and royally rewarded
those who attended. Let us
hope that in the next 21 years
The Beaux Arts Trio will remain
as superb.
