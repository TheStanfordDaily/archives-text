# Hospital chaplain explains role helping patients, medical staff
## 
### Andrea James 
With 60 per cent of its patients
either critically or terminally ill, Stan
ford Hospital needs a chaplain who
can comfort, befriend and advise.
Rev. Ernie Young, who became the
Hospital's first chaplain in 1974, car
ries out his chaplaincy duties with
deep commitment.
Young, a 45-year-old Methodist
who also serves as associate dean at
Memorial Church, works with
Roman Catholic priest John Hester to
"meet the needs of patients, their
families, Hospital staff and medical
students."
In order to meet these needs, it is
often necessary to de-emphasize
denominational factors, Young said.
"We're here to help those people
meet their needs," he noted, speak
ing for the chaplaincy office. "We're
not here to impose our values on
these people or conform these
people to meet our needs.
"Often we must work only as car
ing, supportive persons," he con
tinued. "We have people who come
to Stanford from far and wide. Some
times they'll bring a spouse, but they
don't have any real extended sup
port. It's our job to befriend them, to
be there with them and for them."
At other times, it's up to the chap
lain to answer the "ultimate ques
tion."
"We reinforce the sense that life is
basically good and that the patient's
sickness or upcoming death fits into
the providencial plan," Young said.
"I don't pretend to know that plan; I
have to leave it up to the patient to
find that out for himself."
He added that hope usually plays a
major part in the patient's short re
maining life and he tries to reinforce
that feeling of hope.
"We try to extend the horizons of
hope and comfort the terminally ill
patient through hopes of life
beyond," he said. "We help the pa
tient to find serenity and joy and
show him that death can be a magni
ficent experience, not a degrading
one."
But advice and caring isn't all the
chaplaincy provides. By maintaining
close connections with local clergy,
Young can find accommodations for
patients' families who can't afford to
stay in motels.

"We try to place families in private
homes through local church
parishoners," Young said. "We also
provide local transportation."
Because of donations by thankful
patients or families, a "modest"
treasury has been building up in the
chaplain's office since 1974. With this
fund, the chaplain has been able to
fly some patients' far-away relatives
to Stanford if the relatives are poor.
"We also buy clothing for people
who had to come to the Hospital in
pajamas and can't leave because they
don't have any clothes," Young said.
He added that sometimes money is
used to fly people home if their doc
tors say driving would be too ardu
ous.
"The fund is totally separate from
other Hospital funds," he stressed.
"This way, there's no bureaucratic
red tape to get the money. It's there,
ready to use."
The chaplain's services benefit not
only patients and their families but
staff and medical students as well.
The doctor is often called upon for
personal and marital counseling.
In addition, Young gives occa
sional workshops to hospital groups.
For example, he recently sponsored,
a Hospital Auxiliary workshop on
how to cope with stress. The Au
xiliary operates the Hospital gift shop
and provides comfort to persons
waiting outside intensive care units
or emergency rooms. Hence, the or
ganization must work with persons
under stressful circumstances.
"They're (Auxiliary personnel) de
aling with people who are anxious,
angry or afraid," Young said. "These
people will often take out their feel
ings on the Auxiliary so I gave them
advice on how to help them handle
difficult people."
Young teaches two medical ethics
courses at the Medical School. The
instruction aspect of chaplaincy has
recently been enlarged so that later
this year, a four-week chaplaincy
clerkship will be available at the
Hospital.
"The experience should give the
clerk a look at the holistic care of
patients," Young said. "Sickness is
moie than disease. The psychologi
cal component is a real factor."
With death and other people's
problems surrounding him every

day, how does Young manage to
maintain his own normal life?
"I'm a marathon runner," he
explained. "That's how I keep my
sanity."
The chaplain's office is assisted by
nine volunteers from campus and
the community, including one pro
fessor's wife, graduate students in
counseling, religion or psychology
and one human biology under
graduate.
