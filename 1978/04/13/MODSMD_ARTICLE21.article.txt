Writing about a record of
solo acoustic steel string guitar
music is no easy task. Left
without lyrics to quote and hav
ing the sound of only one in
strument to discuss, the re
viewer usually takes one of
three approaches: 1) Vapid
Abstraction Approach — "the
songs are airy weavings of
chords and melodies; light yet
textured, and deeply emo
tional." 2) Sheer Awe Ap
proach — "A guitarist that
plays this fast could only have
been born with a bizarre gene
tic defect that left him with
three middle fingers on each
hand." 3) Pointless Compari
son Approach — "If you like
Leo Kottke and |ohn Fahey,
you'll love this."
In attempting to avoid all of
this, let it simply be said that
"Turning: Turning Back," the
debut album by Alex DeGrassi
on Windham Hill records, is
one fine piece of solo guitar
music. William Ackerman,
head of Windham Hill and not
a bad picker himself, calls De-
Grassi "the best contemporary
steel string guitar player in
America." An overstatement
perhaps. But perhaps not.
The record is perfect for any
mood. The first side contains
mostly slower, contemplative
pieces, while the second side is
more lively. DeGrassi's
technique and performance
are near perfect throughout.
In listening to the first cut,
"Turning," you will notice that
it sounds pretty much like all
the other steel string music
you've ever heard until the last
few bars, when DeGrassi lets
loose such a flurry of rippling
yet controlled notes that you
realize the guy has a superhu
man right hand, the fastest
you've ever heard, faster than
even Kottke or Fahey . . .
(Damn!) But it's true.

Alex DeGrassi headlined a
fine show at the Tresidder up
stairs lounge Sunday night. Fol
lowing a warmly received
opening set by Australian
singer/songwriter Hans Sven
Poulsen, DeGrassi took the
stage for an hour-long perfor
mance, and while some solo
guitar music pan become tedi

ous after a few songs, his play
ing was consistently interest
ing. Because he utilizes various
modal tuningsthat require him
to tune the guitar often, he
explains that in pacing a show,
"I try and strike a compromise
between playing tunes in suc
cession that have similar tun
ings, while trying to keep a
shift of moods going." This
"compromise" produced an
evenly paced performance that
kept the appreciative audience
attentive throughout.
When DeGrassi is playing,
the listener is faced with two
equally pleasing alternatives.
He can either close his eyes
and enjoy the rich variations of
the music, or he can watch the
guitarist's amazing fingerwork.
An obviously difficult piece
like "Blood and Jasmine," with
its speedy, fluid runs and deli
cate harmonics is made twice
as interesting when one actu
ally sees the performer's left
hand moving almost ef
fortlessly up and down the

neck, his fingers often stretch
ing for notes and positions that
seem impossible to attain.
The show featured all the
songs from "Turning: Turning
Back" and two were particu
larly striking. On "Windows"
and "Children's Dance" he
struck a perfect balance, dis
playing his formidable
technique while sacrificing no
thing to the beautiful
melodies, and the effect was
entrancing.
On improvisational playing,.
DeCrassi comments, "I'm try
ing to get to the point where I
can sit down and improvise
using some themes I've come
up with before, but with no re
gard for where the piece actu
ally begins or ends, or how
long it is." His encore Sunday
was an improvisational piece
that showed him to be as adept
at free-form playing as he was
at the more set pieces, and
provided a fitting ending for a
diverse performance.

can sit down and improvise
using some themes I've come
up with before, but with no re
gard for where the piece actu
ally begins or ends, or how
long it is." His encore Sunday
was an improvisational piece
that showed him to be as adept
at free-form playing as he was
at the more set pieces, and
provided a fitting ending for a
diverse performance.

Writing about a record of
solo acoustic steel string guitar
music is no easy task. Left
without lyrics to quote and hav
ing the sound of only one in
strument to discuss, the re
viewer usually takes one of
three approaches: 1) Vapid
Abstraction Approach — "the
songs are airy weavings of
chords and melodies; light yet
textured, and deeply emo
tional." 2) Sheer Awe Ap
proach — "A guitarist that
plays this fast could only have
been born with a bizarre gene
tic defect that left him with
three middle fingers on each
hand." 3) Pointless Compari
son Approach — "If you like
Leo Kottke and |ohn Fahey,
you'll love this."
In attempting to avoid all of
this, let it simply be said that
"Turning: Turning Back," the
debut album by Alex DeGrassi
on Windham Hill records, is
one fine piece of solo guitar
music. William Ackerman,
head of Windham Hill and not
a bad picker himself, calls De-
Grassi "the best contemporary
steel string guitar player in
America." An overstatement
perhaps. But perhaps not.
The record is perfect for any
mood. The first side contains
mostly slower, contemplative
pieces, while the second side is
more lively. DeGrassi's
technique and performance
are near perfect throughout.
In listening to the first cut,
"Turning," you will notice that
it sounds pretty much like all
the other steel string music
you've ever heard until the last
few bars, when DeGrassi lets
loose such a flurry of rippling
yet controlled notes that you
realize the guy has a superhu
man right hand, the fastest
you've ever heard, faster than
even Kottke or Fahey . . .
(Damn!) But it's true.

Alex DeGrassi headlined a
fine show at the Tresidder up
stairs lounge Sunday night. Fol
lowing a warmly received
opening set by Australian
singer/songwriter Hans Sven
Poulsen, DeGrassi took the
stage for an hour-long perfor
mance, and while some solo
guitar music pan become tedi

ous after a few songs, his play
ing was consistently interest
ing. Because he utilizes various
modal tuningsthat require him
to tune the guitar often, he
explains that in pacing a show,
"I try and strike a compromise
between playing tunes in suc
cession that have similar tun
ings, while trying to keep a
shift of moods going." This
"compromise" produced an
evenly paced performance that
kept the appreciative audience
attentive throughout.
When DeGrassi is playing,
the listener is faced with two
equally pleasing alternatives.
He can either close his eyes
and enjoy the rich variations of
the music, or he can watch the
guitarist's amazing fingerwork.
An obviously difficult piece
like "Blood and Jasmine," with
its speedy, fluid runs and deli
cate harmonics is made twice
as interesting when one actu
ally sees the performer's left
hand moving almost ef
fortlessly up and down the

neck, his fingers often stretch
ing for notes and positions that
seem impossible to attain.
The show featured all the
songs from "Turning: Turning
Back" and two were particu
larly striking. On "Windows"
and "Children's Dance" he
struck a perfect balance, dis
playing his formidable
technique while sacrificing no
thing to the beautiful
melodies, and the effect was
entrancing.
