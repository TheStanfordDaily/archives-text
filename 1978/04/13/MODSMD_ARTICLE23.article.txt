# Gunther Schuller/ron rice
## Scholar gives controversial views 
### 
Gunther Schuller must have
surprised, infuriated and en
lightened many in the audi
ence for his three lectures in
the Sloss Memorial Visiting
Lectureship in Humanities
over the past week. The inter
nationally acclaimed com
poser, arranger, conductor,
educator and historian argued
that American popular music
deserves serious study.
Schuller, with speed and in
sight, presented sources and
interminglings of popular and
traditional music, from African
to minstrel, Scott Joplin to Jelly
Roll Morton and Charles Min
gus, British fife tunes to hill
billy, immigrant music and
blues to country and western,
rhythm and blues to rock, and
rock back to jazz. He rejected
the false issue of high versus
low (or mass) culture, instead
claiming that music is just good
or bad.
Source of dispute
This last position was at the
heart of the value of his lec
tures, and was also one source
of dispute. By not stating his

evaluative criteria, Schuller left
his opinions open to criticism.
For example, he claimed that
the Beatles peaked with their
album "Revolver," and that
they displayed more "ambition
than technique."
Gunther made several
analyses that appeared either
ill-defined or contradictory,
such as:
—Jazz and rock were initially
forms of protest, not art, and as
the protest seeped out, com
plexity and lyricism developed.
This position creates problems
in understanding Beethoven's
"Eroica," jazz as a derivative
itself of black responses to
slavery, or the co-existence of
art and political expression in
general.
—As jazz and rock were ini
tially functional as protest or
mere entertainment, they were
not even conceived of as art.
Schuller curiously suggested,
as a contrast, the example of
African cultures which do not
conceive of their music as art
either. The true contrast was
quite evident at the Friday
night concert of Bach's Bran
denburg Concerti, where
everyone was acutely aware of
the music as art, accompanied
by rigid social conventions of
silence and motionless ap
preciation, which devolved
into sleep for many.
—Americans stole British fife
tunes, and white rock is largely
an inferior xerox copy of black
R&B., while Morton "synth
esized" rags into jazz and
pre-Nashville C&W is a pure

mixture of immigrant music.
But all music forms must bor
row, and Schuller helps to per
petuate the myth of the artistic
poverty of non-ethnic Ameri
cans (whatever that means).
How could Dvorak, Stravinsky,
Channing or Ives have com
posed without selecting and
transforming prior, popular
music? And different subcul
tures provide necessary ser
vices by transmitting deviant or
external symbolic content
through mainstream channels.
Certainly the Beatles' greatest
contribution was merging R&B
with love and intellectual
themes along with new music
technologies. Schuller
criticized this "extra-musical
nature" of much rock, but
opera is open to the same criti
cism.
—The success of Scott Joplin
(who is deservedly admired by
Schuller) is very little different
from that of many popular and
great stars, yet he did not come
under the criticism of com
mericalism.
—Contemporary C&W is
"slick" and "prettyfied" — if
that is true, how could Willie
Nelson become the number
one C&W performer in 1977?
—Schuller's formula that
"zero creativity equals mass
appeal" was irresponsible in
light of examples such as Scott
Joplin, Miles Davis, and Joni
Mitchell, all of whom he ad
mires.
—As one speaker at this
weekend's Critical Communi
cations Conference (held here)

pointed out, pop culture is
perhaps the most important
political and economic
socializing agent in our soci
ety. As such,the ideology and
social relations inherent in and
supporting our popular mass
culture must be identified,
analyzed, and redirected (and
not from just a radical perspec
tive). Reinforcement of con
sumerism via the capitalistic
structure of the music industry
is the real threat behind popu
lar music, not low culture.
Schuller failed to consider this
issue.
Quibbling
But all this becomes close to
quibbling, as Schuller should
be congratulated for his loving
interest and support of popular
music. His most important
point, to all listeners, is that
neither our educational sys
tem, our aesthetic standards,
or our "musical training" nor
our listening habits allow any
one group to appreciate the
musical virtues of other music
forms. Rock groupies are just
as narrow-minded as are fans
of Lawrence Welk. Surely any
lecturer to an audience of pro
fessors, classical musicians,
and financial supporters of the
humanities, who dares to play
recordingsof Bob Wills and the
Texas Playboys, Mississippi
Fred McDowell, Stephen Stills,
Steely Dan, Joni Mitchell and
Weather Report as examples of
serious art is providing a cru
cial service leading to a neces
sary understanding and ap
preciation of our culture.

evaluative criteria, Schuller left
his opinions open to criticism.
For example, he claimed that
the Beatles peaked with their
album "Revolver," and that
they displayed more "ambition
than technique."
Gunther made several
analyses that appeared either
ill-defined or contradictory,
such as:
—Jazz and rock were initially
forms of protest, not art, and as
the protest seeped out, com
plexity and lyricism developed.
This position creates problems
in understanding Beethoven's
"Eroica," jazz as a derivative
itself of black responses to
slavery, or the co-existence of
art and political expression in
general.
—As jazz and rock were ini
tially functional as protest or
mere entertainment, they were
not even conceived of as art.
Schuller curiously suggested,
as a contrast, the example of
African cultures which do not
conceive of their music as art
either. The true contrast was
quite evident at the Friday
night concert of Bach's Bran
denburg Concerti, where
everyone was acutely aware of
the music as art, accompanied
by rigid social conventions of
silence and motionless ap
preciation, which devolved
into sleep for many.
—Americans stole British fife
tunes, and white rock is largely
an inferior xerox copy of black
R&B., while Morton "synth
esized" rags into jazz and
pre-Nashville C&W is a pure

mixture of immigrant music.
But all music forms must bor
row, and Schuller helps to per
petuate the myth of the artistic
poverty of non-ethnic Ameri
cans (whatever that means).
How could Dvorak, Stravinsky,
Channing or Ives have com
posed without selecting and
transforming prior, popular
music? And different subcul
tures provide necessary ser
vices by transmitting deviant or
external symbolic content
through mainstream channels.
Certainly the Beatles' greatest
contribution was merging R&B
with love and intellectual
themes along with new music
technologies. Schuller
criticized this "extra-musical
nature" of much rock, but
opera is open to the same criti
cism.
—The success of Scott Joplin
(who is deservedly admired by
Schuller) is very little different
from that of many popular and
great stars, yet he did not come
under the criticism of com
mericalism.
—Contemporary C&W is
"slick" and "prettyfied" — if
that is true, how could Willie
Nelson become the number
one C&W performer in 1977?
—Schuller's formula that
"zero creativity equals mass
appeal" was irresponsible in
light of examples such as Scott
Joplin, Miles Davis, and Joni
Mitchell, all of whom he ad
mires.
—As one speaker at this
weekend's Critical Communi
cations Conference (held here)

pointed out, pop culture is
perhaps the most important
political and economic
socializing agent in our soci
ety. As such,the ideology and
social relations inherent in and
supporting our popular mass
culture must be identified,
analyzed, and redirected (and
not from just a radical perspec
tive). Reinforcement of con
sumerism via the capitalistic
structure of the music industry
is the real threat behind popu
lar music, not low culture.
Schuller failed to consider this
issue.
Quibbling
But all this becomes close to
quibbling, as Schuller should
be congratulated for his loving
interest and support of popular
music. His most important
point, to all listeners, is that
neither our educational sys
tem, our aesthetic standards,
or our "musical training" nor
our listening habits allow any
one group to appreciate the
musical virtues of other music
forms. Rock groupies are just
as narrow-minded as are fans
of Lawrence Welk. Surely any
lecturer to an audience of pro
fessors, classical musicians,
and financial supporters of the
humanities, who dares to play
recordingsof Bob Wills and the
Texas Playboys, Mississippi
Fred McDowell, Stephen Stills,
Steely Dan, Joni Mitchell and
Weather Report as examples of
serious art is providing a cru
cial service leading to a neces
sary understanding and ap
preciation of our culture.
Gunther Schuller must have
surprised, infuriated and en
lightened many in the audi
ence for his three lectures in
the Sloss Memorial Visiting
Lectureship in Humanities
over the past week. The inter
nationally acclaimed com
poser, arranger, conductor,
educator and historian argued
that American popular music
deserves serious study.
Schuller, with speed and in
sight, presented sources and
interminglings of popular and
traditional music, from African
to minstrel, Scott Joplin to Jelly
Roll Morton and Charles Min
gus, British fife tunes to hill
billy, immigrant music and
blues to country and western,
rhythm and blues to rock, and
rock back to jazz. He rejected
the false issue of high versus
low (or mass) culture, instead
claiming that music is just good
or bad.
