House kills emergency farm bill
Washington—The House killed a one-year emergency
aid bill for grain and cotton growers yesterday despite
the presence of protesting farmers who packed the gal
lery.
The vote was 268-150.
President Jimmy Carter had promised to veto the mea
sure as an unwarranted and substantial increase in food
prices and the federal budget deficit.
Congress has never enacted a farm bill into law over a
presidential veto.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill and the chairmen of
budget committees on both sides of Congress opposed
its adoption.
Forecasts said enactment would have added between
58 cents and $2.14 to the weekly grocery bill of $53 to $54
for a three-person urban family. The forecasts said the
legislation would have increased federal farm-income
programs' budgets from a maximum of $7.9 billion to $13
billion.
Social Security tax cut rejected
Washington — The Senate Budget Committee refused
yesterday to leave room in next year's budget for a
rollback of Social Security taxes, but it went on record in
favor of a major income tax cut and a college tuition tax
credit.
The surprising vote against a reduction in Social Sec
urity taxes was 8-6. The committee's vote contrasted
with actions of the House Budget Committee and the
House Democratic Caucus, which advocate a reduction
in the tax increases that were enacted only last De
cember.
The Senate Budget Committee's action does not block
a reduction in Social Security taxes this fiscal year, which
ends Sept. 30. But it indicates that sentiment for a
rollback apparently is not as strong in the Senate as it is
in the House.
Syrian troops blast east Beirut
Beirut, Lebanon — Syrian troops pumped cannon and
rocket fire into a crowded Christian neighborhood here
yesterday, trying to quell fighting between Christians
and Moslems that has claimed 35 lives in four days.
The Syrians were trying to blast Christian militiamen
out of sniper nests and machinegun positions in the
neighborhood of Ein Rummaneh in east Beirut.
Residents of the adjacent Moslem district of Chiyah
said the Syrians were not firing their way, but said they
were receiving some fire from the Christian sector.
The flare-up came on the eve of the third anniversary
of the outbreak of the 19-month civil war between Mos
lems and Christians that claimed 37,000 lives in 1975-76.
The predominantly Syrian Arab League peacekeepers
were sent to end the fighting and police the truce.
L.A. given Olympic cost veto
Los Angeles — The International Olympic Committee
gave Los Angeles veto power over any decision which
could increase the cost of the 1984 Games, Mayor Tom
Bradley said yesterday.

The mayor expressed confidence at a news confer
ence that any differences between local officials and the
lOC were hammered out during secret meetings earlier
this week in Mexico City. lOC officials had previously
indicated contingency plans were being developed to
hold the Games elsewhere because of a reported chal
lenge by Los Angeles officials to the lOC's power to
control the Games.
Soviet U.N. employee seeks asylum
United Nations — Arkady Shevchenko, top Soviet U.N.
employee in hiding for a week, has said he will quit his
job under certain conditions, a U.N. spokesman said
yesterday. Sources said he was seeking assurances he
could stay in the United States.
The spokesman, Francois Giuliani, said Shevchenko
indicated he would resign "once a number of points
have been clarified."
The Russian last Wednesday disappeared from his
$86,000-a-year post as undersecretary general for politi
cal and Security Council affairs. His government says it
wants him fired, and wants him back.
AU.N. statement Monday said the 47-year-old Russian
left his job because of "differences with his govern
ment." Shevchenko reportedly refused a Soviet order to
come home, and indicated through his American
lawyer, Ernest Gross, that he would not return to the
Soviet Union.
Counterfeit money ring uncovered
San Francisco — The U.S. Secret Service disclosed
yesterday that it has broken up a ring which allegedly
sent over $250,000 in counterfeit bills into both Northern
California and Oregon from a T-Shirt shop in Tracy,
Calif.

agents had arrested three men and had seized $209,890
