The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) came to a "general
understanding" yesterday on several
initial points of the Western Culture
Requirement, according to Jan
Triska, chairman of the committee.
"We discussed what kind of con
tent and what time periods proposed
courses should contain," said Triska.
The committee agreed that any
course should be based essentially
on the study of primary works, ac
cording to Triska. Furthermore,
more than one western subculture
ought to be covered.

Ancient, medieval, early modern
and modern time periods were ag
reed on as the best focus of study,
said Triska.
The question of whether "we
should recommend that any courses
in a proposed three-course sequ
ence should be interchangeable with
one another was also raised," Triska
said.
However, no decision was made
regarding this issue, Triska added.
The C-US will bring their final re
commendation to the Steering
Committee of the Faculty Senate by
May 4, or May 18 at the latest.
