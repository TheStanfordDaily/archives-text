# Bank exec points to 'basic changes'
## 
### Jim Fallon 
The business community is in a
period of confusion because of
enormous structural changes that
will continue for at least another de
cade, a bank executive said here
Monday.
Walter Hoadley, executive vice
president and chief economist of
Bank of America, spoke at noon be
fore approximately 150 persons in
Bishop Auditorium. The presenta
tion was part of a series entitled
"Which Way Corporate America?"
sponsored by the Business School's
Committee on Corporate Responsi
bility.
Hoadley said basic changes in val
ues, in standards and in all facets of
life are overwhelming the business
cycle and are creating a "new nor
mal" condition.
"We're in confusion, maybe deep

confusion, and that is the 'new nor
mal,' " Hoadley said. "In my experi
ence through the years I've never
seen the private sector ... in more
disarray."
Nevertheless, the nation is at the
highest level of economic activity
mankind has ever known, he said.
The problem is that a good economy
no longer insures a satisfied public.
"The link between a good
economy and people being satisfied
has disappeared," Hoadley said.
"We're shifting our value standards.
All must ask the question, 'What
would really satisfy us?' "
This dissatisfaction has weakened
the devices business uses to predict
economic cycles.
"We don't know where we're
going or where we've been," Hoad
ley said. "I'm saying we don't know
where we are, or where we want to

go, and I'm not sure we'll recognize
it when we get there."
This confusion is just not another
routine period or cycle, Hoadley
stressed.
"It's a period of perhaps a decade
of basic change," he said. "Most of
the theories are not working because
the public has already reacted."
He added that the business com
munity cannot wait for things to im
prove, for if it does the nation will
continue to experience its present
slow growth.
This slow growth is partly caused
by a reluctance on the part of
businesses to invest for the future.
"As we deal with the future . . .
most people are extrapolating in bus
iness the conditions they see, and
these conditions are not all that excit
ing," Hoadley said.
He added the business perspective
has changed in the last five or 10
years and will continue to be rede
fined in the next decade.
"Return on existing capital is really
the name of the game for'the next
five years," Hoadley said. "I see no
lack of a desire on the part of corpo
rations to be a constructive force, but
the ground rules are changing so
rapidly that it's difficult to know
which side to come out on."
As a result, he said, there is an
enormous force of egalitarianism in
the United States today. The fear is
that there will be a redistribution of
wealth in the country.
"If you make it today in America
there's the fear that someone will
come and take it away from you,"
Hoadley added.
There are two bases to the prob
lem of combating this egalitarianism

and the resulting confusion, he said.
The first is the amount of profits after
taxes, while the second is related to
political matters where "there's a
four-letter-word called vote."
"Until the voting public deter
mines it wants to move in the direc
tion you (business) want to move, it's
going to be tougher," Hoadley said.

After his speech, Hoadley was
asked to explain Bank of America's
stand on the Jarvis-Gann amendment
to the state constitution which would
place a limit on property taxes in
California.
He said the corporation will soon
issue a statement on the amendment
but that "from the Bank of America's
standpoint, it is an absolute disaster,
it is a no-win case.
"We're now considered the
scapegoat of this because we could
be the gainers," he added.
Hoadley said the Bank's latest poll
indicates the amendment would pass
by an eight to seven margin.

the name of the game for'the next
five years," Hoadley said. "I see no
lack of a desire on the part of corpo
rations to be a constructive force, but
the ground rules are changing so
rapidly that it's difficult to know
which side to come out on."
As a result, he said, there is an
enormous force of egalitarianism in
the United States today. The fear is
that there will be a redistribution of
wealth in the country.
"If you make it today in America
there's the fear that someone will
come and take it away from you,"
Hoadley added.
There are two bases to the prob
lem of combating this egalitarianism

and the resulting confusion, he said.
The first is the amount of profits after
taxes, while the second is related to
political matters where "there's a
four-letter-word called vote."
"Until the voting public deter
mines it wants to move in the direc
tion you (business) want to move, it's
going to be tougher," Hoadley said.

After his speech, Hoadley was
asked to explain Bank of America's
stand on the Jarvis-Gann amendment
to the state constitution which would
place a limit on property taxes in
California.
He said the corporation will soon
issue a statement on the amendment
but that "from the Bank of America's
standpoint, it is an absolute disaster,
it is a no-win case.
"We're now considered the
scapegoat of this because we could
be the gainers," he added.
Hoadley said the Bank's latest poll
indicates the amendment would pass
by an eight to seven margin.

The business community is in a
period of confusion because of
enormous structural changes that
will continue for at least another de
cade, a bank executive said here
Monday.
Walter Hoadley, executive vice
president and chief economist of
Bank of America, spoke at noon be
fore approximately 150 persons in
Bishop Auditorium. The presenta
tion was part of a series entitled
"Which Way Corporate America?"
sponsored by the Business School's
Committee on Corporate Responsi
bility.
Hoadley said basic changes in val
ues, in standards and in all facets of
life are overwhelming the business
cycle and are creating a "new nor
mal" condition.
"We're in confusion, maybe deep

confusion, and that is the 'new nor
mal,' " Hoadley said. "In my experi
ence through the years I've never
seen the private sector ... in more
disarray."
Nevertheless, the nation is at the
highest level of economic activity
mankind has ever known, he said.
The problem is that a good economy
no longer insures a satisfied public.
"The link between a good
economy and people being satisfied
has disappeared," Hoadley said.
"We're shifting our value standards.
All must ask the question, 'What
would really satisfy us?' "
This dissatisfaction has weakened
the devices business uses to predict
economic cycles.
"We don't know where we're
going or where we've been," Hoad
ley said. "I'm saying we don't know
where we are, or where we want to

go, and I'm not sure we'll recognize
it when we get there."
This confusion is just not another
routine period or cycle, Hoadley
stressed.
"It's a period of perhaps a decade
of basic change," he said. "Most of
the theories are not working because
the public has already reacted."
He added that the business com
munity cannot wait for things to im
prove, for if it does the nation will
continue to experience its present
slow growth.
This slow growth is partly caused
by a reluctance on the part of
businesses to invest for the future.
"As we deal with the future . . .
most people are extrapolating in bus
iness the conditions they see, and
these conditions are not all that excit
ing," Hoadley said.
He added the business perspective
has changed in the last five or 10
years and will continue to be rede
fined in the next decade.
"Return on existing capital is really
the name of the game for'the next
five years," Hoadley said. "I see no
lack of a desire on the part of corpo
rations to be a constructive force, but
the ground rules are changing so
rapidly that it's difficult to know
which side to come out on."
