# At Stanford and 57 colleges
## Anti-war protesters monitered by CIA 
### Randy Keith 
The CIA conducted extensive
monitoring of radical political groups
and their activities at Stanford and at
least 57 other U.S. colleges and uni
versities from 1967 until 1973, accord
ing to documents recently released
by the agency.
The domestic surveillance prog
ram, titled Project Resistance, was
apparently illegal under the ClA's
founding charter which allows only
foreign intelligence gathering. It in
volved using informants, "resident
agents" and data collected from pub
lic sources by field agents to spy on
radical groups' plans for anti-
Vietnam war and anti-CIA demonst
rations.
A report prepared by the agency
on radical groups at Stanford fo
cused on the activities of former As
soc. English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin,
who was one of the organizers of the
Revolutionary Union and the Vence
remos here.

The document described the
group as "dedicated to aid the
Communist cause by overthrow of
the U.S. Government by force if
necessary."
Franklin was fired from his English
department post in January 1972 after
a faculty advisory board found him to
have urged the use of "illegal coer
cion and violence" which infringed
on "the rights of others," in connec
tion with an occupation of the com
puter science center on campus.
In addition, the CIA report on
Stanford detailed other radical ac
tivities including an incident where
the Students for a Democratic Soci
ety (SDS) disrupted a Board of Trus
tees meeting and another case where
a large group of antiwar de
monstrators occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory for nine days.
The Project Resistance surveil
lance program began in December
1967 after agency recruiters suffered
"harrassment" when trying to recruit
students throughout the United
States.
According to the documents, the
agency said harrassment included:
— newspaper reporters signing up
for employment interviews;
— picketing;
— confrontation, which the
agency defined as "attempting to
have dialog with recruiter to explain
government or CIA policy"; and
— sit-ins.
Even though the CIA justified the
surveillance on the grounds of pro
tecting recruiters from radical group
harrassment, nowhere in the report
on Stanford is there any mention or
analysis of how radical activities at
Stanford might affect recruitment ac
tivities here or anywhere else.
The documents said the CIA Office
of Security was in charge of the prog
ram and it was ordered to "identify
any threat against agency personnel,
installations or projects."
In particular, CIA field offices in
the United States were ordered to
"monitor collegiate. New Left and
'underground press' coverage of col
lege and university campuses in their
jurisdiction.
"Particularly desired are indica
tions of the effectiveness of the milit
ants and their ability to mobilize stu
dents of only passive or curiosity
seeking interests," said the docu
ments.
Until 1969, the agency told its re
cruiters to try to stop any publicity by
avoiding direct confrontation with
radical groups protesting the ClA's
presence on campuses. After 1969,
however, CIA headquarters in
Langley, Va., ordered that there be
"no publicity" associated with a re
cruiters visit to a school.
The result, according to one
document prepared in January 1975
for the CIA deputy director of sec
urity, was that, "This prompted one
of the few purely intelligence gather
ing assignments to the (U.S.) field
offices."
The idea, according to the docu
ments, was to follow the radical
groups moves, anticipate where they
would demonstrate and have the re
cruiter avoid that area.
"The field offices responded ex
tremely well," said the report. "They
used existing contacts at the various
colleges, developed new informants
and came up with information that
would indicate that they attended
some of the dissident meetings.
"They developed files on the uni
versities and colleges, came to know
the campus security people, special
units in the local and state police as
well as other knowledgeable people
not further identified."

The report, which at points refer
red to radicals as "creeps" and"the
bearded ones," also said "restric
tions on contacting the FBI at local
levels was (sic) dropped; recruiters,
field offices and resident agents were
in direct contact (with the FBI of
fices)."
The fact that the CIA was using in
formants and agents to collect in
formation within the United States is
also shown in a memo from CIA
headquarters, dated Jan. 1, 1971.
Even though the program was cut
back and eventually ended in June
1973, the Commission on CIA Ac
tivities Within the United States,
headed by then-Vice President Nel
son Rockefeller, found that "the ac
cumulation of information on
domestic activities went beyond
what was required by the Agencies'
legitimate security needs and there
fore exceeded the ClA's authority."

harrassment, nowhere in the report
on Stanford is there any mention or
analysis of how radical activities at
Stanford might affect recruitment ac
tivities here or anywhere else.
The documents said the CIA Office
of Security was in charge of the prog
ram and it was ordered to "identify
any threat against agency personnel,
installations or projects."
In particular, CIA field offices in
the United States were ordered to
"monitor collegiate. New Left and
'underground press' coverage of col
lege and university campuses in their
jurisdiction.
"Particularly desired are indica
tions of the effectiveness of the milit
ants and their ability to mobilize stu
dents of only passive or curiosity
seeking interests," said the docu
ments.
Until 1969, the agency told its re
cruiters to try to stop any publicity by
avoiding direct confrontation with
radical groups protesting the ClA's
presence on campuses. After 1969,
however, CIA headquarters in
Langley, Va., ordered that there be
"no publicity" associated with a re
cruiters visit to a school.
The result, according to one
document prepared in January 1975
for the CIA deputy director of sec
urity, was that, "This prompted one
of the few purely intelligence gather
ing assignments to the (U.S.) field
offices."
The idea, according to the docu
ments, was to follow the radical
groups moves, anticipate where they
would demonstrate and have the re
cruiter avoid that area.
"The field offices responded ex
tremely well," said the report. "They
used existing contacts at the various
colleges, developed new informants
and came up with information that
would indicate that they attended
some of the dissident meetings.
"They developed files on the uni
versities and colleges, came to know
the campus security people, special
units in the local and state police as
well as other knowledgeable people
not further identified."

The report, which at points refer
red to radicals as "creeps" and"the
bearded ones," also said "restric
tions on contacting the FBI at local
levels was (sic) dropped; recruiters,
field offices and resident agents were
in direct contact (with the FBI of
fices)."
The fact that the CIA was using in
formants and agents to collect in
formation within the United States is
also shown in a memo from CIA
headquarters, dated Jan. 1, 1971.
Even though the program was cut
back and eventually ended in June
1973, the Commission on CIA Ac
tivities Within the United States,
headed by then-Vice President Nel
son Rockefeller, found that "the ac
cumulation of information on
domestic activities went beyond
what was required by the Agencies'
legitimate security needs and there
fore exceeded the ClA's authority."
The CIA conducted extensive
monitoring of radical political groups
and their activities at Stanford and at
least 57 other U.S. colleges and uni
versities from 1967 until 1973, accord
ing to documents recently released
by the agency.
The domestic surveillance prog
ram, titled Project Resistance, was
apparently illegal under the ClA's
founding charter which allows only
foreign intelligence gathering. It in
volved using informants, "resident
agents" and data collected from pub
lic sources by field agents to spy on
radical groups' plans for anti-
Vietnam war and anti-CIA demonst
rations.
A report prepared by the agency
on radical groups at Stanford fo
cused on the activities of former As
soc. English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin,
who was one of the organizers of the
Revolutionary Union and the Vence
remos here.

The document described the
group as "dedicated to aid the
Communist cause by overthrow of
the U.S. Government by force if
necessary."
Franklin was fired from his English
department post in January 1972 after
a faculty advisory board found him to
have urged the use of "illegal coer
cion and violence" which infringed
on "the rights of others," in connec
tion with an occupation of the com
puter science center on campus.
In addition, the CIA report on
Stanford detailed other radical ac
tivities including an incident where
the Students for a Democratic Soci
ety (SDS) disrupted a Board of Trus
tees meeting and another case where
a large group of antiwar de
monstrators occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory for nine days.
The Project Resistance surveil
lance program began in December
1967 after agency recruiters suffered
"harrassment" when trying to recruit
students throughout the United
States.
According to the documents, the
agency said harrassment included:
— newspaper reporters signing up
for employment interviews;
— picketing;
— confrontation, which the
agency defined as "attempting to
have dialog with recruiter to explain
government or CIA policy"; and
— sit-ins.
Even though the CIA justified the
surveillance on the grounds of pro
tecting recruiters from radical group
harrassment, nowhere in the report
on Stanford is there any mention or
analysis of how radical activities at
