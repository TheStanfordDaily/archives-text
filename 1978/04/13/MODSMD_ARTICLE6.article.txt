# SCRIP initiates referendum campaign

### Joel Dickholtz 
Members of the Stanford Committee for Responsi
ble Investment Policy (SCRIP) will begin an extensive
door-to-door campaign tonight in support of a re
ferendum they are sponsoring on the ASSU ballot
next week, according to SCRIP spokesperson Maggie
Goud.
"We'd like to show both the trustees and the public
just how the students feel about withdrawal," Goud
said.
The referendum, which will pass if it receives ap
proval from a majority of the voting students, reads as
follows: "Stanford University should exercise its role
as a responsible investor to effect corporate with
drawal from South Africa by means up to and includ
ing the sale of stock.
"Although this is not a divestment referendum,"
Goud said, "it does keep the option of divestment
open. This is something that the Committee for In
vestment Responsibility (CIR). suggested in the last
paragraph of its report to the trustees. SCRIP still
supports divestment."
Anti B of A rally
SCRIP is also organizing a rally against the Bank of
America, to be held today at noon in White Plaza.
Goud told the Daily that Bank of America is the focus
of this rally because of its policies supporting red
lining, union-busting and its $188 million loan to
South Africa.
After the rally, students will take part in a protest
march against one of two local branches of the Bank
of America, either in the Stanford Shopping Center,
or downtown Palo Alto, Goud said. She added that
the decision of which branch to protest will be made
during the rally.
The rally will be co-sponsored by the Anti-Bakke
Decision Coalition.
