Disorientation Week supported
The appearance of the two Dis
orientation Week columns on the
Apr. 10 Daily editorial page have led,
perhaps, to misconceptions about
the Senate's funding of the event. In
addition, I feel that it is important to
make an impartial statement regard
ing community support for Disorien
tation Week.
I was present at the Senate meet
ing where the discussion about the
funding took place, and there is an
important point that was never made
in everybody's dash to the headlines.
Never was there concern expressed
that $1700 was too much to give for
the event; rather the concern was
that the figure was too great a per
centage of the Senate's budget.
A compromise was swiftly
reached, due in part to efforts by the
Council of Presidents, and all parties
were satisfied. In light of this
Lundberg and Livingston's editorials
ure inappropriate.
What may remain is the mis
conception that Disorientation
Week has all the money it needs and
is just trying to stuff overflowing cof
fers. I am not a member of SOC, nor
am I part of Disorientation Week, but
I am well aware of the fact that the
program is far from meeting its fi
nancial needs, and that it must con
tinue to rely on various university
and student funding sources if the
week is to be a success. This con
troversy should in no way reflect on
the needs of the program, or on the
communities' obligation to support
it as a worthwhile and exciting event.
I was also dismayed to see a resur
rection of Livingston's "blue flyer,"
even had a compromise not been
reached. His attempt to tell the ASSU
"I told you so" appears somewhat
graceless; further, the blue flyer con
tained factual errors when it first
came out and they remain factual er
rors today.
I hope the consequence of these
problems will not be that the Dis
orientation Week encounters trou
ble raising money. The week is an
important event, and I urge the en
tire community to give it the support
it deserves.

Profits and policy
I note that the trustees have
unanimously adopted a revised
statement of their investment re
sponsibilities. From the Stanford
Observer, Jan. 2nd edition:
"(But) where trustees conclude
that a company's activities or policies
cause 'substantial social injury,' the
board should favor shareholder

proposals which would 'eliminate or
materially reduce' this harm.
"Under the new policy, as a last
resort the trustees will consider di
vesting securities when 'the com
pany has been afforded the
maximum reasonable opportunity to
alter its activities,' when 'no allevia
tion of the substantial social injury is
likely within a reasonable period of
time,' and when such an action is
'consistent with their fiduciary re
sponsibilities.' "
That the maximization of profit is
the trustees' first and final considera
tion is no surprise. However, the
acknowledgment that University
monies may be subsidizing "social
ills" is a new and important step, as is
the stated commitment to an investi
gation of this possibility.
By now, thanks largely to SCRIP,
most of the University community is
aware that Stanford invests in and
profits from about 30 corporations
active in South Africa and that South
Africa contains a "substantial social
injury" called "apartheid."
It is therefore time to abandon
misty and euphemistic pronounce
ments and to focus on facts, i.e.:
Allegation: In South Africa 60 per
cent of the children on the Bantus
tans are dying before the age of 5.
Question: Are any of Stanford's
South African corporations con
tributing to medical insurance for
their non-white employees and their
dependants?
Allegation: In South Africa a com
puter monitored passbook system
supervises the movements of all
non-whites.
Question: Are any of Stanford's
South African corporations involved
in the administration of this system?
Allegation: Most living, recrea
tional and educational facilities in
South Africa are segregated.
Question: Are any of Stanford's
South African corporations housing
segregated facilities?
Allegation: Only all-white unions
are legal in South Africa.
Question: Do any of Stanford's
South African corporations recog
nize any of these unions?
If any of the above allegations is
unfounded, surely it behooves the
trustees to demonstrate this to be the
case. If any of the allegations is true,
the University's connections with the
particular practice should be investi
gated and the results of the investiga
tion made public.
Then and only then will one be
able to judge whether or not the trus
tees are adhering to their new in
vestment policy and, more impor
tantly, whether or not fiduciary re
sponsibility is here consistent with

social responsibility.

Faculty responsible?
In response to the letter submit
ted to the Stanford Daily on Mar. 6,
1978, regarding the irresponsibility
of the student representative to the
Administrative Panel on Recombin
ant DNA Molecules:
As it is my obligation to the panel,
the ASSU, and the Stanford com
munity to represent the student
body in all actions undertaken by the
Panel on DNA, my absence on two
occasions (Mar. 7 and 9) was totally
unjustified.
Any excuse proferred could not, in
my own eyes (or those, apparently,
of some of the panel members) ac
ceptably explain the disregard I dis
played for the business to be con
ducted by the DNA Panel.
Nevertheless, I would wish to draw
attention to two poi nts which the dis
tinguished Professors John Kaplan,
Burton Richter, Ronald Davis, Paul
Berg, and Stanley Cohen, failed to
illustrate.
First, although this does not war
rant my lack of attendance at the two
meetings aforementioned, of the six
meetings which I have (or should
have) participated in, there are some
panel members who have failed to
maintain the apparently "accepted"
level of attendance required.
The engineering representative,
specializing in containment facilities,
has attended two of these six meet
ings; a professor of infectious dis
eases in the medical school has at
tended three; and a professor of
biology, and one of economics, both
failed to attend the three meetings
between Mar. 7 and 9.
In addition, three of the five pro
fessors who co-signed the letter of
Mar. 6 were not present at the most
recent, meeting, held on the same
date as the printing of the letter.
Should I have extended a "special
invitation" to these members in a
similar fashion as the one extended
toward me?
Perhaps, then, if the faculty "can
not get their representative(s) to the
committees on which they are rep
resented, they would do better not
to be represented at all."

Snobbish bitches?
On April 11 the Stanford Daily took
a major step toward the creation of a
sorority system which will fulfill all o£
our preconceived notions. Although
sorority women as of yet have had no
chance to show the Stanford com

munity what kind of persons they re
ally are, the Daily has already por
trayed them in the unsigned cartoon
"1978 — Sororities Return to Cam
pus" as overly made-up and snob
bish bitches.
The sorority colonies have been
working hard to live down this stigma
so that their presence might make a
positive contribution to Stanford life
rather than a negative one. To print
such a cartoon during the first week
of their first rush was a betrayal of
that effort.
The creation of such an image will
only serve to discourage thoughtful
and open-minded women from con
sidering the system. The result will
be precisely what none of us want to
see ... a snobbish and elitist institu
tion. Perhaps, though, that is what
we do want.
If all sorority women were like the
ones portrayed in the cartoon, our
childish prejudices would be
gratified and we might feel better
about the whole thing.
If so, I encourage the Daily and
other leaders of campus opinion to
continue advancing this concept of
sororities at Stanford rather than

looking at the situation objectively,
encouraging strong points, and in
general helping to mold the Stanford
sorority system into a more positive
one than is found at other schools.

Judgment on merits
I am writing this letter out of dis
appointment, in response to the car
toon depicting "sororities" here at
Stanford. In the four years I have
spent at Stanford I had somehow
concluded that students here prided
themselves on judging people,
causes and other entities primarily
on their own merits. To see this ob
viously stereotyped and an unsigned
cartoon in the Daily (Apr. 11) has
caused me to reconsider my opinion.
Sororities here have been making
a conscious effort to organize our
system in the way which can best be
nefit the women here at Stanford.
The Inter-Sorority Council has de
signed Rush in an effort to allow the
women the greatest possible oppor
tunity to meet with and get to know
the women in the sororities, realiz

ing that each group has a personality
of its own as a result of the different
people in it.
Because we are Stanford women,
and as is shown by the large interest
there has been in Rush, there is a
need here for the positive aspects of
friendship opportunities, group
support, social activities, and leader
ship opportunities which sororities
provide.
Sororities here at Stanford will be
what we want them to be, not
what they might be in any other envi
ronment. I would hope only that
people judge them objectively, each
one for what it truly is, without pre
conceived ideas or judgments. This
at least, we owe to ourselves.
