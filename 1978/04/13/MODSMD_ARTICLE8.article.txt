## Gun control curtails killing 
### 
Joey George

Americans have no constitutional
right to own guns. The constitution
never says individuals are entitled to
own guns, but only that we collec
tively have a right to arm state
militias.
The argument should end right
here, but it doesn't. Buying guns is
ridiculously easy in every state in the
nation. In some states it's so easy,
guns are bought in large quantities
and shipped to localities with stricter
regulations.
It's pointless to go through the
many arguments against some form
of gun control. They all revolve
around a false sense of security—the
idea of being able to protect one's
property by having a gun in the
nightstand drawer. You can protect
yourself from murder by owning a
gun as well.
However, most murders are com
mitted by one family member against
another and by people who know
each other. To carry the point to its
logical extreme, you would need to
arm all members of a family so they
could be protected from each other.
NRA controls Congress
By far, the best argument against
gun control is all the money being
spent by the gun lobby, led by the
National Rifle Association in
Washington. Despite the fact that
several recent polls have shown a
majority of Americans favor some
form of gun control, the gun lobby is
so powerful and has so much influ
ence on congressmen, no bill prop
osing gun control has been seriously
considered.
Arguments favoring gun control
are simple. Guns kill. Look at the
ever increasing incidence of crime —
if you could really protect yourself
and your property by owning a gun,
then it seems the crime rate would at
least reach some sort of plateau,
since criminals would necassarily be
deterred, knowing every
homeowner packs a heater at least as
powerful as his own.
The urge to kill may never be re
moved from human nature, even
through thousands of years of civiliz
ing influences. If so, we should do all
we can to make killng much more
difficult and increase the personal
risk of the killer.
Admittedly, gun control is a

cosmetic approach, treating the
symptom rather than thedisease. But
until we learn to effectively control
our urges to kill, making the act of
killing less easy will at least cut down
on the number of deaths.
Leaders shot
We hear often that the 70's are be
reft of leaders. Think of all the lead
ers of the 60's that weie shot down.
In 1968, Robert Kennedy was killed
in cold blood at close range by a
handgun. We are only now begin
ning to realize the importance of the
60's to the development of the U.S.
socially.
If Kennedy had become president,
the war in Vietnam would most likely
have ended before 1973. There
would probably have been no inva
sion of Cambodia, and hence, four
college students who died at Kent
State would be alive today.
There would have been no Water
gate.
More importantly, the spirit of the

late 60's might have been carried on
into the 70's. The struggle of blacks
and other minorities would not have
lost the momentum or have needed
to go underground for regrouping.
Advances would have been made
in civil rights, education and in
America's cities. Progress would
have been made toward a real redis
tribution of income. We wouldn't be
faced now with blatant stagnation
and apathy.
Think of how much better the
country might be now had not Martin
Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and John
Kennedy all been killed by guns.
Gun control can be a very controv
ersial issue, even among those who
favor it, as there are many different
types of control; some favor control
of handguns, others of handguns
and rifles. But some sort of gun con
trol is desperately needed, as is
being called for by most Americans.

right to own guns. The constitution
never says individuals are entitled to
own guns, but only that we collec
tively have a right to arm state
militias.
The argument should end right
here, but it doesn't. Buying guns is
ridiculously easy in every state in the
nation. In some states it's so easy,
guns are bought in large quantities
and shipped to localities with stricter
regulations.
It's pointless to go through the
many arguments against some form
of gun control. They all revolve
around a false sense of security—the
idea of being able to protect one's
property by having a gun in the
nightstand drawer. You can protect
yourself from murder by owning a
gun as well.
However, most murders are com
mitted by one family member against
another and by people who know
each other. To carry the point to its
logical extreme, you would need to
arm all members of a family so they
could be protected from each other.
NRA controls Congress
By far, the best argument against
gun control is all the money being
spent by the gun lobby, led by the
National Rifle Association in
Washington. Despite the fact that
several recent polls have shown a
majority of Americans favor some
form of gun control, the gun lobby is
so powerful and has so much influ
ence on congressmen, no bill prop
osing gun control has been seriously
considered.
Arguments favoring gun control
are simple. Guns kill. Look at the
ever increasing incidence of crime —
if you could really protect yourself
and your property by owning a gun,
then it seems the crime rate would at
least reach some sort of plateau,
since criminals would necassarily be
deterred, knowing every
homeowner packs a heater at least as
powerful as his own.
The urge to kill may never be re
moved from human nature, even
through thousands of years of civiliz
ing influences. If so, we should do all
we can to make killng much more
difficult and increase the personal
risk of the killer.
Admittedly, gun control is a

cosmetic approach, treating the
symptom rather than thedisease. But
until we learn to effectively control
our urges to kill, making the act of
killing less easy will at least cut down
on the number of deaths.
Leaders shot
We hear often that the 70's are be
reft of leaders. Think of all the lead
ers of the 60's that weie shot down.
In 1968, Robert Kennedy was killed
in cold blood at close range by a
handgun. We are only now begin
ning to realize the importance of the
60's to the development of the U.S.
socially.
If Kennedy had become president,
the war in Vietnam would most likely
have ended before 1973. There
would probably have been no inva
sion of Cambodia, and hence, four
college students who died at Kent
State would be alive today.
There would have been no Water
gate.
More importantly, the spirit of the

late 60's might have been carried on
into the 70's. The struggle of blacks
and other minorities would not have
lost the momentum or have needed
to go underground for regrouping.
Advances would have been made
in civil rights, education and in
America's cities. Progress would
have been made toward a real redis
tribution of income. We wouldn't be
faced now with blatant stagnation
and apathy.
Think of how much better the
country might be now had not Martin
Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and John
Kennedy all been killed by guns.
Gun control can be a very controv
ersial issue, even among those who
favor it, as there are many different
types of control; some favor control
of handguns, others of handguns
and rifles. But some sort of gun con
trol is desperately needed, as is
being called for by most Americans.
