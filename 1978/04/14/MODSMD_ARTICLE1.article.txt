### Sara Lessley 
The ASSU Senate last night recon
sidered last week's $1700 allocation
to SOC Disorientation Week, pas
sing by hand vote the previously ag
reed upon compromise of $1000 in
stead.
Senate Finance Committee Chair
person Carlyle Kinnison, also a Stan
ford Organizing Committee (SOC)
member, said that at the committee
meeting Friday it was discovered that
SOC Disorientation Week would re
ceive unexpected funds.
A compromise was reached to
change the amount of the senate al
location to $1000, he added.
Before the vote, SOC Sen. Donald
Moonshine read a statement explain
ing SOC's position on the com
promise. According to the state
ment, "SOC defends its actions" and
called Disorientation Week a way to
further the "accomplishment of our
political goals."
SOC statement
"Disorientation Week is specifi
cally the kind of activity for which the
discretionary fund monies should be
used. We would have been willing to
allocate the whole of the discretio
nary fund had the organizers of Dis
orientation Week needed and
sought that amount," tfce statement
continued. The statement is signed
by 11 SOC senators. SOC Sen. Meriel
Burtle told the Daily later that she,
however, did not support the state
ment.
After the SOC statement was read,
Sen. Doug Bandow commented on
what he termed the opposition's use
of the "repressive apparatus of the
bourgeois electoral system to save
students $700 which otherwise
would not have been given back."
In other action, the senate ap
proved $75 recommended by the Fi
nance Committee to fund extra pub
licity for the Alpha Phi Omega used
book exchange.
Also approved was $250 for the
Dick Gregory lecture/speech spon
sored by the ASSU Speakers Bureau
and the NAACP.
Off-campus student center
Also from the discretionary fund,
the senate approved $300 for the
off-campus student center.
Sen. Peter Joost said he was
"amazed at the way this place (the
senate) spends money."
In addition, the senate put a con
stitutional amendment on the ballot
which would require audits from
student organizations receiving stu
dent money through fee assess
ments.
Senate approval merely places the
measures on the ballot.
In one of the few meetings in
which the entire agenda was com
pleted, the meeting nevertheless
was short, ending in less than two
hours.
