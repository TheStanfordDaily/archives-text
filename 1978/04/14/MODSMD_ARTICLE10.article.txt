## Israeli tactics, military actions reviewed 
### 
The gist of Rachelle Marshall's arti
cle (Daily, Apr. 4) is: how can the
Jews, who suffered so grievously at
the hands of the Nazis, make the
Palestinians suffer? It is worth reread
ing that sentence.
Marshall manages in her arti
cle to convey a sense of polite horror
at the Nazi holocaust while every
thing she argues for seems designed
to ensure its repetition. I can under
stand the protestations of innocence
by those who constantly berate and
insult the State of Israel that they are
not anti-Semitic, but they do lay
themselves open to this charge by
demanding of Israel concessions that
no other state would be required to
make. Czechoslovakia in 1938 is the
only parallel.
Since 1973 more than 1500 inci
dents of shelling and murderous in
cursions have been committed by
the PLO across the Lebanese border
with Israel. If the Lebanese govern
ment cannot exercise sovereignty
over part of its territory, then Israel
will do so for it.
It is strange that while Marshall
criticizes Israel for the invasion, she
tacitly approves of a similar action by
Israel against a putative Palestinian
state under similar circumstances.
That she has no idea of the difference
in topography between southern
Lebanon and the West Bank,
and ignores the far greater vulnera
bility of Israel's population centers to

attack from Judea and Samaria, are
other matters. Israel's action in
Lebanon is what any other govern
ment would and should do in order
to protect its population — unless of
course you think that Israel shouldn't
be allowed to defend itself.
The invasion was not aimed at
"dispersing and demoralizing the
Palestinians" as Marshall wrote, but
at destroying the PLO. In spite of
constant attempts at the contrary,
the PLO and Palestinian Arabs are not
the same thing. The PLO exists by a
reign of terror as much against the
Palestinians as against the Israelis.
If Marshall would pay more atten
tion to the facts of life in the Middle
East she would have learnt that in the
past year the PLO has been assas
sinating prominant Palestinian Aiabs
on the West Bank who dared to chal
lenge it. Doubtless Marshal! would
argue that this was all part of the crea
tion of a secular democratic Utopia.
I was somewhat amused by Mar
shall stating that Israel's invasion had
aroused "hatred and resentment" in
the Arab world. In an area not noted
for its restraint, their reaction was
one of deafening silence. The truth is
that the PLO is the most hated and
feared group in the Arab world. The
hatred is reciprocal. The subhuman
conditions in which the Arabs have
kept the Palestinian refugees for the
past 30 years stands in poor contrast
with Israel's treatment of the more

numerous Jewish refugees from
Arab lands.
Marshall states, "Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, Jordan, and even Syria have
repeatedly announced their willing
ness to make peace with Israel." In
fact, none have said anything of the
kind. Only Egypt has gone as far as
saying that "Israel exists." Not, mind
you, that Israel has arightto exist. The
difference is not hair-splitting. For a
generation the whole Arab world has
regarded Israel as a disease in the
Arab body politic.
Remember Israel has been at
tacked and threatened with destruc
tion four times in 30 years, and such
events are not easily forgotten. So
when Sadat says to Israel, "Trust me,
withdraw, create a Palestinian state,
have as many guarantees as you
wish, and all will be well" a certain
scepticism is not misplaced.
Egypt is not a democracy. There is
no tradition or concept of continuity
in government, except that of hostil
ity to Israel. As for Israel's other
neighbors; Syria and Jordan remain
implaccable. Saudi Arabia, for the
moment, remains militarily dormant.
The PLO continues committed to the
destruction of Israel by the massacre
of her population, as the PLO has yet
to find the courage to attack a milit
ary target.
It is not surprising then that Israel
is being cautious, fearing to tread
where her enemies are eager to rush

Philip Rosen

in, and her so-called friends are anx
ious to push her. All that is required
for everlasting peace in the Middle
East, we are constantly told, is more
Israeli flexibility. The U.S. administ
ration is now using relentless pres
sure and intimidating blackmail, in
the guise of "evenhandedness," to
force her into adopting the Egyptian
position before the negotiations
have barely begun. No one speaks of
the need for Egyptian compromise.
"Sadat yielded all by going to
Jerusalem." In fact he has yielded no
thing, and shows signs of having
used new tactics for old aims.
Marshal! does admit that Israel's
security would have to be guaran
teed. But guarantees are not
worth the paper they are written on
unless they can be enforced. And
given the unseemly craving and
grovelling for oil in this world, no
one is keen to annoy the Arabs if they
should decide to attack Israel in the
future.
Marshall also claims that the
Jewish terrorism of the 1940's
brought about the creation of the
State of Israel. It did not. Its effect
was to rid Palestine of the British.
Israel's fight for survival against five
Arab armies that attacked her cannot
be described as a terrorist campaign.
The solution to the conflict is, con
trary to appearances, very simple.
Despite what Menachem Begin says
in public, everyone knows that
Israel cannot absorb 1.1 million
Arabs and remain a Jewish democra
tic state. What is not known so widely
is that neither can King Hussein ab
sorb 1.1 million relatively prosperous
and educated Palestinian Arabs and
remain a Hashemite, feudal autoc
racy.
Now whereas Israel is 85 per cent
Jewish, Jordan is only 30 per cent be
douin Hashemite: the majority is
Palestinian Arab. If Hussein is re
placed by a Palestinian government,
moderate and progressive in out
look, it will be a relatively simple mat
ter to draw one border between two
states than it is to draw two borders
between three.
Hussein's kingdom has no histori
cal or demographic basis. It was
created in 1921 by British fiat in ques
tionable circumstances. Ibn Hus
sein, the great-grandfather of the in
cumbent, was its first ruler. He was
driven out of his ancestral Hejaz
(in north-western Saudi-Arabia) by
Ibn Saud, the late King Faisal's father.
Saudi Arabia should give the Hejaz
back to Hussein, and Hussein Trans
jordan to the Palestinian Arabs.
The return trip would enable Hus
sein to escape probable assassina
tion, give Saudi Arabia a chance to
display their much vaunted modera
tion and generosity, and provide Is
rael with a much-needed example of
withdrawal from occupied lands.

in, and her so-called friends are anx
ious to push her. All that is required
for everlasting peace in the Middle
East, we are constantly told, is more
Israeli flexibility. The U.S. administ
ration is now using relentless pres
sure and intimidating blackmail, in
the guise of "evenhandedness," to
force her into adopting the Egyptian
position before the negotiations
have barely begun. No one speaks of
the need for Egyptian compromise.
"Sadat yielded all by going to
Jerusalem." In fact he has yielded no
thing, and shows signs of having
used new tactics for old aims.
Marshal! does admit that Israel's
security would have to be guaran
teed. But guarantees are not
worth the paper they are written on
unless they can be enforced. And
given the unseemly craving and
grovelling for oil in this world, no
one is keen to annoy the Arabs if they
should decide to attack Israel in the
future.
Marshall also claims that the
Jewish terrorism of the 1940's
brought about the creation of the
State of Israel. It did not. Its effect
was to rid Palestine of the British.
Israel's fight for survival against five
Arab armies that attacked her cannot
be described as a terrorist campaign.
The solution to the conflict is, con
trary to appearances, very simple.
Despite what Menachem Begin says
in public, everyone knows that
Israel cannot absorb 1.1 million
Arabs and remain a Jewish democra
tic state. What is not known so widely
is that neither can King Hussein ab
sorb 1.1 million relatively prosperous
and educated Palestinian Arabs and
remain a Hashemite, feudal autoc
racy.
Now whereas Israel is 85 per cent
Jewish, Jordan is only 30 per cent be
douin Hashemite: the majority is
Palestinian Arab. If Hussein is re
placed by a Palestinian government,
moderate and progressive in out
look, it will be a relatively simple mat
ter to draw one border between two
states than it is to draw two borders
between three.
Hussein's kingdom has no histori
cal or demographic basis. It was
created in 1921 by British fiat in ques
tionable circumstances. Ibn Hus
sein, the great-grandfather of the in
cumbent, was its first ruler. He was
driven out of his ancestral Hejaz
(in north-western Saudi-Arabia) by
Ibn Saud, the late King Faisal's father.
Saudi Arabia should give the Hejaz
back to Hussein, and Hussein Trans
jordan to the Palestinian Arabs.
The return trip would enable Hus
sein to escape probable assassina
tion, give Saudi Arabia a chance to
display their much vaunted modera
tion and generosity, and provide Is
rael with a much-needed example of
withdrawal from occupied lands.

The gist of Rachelle Marshall's arti
cle (Daily, Apr. 4) is: how can the
Jews, who suffered so grievously at
the hands of the Nazis, make the
Palestinians suffer? It is worth reread
ing that sentence.
Marshall manages in her arti
cle to convey a sense of polite horror
at the Nazi holocaust while every
thing she argues for seems designed
to ensure its repetition. I can under
stand the protestations of innocence
by those who constantly berate and
insult the State of Israel that they are
not anti-Semitic, but they do lay
themselves open to this charge by
demanding of Israel concessions that
no other state would be required to
make. Czechoslovakia in 1938 is the
only parallel.
Since 1973 more than 1500 inci
dents of shelling and murderous in
cursions have been committed by
the PLO across the Lebanese border
with Israel. If the Lebanese govern
ment cannot exercise sovereignty
over part of its territory, then Israel
will do so for it.
It is strange that while Marshall
criticizes Israel for the invasion, she
tacitly approves of a similar action by
Israel against a putative Palestinian
state under similar circumstances.
That she has no idea of the difference
in topography between southern
Lebanon and the West Bank,
and ignores the far greater vulnera
bility of Israel's population centers to

attack from Judea and Samaria, are
other matters. Israel's action in
Lebanon is what any other govern
ment would and should do in order
to protect its population — unless of
course you think that Israel shouldn't
be allowed to defend itself.
The invasion was not aimed at
"dispersing and demoralizing the
Palestinians" as Marshall wrote, but
at destroying the PLO. In spite of
constant attempts at the contrary,
the PLO and Palestinian Arabs are not
the same thing. The PLO exists by a
reign of terror as much against the
Palestinians as against the Israelis.
If Marshall would pay more atten
tion to the facts of life in the Middle
East she would have learnt that in the
past year the PLO has been assas
sinating prominant Palestinian Aiabs
on the West Bank who dared to chal
lenge it. Doubtless Marshal! would
argue that this was all part of the crea
tion of a secular democratic Utopia.
I was somewhat amused by Mar
shall stating that Israel's invasion had
aroused "hatred and resentment" in
the Arab world. In an area not noted
for its restraint, their reaction was
one of deafening silence. The truth is
that the PLO is the most hated and
feared group in the Arab world. The
hatred is reciprocal. The subhuman
conditions in which the Arabs have
kept the Palestinian refugees for the
past 30 years stands in poor contrast
with Israel's treatment of the more

numerous Jewish refugees from
Arab lands.
Marshall states, "Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, Jordan, and even Syria have
repeatedly announced their willing
ness to make peace with Israel." In
fact, none have said anything of the
kind. Only Egypt has gone as far as
saying that "Israel exists." Not, mind
you, that Israel has arightto exist. The
difference is not hair-splitting. For a
generation the whole Arab world has
regarded Israel as a disease in the
Arab body politic.
Remember Israel has been at
tacked and threatened with destruc
tion four times in 30 years, and such
events are not easily forgotten. So
when Sadat says to Israel, "Trust me,
withdraw, create a Palestinian state,
have as many guarantees as you
wish, and all will be well" a certain
scepticism is not misplaced.
Egypt is not a democracy. There is
no tradition or concept of continuity
in government, except that of hostil
ity to Israel. As for Israel's other
neighbors; Syria and Jordan remain
implaccable. Saudi Arabia, for the
moment, remains militarily dormant.
The PLO continues committed to the
destruction of Israel by the massacre
of her population, as the PLO has yet
to find the courage to attack a milit
ary target.
It is not surprising then that Israel
is being cautious, fearing to tread
where her enemies are eager to rush

attack from Judea and Samaria, are
other matters. Israel's action in
Lebanon is what any other govern
ment would and should do in order
to protect its population — unless of
course you think that Israel shouldn't
be allowed to defend itself.
The invasion was not aimed at
"dispersing and demoralizing the
Palestinians" as Marshall wrote, but
at destroying the PLO. In spite of
constant attempts at the contrary,
the PLO and Palestinian Arabs are not
the same thing. The PLO exists by a
reign of terror as much against the
Palestinians as against the Israelis.
If Marshall would pay more atten
tion to the facts of life in the Middle
East she would have learnt that in the
past year the PLO has been assas
sinating prominant Palestinian Aiabs
on the West Bank who dared to chal
lenge it. Doubtless Marshal! would
argue that this was all part of the crea
tion of a secular democratic Utopia.
I was somewhat amused by Mar
shall stating that Israel's invasion had
aroused "hatred and resentment" in
the Arab world. In an area not noted
for its restraint, their reaction was
one of deafening silence. The truth is
that the PLO is the most hated and
feared group in the Arab world. The
hatred is reciprocal. The subhuman
conditions in which the Arabs have
kept the Palestinian refugees for the
past 30 years stands in poor contrast
with Israel's treatment of the more

numerous Jewish refugees from
Arab lands.
Marshall states, "Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, Jordan, and even Syria have
repeatedly announced their willing
ness to make peace with Israel." In
fact, none have said anything of the
kind. Only Egypt has gone as far as
saying that "Israel exists." Not, mind
you, that Israel has arightto exist. The
difference is not hair-splitting. For a
generation the whole Arab world has
regarded Israel as a disease in the
Arab body politic.
Remember Israel has been at
tacked and threatened with destruc
tion four times in 30 years, and such
events are not easily forgotten. So
when Sadat says to Israel, "Trust me,
withdraw, create a Palestinian state,
have as many guarantees as you
wish, and all will be well" a certain
scepticism is not misplaced.
Egypt is not a democracy. There is
no tradition or concept of continuity
in government, except that of hostil
ity to Israel. As for Israel's other
neighbors; Syria and Jordan remain
implaccable. Saudi Arabia, for the
moment, remains militarily dormant.
The PLO continues committed to the
destruction of Israel by the massacre
of her population, as the PLO has yet
to find the courage to attack a milit
ary target.
It is not surprising then that Israel
is being cautious, fearing to tread
where her enemies are eager to rush

Philip Rosen

in, and her so-called friends are anx
ious to push her. All that is required
for everlasting peace in the Middle
East, we are constantly told, is more
Israeli flexibility. The U.S. administ
ration is now using relentless pres
sure and intimidating blackmail, in
the guise of "evenhandedness," to
force her into adopting the Egyptian
position before the negotiations
have barely begun. No one speaks of
the need for Egyptian compromise.
"Sadat yielded all by going to
Jerusalem." In fact he has yielded no
thing, and shows signs of having
used new tactics for old aims.
Marshal! does admit that Israel's
security would have to be guaran
teed. But guarantees are not
worth the paper they are written on
unless they can be enforced. And
given the unseemly craving and
grovelling for oil in this world, no
one is keen to annoy the Arabs if they
should decide to attack Israel in the
future.
Marshall also claims that the
Jewish terrorism of the 1940's
brought about the creation of the
State of Israel. It did not. Its effect
was to rid Palestine of the British.
Israel's fight for survival against five
Arab armies that attacked her cannot
be described as a terrorist campaign.
The solution to the conflict is, con
trary to appearances, very simple.
Despite what Menachem Begin says
in public, everyone knows that
Israel cannot absorb 1.1 million
Arabs and remain a Jewish democra
tic state. What is not known so widely
is that neither can King Hussein ab
sorb 1.1 million relatively prosperous
and educated Palestinian Arabs and
remain a Hashemite, feudal autoc
racy.
Now whereas Israel is 85 per cent
Jewish, Jordan is only 30 per cent be
douin Hashemite: the majority is
Palestinian Arab. If Hussein is re
placed by a Palestinian government,
moderate and progressive in out
look, it will be a relatively simple mat
ter to draw one border between two
states than it is to draw two borders
between three.
Hussein's kingdom has no histori
cal or demographic basis. It was
created in 1921 by British fiat in ques
tionable circumstances. Ibn Hus
sein, the great-grandfather of the in
cumbent, was its first ruler. He was
driven out of his ancestral Hejaz
(in north-western Saudi-Arabia) by
Ibn Saud, the late King Faisal's father.
Saudi Arabia should give the Hejaz
back to Hussein, and Hussein Trans
jordan to the Palestinian Arabs.
The return trip would enable Hus
sein to escape probable assassina
tion, give Saudi Arabia a chance to
display their much vaunted modera
tion and generosity, and provide Is
rael with a much-needed example of
withdrawal from occupied lands.

The gist of Rachelle Marshall's arti
cle (Daily, Apr. 4) is: how can the
Jews, who suffered so grievously at
the hands of the Nazis, make the
Palestinians suffer? It is worth reread
ing that sentence.
Marshall manages in her arti
cle to convey a sense of polite horror
at the Nazi holocaust while every
thing she argues for seems designed
to ensure its repetition. I can under
stand the protestations of innocence
by those who constantly berate and
insult the State of Israel that they are
not anti-Semitic, but they do lay
themselves open to this charge by
demanding of Israel concessions that
no other state would be required to
make. Czechoslovakia in 1938 is the
only parallel.
Since 1973 more than 1500 inci
dents of shelling and murderous in
cursions have been committed by
the PLO across the Lebanese border
with Israel. If the Lebanese govern
ment cannot exercise sovereignty
over part of its territory, then Israel
will do so for it.
It is strange that while Marshall
criticizes Israel for the invasion, she
tacitly approves of a similar action by
Israel against a putative Palestinian
state under similar circumstances.
That she has no idea of the difference
in topography between southern
Lebanon and the West Bank,
and ignores the far greater vulnera
bility of Israel's population centers to

attack from Judea and Samaria, are
other matters. Israel's action in
Lebanon is what any other govern
ment would and should do in order
to protect its population — unless of
course you think that Israel shouldn't
be allowed to defend itself.
