# An endangered species;
## Inner-city doctors 
### 
The inner-city doctor has become
an endangered species in New York
City. Over the past decade, every
borough except Staten Island has
lost physicians; the number in
Brooklyn and the Bronx has dropped
by more than a quarter. Nearly half of
the city's health districts have less
than one physician per thousand re
sidents, far below the national aver
age. So there is welcome news in
deed from Washington. As many as
50 federally sponsored physicians
will be sent to poor neighborhoods
in New York City this summer.
They will come under the auspices
of the National Health Services
Corps, to which young doctors give
two years of service in medically dep
rived communities as a way of repay
ing Federal tuition loans. Hereto
fore, almost all have been sent to
rural areas. Now, in a commendable
re-orientation, the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare in
tends to send more of them to inner
cities.
The initiative is one among several
involving health services for the ci
ty's poor. The Department of Social
Services will enroll 100,000 poor
people in a prepaid insurance plan as
a test; they will receive expanded
services, particularly primary care, at
reduced cost. In the process, the
plan would bring needed business to

the Health Insurance Plan, which
serves municipal employees. In
another departure, the Health and
Hospitals Corporation plans to re
place interns and residents in its out
patient clinics with experienced doc
tors.
The city's Health Commissioner,
Dr. Pascal Imperato, sees additional
help on the horizon. As medical
school costs continue to soar, more
students will turn to the Federal
Government for tuition help — and
find themselves in the Health Corps.
Washington may be able to assign
thousands of physicians to deprived
cities and rural areas by the early
1980's.
Still, any such expansion will be
slow, and the several steps recently
announced promise no immediate
or dramatic gains. The doctor shor
tage will continue, as older physi
cians retire and younger ones
choose more lucrative practices. The
indigent already are left to the dubi
ous mercies of Medicaid mills. And
the financial pressures on New York
City's health system are hardly likely
to diminish. But the innovations are
welcome if only as symbols. Parks,
subways and housing may be subject
to "deferred maintenance" but
health cannot be.
