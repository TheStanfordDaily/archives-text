# Demo chairman attacks Jarvis-Gann amendment
## 
### Craig Dennis 
California State Democratic Party Chairman
Bert Coffey said in an interview Tuesday that if
the Jarvis-Gann constitutional amendment limit
ing property taxes passes in )une, "it will cause
chaos" in this state.
At a meeting in Fresno last weekend, the state
Democratic committee unanimously passed a
resolution opposing Jarvis-Gann, listed as Prop
osition 13 on June's primary ballot.
Coffey was on campus Tuesday evening for an
open meeting of the Stanford Democrats. He
was interviewed during a taping of the KZSU
program "Clearing the Air."
Coffey said his party supports an alternative
tax limitation measure on the ballot, Proposition
8. "It offers homeowners immediate property
relief of 30 per cent," he said, "and more than
doubles the relief for renters."
He mentioned what he called "horror stories"
of cutbacks if Proposition 13 passed instead. He
claimed such basic items as education, police
and fire services would be slashed dramatically.
Coffey said Proposition 8 would maintain pre
sent education expenditures and would offer a
much more reasonable tax limitation.
Coffey was generally complimentary of Gov.
Jerry Brown's relations with the state party. "The
remarkable thing about Jerry Brown is he knows
what the people of California are thinking be
fore they know, and that's a great political ta
lent."
However, Coffey added, "I wish he would let
me make some appointments, but that's not the
type of state we live in."
The state is in good shape, Coffey said in list
ing Brown's accomplishments. But he said
Brown should moderate his style to provide
more access to people. "The criticism comes

from many groups since he is not feeding the
special interests," he said.
"When we have needed him, we have had
him," Coffey said. "He is a very astute political
man."
However, Coffey does not see President
Jimmy Carter faltering before the 1980 election.
If Brown decides to challenge Carter for the
Democratic presidential nomination, Coffey
said, "a nomination gained by defeating a sitting
incumbent president is not worth getting."
Coffey described his state party as the "largest
disorganized group of people in this country.
We try to keep under one umbrella."
He said Congressman Paul McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park) is "adept" at getting headlines, but
said McCloskey's record does not have much
legislative substance. However, he said the state
party organization is not actively seeking candi
dates to oppose McCloskey this year.
A bill now before the legislature restructuring
the Democratic party and convention represen
tation was called "realistic" by Coffey.
"We're on our way. It's not a radical proposal,
it's not as much as I like to see, perhaps it's more
than some legislators would liketosee, but what
it will do is provide an opening in the process in
making it more responsive in the district," said
Coffey who gave the proposal a good chance of
passage.
He said it was also significant that he does not
get many invitations to college campuses.
"Young people are tuned out in so far as parties
are concerned, and they reflect the mature part
of the population."
But he said there is a need for a strong party
system. Cofffey said those candidates who win
on a style and personality basis are those less
attached to either party.
