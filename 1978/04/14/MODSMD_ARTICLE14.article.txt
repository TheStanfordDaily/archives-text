# Draw book lists housing changes

The abolition of a unisex theme house, sub
sequent establishment of a German theme
house and more "freedom" in claiming housing
priorities mark the major changes in the 1978
Drawbook, issued last Friday.
Distributed by the office of the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs, residential education division, the
Drawbook introduces Haus Mitteleuropa, for
merly the unisex Androgyny House.
According to Philip Curry, administrative as
sistant for residential education, the new theme
house will focus on Central European culture,
politics, history and cuisine. German-speaking
countries will be studied in-depth.
In order to belong to the house, students are
required to take an in-house seminar and
courses in German language or German litera
ture.
First priorities will be set on the basis of prop
osals submitted for in-house seminars and ful
fillment of the house requirements, and second
priorities on the basis of agreement to fulfill
house requirements, Curry said.
Concerning special priority housing, Curry
remarked, "Students may now claim returning

residence priority for all houses they've lived in
since Autumn 1976. There has not been this
much freedom in the past.
"The exact terms of each special priority
house are worked out by the houses them
selves, with the permission of the office of resi
dential education," he continued. "These spe
cial houses need to get people who show in
terest in what makes the house unique. The
essential idea is program support."
"Special priorities serve to get potential resi
dents to understand and accept the require
ments of the houses," agreed Mary Lawrence,
office assistant in residential education. "They
are decided by the house, with the University
requirement that they are objective. This en
sures the success of special programs within
co-ops and theme houses."
Last year saw another change concerning the
returning residence priority system.
"In the past there was inequity among
freshmen," Curry said. Freshmen in four-class
houses had a priority advantage over freshmen
in all-frosh houses. However, because this resi
dential priority has been abolished, "every
sophomore now has the same chance in the
housing draw," said Lawrence.
