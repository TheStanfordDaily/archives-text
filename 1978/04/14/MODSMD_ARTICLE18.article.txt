# Professor, students visit Mayan civilizations studied

### Paulette Truman 
Studying about Mayan civili
zation in a freshman seminar
may seem ordinary to some
one reading the course de
scription. But Anthropology
Prof. George Collier's course,
"The Maya, Ancient and Mod
ern: Facts and Fantasies," was
noordinary freshman seminar.
Collier and five of his nine
students not only studied from
textbooks, but also visited
Mayan communities in south
ern Mexico over spring break.
"For two quarters we
learned the history of these
Mayan people and their mod
ern politics, society, and be
liefs. But not until we saw them
could we put them into
perspective," said freshman
Evelia Rodriquez.
"The experience really
brought to life the things we
were studying," Collier said.
"We visited many modern
Mayan towns. The purpose of
this was to give the students
some concrete sense of what
the peoples were like," he con
tinued.
The class departed the day
after Easter and arrived in
Mexico City. There they visited
the Mexican National Museum
of Anthropology which, ac
cording to Collier, is one of the
most outstanding museums of
its kind in the area.
Pickpocketing
"We spent the rest of the day
traipsing around Mexico City
getting our pockets picked,"
Collier said in reference to one
student who had $40 stolen
from his pocket.
The remaining seven days
were spent in the state of
Chiapas, which is located
south of Mexico City. Collier
and his students drove 7000
feet up into the highlands of
Chiapas and headquartered
themselves in its colonial capi
tal, San Cristubal de las Casas.
"I've done field research
here before so I've got lots of
contacts," Collier said.
"We had a rented van as a

matter of convenience. We'd
go out during the day to visit
the Indian communities out
side of this provincial town,
San Cristubal," he added.
Pyramid
One day they went to an an
cient Mayan site in the com
munity of Chinkultic and were
able to see a reconstructed
pyramid dating back to bet
ween 500 and 900 A.D.
They also went swimming in
Cenote Azul which, according
to Collier, is an unusual natural
well that is about 50 feet across
and 150 feet deep. Collier
added that archeologists have
recently discovered that ce
notes such as this were once
used by the Mayan Indians as a
place for idol and even human
sacrifices.
The students said they were
impressed with this cenote and
enjoyed swimming in it even
though they had "to be careful
about the quicksand," as John
Landis said.
But the students were awed
more by the people, the mod
ern Mayan Indians, than by the
ancient sites they had an op
portunity to see.
Villages
"What impressed me the
most were the villages," said
Graham Billingham, recalling
the different way of life the
people led, and in particular,
their customs and beliefs.
Billingham said that about
two weeks before the church
in one of the villages they
visited had caught fire. One lit
tle village boy had thought
that the church was burning
because the moon had fallen.
"They're very superstiti
ous," said Rodriquez. She
added that the villagers would
not allow them to take photo
graphs of them or of their
churches because they
thought that a photo would
cause them to lose their soul
which would lead them to be
come sick.
"You're taking something
away from them when you take

their picture," said Carolina
Reyes.
Distinctiveness
"Each Indian village had its
own distinctiveness," said Val
entin Hernandez, another stu
dent who went on the trip. He
recalled the different dress
styles, dialects, and the rela
tionships the various Indian
communities had with outsid
ers such as Mexicans.
The Chamulas, a modern
Mayan Indian sect, are very
hostile to any outsiders, ac
cording to Hernandez. The
class had read a book on these
people and their ceremonial
center, the town of San Juan
Chamula, Hernandez said.
"They live in a whole diffe

rent world and the most impre
ssive thing was that they pre
served it. It was so different
from this kind of capitalistic
society," Reyes said. She
added that the modern Mayans
do not use machinery and still
farm with sticks.
Another prominent differ
ence noticed by the group was
the attitude toward religion in
the Mayan communities.
More salient
"These are societies in which
the sacred are much more sa
lient than in our secular soci
ety," Collier commented.
"Religion is their whole life.
Compared to the houses that
the people lived in, the church
was a mansion," Billingham

said while referring to the im
portance the Indians put on
maintaining the church by in
vesting much of their income
in it.
Collier said that using 200 or
300 pesos worth of candles in
the church was not unusual for
a family. The average family
earns about 2000 pesos a year,
he added.
The students also had a
chance to see cultural differ
ences among the Mexican
people. Each day when the class
would return to its base, San
Cristubal, a city which is mainly
inhabited by Mexicans, they
realized the difference in cul
tural values from the United
States and from the nearby In

dian villages.
Billingham and Landis com
mented that language posed a
problem for them because
they did not knew Spanish. Bil
lingham cited one example of a
language problem which oc
curred in Mexico City. As he
passed a dog sitting on a street
corner, he had called out,
"Hey, poochie." A man and
woman, a few feet away,
thought that he had been talk
ing to them.
"This guy started chasing
me. I found out later that
'poochie' in Spanish is an insult
to a woman since it means
'slut,' " Billingham said.
"It made me more aware of
what it must be like for some
one coming to this country not
knowing the language," Landis
said.
The class was also fortunate
to be able to see what a "feria"
or festival is like since San Cris
tubal was celebrating the4soth
anniversary of its founding by
the Spaniards in 1528, in addi
tion to having its traditional
week-long celebration after
Easter.
Odd custom
Billingham explained one
custom in which all the young
men and women participate,
which the five students joined
in on also. It involved having
the males walk in one direction
in a circle while the females
walk in the opposite direction.
"You had to use eye contact
on the person who you liked,"
Billingham said.
"This was the big single
pick-up place," Landis said,
adding that once you would
see someone who you thought
you liked, you would throw
confetti in his or her face.
"The idea was that if they got
it down your throat, you'd
swallow it and it would have a
love potion effect," Landis
said.
Billingham and Landis said
that this custom also could lead
to problems if two people liked
the same person. They said

that they saw two men fighting
over one girl.
"It was very hard not to
transfer your American ways of
looking at things into the situa
tion," Landis said while refer
ring to how he and Billingham
felt in deciding whether or not
to interfere by breaking up
the fight.
Being able to actually ex
perience the Mexican and the
Mayan Indian culture as these
students did, "made tangible
the things the students had
learned in the course," Collier
said. They also learned many
things that were not included
in their books, according to
Hernandez.
"Books will give you the
situation but they won't give
you the reasons," Henandez
said. He explained that the
Mayan Indians' resistance to
the Mexican culture was a de
fense used to preserved their
own beliefs and customs.
Analogy to U.S.
"You can draw an analogy
between the Anglos and the
Chicanos in the United States
and the Indians and the Mexi
cans in Mexico. They both
want to preserve their culture.
They're very protective about
that. That explains, for exam
ple, why the Chamula Indians
are very hostile to outsiders,"
Hernandez said.
"There aren't enough
courses like this. It's the best
way to learn things: study
about them and then apply
them," Billingham said.
However, none of the five
students said they plan to go
into anthropology as a field of
career.
"But there's more to life than
a job. Classes like this change
you and broaden your aware
ness. They break the narrow
mindedness here at Stanford. I
think the awareness a class like
this brings in invaluable in the
way you look at life, because it
exposes you to something dif
ferent. It really makes you
think," Landis concluded.

Reyes.
Distinctiveness
"Each Indian village had its
own distinctiveness," said Val
entin Hernandez, another stu
dent who went on the trip. He
recalled the different dress
styles, dialects, and the rela
tionships the various Indian
communities had with outsid
ers such as Mexicans.
The Chamulas, a modern
Mayan Indian sect, are very
hostile to any outsiders, ac
cording to Hernandez. The
class had read a book on these
people and their ceremonial
center, the town of San Juan
Chamula, Hernandez said.
"They live in a whole diffe

rent world and the most impre
ssive thing was that they pre
served it. It was so different
from this kind of capitalistic
society," Reyes said. She
added that the modern Mayans
do not use machinery and still
farm with sticks.
Another prominent differ
ence noticed by the group was
the attitude toward religion in
the Mayan communities.
More salient
"These are societies in which
the sacred are much more sa
lient than in our secular soci
ety," Collier commented.
"Religion is their whole life.
Compared to the houses that
the people lived in, the church
was a mansion," Billingham

said while referring to the im
portance the Indians put on
maintaining the church by in
vesting much of their income
in it.
Collier said that using 200 or
300 pesos worth of candles in
the church was not unusual for
a family. The average family
earns about 2000 pesos a year,
he added.
The students also had a
chance to see cultural differ
ences among the Mexican
people. Each day when the class
would return to its base, San
Cristubal, a city which is mainly
inhabited by Mexicans, they
realized the difference in cul
tural values from the United
States and from the nearby In

dian villages.
Billingham and Landis com
mented that language posed a
problem for them because
they did not knew Spanish. Bil
lingham cited one example of a
language problem which oc
curred in Mexico City. As he
passed a dog sitting on a street
corner, he had called out,
"Hey, poochie." A man and
woman, a few feet away,
thought that he had been talk
ing to them.
"This guy started chasing
me. I found out later that
'poochie' in Spanish is an insult
to a woman since it means
'slut,' " Billingham said.
"It made me more aware of
what it must be like for some
one coming to this country not
knowing the language," Landis
said.
The class was also fortunate
to be able to see what a "feria"
or festival is like since San Cris
tubal was celebrating the4soth
anniversary of its founding by
the Spaniards in 1528, in addi
tion to having its traditional
week-long celebration after
Easter.
Odd custom
Billingham explained one
custom in which all the young
men and women participate,
which the five students joined
in on also. It involved having
the males walk in one direction
in a circle while the females
walk in the opposite direction.
"You had to use eye contact
on the person who you liked,"
Billingham said.
"This was the big single
pick-up place," Landis said,
adding that once you would
see someone who you thought
you liked, you would throw
confetti in his or her face.
"The idea was that if they got
it down your throat, you'd
swallow it and it would have a
love potion effect," Landis
said.
Billingham and Landis said
that this custom also could lead
to problems if two people liked
the same person. They said

that they saw two men fighting
over one girl.
"It was very hard not to
transfer your American ways of
looking at things into the situa
tion," Landis said while refer
ring to how he and Billingham
felt in deciding whether or not
to interfere by breaking up
the fight.
Being able to actually ex
perience the Mexican and the
Mayan Indian culture as these
students did, "made tangible
the things the students had
learned in the course," Collier
said. They also learned many
things that were not included
in their books, according to
Hernandez.
"Books will give you the
situation but they won't give
you the reasons," Henandez
said. He explained that the
Mayan Indians' resistance to
the Mexican culture was a de
fense used to preserved their
own beliefs and customs.
Analogy to U.S.
"You can draw an analogy
between the Anglos and the
Chicanos in the United States
and the Indians and the Mexi
cans in Mexico. They both
want to preserve their culture.
They're very protective about
that. That explains, for exam
ple, why the Chamula Indians
are very hostile to outsiders,"
Hernandez said.
"There aren't enough
courses like this. It's the best
way to learn things: study
about them and then apply
them," Billingham said.
However, none of the five
students said they plan to go
into anthropology as a field of
career.
"But there's more to life than
a job. Classes like this change
you and broaden your aware
ness. They break the narrow
mindedness here at Stanford. I
think the awareness a class like
this brings in invaluable in the
way you look at life, because it
exposes you to something dif
ferent. It really makes you
think," Landis concluded.

Among the many relics students were able to observe was this classic Mayan stela from the archeological
site of Chinkultik near the Guatemala border.
Studying about Mayan civili
zation in a freshman seminar
may seem ordinary to some
one reading the course de
scription. But Anthropology
Prof. George Collier's course,
"The Maya, Ancient and Mod
ern: Facts and Fantasies," was
noordinary freshman seminar.
Collier and five of his nine
students not only studied from
textbooks, but also visited
Mayan communities in south
ern Mexico over spring break.
"For two quarters we
learned the history of these
Mayan people and their mod
ern politics, society, and be
liefs. But not until we saw them
could we put them into
perspective," said freshman
Evelia Rodriquez.
"The experience really
brought to life the things we
were studying," Collier said.
"We visited many modern
Mayan towns. The purpose of
this was to give the students
some concrete sense of what
the peoples were like," he con
tinued.
The class departed the day
after Easter and arrived in
Mexico City. There they visited
the Mexican National Museum
of Anthropology which, ac
cording to Collier, is one of the
most outstanding museums of
its kind in the area.
Pickpocketing
"We spent the rest of the day
traipsing around Mexico City
getting our pockets picked,"
Collier said in reference to one
student who had $40 stolen
from his pocket.
The remaining seven days
were spent in the state of
Chiapas, which is located
south of Mexico City. Collier
and his students drove 7000
feet up into the highlands of
Chiapas and headquartered
themselves in its colonial capi
tal, San Cristubal de las Casas.
"I've done field research
here before so I've got lots of
contacts," Collier said.
"We had a rented van as a

matter of convenience. We'd
go out during the day to visit
the Indian communities out
side of this provincial town,
San Cristubal," he added.
Pyramid
One day they went to an an
cient Mayan site in the com
munity of Chinkultic and were
able to see a reconstructed
pyramid dating back to bet
ween 500 and 900 A.D.
They also went swimming in
Cenote Azul which, according
to Collier, is an unusual natural
well that is about 50 feet across
and 150 feet deep. Collier
added that archeologists have
recently discovered that ce
notes such as this were once
used by the Mayan Indians as a
place for idol and even human
sacrifices.
The students said they were
impressed with this cenote and
enjoyed swimming in it even
though they had "to be careful
about the quicksand," as John
Landis said.
But the students were awed
more by the people, the mod
ern Mayan Indians, than by the
ancient sites they had an op
portunity to see.
Villages
"What impressed me the
most were the villages," said
Graham Billingham, recalling
the different way of life the
people led, and in particular,
their customs and beliefs.
Billingham said that about
two weeks before the church
in one of the villages they
visited had caught fire. One lit
tle village boy had thought
that the church was burning
because the moon had fallen.
"They're very superstiti
ous," said Rodriquez. She
added that the villagers would
not allow them to take photo
graphs of them or of their
churches because they
thought that a photo would
cause them to lose their soul
which would lead them to be
come sick.
"You're taking something
away from them when you take

their picture," said Carolina
Reyes.

"Each Indian village had its
own distinctiveness," said Val
entin Hernandez, another stu

recalled the different dress

that this custom also could lead
to problems if two people liked
the same person. They said

that they saw two men fighting
over one girl.
"It was very hard not to
transfer your American ways of
looking at things into the situa
tion," Landis said while refer
ring to how he and Billingham
felt in deciding whether or not
to interfere by breaking up
the fight.
Being able to actually ex
perience the Mexican and the
Mayan Indian culture as these
students did, "made tangible
the things the students had
learned in the course," Collier
said. They also learned many
things that were not included
in their books, according to
Hernandez.
"Books will give you the
situation but they won't give
you the reasons," Henandez
said. He explained that the
Mayan Indians' resistance to
the Mexican culture was a de
fense used to preserved their
own beliefs and customs.
Analogy to U.S.
"You can draw an analogy
between the Anglos and the
Chicanos in the United States
and the Indians and the Mexi
cans in Mexico. They both
want to preserve their culture.
They're very protective about
that. That explains, for exam
ple, why the Chamula Indians
are very hostile to outsiders,"
Hernandez said.
"There aren't enough
courses like this. It's the best
way to learn things: study
about them and then apply
them," Billingham said.
However, none of the five
students said they plan to go
into anthropology as a field of
career.
"But there's more to life than
a job. Classes like this change
you and broaden your aware
ness. They break the narrow
mindedness here at Stanford. I
think the awareness a class like
this brings in invaluable in the
way you look at life, because it
exposes you to something dif
ferent. It really makes you
think," Landis concluded.

Among the many relics students were able to observe was this classic Mayan stela from the archeological
site of Chinkultik near the Guatemala border.
Studying about Mayan civili
zation in a freshman seminar
may seem ordinary to some
one reading the course de
scription. But Anthropology
Prof. George Collier's course,
"The Maya, Ancient and Mod
ern: Facts and Fantasies," was
noordinary freshman seminar.
Collier and five of his nine
students not only studied from
textbooks, but also visited
Mayan communities in south
ern Mexico over spring break.
"For two quarters we
learned the history of these
Mayan people and their mod
ern politics, society, and be
liefs. But not until we saw them
could we put them into
perspective," said freshman
Evelia Rodriquez.
"The experience really
brought to life the things we
were studying," Collier said.
"We visited many modern
Mayan towns. The purpose of
this was to give the students
some concrete sense of what
the peoples were like," he con
tinued.
The class departed the day
after Easter and arrived in
Mexico City. There they visited
the Mexican National Museum
of Anthropology which, ac
cording to Collier, is one of the
most outstanding museums of
its kind in the area.
Pickpocketing
"We spent the rest of the day
traipsing around Mexico City
getting our pockets picked,"
Collier said in reference to one
student who had $40 stolen
from his pocket.
The remaining seven days
were spent in the state of
Chiapas, which is located
south of Mexico City. Collier
and his students drove 7000
feet up into the highlands of
Chiapas and headquartered
themselves in its colonial capi
tal, San Cristubal de las Casas.
"I've done field research
here before so I've got lots of
contacts," Collier said.
"We had a rented van as a

matter of convenience. We'd
go out during the day to visit
the Indian communities out
side of this provincial town,
San Cristubal," he added.
Pyramid
One day they went to an an
cient Mayan site in the com
munity of Chinkultic and were
able to see a reconstructed
pyramid dating back to bet
ween 500 and 900 A.D.
They also went swimming in
Cenote Azul which, according
to Collier, is an unusual natural
well that is about 50 feet across
and 150 feet deep. Collier
added that archeologists have
recently discovered that ce
notes such as this were once
used by the Mayan Indians as a
place for idol and even human
sacrifices.
The students said they were
impressed with this cenote and
enjoyed swimming in it even
though they had "to be careful
about the quicksand," as John
Landis said.
But the students were awed
more by the people, the mod
ern Mayan Indians, than by the
ancient sites they had an op
portunity to see.
Villages
"What impressed me the
most were the villages," said
Graham Billingham, recalling
the different way of life the
people led, and in particular,
their customs and beliefs.
Billingham said that about
two weeks before the church
in one of the villages they
visited had caught fire. One lit
tle village boy had thought
that the church was burning
because the moon had fallen.
"They're very superstiti
ous," said Rodriquez. She
added that the villagers would
not allow them to take photo
graphs of them or of their
churches because they
thought that a photo would
cause them to lose their soul
which would lead them to be
come sick.
"You're taking something
away from them when you take

their picture," said Carolina
Reyes.
Distinctiveness
"Each Indian village had its
own distinctiveness," said Val
entin Hernandez, another stu
dent who went on the trip. He
recalled the different dress
styles, dialects, and the rela
tionships the various Indian
communities had with outsid
ers such as Mexicans.
The Chamulas, a modern
Mayan Indian sect, are very
hostile to any outsiders, ac
cording to Hernandez. The
class had read a book on these
people and their ceremonial
center, the town of San Juan
Chamula, Hernandez said.
"They live in a whole diffe

rent world and the most impre
ssive thing was that they pre
served it. It was so different
from this kind of capitalistic
society," Reyes said. She
added that the modern Mayans
do not use machinery and still
farm with sticks.
Another prominent differ
ence noticed by the group was
the attitude toward religion in
the Mayan communities.
More salient
"These are societies in which
the sacred are much more sa
lient than in our secular soci
ety," Collier commented.
"Religion is their whole life.
Compared to the houses that
the people lived in, the church
was a mansion," Billingham

said while referring to the im
portance the Indians put on
maintaining the church by in
vesting much of their income
in it.
Collier said that using 200 or
300 pesos worth of candles in
the church was not unusual for
a family. The average family
earns about 2000 pesos a year,
he added.
The students also had a
chance to see cultural differ
ences among the Mexican
people. Each day when the class
would return to its base, San
Cristubal, a city which is mainly
inhabited by Mexicans, they
realized the difference in cul
tural values from the United
States and from the nearby In

dian villages.
Billingham and Landis com
mented that language posed a
problem for them because
they did not knew Spanish. Bil
lingham cited one example of a
language problem which oc
curred in Mexico City. As he
passed a dog sitting on a street
corner, he had called out,
"Hey, poochie." A man and
woman, a few feet away,
thought that he had been talk
ing to them.
"This guy started chasing
me. I found out later that
'poochie' in Spanish is an insult
to a woman since it means
'slut,' " Billingham said.
"It made me more aware of
what it must be like for some
one coming to this country not
knowing the language," Landis
said.
The class was also fortunate
to be able to see what a "feria"
or festival is like since San Cris
tubal was celebrating the4soth
anniversary of its founding by
the Spaniards in 1528, in addi
tion to having its traditional
week-long celebration after
Easter.
Odd custom
Billingham explained one
custom in which all the young
men and women participate,
which the five students joined
in on also. It involved having
the males walk in one direction
in a circle while the females
walk in the opposite direction.
"You had to use eye contact
on the person who you liked,"
Billingham said.
"This was the big single
pick-up place," Landis said,
adding that once you would
see someone who you thought
you liked, you would throw
confetti in his or her face.
"The idea was that if they got
it down your throat, you'd
swallow it and it would have a
love potion effect," Landis
said.
Billingham and Landis said
that this custom also could lead
to problems if two people liked
the same person. They said

that they saw two men fighting
over one girl.
"It was very hard not to
transfer your American ways of

tal, San Cristubal de las Casas.
"I've done field research
here before so I've got lots of
contacts," Collier said.
"We had a rented van as a

matter of convenience. We'd
go out during the day to visit
the Indian communities out
side of this provincial town,
San Cristubal," he added.
Pyramid
One day they went to an an
cient Mayan site in the com
munity of Chinkultic and were
able to see a reconstructed
pyramid dating back to bet
ween 500 and 900 A.D.
They also went swimming in
Cenote Azul which, according
to Collier, is an unusual natural
well that is about 50 feet across
and 150 feet deep. Collier
added that archeologists have
recently discovered that ce
notes such as this were once
used by the Mayan Indians as a
place for idol and even human
sacrifices.
The students said they were
impressed with this cenote and
enjoyed swimming in it even
though they had "to be careful
about the quicksand," as John
Landis said.
But the students were awed
more by the people, the mod
ern Mayan Indians, than by the
ancient sites they had an op
portunity to see.
Villages
"What impressed me the
most were the villages," said
Graham Billingham, recalling
the different way of life the
people led, and in particular,
their customs and beliefs.
Billingham said that about
two weeks before the church
in one of the villages they
visited had caught fire. One lit
tle village boy had thought
that the church was burning
because the moon had fallen.
"They're very superstiti
ous," said Rodriquez. She
added that the villagers would
not allow them to take photo
graphs of them or of their
churches because they
thought that a photo would
cause them to lose their soul
which would lead them to be
come sick.
"You're taking something
away from them when you take

their picture," said Carolina
Reyes.
Distinctiveness
"Each Indian village had its
own distinctiveness," said Val
entin Hernandez, another stu
dent who went on the trip. He
recalled the different dress
styles, dialects, and the rela
tionships the various Indian
communities had with outsid
ers such as Mexicans.
The Chamulas, a modern
Mayan Indian sect, are very
hostile to any outsiders, ac
cording to Hernandez. The
class had read a book on these
people and their ceremonial
center, the town of San Juan
Chamula, Hernandez said.
"They live in a whole diffe

rent world and the most impre
ssive thing was that they pre
served it. It was so different
from this kind of capitalistic
society," Reyes said. She
added that the modern Mayans
do not use machinery and still
farm with sticks.
Another prominent differ
ence noticed by the group was
the attitude toward religion in
the Mayan communities.
More salient
"These are societies in which
the sacred are much more sa
lient than in our secular soci
ety," Collier commented.
"Religion is their whole life.
Compared to the houses that
the people lived in, the church
was a mansion," Billingham

said while referring to the im
portance the Indians put on
maintaining the church by in
vesting much of their income
in it.
Collier said that using 200 or
300 pesos worth of candles in
the church was not unusual for
a family. The average family
earns about 2000 pesos a year,
he added.
The students also had a
chance to see cultural differ
ences among the Mexican
people. Each day when the class
would return to its base, San
Cristubal, a city which is mainly
inhabited by Mexicans, they
realized the difference in cul
tural values from the United
States and from the nearby In

dian villages.
Billingham and Landis com
mented that language posed a
problem for them because
they did not knew Spanish. Bil
lingham cited one example of a
language problem which oc
curred in Mexico City. As he
passed a dog sitting on a street
corner, he had called out,
"Hey, poochie." A man and
woman, a few feet away,
thought that he had been talk
ing to them.
"This guy started chasing
me. I found out later that
'poochie' in Spanish is an insult
to a woman since it means
'slut,' " Billingham said.
"It made me more aware of
what it must be like for some
one coming to this country not
knowing the language," Landis
said.
The class was also fortunate
to be able to see what a "feria"
or festival is like since San Cris
tubal was celebrating the4soth
anniversary of its founding by
the Spaniards in 1528, in addi
tion to having its traditional
week-long celebration after
Easter.
Odd custom
Billingham explained one
custom in which all the young
men and women participate,
which the five students joined
in on also. It involved having
the males walk in one direction
in a circle while the females
walk in the opposite direction.
"You had to use eye contact
on the person who you liked,"
Billingham said.
"This was the big single
pick-up place," Landis said,
adding that once you would
see someone who you thought
you liked, you would throw
confetti in his or her face.
"The idea was that if they got
it down your throat, you'd
swallow it and it would have a
love potion effect," Landis
said.
Billingham and Landis said
that this custom also could lead
to problems if two people liked
the same person. They said

that they saw two men fighting
over one girl.
"It was very hard not to
transfer your American ways of
looking at things into the situa
tion," Landis said while refer
ring to how he and Billingham
felt in deciding whether or not
to interfere by breaking up
the fight.
Being able to actually ex
perience the Mexican and the
Mayan Indian culture as these
students did, "made tangible
the things the students had
learned in the course," Collier
said. They also learned many
things that were not included
in their books, according to
Hernandez.
"Books will give you the
situation but they won't give
you the reasons," Henandez
said. He explained that the
Mayan Indians' resistance to
the Mexican culture was a de
fense used to preserved their
own beliefs and customs.
Analogy to U.S.
"You can draw an analogy
between the Anglos and the
Chicanos in the United States
and the Indians and the Mexi
cans in Mexico. They both
want to preserve their culture.
They're very protective about
that. That explains, for exam
ple, why the Chamula Indians
are very hostile to outsiders,"
Hernandez said.
"There aren't enough
courses like this. It's the best
way to learn things: study
about them and then apply
them," Billingham said.
However, none of the five
students said they plan to go
into anthropology as a field of
career.
"But there's more to life than
a job. Classes like this change
you and broaden your aware
ness. They break the narrow
mindedness here at Stanford. I
think the awareness a class like
this brings in invaluable in the
way you look at life, because it
exposes you to something dif
ferent. It really makes you
think," Landis concluded.

Among the many relics students were able to observe was this classic Mayan stela from the archeological
site of Chinkultik near the Guatemala border.
