# El Toro Eating Club
## Retiring chef honored 
### Cynthia Elliott Fred Scintillian 
Despite seven years of pride and devotion
from El Toro Eating Club members, the loss of
yet another Stanford "tradition" could not be
prevented.
David "Tommy" Thomas, 69, will be retiring
as the chef of El Toro after 35 years of service
with the University, local fraternities and the
eating clubs.
Every weekday morning he has risen before
six to prepare meals and sometimes to peel
pounds of potatoes because he despises the
powder brands substituted for mashed
potatoes.
In a tribute to this pride and care Tommy has
taken with his meals, current El Toro members
(Bulls) have planned a surprise banquet tonight
at the Bowman Alumni House at 8:30 p.m. It will
feature a list of speakers from Tommy's past and
a special gift from Toro Bulls.
Enough money has been collected to send
Tommy and his wife, Zenobia, on a week-long
all expenses paid trip to the Bahamas. (This is a
surprise and the Bulls ask Tommy's friends not
to spoil it.)
Tommy started working at El Toro in '71 when
he replaced his wife. Before coming to El Toro,
Tommy had worked for the University Food Ser

vices for 28 years.
Since Tommy came to El Toro, this quiet effi
cient man has served meals that any Bull
proudly claims as the best on the "L" (the
nickname for the Stanford Eating clubs build
ing). Sometimes dinner members will come
back to El Toro for dinner after eating in a re
staurant.
If it's an especially good meal, Tommy may
receive a standing ovation as he stands in the
doorway and waves.
Members will always tell about the time
Tommy dropped a whole club's steak dinner on
the floor and then brushed it off and served it
anyway.
Or maybe they'll mention the time he beat the
members out of all their change by pitching
pennies against the kitchen wall, only to return
the money later.
Some stories Tommy prefers not to have told
even though he denies them anyway. "That was
when I was a young man," he insists.
Now that Tommy has become a part of all the
stories and bravado of El Toro, nobody can im
agine what it will be like without him.
"I'm going to miss the boys too" admits
Tommy. "It's been just like home. Every time I
think about it, I can't believe it myself." â€¢
