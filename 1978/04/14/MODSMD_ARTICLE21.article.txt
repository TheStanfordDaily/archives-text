Ouzo . . . Retsina . . . more
Ouzo . . . Ah Greece . . .
Tentlike hangings overshadow
the dance floorand the tension
builds as bazuki music takes us
back to Athens, to the blue,
blue ocean and the spirited
drinking, dancing, and eating
that is the Greek tradition.
An evening at The Balkan Vil
lage is, with a few concessions
to American tastes, an authen

tic Greek experience, com
plete with that special excite
ment that explodes in cafes on
the islands and in Athens after
about 10 p.m. when the burn
ing heat has been replaced by
cool breezes from the sea.
Welcome is the key word in
the social life of Greece; wel
come to strangers, welcome to
anyone willing to laugh and
dance. The Balkan Village
serves authentic Greek
cuisine, simple dishes undis
guised by smothering spices
and concealing sauces.

Equally simple and open is
the overall feeling of the re
staurant. The waiters treat each
guest as an old friend and by
the end of the evening we were
not at all surprised to find our
selves dancing Greek dances
through the aisles of the re
staurant with all of the other
customers, to the music of the
bazuki and the tinkle of the
belly dancer's finger cymbals.
The floor show is definitely
the highlight of a dinner at Bal
kan Village. It begins with sev
eral songs by a Greek band

made of up drums, a bazuki
and an electric guitar.
Then the lights dim and one
of the best belly dancers in the
Bay Area (and I have seen a
few) pulls out almost all the
stops for about 20 minutes.
As she danced, we managed
to devour a deliciously* sea
soned Dzadziki, a cucumber,
yogurt and garlic concoction
($1.25) with flat bread, and a
plate of appetizers consisting
of Dolomades, cucumbers,
real Greek olives with that
marvelous salty tingle, feta

cheese and tomatoes.
I had to remind my dinner
partner to stop watching the
belly dancer and taste the de
licious soup that followed, Av
colemono, while I atean unfor
tunately Americanized Greek
salad, adulterated with iceberg
lettuce and too much vinegar.
The belly dancer finished and I
gasped in awe of both her skill
and the Nemeas red, a crisp
Greek wine at $6 a bottle.
Enter Peter, the owner's son
and Mark, our waiter who leap
to the dance floor and perform

an energetic war dance using a
cloth napkin and displaying
great feats of strength and
coordination.
Later, Mark told us that it was
an "off" night. Apparently, he
once jumped so high with help
from Peter, that he hit the ceil
ing with his head. We believed
him but were impressed
nonetheless by the show we
witnessed.
Somewhere amidst all this
excitement, our main course
arrived, a combination plate
($8.95) with samples of several
of the authentic Greek dishes
offered on the menu, includ
ing, among other things, a de
licious Lamb Kapama, beauti
fully spiced, and those won
derful Dolomades again, well
seasoned meat wrapped in
grape leaves.
The final event of the even
ing was an amazing Ouzo
dance, named after the 96
proof apertif that can
and should be consumed
steadily before and after din
ner if one wishes to emulate
the Greek customs.
Peter Gundunas lifts, in only
his teeth, first a standard
wooden chair, then one of the
solid wooden restaurant ta
bles, and finally a table with a

young girl sitting on it, with
ease.
Both my dinner partner and I
had completely forgotten the
beautiful baklava oozing honey
that appeared before us
We finished our dinner with
Turkish coffee, a thick rich
drink, stronger than expresso,
and of course a glass of ouzo.
One should not miss the
chance to taste Retsina, a
Greek wine tasting of resin that
may not please the American
palate but should at least be,
sampled.
Louis Cundunasand his son
Peter certainly run an unusual
place. Their personal history is
as varied and interesting as
their establishment. Louis
acted Zorba the Greek profes
sionally and Peter will appear
on the Gong Show on
April 20th.
As I sat back in my chair, sip
ping my coffee and relaxing
after a marvelous group Greek
dance with my fellow diners, I
remembered a small cafe on
the Greek isle Santorini, and
the night I danced the night
away with a group of people
who spoke not a word of En
glish. But that is another story.
