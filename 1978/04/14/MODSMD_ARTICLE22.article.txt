# One waterfront attraction for fish fanatics

### 
The Waterfront
Pier 7
San Francisco
The Waterfront could have been just
any seafood restaurant in San Fran
cisco. All the makings were there: no
place to park (Valet parking available at
$1.50), a polyester parent clientele (al
though I must admit a rotund Viennese
tourist and a silver-spangled stretch
pants suit in front of my escort and I
looked interesting), neatly-trimmed
waiters.
Our attitudes changed, however, as
the glass window which forms one en
tire wall of the restaurant glistened be
fore us, affording a wide view of San

Francisco Bay.
The drinks were good and very
reasonable ($3.50 for a lime daiquiri
plus a glass of dry white wine) but —
don't drink too much!
At last we were called to our table on
one of the several balconies overlook
ing the water.
Our waiter was prompt in bringing
the wine list and menus, and quickly
disappeared, allowing us a peaceful
time in which to decide. Scarcely had
we made up our minds when our waiter
returned to take our order of Petrale
Sole and freshly caught California Sea
Bass ($5.75 and $6.25, respectively, in
cluding soup or salad, entree, vegeta

ble, and potatoes or rice).
Other entrees include pasta dishes
(around $4.50 per dinner), meat dishes
($7.00 to $12.00), and a very wide range
of tempting sea-food platters (includ
ing exotic Mahi-mahi).
We hadn't waited long before our
orders arrived, though. The sea bass
was broiled to perfection; a tender and
juicy fillet is a virtuoso piece of broiler
cookery. The flavor of the sole was dis
appointingly lost in the too-strongly
egg-flavored batter in which it was
cooked.
Our dining and conversation were
unencumbered by an omnipresent wai
ter; yet when we needed something,

he came immediately to our side. The
service, I repeat, was sterling.
While waiting for my escort, I struck
up a conversation with the bartender. A
pleasant man, he told me the story of
the boats outside, and how the one had
just that day crashed into the other
when its reverse gear had failed, and
how the boats belonged to the group of
seamen who, while drunk, safely pilot
through the rough waters of the bay
every ship wishing to come to port.
I thanked the bartender for making
my evening complete as my companion
rejoined me, and we left The Water
front, a satisfied couple.
