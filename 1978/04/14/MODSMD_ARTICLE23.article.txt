Jose's Pizza & Specialty Restaurant

When Jose left Cuba to come to the Un
ited States in 1959, he had $40 in his poc
ket. Power had just changed hands from
the corrupt regime of Batista to the com
munism of Fidel Castro, and for Jose, it
was time to leave.
Jose's rise to success is enough to con
vince even the most disillusioned of
capitalists of the merits of their political
system.
Today, he is enjoying a success which
can only be attained by hard work, innova
tiveness, and plain friendliness.
Taking advantage of his Cuban heritage,
Jose now serves a variety of South Ameri
can dishes. Probably the most famous is
Paella Valenciana, which must be ordered
24 hours in advance and has a four person
minimum.
Spanish in origin, the Paella Valenciana
is a combination of safron rice, string
beans, peas, clams, squid, shrimp, crab,
and chicken.

Boasting to serve "fourcuisines in one,"
Jose's offers Spanish, Argentine, Bolivian
and Cuban dishes and their pizza. Jose was
once asked to make 300 saltenas for the
Bolivian Independence celebration, ag
reed, and has been serving them ever
since.
The Saltena, also known as Empanada,
the national dish of Bolivia, is a meat or
chicken pie baked with a blend of olives,
peas, potatoes, eggs, and raisins.
The Cuban influence on the menu is
found predominantly in the various
sandwiches and the famous Wheat Germ
Crust Pizza, from which Jose's reputation
as the only wheat germ pizza place began.
By far and away the most popular item
on the menu, the Wheat Germ Crust Pizza
is quite good, and is available with a variety
of different toppings.
The "Cuban Style Sandwiches" include
a number of specially seasoned hambur
gers, roast beef, and pork sandwiches.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, Jose also
offers their "Argentinean Style Pizza," also
known elsewhere as Chicago pizza, Bos
ton pizza, and plain deep-dish pizza. It

finishes a close second to the Wheat Germ
Crust.
Also Argentinean is the Porter House
Steak ($7.95), served with Cuban black
beans, and either spanish rice or rice with
squid. Smoked duck ($5.15) and Smoked
Spare ribs ($5.95) are also included under
the specialty dinners.
For dessert, Jose's offers Flan (egg cus
tard) Arroz con leche (rice pudding), and
fried bananas, which are a must.
The atmosphere is clean and informal,
and the prices are quite reasonable.
Jose's features a good selection of
White, Rose, and Red wines, as well as a
vare variety of imported beers. They are
open every day except Monday, serving
lunch from 11:30-2:30 and dinner from
5:30-10 p.m.
Last October, Jose's closed down be
cause of fire damage caused by a faulty
extension cord, and just recently
reopened. For those of you who have not
made it back, or never made it in the first
place, Jose's is definitely a place worth try
ing.
