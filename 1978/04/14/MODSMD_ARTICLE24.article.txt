Los Angeles—The Stanford Cardinal baseball team was shutout
by the University of Southern California Trojans last night 7-0 in
the first game of their most critical league series this season.
The loss evens the Cards' record at 2-2 in the Pacific-8. The
Trojans' win put them on top of the Pac-8 with a 2-1 record.
The No. 1 ranked Trojans outhit the Cards 12-7 in the nine
inning contest under the lights at USC's Dedeaux Field. Junior
Brian Hayes went the distance for the Trojans and collected his
seventh win against two losses in the '78 season.
"We're walking too many guys," said Stanford coach Mark
Marquess. "We're just giving them too much. If we hadn't walked
so many, it would have been a different game."
Assistant coach Dean Stotz added, "Our pitching is not giving
us a chance at all."
Three Stanford pitchers combined to walk 10 SC batters, two of
whom came around to score.

USC jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the first and added a second
run two innings later. With the score 2-0 in the fourth, theTrojans
unleashed a vicious attack at the plate with the first three batters
pounding out three consecutive hits which yielded one run off
starter Mark Abbondola.
With the score 3-0, Brian Harrison came on in relief of Abbon
dola and allowed two more runs to score on a double to left that
became the first out as Trojan second baseman Gerald Price tried
to stretch it into a triple.
Harrison had control problems throughout his appearance and
walked the next two batters before giving up a RBI single to
designated hitter Tim Tolman.
