The script usually goes like this:
Against teams not quite in Stanford's caliber,
coach Dick Could rests his top players and lets
his less heralded but certainly talented players
take the spotlight.
The match is usually decided after the singles
as the Cards win at least five of the six matches.
Then Gould shows he has more depth than
other coaches ever dreamed of by letting
nationally-ranked players such as Greg Hing,
Dave Larson and Jeff Jones show their talent in
the doubles.
The result is usually a routine victory for the
Cards, but not Wed. as they had to scramble
to down the University of San Diego, 6-3.
At the start it did look as if the No. 1-ranked
Cards would have no problems at all against
USD. Peter Rennert handled Milos Dimitrivic
6-3, 7-5. Jim Hodges played excellent tennis in
beating Rick Goldberg 6-3, 6-1. Lloyd Bourne
pulled no punches and trounced Parr Svensson
6-1, 6-0.
But then the trouble started. In the feature
match USC's No. 1 Scott Lipton baffled John Rast
with his heavily top spinning ground strokes and
took Rast into straight sets 6-3, 7-5. Andy Chase
and Dave Becker had no trouble in winning their
first sets easily, but Chase lost his volley and the
next two sets. Becker also dropped the next two
sets, and all of a sudden the Cards were in a
dogfight tied 3-3 going into the doubles.

With USC threatening, Could pulled out his
bigguns — Perry Wright, Matt Mitchell and |ohn
McEnroe, who all happened to be wandering by
the courts trying to get a little practice in before
the Cal match today.
Mitchell and Wright teamed up at first dou
bles and the Pacific Coast Doubles finalists were
strictly business in whipping Lipton and Dimit
rivic 6-3, 6-0. Peter Rennert and Lloyd Bourne
don't usually play together but they played well
in winning the second doubles match 6-3, 7-5.
John McEnroe, playing in the unbelievable
position of third doubles, teamed with Andy
Chase to straight set the USD opponents 7-5,
6-3, and the Cards (14-0) had their 27th straight
match victory.
Stanford plays eighth-ranked California today
at 1 p.m. at the Stanford Tennis Stadium. The
Cards have not lost a home match in over two
years but will have their work cut out for them
today against the tough Golden Bears.
The Bears are led by Cary Stansbury, All-
America Marty Davis and Chris (Slam) Dunk. Cal
is coming off a 5-4 upset of USC last week in Los
Angeles.

coach Dick Could rests his top players and lets
his less heralded but certainly talented players
take the spotlight.
The match is usually decided after the singles
as the Cards win at least five of the six matches.
Then Gould shows he has more depth than
other coaches ever dreamed of by letting
nationally-ranked players such as Greg Hing,
Dave Larson and Jeff Jones show their talent in
the doubles.
The result is usually a routine victory for the
Cards, but not Wed. as they had to scramble
to down the University of San Diego, 6-3.
At the start it did look as if the No. 1-ranked
Cards would have no problems at all against
USD. Peter Rennert handled Milos Dimitrivic
6-3, 7-5. Jim Hodges played excellent tennis in
beating Rick Goldberg 6-3, 6-1. Lloyd Bourne
pulled no punches and trounced Parr Svensson
6-1, 6-0.
But then the trouble started. In the feature
match USC's No. 1 Scott Lipton baffled John Rast
with his heavily top spinning ground strokes and
took Rast into straight sets 6-3, 7-5. Andy Chase
and Dave Becker had no trouble in winning their
first sets easily, but Chase lost his volley and the
next two sets. Becker also dropped the next two
sets, and all of a sudden the Cards were in a
dogfight tied 3-3 going into the doubles.

With USC threatening, Could pulled out his
bigguns — Perry Wright, Matt Mitchell and |ohn
McEnroe, who all happened to be wandering by
the courts trying to get a little practice in before
the Cal match today.
Mitchell and Wright teamed up at first dou
bles and the Pacific Coast Doubles finalists were
strictly business in whipping Lipton and Dimit
rivic 6-3, 6-0. Peter Rennert and Lloyd Bourne
don't usually play together but they played well
in winning the second doubles match 6-3, 7-5.
John McEnroe, playing in the unbelievable
position of third doubles, teamed with Andy
Chase to straight set the USD opponents 7-5,
6-3, and the Cards (14-0) had their 27th straight
match victory.
Stanford plays eighth-ranked California today
at 1 p.m. at the Stanford Tennis Stadium. The
Cards have not lost a home match in over two
years but will have their work cut out for them
today against the tough Golden Bears.
The Bears are led by Cary Stansbury, All-
America Marty Davis and Chris (Slam) Dunk. Cal
is coming off a 5-4 upset of USC last week in Los
Angeles.
