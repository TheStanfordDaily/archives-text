# Three frontliners
## Four cagers choose the Farm 
### David Georgette 
Faced with the loss of three
frontline seniors, Stanford
basketball coach Dick Dißiaso
and his staff have landed four
top basketball recruits in "what
could well be the finest recruit
ing year we've had in four years
at Stanford," according to Di-
Biaso.
The group is headed by prep
All-America forward Brian
Welch of Capital High School
in Boise, Idaho, and All-CIF
guard Doug Marty of Long
Beach Millikan High.
Two Los Angeles products
have also chosen to attend
Stanford — Terry Smith, a
6-foot-4 guard-forward from
University High and 6-9V2
center Scott Howard of North
Hollywood High.
"Welch and Marty are two of
the best high school players on
the West Coast," said Dißiaso.
"Smith provides us with valu
able versatility, and Howard is
a raw talent with excellent po
tential."
Marty was a unanimous first
team All-CIF 4-A choice and
was named to the California
All-State team by Basketball
Weekly. The 6-2 guard aver
aged 23.7 points per game, hit
ting on 54 per cent of his shots
from the field and carried a 84
per cent accuracy from the foul
line. He was one of the top 10
scorers from the Los Angeles
area, and also averaged five as
sists a game.
"Doug is a great prospect
because of his shooting and
ballhandling talents," Dißiaso
said.
"He's one of the best guards
in the state," said assistant
coach Tom McLaughlin. "We
decided we needed only one
guard. Then we went for some
big players up front."
Up front
The 6-7, 195 lb. Welch aver
aged 23.1 points per game this
season after having led Boise
Capital to the state title as a
junior with a 21.2 average. This
season he hit on a sizzling 65
per cent of his shots from the
floor.
"Brian is probably the most

highly-recruited player ever to
come out of Idaho," said Di-
Biaso. "He is an outstanding
outside shooterwith very good
agility and ballhandling ability
for his size."
Stanford's academic stand
ing and the work of a Stanford
alumnus in the Boise area were
reportedly instrumental in
Welch's choice.
Smith, who shot 65 per cent
from the flooras a juniorand 58
per cent as a senior, averaged
17 points, 11 rebounds and six
assists per game this season.
Because he was the tallest
playeron his team, Smith spent
most of his time at center, but
Dißiaso expects him to be a
swingman for the Cards.
"He's an excellent defensive
player and proved his ability to
play in the backcourt in the
Olympic Development League
and Superstars Camp last
summer," said Dißiaso.

Howard averaged 16 points
and nine rebounds per game
last year in leading North Hol
lywood to a 21-4 record. "Scott
skipped a grade in junior high
and just turned 17," said Di-
Biaso. "He's still growing and
maturing. He has the potential
to be a top-flight center."
The Cards, who have six
scholarships available this sea
son, are still pursuing a big
frontliner from Los Angeles.
McLaughlin said the Cards'
last-place finish in the Pacific-8
did not damage the recruiting.
"Most of the kids were our top
prospects from day one last
June," he said, adding the
Cards' good start in noncon
ference games contributed to
persuading some of the re
cruits to select Stanford.
"Their talents blend with the
guys who are already here,"
said Dißiaso.
