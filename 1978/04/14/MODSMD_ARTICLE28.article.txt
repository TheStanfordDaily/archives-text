## use, UCLA stars head double dual 
### Chris Haft 
Tomorrow Stanford Stadium
will be transformed into the Taj
Mahal of collegiate track and
field as two of the nation's top
track teams converge here in a
double dual meet.
In one half of the double
dual, Stanford faces the re
doubtable UCLA Bruins while
USC challenges California. A
crowd of about 20,000 is ex
pected for the meet which be
gins at 1:15 p.m.
The Cardinals are hoping to
hand UCLA its second con
secutive defeat, but history —
and a lot of Bruin talent —is
against this occurring. The
Bruins, who were upset by
Oregon last Saturday, have de
feated Stanford 12 straight
times.
"We've always had good
meets with UCLA — lately, of
course, they've been some
what superior," admitted Stan
ford coach Payton )ordan.
However, Jordan said he be
lieves a highly motivated team
effort can make the difference.
"The stimulus is there for a re
ally competitive output on the
part of everybody. A team that
is inspired can turn the meet
around."
Jordan emphasized superla
tive performances by one or
two athletes won't be enough
"Everybody must perform well.
This has to be a team assault,
where everybody gives a little
bit extra. We can't expect one
man to carry the rest of the
team by himself."
Top competition
The Stanford-UCLA half of
the meet features several out
standing matchups. The 100-
meter dash promises to be
quite exciting, with UCLA's
Gregory Foster (10.1 wind
aided) battling Stanford ace
James Lofton (10.3). "It should
be a challenge," Lofton said.
In the 200, the Bruins offer
Millard Hampton (21.0), the
1976 Olympic silver medalist,

against Lofton (20.9). However,
both may be outdone by USC's
Clancy Edwards, whose 20.0
represents the world's fastest
time this year.
"The sprint relays will really
be good races," Lofton pre
dicted. USC has the country's
best times in both the400(39.1)
and 1600 (3:05.5) relays, while
Stanford ranks third nationally
at 39.7and 3:06.6, respectively.
UCLA is close behind with
times of 40.4 in the 400 and
3:09.1 in the 1600.
The most closely watched
athlete will probably be Bruin
pole-vaulter Mike Tully, who
holds the world indoor record
of 18-s'/«.
Tully has been talking about
breaking the outdoor record as
well, and Jordan said he
wouldn't be surprised to see it
happen here. "We have a great
vaulting pit at Stanford, and a
number of records have been
set in it. Tully is on a hot streak
right now and could go for
another record Saturday."

where everybody gives a little
bit extra. We can't expect one
man to carry the rest of the
team by himself."
Top competition
The Stanford-UCLA half of
the meet features several out
standing matchups. The 100-
meter dash promises to be
quite exciting, with UCLA's
Gregory Foster (10.1 wind
aided) battling Stanford ace
James Lofton (10.3). "It should
be a challenge," Lofton said.
In the 200, the Bruins offer
Millard Hampton (21.0), the
1976 Olympic silver medalist,

against Lofton (20.9). However,
both may be outdone by USC's
Clancy Edwards, whose 20.0
represents the world's fastest
time this year.
"The sprint relays will really
be good races," Lofton pre
dicted. USC has the country's
best times in both the400(39.1)
and 1600 (3:05.5) relays, while
Stanford ranks third nationally
at 39.7and 3:06.6, respectively.
UCLA is close behind with
times of 40.4 in the 400 and
3:09.1 in the 1600.
The most closely watched
athlete will probably be Bruin
pole-vaulter Mike Tully, who
holds the world indoor record
of 18-s'/«.
Tully has been talking about
breaking the outdoor record as
well, and Jordan said he
wouldn't be surprised to see it
happen here. "We have a great
vaulting pit at Stanford, and a
number of records have been
set in it. Tully is on a hot streak
right now and could go for
another record Saturday."
