# Women clinch match in singles
## 
### Alfred Nakatsuma 
Wednesday afternoon the
Stanford women netters
played a non-league match
here against the University of
San Diego. In singles, the
Cards won five of six matches,
enough to claim victory even
though all three doubles
matches were lost. The victory
keeps Stanford undefeated
and moves its record to 13-0.
San Diego's No. 1 player
Lucey Cordon got off to a slow
start, and committed many un
forced errors. Later in the
match, she began hitting bet
ter, but the strokes of Stan
ford's Kathy Jordan kept her
down. Jordan played serve
and-volley effectively, and vol
leyed well after approaching
from the backcourt. She tried
to take advantage of Gordon's
slowness by hitting with more
pace than she normally does.
Jordan's sister Barbara had
some difficulty in the second
set with Suzi Beatty, but bore
down with deep hard shots to
take the match. Diane Morri
son, as usual, had a relatively
easy time in downing her op
ponent, Suzan Wright.
Donna Rubin came from be

hind after trailing 2-5 in the first
set, and rallied to win 11 of the
next 14 games.
Probably the most impres
sive player on the court, how
ever, was Nancy Rudd. Coach
Ann Could said, "I'm always
proud of the way Nancy plays,
but I was especially proud of
her today." Her usual consis
tent, deep backcourt shots
were complemented by some
spicy volleys at the net.
In doubles, USD got re
venge. Its teams defeated Stan
ford seniors Sally Thompson
and Audrey Kemp, Pam Gard
ner and Hilary Landorf and
freshmen Wendy Richardson
and Corinne Nevinny.
Sunday at 9 a.m. Stanford
takes one of the top five teams
in the country — Florida. "The
match will be very tough," said
Could.
