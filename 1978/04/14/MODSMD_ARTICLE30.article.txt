## Stanford faces Chico State in first round 
### 
Gunning for its third straight league crown,
the Stanford men's volleyball team faces
Chico State at 5 p.m. today in a first-round
matchup of the Northern California Col
legiate Volleyball Conference Champion
ships at Berkeley.
Coach Art Lambert's Cards (11-8 overall)
finished undefeated in Southern Division
play with an 8-0 mark. Chico, second to
California in the league's Northern Division,
finished with a 4-2 record in division play.
Cal will be taking on Southern runner-up
Santa Clara in its first game at 8 p.m. tonight.
The winners of the first round game

matches meet tomorrow at 8 p.m. for the
championship.
The Cards defeated Santa Clara twice this
season three games to one. Against Chico,
Stanford won 3-1 on the road and 3-2 at
home. The Cards split with Cal, dropping a
five-game decision at Berkeley in March, but
then coming back last week for a four-game
triumph in Maples Pavilion.
"The win over Cal was a big one for us
heading into the tournament," said Lambert.
"But they beat us in Berkeley before, and
playing in their gym will be a whole different
environment. Cal is extremely tough on its
home court."
