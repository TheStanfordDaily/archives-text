Stanford is well represented out of state this week with the
women's golf team participating in the Lady Sun Devil Tourna
ment in Phoenix, Ariz., and the men taking part in the All-America
Tournament in Houston, Tex.
After two rounds of competition the men stand 15th in a
field of 26 teams with a score of 606. Oklahoma State leads with
560 while Georgia and Brigham Young are second and third with
571 and 576, respectively.
The Cards' task has been more difficult because they had their
clubs stolen and are playing with borrowed ones.
Mike Peck is the top Stanford golfer in 15th with a 147 total.
Doug Clarke trails with 148.
Bud Ardell leads aCard trio bunched further back. He has 155,
Jeff Armstrong follows with 156 and Steve Schroeder has 157.
7th in Arizona
The women are seventh of 15 teams with a team total of 687.
Arizona State leads the pack with 627, and tied for second place
are Tulsa and San Jose State.
Individually, Stanford's Sally Voss is 13th after two rounds with
159. Other Cardinal scores for the women are Patty Pichon and
Allison Finney with 174, Nola Miyasaki with 180 and Sue Hoover
with 203.
Both tournaments run through tomorrow.
