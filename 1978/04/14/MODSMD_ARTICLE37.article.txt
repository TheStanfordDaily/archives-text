Europeans question Carter's ability
Paris — President Jimmy Carter's delay in deciding on
the neutron warhead has intensified criticism of his
foreign policies in the West European press and among
government officials. Some even express doubts about
his grasp of foreign affairs.
This questioning of Washington's actions seems to be
getting louder as Carter's first-year honeymoon fades
into the past and major European allies feel disap
pointed on critical issues.
Carter announced last week he was deferring a deci
sion on whether to produce the new neutron warhead
pending evidence of new Soviet "restraint" in the arms
race. The delay was interpreted by many Europeans —
including both proponents and opponents of the
weapon — as an inability to make a decision.
India wants 'device' explained
New Delhi, India — The Indian government demanded
yesterday that the United States explain reports that a
secret CIA mountaineering team abandoned a nuclear
device on a Himalayan peak 13 years ago. Officials are
especially concerned that the radioactive material could
contaminate the Ganges River, a vital waterway.
The report said the abandoned device contained
plutonium 238, which remains dangerously radioactive
for up to 500 years. Once its outer covering corrodes, it
said, the material could contaminate the Ganges
watershed with cancer-causing poisons by seeping into
tributaries of the giant river. The Ganges is sacred in the
Hindu religion and is the principal waterway of north
eastern India.
Younger, Davis lead voter poll
San Francisco — Attorney General Evelle Younger and
former Los Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis are virtually
even in voter preference and Assemblyman Ken Maddy
is close behind in the latest California Poll on the Repub
lican gubernatorial race.
The survey, based on interviews with 1300 California
adult Republicans from March 27-April 3, showed 23 per
cent preferred Younger, 22 per cent picked Davis and 18
per cent chose Maddy.
San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson was in fourth place with
a 12 percent share of the vote, and state Sen. John Briggs
trailed with 2 per cent.
Three miners killed in accident
Grundy, Va. — Three miners were trapped by a slate
fall in a coal mine near here yesterday, and a spokesman
for the mining company said all were presumed to have
died.
Mike Muslin, a spokesman for the Island Creek Coal
Co., said the accident in the firm's Beatrice mine just
east of here in Buchanan County "appears to have been
a roof fall."
"Three people were trapped, and now it seems that
they were killed," Muslin said.
Five men were asphyxiated April 4 in an accident at the
McClure No. 2 mine of the Clinchfield Coal Co. near the
community of Duty in Dickenson County.
Voyager 2 back under control
Pasadena — The Voyager 2 spacecraft accepted a

command sent through nearly 295 million miles of space
yesterday, ending a weeklong radio failure that had
threatened its mission to Jupiter and Saturn.
The ship confirmed the command shortly before 4:30
a.m. and the engineers were back in control.
Jet Propulsion Laboratory spokesman Frank Bristow
said the cause of the failure had not been determined,
"but if we had to guess, I suppose we'd say it must have
been some sort of short-circuit."
Shamshak offers 'Strangled tapes
Los Angeles — George Shamshak told a newspaper
here that he tape recorded the murder of a Hillside
Stranger victim and knows who committed all 13 of the
killings.
In a copyrighted story yesterday the Los Angeles
Herald Examiner reported that Shamshak telephoned
the paper Saturday offering to sell for $10,000 "evidence
the police overlooked."
He said he won't give the material to police because
he hasn't been offered immunity in the case.
Shamshak told police he was driving Peter Jones' van
while Jones committed murder in the back.
Jones was released last week after Los Angeles Police
questioned him in connection with the stranglings.
He told the paper he accidentally taped the murder of
Kathleen Robinson.
"I was taping music and she just happened to be there
and I forgot to shut it off," he said.
Shamshak also told the reporters that one girl who
eventually became a strangler victim participated in
Robinson's murder.
Tax payers slow in filing returns
Washington — Americans have an extra two days to
struggle with their taxes this year, but the Internal Re
venue Service is still expecting a big crush of last-minute

until next Monday to get their returns in the mail.
3y last week, 30 million Americans still had not filed
returns, an increase from 27 million at the same time last
year.
