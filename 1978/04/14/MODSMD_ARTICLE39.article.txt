# Grupo Moncada tours

Symbolic of a relaxation of
Cuban-U.S. diplomatic tensions,
one of Cuba's most popular musical
groups, the Grupo Moncada, has
been allowed to enter the United
States for a six week entertainment
tour.
The Grupo Moncada will give one
of its first U.S. performances here on
Tuesday at 8 p.m. in Kresge Au
ditorium.
"The Grupo's tour signals the end
of what was left of the cultural bloc
kade against Cuba," said Political
Science Prof. Richard Fagen who was
largely responsible for bringing the
group to Stanford.
The eight member group is thefirst
musical group allowed by U.S. au
thorities to enter the country since
the United States broke diplomatic
ties with Cuba in 1961.
"The Grupo's performance would
not have been possible two years ago
during the Kissinger-Nixon era," said

Fagen.
In 1976 the visas of a group of
Cuban scholars planning to attend a
U.S. conference were denied by
then-Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer because of Cuba's involve
ment in Angola, according to Fagen.
But with the change of administra
tions, restrictions have been relaxed
to the point where Fagen believes
President Jimmy Carter would not
restrict Cubans traveling in the Un
ited States because "the administra
tion does not want Cuba to retaliate
diplomatically."
Grupo Moncada's performance
will provide the Stanford community
with the first opportunity to hear the
songs of the revolutionary Cuban
song movement, the "Nueva Trova."
The group will also perform tradi
tional Cuban, Afro-Cuban and Latin
music utilizing 41 different instru
ments.
Although the group has traveled
throughout the world and become

one of Cuba's foremost talents, all
the musicians have other jobs and
consider themselves an amateur
group. Crupo Moncada performs in
schools, universities, work centers
and amateur festivals in Cuba.
The U.S. tour is being sponsored
by the Center for Cuban Studies, a
nonprofit informational center in
New York.
