"We've been checking out
Bank of America and they look
pretty shaky all over," said Francis
Wong. "B. of A. isn't a progressive
force in South Africa with apar
theid, and it's not a progressive
force in America without apar
theid . . . the path we must take is
clear."
Wong was a keynote speaker
yesterday in the joint Stanford
Committee for a Responsible In
vestment Policy (SCRIP) and the
Anti-Bakke Decision Coalition
(ABDC) rally and protest march
against the Bank of America.
The protest was aimed at the
bank's loans which total $188 mill
ion to South Africa. SCRIP mem
bers said the loans help maintain
apartheid. The protest was also di
rected against the bank's alleged
practices of redlining, union
busting and racial discrimination.
Redlining is the use of dis
criminatory loan practices against
people in low income areas.
March to B. of A.
The 1 3 /4-hour event culminated
at the downtown main Palo Alto
branch of Bankof America, on Lyt
ton Ave. when about 85 protes
ters, some carrying signs and
many chanting "B. of A., Bank of
apartheid," entered the building.
Stuart Ozer, SCRIP spokesper
son, confronted local bank man
ager A. Race with the charges
against Bankof America. "Doesn't
the bank have anything better to
do with its money?" Ozer asked.
Race said he would forward the
messages to "the powers that
be." Race also denied Ozer's
charges of redlining in the Palo
Alto branch, and handed Ozer
several copies of a Bank of
America pamphlet entitled,
"Some straight talk on South Af
rica: An interview with President

Tom Clausen."
The pamphlet states that al
though Clausen feels "the apar
theid system is loathsome," he
does not feel that human rights
and political systems should be
the basis for trade.
According to the pamphlet,
Clausen also feels that "there is a
good deal of evidence which
suggests the presence of Ameri
can firms in South Africa is a help
ful influence in upgrading the
pay, working conditions and op
portunities for the blacks.
Asked whether she had any
comments on the presence of the
demonstrators, a Bank of America
employee said, "I don't have any
comments, shit, they should get
out of here."
Hoover Tower
Before marching down Univer
sity Avenue to the bank, the pro
testers assembled in front of
Hoover Tower for what was sup
posed to be an address to Clenn
Campbell, Hoover Institution Di
rector and Regent of the Univer
sity of California.
The UC regents will soon be
considering a Bank of America re
ferendum on which Stanford trus
tees voted to abstain on Tuesday.
As the protesters were march
ing toward the tower, however,
Campbell was spotted by two
Daily editors near Tresidder
Union walking in the opposite di
rection.
"I don't even know what I'm
supposed to be voting on,"
Campbell said.
Although Campbell was not at
Hoover, Wong spoke to the
crowd and to George Marotta,
public affairs coordinator at
Hoover, asking that SCRIP'S and
ABDC's demands be forwarded to
Campbell.
"Until now," added Wong,
"anti-Bakke and anti-apartheid
causes have been separate things.
Bank of America has not exactly
been a progressive force in either
case."
Meanwhile, protesters
chanted, "Regent Campbell, you
can't hide; we know you're on
Bakke's side," and "UC Regents,
you can't hide; we know you're
on apartheid's side."
White Plaza rally
At noon, more than 100 mem
bers of the Stanford community
gathered fora rally in White Plaza.

SCRIP spokesperson Todd
Bauman began the rally by attack
ing the trustees' decision to abs
tain on the Bank of America re
ferendum last Tuesday.
Bauman said that the trustees'
action in making a distinction be
tween loans to the public and pri
vate sectors in South Africa, had
nothing to do with the recom
mendations of the Commission
on Investment Responsibility
(CIR).
Following Bauman's speech,
Willetta Green, a representative
of the Black Students Union (BSU)
spoke.
"We've been checking out

The 1 3 /4-hour event culminated
at the downtown main Palo Alto
branch of Bankof America, on Lyt
ton Ave. when about 85 protes
ters, some carrying signs and
many chanting "B. of A., Bank of
apartheid," entered the building.
Stuart Ozer, SCRIP spokesper
son, confronted local bank man
ager A. Race with the charges
against Bankof America. "Doesn't
the bank have anything better to
do with its money?" Ozer asked.
Race said he would forward the
messages to "the powers that
be." Race also denied Ozer's
charges of redlining in the Palo
Alto branch, and handed Ozer
several copies of a Bank of
America pamphlet entitled,
"Some straight talk on South Af
rica: An interview with President

Tom Clausen."
The pamphlet states that al
though Clausen feels "the apar
theid system is loathsome," he
does not feel that human rights
and political systems should be
the basis for trade.
According to the pamphlet,
Clausen also feels that "there is a
good deal of evidence which
suggests the presence of Ameri
can firms in South Africa is a help
ful influence in upgrading the
pay, working conditions and op
portunities for the blacks.
Asked whether she had any
comments on the presence of the
demonstrators, a Bank of America
employee said, "I don't have any
comments, shit, they should get
out of here."
Hoover Tower
Before marching down Univer
sity Avenue to the bank, the pro
testers assembled in front of
Hoover Tower for what was sup
posed to be an address to Clenn
Campbell, Hoover Institution Di
rector and Regent of the Univer
sity of California.
The UC regents will soon be
considering a Bank of America re
ferendum on which Stanford trus
tees voted to abstain on Tuesday.
As the protesters were march
ing toward the tower, however,
Campbell was spotted by two
Daily editors near Tresidder
Union walking in the opposite di
rection.
"I don't even know what I'm
supposed to be voting on,"
Campbell said.
Although Campbell was not at
Hoover, Wong spoke to the
crowd and to George Marotta,
public affairs coordinator at
Hoover, asking that SCRIP'S and
ABDC's demands be forwarded to
Campbell.
"Until now," added Wong,
"anti-Bakke and anti-apartheid
causes have been separate things.
Bank of America has not exactly
been a progressive force in either
case."
Meanwhile, protesters
chanted, "Regent Campbell, you
can't hide; we know you're on
Bakke's side," and "UC Regents,
you can't hide; we know you're
on apartheid's side."
White Plaza rally
At noon, more than 100 mem
bers of the Stanford community
gathered fora rally in White Plaza.

SCRIP spokesperson Todd
Bauman began the rally by attack
ing the trustees' decision to abs
tain on the Bank of America re
ferendum last Tuesday.
Bauman said that the trustees'
action in making a distinction be
tween loans to the public and pri
vate sectors in South Africa, had
nothing to do with the recom
mendations of the Commission
on Investment Responsibility
(CIR).
Following Bauman's speech,
Willetta Green, a representative
of the Black Students Union (BSU)
spoke.
"We've been checking out
Bank of America and they look
pretty shaky all over," said Francis
Wong. "B. of A. isn't a progressive
force in South Africa with apar
theid, and it's not a progressive
force in America without apar
theid . . . the path we must take is
clear."
Wong was a keynote speaker
yesterday in the joint Stanford
Committee for a Responsible In
vestment Policy (SCRIP) and the
Anti-Bakke Decision Coalition
(ABDC) rally and protest march
against the Bank of America.
The protest was aimed at the
bank's loans which total $188 mill
ion to South Africa. SCRIP mem
bers said the loans help maintain
apartheid. The protest was also di
rected against the bank's alleged
practices of redlining, union
busting and racial discrimination.
Redlining is the use of dis
criminatory loan practices against
people in low income areas.
