# Reshuffles made in one COP slate
## 
### Matt Mettler 
Citing academic reasons, Don
Pena officially resigned Tuesday
night from the Council of Presidents
(COP) slate of George Drysdale,
Duncan Evered and Gwyn Felt.
ASSU bylaws prohibit anyone from
appearing on the ballot who hadn't
filed by Monday's deadline.
Nevertheless, Michael Bush, a junior
in industrial engineering, will cam
paign with the slate.
If the slate is elected, Felt indicated
Bush will be appointed as the slate's
fourth member. Bush's appointment
will then have to be confirmed by the
ASSU Senate before he can officially
become a COP member. The Senate
also has to confirm the results of the
election.
Pena, in resigning from the slate,
gave his "wholehearted support" of
his former running mates. He said he
initially thought he could handle the
time commitment of being on the
COP, but after further consideration

he decided he couldn't.
Felt confirmed that Pena's resigna
tion from the slate did not involve
any disagreement with his running
mates.
Bush is president of the Society of
Black Scientists and Engineers and is
also student representative on the
University's affirmative action com
mittee.
He said that he had considered
running for the COP before joining
the Drysdale slate, but that he hadn't
been able to find three others who
wanted to run.
"Problems with the University's
lack of commitment to affirmative ac
tion," was one of the reasons Bush
cited forbecomingaCOPcandidate.
He said joining the slate did not
represent a shift in the slate's posi
tion.
He added that he didn't think the
Drysdale slate would be penalized in
the campaign by the reshuffling of
the ticket.


Just another Tequila Sunrise
Perhaps it was an attempt to attract more housing draw
participants. Then again, perhaps it was a scurvy
prevention workshop. One tning's certain: it was 6 a.m.
Yesterday's second annual Alpha Sigma Phi Tequila Sun
rise attracted several dozen Cowell Cluster residents and

a ZAP house water balloon. Last year's event featured a
band selected solely for its volume — and even President
Lyman called the police to complain. This year a patrol
ling policeman threatened to pull the plug before the
party had even begun, unless the organizers kept the
noise down.
