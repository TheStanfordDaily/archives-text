# Radioactive implants used to treat cancer
## 
### Rob Lempert 
The equipment that packs the cancer wards
of Stanford Medical Center often seems like it
would be more at home in a physicist's
laboratory than in a hospital. Scanners,
radioactive pellets, linear accelerators, and
mobile computers are all part of a dazzling
technological array used to combat the disease
that kills 350,000 Americans each year.
In 1955 several physicists and Dr. Henry Kap
lan, professor of radiology here, installed in
Stanford's old hospital in San Francisco a linear
accelerator designed to destroy cancer tissue
with beams of deadly radiation. Since then
Stanford doctors have been pioneering new
treatments and methods of diagnosing cancer.
One such doctor is Alvaro Martinez, assistant
professor of radiology, who is attempting to
control cancer by implanting radioactive pel
lets directly inside a tumor. He is being as
sisted by Dr. Don Goffinet.
"There are two issues to be considered in
the treatment of cancer," said Martinez. "That
is curing the patient and minimizing the side
effects of the cure."
Martinez said radioactive implants can be an
alternative to dangerous or mutilating surgery.
Martinez stressed the technique cannot be
applied in all cases or for all types of cancer.
Some cancers are so bad that the doctor's only
concern is the patient's survival. But he added
that for those cancers that have a fairly high
cure rate, the quality of survival also becomes

important.
Breast cancer is one disease for which Mar
tinez feels implants can be effective. Instead of
surgically removing the breast, Martinez uses
X-rays to find the exact position and size of the
tumor and then feeds this information into a
computer which finds optimum spacingfor his
radioactive implants.
In the operating room, Martinez inserts hol
low plastic tubes through the cancerous areas
and affixes them to the skin. The patient is re
turned to her room and small plastic rods con
taining regularly spaced pellets of highly
radioactive iridium are slid into the tubes.
When the dosage is complete, the rods and
tubes are removed.
Radioactive implants are usually accom
panied by conventional radiation therapy,
surgery and drugs, Martinez explained.
By placing radioactive sources inside the
tumor itself, Martinez said he can use a type of
radiation that doesn't penetrate deeply into
the surrounding tissues. Thus he can deliver
deadly doses to the cancer cells and avoid
damaging the healthy areas. To give a similar
dosage with an external beam would greatly
damage the patient's lungs, ribs and heart, he
added.
Martinez said he has done nearly 200 im
plants of all types since he came to the Univer
sity four years ago and that he is impressed by
the results. Besides treating breast cancer, he
has al r o used the technique on cancers of the

head and neck area where surgery is both
dangerous and causes disfigurement.
In Europe, where there is a higher percen
tage of women who refuse to undergo mastec
tomies, implants are fairly common. Several
major medical centers in the United States are
also developing radioactive implants.
Though many doctors still doubt the effec
tiveness of radioactive implants, Martinez said
this method deserves a place alongside
surgery as a cure for breast cancer.
"Mastectomy is the standard treatment in
this country, not necessarily the best," he said.
Martinez has been traveling around the
country for the last three years promoting the
idea of implants. He feels women should know
that there are alternatives to mastectomy so
they can discuss with their doctor a treatment
which will not only cure the disease but will
leave the fewest psychological scars.
Cancer care involves much more than the
actual treatment, however. The disease itself is
really 200 different diseases ranging from lung
cancer to leukemia. Each type of malignancy
grows differently, spreads differently and thus
requires different care.
Cancer treatment involves specialists from
several fields working together as a team. The
surgeon cuts away tumors, while the
radiologist destroys them with radiation and
the chemotherapist attacks them with drugs.
The research scientist pioneers new methods
of treatment and psychologists and therapists

either rehabilitate the patient or prepare him
and his family for death.
One of the most vital stages in the treatment
of cancer is the diagnosis. Doctors must not
only confirm that a tumor is indeed malignant,
but must also know the type of cancer and how
far it has spread in order to effectively treat it.
The pathology department at the Hospital is
also studying the identification and diagnosis
of cancer. Dr. Ronald Dorfman, co-director of
surgical pathology at Stanford said, "the most
reliable method of confirming a diagnosis is
the biopsy," which involves studying tissues
surgically removed from the tumor area.
Typically, a tissue sample is prepared in the
surgical pathology lab where they are imbed
ded in wax and sliced in layers just a few cells
thick. The wax is then removed and the sam
ples are stained and put on slides for viewing
under a light microscope.
If more detailed study, is required, the
pathology department also has several elec
tron microscopes. The sample preparation is
basically the same, except that a special
diamond-blade tool cuts the tissue thinner
than a cell.
Besides biopsy, the pathology department
also utilizes exfoliative cytology, in which the
fluids surrounding a tumor are examined for
signs of cancer. This is an important method
for diagnosing cancer of the cervix or lungs.
Dorfman said many interns and residents are
being trained in pathology so they can learn to
recognize cancer cells under the microscope.

One such doctor is Alvaro Martinez, assistant
professor of radiology, who is attempting to
control cancer by implanting radioactive pel
lets directly inside a tumor. He is being as
sisted by Dr. Don Goffinet.
"There are two issues to be considered in
the treatment of cancer," said Martinez. "That
is curing the patient and minimizing the side
effects of the cure."
Martinez said radioactive implants can be an
alternative to dangerous or mutilating surgery.
Martinez stressed the technique cannot be
applied in all cases or for all types of cancer.
Some cancers are so bad that the doctor's only
concern is the patient's survival. But he added
that for those cancers that have a fairly high
cure rate, the quality of survival also becomes

important.
Breast cancer is one disease for which Mar
tinez feels implants can be effective. Instead of
surgically removing the breast, Martinez uses
X-rays to find the exact position and size of the
tumor and then feeds this information into a
computer which finds optimum spacingfor his
radioactive implants.
In the operating room, Martinez inserts hol
low plastic tubes through the cancerous areas
and affixes them to the skin. The patient is re
turned to her room and small plastic rods con
taining regularly spaced pellets of highly
radioactive iridium are slid into the tubes.
When the dosage is complete, the rods and
tubes are removed.
Radioactive implants are usually accom
panied by conventional radiation therapy,
surgery and drugs, Martinez explained.
By placing radioactive sources inside the
tumor itself, Martinez said he can use a type of
radiation that doesn't penetrate deeply into
the surrounding tissues. Thus he can deliver
deadly doses to the cancer cells and avoid
damaging the healthy areas. To give a similar
dosage with an external beam would greatly
damage the patient's lungs, ribs and heart, he
added.
Martinez said he has done nearly 200 im
plants of all types since he came to the Univer
sity four years ago and that he is impressed by
the results. Besides treating breast cancer, he
has al r o used the technique on cancers of the

head and neck area where surgery is both
dangerous and causes disfigurement.
In Europe, where there is a higher percen
tage of women who refuse to undergo mastec
tomies, implants are fairly common. Several
major medical centers in the United States are
also developing radioactive implants.
Though many doctors still doubt the effec
tiveness of radioactive implants, Martinez said
this method deserves a place alongside
surgery as a cure for breast cancer.
"Mastectomy is the standard treatment in
this country, not necessarily the best," he said.
Martinez has been traveling around the
country for the last three years promoting the
idea of implants. He feels women should know
that there are alternatives to mastectomy so
they can discuss with their doctor a treatment
which will not only cure the disease but will
leave the fewest psychological scars.
Cancer care involves much more than the
actual treatment, however. The disease itself is
really 200 different diseases ranging from lung
cancer to leukemia. Each type of malignancy
grows differently, spreads differently and thus
requires different care.
Cancer treatment involves specialists from
several fields working together as a team. The
surgeon cuts away tumors, while the
radiologist destroys them with radiation and
the chemotherapist attacks them with drugs.
The research scientist pioneers new methods
of treatment and psychologists and therapists

either rehabilitate the patient or prepare him
and his family for death.
One of the most vital stages in the treatment
of cancer is the diagnosis. Doctors must not
only confirm that a tumor is indeed malignant,
but must also know the type of cancer and how
far it has spread in order to effectively treat it.
The pathology department at the Hospital is
also studying the identification and diagnosis
of cancer. Dr. Ronald Dorfman, co-director of
surgical pathology at Stanford said, "the most
reliable method of confirming a diagnosis is
the biopsy," which involves studying tissues
surgically removed from the tumor area.
Typically, a tissue sample is prepared in the
surgical pathology lab where they are imbed
ded in wax and sliced in layers just a few cells
thick. The wax is then removed and the sam
ples are stained and put on slides for viewing
under a light microscope.
If more detailed study, is required, the
pathology department also has several elec
tron microscopes. The sample preparation is
basically the same, except that a special
diamond-blade tool cuts the tissue thinner
than a cell.
Besides biopsy, the pathology department
also utilizes exfoliative cytology, in which the
fluids surrounding a tumor are examined for
signs of cancer. This is an important method
for diagnosing cancer of the cervix or lungs.
Dorfman said many interns and residents are
being trained in pathology so they can learn to
recognize cancer cells under the microscope.
The equipment that packs the cancer wards
of Stanford Medical Center often seems like it
would be more at home in a physicist's
laboratory than in a hospital. Scanners,
radioactive pellets, linear accelerators, and
mobile computers are all part of a dazzling
technological array used to combat the disease
that kills 350,000 Americans each year.
In 1955 several physicists and Dr. Henry Kap
lan, professor of radiology here, installed in
Stanford's old hospital in San Francisco a linear
accelerator designed to destroy cancer tissue
with beams of deadly radiation. Since then
Stanford doctors have been pioneering new
treatments and methods of diagnosing cancer.
