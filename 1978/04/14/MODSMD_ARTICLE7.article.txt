# COP slates present their platforms
## All experienced 
### 
Goldenkranz et al

An effective Council of Presidents
must have experience with University
committees and administrative pro
cedure, a working knowledge of the
issues, and the willingness to work
hard for students' interests. We be
lieve we meet these criteria; we urge
you to verify this for yourself.
All the members of our slate have
experience in student government
through serving on committees and
organizing student activities. In addi
tion, we have all had experience in
organizing successfully in areas
once or still overlooked by the
existing decision-making
mechanisms, such as minority is
sues, ecology, and national policy.
We have learned that desired
changes occur when assumptions
are intelligently questioned and
these questions are followed by care
ful research and persistent attention.
Our experience has led us to the un
derstanding that complex problems
may not be amenable to quick and
simple solutions. We seek an ap
propriate mix of pragmatism and
idealism in order to achieve realistic
ends with a higher vision constantly
in mind.
We have many and diverse in
terests, as reflected in our creden
tials and in our platform statement,
which we hope you will read. It dis
cusses advising, teaching and te
nure, the graduate student associa
tion, investment responsibility, de
partmental associations, women's is
sues, Western Culture, gay rights,
judicial reform, child care, Tresidder
Union, University governance and
long-range planning, third world is
sues, accommodation of the hand

icapped, ASSU projects, senate re
form graduate financial aid, intern
ships and admissions policy.
We believe that there is a misun
derstanding on the part of many stu
dents as to the nature, power and
structural limitations of the COP. The
COP cannot right wrongs and ad
vance justice simply by issuing edicts
and proclamations; this, however,
does not mean that reasoned, intelli
gent, and articulate advocacy cannot
yield results.
We seek to open genuine com
munications between the student
body and those who seek to serve
that group. We want to represent
fairly the full range of viewpoints; we
cannot be all things to all people, but
we can listen to everyone's ideas,
and insure everyone a fair hearing in
the community.
We have the experience and ex
pertise to advance student concerns.
We will maintain office hours 40
hours per week to encourage stu
dents and all interested members of
the community to come in and talk to
us. lnaddition,wewill initiate efforts
to increase the accessibility of the
COP through house meetings,
media exposure, disclosure on a
regular basis, and newsletters,
among other things to solicit ideas
and advise.
We will need your support now, to
help us win, and later, to help us
work.
