# Moderate position
## 
### 
As a slate, we do not intend to
imply that we represent all student
opinions. Our goal is to guide the
student body through issues, pre
senting fair and well-contemplated
judgments without absolute claims.
We hope to quell the recent ex
tremism and oscillations of political
perspectives that have characterized
Stanford student government.
We take a stable, moderate posi
tion, receptive and openminded to
all persuasions. We present ourse
lves as a group of students who
would be characterized as energetic,
hard-working, responsible and
pragmatic.
We will be sensitive to the whole
spectrum of student academic and
extracurricular concerns. With our
balance of perspectives and ap
proachability, we are confident that
we can be receptive to all student
needs.
Many of our major efforts will be
devoted to trying to improve the rep
resentativeness of the ASSU; this
may entail some of the following
structural/representation changes:
—Senate restructuring and elec
toral reform. One method we feel
may increase student representation
would involve districting the Senate:
undergraduates would be divided by
geographical location (by dorm, off
campus, etc.), the graduates by
school or department (law, engineer
ing, etc.). In addition, a portion of
both graduate and undergraduate
seats would be elected at-large to en
sure special interests representation.
-Expand student communica
tion and feedback utilizing the Resi
dent Advisor network. We intend to
establish a network of "contact" per
sonnel by living groups and
academic discipline and interest area
so that we may become cognizant of
student issues, sensitive to student
problems, and receptive to student
concerns.
The COP can effect needed
changes in the academic programs
and policies at Stanford. Utilizing the

Drysdale et al.

recently completed advising system
evaluation, we will make the system a
more helpful and significant part of a
Stanford education. Specifically, in
formation and instructions should be
provided for advisors and a more
rigorous screening process should
be employed.
Institutional quality should be im
proved through the use of ongoing
teaching evaluations to focus on the
strengths and weaknesses of profes
sors, courses and departments.
Course requirements constitute
another sensitive issue; a stable
framework for requirements should
be adopted so that requirements are
not changed every few months. We
thinkastudentelectionorpoll is an
effective way to get needed student
input on the western culture re
quirement controversy.
Tenure decisions also demand
student input; teaching ability
should be an important criterion in
tenure decisions. Also, a clear and
well promulgated set of tenure
criteria should be established.
We are committed to provide effi
cient, involved and knowledgeable
management of exisiting student
services. Furthermore, we hope to
provide services in some new areas,
including the following:
—increasing hours for athletic and
recreational facilities
—increasingfunding for club
sports
—assuring adequate funding for
overseas programs.
—Setting up new graduate student
social activites.
As you can see, we don't make any
dramatic campaign promises. We
pledge only to be receptive and
open-minded and to bring an end to
the unproductive extremism of the
past.
