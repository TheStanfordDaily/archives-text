# Answering criteria
## 
### 
We suggest three criteria for decid
ing who to vote for:
One, whether a slate's priorities
and goals are compatible with yours.
Two, how effective the siate will be
in pursuing its stated goals.
Three, will these four people be
responsive to your needs?
We, Miguel Martinez, Kim
Wright, Rob Docters and Suzi
Schoenung, intend to pursue the fol
lowing goals:
Academics: We support two recom
mendations of the 1976 ASSU Task
Force on Tenure and Teaching Qual
ity. Specifically:
—Retrospective surveys of courses
conducted among seniors and re
cent alumni. This is to gain a longer
term perspective on which classes
are valuable.
—Greater information-gathering
on staff before they are hired by Stan
ford. At present not enough atten
tion is placed on teaching rather than
research skills: we favor a balance
between the two.
Another primary concern we wish
to address is the expansion of the
Teaching Improvement Center. This
center would help faculty, staff, and
teaching assistants by offering
advice/ideas, and attempt to coordi
nate teaching programs between
departments.
Social and Political: Women's issues
include pressing for Stanford to hire
more qualified women. Further,
non-coin, anti-rape phones and
other anti-rape measures, and edu
cation, are needed.
Minority concerns must be based
on the premise people involved with
the problems be involved with the
solutions. We will fight for the estab
lishment of a Bakke Effects Commit
tee to minimize backlash from an un
favorable decision. Further, we will
press for more activity space for
groups needing it.
Stanford must be ecologically sen
sitive. At present Stanford does not
make capital improvements in solar
heating projects and other ecologi
cally sound projects because it has a

Schoenung et al.

policy ot five-year-payback. We will
work to change this.
Student Services include emphaasis
on the following:
—Housing facilities must be
expanded/improved. The ASSU
should create a task force to quell
administration fears that new housing
will go empty.
—Off Campus Student Center
must receive more funding. Its pre
sent budget is inadequate for provid
ing an appropriate amount of ser
vices for people living off-campus.
—The groundwork must be laid for
the Athletic Department to give
higher priority to non-varsity sports.
Everyone at Stanford ought to have
access to all facilities.
—Graduate students must be
better supported. We will do this
largely through the Graduate Stu
dent Council. Goals include more
social events, spouses' rights, and
making (especially departmental)
libraries more useful for research.
An integral part of this team's plat
form is ASSU effectiveness. We out
line 10 means todo so. Theseinclude
lobbying Faculty Senate members
and alumni, something not exten
sively done. Further, the lack of
communication between administra
tion and ASSU must cease; we out
line a liaison proposal. Better delega
tion of work, and more use of
faculty/administration student Task
Forces would improve the quality
and quantity of the COP's output.
Finally, and most importantly, can
we respond to your needs? We ans
wer with two points:
First, we will be in every dorm dis
tributing platform statements. We
urge you to read it and ask us ques
tions.
Second, here are the members of a
very diverse, experienced COP
team:
Suzi Schoenung, doctoral student,
mechanical engineering
Rob Docters, junior, economics
Kim Wright, junior, human biology
Miguel Martinez, senior, communica
tion
