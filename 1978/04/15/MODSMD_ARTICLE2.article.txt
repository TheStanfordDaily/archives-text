# Bruin ruin stewin'?
## Cardinals eye double dual upset 
### Bruce Anderson 
Normally, it's like Safeway
moving next door to the corner
market when UCLA brings its
track team north to compete
against Stanford: it's tough for
the little guys to compete with
the giants. Normally.
"For the first time in several
years we have an odds-on
chance to upset UCLA," Stan
ford track coach Payton Jordan
said earlier this week.
This year the Bruins will have
to do more than show up to
defeat the Cardinals.
When Stanford lines up
against UCLA and California
enters the blocks with USC to
day, it will be more than just
another opportunity for the
two southern California pow
erhouses to awe northern
California track fans by flexing
their team muscle.
Not that the meet doesn't
offer an array of stars. The four
teams have eight men ranked
among the top dozen in the
world in their event in 1977:

â€” USC's Clancy Edwards,
the collegiate record holder in
the 200 meters, was ranked No.
3 in the 200 and No. 5 in the 100
last season and tops the world

list this season with a 20.0
hand-timed 200.
Hurdler James Owens of
UCLA won the NCAA and AAU
high hurdles in 1977 and was
ranked No. 4. Teammate Greg
Foster was ranked sixth in the
highs and leads the world this
year with a 13.54 clocking.
USC long jumper Larry
Doubley, ranked No. 11, won
the NCAA title with a 26-11%
leap.
Intermediate hurdler
Quentin Wheeler of Cal, who
finished one spot out of the
medals at Montreal, was
ranked ninth.
UCLA's Willie Banks was
ranked fifth in the world in the
triple jump as well as eighth in
the United States in the long
jump.
Stanford's James Lofton
long jumped more than 26 feet
ineight meets lastyearto finish
seventh in the world, No. 2 in
the U.S.
No. 2 in the world, UCLA
pole vaulter Mike Tully won
the World Cup meet with an
18-4 1 /2 vault. Of all the athletes
in the stadium to watch today,
Tully may be the key one.
The Westwood senior grab

bed the world indoor record
this winter when he cleared
18-4 in the Muhammad Ali Invi
tational and later flew over
18-5% to elevate his record.
Last week he almost added
the outdoor record to his col
lection when he narrowly mis
sed on the three attempts at
18-8%. Dave Roberts set the
current world standard when
he cleared 18-8 1 /4 at the 1976
U.S. Olympic Trials in Eugene.
"We have a guaranteed as
sault on the world record in the
pole vault," Jordan said. "We
have a great vaulting pit at Stan
ford, and a number of records
have been set in it. Tully is on a
hot streak right now and could
go for another record Satur
day."
But while Tully and Banks
should lead the Bruins to a field
day in the field events, UCLA
will have to be wary of Stanford
on the track where the Cards
assemble their best troop of
runners in a long time.

season against UCLA last year, has a best of 9:03.5 this spring.
