# Unloathable Willie Banks
## Some nice guys finish first 
### John Nielsen 
It is said that in track and
field it can be useful to hate
your opponent. If you loathe,
despise, abhor or otherwise de
test him that you leap or run or
otherwise compete against,
the theory is that this can move
you to a higher level of perfor
mance. It follows then that the
worst possible type of person
to face in a track meet would
be, in addition to physically
skilled, impossible to dislike.
UCLA's track team may have
the world's fpremost first
finishing nice guy in the person
of Willie Banks. Banks is the
fifth-ranking triple jumper in
the world, with a best of 55-4Vi.
(He has also jumped a wind
aided 55-7.) He is ranked sec
ond in the United States be
hind San Jose State's Ron Liv :
ers.
He also has one hell of a per
sonality.
"Yeah, I'm pretty nice," he
said. "I've definitely got to be
one of the nicest around. From
time to time I think about try
ing it for awhile as a jerk, but it
would never work. I'm too
nice."
Willie is captain of UCLA's
team; at meets he can be seen
cheering everyone on, firing
them on to new heights. When
he isn't winning the triple
jump, Willie is bounding over
to encourage the distance run
ners, or the high jumpers, or
anyone in the vicinity; at the
beginning of meets they get

together and Willie leads
everyone in chants.
"I can't help doing that
stuff," he said. "I just get so
excited about these things that
I can't resist trying to com
municate some of it. I know I
jump better when I'm en*
thusiastic to the point where I
can't stay on the ground any
more, and I can't see why it
shouldn't work for everybody
else.
"I try to give 'em an extra
boost of energy. You know
what I mean."
Willie loves competition. "I
like it if someone is ahead of
me with one jump to go and
the score tied. I never miss th
ose. When people do better
than me early on in the com
petition I just love to get ex
cited and take it. I love that."
He definitely has had his
moments. As a freshman he
beat USC's defending Olympic
gold medalist Randy Williams
in the long jump because he
couldn't control himself, and
then returned in the second
to-last event to triple jump a
lifetime best, setting a meet and
stadium record to clinch the
victory for UCLA.
"That was fun." Last year
against Stanford, James Lofton
made the mistake of jumping
too far too soon, and Willie
went past him with a 25-8 leap
on his final try.
Willie said he intends to do
the same this weekend. "I
don't know how to put this,"

he said, "being as I am a terrifi
cally nice guy, but things don't
look too good for Stanford.
"No, that's not right. You de
finitely have a chance, if our
whole team dies of the plague,
or if the bus gets stuck in the
airport. Or if God comes down
from the sky and has a talk with
Lofton. Is there anything else
you want me to say?
"Oh yeah, tell the announcer
that I'm not related to your
(Gordon) Banks. I don't even
know the guy.
"Also, I love my mother. Be
sure you put that in. You owe
me."
Willie Banks can be wildly
partisan and never get on your
nerves; he can trample you
into the dust and have you
wanting to get up and thank
him. So don't look around for
the tall guy in the wrong color
warmups that's jumping up
and down near some crucial
event. Don't look for the guy
that everybody's smiling near.
If you see him you'll be temp
ted to root incorrectly.
Willie Banks is absolutely un
loathable. Perhaps we should
kidnap him on his way over
from the airport. Or make sure
that he gets mixed up and
thinks the meet is in the Stern
Hall cafeteria. We'll never be
able to hold anything against
him if he shows up here this
weekend, and that would be a
terrible shame. After all, he is
from UCLA.

worst possible type of person
to face in a track meet would
be, in addition to physically
skilled, impossible to dislike.
UCLA's track team may have
the world's fpremost first
finishing nice guy in the person
of Willie Banks. Banks is the
fifth-ranking triple jumper in
the world, with a best of 55-4Vi.
(He has also jumped a wind
aided 55-7.) He is ranked sec
ond in the United States be
hind San Jose State's Ron Liv :
ers.
He also has one hell of a per
sonality.
"Yeah, I'm pretty nice," he
said. "I've definitely got to be
one of the nicest around. From
time to time I think about try
ing it for awhile as a jerk, but it
would never work. I'm too
nice."
Willie is captain of UCLA's
team; at meets he can be seen
cheering everyone on, firing
them on to new heights. When
he isn't winning the triple
jump, Willie is bounding over
to encourage the distance run
ners, or the high jumpers, or
anyone in the vicinity; at the
beginning of meets they get

together and Willie leads
everyone in chants.
"I can't help doing that
stuff," he said. "I just get so
excited about these things that
I can't resist trying to com
municate some of it. I know I
jump better when I'm en*
thusiastic to the point where I
can't stay on the ground any
more, and I can't see why it
shouldn't work for everybody
else.
"I try to give 'em an extra
boost of energy. You know
what I mean."
Willie loves competition. "I
like it if someone is ahead of
me with one jump to go and
the score tied. I never miss th
ose. When people do better
than me early on in the com
petition I just love to get ex
cited and take it. I love that."
He definitely has had his
moments. As a freshman he
beat USC's defending Olympic
gold medalist Randy Williams
in the long jump because he
couldn't control himself, and
then returned in the second
to-last event to triple jump a
lifetime best, setting a meet and
stadium record to clinch the
victory for UCLA.
"That was fun." Last year
against Stanford, James Lofton
made the mistake of jumping
too far too soon, and Willie
went past him with a 25-8 leap
on his final try.
Willie said he intends to do
the same this weekend. "I
don't know how to put this,"

he said, "being as I am a terrifi
cally nice guy, but things don't
look too good for Stanford.
"No, that's not right. You de
finitely have a chance, if our
whole team dies of the plague,
or if the bus gets stuck in the
airport. Or if God comes down
from the sky and has a talk with
Lofton. Is there anything else
you want me to say?
"Oh yeah, tell the announcer
that I'm not related to your
(Gordon) Banks. I don't even
know the guy.
"Also, I love my mother. Be
sure you put that in. You owe
me."
Willie Banks can be wildly
partisan and never get on your
nerves; he can trample you
into the dust and have you
wanting to get up and thank
him. So don't look around for
the tall guy in the wrong color
warmups that's jumping up
and down near some crucial
event. Don't look for the guy
that everybody's smiling near.
If you see him you'll be temp
ted to root incorrectly.
Willie Banks is absolutely un
loathable. Perhaps we should
kidnap him on his way over
from the airport. Or make sure
that he gets mixed up and
thinks the meet is in the Stern
Hall cafeteria. We'll never be
able to hold anything against
him if he shows up here this
weekend, and that would be a
terrible shame. After all, he is
from UCLA.
It is said that in track and
field it can be useful to hate
your opponent. If you loathe,
despise, abhor or otherwise de
test him that you leap or run or
otherwise compete against,
the theory is that this can move
you to a higher level of perfor
mance. It follows then that the
worst possible type of person
to face in a track meet would
be, in addition to physically
skilled, impossible to dislike.
