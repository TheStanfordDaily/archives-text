# Sheats probes track psychology
## Stanford senior discusses the mind games of running 
### Paul Spaeth 
Most people consider track
and field the premier example
of the purely physical and to
tally mindless sport. Because
of its emphasis on body per
formance rather than strategy
or plays, people see the mental
requirements as minimal at
best.

Alan Sheats, however, de :
stroys this assumption. In
the six-foot senior sprinter
from Altadena, Calif., could
very easily be the one to write
"The Thinking Man's Guide to
Track and Field."

But unlike the thinking in
other sports, Sheats said he
sees the thinking of track to be
primarily "psychological."
"Psychology has a lot to do
with how a runner will per
form," Sheats said. "Sure, the
physical aspect is most impor
tant, but there is a mental
framework required to com
pete at one's best that is not
very easy to attain."
Sheats became particularly
aware of this mental side to
track when he graduated from
Muir High School in Pasadena,
the California state champions
his senior year, and came to
Stanford, the Pac-B's worst
team that same year.
"In high school, you're in a
microcosm," he said. "The
good players know they will
win simply because the greats
are spread out all over the
country. But once you get to
college, you're in a macro
cosm. Everyone's been chosen
for their quality and you are up
against the best. Many who
were stars in high school are
only mediocre in college. For

them it is necessary to undergo
a psychological change that
emphasizes personal rather
than super performances."
For Sheats this adjustment
came about gradually. "My
first two years here, I
rationalized my losses by say
ing that I was younger than
most of the other competitors.
But I finally realized that one
need only satisfy himself, that
he must be personally content.
Fte should say to himself, 'I
know this is good and I don't
care about the rest.'

"Somedays you'll do well,
and somedays you won't. But
you'll slowly improve."
In the process of improving,
Sheats recognized the formu
lation of outside pressures that
constantly influenced his per
formance.

"People are always con
cerned with the outside
world," he said. "This world
puts a lot of pressure on you,
and you must try to keep this
pressure to a minimum. Even
though you felt you ran a good
race, external sources may
make you feel that you ran a
bad one. Sometimes this can
affect your next race."
At other times, outside
forces work favorably for a
runner. "Even if a sprinter is
winning all his races," Sheats
explained, "he may not be
competing at his best, because
nothing is forcing him to. But if
someone exerts pressure on
him to improve, he probably
will.

"An incident similar to this
occurred in the Stanford Re
lays. Having lost the 800-meter
relay because of some bad pas

ses, some of the guys on the
relay team were pretty down
and didn't feel like running in
the 1600-meter relay. But when
they announced the team
scores and we were in fifth
place, we got ourselves to
gether and ran a spectacular
race."
Sheats sees a need for the
team to mentally prepare itself
more often as the season winds
down. "The relays will defi
nitely have to pull together by
the end of the season," he
said. "We, must disregard per
sonal events as hampering our

performance and get out and
run some good races."
Today Stanford hosts UCLA
in a double dual meet that also
includes USC and Cal. Though
UCLA has a definite advantage
physically, Sheats said he be
lieves that the mental edge of
the contest must go to Stan
ford.

"We are conditioned under
dogs," he said. "We have no
thing to lose. The fear is going
to be with them. Although we
are all expected to achieve cer
tain marks, they are expected
to win the meet. We'll just have

to stay low key.
"We also have some seniors
on the team who want to do
well. This is one of their last
times in the playpen and they
want to throw some sand
around.
"There are some freshmen
on the team who will also give
us a boost. They want to prove
themselves, especially in front
of a home crowd.
"It will all depend on howwe
channel our psyches. We'll
either choke or blaze. I hope
the pendulum swings our
way."

Sheats recognized the formu
lation of outside pressures that
constantly influenced his per
formance.

"People are always con
cerned with the outside
world," he said. "This world
puts a lot of pressure on you,
and you must try to keep this
pressure to a minimum. Even
though you felt you ran a good
race, external sources may
make you feel that you ran a
bad one. Sometimes this can
affect your next race."
At other times, outside
forces work favorably for a
runner. "Even if a sprinter is
winning all his races," Sheats
explained, "he may not be
competing at his best, because
nothing is forcing him to. But if
someone exerts pressure on
him to improve, he probably
will.

"An incident similar to this
occurred in the Stanford Re
lays. Having lost the 800-meter
relay because of some bad pas

ses, some of the guys on the
relay team were pretty down
and didn't feel like running in
the 1600-meter relay. But when
they announced the team
scores and we were in fifth
place, we got ourselves to
gether and ran a spectacular
race."
Sheats sees a need for the
team to mentally prepare itself
more often as the season winds
down. "The relays will defi
nitely have to pull together by
the end of the season," he
said. "We, must disregard per
sonal events as hampering our

performance and get out and
run some good races."
Today Stanford hosts UCLA
in a double dual meet that also
includes USC and Cal. Though
UCLA has a definite advantage
physically, Sheats said he be
lieves that the mental edge of
the contest must go to Stan
ford.

"We are conditioned under
dogs," he said. "We have no
thing to lose. The fear is going
to be with them. Although we
are all expected to achieve cer
tain marks, they are expected
to win the meet. We'll just have

to stay low key.
"We also have some seniors
on the team who want to do
well. This is one of their last
times in the playpen and they
want to throw some sand
around.
"There are some freshmen
on the team who will also give
us a boost. They want to prove
themselves, especially in front
of a home crowd.
"It will all depend on howwe
channel our psyches. We'll
either choke or blaze. I hope
the pendulum swings our
way."

Senior Alan Sheats takes the baton from Paul McCarthy in last year's Stanford Invitational. The school
record holder for 400 meters, Sheats runs a key leg in the 400- and 1600-meter relays.
Most people consider track
and field the premier example
of the purely physical and to
tally mindless sport. Because
of its emphasis on body per
formance rather than strategy
or plays, people see the mental
requirements as minimal at
best.

Alan Sheats, however, de :
stroys this assumption. In
the six-foot senior sprinter
from Altadena, Calif., could
very easily be the one to write
"The Thinking Man's Guide to
Track and Field."

But unlike the thinking in
other sports, Sheats said he
sees the thinking of track to be
primarily "psychological."
"Psychology has a lot to do
with how a runner will per
form," Sheats said. "Sure, the
physical aspect is most impor
tant, but there is a mental
framework required to com
pete at one's best that is not
very easy to attain."
Sheats became particularly
aware of this mental side to
track when he graduated from
Muir High School in Pasadena,
the California state champions
his senior year, and came to
Stanford, the Pac-B's worst
team that same year.
"In high school, you're in a
microcosm," he said. "The
good players know they will
win simply because the greats
are spread out all over the
country. But once you get to
college, you're in a macro
cosm. Everyone's been chosen
for their quality and you are up
against the best. Many who
were stars in high school are
only mediocre in college. For

them it is necessary to undergo
a psychological change that
emphasizes personal rather
than super performances."
For Sheats this adjustment
came about gradually. "My
first two years here, I
rationalized my losses by say
ing that I was younger than
most of the other competitors.
But I finally realized that one
need only satisfy himself, that
he must be personally content.
Fte should say to himself, 'I
know this is good and I don't
care about the rest.'

"Somedays you'll do well,
and somedays you won't. But
you'll slowly improve."
In the process of improving,
Sheats recognized the formu
lation of outside pressures that
constantly influenced his per
formance.

"People are always con
cerned with the outside
world," he said. "This world
puts a lot of pressure on you,
and you must try to keep this
