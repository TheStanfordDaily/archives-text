# Larry the Lip guarantees revolutionary jump today
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
"I guarantee I'll jump 27 feet
this weekend.
"I predict that my new
technique will revolutionize
the long-jumping world.
"I always peak at the end of
the year. I think I can jump 28
feet at the NCAAs.
"This kid Lofton has never
beaten me. Every time he has
outjumped me, I've beaten
myself."
Who is this mouth? Has
Muhammad Ali hung up his
boxing gloves and put on track
shoes? No, it's not Ali; but it's
close. It's Larry Doubley, the
loudest, brashest, cockiest de
fending NCAA long jump
champion in history.
The USC sophomore
answers to the nickname of
"Baby Ali." Like Ali, Doubley is
more than just mouth. He is
another in a long list of USC
world-class jumpers, including
Henry Hines and 1972 Olympic
champion Randy Williams.
Highlighting Doubley's ac
complishments are consistent
jumps over 25 feet and a career
best 26-11% that won last year's
NCAA championship.
"His jump was no fluke,"
said Stanford jumper James
Lofton, who finished third in
the meet, four inches behind
the Trojan gazelle. "If Doubley
works hard and keeps compet
ing, he may jump 27 feet befo re
the season's out."

Doubley said 27 feet will be
come a reality today when he
introduces a technique he de
scribed as "world
revolutionary." Doubley said,
"Though I can jump high on
the basketball court and I can
jump high over cars (one of
Doubley's favorite hobbies is
jumping over the roofs of cars
though USC coach Vern
Wolfe outlaws it during the
season), I could never get
heighth on the runway until
recently.
"I felt it was necessary to try
something different. I got to
gether with Randy Williams
and Henry Hines we discus
sed it and worked on it and

I'm going to debut with it this
weekend."
Doubley refused to release
any details of the technique,
but did say that "within a
couple of years, high schoolers
will be learning itand using it."
He is so sure of its success
that he guarantees a 27-foot
jump today. However, Doub
ley hyperextended his knee
last week in a dual meet at the
University of California-Santa
Barbara and said that this is the
only thing that may keep him
from fulfilling his promise.
Doubley has earned a repu
tation for supplementing his
performances with bold prom
ises and cocksure statements.

"I don't object to his be
havior," Wolfe said. "It's his
personality and as long as he
behaves, it doesn't bother
me."

Lofton, who has been sub
ject to Doubley's brashness as
much as any other competitor,
said that "his cockiness
doesn't affect me. When he
won the NCAAs last year, he
was heralded as the next great
jumper, and that's how he
reacted to it."

Analyzing Doubley's form,
Lofton said that Doubley lacks
the strength necessary to con
sistently approach and fly past
27 feet. Wolfe agreed.
"Larry needs his weight
training more than he
realizes," Wolfe said. "He's
got the speed, the fluidness
and the understanding of the
event. But he never lifted
weights in high school, so he
hasn't been able to progress as
well in that aspect of his jump
ing."
Doubley acknowledged that
he is not a strength jumper in
the vein of a Lofton. However,
he claimed that that vyon't
make any difference this
weekend.
"Lofton is a strength jumper,
which is why he beat me at
UCLA (in the dual meet bet
ween Stanford and USC). UC
LA's runway is slow. I need one
where speed is more impor
tant."

Since the recently-installed
Tartan surface in Stanford
Stadium rewards speed, Doub
ley said he feels this will give
him an advantage.
Doubley's speed has worked
for him out of the blocks as
well as on the runway. He is a
fine sprinter. But since the Tro
jans have an army of great
sprinters, Doubley generally
sees duty only in the long jump
pit.
For all Doubley's physical ta
lents, his jumping is hampered
by poor vision.
"My nearsightedness gives
me trouble. You can't hit the
board if you can't see it.
Doubley is forever grateful
that he is in school at all. He
grew up in the lower-class area
surrounding the USC campus
and admitted, "I never thought
I'd make it here. When we
grew up in the ghetto, we used
to look up a couple blocks and
see USC, and it would really be
far away. We used to think of
USC as Disneyland.
"I thank God that society
favors stupid things like some
one whose legs are stronger
and who can jump farther. That
is how I was able to get a scho
larship and come to USC."
Having arrived at USC,
Doubley has set his sights on
ultimately challenging the
world record. And if there is
any sports record that is consi
dered untouchable, it is Bob
Beamon's amazing long jump
of 29-2 1 /2 set at the 1968 Olym
pics in Mexico City. No one
else has ever even jumped 28
feet.
Wolfe, however, said he
feels that Larry Doubley may
just be the man to break it.
"If any one person has the
basic raw talent who could ap
proach Beamon's record, it is
Larry. It will be some years be
fore he is mature enough, and
the conditions would have to
be ideal, as in a meet like the
Olympics or in another inter
national meet. But Larry could
be the man to do it."
