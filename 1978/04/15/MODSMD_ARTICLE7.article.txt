# At last. . . Mania!

### Bruce Anderson 
Name the first player picked by the New York Mets in the
expansion draft. Who was on deck when Bobby Thompson hit
the home run that put the New York Giants in the 1951 World
Series? Which athlete played both NBA basketball and NHL
hockey?
They're questions with no apparent purpose, no redeeming
social value. They seem to add little to life.
But sports trivia questions are the obsession of a surprising
number of people. Even more surprising is the number of
people who can produce answers to questions used only to fill
the small but vacant nooks and crannies of modern minds.
Sports trivia, known to its loyalist adherents as mania, is the
rage of the cocktail circuit. Here are a few weapons for your
arsenal:
1. What Walker Cup golfer who attended Stanford during
the 1930s has a son who is now one of the premier pitchers
in major league baseball?
2. Who is the Stanford swimmer who led the Cardinals to an
NCAA team title and whose brother is a famed guitarist for
Fleetwood Mac? Name his brother.
3. What Stanford athlete set a school shot put record before
going on to become the publisher of one of the nation's
largest newspapers?
4. Who was the last man to quarterback the Stanford football
team before Jim Plupkett began his three-year reign at the
helm of the Cardinal offense?
5. Who was the former Stanford baseball player traded to the
San Francisco Giants in a deal which sent a future National
League MVP to the Cincinnati Reds?

1. Charles Seaver, a fairway stand
out who played for Stanford in
1931 and 1932, whose son Tom
now pitches for the Cincinnati
Reds.
2. Greg Buckingham, who led the
Cardinals to an upset victory in
the 1967 nationals by winning
the 200 and 500 freestyle, finish
ing second in the 1650 freestyle
and anchoring the victorious 800
freestyle relay. His brother is
Lindsey Buckingham.
3. Otis Chandler, who tossed the

shot 57-4-3/8 in 1950, a school
mark which stood for 10 years,
and later became the publisher
of the Los Angeles Times.
4. Mark Marquess, current coach
of the Stanford baseball team,
who started at quarterback in
the 1967 Big Game.
5. Shortstop Frank Duffy, who
played for the Cards from 1965
to 1967, was traded to San Fran
cisco in a deal that sent outfiel
der George Foster, the 1977
MVP, to Cincinnati.
