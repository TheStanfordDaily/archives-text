# Stanford installs Tartan track
## Cards enjoy life in the fast lanes; new surface allows training ease 
### Emilie Deutsch 
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan called it one of the best
facilities in the nation. Hurdler
Tom Shellworth called it "an
asset to the school as well as
the program." And All-
American James Lofton called
it "a tribute to me and my great
and illustrious career."
In any event, whatever it's
called, encircling the Cardinal
football field is a brand new
Tartan-surfaced track that
should make our team run fas
ter and jump higher than any
thing since P.F. Flyers.
Apparently it already has.
Whether it's in celebration
of the latest improvement or
not, the Cardinals have shat
tered their previous mile-relay
record and currently hold the
third-fastest times in the nation
this year for the 400- and
1600-meter relays.
Not bad for a team whose
opposition didn't even want to
run on its track a year ago.
Now, Jordan said, "We're in
perfect position to host the
conference championships
which we will when it comes
our turn."
A year ago, a letter appeared
simultaneously on the desks of
Joe Ruetz, Stanford athletic di
rector, and Dave Wik, sports
editor for the Palo Alto Times.
It mentioned the construction

of another $200,000 fountain
on campus, and the fact that
the existing track was unsafe to
run on though there were no
plans to improve it.
"The old track was originally
intended to be a five-year facil
ity," Jordan said. "It was six
years beyond that original in
tent."
"Running on the old one was
like running on pavement,"
Lofton said.
"The main injuries were shin
splints and soreness,"
Shellworth said. "It was too
hard, the surface was uneven,
and the lines were raised."
So Shellworth wrote a letter
last summer because "I wanted
to have my say." And Wik
wrote a column in the Times
which proved embarrassing to
the University. Within nine
months Stanford boasted a
facility that incorporates all the
latest designs in track and field
engineering.
The inside lanes are "thicker
and less resistive to legs," Jor
dan said. "The outside ones
are firmer and faster for shorter
races."
Today's meet will be the first
one in Stanford Stadium ever
to be electronically timed. The
Cards will rent a new Accutron
timing system from San Jose
City College until there are
funds for them to buy their

own.
"When the gun goes off, the
mechanism is electronically
triggered," Jordan explained.
"A camera catches the runner
at the finish line and gives his
time from the gun to the finish.
'"But there will be mainte
nance problems," added the
Cardinal mentor. "It will have
to be backed up by manual tim
ing and we'll need an expert in
electronics to keep it work
ing."
The cost of the new track
runs to about $175,000, which
was collected solely through
donations many from
alumni without any "formal
solicitation."
The price tag includes the
construction of several gates to
protect the facility and
excludes the cost of the elec
tronic timing which "we can't
even consider purchasing at
this time," Jordan said. "We've
had to put in several new gates
to keep the public out. Joggers
get down there and think it's a
jogging track, but it's not. That
inside lane is soft and if they
continue to jog on it with flat
bottomed shoes (as opposed
to cleats) itwill weara rutin itin
no time."
Unfortunately, the recrea
tional athletes and even the
serious ones that are con
nected or disconnected to the

University feel the new track is
for public indulgence and ex
press that by breaking locks
and climbing gates to use it. "If
we take care of it we won't have
to resurface it for 10 years,"
Jordan said. "But if they insist
on jogging on that Tartan sur
face, it's like rubbing an eraser
over and over it wears down
very quickly."
In the meantime, the track
"encourages greater potential
for training, and a proud
team," Jordan said. "When
you're fighting the facilities

and getting hurt in practice,
you're less than excited about
actual competition."
Lofton agreed. "Although it
doesn't really dictate perfor
mances, it's better for a train
ing surface."
And what about Shellworth,
the man that ignited the dor
mant interest in a new track,
and will make his debut per
formance on it today?
"It provides for comfortable
training," he said. "I've never
run on a finer track.
"And it looks nice for the
football fans too," he added.

years beyond that original in
tent."
"Running on the old one was
like running on pavement,"
Lofton said.
"The main injuries were shin
splints and soreness,"
Shellworth said. "It was too
hard, the surface was uneven,
and the lines were raised."
So Shellworth wrote a letter
last summer because "I wanted
to have my say." And Wik
wrote a column in the Times
which proved embarrassing to
the University. Within nine
months Stanford boasted a
facility that incorporates all the
latest designs in track and field
engineering.
The inside lanes are "thicker
and less resistive to legs," Jor
dan said. "The outside ones
are firmer and faster for shorter
races."
Today's meet will be the first
one in Stanford Stadium ever
to be electronically timed. The
Cards will rent a new Accutron
timing system from San Jose
City College until there are
funds for them to buy their

own.
"When the gun goes off, the
mechanism is electronically
triggered," Jordan explained.
"A camera catches the runner
at the finish line and gives his
time from the gun to the finish.
'"But there will be mainte
nance problems," added the
Cardinal mentor. "It will have
to be backed up by manual tim
ing and we'll need an expert in
electronics to keep it work
ing."
The cost of the new track
runs to about $175,000, which
was collected solely through
donations many from
alumni without any "formal
solicitation."
The price tag includes the
construction of several gates to
protect the facility and
excludes the cost of the elec
tronic timing which "we can't
even consider purchasing at
this time," Jordan said. "We've
had to put in several new gates
to keep the public out. Joggers
get down there and think it's a
jogging track, but it's not. That
inside lane is soft and if they
continue to jog on it with flat
bottomed shoes (as opposed
to cleats) itwill weara rutin itin
no time."
Unfortunately, the recrea
tional athletes and even the
serious ones that are con
nected or disconnected to the

University feel the new track is
for public indulgence and ex
press that by breaking locks
and climbing gates to use it. "If
we take care of it we won't have
to resurface it for 10 years,"
Jordan said. "But if they insist
on jogging on that Tartan sur
face, it's like rubbing an eraser
over and over it wears down
very quickly."
In the meantime, the track
"encourages greater potential
for training, and a proud
team," Jordan said. "When
you're fighting the facilities

and getting hurt in practice,
you're less than excited about
actual competition."
Lofton agreed. "Although it
doesn't really dictate perfor
mances, it's better for a train
ing surface."
And what about Shellworth,
the man that ignited the dor
mant interest in a new track,
and will make his debut per
formance on it today?
"It provides for comfortable
training," he said. "I've never
run on a finer track.
"And it looks nice for the
football fans too," he added.

Workmen finish installing the Tartan surface which now encircles the
Stanford football field. The new track has a good surface for both
training and competition.
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan called it one of the best
facilities in the nation. Hurdler
Tom Shellworth called it "an
asset to the school as well as
the program." And All-
American James Lofton called
it "a tribute to me and my great
and illustrious career."
In any event, whatever it's
called, encircling the Cardinal
football field is a brand new
Tartan-surfaced track that
should make our team run fas
ter and jump higher than any
thing since P.F. Flyers.
Apparently it already has.
Whether it's in celebration
of the latest improvement or
not, the Cardinals have shat
tered their previous mile-relay
record and currently hold the
third-fastest times in the nation
this year for the 400- and
1600-meter relays.
Not bad for a team whose
opposition didn't even want to
run on its track a year ago.
Now, Jordan said, "We're in
perfect position to host the
conference championships
which we will when it comes
our turn."
A year ago, a letter appeared
simultaneously on the desks of
Joe Ruetz, Stanford athletic di
rector, and Dave Wik, sports
editor for the Palo Alto Times.
It mentioned the construction

of another $200,000 fountain
on campus, and the fact that
the existing track was unsafe to
run on though there were no
plans to improve it.
"The old track was originally
intended to be a five-year facil
ity," Jordan said. "It was six
years beyond that original in
tent."
"Running on the old one was
like running on pavement,"
Lofton said.
