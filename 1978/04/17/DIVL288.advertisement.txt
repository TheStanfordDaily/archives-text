fwHAT IS THE SENIOR^
ยง PLEDGE
PROGRAM?
The Senior Pledge Program is a new idea
developed by members of the Class of '78. It
a student-led volunteer program where
seniors call on their classmates to ask each of
them to consider three-year pledges to
Stanford. The program has been designed to
encourage affordable gifts, recognizing that
many of us are going to graduate school, will
be paying off loans, or are uncertain of a job
following graduation.
Questions? See your house's Senior
Pledge Representative or stop by the booth
this week in White Plaza or call 497-3856.
