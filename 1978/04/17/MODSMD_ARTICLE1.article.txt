# Seven women chosen for Playboy article
## 
### Susan Larsen 
Playboy magazine staff returned
here last week to photograph seven
women for possible inclusion in a
September article on Pac-8 women.
Three posed fully clothed, three
posed semi-nude, and one woman
could not be reached for comment.
The models said they had not
heard of anyone willing to pose
completely nude. "I assume most
women wouldn't want to pose nude.
I doubt if anyone would go that far at
Stanford; they make a big deal about
things like that here," one model
said.
The money Playboy offered was an
incentive to one woman who agreed
to pose semi-nude. "After all," she
remarked, "an extra 100 bucks is an
extra 100 bucks." She was also moti
vated, however, by the "experience
of being seen totally as a sex object."
The difference between modeling

for a fashion magazine and modeling
for Playboy, she explained, "is that
the Playboy photographer wants to
make you look good, not the clo
thing you're wearing. He's trying to
make you look sexy, like you're
seducing the camera, almost. More
of your personality comes across in
such a picture than in a fashion
photograph, which is much more
impersonal."
The two other women who posed
semi-nude were twins and said they
felt the pictures were "not that ris
que. I've posed for friends before,"
explained one twin, "and I've never
been very inhibited or overly mod
est." She, like several other seniors
who posed for Playboy, said she
"probably" would not have done so
if she was going to be at Stanford
next year, when the photographs are
published.
Each of the women anticipates

some degree of negative reaction if
their pictures appear in Playboy.
They said they felt the photographs
were "very artistic," "aesthetically
beautiful" and "not in bad taste at
all."
But all of them prefer to remain
anonymous for the present and have
told only a few close friends and fam
ily members. None of the women
who posed semi-nude have told their
parents.
"I expect an unfavorable reaction
for sure, wherever I am next year,"
one senior said. "People are always
going to be small-minded, especially
those who judge without having the
foggiest idea what the magazine's
like. Mostly it will be men who as

sume you're a certain type of girl just
because you posed semi-nude in
Playboy."
One semi-nude model described
her roommates' reaction as "sur
prised, but not overjoyed," while
one clothed model said her friends
were "very excited for me."
In general, the women who were
photographed in clothing said their
parents were "apprehensive and
wanted me to be sure they didn't
take anything out of context." But, as
one junior's boyfriend commented,
"So long as you've got your clothes
on . . . it's OK."
Five of the women said they went
to the initial interview with photo


—Daily photo by David Ansley
Playboy photographer, David Chan, was here in February to interview prospec
tive candidates for a feature on Pac-8 women. Another photographer, Pompeo
Posar, actually photographed the seven Stanford women for the article. The
woman pictured with Chan did not participate in the interview.
grapher David Chan "purely out of
curiousity," and "never expected to
be chosen."
The other two, however, had gone
"simply as a favor" to their friend,
Daily Editor in Chief David Ansley,
who wanted to sit in on an interview
with someone who would feel com
fortable in his presence. "We ex
pected the interview to be the end of
it," explained one of the women.
"We were really surprised when they
called to say they wanted to photo
graph us."
Once they were told that Playboy
wanted to photograph them, several
models said they "almost decided
not to go through with it." At least
one other woman did decide not to
be photographed because her pa
rents opposed it, according to one of
her friends who did pose for the
magazine.
In addition to the"artistic nature"
of the pictures, women said they ag
reed to pose "just for the experi
ence. I wasn't exposing my body, so
it was basically just another modeling
job," one woman said. Four of the

women had previous modeling and
theater experience ranging from
hometown fashion shows to profes
sional dinner theatre. One senior
hopes to work as a professional
model in New York for six to 12
months after graduation, "just for
the money."
None of the women knew exactly
what criteria Playboy used to select
them. They were judged solely on
the basis of a Polaroid photograph
and a brief interview with Chan.
The interview was described as a
"chat" by those chosen. "We talked
mostly about my major and my plans
for the future, the campus, and some
of his friends here," commented one
woman. Another described the in
terview as "almost a let-down. I ex
pected more glamour, but every
thing was very lowkey."
The models all agreed, however,
that they thought "the main thing
Playboy was looking for was a variety
of different looking people." Several
models also said they felt "people
were picked for the interesting
things they do, especially those who
would be posing clothed. They
wanted to incorporate something

about yourself and your activities
into the picture, the woman said.
Among the women photographed
were one sophomore, one junior,
four seniors and one first-year law
student. One woman was from the
South, and two each were from the
East Coast, the Southwest and
Southern California. Their majors in
cluded Human Biology, Economics,
Communication and Political Sci
ence.
The sites and poses the photo
grapher chose depended largely on
the individual model's interests and
preferences. One woman was
photographed at KZSU where she is a
disc jockey and riding her bicycle
with the campus silhouetted in the
background.
Another woman posed on her
Honda in Stanford gym shorts and
T-shirt. She also posed in front of a
kiosk by the bookstore and in the
Quad. "They wanted to include
some of the Stanford campus' at
mosphere — the arches on the Quad
and Hoover Tower — in the picture,"
she said. A third woman was photo
graphed close-up and flying a kite in

Golden Gate Park.
The women who posed semi-nude
were photographed in their apart
ments. The twins described the
picture-taking as "sort of fun. We
were just sitting on the couch, doing
silly things — laughing, reading a
book, combing each other's hair."
One twin said, "The whole thing was
very natural. The photographer
made us feel at ease, and we didn't
have to do anything we didn't want to
do."
The other semi-nude model said
she was photographed "just sitting,
looking around, playing with a
flower. There were no action shots
per se."
Everyone photographed expres
sed very positive comments about
the photographer, Pompeo Posar
and his make-up artist, Gail Warden.
They took pictures only of Stanford
women, according to one model,
and spent a week here meeting with
the models, looking for sites, and
taking the photographs.
The sophomore model, who has
modeled before, said being photo
graphed for Playboy was "more in

tense" than her previous experi
ence. "He (the photographer) was
continually clicking the camera and
coaching me, saying 'smile, laugh,
look over your shoulder, be more
happy, don't look so serious.' It was
very tiring." Photographing time
ranged from 45 minutes to 2V2 hours,
according to the models.
Make-up time ranged from half an
hour to almost two hours. Make-up,
hair, and nails were kept very natural
— only a few changes were made in
each woman's appearance.
Posar took from eight to 15 rolls of
36-exposure film of each model. He
told one that he was "looking for one
lucky shot in 500." Another model
said she was told that all seven Stan
ford women photographed could be
included in the article, but that due
to technical problems, or lay-out and
space demands, several of them
might be omitted. They will be told in
May whether their picture will be
published in the magazine.
"Last year Playboy found their
Playmate-of-the-Year in the college
issue. Who knows, maybe this year
she will be from Stanford," one
woman remarked.
