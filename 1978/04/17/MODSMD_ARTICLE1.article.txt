# Seven women chosen for Playboy article
## 
### Susan Larsen 
Playboy magazine staff returned
here last week to photograph seven
women for possible inclusion in a
September article on Pac-8 women.
Three posed fully clothed, three
posed semi-nude, and one woman
could not be reached for comment.
The models said they had not
heard of anyone willing to pose
completely nude. "I assume most
women wouldn't want to pose nude.
I doubt if anyone would go that far at
Stanford; they make a big deal about
things like that here," one model
said.
The money Playboy offered was an
incentive to one woman who agreed
to pose semi-nude. "After all," she
remarked, "an extra 100 bucks is an
extra 100 bucks." She was also moti
vated, however, by the "experience
of being seen totally as a sex object."
The difference between modeling

for a fashion magazine and modeling
for Playboy, she explained, "is that
the Playboy photographer wants to
make you look good, not the clo
thing you're wearing. He's trying to
make you look sexy, like you're
seducing the camera, almost. More
of your personality comes across in
such a picture than in a fashion
photograph, which is much more
impersonal."
The two other women who posed
semi-nude were twins and said they
felt the pictures were "not that ris
que. I've posed for friends before,"
explained one twin, "and I've never
been very inhibited or overly mod
est." She, like several other seniors
who posed for Playboy, said she
"probably" would not have done so
if she was going to be at Stanford
next year, when the photographs are
published.
Each of the women anticipates

some degree of negative reaction if
their pictures appear in Playboy.
They said they felt the photographs
were "very artistic," "aesthetically
beautiful" and "not in bad taste at
all."
But all of them prefer to remain
anonymous for the present and have
told only a few close friends and fam
ily members. None of the women
who posed semi-nude have told their
parents.
"I expect an unfavorable reaction
for sure, wherever I am next year,"
one senior said. "People are always
going to be small-minded, especially
those who judge without having the
foggiest idea what the magazine's
like. Mostly it will be men who as

sume you're a certain type of girl just
because you posed semi-nude in
Playboy."
One semi-nude model described
her roommates' reaction as "sur
prised, but not overjoyed," while
one clothed model said her friends
were "very excited for me."
In general, the women who were
photographed in clothing said their
parents were "apprehensive and
wanted me to be sure they didn't
take anything out of context." But, as
one junior's boyfriend commented,
"So long as you've got your clothes
on . . . it's OK."
Five of the women said they went
to the initial interview with photo

Playboy photographer, David Chan, was here in February to interview prospec
tive candidates for a feature on Pac-8 women. Another photographer, Pompeo
Posar, actually photographed the seven Stanford women for the article. The
woman pictured with Chan did not participate in the interview.
