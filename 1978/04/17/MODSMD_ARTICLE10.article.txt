# Getting recognition
## Webb et al. 
### 
Senior Class Presidents represent
the student body and in particular
the Senior Class because of our
duties concerning Graduation, The
Alumni Association and the Career
Planning and Placement Center. As a
slate we are interested not only in
fulfilling this duty but in making next
year outstanding among our years at
Stanford.
Recognition of achievement is im
portant; thereforeweplantosetupa
program to acknowledge students
for significant or unusual work, pro
jects or talent. This could be in the
form of a bi-weekly Dailycolumn and
by sponsoring student art displays,
concerts, and publication. A portion
of the Senior Class funds which we
have charge of go towards social
events as well.
Some of our ideas include tailgat
ers during football season, sports

days, a boat dance and a trip to Napa.
To implement the above activities
requires efficient communications.
At the start of next year we would
hold a Senior Class meeting and set
up a committee to organize Senior
activities.
Newsletters, publicity, question
naires and direct contact with stu
dents are the best means of convey
ing and receiving ideas. We are defi
nitely looking for feedback.
As a group the four of us are re
sponsible, organized, energetic and
varied. Our diversity is a strength.
From academics to sports to personal
interests we differ, yet we are work
ing well together and having a fabul
ous time at it!
