# implementing events
## Newmark et al. 
### 
A Boat Dance, a Senior Directory, a
Casino nightâ€”any slatecan promise
you these things. As voters, you must
consider who is able to implement
these and other important events.
We believe we're the most experi
enced. Take a look at us for just a few
of our qualifications:
Dave Newmark: Human biology
major; he is currently an ASSU
Senator (alternate), the first student
to be involved with the administra
tion's current Housing Survey, and
Co-Founder of the Academic Or
ganizations Board.
Meg Smollen: Biology major; R.A.
in Branner Hall, and she served on
the Committee on Services to Stu
dents.
Eric Hirschberg: International Rela
tions major; President of the Beta
Theta Pi Fraternity, member of the
I.F.C.
Beppie Weintz: Communications
major; R.A. in Branner Hall, Stanford
Tour Guide, and she's on the Herit

age Fund raising committee.
We're planning for some of the old
and some of the new. Certain ac
tivities always work so why not re
peat them? We'll give you afternoons
at Zot's, a Senior Directory, and great
block parties. As for the new, we're
planning such things as Senior Ski
Weekends and Special Career Sym
posiums.
When it comes to something like
getting a commencement speaker of
the student's choice, you want
Senior Class Presidents who are used
to working with Administrators (who
approve the final decision anyway).
You also want Senior Class Presi
dents who are into good times and
know how to give them to you!!
Support your own best interests
for next year, support US!
