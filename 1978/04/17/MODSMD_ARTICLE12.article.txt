# Commitment needed
## Norm Fill 
### 
Someone once said, "Politicians
are all the same—they justwantyour
support to get in office." Personal
gain aside, seeking an office implies
a greater commitment than simply
gaining an official title — its a com
mitment to being responsible for ac
tions taken, responsive to consti
tuency served, and accessable to var
ious special interests. Admittedly,
different offices necessitate differing
degrees of commitment — but none
are really exempt from these three
areas. This is especially true of the
office of Senior Class President.
To date, I have not heard the other
slates speak to the question of in
volvement of the class at large in the
planning of next year's events. Yes,
there has been a lot of fanfare, baby
kissing, and the like. Voters have
been asked to plow with the farmers,
conspire with the prisoners, and to
pack their bagsand go west. Butwhat
about really getting down to brass

tacks and organizing the talents of
the senior class to service the senior
class? This commitment has been
mine alone.
Promises of happy hours, class
trips, and a gala senior class ball are
the standard offerings in this elec
tion. Organizing events such as
these seems to be an implicit re
quirement of the job of class presi
dent, not campaign issues. What is
important is how the office will poll
what seniors want and will work with
willing individuals to set up events
reflecting their particular interests.
Potentially, everyone in the class can
contribute in some way to next year's
festivities — provided, of course,
that the organization is there.
If you really wish to have a say in
how your beer money is spent next
year, give my slate your vote. With
your support and involvement it can
be one helluva year!
