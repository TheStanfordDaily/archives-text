# Trying to give an innovative outlook

It is disappointing to see Andy
Lundberg's criticism of SOC Dis
orientation Week (Daily, April 1). His
saying, "I've been swindled," seems
to me to be part of a conservative
attitude that makes money more val
uable than the experience we ex
change it for; an attitude that we can
passively buy everything we want
without putting direct energy into it.
Lundberg'sattitude is precisely the
type that needs the innovative out
look of Disorientation Week, to see
beyond financial cost to a beneficial
experience. Lundberg ought to
center more on the fact that "Dis
orientation Week is a masterpiece of
organization and a sincere effort to
encourage the discussion of impor

tant issues."
We have the chance to hear so
cially and politically active women
and men — through panels, films,
workshops — as well as fellow stu
dents, who are exploring alternative
analyses of our society, and modes of
communication and change.
Women's Week last October was
similar in presenting a wide range of
activities centered around women's
issues, in order to educate the com
munity beyond the traditional cur
riculum. I took advantage of every
free hour and learned an amazing
amount, which gave me a new
feminist perspective on our culture.
Disorientation Week is another
opportunity to share the experiences

and concerns of many groups that
are not normally represented fairly in
our white male-dominated society:
including women, blacks, Asian
Americans, Chicanos, native Ameri
cans, Jews, gays and workers. Most
anyone who belongs to or em
pathizes with one of these groups
knows how our culture oppresses all
of us — makes us afraid, lonely,
self-degradating, violent, elusive.
Disorientation Week serves as a
very important attempt to unite all
minorities in order to build solidar
ity, to seethatwearea majority when
our efforts are united.
SOC didn't break any rules to or
ganize this week. It's more construc-

tive to learn something from this pro
ject of our student government, than
to aloofly criticize it, on account of
money — money that could hardly
be spent more educationally.
We fear that our money (often our
means of measuring our human
worth) will be taken away without
material exchange. Typically human,
we fear the insecurity of change and
self-criticism. Now we are being
asked to analyze our culture con
scientiously, not selfishly. After all,
learning and life necessitate growth
and change.
