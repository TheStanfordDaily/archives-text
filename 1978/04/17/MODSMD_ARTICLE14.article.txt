# Wild and serious
## Wachtel et al. 
### 
As the Wild and Serious slate we
will plan the appropriate activities at
the appropriate times. Since we see
the office of Senior Class President as
having a limited (if any) political func
tion, we have had no political
strategy. Unification of the class is
important to the extent that it is what
seniors want, however, we are no
longer living in freshmen dorms.
Our goal, then, is more to maximize
involvement of a diverse group of
people in their final year at Stanford.
Ideas are also important to the extent
they can be carried out by the class
president.
Involvement will be accomplished
by designing activities and programs
representative of our interests such
as wild Thursday night parties at the
Oasis, a "real world" senior lecture
series, a senior trip raffle where two
seniors are sent away every quarter,
and an off-campus housing guide

sent to all seniors before returning to
school in the fall.
In addition we will continue the
traditional Friday afternoon happy
hours, the senior casino party, and
early selection of a commencement
speaker (Woody Allen, if we can
convince him that California is not
such a bad place to visit.)
The four of us have decided to run
as a slate because we feel that we will
have good times together planning
the events that will make our senior
year memorable. We will work as in
dividuals to determine the various
needs and interests of the class and
collectively to develop the activities
which will cover these interests.
