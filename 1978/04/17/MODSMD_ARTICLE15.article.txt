# Organizing activities
## Hanley et al. 
### 
We feel that it is extremely impor
tant for the Senior Class Presidents to
provide a dynamic and sought-after
speaker for graduation. We also feel
that the senior class should have
some input in the selection of this
speaker. Therefore, we propose to
include a questionnaire in the fall
Reg Pack which would allow seniors
to indicate their speaker preference
early in the year. The results of this
poll would let contacting possible
speakers begin immediately.
For many seniors the major task of
the Senior Class Presidents is seen to
be the organization of class social ac
tivities. In view of this we intend to
continue the traditional Zot's Happy
Hours, Pizza and Beer Study Breaks,
and football tailgaters.
In addition, we would like to see
new events such as a Palm Springs
Weekend, Senior Ice Skating at the
Cow Palace, a Big Sur camping trip, a
Napa Valley Wine Tasting trip, etc.
Our plan is to spread these events

over all three quarters so that no one
quarter lacks a good number of so
cial activities.
In order to keep seniors informed
of these events we will continue the
Senior Sheet(a senior newletter) and
improve the system of Senior House
Reps. With such a communication
system we can also keep seniors ab
reast of information concerning
career opportunities and academic
events of special interest to seniors.
We intend to make special efforts to
keep off-campus seniors informed
about class activities.
Senior Class Presidents need to be
creative, enthusiastic and have or
ganizational ability. The Hanley,
Schorr, Fischer, Larson slate has
these qualities and so we feel we can
do a helluva job.
