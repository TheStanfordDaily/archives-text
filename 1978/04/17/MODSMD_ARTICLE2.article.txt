## CIR unanimously supports proxy 
### Randy Keith 
The Stanford Commission on In
vestment Responsibility unanim
ously voted to recommend that the
Board of Trustees vote in favor of a
shareholder proposal calling for a
Texaco affiliate, Caltex, to withdraw
from South Africa.
The commission also voted in
favor of a stockholders' resolution
calling on Texaco to investigate alle
gations that Caltex is violating United
Nations embargo on oil sales to
Rhodesia.
It was the first time since the new
CIR was established last ]anuary that
they have recommended the trus
tees vote in favor of a proxy for with
drawal.
"We're very glad that the CIR has
recommended a position of corpo
rate withdrawal and hope that the
trustees take the system seriously
and adopt this as their policy as
well," said SCRIP spokesperson Kim
McCall.
At its last meeting the CIR voted
against U.S. corporate expansion in
South Africa and in favor of eventual
U.S. corporate withdrawal from the
country.

In its report released yesterday,
the CIR also decided to recommend
the trustees abstain on three other
shareholder resolutions and made
no recommendation on two others.
The commission said it voted for
Caltex withdrawal because the com
pany has not worked "openly for the
abrogation of laws which render the
political and economic system ra
cially discriminatory." In addition, it
said the "actual effect of its (Caltex)
presence in South Africa and the use
of its products there is to reinforce
the repressive capacity of the white
minority regime."
"Although Caltex has made prog
ress in recent years in socially affir
mative action in South Africa, the
commission was not persuaded that
the record was exceptional.
"Since 1975, Caltex has mounted a
major expansion of its Milnerton re
finery, with up to 75 per cent of the
financing for the $135 million project
provided by sources outside the
country.
"Recent company action made in
the face of mounting protest over
corporate activity in South Africa . . .
