# Card nine split two with USC
## Stanford solves Bordley's home field mastery 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The Cardinal baseball team returned to
Stanford yesterday from the Southern
California campus not victorious, but not
empty-handed either.
The Cards ended up on the losing side
of their second league matchup of the 1978
season having dropped two games of
three to the No. 1 ranked USC Trojans.
The Trojans won the opener 7-0 on
Thursday, Stanford came back in a fine
showing to defeat USC 3-2 on Friday, and
then, after a rainy Saturday, the teams
picked up the series Sunday when the Tro
jans put on their Sunday best and in an 11
hit attack, downed the Cards 8-3.
The two losses even Stanford's league
record at three wins and three losses, but
that by no means puts the Cards out of the
Pac-8 race. "Everyone has at least two los
ses," said Stanford coach Mark Marquess.
"How things go this next weekend will be
very important."
After the shutout Thursday night, Stan
ford was determined to let USC know that
being ranked No. 1 didn't guarantee vic
tory.
The Cardinals, behind a solid perfor
mance by sophomore pitcher Larry Kuhn,
outbattled the Trojans and came through
in the late innings of the ball game to hand
USC's ace Bill Bordley his first loss as a
Trojan (Bordley finished last year at 14-0
and was 6-0 going into Friday night's
game).
Friday's matchup was definitely a
pitcher's duel, oddly enough between two
former teammates — Kuhn and Bordley.

"It was kind of a personal victory for me,"
said Kuhn after his performance, "but it
was more of a team thing. Crowing up in
Southern California (Torrance), all you
ever hear is SC this and SC that ... I just
don't think they're that great."
Kuhn and Bordley each yielded six hits
in the 3-2 ball game, but Stanford put to
gether a rally in the top of the ninth that
was too tough for the Trojans to stifle.
Todd Ervin led off with a single in that
inning, was moved to second on a
groundout by Dave Perez, to third on a
groundout by Pepe Hinojosa and scored
on a two-down must-have single by desig
nated hitter Randy Wong.
Kuhn retired the side in the bottom of
the ninth getting catcher Dave Van Gorder
to ground out to Perez, and relying on
centerfielder Larry Reynolds to put away
the final two batters on hard hit fly balls to
center. "I was getting a little tired after the
seventh," said Kuhn, "but even though
they were hitting me hard, I was able to
make them go after a lot of pitches that I
wanted them to."
Sunday, the critical element of pitching
went the other way and favored the Tro
jans, who put senior righthander Ernie
Mauritson on the mound. Though Maurit
son gave up 10 hits in the eight innings he
pitched, he was able to retire the Stanford
batters before they could bring the
baserunners in to score. Stanford left 11
batters stranded in the nine inning game.
"Our pitching is crucial," commented
Marquess, "since we don't score very
many runs." Referring to Thursday's and

Friday's pitchers — Brian Hayes and
Bordley — Marquess said "There are no
two better pitchers in the league. USC's
pitching is tough and they've got good hit
ting behind them."
Power hitting played a big role in Sun
day's game (not to mention a fierce wind
blowing out to right field which gave a
couple of the balls a little help getting out
of the park). The big guns of USC collected
11 hits including three homeruns, three
doubles and one triple.
Chris Smith led the Trojans, going two
for-five with a 385-foot, two-run homerun
to left-center and a triple to right. Smith
started the game in the designated hitter
position after sitting out the past three
weeks due to an ankle injury. Firstbase
man Dave Hostetler blasted a solo home
run in the fourth inning and Tim Tolman
did the same in the fifth.
For the Cards, secondbaseman Ervin
and centerfielder Reynolds — batting in
the number two and three positions in
Sunday's lineup — led the offensive attack.
Ervin went five-for-five,
including two doubles, while Reynolds
went four-for-five.

game).
Friday's matchup was definitely a
pitcher's duel, oddly enough between two
former teammates — Kuhn and Bordley.

"It was kind of a personal victory for me,"
said Kuhn after his performance, "but it
was more of a team thing. Crowing up in
Southern California (Torrance), all you
ever hear is SC this and SC that ... I just
don't think they're that great."
Kuhn and Bordley each yielded six hits
in the 3-2 ball game, but Stanford put to
gether a rally in the top of the ninth that
was too tough for the Trojans to stifle.
Todd Ervin led off with a single in that
inning, was moved to second on a
groundout by Dave Perez, to third on a
groundout by Pepe Hinojosa and scored
on a two-down must-have single by desig
nated hitter Randy Wong.
Kuhn retired the side in the bottom of
the ninth getting catcher Dave Van Gorder
to ground out to Perez, and relying on
centerfielder Larry Reynolds to put away
the final two batters on hard hit fly balls to
center. "I was getting a little tired after the
seventh," said Kuhn, "but even though
they were hitting me hard, I was able to
make them go after a lot of pitches that I
wanted them to."
Sunday, the critical element of pitching
went the other way and favored the Tro
jans, who put senior righthander Ernie
Mauritson on the mound. Though Maurit
son gave up 10 hits in the eight innings he
pitched, he was able to retire the Stanford
batters before they could bring the
baserunners in to score. Stanford left 11
batters stranded in the nine inning game.
"Our pitching is crucial," commented
Marquess, "since we don't score very
many runs." Referring to Thursday's and

Friday's pitchers — Brian Hayes and
Bordley — Marquess said "There are no
two better pitchers in the league. USC's
pitching is tough and they've got good hit
ting behind them."
Power hitting played a big role in Sun
day's game (not to mention a fierce wind
blowing out to right field which gave a
couple of the balls a little help getting out
of the park). The big guns of USC collected
11 hits including three homeruns, three
doubles and one triple.
Chris Smith led the Trojans, going two
for-five with a 385-foot, two-run homerun
to left-center and a triple to right. Smith
started the game in the designated hitter
position after sitting out the past three
weeks due to an ankle injury. Firstbase
man Dave Hostetler blasted a solo home
run in the fourth inning and Tim Tolman
did the same in the fifth.
For the Cards, secondbaseman Ervin
and centerfielder Reynolds — batting in
the number two and three positions in
Sunday's lineup — led the offensive attack.
Ervin went five-for-five,
including two doubles, while Reynolds
went four-for-five.
The Cardinal baseball team returned to
Stanford yesterday from the Southern
California campus not victorious, but not
empty-handed either.
The Cards ended up on the losing side
of their second league matchup of the 1978
season having dropped two games of
three to the No. 1 ranked USC Trojans.
The Trojans won the opener 7-0 on
Thursday, Stanford came back in a fine
showing to defeat USC 3-2 on Friday, and
then, after a rainy Saturday, the teams
picked up the series Sunday when the Tro
jans put on their Sunday best and in an 11
hit attack, downed the Cards 8-3.
The two losses even Stanford's league
record at three wins and three losses, but
that by no means puts the Cards out of the
Pac-8 race. "Everyone has at least two los
ses," said Stanford coach Mark Marquess.
"How things go this next weekend will be
very important."
After the shutout Thursday night, Stan
ford was determined to let USC know that
being ranked No. 1 didn't guarantee vic
tory.
The Cardinals, behind a solid perfor
mance by sophomore pitcher Larry Kuhn,
outbattled the Trojans and came through
in the late innings of the ball game to hand
USC's ace Bill Bordley his first loss as a
Trojan (Bordley finished last year at 14-0
and was 6-0 going into Friday night's
game).
