# False starts sink tracksters
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
Perhaps it was appropriate
that on a day when many felt
the meet never should have
started, Stanford lost because
of false starts.
UCLA defeated Stanford,
90-63, Saturday before 500
hardy souls on a cold, wet and
windy day at Stanford Stadium.
In the other dual meet of the
Day, USC mauled California,
100-48.
False starts — three of them
—cost Stanford what appeared
to be an excellent chance of
upsetting the Bruins.
After eight events, UCLA
held a five-point lead, 36-31.
The next event was the 100
meters, an event which Stan
ford, through the speed of
James Lofton, Gordon Banks
and Darrin Nelson, hoped to
sweep and go out to a strong
lead.
Alas, the bottom fell out.
First, Lofton jumped the gun. It
was a close call, but he jumped
nonetheless. After debating
the point, Lofton bowed out.
On the next start, Banks
jumped out way ahead of
everyone. It was an obvious
call. It was just as obvious that
with only Nelson left in the
race, Stanford's dreams of de
cisively winning the race had
been frittered away. The next
start was good, and Montreal
Olympian Millard Hampton
led the Bruin sprinters to a
1-2-3 sweep.
Stanford coach Payton Jor
dan called it the turning point
of the meet. "Our momentum
was derailed. It turned the
meetaround, and hurt us a lot.
"We were on schedule up to
the 100, and felt we had a good
chance to win with the 5000
meters, the 200 meters and the
mile relay all coming up."
Indeed, Stanford won all
those events, and with impres
sive performances. Roy Kissin
won the 5000 meters with a
solid run of 14:20.6. He battled
Cal's Hal Schulz for the lead,
and at 3000 meters, pulled
away and won by 60 yards. Tom
O'Neil placed fourth, losing
third to UCLA's Barrie Williams
on the last lap.

Lofton won the 200 in a race
which was never in doubt. The
expected threat in the person
of Hampton never
materialized as Lofton won
going away.
The results were the same in
the mile relay. After two laps,
UCLA held a slight lead, but
Alan Sheats burst out and
grabbed the lead almost im
mediately from Bruin Lew
McGlothin, and Lofton put
them away with a blistering an
chor leg of 45.8.
Jordan also felt that Stanford
could have won the 400 inter
mediate hurdles, but senior
Tom Shellworth jumped early
and was disqualified. Accord
ing to Jordan, "this is where we
were taken out of the meet.
Had we had those points we
lost in the disqualifications, we
would have been close enough
to give the kids a chance to do
what was needed to win."
Let it be known, however,
that Jordan was far from dis
satisfied with the team's per
formance.
"The kids did very well in
competing. Tom Lobsinger
upset Williams in the 1500, just
as we expected him to do.
Mark Stillman broke the
freshman record for the 800
(1:51.4, right behind UCLA's
Conrad Suhr), and quite
frankly, some of them did even
better than we expected."
One promising aspect of
yesterday's loss for Stanford
was the impressive showing by
the freshmen. Besides Stillman
and Logsinger, Ken Margerum
outdueled Gregory Foster
(seventh in the world) for sec
ond in the 110 high hurdles,
finishing behind Olympian
James Owens. Nelson
ran a strong opening leg on the
winning 400 meter relay, and
finished fourth in both the 100
meters and the long jump.
In other field events, Dave
Thomson threw a career best
149-11 in the discus, and Matt
Pear did likewise in the shot
put, capturing fourth with a put
of 47-1.
Jordan was pleased with
their talent and more so with
their potential. "All of them

have bright futures. It was their
first meet at home against big
name competition, and they
didn't shy away. They showed a
good amount of poise, deter
mination and concentration."
As far as the rain was con
cerned, Jordan was
philosophical. "It was the same
for everyone. I'm sure
everyone could have per
formed better, but you go with
what is there. It's not always
going to be sunny and warm. A
good athlete can overcome any
obstacle to perform well. In
addition, it was good prepara
tion for the weather we'll be
getting in Corvallis for the
Pac-8 meet and in Eugene for
the NCAAs."
Jordan commented that all
four coaches got together be
fore the meet to make a deci
sion whether to run or not. The
consensus was "Hell yes, we're
here, so let's run."
Ironically, Jordan called yes
terday "one of the brighter
days in Stanford athletics."
It is doubtful that any one of
the 500 cold, wet faithful who
came to the meet would agree
with him. As a matter of fact,
one fan sarcastically remarked
that "there weren't enough
lanes for a swim meet, so they
went ahead with the track
meet."
