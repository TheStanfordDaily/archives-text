# Netters smash Cal, 7-2
## McEnroe shines in home debut 
### Jeff Brandon 
"Impressive. He looks like he's just toying
with his man. He can do so much with the ball.
He's tough."
This is what one fan thought of Stanford
Freshman John McEnroe in his home debut.
McEnroe dumped Cal's Cary Stansbury, 6-1,6-3,
and led Stanford to a 7-2 victory over the eighth
ranked Bears FridayatStanfordTennisStadium.
Coach Dick Gould described the team's play
as "sluggish" but was very happy with the vic
tory.
"Cal's a very good team," commented Could.
"So I'm really pleased we beat them. It wasn't
our best match, but I don't think we've played
our best match as a team yet. We'll definitely
have to play better in order to beat UCLA and
USC."
In Friday's feature match, McEnroe pleased
the crowd with his nonchalant straight set vic
tory over Stansbury. Stansbury, like many
McEnroe opponents, seemed intimidated play
ing the Wimbledon semi-finalist and his play
showed it. McEnroe took advantage of his op
ponent's timid play and never really let him into
the match.
"John's just a better player," pointed out
Could. "Cary'sagood player, but he's just not in
John's class. He made it look rather routine."

Bill Maze played a flat first set, but as the
match got going, he got in gear. After dropping
the first set 6-3 to Cal's All-American, Marty
Davis, Maze took the second, 6-3 and the third
6-0.
Matt Mitchell looked very impressive in spots,
stopping Chris (Slam) Dunk 7-6, 6-2. Mitchell,
the defending NCAA champion, impressed the
fans with his outstanding quickness and devas
tating vollies. After playing a tight first set,
Mitchell loosened up and crunched Dunk in the
style that made him the top college tennis player
in the nation last year.
Peter Rennert, who has only dropped one
singles match this year, continued to play well.
Down a set, and behind 3-1 in the second, Re
nnert rallied for a three set win. John Rast got
back on the winning track with a 6-3, 6-4 whip
ping of Scott McCain.
In doubles, the Cards continued to play well.
Maze and McEnroe, undefeated this year,
added Dunk and Davis to their string of victims
with an easy 6-4, 6-2 win. They have emerged as
one of the top doubles teams in college tennis.
Mitchell and Wright lost a tough three set match
7-5 in the third set. The newly formed team of
Rennert and Lloyd Bourne were also victorious.
The Cards tangle with sixth ranked USC on
Thursday and second ranked UCLA on Saturday.
