# Spikers win NorCals
## 
### 
Stanford's men's volleyball
coach Art Lambert had pre
dicted from the earliest days of
the season that the California
Golden Bears would be the
most likely team to dethrone
the Cardinals as the NorCal
champions.
Lambert, however, forgot to
ask his team about that.
Saturday, in Berkeley, the
Cards defeated the Bears in
five games to retain the title for
the second year in a row.
The stage was set Friday
night as Stanford defeated
Chico 15-9, 15-6, 7-15, 15-3 in
their semi-final match and Cal
beat Santa Clara.

The finale Saturday night
began with a 15-9 Bear victory,
but the Cards came back in the
second game to win by the
same score. In the all
important third game, Cal put
the pressure on Stanford with a
15-10 victory. After that, how
ever, it was all Stanford as the
Cards cruised to an easy 15-5
win in the fourth game and
jumped off to a 14-3 lead in the
tiebreaker before grabbing the
championship with a 15-10
score.
"We completely dominated
them in the last two games,"
said Lambert. "It was a great

culmination to the season."
Lambert was pleased with
the Cards' 13-8 finish for the
season.
"The team, in spite of the
problems (due to inexperi
ence), really did well," Lam
bert said. "This year was a
learning year. You have to give
a lot of credit to the guys, they
really hung in there."
Predominantly composed of
freshmen and sophomores,
the Cards will lose only Wen
dell Burkhoffer and Ace Ed
wards, whom Lambert called
the team's "best hitter," to
graduation.
