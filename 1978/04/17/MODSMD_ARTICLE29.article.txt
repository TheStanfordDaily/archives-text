Ski tram accident kills four
Squaw Valley, Calif. — It was the ski tram's
last trip of the day down the mountain at
Squaw Valley, loaded with vacationers. One of
its three thick cables popped off its roller and
ripped through the car, killing four persons
and injuring the other 30 aboard.
A second tram car on the same line was
heading up the mountain with 70 persons and
piles of ski gear. No one inside was injured,
but that car was left dangling hundreds of feet
from the ground during a 10-hour rescue op
eration that lasted until early yesterday morn
ing.
An official said one of the car's three cables
had gone slack and jumped off its roller, just
after the 10-foot-wide, 30-foot-long tram
began its descent of Emigrant Peak. From 8000
feet up the mountain, it went bouncing 50 to 70
feet down the remaining lines, then slid
rapidly downhill another 100 feet before it was
halted by an emergency cable, 70 feet above
the ground.
Botulism breakout reported
Clovis, N.M. — One of the largest outbreaks
of botulism in the United States this century —
32 cases — has been traced to a posh country
club here, and authorities said yesterday they
have made emergency preparations in the
event more people are stricken.
Dr. Jonathan Mann, the state's chief medical
officer, said a third of the sick were in serious
condition and placed on respirators. No

deaths were reported.
The three newest cases surfaced yesterday.
"What we fear is that the source of the
poisoning is possibly a commercially sold food
product, which could mean others in other
parts of the country will get hold of it also,"
Mann said.
Killing Moro would be 'error'
Rome — Italy's President told the terrorist
kidnappers of former Premier Aldo Moro yes
terday that killing Moro would be a "fatal er
ror" and would gain them "absolutely no
thing."
President Giovanni Leone's appeal for the
life of his long-time colleague was made indi
rectly in an open message to Moro's wife one
day after the Red Brigades kidnappers an
nounced that a "people's court" had con
demned Moro to death.
The ruling Christian Democrat Party, mean
while, indicated a possible softening of its re
fusal to deal with the Marxist urban guerrilla
group for the release of Moro, who is party
president.
U.N. resolution leads to talks
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet declared
yesterday that the U.N. resolution calling for
withdrawal from occupied lands is the basis for
peace talks with Jordan, as well as with other
Arab states, but a spokesman said this did not
signal a softening of Israeli policy on the West
Bank.

The Cabinet invited the Arabs to propose
new ideas, however, that might change the
Israeli position.
In the occupied West Bank, meanwhile,
Palestinians firebombed a military vehicle and
authorities reported four Israeli soldiers were
slightly injured. In Beirut, the Palestinian
Popular Democratic Front claimed responsibil
ity for the raid and said at least 10 Israelis were
killed or injured.
Vance continues peace effort
Pretoria, South Africa — Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance and his British counterpart
sought the support of white-ruled South Africa
yesterday in bringing the new biracial govern
ment of Rhodesia to the peace table with black
guerrillas.
Bishop Abel Muzorewa, a black member of
Rhodesia's ruling council, underlined the dif
ficulty of the British-American mission, saying
in Salisbury his government would be "stub
born, firm and uncompromising" if attempts
were made to change the constitutional plan it
is now following.
Vance and Foreign Secretary David Owen of
Britain flew here to meet with South African
Foreign Minister R.F. Botha after their
weekend conference in Tanzania with Rhode
sian guerrilla leaders Joshua Nkomo and
Robert Mugabe.
Opposition shown to Marcos
Manila, Philippines — The first elections in

5% years of martial law gave President Fer
dinand Marcos the subservient national as
sembly he expected. But the elections also
confirmed a significant dissident movement
that had not surfaced before.
"We're conducting a survey ... to deter
mine why votes were cast against the administ
ration," Marcos said at a news conference last
week. "I intend to find out if the voting re
quires any change in policies."
One change ordered by Marcos is an end to
the impunity enjoyed during the 45-day cam
paign by candidates who attacked him, his
politically powerful wife and martial law in
their speeches.

and state Sen. John Briggs of Fullerton —
trailed far behind Davis and Maddy in CRA
voting.

the ground.
Botulism breakout reported
Clovis, N.M. — One of the largest outbreaks
of botulism in the United States this century —
32 cases — has been traced to a posh country
club here, and authorities said yesterday they
have made emergency preparations in the
event more people are stricken.
Dr. Jonathan Mann, the state's chief medical
officer, said a third of the sick were in serious
condition and placed on respirators. No

deaths were reported.
The three newest cases surfaced yesterday.
"What we fear is that the source of the
poisoning is possibly a commercially sold food
product, which could mean others in other
parts of the country will get hold of it also,"
Mann said.
Killing Moro would be 'error'
Rome — Italy's President told the terrorist
kidnappers of former Premier Aldo Moro yes
terday that killing Moro would be a "fatal er
ror" and would gain them "absolutely no
thing."
President Giovanni Leone's appeal for the
life of his long-time colleague was made indi
rectly in an open message to Moro's wife one
day after the Red Brigades kidnappers an
nounced that a "people's court" had con
demned Moro to death.
The ruling Christian Democrat Party, mean
while, indicated a possible softening of its re
fusal to deal with the Marxist urban guerrilla
group for the release of Moro, who is party

U.N. resolution leads to talks
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet declared
yesterday that the U.N. resolution calling for
withdrawal from occupied lands is the basis for
peace talks with Jordan, as well as with other
Arab states, but a spokesman said this did not
signal a softening of Israeli policy on the West
Bank.

The Cabinet invited the Arabs to propose
new ideas, however, that might change the
Israeli position.
In the occupied West Bank, meanwhile,
Palestinians firebombed a military vehicle and
authorities reported four Israeli soldiers were
slightly injured. In Beirut, the Palestinian
Popular Democratic Front claimed responsibil
ity for the raid and said at least 10 Israelis were
killed or injured.

weekend conference in Tanzania with Rhode

Opposition shown to Marcos
Manila, Philippines — The first elections in

5% years of martial law gave President Fer
dinand Marcos the subservient national as
sembly he expected. But the elections also
confirmed a significant dissident movement
that had not surfaced before.
"We're conducting a survey ... to deter
mine why votes were cast against the administ
ration," Marcos said at a news conference last
week. "I intend to find out if the voting re
quires any change in policies."
One change ordered by Marcos is an end to
the impunity enjoyed during the 45-day cam
paign by candidates who attacked him, his
politically powerful wife and martial law in
their speeches.
