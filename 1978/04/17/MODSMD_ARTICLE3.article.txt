# New retirement age to affect University
## 
### Karen Benedek 
With the signing of new federal
and state retirement laws, University
faculty and staff cannot be forced to
retire before 70 years of age.
Present laws require retirement at
65, although some professors are re
called to teach with limited
schedules. These professors receive
from 10 to 100 per cent of their origi
nal salaries.
What seems to be an indisputable
issue of banning age discrimination
is a complex and difficult problem for
the University, said Jean Fetter, assis
tant to the president.
"You have to look at the retire
ment question from both ends," Fet
ter said. "Affirmative action candi
dates, women and young men would
suffer."
Finding a teaching position in a
university is difficult under present
situations, she said. With older pro
fessors keeping their full teaching
schedules, competition for the few
open slots will be fierce.
Discouragement
There is the possibility that young
scholars will be discouraged from
pursuing post-graduate work be
cause of the limited opportunities in
teaching that will be available, ac
cording to a report by the American
Association of University Professors
(AAUP).
In view of these problems, univer
sities have been given a one to two
year grace period before laws are
enacted to readjust their staffing
policies. The Administrative Panel of

Retirement, headed by Provost Wil
liam Miller, will recommend action
to President Richard Lyman after its
analysis of the situation.
"The University is seeking some
clearly articulated policy on the mat
ter," said Fetter, a member of the
panel. The panel, made up of faculty
and staff, will probably report to the
president by the end of this summer,
"but there is no deadline for the re
port," she said.
The new retirement laws will be
come effective at different times for
different groups of employees. The
laws will go into effect January 1980
for tenured faculty, January 1979 for
non-tenured faculty and non-union
staff and September 1979 for United
Stanford Employees.
Forced retirement
Before the laws take effect, at least
21 faculty members will be forced to
retire.
"Those professors who had been
very active at Stanford and felt they
created fields of study here did not
want to retire," said Larue Carnes, an
anthropology student who con
ducted a survey of retired profes
sors. Sixty-five is a "peak time in their
careers," she said. To retire is a
"waste of time."
But for young assistant professors
seeking college positions and stu
dents who must finance the salaries
of professors over 65, early retire
ment legislation is a troublesome
concern, according to the AAUP re
port.
