# Athletes ask for griffin mascot
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
A petition asking for official con
sideration of the griffin as a mascot
for all Stanford athletic teams was
presented to President Richard
Lyman Thursday afternoon by five
varsity athletes.
The group presented the petition,
signed by 225 athletes from 18 sports,
and a statement which said, "The his
tory and tradition of Stanford athle
tics, and the University itself, can be
enhanced by the powerful effect
which an appropriate mascot can
provide."
The statement also said that the
griffin, a half-eagle, half-lion crea
ture of mythology, "as Stanford's
symbol can rectify our weak mascot
situation."
"The Griffin symbol itself is majes
tic yet ferocious, both swift and alert,
portraying valor and wisdom. As a
school symbol the griffin is used by
few other institutions, a complimen
tary aspect for Stanford, a unique in
stitution in itself."
Athletes pleased
Gordon Banks, one of the
petitioners, said the group was
pleased with the meeting and added
that the University president seemed
enthusiastic about the idea.
A sophomore on the football and
track teams, Banks said the athletes
supporting the movement to adopt
the griffin plan to unify campus sup
port of the idea.
"We hope to take the idea to diffe
rent people of authority in the Uni
versity and drum up support for it,"
Banks said. "Once a widespread
base of support for the griffin has
been established, the group plans to
take the proposal to the ASSU Senate
and the COP," Banks said.
"We want to analyze the feasibility
of instituting the griffin here at Stan
ford," Banks said. "We want to get
the general student body educated
about what the griffin is."
Lyman said he would be talking to
various people about the proposal
and thinking about its possibilities.
Good motive
"The group has a good motive if
they are trying to find a mascot that
will unite instead of divide the cam
pus community," Lyman said. He
added he was not sure whether the
griffin was such a mascot, but said
"the effort undertaken by these stu
dents is a laudable one."
"We talked about how difficult it is
to operate without a mascot that is
more tangible than Cardinal, which
is a color," Lyman said.
Much of the impetus for the move
to adopt the griffin is rooted in what
many see as the ambiguity of the cur
rent team name, the Cardinals.
"Is it bird or color?" the athletes'
statement asked. "Either way, Cardi
nal is not a powerful representative
symbol."
"It's hard to create a unifying mas
cot overnight," Lyman said. "It's
probably a good idea not to rush
things."
Copies of the petition and state
ment were also given to Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons and Athletic
Director Joe Ruetz.
Mark Hadley, Mandy Read, Onnie
Killefer, Kimberly Belton and Banks
presented the petition to Lyman.
