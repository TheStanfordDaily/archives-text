# Rally filmed by narcotics agent
## 
### Robert Mauro Dan Fiduccia 
A lot of film was shot at Thursday's rally to protest
against the Bakke decision and the Bank of America.
Tnere were TV cameramen, newspaper and University
photographers, and a host of amateurs, including two
Palo Alto Police Department (PAPD) narcotics inves
tigators with cameras.
After the demonstrators left The Farm, they crossed El
Camino Real on University Avenue. As Daily Associate
Editor Dan Fiduccia climbed the embankment to the
Southern Pacific overpass to photograph the approach
ing marchers, he stumbled upon a well-dressed man
busily filming the demonstrators with a home movie
camera from behind a clump of trees. A few yards away,
another man, properly attired in a three-piece suit, sat in
a dirty battered van.
Fiduccia recognized the van as the same one that had
caused some controversy two years ago, when several
persons had claimed that the van had been used for
surveillance purposes when then-President Gerald Ford
spoke on campus. At the time, the Stanford Department
of Public Safety acknowledged that they had such a
vehicle but said it was used to apprehend bicycle and car
thieves, and never for purposes of political surveillance.
After the rally, the Daily contacted Marvin Herrington,
director of the Department of Public Safety. He said that
the van was not being used that day by Stanford officers.
"Our guys were in a Plymouth, butwe do loan the van
out to other law enforcement agencies. It's common
practice with small departments," Herrington said.

Meanwhile a PAPD spokesman said only the "stan
dard units" were used at the demonstration. A special
agent at the Palo Alto office of the FBI also denied any
connection with the incident.
Friday morning, Herrington said the van had been
loaned earlier in the week to the Palo Alto police for a
narcotics stake-out, and that the PAPD had told him that
the two officers who filmed the march were on their way
to court. The North County courthouse is four blocks
south of University Avenue.
After contacting the PAi'D again the Daily was told
that two PAPD investigators had indeed borrowed the
van for a narcotics stake-out in south Palo Alto. Accord
ing to Investigations Captain Bob Elliott, the officers had
also borrowed a new Polaroid instant-film movie camera
from a local camera store.
"We used the van for a narcotics investigation, but
when nothing went down, we had this new camera and
wanted to test it... so why not do it in broad daylight. I
guess these marchers were the first interesting thing to
come along," said Elliott.
Seven years ago last Wednesday, four PAPD officers
used an unconstitutional warrant to search the Daily's
office in an attempt to find photographs of de
monstrators. However, Elliott told the Daily Friday that
the police department's photographs "didn't turn out
too well, the lens was bad and the film was slow. You can
come on down and get them if you want."
Herrington reiterated that the van is not used for polit
ical surveillance and mused, "It's getting pretty old, we
should get a new one."

agent at the Palo Alto office of the FBI also denied any
connection with the incident.
Friday morning, Herrington said the van had been
loaned earlier in the week to the Palo Alto police for a
narcotics stake-out, and that the PAPD had told him that
the two officers who filmed the march were on their way
to court. The North County courthouse is four blocks
south of University Avenue.
After contacting the PAi'D again the Daily was told
that two PAPD investigators had indeed borrowed the
van for a narcotics stake-out in south Palo Alto. Accord
ing to Investigations Captain Bob Elliott, the officers had
also borrowed a new Polaroid instant-film movie camera
from a local camera store.
"We used the van for a narcotics investigation, but
when nothing went down, we had this new camera and
wanted to test it... so why not do it in broad daylight. I
guess these marchers were the first interesting thing to
come along," said Elliott.
Seven years ago last Wednesday, four PAPD officers
used an unconstitutional warrant to search the Daily's
office in an attempt to find photographs of de
monstrators. However, Elliott told the Daily Friday that
the police department's photographs "didn't turn out
too well, the lens was bad and the film was slow. You can
come on down and get them if you want."
Herrington reiterated that the van is not used for polit
ical surveillance and mused, "It's getting pretty old, we
should get a new one."

A lot of film was shot at Thursday's rally to protest
against the Bakke decision and the Bank of America.
Tnere were TV cameramen, newspaper and University
photographers, and a host of amateurs, including two
Palo Alto Police Department (PAPD) narcotics inves
tigators with cameras.
After the demonstrators left The Farm, they crossed El
Camino Real on University Avenue. As Daily Associate
Editor Dan Fiduccia climbed the embankment to the
Southern Pacific overpass to photograph the approach
ing marchers, he stumbled upon a well-dressed man
busily filming the demonstrators with a home movie
camera from behind a clump of trees. A few yards away,
another man, properly attired in a three-piece suit, sat in
a dirty battered van.
Fiduccia recognized the van as the same one that had
caused some controversy two years ago, when several
persons had claimed that the van had been used for
surveillance purposes when then-President Gerald Ford
spoke on campus. At the time, the Stanford Department
of Public Safety acknowledged that they had such a
vehicle but said it was used to apprehend bicycle and car
thieves, and never for purposes of political surveillance.
After the rally, the Daily contacted Marvin Herrington,
director of the Department of Public Safety. He said that
the van was not being used that day by Stanford officers.
"Our guys were in a Plymouth, butwe do loan the van
out to other law enforcement agencies. It's common
practice with small departments," Herrington said.

Meanwhile a PAPD spokesman said only the "stan
dard units" were used at the demonstration. A special
agent at the Palo Alto office of the FBI also denied any
connection with the incident.
