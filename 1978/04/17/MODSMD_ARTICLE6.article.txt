# Drysdale slate: a moderate stand on issues
## 
### Matt Mettler 
"Our diverse opinions and heterogeneous
backgrounds" and"the way we will attack prob
lems" were cited by the Council of Presidents
slate of George Drysdale, Duncan Evered, Gwyn
Felt and Michael Bush as their important
strengths.
The ASSU Senate voted with no dissention and
a bare quorum in a special meeting Saturday
afternoon to verify the constitutionality of the
Drysdale slate running with only three official
members.
Bush, not originally one of the members of the
slate, will be appointed as the fourth member of
the COP if the slate is elected, Felt said.
The slate said "greater student involvement
and increased graduate-undergraduate interac
tion" is a key to solving problems.
Drysdale said the slate would favor a program
where graduate students advised under
graduates on academics to supplement the pre
sent faculty advising. We would also like to in
stitutionalize peer counseling among under
graduates, Felt said.
"Consistent with the moderate stand of the
slate, we support partial divestment" of stock of
corporations that do business in South Africa,

Bush said.
He said the slate would support taking into
consideration financial realities and divesting of
those corporations that particularly supported
apartheid.
The members of the slate said there is not
enough emphasis on teaching and advising as
opposed to research. The slate would like to see
faculty motivation in these areas improved by
increasing the weight of teaching and advising
criteriain thetenuredecisions, Evered indicated.
Evered said that a major function of the COP is
to contribute to the agenda of the administration
and faculty meetings.
Drysdale said that he thought "new
mechanisms of management could increase the
efficiency of the COP and the ASSU." He said the
COP should supply information to assist stu
dents in becoming involved in campus issues.
Bush said the present COP has discouraged
people and he said he would like to encourage
them.
There is a "need for new student housing
without a doubt," Evered said. Drysdale
explained that in the past, gifts have supported
new housing.
"Funding for any new housing is a big prob

lem," Evered said. Part of the problem is that
"the information gathering methods on student
housing now being used need to be improved,"
Drysdale said. "Present methods are biased."
"Students perceive the overseas program as a
majorasset of the University," Felt said. "Wefeel
that a major concern is not to have the program
cut," she said.
Drysdale said the slate supports the idea of a
Western Culture Requirement. He said they
would lobby the faculty senate for a quality prog
ram.
"Wewould like more student input,
not sure how students feel about increased
academic requirements," Drysdale said.
Evered said they would like to expand student
services offered by the ASSU. As an example, he
cited creation of a graduate student orientation
at the beginning of the school year.
The slate indicated it would like to start a prog
ram of interaction between the Resident As
sociates (RAs) and the COP. We would like to
prepare specific proposals and the minutes of
our meetings for the RAs to pass along to the
students, Drysdale said. We could then get stu
dent feedback through the RAs, he said.

"the information gathering methods on student
housing now being used need to be improved,"
Drysdale said. "Present methods are biased."
"Students perceive the overseas program as a
majorasset of the University," Felt said. "Wefeel
that a major concern is not to have the program
cut," she said.
Drysdale said the slate supports the idea of a
Western Culture Requirement. He said they
would lobby the faculty senate for a quality prog
ram.
"Wewould like more student input,
not sure how students feel about increased
academic requirements," Drysdale said.
Evered said they would like to expand student
services offered by the ASSU. As an example, he
cited creation of a graduate student orientation
at the beginning of the school year.
The slate indicated it would like to start a prog
ram of interaction between the Resident As
sociates (RAs) and the COP. We would like to
prepare specific proposals and the minutes of
our meetings for the RAs to pass along to the
students, Drysdale said. We could then get stu
dent feedback through the RAs, he said.

"Our diverse opinions and heterogeneous
backgrounds" and"the way we will attack prob
lems" were cited by the Council of Presidents
slate of George Drysdale, Duncan Evered, Gwyn
Felt and Michael Bush as their important
strengths.
The ASSU Senate voted with no dissention and
a bare quorum in a special meeting Saturday
afternoon to verify the constitutionality of the
Drysdale slate running with only three official
members.
Bush, not originally one of the members of the
slate, will be appointed as the fourth member of
the COP if the slate is elected, Felt said.
The slate said "greater student involvement
and increased graduate-undergraduate interac
tion" is a key to solving problems.
Drysdale said the slate would favor a program
where graduate students advised under
graduates on academics to supplement the pre
sent faculty advising. We would also like to in
stitutionalize peer counseling among under
graduates, Felt said.
"Consistent with the moderate stand of the
slate, we support partial divestment" of stock of
corporations that do business in South Africa,

Bush said.
He said the slate would support taking into
consideration financial realities and divesting of
those corporations that particularly supported
apartheid.
The members of the slate said there is not
enough emphasis on teaching and advising as
opposed to research. The slate would like to see
faculty motivation in these areas improved by
increasing the weight of teaching and advising
criteriain thetenuredecisions, Evered indicated.
Evered said that a major function of the COP is
to contribute to the agenda of the administration
and faculty meetings.
Drysdale said that he thought "new
mechanisms of management could increase the
efficiency of the COP and the ASSU." He said the
COP should supply information to assist stu
dents in becoming involved in campus issues.
Bush said the present COP has discouraged
people and he said he would like to encourage
them.
There is a "need for new student housing
without a doubt," Evered said. Drysdale
explained that in the past, gifts have supported
new housing.
"Funding for any new housing is a big prob

lem," Evered said. Part of the problem is that
"the information gathering methods on student
housing now being used need to be improved,"
Drysdale said. "Present methods are biased."
"Students perceive the overseas program as a
majorasset of the University," Felt said. "Wefeel
