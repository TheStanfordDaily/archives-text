## Vote Goldenkranz, Petty, Estes, Morimoto for COP 
### 
This Wednesday and Thursday students will
choose one of three slates to be next year's
Council of Presidents. We recommend that
students vote for the slate of Andrew Golden
kranz, Regina Petty, Fred Estes and Mary
Morimoto.
The first strong point we find with the slate
is that all four candidates have the qualifica
tions and experience necessary to be presi
dents of the ASSU. The members bring to the
slate experience with the ASSU and University
committees. The slate is well aware of just
what issues the COP should deal with next
year and it is knowledgeable about them. The
slate's platform is quite realistic.
We also believe that this slate, more than
the two other competing slates, will be able to
provide continuity to the work which this
year's COP has done. Such continuity should
be beneficial to the students.
The "Goldenkranz" slate also correctly per
ceives the amount of time which is needed in
order to be an effective COP. All four mem
bers promise to be here during the summer,
when it is important that the groundwork of
most projects be laid. They also promise to
follow the example of this year's COP and
keep their office's door open for a good por

tion of each work day. And the four members
plan to take a lightened course load during the
year so that they can have enough time for
their duties.
Though the slate is planning to use task
forces to examine some issues, it is not start
ing out with preconceived solutions on these
issues.
We're glad to see the slate has overcome
the stigma of any sort of "left-right" label, for
the slate does a good job of being non
partisan. We won't miss the sort of ideological
battle which has damaged the ASSU in past
elections.
We do have, however, a few points which
we hope the slate will remember if it's elected.
Each member must be as open as possible,
and we expect candor from them all. Most
importantly, we remind them that it takes hard
work and close communication from four
people — and not two or three — to make an
effective and representative COP.
As to the other two slates (Schoenung-
Doctors-Wright-Martinez and Drysdale-
Evered-Felt), we feel that they both lack the
necessary experience and a clear understand
ing of the relevant issues in a COP race.
Vote Goldenkranz-Petty-Estes-Morimoto.
