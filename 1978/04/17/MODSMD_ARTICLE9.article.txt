# Candidates for Senior Class Presidents make statements
## The
						Farmers Breck et al. 
### 
Who knows more about the Farm
than Farmers? No one we know, and
since January we've been plowing
through acres of ideas to provide the
Class of '79 with creative and work
able plans rather than a rehash of the
usual meadow muffins.
Getting plowed, cultivated and
taken to the market for the best price
are among the loftier goals of the av
erage Stanford senior. Our goal is to
meet these needs on both an indi
vidual and collective basis.
Senior Discounts: We'll provide a
quarterly list of places where you'll
get a discount on beer, burgers or
brunch just because you're a senior.
In addition to saving money from
your pocket and the class fund, these
discounts will encourage seniors to
get together outside of class ac
tivities.
Departmental Representatives:
Class representatives in each de
partment will help ease career con
cerns by organizing sherry hours
where seniors could meet the pro
fessor who'll write them a recom
mendation. They'll also publish a
calendar of relevant events, and we'll
be able to keep in touch with off
campus seniors this way.
Commencement Speakers: Every
year there's a battle among schools
for graduation speakers. We'll get
your ideas early, hold a class vote,

and contact the top choices before
anyone else does.
And, and, and ... As for getting
plowed, we'd like to keep the un
beatable traditions (like Zot's and
pre-game keggers) while initiating
some ourselves (a resounding party
in Frost Amphitheater). In addition,
the Alumni Association can do a lot
for the senior class. This includes
throwing phenomenal parties (e.g.
this year's Casino Night) and helping
to publish a senior class directory
and senior yearbook. Keeping close
contact with the Alumni Association
will mean more events for seniors
with minim .train on our budget.
We'll keep you informed of all of
the above with bi-quarterly newslet
ters distributed by representatives in
each house. In turn, these represen
tatives will let us know what you're
thinking.
We haven't just been chewing our
cuds. Though we're planning to sow
a lot of oats next year, all our ideas
and hard work are nothing without
your grass roots support. Please give
us your vote on April 19th or 20th. In
return, we'll give you the kind of
senior year you've always wanted.
Only better.
