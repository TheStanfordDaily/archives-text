# Think clearly about ASSU
## 
### 
Schoenung et al.

We think that the Daily editorial
board is uninformed about what it
will take to make a good ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents. If enough people
turn out at the polls on Wednesday
and Thursday, that turnout will show
that Stanford students make their
choices according to which team
they think will get more done. We
believe that they will support us.
It is well-known that universities
are organized anarchies, and Stan
ford is no exception. The University
committee system is an important
part of the "organized" part, but the
key decisions are usually not the
produc. of that system.
If Stanford students are to be rep
resented, it is going to take a team of
people that are do-ers and know
what is the best and quickest way to
influence University decision mak
ing. And one does not develop these
skills through the University commit
tee system!
It takes an understanding of how
independent groups get things
done, how the residence system
works, as well as how University of

ficialdom works. This is the kind of
experience which our slate can bring
to bear on the challenges facing the
ASSU.
We strongly feel that the lack of
participation by the majority of Stan
ford students is a big problem — and
perhaps one that prevents the ASSU
from doing more, and doing effec
tively what it would like to do.
Rhetoric will not be effective to in
crease participation. Butestablishing
a formal and informal system of per
sonal contacts throughout the stu
dent body can certainly be effective.
This is where the residential system
comes in, both as a formal, institu
tional device and as a group of
people (RAs).
One may ask, "What do you want
people to participate in?" We can
answer this quite simply. First, there
is a great deal that can be improved
here. Second, Stanford students can
and should contribute to that im
provement. We think the role of the
Council of Presidents is to enable
people to think they can change
things, and to act as an institutional

device to make people's efforts ef
fective. This is what we have in mind
when we speak of "participation,"
and we think that our slate is better
equipped to make this happen than
the other two slates.
What should be the issues we act
upon? Although to a large extent all
three slates agree on the issues,
there is the question of priorities. A
slate should not be judged on the
length of their list of concerns, but
on whether their sense of priorities is
more or less consistent with yours.
A year is only so long — so we think
that you should vote this Wednesday
and Thursday for the slate most likely
to get things done, both by them
selves and by involving more people
in the process. And we think that
most Stanford students will choose
us when they look at what is behind
the rhetoric and think clearly about
which team should be representing
the ASSU.

and should contribute to that im
provement. We think the role of the
Council of Presidents is to enable
people to think they can change
things, and to act as an institutional

device to make people's efforts ef
fective. This is what we have in mind
when we speak of "participation,"
and we think that our slate is better
equipped to make this happen than
the other two slates.
What should be the issues we act
upon? Although to a large extent all
three slates agree on the issues,
there is the question of priorities. A
slate should not be judged on the
length of their list of concerns, but
on whether their sense of priorities is
more or less consistent with yours.
A year is only so long — so we think
that you should vote this Wednesday
and Thursday for the slate most likely
to get things done, both by them
selves and by involving more people
in the process. And we think that
most Stanford students will choose
us when they look at what is behind
the rhetoric and think clearly about
which team should be representing
the ASSU.
