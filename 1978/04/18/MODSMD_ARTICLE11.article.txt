Yes on 'withdrawal'
Stanford University should exer
cise its role as a responsible investor
to effect corporate withdrawal from
South Africa by means up to and
including the sale of stock.
This referendum will be on the
ASSU ballot this week. Its purpose is
to clarify student position on corpo
rate withdrawal from South Africa.
While not advocating any specific
tactic, the referendum holds open all
the University's options for effecting
corporate withdrawal.
For 30 years American corpora
tions have expressed confidence that
their presence in South Africa would
have a positive impact on the prac
tice of apartheid. However, Stan
ford's Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR) in its report on
South Africa stated that "American
capital and credit have played a
pivotal role in assisting the South Af
rican government to entrench its
policy of apartheid."
Furthermore, the CIR said that in
the past U.S. corporations have not
been "a particularly progressive
force" and the CIR doubted that sub
stantial improvement would occur in
the future.

Last week the trustees took a posi
tion in favor of non-expansion of
corporations in South Africa. How
ever, they have done nothing to en
courage corporate withdrawal. A
strong demonstration of student
support for such action is necessary.
Steps Stanford might take might
include, but need not be limited to
the following:
— affirmative votes on sharehol
der resolutions calling for with
drawal from South Africa;
— introduction of such sharehol

der resolutions;
— sale of stock.
Campus and community groups
across the nation are calling on U.S.
corporations to halt their operations
in South Africa. Widespread public
pressure can make a difference in
corporate policy. Stanford should
add its voice to this chorus through a
responsible use of its investments.
Vote YES on the referendum.
