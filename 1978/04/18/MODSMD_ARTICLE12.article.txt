# COP slate recommendations made

COP statement
No other structure exists for stu
dents which so subtly, yet persua
sively, changes the quality of educa
tin and life at Stanford as the Council
of Presidents.
Providing input and support to
such varied concerns as recycling,
teaching evaluation, university in
vestments, minority affairs, tuition
increases, academic advising, the
ASSU's financial operations, and
even Aquafollies, the Council of
Presidents is important for all Stu
dents at Stanford.
Consequently, we urge all stu
dents to vote in the upcoming COP
elections on April 19th and 20th. Be
fore voting, however, it is important
that the student body reads the
campaign material of all the slates
and is aware of the differences bet
ween these slates. The election pro
cess is the means through which the
student body expresses its issue
related priorites and its faith in the
various candidate's expertise and
abilities.
Having served on the COP for the
past year, we are uniquely aware of
the problems which our successors
will face. Further, by retrospectively
analyzing our own successes and fai
lures, we understand what is neces
sary for any group of four students to
be an effective COP.
The most important qualification
for an effective COP is experience.
The students you elect to represent
you need to have been centrally in
volved in the issues they plan to deal
with before the election. A slate
should also have the skills and attri
butes necessary for effective com
munication, both orally and in writ
ing. In addition, it is particularly im
portant that a slate can deal with in

dividuals and groups of differing
perspectives.
A candidate's motivation for run
ning is an excellent indicator of how
dedicated and willing to work that
candidate will be. For this reason, we
believe it is very important to ask why
a candidate is running. Specifically,
we believe that only those who are
strongly motivated by a particular set
of issues will have the dedication to
sacrifice a beautiful California sum
mer and over forty hours a week dur
ing the school year to student gov
erment.
The final criteria which we feel is
necessary for the COP is diversity.
The sole advantage to having four
students serve together is that it
promotes better representation of all
students. To have women,
minorities, and graduate students on
the COP is not tokenism, but recog
nition and support of the varied in
terests of the student body.
The current COP race is important
for all students at Stanford. Because
we are uniquely familiar with the
structure of the ASSU and the qual
ities necessary to be an excellent
COP slate, we feel it is important that
we support a COP slate. We under
stand thatourposition may influence
people. We take this position seri
ously, and we do not offer our sup
port lightly.
We have analyzed the current COP
race and the three slates vying to be
successors, and our recommenda
tion is unamimous and strong — the
Goldenkranz/Petty/Estes/Morimoto
slate is the most knowledgable and
experienced slate, and we urge all
students to vote for them.
Only this slate meets what we feel
are the most important qualifications
for an effective COP slate. For each
of the candidates, there is nearly a

direct correspondence between
their past experience and the issues
they promise to work on next year.
Furthermore, their motivation for
running is one of increasing their ef
fectiveness on the issues they are
concerned with.
Finally, the slate is a diverse mix of
individuals with quite varied in
terests. Their platform, which brings
together theirconcerns, is broad and
represents the salient issues for the
next year. Also, the slate is not
locked into the political rhetoric of
either extreme conservatism or
radicalism. They have progressive
solutions to old issues and represent
a wide diversity of opinions.
Aside from the COP race, there are
a number of other ballot issues
which the student body should care
fully consider. We have sponsored a
constitutional amendment which
makes it possible to assess ASSU fees
solely on undergraduates or
graduates depending on whom the
fee assessment supports. This would
alleviate the current inequitable situ
ation in which undergraduates sup
port graduate projects and vice
versa.
Second, there is an amendment to
eliminate the practice of collecting
fee assessments from overseas stu
dents. Most students at overseas
campuses already get all of their re
funds, and the process of collecting
and returning the money is a
bureaucratic nightmare for the
ASSU, the University, and the stu
dents overseas, given the changing
dollar valuations between countries.
We urge 'yes' votes on both of
these amendments.
We feel a 'yes' vote on the
Graduate Student Association is par
ticularly worthwhile. A 'yes' vote will
make it possible for the GSA to

adequately deal with and represent
graduate students next year. Passage
of this assessment is crucial for im
proving the climate for graduates at
Stanford.
We also urge 'yes' votes on all in
itiatives appearing on the ballot. The
ballot questions, on the sexist lan
guage, withdrawal, Androgyny
House, and Western Culture will all
serve as good indicators of student
sentiment for use by both the ASSU
and the university administration.

Council of Presidents
Vote 'Schoenung'
We endorse the Schoenung-
Docters-Wright-Martinez slate for
Council of Presidents.
The Schoenung slate's members
are experienced in a broad cross
section of University affairs: commit
tees, residential education, minority
affairs, and academic programming,
to name a tew. We feel what they
have done, they have done well and
we are impressed by that.
The specific goals that they have
set themselves reflect, we believe,
the most important concerns of the
Stanford community. The ASSU
should play a positive role in improv
ing the quality of education here, by
working on instructor/course evalua
tion and teaching improvement.
Their proposals to approach educa
tional and residential advising
through improvements in the RA sys
tem are important to improving the
academic climate.
The Schoenung slate has realistic
goals for improving student services.
They plan to work to improve the
housing situation at Stanford, in

crease funding for the Off-Campus
Student Center, work to minimize
graduate social isolation, and lobby
for higher priority for non-varsity
users of athletic facilities.
The Schoenung slate has de
monstrated its committment to so
cial and political problems by intelli
gently addressing concerns such as
ecological sensitivity, and women's
and minority affairs.
We believe Suzi Schoenung, Rob
Docters, Kim Wright and Miguel

Martinez will be impartial, rational
representatives of the student body.
We hope everyone will make the ef
fort to vote this week.

ation in which undergraduates sup
port graduate projects and vice
versa.
Second, there is an amendment to
eliminate the practice of collecting
fee assessments from overseas stu
dents. Most students at overseas
campuses already get all of their re
funds, and the process of collecting
and returning the money is a
bureaucratic nightmare for the
ASSU, the University, and the stu
dents overseas, given the changing
dollar valuations between countries.
We urge 'yes' votes on both of
these amendments.
We feel a 'yes' vote on the
Graduate Student Association is par
ticularly worthwhile. A 'yes' vote will
make it possible for the GSA to

adequately deal with and represent
graduate students next year. Passage
of this assessment is crucial for im
proving the climate for graduates at
Stanford.
We also urge 'yes' votes on all in
itiatives appearing on the ballot. The
ballot questions, on the sexist lan
guage, withdrawal, Androgyny
House, and Western Culture will all
serve as good indicators of student
sentiment for use by both the ASSU
and the university administration.

Vote 'Schoenung'
We endorse the Schoenung-
Docters-Wright-Martinez slate for
Council of Presidents.
The Schoenung slate's members
are experienced in a broad cross
section of University affairs: commit
tees, residential education, minority
affairs, and academic programming,
to name a tew. We feel what they
have done, they have done well and
we are impressed by that.
The specific goals that they have
set themselves reflect, we believe,
the most important concerns of the
Stanford community. The ASSU
should play a positive role in improv
ing the quality of education here, by
working on instructor/course evalua
tion and teaching improvement.
Their proposals to approach educa
tional and residential advising
through improvements in the RA sys
tem are important to improving the
academic climate.
The Schoenung slate has realistic
goals for improving student services.
They plan to work to improve the
housing situation at Stanford, in

crease funding for the Off-Campus
Student Center, work to minimize
graduate social isolation, and lobby
for higher priority for non-varsity
users of athletic facilities.
The Schoenung slate has de
monstrated its committment to so
cial and political problems by intelli
gently addressing concerns such as
ecological sensitivity, and women's
and minority affairs.
We believe Suzi Schoenung, Rob
Docters, Kim Wright and Miguel

Martinez will be impartial, rational
representatives of the student body.
We hope everyone will make the ef
fort to vote this week.

COP statement
No other structure exists for stu
dents which so subtly, yet persua
sively, changes the quality of educa
tin and life at Stanford as the Council
of Presidents.
Providing input and support to
such varied concerns as recycling,
teaching evaluation, university in
vestments, minority affairs, tuition
increases, academic advising, the
ASSU's financial operations, and
even Aquafollies, the Council of
Presidents is important for all Stu
dents at Stanford.
Consequently, we urge all stu
dents to vote in the upcoming COP
elections on April 19th and 20th. Be
fore voting, however, it is important
that the student body reads the
campaign material of all the slates
and is aware of the differences bet
ween these slates. The election pro
cess is the means through which the
student body expresses its issue
related priorites and its faith in the
various candidate's expertise and
abilities.
Having served on the COP for the
past year, we are uniquely aware of
the problems which our successors
will face. Further, by retrospectively
analyzing our own successes and fai
lures, we understand what is neces
sary for any group of four students to
be an effective COP.
The most important qualification
for an effective COP is experience.
The students you elect to represent
you need to have been centrally in
volved in the issues they plan to deal
with before the election. A slate
should also have the skills and attri
butes necessary for effective com
munication, both orally and in writ
ing. In addition, it is particularly im
portant that a slate can deal with in

dividuals and groups of differing
perspectives.
A candidate's motivation for run
ning is an excellent indicator of how
dedicated and willing to work that
candidate will be. For this reason, we
believe it is very important to ask why
a candidate is running. Specifically,
we believe that only those who are
strongly motivated by a particular set
of issues will have the dedication to
sacrifice a beautiful California sum
mer and over forty hours a week dur
ing the school year to student gov
erment.
The final criteria which we feel is
necessary for the COP is diversity.
The sole advantage to having four
students serve together is that it
promotes better representation of all
students. To have women,
minorities, and graduate students on
the COP is not tokenism, but recog
nition and support of the varied in
terests of the student body.
The current COP race is important
for all students at Stanford. Because
we are uniquely familiar with the
structure of the ASSU and the qual
ities necessary to be an excellent
COP slate, we feel it is important that
we support a COP slate. We under
stand thatourposition may influence
people. We take this position seri
ously, and we do not offer our sup
port lightly.
We have analyzed the current COP
race and the three slates vying to be
successors, and our recommenda
tion is unamimous and strong — the
Goldenkranz/Petty/Estes/Morimoto
slate is the most knowledgable and
experienced slate, and we urge all
students to vote for them.
Only this slate meets what we feel
are the most important qualifications
for an effective COP slate. For each
of the candidates, there is nearly a

direct correspondence between
their past experience and the issues
they promise to work on next year.
Furthermore, their motivation for
running is one of increasing their ef
fectiveness on the issues they are
concerned with.
Finally, the slate is a diverse mix of
individuals with quite varied in
terests. Their platform, which brings
together theirconcerns, is broad and
represents the salient issues for the
next year. Also, the slate is not
locked into the political rhetoric of
either extreme conservatism or
radicalism. They have progressive
solutions to old issues and represent
a wide diversity of opinions.
Aside from the COP race, there are
a number of other ballot issues
which the student body should care
fully consider. We have sponsored a
constitutional amendment which
makes it possible to assess ASSU fees
solely on undergraduates or
graduates depending on whom the
fee assessment supports. This would
alleviate the current inequitable situ
ation in which undergraduates sup
port graduate projects and vice
versa.
Second, there is an amendment to
eliminate the practice of collecting

volved in the issues they plan to deal
with before the election. A slate
should also have the skills and attri
butes necessary for effective com
munication, both orally and in writ
ing. In addition, it is particularly im
portant that a slate can deal with in

dividuals and groups of differing
perspectives.
A candidate's motivation for run
ning is an excellent indicator of how
dedicated and willing to work that
candidate will be. For this reason, we
believe it is very important to ask why
a candidate is running. Specifically,
we believe that only those who are
strongly motivated by a particular set
of issues will have the dedication to
sacrifice a beautiful California sum
mer and over forty hours a week dur
ing the school year to student gov
erment.
The final criteria which we feel is
necessary for the COP is diversity.
The sole advantage to having four
students serve together is that it
promotes better representation of all
students. To have women,
minorities, and graduate students on
the COP is not tokenism, but recog
nition and support of the varied in
terests of the student body.
The current COP race is important
for all students at Stanford. Because
we are uniquely familiar with the
structure of the ASSU and the qual
ities necessary to be an excellent
COP slate, we feel it is important that
we support a COP slate. We under
stand thatourposition may influence
people. We take this position seri
ously, and we do not offer our sup
port lightly.
We have analyzed the current COP
race and the three slates vying to be
successors, and our recommenda
tion is unamimous and strong — the
Goldenkranz/Petty/Estes/Morimoto
slate is the most knowledgable and
experienced slate, and we urge all
students to vote for them.
Only this slate meets what we feel
are the most important qualifications
for an effective COP slate. For each
of the candidates, there is nearly a

direct correspondence between
their past experience and the issues
they promise to work on next year.
Furthermore, their motivation for
running is one of increasing their ef
fectiveness on the issues they are
concerned with.
Finally, the slate is a diverse mix of
individuals with quite varied in
terests. Their platform, which brings
together theirconcerns, is broad and
represents the salient issues for the
next year. Also, the slate is not
locked into the political rhetoric of
either extreme conservatism or
radicalism. They have progressive
solutions to old issues and represent
a wide diversity of opinions.
Aside from the COP race, there are
a number of other ballot issues
which the student body should care
fully consider. We have sponsored a
constitutional amendment which
makes it possible to assess ASSU fees
solely on undergraduates or
graduates depending on whom the
fee assessment supports. This would
alleviate the current inequitable situ
ation in which undergraduates sup
port graduate projects and vice
versa.
Second, there is an amendment to
eliminate the practice of collecting
fee assessments from overseas stu
dents. Most students at overseas
campuses already get all of their re
funds, and the process of collecting
and returning the money is a
bureaucratic nightmare for the
ASSU, the University, and the stu
dents overseas, given the changing
dollar valuations between countries.
We urge 'yes' votes on both of
these amendments.
We feel a 'yes' vote on the
Graduate Student Association is par
ticularly worthwhile. A 'yes' vote will
make it possible for the GSA to

adequately deal with and represent
graduate students next year. Passage
of this assessment is crucial for im
proving the climate for graduates at
Stanford.
We also urge 'yes' votes on all in
itiatives appearing on the ballot. The
ballot questions, on the sexist lan
guage, withdrawal, Androgyny
House, and Western Culture will all
serve as good indicators of student
sentiment for use by both the ASSU
and the university administration.

Council of Presidents
Vote 'Schoenung'
We endorse the Schoenung-
Docters-Wright-Martinez slate for
Council of Presidents.
The Schoenung slate's members
are experienced in a broad cross
section of University affairs: commit
tees, residential education, minority
affairs, and academic programming,
to name a tew. We feel what they
have done, they have done well and
we are impressed by that.
The specific goals that they have
set themselves reflect, we believe,
the most important concerns of the
Stanford community. The ASSU
should play a positive role in improv
ing the quality of education here, by
working on instructor/course evalua
tion and teaching improvement.
Their proposals to approach educa
tional and residential advising
through improvements in the RA sys
tem are important to improving the
academic climate.
The Schoenung slate has realistic
goals for improving student services.
They plan to work to improve the
housing situation at Stanford, in

crease funding for the Off-Campus
Student Center, work to minimize
graduate social isolation, and lobby
for higher priority for non-varsity
users of athletic facilities.
The Schoenung slate has de
monstrated its committment to so
cial and political problems by intelli
gently addressing concerns such as
ecological sensitivity, and women's
and minority affairs.
We believe Suzi Schoenung, Rob
Docters, Kim Wright and Miguel

Martinez will be impartial, rational
representatives of the student body.
We hope everyone will make the ef
fort to vote this week.

COP statement
No other structure exists for stu
dents which so subtly, yet persua
sively, changes the quality of educa
tin and life at Stanford as the Council
of Presidents.
Providing input and support to
such varied concerns as recycling,
teaching evaluation, university in
vestments, minority affairs, tuition
increases, academic advising, the
ASSU's financial operations, and
even Aquafollies, the Council of
Presidents is important for all Stu
dents at Stanford.
Consequently, we urge all stu
dents to vote in the upcoming COP
elections on April 19th and 20th. Be
fore voting, however, it is important
that the student body reads the
campaign material of all the slates
and is aware of the differences bet
ween these slates. The election pro
cess is the means through which the
student body expresses its issue
related priorites and its faith in the
various candidate's expertise and
abilities.
Having served on the COP for the
past year, we are uniquely aware of
the problems which our successors
will face. Further, by retrospectively
analyzing our own successes and fai
lures, we understand what is neces
sary for any group of four students to
be an effective COP.
The most important qualification
for an effective COP is experience.
