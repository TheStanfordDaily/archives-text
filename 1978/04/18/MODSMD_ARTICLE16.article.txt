## rock/linda powell Garfunkel needs confidence 
### 
"lt'sthe same old song with a
new melody . . . remembering
. . . remembering." Art Gar
funkel eased his way onto the
stage at the Berkeley Commun
ity Theatre last Friday night,
and proceeded to lead the
crowd on a musical journey
spanning 14 years. When all
was over, Garfunkel had
proved beyond any doubt that
he was, and still is, one of the
best singers in the world of pop
music.
For 60 minutes, Garfunkel
charmed the crowd with a
selection of songs from
throughout his career. He
began the set with a tender
version of the old Simon and
Garfunkel ballad, "For Emily,
Wherever I May Find Her." He
followed this with several
songs from his new album,
"Watermark," including
"Hideaway" by Steven Bishop,
and the current Garfunkel-
Simon-Taylor single, "(Oh
What A) Wonderful World."
Garfunkel's expression of
the 1934 melody "I Only Have
Eyes For You" was a highlight
of the show, proving his ver
satility as a performer far
beyond the realm of modern
folk-rock.
1966 debut
Of course Garfunkel
couldn't leave the stage where
he and Paul Simon had made
their Bay Area debut in 1966
without briefly taking us back
to that era. He pleased the
crowd with such old favorites
as "Cecilia," "Scarsbourough
Fair," and finally, his beautiful
vocal rendition of "Bridge
Over Troubled Water."
Then, much too soon, Gar
funkel turned and left the stage
as casually as he had walked
on, leaving the crowd on its
feet, crying for more. Garfun
kel returned, of course, and
obliged with a haunting ver
sion of "The Sounds of Si
lence," an appropriate song to
end the evening.
Garfunkel's vocal style is ex
tremely appealing. His tenor
voice is soft and lulling, relax
ing the listener, yet at the same
time, stirring his deepest emo
tions. This man sings romantic

songs with sincerity and ex
pression that few of his con
tempories can match. Though
plagued with a bad cold, Gar
funkel maintained near
perfect pitch throughout the
concert, and his unusually
clear diction made the lis
tener's job an easy one.
No self-confidence?
As an on-stage performer,
however, Garfunkel seems to
lack self-confidence. Playing
no instruments during the
show, Garfunkel stood awk
wardly at the microphone. His
body was rigid, and his move
ments seemed at times
mechanical. He let his music
communicate to the audience;
he spoke only once.
But more important, he
didn't seem to be having a
good time with his music.
Perhaps this was due to his
cold or due to the fact that Ber

keley was one of the last stops
on his nation-wide tour.
Garfunkel's lack of confi
dence also seemed to affect his
choice of material for presenta
tion. He commented that he
had not gone on tour for the
past seven years because he
had lacked sufficient material
to present in concert. Anyone
who has listened to "Breaka
way" in its entirety knows that
his statement is ludicrous.
Since 1975, many Garfunkel
fans have been waiting for a
concert featuring the songs
from that album. Thus, many
were disappointed when he
sang only two cuts from
"Breakaway" on Friday night.
Powerful back-up
Leah Kunkel, Garfunkel's
back-up vocalist, may well be a
star-on-the-rise. Kunkel's
powerful, earthy voice pro
vided a good balance for Gar

funkel's tenor. Singing har
mony well, Kunkel succeeded
in her own right with "Take to
the Streets," accompanied
only by )ohn )arvis' piano. With
a raspy voice sometimes re
miniscent of Carole King, Kun
kel clearly has the potential to
succeed as a solo artist.
lames Lee Stewart opened
the show with a short set, re
placing |immy Webb, who was
absent due to illness. Stewart's
rather unusual, rowdy songs
provided a good complement
to Garfunkel's romanticism.
With his jokes and an easy
going stage manner, Stewart
quickly established a good
rapport with the audience.
However, he simply talked too
much. Stewart was funny, but
the crowd had come to Ber
keley to hear some good
music.

pression that few of his con
tempories can match. Though
plagued with a bad cold, Gar
funkel maintained near
perfect pitch throughout the
concert, and his unusually
clear diction made the lis
tener's job an easy one.
No self-confidence?
As an on-stage performer,
however, Garfunkel seems to
lack self-confidence. Playing
no instruments during the
show, Garfunkel stood awk
wardly at the microphone. His
body was rigid, and his move
ments seemed at times
mechanical. He let his music
communicate to the audience;
he spoke only once.
But more important, he
didn't seem to be having a
good time with his music.
Perhaps this was due to his
cold or due to the fact that Ber

keley was one of the last stops
on his nation-wide tour.
Garfunkel's lack of confi
dence also seemed to affect his
choice of material for presenta
tion. He commented that he
had not gone on tour for the
past seven years because he
had lacked sufficient material
to present in concert. Anyone
who has listened to "Breaka
way" in its entirety knows that
his statement is ludicrous.
Since 1975, many Garfunkel
fans have been waiting for a
concert featuring the songs
from that album. Thus, many
were disappointed when he
sang only two cuts from
"Breakaway" on Friday night.
Powerful back-up
Leah Kunkel, Garfunkel's
back-up vocalist, may well be a
star-on-the-rise. Kunkel's
powerful, earthy voice pro
vided a good balance for Gar

funkel's tenor. Singing har
mony well, Kunkel succeeded
in her own right with "Take to
the Streets," accompanied
only by )ohn )arvis' piano. With
a raspy voice sometimes re
miniscent of Carole King, Kun
kel clearly has the potential to
succeed as a solo artist.
lames Lee Stewart opened
the show with a short set, re
placing |immy Webb, who was
absent due to illness. Stewart's
rather unusual, rowdy songs
provided a good complement
to Garfunkel's romanticism.
With his jokes and an easy
going stage manner, Stewart
quickly established a good
rapport with the audience.
However, he simply talked too
much. Stewart was funny, but
the crowd had come to Ber
keley to hear some good
music.

Soto House presents "Good News," a musical comedy treatment of Big Game Week at a small
college during the 19205, Wednesday through Saturday at 8 p.m. in the Soto dining room, Wilbur
Hall. The Broadway classic features such numbers as "Button Up Your Overcoat" and"The Varsity
Drag." Admission is free.
"lt'sthe same old song with a
new melody . . . remembering
. . . remembering." Art Gar
funkel eased his way onto the
stage at the Berkeley Commun
ity Theatre last Friday night,
and proceeded to lead the
crowd on a musical journey
spanning 14 years. When all
was over, Garfunkel had
proved beyond any doubt that
he was, and still is, one of the
best singers in the world of pop
music.
For 60 minutes, Garfunkel
charmed the crowd with a
selection of songs from
throughout his career. He
began the set with a tender
version of the old Simon and
Garfunkel ballad, "For Emily,
Wherever I May Find Her." He
followed this with several
songs from his new album,
"Watermark," including
"Hideaway" by Steven Bishop,
and the current Garfunkel-
Simon-Taylor single, "(Oh
What A) Wonderful World."
Garfunkel's expression of
the 1934 melody "I Only Have
Eyes For You" was a highlight
of the show, proving his ver
satility as a performer far
beyond the realm of modern
folk-rock.
1966 debut
Of course Garfunkel
couldn't leave the stage where
he and Paul Simon had made
their Bay Area debut in 1966
without briefly taking us back
to that era. He pleased the
crowd with such old favorites
as "Cecilia," "Scarsbourough
Fair," and finally, his beautiful
vocal rendition of "Bridge
Over Troubled Water."
Then, much too soon, Gar
funkel turned and left the stage
as casually as he had walked
on, leaving the crowd on its
feet, crying for more. Garfun
kel returned, of course, and
obliged with a haunting ver
sion of "The Sounds of Si
lence," an appropriate song to
end the evening.
Garfunkel's vocal style is ex
tremely appealing. His tenor
voice is soft and lulling, relax
ing the listener, yet at the same
time, stirring his deepest emo
tions. This man sings romantic

songs with sincerity and ex
pression that few of his con
tempories can match. Though
plagued with a bad cold, Gar
funkel maintained near
perfect pitch throughout the
concert, and his unusually
clear diction made the lis
tener's job an easy one.
