## Branner's 'Godspell' shines 
### 
Branner Hall's recent pro
duction of the play "Godspell"
provides a superb example of
what a hit really is. Even with a
myriad of difficulties and al
most total lack of experience,
this group of freshpersons
have created the precedent of
making their first entry into
theateran unqualified success.
The gospel of "Godspell" itself
is based loosely upon the Book
of Matthew from the St. James
version of the Bible. It involves
the many lessons taught the
disciples by the speaker of par
ables.
The unbelievable costumes
of Edith Latete were a fantastic
collage of color and style, al
ways enhancing and never in
hibiting the performers. The
orchestration was something
special in itself and would

merit attention even if the play
was discarded. Makeup, per
manent setting and some stag
ing follow the movie version in
general. In locating the pro
duction in the'Branner Dining
Hall, Director Lise Rehberg
gave her cast the necessary
space for the free-flowing
movements of the play, but at
the same time condemned the
cast to performing amidst the
aroma of old vegetables and in
an acoustical deathtrap. Even
using a flower microphone to
amplify their voices did not
prevent much of the dialogue/
lyrics from being swallowed
up.
A special delight to an old
drama critic is to see a play
where each single performer
voluntarily works with each
other, even when the focus of
the scene isn't on them. This

kind of cooperation is found in
only the greatly seasoned or
the freshly friendly. It provides
a never-ending stream of in
terest to an audience when
there is so much happening
above and beyond the mere
script.
Highpoints in the musical
were the solos in the songs
"Day By Day," "Bless the Lord"
and"I Really Want To Thank
the Lord." Also the duo (with
guitar) in "By Your Side" was
very well received. Choreog
raphy remained at a high level
throughout all the numbers,
with the best done by the sub
group in "We Beseech Thee."
May Branner continue it as a
new tradition and so become a
rival of Toyon, Larkin and Ro
ble. Onwards and upwards to
the cast and crew.
