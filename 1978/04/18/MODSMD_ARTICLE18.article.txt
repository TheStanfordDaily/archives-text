### 
The Grupo Moncada, one
of Cuba's most popular and
evocative musical groups, will
perform for Bay Area audi

here next week.
The group's performance
will provide a real opportunity

the new Cuban song move
ment, the "Nueva Trova."
Grupo Moncada consists of
eight musicians whose music
ranges from Latin American
protest songs to traditional and

Cuba, and in the past three
years has emerged as one of
Cuba's foremost talents.
The performers set out to
popularize the folk music of
Latin America with special em
phasis on Cuba, and worked
together to define certain mus
ical concepts. They became in

creasingly aware of the poten
tial of music to be an instru
ment of revolutionary change.
Their music reflects the
group's sense of intellectual
and political responsibility as it
chronicles the promise and
problems of the new Cuba and
the development of a new
Cuban identity.
Grupo Moncada has de
veloped a wide repertoire
which now includes songs
based on slave chants, inter

lar to those the slaves in Cuba
had as drums, as well as

rhythms and sounds typical of

varieties, like the Andean
charango guitar and the quena
flute, when interpreting music
of other nationalities.
They will appear tonight in

and can be purchased at Tre
sidder Box Office. The event is
