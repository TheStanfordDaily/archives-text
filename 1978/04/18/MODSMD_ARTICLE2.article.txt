# Davis: 'emerging racism' in America threatens all
## 
### Gary Furlong 
Political activist Angela Davis
spoke of the dangers of "a new ra
cism that is emerging" in America,
yesterday at a noon rally in White
Plaza.
Davis, a one-time guest professor
at Stanford who is currently teaching
at San Francisco State University de
livered a keynote address to a crowd
of more than 700 to begin the SOC
sponsored Disorientation Week.
"We are presently at the most
dangerous juncture in the history of
this country," Davis said. "What is
happening is that a new form of ra
cism is emerging, and that racism is
being directed against us all."
The new racism is a conspiracy by
all the leading capitalists and pow
erholders in this country to try and
convince everyone that racism does
not exist anymore, according to
Davis.
"This is the new racism . . . the

illusion that racism has been over
come. And it is an illusion. We are
further from freedom in 1978 than we
were in 1968," Davis said.
Davis also spoke of a conspiracy to
convince the people that there "is no
movement for justice, no movement
for freedom" left in America.
"The movement is certainly not
dead, sisters and brothers," she ad
ded. "We have to be very conscious
and very vigilant of the efforts un
derway to totally distort our percep
tions of reality."
Even the popular TV drama
"Roots" was part of this conspiracy,
she said. According to Davis, the en
ding of the series, in which a black
family finally reaches "the promised
land," was meant to show Americans
that racial repression is over.
'Roots'
"And that program, 'Roots,' sup
ports the logic of the Bakke deci
sion," Davis said. "Because if black

people are free and equal, then ob
viously any affirmative action prog
ram is discriminative against those
we are supposed to be equal with,
the white people. It's all part of the
conspiracy."
Davis said the country may even be
heading toward facism.
"A lot of us have been talking
about the potential for fascism in this
country. I think it's truer now than
ever before," she said.
Davis ended her speech with her
hopes that there will be more
minorities and working class stu
dents in the incoming freshman
class.
