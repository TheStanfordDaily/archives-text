Record volume on stock market
New York — The stock market, riding the crest of
a powerful rally, rolled up another sharp gain yes
terday in trading that outstripped the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) volume record set Friday
by more than 10 million shares.
NYSE trading volume reached 63.51 million
shares for the day against Friday's total of 52.28
million, which itself had been considered a re
markable amount.
Before Friday the busiest day in exchange his
tory had amounted t044.51 million shares, on Feb.
20, 1976.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
had risen almost 9 points last Thursday and 19.92
on Friday, climbed another 14.99 to 810.12.
Analysts said the upsurge that began last week
tended to feed on itself in early trading, attracting
additional buying by investors anxious not to miss
out on any further market gains.
The rally has been attributed in large measure to
frenetic buying by investing institutions who had
built up massive reserves of cash.
Panama compromise accepted
Washington — Panama and a key senator say

they will accept a compromise definition of U.S.
intervention rights in Panama, boosting prospects
for final Senate ratification of the canal treaties
today.
Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) agreed yester
day to a compromise on the issue of whether the
United States could take any action to keep the
canal open in the future.
The compromise provision does not limit this
right, but does "reaffirm" the U.S. policy against
intervention in the internal affairs of foreign coun
tries, DeConcini said,
Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) indi
cated earlier that the language was acceptable to
the Panamanian government. Fie said Panamanian
Ambassador Gabriel Lewis called it "a dignified
solution to a difficult problem."
Joint nuclear mission revealed
New Delhi, India — Prime Minister Morarji Desai
revealed yesterday that a secret mountaineering
mission to plant nuclear-powered monitoring de
vices on the Flimalaya high peaks was a joint oper
ation of the U.S. and Indian governments.
FHe also told Parliament that one nuclear fuel
pack lost in the mountains 13 years ago poses little
danger of radiation poisoning.
Desai's disclosures about the operation — de
signed to monitor Chinese nuclear arms de
velopment— defused a potential crisis in relations
between India and the United States.
The 82-year-old prime minister confirmed the
general outline of the first public report on the
mission, in a U.S. magazine last week, but he dis
puted the magazine's assertion that the CIA
mounted the expeditions in the mid-1960s with the
cooperation of Indian intelligence agents but
without the Indian government's knowledge.
Germany fears Nazi era show
Bonn, West Germany — The West German gov

ernment, sensitive of its image abroad, finds the
television film "Holocaust" and other portrayals of
the Nazi era deeply embarrassing. But officials
realize they can do little about them except try to
stem any anti-German tide.
The influential liberal West German news
magazine Der Spiegel said West Germany dip
lomats in the United States feared the series might
lead to "a new anti-German wave" among Ameri
cans influenced by the film.
Government sources told The Associated Press
that information officers at West German embas
sies in Washington and elsewhere were briefed on
how to respond to questions that may arise from
the four episodes.
