# Consul defends trade surplus
## Japan's economy: 'downward spiral' 
### Scott Hickman 
Japan's economy is in a "vicious
downward spiral" and that nation's
huge trade surplus only "gives the
illusion of prosperity," Japanese
Consul General Tomio Tsutsumi said
in a speech here Friday.
He said the continuation of a large
deficit in the U.S. trade balance
could mean further depreciation of
the dollar. "If there is no effort to
curtail the vicious spiral, thefutureof
the world economy including Japan
will only deteriorate," he said.
Tsutsumi said the United States
and Japan "must cooperate econom
ically and politically with each other
to develop the Free World." But "our
two economies cannot help compet
ing with each other as the structure
of our two industries are getting
more similar."
'Information gap'
In the speech, sponsored by the
Asian Business Students Association,
Tsutsumi spoke of an "information
gap" between the United States and
Japan. He used recent U.S. reports of
large dolphin kills off the coast of
Japan as an example. Tsutsumi said
the dolphins threatened the liveli
hood of the local fishermen and that
the killing of the dolphins was only
done as a "last resort."
Referring to Japan's imports from
the United States, he denied the al
legation that Japan has a closed mar
ket. He said Japan has "the freest
market for the manufactured goods
among the major industrialized
countries."
He attributed the lack of increase
in U.S. exports to "the American
businessman's lack of 'export
mind,' " which he described as "in
sufficient market research and lack
of willingness to adopt their pro
ducts to the special requirements of
the Japanese market."
Tsutsumi said Japan is "the world's

best customer of U.S. agriculture"
and has "almost given up our agricul
tural sovereignty to the U.S." as an
example of japan's open market.
Liberal measures
He also spoke of Japan's expressed
readiness to take various liberal mea
sures including removal of quota
control on agricultural products and
drastic increases on import quotas
on other items.
In response to claims that Japanese
exports are hurting the U.S. steel in
dustry, Tsutsumi expressed regret
over recent shutdowns. However, he
said that many U.S. industries are an
tiquated and that unless efforts are
made to modernize them, the prob
lem will grow worse.
