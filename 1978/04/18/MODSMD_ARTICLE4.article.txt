# Six slates vie for senior class presidents
## 
### Jonathan Slater 
The junior class will choose from among six
slates vying for senior class president positions
tomorrow and Thursday.
Platform statements circulated by the various
slates show that many of their issues and view
points are similar. Thus voters will probably have
to base their decision on other factors, including
experience, enthusiasm, imagination and even
humor.
The "Farmers" slate of Amy Breck, Lewis Butler,
Leslie Crozierand Tony Peet cite their imagination
as a major factor in their ability to come up with
"creative and workable plans."
Some of their plans include starting senior dis
counts at participating food and entertainment es
tablishments, and sherry hours with department
representatives. They also favor a senior class
newsletter to "help keep off-campus seniors in
touch."
Members said they will begin early trying to find
a "top choice" commencement speaker as well as
continuing traditional senior class activities.
The "Farmers" said they "don't think that it (the
election) should be a popularity contest," adding
that the junior class will "be facing a few issues that
concern themselves."

Candidate Norman Fill, running alone because
he "did not have the time to pull together the
diversities of a slate," proposes organization as a
fundamental duty of the senior class presidents.
Fill said he wants to "rely on the talents of the
senior class" by working as "an organizer who
would pull people together" to achieve "more of a
reflection of the senior class as a whole."
The availability of class trips, a newsletter and a
24-hour call-in line have also been proposed by
Fill, as means to communicate with class mem
bers.
If elected, Fill said he will appoint two or three
people to serve with him as presidents.
The slate composed of Jeff Wachtel, Larry
Broussard, Marshall Payne and Donna Tepe point
to their diversity as the factor which distinguishes
them from the other slates.
Noting that the slate is comprised of a WASP, a
Jew, a black and a woman, they said they feel that
they can best represent the interests of the senior
class as a whole.
Wachtel slate members said they do not see
unity as particularly significant. "Unity is impor
tant, if that's what the class wants. But I don't think
you want to be pushed to unity," said Wachtel. "In
a way there is something to be said for having

different people â€” people who can involve other
people," he said.
The Wachtel slate has plans for Thursday night
Oasis parties, a senior lecture series, a senior trip
raffle and an off-campus housing guide to be sent
to seniors during the summer. They would like to
see Woody Allen as next year's commencement
speaker.
The W.E.S.T. slate of Aileen Webb, Karen
Eggerman, Cedric Smith and Michael Thurman
also stresses its diversity.
"The four of us are very different and have lots
of good ideas and imagination," said Eggerman.
One of these ideas is to "recognize people be
cause it's their last year" by means of sponsoring
exhibitions and perhaps a biweekly Daily column,
they said.
Eggerman said she sees the role of the senior
class presidents to act "as representatives of the
senior class in part, and also represent all other
students, because we have an idea of what it's like
to live at Stanford."
The W.E.S.T. slate said they want to involve the
class "by organizing things and implementing
ideas" including football tailgaters, a Napa trip, a
boat dance, a newsletter and even a senior class
