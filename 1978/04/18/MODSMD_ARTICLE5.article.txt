# Council of Presidents slates offer views, present platforms
## Goldenkranz et al. run on experience 
### Matt Mettler 
Experience with the ASSU and
University committees, a detailed
knowledge of specific issues and a
willingness to make a large time
commitment are the main strengths
of the ASSU Council of Presidents
slate of Andrew Goldenkranz, Re
gina Petty, Fred Estes and Mary
Morimoto, slate members said Sun
day.
In addition to managing ASSU ser
vices, the COP's responsibilities in
clude "supplying information to stu
dents, setting up forums and meet
ings to discuss issues," and "guiding
discussion and reaction," slate
members said.
Goldenkranz said that "for a re
search institution like Stanford, giv
ing equal weight to research and
teaching is unrealistic because re
search supplies more of the money."
But "we would like to see teaching

performance evaluations in
stitutionalized into the tenure de
cisionmaking process," he said.
Advising 'failure'
The slate's platform states that
"academic advising at Stanford is a
failure." Petty said the slate would
work to "expand present and create
new peer advising programs." Advis
ing is part of the teaching function
and "needs to be more significant in
tenure making decisions," she said.
Estes said that only "a few schools
have a good advising system. We
would like to get in touch with them
and discuss what they do so that we
could learn their methods."
Slate members said that "U.S. cor
porate withdrawal is a desirable
method of helping to achieve an end
to apartheid." However, Estes said
"there is an important difference be
tween corporate withdrawal and di
vestment."

The slate supports further "educa
tion activities that seek to promote
meaningful dialogue concerning
South Africa."
Supports Disorientation
The slate supports Disorientation
Week, but Estes said he had "grave
reservations" about the original
$1700 proposed contribution from
the ASSU Senate's discretionary
fund. He said he was concerned
"about one group (SOC) of a narrow
viewpoint spending that much of the
students' money."
The slate said more on-campus
housing is needed and that it would
work with the committee currently
studying housing needs.
Estes said the shortage of graduate
student housing is particularly acute.
The parcel of land along Willow Road
which the University is already com
mitted to develop for housing should
be built so that it can accommodate
faculty, staff and graduate students,
he said.
In this way, the University can be
sure of filling the new housing
spaces, he added.
The slate indicated that sororities
should be allowed to return to cam
pus if women are interested, in order
to equalize options for men and wo
men.
The slate platform also stated that
"the overriding need of Stanford
graduate students is for a viable
Graduate Student Association" to
deal with graduate students' special
concerns.
No input
Turning to the Western Culture
Requirement, Estes said that they
have had no input on what students
think about reinstating such a re
quirement.
"We would favor a well-structured
requirement but quality is critical,"
Petty said. Morimoto said that cul
tures outside Western Europe
should also be considered in plan
ning courses to fulfill culture re
quirements.
Estes said "you have to be aware of
fads in University curricula. A few
years ago, eliminating requirements
was popular. Now creating them is
coming back," he said.
'You have to consider curricula
changes carefully," he said.
