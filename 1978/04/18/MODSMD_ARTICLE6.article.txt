# Schoenung et al. seek involvement

### Matt Mettler 
Members of the Schoenung slate
see the main role of the ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents (COP) to "synth
esize views of students and to get
people involved in campus problems
directly involved in the solution of
those problems," said slate member
Miguel Martinez.
The slate's four members are Mar
tinez, Suzi Schoenung, Rob Docters
and Kim Wright.
"The last COP did a lot of
groundwork," Docters said, "but
they had a tendency to try to do it all
themselves, resulting in little ac
tion," he added. "They delegated
work poorly."
Continue current work
Schoenung said they would like to
continue much of the current COP's
work and bring more of it to a con
clusion.
Slate members said they are in
terested in both graduate and un
dergraduate concerns. Schoenung
said "both graduates and under
graduates are unhappy with bad
teaching."
The slate supports specific prop
osals of a 1976 ASSU Task Force on
Tenure and Teaching which recom
mended "retrospective surveys of
courses conducted among seniors
and recent alumni" and "increased
information gathering on the teach
ing abilities of potential staff before
hiring."
Docters said the emphasis of the
University "is too heavily weighted
toward research." The slate would
like to increase information
gathering on teaching ability so that
students could make more informed
choices of professors, he said.
"If professors and teaching assis
tants (TAs) see more interest in teach
ing ability, they will put more em
phasis there," Wright said.
Against divestment
The slate indicated it was against
divestiture of stock of companies
doing business in South Africa. Mar
tinez said "it is a very emotional is
sue. People don't have enough in
formation on what is happening."
The role of the COP on this issue
would be to increase information to
students so that they could reach in
formed decisions, the slate said.

Docters said the slate approves of a
Western Culture Requirement, pro
vided good courses are created. The
slate said it would be against any re
quired "economy model" course.
"Students should not have to pay for
additional restrictions," Docters
said.
"Lack of proper advising ties in
with the desire for stricter course re
quirements" and more structure in
student academic programs, Wright
said. She also said she would like to
see house associates (RAs) trained as
academic advisers in addition to their
present duties.
The slate members indicated that
they would like to see more student
housing on campus. They would like
to see an ASSU task force determine
whether or not more student hous
ing spaces would be filled.
Sororities
The slate indicated no position on
the return of sororities to campus. "I
would not like to live in a fraternity,
but if fraternities and sororities sue

ceed because people want to live in
them, fine," Martinez said.
The slate indicated that the Off-
Campus Student Center and the
Teaching Improvement Center
should have a higher priority. They
would also like to see an orientation
week for graduate students coming
to Stanford for the first time.
The slate said that it sees the COP
members as "delegates" rather than
as "executives." Wright said "our job
would be to initiate, motivate and get
the ball rolling" toward solution of
campus problems.
The members of the COP "lack the
specialization of knowledge" to do
everything themselves, Docters said.
"We would like to initiate commit
tees to solve particular problems,
drawing on the expertise of many
members of the Stanford commun
ity," Docters said.

Members of the Schoenung slate
see the main role of the ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents (COP) to "synth
esize views of students and to get
people involved in campus problems
directly involved in the solution of
those problems," said slate member
Miguel Martinez.
The slate's four members are Mar
tinez, Suzi Schoenung, Rob Docters
and Kim Wright.
"The last COP did a lot of
groundwork," Docters said, "but
they had a tendency to try to do it all
themselves, resulting in little ac
tion," he added. "They delegated
work poorly."
Continue current work
Schoenung said they would like to
continue much of the current COP's
work and bring more of it to a con
clusion.
Slate members said they are in
terested in both graduate and un
dergraduate concerns. Schoenung
said "both graduates and under
graduates are unhappy with bad
teaching."
The slate supports specific prop
osals of a 1976 ASSU Task Force on
Tenure and Teaching which recom
mended "retrospective surveys of
courses conducted among seniors
and recent alumni" and "increased
information gathering on the teach
ing abilities of potential staff before
hiring."
Docters said the emphasis of the
University "is too heavily weighted
toward research." The slate would
like to increase information
gathering on teaching ability so that
students could make more informed
choices of professors, he said.
"If professors and teaching assis
tants (TAs) see more interest in teach
ing ability, they will put more em
phasis there," Wright said.
Against divestment
The slate indicated it was against
divestiture of stock of companies
doing business in South Africa. Mar
tinez said "it is a very emotional is
sue. People don't have enough in
formation on what is happening."
The role of the COP on this issue
would be to increase information to
students so that they could reach in
formed decisions, the slate said.

Docters said the slate approves of a
Western Culture Requirement, pro
vided good courses are created. The
slate said it would be against any re
quired "economy model" course.
"Students should not have to pay for
additional restrictions," Docters
said.
"Lack of proper advising ties in
with the desire for stricter course re
quirements" and more structure in
student academic programs, Wright
said. She also said she would like to
see house associates (RAs) trained as
academic advisers in addition to their
present duties.
The slate members indicated that
they would like to see more student
housing on campus. They would like
to see an ASSU task force determine
whether or not more student hous
ing spaces would be filled.
Sororities
The slate indicated no position on
the return of sororities to campus. "I
would not like to live in a fraternity,
but if fraternities and sororities sue

ceed because people want to live in
them, fine," Martinez said.
The slate indicated that the Off-
Campus Student Center and the
Teaching Improvement Center
should have a higher priority. They
would also like to see an orientation
week for graduate students coming
to Stanford for the first time.
The slate said that it sees the COP
members as "delegates" rather than
as "executives." Wright said "our job
would be to initiate, motivate and get
the ball rolling" toward solution of
campus problems.
The members of the COP "lack the
specialization of knowledge" to do
everything themselves, Docters said.
"We would like to initiate commit
tees to solve particular problems,
drawing on the expertise of many
members of the Stanford commun
ity," Docters said.
