## Assessments, amendments 
### 
Fee Assessments
We make the following recommendations
in regard to the 11 fee assessments which will
be on the ballot. Students should bear in mind
that unless 20% per cent of the students vote
in the election, no fee assessment can win. A
simple majority of at least 20 per cent of the
ASSU is needed to approve an assessment. All
fee assessments are refundable.
ASSU Publications Board, ASSU Speakers
Bureau, Academic Organizations Board,
Graduate Student Association, Stanford Com
mittee on Political Education (SCOPE) — Yes.
All of these groups are asking for $1, Au
tumn quarter fee assessment.
We wholeheartedly endorse the Publica
tions Board's request. The board last asked for
an assessment three years ago, and since then
the board has carefully used the money to
finance a host of campus publications, except
the Quad and the Daily. The money will be
used over the next few years toassist in financ
ing many publications which bring diversity of
viewpoint to the campus.
We hope students will vote for the Speakers
Bureau. This year the bureau has brought
speakers such as CIA Director Stansfield
Turner and economist Milton Friedman to
campus, and has also helped to finance vari
ous discussion panels in conjunction with
other groups.
The Academic Organizations Board request
will fund several organizations connected in
some way with academic activities.
We also believe the Graduate Students As
sociation deserves its funding request.
Should both this and a proposed constitu
tional amendment pass, this assessment
would be levied against only graduates.
We believe that SCOPE should be
granted its first fee assessment request.
SCOPE assisted in bringing journalist Ben
Bradlee to campus and it has also organized
debates on the Panama Canal treaties and
human rights. With this fee assessment,
SCOPE will no longer be dependent on others
for funding and should be able to prove
whether it is a viable organization.
Stanford Band, Program Fee — Yes
The Stanford Band and the Program Fee are
on the Ballot for a $1, Autumn and Winter
quarters fee assessment.
The Band will use its money for a trip to the
Midwest in the fall and a trip to Seattle in the
winter. The Band has promised that it will save
the money budgeted for the Midwest trip
should plans for that trip fall through. We're
sure the Band will take the proper action to
preserve the $11,000 allocated for the fall trip
should it not occur.
The ASSU Senate has allocated the program
fee's money to go to a wide variety of student
organizations, and so we hope students will
approve this assessment request.
ASSU Legal Counseling Office, KZSU, Daily —
Yes
These requests are all for a $1, Autumn,
Winter and Spring quarters assessment.
The LCO provides legal advice to students
on problems ranging from traffic violations to
landlord-tenant controversies, and can save
students from unnecessary hassle and ex
pense for a very modest cost.
KZSU's fee assessment will provide the
radio station with virtually all of its funding.
Since it is a non-commericial educational sta
tion, it can not accept advertising. KZSU pro
vides interesting programs along with a good
mix of news and sports, and the station will
soon increase its reception area when a power
increase goes into effect. The assessment will
run the station, cover the costs of the power
increase, and build up the station's pitifully
low reserve fund.
This is the fourth consecutive year in which
the Daily is asking for a $1, three-quarter fee
assessment. With this appreciated support,
we have been able to insure the Daily's finan
cial security and legal independence. We are
asking for this fee assessment so that we may
purchase computerized editing equipment.
Besides allowing us to put out a better pro
duct, this equipment will help to educate stu
dents about journalism, in accordance with
the purposes of our corporate charter.
Finally, we don't think a subscription of two
cents per issue is unreasonable, especially in
light of what people pay for another morning
newspaper.
ASSU Guest Professorship Board — No En
dorsement
We are unable to recommend how students
should vote on this $1, Autumn quarter as
sessment, but we hope voters will be mindful
of the following arguments. The board's
choice of guest professors must be approved
by the ASSU Senate, and so the board's selec
tion is limited by the fact that the senate has
usually been controlled by progressive-left
students who do not wish to invite those with
other political views to teach here. Also, many
persons — particularly conservatives — ask
for fees which the board cannot possibly pro
vide. Thus, guest professors have invariably
been of the leftist-radical persuasion.
However, the average number of enrolled
students in a guest professor's course is about
30. Furthermore, every year a different board
admits there were problems this year but says
things will be different next year. Students
should consider whether to continue funding
such a program.

Constitutional Amendments
A two-thirds majority of those voting is
necessary to amend the Constitution.
Separate Assessment Levying — Yes
This change will apply only to fee assess
ments which fund programs and groups for
either undergraduates or graduates.
The amendment would not
apply to assessments for organizations which
support both constituencies. The amendment
would also permit graduates to pass such an
assessment with only 10 per cent of the
graduates voting. Since the lowered number
of required voters would apply to assessments
which affect solely graduates and since few
graduates vote, we recommend a yes vote.
Overseas Assessment — Yes
Currently students who attend an overseas
campus must go through bureaucratic proce
dures in order to get their fee assessment re
funds. Virtually all overseas students do re
quest such refunds, and since this amend
ment would not appreciably decrease the in
come to groups funded by assesment, we
hope students here will make life easier for
those who go overseas.
Financial Audit — No
This proposal would mandate that groups
seeking to put a fee assessment on the ballot
through petitions present financial estimates
and audits to the senate and financial man
ager. Though it resembles a by-laws section,
it'sa bad proposal and should be voted down.
Thisamendment would burden groupswho
wish to appeal to the students for their signa
tures in order to secure a place on the ballot.
The Constitution clearly was written with the
intent that students could bypass and override
the senate if they so chose (see the sections on
initiative, referendum and recall) yet the se
nate wishes to make the process more cum
bersome and bring it under its own wing.
If students want to place an assessment on
the ballot without examining that group's fi
nances, that is — and should remain — their
right. Also, the amendment has no provision
for enforcement; the by-laws at least delegate
enforcementto the financial manager. Finally,
groups which seek money from funds under
the senate's control can be exempted under
this amendment from providing an audit, but
groups which seek funds that are under the
students' control can not be exempted from
that requirement.
By the way, for those who would allege that
this recommendation is made from purely
personal motives, it should be noted that the
Daily will continue to provide financial infor
mation about itself to the University and such
information is open for inspection at the Dai
ly's offices.
Sexist wording — Yes
Three years ago we endorsed a similar
proposal to change the wording of the Con
stitution to he or she, his/her and him/her
rather than only using the masculine forms of
the pronoun. The amendment failed because
the yes votes fell short of the needed two
thirds majority; we hope it passes this time.
Referenda
Withdrawal — Yes
We urge students to vote yes on this re
ferendum, and demonstrate their belief to the
trustees and others that American business
should withdraw from South Africa. Though
the referendum says that Stanford should ef
fect withdrawal "by means up to and includ
ing the sale of stock/' members of the Stan
ford Committee for a Responsible Investment
Policy have assured us that the results of this
referendum will not be used in any campaign
for divestment. They say withdrawal can be
accomplished through many means, includ
ing divestment, and the referendum will only
be used to show how students stand on with
drawal.
deßeauvoir (Androgyny) House — No
This proposal calls for the creation of a
committee to reconsider the decision, and the
process by which it was reached, to terminate
the deßeauvoir House.
We feel students should vote no for two
reasons. Even with a review of the decision,
we feel that such a committee would also
reach a decision to terminate this theme
house. The Office of Residential Education
used valid criteria to evaluate and end the
theme house. Furthermore, since the house
has already been designated to become the
German Studies House, it would be unfair to
students who draw into the house to find their
program cancelled.
However, we do hope the Housing Office
will decide that in the future, no theme house
may be terminated without a two-year trial
period, and that decisions to end a program
must be made early enough so as to allow for
an appeal before the draw commences.
Present residence priorities — Continue
The worst inequities of the draw have been
corrected, and all students are now covered
by the Guaranteed Housing plan, so these
priorities should be continued.
Western Culture — No
We have editorialized twice against the
proposed requirement, and we hope students
will join with us in expressing their displea
sure on this matter. However, since the re
quirement will probably be reinstated any
way, we recommend that students opt for the
model proposed by the Western Culture Task
Force.
Fee Assessments
We make the following recommendations
in regard to the 11 fee assessments which will
be on the ballot. Students should bear in mind

ASSU Publications Board, ASSU Speakers
Bureau, Academic Organizations Board,
Graduate Student Association, Stanford Com

All of these groups are asking for $1, Au

We wholeheartedly endorse the Publica

the board has carefully used the money to
finance a host of campus publications, except
the Quad and the Daily. The money will be

SCOPE assisted in bringing journalist Ben

debates on the Panama Canal treaties and

SCOPE will no longer be dependent on others
for funding and should be able to prove
whether it is a viable organization.
Stanford Band, Program Fee — Yes
The Stanford Band and the Program Fee are

The Band will use its money for a trip to the

Winter and Spring quarters assessment.
The LCO provides legal advice to students
on problems ranging from traffic violations to
landlord-tenant controversies, and can save
students from unnecessary hassle and ex

KZSU's fee assessment will provide the
radio station with virtually all of its funding.
Since it is a non-commericial educational sta
tion, it can not accept advertising. KZSU pro
vides interesting programs along with a good
mix of news and sports, and the station will
soon increase its reception area when a power
increase goes into effect. The assessment will
run the station, cover the costs of the power
increase, and build up the station's pitifully
low reserve fund.
This is the fourth consecutive year in which
the Daily is asking for a $1, three-quarter fee
assessment. With this appreciated support,
we have been able to insure the Daily's finan
cial security and legal independence. We are
asking for this fee assessment so that we may
purchase computerized editing equipment.
Besides allowing us to put out a better pro
duct, this equipment will help to educate stu
dents about journalism, in accordance with

Finally, we don't think a subscription of two

ASSU Guest Professorship Board — No En
dorsement
We are unable to recommend how students
should vote on this $1, Autumn quarter as
sessment, but we hope voters will be mindful
of the following arguments. The board's
choice of guest professors must be approved
by the ASSU Senate, and so the board's selec
tion is limited by the fact that the senate has
usually been controlled by progressive-left
students who do not wish to invite those with
other political views to teach here. Also, many
persons — particularly conservatives — ask
for fees which the board cannot possibly pro
vide. Thus, guest professors have invariably
been of the leftist-radical persuasion.
However, the average number of enrolled
students in a guest professor's course is about
30. Furthermore, every year a different board
admits there were problems this year but says
things will be different next year. Students
should consider whether to continue funding
such a program.

Constitutional Amendments
A two-thirds majority of those voting is
necessary to amend the Constitution.
Separate Assessment Levying — Yes
This change will apply only to fee assess
ments which fund programs and groups for
either undergraduates or graduates.
The amendment would not
apply to assessments for organizations which
support both constituencies. The amendment
would also permit graduates to pass such an
assessment with only 10 per cent of the
graduates voting. Since the lowered number
of required voters would apply to assessments
which affect solely graduates and since few
graduates vote, we recommend a yes vote.
Overseas Assessment — Yes
Currently students who attend an overseas
campus must go through bureaucratic proce
dures in order to get their fee assessment re
funds. Virtually all overseas students do re
quest such refunds, and since this amend
ment would not appreciably decrease the in
come to groups funded by assesment, we
hope students here will make life easier for
those who go overseas.
Financial Audit — No
This proposal would mandate that groups
seeking to put a fee assessment on the ballot
through petitions present financial estimates
and audits to the senate and financial man
ager. Though it resembles a by-laws section,
it'sa bad proposal and should be voted down.
Thisamendment would burden groupswho
wish to appeal to the students for their signa
tures in order to secure a place on the ballot.
The Constitution clearly was written with the
intent that students could bypass and override
the senate if they so chose (see the sections on
initiative, referendum and recall) yet the se
nate wishes to make the process more cum
bersome and bring it under its own wing.
If students want to place an assessment on
the ballot without examining that group's fi
nances, that is — and should remain — their
right. Also, the amendment has no provision
for enforcement; the by-laws at least delegate
enforcementto the financial manager. Finally,
groups which seek money from funds under
the senate's control can be exempted under
this amendment from providing an audit, but
groups which seek funds that are under the
students' control can not be exempted from
that requirement.
By the way, for those who would allege that
this recommendation is made from purely
personal motives, it should be noted that the
Daily will continue to provide financial infor
mation about itself to the University and such
information is open for inspection at the Dai
ly's offices.
Sexist wording — Yes
Three years ago we endorsed a similar
proposal to change the wording of the Con
stitution to he or she, his/her and him/her
rather than only using the masculine forms of
the pronoun. The amendment failed because
the yes votes fell short of the needed two
thirds majority; we hope it passes this time.
Referenda
Withdrawal — Yes
We urge students to vote yes on this re
ferendum, and demonstrate their belief to the
trustees and others that American business
should withdraw from South Africa. Though
the referendum says that Stanford should ef
fect withdrawal "by means up to and includ
ing the sale of stock/' members of the Stan
ford Committee for a Responsible Investment
Policy have assured us that the results of this
referendum will not be used in any campaign
for divestment. They say withdrawal can be
accomplished through many means, includ
ing divestment, and the referendum will only
be used to show how students stand on with
drawal.
deßeauvoir (Androgyny) House — No
This proposal calls for the creation of a
committee to reconsider the decision, and the
process by which it was reached, to terminate
the deßeauvoir House.
We feel students should vote no for two
reasons. Even with a review of the decision,
we feel that such a committee would also
reach a decision to terminate this theme
house. The Office of Residential Education
used valid criteria to evaluate and end the
theme house. Furthermore, since the house
has already been designated to become the
German Studies House, it would be unfair to
students who draw into the house to find their
program cancelled.
However, we do hope the Housing Office
will decide that in the future, no theme house
may be terminated without a two-year trial
period, and that decisions to end a program
must be made early enough so as to allow for
an appeal before the draw commences.
Present residence priorities — Continue
The worst inequities of the draw have been
corrected, and all students are now covered
by the Guaranteed Housing plan, so these
priorities should be continued.
Western Culture — No
We have editorialized twice against the
proposed requirement, and we hope students
will join with us in expressing their displea
sure on this matter. However, since the re
quirement will probably be reinstated any
way, we recommend that students opt for the
model proposed by the Western Culture Task
Force.
Fee Assessments
We make the following recommendations
in regard to the 11 fee assessments which will
be on the ballot. Students should bear in mind
that unless 20% per cent of the students vote
in the election, no fee assessment can win. A
simple majority of at least 20 per cent of the
ASSU is needed to approve an assessment. All
fee assessments are refundable.
ASSU Publications Board, ASSU Speakers
Bureau, Academic Organizations Board,
Graduate Student Association, Stanford Com
mittee on Political Education (SCOPE) — Yes.
All of these groups are asking for $1, Au
tumn quarter fee assessment.
We wholeheartedly endorse the Publica
tions Board's request. The board last asked for
an assessment three years ago, and since then
the board has carefully used the money to
finance a host of campus publications, except
the Quad and the Daily. The money will be
used over the next few years toassist in financ
ing many publications which bring diversity of
viewpoint to the campus.
We hope students will vote for the Speakers
Bureau. This year the bureau has brought
speakers such as CIA Director Stansfield
Turner and economist Milton Friedman to
campus, and has also helped to finance vari
ous discussion panels in conjunction with
other groups.
The Academic Organizations Board request
will fund several organizations connected in
some way with academic activities.
We also believe the Graduate Students As
sociation deserves its funding request.
Should both this and a proposed constitu
tional amendment pass, this assessment
would be levied against only graduates.
We believe that SCOPE should be
granted its first fee assessment request.
SCOPE assisted in bringing journalist Ben
Bradlee to campus and it has also organized
debates on the Panama Canal treaties and
human rights. With this fee assessment,
SCOPE will no longer be dependent on others
for funding and should be able to prove
whether it is a viable organization.
Stanford Band, Program Fee — Yes
The Stanford Band and the Program Fee are
on the Ballot for a $1, Autumn and Winter
quarters fee assessment.
The Band will use its money for a trip to the
Midwest in the fall and a trip to Seattle in the
winter. The Band has promised that it will save
the money budgeted for the Midwest trip
should plans for that trip fall through. We're
sure the Band will take the proper action to
preserve the $11,000 allocated for the fall trip
should it not occur.
The ASSU Senate has allocated the program
fee's money to go to a wide variety of student
organizations, and so we hope students will
approve this assessment request.
ASSU Legal Counseling Office, KZSU, Daily —
Yes
These requests are all for a $1, Autumn,
Winter and Spring quarters assessment.
The LCO provides legal advice to students
on problems ranging from traffic violations to
landlord-tenant controversies, and can save
students from unnecessary hassle and ex
pense for a very modest cost.
KZSU's fee assessment will provide the
radio station with virtually all of its funding.
Since it is a non-commericial educational sta
tion, it can not accept advertising. KZSU pro
vides interesting programs along with a good
mix of news and sports, and the station will
soon increase its reception area when a power
increase goes into effect. The assessment will
run the station, cover the costs of the power
increase, and build up the station's pitifully
low reserve fund.
This is the fourth consecutive year in which
the Daily is asking for a $1, three-quarter fee
assessment. With this appreciated support,
we have been able to insure the Daily's finan
cial security and legal independence. We are
asking for this fee assessment so that we may
purchase computerized editing equipment.
Besides allowing us to put out a better pro
duct, this equipment will help to educate stu
dents about journalism, in accordance with
the purposes of our corporate charter.
Finally, we don't think a subscription of two
cents per issue is unreasonable, especially in
light of what people pay for another morning
newspaper.

trustees and others that American business
should withdraw from South Africa. Though
the referendum says that Stanford should ef
fect withdrawal "by means up to and includ
ing the sale of stock/' members of the Stan
ford Committee for a Responsible Investment
Policy have assured us that the results of this
referendum will not be used in any campaign
for divestment. They say withdrawal can be
accomplished through many means, includ
ing divestment, and the referendum will only
be used to show how students stand on with
drawal.
deßeauvoir (Androgyny) House — No
This proposal calls for the creation of a
committee to reconsider the decision, and the
process by which it was reached, to terminate
the deßeauvoir House.
We feel students should vote no for two
reasons. Even with a review of the decision,
we feel that such a committee would also
reach a decision to terminate this theme
house. The Office of Residential Education
used valid criteria to evaluate and end the
theme house. Furthermore, since the house
has already been designated to become the
German Studies House, it would be unfair to
students who draw into the house to find their
program cancelled.
However, we do hope the Housing Office
will decide that in the future, no theme house
may be terminated without a two-year trial
period, and that decisions to end a program
must be made early enough so as to allow for
an appeal before the draw commences.
Present residence priorities — Continue
The worst inequities of the draw have been
corrected, and all students are now covered
by the Guaranteed Housing plan, so these
priorities should be continued.
Western Culture — No
We have editorialized twice against the
proposed requirement, and we hope students
will join with us in expressing their displea
sure on this matter. However, since the re
quirement will probably be reinstated any
way, we recommend that students opt for the
model proposed by the Western Culture Task
Force.
Fee Assessments
We make the following recommendations
in regard to the 11 fee assessments which will
be on the ballot. Students should bear in mind
that unless 20% per cent of the students vote
in the election, no fee assessment can win. A
simple majority of at least 20 per cent of the
ASSU is needed to approve an assessment. All
fee assessments are refundable.
ASSU Publications Board, ASSU Speakers
Bureau, Academic Organizations Board,
Graduate Student Association, Stanford Com
mittee on Political Education (SCOPE) — Yes.
All of these groups are asking for $1, Au
tumn quarter fee assessment.
We wholeheartedly endorse the Publica
tions Board's request. The board last asked for
an assessment three years ago, and since then
the board has carefully used the money to
finance a host of campus publications, except
the Quad and the Daily. The money will be
used over the next few years toassist in financ
ing many publications which bring diversity of
viewpoint to the campus.
We hope students will vote for the Speakers
Bureau. This year the bureau has brought
speakers such as CIA Director Stansfield
Turner and economist Milton Friedman to
campus, and has also helped to finance vari
ous discussion panels in conjunction with
other groups.
The Academic Organizations Board request
will fund several organizations connected in
some way with academic activities.
We also believe the Graduate Students As
sociation deserves its funding request.
Should both this and a proposed constitu
tional amendment pass, this assessment
would be levied against only graduates.
We believe that SCOPE should be
granted its first fee assessment request.
SCOPE assisted in bringing journalist Ben
Bradlee to campus and it has also organized
debates on the Panama Canal treaties and
human rights. With this fee assessment,
SCOPE will no longer be dependent on others
for funding and should be able to prove
whether it is a viable organization.
Stanford Band, Program Fee — Yes
The Stanford Band and the Program Fee are
on the Ballot for a $1, Autumn and Winter
quarters fee assessment.
The Band will use its money for a trip to the
Midwest in the fall and a trip to Seattle in the
winter. The Band has promised that it will save
the money budgeted for the Midwest trip
should plans for that trip fall through. We're
sure the Band will take the proper action to
preserve the $11,000 allocated for the fall trip
should it not occur.
The ASSU Senate has allocated the program
fee's money to go to a wide variety of student
organizations, and so we hope students will
approve this assessment request.
ASSU Legal Counseling Office, KZSU, Daily —
Yes
These requests are all for a $1, Autumn,
Winter and Spring quarters assessment.
The LCO provides legal advice to students
on problems ranging from traffic violations to
landlord-tenant controversies, and can save
students from unnecessary hassle and ex
pense for a very modest cost.
KZSU's fee assessment will provide the
radio station with virtually all of its funding.
Since it is a non-commericial educational sta
tion, it can not accept advertising. KZSU pro
vides interesting programs along with a good
mix of news and sports, and the station will
soon increase its reception area when a power
increase goes into effect. The assessment will
run the station, cover the costs of the power
increase, and build up the station's pitifully
low reserve fund.
This is the fourth consecutive year in which
the Daily is asking for a $1, three-quarter fee
assessment. With this appreciated support,
we have been able to insure the Daily's finan
cial security and legal independence. We are
asking for this fee assessment so that we may
purchase computerized editing equipment.
Besides allowing us to put out a better pro
duct, this equipment will help to educate stu
dents about journalism, in accordance with
the purposes of our corporate charter.
Finally, we don't think a subscription of two
cents per issue is unreasonable, especially in
light of what people pay for another morning
newspaper.
ASSU Guest Professorship Board — No En
dorsement
We are unable to recommend how students
should vote on this $1, Autumn quarter as
sessment, but we hope voters will be mindful
of the following arguments. The board's
choice of guest professors must be approved
by the ASSU Senate, and so the board's selec
tion is limited by the fact that the senate has
usually been controlled by progressive-left
students who do not wish to invite those with
other political views to teach here. Also, many
persons — particularly conservatives — ask
for fees which the board cannot possibly pro
vide. Thus, guest professors have invariably
been of the leftist-radical persuasion.
However, the average number of enrolled
students in a guest professor's course is about
30. Furthermore, every year a different board
admits there were problems this year but says
things will be different next year. Students
should consider whether to continue funding
such a program.

Constitutional Amendments
A two-thirds majority of those voting is
necessary to amend the Constitution.
Separate Assessment Levying — Yes
This change will apply only to fee assess
ments which fund programs and groups for
either undergraduates or graduates.
The amendment would not
apply to assessments for organizations which
support both constituencies. The amendment
would also permit graduates to pass such an
assessment with only 10 per cent of the
graduates voting. Since the lowered number
of required voters would apply to assessments
which affect solely graduates and since few
graduates vote, we recommend a yes vote.
Overseas Assessment — Yes
Currently students who attend an overseas
campus must go through bureaucratic proce
dures in order to get their fee assessment re
funds. Virtually all overseas students do re
quest such refunds, and since this amend
ment would not appreciably decrease the in
come to groups funded by assesment, we
hope students here will make life easier for
those who go overseas.
Financial Audit — No
This proposal would mandate that groups
seeking to put a fee assessment on the ballot
through petitions present financial estimates
and audits to the senate and financial man
ager. Though it resembles a by-laws section,
it'sa bad proposal and should be voted down.
Thisamendment would burden groupswho
wish to appeal to the students for their signa
tures in order to secure a place on the ballot.
The Constitution clearly was written with the
intent that students could bypass and override
the senate if they so chose (see the sections on
initiative, referendum and recall) yet the se
nate wishes to make the process more cum
bersome and bring it under its own wing.
If students want to place an assessment on
the ballot without examining that group's fi
nances, that is — and should remain — their
right. Also, the amendment has no provision
for enforcement; the by-laws at least delegate
enforcementto the financial manager. Finally,
groups which seek money from funds under
the senate's control can be exempted under
this amendment from providing an audit, but
groups which seek funds that are under the
students' control can not be exempted from
that requirement.
By the way, for those who would allege that
this recommendation is made from purely
personal motives, it should be noted that the
Daily will continue to provide financial infor
mation about itself to the University and such
information is open for inspection at the Dai
ly's offices.
Sexist wording — Yes
Three years ago we endorsed a similar
proposal to change the wording of the Con
stitution to he or she, his/her and him/her
rather than only using the masculine forms of
the pronoun. The amendment failed because
the yes votes fell short of the needed two
thirds majority; we hope it passes this time.
Referenda
Withdrawal — Yes
We urge students to vote yes on this re
ferendum, and demonstrate their belief to the
trustees and others that American business
should withdraw from South Africa. Though
the referendum says that Stanford should ef

We wholeheartedly endorse the Publica

on the Ballot for a $1, Autumn and Winter
quarters fee assessment.
The Band will use its money for a trip to the
Midwest in the fall and a trip to Seattle in the
winter. The Band has promised that it will save
the money budgeted for the Midwest trip
should plans for that trip fall through. We're
sure the Band will take the proper action to
preserve the $11,000 allocated for the fall trip
should it not occur.
The ASSU Senate has allocated the program
fee's money to go to a wide variety of student
organizations, and so we hope students will
approve this assessment request.
ASSU Legal Counseling Office, KZSU, Daily —
Yes
These requests are all for a $1, Autumn,
Winter and Spring quarters assessment.
The LCO provides legal advice to students
on problems ranging from traffic violations to
landlord-tenant controversies, and can save
students from unnecessary hassle and ex
pense for a very modest cost.
KZSU's fee assessment will provide the
radio station with virtually all of its funding.
Since it is a non-commericial educational sta
tion, it can not accept advertising. KZSU pro
vides interesting programs along with a good
mix of news and sports, and the station will
soon increase its reception area when a power
increase goes into effect. The assessment will
run the station, cover the costs of the power
increase, and build up the station's pitifully
low reserve fund.
This is the fourth consecutive year in which
the Daily is asking for a $1, three-quarter fee
assessment. With this appreciated support,
we have been able to insure the Daily's finan
cial security and legal independence. We are
asking for this fee assessment so that we may
purchase computerized editing equipment.
Besides allowing us to put out a better pro
duct, this equipment will help to educate stu
dents about journalism, in accordance with
the purposes of our corporate charter.
Finally, we don't think a subscription of two
cents per issue is unreasonable, especially in
light of what people pay for another morning
newspaper.
ASSU Guest Professorship Board — No En
dorsement
We are unable to recommend how students
should vote on this $1, Autumn quarter as
sessment, but we hope voters will be mindful
of the following arguments. The board's
choice of guest professors must be approved
by the ASSU Senate, and so the board's selec
tion is limited by the fact that the senate has
usually been controlled by progressive-left
students who do not wish to invite those with
other political views to teach here. Also, many
persons — particularly conservatives — ask
for fees which the board cannot possibly pro
vide. Thus, guest professors have invariably
been of the leftist-radical persuasion.
However, the average number of enrolled
students in a guest professor's course is about
30. Furthermore, every year a different board
admits there were problems this year but says
things will be different next year. Students
should consider whether to continue funding
such a program.

Constitutional Amendments
A two-thirds majority of those voting is
necessary to amend the Constitution.
Separate Assessment Levying — Yes
This change will apply only to fee assess
ments which fund programs and groups for
either undergraduates or graduates.
The amendment would not
apply to assessments for organizations which
support both constituencies. The amendment
would also permit graduates to pass such an
assessment with only 10 per cent of the
graduates voting. Since the lowered number
of required voters would apply to assessments
which affect solely graduates and since few
graduates vote, we recommend a yes vote.
Overseas Assessment — Yes
Currently students who attend an overseas
campus must go through bureaucratic proce
dures in order to get their fee assessment re
funds. Virtually all overseas students do re
quest such refunds, and since this amend
ment would not appreciably decrease the in
come to groups funded by assesment, we
hope students here will make life easier for
those who go overseas.
Financial Audit — No
This proposal would mandate that groups
seeking to put a fee assessment on the ballot
through petitions present financial estimates
and audits to the senate and financial man
ager. Though it resembles a by-laws section,
it'sa bad proposal and should be voted down.
Thisamendment would burden groupswho
wish to appeal to the students for their signa
tures in order to secure a place on the ballot.
The Constitution clearly was written with the
intent that students could bypass and override
the senate if they so chose (see the sections on
initiative, referendum and recall) yet the se
nate wishes to make the process more cum
bersome and bring it under its own wing.
If students want to place an assessment on
the ballot without examining that group's fi
nances, that is — and should remain — their
right. Also, the amendment has no provision
for enforcement; the by-laws at least delegate
enforcementto the financial manager. Finally,
groups which seek money from funds under
the senate's control can be exempted under
this amendment from providing an audit, but
groups which seek funds that are under the
students' control can not be exempted from
that requirement.
By the way, for those who would allege that
this recommendation is made from purely
personal motives, it should be noted that the
Daily will continue to provide financial infor
mation about itself to the University and such
information is open for inspection at the Dai
ly's offices.
Sexist wording — Yes
Three years ago we endorsed a similar
proposal to change the wording of the Con
stitution to he or she, his/her and him/her
rather than only using the masculine forms of
the pronoun. The amendment failed because
the yes votes fell short of the needed two
thirds majority; we hope it passes this time.
Referenda
Withdrawal — Yes
We urge students to vote yes on this re
ferendum, and demonstrate their belief to the
trustees and others that American business
should withdraw from South Africa. Though
the referendum says that Stanford should ef
fect withdrawal "by means up to and includ
ing the sale of stock/' members of the Stan
ford Committee for a Responsible Investment
Policy have assured us that the results of this
referendum will not be used in any campaign
for divestment. They say withdrawal can be
accomplished through many means, includ
ing divestment, and the referendum will only
be used to show how students stand on with
drawal.
deßeauvoir (Androgyny) House — No
This proposal calls for the creation of a
committee to reconsider the decision, and the
process by which it was reached, to terminate
the deßeauvoir House.
We feel students should vote no for two
reasons. Even with a review of the decision,
we feel that such a committee would also
reach a decision to terminate this theme
house. The Office of Residential Education
used valid criteria to evaluate and end the
theme house. Furthermore, since the house
has already been designated to become the
German Studies House, it would be unfair to
students who draw into the house to find their
program cancelled.
However, we do hope the Housing Office
will decide that in the future, no theme house
may be terminated without a two-year trial
period, and that decisions to end a program
must be made early enough so as to allow for
an appeal before the draw commences.
Present residence priorities — Continue
The worst inequities of the draw have been
corrected, and all students are now covered
by the Guaranteed Housing plan, so these
priorities should be continued.
Western Culture — No
We have editorialized twice against the
proposed requirement, and we hope students
will join with us in expressing their displea
sure on this matter. However, since the re
quirement will probably be reinstated any
way, we recommend that students opt for the
model proposed by the Western Culture Task
Force.
