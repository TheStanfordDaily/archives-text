Drysdale et al.

We find the following flaws in the
Daily's reasoning behind yesterday's
COP endorsement.
The Daily suggests the "Golden
kranz" slate will provide continuity
with this year's COP which would be
"beneficial" to the students. An in
teresting series of events:
April 1977 — Goldenkranz man
ages winning COP's campaign.
Early 1978 — COP contacts Petty,
suggests Goldenkranz as running
mate.
March 1978 — COP tries to dis
suade potential Schoenung slate
members from running.
April 7, 1978 — Election Commis
sion (and COP) member contacts
Drysdale to dissuade him from run
ning.
April 12, 1978 — Members of COP
and Election Commission try to dis
suade Bush from joining Drysdale
slate.
April 13, 1978 — Immediately fol
lowing Senate meeting adjourn

ment, Goldenkranz and COP prop
ose new Election By-Law interpreta
tion to Senate Chairperson and Elec
tion Commissioner.
April 14,1978 — Election Commis
sioner presents Drysdale slate with
three options: (1) resignation, (2)
disqualification, or (3) replacing en
tire election publicity.
April 15, 1978 — Despite SOC ab
sence, senate meets and decides
Drysdale slate allowed on ballot.
COP member resigns position on
Election Commission.
Do we wantthis kind of continuity?
The Daily suggests that the "Gol
denkranz" slate is the most experi
enced. We have just as much organi
zational experience, if not more.
Why should ASSU and University
committee experience be a pre
requisite for COP? What has hap
pened to diversity and fresh perspec
tives?
The Daily assumes that only the
"Goldenkranz" slate perceives the

time demands of an effective COP.
Our slate — with a JD/MBA, two RAs
and a student who works 20 hours
per week for Hewlett-Packard — has
its time management skills down pat.
The Daily applauds Coldenkranz's
slate as "non-partisan." This year's
COP has strong political leanings and
since they helped formulate the
"Goldenkranz" slate it is only logical
that if they wanted the next COP to
be a continuation of themselves they
would choose a slate with a similar
ideology.
The thesis behind our campaign is
thatwe can represent and involve the
whole spectrum of Stanford students
— from women, minorities, graduate
students, fraternities to even, yes,
WASPS. If you are tired of more of
the same, let us know. Vote
