# Homosexuals in pulpit
## Analyzing task force position

The tone of Lane Webster's article
"Presbyterian Church considers or
dination of homosexuals" (Daily,
Apr. 7) troubled me. We are all of us
concerned with questions of human
sexuality; and the task force to study
homosexuality of the United Pre
sbyterian Church initiated a careful
process of study and research that is
not emphasized in Webster's article.
The task force recommendation is
not to be confused with blanket sup
port of gays any more than
heterosexuals have blanket support
at present. Anyone aware of the care
ful examining of candidates by Pre
sbyteries should be aware of this dis
tinction.
Recognizing that there is as much
diversity among homosexuals as
among heterosexuals, many of us are

supporting the recommendation of
the task force because we trust the
Presbyteries to make intelligent de
cisions, in the case of each particular
candidate, based on the criteria for
ordination in the Presbyterian
Church.
This may, in fact, still put a
homosexual at a disadvantage: he or
she may have to respond to ques
tions or anxieties expressed by the
examining committee.
The issue has been a painful one
not only because of the history of
social discrimination against gays,
but because it forces members of the
larger church community, if honest,
to face the nature of their own sexu
ality and its relevance, or irrelevance,
to the question at hand.
There is far more diversity of view
point, and care about what it means
to be a pastor, than the simple phrase
"ordination of gays" implies. Label
ling a position "liberal" as opposed
to something else misses the point,
and implies that the Church is con
ducting a binary opinion poll.
In those churches where it is un
derstood that revelation is continu
ous, and affects the manner in which
we read and understand the Bible,
study and care has taken precedence
over expression of our initial feel-

ings.
Webster's reference to the Pre
sbyterian Church as "hierarchical,"
attributed to Walter Cerber, pastor
of Menlo Park Presbyterian Church,
overlooks the fact that Presbyterian
government has, like the govern
ment of the United States, represen
tative courts or judicatories with in
terconnections from the local to the
national level.
The General Assembly consists of
an equal number of representatives
from the laity and the clergy chosen
by the Presbyteries. The tone of the
task force letter, introducing the
study materials, suggests the quality
of congregational participation for
which they hoped.
"There are anxieties for ourselves
and our church as we study this
complex issue, and we can all learn
from studying and from listening
with extra care to those who disagree
with us. You can expect to work hard
and to be angry and frustrated at
times. But we are confident that Cod
is at work and that he will use that
which would appear to divide us to
bind us closer together as the Body
of Christ."

to face the nature of their own sexu
ality and its relevance, or irrelevance,
to the question at hand.
There is far more diversity of view
point, and care about what it means
to be a pastor, than the simple phrase
"ordination of gays" implies. Label
ling a position "liberal" as opposed
to something else misses the point,
and implies that the Church is con
ducting a binary opinion poll.
In those churches where it is un
derstood that revelation is continu
ous, and affects the manner in which
we read and understand the Bible,
study and care has taken precedence
over expression of our initial feel-

ings.
Webster's reference to the Pre
sbyterian Church as "hierarchical,"
attributed to Walter Cerber, pastor
of Menlo Park Presbyterian Church,
overlooks the fact that Presbyterian
government has, like the govern
ment of the United States, represen
tative courts or judicatories with in
terconnections from the local to the
national level.
The General Assembly consists of
an equal number of representatives
from the laity and the clergy chosen
by the Presbyteries. The tone of the
task force letter, introducing the
study materials, suggests the quality
of congregational participation for
which they hoped.
"There are anxieties for ourselves
and our church as we study this
complex issue, and we can all learn
from studying and from listening
with extra care to those who disagree
with us. You can expect to work hard
and to be angry and frustrated at
times. But we are confident that Cod
is at work and that he will use that
which would appear to divide us to
bind us closer together as the Body
of Christ."
