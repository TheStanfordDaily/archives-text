# Heat induced illness
##

David Torin

Running and jogging are
exemplary exercises. They benefit
the psyche and the body, particularly
by improving the efficiency of the
heart and lungs, and they probably
prolong life. I myself am one of the
elderly people who puff around the
campus from time to time.
But a little known ill effect of run
ning, little known in our generally
temperate climate anyway, is heat
induced illness associated with ex
cessive exercise.
During the modest heat and
humidity wave of mid March, three
very well conditioned runners were
treated at the Cowell Student Health
Center for heat illness. Two Turkey
Trot trotters and one independent
jogger became quite ill, requiring in
travenous fluids, and up to two
weeks for complete recovery.
To explain a bit how these illnesses
occurred a little physiology follows.
The body has a limited capacity to rid
itself of the heat that is self generated
during exercise. Through radiation,
conduction, convection, and evap
oration, the body constantly at
tempts to keep its internal tempera
ture only slightly above normal dur
ing physical activity.
It is less able to accomplish this
loss of internal heat if the air temper
ature is over 80 degrees and/or the
humidity is high. In those condi
tions, radiation, conduction, and
convection are almost eliminated
and only evaporation — that is,
sweating — remains as a means of
heat loss.
Acclimatization
Physical conditioning improves
the ability of the individual to func
tion in hot weather. All things being
equal, one who is well conditioned
will be better able to withstand the
stress of running in warm weather
than one who is poorly conditioned.
However, no amount of condition
ing can produce hot weather
acclimatization. In response to living
in a hot climate, internal regulatory
mechanisms change, particularly the
level of the hormone aldosterone.
These changes allow the produc
tion of sweat that is nearly free of

sodium, making it easierforthe body
to maintain normal circulation and
well being. Acclimatization takes ap
proximately THREE weeks to com
plete. Even acclimatization is no
guarantee of safety if weather condi
tions are extreme and exercise is
overdone.
If the body's heat losing
capabilities are overwhelmed, heat
exhaustion or heat stroke develop.
Heat exhaustion is manifested by
undue weakness, thirst, anxiety, im
paired judgment, and a modest rise
in temperature to about 101 degrees.
It should be treated by quickly cool
ing the individual and by giving
him/her sodium-containing liquids,
orally if possible, or by vein. Heat
exhaustion may progress to heat
stroke in which the internal tempera
ture rises about above 106 degrees,
and severe damage may occur to the
internal organs, particularly the kid
neys and the liver. Severe heat stroke
may be fatal.
Many morals
The morals of this incomplete
story are:
—Exercise in the heat should be
curtailed.
—Acclimatization takes three
weeks.
—A runner should decrease his
distance and speed during the first
three weeks of hot weather, and
should pay attention to early feelings
of unusual fatique, weakness, and
thirst when exercising in hot
weather, and stop, cool off, rest, and
drink a sodium containing fluid such
as grape juice, tomato juice, or
"jello" water.
—A race is particularly hazardous
under these conditions.
For those who are interested in a
more detailed and scientific ap
proach to this question, an excellent
review article is "Environmental Heat
Illness," by James P. Knochel, M.D.,

vol. 133, May 1974, p. 841, which may

than one who is poorly conditioned.
However, no amount of condition
ing can produce hot weather
acclimatization. In response to living
in a hot climate, internal regulatory
mechanisms change, particularly the
level of the hormone aldosterone.
These changes allow the produc
tion of sweat that is nearly free of

sodium, making it easierforthe body
to maintain normal circulation and
well being. Acclimatization takes ap
proximately THREE weeks to com
plete. Even acclimatization is no
guarantee of safety if weather condi
tions are extreme and exercise is
overdone.
If the body's heat losing
capabilities are overwhelmed, heat
exhaustion or heat stroke develop.
Heat exhaustion is manifested by
undue weakness, thirst, anxiety, im
paired judgment, and a modest rise
in temperature to about 101 degrees.
It should be treated by quickly cool
ing the individual and by giving
him/her sodium-containing liquids,
orally if possible, or by vein. Heat
exhaustion may progress to heat
stroke in which the internal tempera
ture rises about above 106 degrees,
and severe damage may occur to the
internal organs, particularly the kid
neys and the liver. Severe heat stroke
may be fatal.
Many morals
The morals of this incomplete
story are:
—Exercise in the heat should be
curtailed.
—Acclimatization takes three
weeks.
—A runner should decrease his
distance and speed during the first
three weeks of hot weather, and
should pay attention to early feelings
of unusual fatique, weakness, and
thirst when exercising in hot
weather, and stop, cool off, rest, and
drink a sodium containing fluid such
as grape juice, tomato juice, or
"jello" water.
—A race is particularly hazardous
under these conditions.

more detailed and scientific ap

Running and jogging are
exemplary exercises. They benefit
the psyche and the body, particularly
by improving the efficiency of the
heart and lungs, and they probably
prolong life. I myself am one of the
elderly people who puff around the
campus from time to time.
But a little known ill effect of run
ning, little known in our generally
temperate climate anyway, is heat
induced illness associated with ex
cessive exercise.
During the modest heat and
humidity wave of mid March, three
very well conditioned runners were
treated at the Cowell Student Health
Center for heat illness. Two Turkey
Trot trotters and one independent
jogger became quite ill, requiring in
travenous fluids, and up to two
weeks for complete recovery.
To explain a bit how these illnesses
occurred a little physiology follows.
The body has a limited capacity to rid
itself of the heat that is self generated
during exercise. Through radiation,
conduction, convection, and evap
oration, the body constantly at
tempts to keep its internal tempera
ture only slightly above normal dur
ing physical activity.
It is less able to accomplish this
loss of internal heat if the air temper
ature is over 80 degrees and/or the
humidity is high. In those condi
tions, radiation, conduction, and
convection are almost eliminated
and only evaporation — that is,
sweating — remains as a means of
heat loss.
Acclimatization
Physical conditioning improves
the ability of the individual to func
tion in hot weather. All things being
equal, one who is well conditioned
will be better able to withstand the
stress of running in warm weather
than one who is poorly conditioned.
However, no amount of condition
ing can produce hot weather
acclimatization. In response to living
in a hot climate, internal regulatory
mechanisms change, particularly the
level of the hormone aldosterone.
These changes allow the produc
tion of sweat that is nearly free of
