# Shopping Center project nears completion phase

The second phase of a three-part improve
ment program at Stanford Shopping Center is
almost completed, according to James Nelson, a
leasing agent for the center.
New stores will be moving in this month and
next, he said.
The second phase consisted of an expansion
of available building space, Nelson added.
The first phase involved upgrading and re
novating the existing center. Phase-two con
struction which began last May adds 80,000
square feet of building space between Macy's
and Bullock's department stores, he said. Con
struction has already begun on phase three
which involves further expansion, Nelson ad
ded.
Phase three will be a new building between
Macy's and the Emporium department stores.
Two new restaurants have already signed
leases for the center, Nelson said. Sporting
goods, home accessories, candy and women's
apparel stores are also in the process of moving
in, he added.
"We've been very satisfied with our leasing
program," he said. Nelson said not all of the
spaces have been let, "but by fall we will" have
leased all of them.

University funds were used for the construc
tion, according to Nelson. He said University
endowment is invested in the center.
• "Rather than owning interest in a company to
make money, Stanford owns 100 per cent of the
shopping center," making money that way, he
said.
Plans are being made for phase four, which
would place another major fashion-specialty
store and three or four movie theaters in the
center, he said. The theaters would be located at
the corners of Arboretum and Quarry Roads.
The phase four project isn't expected to begin
until the 1980s.
Enlargement of the existing shopping center
is expected to increase traffic congestion on
two-lane Sand Hill Road, already the subject of
much controversy, Nelson said. Extending the
road to El Camino to reduce congestion is now
at a standstill because of pending lawsuits, he
added.
This poses problems, Nelson said. The plan
ning of the center's expansion was done under
the assumption that Sand Hill Road would be
extended. Most of the traffic presently going
through the center "is not destined for the
shopping center, which creates congestion and
a safety hazard," Nelson said.
