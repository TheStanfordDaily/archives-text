# Ecologist looks at fuel sources

Benefits of solar, wind and
biomass energy and disadvan
tages of fossil and nuclear fuels
were presented by a British
ecologist Monday afternoon in
Terman Auditorium.
Amory Lovins, British rep
resentative of the Friends of
the Earth movement, spoke
here as part of a mechanical
engineering seminar on
energy policy.
Lovins' philosophy regarding
the disadvantages of "hard
technology" paths such as fos
sil and nuclear sources as
compared to "soft technol
ogy" paths of solar, wind and
biomass energy, is detailed in
his recent book, "Soft Energy
Paths: Toward A Durable
Peace."
In describing hard technol
ogy Lovins explained that al
though more capital is being
invested, less energy is being
found.
"That increase in capital in
tensity suggests that no major
country outside the Persian
Culf can afford to employ
these big, high technologies,
especially the electric ones of a
truly large scale" such as the
United States, he said. He es
timated that over one trillion
1976 dollars would have to be
invested in the energy sector
over the next decade.
Lovins cited the side effects
of hard technology, including
increased levels of pollution,
bureaucracy, vulnerability to
disruption and unemployment
stemming from the need to di
vert investments from other
economic sectors to energy

production.
"If you take all these (factors)
together, they suggest that the
cheap, abundant energy for
which this policy is named isn't
really cheap at all; you just pay
for it everywhere else," Lovins
said.
Lovins advocated deregula
tion of fuel prices so their true
costs could be reflected. "We
think energy ought to be
cheap, so we keep subsidizing
it more and more to make it
look cheap. We use it waste
fully . . . and have to earn
money to pay for it,"he said.
Lovins' proposed soft path
consists of three main ele
ments: greatly increased effi
ciency of energy use, de
velopment of softtechnologies
and "intelligent and transi
tional use of fossil fuels."
"The difference between
these two paths is not in how
much energy we use of the
kinds of energy technology
that we use, but rather it is the
technical and especially the
political structure of the
energy systems that we turn
to," Lovins said.
The benefits of soft
technologies include a shorter
implementation period after
drawing board stage, creation
of more jobs, market competi
tiveness of small energy indus
tries and decentralized sources
of power, according to Lovins.
As Lovins sees it, the energy
crisis issue is "how can we
meet heterogeneous end-use
needs, to do tasks with an
elegant frugality of energy and
other resources."
