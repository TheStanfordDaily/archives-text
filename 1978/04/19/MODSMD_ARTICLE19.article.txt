Clarification
In yesterday's Daily, the
Wachtel-Broussare-Payne-Tepe
senior class president slate
members were quoted de
scribing the racial, sexual and
ethnic makeup of their slate.
Their self-description was in
tended as a humorous com
ment and not as a serious cam
paign position. The Daily
apologizes for any mis
construction of their statement
that may have occurred.

Clarification
A statement in the Daily's
endorsement column yester
day may have implied that the
de√üeauvoir House referendum
was intended to have the de-
Beauvoir house decision over
turned in order to replace the
new German Studies House. In
fact, the chief purpose of the
referendum is to review and
clarify the process used in
reaching such Office of Resi
dential Education decisions.
