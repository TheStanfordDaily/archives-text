# Menlo Park hostages escape as gunman shaves for TV
## 
### Randy Keith 
Yelling, "See you later, turkey,"
three Menlo Park boys fled Monday
night from the house where they had
been held captive for nearly 10 hours
by an armed escaped convict.
Menlo Park police said a "spur of
the moment decision" caused Jeff
MacCorkle, 11, his brother Steve, 9,
and a friend, Mike McVey, 11, to run
from the house about 2 a.m. while
the gunman shaved in preparation
for a nationally televised news con
ference he had demanded.
Negotiators at the scene were try
ing to set up the news conference
when the boys fled out the front door
of the MacCorkle house at 1060 Con
tinental Drive in the affluent Sharon
Heights area of Menlo Park.

The gunman, who police positively
identified yesterday as Allen Bouyer,
31, ran out about 30 seconds later
and was captured immediately by
police who had surrounded the
house. At that time Bouyer was un
armed. No shots were fired by
police.
Jeff MacCorkle was the only per
son injured during the 10-hour
ordeal. He received a superficial cut
in the neck when the gunman, al
legedly wielding a knife, forced his
way into the house about 4 p.m.
Monday. Police said the cut was ap
parently accidental, and Bouyer
bandaged it.
The tense drama began late Mon
day afternoon when Bouyer, who
police said escaped from the Red

Eagle Honor Farm near Montgomery,
Ala. on Feb. 19, was pulled over on
Interstate 280 by California Highway
Patrolmen.
Bouyer stopped, but then took off
again according to police. He eluded
his pursuers by leaving the freeway at
the Sand Hill Road exit and driving up
into the residential neighborhood
near the MacCorkle home.
Police said Bouyer went to the
door of the MacCorkle house and
asked to use the phone. He forced
his way into the house when the two
MacCorkle boys refused to let him
in. The boys' parents were not home
at the time.
According to police, Stratton
McVey then pulled into the driveway
and dropped off her son Mike. When
he reached the door Bouyer dragged
him inside while McVey
watched helplessly from her car.
Bouyer was said to have motioned
McVey to come inside but in
stead she raced off to find a police
man and found CHP officers a few
blocks away.
Within minutes police units sur
rounded the house, but Bouyer, ap
parently using MacCorkle's shotgun,
fired two shots to warn police to stay
away. Although police immediately
began telephone negotiations,
Bouyer made no demands until
about 6 p.m. when he asked for din
ner for himself and the hostages.
Bouyer was convicted of first
degree burglary and was sentenced
to 30 years in prison on July 29,1974.
Bouyer is being held in the San
Mateo County jail on one count of
kidnapping, three counts of false
imprisonment and one count of as
sault with a deadly weapon. Menlo
Park Police Chief Jerry McNamara
said more charges may be filed be
fore Bouyer is arraigned today at
1:30.

Yelling, "See you later, turkey,"
three Menlo Park boys fled Monday
night from the house where they had
been held captive for nearly 10 hours
by an armed escaped convict.
Menlo Park police said a "spur of
the moment decision" caused Jeff
MacCorkle, 11, his brother Steve, 9,
and a friend, Mike McVey, 11, to run
from the house about 2 a.m. while
the gunman shaved in preparation
for a nationally televised news con
ference he had demanded.
Negotiators at the scene were try
ing to set up the news conference
when the boys fled out the front door
of the MacCorkle house at 1060 Con
tinental Drive in the affluent Sharon
Heights area of Menlo Park.

The gunman, who police positively
identified yesterday as Allen Bouyer,
31, ran out about 30 seconds later
and was captured immediately by
police who had surrounded the
house. At that time Bouyer was un
armed. No shots were fired by
police.
Jeff MacCorkle was the only per
son injured during the 10-hour
ordeal. He received a superficial cut
in the neck when the gunman, al
legedly wielding a knife, forced his
way into the house about 4 p.m.
Monday. Police said the cut was ap
parently accidental, and Bouyer
bandaged it.
The tense drama began late Mon
day afternoon when Bouyer, who
police said escaped from the Red

Eagle Honor Farm near Montgomery,
Ala. on Feb. 19, was pulled over on
Interstate 280 by California Highway
Patrolmen.
Bouyer stopped, but then took off
again according to police. He eluded
his pursuers by leaving the freeway at
the Sand Hill Road exit and driving up
into the residential neighborhood
near the MacCorkle home.
Police said Bouyer went to the
door of the MacCorkle house and
asked to use the phone. He forced
his way into the house when the two
MacCorkle boys refused to let him
in. The boys' parents were not home
at the time.
According to police, Stratton
McVey then pulled into the driveway
and dropped off her son Mike. When
he reached the door Bouyer dragged
him inside while McVey
watched helplessly from her car.
Bouyer was said to have motioned
McVey to come inside but in
stead she raced off to find a police
man and found CHP officers a few
blocks away.
Within minutes police units sur
rounded the house, but Bouyer, ap
parently using MacCorkle's shotgun,
fired two shots to warn police to stay
away. Although police immediately
began telephone negotiations,
Bouyer made no demands until
about 6 p.m. when he asked for din
ner for himself and the hostages.
Bouyer was convicted of first
degree burglary and was sentenced
to 30 years in prison on July 29,1974.
Bouyer is being held in the San
Mateo County jail on one count of
kidnapping, three counts of false
imprisonment and one count of as
