## Five women discuss role of women in government 
### Karen Benedek 
A panel of five politically
oriented females, described by
Political Science Prof. Nan
Keohane as "a group of very
gutsy, beautiful women," dis
cussed Monday night their
views of women in govern
ment as part of SOC Disorien
tation Week.
The women approached the
issue of women's role in gov
ernment from different angles,
but agreed on four basic
points: women must take an
active role to abolish oppres
sion; being involved in politics
is primarily a learning experi
ence; solidarity is needed in
the struggle against oppres
sion; and time is needed for
any change to take place.
Barbara Babcock, professor
at the Law School and U.S.
Asst. Attorney General, attri
buted her position in govern
ment to the Women's Move
ment. The Justice Department

was looking for a woman and
her name "kept coming up on
lists," she said.
"Getting the job because I
am a woman is a hell of a lot
better than not getting it be
cause I'm a woman," Babcock
added.
She said she accomplished a
great deal just being in the Jus
tice Department. She added
she is "a signal to women that
the Justice Dept. is a safe place
to work."
Babcock discussed the "cru
cial importance" of under
standing the system in order to
change it, saying "Those who
say 'screw the system' don't
know a damn thing about it."
She said she considers racial
injustice as "the most crucial
problem that faces us today."
Babcock added, "we must
work to a point where sex or
race of a person doesn't make
any difference, but we are a
long way from that point."

Erica Huggins, Alameda
County School Board member,
described herself as a "prog
ressive individual" and a "vig
orous" member of the Black
Panther Party.
She said her energy is di
rected to improving the state of
minorities whom she cited as
being "more oppressed than
women."
Her position as the only
black on the school board is
"an educational tool and little
more. Any place people can
work to make changes is where
they should be," she said.
When asked to define her
role as a black woman in poli
tics, Huggins answered,
"When I define myself I di
minish myself. I can do nothing
but work for freedom for
people."
She stressed the importance
of supporting minorities in all
their causes. "Human beings
must be obligated to other

human beings,' she said, ad
ding she "hopes people are
listening and thinking" about
minority issues.
Lee Novick, coordinator of
last year's National Women's
Conference in Houston, said
she feels "women can reshape
politics." Since women are a
majority, they have the best
chance of all oppressed people
to improve their situation, she
added.
Women have always been af
raid of power, said Novick.
Since the suffrage movement,
women "have been convinced
to be powerless, non
participants in politics." To be
powerful, women "must join
in great numbers and become
active."
Like Huggins, Novick be
lieves everyone has a place to
improve the system. "We must
do what we can, where we can,
be it in art or academia or poli
tics."

She said she does not be
lieve people have become
apathetic, but that they have
"changed and matured politi
cally."
Garcia Pick, founder
coordinator of California Wo
man's Political Caucus, reiter
ated the importance of taking
action and acquiring power.
"The Chicano community
has been made to feel faceless
and powerless," she said.
Mexican-Americans suffer
from cultural stereotyping in
the United States, Pick said.
"Everyone who speaks with an
accent is accused of being an
illegal alien. It happened to me
in Houston," she added.
Pick agreed with the other
panelists that women are
needed to combat oppression.
"The society does not try to de
stroy women as early as men,
who are viewed as the trouble
makers," she said.
East Palo Alto Mayor Ger

trude Wilkes said she believes
the Women's Movement "ain't
dead."
Wilkes said she learned to
have self-confidence and
strength when working as a
child on a Louisiana cotton
plantation, and hence has
"never been on a board she
didn't plan on being head of."
Her mayor seat did not come
without great opposition,
however. The election results

were annulled tvvic e before (he
Palo Alto Park Council finally
accepted her.
Because she would not en
gage in any "wheeling, deal
ing" politics, the men on the
council couldn't work with
her, Wilkes said. She had to be
"very, very cool" in dealing
with her fellow politicians.
"As a politician, if you don't
drink or smoke, you have a
problem," she added.
