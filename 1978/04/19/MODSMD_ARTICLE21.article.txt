# Performing Friday in Tresidder
## Samelson helps people see magic 
### Jill Liscom 
"I don't do magic. I only help
the audience see magic," in
sisted 28-year-old magician
Peter Samelson.
"Magic really does happen
in the audience's minds. It's
true that I manipulate objects,
but I also shape your percep
tions so that what you perceive
is an experience of seeing
something which is magical,"
he explained.
Samelson said he has been
performing magic for 17 years,
although he stopped perform
ing magic for five years. This
was when he was attending
Stanford as an undergraduate
majoring in physics.
"It was in the late '60s when
there were lots of political de
monstrations. The political
climate was full of deception,
so I felt doing magic was train
ing people to enjoy not under
standing how things work. At
that time it was much more im
portant to train people to be
aware, not unaware," he said.
Samelson said that after he
left Stanford, he understood
why magic is important and
went back to it.
Children
"Watching children brought
me back," he explained. "They
have an incredible sense of
fantasy and they have a very
high level of energy and a high
sense of excitement about
their lives. Magic connects up
with that childlike center in

ourselves and taps into that
energy and creativity," he con
tinued.
Samelson added that his
shows often feed people
energy, and people have told
him that after seeing his show
they have gone home feeling
more energetic.
Although Samelson said he
came to Stanford "primarily
because of the academic qual
ity of the school," another
reason was that his father,
Hans Samelson, is a professor
in mathematics here.
Lonely field
He eventually changed his
major to theater when he
realized that "you had to be
brilliant in order to be satisfied
in the field" of physics and also
that physics is "a very lonely
field in many ways."
In contrast, "theater is a field
where you come into contact
with people, and focus on the
mutual production of both au
dience and performers," he
said.
"The process of creation is
really exciting to me as well as
performance — they both tie
together," Samelson com
mented.
In his shows, Samelson per
forms with Jacqueline Wildau,
("Pineapple") who is well
known for her skill as a mime,
Story of growth
Samelson described his
show as "a theatrical piece that
relates a story and examines

the developing relationship
between magician and mime."
It is a story of the personal
growth of the two characters,
as the magician changes from
superstar to human artist and
the mime gets over her awk
wardness and at the end is an
equal participant, said Samel
son.
Mime and magic tie together
in that they "invoke a creative
atmosphere," he said. "The
performer shapes an experi
enceforyou, but it happens for
you. We use an illusion to
communicate human truths
and social truths."
Illusion
"It strikes me as funny that I
use illusion to get at truth,"he
added.
Samelson grew interested in
magic at an early age, living in
Ann Arbor, Michigan. By the
time he was in jr. high school,
he had helped form a school
magic club and was using his
home basement for a rehearsal
studio.

After his experience at Stan
tord he spent seven months in
Europe learning more about
theater and magic. He then re
turned to New York, where he
and Barbara Breck formed
Wimsey Studios, which com
bined magic, mime and thea
ter.
Samelson said he met Wil
dau in New York and has
worked with her on and off for
several years.
Campus shows
Samelson and Wildau are
staying in Roble Hall this week
through a partially residential
education sponsored prog
ram. They will be doing a
"Teaser Show" tomorrow at
noon in Tresidder to promote
their main performance to be
held Friday at 8 p.m. in Tresid
der Large Lounge.
In addition, they will be ot
tering workshops in mime and
theater skills on Saturday in
Roble Hall to teach students
some of the skills of magic and
mime.

Master magician Peter Samelson and his partner a story of a developing relationship between the
Jacqueline Wildau combine mime and magic to tell two characters.


Peter Samelson
"I don't do magic. I only help
the audience see magic," in
sisted 28-year-old magician
Peter Samelson.
"Magic really does happen
in the audience's minds. It's
true that I manipulate objects,
but I also shape your percep
tions so that what you perceive
is an experience of seeing
something which is magical,"
he explained.
Samelson said he has been
performing magic for 17 years,
although he stopped perform
ing magic for five years. This
was when he was attending
Stanford as an undergraduate
majoring in physics.
"It was in the late '60s when
there were lots of political de
monstrations. The political
climate was full of deception,
so I felt doing magic was train
ing people to enjoy not under
standing how things work. At
that time it was much more im
portant to train people to be
aware, not unaware," he said.
Samelson said that after he
left Stanford, he understood
why magic is important and
went back to it.
Children
"Watching children brought
me back," he explained. "They
have an incredible sense of
fantasy and they have a very
high level of energy and a high
sense of excitement about
their lives. Magic connects up
with that childlike center in

ourselves and taps into that
energy and creativity," he con
tinued.
Samelson added that his
shows often feed people
energy, and people have told
him that after seeing his show
they have gone home feeling
more energetic.
Although Samelson said he
came to Stanford "primarily
because of the academic qual
ity of the school," another
reason was that his father,
Hans Samelson, is a professor
in mathematics here.
Lonely field
He eventually changed his
major to theater when he
realized that "you had to be
brilliant in order to be satisfied
in the field" of physics and also
that physics is "a very lonely
field in many ways."
In contrast, "theater is a field
where you come into contact
with people, and focus on the
mutual production of both au
dience and performers," he
said.
"The process of creation is
really exciting to me as well as
performance — they both tie
together," Samelson com
mented.
In his shows, Samelson per
forms with Jacqueline Wildau,
("Pineapple") who is well
known for her skill as a mime,
Story of growth
Samelson described his
show as "a theatrical piece that
relates a story and examines

the developing relationship
between magician and mime."
It is a story of the personal
growth of the two characters,
as the magician changes from
superstar to human artist and
the mime gets over her awk
wardness and at the end is an
equal participant, said Samel
son.
Mime and magic tie together
in that they "invoke a creative
atmosphere," he said. "The
performer shapes an experi
enceforyou, but it happens for
you. We use an illusion to
communicate human truths
and social truths."
Illusion
"It strikes me as funny that I
use illusion to get at truth,"he
added.
Samelson grew interested in
magic at an early age, living in
Ann Arbor, Michigan. By the
time he was in jr. high school,
he had helped form a school
magic club and was using his
home basement for a rehearsal
studio.

After his experience at Stan
tord he spent seven months in
Europe learning more about
theater and magic. He then re
turned to New York, where he
and Barbara Breck formed
Wimsey Studios, which com
bined magic, mime and thea
ter.
Samelson said he met Wil
dau in New York and has
worked with her on and off for
several years.
Campus shows
Samelson and Wildau are
staying in Roble Hall this week
through a partially residential
education sponsored prog
ram. They will be doing a
"Teaser Show" tomorrow at
noon in Tresidder to promote
their main performance to be
held Friday at 8 p.m. in Tresid
der Large Lounge.
In addition, they will be ot
tering workshops in mime and
theater skills on Saturday in
Roble Hall to teach students
some of the skills of magic and
mime.
