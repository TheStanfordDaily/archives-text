# Netters ready for USC, UCLA
## 
### Pete Snell 
Beginning tomorrow, Stanford tennis fans will be bracing
themselves for the biggest weekend of the year as both the men's
and women's teams from USC and UCLA invade the Farm for
matches that will last until Sunday.
An added treat will be the use of Maples Pavilion for night
matches on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, starting at 6:30 p.m.
USC will have their hand at the Cards first, as the men square
off Thursday. The women will clash Friday.
The Trojan men narrowly lost to the Cards at home two weeks
ago, 5-4, and will be gunning hard for the upset.
The Cards will have to concentrate well to avoid overlooking
USC for UCLA, which they host Saturday. The format for Thurs
day's match will be the same on Friday and Saturday also: in the
afternoon starting at 1 p.m. the No. 3-6 singles matches will be
played at Stanford Tennis Stadium along with the No. 2 and No. 3
doubles. The evening matches will have the No. 2 singles, the No.
1 singles and the No. 1 doubles matches, all on the Maples "rug."
In hosting the USC women, the Cards are challenging the best
team in the country. The Trojans' top four players are so close that
a definite ladder has never been established, but their probable
No. 1 player will be Stacy Margolin. Coach Anne Could feels that
"the girls are as ready as they can be for this match. If we play as
well as we are capable of, we have a good chance of winning'.'
Most definitely, the biggest match all weekend will be the
battle between the two best men's teams in collegiate tennis and
the probable NCAA finalists, Stanford and UCLA. According to
coach Dick Could, "We were very fortunate to have won down in
Los Angeles (5-4). We had two match points against us (against
John McEnroe and Peter Rennert in singles) and still managed to
pull it out. I honestly believe that we'll have to play 25 per cent
better this time in order to beat them again. Having lost at home,
they really have something to prove by beating us up here."
Not only will the team match be a blockbuster, but the No. 1
singles match could prove to be the best tennis ever seen on the
Farm. The Cards' John McEnroe will take on the Bruins' Eliot
Teltscher, who's been called by Hie Nastase "the best American
player I've seen in 10 years."
For the first time ever, the play by play of Cardinal tennis will be
on the radio as KZSU plans to air live spot reports from Maples all
three nights plus the point by point action of McEnroe's singles
matches Thursday and Saturday starting at approximately 8 p.m.
