## Booters win two 
### Dean Eyre 
The women's soccer teams
chalked up two wins and a tie
in action on Friday and Satur
day.
The visiting Chico State
teams dropped both ends of
Friday's doubleheader, losing
to Stanford's first team 3-1, and
coming up short against the
second team 1-0.
The Is capitalized on a hand
call for their first score, with
Kris McCarrey puttingaway the
penalty kick. The Cardinals
dominated play during the
second half but were unable to
put in another goal for 25 mi
nutes. Cindy Shorney crossed
a pass to Julie Zender to regis
ter Stanford's second goal.
Chico put together a strong
counterattack, getting a goal
from a one-on-one situation.
However, with 10 minutes re
maining, McCarrey put the
game out of reach with her
second goal of the game.
The lis showed themselves
to be "good learners, forming
triangles to set up passes and
support, but shot too quickly,"
Wright said. Karen Benedek
scored what proved to be the
winning goal 25 minutes into
the game. Connie Keeran had a
strong game at the right
halfback spot and Pauline
McNamara played "fantastic at

sweeper," according to
Wright.
In Saturday's match against
Davis, the Is dominated at first,
then fell behind 1-0,20 minutes
into the game, on a defensive
breakdown. Nancy Jo Geenan,
playing an inspirational, ag
gressive second half, despite
torn cartilage in her knee,was
pushed while driving towards
the goal. McGarrey's penalty
kick was good to tie the game
at one point apiece.
The Aggies took the lead
back after a one-on-one situa
tion at the Card goal caused a
second defensive mistake. This
time the ball bounced off the
goal post and was kicked back
in by an Aggie forward.
Griep kicked the tying goal
with one minute left, and in
"pure" soccer style, no shoot
outs or overtime periods fol
lowed. The Is, now 5-1-1, have
three more league games to
play before meeting Berkeley,
who holds a 7-1 record, for
what could very well be the
league championship.
