# Card nine edges Gaels
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The varsity baseball team
pulled out yet another late in
ning victory yesterday after
noon in the ninth inning of a
non-conference game with St.
Mary's in Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinals trailed the
Gaels from the very beginning,
but remained within striking
distance throughout, putting
together scoring drives in the
eighth and ninth to come out
on top 5-4.
A total of nine pitchers saw
action in the rather uneventful
game. Ace reliever Joe LoPresti
picked up his fourth win for the
Cards this season against only
one loss, by setting down St.
Mary's in the top of the ninth
before Stanford scored the
winning run in the bottom half
of that inning.
St. Mary's got off to an early
lead in the first inning, scoring
four runs on an assortment of
hits — including a lead-off tri
ple by leftfielder Ron Pelley —
and an error by third baseman
Gary Scott.
Stanford recovered two runs
of the four run deficit in the
bottom of the second, then
waited until the eighth to tie

the score at four-all. The Cards
capitalized on two walks by tir
ing Gael pitcher Steve Sen
teney, a throwing error which
allowed one run to score and a
sacrifice fly deep to right field
by shortstop Dave Perez,
which scored the winning run.
Perez paced the Cards at bat
going three-for-three on the af
ternoon.
Todd Ervin laced the ball into
left field to start the ninth in
ning rally forthe Cardinals, and

was moved into scoring posi
tion on a sacrifice bunt by Larry
Reynolds. Randy Wong was
then intentionally walked to
set up the force play. The next
man to bat, Mike Codiroli,
spoiled the plan, however,
singling to center to score Ervin
from second.
