Nixon tapes not to be released
Washington — Richard Nixon won a Supreme Court
victory yesterday — copies of his most famous White
House tape recordings will not tour the cocktail circuit.
The high court voted 7-2 to bar immediate public re
lease of the 30 tapes played at the 1974 Watergate
cover-up trial of Nixon's top aides. But the justices
steered clear of the ex-president's contention that allow
ing the public to hear the tapes would invade his privacy.
Nixon challenged a 1976 decision of the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Washington that would have made
copies of the tapes immediately available for broadcast
ing and commercial reproduction.
Lawyers for Nixon argued that home sales of 22 hours'
worth of White House conversations among Watergate
figures would lead to the tapes being "played at cocktail
parties and in satiric productions."
They said such exploitation of the tapes would cause
Nixon great embarrassment, even "mental anguish.
The court's decision centered on its narrow view of a
common-law right older than the Constitution.
"It is clear that the courts of this country recognize a
general right of the public to inspect and copy public
records and documents," Justice Lewis Powell wrote for
the court.
He added, however, that "the right is not absolute.'
Message prompts search for Moro
Corvaro, Italy — A message saying kidnapped former
Premier Aldo Moro had been "executed" sent hundreds
of police and frogmen yesterday to look for the body at a
remote, icy lake in the central Italian mountains.
The message, bearing the signature of the Red
Brigades guerrillas, said Moro's body had been dumped
into the shallow waters of Lake Duchessa, a trout
fisherman's haven 72 miles northeast of Rome.
But the search by squads of frogmen, soldiers and
police was suspended at dusk without finding a body.
Officials said the Red Brigades signature appeared to
be genuine, but its contents may have been a ruse to
divert the attention of police who have been staging
nation-wide search operations for Moro. The message
also threatened other politicians.
Rome police said that earlier in the day, they made
their first break in the case by finding an apartment
hideout filled with arms, ammunition and messages
signed by the Brigades. The 61-year-old Moro was kid
napped and his five bodyguards were killed by Red
Brigades terrorists in a Rome street ambush March 16.
Officials seek cause of ski mishap
Squaw Valley — Spring skiers crowded the lower
slopes of Squaw Valley Ski Area yesterday while Califor
nia safety officials on the upper level combed a mangled
cable car for an elusive clue to why four persons are
dead.
"If we can find one solid clue, we could wind up the
investigation," James Beaton, tramway safety engineer
for the California Division of Industrial Safety said. "At
this point, it's like looking for a needle in the haystack."
Gene Cresci, information officer for the California
Department of Industrial Relations, said that while no
conclusive findings have been reached, investigators
had "tentatively eliminated certain possible causes."
He said investigators had completed their probe of the
tram's mechanical parts and electrical circuitry. Based
on preliminary findings, they found nothing that would
point to either as "a causal factor leading up to the
accident," he said.

He said the two steel cables which are connected to
each car were examined and "as far as they know, there
was nothing in the condition of those ropes which
caused the accident." He said the cables had been
examined by the state in August and the resort about
three weeks ago and found to be in good order.
Strikes plague Sacramento Bee
Sacramento — About 300 Newspaper Guild members
walked off their jobs at the Sacramento Bee yesterday in
support of a strike called one day earlier by the Mailers
Union.
Printers union members had left their jobs Monday,
but members of the Pressmen's Union continued to
work.
The 175-member Mailers Union struck in a dispute
over manning of equipment for distribution of news
papers and over wages for part-time workers who de
liver newspapers to street racks and home delivery car
riers.
The Bee, which normally publishes three editions
daily, published two editions yesterday. Company
spokesman Frank McPeak said the newspaper would
continue to publish on that schedule into the foresee
able future.
McPeak said the newspaper was doing "reasonably
well" filling essential jobs with management personnel
and workers who chose not to strike.
Guidelines restrict criminal files
Sacramento — Attorney General Evelle Younger issued
guidelines Monday which urge local police agencies to
keep certain information out of criminal intelligence
files.
The guidelines, developed by an advisory committee,
say that religious, sexual or political information which
does "not relate tocriminal conduct" should not be kept
in the files.
Information in permanent intelligence files should re
late to specific crimes, the guidelines say, including nar
cotic trafficking, gambling, loan sharking and major
crimes such as murder.
Younger's office said the guidelines were being sent
to local agencies for their "consideration and adoption
relative to their particular need."
Dow Jones drops 6.85 after rally
New York — A desire to pocket profits made in the
stock market's dramatic three-day rally led many inves
tors to sell their holdings yesterday, pushing prices
broadly lower in very heavy trading.
The closely watched Dow Jones average of 30 indust
rials dropped 6.85 to 803.27 by the closing bell, after
fluctuating during the session. The Dow jumped 43.83

of the New York Stock Exchange with volume of 38.95
million shares. Declines outnumbered advances by
