# Property tax plans discussed on KZSU

Californians need property tax re
lief but Proposition 13, the so-called
larvis-Gann initiative on the June bal
lot, might not be the best solution,
said Greg Morris in a debate last
night on KZSU's "Clearing the Air."
Morris, a Sunnyvale city council
man and chairman of "No on 13"
steering committee, said the initia
tive, which proposes to cut Califor
nia property taxes by two-thirds,
would severely hurt local govern
ments and school districts by forcing
them to slash their budgets.
Proposition 13 requires county
boards of supervisors to apportion
property tax revenues "according to
law to the districts within the coun
ties." Morris claimed non
incorporated city areas such as open

space districts would be virtually
without funds under this plan.
Roberta Allen of United Taxpayers,
Inc. and the "Yes on 13" committee,
said the initiative would not hurt
local governments if their sources of
revenue were transferred away from
property tax. In order to finance
schools, she suggests the reinstate
ment of a 1930s system which funded
public schools through sales tax.
Morris and Allen also disagreed on
Proposition 8, the state legislature's
alternative to Jarvis-Cann. While
both agreed it is a "less than perfect
bill," Morris favors the measure. He
said the legislature would get the
wrong idea if both tax relief initia
tives were defeated, and since
Jarvis-Gann would do more harm
than good, he recommends Proposi
tion 8 by default.
Allen said Proposition 8 will pro
vide little if no real tax relief. She said
the 30 per cent property tax cut pro
vided by Proposition 8 will be coun
teracted by assessments which
would rise if the proposition passed.
Conversely, Jarvis-Gann limits in
creases in assessment to two per cent
per year and such increases can only
be imposed when the property is
sold.
Both Allen and Morris attacked
property taxes in general. Morris said
property tax is a regressive tax, giving
little regard to who is most able to
pay. He added that it violates the
"American Dream" by preventing
many people from owning their own
homes.
Allen said property taxes are being
used to finance services not con
nected with property, such as
schools. She said this leads to in
equality in state fund distribution
and added Proposition 13 might
force this practice to stop.
Morris said if Proposition 13 fails,
tax relief can be provided by better
state government management,
while Allen said if Proposition 13 pas
ses, skillful state management will
preserve local governments and
their services.
If the state government fails on
either count, both agreed the solu
tion would be to "throw the bums
out."
