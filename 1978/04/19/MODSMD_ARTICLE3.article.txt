# Property tax plans discussed on KZSU

Californians need property tax re
lief but Proposition 13, the so-called
larvis-Gann initiative on the June bal
lot, might not be the best solution,
said Greg Morris in a debate last
night on KZSU's "Clearing the Air."
Morris, a Sunnyvale city council
man and chairman of "No on 13"
steering committee, said the initia
tive, which proposes to cut Califor
nia property taxes by two-thirds,
would severely hurt local govern
ments and school districts by forcing
them to slash their budgets.
Proposition 13 requires county
boards of supervisors to apportion
property tax revenues "according to
law to the districts within the coun
ties." Morris claimed non
incorporated city areas such as open

space districts would be virtually
without funds under this plan.
Roberta Allen of United Taxpayers,
Inc. and the "Yes on 13" committee,
said the initiative would not hurt
local governments if their sources of
revenue were transferred away from
property tax. In order to finance
schools, she suggests the reinstate
ment of a 1930s system which funded
public schools through sales tax.
Morris and Allen also disagreed on
Proposition 8, the state legislature's
alternative to Jarvis-Cann. While
both agreed it is a "less than perfect
bill," Morris favors the measure. He
said the legislature would get the
wrong idea if both tax relief initia
tives were defeated, and since
Jarvis-Gann would do more harm
