# Panama treaty approved by narrow Senate margin
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Senate approved the last of
two Panama Canal treaties yesterday, agreeing to relin
quish control of the waterway in the year 2000 and giving
President Jimmy Carter a narrow but crucial victory.
The vote was 68-32, the same margin by which the
Senate approved the first treaty on March 16. The margin
of victory was only one more than the two-thirds major
ity required by the Constitution.
The same 68 senators who voted for the first pact also
approved the second.
The first treaty commits the United States and Panama
to maintain the neutrality of the international waterway,
which to ships of all nations.
Tuesday's vote completed the deal, providing for ac
tual transfer of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31,1999.
It came after nearly 40 days of Senate debate, and after
intensive lobbying by Carter and his associates.
Carter and Panamanian leader Cen. Omar Torrijos
signed the treaties in a ceremony in Washington last fall,
and the administration has contended that the treaties'
ratification is crucial to the president's ability to conduct
an effective foreign policy.
To gain the votes for victory, Carter and Senate leaders
had agreed on an amended version of a treaty reserva
tion sought by Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.).
The reservation spells out U.S. rights to take any ac
tion, including military force, to keep the canal open in
case of work stoppages or other internal disruptions.
DeConcini, Senate leaders and Carter, agreed to a
compromise giving the United States those rights. The
compromise also asserted, however, that the United
States would not be permitted to intervene in Panama's
internal affairs or violate its sovereignty.
In approving the so-called DeConcini reservation by a
73-27 vote, the Senate removed what had been the
biggest obstacle to ratification of the second of the two
canal treaties.
Shortly before the final vote the Senate rejected an
effort by Sen. Robert Griffin (R-Mich.) to send the treaty
back to Carter for renegotiation. The vote was 64-36.
In offering his unsuccessful motion, Griffin argued
that the Senate was "setting the stage for an almost

inevitable confrontation between the United States and
Panama" by "papering over serious and obvious differ
ences" allowing each government to interpret the
treaties as it sees fit.
As the hour for ratification vote approached, the out
come remained in doubt, and both sides worked
feverishly to corral decisive votes.
They focused on three lawmakers who refused to say
publicly where they stood, but whose decisions would
determine the fate of the treaty.
All three — Howard Cannon (D-Nev.), James
Abourezk (D-S.D.) and S.I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.) — voted
for the first of the two treaties, which was narrowly
approved last month, but withheld support of the sec
ond.
Cannon told reporters he had informed Carter he
"was leaning against" the treaty but indicated he would
support it if the Senate agreed to a reservation he plan
ned to introduce. This reservation concerned interest
payments of $20 million a year that the United States has
been receiving from the Panama Canal Co. for its initial
investment in the canal.
The refusal of the three senators to commit them
selves left 65 senators lined up in favor of the treaty and
32 against.
Sen. Jennings Randolph (D-W. Va.) announced he
would vote against the second treaty as he did the first.
That left the outcome in the hands of Hayakawa, Cannon
and Abourezk.
Hayakawa said last week he would vote against the
second pact unless Carter made some major conces
sions in other areas of foreign policy.
Abourezk said he would vote no unless the president
reversed his stand in favor of deregulating natural gas
prices. But after meeting with Carter at the White House
early yesterday, there were hints that he might vote for it
after all.
The final vote marked the conclusion of 38 days of
debate on the two treaties. Senate historians said it was
possibly the longest continuous debate on a treaty issue
in Senate history.

quish control of the waterway in the year 2000 and giving
President Jimmy Carter a narrow but crucial victory.
The vote was 68-32, the same margin by which the
Senate approved the first treaty on March 16. The margin
of victory was only one more than the two-thirds major
ity required by the Constitution.
The same 68 senators who voted for the first pact also
approved the second.
The first treaty commits the United States and Panama
to maintain the neutrality of the international waterway,
which to ships of all nations.
Tuesday's vote completed the deal, providing for ac
tual transfer of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31,1999.
It came after nearly 40 days of Senate debate, and after
intensive lobbying by Carter and his associates.
Carter and Panamanian leader Cen. Omar Torrijos
signed the treaties in a ceremony in Washington last fall,
and the administration has contended that the treaties'
ratification is crucial to the president's ability to conduct
an effective foreign policy.
To gain the votes for victory, Carter and Senate leaders
had agreed on an amended version of a treaty reserva
tion sought by Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.).
The reservation spells out U.S. rights to take any ac
tion, including military force, to keep the canal open in
case of work stoppages or other internal disruptions.
DeConcini, Senate leaders and Carter, agreed to a
compromise giving the United States those rights. The
compromise also asserted, however, that the United
States would not be permitted to intervene in Panama's
internal affairs or violate its sovereignty.
In approving the so-called DeConcini reservation by a
73-27 vote, the Senate removed what had been the
biggest obstacle to ratification of the second of the two
canal treaties.
Shortly before the final vote the Senate rejected an
effort by Sen. Robert Griffin (R-Mich.) to send the treaty
back to Carter for renegotiation. The vote was 64-36.
In offering his unsuccessful motion, Griffin argued
that the Senate was "setting the stage for an almost

inevitable confrontation between the United States and
Panama" by "papering over serious and obvious differ
ences" allowing each government to interpret the
treaties as it sees fit.
As the hour for ratification vote approached, the out
come remained in doubt, and both sides worked
feverishly to corral decisive votes.
They focused on three lawmakers who refused to say
publicly where they stood, but whose decisions would
determine the fate of the treaty.
All three — Howard Cannon (D-Nev.), James
Abourezk (D-S.D.) and S.I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.) — voted
for the first of the two treaties, which was narrowly
approved last month, but withheld support of the sec
ond.
Cannon told reporters he had informed Carter he
"was leaning against" the treaty but indicated he would
support it if the Senate agreed to a reservation he plan
ned to introduce. This reservation concerned interest
payments of $20 million a year that the United States has
been receiving from the Panama Canal Co. for its initial
investment in the canal.
The refusal of the three senators to commit them
selves left 65 senators lined up in favor of the treaty and
32 against.
Sen. Jennings Randolph (D-W. Va.) announced he
would vote against the second treaty as he did the first.
That left the outcome in the hands of Hayakawa, Cannon
and Abourezk.
Hayakawa said last week he would vote against the
second pact unless Carter made some major conces
sions in other areas of foreign policy.
Abourezk said he would vote no unless the president
reversed his stand in favor of deregulating natural gas
prices. But after meeting with Carter at the White House
early yesterday, there were hints that he might vote for it
after all.
The final vote marked the conclusion of 38 days of
debate on the two treaties. Senate historians said it was
possibly the longest continuous debate on a treaty issue
in Senate history.
