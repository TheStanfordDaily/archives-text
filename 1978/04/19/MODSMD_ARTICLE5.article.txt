# Local reaction to treaty varies

News of the Senate ratification of the Panama Canal
treaty evoked a variety of reactions from University pro
tessors and fellows at the Hoover Institution.
"It certainly is desirable to have a treaty," said History
Assoc. Prof. John Wirth, who is also director of the Latin
American studies program here. "The old formula was
recognized as politically impossible by everyone except
the American right."
Wirth said he felt the 38-day debate didn't really
change anyone's mind.
"It was mostly a charade," he said. "The business
community, South America, and academics all saw the
treaty was necessary long ago. The debates were mostly
for the political class. It is important now as presidential
prestige is being renegotiated."
Capt. Paul Ryan, research associate at Hoover Institu
tion and author of a Hoover study on "The Panama
Controversy: U.S. Diplomacy and Defense Interests,"
presented a different opinion.
"If there is cheering in the White House over the
approval of the second Panama Canal treaty, such jubila
tion may be ill advised," he stated in a press release.
"The historical record suggests the strong possibility
that Washington's relationship with Panama will be
rocky."
Ryan said Gen. Torrijos will "exert every effort" to
have his Assembly approve the treaties, but "we may
expect Panamanian radicals will not miss the opportun
ity to instigate street demonstrations ... as a result of
the Senate's reservations."
Richard Burress, associate director and senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution, expressed the same reserva
tions on the Senate ratification.
"I'm disappointed," he said. "Because of this treaty,
we appear rather weak and unsure of ourselves. It ap
pears that we don't have much interest in our national
defense, especially to our adversaries."

Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall said he felt the
treaty itself wasn't the main issue.
"When the chips are down, it doesn't make a damn
difference whether treaties are there or not," he said.
"But the treaty has been a delightful example of two
views in the U.S. on how to advance our interest in the
world."
On one side, according to Marshall, are the American
"nationalists and chauvinists" who think the only way
the third world will see our power is by our "control."
"They think of the United States as a 'Great Power,'
and think we have a national interest in foreign bases
and territories," he said.
On the other side are the more "politically sophisti
cated," said Marshall.
"They see that if we dominate, if we hold territory, it
inflames nationalism elsewhere. This makes other coun
tries hate the United States, and ultimately leads to in
surgency," he said.
Wirth felt also the issue had more domestic signifi
cance than international importance.
"It's interesting for me because it didn't involve Latin
America,"he said. "They wanted a new treaty because
the old one was a vestige of colonialism.
"But the last thing they want is turmoil — for example,
higher rates. If the president had not managed to get the
treaty through Congress, then it could have been quite
negative for Latin America."
In order to "get the treaty through Congress," said
Wirth, the president had to overcome many negative
feelings over the treaty.
The great national unease "had to do with the fact that
it looked like a sign of retreat by the U.S. government."
Marshall felt the treaty was an important issue and the
debates held major significance in our society.
"It provided an interesting opportunity to discuss how
a great power ought to behave in the '705," he said.

treaty was necessary long ago. The debates were mostly
for the political class. It is important now as presidential
prestige is being renegotiated."
Capt. Paul Ryan, research associate at Hoover Institu
tion and author of a Hoover study on "The Panama
Controversy: U.S. Diplomacy and Defense Interests,"
presented a different opinion.
"If there is cheering in the White House over the
approval of the second Panama Canal treaty, such jubila
tion may be ill advised," he stated in a press release.
"The historical record suggests the strong possibility
that Washington's relationship with Panama will be
rocky."
Ryan said Gen. Torrijos will "exert every effort" to
have his Assembly approve the treaties, but "we may
expect Panamanian radicals will not miss the opportun
ity to instigate street demonstrations ... as a result of
the Senate's reservations."
Richard Burress, associate director and senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution, expressed the same reserva
tions on the Senate ratification.
"I'm disappointed," he said. "Because of this treaty,
we appear rather weak and unsure of ourselves. It ap
pears that we don't have much interest in our national
defense, especially to our adversaries."

Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall said he felt the
treaty itself wasn't the main issue.
"When the chips are down, it doesn't make a damn
difference whether treaties are there or not," he said.
"But the treaty has been a delightful example of two
views in the U.S. on how to advance our interest in the
world."
On one side, according to Marshall, are the American
"nationalists and chauvinists" who think the only way
the third world will see our power is by our "control."
"They think of the United States as a 'Great Power,'
and think we have a national interest in foreign bases
and territories," he said.
On the other side are the more "politically sophisti
cated," said Marshall.
"They see that if we dominate, if we hold territory, it
inflames nationalism elsewhere. This makes other coun
tries hate the United States, and ultimately leads to in
surgency," he said.
Wirth felt also the issue had more domestic signifi
cance than international importance.
"It's interesting for me because it didn't involve Latin
America,"he said. "They wanted a new treaty because
the old one was a vestige of colonialism.
"But the last thing they want is turmoil — for example,
higher rates. If the president had not managed to get the
treaty through Congress, then it could have been quite
negative for Latin America."
In order to "get the treaty through Congress," said
Wirth, the president had to overcome many negative
feelings over the treaty.
The great national unease "had to do with the fact that
it looked like a sign of retreat by the U.S. government."
Marshall felt the treaty was an important issue and the
debates held major significance in our society.
"It provided an interesting opportunity to discuss how
a great power ought to behave in the '705," he said.
News of the Senate ratification of the Panama Canal
treaty evoked a variety of reactions from University pro
tessors and fellows at the Hoover Institution.
"It certainly is desirable to have a treaty," said History
Assoc. Prof. John Wirth, who is also director of the Latin
American studies program here. "The old formula was
recognized as politically impossible by everyone except
the American right."
Wirth said he felt the 38-day debate didn't really
change anyone's mind.
"It was mostly a charade," he said. "The business
community, South America, and academics all saw the
treaty was necessary long ago. The debates were mostly
for the political class. It is important now as presidential
prestige is being renegotiated."
