# Oak trees, lightning, magnetic fields: scientist finds connection
## 
### David Ansley 
That oak tree in your front yard
may be silently monitoring the
earth's magnetic field, a re
searcher here has discovered.
The tree may be acting as a giant
antenna as sensitive as custom
made detectors costing
thousands of dollars, he says.
Antony Fraser-Smith, a radios
cience researcher investigating
ultra-low frequency (ULF) radio
waves, made the discovery two
years ago. On a hunch, he ham
mered two nails into an oak tree in
the foothills, hooked up his de
tecting equipment to these crude
electrodes, and found an electric
current flowing through the tree.
His work was reported in the
Feb. 16 issue of Nature, a British
scientific journal. A photograph
of one of Stanford's oak trees
graces the cover of that issue.
Electricity is generated
whenever the magnetic field pas
sing through an electrical conduc
tor is altered. That's why a bell
rings when you walk through an
airport security machine wearing
a heavy metal belt buckle.
In the tree's case, Fraser-Smith
says, the current is created in the
tree's moist cambium layer, just
beneath the bark, when slight

changes in the earth's magnetic
field pass through the tree.
That field, which covers the
globe from pole to pole, consists
of the lines of force that keep
compass needles pointing north.
Slight flutters in these forces seem
to be caused by, among other
things, sunspots.
What's so important about elec
trified acorns?
"It may not improve the gas
mileage of your car, but it's still
very interesting," Fraser-Smith
says.
"The frequency of the current
(which is so low that it peaks and
troughs only once each second)
happens to correspond with
human brain waves," Fraser-
Smith says.
While he is not suggesting that
trees have brain waves of their
own, he does think that humans
might be occasionally acting as
antennas as well.
"They could still detect brain
waves in Karen Quinlan (the 24-
year-old New Jersey woman who
has lain comatose for three years).
My theory is that these could be
just magnetic signals or coming
from equipment in her hospital
room."
He also thinks the electrical

flow may have some effects on the
growth of the tree, and that
examination of the tree rings
might show variations in climate
caused by natural or man-made
magnetic sources.
"It's important to understand
the dynamics, so that we might be
able to control them. Perhaps the
variations affect crops. That's a
long shot, though."
The navy has a practical interest
in his work as well. They're spon
soring it.
"Those ULF waves can penet
rate very deep into the earth and
sea, so the navy is interested in
their use for communication. I
don'tthink it'sgoing to beof great
use to the navy — there aren't a
great number of trees at sea — but
they seem happy.
"Everyone asks me how I got
interested in trees, including my
wife. It all started on quite a diffe
rent topic; I'd simply been in
terested in the fact that trees have
electrical properties.
"I came across some articles by
the late H.S. Burr of Yale. He had
been sticking silver nails into a
maple tree and recording the
changes in electrical flow over 11
years."

frequency pulses from the earth's magnetic field as the

laboratory, who discovered the oak tree's abilities, is

What intrigued him most was
Burr's very last paper, which
showed that a severe lightning
storm had immediate effects on a
tree's electrical properties.
Because Fraser-Smith believed
that lightning somehow causes
disturbances in magnetic fields,
he decided to find out whether
the tree was reacting to the field
rather than to the lightning.
"This made me go out sticking
nails in trees."
He chose a tall oak growing in
the foothills near the golf course,
close to the antenna and record
ing equipment he usually used to
detect UL F waves. He removed
the antenna, a 6-foot steel rod
wound with 20,000 turns of
aluminum wire, which "cost sev
eral thousand dollars in design
and manufacture," and plugged
the recorders into the tree's nails.
"We began recording ULF activ
ity immediately," he says."And all
it took was a high-fidelity
amplifier that can deal with low
frequencies, a recorder and a
tree."
The first recordings were un
usual. Unlike natural signals,
which "come in bursts usually at
night, maybe eight nights a
month," these signals occurred
only from about 5 a.m. until mid
night.

"We were picking up BART on
our tree," says Fraser-Smith. "The
daily schedule starts just before 5
a.m. and the long electrical track
—100 miles of conductor— was
a huge ULF antenna giving off
strong magnetic variations."
After verifying that it was the
tree and not the rest of the electri
cal setup that was acting as an an
tenna, Fraser-Smith left the re
corder running around the clock.
The tree was picking up almost
exactly the same signals as a con
ventional antenna nearby, receiv
ing not only BART and the earth's
magnetic field but also distant
lightning and electrical equip
ment being switched on and off.
Why couldn't he use any con
ductor as an antenna?
"You can't have too good a
conductor for this," he says.
"They tend to short out. The cam
bium layer of a tree with all its
moisture and minerals has about
the right amount of resistance.
But the tree has to be alive. If the
tree dies, it dries out and won't
conduct anything."
He says that although his own
tree research is completed, he
"would like to see more done. I
think it would be a good student
project, for someone who knows
more about trees.
"It is sort of a strange thing," he
admits.

Antony Fraser-Smith, a radios
cience researcher investigating
ultra-low frequency (ULF) radio
waves, made the discovery two
years ago. On a hunch, he ham
mered two nails into an oak tree in
the foothills, hooked up his de
tecting equipment to these crude
electrodes, and found an electric
current flowing through the tree.
His work was reported in the
Feb. 16 issue of Nature, a British
scientific journal. A photograph
of one of Stanford's oak trees
graces the cover of that issue.
Electricity is generated
whenever the magnetic field pas
sing through an electrical conduc
tor is altered. That's why a bell
rings when you walk through an
airport security machine wearing
a heavy metal belt buckle.
In the tree's case, Fraser-Smith
says, the current is created in the
tree's moist cambium layer, just
beneath the bark, when slight

changes in the earth's magnetic
field pass through the tree.
That field, which covers the
globe from pole to pole, consists
of the lines of force that keep
compass needles pointing north.
Slight flutters in these forces seem
to be caused by, among other
things, sunspots.
What's so important about elec
trified acorns?
"It may not improve the gas
mileage of your car, but it's still
very interesting," Fraser-Smith
says.
"The frequency of the current
(which is so low that it peaks and
troughs only once each second)
happens to correspond with
human brain waves," Fraser-
Smith says.
While he is not suggesting that
trees have brain waves of their
own, he does think that humans
might be occasionally acting as
antennas as well.
"They could still detect brain
waves in Karen Quinlan (the 24-
year-old New Jersey woman who
has lain comatose for three years).
My theory is that these could be
just magnetic signals or coming
from equipment in her hospital
room."
He also thinks the electrical

flow may have some effects on the
growth of the tree, and that
examination of the tree rings
might show variations in climate
caused by natural or man-made
magnetic sources.
"It's important to understand
the dynamics, so that we might be
able to control them. Perhaps the
variations affect crops. That's a
long shot, though."
The navy has a practical interest
in his work as well. They're spon
soring it.
"Those ULF waves can penet
rate very deep into the earth and
sea, so the navy is interested in
their use for communication. I
don'tthink it'sgoing to beof great
use to the navy — there aren't a
great number of trees at sea — but
they seem happy.
"Everyone asks me how I got
interested in trees, including my
wife. It all started on quite a diffe
rent topic; I'd simply been in
terested in the fact that trees have
electrical properties.
"I came across some articles by
the late H.S. Burr of Yale. He had
been sticking silver nails into a
maple tree and recording the
changes in electrical flow over 11
years."

laboratory, who discovered the oak tree's abilities, is

What intrigued him most was
Burr's very last paper, which
showed that a severe lightning
storm had immediate effects on a
tree's electrical properties.
Because Fraser-Smith believed
that lightning somehow causes
disturbances in magnetic fields,
he decided to find out whether
the tree was reacting to the field
rather than to the lightning.
"This made me go out sticking
nails in trees."
He chose a tall oak growing in
the foothills near the golf course,
close to the antenna and record
ing equipment he usually used to
detect UL F waves. He removed
the antenna, a 6-foot steel rod
wound with 20,000 turns of
aluminum wire, which "cost sev
eral thousand dollars in design
and manufacture," and plugged
the recorders into the tree's nails.
"We began recording ULF activ
ity immediately," he says."And all
it took was a high-fidelity
amplifier that can deal with low
frequencies, a recorder and a
tree."
The first recordings were un
usual. Unlike natural signals,
which "come in bursts usually at
night, maybe eight nights a
month," these signals occurred
only from about 5 a.m. until mid
night.

"We were picking up BART on
our tree," says Fraser-Smith. "The
daily schedule starts just before 5
a.m. and the long electrical track
—100 miles of conductor— was
a huge ULF antenna giving off
strong magnetic variations."
After verifying that it was the
tree and not the rest of the electri
cal setup that was acting as an an
tenna, Fraser-Smith left the re
corder running around the clock.
The tree was picking up almost
exactly the same signals as a con
ventional antenna nearby, receiv
ing not only BART and the earth's
magnetic field but also distant
lightning and electrical equip
ment being switched on and off.
Why couldn't he use any con
ductor as an antenna?
"You can't have too good a
conductor for this," he says.
"They tend to short out. The cam
bium layer of a tree with all its
moisture and minerals has about
the right amount of resistance.
But the tree has to be alive. If the
tree dies, it dries out and won't
conduct anything."
He says that although his own
tree research is completed, he
"would like to see more done. I
think it would be a good student
project, for someone who knows
more about trees.
"It is sort of a strange thing," he
admits.

electrodes, and found an electric
current flowing through the tree.
His work was reported in the
Feb. 16 issue of Nature, a British
scientific journal. A photograph
of one of Stanford's oak trees
graces the cover of that issue.
Electricity is generated
whenever the magnetic field pas
sing through an electrical conduc
tor is altered. That's why a bell
rings when you walk through an
airport security machine wearing
a heavy metal belt buckle.
In the tree's case, Fraser-Smith
says, the current is created in the
tree's moist cambium layer, just
beneath the bark, when slight

changes in the earth's magnetic
field pass through the tree.
That field, which covers the
globe from pole to pole, consists
of the lines of force that keep
compass needles pointing north.
Slight flutters in these forces seem
to be caused by, among other
things, sunspots.
What's so important about elec
trified acorns?
"It may not improve the gas
mileage of your car, but it's still
very interesting," Fraser-Smith
says.
"The frequency of the current
(which is so low that it peaks and
troughs only once each second)
happens to correspond with
human brain waves," Fraser-
Smith says.
While he is not suggesting that
trees have brain waves of their
own, he does think that humans
might be occasionally acting as
antennas as well.
"They could still detect brain
waves in Karen Quinlan (the 24-
year-old New Jersey woman who
has lain comatose for three years).
My theory is that these could be
just magnetic signals or coming
from equipment in her hospital
room."
He also thinks the electrical

flow may have some effects on the
growth of the tree, and that
examination of the tree rings
might show variations in climate
caused by natural or man-made
magnetic sources.
"It's important to understand
the dynamics, so that we might be
able to control them. Perhaps the
variations affect crops. That's a
long shot, though."
The navy has a practical interest
in his work as well. They're spon
soring it.
"Those ULF waves can penet
rate very deep into the earth and
sea, so the navy is interested in
their use for communication. I
don'tthink it'sgoing to beof great
use to the navy — there aren't a
great number of trees at sea — but
they seem happy.
"Everyone asks me how I got
interested in trees, including my
wife. It all started on quite a diffe
rent topic; I'd simply been in
terested in the fact that trees have
electrical properties.
"I came across some articles by
the late H.S. Burr of Yale. He had
been sticking silver nails into a
maple tree and recording the
changes in electrical flow over 11
years."


You can't fool Mother Nature. That oak tree in the
background is just as skillful at detecting ultra-low
frequency pulses from the earth's magnetic field as the
laboriously-produced, aluminum and steel antenna in

the foreground. Antony Fraser-Smith of the radioscience
laboratory, who discovered the oak tree's abilities, is
holding tne antenna.
What intrigued him most was
Burr's very last paper, which
showed that a severe lightning
storm had immediate effects on a
tree's electrical properties.
Because Fraser-Smith believed
that lightning somehow causes
disturbances in magnetic fields,
he decided to find out whether
the tree was reacting to the field
rather than to the lightning.
"This made me go out sticking
nails in trees."
He chose a tall oak growing in
the foothills near the golf course,
close to the antenna and record
ing equipment he usually used to
detect UL F waves. He removed
the antenna, a 6-foot steel rod
wound with 20,000 turns of
aluminum wire, which "cost sev
eral thousand dollars in design
and manufacture," and plugged
the recorders into the tree's nails.
"We began recording ULF activ
ity immediately," he says."And all
it took was a high-fidelity
amplifier that can deal with low
frequencies, a recorder and a
tree."
The first recordings were un
usual. Unlike natural signals,
which "come in bursts usually at
night, maybe eight nights a
month," these signals occurred
only from about 5 a.m. until mid
night.

"We were picking up BART on
our tree," says Fraser-Smith. "The
daily schedule starts just before 5
a.m. and the long electrical track
—100 miles of conductor— was
a huge ULF antenna giving off
strong magnetic variations."
After verifying that it was the
tree and not the rest of the electri
cal setup that was acting as an an
tenna, Fraser-Smith left the re
corder running around the clock.
The tree was picking up almost
exactly the same signals as a con
ventional antenna nearby, receiv
ing not only BART and the earth's
magnetic field but also distant
lightning and electrical equip
ment being switched on and off.
Why couldn't he use any con
ductor as an antenna?
"You can't have too good a
conductor for this," he says.
"They tend to short out. The cam
bium layer of a tree with all its
moisture and minerals has about
the right amount of resistance.
But the tree has to be alive. If the
tree dies, it dries out and won't
conduct anything."
He says that although his own
tree research is completed, he
"would like to see more done. I
think it would be a good student
project, for someone who knows
more about trees.
"It is sort of a strange thing," he
admits.
