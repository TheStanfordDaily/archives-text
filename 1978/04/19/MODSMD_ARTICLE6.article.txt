# Oak trees, lightning, magnetic fields: scientist finds connection
## 
### David Ansley 
That oak tree in your front yard
may be silently monitoring the
earth's magnetic field, a re
searcher here has discovered.
The tree may be acting as a giant
antenna as sensitive as custom
made detectors costing
thousands of dollars, he says.
Antony Fraser-Smith, a radios
cience researcher investigating
ultra-low frequency (ULF) radio
waves, made the discovery two
years ago. On a hunch, he ham
mered two nails into an oak tree in
the foothills, hooked up his de
tecting equipment to these crude
electrodes, and found an electric
current flowing through the tree.
His work was reported in the
Feb. 16 issue of Nature, a British
scientific journal. A photograph
of one of Stanford's oak trees
graces the cover of that issue.
Electricity is generated
whenever the magnetic field pas
sing through an electrical conduc
tor is altered. That's why a bell
rings when you walk through an
airport security machine wearing
a heavy metal belt buckle.
In the tree's case, Fraser-Smith
says, the current is created in the
tree's moist cambium layer, just
beneath the bark, when slight

changes in the earth's magnetic
field pass through the tree.
That field, which covers the
globe from pole to pole, consists
of the lines of force that keep
compass needles pointing north.
Slight flutters in these forces seem
to be caused by, among other
things, sunspots.
What's so important about elec
trified acorns?
"It may not improve the gas
mileage of your car, but it's still
very interesting," Fraser-Smith
says.
"The frequency of the current
(which is so low that it peaks and
troughs only once each second)
happens to correspond with
human brain waves," Fraser-
Smith says.
While he is not suggesting that
trees have brain waves of their
own, he does think that humans
might be occasionally acting as
antennas as well.
"They could still detect brain
waves in Karen Quinlan (the 24-
year-old New Jersey woman who
has lain comatose for three years).
My theory is that these could be
just magnetic signals or coming
from equipment in her hospital
room."
He also thinks the electrical

flow may have some effects on the
growth of the tree, and that
examination of the tree rings
might show variations in climate
caused by natural or man-made
magnetic sources.
"It's important to understand
the dynamics, so that we might be
able to control them. Perhaps the
variations affect crops. That's a
long shot, though."
The navy has a practical interest
in his work as well. They're spon
soring it.
"Those ULF waves can penet
rate very deep into the earth and
sea, so the navy is interested in
their use for communication. I
don'tthink it'sgoing to beof great
use to the navy — there aren't a
great number of trees at sea — but
they seem happy.
"Everyone asks me how I got
interested in trees, including my
wife. It all started on quite a diffe
rent topic; I'd simply been in
terested in the fact that trees have
electrical properties.
"I came across some articles by
the late H.S. Burr of Yale. He had
been sticking silver nails into a
maple tree and recording the
changes in electrical flow over 11
years."


You can't fool Mother Nature. That oak tree in the
background is just as skillful at detecting ultra-low
frequency pulses from the earth's magnetic field as the
laboriously-produced, aluminum and steel antenna in
