This campus shows a remarkable tendency
to be closed-minded.
Every left-of-center group on campus has
slaved to produce a weeklong attempt to dis
cuss alternatives to our ideologies, and most
of us ignore it.
Just because the organizers call themselves
"progressive."
It seems to me that a lot of people used to be
proud of the fact that they themselves were
liberal.
At the very least, we should all take advan
tage of the exposure to views and the chance
to consider social change that Disorientation
Week offers.
For example, I strongly recommend reading
the "Disorienting Stanford" publication,

especially its analysis of traditional and alter
native campus media. It points out a few
things you probably won't read here.
Angela Davis, Harvey Milk and many films
and workshops are past, but the next five days
of events include socialist economist Paul
Sweezy in Cubberley at noon today, an excel
lent BBC documentary, "The War Game" in
the Coffee House tonight at 7, Huey Newton
Friday night and Stokely Carmichael Sunday
night. These are in addition to films, speakers
and discussions each day all over campus.
They would all be much more than just a
good study break.
