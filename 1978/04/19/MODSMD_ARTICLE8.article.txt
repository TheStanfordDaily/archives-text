Ali Geranmayh's letter (Daily, Mar. 1) contains inaccu
rate allegations regarding the Sami Esmail case. The fol
lowing facts obtained from official sources, will clarify
the true context of Esmail's arrest:
—Esmail was arrested on December 21,1977 on arrival
at Ben-Gurion Airport. He did not request to be visited
by a U.S. Consular official and the first such visit did, in
fact, take place on December 25 at the initiative of the
police. Since then he has been visited regularly.
(Geranmayh implies that no one was allowed to visit
Esmail until December 28.)
—During questioning by the police he admitted the
following facts:
a.) In 1976 he was recruited in the United States to the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and pro
vided with a false name.
b.) In August 1976 he was sent, at the expense of the
"front," to an intensive training camp in Libya which
lasted several weeks. As part of the course he was
trained by Libyan instructors in the use of explosives, in
the use of arms and hand grenades, and in the prepara
tion of explosives for the purposes of sabotage and
terror.
—Contrary to allegations, Esmail was not tortured by
the police, neither has he claimed this. He also signed a
declaration on January 11, 1978 under the terms of the
Privacy Act, 1974, allowing the U.S. authorities to release
this information to all interested persons. It should also
be noted that as a citizen of the United States, a state
maintaining full diplomatic relations with the State of
Israel, he was not entitled to a visit by the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Such visits by the ICRC are specifically governed by
Article 126 of the Geneva Convention relative to the
Treatment of Prisoners of War and restricted by that
article to visits to "prisoners of war." The terms of the
Red Cross Conventions are applicable to situations of
war between parties to the Conventions or to actions by
military authorities. The case of Esmail does not come
into either of these categories.

—As is well known, the Popular Front is a member of
the rejectionist front which has carried out, and con
tinues to carry out, acts of sabotage and murder in Israel
and other parts of the world. Among the more notable of
its crimes are the attack on an El Al plane in Zurich,
February 18, 1969, the hijacking of Swissair and TWA
planes to Zerqa (Jordan) and the hijacking of a Pan Am
plane to Cairo and its destruction on September 6,1970,
and the mass murder at Lod Airport on May 30, 1972 in
which 24 persons were killed and 80 wounded.
—The course in which Ismail took part trained him
operationally to participate in actions of similar nature.
A State Department official, quoted by the New York
Post on April 6,1977 confirmed that "American residents
of Arab descent have gone overseas to be trained as
terrorists and have then returned home." Apparently
Esmail was one of "200-300" such "American residents"
who underwent training in the terror camps of the
"front."
—Among the many declarations of violent intent by
leaders of the "front" one of the most recent by George
Habash rejected the Sadat peace initiative and promised
that the terrorists would "pour across all the borders (of
Israel).. .they will strike in Jerusalem and Haifa" (Dec. 4,
1977).
The relevant sections of the law under which Esmail is
indic.ed are: "Membership in an illegal organization —
an offense under section 85, paragraph 1a of the De
fense (Emergency) Regulations of 1945;
Contact with an enemy agent — an offense under
section 24, paragraph of the Criminal Law (Security of
the State, Foreign Relations, and Official Secrets) 1957."
Esmail will receive a fair trial in a parliamentary democ
racy whose judiciary system is comparable to that of the
United States. It should be noted that as an act of
humanitarianism, Esmail was allowed to attend his
father's funeral notwithstanding his status as an indicted
terrorist.
