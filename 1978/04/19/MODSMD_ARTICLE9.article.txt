Beer ads protested
I am writing in protest of several
beer ads that you have run lately,
most particularly ads on page 10
(Daily, April 7). Many women are
ti red of seeing women's bodies used
to sell beer. Furthermore, I believe
the Daily has had a policy on adver
tisements that would eliminate such
exploitative use; has this policy been
discontinued?
While I have an audience, I'd also
like to complain about your sports
headlines. Why are men's teams al
ways "Cards," "Stanford," "Net
ters," or whatnot, and the women's
teams differentiated by sex (Wo
men's booters," etc.)? April 7 for
example two items were headlined:
"Lacrosse hosts fete" and "Women's
lacrosse plays." This implies that the
men's teams are the norms and cent
ral focus, while women's teams are
abnormal and secondary.
The ASSU and Faculty Senate have
both passed resolutions condemning
sexist language and concepts in their
publications. I hope that the Daily
will also adopt these resolutions and
try to understand the spirit that moti
vates them.
As an added incentive, I will con
fess that every quarter that the Daily
outrages me in this fashion I have
requested a fee assessment refund.
At this rate I shall end up doing it
again.

(Editor's note: The Daily's advertis
ing policy prohibits any ad "whose
content tends to incite to violence, is
obscene or libelous, or casts asper
sions on individuals or groups be
cause of race, religion, sex, sexual
preference, national origin, age, or
physical disability."
This particular ad's adherence to
that policy was questioned before it
ran. I actually looked up "asper
sions" in a dictionary to help reach a
decision. t
In my judgment (yes, the decision
was personal, and it could easily
change with editors), the Steinlager
ad, while not using the most subtle of
,persuasive ploys, did not use any
"false charges damaging to the repu
tation" of women, either in the
photograph or in the copy.
There is no policy concerning
exploitation per se.
As for the Daily's sports headlines,
the sports department has been at
tempting to differentiate between
men's and women's teams in a sport
while at the same time not giving a

false impression from a headline.
Though the department will try to use
both "men" and "women" for a sport
or use neither word, the problem's
solution is not as easy as it seems -
some women have expressed disple
asure at the use of one sports
nickname which, while innocuous if
it ends with "men," is upsetting if it
ends with "women.")
Ignoring the issue
One hundred people went to the
lobby of Hoover Tower last Thurs
day, April 13, to ask Glenn Campbell,
director of the Hoover Institution
and a UC Regent, how he would re
commend the University of Califor
nia vote on a Bank of America proxy
calling for an end ttf loans to South
Africa. All regents had to have mailed
their recommendations by last Fri
day.
Not only did Campbell refuse to
come out and answer questions, but
I was appalled to read in Friday's
Daily that he later said "I don't even
know what I'm supposed to be vot
ing on."
How did you vote your proxy
Campbell? Did you even take the
time to consider it? How can some
one of such supposed prestige ig
nore an issue that puts on the line the
continued enslavement of 16 million
South Africans?

A recent Daily article on political
activism at Stanford placed New Di
rections on an ideological spectrum.
The organization as a whole is dedi
cated to raising the community's un
derstanding of global issues and
foreign policy as a first step toward
broader citizen participation in gov
ernmental decision-making.
One way we do this is by publish
ing New Directions, which is de
signed to provide its readers with a
framework for understanding certain
global issues and foreign policies.
We consider our articles to be of the
news analysis order and not of an
editorial order.
We do not say that a policy should
be a certain way, rather, we analyze
an issue and present the most sig
nificant concepts, questions and
facts. Admittedly, no analysis is
completely objective but we do the
best we can to preserve the distinc
tion between "is" and "ought" and
to be as consistent as possible.

derstanding of global issues and
foreign policy as a first step toward
broader citizen participation in gov
ernmental decision-making.
One way we do this is by publish
ing New Directions, which is de
signed to provide its readers with a
framework for understanding certain
global issues and foreign policies.
We consider our articles to be of the
news analysis order and not of an
editorial order.
We do not say that a policy should
be a certain way, rather, we analyze
an issue and present the most sig
nificant concepts, questions and
facts. Admittedly, no analysis is
completely objective but we do the
best we can to preserve the distinc
tion between "is" and "ought" and
to be as consistent as possible.

Beer ads protested
I am writing in protest of several
beer ads that you have run lately,
most particularly ads on page 10
(Daily, April 7). Many women are
ti red of seeing women's bodies used
to sell beer. Furthermore, I believe
the Daily has had a policy on adver
tisements that would eliminate such
exploitative use; has this policy been
discontinued?
While I have an audience, I'd also
like to complain about your sports
headlines. Why are men's teams al
ways "Cards," "Stanford," "Net
ters," or whatnot, and the women's
teams differentiated by sex (Wo
men's booters," etc.)? April 7 for
example two items were headlined:
"Lacrosse hosts fete" and "Women's
lacrosse plays." This implies that the
men's teams are the norms and cent
ral focus, while women's teams are
abnormal and secondary.
The ASSU and Faculty Senate have
both passed resolutions condemning
sexist language and concepts in their
publications. I hope that the Daily
will also adopt these resolutions and
try to understand the spirit that moti
vates them.
As an added incentive, I will con
fess that every quarter that the Daily
outrages me in this fashion I have
requested a fee assessment refund.
At this rate I shall end up doing it
again.

(Editor's note: The Daily's advertis
ing policy prohibits any ad "whose
content tends to incite to violence, is
obscene or libelous, or casts asper
sions on individuals or groups be
cause of race, religion, sex, sexual
preference, national origin, age, or
physical disability."
This particular ad's adherence to
that policy was questioned before it
ran. I actually looked up "asper
sions" in a dictionary to help reach a
decision. t
In my judgment (yes, the decision
was personal, and it could easily
change with editors), the Steinlager
ad, while not using the most subtle of
,persuasive ploys, did not use any
"false charges damaging to the repu
tation" of women, either in the
photograph or in the copy.
There is no policy concerning
exploitation per se.
As for the Daily's sports headlines,
the sports department has been at
tempting to differentiate between
men's and women's teams in a sport
while at the same time not giving a

false impression from a headline.
Though the department will try to use
both "men" and "women" for a sport
or use neither word, the problem's
solution is not as easy as it seems -
some women have expressed disple
asure at the use of one sports
nickname which, while innocuous if
it ends with "men," is upsetting if it
ends with "women.")
Ignoring the issue
One hundred people went to the
lobby of Hoover Tower last Thurs
day, April 13, to ask Glenn Campbell,
director of the Hoover Institution
and a UC Regent, how he would re
commend the University of Califor
nia vote on a Bank of America proxy
calling for an end ttf loans to South
Africa. All regents had to have mailed
their recommendations by last Fri
day.
Not only did Campbell refuse to
come out and answer questions, but
I was appalled to read in Friday's
Daily that he later said "I don't even
know what I'm supposed to be vot
ing on."
How did you vote your proxy
Campbell? Did you even take the
time to consider it? How can some
one of such supposed prestige ig
nore an issue that puts on the line the
continued enslavement of 16 million
South Africans?
