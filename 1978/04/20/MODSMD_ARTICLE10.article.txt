# Wright regains eagerness to win

"You've got to believe in your
self. "
â€”Perry Wright
Stanford tennis team

Perry Wright has come a long
way. Three years ago as a
freshman, Wright was 11th
man and his chances of ever
making the varsity starting
lineup looked bleak. Last year
he established himself as one
of the top collegiate players in
the nation, one with an outside
shot at the national title.
What has caused this
change? It all goes back to that
old phrase that tennis is 90 per
cent mental. In Wright's case it
was almost 100 per cent men
tal. His mental attitude about
the game has taken a drastic
turn in the last three years.
"As a freshman, I was unsure
of my goals," points out
Wright. "I had played tennis in
tensely since I was nine or 10,
so I was kind of mentally
burned out. It was weird, I kept
asking myself do I really want
to play tennis? My incentive
was gone, my confidence was
shot, I had no belief in myself. I
was a wreck."
Coach Dick Gould added,
"Perry joined a very experi
enced team, almost the same
team that won the national title
the year before. He was com
ing off a bad summer tourna
ment season, add that to the
fact that it was his first time out
on his own and you have a few
of the things going on in his
mind."
After a disappointing
freshman year, Wright found
himself in Texas trying out for
the Junior Davis Cup team. In
his first match he led 5-0 in the
third set but eventually lost the
match.
"I should have won easily,"
laughed Wright looking back at
the situation. "I was a far better
player, but mentally I killed
myself."
At this point Wright made
the decision that probably
changed his tennis career. He
gave up tennis and spent the
summer working in his
brother's law firm.
"I was just burned out. I
needed a break from tennis,"
Wright explained.
In the fall Wright returned to
the Farm out of shape but with
a new outlook on the game.
"I had a renewed eagerness
for tennis. I once again had my
competitive fire back. Any
body can win when they're
playing well. It's winning when
you're playing bad that shows
you've got it together men
tally," said Wright.
Wright got back into things
as a sophomore claiming the
No. 8 spot. When Nick Saviano
and Gene Mayer opted for the
pro ranks, he had his chance.
"I was psyched," said
Wright. "I saw this as my
chance to play again and this

time I felt I was mentally
ready."
Wright played amazingly
well, compiling a 9-1 singles
record and teaming up with
Matt Mitchell for a 6-1 doubles
record. Although he played
very solidly in singles, he
gained greater recognition in
doubles. The Wright-Mitchell
tandem registered wins over
Peter Fleming and Brian
Teacher (the top college dou
bles team in the nation that
year), but the high point came
in an exhibition match against
the World Team Tennis Golden
Gaters. The Stanford duo
knocked off Tom Okker and
Frew McMillan, who were both
ranked among the top five
doubles teams in the world.
This earned them a No. 7 seed
ing in the NCAA doubles tour
nament.
But on tournament day
Wright was very tight, it was
windy, and by his own self ad
mission he was not mentally
ready to play. Mitchell and
Wright were upset in the first
round.
Last year Wright blossomed
as a singles player. He qualified
for a pro tournament in La
Costa, had two dual match
wins over NCAA Finalist Tony
Graham, and reached the finals
of the Northern California In
tercollegiates. He earned the
No. 14 seeding in the national
championships and was
named to the All American
team. He continued his pro
wess in doubles, winning the
Pac-8 Invitational, Northern
California Intercollegiates, Na
tional Amateur Doubles, and
earned the No. 1 seeding in the
NCAA doubles tournament.
Wright again found hard
luck, though. Being asked to
play his singles match at 8 a.m.
on the day after winning the
national team championship
was too tough for Wright,
and he was upset in the
first round. The hot team of
UCLA's John Austin and Bruce
Nichols were too much for a
down Wright and a tired
Mitchell, and they were tagged
in the quarter-finals.
This year Wright has again
proved that he is a top player.
Before a recent knee injury,
Wright had compiled a 5-1 sing
les record, won the Northern
California Singles title by beat
ing teammate Bill Maze, and
had registered a win over Larry
Gottfried, Trinity's No. 1
player.
Wright's plans for the fu
ture?
"I'm turning pro in June,
after the NCAAs," announced
Wright. "My goal is to win a
major professional champion
ship. Law school is in the fu
ture, but not in the too-distant
future. I'm going to give tennis
a serious shot, because I be
lieve in myself."
