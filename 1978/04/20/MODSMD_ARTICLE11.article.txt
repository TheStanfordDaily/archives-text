## Teltscher to turn pro 
### Jeff Brandon 
Elliot Teltscher is not follow
ing in the footsteps of Jimmy
Connors-and Billy Martin. It is
true that the trio has many
similarities. All three grew up
in southern California;
Teltscher and Martin even at
tended the same high school.
Another similarity is that all
three were highly sought after
prep stars. All three opted for
UCLA, Connors and Martin
turning pro after their
freshman year. After the NCAA
tournament Teltscher also
plans to join the pro ranks. All
that's missing is the NCAA sing
les championship that both
Connors and Martin won. That
is always the tough part, espe
cially with this year's field
featuring McEnroe. But
Teltscher shuns the compari
sons.'

"I do my own thing," re
marked Teltscher, "I made all
my own decisions. It just hap
pens to be the same thing
Connors and Martin did."
"He's in the same class as
those two," comments UCLA
coach Glen Bassett. "Elliot's a

super hard worker, and he gets
the most out of his game."
Many references have been
made to the Teltscher-
McEnroe "rivalry," but
Teltscher insists it doesn't
exist.
"We must have played about
15 or 20 times. It's not really a
rivalry, at least I don't think of it
as one. He does his thing and I
do mine. That's all," insisted
Teltscher.
Since Wimbledon the pair
has met three times, McEnroe
has taken the decision twice.
At the U.S. Open at Forest
Hills, McEnroe bested

Teltscher in front of 15,000 fams
in center court. A month later
the two tangled again, this time
in Teltscher's
Teltscher dealt McEnroe the
loss on this occasion. Two
weeks ago Teltscher was up a
set, a break, and had a match
point on McEnroe. McEnroe
then hit a brilliant backhand
cross-court to earn a service
break. This swung the momen
tum to McEnroe, and he con
trolled the match to the finish.
Teltscher plans to change his
strategy this time as the court
surface will be much fastc^

than that of UCLA's tennis
stadium.
"I'll have to practice in
Maples first before I decide
how I'll play him," points out
Teltscher. "I've been practic
ing indoors anyway for the
Grand Prix tournament in San
Jose so I hope there won't be a
big difference."
Teltscher's playing style is
not what you would expect of
someone from California. He
'looks like he was raised playing

on the slow clay courts of
Florida rather than the hard
cement native to California.
"Elliot's basically a defensive
player," commented Basset.
"He has no real weaknesses,
but his main asset is he plays a
good defense. He's a scram
bler. He gets to a lot of balls."
"I was really impressed,"
added Stanford coach Dick
Gould. "He moved better than
I thought he would. The guy's
an extremely intense com
petitor. He's going to be a

super player.
"I've enjoyed my year here at
UCLA. It's been a fun experi
ence," reflected Teltscher.
"Coach Basset has helped me
improve my tennis game. I
have no regrets on attending
college. But now it's best for
my career for me to move on."
So although Elliot Teltscher
does not want to be compared
with Connors and Martin, if he
continues his winning ways,
the comparisons are inevita

stadium.
"I'll have to practice in
Maples first before I decide
how I'll play him," points out
Teltscher. "I've been practic
ing indoors anyway for the
Grand Prix tournament in San
Jose so I hope there won't be a
big difference."
Teltscher's playing style is
not what you would expect of
someone from California. He
'looks like he was raised playing

on the slow clay courts of
Florida rather than the hard
cement native to California.
"Elliot's basically a defensive
player," commented Basset.
"He has no real weaknesses,
but his main asset is he plays a
good defense. He's a scram
bler. He gets to a lot of balls."
"I was really impressed,"
added Stanford coach Dick
Gould. "He moved better than
I thought he would. The guy's
an extremely intense com
petitor. He's going to be a

super player.
"I've enjoyed my year here at
UCLA. It's been a fun experi
ence," reflected Teltscher.
"Coach Basset has helped me
improve my tennis game. I
have no regrets on attending
college. But now it's best for
my career for me to move on."
So although Elliot Teltscher
does not want to be compared
with Connors and Martin, if he
continues his winning ways,
the comparisons are inevita
ble.

Elliot Teltscher, a UCLA freshman, prepares to step into a backhand.
Teltscher recently lost a tight match to Stanford's John McEnroe, 2-6,
7-5, 6-3.
Elliot Teltscher is not follow
ing in the footsteps of Jimmy
Connors-and Billy Martin. It is
true that the trio has many
similarities. All three grew up
in southern California;
Teltscher and Martin even at
tended the same high school.
Another similarity is that all
three were highly sought after
prep stars. All three opted for
UCLA, Connors and Martin
turning pro after their
freshman year. After the NCAA
tournament Teltscher also
plans to join the pro ranks. All
that's missing is the NCAA sing
les championship that both
Connors and Martin won. That
is always the tough part, espe
cially with this year's field
featuring McEnroe. But
Teltscher shuns the compari
sons.'

"I do my own thing," re
marked Teltscher, "I made all
my own decisions. It just hap
pens to be the same thing
Connors and Martin did."
"He's in the same class as
those two," comments UCLA
coach Glen Bassett. "Elliot's a

super hard worker, and he gets
the most out of his game."
Many references have been
made to the Teltscher-
McEnroe "rivalry," but
Teltscher insists it doesn't
exist.
"We must have played about
15 or 20 times. It's not really a
rivalry, at least I don't think of it
as one. He does his thing and I
do mine. That's all," insisted
Teltscher.
Since Wimbledon the pair
has met three times, McEnroe
has taken the decision twice.
At the U.S. Open at Forest
Hills, McEnroe bested

Teltscher in front of 15,000 fams
in center court. A month later
the two tangled again, this time
in Teltscher's
Teltscher dealt McEnroe the
loss on this occasion. Two
weeks ago Teltscher was up a
set, a break, and had a match
point on McEnroe. McEnroe
then hit a brilliant backhand
cross-court to earn a service
break. This swung the momen
tum to McEnroe, and he con
trolled the match to the finish.
Teltscher plans to change his
strategy this time as the court
surface will be much fastc^
