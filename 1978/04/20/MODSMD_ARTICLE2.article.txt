# UCLA, USC to give Cards stern test
## 
### Chris Haft 
The stars will shine indoors
and outdoors at Stanford this
Thursday through Saturday
tennis stars, that is.
Stanford's top-ranked men's
team faces USC (7-5) Thursday
and UCLA (17-1) Saturday,
while the women battle the
Trojans (7-0) Friday.
The top two singles and the
number one doubles will be
played in Maples Pavilion at
6:30 p.m. all three days. Third
through sixth singles and sec
ond and third doubles will
begin at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium at 1 p.m.
The Cardinal men put a 27-
match winning streak on the
line against USC, the last team
to beat Stanford.
Stanford has captured 11 of
the past 12 matches with the
Trojans. The last one might
have been the most difficult of
all, when the Cards edged USC
5-4 in Los Angeles on April 7.
USC dangerous
"USC is dangerous, well
coached, and quite explosive,"
said Stanford men's coach Dick
Gould. "They beat SMU 8-1
(Stanford defeated SMU by just
6-3), and that match shows how
well they can play."
The Trojans are led by
freshman RobertVan't Hof, the
defending national 21 and
under champion, and Chris
Lewis, an NCAA semi-finalist a
year ago.

Stanford's own freshman
star, John McEnroe, opposes
Van't Hof, while All-American
Bill Maze meets Lewis.
However, the real show
down comes Saturday when
the Cards meet UCLA. Stan
ford handed the Bruins their
only loss, topping them 5-4 the
day after the USC squeaker.
"UCLA will be coming at us,"
Gould said. "They are the team
to beat. Not only will the match
be a possible preview of the
national championship, it
could be the best match we've
had at Stanford."
The tentative pairings re
semble a heavyweight champ
ionship fight, with strength
versus strength all the way
down the line.
McEnroe, currently ranked
15th in the world, faces Bruin
freshman Eliot Teltscher in the
No. 1 singles. "Hie Nastase
calls Teltscher the best young
player in the United States,"
Gould commented.
Teltscher's only loss in 14
si ngles matches came to McEn
roe in Los Angeles,2-6,7-5,6-3.
The pair have split their last two
matches.

Playing No. 2 singles for
UCLA is John Austin, who faces
Maze. According to Gould,
Austin has defeated the likes of
Tom Gorman and Dennis
Ralston, not to mention Stan

ford's own Matt Mitchell and
Maze.
Shoot-out
The No. 1 doubles should be
a shoot-out, as the undefeated
duos of McEnroe-Maze and
Austin-Bruce Nichols square
off.
The No. 3 singles will be a
rematch of the 1977 NCAA fi
nals, as Stanford's Mitchell
faces Tony Graham. Other
tough matchups include Perry
Wright against Nichols (17-0)
and Card Peter Rennert against
Robbie Ventnor (13-1), a South
African Davis Cup veteran.
Women's coach Anne Gould
notes a similar wealth of
talented competition for the
women's match against de
fending national champion
USC, undefeated in its last 27
matches.
"There really isn't much dif
ference from No. 1 to No. 4
everybody is about the same
caliber," she said. "I feel my
girls have this strong quality
from 1 to 4, too."
Playing the No. 1 and the No.
2 singles matches for Stanford
will be freshman Kathy Jordan
and sister Barbara Jordan, a
junior and two-time Ail-
American.
Their opposition has not yet
been selected, but it will come
from this fine group: Lea An
tonoplis (No. 26 in the female
amateur ranks), Stacy Margolin

(No. 32), Barbara Hallquist and
Sheila Mclnerney.
Doubles highlight
' The highlight of the match
should come when Stanford's
two-time defending champ
ions Diane Morrison and Susie
Hagey meet All-Americans
Hallquist and Mclnerney in a
repeat of the 1977 national col
legiate doubles final.
"On paper, they're stronger

than we are," Anne Could ad
mits. "If we play well, how
ever, we have an excellent
chance, and I have great confi
dence in my girls."
To add it up, 12 Ail-
Americans, three undefeated
teams, and some of the best
amateurs in the country will be
show-cased here. As Dick
Gould said, "Nobody's gonna
forget this weekend."

cross-court from a USC opponent. Maze, a senior, is holding down the No. 2 position doubles, he holds an unblemished 7-0 mark.
