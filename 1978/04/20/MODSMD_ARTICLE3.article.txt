# McEnroe knows he can win
## Wimbledon semifinalist confident; plans to turn pro this summer 
### Richard Keller 
About the only thing John
McEnroe doesn't have going
for him is that some people
pronounce his name incor
rectly.
McEnroe, pronounced
MacEnroe, is the best part-time
tennis player in the world. For
every two weeks he spends as a
Stanford freshman, he
emerges for one week as a
giant-killer on the pro tennis
circuit. McEnroe is currently
15th in the world.
The summer of '7B proved to
be a dream vacation for McEn
roe. After warming up with
tournament wins over big
name pros Charlie Pasarell and
Bob Lutz, the talented 19-
year-old from Douglastown,
N.Y. decided the fooling
around was over. He smashed,
spun and argued his way
through Europe to the semifi
nals of Wimbledon, where he
pushed Jimmy Connors four
sets before bowing.
In four months McEn roe was
transformed from a junior with
great potential into a pro
caliber netter. If he collected
his winnings since last June, he
would have made his bank
about $50,000 happier. Manuel
Orantes (then No. 7 in the
world), Wojtek Fibak (No. 13),
Harold Solomon (No. 14) and
ex-Stanford star Sandy Mayer
(No. 16) were just a few of
McEnroe's victims. Connors,
llie Nastase and Guillermo
Vilas will also attest to his abil
ity. McEnroe has taken sets
from all three.
Turning pro
According to McEnroe it's
"pretty much probable" he'll
turn pro after the Cards defend
their NCAA crown May 22-29 in
Georgia. Realistically, McEn
roe could make several
hundred thousand dollars in
his first pro season, including
equipment endorsements and
prize money. He and his
father, who will double as a
lawyer and his son's agent,
have already negotiated with
such companies as Adidas,
Wilson and Fila. The latter even
offered to throw a Mercedes
4505 el into the contract.
All this makes one wonder
why McEnroe disregarded the
advice of Vilas, among others,
and elected to attend school.
"It was my decision," he
said. "I wasn't mentally ready
to play 12 months out of the
year. And my parents wanted
me to come to school," he ad
ded.
Stanford men's tennis coach
Dick Gould was obviously
elated that McEnroe chose to
spend a year on the Farm. But
the situation could have been
very disruptive to team unity.
The Stanford team is a collec
tion of extremely talented/ex

tremely proud individuals. It
takes a sincere effort for them
to cohere as a team. If McEnroe
was a cocky, petulant brat as
the papers characterized him
during the summer, his pre
sence would have hurt, rather
than helped the Cardinals.
But that problem did not
exist. Just ask Gould.
"Mac is one of the outstand
ing team players I've ever
had," Gould said. "He would
bust his tail for anyone on the
team. He's the first guy down
on the court to console a
teammate who lost and the first
guy on the court to congratu
late a teammate who won. He
projects an interest in other
people."
Every year Gould has to or
ganize challenge matches to
determine who goes where on
the ladder. Ordinarily, if you
have the defending NCAA sing
les champ (Matt Mitchell) on
your team, you might expect
him to be number one. But
then McEnroe is no ordinary
player.
"On the basis of record
alone, " Gould remarked,
"Mac should have been
number one. But for me to
look the top two returnees in
college tennis (Mitchell and
Pacific-8 conference champ Bill
Maze) in the eye and not give
them a chance. . ."
Challenges
So in early January Mitchell
and Maze got their shots, and
lost in close matches. McEnroe
beat Maze in a tight straight-set
effort, and fought back Mitch
ell 6-3, 2-6, 6-4.
The best way to defeat McEn
roe, Mitchell said, is to "hire an
assassin." Elaborating, he said,
"McEnroe can hurt you with so
many things. He has incredible
control. He hits hard and accu
rate. And the way he plays is
very unorthodox."
McEnroe is unorthodox, but
you can't argue with success.
He doesn't bend his knees
much, often doesn't step into
the ball and uses an incredible
amount of wrist on nearly
every shot. If beginners start
imitating McEnroe, tennis
elbow could be the next
world-wide epidemic.
Watching McEnroe play col
lege tennis is like watching
Connors play singles against an
83-year-old quadriplegic. It
doesn't appear that he is try
ing. He will search out friends
in the crowd and watch his op
ponents' matches in neighbor
ing courts. But there are few
college tennis players who
even approach his level of play.
The number one player for
USC,Robert Van Hoff, can give
you an idea of what "blow out"
means. He was on the wrong
end of a 6-0, 6-0 score to McEn
roe. *

Opponents are both lulled
asleep by McEnroe and scared
to death by him. His forehand
is his most lethal shot. McEn
roe has the patience to sit back
and trade baseline blows with
the best. His collegiate adver
saries usually don't. Back and
forth, back and forth, top spin
after top spin. His opponent is
waiting tor something to hap
pen. WHAP!! With nearly
the same motion as the slower
shots, McEnroe will lambaste a
line drive to the corner of the
court, leaving the other guy in
shockforthe rest of the match.
"I feel confident," said
McEnroe. "I think I do every
thing fairly well. J don't have
any weaknesses. They (oppo
nents) really don't know what
to do. My main problem is I
tend to stray away."
Mentally tough
"First of all," explained
Gould, "he has the mental
toughness of a champion. Mac
has supreme confidence rela
tive to anybody else playing
tennis. It's best reflected in
that he can play an aggressive
game and he can play a patient
game. He has a feel for when to
hit the ball and when to dump
it back."
McEnroe has "tremendous
quickness," Gould said.
"He has great touch and his re
turn of serve is devastating. His
ability to see the ball off other
players' rackets is amazing. His
racket is back on his forehand
almost before his opponent
hits it. On both sides he hits
the ball a little later than most.
He can wait that split second
longer to decide what he's
going to do with it."
McEnroe's serve is the only
weapon in his arsenal that oc
casionally misfires.
Said Gould, "He has a ten
dency to throw the ball (on the
toss) too low and too far out
when he isn't concentrating. It
sometimes results in a low per
centage of his first serves going
in."
For McEnroe, the toughest
match of the year has
been with the flu. When the
Cards flew south over spring
break to play Texas and Trinity
(No. 2 to Stanford last year), he
was crippled with a severe sore
throat and a 103-degree temp
erature. He was bedridden for
the three days between the
matches. But because the Trin
ity match was close, and since
he is a team player, McEnroe
took on Larry Gottfried and lost
his only match of the season
6-3, 7-6 (5-4). Such are the cir
cumstances it takes to beat
him.
Little Nastase
Temperament has been a
problem for McEnroe. During
last surnhVe'r's tourriarhentg/

he had many vocal exchanges
with linesmen. Deserved or
not, the press gave him a repu
tation as a little Nastase.
McEnroe defended himself
by saying, "I stand up for what I
think is right,. I'm not trying to
make a fool out of linesmen.
But they don't admit their mis
takes. They go out of their
minds when you question
them. The pros are trying to
make a living."
Perry Wright, playing
number four for Stanford, said
McEnroe "gets on the bad side
of crowds most of the time.
Let's just say he's not conserva
tive in his speech. But lines
men do make mistakes. And
instead of changing their call,
they'll gang up on him. They
feel their honor is being
threatened."
About the press, McEnroe
said, "Probably half the things
they say are wrong. They don't
know me, so they don't know
what to believe. They blow ev
erything up. They make it
sound like you shot some
bod/."' ' . ...... â€ž .

The quote McEnroe is re
membered for occurred prior
to his Wimbledon round
of-16 match against Mayer. Re
porters said he told Mayer
" 'There's no way I'm going to
lose to this guy.' "
What really happend, ac
cording to McEnroe, was that
the quip was taken out of con
text. He was actually talking at
courtside with Gene Scott,
who won Wimbledon doubles
in 1963. McEnroe asked Scott
how he should play Mayer.
Scott responded by telling
McEnroe that the way he had
been playing, " 'Your serve is a
little better . . . and your
forehand is a little better.' "
McEnroe then said, " 'God,
it sounds like there's no way I
can lose to this guy.' " And
Mayer didn't even hear him say
it.
This is Goulcf's 12th season at
Stanford, He saw Connors as
UCLA freshman, when he be
came one of the few frosh to
win the NCAA's. He compared
the two prodigies.

Stanford frosh sensation John McEnroe sets up to smack a backhand.
McEnroe was a Wimbledon semifinalist, ana is now ranked 15th in
the world.
"They are very different
kinds of players," Gould said.
"Both have super self
confidence but Connors was
more tenacious. He attacked
all the time. Connors would
take every ball on the rise.
Patience
"Mac is more patient," he
continued. "He doesn't panic
against anybody. Connors has
since learned that. No one has
done (at his age) what Mac has
done, consistently."
Wimbledon was the turning
point in McEnroe's life. Al
though he had beaten several
touring pros, he was still an
unknown. The bookies made
him a 1000-1 shot. But beware
of Irish teenagers bearing Wil
son Pro Staffs. What McEnroe
did in the next week and one
half had never before been ac
complished in the 100 years of
the prestigious tournament.
He survived three rounds of
qualifying and then blitzed
through five other pros en
route to the semifinals vs.
Connors, the youngest player
to ever accomplish that feat.
"I played in the big
stadium," recalled McEnroe,
who was accustomed to play
ing as far away from center
court as the tournament offi
cials could get him. "When I
first walked out I was reallyten
tative. It took me a long time to

adjust. I had so much room I
didn't know what to do with it.
"In away I had the advan
tage," McEnroe continued, "If
he won it wasn't that big a
win, and if he lost it was horri
ble."
One of the few times McEn
roe has ever admitted being
nervous was in the first game of
the Connors match. McEnroe
was serving and lost four
straight points and the game.
But that was where the fun
stopped for Connors. McEnroe
came back to give him a real
battle, losing 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.
The next time they met, Con
nors was lucky to escape. McEn
roe was anead 3-0 in the final
set, before losings-7,6-2,7-5 in
the U.S. Pro Championships.
McEnroe has lost two
matches to Connors, but has
gained the confidence to beat
him.
"On a given day I think he
could be beat," McEnroe said.
" There are certian shots that
give him trouble. Low
forehand approach shots
you've got to slice and keep the
ball low. And there're a lot of
pros with better serves. A lot of
it's mental. If you thinkyou can
do it, maybe you can. I don't go
out hoping I can win a match
anymore, I go out knowing I
can."
