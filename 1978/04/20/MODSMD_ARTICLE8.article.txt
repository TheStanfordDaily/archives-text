# Sibling strategy
## Jordans join forces ...

Sibling rivalry is com
monplace among most
brothers and sisters. But Kathy
and Barbara Jordan, who came
all the way from Pennsylvania
to grace the courts of Stanford,
prove to be an exception.
Aside from being a dynamic
doubles combination ("I hit
the fence and she hits the net,"
Kathy said), they also hold in
dividual rankings of No. 1 and
No. 2 for the Cardinal women's
tennis team. Kathy, a freshman
who entered as a National
Merit Scholar, fills the first slot
and Barbara, a junior
economics major, fills the sec
ond.
Despite their circumstances,
the sisters agree that very little
competition exists between
them. They agree on almost
everything else too.
Both chose Stanford for its
combination of academics and
athletic excellence and no
doubt the California sunshine
was a factor in luring the
women west. Now that they've
settled on the Farm, though,
tennis has become their prior
ity, rather than the academic
routine.
"It's not too exciting to study
on a Friday night," Kathy said.
And both are planning to "try

to play pro tennis" upon
graduating instead of attend
ing graduate school. Asked
about the possibility of making
it big on the professional ten
nis circuit, Kathy responded
noncommittally that "either
one of us could make a living."
Early start
As can be expected, the Car
dinal women come from a
family-inspired tennis envi
ronment where their skills
were first cultivated at the ages
of six and eight. Since that time
Barbara has been a two-time
All-American and was an AIAW
collegiate singles quarter
finalist as well as the Franklin
International Open singles
champion in 1977. She was
rated No. 37 in the 1977 U.S.
women's rankings. Kathy won
the national girls 18 doubles
last summer and was a national
girls 18 singles finalist. Both
played basketball competi
tively in high school in addition
to their tennis routine.
Here at Stanford they shoul
der the responsibility of their
rankings. Fortunately, Kathy
hasn't been affected by the
pressure of stepping into the
top position on the Cardinal
team.
