# Goldenkranz, Drysdale face runoff
## 
### Matt Mettler 
The Andrew Goldenkranz slate came closest to
winning the ASSU Council of Presidents (COP)
race last night but fell 1.6 per cent short of the
necessary simple majority of more than 50 per
cent.
The slate will face the George Drysdale slate,
which obtained 30.9 per cent of the vote, in a
run-off election next week.
Low voter turnout resulted in the passage of
only three of the 11 proposed fee assessments. In
order to validate the fee assessment election, 20
per cent of the student body must vote. The fee
assessments for KZSU, the Band and the Daily
passed.
A run-off election will also be held for senior
class presidents between the Breck and Wachtel
slates next week.
The results were announced last night by ASSU
Elections Commissioner Sean Murphy. Final re
sults will not be known until the overseas ballots
are included in the vote totals, Murphy said. Over
seas ballots are due by noon Monday, Murphy
said.
Overseas ballots could make a difference for
several of the fee assessments which are about 20
votes short of the required 20 per cent. About 100
overseas students voted in last fall's elections,
Murphy added.
Associate Registrar Robert Houghton estimated

that there are currently 11,225 registered students.
To validate the fee assessment elections, 2244
people or 20 per cent must vote.
ASSU Senate Chairperson Fred Grethel said he
will recommend to the senate at its Tuesday meet
ing that a special election be called to give the
failed fee assessments another chance.
Grethel said the constitution says an election to
approve special fee assessments can be held no
sooner than 14 days and no later than 21 days after
the senate calls for such an election.
The KZSU fee assessment received 2268 votes,
the Band 2265 and the Daily 2264.
The Speakers Bureau received 2242 votes, the
Legal Counseling Office 2237 and the Guest Pro
fessorship Board 2221. These fee assessments may
be passed by the overseas ballot votes.
Both the Daily and KZSU sent telex messages last
night to the Florence, Berlin, Cliveden and Tours
overseas campuses urging students to return their
election results immediately, according to Daily
Managing Editor Mike Charlson.
More than 60 per cent of those voting were in
favor of the withdrawal referendum. The referen
dum, initiated by Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP), states that
Stanford should exert its influence to effect corpo
rate withdrawal from South Africa.
Only 46 per cent voted in favor of a Western
Culture requirement. However, of that number,

more than 50 per cent voted for a multi-track
course model, as opposed to a single course
model to fulfill the requirement.
The referendum callingfora re-evaluation of the
decision to terminate de√üeauvoir house narrowly
passed. The present residence priority referen
dum was supported by 70 per cent of voting stu
dents.
Three of the four constitutional amendments
passed.
Pending approval by the Board of Trustees, the
amendments, which require fee assessment
exemption for overseas students, separate levying
of fee assessments on graduate and under
graduate students, and audits of all groups re
questing fee assessments, will become part of the
ASSU Constitution.
The constitutional amendment to change the
wording of the constitution to "non-sexist" lan
guage failed.
The Goldenkranz COP slate includes members
Regina Petty, Fred Estes and Mary Morimoto. The
Drysdale slate is composed of Duncan Evered and
Gwyn Felt. Michael Bush, who is campaigning with
the slate as a replacement candidate, did not ap
pear on the ballot.
The senior class president slate of Amy Breck
includes Lewis Butler, Leslie Crozier and Tony
Peet. The Jeff VVachtel includes Larry Broussard,
Marshall Payne and Donna Tepe.
