## SOC breaches faith of students 
### 
Bandow et al.

On Tuesday, April 4, the Stanford
Organizing Committee (SOC) slate
members of the ASSU Senate gave
$1700 — over 40 per cent of the entire
year's discretionary fund — to the
SOC for the staging of Disorientation
Week.
Seven non-SOC senators walked
out on that meeting. A petition drive
was begun, and on April 7, the senate
SOC slate caved in and agreed to re
duce the appropriation to $1000.
Considering the furor that was
aroused, the issue deserves some
explanation. The story really begins
last spring.
Budgets for the ASSU Senate are
normally approved during spring for
the upcoming year; however, last
year's senate failed to approve the
recommendation of $1500 for the
Senate Discretionary Fund — which
serves all campus groups and pro
jects requesting funds. Thus, last fall
the senate found itself in the unpre
cedented position (and with the un
precedented responsibility) of ap
proving its own budget.
The finance committee amended
the budget upward from $1500 to
$2500. The senate as a whole, with all
of the SOC slate members in favor,
further increased the budget to
$4000. The total budgetary increase
was $2500 — an increase of 266 per
cent over the initially recommended
level.
At the time of that vote, the SOC
slate members heatedly denied
charges that the increase
foreshadowed political abuse. SOC
justified the higher level on the
grounds that there was a wide range
of needy groups and projects on
campus, and that more funding
should be available for all of them.
Scheduling snafued
Approximately $1500 was spent
over fall and winter quarters, leaving
$2500 for spring and summer quar
ters. Finance committee meetings
were scheduled for the entire first
week of this spring quarter. Notice of
the meetings was only given out over
the preceding weekend, and the
times were set without consulting

the non-SOC senators on the com
mittee. Thus, a number of senators
were not able to attend the meetings.
Despite this setting, the finance
committee, with only SOC members
present, passed in its entirety a $1700
request for the SOC organized Dis
orientation Week. No proposal of
this magnitude has ever before been
passed by the Committee without
critical examination and some reduc
tion. Yet the SOC-sponsored prop
osal requesting over 40 per cent of
the entire year's budget was ap
proved at a meeting with inadequate
notice, representation and planning.
Then at the Senate meeting on
April 4, in a "party line" vote, SOC
slate members passed the proposal 1 .
The non-SOC members of the Se
nate — ranging in political persua
sion from liberal to conservative to
libertarian — unanimously opposed
the proposal.
None of the non-SOC members
opposed Disorientation Week; quite
the contrary, it was consistently
stated that all felt it would make a
valuable contribution to the diversity
of the campus. The dispute centered
solely on the amount of the alloca
tion — $1700.
The $1700 was over 40 per cent of
the annual discretionary fund for the
senate. At that point in the year, one
proposal which was intimately re
lated to SOC slate had received more
money than all other groups and pro
jects combined.
Since this allocation represented
more than two-thirds of the remain
ing funds, many worthy groups and
programs would have been shut out
of funding by this one massive ex
penditure; for example, there were
over $1500 in requests from other or
ganizations after the first senate
meeting, and there will undoubtedly
be more before the end of the quar
ter.
This expenditure must also be
looked at in the context of the
budget increases of last fall. The en
tire budget increase of $1500 passed
by the SOC slate at the full senate
meeting was given to one SOC

cause. Further, the expenditure is
over 10 per cent higher than the en
tire discretionary fund available to
previous senates.
In short, the allocation had three
separate steps. First, the SOC
dominated senate nearly tripled the
size of the discretionary fund. Next,
an SOC proposal was rub
berstamped by all-SOC finance
committee. Finally, an SOC
controlled senate approved the
budget request. We felt this was a
curious way to manage student
money.
This action by the SOC was, at the
bottom line, a breach of faith with
the students. A budget increase sup
posedly predicated on broad student
needs was given solely to one cause;
pious disclaimers of political

favoritism gave way to an abuse of
the student treasury. We felt that
such an abuse could not be allowed
to stand as precedent.
The senate chairperson was
quoted as saying that the non-SOC
members "can't seem to transcend
their initial belief that SOC is bad."
This was not, and has never been, the
issue. Rather, the issue was whether
the ASSU Senate, and student funds,
were the sole property and play
things of the SOC slate. We felt then
as we fell now — they are not.

submitted by Senators Doug Ban
dow, Steven Buckley, George Drys
dale, Wayne Herriford, Peter Joost
and Al Miner, who all walked out of
the April 4 senate meeting.)
