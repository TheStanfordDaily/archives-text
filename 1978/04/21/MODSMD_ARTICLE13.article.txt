# Magic show to benefit Hospital

### Barbie Fields Dave Daleke 
Do you believe in magic? Mark Rosekind
and company are working to bring another
night of mystic entertainment to the Stan
ford community May 27 and 28 when they
present their second "I Believe in Magic
Show."
Rosekind, a sleep research director at
the Medical Sleep Disorders Clinic and
part-time magician, once again heads a
benefit for the Children's Hospital. Last
year the group of seven raised $1000 by
doing two shows.
Old favorites like "Metamorphosis" (an
illusion created by Houdini), the "Zig-zag"
illusion (where a woman is sectioned and
put back together), several celebrity per
formances including one by Psychology
Prof. Daryl Bern, and an original illusion
designed by the Rosekinds all highlight
this year's show.
"Magic can be an enjoyable form of es
cape from the harsh realities of the world. I
like taking everyday objects and doing the
impossible with them, things like running
a needle through a balloon without pop
ping it," said Rosekind.
Rosekind has been assisted since junior
high by his brother Gary, a senior premed.
Gary plans and builds most of the illusions
himself.

"Our new illusion is a combination of
several old illusions with a different twist.
But as far as we know it has never been
performed in this way before," Rosekind
said.
"It's definitely not just last year's show.
We have a comedian slated to warm up the
audience, and a skit, 'Mark's Magical
Medical Clinic,' which depicts the history
of medicine through magic, added to this
year's show," said Margot Palmer, a senior
psychology major and coordinator of the
show again this year.
Tickets for the show will be available in
late April at Tresidder and other Bay Area
ticket agencies. It will be held Memorial
Day weekend in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Both shows will begin at 8 p.m. with tickets
$3 general admission, $2 students and
children.
The group is also seeking tax-deductible
donations to help defray the costs of the
show. Last year they raised $400 to cover
flyers, posters and other expenses so that
all the proceeds of the show could go to
the Children's Hospital.
German Prof. Rob Robinson, a fourth
member of the group, said, "This show is
in the spirit of, but not a copy of, the Con
home Week activities that were once a part
of raising money for the Children's Hospi

tal in the '60s.
"It's nice to have university people in
volved again in public service activities like
this and the Aqua Follies, also benefiting
the Children's Hospital," he added.
The hospital is an independent, non
profit hospital specializing in the treat
ment and rehabilitation of children with
serious illnesses and disabilities such as
cancer, cystic fibrosis and severe muscle
and bone disorders.
According to Robinson, one exciting as
pect of the show was "to have so few
people put on such a professional show.
There is a sense of accomplishment in
volved."
"The Rosekinds are perfectionists,"
Robinson continued. "Mark practices
over and over again to perfect all the little
things like misdirection and sleight of
hand that go into being a good magician."
Commenting on the sentiment behind
the show, Rosekind said, "The special
magic is being performed by all the people
who support this worthwhile organization
— the Children's Hospital. Here is your
opportunity to sit back, leave our physical
laws of reality and enjoy yourself. Try not
to question what is real, but instead allow
yourself to join us in our world of illu
sion."
