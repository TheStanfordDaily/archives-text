## Film/ron lillejord Two movies, one good, one bloated 
### 
Writer-director Paul
Mazursky infuses "An Unmar
ried Woman" with such light
ness and sensitivity that the
film overcomes the dangers
inherent in its subject matter.
Hollywood usually turns
stories of marital break-up into
trite soap operas: "An Unmar
ried Woman" 's subtlety and
perception are welcome sur
prises.
Jill Clayburgh stars as Erica, a
"happily" married woman with
a part-time job in an art gallery,
a beautiful high-rise apart
ment, and a nice enough
stockbroker husband (Michael
Murphy). Erica's smug, un
questioning existence is shat
tered when her husband tells
her he's fallen in love with
another woman and wants a
divorce.
Long one of America's most
underrated actresses,
Clayburgh perfectly captures
the feelings of despair and in
security such a sudden shock
can give. Clayburgh has just
the right mix of beauty and be
lievability for the role; I can
think of only two other Ameri
can actresses — Jane Fonda
and Ellen Bur rt yn — who are
capable of playing Erica as well
as Clayburgh does and at the
same time can persuasively ex
press Ericas's mid-'3os sexual
ity.
At first, Erica is paranoid
about developing any new re
lationships whatsoever,, and
she flies into rages if a man says
even a friendly hello to her.
She looks for consolation
among her group of close
friends, but is equally tem
peramental with them.
Then Erica turns to a
therapist — and the film per
ceptibly slows. At the start of
these sessions with the
therapist, you appreciate the
naturalness of the acting; also,
many of the observations made
in the discussions are insight
ful. For example, Erica com
ments that she feels jealous
when she sees a couple show
ing affection, even holding
hands; she wonders if her
loneliness will ever end.

But quickly the appreciation
turns into impatience, and you
want Erica to move on. Prior to
the therapy sessions, the film is
comic without beingcruel; but
this well-intentioned compas
sion gets the better of
Mazursky in these sequences.
The essential banality of the
therapist need to be satirized,
but Mazursky refuses to do
this. The pace and tone of the
film suffer as a result.
The film picks up when Erica
leaves the therapist and begins
to assert herself. At the art gal
lery, she meets Saul, winningly
played by Alan Bates. They
fall in love, and Erica is pre
sented with a choice between
going to Vermont with Saul or
staying in New York in order to
keep her job and newly
discovered independence.
The ending is ambiguous;
Erica is delaying a decision
rather than making one. Saul
leaves for Vermont, and when
we last see Erica, she is carrying
one of Saul's very large paint
ings back home to her apart
ment. It is an ambivalent sym
bol; appropriate and comic.
Yet rather weak. Erica is — for
the time being, at least —
choosing independence, but
some of the ties are still there.
Although the ending asks
more questions than it
answers, "An Unmarried Wo
man" is, on the whole, a strong
film. Mazursky gets solid per
formances from his entire cast,
from the brilliant Clayburgh to
newcomer Lisa Lucas as Erica's
teenage daughter. The charac
ters in the film are complex
people with real and identifi
able problems as well as
strengths." "An Unmarried
Woman" portrays a believable
situation in a warm and human
way — without being sac
charine or simple-minded. The
film should give Mazursky the
recognition he's long de
served, especially after his last
two films, "Harry and Tonto"
and "Next Stop, Greenwich
Village."

In an opposite direction
from the subtlety and purpose

fully limited focus of "An Un
married Woman" lies Una
Wertmuller's new film "The
End of the World in Our Usua)
Bed in a Night Full of Rain."
The title is a reflection of the
movie; both are long-winded,
generating a lot of hot air, but
not much else.
Not satisfied with simply de
tailing the story of a relation
ship, Wertmuller loads "A
Night Full of Rain" with nearly
two hours of socialist politics
and assorted other philosophi
cal claptrap. For example, the
fact that women don't have
more orgasms is somehow a
"bourgeois fact."
The central characters in the
film play political stereotypes
rather than real people. Can
dice Bergen is the rich Ameri
can capitalist and Giancarlo
Ciannini is the Italian com
munist who doesn't care about
money. They don't just repre
sent a marriage in crisis; they
are examples of the unending
clash between the proletariat
and the bourgeoisie.
These third-grade
metaphors are joined by the

equally imbecilic metaphor of
rain. The constant downpour
"represents" their marriage.
All this garbage symbolism is
made worse by the slow-paced
manner in which it is delivered.
If you're going to pound
someone with a message, at
least do it fast, as Sidney Lumet
did in "Network."
The acting isn't that bad,
especially when you consider
how hard it is to play an ideol
ogy. However, the actors are
finally defeated by the fact that
the film lacks any believable
emotion. The couple's climac
tic argument is empty and has
no force; the pseudo
intellectualism which pre
ceeded it has completely vit
iated its possible effect.
"A Night Full of Rain" is
Wertmuller's first film in En
glish; this shift from her native
Italian has affected her heart
more than her head. In this
film, all Wertmuller shows us is
her intellectualism; she neg
lects to show us her heart, her
emotions. The intellectualism
— and the movie — are forgot
ten very quickly.

press Ericas's mid-'3os sexual
ity.
At first, Erica is paranoid
about developing any new re
lationships whatsoever,, and
she flies into rages if a man says
even a friendly hello to her.
She looks for consolation
among her group of close
friends, but is equally tem
peramental with them.
Then Erica turns to a
therapist — and the film per
ceptibly slows. At the start of
these sessions with the
therapist, you appreciate the
naturalness of the acting; also,
many of the observations made
in the discussions are insight
ful. For example, Erica com
ments that she feels jealous
when she sees a couple show
ing affection, even holding
hands; she wonders if her
loneliness will ever end.

But quickly the appreciation
turns into impatience, and you
want Erica to move on. Prior to
the therapy sessions, the film is
comic without beingcruel; but
this well-intentioned compas
sion gets the better of
Mazursky in these sequences.
The essential banality of the
therapist need to be satirized,
but Mazursky refuses to do
this. The pace and tone of the
film suffer as a result.
The film picks up when Erica
leaves the therapist and begins
to assert herself. At the art gal
lery, she meets Saul, winningly
played by Alan Bates. They
fall in love, and Erica is pre
sented with a choice between
going to Vermont with Saul or
staying in New York in order to
keep her job and newly
discovered independence.
The ending is ambiguous;
Erica is delaying a decision
rather than making one. Saul
leaves for Vermont, and when
we last see Erica, she is carrying
one of Saul's very large paint
ings back home to her apart
ment. It is an ambivalent sym
bol; appropriate and comic.
Yet rather weak. Erica is — for
the time being, at least —
choosing independence, but
some of the ties are still there.
Although the ending asks
more questions than it
answers, "An Unmarried Wo
man" is, on the whole, a strong
film. Mazursky gets solid per
formances from his entire cast,
from the brilliant Clayburgh to
newcomer Lisa Lucas as Erica's
teenage daughter. The charac
ters in the film are complex
people with real and identifi
able problems as well as
strengths." "An Unmarried
Woman" portrays a believable
situation in a warm and human
way — without being sac
charine or simple-minded. The
film should give Mazursky the
recognition he's long de
served, especially after his last
two films, "Harry and Tonto"
and "Next Stop, Greenwich
Village."

In an opposite direction
from the subtlety and purpose

fully limited focus of "An Un
married Woman" lies Una
Wertmuller's new film "The
End of the World in Our Usua)
Bed in a Night Full of Rain."
The title is a reflection of the
movie; both are long-winded,
generating a lot of hot air, but
not much else.
Not satisfied with simply de
tailing the story of a relation
ship, Wertmuller loads "A
Night Full of Rain" with nearly
two hours of socialist politics
and assorted other philosophi
cal claptrap. For example, the
fact that women don't have
more orgasms is somehow a
"bourgeois fact."
The central characters in the
film play political stereotypes
rather than real people. Can
dice Bergen is the rich Ameri
can capitalist and Giancarlo
Ciannini is the Italian com
munist who doesn't care about
money. They don't just repre
sent a marriage in crisis; they
are examples of the unending
clash between the proletariat
and the bourgeoisie.
These third-grade
metaphors are joined by the

equally imbecilic metaphor of
rain. The constant downpour
"represents" their marriage.
All this garbage symbolism is
made worse by the slow-paced
manner in which it is delivered.
If you're going to pound
someone with a message, at
least do it fast, as Sidney Lumet
did in "Network."
The acting isn't that bad,
especially when you consider
how hard it is to play an ideol
ogy. However, the actors are
finally defeated by the fact that
the film lacks any believable
emotion. The couple's climac
tic argument is empty and has
no force; the pseudo
intellectualism which pre
ceeded it has completely vit
iated its possible effect.
"A Night Full of Rain" is
Wertmuller's first film in En

Italian has affected her heart

emotions. The intellectualism
— and the movie — are forgot

Writer-director Paul
Mazursky infuses "An Unmar

Hollywood usually turns
stories of marital break-up into
trite soap operas: "An Unmar

Jill Clayburgh stars as Erica, a
"happily" married woman with
a part-time job in an art gallery,
a beautiful high-rise apart

stockbroker husband (Michael
Murphy). Erica's smug, un
questioning existence is shat

her he's fallen in love with
another woman and wants a
divorce.
Long one of America's most
underrated actresses,
Clayburgh perfectly captures
the feelings of despair and in
security such a sudden shock
can give. Clayburgh has just
the right mix of beauty and be
lievability for the role; I can
think of only two other Ameri

leaves the therapist and begins
to assert herself. At the art gal
lery, she meets Saul, winningly
played by Alan Bates. They
fall in love, and Erica is pre
sented with a choice between
going to Vermont with Saul or
staying in New York in order to
keep her job and newly
discovered independence.
The ending is ambiguous;
Erica is delaying a decision
rather than making one. Saul
leaves for Vermont, and when
we last see Erica, she is carrying
one of Saul's very large paint
ings back home to her apart
ment. It is an ambivalent sym
bol; appropriate and comic.
Yet rather weak. Erica is — for
the time being, at least —
choosing independence, but
some of the ties are still there.
Although the ending asks
more questions than it
answers, "An Unmarried Wo
man" is, on the whole, a strong
film. Mazursky gets solid per
formances from his entire cast,
from the brilliant Clayburgh to
newcomer Lisa Lucas as Erica's
teenage daughter. The charac
ters in the film are complex
people with real and identifi
able problems as well as
strengths." "An Unmarried
Woman" portrays a believable
situation in a warm and human
way — without being sac
charine or simple-minded. The
film should give Mazursky the
recognition he's long de
served, especially after his last
two films, "Harry and Tonto"
and "Next Stop, Greenwich
Village."

In an opposite direction
from the subtlety and purpose

fully limited focus of "An Un
married Woman" lies Una
Wertmuller's new film "The
End of the World in Our Usua)
Bed in a Night Full of Rain."
The title is a reflection of the
movie; both are long-winded,
generating a lot of hot air, but
not much else.
Not satisfied with simply de
tailing the story of a relation
ship, Wertmuller loads "A
Night Full of Rain" with nearly
two hours of socialist politics
and assorted other philosophi
cal claptrap. For example, the
fact that women don't have
more orgasms is somehow a
"bourgeois fact."
The central characters in the
film play political stereotypes
rather than real people. Can
dice Bergen is the rich Ameri
can capitalist and Giancarlo
Ciannini is the Italian com
munist who doesn't care about
money. They don't just repre
sent a marriage in crisis; they
are examples of the unending
clash between the proletariat
and the bourgeoisie.
These third-grade
metaphors are joined by the

equally imbecilic metaphor of
rain. The constant downpour
"represents" their marriage.
All this garbage symbolism is
made worse by the slow-paced
manner in which it is delivered.
If you're going to pound
someone with a message, at
least do it fast, as Sidney Lumet
did in "Network."
The acting isn't that bad,
especially when you consider
how hard it is to play an ideol
ogy. However, the actors are
finally defeated by the fact that
the film lacks any believable
emotion. The couple's climac
tic argument is empty and has
no force; the pseudo
intellectualism which pre
ceeded it has completely vit
iated its possible effect.
"A Night Full of Rain" is
Wertmuller's first film in En
glish; this shift from her native
Italian has affected her heart
more than her head. In this
film, all Wertmuller shows us is
her intellectualism; she neg
lects to show us her heart, her
emotions. The intellectualism
— and the movie — are forgot
ten very quickly.
