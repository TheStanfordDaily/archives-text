## Dave Guard comes home 
### 
Dave Guard was the co
founder of andthePrimum
Mobile behind the Kingston
Trio. You remember them.
They were the folk group
who had four albums in the
top eight through the sum
mer of 1959 (also a couple of
grammies, six gold albums,
an academy award for a
movie soundtrack, and sev
eral Seven-up commer
cials). They sang "Tom
Dooley," "Tijuana Jail,"
and "Scotch and Soda," to
name a few, and they did a
hell of a lot to legitimize folk
music at a time when it
faced annihilation at the
hands of the evil Elvis Pre
sley.
Dave Guard will be play
ing at the Coffee House on
Saturday night. He will be
appearing with a quartet cal
led the Expanding Band,
which consists of two mem
bers of the Limeliters' old
back-up group (Jaque Fur
man, Brian Davies) and two
of the Sons of Champlin
(Rob Moitoza, Geoff
Palmer).
Guard is excited about

the appearance; it will be
something of a homecom
ing. "I went to school
here," he admits. "I
watched the Big Came, and
I lived in Encina, and I
played five frosh welcoming
picnics. I was a Rosotti's
regular, where you played
'till the blisters on your
hands popped at two in the
morning, and in the morn
ing I went over and washed
dishes for those Branner
women. I lived around here
— been using the Xerox
machines religiously for
many years — and it will be
interesting to see what 20
years have done to the
Branner women."
Dave Guard is not the old
guy you expect him to be.
He has been very active
since his Bob Mathias days,
and he has lost none of the
enthusiasm, wit and intelli
gence that made him the
scourge of the Hungry i.
"I've travelled the world,
lived in Australia and Swe
den, researched legends in
Ulster and Scotland, kissed
the hand of the Princess of

Japan, endured all of the as
sassinations, LBJ, raised a
family, and generally tasted
the delights of the world. At
the Coffee Housel intend for
absolutely all of this tocome
through when I appear as a
deeply dedicated, confused
man. It will be a case study
in skills and knowledge ac
quired against the obvious
deterioration of a mind after
20 years away from Old Un
ion."
This may not sound wildly
objective, but I have a
sneaking suspicion that
anybody who misses Dave
Guard's concert at the Cof
fee House on Saturday de
serves to live forever in pub
lic scorn and obloquy. They
will be missing out on a con
siderable load of insights,
and on more than a little
musical therapy. It should
be decidedly more than
another case of a former star
beating a dead horse to
make it run further. That
happens from time to time,
but it does not seem likely
to happen on Saturday.

which consists of two mem
bers of the Limeliters' old
back-up group (Jaque Fur
man, Brian Davies) and two
of the Sons of Champlin
(Rob Moitoza, Geoff
Palmer).
Guard is excited about

the appearance; it will be
something of a homecom
ing. "I went to school
here," he admits. "I
watched the Big Came, and
I lived in Encina, and I
played five frosh welcoming
picnics. I was a Rosotti's
regular, where you played
'till the blisters on your
hands popped at two in the
morning, and in the morn
ing I went over and washed
dishes for those Branner
women. I lived around here
— been using the Xerox
machines religiously for
many years — and it will be
interesting to see what 20
years have done to the
Branner women."
Dave Guard is not the old
guy you expect him to be.
He has been very active
since his Bob Mathias days,
and he has lost none of the
enthusiasm, wit and intelli
gence that made him the
scourge of the Hungry i.
"I've travelled the world,
lived in Australia and Swe
den, researched legends in
Ulster and Scotland, kissed
the hand of the Princess of

Japan, endured all of the as
sassinations, LBJ, raised a
family, and generally tasted
the delights of the world. At
the Coffee Housel intend for
absolutely all of this tocome
through when I appear as a
deeply dedicated, confused
man. It will be a case study
in skills and knowledge ac
quired against the obvious
deterioration of a mind after
20 years away from Old Un
ion."
This may not sound wildly
objective, but I have a
sneaking suspicion that
anybody who misses Dave
Guard's concert at the Cof
fee House on Saturday de
serves to live forever in pub
lic scorn and obloquy. They
will be missing out on a con
siderable load of insights,
and on more than a little
musical therapy. It should
be decidedly more than
another case of a former star
beating a dead horse to
make it run further. That
happens from time to time,
but it does not seem likely
to happen on Saturday.
