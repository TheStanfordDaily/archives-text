## Netters romp

Stanford's top-ranked men's tennis team extended its two-year
winning streak to 28 matches by taking seven of the first eight
matches yesterday from USC.
The defending NCAA champions only dropped four sets in the
first eight matches. The Cards (16-0) started off on the right foot,
winning five of the first six matches and clinching the victory
before the doors to Maples Pavilion were opened for the evening
matches.
Lloyd Bourne and Peter Rennert (4-0) began the onslaught,
besting the previously undefeated team of Doug Adler and Earl
Prince 6-4,6-2. Playing indoors because of the threat of rain suited
Bourne fine.
After 15 minutes of practice, second double team of Perry
Wright and Matt Mitchell watched their opponents Glenn Pet
rovic and Buzzy Strode hit winner afterwinneragainst each other
for an additional 45 minutes.
Making only eight errors, the Card duo took only 28 minutes in
winning 6-0, 6-0. In only two of the games could the Trojans
muster a game point.
The action then moved outdoors to the Stanford Tennis
Stadium for the singles. Wright jumped to a 5-1 lead, but had to
struggle to a 6-4 first set win.
Defending NCAA champion Mitchell continued his winning
ways. Spotting USC's Strode the first two games, Mitchell played
flawlessly in winning the next 10. He easily won the match 6-2,
6-1.
Last night, John McEnroe took three sets in beating
USC's Robert Van't Hof, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4. Mac lead 6-4, 5-2 but drop
ped the next five games, four of them at 3-all.
"I relaxed. I hadn't been playing that bad until that point," said
McEnroe, who announced Wednesday he will turn pro following
the conclusion of this season. "He (Van't Hof) hit some good
•shots and started playing with confidence. When a guy starts
playing like that, he's hard to beat."
With the match tied at 3-all in the third set, McEnroe sought
advice from longtime coach, friend and now teammate Rennert.
After their brief conference in the stands, McEnroe rallied to win
three of the last four games and the match.
