## Cyclists gear for races 
### Dean Eyre 
The Stanford Cycling Club, in cooperation
with the athletic department and public safety
department, will sponsor the Western Regional
Intercollegiate Cycling Championships. Time
trials are being held tomorrow and competition
begins at 9 a.m. on Sunday.
Men and women cyclists from at least 10
schools, including defending regional champ
ion UC-Santa Barbara, will be participating.
Other teams competing are Cal, UC-Davis,
UC-San Diego, UC-Santa Cruz, Long Beach St.,
Chico State, Oregon State and Claremont Col
lege.
Saturday's time trials are scheduled for 3 p.m.
on Canada Road in Woodside. A 50 kilometer
team trial is the first event, followed at 3:30 and 4
by women's and men's individual trials, both 20
kilometers long.
John Toor, member of the Stanford club and
promoter of the event, explained the organiza
tion of riders. "The United States Cycling Feder
ation is the governing body of cycling and it
categorizes all senior (over 18 years old) riders
into (categories) one, two, three and four, and
in intercollegiate racing, categories one, two

and three race together as A teams and category
four and non-USCA riders race as B teams," he
said.
The racing action Sunday starts at 9 a.m. with
men's B teams going for 20 kilometers. The
course runs around Stern and Wilbur Halls, with
a lap length of 1.2 kilometers.
At9:so a.m. there will be a 2.4 kilometer team
pursuit which is "just a full-blown sprint," Toor
said. Each team enters four riders that attempt to
stay in tight formation, "taking turns 'breaking
the wind.' They'll be riding with their tires about
six inches apart," Toor added.
The women's 20 kilometer race gets under
way at 10:10 a.m., followed by a special perfor
mance of the Stanford Band from 10:30 a.m.
until it heads over to the Aqua Follies. The last
race of the day is slated forll a.m., consisting of
a 40 kilometer men's A team event. Awards will
be announced at 1 p.m.
"In getting in shape for intercollegiates, most
of the A team riders are probably doing in the
range of 200 to 400 miles a week. Last year I was
doing around 400 miles a week while going to
school, which didn't help my grades a lot," Toor
said.
