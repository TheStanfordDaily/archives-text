# Kuhn takes the mound
## Cards open Cal series 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Larry Kuhn will be on the
mound today for the Stanford
Cardinals looking for his sixth
win of this season in a 2:30
p.m. contest with the Califor
nia Bears in Sunken Diamond.
Tomorrow at noon, the two
teams will play a doubleheader
in Berkeley to complete the
three-game series.
Kuhn, the sophomore right
hander who defeated the ace
of the USC Trojan staff last
weekend, posted an 8-2 victory
over Cal earlier this year in the
Riverside Tournament. At
Riverside, Kuhn yielded only
three hits to the Golden Bears.
Cal comes into this
weekend's series bringing up
the rear of the Pacific-8 South
ern Division with a 1-4 record,
after dropping a three-game
series to UCLA last weekend.
The Cards, meanwhile, show a
3-3 record — not far behind
both UCLA (4-2) and USC (3-2).
"We've got a better idea of
what Cal looks like this year,"
said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess, "after having seen
them in Riverside. They're a
very good team with good
speedandsomegood hitters."
Marquess stressed how de
ceptive team records can be
when he looked at Cal's re
cord. "They're 1-4 but look

who they've lost to — USC and
UCLA. You have to put things
in perspective. It doesn't mat
ter who's better on paper; you
can throw it out the window
when it comes down to the
game."
Both Cal and Stanford have
suffered most of their losses
this year due to pitching incon
sistencies. The ups and downs
of both teams' pitching staffs
make the outcomes of this
series less than predictable.
"Pitching is the key," Mar
quess cautioned.
For the Cardinals tomorrow,
Marquess plans to start unde
feated Bruce Fiala (6-0) in the
first game and will go with one
of the regulars who hasn't
been used in relief in the sec
ond game. California will pit
Steve Kiah (who took the loss at
Riverside) against Kuhn today.
Tomorrow Paul Fox (4-1, 2.00
ERA) will face Fiala and one of
three possible starters will be
chosen laterforthefinal game.
Up from the basement
Last year Cal and Stanford
finished the season tied for
third place in the Southern Di
vision with 5-13 records and
the two teams appear evenly
matched again this year. Cal
has 14 returning lettermen on
the '78 team including an all
veteran infield.

Bob Bohnet, currently lead
ing the team with a .356 aver
age and 32 RBI, returns to first
base for the Bears. Dennis Bar
field, who sat out last year with
a knee injury, will man second
base. Greg Thys returns to
shortstop and Terry Stigge will
again cover third.
Bob Silverman, who teamed
up with Bohnet last year in the
offensive attack against the
Cards, has moved to the out
field for California and sports a
.299 average with 23 RBI. Sil
verman will be joined in the
outfield by sophomore Jim
Selvitella and two junior col
lege transfers.
"The kids have a lot of re
spect for Cal," remarked Mar
quess. "Plus they're always
tougher when they play us."
Wednesday the Cards had a
chance to improve their bat
ting averages when they faced
Tulane. The Cards routed the
Green Wave 13-2, pounding
out 13 hits to back freshman
Paul Grame and David Jaffee
who handled the pitching as
signment.
Tom Guardino swatted one
out to left field for for his ninth
homerun of the year. Dave
Perez went two-for-four and
collected three RBI, continuing
his hot streak that began
against USC. Paul Zuvella went
three-for-five at the plate in
cluding a double and a triple.
Larry Reynolds sat on the
bench Wednesday to rest after
crashing into the outfield fence
in Tuesday's game against St.
Mary's. Reynolds suffered a
bruised hand and badly swol
len knee from the accident but
will be ready to go today, ac
cording to Marquess.
