One of the largest golfing
events in the nation is taking
place this weekend as the 11th
annual Collegiate Invitational
Golf Tournament comes to the
Stanford Golf Course. The
Cardinals are hosting 27 uni
versity and small college teams
along with five junior colleges.
Four of the squads were in the
top 16 in last year's NCAA
Championships.
The Cardinals have won
seven of the past 10 titles, but
they will be competing with
new equipment this year.
The Cards' entire arsenal of
shoes, bags and clubs was sto
len at the All-American Tour
nament in Houston last week.
The Cards managed to take
14th out of 26 while breaking in
their new equipment.
The Cards may fare better
this weekend — perhaps well
enough to avenge their losses
in the tournament the last two
years to San Jose State and San
Diego State.
The teams to watch in this

year's contest include Arizona
State, ranked third in the na
tion last year, 13th-ranked San
Jose State, and San Diego State,
which tied for 15th with the
Cards in the 1977 NCAA
Championships.
After yesterday's first round,
San Diego State led with a team
total of 284, although it had
only one golfer in the top six
individually. The Cards are
second with 287.
San Jose State is third with
290, followed by Arizona State
and Cal State-Northridge with
292.
Individually, Ben Graham
heads the field with 67. Last
year's tournament runner-up,
Mike Peck of Stanford, is in a
three-way tie for second at 68.
In 1976, Peck captured the
tournamentwith2l2, matching
the tournament record set by
Tom Watson in 1971.
Peck is even with teammate
Doug Clarke and Curt Worley
of San Diego State.
