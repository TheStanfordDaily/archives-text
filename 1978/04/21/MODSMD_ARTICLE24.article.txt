The same people, the same
area, but a different site.
Twelve members from the
Stanford track team will be per
forming tomorrow in the UCLA
Invitational in Drake Stadium
in a meet that was scheduled
this week to take the place of
the recently-cancelled Mount
San Antonio Relays.
The Cards, UCLA, USC and
Washington had all planned to
be in the Mt. SAC meet. Some
Husky runners will now be in
the Kansas Relays and others
will stay home for the Seattle
Relays.
"We're taking the same
people who qualified for the
Mt. SAC meet," said Stanford
track coach Payton Jordan.
"It's going to be a very com
petitive meet, with most of the
top schools participating. It
provides us with a good oppor
tunity to shoot for some Pac-8
and NCAA qualifying marks."
The Cards will be rep
resented in three relays — the
400 meter, the two mile, and
the distance medley. James
Lofton and Alan Sheats will be
running on the 400 relay squad
as well as going in the 400 dash.
Lofton will also be in the long
jump.
Other Cards participating in
individual events include Tom
Shellworth in the 400 inter
mediate hurdles, Ken
Margerum in the 110 high hur
dles, Roy Kissin in the 10,000
and Rick Buss in the discus.
