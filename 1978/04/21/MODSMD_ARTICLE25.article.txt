There's already the French
Connection and the Mexican
Connection. And now it looks
like there's an Irish Connec
tion, only this one is in basket
ball coaching.
Looking for a replacement
for former assistant Dick
Cuchen who took over as Cal's
head coach last month, Notre
Dame Fighting Irish cage coach
Digger Phelps this week chose
Stanford assistant Tom
McLaughlin, who'll begin his
duties in South Bend May 1.
"We're really happy to have
Tom join our staff," said
Phelps, whose team reached
the final four of the NCAA
tournament this season.
"We're indebted to Dick Di-
Biaso for his help in making
this possible. Since Stanford
and Notre Dame run similar
programs, there won't be any
of the normal transition prob
lems.
Stanford head coach Dißiaso
was an assistant coach for
Phelps before he came to Stan
ford three years ago. "Coach
Dißiaso definitely got me the
job," said McLaughlin. Dißiaso
called Phelps and recom
mended McLaughlin for the
vacancy.
"It'san opportunity that I felt
I couldn't pass up," said
McLaughlin. "There are only a
couple of places that could get
me to leave Stanford, and
Notre Dame is one of them.
Digger Phelps is one of the

greatest coaches in the coun
try."
McLaughlin, who along with
Stanford assistant Ken Maxey
was credited by Dißiaso for the
Cards' successful recruiting ef
forts this year, said he did not
consider the Irish opening
until the Cards had signed their
top recruits. "We knew the job
was open, but I didn't want to
be doing two things at once,"
he said.
McLaughlin has been an as
sistant coach at Stanford for
the past three years. The 27-
year-old New York native is a
1973 graduate of the University
of Massachusetts, where he
was a three-year basketball
starter.
