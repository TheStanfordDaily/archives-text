Coming off second place
finishes last weekend in Ore
gon, the Stanford crew will be
taking on Cal at Oakland Es
tuary tomorrowatlo:3oa.m. in
the Big Row.
Oregon State dominated the
competition against the Ducks
and the Cards on choppy,
windblown Dexter Lake. The
Cards, comfortably in second
in the varsity race, had to over
come a confusing finish caused
by a wrong signal by the flag
man to coxswain Lea Anne
Schoenfeld. The Cards began
to slow 150 feet short of the
finish, but their lengthy lead
over Oregon enabled them to
secure second by simply paddl

ing the last leg of the race.
The freshmen shell placed a
close second to the Beavers.
"We had problems with our
stroke rating," said freshman
captain Tom Hunt. The Cards'
number of strokes per minute
was apparently lower than the
regular racing beat, enabling
OSU to inch steadily past.
The Card freshmen haven't
defeated Cal since 1970. "Cal is
always tough," said freshman
coach Miles White. "However,
the freshmen have been get
ting closer every season. Last
year they were half a length
down. The frosh may have
their best shot at a victory this
year."
