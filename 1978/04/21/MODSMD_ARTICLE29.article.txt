history suffered a defeat in its
first game of the season. Stan
ford lost 7-3 to San Jose State

The loss was almost ex
pected, however, as Stanford

weeks ago. The women lack
the necessary experience,
especially at the plate, at this
stage in the game but that ex
perience should come as the
season progresses.
"We started off good," re
marked coach Sue Dourney,

"but then we made some er
rors and gave them some hits
they didn't deserve."
