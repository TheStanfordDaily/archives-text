# Guidelines urged for recruiters

Stanford and other universities
should adopt guidelines governing
faculty relationships with the CIA,
according to Morton Halperin, a
former assistant to Henry Kissinger.
Halperin said Stanford, or any uni
versity with a large number of foreign
students, is almost assured of having
a secret CIA recruiting agent on
campus.
"They have a second identity
which is genuinely secret,' said
Halperin, "and they are told to look
out for certain kinds of people."
Soviet and Iranian students are likely
targets for these recruiters, he said.
Halperin said the CIA "assets" on
campuses are often professors who
receive orders for a network of secret
stations located throughout the Un
ited States. "They function as if they
were overseas, complete with secret
coded cable traffic back to Langley,
Va. (CIA headquarters)."
The recruiter scouts for targets,
and then makes an invitational pitch
or introduces the target to another
agent, using "an approach so subtle
that those who turned it down are
later not sure of what they turned
down."
Halperin said a foreign student
from a country such as Iran, which
exchanges information with the CIA,
is put in a particularly dangerous pos

ition if he refuses to join the CIA.
Since the CIA is constantly trying
to penetrate other friendly intelli
gence agencies, an Iranian who re
fuses to serve the CIA may have his
file turned over to SAVAK (the Ira
nian equivalent to the CIA) to show
that the United States is willing to
exchange information, Halperin ad
ded.
The CIA file would be of interest to
SAVAK because it would show that
the Iranian "has some reason to be
disloyal to the Shah," according to
Halperin.
Another possibility is that the CIA
may make the "pitch" after being
asked by SAVAK to test the student's
loyalty to the Shah. "If you accept
and go back to spy for the CIA you
may return to a rather unfriendly re

ception," said Halperin.
According to Halperin, if Congress
passed legislation curbing the power
of the CIA to recruit secretly on cam
puses, foreign students would be
more "free of fear . . . that a CIA
agent might be in the classroom mak
ing a file," on every comment the
student makes.
Halperin resigned his post in the
Nixon administration in protest of
the invasion of Cambodia in 1970. He
was one of 17 people secretly
wiretapped by that administration
after a news leak in May 1969 ex
posed massive secret U.S. bombing
of Cambodia.
He is now director of the Center
for National Security Studies in
Washington, D.C., an organization
which is working on constraints of
CIA activities.
