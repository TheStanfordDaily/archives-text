Problems anticipated in arms talks
Moscow — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Soviet
leaders opened arms talks in the Kremlin yesterday on a
conciliatory note but with an American warning of
"complex and difficult problems" ahead.
Neither Vance nor his Soviet counterpart, Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko, expect to achieve a dramatic
breakthrough in the stalled U.S.-Soviet SALT negotia
tions for a new strategic arms limitation treaty. But the
atmosphere was more hopeful than vyhen Vance last
visited the Soviet capital in March 1977 and came away
emptyhanded.
Moro's kidnappers send demands
Rome — After a frantic three-day hunt by divers, skiers

and soldiers for Aldo Mora's body, a Rome newspaper
yesterday received a snapshot of the kidnapped former
premier in apparent good health. But with it was a com
munique vowing to kill him of the government does not
agree to free "communist prisoners" by tomorrow.
The government, which turned down a proposed ex
change earlier, gave no immediate response to the ul
timatum.
The Communist Party late yesterday called on the
government to reject the terrorists' demand, declaring
the "state cannot compromise on principles and laws on
which the national community and civilized living rest."
Kissinger testifies on 'Koreagate'
Washington — Henry Kissinger testified yesterday that
he and President Jerry Ford overruled U.S. intelligence
agents in 1975 and launched the investigation of alleged
bribery and influence-buying by the South Korean gov
ernment.
Kissinger told the House International Relations
Committee that until 1975, he had only been aware of
lobbying by Korean agents on Capitol Hill and elsewhere
in Washington, not allegations of large scale bribery.
However, he said he was aware of a 1971 letter from
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover saying that a member of
Congress had received payments from South Korean
rice dealer Tongsun Park.
Former FBI chief pleads innocent
Washington — Five blocks from where J. Edgar Hoover
reigned so long over the FBI, his short-term successor
pleaded innocent yesterday to charges of trampling the
civil rights of Americans while searching for radical
bombers.
"Not guilty," said L. Patrick Gray to the accusation that
he conspired with two other top FBI officials to injure
and oppress citizens of the United States.
"Not guilty," said Mark Felt, a former acting associate
director. And "not guilty," said Edward Miller, former
assistant director of the domestic intelligence division.

FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover saying that a member of
Congress had received payments from South Korean
