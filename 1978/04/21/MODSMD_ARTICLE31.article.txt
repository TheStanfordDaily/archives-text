Dance-A-Thon benefits
Three houses will be raising money today and Satur
day for the Dance-A-Thon scheduled for April 28 in the
Inner Quad. The Pizzeria in the Italian House will be
open today (a Friday night first) from 7 p.m. to midnight,
and Saturday night from 5 p.m. to midnight. The Pizzeria
will donate labor and proceeds from both nights to the
dance.
Saturday night the Creperie in the French House will
be open from 5 to 11 p.m., serving a broad variety of
dinner and dessert crepes. All labor and proceeds will
also be donated.
Kappa Alpha fraternity will be selling hamburgers
today at their 12:30 tos p.m. Lakeras part of their efforts
to raise funds. Dance-A-Thon planners are hoping you
will eat pizza, crepes or burgers this weekend, and help
Stanford reach its $10,000 goal for Muscular Dystrophy.
Aqua Follies
The long range weather prediction (for what that is
worth) for Sunday shows clear skies and temperatures in
the 70s. This should be reason enough to head to Lake
Lagunita. But if it isn't, the fact that the Aqua Follies will
be held starting at noon that day should be. Water ski
shows, house competitions and a dunking booth will be
just a few of the attractions awaiting all Sunday after
noon on the peaceful shores of Lake Lag.
Housing Draw
Today is the final day of the annual Spring housing
draw. Those of you who haven't had the courage to try
your luck may find encouragement that the number one
is still up for grabs. So is 4999 and 5000. Good Luck.
