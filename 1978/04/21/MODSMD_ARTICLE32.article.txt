# Off-campus life not bad, survey of students reveals

Pick a bad draw number? Maybe
you should consider living off cam
pus.
A recent survey by the Office of
Student Affairs (OSA) shows that a
majority of off-campus students pol
led are happy with their living situa
tion.
About 500 students responded to
an OSA questionnaire sent to a ran
dom sample of 1000 off-campus un-

dergraduate and graduate students
last spring.
According to the report, the "sur
vey uncovered no serious problems
experienced by off-campus stu
dents. To the contrary, most seem to
be content, and many are emphati
cally positive about life off campus."
About 66 per cent of the polled
off-campus students preferred their
current living situation and did not
wish to return to University housing.

in a similar 1974 study, 44 per cent of
off-campus undergraduates did not
want to return.
"The level of satisfaction of stu
dent living off-campus is higher than
it was two years ago," said Sally Cole,
director of research for the dean of
student affairs.
She said she guesses increased
satisfaction is partially due to the in
stallment of the Guaranteed Housing
Plan. Under the plan, students know
which year they will be living off
campus and can prepare housing
arrangements accordingly. With
more time to search for housing, last
minute hassles are eliminated and
students are more likely to find satis
factory accommodations, she added.
Cole said, however, that it is also
possible students are more satisfied
with their on-campus living ar
rangements than were their 1974
counterparts.
"Our guess is that the improve
ment off-campus is real and is dis
tinct from any general improvement
that may have occurred â€” but that is
only a guess and should be recog
nized as such," the survey reports.
The questionnaire focused on the
positive and negative aspects of off
campus living.
The most common off-campus be
nefits respondents mentioned in
cluded "privacy, increased indepen
dence and flexibility in meals."
Bob Hauptman, a first year Busi
ness School student, said "It's nice to
come home, sit down, and not be in
Wilbur."
Joni Christiansen, a senior who
lived off-campus in fall 1976, said she
felt the experience "broadens your
perspective." She sees on-campus
living as "fun, but not very realistic."
Isolation, difficulty becoming in
volved with faculty and students and
missing events on campus were the
three off-campus drawbacks re
spondents most frequently listed.
These disadvantages were cited
fewer times in 1977 than in 1974 sur
veys.
Greg Scammel, an off-campus co
terminal student, said "I basically
have to go to campus to see anyone,
because there's nothing much hap
pening here."
