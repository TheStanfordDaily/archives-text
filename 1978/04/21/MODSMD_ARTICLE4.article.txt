# Survey explores rationale for sit-in
## 
### 
Moral convictions and political be
liefs were listed as the most common
reasons why 294 Stanford students
participated in a sit-in at Old Union
last May, according to a recent sur
vey.
Of the protesters, 85 participated
in a telephone survey conducted by a
graduate communication class for
the Stanford News Service.
Nearly two-thirds of those inter
viewed said they thought the protest
would not affect the University trus
tees or the governments in South Af
rica. However, almost that many be
lieved that the sit-in would stimulate
similar demonstrations across the
nation, according to the survey.
"I felt that the rally was a big step,"
one student said. "It went smoothly
and the fact that it touched off a lot of
thingsaround the nation was good."
Some protesters criticized what
they called the lack of concern by
Stanford students over the issue.
One protester, James Lutz, said he
felt "sorry for the students who were
not involved in the sit-in. In a sense
they couldn't break out of classes
and studying to find out what was
going on. They couldn't think of
things beyond their own lives," he
added.
Another protester, James Orens
tein, said Stanford student apathy
stems from too much concern about
their studies. "Some Stanford stu
dents are not interested in anything
outside their chosen careers,"
Orenstein said, "and they're the type
of person who is common at Stan
ford.
"I feel those who are not in
terested in politics are missing some
thing," he added.
Many of the protesters are still in
volved with the South Africa ques
tion. About 71 per cent said they

were still trying to influence Stan
ford's position on the issue. Half of
those said they continued to be in
volved with Stanford Committee for
a Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP).
The protesters also view them
selves as being more liberal than the
average Stanford student according
to the survey.
Asked where they would place
themselves on a scale which ranged
from zero for "conservative" to 1000
for "very liberal," protesters re
sponses averaged 812. They placed
their mothers at 579 on the same
scale, fathers at 532, and the average
Stanford student at 521, the survey
said. r
President Lyman was rated at 420
and the government of South Africa
at 107.
Only 15 of the protesters said they
thought of themselves as "radical,"
placing themselves off the scale.
Many of those arrested said they
felt they had a lot in common with
the civil rights protesters of the '60s
but see themselves as quite different
from the Vietnam War de
monstrators, the survey said.
"Ours was a movemerft that was a
little more conservative. The average
student was more conservative than
the average student in the civil rights
demonstrations," said Kenneth
Farbstein, one of the protesters here.
"With the civil rights de
monstrators, they had to make more
of a committment. They had the
same kind of zeal. They were also
ideologues," said Farbstein.
About 60 per cent of the students
surveyed were dissatisfied with the
handling of their cases in court.
Penalties included $65 fines, 50 hours
of community service, and six
months probation depending upon

the extent of involvement in the sit
in, the survey said.
Those protesters surveyed felt
their parents would accept their de
cision to participate in the sit-in.
"They didn't like the arrest," one
student said, "but they reacted
favorably to my explanation of why I
attended the rally."
About two-thirds of the protesters

said they thought their mothers
would approve or be "neither ap
proving nor disapproving" of their
arrest. A slight majority rated their
fathers that way.
Nine months after the sit-in, when
the survey was conducted, seven
students said their mothers were still
unaware of the arrest while nine said
their fathers didn't know.

in, the survey said.
Those protesters surveyed felt
their parents would accept their de
cision to participate in the sit-in.
"They didn't like the arrest," one
student said, "but they reacted
favorably to my explanation of why I
attended the rally."
About two-thirds of the protesters

said they thought their mothers
would approve or be "neither ap
proving nor disapproving" of their
arrest. A slight majority rated their
fathers that way.
Nine months after the sit-in, when
the survey was conducted, seven
students said their mothers were still
unaware of the arrest while nine said
their fathers didn't know.
Moral convictions and political be
liefs were listed as the most common
reasons why 294 Stanford students
participated in a sit-in at Old Union
last May, according to a recent sur
vey.
Of the protesters, 85 participated
in a telephone survey conducted by a
graduate communication class for
the Stanford News Service.
Nearly two-thirds of those inter
viewed said they thought the protest
would not affect the University trus
tees or the governments in South Af
rica. However, almost that many be
lieved that the sit-in would stimulate
similar demonstrations across the
nation, according to the survey.
"I felt that the rally was a big step,"
one student said. "It went smoothly
and the fact that it touched off a lot of
thingsaround the nation was good."
Some protesters criticized what
they called the lack of concern by
Stanford students over the issue.
One protester, James Lutz, said he
felt "sorry for the students who were
not involved in the sit-in. In a sense
they couldn't break out of classes
and studying to find out what was
going on. They couldn't think of
things beyond their own lives," he
added.
Another protester, James Orens
tein, said Stanford student apathy
stems from too much concern about
their studies. "Some Stanford stu
dents are not interested in anything
outside their chosen careers,"
Orenstein said, "and they're the type
of person who is common at Stan
ford.
"I feel those who are not in
terested in politics are missing some
thing," he added.
Many of the protesters are still in
volved with the South Africa ques
tion. About 71 per cent said they

were still trying to influence Stan
ford's position on the issue. Half of
those said they continued to be in
volved with Stanford Committee for
a Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP).
The protesters also view them
selves as being more liberal than the
average Stanford student according
to the survey.
Asked where they would place
themselves on a scale which ranged
from zero for "conservative" to 1000
for "very liberal," protesters re
sponses averaged 812. They placed
their mothers at 579 on the same
scale, fathers at 532, and the average
Stanford student at 521, the survey
said. r
President Lyman was rated at 420
and the government of South Africa
at 107.
Only 15 of the protesters said they
thought of themselves as "radical,"
placing themselves off the scale.
Many of those arrested said they
felt they had a lot in common with
the civil rights protesters of the '60s
but see themselves as quite different
from the Vietnam War de
monstrators, the survey said.
"Ours was a movemerft that was a
little more conservative. The average
student was more conservative than
the average student in the civil rights
demonstrations," said Kenneth
Farbstein, one of the protesters here.
"With the civil rights de
monstrators, they had to make more
of a committment. They had the
same kind of zeal. They were also
ideologues," said Farbstein.
About 60 per cent of the students
surveyed were dissatisfied with the
handling of their cases in court.
Penalties included $65 fines, 50 hours
of community service, and six
months probation depending upon

the extent of involvement in the sit
in, the survey said.
