Washington (AP) â€” A South Korean
jetliner, carrying 113 persons and re
ported missing over the polar ice
cap, entered Soviet airspace and was
forced down by Soviet military jets,
official sources said last night.
Administration and Pentagon offi
cials, who asked not to be named,
said last night that based on radar
tracking they "have reason to be
lieve" the plane had entered Soviet
air space and was on the ground in a

remote corner of Russia.
Asked if the plane was forced or
shot down, one Defense Depart
ment official said, "I don't think we
know enough to say."
Another official said the two most
likely alternatives were either an ac
cident or Soviet action to force the
plane to the ground. However, one
source said later that the jetliner was
forced down by Soviet jets.
The airliner was en route to South

Korea from Paris with a refueling stop
in Anchorage, Alaska, the Federal Av
iation Administration (FAA) said.
The Korean Airlines Boeing 707
was due in Anchorage at 10:44 a.m.
AST (12:44 p.m. PST). It was last re
ported over the polar ice cap in a
signal received at Bodo, Norway, at
6:51 a.m. AST, and was reported
overdue at 9 a.m. AST when it did not
report in at scheduled cleckpoints
after Bodo, the FAA said.
One government official said all
countries in the vicinity of the air
craft's route had been asked for in
formation, including the Soviet Un
ion.
The missing plane's route would
have brought it over Komakuk on
Canada's north coast, then to Fort
Yukon, Alaska, en route to Anchor
age. Then the plane was scheduled
to fly on to Tokyo, authorities said.
"We're cooperating closely with
the Koreans," said one official, not
ing that the Soviet Union and South
Korea do not maintain diplomatic re
lations.
The officials said they had no word
on possible casualties, damage to the
plane or whether any Americans
were aboard.
Meanwhile, The Washington Post
quoted unnamed officials as saying
that Soviet jets scrambled to meet
the Boeing 707 as it entered Russian
air space and forced it down on a
frozen lake near Finland and the Arc
tic Circle.
Canadian Air Force planes had
launched a search in the Northwest
Territories for the missing Boeing
707.
A Korean Airlines official in An
chorage said an emergency locator
beacon signal had been picked up,
but the official was unable to give the
location. The airline cautioned that
the source of the signal was un
known.
The Canadian planes would re
trace the 707's scheduled route, offi
cials said, and search electronically
even after dark if necessary.
