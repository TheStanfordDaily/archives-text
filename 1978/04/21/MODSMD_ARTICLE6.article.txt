# Students apathetic about Honor Code
## 
### Susan Hart 
A recent University survey shows
many students do not comply with
the Honor Code here, according to
Honor Code Commission member
Patrick Flinn.
The commission's survey revealed
that a large portion of the 1344 stu
dents polled said if they saw another
student cheating they would "do no
thing."
However, according to the code,
which is agreed to by every student
who registers at the University, its
effectiveness depends on the "indi
vidual and collective desire of all
nembers of the community to pre

vent and deter violations."
By comparing Honor Code survey
results by year, the commission
"found that as students go through
Stanford and believe themselves to
be more familiar with the Honor
Code, the more likely they are to sit
back and watch someone else cheat
without intervening," said Flinn.
One group of students who took
the survey was given a five to 10 mi
nute talk on the Honor Code by their
professor prior to competing the
questionnaire. Another group re
ceived no lecture.
"The only direct effect of having
professors talk was that students be
came more familiar with the Honor
Code," Flinn said.
"If you can get students ultimately
more familiar with the code, the final
reality will dawn on them that they be
honest and take an active role in se
eing that the student body as a whole
remain honest."
The commission, in its interim re
port, stated there is a continual prob
lem in educating new and returning
students about the Honor Code. The
report also stated the best method of
informing students is through the fa
culty "for they are in the unique posi
tion of being able to communicate
directly to the students over a sus
tained period of time."
However, a 1976 survey conducted
by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council revealed that many faculty
members "were uninformed about
the technicalities of the code."
For example, that survey showed
many faculty members felt that proc
toring exams (staying in examination
rooms to prevent cheating) was ac
ceptable procedure under the Honor
Code.
The code, however, prohibits
proctoring and assumes students are
honest and will police each other by

reporting cheating to professors who
then turn the matter over to the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative
Council.
The commission asked the Faculty
Senate Steering Committee in
November that instructors affirm
their "obligation" to the code. The
steering committee denied any obli
gation to the code but recognized
that "the administration of and edu
cation about the Honor Code are a
joint responsibility of the faculty and
students."

ducted by Flinn and Sherilyn Gilbert,
