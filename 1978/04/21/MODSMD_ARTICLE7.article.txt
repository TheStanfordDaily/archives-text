# Prospects poor for immediate construction
## Sand Hill Road controversy continues 
### Edie Ross 
News analysis
The proposed Sand Hill Road extension has
been a target of controversy between local en
vironmentalists and the city councils of Menlo
Park and Palo Alto for more than six years, accord
ing to Andrew Doty, director of community rela
tions at Stanford.
The extension would extend from Santa Cruz
Avenue to El Camino Real.
The objectives of this $6.8 million construction
project are to improve access to the Stanford
Shopping Center and to decrease traffic conges
tion on the present two-lane Willow Road, accord
ing to city council members.
Environmentalists, however, maintain that
widening the road will be the first step toward
building an expressway between Interstate High
way 280 and the Bayshore Freeway.
This expressway would disturb what are cur
rently quiet residential areas and open-space, en
vironmentalists add.
Prospects for immediate construction appear
unlikely though, because of two lawsuits which
contest the Environmental Impact Report (EIR).
The EIR is required under the 1970 California En
vironmental Ouality Act for any government pro
jects which have a significant effect on the envi
ronment.
In one of the lawsuits, Palo Alto residents Joseph

Carleton and Ellie Gioumousis allege discrepan
cies between the final approved Sand Hill project
and the original road route covered in the EIR.
However, on March 28 the city councils commis
sioned a new EIR, causing the Carleton-
Cioumousis suit to be dropped, according to Ken
Schreiber, Palo Alto assistant planning director.
Schreiber added the revised EIR may be com
pleted by June, yet council approval, construction
drawings, and bids all must be received before
construction can start. This means construction is
unlikely to begin earlier than one year from now,
he added.
The latest suit, Cross-Stiles, is filed in U.S.
District Court in the name of the Committee for
Safe and Sensible San Francisquito'Routing As
sociation, a group of Menlo Park and Palo Alto
residents. The suit seeks an injunction against
proceeding with construction. A court decision is
not expected before june.
The first lawsuit caused a new EIR to be commis
sioned and delayed construction. The second has
potential to further delay construction, according
to Palo Alto City Attorney Robert Booth.
Cross-Stiles lawsuit
The Cross-Stiles suit urges consideration of
broader issues before expanding the road, said
Nancy Cross, one of the plaintiffs. Cross said she
would like to see increased bus transportation as
an alternative to expanding the road.
"The basic problem of traffic congestion uI in

tersections would not be alleviated by the pro
posed road alignment. It is not a sensible solution,
Cross said.
Supporters of the proposed expansion do not
think the lawsuit will stop the project. "We don't
think she has the power to do it," said Booth. In
the meantime, every month's delay will add about
$30,000 to the project's cost because of inflation,
according to city officials.
Further building and construction develop
ments are contingent on proceeding with the Sand
Hill project, said Doty. Plans include an extension
of Campus Drive past the golf course driving range
to Junipero Serra Boulevard and a 1000-1500 unit
housing development along Sand Hill Road.
Land-use plans
Stanford has been responsive in the past to
community concerns about land-use plans which
reduce Stanford's undeveloped land. According
to Vice President for Business and Finance William
Massy, allowing public access to San Francisquito
Creek near the Sand Hill extension by the trustees
is one such effort.
The widening of Sand Hill Road is one example
of the kinds of land-use issues faced by Stanford
and surrounding municipalities. Under Stanford's
original land grant, outright selling of property for
development is forbidden. To accomodate Stan
ford's and localities' mutual interest in public ser
vice projects, leases for developments such as the
Sand Hill plan are used.

Schreiber added the revised EIR may be com
pleted by June, yet council approval, construction
drawings, and bids all must be received before
construction can start. This means construction is
unlikely to begin earlier than one year from now,
he added.
The latest suit, Cross-Stiles, is filed in U.S.
District Court in the name of the Committee for
Safe and Sensible San Francisquito'Routing As
sociation, a group of Menlo Park and Palo Alto
residents. The suit seeks an injunction against
proceeding with construction. A court decision is
not expected before june.
The first lawsuit caused a new EIR to be commis
sioned and delayed construction. The second has
potential to further delay construction, according
to Palo Alto City Attorney Robert Booth.
Cross-Stiles lawsuit
The Cross-Stiles suit urges consideration of
broader issues before expanding the road, said
Nancy Cross, one of the plaintiffs. Cross said she
would like to see increased bus transportation as
an alternative to expanding the road.
"The basic problem of traffic congestion uI in

tersections would not be alleviated by the pro
posed road alignment. It is not a sensible solution,
Cross said.
Supporters of the proposed expansion do not
think the lawsuit will stop the project. "We don't
think she has the power to do it," said Booth. In
the meantime, every month's delay will add about
$30,000 to the project's cost because of inflation,
according to city officials.
Further building and construction develop
ments are contingent on proceeding with the Sand
Hill project, said Doty. Plans include an extension
of Campus Drive past the golf course driving range
to Junipero Serra Boulevard and a 1000-1500 unit
housing development along Sand Hill Road.
Land-use plans
Stanford has been responsive in the past to
community concerns about land-use plans which
reduce Stanford's undeveloped land. According
to Vice President for Business and Finance William
Massy, allowing public access to San Francisquito
Creek near the Sand Hill extension by the trustees
is one such effort.
The widening of Sand Hill Road is one example
of the kinds of land-use issues faced by Stanford
and surrounding municipalities. Under Stanford's
original land grant, outright selling of property for
development is forbidden. To accomodate Stan
ford's and localities' mutual interest in public ser
vice projects, leases for developments such as the
Sand Hill plan are used.
News analysis
The proposed Sand Hill Road extension has
been a target of controversy between local en
vironmentalists and the city councils of Menlo
Park and Palo Alto for more than six years, accord
ing to Andrew Doty, director of community rela
tions at Stanford.
The extension would extend from Santa Cruz
Avenue to El Camino Real.
The objectives of this $6.8 million construction
project are to improve access to the Stanford
Shopping Center and to decrease traffic conges
tion on the present two-lane Willow Road, accord
ing to city council members.
Environmentalists, however, maintain that
widening the road will be the first step toward
building an expressway between Interstate High
way 280 and the Bayshore Freeway.
This expressway would disturb what are cur
rently quiet residential areas and open-space, en
vironmentalists add.
Prospects for immediate construction appear
unlikely though, because of two lawsuits which
contest the Environmental Impact Report (EIR).
The EIR is required under the 1970 California En
vironmental Ouality Act for any government pro
jects which have a significant effect on the envi
ronment.
In one of the lawsuits, Palo Alto residents Joseph

Carleton and Ellie Gioumousis allege discrepan
cies between the final approved Sand Hill project
and the original road route covered in the EIR.
However, on March 28 the city councils commis
sioned a new EIR, causing the Carleton-
Cioumousis suit to be dropped, according to Ken
Schreiber, Palo Alto assistant planning director.
Schreiber added the revised EIR may be com
pleted by June, yet council approval, construction
drawings, and bids all must be received before
construction can start. This means construction is
unlikely to begin earlier than one year from now,
