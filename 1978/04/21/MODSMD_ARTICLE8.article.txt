# Funding actions defended

Grethel et al.

We are compromising for the sole
reason that since the senate meeting
of April 4, 1978, Disorientation Week
(D.O. Week) organizers received
unexpected revenues making up the
balance of our original request.
We continue to deny the validity of
our opponents' argument and tactics
with regard to our actions and would
like to take this opportunity to exp
lain the political perspective from
which we approach these actions.
We defend our actions. The SOC
slate was elected on the basis of a
commitment to radical social and
political change. Stanford
epitomizes the racist, sexist,
heterosexist and elitist nature of the
United States and the upper classes
of Western capitalist society.
The reason that SOC and other
progressive/radical groups exist, is to
fight against the reactionary forces
that oppress people in their struggle
for liberation. To that end, we
formed a slate of candidates to run
for offices in the bourgeois democra
tic system that is known at Stanford
as the ASSU.
We chose this tactic because, at
the time, we believed that student
government provided a forum for
raising political questions and
educating the Stanford community
as to the elitist character of this uni
versity.
We have, admittedly, failed miser
ably in our attempt to provide such
an education. The reason we failed is
that we did not recognize the incred
ibly repressive effects built into the
structures of bourgeois democratic
forums.
We nevertheless see in D.O.Week
an opportunity to support a program
furthering the accomplishment of our

political goals. This week will be a
series of programs designed to en
lighten people as to the struggles of
Third World people, women, gay
men and lesbians, and workers
within our society and elsewhere.
No qualms
D.O. Week is specifically the kind
of activity for which the discretionary
fund monies should be used. We
have no qualms about using the se
nate's resources to fund this week's
activities.
In view of the importance of
D.O.Week for the fulfillment of
goals to which we committed ourse
lves when we ran for the senate, we
have (had) no reservations about ap
propriating substantial amounts of
money to educate the Stanford
community.
We would have been willing to al
locate the whole of the discretionary
fund had the organizers of D.O.
Week needed and sought that
amount.
In saying this, we explicitly and
proudly acknowledge our actions are
in furtherance of our political goals.
We are not ashamed of our politics,
and since practice is the other side of
theory we are not afraid to act in ac
cordance with our politics.
There are those who say that poli
tics do not belong in the ASSU Se
nate; that "fairness," and fidelity to
our constituency as opposed to polit
ical commitment ought to be the
primary parameters of decision mak
ing. To those we can only say you are
sadly mistaken; you are engaging in
extreme naivete or deliberate subter
fuge.
Inequalities masked
"Fair" procedures acting upon an
initial unfair distribution of re-

sources, power, etc., will tend not to
redistribute these resources, power,
etc., but will tend rather to the pre
servation of the statue quo. Pro
cedural democracy ought not be
used to mask the inequalities which
lie underneath it.
We have sought by our actions and
by this statement to inject a level of
political awareness into the ASSU
government. We pause, finally, to
note our hope that the campus
media, particularly the Daily and
KZSU, will convey our feelings to the
students.
The Daily has consistently
throughout the tenure of the SOC
slate, excized any political content
from their reporting of senate ac
tivities.
Our attempts at political
education cannot succeed without
dissemination of our views to the pub
lic and the only effective means of
such dissemination is through the
campus media. Surely, the political
realities underlying the actions of
their elected representatives is of in
terest to Stanford students.
