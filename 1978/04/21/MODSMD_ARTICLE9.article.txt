It is to my great dismay that soror
ity preference parties will be held to
night. April 21 is the first night of
Passover, on which Jews all over the
world observe the traditional seder
service and meal, and complicating
the tensions of rush with this conflict
puts Jewish rushees in an uncom
fortable situation.
I understand that this conflict was
unintentional, and I understand that
individual sororities have been ad
vised by the ISC to consider the con
flict when Jewish rushees must re
fuse invitations to their parties.
What I have difficulty understand
ing is the prevailing attitude of
"Sorry, there's nothing we can do
about it," when, in fact, the parties
could have been moved up to Satur
day night. True, that would have in
volved some inconvenience, but in
keeping with the spirit of fairness to
all, it seems worthwhile.
It is important to realize that pre
ference parties work two ways.
While sorority members are getting
to know each prospective member,
each rushee is deciding whether or
not she feels comfortable with that
sorority's members.
Assuming that each sorority fol
lows the advice of the ISC, and con
siders the religious conflict linked
with a Jewish rushee's absence, that
rushee still misses the opportunity to
acquaint herself with her prospective
sorority sisters.
If modeled after the unique frater
nity system at Stanford, sororities
can serve a very positive function. I
think that sororities should be an op
tion for interested students, and the
high caliber of people here adds
even more to the groups' potential
success.
It is a shame that the first sorority
rush at Stanford in over 30 years

usurps an entire sector of the
rushees, and I sincerely hope that in
the future, rush chairpersons will be
more sensitive to minority groups on
campus. Sue Goldfarb

SOC does it again
In voting $1700 to subsidize their
own Disorientation Week, the SOC
bloc in the senate again de
monstrated their lack of concern for
anything but their own pet projects.
With all the worthy organizations on
this campus, I don't understand why
42 per cent of the senate's discretio
nary fund has to be spent on this one
project. Forty-two per cent on any
one project is too much, and 42 per
cent spent on such a blatantly politi
cal project is outrageous.
Those apolitical events in Dis
orientation Week are overshadowed
by political speakers like Angela
Davis, Harvey Milk (gay politician),
Paul Sweezy (radical economist),
Huey Newton, and a film on the col
lectivization of a North Korean steel
mill. It's not what you would call a
balanced program.
It's great to have speakers and
films that represent the radical view
point. But it's wrong that such large
amounts of student funds are being
used to promote this viewpoint.
The senate discretionary fund is in
danger of being transformed into a
slush fund for SOC activities, and I
think it's time to protest this and
other infusions of radical politics into
student government. It's about time
that the SOC people in the senate
realize that they represent the entire
student body and not just fringe
elements.

SOC does it again
In voting $1700 to subsidize their
own Disorientation Week, the SOC
bloc in the senate again de
monstrated their lack of concern for
anything but their own pet projects.
With all the worthy organizations on
this campus, I don't understand why
42 per cent of the senate's discretio
nary fund has to be spent on this one
project. Forty-two per cent on any
one project is too much, and 42 per
cent spent on such a blatantly politi
cal project is outrageous.
Those apolitical events in Dis
orientation Week are overshadowed
by political speakers like Angela
Davis, Harvey Milk (gay politician),
Paul Sweezy (radical economist),
Huey Newton, and a film on the col
lectivization of a North Korean steel
mill. It's not what you would call a
balanced program.
It's great to have speakers and
films that represent the radical view
point. But it's wrong that such large
amounts of student funds are being
used to promote this viewpoint.
The senate discretionary fund is in
danger of being transformed into a
slush fund for SOC activities, and I
think it's time to protest this and
other infusions of radical politics into
student government. It's about time
that the SOC people in the senate
realize that they represent the entire
student body and not just fringe
elements.

Watch conflicts
It is to my great dismay that soror
ity preference parties will be held to
night. April 21 is the first night of
Passover, on which Jews all over the
world observe the traditional seder
service and meal, and complicating
the tensions of rush with this conflict
puts Jewish rushees in an uncom
fortable situation.
I understand that this conflict was
unintentional, and I understand that
individual sororities have been ad
vised by the ISC to consider the con
flict when Jewish rushees must re
fuse invitations to their parties.
What I have difficulty understand
ing is the prevailing attitude of
"Sorry, there's nothing we can do
about it," when, in fact, the parties
could have been moved up to Satur
day night. True, that would have in
volved some inconvenience, but in
keeping with the spirit of fairness to
all, it seems worthwhile.
It is important to realize that pre
ference parties work two ways.
While sorority members are getting
to know each prospective member,
each rushee is deciding whether or
not she feels comfortable with that
sorority's members.
Assuming that each sorority fol
lows the advice of the ISC, and con
siders the religious conflict linked
with a Jewish rushee's absence, that
rushee still misses the opportunity to
acquaint herself with her prospective
sorority sisters.
If modeled after the unique frater
nity system at Stanford, sororities
can serve a very positive function. I
think that sororities should be an op
tion for interested students, and the
high caliber of people here adds
even more to the groups' potential
success.
It is a shame that the first sorority
rush at Stanford in over 30 years

usurps an entire sector of the
rushees, and I sincerely hope that in
the future, rush chairpersons will be
more sensitive to minority groups on
campus. Sue Goldfarb
