## Divestment and bank loans 
### 
Rodney Adams

According to the quotation attributed to SCRIP
spokesperson Maggie Coud, "SCRIP still supports di
vestment," I am impressed. SCRIP has certainly been
consistent in its position. Having chosen to demand
divestment last year in May, SCRIP has adhered to this
position to date.
I think readers of the Daily should be aware that most
shareholder advocates do not propose divestment.
Rather, those who have submitted proposals argue for
retention of stocks. Owning stock gives those sharehol
ders concerned about a company's activities "leverage"
toward effecting change. Divestment is in actual fact a
corollary to the old Wall Street rule, if you don't like
what a company is doing then sell the stock. Corporate
officers who would prefer not to hear from dissident
shareholders usually suggest that the shareholder sell
his stock, that is divest, and of course at the same time
give up all those votes (each share carries one vote).
Attacking people
There is a world of difference between divestment of a
company's stock and corporate withdrawal of assets, a
difference which many do not perceive. I acknowledge
that the act of divestment is a form of communication to
management, but I note that it is a symbolic gesture
made through the media and very likely would do more
to antagonize, rather then encourage, a corporation to
take the action proposed. Remember, corporations are
not "things," they are people. As a specific instance, the
rally and march on Friday was focused on the Bank of
America. The Bank of America is an organization of over
72,000 people. An attack on the bank is an attack on
these people, and their actions . One bank employee,
quoted in Friday's paper (Daily, April 14), made this
point quite clearly.
In the photograph on the front of last Thursday's

paper (Daily April 13), SCRIP protestors were shown
carrying signs. One large sign stated "NO MORE
BANK LOANS." I hope the bank does not take this liter
ally. While I personally object to the bank making any
loans to the government of South Africa, I note that the
bank does not have any such loans outstanding. And, I
hope that the bank will take a further stand and issue a
policy statement that they will not make any loans to
either the South African government or its agencies.
Student loans
At the same time, I am counting on the bank to make
more loans: loans to students. A SCRIP speaker is
quoted as saying, "We've been checking out Bank of
America and they look pretty shaky all over." SCRIP, and
especially the person carrying that placard, might like to <
know that the Bank of America has made more direct
federally insured student loans than any other institu
tion in the United States, with over $407 million loaned
so far.
In 1977 alone over 20,000 loans were made, even
though the default and delinquency rate on these loans
are 10-20 times as great as consumer loans. Many banks
have curtailed or eliminated student loans, despite the
federal insurance, because of this. Should the bank stop
making student loans? They're pretty shaky, given the
problems with repayment.
I respect the right of SCRIP members to express moral
indignation at the acts of others. Yet in my opinion a
blind attack on any institution, chanting simple slogans,
is irresponsible. Sure, the bank is imperfect and could
do some things differently. Maybe I would feel more
comfortable if those who lead the protest were without
sin (John, Chapter VIII, Verse 7).
