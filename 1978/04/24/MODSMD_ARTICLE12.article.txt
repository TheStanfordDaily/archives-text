N-bomb necessary
In recent months we have heard
two major arguments against de
ployment of the neutron bomb. The
first argument is that it is immoral to
produce a weapon that does not de
stroy property as well as lives. Some
how it is supposed to be better to
indiscriminately destroy homes and
factories, leaving the air and earth
poisoned by long-lasting radioactiv
ity. The most moral weapon should
then be one that makes the entire
earth uninhabitable.
Arguments that the neutron bomb
would lower the nuclear threshold
are specious, for in the event of a
Warsaw Pact invasion of Western
Europe NATO would be forced to
use tactical nuclear weapons for de
fense, whether neutron warheads
were available to nor. NATO's con
ventional forces are totally in

adequate for defense against an
overwhelmingly superior Warsaw
Pact. The only alternative to the use
of tactical nuclear weapons is sur
render; if this is to be considered a
legitimate strategy then NATO might
as well abandon all efforts to main
tain a defense.
The use of neutron warheads
rather than ordinary tactical nuclear
weapons would greatly reduce civi
lian losses and all but eliminate the
devastation of homes and factories
that would accompany use of ordi
nary tactical nuclear weapons. This is
because the lethal radius and the
blast radius of the neutron bomb are
both significantly less than those of
ordinary small nuclear warheads.
Enemy targets closer to civilians
could be eliminated without civilian
losses.
Thus the neutron bomb would en
hance the credibility of NATO's de
fense, not because its use would be
initiated where the use of other tacti
cal nuclear weapons would not, but
because once tactical nuclear
weapons were brought into play the
neutron bomb could repel an attack
more effectively with fewer civilian
casualties.
The neutron bomb is a defensive
weapon which would reduce the
likelihood of nuclear war by more
effectively deterring a Warsaw Pact
invasion of Western Europe.

The Draw
There's something wrong with this
system. I suppose that's a rather bra
zen statement coming from a
freshman who has no viable alterna
tives to offer. And perhaps it is also a
statement that smacks of sour grapes
coming from someone who hustled
almost every available priority on
campus and then drew a number in
the vicinity of 3500 (much to the
chagrin of his three drawjpartners).
However, it is a statement that would
be heartily affirmed by a vast majority
of the people who drew over 2000
and thus have little or no chance of
living in a "priority" house.
It seems to me that there must be

another method of house selection
or assignment that doesn't double
the intensity of fraternity rush and
halve the intensity of academic pur
suit. In several other schools this
chaotic situation is replaced by a
housing selection process based on
"merit" (i.e. year in school and qual
ity of past residences on campus).
Surely a system could be devised
whereby a junior with a guaranteed
year to come, who had lived out in
the wilds of Lagunita Court his
freshman year, the trailers during
sophomore year, and off-campus
junior year, would deserve priority
over a Branner freshman drawing for
the first time.
A final kink in the system involves
fraternity housing. While there are
those who actually prefer the frater
nity system to the University housing
system and the idea of living in a
fraternity, there are a great number
of students who regard frats as a
back-up to the draw. While this
"back-up" is unfair in that women
are not afforded the same options
(right now), it is also unfair to the
fraternity system. Because no matter
how carefully screened those who
receive bids are, there will still be a
fair number of men who join frater
nities simply because they drew
poorly.
Sour grapes maybe, but a reality
for more than half the under
graduates here.

Explore German culture
Androgyny house is giving way to a
new theme house, which is to
explore German culture. I hope the
founders and leaders of Haus Mit
teleuropa will eschew the Disney
land view of Germany — a cheery
nation of lederhosened lads with not
a thought beyond their sausages and
beer — and truly examine German
culture and its significance to the
world.
Their findings will not be pleasant.
Despite its brilliance in music,
philosophy, and science, Germany
will always bring to mind one chilling
fact: it did the most evil thing ever

done upon the planet. And you just
can't explain away the systematic
slaughter of six million Jews as a
slight lapse in gemutlichkeit.
To blame the Germanpeop/eis ra
cist and wrong. For one thing there
were heroic Germans *vho resisted
or quietly refused to participate in
the Final Solution. Foranother, many
nations — the U.S. included — aided
the butchery, either directly or by re
fusing sanctuary to possible re
fugees. But something there is in
German culture, something dark and
deep, that led to an extraordinary
obsession, baffling even to Italy and
Japan, an obsession that may well
have cost the Reich a world empire.
Haus Mitteleuropa should ask why.
The Holocaust has become a sub
ject of intense academic scrutiny. Yet
almost of all of the scholars are
Jewish, Concerned with the mur
dered rather than the murderers.
What about the German problem?
Germany itself has chosen not to
think about it. The Nazi era is deleted
in school history courses; few Ger
man teenagers today can so much as
identify Hitler. Vet something leads
young Neo-nazis to deface
cemeteries (there are few live Jews
left in Germany to torment.).
Something leads young German
soldiers to play at a game where little
pieces of paper with the word "Jew"
written on them are burned in neat
little piles. Why?
Haus Mitteleuropa can ignore
these questions. It can drown the
shrieks of burning infants with

Conspiracy of silence
San Francisco Supervisor Harvey
Milk spoke at Stanford Saturday,
April 15. His speech, to an overflow
crowd in Kresge Auditorium, was
part of the lead-off event of Disorien
tation Week.
Harvey Milk is the first openly gay,
elected official west of the Missis

sippi and a long-time leader of the
gay community.
While we realize that your front
page (Daily, April 17) was crowded
with important copy about the seven
Stanford women who were photo
graphed by a Playboy photographer,
we are surprised that there wasn't
room for even one word about this
event.
In his speech, Supervisor Milk
talked about the emerging coalition
of third-world people, women, gays
and working people in San Francisco
and across the nation. He also dis
cussed attempts by conservative
elements to fragment and discredit
this coalition. In particular, he noted
that the news media, much of it
owned by those conservative ele
ments, has created a campaign of
media hype to convince us that
"America is turning to the right."
Groups and events aimed at further
ing the coalition of progressive
groups are met with a conspiracy of
silence.
We feel that the Daily has partici
pated in this conspiracy of silence.
No GPU sponsored event has re
ceived Daily coverage this year. We
hope that in the future significant
events will be covered by the Daily
regardless of their political content.

N-bomb necessary
In recent months we have heard
two major arguments against de
ployment of the neutron bomb. The
first argument is that it is immoral to
produce a weapon that does not de
stroy property as well as lives. Some
how it is supposed to be better to
indiscriminately destroy homes and
factories, leaving the air and earth
poisoned by long-lasting radioactiv
ity. The most moral weapon should
then be one that makes the entire
earth uninhabitable.
Arguments that the neutron bomb
would lower the nuclear threshold
are specious, for in the event of a
Warsaw Pact invasion of Western
Europe NATO would be forced to
use tactical nuclear weapons for de
fense, whether neutron warheads
were available to nor. NATO's con
ventional forces are totally in

adequate for defense against an
overwhelmingly superior Warsaw
Pact. The only alternative to the use
of tactical nuclear weapons is sur
render; if this is to be considered a
legitimate strategy then NATO might
as well abandon all efforts to main
tain a defense.
The use of neutron warheads
rather than ordinary tactical nuclear
weapons would greatly reduce civi
lian losses and all but eliminate the
devastation of homes and factories
that would accompany use of ordi
nary tactical nuclear weapons. This is
because the lethal radius and the
blast radius of the neutron bomb are
both significantly less than those of
ordinary small nuclear warheads.
Enemy targets closer to civilians
could be eliminated without civilian
losses.
Thus the neutron bomb would en
hance the credibility of NATO's de

because once tactical nuclear

The Draw
There's something wrong with this
system. I suppose that's a rather bra
zen statement coming from a
freshman who has no viable alterna
tives to offer. And perhaps it is also a
statement that smacks of sour grapes
coming from someone who hustled
almost every available priority on
campus and then drew a number in
the vicinity of 3500 (much to the
chagrin of his three drawjpartners).
However, it is a statement that would
be heartily affirmed by a vast majority
of the people who drew over 2000
and thus have little or no chance of
living in a "priority" house.
It seems to me that there must be

another method of house selection
or assignment that doesn't double
the intensity of fraternity rush and
halve the intensity of academic pur
suit. In several other schools this
chaotic situation is replaced by a
housing selection process based on
"merit" (i.e. year in school and qual
ity of past residences on campus).
Surely a system could be devised
whereby a junior with a guaranteed
year to come, who had lived out in
the wilds of Lagunita Court his
freshman year, the trailers during
sophomore year, and off-campus
junior year, would deserve priority
over a Branner freshman drawing for
the first time.
A final kink in the system involves
fraternity housing. While there are
those who actually prefer the frater
nity system to the University housing
system and the idea of living in a
fraternity, there are a great number
of students who regard frats as a
back-up to the draw. While this
"back-up" is unfair in that women
are not afforded the same options
(right now), it is also unfair to the
fraternity system. Because no matter
how carefully screened those who
receive bids are, there will still be a
fair number of men who join frater
nities simply because they drew
poorly.
Sour grapes maybe, but a reality

Conspiracy of silence
San Francisco Supervisor Harvey
Milk spoke at Stanford Saturday,
April 15. His speech, to an overflow
crowd in Kresge Auditorium, was
part of the lead-off event of Disorien
tation Week.
Harvey Milk is the first openly gay,
elected official west of the Missis

sippi and a long-time leader of the
gay community.
While we realize that your front
page (Daily, April 17) was crowded
with important copy about the seven
Stanford women who were photo
graphed by a Playboy photographer,
we are surprised that there wasn't
room for even one word about this
event.
In his speech, Supervisor Milk
talked about the emerging coalition
of third-world people, women, gays
and working people in San Francisco
and across the nation. He also dis
cussed attempts by conservative
elements to fragment and discredit
this coalition. In particular, he noted
that the news media, much of it
owned by those conservative ele
ments, has created a campaign of
media hype to convince us that
"America is turning to the right."
Groups and events aimed at further
ing the coalition of progressive
groups are met with a conspiracy of

We feel that the Daily has partici
pated in this conspiracy of silence.
No GPU sponsored event has re

N-bomb necessary
In recent months we have heard
two major arguments against de
ployment of the neutron bomb. The
first argument is that it is immoral to
produce a weapon that does not de
stroy property as well as lives. Some
how it is supposed to be better to
indiscriminately destroy homes and
factories, leaving the air and earth
poisoned by long-lasting radioactiv
ity. The most moral weapon should
then be one that makes the entire
earth uninhabitable.
Arguments that the neutron bomb
would lower the nuclear threshold
are specious, for in the event of a
Warsaw Pact invasion of Western
Europe NATO would be forced to
use tactical nuclear weapons for de
fense, whether neutron warheads
were available to nor. NATO's con
ventional forces are totally in

adequate for defense against an
overwhelmingly superior Warsaw
Pact. The only alternative to the use
of tactical nuclear weapons is sur
render; if this is to be considered a
legitimate strategy then NATO might
as well abandon all efforts to main
tain a defense.
The use of neutron warheads
rather than ordinary tactical nuclear
weapons would greatly reduce civi
lian losses and all but eliminate the
devastation of homes and factories
that would accompany use of ordi
nary tactical nuclear weapons. This is
because the lethal radius and the
blast radius of the neutron bomb are
both significantly less than those of
ordinary small nuclear warheads.
Enemy targets closer to civilians
could be eliminated without civilian
losses.
Thus the neutron bomb would en
hance the credibility of NATO's de
fense, not because its use would be
initiated where the use of other tacti
cal nuclear weapons would not, but
because once tactical nuclear
weapons were brought into play the
neutron bomb could repel an attack
more effectively with fewer civilian
casualties.
The neutron bomb is a defensive
weapon which would reduce the
likelihood of nuclear war by more
effectively deterring a Warsaw Pact
invasion of Western Europe.

The Draw
There's something wrong with this
system. I suppose that's a rather bra
zen statement coming from a
freshman who has no viable alterna
tives to offer. And perhaps it is also a
statement that smacks of sour grapes
coming from someone who hustled
almost every available priority on
campus and then drew a number in
the vicinity of 3500 (much to the
chagrin of his three drawjpartners).
However, it is a statement that would
be heartily affirmed by a vast majority
of the people who drew over 2000
and thus have little or no chance of
living in a "priority" house.
It seems to me that there must be

another method of house selection
or assignment that doesn't double
the intensity of fraternity rush and
halve the intensity of academic pur
suit. In several other schools this
chaotic situation is replaced by a
housing selection process based on
"merit" (i.e. year in school and qual
ity of past residences on campus).
Surely a system could be devised
whereby a junior with a guaranteed
year to come, who had lived out in
the wilds of Lagunita Court his
freshman year, the trailers during
sophomore year, and off-campus
junior year, would deserve priority
over a Branner freshman drawing for
the first time.
A final kink in the system involves
fraternity housing. While there are
those who actually prefer the frater
nity system to the University housing
system and the idea of living in a
fraternity, there are a great number
of students who regard frats as a
back-up to the draw. While this
"back-up" is unfair in that women
are not afforded the same options
(right now), it is also unfair to the
fraternity system. Because no matter
how carefully screened those who
receive bids are, there will still be a
fair number of men who join frater
nities simply because they drew
poorly.
Sour grapes maybe, but a reality
for more than half the under
graduates here.
