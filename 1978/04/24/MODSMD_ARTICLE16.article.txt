# CIR recommends second withdrawal
## 
### 
By a 9 to 1 vote last week, the
Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR) voted to
recommend to the Board of
Trustees that they vote in favor
of a shareholder resolution cal
ling for Phelps Dodge Corpora
tion to "terminate its present
operations in South Africa as
expeditiously as possible."
Phelps Dodge, a mining
company, is the second firm
the CIR has recommended to
the trustees to vote in favor of a
shareholder resolution calling
for withdrawal from South Af
rica.
Two weeks ago, the CIR
voted in favor of a similar re
solution for a Texaco affiliate,
Caltex. Stanford owns 30,000
shares of Phelps Dodge.
A CIR report issued Friday
said, "Available evidence indi
cates that Phelps Dodge has
not been a particularly prog
ressive employer."
The CIR voted 8 to 2 to re
commend abstaining on a
Motorola resolution calling for
no further investment in South

Africa, no further sales to the
South African government,
and withdrawal from South Af
rica.
A clarifying letter to
Motorola management sup
porting the first two parts of
the resolution, but commend
ing the company's record of
"socially affirmative action" in
South Africa, was recom
mended by the CIR.
Stanford owns 500 shares of
Motorola.
For both Mobil and Standard
Oil of California shareholder
resolutions, the CIR voted 9 to
I to recommend to the trustees
to vote for a resolution calling
for stricter compliance with
economic sanctions against
Rhodesia by reducing oil im
ports into South Africa in 1978
by one-third.
The CIR voted unanimously
to recommend voting in favor
of a Newmont Mining resolu
tion calling for a report on af
firmative action progress in the
company's operations in
Namibia.
