# Its founders seek small-gift participation
## Senior pledge program aims to teach seniors to give 
### Carolyn Manning 
Seniors: how would you like to buy a dead
rat for the bio department? A subscription to
Ms. magazine for UGLY? Maybe you'd like to
give the karate club some wood blocks to
break?
Well now is your chance. By the end of
May, student volunteer fundraisers hope to
have personally contacted every Stanford
senior.
In order to increase alumni support, espe
cially from young alumni, two fundraising
programs are underway and aimed at
graduating seniors.
The Student Engineering Pledge Fund was
started in 1976 as a student initiated and run
program under the auspices of the Engineer
ing Fund.
New this year is the Senior Pledge Prog
ram, which will contact all seniors not co
vered by the engineering program. The
Senior Pledge Program started its drive this
week, and will run through April 28.
Senior Anne Barker, a member of the
Young Alumni-Student Development
Committee, an offshoot of the Stanford An
nual Fund heads the program. She came up
with the idea last January, suggested it, and
the committee said, "Go do it."
Barker formed a committee of 12 mem
bers that has met for an hour and a half every
week since lanuary.
"There was nothing before, it all started in
January. It's totally oriented toward our
peers. We spent a lot of time going through

ideas that would be appealing: those that
would work and those that wouldn't,"
Barker explained.
The result was what Barker called a
"%tudent-led volunteer program where
seniors call on their classmates to ask each of
them to consider three-year gift pledges to
Stanford."
The emphasis is on participation, not large
gifts, because many students plan to attend
graduate school, are paying off loans, or are
unsure about future employment.
The pledge program has two main pur
poses: to let students know what gift giving
is all about; and to encourage seniors to
begin supporting Stanford the first year fol
lowing graduation.
The high tuition here would be twice as
high without gifts to the University. Tuition
pays for only 47 per cent of a Stanford educa
tion. The remainings3 percent is made up of
gifts from alumni, corporations, founda
tions and through government support.
Barker stressed that small gifts are valu
able to the University. Last year the many
small gifts, most under $25, totaled about
$3.5 million.
Barker said the pledge program is espe
cially attractive for two reasons. First,
seniors may give to any organization here
from cancer research to overseas studies.
Students "can give to something that gave
them a lot of pleasure while they were here.
We're not worried about the size of the gifts,
just that students care enough to give at all.

"They are small amounts now. But there's
a chance that when we're a couple of years
down the road, we'll think of Stanford (when
we have more to give)," Barker said. "We
want to get people in the habit of giving to
Stanford," she added.
The second advantage, according to
Barker, is that the program is "low key."
People design their own pledge including
the amount they want to give, and what year
or month to pay. All pledges are confiden
tial, and are statements of intent, not bind
ing contracts. In addition, the lucky students
who pledge now will not receive the bi
monthly solicitations from the Stanford An
nual Fund.
Barker said the goal is to contact as many
seniors as possible. They have set up senior
pledge representatives in each campus resi
dence. Then, in order to reach the approxi
mate 50 per cent of the senior class that lives
off-campus, they have set up an information
booth in White Plaza every day at noon bet
ween April 17 and 28.
The program does not aim to raise a cer
tain amount of money, rather it aims to get a
substantial percentage of student participa
tion. Barker said alumni from Eastern
Schools have traditionally been more in
volved in fundraising for their schools than
Stanford. Barker wants to "beat
Dartmouth," but added that it's not just
rivalry. "If people see what's happening
they'll see it's worthwhile."
Often foundations and corporations that

are big donors check to see how much
alumni support the school has. If many
alumni are contributors, these organizations
are more likely to give, according to Barker.
Barker said she is "overwhelmed" at the
positive response she has received from
students so far. A great deal of that response
probably results from making personal con
tacts rather than the more ineffective tradi
tional mass mailings.
When designing the Senior pledge prog
ram, the committee looked at how the Stu
dent Engineering Pledge Fund operated
over the past two years, and designed their
program around the methods which were
most successful.
Dave Lawton, a co-terminal student in in
dustrial engineering, is this year's chairman
of the Engineering pledge fund. This prog
ram is in its third year and will start its drive
next month, with kick-off meetings May 11
and 12.
During the first year of operation (1976),
the program netted $2100 in pledges. Last
year the amount nearly doubled, reaching a
total of $4100.
The engineering program differs in sev
eral ways from the Senior Pledge program.
According to Lawton, the emphasis is on
graduating students, not just the class of
1978, so they also solicit money from master
and doctorate students.
The engineering program has less people
to contact, so its 60 volunteers each contact
only four or five other students. Lawton says

that by limiting the number of contacts to
about five per volunteer, the quality of con
tacts remains high.
Their drive runs for two weeks, May 12 to
26. Lawton stressed that the organization is
entirely student run and staffed, and open to
anyone who wants to help. Interested stu
dents should go to the first meeting on May
11.
Another difference Lawton sees between
the two programs, besides the people con
tacted, is the emphasis on a standard
pledge. While they're "glad to have anyone
pledge what they can afford," they suggest a
pledge of $50 over the three years, with $10
due the first year, $15 the second, and $25
the third.
What motivates someone to pledge
money to Stanford as a senior?
Barker suggested that it is a way students
can give back a little of what they got out of
Stanford.
Lawton agreed, saying most students are
motivated by the benefits they have received
here. Both cite "nostalgia" as a motivation
for some.
But at least one senior wasn't moved by
nostalgia or anything else to give to the
senior pledge fund.
"I have no desire to give one cent to Stan
ford at this point! I think they have a lot of
nerve to go asking seniors to give more
money. All I can think of is how broke I am
and how much broker I'm going to be over
the next few years."
