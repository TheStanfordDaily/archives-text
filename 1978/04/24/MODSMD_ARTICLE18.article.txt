# Homeopathy doctor to speak here
## 
### Mitch Fleisher 
Although most people in the United
States today do not know what
homeopathy is, at the turn of the century
one of every five physicians in most urban
areas in this country were homeopaths.
The word "homeopathy" is derived
from the Creek "homeos" meaning simi
lar and "pathos" meaning suffering.
Homeopathy is a highly systematic, effec
tive and controversial health practice
based upon reproducible natural laws of
healing that treats individuals, not dis
eases, by administering specially
prepared minute doses of plant, mineral
or animal substances.
Homeopathy is considered by many
holistic health practitioners to be one of
the most holistic approaches to medicine.
The term "holistic" implies an approach to
the attainment and maintainance of
health.
It takes into account all aspects of
human existence — not only the physical
level which is the primary concern of or
thodox medicine, but also the emotional,
mental and more subtle or spiritual ele
ments of humanity.
Remedy
A specific remedy is chosen according
to the "law of similars." This means that a
substance found to create a specific set of
symptoms in a healthy person can cure
similar symptoms in a sick person.
The homeopathic remedies work by
providing a gentle but powerful stimulus
to the sick person's inherent natural de
fense system which helps the person to
heal.
Modern applications of the "law of simi
lars" may be found inorthodox medicine's
immunization and allergy therapies. These
therapeutic modalities involve administer
ing a small dose of something that may
cause a disease in order to strengthen the

patient's own immune system.
Homeopathic physicians, however,
claim that these modern uses of the "law
of similars" represent only the tip of the
iceberg of this fundamental law's true po
tential.
'Like cures like'
Historically, the "law of similars" has
been known since the time of ancient
Greece. Hippocrates first described the
principle "like cures like."
Paracelsus, the great 15th century physi
cian and alchemist, applied it to botanical
medicine. Samuel Christian Hahnemann,
a German physician and renowned
chemist, developed the law into an empir
ical health science which he termed
homeopathy in the early 19th century.
An American physician, lames Tyler
Kent, in the late 1800s, systematized the
homeopathic methodology. Today, the
main exponent of the classical
homeopathic tradition is George Vithoul
kas.
Vithoulkas, an internationally known
and respected master practitioner of
homeopathy, directs the training of 22
physicians in his Athens clinic. He is being
specially flown to the Bay Area to give in
troductory public talks and a five-session
lecture series on "The Science of Classical
Homeopathy."
Public lectures
Dr. William Gray, a Stanford Medical
School graduate and Mill Valley physician,
is one of the physicians studying with Vit
houlkas and will be speaking with him at
the public lectures.
The public talks are scheduled for this
Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at Fairchild Au
ditorium at the Medical School, and this
Friday at 7:30 p.m. at Marina Jr. High
School (at Fillmore and Bay Streets in San
Francisco).
The lectures are free and open to the

public, although a $5 donation is re
quested for the Marina talk.
The five-session lecture series will be
held at the California Academy of Sciences
April 29 to May 1. CME Category I credit is
available for physicians, and Continuing
Education credit is available for nurses.
The cost is $55 for the lecture series.
Few doctors
Although there are relatively few
homeopathic doctors in the United States
today, the first national medical society in
the country was the American Institute of
Homeopathy, established in 1844.
By 1900, there were 22 homeopathic
medical colleges, 11 homeopathic hospi
tals (including what is now Marshal Hale
Hospital in San Francisco), and over 1000
druggists who sold homeopathic re
medies.
At present, homeopathy is widely prac
ticed in other parts of the world, including
Great Britain, France, Germany, India,
Argentina, Mexico and the Soviet Union.
Desirable aspects
Perhaps one of the most desirable as
pects of homeopathic practice is the high
degree of human interaction that must
transpire between doctor and patient so
that the "essence" of the individual may
help determine the appropriate
homeopathic remedy.
Today, Western culture, particularly in
the coastal United States, is experiencing
the rapid growth of its public health con
sciousness, and in the wake of rising costs
and the questionable success of orthodox
medicine with most chronic disease, many
people are turning toward the more hope
ful holistic alternatives.
It is conceivable that within the next de
cade, the public's view of the highest
standard of health practice may need to
encompass an understanding and ap
preciation of the holistic approach to
medicine.

thodox medicine, but also the emotional,
mental and more subtle or spiritual ele
ments of humanity.
Remedy
A specific remedy is chosen according
to the "law of similars." This means that a
substance found to create a specific set of
symptoms in a healthy person can cure
similar symptoms in a sick person.
The homeopathic remedies work by
providing a gentle but powerful stimulus
to the sick person's inherent natural de
fense system which helps the person to
heal.
Modern applications of the "law of simi
lars" may be found inorthodox medicine's
immunization and allergy therapies. These
therapeutic modalities involve administer
ing a small dose of something that may
cause a disease in order to strengthen the

patient's own immune system.
Homeopathic physicians, however,
claim that these modern uses of the "law
of similars" represent only the tip of the
iceberg of this fundamental law's true po
tential.
'Like cures like'
Historically, the "law of similars" has
been known since the time of ancient
Greece. Hippocrates first described the
principle "like cures like."
Paracelsus, the great 15th century physi
cian and alchemist, applied it to botanical
medicine. Samuel Christian Hahnemann,
a German physician and renowned
chemist, developed the law into an empir
ical health science which he termed
homeopathy in the early 19th century.
An American physician, lames Tyler
Kent, in the late 1800s, systematized the
homeopathic methodology. Today, the
main exponent of the classical
homeopathic tradition is George Vithoul
kas.
Vithoulkas, an internationally known
and respected master practitioner of
homeopathy, directs the training of 22
physicians in his Athens clinic. He is being
specially flown to the Bay Area to give in
troductory public talks and a five-session
lecture series on "The Science of Classical
Homeopathy."
Public lectures
Dr. William Gray, a Stanford Medical
School graduate and Mill Valley physician,
is one of the physicians studying with Vit
houlkas and will be speaking with him at
the public lectures.
The public talks are scheduled for this
Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at Fairchild Au
ditorium at the Medical School, and this
Friday at 7:30 p.m. at Marina Jr. High
School (at Fillmore and Bay Streets in San
Francisco).
The lectures are free and open to the

public, although a $5 donation is re
quested for the Marina talk.
The five-session lecture series will be
held at the California Academy of Sciences
April 29 to May 1. CME Category I credit is
available for physicians, and Continuing
Education credit is available for nurses.
The cost is $55 for the lecture series.
Few doctors
Although there are relatively few
homeopathic doctors in the United States
today, the first national medical society in
the country was the American Institute of
Homeopathy, established in 1844.
By 1900, there were 22 homeopathic
medical colleges, 11 homeopathic hospi
tals (including what is now Marshal Hale
Hospital in San Francisco), and over 1000
druggists who sold homeopathic re
medies.
At present, homeopathy is widely prac
ticed in other parts of the world, including
Great Britain, France, Germany, India,
Argentina, Mexico and the Soviet Union.
Desirable aspects
Perhaps one of the most desirable as
pects of homeopathic practice is the high
degree of human interaction that must
transpire between doctor and patient so
that the "essence" of the individual may
help determine the appropriate
homeopathic remedy.
Today, Western culture, particularly in
the coastal United States, is experiencing
the rapid growth of its public health con
sciousness, and in the wake of rising costs
and the questionable success of orthodox
medicine with most chronic disease, many
people are turning toward the more hope
ful holistic alternatives.
It is conceivable that within the next de
cade, the public's view of the highest
standard of health practice may need to
encompass an understanding and ap
preciation of the holistic approach to
medicine.

Although most people in the United
States today do not know what
homeopathy is, at the turn of the century
one of every five physicians in most urban
areas in this country were homeopaths.
The word "homeopathy" is derived
from the Creek "homeos" meaning simi
lar and "pathos" meaning suffering.
Homeopathy is a highly systematic, effec
tive and controversial health practice
based upon reproducible natural laws of
healing that treats individuals, not dis
eases, by administering specially
prepared minute doses of plant, mineral
or animal substances.
Homeopathy is considered by many
holistic health practitioners to be one of
the most holistic approaches to medicine.
The term "holistic" implies an approach to
the attainment and maintainance of
health.
It takes into account all aspects of
human existence — not only the physical
level which is the primary concern of or
thodox medicine, but also the emotional,
mental and more subtle or spiritual ele
ments of humanity.
