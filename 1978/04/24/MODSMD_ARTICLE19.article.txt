The staff of the Counseling
and Psychological Services
(CAPS) wants students to know
about its free counseling
facilities, but said they felt no
one should be forced to seek
their help.
Despite this low-pressure
approach, 1000 students, or
roughly 8 per cent of the total
student body, visit the counsel
ing center each year. This
number includes 6 per cent of
the male students and 14 per
cent of the female students.
What moves these students
to seek psychological counsel
ing? According to Dr. David
Dorosin, director of the coun
seling and psychological ser
vices, most students who visit
need help dealing with "predi
caments, not psychological
conditions."
University environment
Although students' troubles
do not necessarily stem from
academics, Dorosin said their
problems may be intensified
by the University environment.
Students must undergo a
"psychological emancipation"
from the family, while at the
same time face the challenge to
succeed, Dorosin said.
The staff often deals with
three common problems. The
first is personal decision
making, usually involving a re
lationship with another per
son. The second is concern
about a troubling symptom,

such as anxiety or depression.
The last involves career
decision-making.
According to Dorosin, the
staff sees several suicidal cases
each year. These patients come
from a variety of backgrounds
and usually suffer from per
sonal rather than academic
problems.
Exit anxiety
Who uses the services the
most? The CAPS Annual Report
indicates that the staff sees
more juniors and seniors than
freshmen and sophomores.
Often these students face "exit
anxiety," that is, concern
about leaving Stanford and en
tering the working world.
More first year graduate stu
dents seek counseling than do
undergraduate freshmen. For
many, graduate school has
been the ultimate goal, and
Dorosin said many of the first
year students find it discon
certing to have finally "ar

rived,"
Dorosin said freshmen are
supplied with a more suppor
tive environment and learn to
tolerate their anxieties more
easily. The patients represent a
wide spread of races, ethnic
groups and nationalities.
The CAPS facilities are used
most heavily during the winter
quarter. The average patient
makes four visits to the Center.
Long-term cases (more than 10
to 12 visits) are usually referred
to the Medical Center.
Broad spectrum
CAPS contributes indirectly
to a broader spectrum of Uni
versity life as each year they
train approximately 200 stu
dents as peer counselors in a
listening skills course. The
course is most often taken by
RAs in dormitories or coun
selors in the CPRC, LAC and
the Bridge. Staff consultants
also work with different offices
of the administration.

Ram's Head gave "teaser" performances last week in Palo Alto to encourage local families to attend the
Saturday matinee of "The Music Man." Students here perform the "Marion the Librarian" dance. Good
seats are still available for the show.
