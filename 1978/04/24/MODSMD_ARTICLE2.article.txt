## 
### David Georgette 
Joe Ruetz, athletic director for
the past six years, announced Fri
day he will take an early retire
ment from the University in 1979.
The announcement came as a
surprise, but Ruetz said yester
day, "I've been thinking about it
for a year." He indicated that in
the last few months he had been
seriously considering stepping
down. "I feel this is the right deci
sion for me and my family," he
said.
Ruetz plans to remain in his pos
ition at least until Jan. 1,1979, but
no later than )une 1, 1979, de
pending on when a successor can
be named.
"You're constantly confronted
by so many things in trying to get
things done the way you think
they should be, you don't really
have decision-making power,"
Ruetz said.
"This job has tremendous pres
sures, and I'm getting up in years.
In looking ahead at the impact
that continuing in this job could
have on my family life and possi
bly my health, I felt this was the
best thing to do."
No alumni pressure
Ruetz, 61, said that his retire
ment has "no relation to alumni
pressure."
Despite having to deal with de
mands of many different groups
— intercollegiate sports, club
sports, the administration, stu
dents and alumni — Ruetz has
maintained a nationally promi
nent and financially sound athle

tic program at Stanford.
Under Ruetz' guidance, the
men's and women's athletic prog
rams were merged in 1975, mak
ing Stanford one of the first uni
versities in the country to do so.
After the merger, Ruetz attracted
a number of top coaches to Stan
ford to strengthen the women's

athletic program, including tennis
coach Anne Could and field hoc
key coach Barb Longstreth.
"I feel I am leaving the depart
ment in very good shape," Ruetz
said. "I havethe program about 80
per cent of the way to where I
want it to be, and I guess you're

the quality of people I've brought
to Stanford athletics."
President Richard Lyman said,
"We are all indebted to Joe Ruetz
for his unserving devotion to the
pursuit of excellenceon the athle
tic field and in the classroom."
In his six years, Ruetz appointed
14 new head coaches, including
football coach Bill Walsh, the 1977
Pacific-8 Coach of the Year. The
University has also won four
NCAA team championships and

M
23 individual titles during Ruetz'
tenure. These include two team
and 11 individual titles during the
1976-77 year.
Ruetz first came to .Stanford as
assistant football coach in 1951.
He worked in the general secret
ary's office as a fundraiser for 15
years.
Ruetz said he hopes to continue
to serve the University in a volun
tary role, perhaps in fundraising.
Lyman is expected to appoint a
committee comprised of faculty,
alumni, athletes and students that
will conduct a nationwide search
for a successor.

sion for me and my family," he
said.
Ruetz plans to remain in his pos
ition at least until Jan. 1,1979, but
no later than )une 1, 1979, de
pending on when a successor can
be named.
"You're constantly confronted
by so many things in trying to get
things done the way you think
they should be, you don't really
have decision-making power,"
Ruetz said.
"This job has tremendous pres
sures, and I'm getting up in years.
In looking ahead at the impact
that continuing in this job could
have on my family life and possi
bly my health, I felt this was the
best thing to do."
No alumni pressure
Ruetz, 61, said that his retire
ment has "no relation to alumni
pressure."
Despite having to deal with de
mands of many different groups
— intercollegiate sports, club
sports, the administration, stu
dents and alumni — Ruetz has
maintained a nationally promi
nent and financially sound athle

tic program at Stanford.
Under Ruetz' guidance, the
men's and women's athletic prog
rams were merged in 1975, mak
ing Stanford one of the first uni
versities in the country to do so.
After the merger, Ruetz attracted
a number of top coaches to Stan
ford to strengthen the women's

athletic program, including tennis
coach Anne Could and field hoc
key coach Barb Longstreth.
"I feel I am leaving the depart
ment in very good shape," Ruetz
said. "I havethe program about 80
per cent of the way to where I
want it to be, and I guess you're

excellence of our program and
the quality of people I've brought
to Stanford athletics."

for his unserving devotion to the
pursuit of excellenceon the athle

University has also won four
NCAA team championships and

M

Ruetz first came to .Stanford as
assistant football coach in 1951.
He worked in the general secret
ary's office as a fundraiser for 15
years.
Ruetz said he hopes to continue
to serve the University in a volun

committee comprised of faculty,
alumni, athletes and students that
will conduct a nationwide search
for a successor.
