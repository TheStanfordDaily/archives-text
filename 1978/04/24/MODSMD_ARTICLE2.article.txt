Joe Ruetz, athletic director for
the past six years, announced Fri
day he will take an early retire
ment from the University in 1979.
The announcement came as a
surprise, but Ruetz said yester
day, "I've been thinking about it
for a year." He indicated that in
the last few months he had been
seriously considering stepping
down. "I feel this is the right deci

said.
Ruetz plans to remain in his pos

no later than )une 1, 1979, de

things done the way you think
they should be, you don't really
have decision-making power,"
Ruetz said.
"This job has tremendous pres

In looking ahead at the impact
that continuing in this job could
have on my family life and possi

best thing to do."
No alumni pressure
Ruetz, 61, said that his retire

After the merger, Ruetz attracted
a number of top coaches to Stan
ford to strengthen the women's

athletic program, including tennis
coach Anne Could and field hoc
key coach Barb Longstreth.
"I feel I am leaving the depart
ment in very good shape," Ruetz

want it to be, and I guess you're
