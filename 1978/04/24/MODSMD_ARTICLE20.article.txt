In a fabulous display of ten
nis Saturday, defending NCAA
champion Stanford won its
17th match of the season, and
its 29th straight over the past
two years, trouncing UCLA,
8-1.
The Cards clinched the
match early, winning all six
outdoor matches. Playing for
personal pride the Cards took
two of the three indoor
matches. The Bruins, ranked
No. 2 in the nation, are 18-2,
having lost twice to Stanford.
Stanford's Matt Mitchell and
UCLA's Tony Graham opened
Saturday's action with an excit
ing exhibition of the serve and
volley game. In a rematch of
last year's NCAA finals, Mitch
ell andGraham hitwinnerafter
winner. Mitchell managed a
service break each set and
fought off Graham's attempts
to break back and won a 6-4,
6-4 decision.
Perry Wright rebounded
from a frustrating weekend in
Los Angeles by whipping pre
viously undefeated Bruce
Nichols (18-1) 6-4, 6-7, 6-2.
Wright won the first set and
was leading 4-2 in the second.
But Nichols rallied to win the
set in a tiebreaker. Wright ral
lied to down Nichols in the
third set 6-2.
Peter Rennert rebounded
from his loss last Thursday and
took Fritz Buehning7-6, 6-4. At
4-all in the first set tiebreaker,
Rennert hit a backhand passing
shot so hard that it was by
Buehning before he could
even move. Using the first set
momentum Rennert cruised to
victory.
)ohn Rast did not play the

match of his life, but still came
out on the winning end of a 6-4,
1 -6,6-4 battle with Billy Bartlett.
Bartlett, originally UCLA's No.
9 man, was forced into action
with the injury of two Bruin
starters and one reserve.
In doubles action Wright and
Mitchell continued to thrash
opponents. Playing almost
flawlessly the Card netters won
the first seven games and never
looked back winning 6-0, 6-3.
With each match the pair
seems to be regaining the form
that made them the nation's
top collegiate doubles team
last year.
The undefeated team of
Lloyd Bourne and Peter Re
nnert led 6-4, 5-2 at one time,
but the Bruins evened the
match at a set apiece, fighting
off three match points in the
process. However, the Card
duo came back to win the
match 6-4, 6-7, 6-3.
In Maples
Indoors in the first match,
John Austin played what he cal
led the finest match of the year
for himself, beating Bill Maze
easily, 6-4, 6-2. Austin admitted
he was psyched for a hostile
Maples Pavilion crowd and
wanted to make his indoor
debut a success.
In the big match, the top two
collegians in the nation were
featured. With a capacity
crowd looking on, )ohn McEn
roe and Elliot Teltscher played
some of the finest tennis ever
witnessed on the Farm.
McEnroe started slow, losing
his serve the first two times.
Down 3-0 McEnroe started to
warm up and started a barrage
of winners to pull even at 3-all.
The two players stayed even to

5-all when McEnroe held serve
and then broke for the set 7-5.
In the second set both
players unleashed incredible
shots at will. But McEnroe
ended up on top, breaking
Teltscher in the final game fora
7-5, 6-3 win.
In the doubles, Austin and
Nichols, last year's NCAA
finalists, gave McEnroe and
Maze, this year's favorites, all
they could handle. The Bruins
captured the first set easily,
6-3, breaking the Cards in their
first service game. But McEn
roe and Maze came alive and
fought back to win the last two
sets by 6-2 scores.
"This was the best effort
we've had as a team this year,"
commented Card coach Dick
Gould. "When you beat the
No. 2-ranked team 8-1, it says a
lot for the character of the
team. We're still not fully heal
thy, Mac's got a bad ankle,
Bill's got a bad knee and there
are a few colds on the team.
"But all in all I'm pleased,
especially with the play of Matt
and Perry in both singles and
doubles. Of course UCLA was
hurt by the loss of No. 5 man
Robbie Venter in singles and
All-America |on Paley in dou
bles. We'll have to do even bet
ter to win the NCAAs."
