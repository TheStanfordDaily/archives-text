## Lose to Trojans, stop Bruins Cards rebound for a win 
### 
The No. 2-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team ran into
the No. 1-ranked USC Friday
and the result was what can be
expected when No. 1 meets
No. 2. USC (8-0) edged the
Cards (15-1), 5-4.
But yesterday when the
Cards hosted No. 3 UCLA,
Stanford showed its No. 2 spot
is deserved. Winning four of
the top five singles matches,
the Cards stormed to a 7-2 vic
tory and handed UCLA only its
second loss. The Trojans have
also defeated UCLA.
Friday afternoon USC won
four of the six matches played
outside. The Trojans clinched
the victory in Maples Pavilion
when Lea Antonopolis, the
second-ranking amateur in the
nation behind Tracy Austin,
stopped Barb Jordan, 6-3, 6-2.
"We had our chances in
some matches but we couldn't
capitalize on them," said Card
coach Anne Gould.
The Trojans, with four of the
top seven amateur players in
the nation, captured four of
the top six singles.
Third-ranking amateur Stacy
Margolin was the only one of
the four to lose as Cardinal

Kathy Jordan won their match
6-4, 6-1. But No. 6 Barbara Hal
quist and No. 7 Sheila Mclner
ney came up with victories.
Halquist downed Diane Morri
son in two sets and Mclnerney
defeated Susie Hagey, 6-3, 6-3.
Yesterday, though, all three
top Card singles players who
lost against the Trojans re
bounded to win their matches
while Kathy jordan was up
ended by the Bruins' lean
Duvall, 6-0, 6-1.
"Duvall was outstanding,"
said Gould. "She hit the heck
out of the ball. She played tre
mendously."
Yesterday in doubles the
Cards continued their fine per
formances from Friday when
the two top Stanford teams had
defeated the top Trojan pair
ings — their first losses of the
season. Hagey and Morrison,
who had defeated Halquist and
Mclnerney Friday in two sets,
did the same thing to Shannon
Gordon and Becky Bell yester
day, taking the match 6-2, 6-1.
The lordan sisters, 6-4, 6-3
winners over Antonopolis and
Susan Brown Friday, overcame
Renee Blount and Kathy Snel
son 6-3 3-6, 7-5. The Cards

completed the sweep in dou
bles against the Bruins when
Donna Rubin and Caryn Hertel
defeated Liz Stadler and Dana
Gilbert, 6-0, 6-3.
"It certainly is encouraging
to know that the doubles can
come through," said Gould.
"I'm really pleased with the
way the third team has come
along."
Tomorrow the Cards host
San lose State at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium at 3 p.m.

Though this Cal baserunner was out at the plate, 10 others did cross
home safely during Friday's game. Saturday 22 more did as the Bears
toppled the Cards 14-6 in the first game before the second game was
suspended because of darkness.
