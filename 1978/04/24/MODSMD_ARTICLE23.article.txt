# Cards' pitching falters against Bears
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
"Tough weekend," mum
bled Stanford first baseman
Tom Cuardino as he headed
toward the locker room. The
bus ride back from Berkeley
had been less than enjoyable
as the Cardinals returned vir
tually empty-handed from the
series with Cal.
The Bears embarrassed Stan
ford twice: 10-8 in Sunken
Diamond Friday afternoon and
14-6 in the first game at Evans
Field on Saturday. In the final
game of the series, Cal left
Stanford unfulfilled, calling the
game on account of darkness
after 10 innings with the score
tied 8-8.
The Cardinals will get a
chance to offset the two losses
later this spring when they pick
up the final tied ballgame
where they left off. Stanford
will finish that game on May 12
before it begins its season
concluding series with Cal.
Meanwhile, Stanford's
Pacific-8 record fell to 3-5 —
percentage points behind Cal's
3-4 record.
The burden of the two costly
losses this weekend fell on the
Cardinal pitching staff. All
three of the Stanford starters
were chased from the mound
in less than three innings. The
10-1, 8-0 and 8-0 leads given to
the Bears before the games
were half over proved too
much for even the Cards'
well-developed "battle-back"
style.
In both Friday's game and
the second game Saturday,

fine relief performances held
the Bears while the Cardinals
played catch-up. )oe LoPresti,
who came into Friday's game
for the seventh, eighth and
ninth innings, relieved Brian
Harrison after only 1-1/3 in
nings of the final game Satur
day.
LoPresti went on to throw
136 pitches in his 8-2/3 inning
appearance despite his slightly
sore arm from Friday. The
lefthanded junior allowed only
four hits for two runs while
walking seven batters and strik
ing out three.
"The way I felt those first few
innings," said LoPresti, "I was
surprised that I lasted more
than three. I wasn't thinking
win," he continued. "When
you come into a game in a situ
ation like that, you're just in
there trying to keep them from
scoring any more."
The factor that worked
against the Cards in this
weekend's series was the
base-on-balls. Stanford pitch
ers walked Cal batters 24 times
in the two games Saturday.
"The walks are the most frus
trating things," said LoPresti.
"When you walk batters you're
giving the game away. It's bet
ter to be hit hard than to give
up walks because at least then
there's the chance they'll be hit
at somebody."
But LoPresti threw strikes in
his long relief job. His slider
was working well throughout
the stint and mixing things up
with fastballs and a few curves
and change-ups, he was able to

keep the Bears off balance.
The pitching wasn't the only
weakness in the Cardinal game
this weekend. Stanford's of
fense also lacked something.
Several of the Card starters
who have been instrumental in
recent victories went hitless in
one or more of the games.
Tom Cuardino was the

brightest spot in the Cardinal
line-up. Friday, Guardino went
three-for-five, including a
homerun to left over the soc
cer field fence.
In the second game Satur
day, Guardino unloaded twice
— for homeruns No. 11 and 12
— in back-to-back innings to
account for four of Stanford's

eight runs. In both the sixth
and seventh innings Guardino
came to bat in the clean-up
position with teammate Larry
Reynolds on first.
Guardino, now with 12
homeruns, needs only two
more to break the season re
cord of 13 set by Bruce Robin
son in 1975.

Bears' 10-8 win over Stanford Friday at Sunken Diamond.
