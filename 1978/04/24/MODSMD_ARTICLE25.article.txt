Booters divide
In soccer action over the
weekend, Stanford's women
split their four games. The sec
ond team lost to UC-Davis 2-1
on Saturday, and was shut out
2-0 against Chico State yester
day. Its record is 1-3-1.
The Cardinals' first team beat
Humboldt State 6-1 Saturday
on goals by Kris McCarrey, Sue
Handel, Cindy Shorney, Con
nie Keeran and two by Ellen
Griep.
Against Chico yesterday,
Stanford I scored with 10 mi
nutes remaining to break a 0-0
deadlock. The Cards (7-1-1)
have a rematch with Santa
Clara Wednesday at 3:30 p.m.
on Roble Field.
Cyclists take third
Stanford's contingent of cyc
lists placed third in the final to
tals of the weekend's Western
Regional Intercollegiate Cycl
ing Championships behind
Berkeley and Claremont Col
lege.
Yesterday's top riders for the
Cardinals were Kelly Fosterand
Bob Simons in B team competi
tion and Randy Strossen and
)ohn Toor on the A team.
Strossen came up with the
second highest point total of
the day, and Toor lost by in
ches to Cal's Mark Cahn for the
overall meet title.
Simons placed fourth in the
individual time trial held
Saturday afternoon, his first in
tercollegiate meet.
"I'd say we did as well as we
could have done considering
that in the final event, the A
team criterium, we had two
strong riders compared to
Claremont and Berkeley, who
both had four or five each. Our
riders were as strong as any of
their's, except they just out
numbered us," Toor said.
"Randy Strossen rode ex
tremely well. I think we had a
surprisingly good performance
from Kelly Foster," Toor ad

ded.
The next meet for Stanford's
cyclists will be in Dominguez
Hills in two weeks.
