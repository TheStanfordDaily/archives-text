The junior varsity baseball
team takes its second place 8-3
record to San Jose State today
fora conference doubleheader
with the Spartan JVs. Stanford
split a two-game set with San
Jose State when they met in
March for the first time this
season.
The Stanford JVs have taken
their last three league games,
beating the Cal JVs 12-4 and
10-2 and last weekend downing
the St. Mary's JVs 6-4. In one of

the games with St. Mary's,
freshman righthander George
Lopez turned in a no-hitter
through 6-2/3 innings.
In an attempt to set down the
last batter of the seventh and
final inning of the contest, the
Gaels' batter spoiled his no
hitter with a single. Neverthe
less, Lopez has allowed only
three earned runs in his 34 in
nings pitched.
Lopez will be scheduled for
relief duties today behind two
freshman teammates, Tim

Sherrell and Bob Boatman,
who will start for the Cards.
Sherrell and Boatman have
each pitched about 12 innings
this year and have done well.
Today's doubleheader will
be crucial for the JVs, accord
ing to coach Bruce Davis.
"We're coming down to our
last nine games," said Davis.
"As far as we know we're in
second place right now so it's
important for us to win every
game from here on out."
As a team the JVs have a bat
ting average close to .350. Brad

Palfrey, the 6-foot 180 lb.
freshman from Arcadia, still
leads the team with a .550 bat
ting average.
Third baseman Scott Peder
son has also been tearing the
cover off the ball. Pederson
went six-for-eight in the recent
doubleheader with Cal, col
lecting a single, two doubles,
two triples and one homerun.
Outfielder Mike Zboralske and
second baseman Don Ericson
have also been key offensive
figures.
