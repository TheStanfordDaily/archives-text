# Provost Miller, professors return from China
## Find education system less political, more disciplined 
### Michelle Vaughen 
The People's Republic of China is reorient
ing its entire educational system toward a
more disciplined approach to higher educa
tion, Provost William Miller said after his
recent visit there.
Miller led a 21-member delegation of Stan
ford faculty and graduate students in en
gineering, agricultural economics and
Chinese studies on a 17-day tour of Chinese
academic institutions.
Basic changes in China's educational pol
icy include the reinstatement of university
entrance exams, grades and accreditation,
Miller said. These changes, as well as others
in industry, agriculture, and science and
technology, have occurred since the fall of
the "Gang of Four" late in 1976, he said.
Prior to the loss of power of the late Mao

Tse-tung's wife and three radicals, the main
emphasis in education was of a highly politi
cal nature, Miller said.
"Beginning with the Cultural Revolution
in 1969, political awareness and experience
was put above all else, including scholar
ship, personal interests, and family ties," he
said.
Before entering a university, a high school
graduate was required to spend two years in
the countryside working in a factory or farm,
Miller said. The graduate submitted state
ments of political reliability from colleagues
at work, instead of taking an entrance exam.
Once admitted to the university, the stu
dent was required to spend a large percen
tage of his time on political activities, Miller
said. "Competent faculty were discouraged
because they had to spend time on political

activities, rather than on scholarly research
and teaching," he said.
The new regime attributes the current lack
of academically qualified students to the
"Gang of Four's" former political policies.
They are interested in rebuilding an educa
tional elite cadre, Miller said.
Noting that politics still comprise a sub
stantial part of China's educational process
from kindergarten on, Miller said "the
amount of time devoted to it seems to be
less."
"More emphasis is now being placed on
teaching the basic subjects — arithmetic,
language, literature, physics, chemistry," he
said. "Faculty are back in control of univer
sity intellectual life."
A new national university entrance exam
was written last fall, and all admissions were

temporarily stopped, Miller said. Incoming
students, who began taking the exam last
month, are now being allowed to enter the
university directly from high school, he said.
A four-year national program has been
developed for undergraduates, and a
three-year graduate program is currently
being designed, Miller said.
"For all practical purposes, there used to
be no graduate studies," Miller said. "After
getting your bachelor's degree, you might
work for a research institute as an assistant,
getting on-the-job training. But few formal
advanced degrees were awarded."
In the past, students attended universities
without charge. Now, students' families
who can afford to must pay living expenses,
he said.

Miller said changes have occurred in the
popular dress and the performing and picto
rial arts since his first visit in October 1976.
The dress is now more colorful and indi
vidualistic, he said. Classical themes in the
arts, which were previously forbidden, have
also emerged.
The purpose of the trip was to develop
contacts with colleagues in science and
technology and to foster future academic
exchanges, Miller said. "There's no ques
tion that Chinese faculty and researchers are
enthusiastic about further exchanges."
Four Chinese delegations in chemistry,
foreign affairs, higher education and electri
cal engineering have visited the University in
the past year. About 50 members of the Uni
versity faculty and administration have vis
ited China.

contacts with colleagues in science and
technology and to foster future academic
exchanges, Miller said. "There's no ques
tion that Chinese faculty and researchers are
enthusiastic about further exchanges."
Four Chinese delegations in chemistry,
foreign affairs, higher education and electri
cal engineering have visited the University in
the past year. About 50 members of the Uni
versity faculty and administration have vis
ited China.
The People's Republic of China is reorient
ing its entire educational system toward a
more disciplined approach to higher educa
tion, Provost William Miller said after his
recent visit there.
Miller led a 21-member delegation of Stan
ford faculty and graduate students in en
gineering, agricultural economics and
Chinese studies on a 17-day tour of Chinese
academic institutions.
Basic changes in China's educational pol
icy include the reinstatement of university
entrance exams, grades and accreditation,
Miller said. These changes, as well as others
in industry, agriculture, and science and
technology, have occurred since the fall of
the "Gang of Four" late in 1976, he said.
Prior to the loss of power of the late Mao

Tse-tung's wife and three radicals, the main
emphasis in education was of a highly politi
cal nature, Miller said.
"Beginning with the Cultural Revolution
in 1969, political awareness and experience
was put above all else, including scholar
ship, personal interests, and family ties," he
said.
Before entering a university, a high school
graduate was required to spend two years in
the countryside working in a factory or farm,
Miller said. The graduate submitted state
ments of political reliability from colleagues
at work, instead of taking an entrance exam.
Once admitted to the university, the stu
dent was required to spend a large percen
tage of his time on political activities, Miller
said. "Competent faculty were discouraged
because they had to spend time on political

activities, rather than on scholarly research
and teaching," he said.
The new regime attributes the current lack
of academically qualified students to the
"Gang of Four's" former political policies.
They are interested in rebuilding an educa
tional elite cadre, Miller said.
Noting that politics still comprise a sub
stantial part of China's educational process
from kindergarten on, Miller said "the
amount of time devoted to it seems to be
less."
"More emphasis is now being placed on
teaching the basic subjects — arithmetic,
language, literature, physics, chemistry," he
said. "Faculty are back in control of univer
sity intellectual life."
A new national university entrance exam
was written last fall, and all admissions were

temporarily stopped, Miller said. Incoming
students, who began taking the exam last
month, are now being allowed to enter the
university directly from high school, he said.
A four-year national program has been
developed for undergraduates, and a
three-year graduate program is currently
being designed, Miller said.
"For all practical purposes, there used to
be no graduate studies," Miller said. "After
getting your bachelor's degree, you might
work for a research institute as an assistant,
getting on-the-job training. But few formal
advanced degrees were awarded."
In the past, students attended universities
without charge. Now, students' families
who can afford to must pay living expenses,
he said.

Miller said changes have occurred in the
popular dress and the performing and picto
rial arts since his first visit in October 1976.
The dress is now more colorful and indi
vidualistic, he said. Classical themes in the
arts, which were previously forbidden, have
also emerged.
The purpose of the trip was to develop
contacts with colleagues in science and
technology and to foster future academic
exchanges, Miller said. "There's no ques
tion that Chinese faculty and researchers are
