# Carmichael calls for overthrow of capitalism

### Kevin Cox 
Whether the movement is moti
vated by the new All African Peoples
Revolutionary Party (AAPRP) or Black
Power, black activist Stokely Car
michael believes that a concerted ef
fort by the people will overthrow
capitalism.
"If one man could free the people,
I'd have done it a long time ago," the
originator of the term "Black Power"
told 150 people last night in Cubber
ley Auditorium. Carmichael's speech
was the final event in the Stanford
Organizing Committee (SOC) Dis
orientation Week.
Calling for the support of the
AAPRP, Carmichael said that "only
the people properly organized can
free the people.
"If you're not fighting to liberate
your people, you're fighting against
your people . . . you have a respon
sibility to the blood of your people."
Carmichael attacked the "vicious,
stupid, backwards, barbaric and
reactionary" system of capitalism
because the capitalists, instead of
using their knowledge and technol
ogy to "alleviate the suffering of
mankind, advance themselves." He
said capitalists are able to do this be
cause they use a variety of
techniques to "confuse, contami
nate and mystify" the people.
Students must be particularly
wary, according to Carmichael, be
cause they are being indoctrinated
with capitalist values in their classes.
He cited competition for As here as
proof of this indoctrination.
Saying that 'A' students wish "the
students who got Cs would have
flunked," Carmichael said this was
proof that students had become in
doctrinated.
"You are not aware of the capitalist
system's contamination, and you will
not even be aware of it,"he said.
"Others (the students who did flunk)

needed you and you didn't even un
derstand it."
Religion, history and even radio
stations are instruments of
capitalism, Carmichael said. Stres
sing that he is neither for nor against
Christianity, Carmichael charged
that it is used to "confuse" people by
causing them to believe in a savior
and lulls them into inactivity.
According to Carmichael, if he was
"fighting the enemy, gun in hand"
with Jesus and was "cornered, )esus
will walk across the water. What will I
do?"

History, because it is "always made
by a great white man or woman," is
especially confusing, Carmichael
said. In this way, Africansare without
a heritage and are made to "feel in
ferior to everyone everywhere."
Finally, the "beep, beep, beep that
keeps you (students) jumpin'all day"
on the radio is really a capitalist plot
to keep people uninformed by em
phasizing music instead of the news,
he said.
Turning to Pan Africanism, a
movement to make blacks more
aware of the heritage of their home
land, Carmichael accused black
studies programs of not emphasizing
the movement. "There they confuse
us more than anywhere else," he
said.

by a great white man or woman," is
especially confusing, Carmichael
said. In this way, Africansare without
a heritage and are made to "feel in
ferior to everyone everywhere."
Finally, the "beep, beep, beep that
keeps you (students) jumpin'all day"
on the radio is really a capitalist plot
to keep people uninformed by em
phasizing music instead of the news,
he said.
Turning to Pan Africanism, a
movement to make blacks more
aware of the heritage of their home
land, Carmichael accused black
studies programs of not emphasizing
the movement. "There they confuse
us more than anywhere else," he
said.
