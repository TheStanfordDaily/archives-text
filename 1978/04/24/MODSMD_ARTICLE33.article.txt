Korean pilot not given warning
Anchorage, Alaska — The co-pilot of a South
Korean jetliner downed in north-west Russia said
yesterday the crew received no warning from a
Soviet MiC interceptor before it opened fire —
blasting a hole in the fuselage, killing two persons
and wounding 10.
The co-pilot, Cha Soori-do, said "They (the Rus
sians) say they warned us," butthefiringcameasa
surprise. "I was on the international emergency
frequency but I did not hear anything ... we
didn't contact at all," he said.
Soviet authorities said they tried to contact the
jetliner, which crash-landed on a frozen lake after
the MiG's burst of fire.
Cha said he first noticed the fighter when it flew
alongside "for about two minutes ... no indica
tion of its intent. After then about five minutes we
were shot."
Moro's party softens stand
Rome — Italy's Christian Democratic Party yes
terday seemed to soften its no-deal stand with the
Red Brigade kidnappers of party president Aldo
Moro. But intermediaries reported no contact
with the terrorist abductors more than 24 hours
after a death deadline for Moro passed.
For the second day, hundreds of Italians
gathered in vigils outside Moro's Rome apartment
and in front of the Christian Democrats'
downtown headquarters, where leaders of the rul
ing party were meeting.
Party Secretary-General Benigno Zaccagnini
said afterward that Christian Democrats want to
find out through intermediaries "a reply to ques
tions on the fate of Aldo Moro and to ascertain . . .
possible ways to achieve his liberation."
Arms limit talks show progress
London — U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
ended his Moscow arms control negotiations yes
terday claiming "some progress" on a weapons
treaty and in U.S.-Soviet relations, but providing
no details.
He then flew here for talks with Western foreign
ministers on promoting black rule in the South
African-held territory of South-West Africa, also
called Namibia.
American officials with Vance hinted that the
Soviets had eased their opposition to U.S. sharing
of "cruise" missile technology with the NATO al
lies.
But the Soviets were said to have remained
adamant on deployment of their Backfire bomber.
Most analysts say that unless there are limitations
on the Backfire's production and deployment, an
arms agreement treaty might not clear the Senate.
A third unresolved issue involves U.S. efforts to
block new Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile
systems.
Carter may accept lower tax cut
Washington — The chairman of the House tax
writing committee said yesterday he believes Pres
ident jimmy Carter will accept a $15 billion income
tax cut instead of the administration's proposed
$24 billion reduction.
"I think he's ready to accept the will of this
committee in the House," said Rep. Al Ullman,

chairman of the House Ways and Means Commit
tee.
Last week the White House denied published
reports saying that Carter was prepared to com
promise on his tax cut. The denial came after
Ullman and other members of the committee met
with Carter. After the meeting, the lawmakers said
they detected a willingness on the president's part
to compromise.
Ullman (D-Ore.) wants to limit the tax cut to $15
billion in order to keep the nation's budget deficit
as low as possible.
Carter's reform team shuffled
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's cam
paign to reorganize the federal government is fal
ling behind schedule and will undergo a top-level
shake-out this week, administration officials say.
No personnel shifts are anticipated, but some
reorganization projects are likely to be shelved
and the whole effort will get a more business
oriented focus, the officials said.
Reasons offered for the delays include poor or
ganization, sluggish action by Congress, opposi
tion by Cabinet officials to losing any of their au
thority, and a tendency to distrust and repeat pre
vious reorganization studies.
it was also apparent from the interviews that
staff morale is beginning to suffer, although it re
ceived a boost last week from Carter's efforts to
end infighting in his Cabinet and his personal lob
bying for civil service revision, considered the
crown jewel of the reorganization project.
Italian masterpieces recovered
Florence, Italy — A barroom boast of a "big
theft" gave police the break they needed to re
cover a Rubens masterpiece and nine other paint
ings stolen in one of Italy's most daring art heists,
authorities said yesterday. Three suspects were
arrested.
Peter Paul Rubens' "The Three Graces" and the
other works, also Flemish, were found undam
aged early yesterday and returned to Florence's
famed Pitti Palace museum just two days after they
were stolen, police reported. Their value has been
estimated at more than $1 million.
Police said they arrested Franco Mefiti, 29, and
Giovanni Manfredi, 31, the alleged thieves, and
attorney Franco Brogi, 37, who was accused of
masterminding the operation. The three were
jailed on charges of theft and conspiracy, police
said.
Soviets close nuclear area gap
New York — The Soviet Union, which has long
outstripped NATO in conventional forces in
Europe, has "closed the gap" in the strategic nuc
lear area as well, Gen. Alexander Haig Jr., supreme
commander of NATO forces, said yesterday.
Haig was asked whether Soviet nuclear forces
are now equal or superior to those of the Western
alliance.
"I think the best response would be that our
deterrent is still viable, but that if these trends are
not reversed that in the very near future, we would
be without that deterrent," Haig said.
He said the Soviets have "closed the gap ... in
both the central strategic nuclear area and the

theater nuclear area."
He called that trend "worrisome" and said that
"remedial action" is necessary.
Haig, a supporter of deploying the neutron
bomb in Europe, said he recognized the political
factors involved in President jimmy Carter's deci
sion to postpone it.

Italian masterpieces recovered
Florence, Italy — A barroom boast of a "big
theft" gave police the break they needed to re
cover a Rubens masterpiece and nine other paint
ings stolen in one of Italy's most daring art heists,
authorities said yesterday. Three suspects were
arrested.
Peter Paul Rubens' "The Three Graces" and the
other works, also Flemish, were found undam
aged early yesterday and returned to Florence's
famed Pitti Palace museum just two days after they
were stolen, police reported. Their value has been
estimated at more than $1 million.
Police said they arrested Franco Mefiti, 29, and
Giovanni Manfredi, 31, the alleged thieves, and
attorney Franco Brogi, 37, who was accused of
masterminding the operation. The three were
jailed on charges of theft and conspiracy, police
said.
Soviets close nuclear area gap
New York — The Soviet Union, which has long
outstripped NATO in conventional forces in
Europe, has "closed the gap" in the strategic nuc
lear area as well, Gen. Alexander Haig Jr., supreme
commander of NATO forces, said yesterday.
Haig was asked whether Soviet nuclear forces
are now equal or superior to those of the Western
alliance.
"I think the best response would be that our
deterrent is still viable, but that if these trends are
not reversed that in the very near future, we would
be without that deterrent," Haig said.
He said the Soviets have "closed the gap ... in
both the central strategic nuclear area and the

theater nuclear area."
He called that trend "worrisome" and said that
"remedial action" is necessary.
Haig, a supporter of deploying the neutron
bomb in Europe, said he recognized the political
factors involved in President jimmy Carter's deci
sion to postpone it.

Korean pilot not given warning
Anchorage, Alaska — The co-pilot of a South
Korean jetliner downed in north-west Russia said
yesterday the crew received no warning from a
Soviet MiC interceptor before it opened fire —
blasting a hole in the fuselage, killing two persons
and wounding 10.
The co-pilot, Cha Soori-do, said "They (the Rus
sians) say they warned us," butthefiringcameasa
surprise. "I was on the international emergency
frequency but I did not hear anything ... we
didn't contact at all," he said.
Soviet authorities said they tried to contact the
jetliner, which crash-landed on a frozen lake after
the MiG's burst of fire.
Cha said he first noticed the fighter when it flew
alongside "for about two minutes ... no indica
tion of its intent. After then about five minutes we
were shot."
Moro's party softens stand
Rome — Italy's Christian Democratic Party yes
terday seemed to soften its no-deal stand with the
Red Brigade kidnappers of party president Aldo
Moro. But intermediaries reported no contact
with the terrorist abductors more than 24 hours
after a death deadline for Moro passed.
For the second day, hundreds of Italians
gathered in vigils outside Moro's Rome apartment
and in front of the Christian Democrats'
downtown headquarters, where leaders of the rul
ing party were meeting.
Party Secretary-General Benigno Zaccagnini
said afterward that Christian Democrats want to
find out through intermediaries "a reply to ques
tions on the fate of Aldo Moro and to ascertain . . .
possible ways to achieve his liberation."
Arms limit talks show progress
London — U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
ended his Moscow arms control negotiations yes
terday claiming "some progress" on a weapons
treaty and in U.S.-Soviet relations, but providing
no details.
He then flew here for talks with Western foreign
ministers on promoting black rule in the South
African-held territory of South-West Africa, also
called Namibia.
American officials with Vance hinted that the
Soviets had eased their opposition to U.S. sharing
of "cruise" missile technology with the NATO al
lies.
But the Soviets were said to have remained
adamant on deployment of their Backfire bomber.
Most analysts say that unless there are limitations
on the Backfire's production and deployment, an
arms agreement treaty might not clear the Senate.
A third unresolved issue involves U.S. efforts to
block new Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile
systems.
Carter may accept lower tax cut
Washington — The chairman of the House tax
writing committee said yesterday he believes Pres
ident jimmy Carter will accept a $15 billion income
tax cut instead of the administration's proposed
$24 billion reduction.
"I think he's ready to accept the will of this
committee in the House," said Rep. Al Ullman,

chairman of the House Ways and Means Commit
tee.
Last week the White House denied published
reports saying that Carter was prepared to com
promise on his tax cut. The denial came after
Ullman and other members of the committee met
with Carter. After the meeting, the lawmakers said
they detected a willingness on the president's part
to compromise.
Ullman (D-Ore.) wants to limit the tax cut to $15
billion in order to keep the nation's budget deficit
as low as possible.
Carter's reform team shuffled
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's cam
paign to reorganize the federal government is fal
ling behind schedule and will undergo a top-level
shake-out this week, administration officials say.
No personnel shifts are anticipated, but some
reorganization projects are likely to be shelved
and the whole effort will get a more business
oriented focus, the officials said.
Reasons offered for the delays include poor or
ganization, sluggish action by Congress, opposi
tion by Cabinet officials to losing any of their au
thority, and a tendency to distrust and repeat pre
vious reorganization studies.
it was also apparent from the interviews that
staff morale is beginning to suffer, although it re

were shot."
Moro's party softens stand
Rome — Italy's Christian Democratic Party yes
terday seemed to soften its no-deal stand with the
Red Brigade kidnappers of party president Aldo
Moro. But intermediaries reported no contact
with the terrorist abductors more than 24 hours
after a death deadline for Moro passed.
For the second day, hundreds of Italians
gathered in vigils outside Moro's Rome apartment
and in front of the Christian Democrats'
downtown headquarters, where leaders of the rul
ing party were meeting.
Party Secretary-General Benigno Zaccagnini
said afterward that Christian Democrats want to
find out through intermediaries "a reply to ques
tions on the fate of Aldo Moro and to ascertain . . .
possible ways to achieve his liberation."
Arms limit talks show progress
London — U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
ended his Moscow arms control negotiations yes
terday claiming "some progress" on a weapons
treaty and in U.S.-Soviet relations, but providing
no details.
He then flew here for talks with Western foreign
ministers on promoting black rule in the South
African-held territory of South-West Africa, also
called Namibia.
American officials with Vance hinted that the
Soviets had eased their opposition to U.S. sharing
of "cruise" missile technology with the NATO al
lies.
But the Soviets were said to have remained
adamant on deployment of their Backfire bomber.
Most analysts say that unless there are limitations
on the Backfire's production and deployment, an
arms agreement treaty might not clear the Senate.
A third unresolved issue involves U.S. efforts to
block new Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile
systems.
Carter may accept lower tax cut
Washington — The chairman of the House tax
writing committee said yesterday he believes Pres
ident jimmy Carter will accept a $15 billion income
tax cut instead of the administration's proposed
$24 billion reduction.
"I think he's ready to accept the will of this
committee in the House," said Rep. Al Ullman,

chairman of the House Ways and Means Commit
tee.
Last week the White House denied published
reports saying that Carter was prepared to com
promise on his tax cut. The denial came after
Ullman and other members of the committee met
with Carter. After the meeting, the lawmakers said
they detected a willingness on the president's part
to compromise.
Ullman (D-Ore.) wants to limit the tax cut to $15
billion in order to keep the nation's budget deficit
as low as possible.
Carter's reform team shuffled
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's cam
paign to reorganize the federal government is fal
ling behind schedule and will undergo a top-level
shake-out this week, administration officials say.
No personnel shifts are anticipated, but some
reorganization projects are likely to be shelved
and the whole effort will get a more business
oriented focus, the officials said.
Reasons offered for the delays include poor or
ganization, sluggish action by Congress, opposi
tion by Cabinet officials to losing any of their au
thority, and a tendency to distrust and repeat pre
vious reorganization studies.
it was also apparent from the interviews that
staff morale is beginning to suffer, although it re
ceived a boost last week from Carter's efforts to
end infighting in his Cabinet and his personal lob
bying for civil service revision, considered the
crown jewel of the reorganization project.
Italian masterpieces recovered
Florence, Italy — A barroom boast of a "big
theft" gave police the break they needed to re
cover a Rubens masterpiece and nine other paint
ings stolen in one of Italy's most daring art heists,
authorities said yesterday. Three suspects were
arrested.
Peter Paul Rubens' "The Three Graces" and the
other works, also Flemish, were found undam
aged early yesterday and returned to Florence's
famed Pitti Palace museum just two days after they
were stolen, police reported. Their value has been
estimated at more than $1 million.
Police said they arrested Franco Mefiti, 29, and
Giovanni Manfredi, 31, the alleged thieves, and
attorney Franco Brogi, 37, who was accused of
masterminding the operation. The three were
jailed on charges of theft and conspiracy, police
said.
Soviets close nuclear area gap
New York — The Soviet Union, which has long
outstripped NATO in conventional forces in
Europe, has "closed the gap" in the strategic nuc
lear area as well, Gen. Alexander Haig Jr., supreme
commander of NATO forces, said yesterday.
Haig was asked whether Soviet nuclear forces
are now equal or superior to those of the Western
alliance.
"I think the best response would be that our
deterrent is still viable, but that if these trends are
not reversed that in the very near future, we would
be without that deterrent," Haig said.
He said the Soviets have "closed the gap ... in
both the central strategic nuclear area and the

theater nuclear area."
He called that trend "worrisome" and said that
"remedial action" is necessary.
Haig, a supporter of deploying the neutron
bomb in Europe, said he recognized the political
factors involved in President jimmy Carter's deci
sion to postpone it.
