# University bonds get AAA rating
## 
### Kathy Andrews 
The University's $14,380,000 bond
issue received an AAA rating, the
highest possible, from bond-rating
agency Standard and Poor Wednes
day.
No other higher educational in
stitution has ever received Standard
and Poor's AAA rating without post
ing collateral. The University's bonds
are "debenture" bonds backed by
the University's promise to pay off
the loans, but by no collateral.
The University's issue also recently
obtained an AAA rating from
Moody's, investment analysts.
"We're delighted that both these
services have given us their highest
rating," Finance Director Rodney
Adams said. "This is a clear indica
tion of the attractiveness of Stanford
bonds in an otherwise uncertain
California market."
The University will seek the
$14,380,000 in tax-exempt bonds
through the California Educational

Facilities Authority on April 25.
The funds will be allocated to a
three-year $6.3 million electric steam
and chilled water plant improvement
project; temporary loans of $3.5 mill
ion to Green Library; the remodeling
of the History Corner ($3.2 million);
and a new $1.2 million computer
center. The remaining $180,000 will
cover costs of issuance.
Various sources of revenue will be
used to repay the bonds, according
to William Massy, vice-president for
business and finance. Some will
come from general funds, including
tuition, and some will be repaid
when gift pledges come due in four
or five years, he said.
Adams refused to comment on
what interest rate he expects the
bonds will bear.
The University will not have to rely
on tuition, gifts and other sources to
support the higher interest rate
which a lower rating would have im
posed, Massy said.
