# Low turnout may kill assessments
## 
### David Ansley 
It appears unlikely that any of the 11 fee assessment
requests, representing almost $200,000, were approved
in last week's ASSU elections because of low voter turn
out.
The ASSU Constitution requires that at least 20 per
cent of the student body vote on a fee assessment in
order for it to be approved. Although all the requests
were passed by a large majority, none drew a 20 per cent
turnout.
A report in Friday's Daily that three assessments
(KZSU, the Band and the Daily) had passed was based on
an inaccurate estimate of the number of registered stu
dents from Robert Houghton, associate registrar. His
estimate of 11,225 did not take into account terminal
graduate students.
A more accurate enrollment figure would be 11,964,
Houghton said Friday. Adding in some figures not yet
available "could bring it to 12,000," he added. Exact
figures will not be available for another week.
Sean Murphy, ASSU elections commissioner, said he
used a personal estimate of 11,400 students while tally
ing votes. However, he did not announce that any of the
assessments had passed.
The top vote-getter was KZSU with 2268 votes, while
the total number of students voting for Council of Presi
dents was 2092. Only two of the fee assessments, Publi
cations Board and Academic Organizations Board, re
ceived fewer than 2092 votes.
In addition to not knowing the precise registration
figures, the total voter turnout is also unknown. Only
one of the overseas campuses, Vienna, has reported its
returns.
A deadline of noon today has been set for receiving all
overseas ballots, Murphy said. Vote totals should be
complete by then.
There is an outside chance that KZSU, the Band and

the Daily, will be passed with the overseas ballots.
If the fee assessments are not approved, the damage
to some groups could bestaggering. Duringthe election
campaign, the Guest Professorship Board, Legal Coun
seling Office, Speakers Bureau, and Graduate Student
Association said the fee assessments represented their
entire budgets.
"Without the fee assessment, we will be in grave trou
ble," said Jon Morris, KZSU station manager, "That is 90
percent of our budget. We would be barely operating —
it would be pretty grim."
Barry Parr, chairman of the Publications Board, said,
"The half dozen publications that count on Publications
Board money will almost certainly be cut severely or quit
publishing entirely. The loss will be most critical for the
political and minority publications."
He listed Arena, Against the Grain, Winds, La Onda,
Real News and Aurora as those publications that would
be hurt most.
Without the Academic Organizations Board fee as
sessment, several undergraduate department associa
tions will be unable to function for at least one quarter,
said Pat Flinn, member of the Office of Student Affairs.
The Band will have to curtail all trips, except one to Los
Angeles without its assessment, Band Manager Alex Jar
detzky said. •
The ASSU program fee derives most of its funds from
fee assessment money. The program fee supports about
30 campus organizations. The Stanford Committee on
Political Education also planned to get most of its funds
from the fee assessment.
The ASSU Senate can declare a special election to
place the fee assessments before the voters again, ac
cording to the constitution. The ASSU Bylaws state that
costs for such an election might have to be borne by the
groups on the ballot.
