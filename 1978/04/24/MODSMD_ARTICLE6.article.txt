# Newton calls for leftist re-evaluation

"We have to start structuring a
world where people can live and
people can work without pitting
worker against worker and black
against white," Black Panther
Party founder Huey Newton told a
capacity crowd here Friday.
"Judging from the progress in
our country, we on the left have to
take a look at ourselves and re
evaluate our approach," he said.
In his speech as part of the Stan
ford Organizing Committee Dis
orientation Week, Newton said
his three-year exile to Cuba was
forced, not voluntary. However,
he said it gave him his first real
opportunity "to live with the
people and work with the people"
in a socialist country.
Newton praised the coopera
tion between the Cubans and
their care for one another. He
contrasted this to what he saw as

competitive selfishness in
America fostered by capitalism.
"I don't think there's any doubt
that the country is moving to the
right," Newton later told the
Daily. "And I don't say that I like it.
"But you'll notice that while the
country is moving to the right, the
right is having to answer more and
more questions, and their con
tradictions are showing up.
Watergate was a good example.
You had a lot of people question
ing authority then."
Newton said he wants socialism
to come about in America as a
stepping stone to communism.
When asked whether this change
would come about from within
the system or from outside the
system, he said, "it's not a ques
tion of inside or outside.
"Everyone is part of the system.
Changes will come when we
transform the system," he said.
