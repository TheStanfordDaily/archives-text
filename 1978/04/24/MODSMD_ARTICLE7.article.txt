# Heading for the exit
## Corporations in South Africa 
### 
New York Times

The campuses are astir again and the issue is South
Africa. Students and teachers want to attack that nation's
racist policies through the power of American corpora
tions doing business there. The protesters are asking the
universities to use their influence as stockholders to
force the corporations to reduce or abandon operations
in South Africa. That failing, they want the universities to
sell the stock. Similar demands have come from church
groups, foundations and major pension funds whose
portfolios include the shares of many of the 350 corpora
tions with investments in South Africa worth $1.7 billion.
They have made it the hottest issue at this season's
shareholder meetings.
The protest flows from the basic proposition that
Americans should not profit from a political system and
economy that are rooted in racist doctrine and envison
the permanent exploitation of South Africa's black
majority. Some of the protesters believe that American
pressure could significantly improve the conditions of
the blacks. All of them want, in any case, to cleanse the
American conscience by moving toward an end of all
collaboration with apartheid.
Admirable objective
The objective of the protest is clear and admirable. We
support it. South Africa is not the only racist nation on
earth; certainly not the only oppressive one. But no
other contemporary government — and certainly none
that stands for the culture of the West — has dared to
define itself as the embodiment of white supremacy. To
Americans now, such doctrine is simply unacceptable.
Gradually, so that there is time for the message to sink
in, Americans should be heading for the exit.
Yet the protest imposes great strain on the trustees of
nonprofit institutions and the executives of affected
corporations. While the students agitate, their elders
exchange anxious memorandums on the many ramifica
tions of the challenge. Some are resisting the pressure;
many seek to buy time with symbolic and marginal acts
of withdrawal, hoping that a more progressive spirit in
South Africa or a less ambiguous policy of the United
States Government may yet relieve that pressure. We
sympathize with their predicament.
The trustees of a university are required to invest their
endowments in the most productive and prudent ways.
They find it extremely difficult to manage that money
nowadays without acquiring some stock in some of the
350 firms with operations in South Africa or in the other
6000 who trade there. Only a few cents' worth of
every such share is likely to be at work in South Africa.
But by avoiding or unloading such holdings, a university
might well risk millions in income and corporate gifts.
Drawing the line
Where should they draw the line, the trustees won
der. To separate the various corporations, traders and

banks according to the quality of their South African
connection? To exclude those who invest in South Africa
but not those who buy and sell there? To distinguish
between firms that are withdrawing, however slowly,
and those that pursue added profit? And what, the trus
tees wonder, of the larger principle involved: Is there a
limit on the causes that could be pressed on them or
must they go after other objectionable regimes and
other worrisome but legal businesses — cigarettes,
firearms, gambling?
The imperfect answer for these trustees is that they
have to draw the line by their own evolving standards of
social responsibility, with due regard for deeply held
convictions in their communities. Some issues of public
agitation are ordinary or transient but some arise from a
vital sensibility. It is the job of trustees to recognize the
difference. How fast and how far to dissociate from
South Africa are still questions for debate, but the direc
tion of movement by Americans should be clear.
And in the end, the same standard will have to be
applied in the corporate board room. Most business
organizations are even less equipped than universities to
measure or modulate the political effects of their in
vestments abroad; for them to recognize a social re
sponsibility at home has been difficult enough. But
many have already concluded pragmatically that unrest
in South Africa and protest in the United States have
diminished the attractiveness of South African ventures.
And more than that they may never know. Most
spokesmen for South African blacks and liberal whites
now argue that foreign investment does more to sustain
the racist system than to promote the welfare of blacks.
Others, there and here, contend that foreign firms in
South Africa can be a source of support and inspiration
in the struggle against apartheid. No one can really
prove whether pressure for change is better applied by
staying or leaving.
Will and tactics
Ideally the national will and tactics here should be
determined by the expressions and regulations of the
Federal Government. Logically, the protesters should be
addressing the officials whose task it is to meld the
domestic and foreign interests of Americans and to give
guidance to businessessand investors. There is nothing
unusual or deplorable, however, about the definition of
public values from below; our standards of conduct are
often framed first by the protests of private citizens and
institutions. The demands of students in the current
case may be simplistic and the choices before the
decision-makers tangled. But if the nation's heart re
sponds to the agitation, as we hope it will, the head will
find a way.
