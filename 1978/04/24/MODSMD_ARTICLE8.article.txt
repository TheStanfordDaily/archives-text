# Keep Playboy out of Daily

Although I am an avid supporter of
the First Amendment to the Constitu
tion, I find it unfortunate that the
freedom of the press it guarantees
must be extended both to Playboy
magazine and to The Stanford Daily. I
refer of course to the dismal business
of the Stanford lasses who, through
the pimping of The Stanford Daily,
have gained the opportunity of a
lunchtime — to display their
shortcomings in Playboy's college
issue — or should I say, "expose?"
I'm sure that the $100 or so paid to
the twins, ef al., who cooperated with
Playboy will be useful to those young
women who earned it so quickly;
their pursuit of easy money is not
what angers me (though their lack of
discrimination does amaze me). The
offensive aspect of the whole situa
tion is that, in order to make a profit
from the sexist tastes of this nation, a
sexist and tasteless panderer of
softcore pornography (i.e., Playboy)
comes to Stanford to collect photo
graphic evidence that here in
"Camelot" there exists plenty of
fresh chicken just waiting to be
plucked. I am furtherappalled by the
encouragement given Playboy by the
Daily, via superfluous publicity and
via the interview arranged by the
editor of the Daily for the sole pur
pose of getting a "scoop."
Playboy would no doubt have
been quite able to find numerous
"California Girls" just aching to re
move their clothes for the
magazine's prying lenses; a talent
agents and modeling agencies are
specifically designed to aid in such
searches. I feel that the Daily could

easily have used its editorial preroga
tive to avoid the Playboy story until
after the hideous deed was done.
Had this been the case, Playboy
would still have gotten its photo
graphs (through the help of approp
riate talent agencies), the Daily
would still have gotten its story (i.e.,
the interviews with the models that
appeared after the photographic ses
sions), and the Daily would have av
oided the resentment of people like
myself who are opposed to the sexist
values epitomized by Playboy. An

ideal situation would have been one
in which our nation so respected the
dignity and rights of both men and
women that magazines such as
Playboy would not exist; unfortu
nately, this is just an ideal.
Let's hope that Playboy either stays
off campus or (better still) goes ban
krupt,and thatthe Daily sticks to "AP
News Summary" and "Bug Me,"
leaving the procuring to the pimps.
