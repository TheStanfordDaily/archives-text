# COP repudiates influence charges
## 
### Matt Mettler 
ASSU Co-president Greg Larson
denied Sunday night several charges
made by the Drysdale slate including
one that the current COP tried to
hinder potential COP slates from
forming in order to help the candi
dacy or the Goldenkranz slate.
The charges were made in a Drys
dale column printed in the Daily last
week, and in subsequent statements
by Drysdale, Duncan Evered and
Michael Bush, also members of the
Drysdale slate.
Robert Docters, a member of the
losing Schoenung COP slate, also
has charged that the present COP
tried to dissuade potential members
of his slate from running.
Drysdale said the present COP, by
trying to dissuade potential candi
dates from running, interfered with
his forming a slate. He added that
this interference was responsible for
the delays in preparing his slate's
platform. He said this hurt the Drys
dale slate in last week's election.
Larson, responding to the charges,
said Drysdale "has committed errors
of omission by not mentioning facts
which explain what happened, to put
the COP and the Goldenkranz slate
in a bad political light. I think it is a
cheap political trick."
Drysdale said ASSU Co-president
Steve Westly, who was a member of
the Elections Commission, also tried
to talk him out of running.
Westly said he told Drysdale he
didn't think he should run for several
reasons. Westly added he told Drys
dale he thought Drysdale was inex
perienced, and wouldn't have
enough time to devote to the ASSU.
Drysdale said he told Westly of his
"time management abilities and how
little time he spent studying."
Westly said he was talking to Drys
dale as an individual, and that he was
not trying to help Goldenkranz by
dissuading potential adversaries.
Kim Wright, a member of the
Schoenung slate, said last Thursday
that her slate will endorse the Drys
dale slate in the run-off election to
morrow and Thursday. Members of
the Drysdale and Schoenung slates
agreed before the election that they
would support the other if run-off
election with the Goldenkranz slate
occurred, Wright said.
She said they made this agreement
because both slates felt that left or
extreme liberal views are over rep

resented by the present senate and
by the Goldenkranz slate.
The Drysdale slate's column also
charged that Westly and ASSU Co
president Glenn Jordan tried to dis
suade Bush from joining the Drys
dale slate.
Westly said "he was not real sure
what he said to Bush" because he
was working on something else
when asked to pick up the phone
and join the conversation between
Bush and Jordan. Westly said he only
stayed on the phone a few minutes
and answered a few yes or no ques
tions.
In a written statement, Bush said
Jordan told Bush that "Drysdale was
too conservative and that he would
not be able to get anything ac
complished if he ran with Drysdale."
Bush said he told Jordan at that
time that he wasn't going to run but
after a discussion with Drysdale de
cided to re-enter the race.
Westly resigned from the elections
commission on Saturday, April 15, to
avoid the danger of being accused of
a conflict of interest because he sup
ported the Goldenkranz slate, Elec
tions Commissioner Sean Murphy
said.
Westly said that he resigned
primarily to avoid Drysdale's in
nuendo that he was trying to help
Goldenkranz' candidacy.
"I don't see any conflict of interest
when all I do is work on the lay-out of
the elections pamphlet and its dis
tribution," Westly explained.

agreed before the election that they
would support the other if run-off
election with the Goldenkranz slate
occurred, Wright said.
She said they made this agreement
because both slates felt that left or
extreme liberal views are over rep

resented by the present senate and
by the Goldenkranz slate.
The Drysdale slate's column also
charged that Westly and ASSU Co
president Glenn Jordan tried to dis
suade Bush from joining the Drys
dale slate.
Westly said "he was not real sure
what he said to Bush" because he
was working on something else
when asked to pick up the phone
and join the conversation between
Bush and Jordan. Westly said he only
stayed on the phone a few minutes
and answered a few yes or no ques
tions.
In a written statement, Bush said
Jordan told Bush that "Drysdale was
too conservative and that he would
not be able to get anything ac
complished if he ran with Drysdale."
Bush said he told Jordan at that
time that he wasn't going to run but
after a discussion with Drysdale de
cided to re-enter the race.
Westly resigned from the elections
commission on Saturday, April 15, to
avoid the danger of being accused of
a conflict of interest because he sup
ported the Goldenkranz slate, Elec
tions Commissioner Sean Murphy
said.
Westly said that he resigned
primarily to avoid Drysdale's in
nuendo that he was trying to help
Goldenkranz' candidacy.
"I don't see any conflict of interest
when all I do is work on the lay-out of
the elections pamphlet and its dis
tribution," Westly explained.
ASSU Co-president Greg Larson
denied Sunday night several charges
made by the Drysdale slate including
one that the current COP tried to
hinder potential COP slates from
forming in order to help the candi
dacy or the Goldenkranz slate.
The charges were made in a Drys
dale column printed in the Daily last
week, and in subsequent statements
by Drysdale, Duncan Evered and
Michael Bush, also members of the
Drysdale slate.
Robert Docters, a member of the
losing Schoenung COP slate, also
has charged that the present COP
tried to dissuade potential members
of his slate from running.
Drysdale said the present COP, by
trying to dissuade potential candi
dates from running, interfered with
his forming a slate. He added that
this interference was responsible for
the delays in preparing his slate's
platform. He said this hurt the Drys
dale slate in last week's election.
Larson, responding to the charges,
said Drysdale "has committed errors
of omission by not mentioning facts
which explain what happened, to put
the COP and the Goldenkranz slate
in a bad political light. I think it is a
cheap political trick."
Drysdale said ASSU Co-president
Steve Westly, who was a member of
the Elections Commission, also tried
to talk him out of running.
Westly said he told Drysdale he
didn't think he should run for several
reasons. Westly added he told Drys
dale he thought Drysdale was inex
perienced, and wouldn't have
enough time to devote to the ASSU.
Drysdale said he told Westly of his
"time management abilities and how
little time he spent studying."
Westly said he was talking to Drys
dale as an individual, and that he was
not trying to help Goldenkranz by
dissuading potential adversaries.
Kim Wright, a member of the
Schoenung slate, said last Thursday
that her slate will endorse the Drys
dale slate in the run-off election to
morrow and Thursday. Members of
the Drysdale and Schoenung slates
agreed before the election that they
would support the other if run-off
election with the Goldenkranz slate
occurred, Wright said.
