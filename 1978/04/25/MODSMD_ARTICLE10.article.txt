# Letters: senior slate, SOC 'praised'

To The Class of '79: this Wednes
day and Thursday there will be a
run-off election to choose our class
representatives. We urge you to vote
because we feel that Senior Class
Presidents can and should work to
give our class the best senior year
possible.
The Senior Class Presidents' duties
essentially reflect the immediate and
long-range concerns of their class.
They include organizing imaginative
and spirited parties; managing and
optimizing spending of a $4000
senior class budget; selecting a
commencement speaker; helping to
plan graduation activities; serving on
several university committees; and
keeping you (off-campus seniors in
cluded) informed of all the above
through newsletters and other
media.
Looking further down the road, we
think Senior Class Presidents should
help ease the transition to "life off
the Farm" by keeping you in touch
with the Alumni Association, the
CPPC, and other future oriented or
ganizations. On a more intangible
level, we'd like to promote the cohe
siveness that comes from a good
senior year.
Since January, we've been plowing
through acres of ideas to come up
with creative and workable plans that
would meet our responsibilities to
the class on both an individual and
collective level:
We'll provide a quarterly list of
places where you'll be able to get a
discount on beer, burgers, or even
brunch just because you're a senior.
This will save everyone money and
let you party on your own.
Next year you'll need recommen
dations. Class representatives in
each department will organize sherry
hours where seniors can meet pro
fessors. They'll also publish a calen
dar of relevant interviews and
events. Besides allowing us to keep
in touch with off-campus seniors,
these representatives will ease the
hassle of career hunting and make
your department a better place to be.
We'll start this spring out who you
want to hear at graduation and snag
him or her before anyone else
does . . . For the years after gradua
tion, we'll publish a senior class di
rectory and yearbook. .
There's more, and we'll be back in
White Plaza this week if you have any
questions. We don't think anyone

knows more about the Farm than
Farmers, and we hope you'll support
our efforts by voting for us this Wed
nesday or Thursday.

Represent everybody?
The Daily editorial (Monday, April
10) admonished the SOC slate
senators for failing to "understand
that they represent all the students.''
That kind of statement, which seems
to be a staple in the Daily diet, never
fails to surprise me. Since when have
the SOC senators, or anybody for
that matter, stated that elected rep
resentatives represent everybody?
Has anybody on the Daily editorial
board ever taken Poli. Sci. 1?
The SOC slate represents its con
stituency, a broad segment of the
student body that voted them, as a
slate, into office. This constituency is
made up of women, blacks,
Chicanos, Asian Americans, native
Americans, gay persons and even
white men. Of course, this consti
tuency is extremely diverse in politi
cal interests and outlook, and it
doesn't act monolithically on every
issue. Neither does the SOC senate
slate.
Personally, I don't wildly applaud
everything or everybody who tries to
speak for the so-called "left com
munity." But I support the SOC slate
senators and SOC itself for trying,
with some significant successes, to
represent my interests at Stanford.
By contrast, it has become obvious to
me that, with respect to addressing
my interests as an Asian American
and as a woman, the Daily falls flat on
its face. For that matter, addressing
the needs or interests of significant
communities within the student
body is something that quite often
doesn't get done here. One example
is the Office of Residential Education
and its unceremonious and unjust
axing of the two-quarter old An
drogyny Fiouse.
The assumptions implicit in the
Daily's smug characterizations of "all
the students" and their collective in
terests are more than mildly offen
sive to many communities on cam
pus. Under the guise of "objective
journalism," the Daily's editorials,
the events the Daily chooses to
cover, and the slanted coverage it

self, all testify to the Daily's represen
tation of non-whites and non-males
as non-persons.
I am critical of the Daily, but I can
not condemn it as a leader in its dis
regard for and ignorance of impor
tant members of the community. The
other "mainstream" publications on
campus, the American mass media
â€” they all do the same thing. In a
sense, the Daily is merely a reflection
"of a reflection of an ugliness in our
society.
Does the Daily want constructive
criticism? Maybe the Daily staff could
consider cultivating some sensitivity
to their readers, some of whom are
women and ethnic minorities.

At its meeting on April 13, the
ASSU Senate voted to fund $300 to
the Off-Campus Student Center
(OCSC) in support of the Center's
spring program. The senate action
was significant in that it represented,
for the first time, a formal recogni
tion by the senate of off-campus stu
dents' concerns.
Although one-fifth of its under
graduates and close to three
quarters of its graduate student
population live off-campus, Stanford
considers itself primarily a residen
tial university. The special needs of
those who live off-campus are there
fore often neglected or overlooked
by the University and bv the Student
Government.
In the past few years, through the
creation of the OCSC, the publica
tion of "Life Off the Farm," and sur
veys to off-campus residents, there
has been an increased awareness of
the needs and concerns of off
campus students. The recent senate
decision to support OCSC further
strengthens this awareness. On be
half of the students who participate
in our program, thank you, ASSU Se
nate. Special thanks are given to SOC
Senators David Catanzarite, Rick
Levy and Carlyle Kinnison for initiat
ing discussions with the OCSC staff
and forenlisting the support of other
senators to make our spring program
a reality.

SOC 'thanked'
I would like to thank Grethel et al.
for their excellent explanation of the
Stanford Organizing Committee's
political perspective. I found their ar
ticle to be very illuminating. I shall
certainly keep the SOC's views on
fairness, fidelity to constituencies,
and democratic procedures in mind
when my repressive, bourgeois vote
is being sought during next election.
I feel that the SOC does not give
itself enough credit in providing a
political education to the Stanford
community; I have definitely been
shown who the elitists are on this
campus.

Grupo Moncada visited Stanford
on Tuesday of this week and ticket
sales significantly increased after an
article ran in the Daily publicizing the
event. A nearly-filled Kresge Au

events on camus and suggested that
a little publicity does much toward
stimulating that interest.
We thank you not only for con
tributing to the success of an excel

many people in the Stanford com

tural experience.
We ask for your continued rep
resentation of the Latin American

To The Class of '79: this Wednes
day and Thursday there will be a
run-off election to choose our class
representatives. We urge you to vote
because we feel that Senior Class
Presidents can and should work to
give our class the best senior year
possible.
The Senior Class Presidents' duties
essentially reflect the immediate and
long-range concerns of their class.
They include organizing imaginative
and spirited parties; managing and
optimizing spending of a $4000
senior class budget; selecting a
commencement speaker; helping to
plan graduation activities; serving on
several university committees; and
keeping you (off-campus seniors in
cluded) informed of all the above
through newsletters and other
media.
Looking further down the road, we
think Senior Class Presidents should
help ease the transition to "life off
the Farm" by keeping you in touch
with the Alumni Association, the
CPPC, and other future oriented or
ganizations. On a more intangible
level, we'd like to promote the cohe
siveness that comes from a good
senior year.
Since January, we've been plowing
through acres of ideas to come up
with creative and workable plans that
would meet our responsibilities to
the class on both an individual and
collective level:
We'll provide a quarterly list of
places where you'll be able to get a
discount on beer, burgers, or even
brunch just because you're a senior.
This will save everyone money and
let you party on your own.
Next year you'll need recommen
dations. Class representatives in
each department will organize sherry
hours where seniors can meet pro
fessors. They'll also publish a calen
dar of relevant interviews and
events. Besides allowing us to keep
in touch with off-campus seniors,
these representatives will ease the
hassle of career hunting and make
your department a better place to be.
We'll start this spring out who you
want to hear at graduation and snag
him or her before anyone else
does . . . For the years after gradua
tion, we'll publish a senior class di
rectory and yearbook. .
There's more, and we'll be back in
White Plaza this week if you have any
questions. We don't think anyone

Represent everybody?
The Daily editorial (Monday, April
10) admonished the SOC slate
senators for failing to "understand
that they represent all the students.''
That kind of statement, which seems
to be a staple in the Daily diet, never
fails to surprise me. Since when have
the SOC senators, or anybody for
that matter, stated that elected rep
resentatives represent everybody?
Has anybody on the Daily editorial
board ever taken Poli. Sci. 1?
The SOC slate represents its con
stituency, a broad segment of the
student body that voted them, as a
slate, into office. This constituency is
made up of women, blacks,
Chicanos, Asian Americans, native
Americans, gay persons and even
white men. Of course, this consti
tuency is extremely diverse in politi
cal interests and outlook, and it
doesn't act monolithically on every
issue. Neither does the SOC senate
slate.
Personally, I don't wildly applaud
everything or everybody who tries to
speak for the so-called "left com
munity." But I support the SOC slate
senators and SOC itself for trying,
with some significant successes, to
represent my interests at Stanford.
By contrast, it has become obvious to
me that, with respect to addressing
my interests as an Asian American
and as a woman, the Daily falls flat on
its face. For that matter, addressing
the needs or interests of significant
communities within the student
body is something that quite often
doesn't get done here. One example
is the Office of Residential Education
and its unceremonious and unjust
axing of the two-quarter old An
drogyny Fiouse.
The assumptions implicit in the
Daily's smug characterizations of "all
the students" and their collective in
terests are more than mildly offen
sive to many communities on cam
pus. Under the guise of "objective
journalism," the Daily's editorials,
the events the Daily chooses to
cover, and the slanted coverage it

self, all testify to the Daily's represen
tation of non-whites and non-males
as non-persons.
I am critical of the Daily, but I can
not condemn it as a leader in its dis
regard for and ignorance of impor
tant members of the community. The
other "mainstream" publications on
campus, the American mass media
â€” they all do the same thing. In a
sense, the Daily is merely a reflection
"of a reflection of an ugliness in our
society.
Does the Daily want constructive
criticism? Maybe the Daily staff could
consider cultivating some sensitivity
to their readers, some of whom are
women and ethnic minorities.

At its meeting on April 13, the

for the first time, a formal recogni

Although one-fifth of its under

has been an increased awareness of

To The Class of '79: this Wednes
day and Thursday there will be a
run-off election to choose our class
representatives. We urge you to vote
because we feel that Senior Class
Presidents can and should work to
give our class the best senior year
possible.
The Senior Class Presidents' duties
essentially reflect the immediate and
long-range concerns of their class.
They include organizing imaginative
and spirited parties; managing and
optimizing spending of a $4000
senior class budget; selecting a
commencement speaker; helping to
plan graduation activities; serving on
several university committees; and
keeping you (off-campus seniors in
cluded) informed of all the above
through newsletters and other
media.
Looking further down the road, we
think Senior Class Presidents should
help ease the transition to "life off
the Farm" by keeping you in touch
with the Alumni Association, the
CPPC, and other future oriented or
ganizations. On a more intangible
level, we'd like to promote the cohe
siveness that comes from a good
senior year.
Since January, we've been plowing
through acres of ideas to come up
with creative and workable plans that
would meet our responsibilities to
the class on both an individual and
collective level:
We'll provide a quarterly list of
places where you'll be able to get a
discount on beer, burgers, or even
brunch just because you're a senior.
This will save everyone money and
let you party on your own.
Next year you'll need recommen
dations. Class representatives in
each department will organize sherry
hours where seniors can meet pro
fessors. They'll also publish a calen
dar of relevant interviews and
events. Besides allowing us to keep
in touch with off-campus seniors,
these representatives will ease the
hassle of career hunting and make
your department a better place to be.
We'll start this spring out who you
want to hear at graduation and snag
him or her before anyone else
does . . . For the years after gradua
tion, we'll publish a senior class di
rectory and yearbook. .
There's more, and we'll be back in
White Plaza this week if you have any
questions. We don't think anyone

knows more about the Farm than
Farmers, and we hope you'll support
our efforts by voting for us this Wed
nesday or Thursday.

Represent everybody?
The Daily editorial (Monday, April
10) admonished the SOC slate
senators for failing to "understand
that they represent all the students.''
That kind of statement, which seems
to be a staple in the Daily diet, never
fails to surprise me. Since when have
the SOC senators, or anybody for
that matter, stated that elected rep
resentatives represent everybody?
Has anybody on the Daily editorial
board ever taken Poli. Sci. 1?
The SOC slate represents its con
stituency, a broad segment of the
student body that voted them, as a
slate, into office. This constituency is
made up of women, blacks,
Chicanos, Asian Americans, native
Americans, gay persons and even
white men. Of course, this consti
tuency is extremely diverse in politi
cal interests and outlook, and it
doesn't act monolithically on every
issue. Neither does the SOC senate
slate.
Personally, I don't wildly applaud
everything or everybody who tries to
speak for the so-called "left com
munity." But I support the SOC slate
senators and SOC itself for trying,
with some significant successes, to
represent my interests at Stanford.
By contrast, it has become obvious to
me that, with respect to addressing
my interests as an Asian American
and as a woman, the Daily falls flat on
its face. For that matter, addressing
the needs or interests of significant
communities within the student
body is something that quite often
doesn't get done here. One example
is the Office of Residential Education
and its unceremonious and unjust
axing of the two-quarter old An
drogyny Fiouse.
The assumptions implicit in the
Daily's smug characterizations of "all
the students" and their collective in
terests are more than mildly offen
sive to many communities on cam
pus. Under the guise of "objective
journalism," the Daily's editorials,
the events the Daily chooses to
cover, and the slanted coverage it

self, all testify to the Daily's represen
tation of non-whites and non-males
as non-persons.
I am critical of the Daily, but I can
not condemn it as a leader in its dis
regard for and ignorance of impor
tant members of the community. The
other "mainstream" publications on
campus, the American mass media
â€” they all do the same thing. In a
sense, the Daily is merely a reflection
"of a reflection of an ugliness in our
society.
Does the Daily want constructive
criticism? Maybe the Daily staff could
consider cultivating some sensitivity
to their readers, some of whom are
women and ethnic minorities.

Senate thanked .
At its meeting on April 13, the
ASSU Senate voted to fund $300 to
the Off-Campus Student Center
(OCSC) in support of the Center's
spring program. The senate action
was significant in that it represented,
for the first time, a formal recogni
tion by the senate of off-campus stu
dents' concerns.
Although one-fifth of its under
graduates and close to three
quarters of its graduate student
population live off-campus, Stanford
considers itself primarily a residen
tial university. The special needs of
those who live off-campus are there
fore often neglected or overlooked
by the University and bv the Student
Government.
In the past few years, through the
creation of the OCSC, the publica
tion of "Life Off the Farm," and sur
veys to off-campus residents, there
has been an increased awareness of
the needs and concerns of off
campus students. The recent senate
decision to support OCSC further
strengthens this awareness. On be
half of the students who participate
in our program, thank you, ASSU Se
nate. Special thanks are given to SOC
Senators David Catanzarite, Rick
Levy and Carlyle Kinnison for initiat
ing discussions with the OCSC staff
and forenlisting the support of other
senators to make our spring program
a reality.

SOC 'thanked'
I would like to thank Grethel et al.
for their excellent explanation of the
Stanford Organizing Committee's
political perspective. I found their ar
ticle to be very illuminating. I shall
certainly keep the SOC's views on
fairness, fidelity to constituencies,
and democratic procedures in mind
when my repressive, bourgeois vote
is being sought during next election.
I feel that the SOC does not give
itself enough credit in providing a
political education to the Stanford
community; I have definitely been
shown who the elitists are on this
campus.
