# Jury deliberating murder charge

Santa Ana (AP) — A jury
began deliberating a murder
charge against Dr. William
Waddill Jr. yesterday after a
judge told the panel they could
find the obstetrician guilty if
"by act or omission" he caused
the death of an infant who sur
vived an abortion.
Orange County Superior
Court Judge James Turner also
gave an instruction that under
mined Waddill's contention it
was humane to allow the death
of the almost aborted baby girl
because she would have been
severely brain-damaged had
she survived.
"A child's right to medical
treatment is not diminished by
what the quality of the child's

future life might be," the judge
told jurors.
He stressed that the abortion
performed by Waddill on
March 2, 1977, was legal and
may not be used to support a
conviction. Waddill's conduct
after the abortion is the issue.
Baby Girl Weaver was born
alive after the saline abortion.
She died about an hour later,
and Waddill is accused of
strangling her.
During the 14-week trial, the
prosecution modified its posi
tion, claiming that even if
Waddill did not strangle the
baby he still could be found
guilty of murder for failing to
use extraordinary medical
measures to save her life.

In his instructions, the judge
told the nine-man, three
woman jury: "You may not
find the defendant guilty of
murder unless you are satisfied
that the conduct of the defen
dant, by act or omission, was
the proximate cause of the
death of the Baby Girl
Weaver."
He added: "You must be
satisfied that Baby Girl Weaver
would have lived longer had it
not been for the conduct of the
defendant."
After the half-hour instruc
tions ended and jurors retired

to select their foreman and de
liberate, Waddill's attorney,
Charles Weedman, told repor
ters he was particularly dis
turbed by one of the instruc
tions, to which he had ob
jected strenuously.
The instruction allows jurors
to reach a unanimous verdict
of guilty of first-degree murder
even if they do not agree on the
cause of death — even if some
believe the baby died of
strangling and others believe it
died because the doctor didn't
try to save it.
