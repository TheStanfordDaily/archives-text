## rock/dave anderson Genesis: brilliant band comes of age 
### 
Amidst a backdrop of mul
ticolored lights, huge mirrors
and lasers, Genesis made a
triumphal recent return to the
Bay Area. From the first ap
pearance of the group before
opening song, "Eleventh Earl
of Mar," until Coliseum offi
cials turned on the lights after
the encore, "I Know What I
Like," the sold-out audience
cheered and applauded wildly.
Even the tunes from the
group's newest album, "And
Then There Were Three," (re
leased only three weeks ago)

garnered strong audience ap
proval.
Complete with two hired
musicians — guitarist Darryl
Stuermer filling the gap left by
Steve Hackett's sudden exit
last fall, and Chester
Thompson reassuming his
duties as tour drummer —
Genesis performed a show
more energetic and stylishly
perfect than last year's Wind
and Wuthering concert. This
was almost unbelievable con
sidering the fact that the band
already has won top honors for

best stage band of 1977, as
voted by the readers of the En
glish equivalent to Billboard,
Melody Maker magazine.
Mood lighting
The brilliant staging did not
overshadow the group, as is
the case with many produc
tions. Instead it served only to
highlight the music and the
performers. The lighting alone
accented the mood of the
music; in conjunction with the
overhead mirrors, it acted as
spotlighting for the four in
strumentalists. This eliminated

the often distracting element
of light-jockeys playing games
fifty feet above the audience.
Lasers, which have become the
most popular way of drawing
away the listener's attention
during weaker moments in the
music, were controlled by lead
singer Phil Collins, who used
them only during the most per
fectly played, intricate sections
of the show.
Seeking to eliminate the
ghost of Peter Gabriel which
has haunted them since the
ex-leader departed the band in

'75, Genesis has totally cut
"Foxtrot" album selections,
"Watcher in the Skies," and
the epic "Supper's Ready"
from the tour. These songs
probably best symbolized
Gabriel and his distinctive
stage style. However, Collins'
Friday performance only suc
ceeded in making Peter's gh
ostly presence more strongly
felt than on either of the previ
ous two tours.
Constant movement
Although Phil Collins has his
own singing characteristics
which distinguish his astonish
ingly similar voice from that of
his predecessor, Collins' state
presence has become very re
miniscent of Gabriel. His
energy, when not singing or
drumming, is vented in con
stant movement about the
stage.
The presence of Steve Hac
kett is also missed on this tour.
Both guitarists, Stuermer and
Rutherford, had trouble handl
ing some of the riffs which they
inherited from the former lead
guitarist. Mike Rutherford,

who has been Genesis' bass
guitarist since the band's con
ception, missed more than a
few notes on "Ripples," but
later proved his competence as
a lead player on songs from the
new album, "Down and Out,"
and "Burning Rope."
Likewise, although some
Hackett lines did not come
easy to Darryl Stuermer, espe
cially in "Eleventh Earl of Mar,"
he showed his extremely fast
technique in "Fountain of Sal
macis" and "Los Endos/Dance
on a Volcano."
Keyboardist Tony Banks was
his usual reserved but musi
cally perfect self. His lines, bas
ically simple compared to
those of Rick Wakeman or
Keith Emerson, flowed beauti
fully in songs such as "One for
the Vine" and "Afterglow,"
while his flashes of quick fin
gering in others such as "The
Lady Lies," "Deep in the
Motherlode," and"I Know
What I Like" were clear and
precise.
Chester Thompson, for
merly of Zappa and Weather

Report, is fast proving himself
to be one of the best drummers
in rock music today. He is the
main reason why Phil Collins
has been able to develop as
lead singer. Unlike the last
tour, when Thompson arid Col
lins shared most of the drum
ming, Chester has become the
primary drummer of the 1978
show. His rhythms keep the
band as tight as they could pos
sibly be. Chester and Phil
drumming together in "Cinema
Show," and "Burning Rope,"
and playing against each other
in "Los Endos" is not only au
rally but visually spectacular.
The 1978 "Evening with
Genesis" show proves Genesis
to be a band which has defi
nitely come of age. Their stag
ing is excellent; their emo
tional output is thrilling; and
their musicianship is virtually
perfect. The reputation which
they earned for themselves on
the last tour can only be
bolstered by the brilliance of
the 1978 tour. They deserved
every standing ovation they re
ceived, and more.
