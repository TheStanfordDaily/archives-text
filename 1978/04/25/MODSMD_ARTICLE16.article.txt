## At ACT: 'Absurd' is hilarious 
### 
What does it mean to be
married and comfortably living
in a suburb of London? Not
much, according to British
playwright Alan Ayckbourn's
prize-winning comedy "Ab
surd Person Singular," cur
rently playing at the American
Conservatory Theatre's Geary
Street location in the city.
"Absurd Person Singular" is
an hilarious biting satire which
attempts to dissect every as
pect of British society from
adultery to television commer
cials. It revolves around the
lives of three couples: a
woman-chasing architect with
a delighttul though suicidal
wife, an arrogant banker mar
ried to an outgoing woman
with a drinking problem, and a
punctual, social climbing land
developer whose compulsively
neat wife would put Mr. Clean
to shame.
Why in the kitchen?
The play's action occurs in
three scenes, on three succes
sive Christmas Eves, in each of
the couples' kitchens.
Ayckbourn has chosen the
kitchen as their meeting place
because he believes that an in
dividual's behavior in the
kitchen most accurately re
flects his true personality, in
cluding his neuroses.
Ayckbourn's six characters
are marvelous creations, for
each is riotously neurotic in his
own particular way. When
these individuals meet, laugh

ter is inevitable, for as each
character follows his or her
own motivations, he cannot
help but clash with the others.
Ayckbourn's social com
ment strikes hard at the institu
tion of marriage. None of the
three couples are truly happy
together; they don't even
communicate with each o'her.
Only the land developer, Sid
ney, and his wife lane are in
any way well-suited for each
other. They are both so nit
picking that no one else could
stand to live with either of
them.
Happily neurotic
The six actors involved in this
production give excellent per
formances in demanding parts.

In particular, Daniel Davis and
Susan Pellegrino shine as Sid
ney and )ane. Their man
nerisms and vocal delivery are
happily, utterly neurotic.
The other actors cannot be
faulted for bringing less life to
their roles, for Ayckbourn did
not develop these characters
as fully as Sidney and Jane. In
addition, though Ayckbourn's
script is hilarious in parts, it is
rather uneven in other places,
plagued by the over-use of cer
tain actions and cliches which
tend to make the play too pre

dictable.
Of the three acts, only the
third fails to convince the audi
ence. While the first and sec
ond acts provide a gooci mesh
of comedy and social com
ment, the tone of the final act is
much too serious for this play.
The tinal scene is especially
disappointing, consisting of an
unexpected character "freeze"
and blackout, which leaves the
audience thinking "so what?"
It is indeed unfortunate that
the play ends on such a
downbeat, for overall, it suc
ceeds brilliantly.
