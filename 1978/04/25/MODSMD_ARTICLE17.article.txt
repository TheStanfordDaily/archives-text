### 
Students interested in ac
tively supporting the Lively
Arts at Stanford will have a spe
cial opportunity to do so be
ginning in September.
A committee of 10 to 15 stu
dents that will work with the
Lively Arts at Stanford and as
sist in its Community Outreach
Program is being formed by the
Office of Public Events.
The Lively Arts presents per
forming arts events on campus
throughout the year. These
events range from jazz to
dance to chamber music and
theater presentations by the
world's foremost performing
artists.
"The student committee is
being formed for severalr
reasons," says Vicky Holt, di
rector of the Office of Public:
Events. "First, the Lively Arts
was established to provide fine
arts entertainment to students,
faculty and staff at Stanford.

Students lead an incredibly
fast-paced life and they are also
deluged with information about
things to do. We've ques
tioned the best, most efficient
way to reach them with Lively
Arts information.
"It seemed logical to ask
them directly and them offer
interested students a chance to
get involved in the program."
A project such as the Lively
Arts upcoming noon concerts
at Tresidder Union is ideal for
students, says Holt. "The May
2, 3 and 4 concerts and ac
tivities (outdoor barbecue, bal
loons, frisbees, flowers and
popcorn) have been entirely
planned and coordinated by

students working in the Office
of Public Events," she adds.
A sign-up sheet will be avail
able at these noon concerts for
students interested in working
on the Lively Arts (ommittee.
Students can also sign up any
time in the Office of Public
Events, Press Courtyard.
Students who sign up will
then be interviewed before the
end of the quarter.
