Review of Hearst case refused
San Francisco— Patricia Hearst's lawyers, depre
ssed over the U.S. Supreme Court's refusal yes
terday to review her 1976 bank robbery conviction,
made immediate plans fora last-ditch fight to keep
the newspaper heiress out of prison foranotherl4
months.
The Supreme Court made no explanation of its
decision. Only Justice William Brennan voted to
review the case, saying he would have limited the
panel's study to the admissibility into trial evi
dence of recordings of Hearst's conversations in
jail.
KRON set for trial on TV 'crime'
San Francisco — A state court trial is scheduled
for June 26 on whether NBC affiliate KRON-TV is
responsible for the sexual assault on a 9-year-old
girl because it showed a movie depicting a similar
crime.
The case involves the sexual attack on the young
girl by four females ranging in age from 10 to 15,
who told police they got the idea for their crime
from watching the fictional drama "Born Inno
cent." The drama was televised on KRON-TV four
days before the actual crime.
At issue in the appeal, turned down without
comment by the Supreme Court, was whether
broadcasters could be sued on charges that they
were "reckless" or "negligent" in showing vio

lence that may be imitated by television viewers.
The program was televised Sept. 10, 1974. It
dealt with the life of an unwanted child, a teen
aged girl. In one segment, the girl was assaulted by
a group of girls in a reformatory prison and was
"raped" with the wooden handle of a plunger.
Four days later, the San Francisco girl was simi
larly attacked at a local beach by the four girls
using a soft drink bottle.
Hanna sentenced to prison
Washington — Despite a tearful apology and his
attorney's fervent plea for mercy, former Califor
nia Rep. Richard T. Hanna was ordered yesterday
to spend six months to 2Vi years in prison for his
role in the Korean influence-buying scandal.
Hanna, a white-haired, 64-year-old Democrat, is
the only past or present member of Congress to be
convicted in the case. One other, former Rep.
Otto Passman of Louisiana, has been charged, and
at least two more indictments are widely expected.
But after Hanna himself had spoken, his voice
trailing off in choked emotion, Chief District Judge
William Bryant looked him coldly in the eye and
ordered him to surrender to a federal prison
within 30 days after the Justice Department de
cides upon the appropriate facility.
He must serve at least six months before he is
eligible for parole.

Long corruption probe predicted
Sacramento — A special grand jury convened
about alleged political corruption in the California
Legislature was warned yesterday that it may take
many months to hear evidence in the case.
During the past eight months, FBI agents have
questioned dozens of legislators, lobbyists, legis
lative employees and others about potential brib
ery or influence-buying by lobbyists.
The FBI made only one public statement, con
firming that it was investigating potential "political
corruption" which might violate federal laws.
