# Office gives thrifty legal advice

Jane S. got a prompt refund on her
dishonored hotel reservation de
posit. John T. had his arrest record
cleared. Ben C. got his money for a
defective purchase back.
These hypothetical cases all illus
trate the services offered by the
ASSU Legal Counseling Office
(LCO).
The LCO is designed to give legal
counseling and advice to all students
and student spouses, with the excep
tion of those who have requested
back their dollar fee assessment, ac
cording to Glen Schofield, one of
LCO's practicing attorneys.
"It's a cheap form of legal insur
ance," Schofield said. "It guarantees
the right to talk to an attorney."
Most of the problems brought to
the LCO "justdon'twarrant" the cost
of a visit to a practicing attorney,
Schofield added. In Palo Alto the av
erage hourly rate charged by a lawyer
is $50 to $70, he added.
There are no restrictions on the
kind of problems LCO handles,
Schofield said. "We encourage
people to come in and discuss a situ
ation before a problem arises."
However, the LCO cannot handle
problems involving the University,
such as housing disagreements,
Schofield said. Those cases are refer
red to the ombudsman.
The LCO is staffed by four practic
ing attorneys from a San Jose law
firm. The office is open three days a
week. Schofield said about 10 to 15
students come in each day. The
lawyers do not represent students in
court, Schofield said. Their primary
function is to give advice.
Most of the problems handled by
the LCO are not the kind that require
litigation anyway, according to
Schofield. Often, he said, a letter or
phone call from a lawyer to a stub
born car dealer or landlord will
"solve the problem." And many of
the cases involve only enough
money for small claims court, where
lawyers are forbidden, he added.
Schofield said common problems
include landlord-tenant disputes. He

cited examples of landlords who re
fuse to return security deposits to
tenants. Another frequent problem
concerns students involved in bike
and car accidents who often do not
carry insurance. In these and similar
cases, Schofield said, the lawyers
discuss the legal aspects of the case
with the student, giving advice and
explaining the available legal op
tions.
The LCO began several years ago
when students voted in the 1973
spring election to approve a fee as
sessment for the LCO. Several firms
were interviewed before the current
firm of Morgan, Ruby, Franich,
Schofield and Fredkin was chosen to
command the LCO.
At the time, legal counseling was a
fairly new idea according to
Schofield. "Our practice is people
oriented and the idea of providing
students access to the legal system
appealed to us."
Schofield said he sees the LCO as a
way to help students. But not
everyone seems to agree with this.
Criticisms of the LCO were voiced
at a recent ASSU Senate meeting in
which Schofield requested that a fee
assessment for the LCO be placed on
last week's ballot.
Several senators suggested the
LCO could be staffed with law stu
dents or that students could simply
seek out friends with parents who
are practicing attorneys.
Schofield said, however, law stu
dents cannot give legal advice on
their own since they are not mem
bers of the bar. As for seeking a
lawyer friend or relative, Schofield
said that while students here proba
bly have more access to lawyers than
the average person, they may not
have access to the right kind of
lawyer.
Students have come to the office
explaining that their fathers are anti
trust lawyers, for example, who can
not explain the options open to a vic
tim of petty theft, Schofield said.
Schofield said the "economics
can't be justified," but he enjoys
working with students. LCO attor

neys receive about one-fourth the
hourly fee they would in private prac
tice, according to LCO office assis
tant Iris Boudart.
The LCO is also staffed by eight to
10 volunteer Stanford law students.
They serve as assistants to the
lawyers, according to Nanette
Schulze, LCO student assistant
coordinator. The law students sit in
on client interviews, Schulze said.
Depending on the case, the law stu
dents may write up the account of
the case, draft letters, make phone
calls and do research, Schulze ad
ded.
One student who has been to the
LCO recently said her case involved a
family dispute about a pet. The stu
dent said the LCO was "really help
ful" in explaining the alternatives in
her case.
"They couldn't say specifically
what would happen but they could
explain the options," she said.

Last week's tentative election re
sults make the future of the LCO un
certain. The LCO operates entirely
on fee assessment money, with the
exception of a $10 charge for drafting
wills, Bouchart said.
One student said she was sorry to
see that the fee assessment for the
LCO did not pass. The "possibility of
needing help like that is really re
moved from people's minds," she
said, "but when they do need it, it's
great to have."

the right to talk to an attorney."
Most of the problems brought to
the LCO "justdon'twarrant" the cost
of a visit to a practicing attorney,
Schofield added. In Palo Alto the av
erage hourly rate charged by a lawyer
is $50 to $70, he added.
There are no restrictions on the
kind of problems LCO handles,
Schofield said. "We encourage
people to come in and discuss a situ
ation before a problem arises."
However, the LCO cannot handle
problems involving the University,
such as housing disagreements,
Schofield said. Those cases are refer
red to the ombudsman.
The LCO is staffed by four practic
ing attorneys from a San Jose law
firm. The office is open three days a
week. Schofield said about 10 to 15
students come in each day. The
lawyers do not represent students in
court, Schofield said. Their primary
function is to give advice.
Most of the problems handled by
the LCO are not the kind that require
litigation anyway, according to
Schofield. Often, he said, a letter or
phone call from a lawyer to a stub
born car dealer or landlord will
"solve the problem." And many of
the cases involve only enough
money for small claims court, where
lawyers are forbidden, he added.
Schofield said common problems
include landlord-tenant disputes. He

cited examples of landlords who re
fuse to return security deposits to
tenants. Another frequent problem
concerns students involved in bike
and car accidents who often do not
carry insurance. In these and similar
cases, Schofield said, the lawyers
discuss the legal aspects of the case
with the student, giving advice and
explaining the available legal op
tions.
The LCO began several years ago
when students voted in the 1973
spring election to approve a fee as
sessment for the LCO. Several firms
were interviewed before the current
firm of Morgan, Ruby, Franich,
Schofield and Fredkin was chosen to
command the LCO.
At the time, legal counseling was a
fairly new idea according to
Schofield. "Our practice is people
oriented and the idea of providing
students access to the legal system
appealed to us."
Schofield said he sees the LCO as a
way to help students. But not
everyone seems to agree with this.
Criticisms of the LCO were voiced
at a recent ASSU Senate meeting in
which Schofield requested that a fee
assessment for the LCO be placed on
last week's ballot.
Several senators suggested the
LCO could be staffed with law stu
dents or that students could simply
seek out friends with parents who
are practicing attorneys.
Schofield said, however, law stu
dents cannot give legal advice on
their own since they are not mem
bers of the bar. As for seeking a
lawyer friend or relative, Schofield
said that while students here proba
bly have more access to lawyers than
the average person, they may not
have access to the right kind of
lawyer.
Students have come to the office
explaining that their fathers are anti
trust lawyers, for example, who can
not explain the options open to a vic
tim of petty theft, Schofield said.
Schofield said the "economics
can't be justified," but he enjoys
working with students. LCO attor

neys receive about one-fourth the
hourly fee they would in private prac
tice, according to LCO office assis
tant Iris Boudart.
The LCO is also staffed by eight to
10 volunteer Stanford law students.
They serve as assistants to the
lawyers, according to Nanette
Schulze, LCO student assistant
coordinator. The law students sit in
on client interviews, Schulze said.
Depending on the case, the law stu
dents may write up the account of
the case, draft letters, make phone
calls and do research, Schulze ad
ded.
One student who has been to the
LCO recently said her case involved a
family dispute about a pet. The stu
dent said the LCO was "really help
ful" in explaining the alternatives in
her case.
"They couldn't say specifically
what would happen but they could
explain the options," she said.

Last week's tentative election re
sults make the future of the LCO un
certain. The LCO operates entirely
on fee assessment money, with the
exception of a $10 charge for drafting
wills, Bouchart said.
One student said she was sorry to
see that the fee assessment for the
LCO did not pass. The "possibility of
needing help like that is really re
moved from people's minds," she
said, "but when they do need it, it's
great to have."
Jane S. got a prompt refund on her
dishonored hotel reservation de
posit. John T. had his arrest record
cleared. Ben C. got his money for a
defective purchase back.
These hypothetical cases all illus
trate the services offered by the
ASSU Legal Counseling Office
(LCO).
The LCO is designed to give legal
counseling and advice to all students
and student spouses, with the excep
tion of those who have requested
back their dollar fee assessment, ac
cording to Glen Schofield, one of
LCO's practicing attorneys.
