Although medical schools across the country have
reported a sharp decline in applications, the number of
students applying to Stanford Medical School has
merely stabilized.
"This is the first year the number of applicants has not
gone up from last year," said Cheryl Lomaglio, adminis
trative assistant at the Med School's admissions office.
"It's stayed steady at about 5600 applicants."
Lomaglio said that between 100 and 140 applicants are
accepted every year and about 86 students actually en
roll.
In a recent edition of The Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion, the Association of American Medical Colleges

(AAMC) reported a 10 per cent decline in the number of
students applying to U.S. medical schools.
Approximately 41,000 students applied in 1977-78
while a preliminary estimate of 37,000 was cited for
1978-79.
AAMC reportedly cited the rising costs of medical
education as one of the reasons for the decline. While
Georgetown University has reported it will charge
$12,500 to first-year students entering next fall, tuition at
most medical schools in 1978-79 will range from $2200 to
$9140, the association stated in the article.
Stanford's three-quarter tuition may jump from its
present $4695 to $5130 next year, Bob Butler, finance
manager of the Med School reported earlier this year.
