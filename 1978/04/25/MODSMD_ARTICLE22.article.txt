# Society affects medical service
## 
### Chan Wheeler 
The only way "to understand the lack of commun
ity control in the practice of medicine is to look at the
general problems of society," said Public Health Prof.
Vicente Navarro Friday at a Med School lecture.
Navarro's speech was part of the SOC Disorienta
tion Week program.
Navarro spoke about the effect the social distribu
tion of power has on the medical profession and on
the health of the American people. Navarro, a Mar
xist, is a professor at the John Hopkins University
School of Public Health, and the author of "Medicine
Under Capitalism."
Navarro said he supported a National Health Ser
vice as one way to ensure community control of
health care services.
However, Navarro said, "Models of other coun
tries' approaches to health services might lead us to
wrong answers. We should not be for the Cuban
model of medicine, or for the People's Republic of
China's model. The American people will define what
is needed. We should be for the American system."
Medicine focuses on the individual rather than the
inter-relationships in the community, Navarro said.
To understand why, we must examine the "political
environment and the relationship between the own
ership of production and the general populace," he
added.
"Indeed, we are a working class society. Five per
cent of the population owns 75 per cent of the wealth

and overwhelming power in the political, social and
economic spheres. Power follows particular class
lines" and while America is "supposed to be a middle
class society with incidental extremes of
wealth,.. .the middle class society is more illusion
than fact," Navarro said.
Despite the "propaganda" supporting the virtues
of the free market on TV and in the press, a recent
Harris poll shows "the American people are not
fooled. Sixty per cent of the population believes that
big business supports government and government
supports big business," Navarro added.
Navarro also discussed what he called the "ten
sion" between the American worker and his or her
work. "Workers are increasingly compartmentalized
and have less control over what they do."
Navarro criticized the idea that individuals have
final control over their lifestyles. Most individuals are
stuck in their class, limited by work skills and other
factors, according to Navarro.
Navarro said that about 70 per cent of the nation's
automobile workers are generally drugged during
work. He asked, "What do you tell the giddy auto
worker who has bills to pay, a specific skill to market
and an uncompassionate employer— "change your
lifestyle" to solve your problems?
Instead of blaming the victims, we should under
stand the social "production of the problems," he
said.
