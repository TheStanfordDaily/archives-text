After her husband had two rooms
specially remodeled at Stanford
Hospital, a Saudi Arabian princess
gave birth to a baby boy here last
week, a Hospital spokesperson told
the Daily.
Prince Alwaleed Alsaoud, a 21-
year-old Menlo College student, do
nated funds for the remodeling of
the two rooms, which Hospital au
thorities said will probably be used
later as an alternative birth center.
If the alternative birth center is ap
proved, women who choose alterna

tive birth methods will be able to de
liver in a pleasant environment with
their families around them, accord
ing to the Hospital news bureau.
The princess, Dalai Saoud Alsaoud
did not deliver by alternative
childbirth method, according to
Hospital sources.
Alsaoud said in a recent press con
ference he had spent about $6000 to
$7000 on decorations for the two
rooms, which include carpeting, oil
paintings and rocking easy-chairs.
These furnishings will remain in
the rooms but hospital authorities

said they are not sure how the rooms
will be used until Stanford receives
state approval for the alternative
birth center.
Hospital administrators are "seri
ously discussing ways in which the
rooms can be used," said Karen
Richards R.N., coordinator of the re
decorating project.
"The rooms still need more
equipment and further physical
changes before they can be used as
an alternative birth center," she said.
Richards added Hospital adminis
trators hope state approval for the
center will be granted before the end
of summer.
Richards and Prof. Kent Ueland of
the Hospital's department of
gynecology and obstetrics said the
Hospital had been planning the al
ternative birth center before the pr
ince donated funds.
Although all rules for the center
have not yet been established, it has
been decided that only licensed
physicians will be allowed to deliver
the infant, Ueland said. Fathers,
labor coaches or grandparents may
also be allowed in the room as long
as they are dressed in clean clothes
or surgical garb.
The Hospital already allows fathers
