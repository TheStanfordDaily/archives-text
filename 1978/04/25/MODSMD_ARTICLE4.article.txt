# Newborn son enjoys prince's gift

After her husband had two rooms
specially remodeled at Stanford
Hospital, a Saudi Arabian princess
gave birth to a baby boy here last
week, a Hospital spokesperson told
the Daily.
Prince Alwaleed Alsaoud, a 21-
year-old Menlo College student, do
nated funds for the remodeling of
the two rooms, which Hospital au
thorities said will probably be used
later as an alternative birth center.
If the alternative birth center is ap
proved, women who choose alterna

tive birth methods will be able to de
liver in a pleasant environment with
their families around them, accord
ing to the Hospital news bureau.
The princess, Dalai Saoud Alsaoud
did not deliver by alternative
childbirth method, according to
Hospital sources.
Alsaoud said in a recent press con
ference he had spent about $6000 to
$7000 on decorations for the two
rooms, which include carpeting, oil
paintings and rocking easy-chairs.
These furnishings will remain in
the rooms but hospital authorities

said they are not sure how the rooms
will be used until Stanford receives
state approval for the alternative
birth center.
Hospital administrators are "seri
ously discussing ways in which the
rooms can be used," said Karen
Richards R.N., coordinator of the re
decorating project.
"The rooms still need more
equipment and further physical
changes before they can be used as
an alternative birth center," she said.
Richards added Hospital adminis
trators hope state approval for the
center will be granted before the end
of summer.
Richards and Prof. Kent Ueland of
the Hospital's department of
gynecology and obstetrics said the
Hospital had been planning the al
ternative birth center before the pr
ince donated funds.
Although all rules for the center
have not yet been established, it has
been decided that only licensed
physicians will be allowed to deliver
the infant, Ueland said. Fathers,
labor coaches or grandparents may
also be allowed in the room as long
as they are dressed in clean clothes
or surgical garb.
The Hospital already allows fathers
to be in the delivery room, "even
during a Caesarian section," Ueland
said. "In this respect, we are fairly
liberal compared to other institu
tions."
Ueland said studies have shown
that young children do not benefit as
much from watching a live birth as
had been previously thought, so they
are rarely allowed in the delivery
room.
However, properly supervised
children can visit their mother im
mediately after birth on the postpar
tum floor. Children can also visit the
maternity unit, he added.
In many cases, it will be possible
for mothers to return home four to
six hours after delivery, Ueland said.
The Hospital has requested a grant
from March of Dimes which will "or
ganize the education of alternative
childbirth and supply the Hospital
with booklets on alternative
childbirth methods."
The booklets will probably be
translated into Spanish as well, he
added.
Ueland said he hopes the March of
Dimes grant will also provide funds
for a nurse who can help mothers
who have returned home.
The grant has been approved on a
local level and final word will be re

ceived in a few weeks, he said. If
approved, the grant should arrive at
the Hospital by late summer or early
fall.
The Medical School offers no clas
ses in alternative childbirth proce
dures, although students do learn
methods through their regular
obstetrics clerkships, Ueland said.
"It will be a problem offering stu
dents the chance to learn in the al
ternative birth center," Ueland said,
"because mothers desiring this type
of childbirth usually want as few
people around as possible. But
hopefully, we can find a way to
handle this problem."
Ueland cited the alternative birth
center as the Hospital's "answer to
home delivery." He said the center
will offer a home-like atmosphere
"located in the Hospital, where risks
are diminished."
"The chances of problems occur
ring during delivery are very slim, but
complications are unforeseen and
unpredictable. A hospital should be
there to handle emergencies."
Ueland said the Hospital currently
offers a back-up service for women
who decide to deliver at home but
suffer complications during delivery.
"We'll help them (mothers) if
someone can bring them to the Hos
pital," he said.
