## Sororities finish this season's rush 
### Lee Tien 
With the assignment of bids last
Saturday, sororities at the University
completed rush for the first time
since 1943. According to Inter-
Sorority Council (ISC) rush chairper
son Tammy Ritchey, 150 women
pledged sororities here, raising the
total of women in sororities to about
240.
"We really had no idea how many
people to expect," said Ritchey. "But
we're very excited by the turnout.
There's an awful lot of enthusiasm in
the group. I think this shows that
sororities do have a place at Stan
ford."
The six active sororities are: Kappa
Kappa Gamma (Kappas), with 39
pledges; Kappa Alpha Theta
(Thetas), with 38 pledges; Alpha Phi,
with 36 pledges; Pi Beta Phi (Pi Phis),
with 30 pledges; Chi Omega, with
five pledges; and Alpha Omicron Pi
(A O Pis), with two pledges.
Kappa Delta began rush but drop
ped out after a week and was re
placed by the A O Pis. They will be
allowed to continue "open rush" for
the rest of the year, according to
Ritchey.
Cindy Hadden, ISC president and
Theta president, agreed with Ritchey
saying that she was very pleased.
"This is really exciting. Sororities are
something needed here."
Hadden said the ultimate test of
the strength of sororities will be their
ability to maintain their position.
"The big question now, beside re
covering from rush, is whether we
can maintain this level of interest
over time. I don't think they're a
novelty, they're something needed,"
she said.
Dean of Student Affairs Jim Lyons
said, "nobody knew what to expect.
I'm not at all surprised — but the real
test is in sustained interest. To the

extent that they (the sororities) pro
vide a social organization with op
portunities for friendship, it should
provide social stability, much as resi
dence priorities in University hous
ing are designed to do."
Plans for the future are mostly
concerned with organizational mat
ters, said Madden.
"After having doubled our mem
bership, we'll need some time to get
together. Our main goal is just to get
to know each other."
According to )ill Liscom, ISC trea
surer and Pi Phi president, next on
the agenda will be pledge training.
"This is mostly educational. The
pledges will learn about the sorority
— who the founders were, its his
tory, and its philanthropy.
"Each sorority has a national ser
vice project which all of the local
chapters are involved with. For in
stance, we are associated with an
arts-and-crafts school in the Ap
palachians," she said.
Turning to the sorority housing
situation, Ritchey said, "On-campus
housing is a long way down the road.
Frankly, I'm not really concerned
with that at all."
Hadden said, "I think it's good for
the sorority to not all live together.
The sorority is a chance to meet other
women, but it's good to still have
friends where you live, too."
Assoc. Dean for Residential Educa
tion Norm Robinson said that
"sororities will have to apply for
housing justlikeany special house —
and since no one has yet applied, it's
hard to say anything about it."
"We've developed a new set of
criteria for new houses. There will be
a series of questions that the sorority
will have to address in the proposal.
The crucial point is, will they be able
to maintain interest?" added Robin
son.

together. Our main goal is just to get
to know each other."
According to )ill Liscom, ISC trea
surer and Pi Phi president, next on
the agenda will be pledge training.
"This is mostly educational. The
pledges will learn about the sorority
— who the founders were, its his
tory, and its philanthropy.
"Each sorority has a national ser
vice project which all of the local
chapters are involved with. For in
stance, we are associated with an
arts-and-crafts school in the Ap
palachians," she said.
Turning to the sorority housing
situation, Ritchey said, "On-campus
housing is a long way down the road.
Frankly, I'm not really concerned
with that at all."
Hadden said, "I think it's good for
the sorority to not all live together.
The sorority is a chance to meet other
women, but it's good to still have
friends where you live, too."
Assoc. Dean for Residential Educa
tion Norm Robinson said that
"sororities will have to apply for
housing justlikeany special house —
and since no one has yet applied, it's
hard to say anything about it."
"We've developed a new set of
criteria for new houses. There will be
a series of questions that the sorority
will have to address in the proposal.
The crucial point is, will they be able
to maintain interest?" added Robin
son.
With the assignment of bids last
Saturday, sororities at the University
completed rush for the first time
since 1943. According to Inter-
Sorority Council (ISC) rush chairper
son Tammy Ritchey, 150 women
pledged sororities here, raising the
total of women in sororities to about
240.
"We really had no idea how many
people to expect," said Ritchey. "But
we're very excited by the turnout.
There's an awful lot of enthusiasm in
the group. I think this shows that
sororities do have a place at Stan
ford."
The six active sororities are: Kappa
Kappa Gamma (Kappas), with 39
pledges; Kappa Alpha Theta
(Thetas), with 38 pledges; Alpha Phi,
with 36 pledges; Pi Beta Phi (Pi Phis),
with 30 pledges; Chi Omega, with
five pledges; and Alpha Omicron Pi
(A O Pis), with two pledges.
Kappa Delta began rush but drop
ped out after a week and was re
placed by the A O Pis. They will be
allowed to continue "open rush" for
the rest of the year, according to
Ritchey.
Cindy Hadden, ISC president and
Theta president, agreed with Ritchey
saying that she was very pleased.
"This is really exciting. Sororities are
something needed here."
Hadden said the ultimate test of
the strength of sororities will be their
ability to maintain their position.
"The big question now, beside re
covering from rush, is whether we
can maintain this level of interest
over time. I don't think they're a
novelty, they're something needed,"
she said.
Dean of Student Affairs Jim Lyons
said, "nobody knew what to expect.
I'm not at all surprised — but the real
test is in sustained interest. To the

extent that they (the sororities) pro
vide a social organization with op
portunities for friendship, it should
provide social stability, much as resi
dence priorities in University hous
ing are designed to do."
Plans for the future are mostly
concerned with organizational mat
ters, said Madden.
"After having doubled our mem
bership, we'll need some time to get
together. Our main goal is just to get
to know each other."
