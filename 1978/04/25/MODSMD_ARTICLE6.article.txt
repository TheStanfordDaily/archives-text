# Highest court refuses to hear Franklin appeal

### 
Washington (AP) — The Supreme Court yesterday left untouched a decision
by the University of Colorado's board of regents to ignore administrators'
recommendations and not hire outspoken Marxist H. Bruce Franklin as an
English professor.
The justices refused to hear Franklin's appeal that the regents' decision
infringed on his free speech rights.
"I suppose it's predictable that the Burger court would not be interested in
protecting the First Amendment," said Franklin.
Franklin applied for a job at Colorado in 1973. Only 35 at the' time, Franklin
was recognized as a renowned scholar of American literature who had pub
lished nine books and numerous literary articles.
The school's English faculty, the appropriate college dean and the univer
sity president recommended that Franklin be hired even though they said his
appointment would be controversial because of his political views.
Franklin previously had been fired from his teaching job at Stanford Uni
versity after giving speeches at public rallies opposing the Vietnam war.
The Colorado regents' 8-1 vote in 1974 against hiring Franklin was the first
time in its history the university failed to hire a faculty member recommended
by faculty and administration members.
Franklin sued the school, charging it had violated his civil rights. He lost
before a federal trial judge and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
The appeals court ruled last year that while some of the regents may have
had constitutionally impermissible motives for not hiring Franklin, the pro
fessor failed to prove that he was rejected primarily for such reasons.
In seeking Supreme Court review, Franklin's lawyers argued that past
Supreme Court decisions on free speech should force the University of
Colorado to reconsider Franklin's application. They argued that the school is
barred from considering whether he would be a disruptive force.
