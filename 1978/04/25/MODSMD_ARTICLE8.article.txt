## Docters et al. support Drysdale Final views on COP slates 
### 
Jennings recommends Goldenkranz

Goldenkranz slate endorsed
The graduate community should
take heart. For the first time in my
recollection, every aspiring COP
slate includes a grad student!
I have now interviewed each of the
slates. Their members are all reason
ably competent and dedicated
people; they would not be running
seriously for this office otherwise.
However, I do feel that one particular
slate stands out from the rest — in
their overall experience, balance,
and approach.
This assertion is a positive one.
This year, there are no "joke" slates
in the field — not even any who don't
recognize their own hilarity!
But rarely have I seen in ASSU poli
tics a group of people with the obvi
ous abilities and strengths of the
Golden kranz/Petty/Estes/Morimoto
slate. They seem to have assembled a
group of mature, responsible, seri
ous people whose proposals are in
formed, realistic, and important.
They also demonstrate the experi
ence and knowledge to carry out
these aims with a minimum of mis
directed energy.
Goldenkranz and Petty show ex
tensive familiarity with how things
actually get done around here, and
have proven their abilities by doing
them. Estes, a graduate in education,
is less experienced but seems force
ful, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic
enough to revive the ASSU's flagging
commitment to graduate concerns.
Morimoto impressed me as the
weakest of a very strong group —
after a mere hour of discussion. Vet
she shows drive and commitment;
her "shortcomings" are mostly rela
tive.
The Drysdale/Evered/Felt/Bush
Slate has a good general appcoach to
COP functions. Drysdale's dominant
influence — as a graduate in business
and law — leads them to emphasize
management and organizational
theory in directing ASSU activities.
Evered impressed me with his ex
perience and personal solidity, yet
even he didn't seem up-to-date on a
number of important issues. Bush
stressed the need for a greater com
mitment to affirmative action, but
did not impress me with any real un
derstanding of the COP's potential
influence on such questions. Felt
seemed even vaguer on the question
of "How?", mainly echoing Drys
dale's general concerns about
"openmindedness" and communi
cation.
This slate is long on sincerity and
good intentions, but almost com
pletely lacking in details or specific
proposals. It may get them elected,
but it won't do much else.
Drysdale's past performance also
admits of some concern; he is always
strong on ideas and apparent drive,
but sometimes hasn't followed up
with as much determination as was
indicated. He seems also less familiar
with general graduate and campus
concerns than I would have ex
pected.
Consequently, for me the choice is
clear. I shall vote for the
Goldenkranz/Petty/Estes/Morimoto
slate for the ASSU Council of Presi
dents. I think that they have the di
versity, experience, balance, and
perspective to do the most for the
ASSU and all the rest of us chickens
out here. In fact, they are the
strongest COP slate that I have yet
seen in contention.
(Deric Jennings, a graduate student
in economics, was on the 1976-77
ASSU Council of Presidents.)
Drysdale recommended
We recommend the Drysdale slate
in the COP run-off election. George
Drysdale, a JD-MBA graduate stu
dent, heads the most capable slate to
run for the office in years. Commit
ted to specific improvements in stu
dent services, they offer the only al
ternative, now, to a wasted vote, to
the confusion we've seen in the past
year.
This slate fought an uphill battle to
the run-off. There was strong pres

sure on the ASSU to disqualify the
Drysdale slate over a technicality in
the election laws.
This is understandable, as the
Drysdale slate is committed to ex
panding the mandate of the COP
beyond the politicians and the ex
tremists.
One is able to point to a vast
number of differences between the
run-off COP slates. We choose to
highlight three areas:
Philosophically, differences are
apparent. The Drysdale-Evered-
Felt-Bush slate has labeld itself, and
indeed is, "moderate." In a broad
sense, the Goldenkranz-Petty-
Estes-Morimoto slate will behave as a
Stanford Organizing Committee
(SOC) slate. The Drysdale slate will
be a better representative of stu
dents than the narrowly-based Gol
denkranz slate.
How will the COP deal with the
university infrastructure? The simple
reality is when Andrew Golden krantz
walks into an university office in tat
tered jeans, and makes unsupported
demands upon a middle-aged ad
ministrator, he will get nowhere. On
the other hand, Drysdale attempts to
reasonably persuade administrators;
he will get results. He will be more
effective and will be perceived as a
true representative of the students.

Personalities do matter. They will
determine the effectiveness of the
next COP. We think Mary Morimoto
and Fred Estes are as nice people as
we have met at Stanford.
Goldenkranz, in contrast, is
power-hungry and uncandid.
Further, Goldenkranz isaproductof
SOC. The COP must be trusted. The
office certifies petitions and repre
sents students. For these reasons we
will vote for Drysdale, Evered, Felt
and Bush.
The Drysdale slate will be a breath
of fresh air in a stale and tired ASSU.
Drysdale, Evered, Felt and Bush offer
experience and involvement in di
verse campus associations. This will
reduce the sideshow atmosphere of
the ASSU and involve the entire
community in ASSU responsibilities.
More effective student services,
improved graduate life, positive
movement on affirmative action and
the role of women at Stanford —
these goals are backed by de
monstrated honesty, ability and
committment.
Vote for the slate which will bring
fewer scandals and more ac
complishments: the Drysdale slate.
