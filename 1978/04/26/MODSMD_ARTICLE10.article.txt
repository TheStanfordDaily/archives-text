# On the importance of voting

Last Wednesday and Thursday, the
ASSU Spring Ballot was presented to
the voters of the Stanford commun
ity. The ballot was long, and under
standably so; it contained three COP
slates, four referenda on present
campus issues, eleven fee assess
ment requests, and four proposed
constitutional amendments.
Last week's election was to decide
a number of important issues. In
stead, the dismal voter turnout
seems to make another election
necessary, at a cost that could run as
high as $2000.00.
What happened? I suppose most
people simply felt the election to be
unimportant, believing that any de
cisions made would not affect them.
But that's just not true. Take for
example the fee assessment re
quests. Basically, the ballot provides

the students an opportunity to pass
judgment on a very large budget.
The collective value of the prop
osed fee assessments: $185,000, a
tidy sum indeed. These monies are
desperately needed by campus
groups to fund projects and causes.
Yet only 2 of 11 students bothered to
vote. Since a 20 per cent turnout is
needed to validate a fee assessment
proposal, that means that KZSU, the
BAND, SCOPE, etc. are now officially
without a dime of fee assessment
money.
Now just ask youself a question or
two. Have you ever boogied to the
strains of "All Right Now," read The
Daily, The Real News, Winds, The
Arena, or Aurora, attended a guest
lecture (Stansfield Turner, Ben Brad
lee, Milton Friedman, etc.), or lis
tened to KZSU? The answer, in most

cases, is probably yes. But the fact
remains that only 2 of 11 people
voted . . . ridiculous.
The ballot included constitutional
amendments on sexist language,
separate fee assessment levying, fi
nancial audits, and overseas fee as
sessment exemptions. Fortunately,
even with the low voter turnout, 3 of
the 4 passed.
The questions asked of the student
body concerning de Beauvior
House, corporate withdrawal from
South Africa, returning residence
priorities, and the Western Culture
requirement were an effort on the
part of the senate to guage student
opinion on important campus issues.
However, a low voter turnout,
coupled with the relative closeness
of the ballot tabulations on a majority
of the questions, makes the results
inconclusive at best.
Finally, the ballot contained
another very important proposal:
the COP race. This year, the ASSU
has been torn with controversy on a
number of occasions. Twicestudents
have been asked to sign petitions to
reverse a decision of the senate.
Frustrations felt
As a member of that illustrious
body, I have on occasion found it
quite frustrating to deal with certain
members of the senate with whom I
disagree politically (a statement that I
feel certain is shared by each and
every member of the senate, regard
less of ideology).
Yet, while the senate may not be
quite representative of the student
population as a whole, it is without
question the legitimate body for stu
dent government on campus. Why?
Because each member of the senate
was selected by the voters at the bal
lot box. (bourgeois indeed!)
Still, throughout the year I have
spoken with many people dissatis
fied with the senate's make-up and
often with its narrow political ap
proach as well. Some criticism is jus
tified; some is not.
Yet the simple fact remains that the
present senate was duly elected to
office. Of course only 3 of 11 people
voted in that election, but those who

vote decide those who win. I wonder
where the other eight votes would
have fallen.
This year's COP race/s important.
The ASSU has resources totalling
$1.5 million. The fact that less than 18
per cent of the student population
voted is, after this year in particular,
amazingly frustrating. So many
people complain that they are forgot
ten, that they aren't being treated
fairly, that they aren't getting what
they deserve. So many people disa
gree with decisions made by the
elected officials of the ASSU without
completing the very necessary pre
requisite of voting.
Express yourself
At this point, only two COP slates
remain, each with personnel, qual
ifications, and priorities quite diffe
rent than the other. If you care about
where your money is spent, then
vote. If you feel that your interests
have been ignored in the past, then
vote for the slate that best represents
those interests. If you agree with the
goals of a particular slate or if you
disagree with the goals of a particular
slate, then vote and express that pre
ference.
It's very easy to dismiss the ASSU
as unworthy of your interest. Many
people believe, and perhaps justifi
ably, that ASSU government is made
up of resume'-building, power
hungry ego-maniacs. Yet, true or
not, the simple truth is thatsomeone
is going to fill those offices. If, in the
end, you find yourself voting for the
lesser of two evils, fine. Ignoring the
process altogether accomplishes lit
tle or nothing.
Wednesday and Thursday of this
week, a run-off election for the COP
will be held. Decisions made by next
year's COP will affect you, maybe not
directly, but they will affect you just
the same. If you prefer one slate to
the other, then help put them in of
fice. Get out and vote, and then next
year you can complain as much as
you want with impunity.

Yet the simple fact remains that the
present senate was duly elected to
office. Of course only 3 of 11 people
voted in that election, but those who

vote decide those who win. I wonder
where the other eight votes would
have fallen.
This year's COP race/s important.
The ASSU has resources totalling
$1.5 million. The fact that less than 18
per cent of the student population
voted is, after this year in particular,
amazingly frustrating. So many
people complain that they are forgot
ten, that they aren't being treated
fairly, that they aren't getting what
they deserve. So many people disa
gree with decisions made by the
elected officials of the ASSU without
completing the very necessary pre
requisite of voting.
Express yourself
At this point, only two COP slates
remain, each with personnel, qual
ifications, and priorities quite diffe
rent than the other. If you care about
where your money is spent, then
vote. If you feel that your interests
have been ignored in the past, then
vote for the slate that best represents
those interests. If you agree with the
goals of a particular slate or if you
disagree with the goals of a particular
slate, then vote and express that pre
ference.
It's very easy to dismiss the ASSU
as unworthy of your interest. Many
people believe, and perhaps justifi
ably, that ASSU government is made
up of resume'-building, power
hungry ego-maniacs. Yet, true or
not, the simple truth is thatsomeone
is going to fill those offices. If, in the
end, you find yourself voting for the
lesser of two evils, fine. Ignoring the
process altogether accomplishes lit
tle or nothing.
Wednesday and Thursday of this
week, a run-off election for the COP
will be held. Decisions made by next
year's COP will affect you, maybe not
directly, but they will affect you just
the same. If you prefer one slate to
the other, then help put them in of
fice. Get out and vote, and then next
year you can complain as much as
you want with impunity.

Last Wednesday and Thursday, the
ASSU Spring Ballot was presented to
the voters of the Stanford commun
ity. The ballot was long, and under
standably so; it contained three COP
slates, four referenda on present
campus issues, eleven fee assess
ment requests, and four proposed
constitutional amendments.
Last week's election was to decide
a number of important issues. In
stead, the dismal voter turnout
seems to make another election
necessary, at a cost that could run as
high as $2000.00.
What happened? I suppose most
people simply felt the election to be
unimportant, believing that any de
cisions made would not affect them.
But that's just not true. Take for
example the fee assessment re
quests. Basically, the ballot provides

the students an opportunity to pass
judgment on a very large budget.
The collective value of the prop
osed fee assessments: $185,000, a
tidy sum indeed. These monies are
desperately needed by campus
groups to fund projects and causes.
Yet only 2 of 11 students bothered to
vote. Since a 20 per cent turnout is
needed to validate a fee assessment
proposal, that means that KZSU, the
BAND, SCOPE, etc. are now officially
without a dime of fee assessment
money.
Now just ask youself a question or
two. Have you ever boogied to the
strains of "All Right Now," read The
Daily, The Real News, Winds, The
Arena, or Aurora, attended a guest
lecture (Stansfield Turner, Ben Brad
lee, Milton Friedman, etc.), or lis
tened to KZSU? The answer, in most

cases, is probably yes. But the fact
remains that only 2 of 11 people
voted . . . ridiculous.
The ballot included constitutional
amendments on sexist language,
separate fee assessment levying, fi
nancial audits, and overseas fee as
sessment exemptions. Fortunately,
even with the low voter turnout, 3 of
the 4 passed.
The questions asked of the student
body concerning de Beauvior
House, corporate withdrawal from
South Africa, returning residence
priorities, and the Western Culture
requirement were an effort on the
part of the senate to guage student
opinion on important campus issues.
However, a low voter turnout,
coupled with the relative closeness
of the ballot tabulations on a majority
of the questions, makes the results
inconclusive at best.
Finally, the ballot contained
another very important proposal:
the COP race. This year, the ASSU
has been torn with controversy on a
number of occasions. Twicestudents
have been asked to sign petitions to
reverse a decision of the senate.
Frustrations felt
As a member of that illustrious
body, I have on occasion found it
quite frustrating to deal with certain
members of the senate with whom I
disagree politically (a statement that I
feel certain is shared by each and
every member of the senate, regard
less of ideology).
Yet, while the senate may not be
quite representative of the student
population as a whole, it is without
question the legitimate body for stu
dent government on campus. Why?
Because each member of the senate
was selected by the voters at the bal
lot box. (bourgeois indeed!)
Still, throughout the year I have
spoken with many people dissatis
fied with the senate's make-up and
often with its narrow political ap
proach as well. Some criticism is jus
tified; some is not.
Yet the simple fact remains that the
present senate was duly elected to
