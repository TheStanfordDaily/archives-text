# Greek vs. non-Greeks foreseen
## Sororities here are no different

The arguments being used by
sorority women here to justify their
reorganization seem to reflect a de
fensive attitude. They feel that op
position within this community is un
justly trying to deny them the
privileges which they are working
hard to establish.
Outwardly it may seem this way,
but most of those who oppose
sororities are not so unreasonable or
nearsighted as they are assumed to
be. Their disapproval is not based on
jealousy, or ignorance, or even a fear
that sorority stereotypes will be per
petuated, but upon skepticism as to
how sororities will ultimately affect
our community.
The success of this first rush al
ready portends numerous complica
tions which may serve to ruin much of
the continuity which our student
body now shares.
Certainly, the unique oppor
tunities which a sorority offers for
close friendships, social activities,
community involvement, leader
ship, etc. are all very real advantages.
Belonging to a sorority during my
first two years at a Big Ten university
was without doubt the greatest factor
in making my life there enjoyable.
But even there, where there is a
pressing need for students to find an
alternative to mass existence, to seek
a narrower, more homogeneous so
cial millieu, such opportunities are
available only at the expense of limit
ing students to subgroups which

have virtually no interaction. When
no other alternatives for small-group
living and easy social interaction
exist, justification can be found for
sororities despite their negative as
pects.
But women here have managed
well without them for thirty years,
not demanding the return of
sororities but merely accepting their
recent sanction as an unexpected
opportunity. The question is whether
the advantages of sororities will out
weigh the problems they are likely to

upon women students and created
unnatural social tension throughout
the undergraduate community.
Exclusivity is both the greatest ad
vantage of a sorority and also its
major drawback. Perhaps in this ini
tial year of recolonization there is a
place in the sorority system for every
interested woman, but what about
ten years from now, when there may
be three rushees for each available
spot?
When the vast majority of perhaps

So far the image which Stanford
sororities have been presenting us,

of sorority support.
Furthermore, sororities are gain
