cause.
Stanford's major reason for
reinstituting sororities is that men
have Creek living groups, so women
should have them too. But it is impor
tant to recognize that sororities are
not just like fraternities. At any
school which has both there is more
pressure for a woman to belong to a
sorority than for a man to belong to a
fraternity.
We tend to overlook the fact that
sororities did not simply die out at
Stanford, but were abolished be
cause their tremendous popularity
made them a devisive influence

through rush prefer the same popu
lar houses, each of which can accept
only a limited number of new mem
bers, most women are forced to
make a compromise in order to be
long to a sorority at all.
It is a difficult task for a house with
a 100 per cent rushee return rate to
choose about 20 pledges out of
perhaps more than 500 prospects.
Elimination of all but the most
dynamic rushees is based on factors
which are entirely arbitrary.
Sorority women are not trying to
be snobby when they choose for
their members those who are the
best looking, most outgoing and
make the best idle conversation.
They simply have no more substan
tial criteria from which to select new
members within such a brief period.
It is precisely the privilege of
selecting and living exclusively with
one's friends which makes the soror
ity concept so appealing. As indi
viduals we each select our friends
with equal descrimination, but we do
not need to formally reject our non
friends. Sororities don't like to reject
people, but to those women who are
denied membership, this is not an
attitude which they can fully accept.
Defenders of sororities argue that
this problem will never reach such
proportions here. That Stanford stu
dents can perceive themselves as
above the social trifles of other
schools has always struck me as
peculiar.
Is it that our intellectuality de
mands that we seek paths to enjoy
ment which differ from those fol
lowed by our lesser counterparts?
We are not unique and neither is our
approach to sororities.

Stanford or not. If they are not well
accepted, they will probably be
forced to fold for financial reasons
and all of our fears will have been
unnecessary. If they last, there is no
reason to doubt that they may take
on a social importance equal to that
of the 1940'5.
That fraternities can exist here
without creating tension and com
petition is an argument which will
not be applicable to sororities. To
begin with, Stanford fraternities are a
peculiar institution. They probably
lose many prospective members be
cause they are often perceived as of
fering all of the social advantages of a
boy's prep school.
They will inevitably be com
plemented and strengthened by the
existence of sororities. Fraternities
will cooperate more with each other
as well as with sororities and the
camaraderie .ind enthusiasm within
the Greek system can only increase.
The only danger of this community
is that it can become self-contained.
Greeks will havelessand less need or
desire to make contacts outside of
their own system. Obviously, the up
shot will be a growing rift between
Greeks and non-Greeks.
It would be nice if sororities could
be simply "Groups of girls who can
keep in touch with their friends
throughout school" (Sue Briden
baugh, the Daily, 4/20/78), but a suc
cesstul sorority necessarily consists
of far, far more.
Despite their positive purpose, are
Stanford's sororities prepared to
deal with the problems their exis
tence is likely to create?
