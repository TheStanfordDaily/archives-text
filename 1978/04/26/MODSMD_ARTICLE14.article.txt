The Daily's April 6 article on
anorexia nervosa omitted several
germane points in the rapidly chan
ging perception of this disorder. De
scribing anorexia as a "psycological
disorder" which "reflects intense
fears that the patient faces as she ma
tures" is not only dangerously
simplistic, but very possibly errone
ous.
Although a description of anorexia
nervosa was first published in 1694,
both its cause and treatment remain
obscure. The three hundred year old
assumption that it should be re
garded as a psychological illness has
often resulted in less than successful
patient care.
Today research on anorexia ner
vosa is no longer the sole domain of
psychiatry. Researchers in many
fields of medicine are searching for
causal factors. New data indicates
that people suffering with anorexia
may have an immature element in

the hormonal system. This would ac
count for the extremely high precen
tage of puberty aged women man
ifesting this disorder.
Improvements have occurred in
several patients treated with an
ticonvulsant drugs, indicating the
possibility of a seizure disorder re
lated problem. Brain tumors have
been reported at patient autopsies. A
majority of significant symptoms of
anorexia nervosa have been dupli
cated in emotionally healthy men
subjected to experimental starva
tion, indicating a lack of clarity bet
ween cause and effect.
As with all chronic illnesses, it is
important to study the psychiatric is
sues involved, but new research in
dicates that critical answers may be
found in a closer examination of the
biological aspects of anorexia ner
vosa.
