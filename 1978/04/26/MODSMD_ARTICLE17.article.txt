## Western Culture panel wants liberal education defined, small-class study 
### 
The ASSU Ad Hoc Panel on Western Culture was created
by the Council of Presidents last fall to stimulate discussion
among students regarding the nature and specific® of the
proposed requirement, to ascertain student opinion of the
requirement, and to pursue the requirement through the
decision-making channels of the University to ensure that
student opinion is well represented "
The membership of the Panel consists of students
directly involved with the development of the requirement
due to committee membership, or office, or who have been
coopted by the Panel because of their expertise on this
issue While the opinions represented are quite diverse,
there are certain common standards and ideals that we all
agree upon
What follows then, is a compendium of the shared ideas
and attitudes held by members of the Panel Furthermore,
the Panel believes student input must play a major role in the
decision making process on this issue, since a Western
culture requirement will dramatically affect the educational
lives of those we try our best to represent—the students who
will follow us as undergraduates at Stanford
Throughout our discussions, a major issue has been what
the focus of this report should be Some suggested that we
emphasize only our opposition to the notion of a Western
culture requirement Others argued that the Faculty Senate
decided the issue when it instructed the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies to propose a mandatory requirement
in Western culture (Dec. 2, 1976). and that now our goal
should be to help make the requirement as good as possible
Recently, however, the Panel has been disturbed by the
budgetary restraints for a Western culture course<s) being
suggested by President Lyman, as well as the questionable
involvement of faculty in teaching it We strongly contend
that no requirement can be endorsed without an adequate
commitment of financial resources and small-group, faculty
instruction
Consequently, we now feel it is necessary to reevaluate
the nature of the requirement and to discuss suggested
formats for the course(s) This report, then, is divided into
four sections: I)Why the requirement? 2) Criticisms of the
preferred model, 3) Problems of the multitrack approach,
and 4) Our recommendations.
Why the Requirement?
1 The potential success of any requirement—regardless
of the topic of study—is questionable because the notion of
compulsion is alienating to many students Furthermore, the
Task Force on Western Culture has recognized that unless
large numbers of students and faculty are enthusiastic about
the requirement, it cannot achieve its objectives. We
seriously doubt that students are enthusiastic about the
notion of an additional requirement in the study of Western
culture.
2 We must question whether the revived study of
Western culture is needed. There has been no statistical
evidence that students are truly ignorant of Western
culture —only anecdotal evidence Students raised and
educated in our society are intrinsically aware of the
traditions of Western culture In essence we do not feel that
an in-depth study of the "great works" warrants a universal
requirement
3. There seems to be no consensus among the faculty
about what the study of Western culture should entail
Should it be intellectual history? Should it be social history?
Or should it be the history of political thought? Without
agreement on this fundamental issue no one can sensibly

propose a requirement in Western culture
4 Most of the proposals for the Western culture
requirement (including all of those under serious con
sideration) focus on "high culture" and "great works". We
believe this approach lends itself to parochialism and ob
scures from view the significant role that other segments or
classes of the social order have played in the development of
Western culture (e.g., national minorities, members of the
Third World, and women in general)
5. We fear that the institution of such a large
requirement, which will literally shift 25% of the student
body into a prescribed course(s), will drain funding away
from existing programs This could mean that upper-division
seminars, SWOPSI, interdepartmental programs, SCIRE,
experimental courses, or any other program might be
sacrificed if no "new" money is allocated for the
requirement
6 We are very concerned about teaching quality. It
seems unlikely that Stanford can guarantee quality in
struction in either seminars or sections (in a lecture format)
for 1,600 students due to simple logistical and financial
constraints.
7. Another concern is what the Western culture
requirement will mean to students whose schedules are
already overloaded with required courses The significant
number of undergraduates in the School of Engineering is
often cited as a group that will be burdened by the
requirement For all students, we seriously question whether
the Western culture requirement is more important to their
development than the academic program they would have
individually chosen For example, is it worthwhile to sacrifice
a quarter overseas or the individualized and in-depth ex
perience of an advanced seminar in order to study Western
culture? Since no one can presume to know what is best for
every individual, we are committed to the student's right to
choose his/her own courses *
Suggestions for the Preferred Model
While we feel the arguments against having a Western
culture requirement are persuasive, we recognize the
possibility that the requirement will nevertheless be in
stituted Consequently, what follows are the Panel's
recommendations for improving the requirement. If there is
to be a requirement, we must be assured not only that it is
educationally sound, but also that it is one of the best
programs Stanford has to offer Given its size and scope,
anything less is not justifiable as a universal or mandatory
requirement.
1. Based on our own experiences, 20 students per
section is too many to achieve the level of intellectual
discussion which both the Task Force and our Panel desire
Consequently, we recommend that the enrollment per
section be dropped from 20 to no more than 15 #
2. Noting the success of the structured liberal education
program, we urge that the seminars be based to
promote aaditional discourse on related topics outside the
classroom.
3. At /easfone-thlrd of the instructors should be regular
faculty members in order to guarantee all students one
faculty-led seminar their first year at Stanford Preferably, a
high proportion of the faculty-led seminars will occur autumn
quarter of each year to provide students with faculty contact
on a personal level from their first day at Stanford.
4. The program should be administered by the dean of
undergraduate studies since it involves students from all

three of the schools which serve undergraduates Also, the
overseeing committee should be a standing subcommittee
of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies and should
include student members appointed by the ASSU
Nominations Committee
Problems with the Multltrack Model
1 One of the reasons for requiring the study of Western
culture was to provide all undergraduates with a common
background in the major historical trends of the West A
multitrack scheme would force students to focus only on
those areas with which their track dealt, thereby eliminating
the potential benefits of a "common intellectual ex
perience."
2. We fear that this model has garnered strong support
from the faculty because of its political appeal While not of
proven educational value, the proposed multitrack schemes
have gained favor due to the decentralization of respon
sibility and authority which would result under them.
Specifically, it seems that department chairpersons, (acuity,
and administration are watching out for their particular
interests and holding tightly to their own priorities, at the
expense of the educational experience of Stanford un
dergraduates
3. With courses of widely varying content and format
being offered to fulfill the requirement, quality control and
comparisons will be difficult Moreover, it seems a track
system would evolve into nothing more than a tightened up
version of the recently abolished humanities sequence
requirement
Recommendations.
1. We suggest that the dean of undergraduate studies
prepare a statement describing the areas of stud> that
comprise a genuinely liberal education A well-considered,
persuasive, and carefully written statement would probably
prompt more students to obtain a historical sense of the past
without unduly restraining the students' right to direct their
own education.
2. We endorse the development of the small-class study
of Western culture proposed by the Task Force as a valuable
addition to the Stanford curriculum. Such an optional course
would have the potential for being a quality offering, capable
of competing successfully in the academic marketplace

The ASSU Ad Hoc Panel on Western Culture was created
by the Council of Presidents last fall to stimulate discussion
among students regarding the nature and specific® of the
proposed requirement, to ascertain student opinion of the
requirement, and to pursue the requirement through the
decision-making channels of the University to ensure that
student opinion is well represented "
The membership of the Panel consists of students
directly involved with the development of the requirement
due to committee membership, or office, or who have been
coopted by the Panel because of their expertise on this
issue While the opinions represented are quite diverse,
there are certain common standards and ideals that we all
agree upon
What follows then, is a compendium of the shared ideas
and attitudes held by members of the Panel Furthermore,
the Panel believes student input must play a major role in the
decision making process on this issue, since a Western
culture requirement will dramatically affect the educational
lives of those we try our best to represent—the students who
will follow us as undergraduates at Stanford
Throughout our discussions, a major issue has been what
the focus of this report should be Some suggested that we
emphasize only our opposition to the notion of a Western
culture requirement Others argued that the Faculty Senate
decided the issue when it instructed the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies to propose a mandatory requirement
in Western culture (Dec. 2, 1976). and that now our goal
should be to help make the requirement as good as possible
Recently, however, the Panel has been disturbed by the
budgetary restraints for a Western culture course<s) being
suggested by President Lyman, as well as the questionable
involvement of faculty in teaching it We strongly contend
that no requirement can be endorsed without an adequate
commitment of financial resources and small-group, faculty
instruction
Consequently, we now feel it is necessary to reevaluate
the nature of the requirement and to discuss suggested
formats for the course(s) This report, then, is divided into
four sections: I)Why the requirement? 2) Criticisms of the
preferred model, 3) Problems of the multitrack approach,
and 4) Our recommendations.
Why the Requirement?
1 The potential success of any requirement—regardless
of the topic of study—is questionable because the notion of
compulsion is alienating to many students Furthermore, the
Task Force on Western Culture has recognized that unless
large numbers of students and faculty are enthusiastic about
the requirement, it cannot achieve its objectives. We
seriously doubt that students are enthusiastic about the
notion of an additional requirement in the study of Western
culture.
2 We must question whether the revived study of
Western culture is needed. There has been no statistical
evidence that students are truly ignorant of Western
culture —only anecdotal evidence Students raised and
educated in our society are intrinsically aware of the
traditions of Western culture In essence we do not feel that
an in-depth study of the "great works" warrants a universal
requirement
3. There seems to be no consensus among the faculty
about what the study of Western culture should entail
Should it be intellectual history? Should it be social history?
Or should it be the history of political thought? Without
agreement on this fundamental issue no one can sensibly

propose a requirement in Western culture
4 Most of the proposals for the Western culture
requirement (including all of those under serious con
sideration) focus on "high culture" and "great works". We
believe this approach lends itself to parochialism and ob
scures from view the significant role that other segments or
classes of the social order have played in the development of
Western culture (e.g., national minorities, members of the
Third World, and women in general)
5. We fear that the institution of such a large
requirement, which will literally shift 25% of the student
body into a prescribed course(s), will drain funding away
from existing programs This could mean that upper-division
seminars, SWOPSI, interdepartmental programs, SCIRE,
experimental courses, or any other program might be
sacrificed if no "new" money is allocated for the
requirement
6 We are very concerned about teaching quality. It
seems unlikely that Stanford can guarantee quality in
struction in either seminars or sections (in a lecture format)
for 1,600 students due to simple logistical and financial
constraints.
7. Another concern is what the Western culture
requirement will mean to students whose schedules are
already overloaded with required courses The significant
number of undergraduates in the School of Engineering is
often cited as a group that will be burdened by the
requirement For all students, we seriously question whether
the Western culture requirement is more important to their
development than the academic program they would have
individually chosen For example, is it worthwhile to sacrifice
a quarter overseas or the individualized and in-depth ex
perience of an advanced seminar in order to study Western
culture? Since no one can presume to know what is best for
every individual, we are committed to the student's right to
choose his/her own courses *
Suggestions for the Preferred Model
While we feel the arguments against having a Western
culture requirement are persuasive, we recognize the
possibility that the requirement will nevertheless be in
stituted Consequently, what follows are the Panel's
recommendations for improving the requirement. If there is
to be a requirement, we must be assured not only that it is
educationally sound, but also that it is one of the best
programs Stanford has to offer Given its size and scope,
anything less is not justifiable as a universal or mandatory
requirement.
1. Based on our own experiences, 20 students per
section is too many to achieve the level of intellectual
discussion which both the Task Force and our Panel desire
Consequently, we recommend that the enrollment per
section be dropped from 20 to no more than 15 #
2. Noting the success of the structured liberal education
program, we urge that the seminars be based to
promote aaditional discourse on related topics outside the
classroom.
3. At /easfone-thlrd of the instructors should be regular
faculty members in order to guarantee all students one
faculty-led seminar their first year at Stanford Preferably, a
high proportion of the faculty-led seminars will occur autumn
quarter of each year to provide students with faculty contact
on a personal level from their first day at Stanford.
4. The program should be administered by the dean of
undergraduate studies since it involves students from all

three of the schools which serve undergraduates Also, the
overseeing committee should be a standing subcommittee
of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies and should
include student members appointed by the ASSU
Nominations Committee
Problems with the Multltrack Model
1 One of the reasons for requiring the study of Western
culture was to provide all undergraduates with a common
background in the major historical trends of the West A
multitrack scheme would force students to focus only on
those areas with which their track dealt, thereby eliminating
the potential benefits of a "common intellectual ex
perience."
2. We fear that this model has garnered strong support
from the faculty because of its political appeal While not of
proven educational value, the proposed multitrack schemes
have gained favor due to the decentralization of respon
sibility and authority which would result under them.
Specifically, it seems that department chairpersons, (acuity,
and administration are watching out for their particular
interests and holding tightly to their own priorities, at the
expense of the educational experience of Stanford un
dergraduates
3. With courses of widely varying content and format
being offered to fulfill the requirement, quality control and
comparisons will be difficult Moreover, it seems a track
system would evolve into nothing more than a tightened up
version of the recently abolished humanities sequence
requirement

Problems with the Multltrack Model
1 One of the reasons for requiring the study of Western
culture was to provide all undergraduates with a common
background in the major historical trends of the West A
multitrack scheme would force students to focus only on
those areas with which their track dealt, thereby eliminating
the potential benefits of a "common intellectual ex
perience."
2. We fear that this model has garnered strong support
from the faculty because of its political appeal While not of
proven educational value, the proposed multitrack schemes
have gained favor due to the decentralization of respon
sibility and authority which would result under them.
Specifically, it seems that department chairpersons, (acuity,
and administration are watching out for their particular
interests and holding tightly to their own priorities, at the
expense of the educational experience of Stanford un
dergraduates
3. With courses of widely varying content and format
being offered to fulfill the requirement, quality control and
comparisons will be difficult Moreover, it seems a track
system would evolve into nothing more than a tightened up
version of the recently abolished humanities sequence
requirement
Recommendations.
1. We suggest that the dean of undergraduate studies
prepare a statement describing the areas of stud> that
comprise a genuinely liberal education A well-considered,
persuasive, and carefully written statement would probably
prompt more students to obtain a historical sense of the past
without unduly restraining the students' right to direct their
own education.
2. We endorse the development of the small-class study
of Western culture proposed by the Task Force as a valuable
addition to the Stanford curriculum. Such an optional course
would have the potential for being a quality offering, capable
of competing successfully in the academic marketplace

The ASSU Ad Hoc Panel on Western Culture was created
by the Council of Presidents last fall to stimulate discussion
among students regarding the nature and specific® of the
proposed requirement, to ascertain student opinion of the
requirement, and to pursue the requirement through the
decision-making channels of the University to ensure that
student opinion is well represented "
The membership of the Panel consists of students
directly involved with the development of the requirement
due to committee membership, or office, or who have been
coopted by the Panel because of their expertise on this
issue While the opinions represented are quite diverse,
there are certain common standards and ideals that we all
agree upon
What follows then, is a compendium of the shared ideas
and attitudes held by members of the Panel Furthermore,
the Panel believes student input must play a major role in the
decision making process on this issue, since a Western
culture requirement will dramatically affect the educational
lives of those we try our best to represent—the students who
will follow us as undergraduates at Stanford
Throughout our discussions, a major issue has been what
the focus of this report should be Some suggested that we
emphasize only our opposition to the notion of a Western
culture requirement Others argued that the Faculty Senate
decided the issue when it instructed the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies to propose a mandatory requirement
in Western culture (Dec. 2, 1976). and that now our goal
should be to help make the requirement as good as possible
Recently, however, the Panel has been disturbed by the
budgetary restraints for a Western culture course<s) being
suggested by President Lyman, as well as the questionable
involvement of faculty in teaching it We strongly contend
that no requirement can be endorsed without an adequate
commitment of financial resources and small-group, faculty
instruction
Consequently, we now feel it is necessary to reevaluate
the nature of the requirement and to discuss suggested
formats for the course(s) This report, then, is divided into
four sections: I)Why the requirement? 2) Criticisms of the
preferred model, 3) Problems of the multitrack approach,
and 4) Our recommendations.
Why the Requirement?
1 The potential success of any requirement—regardless
of the topic of study—is questionable because the notion of
compulsion is alienating to many students Furthermore, the
Task Force on Western Culture has recognized that unless
large numbers of students and faculty are enthusiastic about
the requirement, it cannot achieve its objectives. We
seriously doubt that students are enthusiastic about the
notion of an additional requirement in the study of Western
culture.
2 We must question whether the revived study of
Western culture is needed. There has been no statistical
evidence that students are truly ignorant of Western
culture —only anecdotal evidence Students raised and
educated in our society are intrinsically aware of the
traditions of Western culture In essence we do not feel that
an in-depth study of the "great works" warrants a universal
requirement
3. There seems to be no consensus among the faculty
about what the study of Western culture should entail
Should it be intellectual history? Should it be social history?
Or should it be the history of political thought? Without
agreement on this fundamental issue no one can sensibly

propose a requirement in Western culture
4 Most of the proposals for the Western culture
requirement (including all of those under serious con
sideration) focus on "high culture" and "great works". We
believe this approach lends itself to parochialism and ob
scures from view the significant role that other segments or
classes of the social order have played in the development of
Western culture (e.g., national minorities, members of the
Third World, and women in general)
5. We fear that the institution of such a large
requirement, which will literally shift 25% of the student
body into a prescribed course(s), will drain funding away
from existing programs This could mean that upper-division
seminars, SWOPSI, interdepartmental programs, SCIRE,
experimental courses, or any other program might be
sacrificed if no "new" money is allocated for the
requirement
6 We are very concerned about teaching quality. It
seems unlikely that Stanford can guarantee quality in
struction in either seminars or sections (in a lecture format)
for 1,600 students due to simple logistical and financial
constraints.
7. Another concern is what the Western culture
requirement will mean to students whose schedules are
already overloaded with required courses The significant
number of undergraduates in the School of Engineering is
often cited as a group that will be burdened by the
requirement For all students, we seriously question whether
the Western culture requirement is more important to their
development than the academic program they would have
individually chosen For example, is it worthwhile to sacrifice
a quarter overseas or the individualized and in-depth ex
perience of an advanced seminar in order to study Western
culture? Since no one can presume to know what is best for
every individual, we are committed to the student's right to
choose his/her own courses *
Suggestions for the Preferred Model
While we feel the arguments against having a Western
culture requirement are persuasive, we recognize the
possibility that the requirement will nevertheless be in
stituted Consequently, what follows are the Panel's
recommendations for improving the requirement. If there is
to be a requirement, we must be assured not only that it is
educationally sound, but also that it is one of the best
programs Stanford has to offer Given its size and scope,
anything less is not justifiable as a universal or mandatory
requirement.
1. Based on our own experiences, 20 students per
section is too many to achieve the level of intellectual
discussion which both the Task Force and our Panel desire
Consequently, we recommend that the enrollment per
section be dropped from 20 to no more than 15 #
2. Noting the success of the structured liberal education
program, we urge that the seminars be based to
promote aaditional discourse on related topics outside the
classroom.
3. At /easfone-thlrd of the instructors should be regular
faculty members in order to guarantee all students one
faculty-led seminar their first year at Stanford Preferably, a
high proportion of the faculty-led seminars will occur autumn
quarter of each year to provide students with faculty contact
on a personal level from their first day at Stanford.
4. The program should be administered by the dean of
