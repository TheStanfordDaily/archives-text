# Netters blast Spartans, 7-2
## 
### Jeff Brandon 
Stanford's No. 1 ranked ten
nis team continued to crunch
anyone who wanted to break
their 29 match undefeated
streak. This time the challen
gers were No. 16 ranked San
Jose State, but the Spartans
wound up on the short end of a
7-2 decision.
"San Jose's a very dangerous
team," pointed out Cardinal
coach Dick Could. "As a team
we had a big weekend and it's
very easy to let down. Most
everyone came to play. We did
a very business-like job on a
good team."
Matt Mitchell made the most
out of his first chance to play
No. 1 singles. With John McEn
roe in Las Vegas playing the
Alan King Classic (he is the first
amateur ever to be seeded in
the tournament) and Bill Maze

resting a sore knee, Mitchell
got his shot to play at the top
spot. He faced his old Gunn
High School teammate, Ail-
American Nial Brash. On the
strength of his punishing serve
and volley game and a strong
forehand, Mitchell prevailed,
7-6, 6-1.
The most impressive per
formance of the day was
turned in by John Rast. The
junior from St. Petersburg,
Florida played one of the finest
matches of the year for the
Cards. He needed only 38 mi
nutes to dispose of Matt Iwer
son 6-1, 6-1.
"John played a fine match.
He played good, smart tennis
and never really let Iwerson
into the match. This is really
significant because he did not
play well last Saturday. We'll
need him to play well in the

NCAAs," commented Gould.
Perry Wright earned his third
straight victory and Peter Re
nnert improved his record to
15-2 as both turned in easy
wins. Once again the match
was clinched before the dou
bles as Jim Hodges took
George Mulhern 5-7, 6-4, 6-3
for the fifth point of the day.
In doubles, last year's team
of Rast and Maze teamed up for
old times' sake and handed
Brash and Mulhern a straight
set loss. Rennert and Lloyd
Bourne kept their outside
chance for an NCAA bid by re
maining undefeated with a 6-4,
6-4 win.
Gould is now only two
matches away from his goal: an
undefeated season; some
thing he has never had here at
Stanford. But reaching this
goal will not be easy as the
matches remaining are against
seventh-ranked Cal and ninth
ranked Pepperdine. Cal whip

ped USC 8-1 last week, in Ber
keley.
