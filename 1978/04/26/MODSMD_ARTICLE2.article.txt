# Senate approves special election
## 
### Sara Lessley 
The ASSU Senate last night ap
proved a special election for the
eight fee assessments which failed in
last week's election.
The fee assessments were not vali
dated because fewer than the re
quired 20 per cent of the student
body voted.
However, none of the fee assess
ments was "voted down" according
to Election Commissioner Sean
Murphy. Many simply did not re
ceive the required voter turnout, he
added.
The senate also certified the other
election returns. Two of the COP
slates, Andrew Goldenkranz' and
George Drysdale's will face each
other in the run-off election today
and tomorrow.
A/so facing each other in the run
off election are the senior class pres
ident slates of Amy Breck and Jeff
Wachtel.
According to the official election
results announced by Murphy, three
of the fee assessments did pass.
With the inclusion of the overseas
ballots, the Band, KZSU and the Daily
all received enough votes.
The Daily reported last week that
these three fee assessments had pas
sed on the basis of Assoc. Registrar
Robert Houghton's estimate placing
the total number of registered stu

dents at 11,225.
According to Murphy, this figure
did not include the more than 600
post doctoral students, and more
than 100 "pipeline" students.
"Pipeline" refers to the students who
are still being processed for registra
tion, Murphy added.
Murphy said the adjusted figure of
total registered students is actually
11,920. This means for an organiza
tion's fee assessment to pass, 2384

students would have to vote on the
measure, with a majority voting yes.
The Daily received 2392 votes, KZSU
2395 and the Band received 2394.
The remaining eight fee assess
ments failed due to low voter turn
out.
There was some discussion con
cerning the Constitutional interpre
tation used to allow a special elec
tion.
According to Senate Chairperson

Fred Grethel, fee assessments can
not be put on the ballot in the same
quarter in which they are defeated.
However, the assessments were
not defeated, Grethel said since all
were approved by a majority of those
voting. The assessments were not
certified simply because of the lack
of voters.
Sen. Meriel Burtle said the situa
tion was similar to voting and passing
a proposal without a quorum.
Not on today's ballot
Grethel added that the fee assess
ments could not be placed on today's
run-off election ballot. The ASSU
Constitution requires that 14 days
notice be given before the measures
appear on a ballot.
Sen. Tom McCormack said he was
"amazingly discouraged" that so few
students voted. He said he objected
to "trying again" when the measures
had already failed once.
Grethel said he urged the senate to
put the proposals back on a special ,
election ballot to give the assess
ments "another chance."
Grethel added that most of the
groups seeking fee assessments
would have difficulty finding funding
sources. University funding, one po
tential source, is "tight" according to
Grethel.
To place fee assessments on a bal
lot, three-fifths of the senators must
voteyes. Taking the assessments one
at a time, the first failed with an
abstention from Sen. Al Miner and a
nay vote from Sen. Rob Docters.
Change votes
However, senate reaction and the
"hostility" caused both senators to
change their votes. Their votes were
crucial, with only 12 members pre
sent.
The fee assessments were recon
sidered together, then passed.
The special election will be held
May 10 and 11. All groups seeking the
assessment will pay for the election,
the cost of which is expected to total
$600 to $700, according to Grethel.
The eight fee assessments to be
listed on the special election ballot
are Stanford Committee for Political
Education (SCOPE), Guest Profes
sorship Board, Publications Board,
Academic Organizations Board,
Speakers Bureau, Legal Counseling
Office, the ASSU Program Fee and
the Graduate Students Organization.

Constitution requires that 14 days
notice be given before the measures
appear on a ballot.
Sen. Tom McCormack said he was
"amazingly discouraged" that so few
students voted. He said he objected
to "trying again" when the measures
had already failed once.
Grethel said he urged the senate to
put the proposals back on a special ,
election ballot to give the assess
ments "another chance."
Grethel added that most of the
groups seeking fee assessments
would have difficulty finding funding
sources. University funding, one po
tential source, is "tight" according to
Grethel.
To place fee assessments on a bal
lot, three-fifths of the senators must
voteyes. Taking the assessments one
at a time, the first failed with an
abstention from Sen. Al Miner and a
nay vote from Sen. Rob Docters.
Change votes
However, senate reaction and the
"hostility" caused both senators to
change their votes. Their votes were
crucial, with only 12 members pre
sent.
The fee assessments were recon
sidered together, then passed.
The special election will be held
May 10 and 11. All groups seeking the
assessment will pay for the election,
the cost of which is expected to total
$600 to $700, according to Grethel.
The eight fee assessments to be
listed on the special election ballot
are Stanford Committee for Political
Education (SCOPE), Guest Profes
sorship Board, Publications Board,
Academic Organizations Board,
Speakers Bureau, Legal Counseling
Office, the ASSU Program Fee and
the Graduate Students Organization.
The ASSU Senate last night ap
proved a special election for the
eight fee assessments which failed in
last week's election.
The fee assessments were not vali
dated because fewer than the re
quired 20 per cent of the student
body voted.
However, none of the fee assess
ments was "voted down" according
to Election Commissioner Sean
Murphy. Many simply did not re
ceive the required voter turnout, he
added.
The senate also certified the other
election returns. Two of the COP
slates, Andrew Goldenkranz' and
George Drysdale's will face each
other in the run-off election today
and tomorrow.
A/so facing each other in the run
off election are the senior class pres
ident slates of Amy Breck and Jeff
Wachtel.
According to the official election
results announced by Murphy, three
of the fee assessments did pass.
With the inclusion of the overseas
ballots, the Band, KZSU and the Daily
all received enough votes.
The Daily reported last week that
these three fee assessments had pas
sed on the basis of Assoc. Registrar
Robert Houghton's estimate placing
the total number of registered stu

dents at 11,225.
According to Murphy, this figure
did not include the more than 600
post doctoral students, and more
than 100 "pipeline" students.
"Pipeline" refers to the students who
are still being processed for registra
tion, Murphy added.
Murphy said the adjusted figure of
total registered students is actually
11,920. This means for an organiza
tion's fee assessment to pass, 2384

students would have to vote on the
measure, with a majority voting yes.
The Daily received 2392 votes, KZSU
2395 and the Band received 2394.
The remaining eight fee assess
ments failed due to low voter turn
out.
There was some discussion con
cerning the Constitutional interpre
tation used to allow a special elec
tion.
According to Senate Chairperson

Fred Grethel, fee assessments can
not be put on the ballot in the same
quarter in which they are defeated.
However, the assessments were
not defeated, Grethel said since all
were approved by a majority of those
voting. The assessments were not
certified simply because of the lack
of voters.
Sen. Meriel Burtle said the situa
tion was similar to voting and passing
a proposal without a quorum.
Not on today's ballot
Grethel added that the fee assess
ments could not be placed on today's
run-off election ballot. The ASSU
Constitution requires that 14 days
notice be given before the measures
