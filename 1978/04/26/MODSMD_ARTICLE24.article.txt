# S.J. State dumps Card nine

It appears that the Stanford baseball team has
run out of pitching.
Four Stanford pitchers spent time on the
mound yesterday afternoon in an effort to con
tain the San Jose State Spartans and regain their
confidence, but despite their effort, the Spar
tans walked away with a 9-4 victory.
After the Cardinal pitchers' less than en
couraging experience with Cal this past
weekend, it was hoped that they could go back
to their winning ways of the pre-season in yes
terday's low pressure game. The non
conference loss marks their seventh loss against
only six wins since league play began, and
brings their overall record to 29-13-2.
Bruce Fiala absorbed the loss for the Cardinals
as he took the mound in the seventh inning with
a 4-3 lead that he was unable to maintain. The
loss was only Fiala's second against six wins and
three saves this year. Larry Kuhn started the
game, going two innings for the Cards before
Rob Irwin took over in the third. Irwin gave way
to Brian Harrison in the fifth.
"It was just a matter of throwing the ball over
the plate," said Fiala. "But the ball started hang
ingand they hit it hard. The first one they hit out
wasafastball; the second was a hanging curve."
Pitching once again was a critical factor that
worked against the Cards, but it was by no
means the only factor. The Cardinals' offensive
attack left something to be desired and left a lot
of men on base. Stanford collected seven hits in
'he contest and left 10 men stranded.
San lose starter Jim Berglund, who went the
distance for the Spartans, successfully con
lained all but a few of the batters in the Cardinal
lineup. Mike Codiroli, junior rightfielder, went
three-for-five at the plate including two doubles
and two RBI. Stanford's other two RBI went to

none other than Tom Cuardino, probably the
most consistent batter on the Stanford team this
year.
With Stanford leading 4-3 and two men down
in the top of the eighth, San Jose State catcher
Rick Lane connected with Fiala's fastball and
gave it a ride over the left field fence.
In.the ninth, San Jose State had a man on
second — again with two men down. Fiala inten
tionally walked the next Spartan to set up the
force play and was ahead of what he hoped
would be the last batter of the inning. His 0-2
pitch, however, was looped into short center
field, scoring one run.
Another run scored when the next batter sing
led into right, and shortstop Randy Johnson
cleared the bases with a three-run homer over
the soccer field fence in left. Stanford went
down quietly in the bottom of the ninth.

the few bright spots for the Cards yesterday in a 9-4 loss to the Spartans.
