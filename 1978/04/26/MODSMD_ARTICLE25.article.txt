The junior varsity baseball team split a league
doubleheader with the San Jose State JV's Mon
day afternoon in San Jose. The Cards brought
their record to 9-4 in conference play by taking
the first game 13-1 and getting shut out in the
second 5-0.
Tim Sherrell picked up the win in the first
game of the twin bill, aided by the 17 hits
pounded out by the Stanford batters. Bob
Boatman pitched well for the first five innings of
the second contest, according to coach Bruce
Davis, but got tired in the sixth and allowed San
Jose's 1-0 lead to expand to 5-0.
