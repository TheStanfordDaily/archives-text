# Jordans lead Cards past Cal
## 
### Karen O'Leary 
The last time the Stanford women's ten
nis team met California they were minus
two top players, yet coasted to a 7-1 vic
tory. Yesterday only Susie Hagey was mis
sing from the Card squad, and the results
were predictable. Stanford easily took the
match, 6-3, boosting their season record
to 16-1.
The win over Cal ended this year's con
ference play for the Cards, who have now
clinched the Northern California Athletic
Conference team title, with a record of 5-0.
The individual league titles will be deter
mined at the Nor-Cal tournament on May 6
and 7.
Playing in the No. 1 singles position,
Barbara Jordan defeated Beth Fernbacher
in three sets, 6-1, 6-7, 6-3. Fernbacher is a
nationally ranked junior, and gave Jordan

quite a fight in the second set. "She played
better than I expected, and was especially
tough towards the end," said Jordan.
In the No. 2 singles position, Diane Mor
rison gave up only one game, to crush
Mallory Lynch, 6-1, 6-0. Freshman Donna
Rubin defeated Kim Greenhouse 6-2, 6-4,
taking full advantage of her opponent's
lack of concentration. "She wasn't really
into the match, so I just sat back and took it
shot by shot, waiting for her to make the
mistakes," explained Rubin.
In discussing the win, Stanford coach
Anne Gould commented on the youth of
the California team. "They're really a good
team," said Gould, "and will give us the
most competition in the Nor-Cal tourna
ment next week. Five of their top six
players are in their first year of play with
Berkeley, so I look for them to improve in

the next few seasons."
Gould gave many of her older players a
rest in the doubles action yesterday, as
Freshmen Kathy Jordan and Donna Rubin
took the No. 1 match against the team of
Lynch and Fernbacher. The Cards lost the
No. 2 and No. 3 doubles matches though.
Thompson and Kemp lost in three sets to
Baughman and Michelle Benjamin, 0-6,
6-4, 4-6. Freshmen Wendy Richardson and
Corinne Nevinny were defeated 3-6,4-6 by
Reed and Sally Barry.

The last time the Stanford women's ten
nis team met California they were minus
two top players, yet coasted to a 7-1 vic
tory. Yesterday only Susie Hagey was mis
sing from the Card squad, and the results
were predictable. Stanford easily took the
match, 6-3, boosting their season record
to 16-1.
The win over Cal ended this year's con
ference play for the Cards, who have now
clinched the Northern California Athletic
Conference team title, with a record of 5-0.
The individual league titles will be deter
mined at the Nor-Cal tournament on May 6
and 7.
Playing in the No. 1 singles position,
Barbara Jordan defeated Beth Fernbacher
in three sets, 6-1, 6-7, 6-3. Fernbacher is a
nationally ranked junior, and gave Jordan

quite a fight in the second set. "She played
better than I expected, and was especially
tough towards the end," said Jordan.
In the No. 2 singles position, Diane Mor
rison gave up only one game, to crush
Mallory Lynch, 6-1, 6-0. Freshman Donna
Rubin defeated Kim Greenhouse 6-2, 6-4,
taking full advantage of her opponent's
lack of concentration. "She wasn't really
into the match, so I just sat back and took it
shot by shot, waiting for her to make the
mistakes," explained Rubin.
In discussing the win, Stanford coach
Anne Gould commented on the youth of
the California team. "They're really a good
team," said Gould, "and will give us the
most competition in the Nor-Cal tourna
ment next week. Five of their top six
players are in their first year of play with
Berkeley, so I look for them to improve in

the next few seasons."
Gould gave many of her older players a
rest in the doubles action yesterday, as
Freshmen Kathy Jordan and Donna Rubin
took the No. 1 match against the team of
Lynch and Fernbacher. The Cards lost the
No. 2 and No. 3 doubles matches though.
Thompson and Kemp lost in three sets to
Baughman and Michelle Benjamin, 0-6,
6-4, 4-6. Freshmen Wendy Richardson and
Corinne Nevinny were defeated 3-6,4-6 by
Reed and Sally Barry.
