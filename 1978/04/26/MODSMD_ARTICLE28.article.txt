Zodiac killer reappears in S.F.
San Francisco — Zodiac, the boastful slayer who has
taunted police for nearly a decade, has surfaced for the
first time in more than four years, police confirmed
yesterday.
Blamed for six murders by police and claiming more
than three dozen, Zodiac sent a letter to the San Fran
cisco Chronicle proclaiming, "I am back with you."
The message claimed no new victims and made no
threats. It was postmarked Monday in San Francisco and
hand-printed in Zodiac's familiar style with a blue felt
tipped pen.
Police said they were satisfied the letter was authentic,
although they were submitting it for additional checks
by experts.
The lefter was addressed simply, "Dear Editor," and
started with the traditional salutation, "This is the Zodiac
speaking."
"It has been a long four years," said police homicide
inspector David Toschi, who has been in charge of the
case since 1969.
"I have always felt that he was alive and out there
somewhere," Toschi added. "I still don't know where he
is, butat least now I knowthat all ourworkall theseyears
definitely has not been in vain."
Carter pushes tax reduction plan
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, faced with op
position from within his own party, pleaded anew yes
terday for passage of his tax cut, saying failure to do so
would cost each American family $600 and swell un
employment rolls by another one million people.
Carter insisted that his proposal for a net income tax
reduction of $25 billion in the new fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1 would not fuel inflation, a specter raised by con
gressional Democrats who are seeking a smaller cut.
In a nationally televised news conference Carter also:
— Delivered an emotional defense of his proposals for
revising the laws governing the collection of taxes from
U.S. citizens.
— Rejected Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev's offer
to forego production of a Russian neutron bomb if the
United States will do likewise. Carter said the idea was
"of no significance" because the weapon would be of no
use to the Soviets anyway.
— Repeated his insistence that Congress approve the
all-or-nothing, package sale of U.S. warplanes to Egypt
and Saudi Arabia as well as to Israel.
U.S. Attorney wants Hearst in jail
San Francisco — Patricia Hearst, who lost an appeal for
Supreme Court intervention in her bank robbery convic
tion, should return to prison while defense attorneys
attempt to have her seven-year sentence reduced, U.S.
Attorney William Hunter said yesterday.
"She has an obligation to do her time. . .and it will be
better for her if she starts now," Hunter said in an inter
view.
He said the official notification of the court's Monday
ruling, refusing to grant a hearing on her 1976 convic
tion, will arrive in San Francisco about May 8, and that is
when she should go back behind bars.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Davis, who will handle
the case, said he will oppose defense plans to ask for a
reduction in the 24-year-old newspaper heiress' seven
year prison sentence.
The high court's ruling sharply limits legal avenues
available to keep Hearst out of prison for the additional
14 months required before she would be eligible for
parole. She was confined for 14 months before being
freed on $1 million bail pending appeal.
Namibia may get independence
Cape Town, South Africa — Prime Minister John Vors
ter said yesterday his government has accepted Western
compromise proposals to prepare South-West Africa for
internationally recognized independence.
His announcement in parliament could clear the way
for universal suffrage elections in the territory of 99,000
whites and 722,000 blacks, administered by South Africa.
South-West Africa could become independent as
Namibia, its African name, by the end of the year.
Sam Nujoma of the South-West Africa People's Or
ganization, leader of the opposition to South African
administration, declined comment at the United Na
tions in New York when he heard of Vorster's statement.
Leone denounces Moro kidnappers
Rome — As Italy awaited word of Aldo Moro's fate,
President Giovanni Leone said yesterday that the nation
faced a "wicked and bloody danger" from the Red
Brigades terrorists who kidnapped the former premier.
A flurry of telephone calls announcing that Moro had
been killed was received by the Italian news agency
ANSA, but it said all proved to be hoaxes.
"There is nothing new," said Premier Ciulio An
dreotti, hours after the government rebuffed the Red
Brigades' demand to free 13 imprisoned terrorists in
exchange for Moro's life.
Andreotti and other leaders of the ruling Christian
Democratic Party huddled at headquarters in downtown
Rome to follow developments in the case of their 61-
year-old party president, kidnapped March 16.
Dow Jones gains amidst activity
New York — A morning surge of buying carried the
stock market to another gain yesterday in the second
busiest session in New York Stock Exchange history.
But U.S. Steel's report of a $58.7 million first-quarter
loss took the edge off the advance late in the session,
leaving prices well below their peak levels of the day.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than
14 points at its mid-day peak, finished with a 7.53 gain at
833.59.

Leone denounces Moro kidnappers
Rome — As Italy awaited word of Aldo Moro's fate,
President Giovanni Leone said yesterday that the nation
faced a "wicked and bloody danger" from the Red
Brigades terrorists who kidnapped the former premier.
A flurry of telephone calls announcing that Moro had
been killed was received by the Italian news agency
ANSA, but it said all proved to be hoaxes.
"There is nothing new," said Premier Ciulio An
dreotti, hours after the government rebuffed the Red
Brigades' demand to free 13 imprisoned terrorists in
exchange for Moro's life.
Andreotti and other leaders of the ruling Christian
Democratic Party huddled at headquarters in downtown
Rome to follow developments in the case of their 61-
year-old party president, kidnapped March 16.
Dow Jones gains amidst activity
New York — A morning surge of buying carried the
stock market to another gain yesterday in the second
busiest session in New York Stock Exchange history.
But U.S. Steel's report of a $58.7 million first-quarter
loss took the edge off the advance late in the session,
leaving prices well below their peak levels of the day.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than
14 points at its mid-day peak, finished with a 7.53 gain at
833.59.

Zodiac killer reappears in S.F.
San Francisco — Zodiac, the boastful slayer who has
taunted police for nearly a decade, has surfaced for the
first time in more than four years, police confirmed
yesterday.
Blamed for six murders by police and claiming more
than three dozen, Zodiac sent a letter to the San Fran
cisco Chronicle proclaiming, "I am back with you."
The message claimed no new victims and made no
threats. It was postmarked Monday in San Francisco and
hand-printed in Zodiac's familiar style with a blue felt
tipped pen.
Police said they were satisfied the letter was authentic,
although they were submitting it for additional checks
by experts.
The lefter was addressed simply, "Dear Editor," and
started with the traditional salutation, "This is the Zodiac
speaking."
"It has been a long four years," said police homicide
inspector David Toschi, who has been in charge of the
case since 1969.
"I have always felt that he was alive and out there
somewhere," Toschi added. "I still don't know where he
is, butat least now I knowthat all ourworkall theseyears
definitely has not been in vain."
Carter pushes tax reduction plan
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, faced with op
position from within his own party, pleaded anew yes
terday for passage of his tax cut, saying failure to do so
would cost each American family $600 and swell un
employment rolls by another one million people.
Carter insisted that his proposal for a net income tax
reduction of $25 billion in the new fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1 would not fuel inflation, a specter raised by con
gressional Democrats who are seeking a smaller cut.
In a nationally televised news conference Carter also:
— Delivered an emotional defense of his proposals for
revising the laws governing the collection of taxes from
U.S. citizens.
— Rejected Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev's offer
to forego production of a Russian neutron bomb if the
United States will do likewise. Carter said the idea was
"of no significance" because the weapon would be of no
use to the Soviets anyway.
— Repeated his insistence that Congress approve the
all-or-nothing, package sale of U.S. warplanes to Egypt
and Saudi Arabia as well as to Israel.
U.S. Attorney wants Hearst in jail
San Francisco — Patricia Hearst, who lost an appeal for
Supreme Court intervention in her bank robbery convic
tion, should return to prison while defense attorneys
attempt to have her seven-year sentence reduced, U.S.
Attorney William Hunter said yesterday.
"She has an obligation to do her time. . .and it will be
better for her if she starts now," Hunter said in an inter
view.
He said the official notification of the court's Monday
ruling, refusing to grant a hearing on her 1976 convic
tion, will arrive in San Francisco about May 8, and that is
when she should go back behind bars.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Davis, who will handle
the case, said he will oppose defense plans to ask for a
reduction in the 24-year-old newspaper heiress' seven
year prison sentence.
The high court's ruling sharply limits legal avenues
available to keep Hearst out of prison for the additional
14 months required before she would be eligible for
parole. She was confined for 14 months before being
freed on $1 million bail pending appeal.
Namibia may get independence
Cape Town, South Africa — Prime Minister John Vors

compromise proposals to prepare South-West Africa for
internationally recognized independence.
His announcement in parliament could clear the way

whites and 722,000 blacks, administered by South Africa.
South-West Africa could become independent as
Namibia, its African name, by the end of the year.
