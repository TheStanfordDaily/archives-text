"It is unthinkable to involve
American military support directly in
Africa," Philip Habib, former under
secretary of state for political affairs,
said yesterday during a luncheon
speech here.
Habib spoke to a capacity crowd at
Bechtel International Center.
The "official" U.S. attitude to
wards Africa has changed from
aloofness to a "definite turn toward
Africa in an unprecedented way,"
Habib said. The new official attitude
includes a "close and deeply in
volved sense of commitment,"
Habib continued.
Many questions caused by the
complexity of the African problems
must remain unanswered. "Where is
the line drawn between mediation
and interference?" he asked.
"Your government, our govern
ment" supports "multi-lateral inter
vention," Habib said. This plan in
cludes United States mediation be
cause American foreign policy is un
iquely acceptable to both sides.

America is interested in "promoting
majority rule, human rights and the
full participation of all elements of
the society in political life,"
explained Habib.
Multi-lateral intervention also rec
ognizes United Nations' compe
tence in Africa The American gov
ernment would comply with United
Nations if U.N. troops were sent to
Africa for "promotion of indepen
dence and majority rule," Habib ad
ded.
In addition to the policy of multi
lateral intervention, the United
States "looks to Africa to resolve Af
rican problems. Peace in Africa de
pends on Africans' solutions to the
African problems," said Habib.
Responding to a question regard
ing Cuban and Russian intervention
in Africa, Habib described American
policy as seeing the need for dip
lomatic activity before an outside
military intervenes. "The answer to
Cuban troops is not to answer fire
with fire," Habib said.

The United States officially "re
jects and abhors apartheid," said
Habib. "There is no question of
American policy in South Africa.
"Sooner or later, the problem of
racism will have to be settled by a
dialog between black and white Afri
cans," not by apartheid or separa
tion, Habib said. "The longer this
dialog is postponed, the more dif
ficult it will beto achieve," he added.
Habib said he feels divestment of
American corporations in Africa is
not the answer. The U.S. govern
ment has not taken an official stand
on the issue, but feels instead there
are more important problems in Af
rica that need to be addressed, he
said.
The United States is concerned
with the more "central" questions of
individual rights, cooperation bet
ween whites and blacks and African
peace within Africa, according to
Habib. "This peace is crucial to us, to
the world." Africa is potentially exp
losive, he said.
