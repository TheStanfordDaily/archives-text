# Zeta Psi placed on probation
## 
### Bill Burger 
Director of Residential Education Norm Robinson
notified the Zeta Psi fraternity yesterday that the house
has been put on probation for up to one year because of
initiation-week activities in January.
A 200 hour "work fine" was also assessed against the
house.
The decision by Robinson followed the recommenda
tion of the six-person Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) ar
bitration board which reviewed the cast last quarter.
The activities in question involve a wheelchair being
taken from Cowell Student Health Center and a frater
nity member "streaking" through Meyer Under
graduate Library.
IFC President Reid Butler said he felt the decision was
"fair" and the process "showed the community we (the
IFC) can police ourselves." Butler also said Robinson's
decision to follow the arbitration board's recommenda
tion "shows the University is willing to listen to what the
fraternities say about themselves."
Robinson said under probation, "any act similar to

what got them (the Zetes) onto probation would result in
having their housing revoked."
Zete President Jim Dodd said the decision gives the
Zetes "every chance in the world to redeem ourselves."
According to Dodd, the probation will be reviewed by
Robinson at the end of Autumn quarter 1978. The proba
tion may then be lifted at anytime thereafter by Robin
son's decision.
Butler said he did not consider streaking "outrageous
behavior" but the Cowell incident warranted "much
more serious consideration."
"No problems were caused by the action at Cowell,"
he said. "A potential for serious harm" did exist though
since Cowell is a health center.
Butler called the work fine "a natural." The 200 hours
equal four hours of work per person for the 50 person
house. Butler said taking an afternoon to do the Univer
sity service work would bea"meaningful" punishment.
Robinson said the work would be coordinated
through the Row Office.
