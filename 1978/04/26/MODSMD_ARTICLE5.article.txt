# Student loan payments enforced

A recent crackdown on student
loan delinquencies here is paying
off, according to Joseph Jedd, man
ager of student accounting. Delin
quencies on National Direct Student
Loans (NDSL) have declined 2.5 per
cent this year.
From 1972 to 1976 the rate of failure
to pay back NDSL loans rose to 10.5
per cent, exceeding limits prescribed
by the Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare. During thatperiod,
Jedd had only one person involved in
collecting loans.
"When we exceeded the NDSL 10
per cent limit, we had to supply an
alternative method for collecting de
linquent accounts," Jedd said. "An
internal study of 3000 delinquent ac
counts was made to pinpoint the
problem, and it was recommended
that we employ more people in the
area of collections."
Four additional people con
sequently joined the loan-collection
staff last year and formed an official
student loan collection section.
Since then, the rate of delinquencies
"has seen a dramatic decline," Jedd

said.
Only one-third of the 3300 institu
tions in the NDSL program have de
fault rates under 10 per cent, accord
ing to a U.S. Office of Education re
port published in "Higher Education
Daily." The national default rate is 18
percent, with more than 500 colleges
reporting default rates higher than 30
per cent.
One way in which students escape
paying back loans is by declaring
bankruptcy immediately after gradu
ation, according to Jedd.
"We hope it's now about to stop,"
he said. There has been talk of a new
federal law preventing students from
declaring bankruptcy in their first
five years after graduation, he added.
Jedd feels it constitutes an "abuse
of the law" for a student to declare
bankruptcy immediately after gradu
ation and then promptly go into a
profession paying more than $25,000
a year.
"I am sympathetic with the person
who tries to pay back the loan for a
few years but is eventually forced to
declare bankruptcy," Jedd said.
"However, I feel that a distinction

should be made between ban
kruptcy declared one month after
graduation and one declared several
years after graduation."
)edd said the University is different
from traditional lending institutions
such as banks. "We lend to those
who prove that they really need the
money, in contrast to the bank who
only lends to those who don't need
it," said |edd.
A second difference between the
University and lending institutions is
"we consider a person's ability to
repay and we issue six month defer
ments to those who cannot payforas
long as they want.
The University issues more than $4
million in loans annually but collects
only about $2.8 million a year from
previous borrowers, Jedd said. Loan
funds total about $24 million, of
which the government provides
$12.4 million while banks provide
$3.4 million. The rest comes from
private donors and University funds.
"Some of the money loaned will be
repaid much later than scheduled,"
said Jedd, "and some will never be
recovered."
