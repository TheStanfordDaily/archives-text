# Trustees reject three CIR proxy recommendations
## 
### Randy Keith 
Rejecting a recommendation
made by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR), the Board
of Trustees has voted against a proxy
resolution which called for with
drawal of Texaco's investments in
South Africa.
The trustees also rejected two
other CIR recommendations on
proxy votes, but accepted the com
mission's recommendations on two
others.
In its report to the trustees' ad hoc
subcommittee on investment re
sponsibility, the CIR had said previ
ously the board should vote for
withdrawal because the "actual ef
fect of its (Texaco's) presence in
South Africa and the use of its pro
ducts there is to reinforce the repres
sive capacity of the minority re
gime."
It was the first recommendation by
the CIR to vote in favor of a proxy for

withdrawal.
"I'm disappointed with the trus
tees' decision," said Frederick Hill
ier, chairman of CIR, "particularly so
since the Texaco recommendation
was a unanimous decision" by the
CIR.
"The members of the subcommit
tee are at the point where they be
lieve we should not withdraw except
in circumstances where we have evi
dence the company has been a nega
tive force and not progressive," ac
cording to Susan Prager, one of the
trustees on the ad hoc subcommittee
on investment responsibility.
She explained if an American
company in South Africa is "perfectly
content with segregationist policies
and has discriminatory wages and
segregated facilities for work," then
there would bean indication that the
company is a negative force.
"In a way I suppose it's a tactical
judgment," she added. "Atthispoint
anyway, the subcommittee is think
ing very differently than the CIR."
In a statement last night the Stan
ford Committee for a Responsible
Investment Policy said the trustees'
vote "shows that the trustees are not
interested in the opinions of the
community or the unanimous re
commendation of the CIR when it
conflicts with their interests.
" 'Reasoned'debate has proven to
be a dead end. . .(and). . .by refus
ing to cast a dissenting vote, trustee

Lyman failed in his duty as president
to reflect the determination of the
community," the statement said.
"A visible demonstration of com
munity outrage is necessary," the
statement added. SCRIP plans a rally
Monday at noon in White Plaza and a
meeting Thursday night according to
the statement.
Hillier explained that he and other
members of CIR had "intensively
studied the South Africa issue" and
had found "this was truly an extraor
dinary situation where 'business as
usual' is no longer a tolerable alter
native."
He said "at the outset the com
monly heard argument that business
should stay and be a progressive
force was an appealing one. But the
more we studied the issues the
weaker this argument became."
Hillier added trustees had not had
the chance to study the South Africa
investments issue as carefully as the
CI R, and "therefore I can understand
why the present thinking of many of
them corresponds to where many of
us began."
Trustees also rejected two other
CIR recommendations:
— That they vote in favor of a
resolution which called on Texaco to
investigate and report allegations
that the company sells oil to
Rhodesia in violation of a United Na
tions embargo, and;
— That trustees abstain on a resol
ution which would halt Eastman
Kodak sales to South Africa.
Trustees decided to oppose both
shareholder resolutions and said
they would instead send letters to
the management of both companies.
In a letter to Texaco trustees call
for the firm to "take steps to publish
information" on the allegations that
it is selling oil to Rhodesia "to the
extent consistent with pending and
possible legal action."

Trustees will send a letter to Kodak
"expressing opposition to sales to
the South African government when
used for repressive purposes."
In other proxy vote action the
Board accepted CIR recommenda
tions to:
— Abstain on an IBM shareholder
resolution which would halt compu
ter sales to Argentina, Brazil, Chile
and Uruguay.
— Abstain on a Bank of America
resolution which called for a
moratorium on loans to Chile. The

resolution failed to pass at the corpo
ration's annual meeting yesterday.
"Neither the company nor the
(shareholder) advocate provided
enough information to make a strong
case either way," the'trustees said
regarding the IBM case.
In the case of Bank of America
loans to Chile, trustees said they
would send a letter "urging that spe
cial attention be given to assessing
the probable social impact of any
proposed loans to Chile's govern
ment."

proposed loans to Chile's govern
ment."
Rejecting a recommendation
made by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR), the Board
of Trustees has voted against a proxy
resolution which called for with
drawal of Texaco's investments in
South Africa.
The trustees also rejected two
other CIR recommendations on
proxy votes, but accepted the com
mission's recommendations on two
others.
In its report to the trustees' ad hoc
subcommittee on investment re
sponsibility, the CIR had said previ
ously the board should vote for
withdrawal because the "actual ef
fect of its (Texaco's) presence in
South Africa and the use of its pro
ducts there is to reinforce the repres
sive capacity of the minority re
gime."
It was the first recommendation by
the CIR to vote in favor of a proxy for

withdrawal.
"I'm disappointed with the trus
tees' decision," said Frederick Hill
ier, chairman of CIR, "particularly so
since the Texaco recommendation
was a unanimous decision" by the
CIR.
"The members of the subcommit
tee are at the point where they be
lieve we should not withdraw except
in circumstances where we have evi
dence the company has been a nega
tive force and not progressive," ac
cording to Susan Prager, one of the
trustees on the ad hoc subcommittee
on investment responsibility.
She explained if an American
company in South Africa is "perfectly
content with segregationist policies
and has discriminatory wages and
segregated facilities for work," then
there would bean indication that the
company is a negative force.
"In a way I suppose it's a tactical
judgment," she added. "Atthispoint
anyway, the subcommittee is think
ing very differently than the CIR."
In a statement last night the Stan
ford Committee for a Responsible
Investment Policy said the trustees'
vote "shows that the trustees are not
interested in the opinions of the
community or the unanimous re
commendation of the CIR when it
conflicts with their interests.
" 'Reasoned'debate has proven to
be a dead end. . .(and). . .by refus
ing to cast a dissenting vote, trustee

Lyman failed in his duty as president
to reflect the determination of the
community," the statement said.
"A visible demonstration of com
munity outrage is necessary," the
statement added. SCRIP plans a rally
Monday at noon in White Plaza and a
meeting Thursday night according to
the statement.
Hillier explained that he and other
members of CIR had "intensively
studied the South Africa issue" and
had found "this was truly an extraor
dinary situation where 'business as
usual' is no longer a tolerable alter
native."
He said "at the outset the com
monly heard argument that business
should stay and be a progressive
force was an appealing one. But the
more we studied the issues the
weaker this argument became."
Hillier added trustees had not had
the chance to study the South Africa
investments issue as carefully as the
CI R, and "therefore I can understand
why the present thinking of many of
them corresponds to where many of
us began."
Trustees also rejected two other
CIR recommendations:
— That they vote in favor of a
resolution which called on Texaco to
investigate and report allegations
that the company sells oil to
Rhodesia in violation of a United Na
tions embargo, and;
— That trustees abstain on a resol
ution which would halt Eastman
Kodak sales to South Africa.
Trustees decided to oppose both
shareholder resolutions and said
they would instead send letters to
the management of both companies.
In a letter to Texaco trustees call
for the firm to "take steps to publish
information" on the allegations that
it is selling oil to Rhodesia "to the
extent consistent with pending and
possible legal action."

Trustees will send a letter to Kodak
"expressing opposition to sales to
the South African government when
used for repressive purposes."
In other proxy vote action the
Board accepted CIR recommenda
tions to:
— Abstain on an IBM shareholder
resolution which would halt compu
ter sales to Argentina, Brazil, Chile
and Uruguay.
— Abstain on a Bank of America
resolution which called for a
moratorium on loans to Chile. The

resolution failed to pass at the corpo
ration's annual meeting yesterday.
"Neither the company nor the
(shareholder) advocate provided
enough information to make a strong
case either way," the'trustees said
regarding the IBM case.
In the case of Bank of America
loans to Chile, trustees said they
would send a letter "urging that spe
cial attention be given to assessing
the probable social impact of any
proposed loans to Chile's govern
ment."
