# Lyman defends trustee vote
## 
### Rob Lempert 
Though he acknowledged he was
"de-dramatizing" the problem, Pres
ident Richard Lyman last night
termed the Board of Trustees deci
sion to vote against the recommen
dations of the Stanford Committee
on Investment (CIR) as a "difference
in emphasis."
Lyman was a guest speaker on
KZSU's Campus Conference.
Lyman said he agreed with trustee
opposition to shareholders' propos
als calling for withdrawal of Texaco
from South Africa and for an investi
gation and report on alleged oil sales
to Rhodesia.
The CIR earlier recommended a
yes vote on both these proposals.
"The CIR appears to be saying 'un
less we see the corporation as having
an exemplary record in South Africa
we'll vote for withdrawal,' " said Ly
man. "The trustees," he added, "ap
pear to be saying 'unless we see a
particularly bad record of perfor
mance we will not vote for with
drawal.' "
Lyman said the Board of Trustees
does not believe corporate presence
in South Africa is in itself a bad thing
and they prefer to look at each in
stance individually, examining the
evidence and asking whether a par
ticular corporation is likely to be a
good or bad influence.
In the case of Texaco the board did
not feel there was a convincing case
that the company had acted irres
ponsibly, he added.
The CIR holds the view that, all
other things being equal, divestment
is preferable, according to Lyman.
The trustees have been agreeing

with CIR on many issues but have
also been "flatly disagreeing" on
several others.
"It will be useful if people can
begin to see the difference of per
ceptions between the trustee point
of view and the campus point of
view/' he said.
It is easier for students to deal with
the question of divestment in an
abstract sense than it is for trustees,
who must feel the burden of respon
sibility for managing the endow
ment, he added.
"I'm impressed and to a certain ex
tent distressed by these differences
of perception because I think they
have within them the possibility of
polarization and mutual misun
derstanding that could be damaging
to the system we've tried to set up
here," he added.
Though the Board of Trustees has
been voting against divestment pro
xies, the board's president, Peter
Bing, has been writing letters to cor
porations in Stanford's portfolio, ap
parently advocating a contrary posi
tion.
For example, in a letter to U.S.
Steel, Bing urged management "to
exert a positive force in the direction
of obtaining meaningful steps to
ward the achievement of full politi
cal, legal and social rights" in South
Africa.
Lyman said he understands how
some students could think these let
ters are not meant seriously by the
trustees and are being written merely
to appease campus pressure groups.
But he said the board honestly be
lieves such letters are an effective
way to reach management.
