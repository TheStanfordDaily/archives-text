"Apathy is a much underrated
quality," a University adminis
trator once wrote to me.
He was right. Apathy has the
power to destroy publications,
radio stations, lectures by guest
speakers and a legal counseling
office.
Once upon a time (that's about
three years ago), a spring ASSU
election brought out more than
3300 voters. The issues were
hotly debated and several fee as
sessments actually failed. The
Daily squeaked by with a2OO-vote
margin.
But last week, fewer than 2400
students bothered to register
their interest in an election that
would determine, not only the
leadership of the student voice,
but the spendingof nearly aquar
ter of a million student dollars.
Low voter turnout could just be
passed over as further evidence
of the "nobody cares" attitude
the '70s will be long remembered
for. But a clause in the ASSU
Constitution makes the vote
more meaningful: no fee as
sessment passes unless 20 per
cent of the registered students
decide to vote.
Sure, the rule may sound
dumb, but at the moment we
have to live with it.

What makes the vote aggravat
ing is this: we scream and shout
because we feel the ASSU Senate
wasn't representing us all when
they spent $1700, yet the fate of
$200,000 of our money is so in
consequential that we don't find
the time to vote.
Maybe no one voted because
the passage of the assessments
was assumed. It's true that none
received less than a 60 per cent
favorable vote. But that's cruel
irony: the most popular student
services are defeated by indiffer
ence.
It is interesting to note that
overseas students, furthest from
the services offered, turned out
in larger numbers than the stu
dents at home. More than half of
the 255 overseas this quarter re
turned ballots.
It would be nice if the close
COP runoff being voted on today
and tomorrow were decided by
more than a handful of students.
And it would be doubly pleasant
to see more than 2399 voters at
the polls in a couple of weeks
when the fee assessments, at the
organizations' expense, try
again.
