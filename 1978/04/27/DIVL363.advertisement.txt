I RESEARCH DIGITAL DESIGN APPLICATIONS
IF YOU HAVE A BACKGROUND IN DIGITAL SIGNAL PRO-
I CESSING, MICROPROCESSORS, OR TELECOMMUNICA
TIONS WE INVITE YOUR INQUIRY.
Our company manufactures and markets the TSP Model 100 Digital Tele
phone. This device, installed in any tie trunk or PBX system, is an 8080
microprocessor based voice digitizer which allows two or more people to
converse in real time, full duplex with their 4kHz voices transmitted digitally at
2400 bps. This high quality voice compression (DRT score of 92.1) is ac
complished thru use of linear predictive coding (LPC). By multiplexing into a
9600 bps modem up to four voice channels can be created from a single
/ leased telephone line. Our customers enjoy significant cost savings and
I increased communication security.
ENGINEERING RESEARCH
Design and develop future digital Working under Dr John Parker Burg tn
speech and other related commum- develop improved speech quality compres
cation equipment. Positions are sion through use of maximum entropy
i available in spectral analysis and LPC techniques,
\ it will involve speech analysis and
V' Digital Circuit Design synthesis using minicomputer systems.
Other areas of research interest are
Microcomuters cryptography, PCM and APM speech
digitization, and the development of con-
Data Communications trailers for digital speech transmission
networks. You should have the equiva
Telephone Systems lent of an M.S. or Ph D with know
ledge of electrical engineering digital
