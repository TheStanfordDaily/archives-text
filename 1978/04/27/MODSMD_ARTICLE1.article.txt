# Lyman's office occupied over withdrawal proxy
## 
### Bill Burger 
Over 50 people occupied the outer office of President
Richard Lyman for more than seven hours yesterday in
protest of the Board of Trustees to vote against a Texaco
proxy resolution calling for withdrawal of Texaco's in
vestments in South Africa.
Lyman left Stanford early yesterday morning to ad
dress the Yale Alumni Association tonight. He was una
ware of the sit-in in his office until his flight landed in
New York about 2 p.m. (PST).
The protesters left the office shortly after 4 p.m. There
was no apparent sentiment among the group for remain
ing in the office after 5 p.m. and facing possible arrest.
About 20 protesters gathered in back of Memorial
Church at 8:30 a.m. to plan the office occupation. The
group moved to the building at 8:50 a.m. only to hear of
Lyman's absence.
Jean Fetter, assistant to the president, told the group
she believed Lyman would "be mpre than happy" to

meet with them when he returned from the east coast.
Fetter urged the group to reconsider their occupation
because she failed to see any "constructive" purpose to
the sit-in.
The protesters, whose numbers were growing to
more than 50 by 9:30 a.m., then decided to contact
individual trustees by phone to have them answer ques
tions about the board's vote and request they meet with
the group in the office.
While several members of the group attempted to
contact trustees from the ASSU Office, those remaining
in Lyman's office broke up into small groups to discuss
the trustees' actions, treatment of people working in the
office and how to organize more participation in the
occupation and rally scheduled for noon in and near the
office.
No trustee contacted by the group agreed to meet
with the protesters in Lyman's office.


Several of the protesters occupying President Lyman's of
fice yesterday questioned him in New York via intercom
about the latest Board of Trustees proxy vote. From left:

Michelle Matossian and Louis Alexander. Some 50 de
monstrators remained in the office for seven hours, leaving
shortly after 4 p.m.
Members of the group also contacted people at Yale
to inform them of Lyman's visit and his participation in
the board's latest proxy vote.
Stanford Committee for a Responsible Investment
Policy (SCRIP) member Chris Cray told the protesters
that people he spoke to at Yale were "very happy" about
the occupation and planned to "give Lyman a similar
reception" there.
An effort to have Lyman paged in New York after his
landing was also undertaken before his scheduled 1:50
p.m. (PST) arrival. The group wanted to communicate
with him before he returns here next week.
Lyman called the University at about 2:30 p.m. to learn
of the sit-in in his office. ASSU Senate chairperson Fred
Crethel spoke with Lyman and arranged to have Lyman
speak with 10 of the protesters in the conference room
adjacent to the office.
A set of questions was drawn up by the protesters and
the 10 representatives chosen before the phone call.
After a brief period during which the functioning of
the conference room's intercom phone system was in
question, the 10 representatives gathered to question
Lyman about the justification of the trustees' proxy vote
considering the CIR report.
Lyman said there was a "basic difference' between
the approach taken by the board and the CIR.
He said the CIR recommends voting for withdrawal
unless an "unusually fine record" of positive influence

in South Africa can be shown by a corporation investing
there.
The trustees, on the other hand, vote for corporations
to remain in South Africa unless an "unusually bad re
cord" of positive influence is demonstrated.
Lyman was then read a quotation from Board Presi
dent Peter Bing printed in the May 10,1977 Daily, during
the May 9 Old Union sit-in saying "The trustees are not
in a position to delve deeply and thoughtfully on proxy
resolutions which are complex issues.
"We are simply dependent," Bing continued, "on the
recommendation of the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility."
Lyman responded by saying he could not "comment
on what other people say" but that he believed the
trustees "never felt they must agree with the CIR."
Lyman told the representatives he considered the per
formance of the Phelps-Dodge corporation in South Af
rica "very unsatisfactory" and added he was "in favor" of
the proxy resolution to be voted on May 3 calling for
withdrawal from South Africa.
The protesters in the conference room then read
Lyman a prepared statement from the entire group pro
testing, the trustees' vote on the Texaco proxy, Lyman's
"personal failure" to object to the decision, the "hypoc
risy" of not following the CIR recommendation on the
Texaco proxy and asking for a release of the trustees'
ad-hoc subcommittee on investment responsibility re
commendation before Monday.

speak with 10 of the protesters in the conference room
adjacent to the office.
A set of questions was drawn up by the protesters and
the 10 representatives chosen before the phone call.
After a brief period during which the functioning of
the conference room's intercom phone system was in
question, the 10 representatives gathered to question
Lyman about the justification of the trustees' proxy vote
considering the CIR report.
Lyman said there was a "basic difference' between
the approach taken by the board and the CIR.
He said the CIR recommends voting for withdrawal
unless an "unusually fine record" of positive influence

in South Africa can be shown by a corporation investing
there.
The trustees, on the other hand, vote for corporations
to remain in South Africa unless an "unusually bad re
cord" of positive influence is demonstrated.
Lyman was then read a quotation from Board Presi
dent Peter Bing printed in the May 10,1977 Daily, during
the May 9 Old Union sit-in saying "The trustees are not
in a position to delve deeply and thoughtfully on proxy
resolutions which are complex issues.
"We are simply dependent," Bing continued, "on the
recommendation of the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility."
Lyman responded by saying he could not "comment
on what other people say" but that he believed the
trustees "never felt they must agree with the CIR."
Lyman told the representatives he considered the per
formance of the Phelps-Dodge corporation in South Af
rica "very unsatisfactory" and added he was "in favor" of
the proxy resolution to be voted on May 3 calling for
withdrawal from South Africa.
The protesters in the conference room then read
Lyman a prepared statement from the entire group pro
testing, the trustees' vote on the Texaco proxy, Lyman's
"personal failure" to object to the decision, the "hypoc
risy" of not following the CIR recommendation on the
Texaco proxy and asking for a release of the trustees'
ad-hoc subcommittee on investment responsibility re
commendation before Monday.
Over 50 people occupied the outer office of President
Richard Lyman for more than seven hours yesterday in
protest of the Board of Trustees to vote against a Texaco
proxy resolution calling for withdrawal of Texaco's in
vestments in South Africa.
Lyman left Stanford early yesterday morning to ad
dress the Yale Alumni Association tonight. He was una
ware of the sit-in in his office until his flight landed in
New York about 2 p.m. (PST).
The protesters left the office shortly after 4 p.m. There
was no apparent sentiment among the group for remain
ing in the office after 5 p.m. and facing possible arrest.
About 20 protesters gathered in back of Memorial
Church at 8:30 a.m. to plan the office occupation. The
group moved to the building at 8:50 a.m. only to hear of
Lyman's absence.
Jean Fetter, assistant to the president, told the group
she believed Lyman would "be mpre than happy" to

meet with them when he returned from the east coast.
Fetter urged the group to reconsider their occupation
because she failed to see any "constructive" purpose to
the sit-in.
The protesters, whose numbers were growing to
more than 50 by 9:30 a.m., then decided to contact
individual trustees by phone to have them answer ques
tions about the board's vote and request they meet with
the group in the office.
While several members of the group attempted to
contact trustees from the ASSU Office, those remaining
in Lyman's office broke up into small groups to discuss
the trustees' actions, treatment of people working in the
office and how to organize more participation in the
occupation and rally scheduled for noon in and near the
office.
No trustee contacted by the group agreed to meet
with the protesters in Lyman's office.

about the latest Board of Trustees proxy vote. From left:

Michelle Matossian and Louis Alexander. Some 50 de
monstrators remained in the office for seven hours, leaving
shortly after 4 p.m.
Members of the group also contacted people at Yale
to inform them of Lyman's visit and his participation in
the board's latest proxy vote.
Stanford Committee for a Responsible Investment
Policy (SCRIP) member Chris Cray told the protesters
that people he spoke to at Yale were "very happy" about
the occupation and planned to "give Lyman a similar
reception" there.
An effort to have Lyman paged in New York after his
landing was also undertaken before his scheduled 1:50
p.m. (PST) arrival. The group wanted to communicate
with him before he returns here next week.
Lyman called the University at about 2:30 p.m. to learn
of the sit-in in his office. ASSU Senate chairperson Fred
Crethel spoke with Lyman and arranged to have Lyman
