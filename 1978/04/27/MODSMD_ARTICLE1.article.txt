### Bill Burger 
Over 50 people occupied the outer office of President
Richard Lyman for more than seven hours yesterday in
protest of the Board of Trustees to vote against a Texaco
proxy resolution calling for withdrawal of Texaco's in
vestments in South Africa.
Lyman left Stanford early yesterday morning to ad
dress the Yale Alumni Association tonight. He was una
ware of the sit-in in his office until his flight landed in
New York about 2 p.m. (PST).
The protesters left the office shortly after 4 p.m. There
was no apparent sentiment among the group for remain
ing in the office after 5 p.m. and facing possible arrest.
About 20 protesters gathered in back of Memorial
Church at 8:30 a.m. to plan the office occupation. The
group moved to the building at 8:50 a.m. only to hear of
Lyman's absence.
Jean Fetter, assistant to the president, told the group
she believed Lyman would "be mpre than happy" to

meet with them when he returned from the east coast.
Fetter urged the group to reconsider their occupation
because she failed to see any "constructive" purpose to
the sit-in.
The protesters, whose numbers were growing to
more than 50 by 9:30 a.m., then decided to contact
individual trustees by phone to have them answer ques
tions about the board's vote and request they meet with
the group in the office.
While several members of the group attempted to
contact trustees from the ASSU Office, those remaining
in Lyman's office broke up into small groups to discuss
the trustees' actions, treatment of people working in the
office and how to organize more participation in the
occupation and rally scheduled for noon in and near the
office.
No trustee contacted by the group agreed to meet
with the protesters in Lyman's office.


Several of the protesters occupying President Lyman's of
fice yesterday questioned him in New York via intercom
about the latest Board of Trustees proxy vote. From left:
