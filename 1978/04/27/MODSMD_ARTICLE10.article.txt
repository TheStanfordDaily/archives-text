# Pi Squareds struggle with rush

Next week, many Stanford men will make The
Big Decision. There are 13 virtuous and virulent
fraternal organizations on campus — which one
will receive their undying loyalty, the rest of their
guaranteed years and half their tuition money in
social dues? Once again, it's time for "Beat the
Draw," more commonly known as Fraternity
Rush.
Fora progress report, I spoke to I.M. Richey, the
president of Pi Squared. The Squares, as they are
affectionately known, have had trouble meeting
their housing quotas and might be turned into a
house for alternate lifestyles — a sorority. But
Richey seemed unconcerned when he met me at
the door one night last week.
"Welcome to Pi Squared," he smiled. "Have a
beerand sign in," he added, steering me to a guest
book that vaguely resembled a housing contract.
"Signing in is very importatnt, because once you
do, we've got you." For a moment, Richey looked
confused and stopped smiling. "Ah, what I mean
is, we can get in touch with you for all our rush
functions."
Best rush functions
"Speaking of rush functions," he said, smiling
again, "the Squares have the best ones of any
fraternity. First, there's our famous "kilo" party.
Every rushee and his date pack a suitcase-full of
their favorite illegal or controlled substance, and
then go the San Francisco Airport. We put their
names in a hat and draw one winner.
"We give them some dimes for the pay televi
sion and the restrooms, and pick them up in two
days. We think it's much better than sending them
to someplace like Las Vegas, because our lucky
couplecan go anywhere they want and never leave
the airport.

"Then, there's our final rush activity, the prefer
ence dinner. Only the rushees who have received
bids are invited. We're very selective about the
caliber of men we give bids to, so we want some
place with the right atmosphere. We take them to
the Golden Dragon Restaurant in Chinatown —
you know, the one with the bullet holes in the
wall. If some of them still haven't signed their bids
after dinner, we ask some of the members from
our Chinatown chapter — they prefer to be called
Dragons instead of Squares — to try and convince
the reluctant rushees.
Renowned hostesses
Anxious to change the subject before I was in
vited to the preference dinner, I asked about the
renowned Square rush hostesses, who had been
pictured — doing what they do best — on the
editorial pages of the Daily. "We were mildly con
cerned about that cartoon," Richey said, releasing
his hands from around my neck only after my
frantic gestures convinced him I had nothing to do
with that cartoon.
"Everybody knows that everything on the edito
rial pages of the Daily is true. Now, people really
believe that we Squares exploit the traditional
stereotype of women as sexual objects to fulfill the
rushee's wildest fantasies. Well, I hate to say it, but
they're wrong, and our hostesses resent the attack
on their character, not to mention the ink on their
dresses.
"We select our hostesses on the basis of intelli
gence, because they have to be able to lead
rushees on a coherent tour of our house after a
mixed drink or two. In fact, before a girl can be
come a hostess, she must come to several training
sessions. These sessions are very demanding, and

many last all night, but how else can you expect a
hostess to become an authority on the interior of
our rooms?"
Hoping to meet one of these intelligent women,
I asked for a house tour. Richey sadly informed
me, however, that all the hostesses were booked
for the remainder of the Square's rush. But he was
still available to set the record straight about
fraternities.
No country club
"People accuse us of being a country club, but
they don't know what they're talking about," he
said. "It's true that some fraternities have wet bars,
saunas, weight rooms, lounges, built-in water
beds and lofts, but only half of the rooms in the
Square are like that.
"And people say it's expensive to live in a frater
nity. Nothing could be further trom the truth.
Actually, being a Square is about as expensive as
the dorms. Of course, that's only counting social
dues. Once you throw in other minor expenses,
like room and board, it might be a little more.
"But money isn't the most important thing.
Brotherhood and lifelong friendship is. We want
men with character, moral conviction, honesty,
responsibility, personal strength, dedication and
pride. But most of all, we want sophomore equiva
lents with money."
As I said good night, Richey suddenly looked
worried. "You did sign in, didn't you?" he asked,
thumbing through the guestbook. When he found
my signature, he was visibly relieved.
"See you next fall." bo smiled.
