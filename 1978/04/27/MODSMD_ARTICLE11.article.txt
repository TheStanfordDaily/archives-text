Clarifying perspective
In all fairness I must say that I took
unaccustomed pleasure in reading
the article on Stokely Carmichael
(Daily, April 24). The reporting gave a
fair and basically accurate treatment
in reaccounting what Car
miihael spoke about last Sunday
night.
However, there was one error that
I cannot, in good consciousness, let
pass uncorrected. It was the article's
definition of Pan Africanism as es
poused by Carmichael. The article
said it was, "... a movement to
make blacks more aware of the herit
age of their homeland.''
While this is true, it omits the

theoretical foundation of the con
cept which states that we must strug
gle for the total liberation and unifi
cation of Africa and its development
under scientific socialism. This is the
Nkrumahist conception of Pan Af
ricanism which is the political plat
form of Stokely and the All-African
People's Revolutionary Party, which
Carmichael founded.
I think without clarifying this point
one could easily lose sight of the
political thrust of Carmichael's mes
sage and his conception of a true re
volutionary movement.
