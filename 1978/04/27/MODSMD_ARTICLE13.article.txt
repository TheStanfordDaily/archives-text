# Disorientation Week speech on UMW strike
## Coal miners were unsuccessful, says reporter 
### Lonnie Rosenwald 
"In the coal mine strike,
what was at issue was the right
to strike and the health care
plan. Wages were never the is
sue," said Paul Allen, a KPFA
reporter who covered the coal
mine strikes in Appalachia last
month.
In a speech here last Thurs
day that was part of Disorienta
tion Week, Allen called the Un
ited Mine Workers of America
(UMWA) strike successful only
in that "mine workers proved
they could stay out on strike for
109 days, and that they could
get support from other labor
unions."

But they did not win their
demand for restoration of the
UMWA Health and Retirement
Fund which had provided free
industry-supported medical
care and union operated hos
pitals since 1946, but was
eliminated in the new contract.
Under the new contract,
health costs up to $200 per year
are paid by the workers, in
seven and a half-dollar per visit
increments, and private insur
ance companies will finance
the remainder.
Primary concern
Health care is a primary con
cern in an industry in which
one out of every eight workers

is disabled each day, according
to Allen's estimate.
The end of the
industry-supported health care
plan means more than higher
health, costs, said Allen. When
the UMWA Health and Retire
ment Fund closes its offices,
mining towns will lose what is
often the only local employer
besides the mine. And insur
ance companies will drain
money out of Appalachia.
"The county of Appalachia
ground to a halt. People lived
on food stamps and each
other's generosity.," Allen
said.
Attacking what he called

"red-baiting by the press" in
portraying the strikes, Allen
described the average
mineworker as "fiercely patrio
tic and anti-communist." Al
though most are Democrats,
Allen said he thinks they won't
vote for Carter again, as they
did in 1976.
BCOA
"They think he should have
seized the mines. He gave in to
the BCOA," said Allen, refer
ring to the Bituminous Coal
Operators Association, which
is the bargaining unit of the
mine owners, and also sets the
price of coal.
Allen also attacked the press
for overlaying the role of the
Revolutionary Communist
Party (RCP), a small organiza
tion of about 12 members,
which was active in the strike.
"The RCP were fiercely re
sented by the actual rank and
file. They resented a political

organization infiltrating their
union and they then trying to
direct the progress of the
strike."
Commenting on Black Lung
disease, a deadly ailment
caused by inhaling coal dust,
Allen said," Everybody has it,"
but a victim's survivors must
prove that it was the a cause of
death in order to colleci: a $225
monthly compensation pen
sion. The new contract, when
completed, will include an in
crease in that payment.
Nothing new
The new contract also adds
no new safety provisions,
though the strikers sought the
local right to strike if hazards
occur.
"Miners should have the
right to withdraw their services
if there is a safety hazard," said
Allen.
As it stands now, safety in
spectors are called in when a

hazard, such as a faulty ven
tilating fan, is discerned. The
delay between reporting, in
spection, and correction could
result in an injury.
A provision in the 1969 Mine
Enforcement Safety Act re
quires that one man be placed
in each work crew just to en
sure safety. However, that
extra worker is usually busy
operating machinery, in viola
tion of the regulation.
Support shown
The greatest gain of the
strike, said Allen, was in the
support shown by other un
ions.
"The other unions really
began to come to the aid of
another union, particularly a
union that is outside of the
AFL-CIO," said Allen. The Un
ited Auto Workers, for in
stance, gave $2 million to the
UMWA, and the International
Longshoremen's and

Warehousemen's Union seri
ously considered a work stop
page.
Allen, who spent three
weeks traveling in West Vir
ginia and Kentucky, staying in
the homes of coalminers, wit
nessed the hardship that the
strike brought to Appalachian
mining towns.
Future trouble
Allen warned of future trou
ble in the coal industry, as Pres
ident Carter wants to increase
mine output from 675 million
to one billion tons per year.
Most of the additional coal will
come from strip mines in the
western United States.
Miners there belong either
to company associations or to
the Teamsters Union, and an
increase in their numbers will
weaken the UMWA. As of 1974,
only 50 percent of the coal
mined in the U.S. was mined
by UMWA members.

said.
Attacking what he called

"red-baiting by the press" in
portraying the strikes, Allen
described the average
mineworker as "fiercely patrio
tic and anti-communist." Al
though most are Democrats,
Allen said he thinks they won't
vote for Carter again, as they
did in 1976.
BCOA
"They think he should have
seized the mines. He gave in to
the BCOA," said Allen, refer
ring to the Bituminous Coal
Operators Association, which
is the bargaining unit of the
mine owners, and also sets the
price of coal.
Allen also attacked the press
for overlaying the role of the
Revolutionary Communist
Party (RCP), a small organiza
tion of about 12 members,
which was active in the strike.
"The RCP were fiercely re
sented by the actual rank and
file. They resented a political

organization infiltrating their
union and they then trying to
direct the progress of the
strike."
Commenting on Black Lung
disease, a deadly ailment
caused by inhaling coal dust,
Allen said," Everybody has it,"
but a victim's survivors must
prove that it was the a cause of
death in order to colleci: a $225
monthly compensation pen
sion. The new contract, when
completed, will include an in
crease in that payment.
Nothing new
The new contract also adds
no new safety provisions,
though the strikers sought the
local right to strike if hazards
occur.
"Miners should have the
right to withdraw their services
if there is a safety hazard," said
Allen.
As it stands now, safety in
spectors are called in when a

hazard, such as a faulty ven
tilating fan, is discerned. The
delay between reporting, in
spection, and correction could
result in an injury.
A provision in the 1969 Mine
Enforcement Safety Act re
quires that one man be placed
in each work crew just to en
sure safety. However, that
extra worker is usually busy
operating machinery, in viola
tion of the regulation.
Support shown
The greatest gain of the
strike, said Allen, was in the
support shown by other un
ions.
"The other unions really
began to come to the aid of
another union, particularly a
union that is outside of the
AFL-CIO," said Allen. The Un
ited Auto Workers, for in
stance, gave $2 million to the
UMWA, and the International
Longshoremen's and

Warehousemen's Union seri
ously considered a work stop
page.
Allen, who spent three
weeks traveling in West Vir
ginia and Kentucky, staying in
the homes of coalminers, wit
nessed the hardship that the
strike brought to Appalachian
mining towns.
Future trouble
Allen warned of future trou
ble in the coal industry, as Pres
ident Carter wants to increase
mine output from 675 million
to one billion tons per year.
Most of the additional coal will
come from strip mines in the
western United States.
Miners there belong either
to company associations or to
the Teamsters Union, and an
increase in their numbers will
weaken the UMWA. As of 1974,
only 50 percent of the coal
mined in the U.S. was mined
by UMWA members.
"In the coal mine strike,
what was at issue was the right
to strike and the health care
plan. Wages were never the is
sue," said Paul Allen, a KPFA
reporter who covered the coal
mine strikes in Appalachia last
month.
In a speech here last Thurs
day that was part of Disorienta
tion Week, Allen called the Un
ited Mine Workers of America
(UMWA) strike successful only
in that "mine workers proved
they could stay out on strike for
109 days, and that they could
get support from other labor
unions."

But they did not win their
demand for restoration of the
UMWA Health and Retirement
Fund which had provided free
industry-supported medical
care and union operated hos
pitals since 1946, but was
eliminated in the new contract.
Under the new contract,
health costs up to $200 per year
are paid by the workers, in
seven and a half-dollar per visit
increments, and private insur
ance companies will finance
the remainder.
Primary concern
Health care is a primary con
cern in an industry in which
one out of every eight workers

is disabled each day, according
to Allen's estimate.
The end of the
industry-supported health care
plan means more than higher
health, costs, said Allen. When
the UMWA Health and Retire
ment Fund closes its offices,
mining towns will lose what is
often the only local employer
besides the mine. And insur
ance companies will drain
money out of Appalachia.
"The county of Appalachia
ground to a halt. People lived
on food stamps and each
other's generosity.," Allen
said.
Attacking what he called

"red-baiting by the press" in
portraying the strikes, Allen
described the average
