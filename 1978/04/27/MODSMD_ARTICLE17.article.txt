# Beer called world's second most popular drink in survey book
##

As another spring quarter of
keggers, lakers and nooners
passes by, Stanford students
may stop to wonder about that
golden liquid that flows so
readily from a tapped keg.
Beer is the world's most
popular drink next to tea, ac
cording to Bob Abel's "The
Book of Beer."
The base ingredient of all
beer is malt. Extracted from
grain, usually barley, the star
chy malt gives beer its charac
teristic body and flavor. The
more malt and sugar used, the
more alcoholic the beer will
be. The main source of varia
tion in beer is the difference in
the malt/sugar ratio.
This mixture serves as a food
source for yeast, which in
itiates the primary fermenta
tion of the beer. Hops are
added during the boilingof the
unfermented beer to sterilize it
and to give it flavor and bitter
ness.
Is it the water?
It was once thought that the
best water for brewing pur
poses would be light in organic
matter and that hard water
produced a distinctly tasty
beer. But in spite of Olympia's
claim that "It's the water,"
today all water used for brew
ing is treated chemically.
European beers are gener

ally aged longer than American
beers before bottling, and un
less they are going to be ex
ported, they are usually not
pasteurized. Pasteurization
destroys some of the delicate
qualities added by aging.
But according to Fritz
Maytag, president and brew
master of Anchor Steam Beer
in San Francisco, "It's difficult
to ship beer without losing
some of its quality. There are
all sorts of things you can do to
beer to make it stable, biologi
cally and physically, and none
of them are good for the beer."
Traditionally, beer was
stored in barrels and served by
methods which did not use
carbon dioxide pressure. Beer
would leave the brewery in its
natural state, still able to fer
ment in the cask.
Inferior ingredients
But keg beer served in pubs
today is "an entirely different
drink," says Richard Gilbert,
British beer expert. "It is made
with inferior ingredients like
hop extracts which prevent the
brewer from instilling indi
vidual character and flavor into
his beers. It is filtered and pas
teurized, which robs the beer
of its taste and prevents its con
tinued fermentation. Beer is
stored in kegs or pressurized
casks.
, "When it is served, it is

forced from its container by an
injection of carbon dioxide
pressure," says Gilbert. "Inno
cent drinkers believe that sim
ply because their beer has a
foaming head, it must be a
good beer. In fact, the head is
irrelevant to the quality of the
beer since most of the head in
keg beers is the result of car
bon dioxide."
Other changes in the types
of beers have also taken place.
Long ago, ale contained no
hops and was sweet but tended
to go sour rapidly. In the 15th
century, hops were imported
to England and although brew
ing of beer was discouraged by
forbidding the use of hops,
beer gradually became more
popular. Now the two names
are used interchangeably.
Hops helped produce a more

stable, longer-lasting drink,
while imparting the drier,
sharper taste of beer.
Can't get ale
Real ale has not generally
been obtainable since the end
of the Middle Ages.
In considerable contrast to
the stronger, malty but flat
British brews is the light,
sparkling lager which quickly
caught on in America.
C)ne ditference between
them is the yeast. Instead of ale
or top-fermenting yeast, which
rises to the top at the end of the
fermentation process, lager
yeast sinks to the bottom, caus
ing the fermentation and
sparkling bubbles to rise up
ward.
Somewhere in between
lager and ale is steam beer,
brewed in San Francisco and

unique to America. Steam beer
is made with a bottom
fermenting yeast, like lager,
but it looks and tastes more
like ale. Steam beer uses more
hops than lager does and uses
only barley malt, which gives
the beer more flavor.
Steam beer also has 100 per
cent natural carbonation. By
the process of krausening,
newly fermented, highly
charged beer is added to the
original brew, which adds
more flavor and more head.
Some lager brewers, on the
other hand, krausen only part
of their beer while others sim
ply add carbon dioxide.
Coors â€” a second religion
An example of how proces
sing affects the final product is
Coors, a light, dry, mild beer
and a second religion in the 12

Western states where it is mar
keted.
Unlike most other beers,
Coors contains no additives, is
not pasteurized, and is trans
ported in refrigerated trucks.
The average time from brewer
to consumer is one month, so
Coors drinkers get their beer
one-third sooner than other
beer drinkers. The brewing
process takes 80 days, more
than four times longer than for
some other beers.
Beer should be stored and
served correctly to be fully ap
preciated.
As Bob Abel says,"Beer is a
fragile food." Beer deterior
ates in the sun faster than milk
and should therefore be kept
in a cool place. When stored in
the refrigerator, the bottles or
cans should be kept upright,

not on their sides, so that tin
least possible amount of thr.
beer is exposed to the air in the
container.
Cans are colder
Beer tends to last longer in
bottles but colder beer, .in
American fetish, comes from
cans. Lager should be served in
the high 30s and steam beet
slightly warmer.
There is often considerable
debate about the proper way t(
pour beer. One fairly reliable
way to produce a good-tastinf
glass of beer, according to
"The Book of Beer," is to pout
a small amount directly into the
bottom of the glass, give thi
foam time to rise a bit and pro
tect the carbonation, and then
gently pour the rest down tin
side of the glass, held in the
hand at an angle.
