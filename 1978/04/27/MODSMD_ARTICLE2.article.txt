# Law school admissions committees confused
## LSAT changed by testing service 
### Andrea James 
Admissions committees at law
schools across the country were
amazed last October to find 2.1 per
cent of all students taking the Law
School Achievement Test (LSAT) re
ceived scores of 750 and above, as
compared to a 1.01 per cent average
over the last few years.
Admissions committees were even
more amazed, and slightly worried,
to discover the Educational Testing
Service (ETS), which prepares LSATs,
had changed the tests.
Now admissions committees don't
know what to do and neither does
Stanford Law School Prof. William
Cohen, chairman of the law school
admissions committee here.
"Being aware of the problem
doesn't do us much good," Cohen
said. "If we knew what to do, the
situation would be a lot better."
The Law School uses a rolling ad
missions process, so potential law
students are accepted throughout
the year, from lanuary until registra
tion day in September. Because of
this process and because Cohen was
on sabbatical leave until early
lanuary, "the students we accepted
before we knew about the changed
tests would have been accepted
anyway.
"When we had to make the crunch
decisions, ETS had already notified
us about the changed tests," he ad
ded.
Cohen said he is being "highly
subjective" in making his decisions.
"We're always subjective; we

never make our decisions solely on a
number basis," Cohen said. "But de
cisions are hard enough when tests
are equal.
"It's an impossible task," he ad
ded.
Boalt Law School at UC-Berkeley
had also learned about the different
tests before they had to make
"crunch decisions."
"ETS sent us a memo that the aver
age drift of LSATs was higher," said
Marty Africa, assistant director of
admissions at Boalt. "We alerted the
admissions committee about the
scores before many acceptance let
ters had been mailed."

But some schools weren't as lucky.
Harvard Law School, for example,
had sent acceptance letters to half
their first-year class before they re
ceived the memo.
"In our admissions process, we
either immediately admit students,
immediately deny them admission,
or place them in a hold category,"
explained Patricia Lydon, director of
the admissions office at Harvard Law
School. "As a result of our not know
ing about the different test, we im
mediately admitted more students
and held less. Consequently, those
who are in the hold category have a
lesser chance of being admitted."

John Smith, director of media rela
tions at ETS, said the testing service
"changes tests all the time," but the
change in October was not "a normal
change.
"We changed the fall and winter
test pattern to give more able candi
dates more opportunities," he said.
"We didn't anticipate the law
schools' reaction."
He said it is not the policy of the
testing service to notify law schools
of changes in LSATs.,
Smith added ETS has "given them
(law schools) as much information as
possible about the new tests" and
has attempted to interpret fall test
scores differently so they can more
easily be compared to tests adminis
tered before October.
Smith said ETS "made some addi
tions in the December test." Cohen
agreed December test scores above
750, although still higher than the
1.01 average, are closer to that aver
age than they were in October.

either immediately admit students,
immediately deny them admission,
or place them in a hold category,"
explained Patricia Lydon, director of
the admissions office at Harvard Law
School. "As a result of our not know
ing about the different test, we im
mediately admitted more students
and held less. Consequently, those
who are in the hold category have a
lesser chance of being admitted."

John Smith, director of media rela
tions at ETS, said the testing service
"changes tests all the time," but the
change in October was not "a normal
change.
"We changed the fall and winter
test pattern to give more able candi
dates more opportunities," he said.
"We didn't anticipate the law
schools' reaction."
He said it is not the policy of the
testing service to notify law schools
of changes in LSATs.,
Smith added ETS has "given them
(law schools) as much information as
possible about the new tests" and
has attempted to interpret fall test
scores differently so they can more
easily be compared to tests adminis
tered before October.
Smith said ETS "made some addi
tions in the December test." Cohen
agreed December test scores above
750, although still higher than the
1.01 average, are closer to that aver
age than they were in October.

resolution calling for withdrawal of Texaco investment in South Africa.
Admissions committees at law
schools across the country were
amazed last October to find 2.1 per
cent of all students taking the Law
School Achievement Test (LSAT) re
ceived scores of 750 and above, as
compared to a 1.01 per cent average
over the last few years.
Admissions committees were even
more amazed, and slightly worried,
to discover the Educational Testing
Service (ETS), which prepares LSATs,
had changed the tests.
Now admissions committees don't
know what to do and neither does
Stanford Law School Prof. William
Cohen, chairman of the law school
admissions committee here.
"Being aware of the problem
doesn't do us much good," Cohen
said. "If we knew what to do, the
situation would be a lot better."
The Law School uses a rolling ad
missions process, so potential law
students are accepted throughout
the year, from lanuary until registra
tion day in September. Because of
this process and because Cohen was
on sabbatical leave until early
lanuary, "the students we accepted
before we knew about the changed
tests would have been accepted
anyway.
"When we had to make the crunch
decisions, ETS had already notified
us about the changed tests," he ad
ded.
Cohen said he is being "highly
subjective" in making his decisions.
"We're always subjective; we

never make our decisions solely on a
number basis," Cohen said. "But de
cisions are hard enough when tests
are equal.
"It's an impossible task," he ad
ded.
Boalt Law School at UC-Berkeley
had also learned about the different
tests before they had to make
"crunch decisions."
"ETS sent us a memo that the aver
age drift of LSATs was higher," said
Marty Africa, assistant director of
admissions at Boalt. "We alerted the
admissions committee about the
scores before many acceptance let
ters had been mailed."

But some schools weren't as lucky.
Harvard Law School, for example,
had sent acceptance letters to half
their first-year class before they re
ceived the memo.
"In our admissions process, we
either immediately admit students,
immediately deny them admission,
or place them in a hold category,"
explained Patricia Lydon, director of
the admissions office at Harvard Law
School. "As a result of our not know
ing about the different test, we im
