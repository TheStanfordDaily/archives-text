# Films can immunize kids to ads
## Ads' effects on kids studied

Commercials. Flashing at
you incessantly from the TV sc
reen, they make you want to
buy everything you see. At
least, if you haven't advanced
to the great age when Vance
Packardcan reveal all the tricks
of the hidden persuaders.
There is a whole industry in
the United States dedicated to
persuading those too
young to see through the tricks
to buy, buy, buy. Kids' televi
sion is constantly interrupted
with flashing messages aimed
at the under 10s.

"Free" toys in cereals, spe
cial effects and lighting and
stars like Bill Cosby are used to
make mediocre products the
object of every child's desire.
However, Don Roberts, an
associate professor in the Insti
tute of- Communication Re
search here, believes he has
found a way to "inrioculate"
young children against the
hidden power of the ads.
Two films
Roberts and his team of re
searchers used two films to
teach kids from second
through eighth grades to see
through TV advertising
techniques.
The films, the Consumer's
Union's "The $6-Billion Sell"
and Vision Films' "Seeing
through Commercials," had
the greatest impact on the
youngest viewers tested, and
on those who watch most tele
vision.
"Before testing," Roberts
said, "high television watching
was associated with high trust
in commercials. We wiped out
that early relationship."
Most examples
Roberts said he thought avid
TV viewers responded best to

the films because they had the
most examples of commercials
stored away in their heads.
Once the slick advertising
techniques were exposed by
the films, TV addicts could
think of many commercials
that used just such methods.
Roberts conducted his re
search on commercials in Feb
ruary and April last year. The
project was just one of the
many that has made him a na
tional authority on children
and the mass media.
"I work from a premise
which says: 'children are a
special audience,' " Roberts
explained. "They are more
vulnerable. They don't know
they're being persuaded. They
think they're being taught."
Same techniques
Ironically, the films shown to
the children use many of the
same techniques as the glossy
commercials they attack. A glit
tering quiz show format, an
appealing host and eye
catching photography are used
to full effect in order to convey
the message that "you do have
choices," and that "what you
really get is the product, not
the promises." The only choice
you don't get is not to buy.
"The film is saying: 'buy
what you wanna buy, not what
they want you to — but for
Cod's sake don't give up buy
ing,' " Roberts said with a
smile.
"Nobody questions our
whole consumer mentality,"
Roberts continued. "Not the
films. Not even the television
critics. Howisitthatweliveina
nation where one half of the
policy says 'conserve' and the
other half says 'to consume is

to be happy.' It's very
schizoid."
Ambivalent
In some ways, Roberts' own
views on television commer
cials are equally ambivalent.
He said he dislikes the way
kids' commercials seek to
make the kids themselves the
media, by encouraging chil
dren to urge their parents to
buy the latest sugar-frosted
cereal and high-speed toy car.
Roberts said he wants chil
dren's advertising controlled.
But heisalso acutely aware that
advertising dollars pay for chil
dren's programs, which he said
should be retained.
"I just can't see the industry
pouring money into program
ming that they can't get some
of their money back on,"
Roberts acknowledged.
Running scared
Nevertheless, advertising
agencies are running scared,
fearing results of the Federal
Trade Commission's (FTC)
hearings on children's com
mercials this fall.
Roberts said he has had calls
from agencies asking him
which print media children
read or see the most. If the FTC
bans advertising altogether
from children's television, the
agents have to find an outlet
for their big advertising bucks.
"I think the FTC is going to
make some changes," Roberts
said. "If I were king, I would
say anybody who advertises
two minutes of junk food must
also pay for two minutes of
nutrition advertising."
Public Service Announcements
Public Service Announce
ments (PSAs) for children have

already appeared on at least
one national network and on
local stations such as KBHK
(Channel 44) in San Francisco.
They deal with such diverse to
pics as cycle and skateboard
safety, how to approach a
strange dog, and the bad qual
ities of junk food.
PSAs may offer a different
message from McDonald's
commercials. But the
techniques they use are the
same. So Roberts is faced with
a problem. "Seeing through
Commercials" may encourage
kids to reject all the messages
the media sends them.
Roberts used his own five
year-old son as an example.
"He'll say: 'Hey, get rid of this
Ivory soap. I've seen it on
TV,' " Roberts explained.
"Then what happens with a
PSA that tells him to go eat
cheese. He'd love that. He'd
think hamburgers were OK
after all."
Counter-commercial
Clearly, creating a
"counter-commercial" culture
has its problems. But at least
the effort is being made. Films
such as "The Six Billion Dollar
Sell" may have sufficient im
pact to make "The Five Billion
Dollar Sell" a more appropriate
title in 10 years time. Roberts'
research shows skeptics can be
made out of previou's believ
ers.
So there may be less scream
ing voices in the supermarket,
clamoring for candy and Fros
ties . And it's just possible that
the hidden persuaders will
change sides. In the future,
they could find themselves
pushing cheese instead of
cocoa puddles.

youngest viewers tested, and
on those who watch most tele
vision.
"Before testing," Roberts
said, "high television watching
was associated with high trust
in commercials. We wiped out
that early relationship."
Most examples
Roberts said he thought avid
TV viewers responded best to

the films because they had the
most examples of commercials
stored away in their heads.
Once the slick advertising
techniques were exposed by
the films, TV addicts could
think of many commercials
that used just such methods.
Roberts conducted his re
search on commercials in Feb
ruary and April last year. The
project was just one of the
many that has made him a na
tional authority on children
and the mass media.
"I work from a premise
which says: 'children are a
special audience,' " Roberts
explained. "They are more
vulnerable. They don't know
they're being persuaded. They
think they're being taught."
Same techniques
Ironically, the films shown to
the children use many of the
same techniques as the glossy
commercials they attack. A glit
tering quiz show format, an
appealing host and eye
catching photography are used
to full effect in order to convey
the message that "you do have
choices," and that "what you
really get is the product, not
the promises." The only choice
you don't get is not to buy.
"The film is saying: 'buy
what you wanna buy, not what
they want you to — but for
Cod's sake don't give up buy
ing,' " Roberts said with a
smile.
"Nobody questions our
whole consumer mentality,"
Roberts continued. "Not the
films. Not even the television
critics. Howisitthatweliveina
nation where one half of the
policy says 'conserve' and the
other half says 'to consume is

to be happy.' It's very
schizoid."
Ambivalent
In some ways, Roberts' own
views on television commer
cials are equally ambivalent.
He said he dislikes the way
kids' commercials seek to
make the kids themselves the
media, by encouraging chil
dren to urge their parents to
buy the latest sugar-frosted
cereal and high-speed toy car.
Roberts said he wants chil
dren's advertising controlled.
But heisalso acutely aware that
advertising dollars pay for chil
dren's programs, which he said
should be retained.
"I just can't see the industry
pouring money into program
ming that they can't get some
of their money back on,"
Roberts acknowledged.
Running scared
Nevertheless, advertising
agencies are running scared,
fearing results of the Federal
Trade Commission's (FTC)
hearings on children's com
mercials this fall.
Roberts said he has had calls
from agencies asking him
which print media children
read or see the most. If the FTC
bans advertising altogether
from children's television, the
agents have to find an outlet
for their big advertising bucks.
"I think the FTC is going to
make some changes," Roberts
said. "If I were king, I would
say anybody who advertises
two minutes of junk food must
also pay for two minutes of
nutrition advertising."
Public Service Announcements
Public Service Announce
ments (PSAs) for children have

already appeared on at least
one national network and on
local stations such as KBHK
(Channel 44) in San Francisco.
They deal with such diverse to
pics as cycle and skateboard
safety, how to approach a
strange dog, and the bad qual
ities of junk food.
PSAs may offer a different
message from McDonald's
commercials. But the
techniques they use are the
same. So Roberts is faced with
a problem. "Seeing through
Commercials" may encourage
kids to reject all the messages
the media sends them.
Roberts used his own five
year-old son as an example.
"He'll say: 'Hey, get rid of this
Ivory soap. I've seen it on
TV,' " Roberts explained.
"Then what happens with a
PSA that tells him to go eat
cheese. He'd love that. He'd
think hamburgers were OK
after all."
Counter-commercial
Clearly, creating a
"counter-commercial" culture
has its problems. But at least
the effort is being made. Films
such as "The Six Billion Dollar
Sell" may have sufficient im
pact to make "The Five Billion
Dollar Sell" a more appropriate
title in 10 years time. Roberts'
research shows skeptics can be
made out of previou's believ
ers.
So there may be less scream
ing voices in the supermarket,
clamoring for candy and Fros
ties . And it's just possible that
the hidden persuaders will
change sides. In the future,
they could find themselves
pushing cheese instead of
cocoa puddles.

really get is the product, not
the promises." The only choice
you don't get is not to buy.
"The film is saying: 'buy
what you wanna buy, not what
they want you to — but for
Cod's sake don't give up buy
ing,' " Roberts said with a
smile.
"Nobody questions our
whole consumer mentality,"
Roberts continued. "Not the
films. Not even the television
critics. Howisitthatweliveina
nation where one half of the
policy says 'conserve' and the
other half says 'to consume is

to be happy.' It's very
schizoid."
Ambivalent
In some ways, Roberts' own
views on television commer
cials are equally ambivalent.
He said he dislikes the way
kids' commercials seek to
make the kids themselves the
media, by encouraging chil
dren to urge their parents to
buy the latest sugar-frosted
cereal and high-speed toy car.
Roberts said he wants chil
dren's advertising controlled.
But heisalso acutely aware that
advertising dollars pay for chil
dren's programs, which he said
should be retained.
"I just can't see the industry
pouring money into program
ming that they can't get some
of their money back on,"
Roberts acknowledged.
Running scared
Nevertheless, advertising
agencies are running scared,
fearing results of the Federal
Trade Commission's (FTC)
hearings on children's com
mercials this fall.
Roberts said he has had calls
from agencies asking him
which print media children
read or see the most. If the FTC
bans advertising altogether
from children's television, the
agents have to find an outlet
for their big advertising bucks.
"I think the FTC is going to
make some changes," Roberts
said. "If I were king, I would
say anybody who advertises
two minutes of junk food must
also pay for two minutes of
nutrition advertising."
Public Service Announcements
Public Service Announce
ments (PSAs) for children have

already appeared on at least
one national network and on
local stations such as KBHK
(Channel 44) in San Francisco.
They deal with such diverse to
pics as cycle and skateboard
safety, how to approach a
strange dog, and the bad qual
ities of junk food.
PSAs may offer a different
message from McDonald's
commercials. But the
techniques they use are the
same. So Roberts is faced with
a problem. "Seeing through
Commercials" may encourage
kids to reject all the messages
the media sends them.
Roberts used his own five
year-old son as an example.
"He'll say: 'Hey, get rid of this
Ivory soap. I've seen it on
TV,' " Roberts explained.
"Then what happens with a
PSA that tells him to go eat
cheese. He'd love that. He'd
think hamburgers were OK
after all."
Counter-commercial
Clearly, creating a
"counter-commercial" culture
has its problems. But at least
the effort is being made. Films
such as "The Six Billion Dollar
Sell" may have sufficient im
pact to make "The Five Billion
Dollar Sell" a more appropriate
title in 10 years time. Roberts'
research shows skeptics can be
made out of previou's believ
ers.
So there may be less scream
ing voices in the supermarket,
clamoring for candy and Fros
ties . And it's just possible that
the hidden persuaders will
change sides. In the future,
they could find themselves
pushing cheese instead of
cocoa puddles.
