You know, of course, that
Victorian England watched
with some trepidation as
women began to enter the in
stitutions of higher learning.
In 1847 Tennyson wrote "The
Princess," a poem describing
an idyllic Women's Univer
sity totally excluding men.
Gilbert's response was a
play called "Princess Ida,"
written in blank verse, and
termed by its author "a gentle
parody" of Tennyson's poem.
It was not very successful as a
play, and it was not until
1884, when Sullivan set it to
music, that "Princess Ida,"
or, "Castle Adamant" as we
now know it, came to be.
Next week the Stanford
Savoyards begin their version
of the play; in the picture at
right, Emmie Stensteot (lady
Psyche), Anatole Liebovich
(Cyril), Karen Miller (Florian)
and Gerald Chapped (Prince
Hilarion) have at those awful
Victorians.
Performance dates for
"Princess Ida" are April 28,
29 and 30, and May 5, 6 and
7.
