## A 						'fusioned-out' saxophone...

Bernard Shaw once com
mented, "Reviewing has one
advantage over suicide. In
suicide you take it out of your
self: in reviewing you take it
out of other people." Today I
am going to take it out of Sonny
Rollins.
It's not like playing Cod with
Rollins would hurt his ego: he
is 48 years old (no spring chic
ken) and has been at the foref
ront of the jazz scene since he
gave up painting to take up the
saxophone 30 years ago. Grow
ing up in Harlem next door to

the likes of Coleman Hawkins
and his idol Bud Powell, Rollins
developed a big sound and lyr
ical style early in his career
which has remained a hallmark
of his playing despite later in
fluences. Of course, Rollins
was growing up during the
height of Be-bop and as he
laconicly puts it, Charlie Parker
was "our hero. He was our
leader."
Newk
In the late '50s Rollins —
nicknamed Newk — brought
forth the best of Hawkins and

Parker in a style that was un
questionably his own. His
monstrous tone and com
manding technique were cap
ped off with a strongly
rhythmic and delightfully
comic style. In 1959, at the
height of his creativity and
popularity Rollins disap
peared.
For Sonny the '60s was a
period of hide-n-seek. As he
explained in a candid interview
in 1973, "In 1959 there was a lot
of pressure on me. Also, my
health wasn't too good; I was
drinkinga whole lot, smokinga
whole lot. . . So I left to go
back and do some more music
and studying . . . and medi
tated by myself."
Zen
In 1964, three years after he
returned to performing pub
licly, he began playing in the
avant-garde style of his con
temporary Ornette Coleman.
After a few more years of
changing between "inside"
and "outside" styles he left for
India and Japan to study Hatha
Yoga and Zen, and didn't come
back to his horn until the early
'70s.
But Sonny, what have you
done for us lately? I went to
find out when he recently ap
peared at Great American
Music Hall with Donald Byrd,
Tony Williams, and his group
— Nucleus '78.
In a word, Sonny is
"fusioned-out." The majority
of the eight tunes he played
were smothered with loud and
heavy handed rhythm and the

solos by the Dashiki-clad Rol
lins and the yachting-jacketed
Byrd were as insipid as the
changes they were playing
over. The piano player could
have been anybody and I wish
the guitar player had been
somebody else. Rollins' bass
player was working hard, but
his tasty licks only became au
dible when the rhythm section
settled down and he came out
of his "bass cloud."
Overshadowed
I was looking forward to
some exciting playing from
Tony Williams, but unfortu
nately Rollins never let him
spread out. The few solos that
Williams did take were
thoughtful and gave the audi
ence glimpses of his smooth
technique and imagination,
but for most of the night his
creativity was overshadowed
by his role as rhythm maker.
There was one point when I
heard the Rollins I came to
hear. Sonny began the third
tune of the set with an unac
companied solo which lasted
for 10 minutes and showed me
that Rollins never needed a
rhythm section in the first
place. His huge sandpaper
sound and his sardonic wit ap
peared as a welcome sign that
the genius and the energy that
Rollins exhibited in the late '50s
still remained — albeit cosme
tic and rusty — through all the
turns that Sonny's music have
since taken.
Today
I sincerely believe that to
day, as in the past, Sonny Rol

lins is playing the kind of music
he wants to play. His tastes
have greatly changed over the
past 20 years, but from the
standing ovation he received
as I was leaving it appears that
Rollins still knows what
everyone wants to hear.
Well, almost everyone.

back and do some more music
and studying . . . and medi
tated by myself."
Zen
In 1964, three years after he
returned to performing pub
licly, he began playing in the
avant-garde style of his con
temporary Ornette Coleman.
After a few more years of
changing between "inside"
and "outside" styles he left for
India and Japan to study Hatha
Yoga and Zen, and didn't come
back to his horn until the early
'70s.
But Sonny, what have you
done for us lately? I went to
find out when he recently ap
peared at Great American
Music Hall with Donald Byrd,
Tony Williams, and his group
— Nucleus '78.
In a word, Sonny is
"fusioned-out." The majority
of the eight tunes he played
were smothered with loud and
heavy handed rhythm and the

solos by the Dashiki-clad Rol
lins and the yachting-jacketed
Byrd were as insipid as the
changes they were playing
over. The piano player could
have been anybody and I wish
the guitar player had been
somebody else. Rollins' bass
player was working hard, but
his tasty licks only became au
dible when the rhythm section
settled down and he came out
of his "bass cloud."
Overshadowed
I was looking forward to
some exciting playing from
Tony Williams, but unfortu
nately Rollins never let him
spread out. The few solos that
Williams did take were
thoughtful and gave the audi
ence glimpses of his smooth
technique and imagination,
but for most of the night his
creativity was overshadowed
by his role as rhythm maker.
There was one point when I
heard the Rollins I came to
hear. Sonny began the third
tune of the set with an unac
companied solo which lasted
for 10 minutes and showed me
that Rollins never needed a
rhythm section in the first
place. His huge sandpaper
sound and his sardonic wit ap
peared as a welcome sign that
the genius and the energy that
Rollins exhibited in the late '50s
still remained — albeit cosme
tic and rusty — through all the
turns that Sonny's music have
since taken.
Today
I sincerely believe that to
day, as in the past, Sonny Rol

lins is playing the kind of music
he wants to play. His tastes
have greatly changed over the
past 20 years, but from the
standing ovation he received
as I was leaving it appears that
Rollins still knows what
everyone wants to hear.
Well, almost everyone.
Bernard Shaw once com
mented, "Reviewing has one
advantage over suicide. In
suicide you take it out of your
self: in reviewing you take it
out of other people." Today I
am going to take it out of Sonny
Rollins.
It's not like playing Cod with
Rollins would hurt his ego: he
is 48 years old (no spring chic
ken) and has been at the foref
ront of the jazz scene since he
gave up painting to take up the
saxophone 30 years ago. Grow
ing up in Harlem next door to

the likes of Coleman Hawkins
and his idol Bud Powell, Rollins
developed a big sound and lyr
ical style early in his career
which has remained a hallmark
of his playing despite later in
fluences. Of course, Rollins
was growing up during the
height of Be-bop and as he
laconicly puts it, Charlie Parker
was "our hero. He was our
leader."
Newk
In the late '50s Rollins —
nicknamed Newk — brought
forth the best of Hawkins and

Parker in a style that was un
questionably his own. His
monstrous tone and com
manding technique were cap
ped off with a strongly
rhythmic and delightfully
comic style. In 1959, at the
height of his creativity and
popularity Rollins disap
peared.
For Sonny the '60s was a
period of hide-n-seek. As he
explained in a candid interview
in 1973, "In 1959 there was a lot
of pressure on me. Also, my
health wasn't too good; I was
drinkinga whole lot, smokinga
whole lot. . . So I left to go
back and do some more music
and studying . . . and medi
tated by myself."
