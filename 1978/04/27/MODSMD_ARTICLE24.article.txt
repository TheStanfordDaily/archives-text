## Quantum-leaping at Art Museum 
### 
Recent acquisitions of the
Stanford Museum, 1974-1978,
are now on display at the Art
Gallery. The show is an attempt
to "Take stock and give
thanks" according to Museum
Director Lorez Eitner.
The exhibit of about 150 ob
jects represents the nearly 1100
works added to the museum's
permanent collection over the
past four years. The display
presents a wealth of visual ex
perience as well as historical
and cultural information. The
collection is remarkable in its
range as well as consistent at
tention to the ever elusive
thing called quality.
Funds
Included are examples of
important donations to the
Museum, such as the B.G. Can
tor collection of Rodin
sculpture and the Young col
lection of Chinese ceremonial
robes and objects. All acquisi
tions are made possible either
through donations or through
purchases by the Museum
based on funds raided by the
Committee for Art at Stanford.
The Unviersity does not con
tribute tothe Museum'scollec
tion, thus the show also re
flects the "interest and
generosity of Stanford's wider
community," according to
Eitner.
Although the Museum's
curators have attempted to
provide more than a study col
lection for scholars, the show
creates something of an ab

breviated course in art history.
If one stands in the central gal
lery of Asian art, one can
glance at a Rodin bronze
against the backdrop of Robert
Natkin's brilliantly colored
abstraction in one gallery, and
an 18th century Alpine Scene
by de Loutherberg in the next,
(uxtapose
While there is no pretense of
theme or continuity, the
exhibit successfully challenges
our preconceptions about the
definition and function of both
art and art museums. Ironi
cally, a number of modern ar
tists have attempted to create
similar perceptual quantum
leaps through performance or
conceptual art and failed. This
show broadens our perspec
tive simply by juxtaposing what
might otherwise be called trad
itional or conservative art.
In fact, it may well be the lack
of pretense that made this
show enjoyable. It was as if the
17th century Dutch painting of
a concert in a picture gallery
had come to life inviting us in
to share in the pleasure of vie
wing an acclectic grouping of
familiar and obscure artists,
subjects, and media. Too bad,
the painted lobster could not
provide a satisfactory lunch!
The show continues at the
Gallery through May 7. The Gal
lery, located near Hoover To
wer, is open from 10 a.m. to
4:45 p.m. on weekdays except
Mondays, and from 1 to 4:45
