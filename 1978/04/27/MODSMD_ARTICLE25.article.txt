## ...an underrated band 
### 
Behind the intimidating
name of the Toshiko
Akiyoshi-Lew Tabackin big
band one can find a great deal
of good music. Their concert
in Berkeley this past Friday the
band, despite some technical
problems, showed why the
Down√üeat critics poll recently
voted them as our most
underrated big band.
It has only been in the last
two years that the Akiyoshi-
Tabackin band has risen to
fame; this undoubtedly has
been due to the bands' con
tract with RCA. While many
fine groups flounder in the
obscurity of a small label, the
Akiyoshi-Tabackin band has
had the pull of a major com
pany.
Still the talents of the groups
two co-leaders have been
known to jazz cognoscenti for
years. Akiyoshi in particular
has shown herself to be one of
the prime modern examples of

the Bud Powell school of play
ing, During the first half of the
Berkeley show Toshiko did not
take one solo, but in the sec
ond half she unleashed a solo
piano version of "The Village,"
which showed that despite her
diminutive appearance she
houses a powerful and persua
sive approach to the piano.
The last few years, has seen
the emergence of several
talented female pianists, nota
bly Johanne Brackeen, Patrice
Rushen, and Barbara Carrol.
Toshiko, although not a new
comer to the world of jazz, has
shown herself to be aware of
the most modernistic styles.
Her solo work displayed her in
musical settings that she would
not have tried, nor possibly
even considered, 10 years ago.
The work of Lew Tabackin I
found less interesting. His un
accompanied version on sax of
"Body and Soul" was interest

ing, but was far too long.
Another reed player in the
band, Dick Spencer, impre
ssed me with the variety of his
attack, at times he would in
tersperse Coltrane tinged lines
into a bluesy piece. His intona
tion is excellent and his
technique seems more than
adequate.
The arrangements were ex
cellent and the performance
sensitive. I don't feel the group
has quite reached the maturity
that other critics have sensed,
but I expect their work to im
prove with each album. Bay
Area jazz fans should be thank
ful to the Berkeley Committee
for Arts and Lectures which has
presented one more fine con
cert this year. Thanks to the
committee, Berkeley has been
visited in the past few months
by the Tabackin-Akiyoshi
Band, Cecil Taylor, Keith Jar
rett, Oregon, Paul Bley and
many others.
