## A 						preview review of 'Music Man' 
### 
"The Music Man" is Meredith Willson's
long-term Broadway hit about a swindler
who cons a town in lowa and has his heart
stolen in return.
Ram's Head's current production of that
theft is the finest musical-comedy this cam
pus has produced in the past three years.
The tremendous output of both time and
effort by the cast and crew has yielded such a
fine reward that all other shows pale in the
memory.
Beth Dyrud as Marian Paroo, the town lib
rarian that the conman falls for, is in every
respect an appealing and professional per
former. Her every line, gesture and move
ment is clearly motivated and leaves no
room for doubt about what her character is
feeling.
Although I've personally seen two recent
Bay Area productions of this play and hence
might be slightly unimpressible, I can sin
cerely state that Dyrud's fine voice made

such songs as "My White Knight," "Till
There Was You," "Goodnight, my Some
one" and "Dream of Love" new both to my
ears and heart. Mark Swanson as Professor
Harold Hill, though at times lacking in vol
ume, presents a fine stage ability as he smil
ingly cons River City.
Head-on
The innovative sets of Rob Chase and
Charles Beyer are exceptional. Especially
appealing are the backdrops of the gym
nasium and library and the entire concept of
the train scene at the beginning; there a
locomotive rushes head-on towards the au
dience.
Choreography and orchestration hit what
might be an all-time on-campus high in this
production. Numbers choreographed by
Roberta Seuda and Terry Elms such as
"Shipoopi" and "Marian" utilize the entire
stage with an unrepetitive series of turns,
cartwheels, steps and leaps that delight the

heart. In the case, Pam Spira (/aneeta) and
Eric Hoit (Tommy) form an integral part of
the dancing spectacle; like in "76 Trom
bones" forexample.
Effervescent
Acting is generally fine, aside from a
slightly loose ending scene. Robert Col
eman as the gruff anvil salesman and Alexa
Cullman as Marian's Irish mother arethe two
strongest characters. Then there is the effer
vescent personality of Scott Sanford as Mar
cellus or the splendid singing of the Town
Council Quartet, not to mention the comical
malapropisms of Mayor Shin and his wife
(Richard Allen and Pam Strike).
Congratulations to director Robert
Wildeman and producer Nancy Jamison for
what will be, I am c ertain, an all-too-short,
but enthusiastically-received run at eight
each evening through Saturday with a 1:30
Saturday matinee.
