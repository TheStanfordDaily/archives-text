## On some nearly-new recordings 
### 
RICHIE FURAY — DANCE A LITTLE LIGHT
(ASYLUM)
Poor Richie Furay. All his friends are rock
and roll stars. Stephen Stills and Neil Young,
original members of the Buffalo Springfield
along with Furay, are rock and roll stars. )im
Messina, co-founder of Poco with Furay
(and also a latterday member of the
Springfield) is a rock and roll star. Even
Timmy Schmit, late of Poco and once de
stined to join Richie on rock's All Time
Obscure List, will become a full-fledged rock
and roll star when his new band, the Eagles,
puts out a record with his name in the cre
dits. So where does that leave Richie? With a
new album called Dance A Little Light and a
whole lot of explaining to do.
It would be so comforting to say that this is
a wonderful album, one that should finally
bringattention to this long underrated artist.
But this isn't the case He has been under
rated, but this record should do nothing to
dispel that. In fact, Dance A Little Light is no
different from anv of the other over
produced albums by less than awesome
singer/songwriters every day of the week, in
which we get a little reggae, a little funk,
some glossy country rock, a pointless re
make of an early sixties hit (come on, who
really wants to hear "This Magic Moment"
again), a token jazz saxaphone solo, and a
whole lot of violins. Add it all together and
you get Boredom.
Furay's one shot at a magic moment
comes on the eight minute long "Stand Your
Guard," which ends the album. All the ele

ments are there, including a harmonious a
cappella intro (reminiscent of Poco's "Sweet
Lovin' "), and solos by two of the best in
strumentalists in the business, Al Perkins
and Rusty Young. But the song falls apart at
what should be its hottest moment. The
guitar solos (electric, acoustic, pedal steel
and dobro) are featured against a backdrop
of melodramatic string charts, and the song
becomes at best a parody of Furay's finer
works.
And there have been finer works. Buffalo
Springfield's "A Child's Claim to Fame,"
Poco's "Crazy Eyes," and the Souther, Hill
man, Furay Band's "Believe Me" are all proof
that he can and has done better. Also to his
credit, he can still hit the high notes, and
remains one of only a handful of rock singers
(J.D. Souther is another) who can croon
simple, country love songs and not sound
disgusting.
Dance A Little Light is a disappointment,
but don t count Richie Furay out by any
means. There's still some good music left in
him.
JEFFERSON STARSHIP — EARTH (GRUNT)
Like Richie Furay's friends, the members
of the Jefferson Starship are rock stars, too,
and they obviously know what to do to main
tain that status. Showing us they aren't
above capitalizing on the Star Wars/Close
Encounters routine, they bring us Earth, a
gaudily packaged record of pop music at its
stalest.
The opening cut, "Love Too Good," is on
par with most TV cop show theme songs. But

at least those only last for about 60 seconds
before and after the show, while "love Too
Good" goes on for a merciless six minutes.
And it's mostly downhill from there.
The Starship has never been known for
profound lyrics, and it may not be fair to fault
them in a category where they don't pretend
to excel, but somebody had the idea to print
the words on the inside sleeve, and he or she
should be ready to pay the consequences.
"Crazy Feelin'," a rehash of the group's clas
sic "Miracles," goes something like this:
"Feelin' good feelin' high
Feel so free I want to fly
Feel the sun feel the ground
Feel it just go round and round"
Pretty heavy.
Or how about "Fire:"
"Now it's outta control
Spreadin' through my soul
It's been deliberately set
Gonna get even hotter yet"
And this is one of the most popular bands
in America.
The album is not without its highlights,
including Craig Chaquico's restrained guitar
solo on "Count On Me," Grace Slick's
stylish vocal performance on "Take Your
Time," and "Show Yourself," and the only
real rocker, "All Nite Long." But waiting for
these flashes of what this collection of fine
musicians is really capable of gets pretty
dull. Jefferson Airplane fans, if there are still
any around, should find this one pretty hard
to stomach.

solo on "Count On Me," Grace Slick's
stylish vocal performance on "Take Your
Time," and "Show Yourself," and the only
real rocker, "All Nite Long." But waiting for
these flashes of what this collection of fine
musicians is really capable of gets pretty
dull. Jefferson Airplane fans, if there are still
any around, should find this one pretty hard
to stomach.
RICHIE FURAY — DANCE A LITTLE LIGHT
(ASYLUM)
Poor Richie Furay. All his friends are rock
and roll stars. Stephen Stills and Neil Young,
original members of the Buffalo Springfield
along with Furay, are rock and roll stars. )im
Messina, co-founder of Poco with Furay
(and also a latterday member of the
Springfield) is a rock and roll star. Even
Timmy Schmit, late of Poco and once de
stined to join Richie on rock's All Time
Obscure List, will become a full-fledged rock
and roll star when his new band, the Eagles,
puts out a record with his name in the cre
dits. So where does that leave Richie? With a
new album called Dance A Little Light and a
whole lot of explaining to do.
It would be so comforting to say that this is
a wonderful album, one that should finally
bringattention to this long underrated artist.
But this isn't the case He has been under
rated, but this record should do nothing to
dispel that. In fact, Dance A Little Light is no
different from anv of the other over
produced albums by less than awesome
singer/songwriters every day of the week, in
which we get a little reggae, a little funk,
some glossy country rock, a pointless re
make of an early sixties hit (come on, who
really wants to hear "This Magic Moment"
again), a token jazz saxaphone solo, and a
whole lot of violins. Add it all together and
you get Boredom.
Furay's one shot at a magic moment
comes on the eight minute long "Stand Your
Guard," which ends the album. All the ele

ments are there, including a harmonious a
cappella intro (reminiscent of Poco's "Sweet
Lovin' "), and solos by two of the best in
strumentalists in the business, Al Perkins
and Rusty Young. But the song falls apart at
what should be its hottest moment. The
guitar solos (electric, acoustic, pedal steel
and dobro) are featured against a backdrop
of melodramatic string charts, and the song
becomes at best a parody of Furay's finer
works.
And there have been finer works. Buffalo
Springfield's "A Child's Claim to Fame,"
Poco's "Crazy Eyes," and the Souther, Hill
man, Furay Band's "Believe Me" are all proof
that he can and has done better. Also to his
credit, he can still hit the high notes, and
remains one of only a handful of rock singers
(J.D. Souther is another) who can croon
simple, country love songs and not sound
disgusting.
Dance A Little Light is a disappointment,
but don t count Richie Furay out by any
means. There's still some good music left in
him.
JEFFERSON STARSHIP — EARTH (GRUNT)
Like Richie Furay's friends, the members
of the Jefferson Starship are rock stars, too,
and they obviously know what to do to main
tain that status. Showing us they aren't
above capitalizing on the Star Wars/Close
Encounters routine, they bring us Earth, a
gaudily packaged record of pop music at its
stalest.
The opening cut, "Love Too Good," is on
par with most TV cop show theme songs. But

at least those only last for about 60 seconds
before and after the show, while "love Too
Good" goes on for a merciless six minutes.
And it's mostly downhill from there.
The Starship has never been known for
profound lyrics, and it may not be fair to fault
them in a category where they don't pretend
to excel, but somebody had the idea to print
the words on the inside sleeve, and he or she
should be ready to pay the consequences.
"Crazy Feelin'," a rehash of the group's clas
sic "Miracles," goes something like this:
"Feelin' good feelin' high
Feel so free I want to fly
Feel the sun feel the ground
Feel it just go round and round"
Pretty heavy.
Or how about "Fire:"
"Now it's outta control
Spreadin' through my soul
It's been deliberately set
Gonna get even hotter yet"
And this is one of the most popular bands
in America.
The album is not without its highlights,
including Craig Chaquico's restrained guitar
solo on "Count On Me," Grace Slick's
stylish vocal performance on "Take Your
Time," and "Show Yourself," and the only
real rocker, "All Nite Long." But waiting for
these flashes of what this collection of fine
