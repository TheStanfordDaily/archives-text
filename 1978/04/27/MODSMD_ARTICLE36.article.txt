# Annual Board of Visitors meeting to focus on practical law training
## 
### Andrea James 
About 63 politicians and lawyers
will be on campus today and tomor
row as the Law School's Board of Vis
itors attends its 20th annual meeting
here. The board's 11-member execu
tive committee arrived here yester
day.
Approximately 80 Stanford alumni
and "friends," persons who have an
interest in the University, are on the
Board, according to the School's
Asst. Dean Barbara Dray.

Among visiting board members
are Carla Hills, former secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare and a
University undergraduate alumnus
and Ernest McFarland, former
Arizona governor and chief justice
and a graduate of the Law School's
Class of '22.
Members are appointed to a
three-year term by President Richard
Lyman to "serve as an important link
between the School and its alumni
and friends" and to advise Law

School Dean Charles Meyers on
School activities and possible ways
for the School's development and
improvement.
According to Dray, this year's
meeting includes discussion on
some of the most important issues in
law, but focuses on practical training
given to law students here.
The program includes discussion
of benefits of visiting lecturers and
practitioners, counseling and
placement opportunities and
strengths of faculty and curriculum.
A report on the School's financial
condition is also scheduled.
The 1978 Herman Phleger Lecture,
to be given tonight by former U.S.
Attorney General Edward Levi, is
being held in conjunction with the
board's visit, Dray said.
She added students have been
more involved in planning this year's
meeting than they were last year
when the focus point was law faculty
and its interaction with other parts of
legal and educational communities.
Traditionally, the Board prepares
an annual report after its visit to the
School. The report should be com
pleted within about two months,
Dray said.
