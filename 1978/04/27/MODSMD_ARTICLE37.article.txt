Military base reduction proposed
Washington — Defense Secretary Harold Brown yes
terday proposed closing, reducing or consolidating 107
military bases in 30 states and said $337 million a year in
savings could be used to strengthen U.S. combat readi
ness.
The plan, already under attack from protesting con
gressmen, would result in a net reduction of 23,200 jobs
—14,600 military and 8600 civilian — in 30 states and the
District of Columbia.
Because the law requires a complicated series of
studies, many of these actions would not take effect for
months, and possibly years.
It was the Carter administration's first attempt to
streamline the military base structure, and Brown said
the actions would "insure the greatest possible effi
ciency in defense spending for the taxpayer."
The hardest hit of the 30 states would be California,
which would lose about 11,720 military and civilian posi
tions.
Brzezinski to visit mainland China
Washington — President jimmy Carter is sending his
national security adviser to mainland China next month
for consultations that will include talks on normalizing
relations with the Peking government.
Press Secretary Jody Powell said yesterday that Zbig
niew Brzezinski, Carter's assistant for national security
affairs, would be "prepared to reaffirm" the administra
tion's goal of normalizing relations with Peking. Powell
said, however, Brzezinski would not be negotiating on
the issues blocking diplomatic recognition.
Lance charged with banking fraud
Washington — Two federal agencies charged former
Budget Director Bert Lance yesterday with securities
fraud for failing to disclose his checking account over
drafts and insider loans when he was a Georgia banker.
The civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in At
lanta by the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Comptroller of the Currency also names the two
banks Lance once headed, the National Bank of Georgia
and the First National Bank of Calhoun, Ga.
The complaint alleges that Lance and the banks viol
ated securities laws before he was appointed as Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's budget director in 1973 by failing to
disclose loans to Lance's relatives and Lance's checking
account overdrafts.
Tram operation permit revoked
San Francisco — The state yesterday revoked Squaw
Valley ski resort's permit to operate the tramway on
which four people were killed and 31 injured earlier this
month.
Art Carter, chief of the state Division of Industrial
Safety, said he had a legal obligation to keep the facility
closed down "because his official investigation to date
has brought to light no definitive explanation" of what
caused the accident.
He said he therefore had no option but to revoke the
permit for the two 120-passenger cars, "until the design
and functioning of the tramway are found to be safe."
Social Security refunds estimated
Washington — A congressional panel studying financ

ing of the Social Security system got an estimate yester
day of what it would cost simply to phase it out: $1.66
trillion in refunds.
Rep. William Ketchum (R-Calif.), a member of the
House Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Sec
urity, gave the figure to the subcommittee as part of a
possible way to gradually do away with the
government-operated retirement system.
Ketchum said he is not advocating such a step, but
thinks it should be discussed along with other alterna
tives for the future of Social Security.
"It's not a proposal, but an idea," he said. "A lot of
young people are saying 'the heck with Social Security. It
will be broke when I get there.' "
