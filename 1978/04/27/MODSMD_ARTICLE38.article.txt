student co-directors has been extended until tomorrow.
They can be turned in at 590-A Old Union.
CIR correction
The word "divestment" was incorrectly used for the
word "withdrawal" in the "Lyman defends trustee vote"
story on page one in yesterday's Daily. Thearticle should
have read, "The CIR holds the view that, all other things
being equal, withdrawal is preferable," according to
Lyman.

Two more faculty members, philosophy Prof. Patrick
Suppes and Dr. Ralph Dorfman, consulting professor of
pharmacology, are among 60 U.S. scientists elected to
