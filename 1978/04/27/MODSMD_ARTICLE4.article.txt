It happens to athletes, housing as
sociates (RAs) and honors students.
Engineering majors, undeclared
freshmen and Dollies have experi
enced it. Students from every corner
of the University have received "the
letter" from the Registrar's Office
announcing their academic proba
tion. .
"The letter we send to students
simply warns that they have not been
making normal progress in ac
cumulating units," said Sally
Mahoney, registrar. "Normal" prog
ress is earning 45 units per academic
year.
When students have earned less
than 36 units by the end of the year,
or less than an average of 12 units per
quarter, they are placed on academic
probation, according to Mahoney.
"Probationary status is nothing to
be dreaded. It simply initiates com
munication between our office, a
variety of advising sources and the
student," she said.
"Often all that needs to happen is a
straightening out of priorities. The
large majority of problems causing a
student to go on probation are re
medial," Mahoney added.
The reasons are usually "one time
shots," including family or personal
difficulties, illness, resetting of
priorities, jobs and extracurricular
activities, said Mahoney. "Some
times a student has taken on a lead
ership activity for the first time and
hasn't realized the necessity of plan
ning his or her time accordingly."
Mahoney cited "lack of commit
ment" as a fairly common reason
why students have not earned the
normal unit load. "If students do not
have a firm commitment to the area
of study, they won't put as much
energy into the program," she said.
"Sometimes when students have
transferred from schools on the

semester system, the quarter system
finals surprise them at a time when
they would have otherwise just
started studying for midterms,"
Mahoney commented.
"Most students, when placed on
academic probation, have problems
that can easily be corrected with the
proper counseling," said Mahoney.
"Academic probation enables us to
catch people who need to be ad
vised."
Mahoney explained that a student
on probation meets with a counselor
in the Dean of Student Affairs Office.
Together with the student's adviser,
they discuss the student's academic
program looking for unrealistic work
loads.
"Unfortunately, students some
times take a class without having pas
sed or finished an incomplete in the
prerequisite. Or their financial aids
package may include an internship
somewhere that requires an exces
sive amount of traveling time," she
said.
Mahoney added problems are
usually corrected, either by read
justment of financial aid, or by a
more comprehensive look at the
student's study schedule and
academic goals.
If, however, a student on proba
tion does not finish 12 units he goes
on to provisioned status. "At this
point we again critique the program
of study and discuss with the student
the potential fora successful quarter.
Some students stop out at this point,
usually returning with new perspec
tives or sense of discipline,"
Mahoney said.
She added only 1 or 2 per cent of
the students placed on probation fail
to graduate for academic reasons.
There have been cases when stu
dents did not know why they re
ceived warning from the Registrar's
Office. "We are only as accurate as

our records," Mahoney said.
She suggested students check with
the office if there is any question be
cause sometimes the problem con
cerns incompletes which are not
counted on the record or drop/add
cards that were not received.
She also advised students to be
wary of accumulating incompletes
because "they require as much work
as a regular class."
"Communicate with the student
advisers. And ask for help when you
need it," recommended Mahoney.
"Notice of academic probation sim
ply draws a student's attention to
what may or may not be a potential
problem for their academic career —
a problem which almost always can
be corrected."

cumulating units," said Sally
Mahoney, registrar. "Normal" prog
ress is earning 45 units per academic
year.
When students have earned less
than 36 units by the end of the year,
or less than an average of 12 units per
quarter, they are placed on academic
probation, according to Mahoney.
"Probationary status is nothing to
be dreaded. It simply initiates com
munication between our office, a
variety of advising sources and the
student," she said.
"Often all that needs to happen is a
straightening out of priorities. The
large majority of problems causing a
student to go on probation are re
medial," Mahoney added.
The reasons are usually "one time
shots," including family or personal
difficulties, illness, resetting of
priorities, jobs and extracurricular
activities, said Mahoney. "Some
times a student has taken on a lead
ership activity for the first time and
hasn't realized the necessity of plan
ning his or her time accordingly."
Mahoney cited "lack of commit
ment" as a fairly common reason
why students have not earned the
normal unit load. "If students do not
have a firm commitment to the area
of study, they won't put as much
energy into the program," she said.
"Sometimes when students have
transferred from schools on the

semester system, the quarter system
finals surprise them at a time when
they would have otherwise just
started studying for midterms,"
Mahoney commented.
"Most students, when placed on
academic probation, have problems
that can easily be corrected with the
proper counseling," said Mahoney.
"Academic probation enables us to
catch people who need to be ad
vised."
Mahoney explained that a student
on probation meets with a counselor
in the Dean of Student Affairs Office.
Together with the student's adviser,
they discuss the student's academic
program looking for unrealistic work
loads.
"Unfortunately, students some
times take a class without having pas
sed or finished an incomplete in the
prerequisite. Or their financial aids
package may include an internship
somewhere that requires an exces
sive amount of traveling time," she
said.
Mahoney added problems are
usually corrected, either by read
justment of financial aid, or by a
more comprehensive look at the
student's study schedule and
academic goals.
If, however, a student on proba
tion does not finish 12 units he goes
on to provisioned status. "At this
point we again critique the program
of study and discuss with the student
the potential fora successful quarter.
Some students stop out at this point,
usually returning with new perspec
tives or sense of discipline,"
Mahoney said.
She added only 1 or 2 per cent of
the students placed on probation fail
to graduate for academic reasons.
There have been cases when stu
dents did not know why they re
ceived warning from the Registrar's
Office. "We are only as accurate as

our records," Mahoney said.
She suggested students check with
the office if there is any question be
cause sometimes the problem con
cerns incompletes which are not
counted on the record or drop/add
cards that were not received.
She also advised students to be
wary of accumulating incompletes
because "they require as much work
as a regular class."
"Communicate with the student
advisers. And ask for help when you
need it," recommended Mahoney.
"Notice of academic probation sim
ply draws a student's attention to
what may or may not be a potential
problem for their academic career —
a problem which almost always can
be corrected."
It happens to athletes, housing as
sociates (RAs) and honors students.
Engineering majors, undeclared
freshmen and Dollies have experi
enced it. Students from every corner
of the University have received "the
letter" from the Registrar's Office
announcing their academic proba

"The letter we send to students
simply warns that they have not been

cumulating units," said Sally
Mahoney, registrar. "Normal" prog
ress is earning 45 units per academic
year.
