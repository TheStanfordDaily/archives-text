# Diplomat shares experiences
## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
Philip Habib, former undersecret
ary of state, recently arrived here to
serve as a visiting political science
lecturer for the 1978-79 academic
year.
His position here is part of the
federally-funded Diplomat-in-
Residence program. Habib said this
program helps officials by placing
them in an intellectual community. It
also gives university students the
opportunity to work with practically
experienced statesmen.
According to Habib, the program,
which has been running for a
number of years, has been very suc
cessful.
After Habib suffered a "bad spell
physically," his physician recom
mended he resign from his position
as undersecretary of state, which he
held in both the Ford and Carter ad
ministrations.
"I loved the involvement with
political activity, but my doctor or
dered me to get out of the pressure
cooker," Habib said. Habib sub
sequently resigned his post and be
came involved in the Diplomat-in-
Residence program.
"Stanford offered the kind of as
sociation I was looking for," Habib
said. He added he likes the Peninsula
area and the good weather here al
lows him to exercise year-round.
"The campus is intellectually
alive," he also commented.
Habib will teach advanced under
graduates and graduates in the polit-

ical science department, according
to Political Science Prof. Robert
Ward.
His planned classes include Prac
tice of Contemporary American Dip
lomacy, Case Studies of Contempor
ary American Diplomacy and Negoti
ation: Potentiality and Constituency,
said Ward.
Habib agreed enrollment in his
classes should be limited to about 20
to 25 students who have sufficient
backgrounds in political science and
who express genuine interest.
In addition to teaching, Habib will
deliver lectures around campus. He
has already given several lectures,
and has four or five more scheduled.
He said in order to avoid overbur-

dening himself, he must pick and
choose his speaking engagements,
but he has yet to turn down any stu
dent requests.
"I don't like to lecture too long,"
he said. "I usually speak for 20 or 25
minutes to leave time for discus
sion."
"I think I can give something only
experience can provide," Habib de
clared.
"To participate in the transition
from Ford to Carter at the level I was
at was infinitely fascinating and re
warding," he said.
In his dealings with problems in
the Middle East, Soviet Union and
China, Habib said he learned, "You
must go to the fundamental element
of the problem in order to solve it."
He emphasized that while a success
ful diplomat must live these experi
ences, he must also make mistakes.
"I don't come out of the academic
process, I come out of a mental pro
cess," Habib said. "I like the expo
sure to the students, and if someone
wants to discuss a current problem, I
can offer some practical experi
ence."
Habib said it's too soon to tell what
he'll do after his year here, but added
he still has his career with the foreign
service and he'll be up for assign
ment.
Habib said he finds teaching and
association with students an interest
ing challenge, and commented, "I'm
not here to make news, I'm here to
be a part of the campus."
