Traumas, broken bones, acne and
gynecological problems are the most
frequent ailments treated at Cowell
Student Health Center, according to
James McClenahan, director of stu
dent health services.
Infectious diseases, sprains, lacer
ations and poison oak are other ail
ments which force about 80 per cent
of all University students to be admit
ted to Cowell at least once during
their years here. Another 8 per cent
use the Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services (CAPS), located at Cow
ell and at Huston House.
"Students don't tend to over
utilize the facilities," McClenahan
said.
Cowell provides outpatient and in
firmary care, laboratory testing,
x-rays, physical therapy and counsel
ing. Because of contract obligations,
cases involving surgery and special

consultation are referred to the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic (PAMC).
About 150 to 200 patients are
treated daily at Cowell. Staff includes
six physicians, one resident, three
nurse practitioners, one physical
therapist and four technicians for al
lergy, x-ray and laboratory work.
"We've been lucky to be able to
attract quality physicians to Cowell,"
McClenahan said.
He cited the University's medical
reputation, pleasant location and
strong University support as attrac
tive features.
The CAPS staff is composed of five
psychiatrists, three psychologists,
four clinical social workers and one
psychometrist. They represent di
verse ethnic, age and social
backgrounds, said CAPS Director
David Dorosin.
"Most people (staff) here have had
broad experience in the University

community," observed Dorosin.
CAPS trains contraceptive coun
selors and operates peer counseling
programs for the Bridge, Career
Planning and Placement Center and
house associates (RAs). Other out
reach activities involve liaisons with
dorms, Bechtel International Center
and Office of Student Affairs.
Dorosin said he believes a consid
erable amount of trust exists bet
ween CAPS staff and the community.
"Students mainly use CAPS for
help with predicaments rather than
conditions," said Dorosin. "We
mostly talk things out and emphasize
openness and clarification."
"Health service facilities at other
schools cover a very wide spectrum
in offerings," said McClenahan. "It
varies from one part-time nurse to a
full registered hospital.
"We're about as complete as any
other health service," he added.

According to Raymond Bacchetti,
vice provost for budget and plan
ning, Cowell's $1,657,000 budget for
1977-78 is funded mainly by general
funds. Approximately $300,000 is
spent inside the center while the rest
covers referral charges and salaries
for PAMC physicians who are con
tracted to work for Cowell.
About $40 of each student's quar
terly tuition goes to the health ser
vice through general funds,
McClenahan said.
"It sounds like a lot of money by
itself," McClenahan added, "though
if you put it in the perspective of an
insurance premium, you can get
quite a bit for your money.
"A study done a few years ago
showed that for the average student
the health service was less expensive
than in-town service," explained
McClenahan.
