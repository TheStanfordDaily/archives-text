# Why we are a movement
## Washington is not enough 
### 
Ellen Byrne

The scene is Thanksgiving, 1977.
We are in a suburb on the heels of
Denver, Colorado. Three young
people are sitting up talking in the
living room. The two women are sis
ters, the older sister is married to the
man. Their nine-year-old daughter is
asleep in her bedroom under a
splendid white lace canopy.
The discussion topic: the National
Women's Conference in Houston.
Man: "What I don't understand is
why you need a movement. The real
power lies in places where women
are accepted now. You can be doc
tors, lawyers, executives."
Older sister: "But that doesn't
necessarily give us power. Itcertainly
doesn't mean that men will treat me
like an equal on the job. Your lawyer
friends don't respect women
lawyers."
Younger sister: "An important part
of feminism for me is changing
peoples' attitudes about what
women are supposed to do or be. I
want control over my own body and
sexuality, too. I can't get that by
going to Washington and being a
senator."
Man: "What do you mean, control
over your body and sexuality?"
Younger sister: (now aware that
she is getting into touchy ground)
"To have my body belong to me and
to be able to make my own decisions
about what I do with it. In a simple
way, I mean the right to be bisexual,
straight, gay — or asexual."
Man: (getting irritated) "What
does gay liberation have to do with
feminism?"
This column will discuss les
bianism. It doesn't represent the
views of any one lesbian, and there
may be lesbians who will read the
whole article and find nothing to
agree with.
No typical lesbian
There is no typical lesbian. Being
gay is something most lesbians see as
a natural part of themselves. It hasn't
been grafted onto their lives by polit
ical choice, rebellion or personal in
securities. A woman doesn't become
gay because she didn't meet the right
man.
Lesbians are not men haters; they
do love women and find their emo
tional and sexual experiences with
other women to be more intense and
satisfying than relations with men.
That's fine, you say. All right by
me. Just so they keep to themselves.
This, however, is precisely the

reason why I (younger sister) was try
ing to explain to my brother-in-law
that going to Washington was not
enough.
There are already lesbians in
Washington. There are lesbians
teaching our children, painting
houses, writing books and running
businesses. The problem is that as
sumptions and attitudes of other
people keep them from coming out
or making their lives more public.
Inhibiting attitudes
The first sort of attitude that keeps
lesbians (and gay men, of course) in a
secret existence is the idea that
everyone is heterosexual by prefer
ence.
I don't know how much people
can be blamed for this — our media,
our parents and our schools con
stantly deluge us with the ideal of
men and women finding ultimate
happiness in each other. Marriage
perpetuates the idea of a sacred love
between men and women that can't
be shared between people of the
same sex.
The problem with the assumption,
"Everyone is straight unless they're
weird, and in that case they'll tell
me," is that it denies a gay person's
reality. The absolute insensitivity to
another person's life and signals
places the burden constantly on the
lesbian or gay man to come out, to
explain themselves.
The tolerant liberalism of "just
don't be blatant," is a doubly
dangerous attitude. It assumes that
lesbians can and should be happy to
segregate their life from the rest of
"us." Such an attitude also stems
from a type of paternal complacency
that we see on bathroom walls all the
time: "Well, if you have to do it, all
right, but I know that I'm where it's
really at — straightest is greatest."
Secret lives
What does it mean when lesbians
are told to be secret about who they
love and live with? First of all, let's
consider how important the social
realm is for most of us. It extends into
our jobs, where we live, our access to
political clout and many other things.
When lesbians are discriminated
against in this way, they face limited
choices if they are honest about their
lives, and people who respect them
selves don't want to lie about them
selves.
The second side to the liberal coin
of tolerance is the result that lesbians
have to deal with others trying to

change their sexuality all the time —
contrary to the notion that gays "re
cruit" innocent heterosexuals. They
are analyzed; "What went wrong?",
they are patronized; "Let me fix it,"
and they are mystified; "What do
you do?"
A final effect of these attitudes is a
shortchanging of lesbians' anger.
Women who have struggled because
they are female and lesbian are not
benign sweet creatures. They have
certain angers and insights. They do
threaten the dominant relationship
of men and women in this society,
because they are finding satisfying
and constructive ways to interact
without sex roles — or men.
So, as I tried to explain to my
brother-in-law, and as many women
have explained to me since, going to
Washington isn't all it takes to give
women, lesbians, (or gay men and
other minorities) their equal share of
power.
Finally, the relationship of
feminism and lesbianism remains
complex and subject to many in
terpretations within the movement.
Many women need to question their
own assumptions about lesbianism.
But all women, together, are subject
to many attitudes and assumptions
that take our power away.
