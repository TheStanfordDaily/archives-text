TIONS WE INVITE YOUR INQUIRY.
Our company manufactures and markets the TSP Model 100 Digital Tele
phone. This device, installed in any tie trunk or PBX system, is an 8080
microprocessor based voice digitizer which allows two or more people to
converse in real time, full duplex with their 4kHz voices transmitted digitally at
2400 bps. This high quality voice compression (DRT score of 92.1) is ac
complished thru use of linear predictive coding (LPC). By multiplexing into a
9600 bps modem up to four voice channels can be created from a single
leased telephone line. Our customers enjoy significant cost savings and
increased communication security.
ENGINEERING RESEARCH
Design and develop future digital Working under Dr. John Parker Byg to
speech and other related communi- develop improved speech quality compres
cation equipment. Positions are sion through use of maximum entropy
\ available in: spectral analysis and LPC techniques.
\ it will involve speech analysis and
V" "N Digital Circuit Design synthesis using minicomputer systems.
Other areas of research interest are
Microcomuters cryptography, PCM and APM speech
digitization, and the development of con-
Data Communications trollers for digital speech transmission
networks. You should have the equiva-
