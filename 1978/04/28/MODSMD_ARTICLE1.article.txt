# Goldenkranz slate wins COP run-off election
## 
### Monika Guttman 
The Andrew Goldenkranz slate won the ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP) race yesterday with 53.2
per cent of the vote. The George Drysdale slate came
in close behind, with 46.8 per cent.
In the senior class presidents run-off, the Breck
slate won with 58 per cent of the vote, while the
Wachtel slate received 42 per cent.
The results were announced yesterday afternoon
by ASSU Elections Commissioner Sean Murphy. The
official results will not be known until the overseas
ballots are tabulated sometime Monday, Murphy
said.
Members of the winning Goldenkranz COP slate
include Regina Petty, Fred Estes and Mary Morimoto.
The victorious senior class president state is com
posed of Amy Breck, Lewis Butler, Leslie Crozier and
Tony Peet.
Overall, voter turnout for both races was higher
than in last week's election. There were 2410 votes
cast for this week's COP election, compared with
2092 votes last week. Similarly, 619 students voted in
this week's senior class presidents run-off, as com
pared to 575 in the first election.
"Another week of exposure helps voter turnout,"
said Goldenkranz. "Also, this time there were only
two things to vote on. I was glad to see that more
people voted," he added.
"Part of the high turnout was the added coverage
the Daily gave the election," said Petty, "and part of it
was that we've been going door to door for so long,"
she said.
The Goldenkranz slate was pleased with its suc
cess, although each member said the election

"wasn't easy."
"Campaigning is fun for awhile," said Golden
kranz, "but it gets tiring."
Goldenkranz added that he felt the election should
have had a different focus.
"I was very sorry to see it turn into a personality
war," he said. "It should have concentrated more on
the issues."
Members of the Drysdale slate said they felt that
the voter turnout still wasn't sufficient.
"We congratulate the Goldenkranz slate and we
respect all its members. They are well qualified and
dedicated. We hope, however, that they can fairly
represent the whole of the University community
even though elected by a small percentage of it,"the
members said in a prepared statement.
Peet said his winning senior class president slate
was "very happy" to have won.
"But if anybody else was going to win," he said,
"we would have wanted them (the Wachtel slate) to
win. All of us have very high respect for them. They
deserve a lot of credit."
The most immediate concern of the members of
the new COP will be "learning the ropes," according
to Estes.
"First, the results will have to be certified," he said
"Then we plan to tackle the issues we discussed in
our campaign."
The ASSU Senate will certify the results of the elec
tions on May 8, at which time the new COP slate will
be officially installed.
"This is a transition period," said Goldenkranz.
"Hopefully we will know enough by the trustee meet
ing of May 10."

the issues."
Members of the Drysdale slate said they felt that
the voter turnout still wasn't sufficient.
"We congratulate the Goldenkranz slate and we
respect all its members. They are well qualified and
dedicated. We hope, however, that they can fairly
represent the whole of the University community
even though elected by a small percentage of it,"the
members said in a prepared statement.
Peet said his winning senior class president slate
was "very happy" to have won.
"But if anybody else was going to win," he said,
"we would have wanted them (the Wachtel slate) to
win. All of us have very high respect for them. They
deserve a lot of credit."
The most immediate concern of the members of
the new COP will be "learning the ropes," according
to Estes.
"First, the results will have to be certified," he said
"Then we plan to tackle the issues we discussed in
our campaign."
The ASSU Senate will certify the results of the elec
tions on May 8, at which time the new COP slate will
be officially installed.
"This is a transition period," said Goldenkranz.
"Hopefully we will know enough by the trustee meet
ing of May 10."

yesterday's run-off election against the George Drysdalt
slate.
The Andrew Goldenkranz slate won the ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP) race yesterday with 53.2
per cent of the vote. The George Drysdale slate came
in close behind, with 46.8 per cent.
In the senior class presidents run-off, the Breck
slate won with 58 per cent of the vote, while the
Wachtel slate received 42 per cent.
The results were announced yesterday afternoon
by ASSU Elections Commissioner Sean Murphy. The
official results will not be known until the overseas
ballots are tabulated sometime Monday, Murphy
said.
Members of the winning Goldenkranz COP slate
include Regina Petty, Fred Estes and Mary Morimoto.
The victorious senior class president state is com
posed of Amy Breck, Lewis Butler, Leslie Crozier and
Tony Peet.
Overall, voter turnout for both races was higher
than in last week's election. There were 2410 votes
cast for this week's COP election, compared with
2092 votes last week. Similarly, 619 students voted in
this week's senior class presidents run-off, as com
pared to 575 in the first election.
"Another week of exposure helps voter turnout,"
said Goldenkranz. "Also, this time there were only
two things to vote on. I was glad to see that more
people voted," he added.
"Part of the high turnout was the added coverage
the Daily gave the election," said Petty, "and part of it
was that we've been going door to door for so long,"
she said.
The Goldenkranz slate was pleased with its suc
cess, although each member said the election

"wasn't easy."
"Campaigning is fun for awhile," said Golden
kranz, "but it gets tiring."
Goldenkranz added that he felt the election should
have had a different focus.
"I was very sorry to see it turn into a personality
war," he said. "It should have concentrated more on
the issues."
