Happy ending harmful
Now that "Holocaust" has finished
playing on T.V. I would like to re
mind people of the astute point that
Angela Davis made: The happy end
ing is most dangerous, for it suggests
that the problems of racism are over.
Far from it — it is extremely danger
ous because of its lulling effect. Here
at Stanford, for instance, the bath
room walls in Meyer are covered
with swastikas and "Gas the Jews"
slogans; the coffee house tables
have swastikas carved in them. Ra
cism is alive!
All minorities — Jews, blacks, gays,
etc. — have everything to lose by
present-day apathy. The only way to
keep the horror of Nazi Germany
from crossing the Atlantic is to rec
ognize that racism is prevalent in the
U.S. today, and to do your part in
combatting it.
