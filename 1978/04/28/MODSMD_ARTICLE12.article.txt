The sun. "The world's only
inexhaustible, egalitarian,
non-polluting, safe, terrorist
resistant energy source," says
Denis Hayes, organizer of Sun
Day.
Founder of the 1970 Earth
Day movement, the Stanford
alumnus has planned the May 3
event as a celebration of the
coming of the solar age.
All 50 states and 31 countries
will participate in the project.
Beginning next Wednesday, a
series of solar-related activities
will be open to the public in the
Stanford area.
On May 3, the Stanford
Energy Conservation Center
(ECC) and Stanford Workshop
on Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI) 175 class will spon
sor a noontime "off-it" hour.
"We are trying to get people
to go outside during lunch
hour and turn off everything
that they deem unnecessary
for that one hour," said Karl
Johnson, director of ECC. A
similar trial effort was made last
year with a very positive out

come, Johnson added.
"It was so successful; I was
really impressed. What it
showed was an amazing com
munity willingness to do some
thing. In this case it was short
lived, but it showed the poten
tial," Johnson commented.
Last year's off-it hour re
sulted in a 14 per cent reduc
tion in campus electricity use
during the noontime hour.
"Johnson hopes to establish the
off-it hour as a regular occurr
ence to illustrate that energy
waste can be reduced.
"I hope to make it more than
a publicity stunt, to start get
ting people more aware," he
added.
Volunteers are needed to
shut off unneeded lights and
appliances and should meet in
front of the SWOPSI office be
fore noon. People can also
help out on their own, he said.
Also on Wednesday, both
the University and the Stanford
Shopping Center will offer dis
plays on solar energy. On
campus, tours will be offered
of Roth House solar heating

system and mechanical en
gineering systems. In addition,
student projects in White Plaza
can be viewed from 11 a.m. to 2
p.m. Various solar system will
be explained, including solar
ovens from Fisher Sun Cook
ers.
At the shopping center, over
a dozen companies will be rep
resented, including solar
equipment manufacturers
Pacific Sun, Alten, Western
Energy and Sunburst. The dis
plays are open from 10a.m. to 6
p.m.
Transportation to the shop
ping center will be provided by
Marguerite buses running
from Tresidder Union and

transferring at the Medical
Center.
On May 6, Donald Aitken,
director of the Center for Solar
Energy Applications at San Jose
State University will narrate a
slide show. Entitled "Solar
Energy, Emerging
Perspectives," the presenta
tion will be held in Cubberley
Auditorium at 7:30 p.m.
Activities for Sunday include
another open house at the
shopping center from noon to
5 p.m. and tours of solar homes
in Bay Area communities. Loca
tions of the buildings are
posted around campus or can
be obtained from ECC. Tours
are scheduled from 1 to 6 p.m.

The sun. "The world's only
inexhaustible, egalitarian,
non-polluting, safe, terrorist
resistant energy source," says
Denis Hayes, organizer of Sun
Day.
Founder of the 1970 Earth
Day movement, the Stanford
alumnus has planned the May 3
event as a celebration of the
coming of the solar age.
All 50 states and 31 countries
will participate in the project.
Beginning next Wednesday, a
series of solar-related activities
will be open to the public in the
Stanford area.
On May 3, the Stanford
Energy Conservation Center
(ECC) and Stanford Workshop
on Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI) 175 class will spon
sor a noontime "off-it" hour.
"We are trying to get people
to go outside during lunch
hour and turn off everything
that they deem unnecessary
for that one hour," said Karl
Johnson, director of ECC. A
similar trial effort was made last
year with a very positive out

come, Johnson added.
"It was so successful; I was
really impressed. What it
showed was an amazing com
munity willingness to do some
thing. In this case it was short
lived, but it showed the poten
tial," Johnson commented.
Last year's off-it hour re
sulted in a 14 per cent reduc
tion in campus electricity use
during the noontime hour.
"Johnson hopes to establish the
off-it hour as a regular occurr
ence to illustrate that energy
waste can be reduced.
"I hope to make it more than
a publicity stunt, to start get
ting people more aware," he
added.
Volunteers are needed to
shut off unneeded lights and
appliances and should meet in
front of the SWOPSI office be
fore noon. People can also
help out on their own, he said.
Also on Wednesday, both
the University and the Stanford
Shopping Center will offer dis
plays on solar energy. On
campus, tours will be offered
of Roth House solar heating

system and mechanical en
gineering systems. In addition,
student projects in White Plaza
can be viewed from 11 a.m. to 2
p.m. Various solar system will
be explained, including solar
ovens from Fisher Sun Cook
ers.
