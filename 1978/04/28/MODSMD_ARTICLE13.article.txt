# Humanists more specialized

### Ben Pollock 
An analysis of course en
rollments, conducted by the
undergraduate studies office,
shows that humanities majors
are more specialized than
natural science majors.
On the average, humanities
majors take 7 per cent of their
courses in natural sciences,
but natural sciences majors
take 18 per cent of their classes
in humanities, according to the
analysis.
Data for the study was col
lected last year.
Herant Katchadourian, dean
of undergraduate studies, said
recently, "To say that our stu
dents should obtain a more
broadly based general educa
tion when in fact we mean
more humanities is mislead
ing.
"At least in the case of Stan
ford students, an even-handed
broadening of the under
graduate experience would
mean having our humanities
majors study more natural sci
ences than vice-versa."
This situation may have been
caused by faculty holding dif
ferent definitions of well

roundedness, according to Bill
Washburn of the under
graduate studies office. "Some
definitions are general, while
some are quite rigorous," he
said.
A moderate view, to
Washburn, would be to divide
departments into three sec
tions: humanities, natural sci
ences and social sciences. A
well-rounded student would
specialize in one area, but take
courses in the other areas.
According to the study,
humanities majors obtain 52
percent of theirenrollments in
their own field, 12 per cent in
the social sciences, and 7 per
cent in the natural sciences.
The remaining 29 per cent
came from extra-departmental
sources such as transfer credit
and overseas study.
Students majoring in social
sciences take 39 per cent of
their units in social sciences, 25
per cent in humanities, and 9
per cent in natural sciences.
Natural science majors have
41 per cent of their classes in
the natural sciences, 12 per
cent in the social sciences, and
18 per cent in the humanities.
