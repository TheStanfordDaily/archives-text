# Law yearbook withdraws photo
## 
### Andrea James 
After several discussions
with Law School adminis
trators, the editor of the Law
School yearbook has decided
to withdraw publication of a
photograph which shows a
sign in a student carrel saying
"Fuck the Law."
Chris Burdick, yearbook
editor, said the problem was
not censorship, but funding.
She said Law School Dean
Charles Meyers told another
staff member he would not in
crease funds for the yearbook
if the organization lost money
from contributions.
Although the Law School
now contributes only about
one-sixth of the book's fund
ing, private contributors sup
port about two-thirds of the
book, Burdick said.
"The photo took up about
one-third of a full yearbook
page," she said. "Even leafing
through it, nobody would miss
it, and all our contributors get a
complimentary copy."
Meyers found out about the
photograph after it had already
been approved by several staff
members and submitted to
Herff-Jones Yearbook Com
pany for publication. Laura
Anderson, customer service
adviser for Herff-Jones, wrote a
letter to the Dean saying the
photograph could be consi
dered offensive.
Anderson said she was
merely "taking orders" from
her boss.

"I would have preferred to
write to the yearbook editor or
have the yearbook salesman
take care of the problem," she
said. "But my boss told me to
make sure the people in-the
know knew about it."
Anderson's superior is Tom
Rittersbacher, customer ser
vice manager. Anderson said
Rittersbacher "didn't want any
backlash from Stanford Law
School administrators."
Burdick said the staff had
many discussions on the issue.
"Certain staff members
threatened to quit if we ran
the photo, others threatened
to quit if we didn't," she said.
"One student felt there would
be serious repercussions if we
ran the photo and didn't want
anything to do with the book."
Mike Jehle, who resigned
from his co-editor position
after the photo issue was
raised, agreed the problem
"was not one of censorship,"
but added he felt the photo
was in a "tasteful place.
"It was in the front 20 to 30
pages and we'd just showed
pictures of students studying. I
felt it really showed the at
titude of many students after
they've been studying for sev
eral hours."
Jehle said there were other
factors besides the photo
which led him to resign his pos
ition. He said at the time he
left, the staff had no concensus
of opinion.
