Somebody told me that apple seeds have ar
senic in them. I've been eating entire apples
(including the cores) for about two years now.
Am I slowly killing myself?
-E.A.C.
According to Dr. lames Embree at the Univer
sity of California San Francisco Department of
Toxicology, arsenic is found in soil. Small
amounts of it are transported into most seeds or
other parts of plants.
In apple seeds specifically, there are between
.042 and 1.7 parts of arsenic per million. This is
not a large amount and certainly not enough to
kill you. Nevertheless, it wouldn't hurt you to
stop eating them.

It would be nice to see a map of the campus
and hills on which runs of various lengths are
mapped and distances given. Has anyone ever
undertaken such a project?
-C.M.
There does not seem to be any one map of all
the runs in the local area, or any one place on
campus where you can find such information.
There are however a number of maps available
from different sources on campus.
The Angel Field Ancients, a faculty-staff run
ning club, usually has at least one map of a run
posted on their bulletin board in EncinaCym. At
present they have a 20 mile run called "The
Double Ghetto" posted.
Another source of information is Kathy
Daggett, conditioning and swimming teacher.
She draws up and posts various maps of runs on
her door (room nine) in Roble Gym. She also has
schedules posted of when different "fun runs"
in the area are being held.
Wesley Ruff, chairman of P.E. and Recreation,
also has some maps he said he would be happy
to photostat for you.
The general consensus however, seems to be
that the best way to find out about runs is from

other runners. According to Alan Waterman,
professor in Electrical Engineering and en
thusiastic member of the Stanford Running
Club, Stanford runners meet daily at noon in
Angel Field for a mid-day run.

As a very recent Stanford graduate and
Lifetime Member of the Alumni Association,
what privileges and facilities am I entitled to take
advantage of on campus with my Alumni Associ
ation Membership? I am living nearby and fre
quently am on campus.
-S.S.
The Stanford Alumni Association is an inde
pendent organization which runs its own pro
grams. Some of these change from year to year.
However, William Stone, director of the Alumni
Association told me some of the current pro
grams. The Association offers continuing educa
tion programs (e.g. the publishing seminar this
summer) and organizes seminars and academic
programs. They publish the Stanford Magazine
and Almanac, run travel programs, and manage
the ski lodge at Alpine Meadows. Reunions and
club programs are also organized through the
Alumni office.
However, since the Association is indepen
dent, your membership does not allow you to
use many of the campus facilities. Alumni mem
bers must pay fees in order to use the library.
Other facilities, such as the pool complex and
the golf course, are only open to current stu
dents, faculty, and staff. (That means no
alumni!). If you wish to use these, or any other
facility on campus where IDs are checked, you'll
need to register as a student, or get a job here.
I'd suggest the latter, it might be more difficult
to do, but it would certainly be cheaper.
