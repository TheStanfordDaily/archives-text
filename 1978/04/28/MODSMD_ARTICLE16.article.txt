# Chavez hints at Gallo Boycott

### 
Fresno (AP) — United Farm Workers President
Cesar Chavez demanded yesterday that Gallo
Winery be ordered to negotiate with his union
or he may resume the boycott.
Chavez said the state Agricultural Labor Rela
tions Board should grant the UFW a bargaining
order for Gallo field workers because of "mas
sive law violations" during campaigning for the
1975 representation election.
He termed a bargaining order the only way the
UFW can avoid years of hearings and litigation
over the 1975 vote.
"Short of that (the bargaining order), there is
no way this union can be made whole because
of the massive law violations," Chavez said at a
press conference here. "If they don't order the
bargaining order, maybe we'll have to go back to
the national boycott."
Chavez ended the boycott of Gallo wines,

table grapes and lettuce last January, saying the
state's 1975 Agricultural Labor Relations Act had
been effective in letting field workers vote on
union representation.
But he called Callo "the biggest union buster
in California" before testifying at a hearing on
unfair labor practices charges against the com
pany.
Chavez also said legal actions could drag on
for years before the union wins recognition un
less a bargaining order is granted.
"Every day, Callo profits by not having a un
ion," Chavez said.
Callo spokesmen were unavailable for im
mediate comment, but the winery has con
tended in the past that surveillance, including
taking photographs, was not harassment but
was aimed at showing that the UFW was pro
vided access before the election.
