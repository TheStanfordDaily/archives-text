# Trustees respond to CIR with reasons for opposing Texaco withdrawal
## 
### 
Following is an April 27 letter to Prof Frederick
Hillier, chairman of Commission on Investment
Responsibility from Dr Peter Bing, president of the
Board of Trustees:
This letter comes to inlorm you and the other Com
mission members of the actions taken by the Board of
Trustees with respect to proxy actions recommended by the
CIR on April 12, 1978 All the Board actions to date are
summarized in the attached table
In those issues decided so far this year, the Board's
actions are consistent with the CIR recommendations in 7 of
11 cases However, before discussing the reasoning which
led to each of the most recent proxy decisions, it might be
useful to note a fundamental difference in approach between
the Board and the CIR which may help to explain those
differences which have occurred
In the Board's policy guidelines promulgated last
December (which also established the CIR), it is stated that
when the Trustees conclude that a company's activities
cause substantial social injury, and when a stockholder
proposal would eliminate or materially reduce the sub
stantial social injury, the University will support the proposal
In the ClR's policy recommendations, published in April,
the CIR favored a policy of corporate withdrawal from South
Africa unless two of three conditions had been met 1) an
nounced corporate willingness to work openly for abrogation
of discriminatory laws in South Africa, 2) concentration on
the production of goods and services in South Africa which
would not be readily available to the government for
repressive purposes, 3) exceptional corporate progress in
recent years in socially affirmative action South Africa
In short, the CIR has proceeded on an assumption of
withdrawal unless exceptional requirements have been met,
while the Board has reserved the withdrawal option for those
cases in which a corporation's actions in South Africa are
causing substantial social injury This fundamental dif
ference in approach partly underlies the divergence bet
ween CIR recommendations and Board actions
Let me deal first and at greatest length with the Texaco
resolutions on withdrawal from South Africa, and in
vestigation of oil transhipments from South Africa to
Rhodesia
With respect to withdrawal, the Board did not find con
vincing evidence that Caltex has acted irresponsibly in South
Africa ClR's report quotes the Investor Responsibility
Research Center conclusion that "Caltex does have a
relatively good employment record in South Africa It was
one of the first companies to raise the minimum wage level
above the supplemented subsistence level; it was also one of
the earliest to place Africans in sales positions, as truck
drivers delivering supplies to rural areas. It provides equal
pay for equal work and has underway a large-scale training
program designed to give coloreds and Africans sufficient
training to allow them to replace white workers in refinery
positions."
Although that same report cites certain areas in which
Caltex has made only limited progress, it was the Board's
conclusion, from the IRRC and from detailed reports from
Texaco, that Caltex is much closer to the top of the social
responsibility list in South Africa than it is to the bottom.
The Board also disagrees with the CIR conclusion that
Caltex's expansion of its Milnerton refinery represents an
"expansionist policy" today. That plant, which is just being
completed, was started three years ago Planning for it was
accomplished years before that
The Board's letter to Texaco will urge that there be no
further expansion, but we are unwilling to conclude that this
project of long standing represents "action made in the face
of mounting protest over corporate activity in South Africa,
including a shareholder resolution in 1976 specifically
requesting an end to expansion, (and) is likely to be in
terpreted as a strong vote of confidence for South Africa and
its policies." The Board's action is consistent with the idea of
(Space paid by News ft Publications Service)

voting against withdrawal when it concludes that
management is making a significant effort to be a
progressive force in South Africa and is achieving positive
results.
Finally, the Board tried to evaluate withdrawal as an
action proposed for implementation by Texaco It did not
look on a vote for withdrawal as a symbol This contrasts
with the CIR view that "a vote for withdrawal is a reasonable
way to convey our disapproval of Texaco's expansionist
policy." The Board felt it is more appropriate to vote against
withdrawal (the issue actually before us) and then write
Texaco urging no further expansion.
With respect to the second Texaco resolution, which
calls for the company to conduct and publish the results of
an investigation of alleged company involvement in the
transshipment of oil from South Africa to Rhodesia, the
Board was persuaded that Texaco has made extensive
efforts to this end on a continuing basis
To quote from Texaco's report; "Caltex Petroleum
Corporation, the U.S. parent of Caltex South Africa, has
made direct inquiries regarding this matter to its South
African subsidiary; and, in particular, the General Counsel of
Caltex Petroleum Corporation, together with independent
outside counsel, have in recent years traveled to South
Africa annually to review Caltex operations there and to
determine if there are factual bases for allegations such as
those referred to in the instant proposal
"Their most recent visit occurred in January, 1978, and,
upon the basis of their continuing review, counsel has again
concluded that Caltex South Africa does not sell any
petroleum or petroleum products to any Rhodesian citizens
or organizations, nor does it deliver any petroleum or
petroleum products into Rhodesia "
In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Board is
inclined to accept management's statements While
allegations to the contrary have been made, they are part of
lawsuits which appear to involve economic motives The
Board recognizes, as does Texaco, that transshipment is
occurring, but it does not find evidence of Caltex's par
ticipation.
The Board's decision was to vote against the proposal,
but send a letter to Texaco encouraging publication of their
continued investigations into transshipment, so far as is
consistent with pending and possible legal actions.
In the case of Eastman Kodak Company, the Board
decided to vote against the resolution to stop all sales of
photographic equipment and supplies to the South African
government and its agencies, and establish procedures to
ensure that no customer shall resell such products to the
government The CIR had recommended abstention on this
proposal
However, the Board felt that while there is obviously
room for different interpretations, the ClR's own analysis
provides support for a vote against the proposal For in
stance, the U.S. government recently has instituted a ban
against sales to the South African military or police In light
of this "the Commission (CIR) felt it was unlikely that the
product would be used for repressive purposes " Sales to
the government includes schools (e.g. audiovisual materials)
and many other positive activities. Yet these would be
prohibited under the proposal. Finally, the CIR noted that
"Kodak has a strong record of affirmative actions in its
employment practices in South Africa." Thus, the Board felt
there was no reason to withhold our support from
management when we disagreed with the substance of the
proposal.
The CIR voted to abstain on the IBM and the Bank of
America proposals dealing with South America. The Board
concurred with these recommendations so I will not add to
this already long letter by discussing these actions.
In closing may I note that the Board feels strongly about
the importance of weighing carefully the specific action
proposed in each shareholder resolution, and voting ac
cording to its merits. We recognize the attraction of a

"symbolic act," abstracting from the particulars of a
proposal in question. However, we do not believe this is a
wise approach.
The CIR has had a very considerable influence upon the
outcome of Stanford's proxy votes this spring, and this is as
it should be. Surely no one could hatfe expected that
agreement between the Trustees and the CIR would always
be forthcoming. That would put one body or the other in a
position of not making the independent judgments it is

obligated to make Because these issues ara extraordinarily
complex, and no letter can adequately discuss all the (actors
which the Board and the CIR weighed in each case, please
do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further
assistance
On behalf of the Board, I thank you and your colleagues
for your continuing advice, and look forward to com
municating to you the Board's actions on the next set of
recommendations we have just received from the CIR
