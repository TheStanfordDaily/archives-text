Members of the newly formed
Committee to Retire Aspiring
Politic os (CRAP) are circulating a pet
ition to place a constitutional
amendment on the next ballot which
would eliminate the ASSU Senate.
The petition calls for a constitu
tional amendment to change Article
II of the ASSU Constitution, which
authorizes the senate, according to
CRAP member Doug Bandow.
CRAP is composed of several "in
terested" students, according to
Bandow.
Bandow said the petition drive is
an "entirely serious effort." If pas
sed, the amendment would effec
tively eliminate the senate, transfer
ring all its powers to the Council of
Presidents (COP), Bandow added.
Bandow lists "enhancing the repu
tation of the student government" as
one of the reasons for the petition to
eliminate the senate.
The senate can only "downgrade"
the image of student government,
Bandow said. The COP has a certain
amount of respect, and is a more re
sponsive and responsible party, he
added.
Mike Roberts, another CRAP
member, said student governments
rarely do the students any good.
"They spend money and spin their
wheels," he said.
Students who "want something
done go to the student government,
then find they have to do it on their
own" anyway, he said.
The necessary communication be
tween students and the administra
tion would still exist, according to
Roberts. "The COP, in so far as
necessary, can still provide the
necessary services student govern
ment should perform," he added.
Roberts said CRAP is not "doing
this as an antagonistic thing" against
the student body.
It simply gets rid of a "body that
isn't doing much good anyway," he
