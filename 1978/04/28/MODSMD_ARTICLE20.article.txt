# Ph.D. student spreads disco fever
## features 
### Simone Cox 
In case you hadn't noticed,
there's a new disease that's
sweeping the nation, a contag
ion spread by radio waves,
vying with movies and televi
sion as a favorite outlet of
Americans' leisure time — you
may have guessed — it's the
dfsco fever.
And for those of you who
think this sport, activity, or
senselessness is relegated to
the likes of John Travolta or
Karen Lynn Gorney, take
another look — disco dancing
has become the property of the
masses, including high school
teenagers, grandmothers, and,
believe it or not, Stanford stu
dents.
Craig Sander, a Ph.D. en
gineering student here,
teaches a disco class in Tresid
der Lounge every Tuesday
night, and at $10 a head, there
is a capacity crowd of 65 people
in each of his two classes.
Phenomenal response
"The response was pheno
menal. I just put a small ad in
the Daily and had some flyers
printed — and three days
after the publicity came out
the class was full," Sander re
marked.
A native of Albuquerque,
New Mexico who completed
his undergraduate schooling at
the University of New Mexico,
Sander claims to have had no
dance or theatrical experience
before coming to Stanford.
He began his career in dance
by taking some ballroom dance
classes and disco classes in the
area. His first opportunity to

teach came when he was asked
to demonstrate at a Tresidder
HiFi show.
"I really don't know how it
happened, or why I was cho
sen," Sander recalled. "I had
taken this ballroom dance class
from this guy, and when he
found out that they needed
someone to teach this class, he
volunteered me."
Summer class
That was last year, and so far
"Sander has taught the class for
three consecutive quarters,
with plans for another class this
summer.
Until recently, he also taught
a disco class at the lumping

Frog, a disco night club in the
Old Mill in Mountain View. He
is also taking more dance les
sons (disco) presently, and
plans to continue them in the
future.
When Sander isn't out on the
dance floor, he finds his time
taken up with a research assis
tantship and further work to
complete his Ph.D. in Electrical
Engineering. And sometimes
he spends his free time skiing.
But why disco? "I like to
teach people things to make
them more comfortable when
they go out dancing — to have
a good time," Sanders replied.
His one-hour class takes on

the tone of having a good time,
for everyone seems to be en
joying themselves thoroughly.
Starting out with a popular
tune "Disco Inferno" he leads
the class beginning with
rhythm exercises, trying to get
his students to feel the beat of
the music, to know when to
start a step, and how each step
flows into the next. For those
that don't catch on at first, he
offers to take more time with
them after class.
"Is this song too fast?" he
yells. "Yes!" is the reply, and a
slower song is played.
Whoever wrote the adage,
"Those who can, do, and those

who can't, teach" hasn't seen
Sander in action. Although he
has been teaching for only a
year, he has all the poise, grace
and appearance (and dress) of
a polished, practiced disco
dancer.
Partner-dancing
When he demonstrates
some fundamentals of
partner-dancing with his assis
tant, you can hear a collective
sigh, as the awe-struck stu
dents wonder if only five more
lessons can get them to where
the teacher is.
And what does the expert
suggest as the best places in
the area for really "getting
into" the disco fever?
Sander recommended Or
phan Annie's in San Mateo,
mainly because it's more com
fortable and has live bands, al
though it has a lighted dance
floor that can be "distracting."
However, jumping Frog Sa
loon follows at a close second,
Sander added. Both also have
dance contests at least once a
week.
So if you're planning to enter
any time soon, but don't yet
feel quite "qualified" to be
seen on any dance floor, don't
despair, because Sander will
be teaching another class in
the summer.

slower song is played.
Whoever wrote the adage,
"Those who can, do, and those

who can't, teach" hasn't seen
Sander in action. Although he
has been teaching for only a
year, he has all the poise, grace
and appearance (and dress) of
a polished, practiced disco
dancer.
Partner-dancing
When he demonstrates
some fundamentals of
partner-dancing with his assis
tant, you can hear a collective
sigh, as the awe-struck stu
dents wonder if only five more
lessons can get them to where
the teacher is.
And what does the expert
suggest as the best places in
the area for really "getting
into" the disco fever?
Sander recommended Or
phan Annie's in San Mateo,
mainly because it's more com
fortable and has live bands, al
though it has a lighted dance
floor that can be "distracting."
However, jumping Frog Sa
loon follows at a close second,
Sander added. Both also have
dance contests at least once a
week.
So if you're planning to enter
any time soon, but don't yet
feel quite "qualified" to be
seen on any dance floor, don't
despair, because Sander will
be teaching another class in
the summer.

Engineering student Craig Sander is teaching a disco dance class that is filled to capacity with b5 people.
Here he teaches students the latest steps.

Two of Sanders' students practice steps together. See? Disco dancing
needn't always be done with the partners six feet apart.
In case you hadn't noticed,
there's a new disease that's
sweeping the nation, a contag
ion spread by radio waves,
vying with movies and televi
sion as a favorite outlet of
Americans' leisure time — you
may have guessed — it's the
dfsco fever.
And for those of you who
think this sport, activity, or
senselessness is relegated to
the likes of John Travolta or
Karen Lynn Gorney, take
another look — disco dancing
has become the property of the
masses, including high school
teenagers, grandmothers, and,
believe it or not, Stanford stu
dents.
Craig Sander, a Ph.D. en
gineering student here,
teaches a disco class in Tresid
der Lounge every Tuesday
night, and at $10 a head, there
is a capacity crowd of 65 people
in each of his two classes.
Phenomenal response
"The response was pheno
menal. I just put a small ad in
the Daily and had some flyers
printed — and three days
after the publicity came out
the class was full," Sander re
marked.
A native of Albuquerque,
New Mexico who completed
his undergraduate schooling at
the University of New Mexico,
Sander claims to have had no
dance or theatrical experience
before coming to Stanford.
He began his career in dance
by taking some ballroom dance
classes and disco classes in the
area. His first opportunity to

teach came when he was asked
to demonstrate at a Tresidder
HiFi show.
"I really don't know how it
happened, or why I was cho
sen," Sander recalled. "I had
taken this ballroom dance class
from this guy, and when he
found out that they needed
someone to teach this class, he
volunteered me."
Summer class
That was last year, and so far
"Sander has taught the class for
three consecutive quarters,
with plans for another class this
summer.
Until recently, he also taught
a disco class at the lumping

Frog, a disco night club in the
Old Mill in Mountain View. He
is also taking more dance les
sons (disco) presently, and
plans to continue them in the
future.
When Sander isn't out on the
dance floor, he finds his time
taken up with a research assis
tantship and further work to
complete his Ph.D. in Electrical
Engineering. And sometimes
he spends his free time skiing.
But why disco? "I like to
teach people things to make
them more comfortable when
they go out dancing — to have
a good time," Sanders replied.
His one-hour class takes on

the tone of having a good time,
for everyone seems to be en
joying themselves thoroughly.
Starting out with a popular
tune "Disco Inferno" he leads
the class beginning with
rhythm exercises, trying to get
his students to feel the beat of
the music, to know when to
start a step, and how each step
flows into the next. For those
that don't catch on at first, he
offers to take more time with
them after class.
"Is this song too fast?" he
yells. "Yes!" is the reply, and a
slower song is played.

who can't, teach" hasn't seen
