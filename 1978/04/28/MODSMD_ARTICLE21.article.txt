# Excess exposure to ultraviolet radiation proven harmful

Now that sunny, warm
weather has arrived, Stanford
students are spending a lot of
time outdoors. Most students
are unaware, however, of the
harmful effects of ultraviolet
exposure.
The earth receives a signific
ant amount of ultraviolet radia
tion from the sun. It is ab
sorbed by skin tissues and is
detrimental to skin cells.
A day or so after exposure to
ultraviolet radiation, the skin
will darken. This is tanning. It is
caused by the increase of
melanin granules which dar
ken and thicken the skin. The
darkerand thicker the skin, the
more protected tissues are
from ultraviolet radiation.
Tanning is therefore a protec
tive response to injury.
Skin cancer
Overexposure to ultraviolet
radiation among Caucasians is

correlated with skin cancer.
Caucasians, particularly the
Irish, Scots, and Welsh, lack an
effective pigment producing
system, and are most suscepti
ble to ultraviolet damage. They
freckle and burn easily, and are
likely to develop skin cancer if
ultraviolet damage becomes
frequent.
According to a Stanford pro
fessor of radiation, a sharp in
crease in skin cancer has oc
cured among secretaries. This
is attributed to the intense sun
exposure often received on
weekends, orat noontime dur
ing the week, of people who
work indoors.
Therefore, it may be more
detrimental to get isolated and
excessive exposure as
oppsosed to regular, more
moderate tanning.
Other effects
Chronic exposure to ul
traviolet radiation not only in
duces skin cancer, but dam

ages the eye, hastens the aging
of the skin, and can interact
with drugs in the body.
Exposure to ultraviolet radia
tion can burn the outer cover
of the eye. This occurs in areas
where ultraviolet radiation is
reflected, such as in snowy
areas or white sand. Skiers and
lifeguards often experience
burned eyes.
There may be a .relationship
between cataracts and ul
traviolet radiation. According
to Dr. Marmorof Palo Alto V.A.
Hospital, it is speculated that
chronic exposure over a
lifetime may contribute to the
production of the yellow aging
pigment in the lens of the eye.
Lesions
Ultraviolet radiation, said
Marmor, can also produce le
sions in the cornea which can
lead to temporary blindness.
Drying of the skin, wrinkl
ing, and the dilation of blood
vessels also appear with
chronic sun exposure. Those
who sunburn easily are most
susceptible to these aging ef
fects.
A 1973 report on Solar Ul
traviolet Radiation of the Na
tional Academy of Sciences
and National Academy of En

gineering found that (he ef
fects of ultraviolet radiation on
the skin produce signs of aging
far more quickly than aging its
self.
Ultraviolet rays can interact
with drugs in the blood stream.
For example, tetracycline, an
antibiotic prescribed for acne
and flu, can be internally acti
vated by the penetrating ef
fects of sunlight and can impair
tissue.
Drug reaction
If you are taking tetracycline,
you may notice a reddish rash
on body parts exposed to the
sun, which is a sign of the in
teraction of ultraviolet radia
tion and tetracycline.
For the best protection from
ultraviolet radiation, do not go
outside unprotected during
the hours of peak radiation, 10
a.m. to 2 p.m. This is true
for both sunny and cloudy
days.
Do not rely on tanning lo
tions, because most are inef
fective, according to a Stanford
professor at the Medical
School. He recommends lo
tions which contain para
amino-benzoic-acid, or PABA,
because it effectively blocks ul
traviolet radiation.

Students here love to bag rays in the springtime, hut they should he careful not to overdo sunning. Chronic
exposure to ultraviolet radiation may cause skin cancer and eye damage.
