## jon gibson/ 'blue collar' The 						private worlds of modern proletariats 
### 
If you're rich,
you can buy it.
If you're
anything else,
you gotta
fight for it.
With this caveat, we plunge
into Blue Collar, the most im
portant and underrated film
I've ever seen. At long last we
can go see a film that doesn't
overpower us with the pre
sence of megasuperstars, with
a hyped-up director, or with a
budget as big as the national
debt. Blue Collar overpowers
us simply because of its shock
ingly brilliant and lucid con
struction.
The film was directed by Paul
Schrader — writer of Taxi
Driver, The Yazuka, Rolling
Thunder, and Obsession —
who also co-wrote the script
for Blue Collar with his brother
Leonard. The brothers
Schrader put together a story
which provides us with penet
rating insights into the lives
and moral dilemmas of three
Detroit auto workers, por
trayed by Richard Pryor,
Yaphet Kotto, and Harvey
Keitel.
Cocaine and bowling
We view the private worlds
of modern proletariats in
which men like Pryor become
enraged at mindless television
programming, yet refuse to
turn off their expensive color
T.V.'s, explaining, "I bought it,
I paid for it, we're going to
watch everything on it . . .
even the snow." Worlds in
which a young girl makes
home-made wire braces be
cause her father can't afford to
send her to the orthodontist,
but can afford to maintain a
modest middle-class house
hold equipped with the usual
bougeois appliances. Worlds
in which orgiastic cocaine par
ties thrown by an indebted
Yaphet Kotto provide the only
alternative to weekly bowling
nights for Pryor and Keitel.
Pryor, Kotto and Keitel por
tray three men caught in a hor

rible, existential rut. They are
forced to find money and de
cide to rob their own union.
But instead of stealing money,
they unwittingly take a record
of illegal loans the Union has
made. The film goes on to
show what happens to each of
the three once they — and the
Union — realize the potential
of their new-found power.
Pryor at his best
Pryor is at his dramatic best
in Blue Collar, constantly abu
sive, easily enraged; Yaphet
Kotto turns in the film's best
performance as Pryor's and
Keitel's savvy companion in
this working man's oppres
sion. Blue Collar boasts amaz
ingly depressing photography

... no
megasuperstars, no
hyped-up director, no
budget as big as the na
tional debt. "Blue Col
lar" overpowers us
simply because of its
shockingly brilliant and
lucid construction.

as well, along with a terrific,
earthy score by Jack Nitzsche.
Schrader has constructed a
thoroughly well made film in
putting together Blue Collar.
Unlike 90 per cent of the films
on the market today, Blue Col
lar makes a person think and —
in my case, at least — feel a
dull, cathartic guilt for, if no
thing else, not being aware of
this overlooked subculture in
our society.
Flaubert
Quite recently, one facet of
film has caught itself up in a
movement which, incongru
ous as it seems, closely paral
lels 19th century French literary
trends. We have already seen a
rash of movies with heavily
realistic tones — films with a
Flaubertian eye for meticulous
detail and absolute ver

isimilitude — culminating in
works like Serpico.
More recently, these films
have begun to focus on even
more specific aspects of reality
in which we witness very un
pleasant, even stinging
scenarios, always based on
low, undeniable truths: films
like Nashville, Taxi Driver, and
Looking for Mr. Coodbar, have
brought us to a modern
Naturalism much like the one
Zola described in France. This
genre of movie, the 'naturalis
tic film,' acts as a sort of social
mirror — that is, it shows us a
reflection of our own society;
one from which, we hope, we
can observe something about
ourselves and learn accord
ingly.
A moral message
Blue Collar is probably the
best and most valuable natural
istic film ever released. Not only
does it depict with painful ac
curacy the sometimes squalid
lives of three working men, but
it also delivers to us a powerful
moral message: that the sys
tem — 'they,' in the film — is
geared in such a way as to al
ways keep people in their
place.
Contrast a great film like
Blue Collar with one like Satur
day Night Fever, and we can
see how the naturalistic film
can be as dangerous as it is val
uable. Saturday Night Fever
could have made more clear
the worthlessness of the rebel
lious young disco life, but it in
stead chose to take the easy
and profitable way out by
glorifying teeny-god John
Travolta and the Bee Gee's. We
left the movie wondering
whether Travolta's life was re
ally so bad.
No doubt
Blue Collar leaves no doubts
in our minds. Though hilari
ously funny at times, it is
moreover a depressing film.
But that is to be expected: the
truth, alas, usually does hurt.
Blue Collar, I expect, will be
around for a long time.

Blue Collar with one like Satur
day Night Fever, and we can
see how the naturalistic film
can be as dangerous as it is val
uable. Saturday Night Fever
could have made more clear
the worthlessness of the rebel
lious young disco life, but it in
stead chose to take the easy
and profitable way out by
glorifying teeny-god John
Travolta and the Bee Gee's. We
left the movie wondering
whether Travolta's life was re
ally so bad.
No doubt
Blue Collar leaves no doubts
in our minds. Though hilari
ously funny at times, it is
moreover a depressing film.
But that is to be expected: the
truth, alas, usually does hurt.
Blue Collar, I expect, will be
around for a long time.
If you're rich,
you can buy it.
If you're
anything else,
you gotta
fight for it.
With this caveat, we plunge
into Blue Collar, the most im
portant and underrated film
I've ever seen. At long last we
can go see a film that doesn't
overpower us with the pre
sence of megasuperstars, with
a hyped-up director, or with a
budget as big as the national
debt. Blue Collar overpowers
us simply because of its shock
ingly brilliant and lucid con
struction.
The film was directed by Paul
Schrader — writer of Taxi
Driver, The Yazuka, Rolling
Thunder, and Obsession —
who also co-wrote the script
for Blue Collar with his brother
Leonard. The brothers
Schrader put together a story
which provides us with penet
rating insights into the lives
and moral dilemmas of three
Detroit auto workers, por
trayed by Richard Pryor,
Yaphet Kotto, and Harvey
Keitel.
Cocaine and bowling
We view the private worlds
of modern proletariats in
which men like Pryor become
enraged at mindless television
programming, yet refuse to
turn off their expensive color
T.V.'s, explaining, "I bought it,
I paid for it, we're going to
watch everything on it . . .
even the snow." Worlds in
which a young girl makes
home-made wire braces be
cause her father can't afford to
send her to the orthodontist,
but can afford to maintain a
modest middle-class house
hold equipped with the usual
bougeois appliances. Worlds
in which orgiastic cocaine par
ties thrown by an indebted
Yaphet Kotto provide the only
alternative to weekly bowling
nights for Pryor and Keitel.
Pryor, Kotto and Keitel por
tray three men caught in a hor

rible, existential rut. They are
forced to find money and de
cide to rob their own union.
But instead of stealing money,
they unwittingly take a record
of illegal loans the Union has
made. The film goes on to
show what happens to each of
the three once they — and the
Union — realize the potential
of their new-found power.
Pryor at his best
Pryor is at his dramatic best
in Blue Collar, constantly abu
sive, easily enraged; Yaphet
Kotto turns in the film's best
performance as Pryor's and
Keitel's savvy companion in
this working man's oppres
sion. Blue Collar boasts amaz
ingly depressing photography

... no
megasuperstars, no
hyped-up director, no
budget as big as the na
tional debt. "Blue Col
lar" overpowers us
simply because of its
shockingly brilliant and
lucid construction.

as well, along with a terrific,
earthy score by Jack Nitzsche.
Schrader has constructed a
thoroughly well made film in
putting together Blue Collar.
Unlike 90 per cent of the films
on the market today, Blue Col
lar makes a person think and —
in my case, at least — feel a
dull, cathartic guilt for, if no
thing else, not being aware of
this overlooked subculture in
our society.
Flaubert
Quite recently, one facet of
film has caught itself up in a
movement which, incongru
ous as it seems, closely paral
lels 19th century French literary
trends. We have already seen a
rash of movies with heavily
realistic tones — films with a
Flaubertian eye for meticulous
detail and absolute ver

isimilitude — culminating in
works like Serpico.
More recently, these films
have begun to focus on even
more specific aspects of reality
in which we witness very un
pleasant, even stinging
scenarios, always based on
low, undeniable truths: films
like Nashville, Taxi Driver, and
Looking for Mr. Coodbar, have
brought us to a modern
Naturalism much like the one
Zola described in France. This
genre of movie, the 'naturalis
tic film,' acts as a sort of social
mirror — that is, it shows us a
reflection of our own society;
one from which, we hope, we
can observe something about
ourselves and learn accord
ingly.
A moral message
Blue Collar is probably the
best and most valuable natural
istic film ever released. Not only
does it depict with painful ac
curacy the sometimes squalid
lives of three working men, but
it also delivers to us a powerful
moral message: that the sys
tem — 'they,' in the film — is
geared in such a way as to al
ways keep people in their
place.
