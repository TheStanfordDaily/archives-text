### 
AN UNMARRIED WOMAN
Old Mill * ★ * ★ ★
Paul Mazursky's (Harry and
Tonto) warm and intelligent
view of 70's divorce. Jill
Clayburgh finally gets a role
which is equal to her talent, and
she doesn't disappoint. The
supporting cast is solid, with
Alan Bates standing out. Comic
without being cruel, touching
without being saccharine,
"Unmarried Woman'' is the
best film so far this year.
— Ron Lillejord
THE FURY ★ *
Palo Alto Square
An empty style piece. Director
Brian DePalm gets great sequ
ences, but he has no vision in
this mess about a telekinetic
boy and girl. Nothing con
nects; the script is terrible and
the characterization is worse.
The film is too serious for satire,
but the climax has all the ele
ments of classic parody (|ohn
Cassavetes literally gets
blown-up; we see his frag
mented body from about six
different angles. The scene
must be the ultimate in camp
horror.)
R.L.
SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER
Bijou * * *
No nutritional value. Also very
good. A dopey plot and only

one real actor and stupid
dialogue — pure schlock — but
still a damn good film and you
should see it. Even through
John Travolta makes a fool of
himself every week on TV he is
a legitimate star here; as the
best disco dancer in the entire
one-mile radius of this picture
he gives power to what other
wise would have been awful.
No one will blame you if you
loathe, despise, detest and
abhor this picture because of
its unrepentant dumbness;
still, if you scoff too loudly at
followers we are liable to punch
you in the nose.
—John Nielsen
ANNIE HALL ★ * ★ ★ *
Aquarius Twin
A movie about a skinny, red
haired schlemeil comedian
with No-Doz mannerisms and a
masochistic wit. Roughly di
rected, with a whiney, indul
gent tone and a vaguely disturb
ing aftertaste. (In short, the
best film Woody Allen has ever
made.) For all of their
strengths, Allen films until
Annie had been exercises in
comic overkill (they npver let
up, and eventually, albeit guil
tily, we wish he would shut up
fora minute); Annie is different
in that it lets the ribs rest from
time to time. To use a wildly

revealing phrase, this is a movie
with depth.

THE TURNING POINT **
Old Mill
A movie about bitchy people
who won't shut up. The film is
done in by its soap opera plot
based on beliefs straight from
the fifties. For example, Shirley
MacLaine gives up her career
because she gets married. The
film seems to say that a woman
can't have a career and love
both. The film's only redeem
ing feature is Baryshnikov's
dancing; basically, the movie is
too much soap opera and not
enought ballet.

JULIA * * ★ ★ ★
Old Mill
Director Fred Zinnemann's
superb craftsmanship and
complete intelligence domi
nate this film about friendship
and its responsibilities, lane
, Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave
star in this true story based on a
chapter of Lillian Hellman's au
tobiographical book Pen
timento. Both are brilliant;
Fonda effectively captures
Hellman's spirited personality,
and Redgrave delivers a fine,
understated performance as

the idealistic Julia. A must-see
film.

STAR WARS * * *
Old Mill
At first glance, 1) stunningly en
tertaining and wildly visual 2)
wildly entertaining and stun
ningly visual 3) the kind of
movie nobody makes anymore.
On second thought, a deliber
ately anaesthetic, vapid and
happy sell-out. Except for Alec
Guiness the actors are not un
like Barbie dolls, or escapees
from an episode of Lassie;
though Lucas is to be praised
for avoiding the asinine politi
cal commentary implicit in
things like Rollerball and Lo
gan's Run his decision to center
the action around the aformen
tioned members of the Pepsi
Generation rankles and irks
and peeves. True 2001 fans in
sist that for all its visual
achievements Star Wars is really
very bland — even though I still
don't know what the hell was
going on in Kubrick's rnovie I
am tempted to agree.

STAR WARS * * *
Old Mill
At first glance, 1) stunningly en
tertaining and wildly visual 2)
wildly entertaining and stun
ningly visual 3) the kind of
movie nobody makes anymore.
On second thought, a deliber
ately anaesthetic, vapid and
happy sell-out. Except for Alec
Guiness the actors are not un
like Barbie dolls, or escapees
from an episode of Lassie;
though Lucas is to be praised
for avoiding the asinine politi
cal commentary implicit in
things like Rollerball and Lo
gan's Run his decision to center
the action around the aformen

Generation rankles and irks
and peeves. True 2001 fans in

achievements Star Wars is really
very bland — even though I still
don't know what the hell was
going on in Kubrick's rnovie I
am tempted to agree.

AN UNMARRIED WOMAN
Old Mill * ★ * ★ ★
Paul Mazursky's (Harry and
Tonto) warm and intelligent
view of 70's divorce. Jill
Clayburgh finally gets a role
which is equal to her talent, and
she doesn't disappoint. The
supporting cast is solid, with
Alan Bates standing out. Comic
without being cruel, touching
without being saccharine,
"Unmarried Woman'' is the
best film so far this year.

THE FURY ★ *
Palo Alto Square
An empty style piece. Director
Brian DePalm gets great sequ
ences, but he has no vision in
this mess about a telekinetic
boy and girl. Nothing con
nects; the script is terrible and
the characterization is worse.
The film is too serious for satire,
but the climax has all the ele
ments of classic parody (|ohn
Cassavetes literally gets
blown-up; we see his frag
mented body from about six
different angles. The scene
must be the ultimate in camp
horror.)
R.L.
SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER
Bijou * * *
No nutritional value. Also very
good. A dopey plot and only

one real actor and stupid
dialogue — pure schlock — but
still a damn good film and you
should see it. Even through
John Travolta makes a fool of
himself every week on TV he is
a legitimate star here; as the
best disco dancer in the entire
one-mile radius of this picture
he gives power to what other
wise would have been awful.
No one will blame you if you
loathe, despise, detest and
abhor this picture because of
its unrepentant dumbness;
still, if you scoff too loudly at
followers we are liable to punch
you in the nose.

ANNIE HALL ★ * ★ ★ *
Aquarius Twin
A movie about a skinny, red
haired schlemeil comedian
with No-Doz mannerisms and a
masochistic wit. Roughly di
rected, with a whiney, indul
gent tone and a vaguely disturb
ing aftertaste. (In short, the
best film Woody Allen has ever
made.) For all of their
strengths, Allen films until
Annie had been exercises in
comic overkill (they npver let
up, and eventually, albeit guil
tily, we wish he would shut up
fora minute); Annie is different
in that it lets the ribs rest from
time to time. To use a wildly

revealing phrase, this is a movie
with depth.

THE TURNING POINT **
Old Mill
A movie about bitchy people
who won't shut up. The film is
done in by its soap opera plot
based on beliefs straight from
the fifties. For example, Shirley
MacLaine gives up her career
because she gets married. The
film seems to say that a woman
can't have a career and love
both. The film's only redeem
ing feature is Baryshnikov's
dancing; basically, the movie is
too much soap opera and not
enought ballet.
