## One hell of a documentary 
### 
"Word is Out" was probably
the best film that I've seen in
years. And I'm as surprised
about my saying so as anyone
else might be.
The movie is a documentary
of the gay life style, made up of
a collage of interviews with 26
people. I approached this film
with about much skepticism as
possible, anticipating what
might be two hours of the
world's most depressing
monologues recorded.
But the film makers did
something totally unexpected.
They stepped back, realized
they had some very moving
and exciting film footage on
the problem of growing up in
America on their hands, and
simply let the people they
filmed "put it all together" for
them.
Coming to terms
This may be the only
documentary of its kind in that
its makers undertook an am
bitious project, and suc
ceeded. We have been bar
raged by more literature and
films explaining why gays are
this way or that way, why
women are another way, what
the real man and the liberated
man are, ad infinitum. Life style
testimonials abound.

And then someone came
along with the idea of simply
letting some people tell their
own story, with no political
smokescreen attached by the
editors. The main story is really
this — everybody is different,
and some people have more
"differentness" to come to
terms with than others.
What was best in the film was
the lack of a sense of tokenism.
One could categorize the
people — old, young, black,
white, Asian-American,
Chicano — yet the labels dib
solved as they told their
stories. Sometimes a young
person was the most isolated,
sometimes an older person.
Some were bitter about op
pression, others, including a
man who was institutionalized
and given electric shock treat
ment for the "illness" of being
a homosexual, were not.
Interwoven
Yet as I writeabout bits of the
movie, it doesn't do it justice.
Perhaps its strength lay in the
brilliant decision not only to at
tempt to interview such a range
of people, but also to edit the
film so that no one seemed a
type. Their stories were inter
woven, melded together, yet

each personality evolved sepa
rately as the film progressed.
Some of the humor lay in the
cross-cutting as well.
What I learned was im
mense, but had little todowith
gays, or being gay, and was
only a glimpse into the lives of
26 individuals. The film was
both about growing up and
growing. It reaffirmed my sus
picions that what people really
need is not more groups or
labels, but the chance to see
the diversity of the people
around them, and to find
"positive role models" among
this diversity.
Not righteous
The tone was never one of
self-pity nor of righteous
superiority, which distin
guished this film from any
other treatment of
"minorities" that I've encoun
tered. The theme was that all
people need a sense of their
"alrightness" as they grow,
and this is true of straights as
well as gays as well as anybody
else. The film makers set out to
shatter myths, and did so by
taking hold of each and every
stereotypical image we might
have about homosexuals, and
looking underneath it for the

person that we have obscured.
Yet the film is not an indict
ment of society. Those in the
movie realized at some point
that they were not only labeled
from outside, often incorrectly
and with great handicap, but
that we all tend to take socie
ty's labels in, doing injury to
ourselves.
Professional
One man described this best
when he spoke of all the time
he had spent walking around,
always looking for someone
else, for the right person to
make him complete, for that
someone or something just
around the corner that would
change his life. And then he
realized "I was the person I was
looking for. I was him."
We all find ourselves in a
similar groping, often absurd,
manner. Ignorance is our
greatest handicap as we seek
out the ideal job or the ideal
life style. I was grateful to be
allowed to share the accumu
lated wisdom, fears, and hopes
of twenty-six of my fellow be
ings. "Word is Out" left me
feeling — let's hear from the
other three billion of us! Now
that would be the documen
tary to end all documentaries!

the best film that I've seen in
years. And I'm as surprised
about my saying so as anyone
else might be.
The movie is a documentary
of the gay life style, made up of
a collage of interviews with 26
people. I approached this film
with about much skepticism as
possible, anticipating what
might be two hours of the
world's most depressing
monologues recorded.
But the film makers did
something totally unexpected.
They stepped back, realized
they had some very moving
and exciting film footage on
the problem of growing up in
America on their hands, and
simply let the people they
filmed "put it all together" for
them.
Coming to terms
This may be the only
documentary of its kind in that
its makers undertook an am
bitious project, and suc
ceeded. We have been bar
raged by more literature and
films explaining why gays are
this way or that way, why
women are another way, what
the real man and the liberated
man are, ad infinitum. Life style
testimonials abound.

And then someone came
along with the idea of simply
letting some people tell their
own story, with no political
smokescreen attached by the
editors. The main story is really
this — everybody is different,
and some people have more
"differentness" to come to
terms with than others.
What was best in the film was
the lack of a sense of tokenism.
One could categorize the
people — old, young, black,
white, Asian-American,
Chicano — yet the labels dib
solved as they told their
stories. Sometimes a young
person was the most isolated,
sometimes an older person.
Some were bitter about op
pression, others, including a
man who was institutionalized
and given electric shock treat
ment for the "illness" of being
a homosexual, were not.
Interwoven
Yet as I writeabout bits of the
movie, it doesn't do it justice.
Perhaps its strength lay in the
brilliant decision not only to at
tempt to interview such a range
of people, but also to edit the
film so that no one seemed a
type. Their stories were inter
woven, melded together, yet

each personality evolved sepa
rately as the film progressed.
Some of the humor lay in the
cross-cutting as well.
What I learned was im
mense, but had little todowith
gays, or being gay, and was
only a glimpse into the lives of
26 individuals. The film was
both about growing up and
growing. It reaffirmed my sus
picions that what people really
need is not more groups or
labels, but the chance to see
the diversity of the people
around them, and to find
"positive role models" among
this diversity.
Not righteous
The tone was never one of
self-pity nor of righteous
superiority, which distin
guished this film from any
other treatment of
"minorities" that I've encoun
tered. The theme was that all
people need a sense of their
"alrightness" as they grow,
and this is true of straights as
well as gays as well as anybody
else. The film makers set out to
shatter myths, and did so by
taking hold of each and every
stereotypical image we might
have about homosexuals, and
looking underneath it for the

person that we have obscured.
Yet the film is not an indict
ment of society. Those in the
movie realized at some point
that they were not only labeled
from outside, often incorrectly
and with great handicap, but
that we all tend to take socie
ty's labels in, doing injury to
ourselves.
Professional
One man described this best
when he spoke of all the time
he had spent walking around,
always looking for someone
else, for the right person to
make him complete, for that
someone or something just
around the corner that would
change his life. And then he
realized "I was the person I was
looking for. I was him."
We all find ourselves in a
similar groping, often absurd,
manner. Ignorance is our
greatest handicap as we seek
out the ideal job or the ideal
life style. I was grateful to be
allowed to share the accumu
lated wisdom, fears, and hopes
of twenty-six of my fellow be
ings. "Word is Out" left me
feeling — let's hear from the
other three billion of us! Now
that would be the documen
tary to end all documentaries!
"Word is Out" was probably
the best film that I've seen in
