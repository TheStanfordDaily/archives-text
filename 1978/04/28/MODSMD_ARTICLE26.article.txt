Peking Restaurant
2650 El Camino Real
Mountain View
941-7841
Chez Michel, La Bourgogne,
Mac Arthur Park,. . . sure, din
ner in the City sounds great.
But you know, it also
sounds kind of expensive. For
the majority of us whose "mad
money" inevitably ends up at
the Bookstore, in the washers,
or going through the vending
machines, escargots and
Strawberries Romanoff come
far and few between. So how
about something closer to
home and easier on that stu
dent budget? How about the
Peking Restaurant?
]ust five minutes away by car,
Peking Restaurant offers the
Stanford student good
Chinese food, a comfortable
atmosphere, and reasonable

prices. Why go here over the
hundreds of other Chinese re
staurants which cover the
Peninsula? Because there is a
difference.
Peking is not just another
Chinese restaurant. Cuisine,
decor, and service all reflect an
extra added touch. The dining
room is large and welcoming.
The traditional red and gold
colors of old China, the soft
lighting, and the hanging lan
terns all invite the diner to relax
and enjoy. Owned and run by
an elderly Chinese couple,
Peking exudes a feeling that is
pure Orient.
The menu is substantial.
Both hot and cold appetizers, a
choice of soups and vegeta
bles, and a wide range of beef,
pork, seafood, and poultry en
trees are featured. Uninhi
bited by our number (there
were only two of us), or the

reality of those extra winter
pounds, we ordered six diffe
rent dishes.
Almost instantly we were
served our first course of Fish
and Meatball Soup ($2.50)
where small fish patties and
plump won tons wrapped
around a mild beef filling
floated amidst a clear broth
and stringy rice noodles. Far
from extraordinary, this order
was nevertheless a pleasant
departure from the usual won
ton soup prepared in most
Chinese kitchens.
Other selections, perhaps for
the even more daring, include
Shark Fin and Seaweed Soup.
Moving on, we began to
sample the five remaining dish
es. The Mu Shu Pork ($3.75)
was first in the culinary sequ
ence. Lightly sauteed strips of
pork, crisp water chestnuts
and bamboo shoots, a tangy

plum sauce, and paper-thin
rice pancakes were the central
characters in this delicious ren
dition of the Chinese crepe.
Always a favorite, the Sweet
and Sour Prawns ($3.95) fol
lowed close behind. Here,
jumbo sized shrimp dipped
and fried in egg batter, chunks

of pineapple, and rings of
green pepper all smothered in
a piquant sweet and sour sauce
provided an enjoyable tempta
tion.
Tender cubes of chicken and
lots of crunchy cashews made
the Cashew Chicken ($3.25)
equally fantastic. The Curry

Beef served along side the
chicken was unfortunately less
satisfying. An unimaginative
combination of braised beef
and curry powder, this dish
scored few points. The As
sorted Fried Rice ($2.50), in
cluding plenty of shrimp, egg,
bacon, and chives soon set us
back on the right track.

Green tea, fortune cookies,
and hot scented towels were
the final touches to our meal.
All dishes are prepared for
four or more and can be or
dered to go. Special four and
five course dinners are also av
ailable.

But you know, it also
sounds kind of expensive. For
the majority of us whose "mad
money" inevitably ends up at
the Bookstore, in the washers,
or going through the vending
machines, escargots and
Strawberries Romanoff come
far and few between. So how
about something closer to
home and easier on that stu
dent budget? How about the
Peking Restaurant?
]ust five minutes away by car,
Peking Restaurant offers the
Stanford student good
Chinese food, a comfortable
atmosphere, and reasonable

prices. Why go here over the
hundreds of other Chinese re
staurants which cover the
Peninsula? Because there is a
difference.
Peking is not just another
Chinese restaurant. Cuisine,
decor, and service all reflect an
extra added touch. The dining
room is large and welcoming.
The traditional red and gold
colors of old China, the soft
lighting, and the hanging lan
terns all invite the diner to relax
and enjoy. Owned and run by
an elderly Chinese couple,
Peking exudes a feeling that is
pure Orient.
The menu is substantial.
Both hot and cold appetizers, a
choice of soups and vegeta
bles, and a wide range of beef,
pork, seafood, and poultry en
trees are featured. Uninhi
bited by our number (there
were only two of us), or the

reality of those extra winter
pounds, we ordered six diffe
rent dishes.
Almost instantly we were
served our first course of Fish
and Meatball Soup ($2.50)
where small fish patties and
plump won tons wrapped
around a mild beef filling
floated amidst a clear broth
and stringy rice noodles. Far
from extraordinary, this order
was nevertheless a pleasant
departure from the usual won
ton soup prepared in most
Chinese kitchens.
Other selections, perhaps for
the even more daring, include
Shark Fin and Seaweed Soup.
Moving on, we began to
sample the five remaining dish
es. The Mu Shu Pork ($3.75)
was first in the culinary sequ
ence. Lightly sauteed strips of
pork, crisp water chestnuts
and bamboo shoots, a tangy

plum sauce, and paper-thin
rice pancakes were the central
characters in this delicious ren
dition of the Chinese crepe.
Always a favorite, the Sweet
and Sour Prawns ($3.95) fol
lowed close behind. Here,
jumbo sized shrimp dipped
and fried in egg batter, chunks

of pineapple, and rings of
green pepper all smothered in
a piquant sweet and sour sauce
provided an enjoyable tempta
tion.
Tender cubes of chicken and
lots of crunchy cashews made
the Cashew Chicken ($3.25)
equally fantastic. The Curry

Beef served along side the
chicken was unfortunately less
satisfying. An unimaginative
combination of braised beef
and curry powder, this dish
scored few points. The As
sorted Fried Rice ($2.50), in
cluding plenty of shrimp, egg,
bacon, and chives soon set us
back on the right track.

Green tea, fortune cookies,
and hot scented towels were
the final touches to our meal.
All dishes are prepared for
four or more and can be or
dered to go. Special four and
five course dinners are also av
ailable.
