Amelio's
1630 Powell Street
San Francisco
397-4339
San Francisco's North Beach section has
long been known for its fine Italian res
taurants. Washington Street Bar and Grill,
Adolph's, and Capp's each attract a large
and faithful clientele. And yet to this day,
there remains one establishment,
Amelio's , which stands out among the
rest.
Founded by Amelio Pacini, an Italian
immigrant, back in 1926, Amelio's has
grown from a neighborhood restaurant
and popular speakeasy during the prohibi
tion era to a restaurant universally
acclaimed for its gracious atmosphere and
continental veal specialties. Here in the
midst of San Francisco's own "Little Italy,"
Amelio's spells elegance and excellence in
classic European style.
Dark wood paneling, rich red carpets,
and waiters in tuxedoes set a distinctive
mood. Old world traditions, rather than

new, are refreshingly keynote. Soft
candlelight illuminates an intimate and
handsome dining room. The water glasses
are never empty and the bread is always
warm. In the eyes of host, waiter, and even
busboy, the customer undoubtedly comes
first.
Amelio's menu offers 23 different en
trees ranging from $8.75 to $27.50; a vari
ety of hors-d'oeuvres, soups,
salads, vegetables, and pastas are served a
la carte. Aside from the delicate Vichys
soise ($2.25) which began our meal and the
Cherries Jubilee which ended it, our fare
was strictly Italian.
With my native Florentine escort as
guide, we ordered Linguini with Clam
Sauce ($6.50), Veal al'Amelio's ($10.25),
Cottoletta Papagallo ($11.75), and a bottle
of dry chianti wine.
Tossed in a light garlic and cream sauce
with freshly diced clams, the linguini gave
advance notice of the intricately sauced
dishes yet to come. And as the name
suggests, Veal al'Amelio's continued to at
test to the careful expertise of the house
chef. The tender escalops of veal sauteed
with mushrooms, lemon juice, and white

wine turned out to be even more delecta
ble than expected. The veal itself was
white and of prime quality and the sauce
appropriately subtle.
The Cottoletta Papagallo consisted of a
moist veal cutlet stuffed with assorted
herbs and cheese and finely accented with
sauce Perigourdine. Each entree was a
masterpiece of the finest of ingredients
and the choicest of seasonings; 50 years of
culinary prowess was beautifully evi
denced.
After dinner, our waiter surprised us
with Cherries jubilee ($6.50 for two) and
long-stemmed glasses of Sambuca. Need
less to say, his surprise was a success.
Flaming brandy sauce, dark cherries, and
rich vanilla ice cream were the central
players in this French version of sweet sa
tin. The liqueur, a traditional continental
apertif, has an overriding licorice taste
which we decided must first be acquired
to be enjoyed. Small cups of strong Italian
expresso completed this delicious meal.
Though expensive, Amelio's will never
be called extravagant because the best is
never cheap.
