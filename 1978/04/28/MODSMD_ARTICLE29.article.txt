# Omar Khayyam's: an Armenian island in the stream of city life
## 
### 
Omar Khayyam's
196 O'Farrell
San Francisco
781-1010
Omar Khayyam's, a
downtown San Francisco re
staurant, appears small and
unimporant-looking from the
outside. With the honking
cars, neon lights, and the bus
tle of pedestrians going by, we
almost passed this famous
Armenian restaurant. But once
we stepped inside and were
surrounded by its calm, eleg
ant atmosphere, the restaurant
seemed like an oasis. It was a
striking contrast to the hum of
activity outside.
After descending a flight of
plushly carpeted stairs, we

were quickly seated in a softly
lit circular room. There were
paintings hanging in the dining
room which added to the re
staurant's authentic Armenian
atmosphere. Each painting de
picted a scene from Omar
Khayyam's Rubaiyat, a collec
tion of poems.
Before our meal, we were
served champagne cocktails
($1.25 each) along with Arme
nian hors d'oeuvres which we
could have eaten all night. The
Vaprak Sarma (grape leaves
stuffed with rice and chopped
meat), was gone in two min
utes. Along with this, we had
crisp carrots, green peppers,
and pita bread with rose petal
preserve. One warning about
the preserve — it is very sweet!

Next we had a bowl of the
soup du jour, which was a
creamy chicken with rice soup.
A salad also went with our
meal. This was raw spinach
topped with bits of egg and
cheese mixed in an oil and vin
egar dressing.
The entree was a filling
course for both of us. I had
Armenian Tchakhokhbelli
Chicken ($8.50) while my
friend had Curried Lamb Pilaff
($8.50). The Tchakhokhbelli
was tender chicken jointed and
sauteed in sherry wine and to
mato sauce. Served with this
was rice pilaff (rice which is
steamed, buttered, and sea
soned), which was very moist
and tasty. My friend's curried
lamb was served over this rice

and topped with an apricot.
The lamb was delicately spiced
and extremely tender.
Other entrees on the menu
include such dishes as Roast
Duck ($9); Kouzou Ka Kzartma
($9), a lamb served in a broth
with vegetables; Patlijan
($8.50), a dish consisting of
baked eggplant and lamb; and
of course, one or two non-
Armenian dishes such as Filet
Mignon Steak ($9.75) or New
York Steak ($9.75).
Our dessert was almost an
entree in itself. We were
served pastries similar to bak
lava made with walnuts, cin
namon, and honey. We also
managed to finish off the dish
of apricot-topped coconut ice
cream that was included with

the meal.
To conclude the dinner we
had Omar's coffee, a pleasant
blend which was neither too
weak nor strong.
The service that we received
was excellent; the food was
promptly brought to our table
after we had ordered. Our wai
ter, Kerop, was friendly, espe

daily in explaining to us what
ingredients made up each dish
on the menu. He also filled us
in on a little of Omar
Khayyam's past history.
During World War Two,
Omar Khayyam's would close
to the public once a week in
order to open only for ser
vicemen. Back then, a person
could eat at Omar's while

being entertained since there
was a stage in one corner of the
room. Omar's was also chosen
as the official restaurant of
the 1945 United Nations open
ing.
Omar Khayyam's is open
every day for lunch and dinner
except on Sundays and Mon
days.

seemed like an oasis. It was a
striking contrast to the hum of
activity outside.
After descending a flight of
plushly carpeted stairs, we

were quickly seated in a softly
lit circular room. There were
paintings hanging in the dining
room which added to the re
staurant's authentic Armenian
atmosphere. Each painting de
picted a scene from Omar
Khayyam's Rubaiyat, a collec
tion of poems.
Before our meal, we were
served champagne cocktails
($1.25 each) along with Arme
nian hors d'oeuvres which we
could have eaten all night. The
Vaprak Sarma (grape leaves
stuffed with rice and chopped
meat), was gone in two min
utes. Along with this, we had
crisp carrots, green peppers,
and pita bread with rose petal
preserve. One warning about
the preserve — it is very sweet!

Next we had a bowl of the
soup du jour, which was a
creamy chicken with rice soup.
A salad also went with our
meal. This was raw spinach
topped with bits of egg and
cheese mixed in an oil and vin
egar dressing.
The entree was a filling
course for both of us. I had
Armenian Tchakhokhbelli
Chicken ($8.50) while my
friend had Curried Lamb Pilaff
($8.50). The Tchakhokhbelli
was tender chicken jointed and
sauteed in sherry wine and to
mato sauce. Served with this
was rice pilaff (rice which is
steamed, buttered, and sea
soned), which was very moist
and tasty. My friend's curried
lamb was served over this rice

and topped with an apricot.
The lamb was delicately spiced
and extremely tender.
Other entrees on the menu
include such dishes as Roast
Duck ($9); Kouzou Ka Kzartma
($9), a lamb served in a broth
with vegetables; Patlijan
($8.50), a dish consisting of
baked eggplant and lamb; and
of course, one or two non-
Armenian dishes such as Filet
Mignon Steak ($9.75) or New
York Steak ($9.75).
Our dessert was almost an
entree in itself. We were
served pastries similar to bak
lava made with walnuts, cin
namon, and honey. We also
managed to finish off the dish
of apricot-topped coconut ice
cream that was included with

the meal.
To conclude the dinner we
had Omar's coffee, a pleasant
blend which was neither too
weak nor strong.
The service that we received
was excellent; the food was
promptly brought to our table
after we had ordered. Our wai
ter, Kerop, was friendly, espe

daily in explaining to us what
ingredients made up each dish
on the menu. He also filled us
in on a little of Omar
Khayyam's past history.
During World War Two,
Omar Khayyam's would close
to the public once a week in
order to open only for ser
vicemen. Back then, a person
could eat at Omar's while

being entertained since there
was a stage in one corner of the
room. Omar's was also chosen
as the official restaurant of
the 1945 United Nations open
ing.
Omar Khayyam's is open
every day for lunch and dinner
except on Sundays and Mon
days.

Omar Khayyam's, a
downtown San Francisco re
staurant, appears small and
unimporant-looking from the
outside. With the honking
cars, neon lights, and the bus
tle of pedestrians going by, we
almost passed this famous
Armenian restaurant. But once
we stepped inside and were
surrounded by its calm, eleg
ant atmosphere, the restaurant
seemed like an oasis. It was a
striking contrast to the hum of
