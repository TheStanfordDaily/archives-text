# Levi: judiciary's power greater than Congress'
## 
### Kevin Cox 
The judiciary has surpassed the legislative branch of
government as the planner and manager of public pol
icy, former U.S. Attorney General Edward Levi said here
last night.
Levi said he was concerned about the "vast array of
decision making" that occurs because of the judiciary's
discretionary powers. He called the U.S. Supreme Court
an example, saying that body's rulings affect the whole
governmental hierarchy.
He added there is not "sufficient consideration" of
the interpretation of these laws in the various levels of
government.
Levi said that laws are used to shield when they should
be used to supervise.
However, there is a need for some limited discretio
nary power by judges and prosecutors to interpret the
laws and establish precedents and policy, he added.
He cited the intervention of judges in what he called
the questionable operation of mental hospitals in

Alabama and similar facilities iri New York as construc
tive examples of such discretion.
"I admire the very American invention of a central
government institution (the judiciary) attempting to sort
out, from the issues of the day, those matters of princi
ple where special protection should be given," Levi said.
He said that civil rights and environmental issues were
other cases of "practical intervention."
The U.S. attorney general's failure to prosecute
former Central Intelligence Agency director (CIA)
Richard Helms for conducting a search of a photo studio
in 1971 is an example of the "negative discretionary
power" prosecutors have in choosing not to prosecute,
according to Levi.
However, Levi said some discretionary power for the
prosecution is needed.
"I don't suggest that the heavens would fall — they
seldom do — if the courts compelled prosecution," he
said. "I do think it would be unwise, as it would raise
questions of the separation of powers."
