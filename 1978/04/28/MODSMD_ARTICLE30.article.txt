La Creperie
La Maison Francaise
610 Mayfield Ave.
Stanford
Complete with a bereted maitre d' and
cafe atmosphere, La Creperie is a charm
ing spot for dinner and desserts on Satur
day nights.
The residents of La Maison Francaise
who run this campus restaurant, have suc
cessfully attempted to simulate the aura of
an actual French cafe. Its checkered tab
lecloths, low lighting, freshly cut flowers
on the tables, and the constant hum of
pleasant chatter all contribute to the total
cafe atmosphere one feels at La Creperie.
We ordered the Diner Complete, fils,
which includes a dinner crepe, a dessert
crepe and soup or salad for the exception
ally reasonable price of $2.85. One com
panion ordered jambon, fromage, et oeuf
(ham, cheese and egg); another friend
sampled poulet (chicken) and I enjoyed
the epinards (spinach ) crepe, which also
included a bit of jack cheese. All three

were delicious.
Our only complaints were that the food
was not quite hot enough, and the cheese
in both the jambon, fromage et oeuf and
the epinards crepes was not entirely
melted.
The tomato soup was thick and stocked
with potatoes and green vegetables. It was
delectable, although lukewarm. The din
ner salads included lettuce, tomatoes,
mushrooms, cucumbers and shredded
carrots tossed in a light spiced dressing.
Desserts at La Creperie were pheno
menal. Much better heated than the main
courses, we enjoyed citron, a crepe of le
mon, butter and sugar, creme de marrons,
which has a chestnut spread filling, and of
course, the traditionally French crepe
suzette.
Speaking French to those who can con
verse in it, the waiters are very friendly and
accomodating. Sometimes, though, they
do need beckoning, and tend to lack train
ing, placing coffee cups on the wrong side
of the diner, and leaving dirty dinner
dishes on the table through dessert.

Run solely by residents of the French
theme house, the only requirement for
the six to eight staff positions is that the
employee knows what to do, according to
La Creperie's manager and maitre d', (on
Gibson. He laughingly told my compan
ions and me, "There are always enough
people to work, but there are never
people disappointed about not working."
A major problem in runninga restaurant
out of a house is the transition between
quarters. Business has picked upthis quar
ter, and Gibson attributes this to better
weather, longer days and more publicity.
Vet Gibson also says, "Taking too many
people is not good either, because then
customers have to wait."
La Creperie is opeaon Saturday nights
from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. Peak hours are from
7 p.m.-8:30 p.m., during dinner.
Because of its convenient campus loca
tion, La Creperie is an ideal spot where
one can run into friends unexpectedly
while enjoying a dessert and cafe francais
nightcap in a French cafe atmosphere.
