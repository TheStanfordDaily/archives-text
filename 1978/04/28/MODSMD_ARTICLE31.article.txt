Despite the profusion of Cantonese restaur
ants within a 20 minute drive of the campus,
there is only one Ming's. This restaurant posses
ses a mystique which makes it the banquet spot
for many Stanford groups.
It is the atmosphere and service, more than
the food itself, which put Ming's well ahead of
its El Camino competitiors. Though the food is
quite good, our meal contained nothing that
could be regarded as ambrosia, and even had
several flaws.
More notable was the austere, yet impres
sive decor of the restaurant. The walls are bare,
but attractively paneled, and each dining area
features a huge live plant. The acoustics are ex
cellent, and the semi-separate dining areas keep
the large restaurant from taking a barn-like at
mosphere.
Service was prompt and courteous, not only
at our table, but also at the tables of nearby
customers.
A tour of the Ming's kitchen after our dinner
revealed an efficient operation. According to
host Bill Wang, the restaurant uses 10 cooks for
weekday dinners, and more on weekends. Only
the rice is prepared beforehand, with all other
dishes being cooked to order, Wang said.
In addition to several pages of a la carte offer
ings, Ming's has four full dinners. We chose the
"Ming" dinner, which at $9.50, is the restaur

ant's most expensive meal. It included several
house specialties.
The barbequed pork appetizer was far more
tender, though not as lean, as is customary in
most restaurants. Preferable was the Crab Ran
goon: delicately seasoned and tasty. The won
ton soup featured generous portions of mush
rooms and a remarkably thick broth.
The most outstanding course ot the meal was
the chicken salad. It was an excellent blend of
shredded chicken, scallions, lettuce, chopped
almonds and dry noodles, enhanced by a light
mustard sauce.
The main courses ranged from fair to excel
lent. The snow peas were moist and crunchy in a
manner other restaurants should strive to emu
late. The Vang Chow fried rice was also quite
good, and included eggs, shrimp and bean
sprouts.
However, we did find a few faults with two of
the main dishes. The beef was a bit overcooked,
and its sauce was somewhat too sweet for our
liking. So overpowering was the lemon taste in
the lemon chicken, that we could only identify
the meat by texture.
The ginger sundae dessert was an unfortunate
meeting of East and West; there is no way to
reconcile the two tastes. Portions of the preced
ing courses, however, tended to be large
enough that only a reviewer would want to sam
ple dessert anyway. Most diners will probably
be sated well before the food runs out.
In fact, some patrons may be satisfied before
their appetizer is served, in light of Ming's con
siderable extra-culinary appeal.
