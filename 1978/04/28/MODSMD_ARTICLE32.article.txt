# Cardinal nine confront Bruins in critical series
## snorts 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Halfway through league
play, the Stanford baseball
team isn't leading the Pacific-8
Southern Division, but it's not
out of the race, either. With
nine games yet to play and one
tie with Berkeley still to be
completed, the Cardinals' 3-5-1
league record hasn't removed
them from contention.
This weekend the team will
be in Los Angeles facing the
UQ A Bruins for the last time
this year in a three-game series
at Sawtelle Field. The two
teams will play a 2:30 contest
this afternoon, and a noon
doubleheader is on tap tomor
row.
UCLA, after dropping three
games to USC last weekend,
comes into the series with a 4-5
record and virtually in the same
position as the Cardinals. The
Trojans lead the Southern Divi
sion with a 6-2 mark.
"There are a lot of games left
to play," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "Even
with as poorly as we pitched
this past week, we could easily
turn things around and play
phenomenally. All we can do is
hope we put it all together this
weekend and have a good
series."
Pitching slips
The pitching has been a
problem for the Cards re
cently, and combined with
several other factors, has led to
the recent flurry of losses. Of
fensively, a few of the key Stan
ford batters have been in a
slump, and the Cards have
stranded nearly a dozen
baserunners per game. Their
late-game rallies have been
unable to overcome large de
ficits.
Bad breaks have also played
a role in the recent outings.
Even though the Stanford bat
ters have been hitting the ball
hard, the shots have often
been right at someone. But
while the Cards have been hit
ting "at 'em" balls, their op
ponents have come up with

drop-in singles and extra-base
foul line shots that would just
be long strikes if they had
landed one inch to the right or
left.
"We haven't gotten the 'big
hit' lately," said Marquess.
"We've had the bases loaded
with two men down (against
Caf) and would hit a hard line
drive that would be caught by
one of the fielders. If one had
just been five inches higher, it
would've scored a couple of
runs."
Hinojosa slowed
The Stanford defense will
remain essentially the same
with the exception of left field,
where John Pyle could possibly
start in place of Pepe Hinojosa.
Marquess will wait and see
how Hinojosa, who has been
bothered by minor injuries
lately, and Pyle perform in
pre-game batting practice and
infield.
Gary Scott may start one of
the games at third base this
weekend after coming off a
good performance against Cal.
Scott went two-for-six in the
two games he played in Ber
keley— driving in one run and
scoring another.
Bruce Walters and Phil Wil
son will trade off calling the
pitches in the series. Walters is
scheduled to catch today's
game, and he and Wilson will
split the duties in the doub
leheader tomorrow.
On the mound for the Cards
today will be Joe LoPresti, the
lefthanded junior who turned
in two excellent relief perfor
mances against Cal. LoPresti
has a 4-1 record with a 1.59 ERA
in 39-2/3 innings.
Kuhn going
Larry Kuhn will get a start in
the first game tomorrow. Kuhn
has been one of the stronger
pitchers on the Stanford staff
this year, but has run into prob
lems lately — especially with
his control. The starting
pitcher for the final game has
not been selected yet, but

Marquess plans to go with
either Mark Abbondola, Brian
Harrison or Rob Irwin, depend
ing on who has not been
needed in relief.
When Stanford met UCLA
earlier this season, the Cards
took two of the three games in
Sunken Diamond. Stanford
won the first game 8-7 on a
tenth inning solo homerun by
Tom Cuardino. The Cards
came up with three runs in the
bottom of the ninth inning to
win Saturday's first game 10-9
but let the final game go to the
Bruins 4-2.
Cuardino may be swinging
for the fences this weekend in
an attempt to tie a Stanford re
cord. The 6-foot-2'/2, 201 lb.
senior has 12 homeruns this
season and only needs one
more to match Bruce Robin
son's 1975 mark. Cuardino hit
three against Cal last weekend.
