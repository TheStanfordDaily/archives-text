# Speed meets favored Cal
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
Stanford's speed and California's strength will be on display
tomorrow when the Cards take on the Bears in the Big Meet at
Berkeley.
Coach Payton Jordan's Cardinals boast a collection of short
distance runners that are as capable as any in the Pacific-8 while
Erv Hunt's Bears have the depth in the field events that should
outclass Stanford.
The speed of Stanford's talented corps of runners, led by
senior lames Lofton and including Alan Sheats, Gordon Banks,
Darrin Nelson and Paul McCarthy, gives Jordan confidence in the
track events.
However, Jordan is hesitant to predict that the Cardinals will
take the meet. He said, "I've tried everything to dope out a way to
beat the suckers and the best I can come up with is Cal 78-76. We
will have to have everything go right to be able to pull an upset."
Hunt agreed with Jordan in declaring the Cards an underdog,
but only in the field events. "We ought to be a favorite in every
thing except against Lofton in the long jump."
Led by senior Paul Santiago in the shot put and discus and pole
vaulter Larry Hintz, Cal indeed presents an awesome crew of
fieldmen.
To counter Cal's obvious strength in the field, Jordan expects
strong performances from Rick Buss in the discus, Doug Green
wood in the shot put, and John Littleboy in the high jump.
In order to keep Cal off balance, Jordan is entering his sprinters
in most of the races.
"We want to keep them confused and not let them know who
will be running where. Lofton is entered in seven events, Banks in
three, and Sheats in three," said Jordan.
Jordan said this year's Card squad is "the most mentally deter
mined I have had in a number of years. We are a gutty team."
Jordan also said he feels fortunate that "we are surprisingly
healthy. It is a tribute to our trainers that for a team so active, we
are probably the least injury-prone in the nation."
Bears hurl
Hunt is unable to say the same thing, though. Five Bears are
definitely out of the meet, and another, Montreal Olympian
Quentin Wheeler, is questionable.
"Depth doesn't mean much at this point," said Hunt. "I would
have said so earlier in the year, but we are skimpy in some areas
now. I'm still looking for someone to run the 400 meters."
Hunt added, however, "Being on our own track has got to help.
Also, we always get up a little bit more for Stanford."
Hunt said he sees the Cards as a "competitive, but not a bitter
rival. We would like nothing better than to end the season on a
good note."
Jordan said he is sure that if the meet is close down the wire,
Stanford will win. "The last event is the mile relay. If it comes to
that, we are not going to give them the meet. Character will win
this meet."
According to Hunt, Cal will have to "take the field events and
try to stay close in the track events."
Character and speed vs. strength and the home field. A strug
gle that sounds epic in nature. When it's the Big Meet, though, it
is epic.

will be running where. Lofton is entered in seven events, Banks in
three, and Sheats in three," said Jordan.
Jordan said this year's Card squad is "the most mentally deter
mined I have had in a number of years. We are a gutty team."
Jordan also said he feels fortunate that "we are surprisingly
healthy. It is a tribute to our trainers that for a team so active, we
are probably the least injury-prone in the nation."
Bears hurl
Hunt is unable to say the same thing, though. Five Bears are
definitely out of the meet, and another, Montreal Olympian
Quentin Wheeler, is questionable.
"Depth doesn't mean much at this point," said Hunt. "I would
have said so earlier in the year, but we are skimpy in some areas
now. I'm still looking for someone to run the 400 meters."
Hunt added, however, "Being on our own track has got to help.
Also, we always get up a little bit more for Stanford."
Hunt said he sees the Cards as a "competitive, but not a bitter
rival. We would like nothing better than to end the season on a
good note."
Jordan said he is sure that if the meet is close down the wire,
Stanford will win. "The last event is the mile relay. If it comes to
that, we are not going to give them the meet. Character will win
this meet."
According to Hunt, Cal will have to "take the field events and
try to stay close in the track events."
Character and speed vs. strength and the home field. A strug
gle that sounds epic in nature. When it's the Big Meet, though, it
is epic.
