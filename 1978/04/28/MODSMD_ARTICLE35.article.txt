# Stanford badminton strives to dispel backyard image
## 
### Lyn Carlson 
Mention the word "badmin
ton," and most people's eyes
take on a nostalgic haze. They
are instantly transported back
to fifth grade, and can almost
feel the muggy air of a summer
afternoon, smell the scent of
barbecued hamburgers waft
ing in the breeze, and taste the
tang of Grandma's fresh
squeezed lemonade. There
they are, blissfully batting the
birdie back and forth over the
"Woolworth's Special" bad
minton net, racquet in one
hand, lemonade glass in the
other — without worrying in
the least about the possibility
of a strenuous shot causing the
lemonade to spill. After all, in
badminton there is no such
thing as "a strenuous shot."
Badminton aficionados, un
derstandably, are not amused
by the game's image as merely
a charming piece of
Americana. "This backyard
image is a curse," said Don
West, vice president of the Un
ited States Badminton Associa
tion.
Members of Stanford's
badminton team are also
cursed with the game's per
nicious stereotype as a
namby-pamby, unmacho
sport. They described some of
the reactions they get from
people upon mentioning that
they play badminton. Susan
Fischer said, "They laugh and
say Badminton is a sportV "
She added, "It's very frustrat
ing." Pam Mayerfeld, presi
dent of the team, said, "They

say 'Oh, there's a badminton
team here.' And they snicker."
Halsey Royden said, "I get a lot
of ribbing.''
As a result of the persecu
tion, badminton players are
usually quite happy, if not glee
ful, about opportunities to set
the record straight. West said
occasionally a scoffer turns up
at a Peninsula Badminton Club
practice to laugh at the players.
But when the critic is invited
— with a lamb-like look of in
nocence — to try playing a
game, "He gets his clock
cleaned by some fat old man.
We don't hear from him
again." West added "It's a ple
asure, I tell you."
Badminton players, how
ever, are not spiteful, vindic
tive creatures who go around
with racquets poised, ready to
flatten anyone who dares
snickeratthe game. Usually no
one snickers, because usually,
no one even cares. Badminton
has never gotten enough ex
posure in the United States for
people to find out what it really
is. As a result, the U.S. is mis
sing out on a sport that many
other countries play with zeal.
Popular elsewhere
Roger Chen, a graduate stu
dent who is one of the coaches
of the Stanford team, said, "In
other parts of the world, this
game is so popular you
wouldn't believe it." Badmin
ton is the equivalent of the
U.S.'s baseball in some coun
tries. It is particularly strong in
Indonesian countries, where
fathers give their newborn

sons badminton racquets in
stead of baseball gloves.
Pakorn Boonyakurkul, a
Stanford student who is a na
tive of Thailand, said some
Thais will practice up to 10
hours a day. Other badminton
hotbeds are England and De
nmark. In Canada the badmin
ton program is subsidized by
the government. Champion
ship matches elsewhere in the
world will draw up to 10,000
people.
In the U.S., however,

matches are lucky to draw a
throng of 10 people, mostly
consisting of friends, spouses,
girlfriends and other obliging
souls. It seems that one of the
things a player must develop is
a flexible arm in order to pat
himself on the back — since it
is unlikely that anyone else will
pat him on the back.
Sports Illustrated devotes a
grand total of about 12 column
inches per year to the sport.
Newspaper editors mechani
cally crumple up letters plead

ing desperately for greater
badminton coverage. There is
only one store in the country
that specializes in badminton.
The store, located in Los Al
tos, is named Badminton-
Tennis by Willie (note the or
der), and is owned by Willie
Takaki, a veteran of badminton
for 35 years. Takaki is a former
industrial artist who decided
seven years ago to devote a
store to badminton. But even
so, he sells more tennis
equipment than badminton

equipment. When asked jok
ingly if it broke his heart to
have to sell tennis equipment
to make ends meet, he said
"Yes, it does, in a way."
Despite the mournful state
of badminton on the national
level, at Stanford badminton
seems to be growing in popu
larity. Shirley Schoof, faculty
advisor to the badminton
team, said, "Interest has really
begun to skyrocket." When
she first started teaching the
game here six years ago, the
classes weren't even filled up.
Today, 40 people will show up
for the first day of class.
Interest up
Interest has also picked up in
the team as a result. Mayerfeld
said, "Last year, the team
wasn't much of anything." This
year, there are about 25 people
participating. They have won
four out of the last six matches.
At a large invitational match in
Fresno, they won the trophy
for the best overall school,
beating out six other schools.
Ellen Fritts commented, "I
think the team is really excited.
Most of the people realize this
is only the beginning." The
team is expected to do well
next year because nearly all the
players will be back, and there
is a strong nucleus of under
classmen. At present the team
has "club varsity status,"
meaning it receives no money
from the University. The team
is a member of the Northern
California Athletic Conference
and competes against four
other schools.

Today and tomorrow the
Cards' top players will be tak
ing part in the NorCal Champ
ionships at Santa Clara. They'll
be coming off last Sunday's 8-7
win over Cal at Roble Gym. The
Cards also shut out St. Mary's
15-0 last week, but were
trounced 13-2 by league power
Fresno State.
Two graduate students vol
unteer their time to coach,
Chen and Darryl Whitten. The
membe r s have varied experi
ence in competing. Some went
to high schools with good
badminton programs. Blair
Pickerell said his school, Ber
keley High, was "extremely
strong in badminton." Others
practice only a few hours a
week; others, like Whitten, are
in there "whenever there
aren't any basketball players."
But despite differing levels in
competence and rabid devo
tion, Sheila Lindsay said,
"Everyone seems really in
terested — people are willing
to help people who are lower
on the totem pole. There is a
loose and informal attitude."
If you'd like to actually try
your hand at this bizarre sport,
bring your $2 Woolworth Spe
cial racquet to Roble gym some
afternoon. It's open for free
play Monday and Wednesday
afternoons from 2 to 3, Friday
from noon to 5, and Sunday
from noon to 3. If you have the
fortune (or misfortune) of play
ing against one of the team
members, it's virtually guaran
teed that you'll never snickerat
the game again.
