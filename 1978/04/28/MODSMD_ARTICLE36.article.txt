# Overcome slow start
## Booters blitz Broncos 
### Dean Eyre 
The women's soccer team
maintained its winning ways
with a 5-0 victory over Santa
Clara Wednesday afternoon at
Roble Field.
The I's, nowB-1-1, were beat
ing themselves in the first half
with poor communication
among players and an inability
to move the ball. Stanford took
11 shots on goal, but was un
able to effectively penetrate
the Broncos' defense. Santa
Clara's forwards couldn't mus
ter much of an offensive threat,
so the half ended in a 0-0 dead
lock.
Sue Handel broke the ice in
the second half by scoring two
goals within three minutes
shortly before the middle of
the second half. Kris McGarrey
added two goals, one on an as
sist by Maria Duryea, to make it
a 4-0 game. Handel kicked the
last goal for the Cardinals with
assists from Sonja Schoeppel
and Ellen Criep.
"I was satisfied with the
game," said head coach Phil
Wright. "At halftime I was a lit
tle scared that we might not be
able to really pull together,
score a goal and win. When we
scored the second, we really
started playing our game —
moving, spreading the ball out,
using the side of the field and
totally dominating after that.
"Sue played a fantastic
game. Kris came through — a
beautiful head ball pounded
into the corner. She didn't
have a great game; sometimes

she doesn't do things right, but
when she gets in front of the
goal, she can put it in. Cindy
(Shorney) has been a key to our
team with her hard work in the
midfield; Cindy and Sue have
really complemented each
other beautifully — I was really
pleased with that," said
Wright.
"Defensively, I thought
Maria was distributing better
than she had in a long time and
they (Santa Clara) weren't re
ally a serious threat," Wright
added.
Overconfidence
Since the Cards beat Santa
Clara 8-0 in their first meeting,
including four goals in the first
15 minutes of the game, the
Cards might have been taking
the Broncos lightly. Instead of
rolling up a quick score, Stan
ford found itself frustrated by a
more challenging Santa Clara
team.
"We weren't expecting any
sort of game — we had a little
pressure for a long time and
that's good for us. I think it (the
pressure) will help us in the
long run a lot more than just
winning the game would
help," Wright said.
The I's now head for Col
orado to play two games to
morrow and one or two games
Sunday at Colorado Springs in
a tournament sponsored by
Colorado College.
"We have lacked intensity
and I think going to Colorado is
going to give us a chance to get
psyched enough that we'll

have intensity to play," Handel
said.
"We have good individual ta
lent and we're finally pulling
together as a team," Schoep
pel added.

moving, spreading the ball out,
using the side of the field and
totally dominating after that.
"Sue played a fantastic
game. Kris came through — a
beautiful head ball pounded
into the corner. She didn't
have a great game; sometimes

she doesn't do things right, but
when she gets in front of the
goal, she can put it in. Cindy
(Shorney) has been a key to our
team with her hard work in the
midfield; Cindy and Sue have
really complemented each
other beautifully — I was really
pleased with that," said
Wright.
"Defensively, I thought
Maria was distributing better
than she had in a long time and
they (Santa Clara) weren't re
ally a serious threat," Wright
added.
Overconfidence
Since the Cards beat Santa
Clara 8-0 in their first meeting,
including four goals in the first
15 minutes of the game, the
Cards might have been taking
the Broncos lightly. Instead of
rolling up a quick score, Stan
ford found itself frustrated by a
more challenging Santa Clara
team.
"We weren't expecting any
sort of game — we had a little
pressure for a long time and
that's good for us. I think it (the
pressure) will help us in the
long run a lot more than just
winning the game would
help," Wright said.
The I's now head for Col
orado to play two games to
morrow and one or two games
Sunday at Colorado Springs in
a tournament sponsored by
Colorado College.
"We have lacked intensity
and I think going to Colorado is
going to give us a chance to get
psyched enough that we'll

have intensity to play," Handel
said.
"We have good individual ta
lent and we're finally pulling
together as a team," Schoep
pel added.
