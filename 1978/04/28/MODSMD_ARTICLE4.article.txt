# University committees: looking into everything
## 
### Michelle Vaughen 
At a campus of more than 11,000
students, who is going to listen seri
ously to one individual's idea for im
proving the Bookstore, suggestion
for bike safety, or complaint about
the health service?
About 46 University committees,
each consisting of students, faculty
and trustees, have been set up for
just that purpose, according to )anet
Rappaport, ASSU committee staff as
sistant.
' "There are committees dealing
with everything,'' she said. "They're
a really important way for students to
have a say in what goes on in the
University. Not a lot of people use
them, but those that do usually get
results."
In addition to monitoring student
complaints and suggestions, com
mittees such as Commission on In
vestment Responsibility and the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US), serve as task forces
and advisory boards to the president

and the Board of Trustees.
"The committees work invisibly,"
Rappaport said. "Most people are
not even aware" of what they do.
Some 260 students though, are
more than aware of the committees.
These students applied recently to
fill about 122 student committee pos
itions for next year.
Applications were turned in last
Friday and screened earlier this
week. About 230 of these applicants
will be interviewed. Interviews begin
Monday, and will continue for the
next three weeks.
"We'd like to give everyone an in
terview," said ASSU Co-president
Steve Westly, and chairperson of the
ASSU Nominations Committee
(Nom Com). "But if it looks like
someone just scribbled their name
down, then we feel that person
doesn't warrant an interview."
Westly said he is "really impre
ssed" with the pool of applicants.
"On the basis of the applications,
they (the applicants) seem highly

qualified," Rappaport said. "People
really went all out this year."
Final approval
On the basis of the interviews, 122
students are selected by the Nom
Com, a committee of six students.
The names are then submitted to the
ASSU Senate and to President
Richard Lyman for final approval.
The Nom Com is "looking for
people with a knowledge of what's
going on, and who have shown some
effort to gain information and
background on the committee
they're applying for," Rappaport
said.
"We're also looking for someone
who can work with the administra
tion and faculty members, and will
keep pushing their own ideas all
year," she continued.
Rappaport said some of the most
popular committees, in terms of the
highest number of applicants, are
C-US, Advisory Commission on
Budget Planning, Committee on Un
dergraduate Admissions and Finan

ci a I Aid, Committee on Foreign
Study Programs, Committee on Ser
vices to Students, Committee on
Public Events, and the Committee on
Land and Building Development.
There are "a lot of really qualified
people vying for a few positions,"
Rappaport said. For example, C-US
has 50 people applying for two spots,
she said.
Rappaport said the trustee com
mittees are also popular, although
these student positions are less ef
fective.
'Nothing'
The trustee committees are "pre
stigious, but as far as being an impor
tant tool for students to use, they're
nothing," she added.
Some of the lesser known commit
tees which require a specialized in
terest, such as the Panel on Recom
binant DNA Molecules, have fewer
applicants, Rappaport said.
Committee membership is divided
roughly into thirds among students,
faculty and trustees. Members have

equal voting status.
"The fact that we have faculty
members and administratorsoneach
committee makes each a legitimate
body, from the standpoint of the
people making the decisions and
policies on campus," Rappaport
said.
"Generally, the committee's re
commendations are carried
through."
Westly said the committees have
potential, but every now and then
they're not used as much as they
could be.
"Every decision made on this cam
pus is made through committees.
But sometimes the committee results
are not listened to." For example, he
said, the CIR recently recommended
voting for a Texaco proxy resolution
in favor of South Africa withdrawal.
But the trustees rejected the CIR re
commendation, voting against the
proxy, he said.
The committees are "good in
