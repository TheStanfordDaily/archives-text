Bell 'blocked' probe of FBI
Washington — Attorney General Griffin Bell under
mined the Justice Department's investigation of the FBI
and also blocked possible indictments against eight
middle-level FBI officials, the man who headed the
probe said yesterday.
William Gardner told a Senate appropriations sub
committee that Bell effectively halted the probe by refus
ing to let prosecutors seek perjury indictments against
an unspecified number of FBI officials whom the task
force believed were lying.
Without the threat of perjury charges, Gardner said,
his Usk force had no leverage with which to force agents
to tell the truth about allegedly illegal FBI activities.
Gardner said Bell also refused to let prosecutors seek
indictments of eight mid-level officials on charges of
wiretapping, mail theft, break-ins or black bag jobs,
perjury and false statements to a government agency.
He said the officials, some of whom still work for the
FBI, included three squad leaders, four special agents in
charge of divisions and one assistant director.
Gardner, who resigned as head of the investigation
task force last December, did not name any of the offi
cials.
Bell had no immediate comment.
Afghanistan's government toppled
New Delhi, India — Rebel forces in Afghanistan
claimed yesterday to have overthrown the authoritarian
government of President Mohammed Daoud after
armor and air attacks on the presidential headquarters
and other government buildings in the capital of Kabul.
The rebel claim, broadcast on Kabul Radio, could not
be immediately confirmed — many lines of communica
tion were cut to the landlocked, mountainous nation.
But in London, diplomatic dispatches and reports of
monitored radio broadcasts from the Afghan capital said
the armed forces had seized control and "wiped out"
Daoud's family.
Many bodies were seen in Kabul's streets after several
hours of heavy fighting, said diplomatic sources here in
contact with eyewitnesses in Kabul.
Gen. Abdul Qadir, who described himself as chief of
defense forces, said in the rebel broadcast monitored
here that a military revolutionary council had taken con
trol of the Texas-size nation of 20 million people,
wedged between Pakistan, Iran and the Soviet Union.
Harvard to keep disputed stocks
Cambridge, Mass. — Harvard has rejected student
backed demands the university pull out money and
holdings in banks and corporations doing business in
South Africa to protest that country's racial policies,
according to a report disclosed yesterday.
The Harvard Corporation report, published in the
Harvard Crimson, said the corporation rejected severing
connections with firms in South Africa "on the ground
that it is surely more appropriate for shareholders to use
their position to try to persuade management to aban
don unethical practices rather than simply 'cut and
run.' "
Arms spending report released
Stockholm, Sweden —The world is spending almost $1
million a minute on arms, 20 times more than indus
trialized nations spend to help poorer countries, the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said
yesterday.
Current worldwide military expenditures total $400

billion and "with the current rate it will top $1 trillion by
the end of the century," SIPRI Chairman Dr. Frank Bar
naby said in releasing the group's 1978 edition of "World
Armaments and Disarmament."
Barnaby, who is British, said worldwide military
spending is twice as high as the yearly gross domestic
product of the whole of Africa, about the same amount
as the gross domestic product of all Latin America and 20
times more than the total annual development assis
tance given by industrialized nations to the developing
world.
The two great superpowers account for more than half
the world's military spending. In 1977, the U.S. defense
budget was $98 billion, compared with a CIA estimate of
$130 billion — at American prices — for the Soviet Un
ion.
Singlaub in trouble again
Washington — Outspoken Maj. Gen. John Singlaub
was called to account today for the second time in less
than a year for publicly criticizing President Jimmy Car
ter's policies.
The heavily decorated Singlaub, a combat veteran of
three wars, was summoned to the Pentagon from his
Atlanta post to explain to Army leaders his blast at Car
ter's decision not to produce the neutron warhead and
his public disagreement with the Carter-backed Panama
Canal treaties.
The 56-year-old Singlaub, chief of staff of the Army
Forces Command, told ROTC cadets at Georgia Tech
yesterday that Carter's shelving of the neutron warhead
was militarily unsound,
"I think the decision not to produce the neutron
bomb without some compensating concession from the
other side is like throwing your trump card away in a
game of bridge," Singlaub said. "I think it's ridiculous."
Singlaub also told the cadets that the Panama Canal
treaties, ratified by the Senate after months of intense
lobbying by the administration, were unnecessary. He
said he was concerned about ties between Panama and
Cuba and worried that Panama might put restrictions on
use of the canal.
About 11 months ago, Singlaub was ordered home
from South Korea by Carter after the general publicly
opposed the president's plan to withdraw U.S. ground
troops from that country. Singlaub said the plan would
lead inevitably to war.
The general, then chief of staff of U.S. forces in Korea,
had a 30-minute meeting with Carter and several days
later was reassigned to the comparable job at the com
mand headquarters in Atlanta.
