SOC Disorientation Week ended Sunday and campus
reactions to the series of events have been varied.
The program included speakers representing differ
ing minority concerns and social issues. Speech topics
ranged from aspects of what Angela Davis called the
"new racism," to gay rights. Other activities included
panel discussions, workshops and lectures.
ASSU Senate chairperson Fred Grethel, an SOC
.member, said he believed that although the direct im
pact was not very apparent, Disorientation Week ac
tivities did help factions within the community to ex
press their views.
Grethel said he felt the week "helped to get people
excited about being involved in more participatory
programs" within the Stanford community.
However, some people felt Disorientation Week was
not nearly as successful as they had envisioned. Some
feit the effort to organize the events was worthwhile, but
lack of student participation at some of the events dis
couraged others, especially those involved in organizing
the programs.
Phyllis Brown, a member of the Disorientation Week
publicity committee, said there is "a problem with stu
dent's orientation here. Students only seem to be recep

tive to education in a classroom/' she added, and many
"can't see history as it happens here."
Grethel said he believed the major weakness of the
week was centered upon organization and scheduling.
He added he believed the lack of student support was
linked to "time problems" of students here.
Brown said she thought it possible that publicity for
the event wasn't sufficient. However, she said she was
bewildered by what she called student apathy. She said,
"I would like to understand why people weren't more
involved."
Kim McCall, Disorientation Week finance manager,
said people "learned a lot" from the week. McCall said,
"People went to enough events, so they did learn some
thing."
McCall said he also felt that attendance at the major
events was "really excellent." McCall said he was con
vinced that one of the most positive aspects of the week
consisted of convincing people at Stanford "that people
here are really different."
In contrast, Brown and Grethel added that they were
pleased by the response they received from the ad
ministration. Brown said that the administration "really
helped us in the week. They were glad to see students
organizing themselves in groups."
