# 51 fall to deaths as scaffolding on construction site collapses

### 
St. Marks, W. Va. (AP) â€” Fifty-one construction work
ers plunged screaming to their deaths yesterday
when a scaffold inside a power company cooling
tower collapsed and crashed 168 feet to the ground.
Nine of the victims were members of one family.
"They knew what was happening, but there wasn't
anything they could do about it," said one witness.
Many of the nearly 1000 other construction workers
at the Pleasants Power Station site rushed to the base
of the huge cylindrical concrete tower and began
clawing at the twisted mass of steel and rubble in a
vain effort to rescue their co-workers.
State police said all 51 men who were atop the
metal scaffold died.
"There was so much stuff there on the ground that
you couldn't see the bodies," said Bill Hess, a 22-
year-old laborer.
"There wasn't a sound coming from it. They were

torn up so bad, I couldn't tell looking at them
whether any of my friends had been killed."
West Virginia Gov. Jay Rockefeller's office said it
was the worst non-coal mine construction accident in
state history and possibly in U.S. history.
Monongahela Power said the structure was about
one-third completed. A spokesman said the diameter
at the base was 360 feet and the tower was to be 430
feet tall when finished.
In Washington, a spokesman for the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration said 13 inspections
of the Pleasants Power Station site since 1973 had
revealed "numerous violations, both serious and
non-serious," but he said he did not know what they
were.
Spokesman James Foster said the most recent in
spection was a year ago and that the operations of
Research Cottreil Inc., the subcontractor building the
tower, had never been inspected.
