# Begin's recipe for disaster

"Nothing is lacking for the making
of peace but the Arab persistence ir
denying Israel's very right to exist.
Arab refusal to acquiesce in our exis
tence alongside the Arab States,
abides. The only way to peace is
through a change in that recalcitr
ance. When it changes, there will no
longer obstacles to peace
negotiations." These were the words
of former Prime Minister, Golda
Meir, addressing the Israeli Parlia
ment, May 26, 1970.
Israel's political leaders, its sup
porters everywhere, and the Israeli
population itself have reiterated this
concept for the past 30 years. Yet,
when the opportunity finally arose
for this dream to come true, as a con
sequence of Egyptian President
Sadat's visit to Jerusalem on Nov. 26,
1977, Israel's Prime Minister,
Menachem Begin, reacted to this in
itiative by telling a group of French
Jews," "We never asked your presi
dent or your government or any
other president or general to recog
nize our right to exist."
It is quite unfortunate to have wit
nessed, due to the intransigence of
Begin, loss of an opportunity for
peace in the Middle East, one that
might not come again. History will
blame the Israeli government, par
ticularly Begin, along with those who
supported Israel's policies and con
tinued to excuse Israel's attacks on
the Palestinian people and other
Arabs. If the Arabs' persistence in not
recognizing Israel is no longer the
problem, then is the real problem
that Israel refuses to recognize its
neighbors right to exist?
Peace-making hampered
It is sad that those of us who aspire
to a just and lasting peace for all
peoples in the area could be ham
pered by the politics of a man who, it
seems, will not be satisfied until he
brings destruction upon himself, his
people, and the neighboring coun
tries. The Israeli invasion of Southern
Lebanon is one of many examples.
Ihe Israeli mighty power machine
brought destruction to over 80 per
cent of all the I ebanese villages and
towns in the South, adding a total of
260,000 refugees to those displaced
by Israel in the 1948 and 1967 wars.
The devastating cluster bombs
(CBU's), supplied by the U.S. and
used in violation of the arms sales
agreement, killed 1700 Palestinian
and Lebanese civilians, 250 guerillas,
and injured many others.
While the Israeli government
claims that the invasion of Lebanon
was intended to wipe out the Pales
tine Liberation Organization (PLO)
and to retaliate for the Palestinian at
tack which killed 32 Israelis, was it
not also Begin's intention to add 4CX)

; square miles to his already occupiec
i Arab territories? It is quite clear thai
the invasion of Lebanon resulted ir
neither the destruction of the PLO
nor any progress toward peace anc
security for Israel.
Justifying invasion
Those who support Israel always
found many excuses to justify the in
vasion of Lebanon. They found ex
cuses to justify the occupation of the
West Bank, the Golan Heights, the
Sinai, and any possible territory that
Israel might occupy in the future.
They have also found "legitimate"
excuses to justify retaliations against
Palestinian refugee camps. One
must ask: Is there such an Israeli
action that might not be found ex
cusable?
Begin's policies, tactics and politi
cal fanaticism are perpetuated by an
essentially religious claim to Israeli
conquered Arab land. The Bible
states that when God spoke to Moses
at the foot of Mount Sinai in Exodus
23:31, He said, "And I will set your
bounds from the Red Sea to the Sea
of the Phillistines, and from the wil
derness to the Euphrates; for I will
deliver the inhabitants of the land
into your hand and you shall drive
them out before you." The problem
with this assertion is not only its
vagueness but its territorial potential
extent.
Perhaps Begin's intransigence will
help Israel aquire more land in the
short run, but the Israeli people, who
suffer and pay the price of intransi
gence, might not agree in the long
run. In fact, more than 30,000 Israelis
demonstrated in Tel-Aviv on April 3,
1978, against the policies of Begin.
Those Israelis desire an end to their
30 years of "ghetto" living in Israel
and aspire to an era of peace and
justice.
Begin, using his "divine" rights,
has stood fast against curtail
ment of Jewish settlements in the oc
cupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Since the 1967 occupation of the
West Bank, 48 Jewish settlements
have been established on land con
fiscated without compensation from
its original Palestinian owners.
Obstacle to peace
While one might be willing to
forget the past when Begin, then
head of the Irgun organiza
tion, ordered the massacre of Deir
Vassin, April 1948, where 225 Palesti
nian women and children were kil
led, the present is no better. Begin
continues to deny the Palestinian
people the right to self
determfinatibn arid' equal status.
While he can perfectly see the need
for an independent and free Jewish
state, he maintains his opposition for
an equal and independent Palesti-

nian state.
In his relationship with the Palesti
nian people, he replicates the
policies of apartheid in South Africa,
in fact he is the chairman of the
Israel-South Africa Committee.
South African Prime Minister John
Vorster, who was interned as a Nazi
during World War II (not to speak of
his record since), was welcomed
with honor in Israel. The Israeli gov
ernment even trains South African
soldiers in counterinsurgency
methods.
It is not only the Palestinians and
some Israelis who see Begin as an
obstacle to peace. Public opinion the
world over, can be summarized by
the London Observer's editorial on
July 24, 1977, "Begin's apparent
steadfast determination to hang on
to the West Bank, as well as to Gaza
and Jerusalem, is a recipe for disas
ter."
Begin is coming soon to meet with
President Jimmy Carter in
Washington. It might not be fair to
ask him to draw a map of Israel. The
Israeli government consistently re
fuses to draw maps. For Begin, maps
are a figment of the imagination.
His imagination has no bound
aries.
