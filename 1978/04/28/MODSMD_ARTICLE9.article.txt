# Alternative viewpoints worthy of funding

As Disorientation Week has concluded, I would
like to comment on the ASSU Senate funding con
troversy, and in particular, to last Friday's letter
(Daily, April 21) by Wally Smith, which I believe to
represent the views of more than one person.
He describes Disorientation Week activities in
the following statement, "It's not what you would
call a balanced program." Admittedly, per
sonalities such as Anita Bryant or Jimmy Carter
were not included, but the ideas of such people
are well-known. Those of the participants in Dis
orientation Week are not, and with the exception
of Paul Sweezy, neither the mass media nor Uni
versity courses (with the exception of SWOPSI)
explore these alternative viewpoints.
Well balanced program
When groups of such diversity (the minority or
ganizations, the independent houses, the gay and
anti-sexist groups, departmental organizations
such as The Committee of for Concerned Asian
Scholars and the Latin American Studies Depart
ment) organize activities of special interest to
each, the result is a program as well-balanced as
can be imagined. Just look at a Disorientation
Week calendar.
In his objection to the amount of funding prop
osed initially, "42 per cent spent on such a blat
antly political project is outrageous." Smith raises

two issues. First of all, he objects to such financial
support because of political content. To quote
from Aristotle, "Man is by nature a political ani
mal." We, the "educated elite" of this country,
need not be afraid of political discussion, and
moreover have an obligation to be politically in
formed in this "democracy."
Secondly, to categorize the week as solely polit
ical is to ignore the social aspects of us issues such
as apartheid in South Africa, racism in the U.S., gay
rights, or U.S. exploitation of Third World coun
tries. To the contrary, these are some of the most
important issues that we as morally responsible
people must face.
Insensitivity displayed
I also object to Smith's reference to SOC groups
as being "just fringe elements." Such disrespect
for and insensitivity towards the views and indi
viduals of any minority group (whether it be
race, political view, or sexual preference which
defines this) is one of the biggest problems in
contemporary America. Let's look at supporters of
Bakke who claim that minorities have ''made it,"
even in the face of government studies
show that it is four times more difficult for blacks
to get housing as it is for whites, even in the face of
government studies which say that the un
employment rate for black youth is several times

that of whites.
Let's look at our own Stanford University which
counts Asians as being white, despite the fact that
there are several Asian student organizations
which exist because the University does not pro
vide the special services that these students need.
Question was how much
In conclusion, I would like to comment on the
ASSU Senate funding controversy. Everyone in the
senate agreed that Disorientation Week was
worthy of its cost. The question was how much
could the senate afford to donate. We must also
consider why such a great sum of money was
asked for initially. First of all, the budget for the
week was very high. Future Disorientation Weeks
must be more careful in negotiations with perfor
mers and speakers.
They must be careful not to overly saturate a day
with activities. However, we must examine the
reasons why more money was not available from
out other sources. Were all possible sources con
tacted, and did these contribute the appropriate
furiding? And for future Wteks
(may they become Stanford tradition), fet us not
forget that student apathy in fee assessment voting
does not encourage the prospects of any student
activities.
