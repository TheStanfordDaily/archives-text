# NFL Draft: First round for Guy, James, Gordon?
## 
### David Georgette 
Gordon King and Conrad
Dobler on the same offensive
line? Joe Ferguson passing to
James Lofton? Guy Benjamin
handing off to Larry Csonka?
Whether these combina
tions will be possible next sea
son when the National Football
League kicks off its first 16-
game regular season will be
known tomorrow when the
league starts its annual draft of
senior college football players.
And while most scouts and
general managers say the col
lege crop is not as bountiful as
some in recent years, for Stan
ford the 1978 draft will rank as
the greatest ever on the Farm.
Three Cardinals — King, Lof
ton and Benjamin — are
guaranteed top choices, and all
could well be gone by the end
of the first round. Two addi
tional players from last year's
offense — wide receiver Bill
Kellar and guard Mark Hill —
are also expected to be drafted
somewhere in the middle of
the two-day, 12-round affair.
"Our opinion is it's a good
year," said Harry Buffington,
president of United Scouting,
an organization which supplies
preliminary information on all
the college seniors and ranks
them according to position for
16 of the NFL teams. "It may
not be as deep, but the eche
lon is good, and in that respect,
it might be better than some of
the recent drafts. When you
get down to the 11th and 12th
rounds, though, it might be
sort of thin."

Dick Steinberg, the director
of scouting for the Los Angeles
Rams, agreed. "This year's
draft is probably not as deep,"
he said, "but there's always
quality at the top. There's just
not the quantity this year."
Buffington's assessment that
the quality at the top is possibly
the best in recent years i$
borne out by the top three
Stanford prospects. "Gordon
King is as good as any lineman
drafted in recent years," said
Leigh Steinberg, Los Angeles
based attorney who has been
representing athletes for four
years. "He is the top-rated of
fensive tackle in the country.
He is far and away the most
proficient pass blocker in the
country, has incredible size
and sheer tenacity. Clubs are
just drooling waiting to get
their hands on him."
Stanford head coach Bill
Walsh concurred. "He's the
premier lineman in the coun
try as I see it. I expect him to be
starting next year at left tackle
— which is the most important
position in the offensive line
on pass blocking because the
quarterback has his back to
that side."
Houston, which traded with
Tampa Bay last week to obtain
the Buccaneers'and the draft's
No. 1 pick, has announced it
will select Heisman Trophy
winner Earl Campbell of Texas.
The second choice belongs to
Kansas City and the Chiefs are
expected to select a defensive
lineman — possibly Ross
Browner of Notre Dame or

mammoth Art Still from Ken
tucky.
New Orleans, which ac
quired Dobler during the
offseason in a trade with New
Orleans, will probably draft the
6-foot-2, 272 lb. King or re
ceiver Wes Chandler of Florida
with the third pick of the draft.
"Wes Chandler is the top
rated offensive receiver," said
attorney Steinberg. "Some
people consider Chandler to
be the best receiver to come
out of college in a few years.
And after Chandler will go Lof
ton."
Kick returner
Chandler's kick-returning
experience is apparently the
reason he is considered
slightly better than the 6-3,187
lb. Lofton, though the Card's
track accomplishments qualify
him as a better athlete, a factor
most teams usually consider in
making a choice.
New Orleans, which has
been near the bottom of the
NFL throughout its existence,
could probably use King more
than the 6-0, 190 lb. Chandler.
King said he would like to go to
a team that is already a winner,
or a team that is building. "Any
team that is drafting me is seri
ous about building," he ad
ded.
The New York )ets have the
fourth pick, and are apparently
going to take running back
Terry Miller of Oklahoma State
or possibly King if the Saints
don't grab him.
Buffalo drafts fifth, and the
Bills are going to take either

Chandler or Lofton. "We're
going to take the best athlete,"
said a Bills' spokesman. "James
Lofton is of great interest to us
in Buffalo, as well as through
out the rest of the NFL."
Lofton said he hasn't con
cerned himself recently with
where he will end up. "I don't
think about it any more," he
said. "I'll probably be going
back East somewhere. It
doesn't look like I'll be playing
for a contender."
Lofton's right, because if the
Bills don'ttake him, Green Bay,
which according to Publicity
Director Lee Remmel, needs
"immediate help on offense,"
will take either Miller or Lofton
with its sixth pick.
Other players who could
give the Packers some help on
offense include running back
Elvis Peacock from Oklahoma,
and receivers Ozzie Newsome
from Alabama and John Jeffer
son from Arizona State.
It seems likely that Lofton
could have a greater impact
immediately by going to the
Packers, since Green Bay plays
in the National Football Con
ference's Central Division, a
division which does not have
as many offensive stars as Buf
falo's division.
The 49ers choose seventh,
and are expected to take Notre
Dame's 6-6, 240 lb. tight end
Ken McAfee. The carbon copy
of the Raiders' Dave Casper,
also an Irish alumnus, he is the
second of the three Notre
Dame players expected to be

This year the Cards stand to have their best pro football draft of all time.
Virtually assured of first-round selection are quarterback Guy Benjamin
(above left), receiver James Lofton (above right) and offensive tackle Gor
don King (above).
taken in the first round.
Cincinnati, where Walsh
coached as an assistant for
eight years, has the eighth
pick, and will use it to take
King, if he's still available, or
offensive lineman Chris Ward
of Ohio State.
After the Bengals comes
Seattle, and though the Sea
hawks are expected to take a
defensive lineman like
Browner or Still, publicist Don
Andersen said they will "take
the best athlete available re
gardless of position. We've got
too many holes at too many
places."
The Giants are the highest
drafting team in the market for
a quarterback and they pick
10th. Benjamin and Pitt's Matt

Cavanaugh are the highest
rated passers, getting the nod
over Grambling's Doug Wil
liams "because they're major
college players," said the
Rams' Steinberg.
Benjamin has the edge on
Cavanaugh because he's
worked under Walsh's pro set
system. "In Guy, you have the
most advanced college quar
terback in the country this
year. He has a keen sense for
going for the jugular vein.
Some guys you put in, and no
thing happens. Put in Guy, and
something always happens,"
said attorney Steinberg, who's
representing Benjamin, King
and Kellar. "Where he'll be
drafted is interesting, I think
he'll go in the first round. Un
ited has him No. 1."

United is one of the two
large pool scouting systems
which supplies information to
their client teams. United and
BLESTQ-V, based in
Pittsburgh, each divide the
country into eight sectors, with
a scout covering the colleges in
his sector. United and
BLESTO-V also have scouts
who go from sector to sector,
along with one national scout,
The scouting pools then
compile a ranking of the
players. "It is used as a guide,
and then the club scouts take
over," said Buffington. "We
furnish information more than
anything. Some clubs use us
more than others. Some draft
the way we rank the players."
Walsh said he expects Ben-
jamin to be drafted in the first
round, but exactly when is un
certain "because you justdon't
have any way to predict. His
success will be dependent on
who drafts him. Hopefully,
he'll be able to develop."
Being drafted by a lowly
team usually means a rookie
quarterback will not be able to
count on the protection from
the offensive line an estab
lished team could provide.
Detroit follows the Giants,
and has expressed interest in a
quarterback, but a Lions'
spokesman said, "There's so
many areas where we need
help, we will just have to wait
and see who's left."
Lake Erie?
If Lofton is still available by
the time Cleveland gets to
make the No. 12 pick, the
Browns will take him. The
Browns are looking for a big
play wide receiver. "Lofton has
the abilities to make him a
great professional," said
Walsh, who said he expects
Lofton to be a first-year starter.
Kellar should be taken in the
middle rounds, according to
Walsh. "I'm hopeful he will be
drafted in the fourth- or fifth
round area, but you can't pre
dict what will happen. He's
capable of playing in the NFL,
and we're hopeful he'll be
picked by the right team."

Buffington said, "Kellar will
definitely be drafted."
"He's a very efficient and ac
complished receiver," said at
torney Steinberg. "The Ed
monton Eskimos (of the
Canadian Football League) are
also bidding on him. Theywant
him to play a slot position."
"I'd like to stay on the West
Coast if I could," said Kellar. "I
think I could fit in best on a
team with an offense like ours,
where they need a receiver to
get open underneath and run a
lot of curls to complement a
deep threat."
Hill, who started at both
center and guard for Stanford,
"somewhere down the line will
be drafted," said Buffington.
"Hill, we expect, we will be
drafted as a center," said
Walsh.
Advantage
"The o-liners (offensive
linemen) out of Stanford have a
good chance to make it," said
attorney Steinberg. "The thing
that helps them is they play the
pro set, and they had pro
coaches teaching them. Gor
don King is just eons advanced
in his skill in pass blocking."
Players represented by
Steinberg generally have a
good chance of getting into the
pros. "About a good 90 per
cent of them make it,"he said.
Steinberg, the student body
president at Cal in 1970,

graduated from Cal's law
school in 1974. As a dorm
counselor, Steinberg met Bear
quarterback Steve Bartkowski,
and then negotiated the then
largest rookie contract for
Bartkowski when he was the
draft's top pick in 1975.
"I represent players who feel
some sense of commitment to
their community," said Stein
berg. Many of Steinberg's
clients set up scholarship
funds at their colleges or high
schools, or make contributions
to their team's hometown.
Rolfe Berniscke, a placekicker
from UC-Davis who has a
strong interest in dolphins,
donates money to the San
Diego Zoo for every field goal
he makes for the Chargers.
The status of King, Benjamin
and Lofton is "a real testimony
to the Stanford program," said
Steinberg. "You're talking
about three players who are
the best at their positions."
Prior to this draft, the Cards'
best was 1972 when Greg
Sampson (Houston) and Jeff
Siemon (Minnesota) went on
the first round and Pete
Lazetich (San Diego) was taken
on the second. All three of
them were members of the
1971 Thunderchicken defense
which led Stanford to its 13-12
Rose Bowl victory over Michi
gan. Sampson became a starter
on the offensive line for Hous

ton.
Other Pacific-8 prospects for
the draft include center Blair
Bush and defensive lineman
Dave Browning from
Washington and defensive
back Kenny Greene, tight end
Eason Ransom, running back
Dan Doornick, receiver Mike
Levenseller and punter Gavin
Hedrick from Washington
State.
Bear possibles
Cal could have as many as six
players taken, including kicker
jim Breech, receiver )esse
Thompson and offensive
tackle Jack Clark.
But no school in the Pac-8
will have as many players taken
as fast as the Cards will. And
based on last year's contracts
awarded to top round picks,
high draft choices this year can
expect contracts worth a mill
ion dollars.
This year should be better
than last year, according to at
torney Steinberg, since there is
"an excellent money situation
because of the addition of
money from the new television
contracts." Each team will be
receiving an added $3 million
as a result of the new television
revenue.
And who'll go where and get
how much will start being de
termined when the draft starts
tomorrow at 10 a.m. in New
York City's Roosevelt Hotel.

in Buffalo, as well as through
out the rest of the NFL."
Lofton said he hasn't con
cerned himself recently with
where he will end up. "I don't
think about it any more," he
said. "I'll probably be going
back East somewhere. It
doesn't look like I'll be playing
for a contender."
Lofton's right, because if the
Bills don'ttake him, Green Bay,
which according to Publicity
Director Lee Remmel, needs
"immediate help on offense,"
will take either Miller or Lofton
with its sixth pick.
Other players who could
give the Packers some help on
offense include running back
Elvis Peacock from Oklahoma,
and receivers Ozzie Newsome
from Alabama and John Jeffer
son from Arizona State.
It seems likely that Lofton
could have a greater impact
immediately by going to the
Packers, since Green Bay plays
in the National Football Con
ference's Central Division, a
division which does not have
as many offensive stars as Buf
falo's division.

This year the Cards stand to have their best pro football draft of all time.
Virtually assured of first-round selection are quarterback Guy Benjamin

don King (above).
taken in the first round.
Cincinnati, where Walsh
coached as an assistant for
eight years, has the eighth
pick, and will use it to take
King, if he's still available, or
offensive lineman Chris Ward
of Ohio State.
After the Bengals comes
Seattle, and though the Sea
hawks are expected to take a
defensive lineman like
Browner or Still, publicist Don
Andersen said they will "take
the best athlete available re
gardless of position. We've got
too many holes at too many
places."
The Giants are the highest
drafting team in the market for
a quarterback and they pick
10th. Benjamin and Pitt's Matt

Cavanaugh are the highest
rated passers, getting the nod
over Grambling's Doug Wil
liams "because they're major
college players," said the
Rams' Steinberg.
Benjamin has the edge on
Cavanaugh because he's
worked under Walsh's pro set
system. "In Guy, you have the
most advanced college quar
terback in the country this
year. He has a keen sense for
going for the jugular vein.
Some guys you put in, and no
thing happens. Put in Guy, and
something always happens,"
said attorney Steinberg, who's
representing Benjamin, King
and Kellar. "Where he'll be
drafted is interesting, I think
he'll go in the first round. Un
ited has him No. 1."

United is one of the two
large pool scouting systems
which supplies information to
their client teams. United and
BLESTQ-V, based in
Pittsburgh, each divide the
country into eight sectors, with
a scout covering the colleges in
his sector. United and
BLESTO-V also have scouts
who go from sector to sector,
along with one national scout,
The scouting pools then
compile a ranking of the
players. "It is used as a guide,
and then the club scouts take
over," said Buffington. "We
furnish information more than
anything. Some clubs use us
more than others. Some draft
the way we rank the players."
Walsh said he expects Ben-
jamin to be drafted in the first
round, but exactly when is un
certain "because you justdon't
have any way to predict. His
success will be dependent on
who drafts him. Hopefully,
he'll be able to develop."
Being drafted by a lowly
team usually means a rookie
quarterback will not be able to
count on the protection from
the offensive line an estab
lished team could provide.
Detroit follows the Giants,
and has expressed interest in a
quarterback, but a Lions'
spokesman said, "There's so
many areas where we need
help, we will just have to wait
and see who's left."
Lake Erie?
If Lofton is still available by
the time Cleveland gets to
make the No. 12 pick, the
Browns will take him. The
Browns are looking for a big
play wide receiver. "Lofton has
the abilities to make him a
great professional," said
Walsh, who said he expects
Lofton to be a first-year starter.
Kellar should be taken in the
middle rounds, according to
Walsh. "I'm hopeful he will be
drafted in the fourth- or fifth
round area, but you can't pre
dict what will happen. He's
capable of playing in the NFL,
and we're hopeful he'll be
picked by the right team."

Buffington said, "Kellar will
definitely be drafted."
"He's a very efficient and ac
complished receiver," said at
torney Steinberg. "The Ed
monton Eskimos (of the
Canadian Football League) are
also bidding on him. Theywant
him to play a slot position."
"I'd like to stay on the West
Coast if I could," said Kellar. "I
think I could fit in best on a
team with an offense like ours,
where they need a receiver to
get open underneath and run a
lot of curls to complement a
deep threat."
Hill, who started at both
center and guard for Stanford,
"somewhere down the line will
be drafted," said Buffington.
"Hill, we expect, we will be
drafted as a center," said
Walsh.
Advantage
"The o-liners (offensive
linemen) out of Stanford have a
good chance to make it," said
attorney Steinberg. "The thing
that helps them is they play the
pro set, and they had pro
coaches teaching them. Gor
don King is just eons advanced
in his skill in pass blocking."
Players represented by
Steinberg generally have a
good chance of getting into the
pros. "About a good 90 per
cent of them make it,"he said.
Steinberg, the student body
president at Cal in 1970,

graduated from Cal's law
school in 1974. As a dorm
counselor, Steinberg met Bear
quarterback Steve Bartkowski,
and then negotiated the then
largest rookie contract for
Bartkowski when he was the
draft's top pick in 1975.
"I represent players who feel
some sense of commitment to
their community," said Stein
berg. Many of Steinberg's
clients set up scholarship
funds at their colleges or high
schools, or make contributions
to their team's hometown.
Rolfe Berniscke, a placekicker
from UC-Davis who has a
strong interest in dolphins,
donates money to the San
Diego Zoo for every field goal
he makes for the Chargers.
The status of King, Benjamin
and Lofton is "a real testimony
to the Stanford program," said
Steinberg. "You're talking
about three players who are
the best at their positions."
Prior to this draft, the Cards'
best was 1972 when Greg
Sampson (Houston) and Jeff
Siemon (Minnesota) went on
the first round and Pete
Lazetich (San Diego) was taken
on the second. All three of
them were members of the
1971 Thunderchicken defense
which led Stanford to its 13-12
Rose Bowl victory over Michi
gan. Sampson became a starter
on the offensive line for Hous

ton.
Other Pacific-8 prospects for
the draft include center Blair
Bush and defensive lineman
Dave Browning from
Washington and defensive
back Kenny Greene, tight end
Eason Ransom, running back
Dan Doornick, receiver Mike
Levenseller and punter Gavin
Hedrick from Washington
State.
Bear possibles
Cal could have as many as six
players taken, including kicker
jim Breech, receiver )esse
Thompson and offensive
tackle Jack Clark.
But no school in the Pac-8
will have as many players taken
as fast as the Cards will. And
based on last year's contracts
awarded to top round picks,
high draft choices this year can
expect contracts worth a mill
ion dollars.
This year should be better
than last year, according to at
torney Steinberg, since there is
"an excellent money situation
because of the addition of
money from the new television
contracts." Each team will be
receiving an added $3 million
as a result of the new television
revenue.
And who'll go where and get
how much will start being de
termined when the draft starts
tomorrow at 10 a.m. in New
York City's Roosevelt Hotel.
Gordon King and Conrad
Dobler on the same offensive
line? Joe Ferguson passing to
James Lofton? Guy Benjamin
handing off to Larry Csonka?
Whether these combina
tions will be possible next sea
son when the National Football
League kicks off its first 16-
game regular season will be
known tomorrow when the
league starts its annual draft of
senior college football players.
And while most scouts and
general managers say the col
lege crop is not as bountiful as
some in recent years, for Stan
ford the 1978 draft will rank as
the greatest ever on the Farm.
Three Cardinals — King, Lof
ton and Benjamin — are
guaranteed top choices, and all
could well be gone by the end
of the first round. Two addi
tional players from last year's
offense — wide receiver Bill
Kellar and guard Mark Hill —
are also expected to be drafted
somewhere in the middle of
the two-day, 12-round affair.
"Our opinion is it's a good
year," said Harry Buffington,
president of United Scouting,
an organization which supplies
preliminary information on all
the college seniors and ranks
them according to position for
16 of the NFL teams. "It may
not be as deep, but the eche
lon is good, and in that respect,
it might be better than some of
the recent drafts. When you
get down to the 11th and 12th
rounds, though, it might be
sort of thin."

Dick Steinberg, the director
of scouting for the Los Angeles
Rams, agreed. "This year's
draft is probably not as deep,"
he said, "but there's always
quality at the top. There's just
not the quantity this year."
Buffington's assessment that
the quality at the top is possibly
the best in recent years i$
borne out by the top three
Stanford prospects. "Gordon
King is as good as any lineman
drafted in recent years," said
Leigh Steinberg, Los Angeles
based attorney who has been
representing athletes for four
years. "He is the top-rated of
fensive tackle in the country.
He is far and away the most
proficient pass blocker in the
country, has incredible size
and sheer tenacity. Clubs are
just drooling waiting to get
their hands on him."
Stanford head coach Bill
Walsh concurred. "He's the
premier lineman in the coun
try as I see it. I expect him to be
starting next year at left tackle
— which is the most important
position in the offensive line
on pass blocking because the
quarterback has his back to
that side."
Houston, which traded with
Tampa Bay last week to obtain
the Buccaneers'and the draft's
No. 1 pick, has announced it
will select Heisman Trophy
winner Earl Campbell of Texas.
The second choice belongs to
Kansas City and the Chiefs are
expected to select a defensive
lineman — possibly Ross
Browner of Notre Dame or

mammoth Art Still from Ken
tucky.
New Orleans, which ac
quired Dobler during the
offseason in a trade with New
Orleans, will probably draft the
6-foot-2, 272 lb. King or re
ceiver Wes Chandler of Florida
with the third pick of the draft.
"Wes Chandler is the top
rated offensive receiver," said
attorney Steinberg. "Some
people consider Chandler to
be the best receiver to come
out of college in a few years.
And after Chandler will go Lof
ton."
Kick returner
Chandler's kick-returning
experience is apparently the
reason he is considered
slightly better than the 6-3,187
lb. Lofton, though the Card's
track accomplishments qualify
him as a better athlete, a factor
most teams usually consider in
making a choice.
New Orleans, which has
been near the bottom of the
NFL throughout its existence,
could probably use King more
than the 6-0, 190 lb. Chandler.
King said he would like to go to
a team that is already a winner,
or a team that is building. "Any
team that is drafting me is seri
ous about building," he ad
ded.
The New York )ets have the
fourth pick, and are apparently
going to take running back
Terry Miller of Oklahoma State
or possibly King if the Saints
don't grab him.
Buffalo drafts fifth, and the
Bills are going to take either

Chandler or Lofton. "We're
going to take the best athlete,"
said a Bills' spokesman. "James
Lofton is of great interest to us
in Buffalo, as well as through
out the rest of the NFL."
Lofton said he hasn't con
cerned himself recently with
where he will end up. "I don't
think about it any more," he
said. "I'll probably be going
back East somewhere. It
doesn't look like I'll be playing

Lofton's right, because if the
Bills don'ttake him, Green Bay,
which according to Publicity
Director Lee Remmel, needs
"immediate help on offense,"
will take either Miller or Lofton
with its sixth pick.
Other players who could

play wide receiver. "Lofton has
the abilities to make him a
great professional," said
Walsh, who said he expects
Lofton to be a first-year starter.
Kellar should be taken in the
middle rounds, according to
Walsh. "I'm hopeful he will be
drafted in the fourth- or fifth
round area, but you can't pre
dict what will happen. He's
capable of playing in the NFL,
and we're hopeful he'll be
picked by the right team."

Buffington said, "Kellar will
definitely be drafted."
"He's a very efficient and ac
complished receiver," said at
torney Steinberg. "The Ed
monton Eskimos (of the
Canadian Football League) are
also bidding on him. Theywant
him to play a slot position."
"I'd like to stay on the West
Coast if I could," said Kellar. "I
think I could fit in best on a
team with an offense like ours,
where they need a receiver to
get open underneath and run a
lot of curls to complement a
deep threat."
Hill, who started at both
center and guard for Stanford,
"somewhere down the line will
be drafted," said Buffington.
"Hill, we expect, we will be
drafted as a center," said
Walsh.
Advantage
"The o-liners (offensive
linemen) out of Stanford have a
good chance to make it," said
attorney Steinberg. "The thing
that helps them is they play the
pro set, and they had pro
coaches teaching them. Gor
don King is just eons advanced
in his skill in pass blocking."
Players represented by
Steinberg generally have a
good chance of getting into the
pros. "About a good 90 per
cent of them make it,"he said.
Steinberg, the student body
president at Cal in 1970,

graduated from Cal's law
school in 1974. As a dorm
counselor, Steinberg met Bear
quarterback Steve Bartkowski,
and then negotiated the then
largest rookie contract for
Bartkowski when he was the
draft's top pick in 1975.
"I represent players who feel
some sense of commitment to
their community," said Stein
berg. Many of Steinberg's
clients set up scholarship
funds at their colleges or high
schools, or make contributions
to their team's hometown.
Rolfe Berniscke, a placekicker
from UC-Davis who has a
strong interest in dolphins,
donates money to the San
Diego Zoo for every field goal
he makes for the Chargers.
The status of King, Benjamin
and Lofton is "a real testimony
to the Stanford program," said
Steinberg. "You're talking
about three players who are
the best at their positions."
Prior to this draft, the Cards'
best was 1972 when Greg
Sampson (Houston) and Jeff
Siemon (Minnesota) went on
the first round and Pete
Lazetich (San Diego) was taken
on the second. All three of
them were members of the
1971 Thunderchicken defense
which led Stanford to its 13-12
Rose Bowl victory over Michi
gan. Sampson became a starter
on the offensive line for Hous

ton.
Other Pacific-8 prospects for
the draft include center Blair
Bush and defensive lineman
Dave Browning from
Washington and defensive
back Kenny Greene, tight end
Eason Ransom, running back
Dan Doornick, receiver Mike
Levenseller and punter Gavin
Hedrick from Washington
State.
Bear possibles
Cal could have as many as six
players taken, including kicker
jim Breech, receiver )esse
Thompson and offensive
tackle Jack Clark.
But no school in the Pac-8
will have as many players taken
as fast as the Cards will. And
based on last year's contracts
awarded to top round picks,
high draft choices this year can
expect contracts worth a mill
ion dollars.
This year should be better
than last year, according to at
torney Steinberg, since there is
"an excellent money situation
because of the addition of
money from the new television
contracts." Each team will be
receiving an added $3 million
as a result of the new television
revenue.
And who'll go where and get
how much will start being de
termined when the draft starts
tomorrow at 10 a.m. in New
York City's Roosevelt Hotel.
Gordon King and Conrad
Dobler on the same offensive
line? Joe Ferguson passing to
James Lofton? Guy Benjamin
handing off to Larry Csonka?
Whether these combina
tions will be possible next sea
son when the National Football
League kicks off its first 16-
game regular season will be
known tomorrow when the
league starts its annual draft of
senior college football players.
And while most scouts and
general managers say the col
lege crop is not as bountiful as
some in recent years, for Stan
ford the 1978 draft will rank as
the greatest ever on the Farm.
Three Cardinals — King, Lof
ton and Benjamin — are
guaranteed top choices, and all
could well be gone by the end
of the first round. Two addi
tional players from last year's
offense — wide receiver Bill
Kellar and guard Mark Hill —
are also expected to be drafted
somewhere in the middle of
the two-day, 12-round affair.
"Our opinion is it's a good
year," said Harry Buffington,
president of United Scouting,
an organization which supplies
preliminary information on all
the college seniors and ranks
them according to position for
16 of the NFL teams. "It may
not be as deep, but the eche
lon is good, and in that respect,
it might be better than some of
the recent drafts. When you
get down to the 11th and 12th
rounds, though, it might be
sort of thin."

Dick Steinberg, the director
of scouting for the Los Angeles
Rams, agreed. "This year's
draft is probably not as deep,"
he said, "but there's always
quality at the top. There's just
not the quantity this year."
Buffington's assessment that
the quality at the top is possibly
the best in recent years i$
borne out by the top three
Stanford prospects. "Gordon
King is as good as any lineman
drafted in recent years," said
Leigh Steinberg, Los Angeles
based attorney who has been
representing athletes for four
years. "He is the top-rated of
fensive tackle in the country.
He is far and away the most
proficient pass blocker in the
country, has incredible size
and sheer tenacity. Clubs are
just drooling waiting to get
their hands on him."
Stanford head coach Bill
Walsh concurred. "He's the
premier lineman in the coun
try as I see it. I expect him to be
starting next year at left tackle
— which is the most important
position in the offensive line
on pass blocking because the
quarterback has his back to
that side."
Houston, which traded with
Tampa Bay last week to obtain
the Buccaneers'and the draft's
No. 1 pick, has announced it
will select Heisman Trophy
winner Earl Campbell of Texas.
The second choice belongs to
Kansas City and the Chiefs are
expected to select a defensive
lineman — possibly Ross
Browner of Notre Dame or

mammoth Art Still from Ken
tucky.
New Orleans, which ac
quired Dobler during the
offseason in a trade with New
Orleans, will probably draft the
6-foot-2, 272 lb. King or re
ceiver Wes Chandler of Florida
with the third pick of the draft.
"Wes Chandler is the top
rated offensive receiver," said
attorney Steinberg. "Some
people consider Chandler to
be the best receiver to come
out of college in a few years.
And after Chandler will go Lof
ton."
Kick returner
Chandler's kick-returning
experience is apparently the
reason he is considered
slightly better than the 6-3,187
lb. Lofton, though the Card's
track accomplishments qualify
him as a better athlete, a factor
most teams usually consider in
making a choice.
New Orleans, which has
been near the bottom of the
NFL throughout its existence,
could probably use King more
than the 6-0, 190 lb. Chandler.
King said he would like to go to
a team that is already a winner,
or a team that is building. "Any
team that is drafting me is seri
ous about building," he ad
ded.
The New York )ets have the
fourth pick, and are apparently
going to take running back
Terry Miller of Oklahoma State
or possibly King if the Saints
don't grab him.
Buffalo drafts fifth, and the
Bills are going to take either

Chandler or Lofton. "We're
going to take the best athlete,"
said a Bills' spokesman. "James
Lofton is of great interest to us
in Buffalo, as well as through
out the rest of the NFL."
Lofton said he hasn't con
cerned himself recently with
where he will end up. "I don't
think about it any more," he
said. "I'll probably be going
back East somewhere. It
doesn't look like I'll be playing
for a contender."
Lofton's right, because if the
Bills don'ttake him, Green Bay,
which according to Publicity
Director Lee Remmel, needs
"immediate help on offense,"
will take either Miller or Lofton
with its sixth pick.
Other players who could
give the Packers some help on
offense include running back
Elvis Peacock from Oklahoma,
and receivers Ozzie Newsome
from Alabama and John Jeffer
son from Arizona State.
It seems likely that Lofton
could have a greater impact
immediately by going to the
Packers, since Green Bay plays
in the National Football Con
ference's Central Division, a
division which does not have
as many offensive stars as Buf
falo's division.
The 49ers choose seventh,
and are expected to take Notre
Dame's 6-6, 240 lb. tight end
Ken McAfee. The carbon copy

don King (above).
taken in the first round.
Cincinnati, where Walsh
coached as an assistant for
eight years, has the eighth
pick, and will use it to take
King, if he's still available, or
offensive lineman Chris Ward
of Ohio State.
After the Bengals comes
Seattle, and though the Sea
hawks are expected to take a
defensive lineman like
Browner or Still, publicist Don
Andersen said they will "take
the best athlete available re
gardless of position. We've got
too many holes at too many
places."
The Giants are the highest
drafting team in the market for
a quarterback and they pick
10th. Benjamin and Pitt's Matt

Cavanaugh are the highest
rated passers, getting the nod
over Grambling's Doug Wil
liams "because they're major
college players," said the
Rams' Steinberg.
Benjamin has the edge on
Cavanaugh because he's
worked under Walsh's pro set
system. "In Guy, you have the
most advanced college quar
terback in the country this
year. He has a keen sense for
going for the jugular vein.
Some guys you put in, and no
thing happens. Put in Guy, and
something always happens,"
said attorney Steinberg, who's
representing Benjamin, King
and Kellar. "Where he'll be
drafted is interesting, I think
he'll go in the first round. Un
ited has him No. 1."

United is one of the two
large pool scouting systems
which supplies information to
their client teams. United and
BLESTQ-V, based in
Pittsburgh, each divide the
country into eight sectors, with
a scout covering the colleges in
his sector. United and
BLESTO-V also have scouts
who go from sector to sector,
along with one national scout,
The scouting pools then
compile a ranking of the
players. "It is used as a guide,
and then the club scouts take
over," said Buffington. "We
furnish information more than
anything. Some clubs use us
more than others. Some draft
the way we rank the players."
Walsh said he expects Ben-
jamin to be drafted in the first
round, but exactly when is un
certain "because you justdon't
have any way to predict. His
success will be dependent on
who drafts him. Hopefully,
he'll be able to develop."
Being drafted by a lowly
team usually means a rookie
quarterback will not be able to
count on the protection from
the offensive line an estab
lished team could provide.
Detroit follows the Giants,
and has expressed interest in a
quarterback, but a Lions'
spokesman said, "There's so
many areas where we need
help, we will just have to wait
and see who's left."
Lake Erie?
If Lofton is still available by
the time Cleveland gets to
make the No. 12 pick, the
Browns will take him. The
Browns are looking for a big
play wide receiver. "Lofton has
the abilities to make him a
great professional," said
Walsh, who said he expects
Lofton to be a first-year starter.
Kellar should be taken in the

tions will be possible next sea
son when the National Football
League kicks off its first 16-
game regular season will be
known tomorrow when the
league starts its annual draft of
senior college football players.
And while most scouts and
general managers say the col
lege crop is not as bountiful as
some in recent years, for Stan
ford the 1978 draft will rank as
the greatest ever on the Farm.
Three Cardinals — King, Lof
ton and Benjamin — are
guaranteed top choices, and all
could well be gone by the end
of the first round. Two addi
tional players from last year's
offense — wide receiver Bill
Kellar and guard Mark Hill —
are also expected to be drafted
somewhere in the middle of
the two-day, 12-round affair.
"Our opinion is it's a good
year," said Harry Buffington,
president of United Scouting,
an organization which supplies
preliminary information on all
the college seniors and ranks
them according to position for
16 of the NFL teams. "It may
not be as deep, but the eche
lon is good, and in that respect,
it might be better than some of
the recent drafts. When you
get down to the 11th and 12th
rounds, though, it might be
sort of thin."

Dick Steinberg, the director
of scouting for the Los Angeles
Rams, agreed. "This year's
draft is probably not as deep,"
he said, "but there's always
quality at the top. There's just
not the quantity this year."
Buffington's assessment that
the quality at the top is possibly
the best in recent years i$
borne out by the top three
Stanford prospects. "Gordon
King is as good as any lineman
drafted in recent years," said
Leigh Steinberg, Los Angeles
based attorney who has been
representing athletes for four
years. "He is the top-rated of
fensive tackle in the country.
He is far and away the most
proficient pass blocker in the
country, has incredible size
and sheer tenacity. Clubs are
just drooling waiting to get
their hands on him."
Stanford head coach Bill
Walsh concurred. "He's the
premier lineman in the coun
try as I see it. I expect him to be
starting next year at left tackle
— which is the most important
position in the offensive line
on pass blocking because the
quarterback has his back to
that side."
Houston, which traded with
Tampa Bay last week to obtain
the Buccaneers'and the draft's
No. 1 pick, has announced it
will select Heisman Trophy
winner Earl Campbell of Texas.
The second choice belongs to
Kansas City and the Chiefs are
expected to select a defensive
lineman — possibly Ross
Browner of Notre Dame or

mammoth Art Still from Ken
tucky.
New Orleans, which ac
quired Dobler during the
offseason in a trade with New
Orleans, will probably draft the
6-foot-2, 272 lb. King or re
ceiver Wes Chandler of Florida
with the third pick of the draft.
"Wes Chandler is the top
rated offensive receiver," said
attorney Steinberg. "Some
people consider Chandler to
be the best receiver to come
out of college in a few years.
And after Chandler will go Lof
ton."
Kick returner
Chandler's kick-returning
experience is apparently the
reason he is considered
slightly better than the 6-3,187
lb. Lofton, though the Card's
track accomplishments qualify
him as a better athlete, a factor
most teams usually consider in
making a choice.
New Orleans, which has
been near the bottom of the
NFL throughout its existence,
could probably use King more
than the 6-0, 190 lb. Chandler.
King said he would like to go to
a team that is already a winner,
or a team that is building. "Any
team that is drafting me is seri
ous about building," he ad
ded.
The New York )ets have the
fourth pick, and are apparently
going to take running back
Terry Miller of Oklahoma State
or possibly King if the Saints
don't grab him.
Buffalo drafts fifth, and the
Bills are going to take either

Chandler or Lofton. "We're
going to take the best athlete,"
said a Bills' spokesman. "James
Lofton is of great interest to us
in Buffalo, as well as through
out the rest of the NFL."
Lofton said he hasn't con
cerned himself recently with
where he will end up. "I don't
think about it any more," he
said. "I'll probably be going
back East somewhere. It
doesn't look like I'll be playing
for a contender."
Lofton's right, because if the
Bills don'ttake him, Green Bay,
which according to Publicity
Director Lee Remmel, needs
"immediate help on offense,"
will take either Miller or Lofton
with its sixth pick.
Other players who could
give the Packers some help on
offense include running back
Elvis Peacock from Oklahoma,
and receivers Ozzie Newsome
from Alabama and John Jeffer
son from Arizona State.
It seems likely that Lofton
could have a greater impact
immediately by going to the
Packers, since Green Bay plays
in the National Football Con
ference's Central Division, a
division which does not have
as many offensive stars as Buf
falo's division.
The 49ers choose seventh,
and are expected to take Notre
Dame's 6-6, 240 lb. tight end
Ken McAfee. The carbon copy
of the Raiders' Dave Casper,
also an Irish alumnus, he is the
second of the three Notre
Dame players expected to be

This year the Cards stand to have their best pro football draft of all time.
Virtually assured of first-round selection are quarterback Guy Benjamin
(above left), receiver James Lofton (above right) and offensive tackle Gor
don King (above).
taken in the first round.
Cincinnati, where Walsh
coached as an assistant for
eight years, has the eighth
pick, and will use it to take
King, if he's still available, or
offensive lineman Chris Ward
of Ohio State.
After the Bengals comes
Seattle, and though the Sea
hawks are expected to take a
defensive lineman like
Browner or Still, publicist Don
Andersen said they will "take
the best athlete available re
gardless of position. We've got
too many holes at too many
places."
The Giants are the highest
drafting team in the market for
a quarterback and they pick
10th. Benjamin and Pitt's Matt

Cavanaugh are the highest
rated passers, getting the nod
over Grambling's Doug Wil
liams "because they're major
college players," said the
Rams' Steinberg.
Benjamin has the edge on
Cavanaugh because he's
worked under Walsh's pro set
system. "In Guy, you have the
most advanced college quar
terback in the country this
year. He has a keen sense for
going for the jugular vein.
Some guys you put in, and no
thing happens. Put in Guy, and
something always happens,"
said attorney Steinberg, who's
representing Benjamin, King
and Kellar. "Where he'll be
drafted is interesting, I think
he'll go in the first round. Un
ited has him No. 1."

United is one of the two
large pool scouting systems
which supplies information to
their client teams. United and
BLESTQ-V, based in
Pittsburgh, each divide the
country into eight sectors, with
a scout covering the colleges in
his sector. United and
BLESTO-V also have scouts
who go from sector to sector,
along with one national scout,
The scouting pools then
compile a ranking of the
players. "It is used as a guide,
and then the club scouts take
over," said Buffington. "We
furnish information more than
anything. Some clubs use us
more than others. Some draft
the way we rank the players."
Walsh said he expects Ben-
jamin to be drafted in the first
round, but exactly when is un
certain "because you justdon't
have any way to predict. His
success will be dependent on
who drafts him. Hopefully,
he'll be able to develop."
Being drafted by a lowly
team usually means a rookie
quarterback will not be able to
count on the protection from
the offensive line an estab
lished team could provide.
Detroit follows the Giants,
and has expressed interest in a
quarterback, but a Lions'
spokesman said, "There's so
many areas where we need
help, we will just have to wait
and see who's left."
Lake Erie?
If Lofton is still available by
the time Cleveland gets to
make the No. 12 pick, the
Browns will take him. The
Browns are looking for a big
play wide receiver. "Lofton has
the abilities to make him a
great professional," said
Walsh, who said he expects
Lofton to be a first-year starter.
Kellar should be taken in the
middle rounds, according to
Walsh. "I'm hopeful he will be
drafted in the fourth- or fifth
round area, but you can't pre
dict what will happen. He's
capable of playing in the NFL,
and we're hopeful he'll be
picked by the right team."

Buffington said, "Kellar will
definitely be drafted."
"He's a very efficient and ac
complished receiver," said at
torney Steinberg. "The Ed
monton Eskimos (of the
Canadian Football League) are
also bidding on him. Theywant
him to play a slot position."
"I'd like to stay on the West
Coast if I could," said Kellar. "I
think I could fit in best on a
team with an offense like ours,
where they need a receiver to
get open underneath and run a
lot of curls to complement a
deep threat."
Hill, who started at both
center and guard for Stanford,
"somewhere down the line will
be drafted," said Buffington.
"Hill, we expect, we will be
drafted as a center," said
Walsh.
Advantage
"The o-liners (offensive
linemen) out of Stanford have a
good chance to make it," said
attorney Steinberg. "The thing
that helps them is they play the
pro set, and they had pro
coaches teaching them. Gor
don King is just eons advanced
in his skill in pass blocking."
Players represented by
Steinberg generally have a
good chance of getting into the
pros. "About a good 90 per
cent of them make it,"he said.
Steinberg, the student body
president at Cal in 1970,

graduated from Cal's law
school in 1974. As a dorm
counselor, Steinberg met Bear
quarterback Steve Bartkowski,
and then negotiated the then
largest rookie contract for
Bartkowski when he was the
draft's top pick in 1975.
"I represent players who feel
some sense of commitment to
their community," said Stein
berg. Many of Steinberg's
clients set up scholarship
funds at their colleges or high
schools, or make contributions
to their team's hometown.
Rolfe Berniscke, a placekicker
from UC-Davis who has a
strong interest in dolphins,
donates money to the San
Diego Zoo for every field goal
he makes for the Chargers.
The status of King, Benjamin
and Lofton is "a real testimony
to the Stanford program," said
Steinberg. "You're talking
about three players who are
the best at their positions."
Prior to this draft, the Cards'
best was 1972 when Greg
Sampson (Houston) and Jeff
Siemon (Minnesota) went on
the first round and Pete
Lazetich (San Diego) was taken
on the second. All three of
them were members of the
1971 Thunderchicken defense
which led Stanford to its 13-12
Rose Bowl victory over Michi
gan. Sampson became a starter
on the offensive line for Hous

ton.
Other Pacific-8 prospects for
the draft include center Blair
Bush and defensive lineman
Dave Browning from
Washington and defensive
back Kenny Greene, tight end
Eason Ransom, running back
Dan Doornick, receiver Mike
Levenseller and punter Gavin
Hedrick from Washington
State.
Bear possibles
Cal could have as many as six
players taken, including kicker
jim Breech, receiver )esse
Thompson and offensive
tackle Jack Clark.
But no school in the Pac-8
will have as many players taken
as fast as the Cards will. And
based on last year's contracts
awarded to top round picks,
high draft choices this year can
expect contracts worth a mill
ion dollars.
This year should be better
than last year, according to at
torney Steinberg, since there is
"an excellent money situation
because of the addition of
money from the new television
contracts." Each team will be
receiving an added $3 million
as a result of the new television
revenue.
And who'll go where and get
how much will start being de
termined when the draft starts
tomorrow at 10 a.m. in New
York City's Roosevelt Hotel.
