# NFL Draft: First round for Guy, James, Gordon?
## 
### David Georgette 
Gordon King and Conrad
Dobler on the same offensive
line? Joe Ferguson passing to
James Lofton? Guy Benjamin
handing off to Larry Csonka?
Whether these combina
tions will be possible next sea
son when the National Football
League kicks off its first 16-
game regular season will be
known tomorrow when the
league starts its annual draft of
senior college football players.
And while most scouts and
general managers say the col
lege crop is not as bountiful as
some in recent years, for Stan
ford the 1978 draft will rank as
the greatest ever on the Farm.
Three Cardinals — King, Lof
ton and Benjamin — are
guaranteed top choices, and all
could well be gone by the end
of the first round. Two addi
tional players from last year's
offense — wide receiver Bill
Kellar and guard Mark Hill —
are also expected to be drafted
somewhere in the middle of
the two-day, 12-round affair.
"Our opinion is it's a good
year," said Harry Buffington,
president of United Scouting,
an organization which supplies
preliminary information on all
the college seniors and ranks
them according to position for
16 of the NFL teams. "It may
not be as deep, but the eche
lon is good, and in that respect,
it might be better than some of
the recent drafts. When you
get down to the 11th and 12th
rounds, though, it might be
sort of thin."

Dick Steinberg, the director
of scouting for the Los Angeles
Rams, agreed. "This year's
draft is probably not as deep,"
he said, "but there's always
quality at the top. There's just
not the quantity this year."
Buffington's assessment that
the quality at the top is possibly
the best in recent years i$
borne out by the top three
Stanford prospects. "Gordon
King is as good as any lineman
drafted in recent years," said
Leigh Steinberg, Los Angeles
based attorney who has been
representing athletes for four
years. "He is the top-rated of
fensive tackle in the country.
He is far and away the most
proficient pass blocker in the
country, has incredible size
and sheer tenacity. Clubs are
just drooling waiting to get
their hands on him."
Stanford head coach Bill
Walsh concurred. "He's the
premier lineman in the coun
try as I see it. I expect him to be
starting next year at left tackle
— which is the most important
position in the offensive line
on pass blocking because the
quarterback has his back to
that side."
Houston, which traded with
Tampa Bay last week to obtain
the Buccaneers'and the draft's
No. 1 pick, has announced it
will select Heisman Trophy
winner Earl Campbell of Texas.
The second choice belongs to
Kansas City and the Chiefs are
expected to select a defensive
lineman — possibly Ross
Browner of Notre Dame or

mammoth Art Still from Ken
tucky.
New Orleans, which ac
quired Dobler during the
offseason in a trade with New
Orleans, will probably draft the
6-foot-2, 272 lb. King or re
ceiver Wes Chandler of Florida
with the third pick of the draft.
"Wes Chandler is the top
rated offensive receiver," said
attorney Steinberg. "Some
people consider Chandler to
be the best receiver to come
out of college in a few years.
And after Chandler will go Lof
ton."
Kick returner
Chandler's kick-returning
experience is apparently the
reason he is considered
slightly better than the 6-3,187
lb. Lofton, though the Card's
track accomplishments qualify
him as a better athlete, a factor
most teams usually consider in
making a choice.
New Orleans, which has
been near the bottom of the
NFL throughout its existence,
could probably use King more
than the 6-0, 190 lb. Chandler.
King said he would like to go to
a team that is already a winner,
or a team that is building. "Any
team that is drafting me is seri
ous about building," he ad
ded.
The New York )ets have the
fourth pick, and are apparently
going to take running back
Terry Miller of Oklahoma State
or possibly King if the Saints
don't grab him.
Buffalo drafts fifth, and the
Bills are going to take either

Chandler or Lofton. "We're
going to take the best athlete,"
said a Bills' spokesman. "James
Lofton is of great interest to us
in Buffalo, as well as through
out the rest of the NFL."
Lofton said he hasn't con
cerned himself recently with
where he will end up. "I don't
think about it any more," he
said. "I'll probably be going
back East somewhere. It
doesn't look like I'll be playing
for a contender."
Lofton's right, because if the
Bills don'ttake him, Green Bay,
which according to Publicity
Director Lee Remmel, needs
"immediate help on offense,"
will take either Miller or Lofton
with its sixth pick.
Other players who could
give the Packers some help on
offense include running back
Elvis Peacock from Oklahoma,
and receivers Ozzie Newsome
from Alabama and John Jeffer
son from Arizona State.
It seems likely that Lofton
could have a greater impact
immediately by going to the
Packers, since Green Bay plays
in the National Football Con
ference's Central Division, a
division which does not have
as many offensive stars as Buf
falo's division.
The 49ers choose seventh,
and are expected to take Notre
Dame's 6-6, 240 lb. tight end
Ken McAfee. The carbon copy

also an Irish alumnus, he is the
second of the three Notre
Dame players expected to be
