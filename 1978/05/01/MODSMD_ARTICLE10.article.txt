SOC indoctrinates
We would like to commend the
Stanford Organizing Committee
slate for publicly stating their politi
cal views. Previously we could not
understand the reasoning behind
their actions in the ASSU Senate.
However, we feel that in the quest to
attain their goals they are misleading
the Stanford Community.
In sponsoring one-sided political
activities such as Disorientation
Week they claim to be trying to
"educate" the "Stanford Commun
ity." The problem is that "educating"
is not what they are doing. In pre
senting their views in such a biased,
partisan manner, they are attempting
to indoctrinate the students with
their political ideals.
Instead of an objective presenta
tion of the pros and cons of different
political ideologies so that we stu
dents may decide for ourselves, they
have taken it upon themselves to de
cide what is right for all of us. In es
sence, they are attempting to indoc
trinate us with their ideals and call it
"education."
Their ultimate offense is to decry
this University as a bastion of elitism
while dominating the very
"bourgeois democratic system" rep
resented by the ASSU Senate
The SOC senators have
exemplified elitism through their
unabashed attempts to allocate the
entire Discretionary Fund to their
cause.
Their manner of "politically
educating the community," in fact,
alienates it. Therefore their methods
cannot succeed.
If the SOC truly wishes to interest
the "elitists" in alternative methods
of thinking, they must approach
them as fellow participants in politi
cal forums. Instead, they have
treated others here as mere pupils,
to be indoctrinated by their masters.

SCRIP claims errant
In a flyer posted around the cam
pus on Wednesday, April 26, The
Stanford Committee for a Responsi
ble Investment Policy (SCRIP) made
some assertions that deserve com
ment.
SCRIP claimed that the trustees had

ignored the wishes of "3,600 people
(including 238 faculty) who signed
petitions calling for withdrawal." All
well and good. But this University
has over 10,000 people in it, so it
seems to me that the trustees were
justified in concluding that some 65
per cent of the people on campus
were not particularly concerned with
the issue.
Next we find the statement that
"61 per cent of the students who
voted supported the withdrawal re
ferendum." The key phrase here is
"who voted," because as I recall the
voting was very light indeed.
When you add to the 39 per cent of
students who voted against a with
drawal the large numbers who didn't
care enough to vote at all, you see
howthe trustees might concludethat
to the great majority of people on
campus this was a classic "nonis
sue."
The SCRIP manifesto ends with
this stirring call to arms: "We must
demonstrate that we will not allow
the trustees to ignore the sentiment
of the Stanford community. We must
act now."
Incredibly, having failed twice to
gain majority support — once
through a referendum, once through
an election — SCRIP still believes
that it can arrogate to itself the right
to determine the "sentiment of the
Stanford community" and to act ac
cordingly.
This is arrogant and antidemocra
tic, and that it is done in a "good
cause" does not make it defensible.
In a democracy, the intensity of feel
ing you bring to an issue does not
give you the right to have your vote
count for more than other people's.

Apartheid 'supported'
The Board of Trustees, by their re
cent vote on the CIR recommenda
tions, apparently believes that poli
tics and economics can be separated
in South Africa, that it is possible to
decide, in a given instance, whether
a corporation is exercising a good or
bad influence on the culture of apar
theid.
The argument is reminiscent of
Milton Friedman's on Chile — that it
is possible to deplore the repres
sions of an authoritarian political re
gime (as the trustees claim to deplore
apartheid), yet at the same time, and
without contradiction to actively
back the economic forces support
ing that regime.
„ Friedman's arguement was bril
liantly answered by Orlando La
Letelier (Chilean ambassador to the
United States under President Al
lende) only a few weeks before
Letelier was murdered in September
1976 on the streets of Washington.
"Common sense tells us," argued
Letelier, "that economic policies are
conditioned by and at the same time
modify the social and political situa
tion where they are put into prac
tice." It is naive to suppose that poli
tics and economics in South Africa
can be separated, as the trustees are
trying to do.
If the "private sector" is allowed to
exist by that authoritarian regime,
then that "private sector" is in some
way serving the ends of that regime.
Indeed, given the realities of South
African politics, it could hardly be
any other way.
I sincerely hope that, as the trus
tees do their homework on South Af
rica, and reevaluate this decision,
they will all read Donald Woods' im
portant book, "Biko." Steve Bikowas
a black martyr to the South Africa
police state as Donald Woods is a
white exile from that same state;
not long ago they both held views

similar to those of the trustees —
that corporations could serve
progressive ends and that reform
could be achieved without "an
economic upheaval."
Woods believes so no longer; and,
before he died in prison at the hands
of the South African Security Police
in September 1977, Biko had this to
say:
"The argument is often made that
loss of foreign investment would
hurt blacks the most. It would un
doubtedly hurt blacks in the short
run, because many of them would
stand to lose their jobs, but it should
be understood in Europe and North
America that foreign investment
supports the present economic sys
tem of political injustice. We blacks
are therefore not interested in
foreign investment."
For the trustees to write letters to
corporation presidents saying that
"Stanford is strongly opposed to
apartheid, and we believe that U.S.
corporations can and should exert a
positive force in the direction of ob
taining meaningful steps toward the
achievement of full political, legal,
and social rights for everyone"
(Campus Report, April 26,1978), is to
do precisely nothing about apar
theid.
Pious letters like that, unbacked by
any positive action, are tantamount
to a confession of indifference. (They
are certainly — with that ''positive
force in the direction of obtaining
meaningful steps" — a confession of
indifference to the graces of the En
glish language!)
The U.S. corporations in South Af
rica are a part of the system of apar
theid; their very existence in that sys
tem is evidence of their bad be
havior, for they exist on condition
that they not attack the system in
which they thrive. Not to be actively
against apartheid is to be tacitly for it.
That is the shameful position the vote
of the trustees puts Stanford in.

Motives doubted
To the trustees of Stanford Uni
versity:
We strongly oppose your recent
vote against the proxy resolution cal
ling for withdrawal of Texaco's in
vestments in South Africa.
This action has forced us to doubt
your motives in establishing the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility. The CIR has intensively
studied the situation in South Africa,
and as a result of their deeper under
standing unanimously voted in favor
of the proxy resolution. In light of
your more limited knowledge on this
issue, how can you justify your disre
gard for their unanimous recom
mendation?
U.S. Corporations' presence in
South Africa supports the economy
and thereby the government itself.
As a force for social change in the
past, these corporations have had a
dismal record. Even if corporations
were to act more responsibly, the
most they could do would be to in
crease wages and desegregate toilets
— instances of "petty" apartheid.
There is no way this would lead to
changes in the basic system of apar
theid — that policy which denies
blacks any representation in the gov
ernment, relegates them to scatted
unliveable patches of land (13 per
cent of the land for 81 per cent of the
population!), and forces families to
live apart.
In the past we have not supported
divestment because we felt Stanford
could be more effective working for
change from within. The position is
dependent upon Stanford's invest

merits being used in a morally re
sponsible way. Since it is apparent
that this is not happening consis
tently, we are forced to consider
changing our position.
We urge you to be more respon
sive to the CIR in the future, espe
cially in the forthcoming proxy votes
on Phelps-Dodge and Standard Oil.

Reiterating facts
The recent national attention given
to the Nazi Holocaust requires that
certain facts be reiterated.
The crimes of Nazism were not an
isolated occurrence in this century.
The Stalinist liquidation of the
kulaks, the Maoist elimination of the
landlord class, the atrocities in
Amin's Uganda, and the contempor
ary mass murders in Communist
Cambodia rank alongside Hitler's
Final Solution.
National Socialism is but one var
iant of the predominant political
philosophy of the twentieth century:
the philosophy that holds that indi
viduals exist to serve the good of soc
iety or the purpose of society's rep
resentative the state, a philosophy
that denies the concept of inaliena
ble human rights and conceives of
rights only as privileges granted by
the state.
Of course, both liberals and con
servatives in contemporary America
give obeisance to the idea of human
rights. But if the freedom of the indi
vidual conflicts with the conserva
tives' concern for traditional moral
ity, national security and defense, or
law and order or with the liberals'
demands for welfare, equality, and
economic control and planning,
their lip-service to individual rights is
easily forgotten. The premises com
mon to both left and right have been
transcended only by the small band
of libertarians.
The crimes of Nazism were made
possible by the mythology of the
state. The mystic concepts of the rule
of law or the will of the people or the
authority of government cause men
to perform or sanction actions which
they would never condone if per
formed by persons acting as private
individuals. Such mystification is not
restricted to those relative few who
executed Hitler's will; it pervades the
attitude of normal people towards
government.
If a private individual attempts to
forcibly compel other people to sur
render to him a certain fraction of
their income, he would be univer
sally denounced as a robber or extor
tionist. But if his demands are
cloaked in the sanctity of govern
ment and blessed wi{h the holy let
ters "IRS," he is described by the
euphemism of "tax collector."
This willingness to judge those acts
performed in the name of govern
ment by different standards than
those applied to non-governmental
acts explains how normally decent
people were able to be a part of Na
tional Socialism.
The horrors and atrocities charac
teristic of the twentieth century will
continue as long as men continue to
believe the ideas and support the in
stitutions which make those horrors
possible. They can be ended only by
stripping the institution of govern
ment of its veil of morality and au
thority. The goal of those who care
about humanity must be the aboli
tion of omnipotent government. The
purpose of those who believe in
human rights must be the enfeeble
ment of the state.

The crimes of Nazism were not an
isolated occurrence in this century.
The Stalinist liquidation of the

landlord class, the atrocities in
Amin's Uganda, and the contempor

National Socialism is but one var

that denies the concept of inaliena

rights only as privileges granted by
the state.
Of course, both liberals and con
servatives in contemporary America
give obeisance to the idea of human
rights. But if the freedom of the indi

law and order or with the liberals'
demands for welfare, equality, and
economic control and planning,
their lip-service to individual rights is
easily forgotten. The premises com

transcended only by the small band
of libertarians.
The crimes of Nazism were made
possible by the mythology of the
state. The mystic concepts of the rule
of law or the will of the people or the
authority of government cause men
to perform or sanction actions which
they would never condone if per
formed by persons acting as private
individuals. Such mystification is not
restricted to those relative few who
executed Hitler's will; it pervades the
attitude of normal people towards
government.
If a private individual attempts to
forcibly compel other people to sur
render to him a certain fraction of
their income, he would be univer
sally denounced as a robber or extor
tionist. But if his demands are
cloaked in the sanctity of govern

euphemism of "tax collector."
This willingness to judge those acts

SCRIP claims errant
In a flyer posted around the cam

Stanford Committee for a Responsi

some assertions that deserve com
ment.
SCRIP claimed that the trustees had

ignored the wishes of "3,600 people
(including 238 faculty) who signed
petitions calling for withdrawal." All
well and good. But this University
has over 10,000 people in it, so it
seems to me that the trustees were
justified in concluding that some 65
per cent of the people on campus
were not particularly concerned with
the issue.
Next we find the statement that
"61 per cent of the students who
voted supported the withdrawal re
ferendum." The key phrase here is
"who voted," because as I recall the
voting was very light indeed.
When you add to the 39 per cent of
students who voted against a with
drawal the large numbers who didn't
care enough to vote at all, you see
howthe trustees might concludethat
to the great majority of people on
campus this was a classic "nonis
sue."
The SCRIP manifesto ends with
this stirring call to arms: "We must
demonstrate that we will not allow
the trustees to ignore the sentiment
of the Stanford community. We must
act now."
Incredibly, having failed twice to
gain majority support — once
through a referendum, once through
an election — SCRIP still believes
that it can arrogate to itself the right
to determine the "sentiment of the

Apartheid 'supported'
The Board of Trustees, by their re
cent vote on the CIR recommenda
tions, apparently believes that poli
tics and economics can be separated
in South Africa, that it is possible to
decide, in a given instance, whether
a corporation is exercising a good or
bad influence on the culture of apar
theid.
The argument is reminiscent of
Milton Friedman's on Chile — that it
is possible to deplore the repres
sions of an authoritarian political re
gime (as the trustees claim to deplore
apartheid), yet at the same time, and
without contradiction to actively
back the economic forces support
ing that regime.
„ Friedman's arguement was bril
liantly answered by Orlando La
Letelier (Chilean ambassador to the
United States under President Al
lende) only a few weeks before
Letelier was murdered in September
1976 on the streets of Washington.
"Common sense tells us," argued
Letelier, "that economic policies are
conditioned by and at the same time
modify the social and political situa
tion where they are put into prac
tice." It is naive to suppose that poli
tics and economics in South Africa
can be separated, as the trustees are
trying to do.
If the "private sector" is allowed to
exist by that authoritarian regime,
then that "private sector" is in some
way serving the ends of that regime.
Indeed, given the realities of South
African politics, it could hardly be
any other way.
I sincerely hope that, as the trus
tees do their homework on South Af
rica, and reevaluate this decision,
they will all read Donald Woods' im
portant book, "Biko." Steve Bikowas
a black martyr to the South Africa
police state as Donald Woods is a
white exile from that same state;
not long ago they both held views

similar to those of the trustees —
that corporations could serve
progressive ends and that reform
could be achieved without "an
economic upheaval."
Woods believes so no longer; and,
before he died in prison at the hands
of the South African Security Police
in September 1977, Biko had this to
say:
"The argument is often made that
loss of foreign investment would
hurt blacks the most. It would un
doubtedly hurt blacks in the short
run, because many of them would
stand to lose their jobs, but it should
be understood in Europe and North
America that foreign investment
supports the present economic sys
tem of political injustice. We blacks
are therefore not interested in
foreign investment."
For the trustees to write letters to
corporation presidents saying that
"Stanford is strongly opposed to
apartheid, and we believe that U.S.
corporations can and should exert a
positive force in the direction of ob
taining meaningful steps toward the
achievement of full political, legal,
and social rights for everyone"
(Campus Report, April 26,1978), is to
do precisely nothing about apar
theid.
Pious letters like that, unbacked by
any positive action, are tantamount
to a confession of indifference. (They
are certainly — with that ''positive
force in the direction of obtaining
meaningful steps" — a confession of
indifference to the graces of the En
glish language!)
The U.S. corporations in South Af
rica are a part of the system of apar
theid; their very existence in that sys
tem is evidence of their bad be
havior, for they exist on condition
that they not attack the system in
which they thrive. Not to be actively
against apartheid is to be tacitly for it.
That is the shameful position the vote
of the trustees puts Stanford in.

"Common sense tells us," argued

white exile from that same state;
not long ago they both held views

similar to those of the trustees —
that corporations could serve
progressive ends and that reform
could be achieved without "an
economic upheaval."
Woods believes so no longer; and,
before he died in prison at the hands
of the South African Security Police
in September 1977, Biko had this to
say:
"The argument is often made that
loss of foreign investment would
hurt blacks the most. It would un
doubtedly hurt blacks in the short
run, because many of them would
stand to lose their jobs, but it should
be understood in Europe and North
America that foreign investment
supports the present economic sys

are therefore not interested in
foreign investment."
For the trustees to write letters to
corporation presidents saying that
"Stanford is strongly opposed to
apartheid, and we believe that U.S.
corporations can and should exert a
positive force in the direction of ob
taining meaningful steps toward the
achievement of full political, legal,
and social rights for everyone"
(Campus Report, April 26,1978), is to
do precisely nothing about apar

Pious letters like that, unbacked by
any positive action, are tantamount

are certainly — with that ''positive

indifference to the graces of the En

The U.S. corporations in South Af

The crimes of Nazism were not an
isolated occurrence in this century.
The Stalinist liquidation of the
kulaks, the Maoist elimination of the
landlord class, the atrocities in
Amin's Uganda, and the contempor

Cambodia rank alongside Hitler's

National Socialism is but one var

philosophy of the twentieth century:
the philosophy that holds that indi

that denies the concept of inaliena

rights only as privileges granted by
the state.
Of course, both liberals and con

give obeisance to the idea of human
rights. But if the freedom of the indi

ity, national security and defense, or
law and order or with the liberals'
demands for welfare, equality, and
economic control and planning,
their lip-service to individual rights is
easily forgotten. The premises com

transcended only by the small band
of libertarians.
The crimes of Nazism were made
possible by the mythology of the
state. The mystic concepts of the rule
of law or the will of the people or the
authority of government cause men
to perform or sanction actions which
they would never condone if per
formed by persons acting as private
individuals. Such mystification is not
restricted to those relative few who
executed Hitler's will; it pervades the
attitude of normal people towards
government.
If a private individual attempts to
forcibly compel other people to sur
render to him a certain fraction of
their income, he would be univer
sally denounced as a robber or extor
tionist. But if his demands are
cloaked in the sanctity of govern

euphemism of "tax collector."
This willingness to judge those acts

We would like to commend the

However, we feel that in the quest to

In sponsoring one-sided political

SCRIP claims errant
In a flyer posted around the cam
pus on Wednesday, April 26, The
Stanford Committee for a Responsi
ble Investment Policy (SCRIP) made
some assertions that deserve com
ment.
SCRIP claimed that the trustees had

ignored the wishes of "3,600 people
(including 238 faculty) who signed
petitions calling for withdrawal." All
well and good. But this University
has over 10,000 people in it, so it
seems to me that the trustees were
justified in concluding that some 65
per cent of the people on campus
were not particularly concerned with
the issue.
Next we find the statement that
"61 per cent of the students who
voted supported the withdrawal re
ferendum." The key phrase here is
"who voted," because as I recall the
voting was very light indeed.
When you add to the 39 per cent of
students who voted against a with
drawal the large numbers who didn't
care enough to vote at all, you see
howthe trustees might concludethat
to the great majority of people on
campus this was a classic "nonis
sue."
The SCRIP manifesto ends with
this stirring call to arms: "We must
demonstrate that we will not allow
the trustees to ignore the sentiment
of the Stanford community. We must
act now."
Incredibly, having failed twice to
gain majority support — once
through a referendum, once through
an election — SCRIP still believes
that it can arrogate to itself the right
to determine the "sentiment of the
Stanford community" and to act ac
cordingly.
This is arrogant and antidemocra

Apartheid 'supported'
The Board of Trustees, by their re
cent vote on the CIR recommenda
tions, apparently believes that poli
tics and economics can be separated
in South Africa, that it is possible to
decide, in a given instance, whether
a corporation is exercising a good or
bad influence on the culture of apar
theid.
The argument is reminiscent of
Milton Friedman's on Chile — that it
is possible to deplore the repres
sions of an authoritarian political re
gime (as the trustees claim to deplore
apartheid), yet at the same time, and
without contradiction to actively
back the economic forces support
ing that regime.

In sponsoring one-sided political
activities such as Disorientation
Week they claim to be trying to
"educate" the "Stanford Commun
ity." The problem is that "educating"
is not what they are doing. In pre
senting their views in such a biased,
partisan manner, they are attempting
to indoctrinate the students with
their political ideals.
Instead of an objective presenta
tion of the pros and cons of different
political ideologies so that we stu
dents may decide for ourselves, they
have taken it upon themselves to de
cide what is right for all of us. In es
sence, they are attempting to indoc
trinate us with their ideals and call it
"education."
Their ultimate offense is to decry
this University as a bastion of elitism
while dominating the very
"bourgeois democratic system" rep
resented by the ASSU Senate
The SOC senators have
exemplified elitism through their
unabashed attempts to allocate the
entire Discretionary Fund to their
cause.
Their manner of "politically
educating the community," in fact,
alienates it. Therefore their methods
cannot succeed.
If the SOC truly wishes to interest
the "elitists" in alternative methods
of thinking, they must approach
them as fellow participants in politi
cal forums. Instead, they have
treated others here as mere pupils,
to be indoctrinated by their masters.

SCRIP claims errant
In a flyer posted around the cam
pus on Wednesday, April 26, The
Stanford Committee for a Responsi
ble Investment Policy (SCRIP) made
some assertions that deserve com
ment.
SCRIP claimed that the trustees had

ignored the wishes of "3,600 people
(including 238 faculty) who signed
petitions calling for withdrawal." All
well and good. But this University
has over 10,000 people in it, so it
seems to me that the trustees were
justified in concluding that some 65
per cent of the people on campus
were not particularly concerned with
the issue.
Next we find the statement that
"61 per cent of the students who
voted supported the withdrawal re
ferendum." The key phrase here is
"who voted," because as I recall the
voting was very light indeed.
When you add to the 39 per cent of
students who voted against a with
drawal the large numbers who didn't
care enough to vote at all, you see
howthe trustees might concludethat
to the great majority of people on
campus this was a classic "nonis
sue."
The SCRIP manifesto ends with
this stirring call to arms: "We must
demonstrate that we will not allow
the trustees to ignore the sentiment
of the Stanford community. We must
act now."
Incredibly, having failed twice to
gain majority support — once
through a referendum, once through
an election — SCRIP still believes
that it can arrogate to itself the right
to determine the "sentiment of the
Stanford community" and to act ac
cordingly.
This is arrogant and antidemocra
tic, and that it is done in a "good
cause" does not make it defensible.
In a democracy, the intensity of feel
ing you bring to an issue does not
give you the right to have your vote
count for more than other people's.

Apartheid 'supported'
The Board of Trustees, by their re
cent vote on the CIR recommenda
tions, apparently believes that poli
tics and economics can be separated
in South Africa, that it is possible to
decide, in a given instance, whether
a corporation is exercising a good or
bad influence on the culture of apar
theid.
The argument is reminiscent of
Milton Friedman's on Chile — that it
is possible to deplore the repres
sions of an authoritarian political re
gime (as the trustees claim to deplore
apartheid), yet at the same time, and
without contradiction to actively
back the economic forces support
ing that regime.
„ Friedman's arguement was bril
liantly answered by Orlando La
Letelier (Chilean ambassador to the
United States under President Al
lende) only a few weeks before
Letelier was murdered in September
1976 on the streets of Washington.
"Common sense tells us," argued
Letelier, "that economic policies are
conditioned by and at the same time
modify the social and political situa
tion where they are put into prac
tice." It is naive to suppose that poli
tics and economics in South Africa
can be separated, as the trustees are
trying to do.
If the "private sector" is allowed to
exist by that authoritarian regime,
then that "private sector" is in some
way serving the ends of that regime.
Indeed, given the realities of South
African politics, it could hardly be
any other way.
I sincerely hope that, as the trus
tees do their homework on South Af
rica, and reevaluate this decision,
they will all read Donald Woods' im
portant book, "Biko." Steve Bikowas
a black martyr to the South Africa
police state as Donald Woods is a
white exile from that same state;
not long ago they both held views

similar to those of the trustees —
that corporations could serve
progressive ends and that reform
could be achieved without "an
economic upheaval."
Woods believes so no longer; and,
before he died in prison at the hands
of the South African Security Police
in September 1977, Biko had this to
say:
"The argument is often made that
loss of foreign investment would
hurt blacks the most. It would un
doubtedly hurt blacks in the short
run, because many of them would
stand to lose their jobs, but it should
be understood in Europe and North
America that foreign investment
supports the present economic sys
tem of political injustice. We blacks
are therefore not interested in
foreign investment."
For the trustees to write letters to
corporation presidents saying that
"Stanford is strongly opposed to
apartheid, and we believe that U.S.
corporations can and should exert a
positive force in the direction of ob
taining meaningful steps toward the
achievement of full political, legal,
and social rights for everyone"
(Campus Report, April 26,1978), is to
do precisely nothing about apar
theid.
Pious letters like that, unbacked by
any positive action, are tantamount
to a confession of indifference. (They
are certainly — with that ''positive
force in the direction of obtaining
meaningful steps" — a confession of
indifference to the graces of the En
glish language!)
The U.S. corporations in South Af
rica are a part of the system of apar
theid; their very existence in that sys
tem is evidence of their bad be
havior, for they exist on condition
that they not attack the system in
which they thrive. Not to be actively
against apartheid is to be tacitly for it.
That is the shameful position the vote
of the trustees puts Stanford in.

Motives doubted
To the trustees of Stanford Uni
versity:
We strongly oppose your recent
vote against the proxy resolution cal
ling for withdrawal of Texaco's in
vestments in South Africa.
This action has forced us to doubt
your motives in establishing the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility. The CIR has intensively
studied the situation in South Africa,
and as a result of their deeper under
standing unanimously voted in favor
of the proxy resolution. In light of
your more limited knowledge on this
issue, how can you justify your disre
gard for their unanimous recom
mendation?
U.S. Corporations' presence in
South Africa supports the economy
and thereby the government itself.
As a force for social change in the
past, these corporations have had a
dismal record. Even if corporations
were to act more responsibly, the
most they could do would be to in
crease wages and desegregate toilets
— instances of "petty" apartheid.
There is no way this would lead to
changes in the basic system of apar
theid — that policy which denies
blacks any representation in the gov
ernment, relegates them to scatted
unliveable patches of land (13 per
cent of the land for 81 per cent of the
population!), and forces families to
live apart.
In the past we have not supported
divestment because we felt Stanford
could be more effective working for
change from within. The position is
dependent upon Stanford's invest

merits being used in a morally re
sponsible way. Since it is apparent
that this is not happening consis
tently, we are forced to consider
changing our position.
We urge you to be more respon
sive to the CIR in the future, espe
cially in the forthcoming proxy votes
on Phelps-Dodge and Standard Oil.

Reiterating facts
The recent national attention given
to the Nazi Holocaust requires that
certain facts be reiterated.
The crimes of Nazism were not an
isolated occurrence in this century.
The Stalinist liquidation of the
kulaks, the Maoist elimination of the
landlord class, the atrocities in
Amin's Uganda, and the contempor
ary mass murders in Communist
Cambodia rank alongside Hitler's
Final Solution.
National Socialism is but one var
iant of the predominant political
philosophy of the twentieth century:
the philosophy that holds that indi
viduals exist to serve the good of soc
iety or the purpose of society's rep
resentative the state, a philosophy
that denies the concept of inaliena
ble human rights and conceives of
rights only as privileges granted by
the state.
Of course, both liberals and con
servatives in contemporary America
give obeisance to the idea of human
rights. But if the freedom of the indi
vidual conflicts with the conserva
tives' concern for traditional moral
ity, national security and defense, or
law and order or with the liberals'
demands for welfare, equality, and
economic control and planning,
their lip-service to individual rights is
easily forgotten. The premises com
mon to both left and right have been
transcended only by the small band
of libertarians.
The crimes of Nazism were made
possible by the mythology of the
state. The mystic concepts of the rule
of law or the will of the people or the
authority of government cause men
to perform or sanction actions which
they would never condone if per
formed by persons acting as private
individuals. Such mystification is not
restricted to those relative few who
executed Hitler's will; it pervades the
attitude of normal people towards
government.
If a private individual attempts to
forcibly compel other people to sur
render to him a certain fraction of
their income, he would be univer
sally denounced as a robber or extor
tionist. But if his demands are
cloaked in the sanctity of govern
ment and blessed wi{h the holy let
ters "IRS," he is described by the
euphemism of "tax collector."
This willingness to judge those acts
performed in the name of govern
ment by different standards than
those applied to non-governmental
acts explains how normally decent
people were able to be a part of Na
tional Socialism.
The horrors and atrocities charac
teristic of the twentieth century will
continue as long as men continue to
believe the ideas and support the in
stitutions which make those horrors
possible. They can be ended only by
stripping the institution of govern
ment of its veil of morality and au
thority. The goal of those who care
about humanity must be the aboli
tion of omnipotent government. The
purpose of those who believe in
human rights must be the enfeeble
ment of the state.
