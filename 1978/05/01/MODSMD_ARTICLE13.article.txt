## Card nine 1-2 against Bruins Guardino ties Stanford season HR record 
### Cathy Dickerson 
This weekend, by setting our
clocks ahead to daylight-saving
time, we all lost an hour of
sleep. The Stanford baseball
team lost more than just sleep
over the weekend, however.
The Cards dropped two out of
three games to the UCLA
Bruins.
Friday night, the Bruins sub
dued the Cards 6-1. Saturday,
the two teams split a doub
leheader: UCLA taking the first
game 15-8, Stanford finishing
on top in the second 8-6.
Meanwhile, across town, the
USC Trojans swept their series
with Cal.
Although the losses were
disappointing to the team,
there were several bright spots
in the weekend series, particu
larly at the plate. With the ex
ception of Friday night's game,
the Cardinals hit the ball hard
and, for a change, did not hit it
right at the opposition.
Tom Guardino's 13th home
run of the season was one of
the highlights, even though it
came in Saturday's 15-8 loss.
The senior first baseman tied
the Stanford season homerun
record, clobbering a belt-high
Tim Leary fastball 400 feet over
the left-centerfield fence in
Sawtelle Field.
"I was happy with the home
run," said Guardino, "but it
was pretty secondary as far as

the rest of the game went . . .
we lost 15-8. However, offen
sively we were really outstand
ing . . . with a little pitching
and defense we could've
won."
Guardino expressed con
cern over the six runs Stanford
gave the Bruins in the second
inning of that game after they
had two outs. Also, he blamed
himself fora couple of the runs
UCLA scored in the fourth.
Guardino booted a possible
double play ball that would've
given them the third out of the
inning. One of the next Bruin
batters went on to hit a home
run.
The series statistics on Guar
dino overshadow the error,
however. The Cards' clean-up
batter went six-for-thirteen in
the series, collecting two dou
bles and a homerun, driving in
three runs and scoring four
times.
"With the exception of Fri
day's game, we hit the ball
well," said coach Mark Mar
quess. "We scored 14 runs in
two games." Commenting on
the final game of the series,
Marquess praised starting
pitcher Brian Harrison, calling
his performance "one of the
best games he's pitched all
year."
Harrison held the Bruins to
one run until the bottom of the
ninth when he got a little tired,

gave up a couple of runs, and
was relieved by Bruce Fiala.
Even though Fiala gave up a
three-run homerun to UCLA
third baseman Dave Baker be
fore getting the final out, the
Cardinals' eight runs were
enough for the victory.
Leading 1-0 in the seventh
inning, Stanford started a
two-out rally that brought in
four runs. Pepe Hiqojosa
sparked the Cards with a dou
ble and Ervin followed suit,
doublingHinojosa home. Larry
Reynolds then reached first on
an error and jogged home in
between Ervin and Wong when
Wong blasted a three-run
homerun.
UCLA's junior outfielder
Craig Johnson answered in the
bottom of the seventh with a
solo homerun.
Stanford added three more
runs to its total in the top of the

ninth, again with two outs.
With Ervin on second and
Guardino on first, Mike
Codiroli singled to drive in one
run, then Dave Perez doubled
in Guardino. An error on UCLA
shortstop Mobil Cox allowed
Codiroli to cross the plate scor
ing Stanford's final run.

weekend, blasting a towering shot that tied him for the Stanford season homerun record.
