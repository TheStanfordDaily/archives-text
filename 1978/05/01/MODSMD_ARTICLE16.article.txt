# 'Big Meet' is Cards' 'Big Defeat'
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
The 84th Big Meet at Ber
keley played out true to form
Saturday — and that spelled
out "defeat" for Stanford.
California took the meet
86-68, using their depth and
their prowess in the field
events to wear down the Car
dinals.
Indeed, Stanford won the 11
running events by a score of
In the field events, how
ever, the Cards won but two
events, being outscored42-19.
Cardinal coach Payton Jor
dan was resigned in defeat.
"We did what we are capable
of doing. I went into the meet
knowing we had to find 10
points somewhere to beat Cal,
and we didn't get them. They
just did what they had to do."
Those points which would
have given Stanford a 78-76 vic
tory were narrowly missed by
the Stanford running squad. In
five races — the 100, 200, 400,
800 and the 110 HH — the dif
ference between second and
third was one-tenth of a sec
ond or less. In all five, Stanford
was on the short end of the
stick.
Toppingthe fine showingsof
the runners was senior sprinter
james Lofton. Lofton had three
individual firsts and was on
both winning relay teams. In
cluded in his efforts was a
school record 20.5 in the 200,
and a 10.5 for the 100 into a
headwind.
"I felt good today," said Lof
ton after the meet. In running

five events, Lofton had to use
his strength economically. "In
the 100, coach Marvin Holmes
told me to run just hard
enough to win. That's also why
I quit long jumping after two
jumps." Lofton's jump of 25-7
was good enough, outlasting
the field by more than one and
one-half feet.
Other fine performers on
the track included distance
man Roy Kissin, who won by
half a lap in setting a Big Meet
record of 14:25.2 in the 5000,
Darrin Nelson, who ran a
lifetime best in the 200 of 21.2,
and Gordon Banks, who ran a
lifetime best of 47.9 in the 400.
In the field events, California
clearly proved the superior
team. "We had a couple of
breakdowns in the field
events," said Jordan. "Their
second man in the discus (Tony
Hill) improved nine feet. I
thought we would pick up a
third in the pole vault, but Tori
Lewis beat out our man Carl
Johnk."
Jordan also credited the par
tisan crowd of 5000 for spurring
the Cal athletes to perform
well. "Their long jumpers both
credited the crowd with jack
ing them up to jump well." In
the long jump, Darrin Nelson
moved to second on his last
jump, ahead of both Mike Mar
low and Floyd Eddings of Cal.
With the crowd cheering them
on, both men outjumped Nel
son, changing what seemed to
be an 8-1 Stanford win into a 5-4

Stanford win.
"The crowd really helped
them," said Jordan. "It can get
lonely out there when no one
is yelling for you."
In other field events, Stan
ford's Ricky Brown finished
third in the javelin, despite
throwing 195-7, one of his best
efforts of the year. And, in
somewhat of a surprise, high
jumper )ohn Littleboy won

with a jump of 6-6, winning it
with the fewest misses.
When it came right down to
it, California "deserved to
win," said )ordan. "They did
what they had to do." Senior
sprinter Alan Sheats expressed
it best of all. "They did the un
expected and we didn't. And
for us to win," continued
Sheats, "it would have had to
be the other way around."

The 84th Big Meet at Ber
keley played out true to form
Saturday — and that spelled
out "defeat" for Stanford.
California took the meet
86-68, using their depth and
their prowess in the field
events to wear down the Car
dinals.
Indeed, Stanford won the 11
running events by a score of
In the field events, how
ever, the Cards won but two
events, being outscored42-19.
Cardinal coach Payton Jor
dan was resigned in defeat.
"We did what we are capable
of doing. I went into the meet
knowing we had to find 10
points somewhere to beat Cal,
and we didn't get them. They
just did what they had to do."
Those points which would
have given Stanford a 78-76 vic
tory were narrowly missed by
the Stanford running squad. In
five races — the 100, 200, 400,
800 and the 110 HH — the dif
ference between second and
third was one-tenth of a sec
ond or less. In all five, Stanford
was on the short end of the
stick.
Toppingthe fine showingsof
the runners was senior sprinter
james Lofton. Lofton had three
individual firsts and was on
both winning relay teams. In
cluded in his efforts was a
school record 20.5 in the 200,
and a 10.5 for the 100 into a
headwind.
"I felt good today," said Lof
ton after the meet. In running

five events, Lofton had to use
his strength economically. "In
the 100, coach Marvin Holmes
told me to run just hard
enough to win. That's also why
I quit long jumping after two
jumps." Lofton's jump of 25-7
was good enough, outlasting
the field by more than one and
one-half feet.
Other fine performers on
the track included distance
man Roy Kissin, who won by
half a lap in setting a Big Meet
record of 14:25.2 in the 5000,
Darrin Nelson, who ran a
lifetime best in the 200 of 21.2,
and Gordon Banks, who ran a
lifetime best of 47.9 in the 400.
In the field events, California
clearly proved the superior
team. "We had a couple of
breakdowns in the field
events," said Jordan. "Their
second man in the discus (Tony
Hill) improved nine feet. I
thought we would pick up a
third in the pole vault, but Tori
Lewis beat out our man Carl
Johnk."
Jordan also credited the par
tisan crowd of 5000 for spurring
the Cal athletes to perform
well. "Their long jumpers both
credited the crowd with jack
ing them up to jump well." In
the long jump, Darrin Nelson
moved to second on his last
jump, ahead of both Mike Mar
low and Floyd Eddings of Cal.
With the crowd cheering them
on, both men outjumped Nel
son, changing what seemed to
be an 8-1 Stanford win into a 5-4

Stanford win.
"The crowd really helped
them," said Jordan. "It can get
lonely out there when no one
is yelling for you."
