# Called 'repressive and arbitrary'
## Controversy surrounds grievance policy 
### Gary Furlong News analysis 
The new University policy for
handling staff grievances has re
cently been called "repressive and
arbitrary." The new policy, which
went into effect this month, covers
all non-faculty, non-union staff.
The controversy centers on one
major issue, access to an outside
hearing officer to settle a dispute
which the University and the
employee cannot reconcile.
Under the old procedure a griev

ant was theoretically allowed access
to an outside arbitrator for almost
any complaint not resolvable with his
supervisors. The new procedure,
however, limits such access to cases
of firing or permanent layoff of an
employee, leaving an entire range of
problems from demotion to pay cut
back in the hands of University man
agement for final decisions.
Henry Organ, employee in the
general secretary's office and leading
critic of the new policy, believes
there is no way that University mana

gers can make objective decisions in
disputes between their employer,
the University and its staff members.
"What they are saying is that there
will benoappeal mechanism forany
thing short of firing," Organ said.
"And for the most part, the Univer
sity managers who will settle these
disputes are going to take a position
against a grievance being filed. Any
manager who wants to advance in
the University will not decide against
their employers very often."
The University may indeed be put

ting a fair amount of indirect pres
sure on the managers themselves in
this case.
On the other hand, Manager of
Employee Relations Sue Paulsen and
Director of Personnel Robert Parker
have confidence in the new proce
dure.
"The significant change in the pro
cedure is because of the new aware
ness that supervisors and managers
have to deal with these problems,"
Parker said. "Hundreds of hours
have been spent with the line mana
gers to help them deal with grievance
problems. Because of this training,
the University now has the accoun
tability to deal with these problems
internally."
Object of training
Obviously, as Paulsen and Parker
pointed out, the object of the train
ing is to take care of any problems
before they reach a written grievance
case, hopefully to the satisfaction of
both the University and the
employee.
There is also little doubt that the
extensive training of the line mana
gers will greatly help bring many dis
putes to a settlement
long before any written grievance is
filed.

In the past four years, there have
been 50 written grievances filed by
employees. Of these 50, a total of 22
per cent (11 cases) have either been
or are going to be decided by outside
arbitration. This is a significant
number of serious complaints.
It should be remembered, how
ever, that many of these grievances
occurred before the manager train
ing took place.
As stated by another employee
upset with the new policy, "They're
assuming 99 per cent fairness out of
the same managers, just because of
some training. They'll never get it."
Statements such as "direct and ad
verse effect on the grievant" are suf
ficiently vague that no standard in
terpretation can be drawn from the
new ruling. Some argue it is unfair to
the employees, who do not have a
standard definition to work with.
The true test of whether the criti
cisms of the new policy are valid will
take place when it has been in use for
a while. Any final judgments must
wait until then.
