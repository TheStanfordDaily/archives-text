# Called 'repressive and arbitrary'
## Controversy surrounds grievance policy 
### Gary Furlong News analysis 
The new University policy for
handling staff grievances has re
cently been called "repressive and
arbitrary." The new policy, which
went into effect this month, covers
all non-faculty, non-union staff.
The controversy centers on one
major issue, access to an outside

have to deal with these problems,"
Parker said. "Hundreds of hours
