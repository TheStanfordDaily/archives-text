Scaffold investigation begins
Parkersburg, W. Va. — Several factors may have
contributed to the scaffold collapse that sent 51
men to their deaths at a power plant cooling tower
last week, the leader of a team of federal inves
tigators said yesterday.
David Rhone, regional director of the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
said his team of six investigators is examining the
quality of the concrete, the mechanism used to
hoist concrete to the top of the tower, the design
of the towerand the method by which the scaffold
ing was moved up after each day's work.
The principal theory advanced after the collapse
was that the last batch of concrete poured atop the
cooling tower had not set well enough to hold the
steel pins supporting the scaffold.
Investigators said they do not believe a flaw in
the scaffold itself caused the collapse.
Afghan prime minister named
New Delhi, India — Afghanistan's new military
government gave the first hint of its political lean
ing yesterday by announcing the selection of Nur
Mohammed Taraki, a reported leftist, as prime
minister in the wake of last week's bloody coup.
New reports said at least 500 persons were killed
in the uprising.
Kabul Radio in the Afghan capital announced
Taraki's appointment in a broadcast monitored
here and in London. In another broadcast moni
tored in Islamabad, Pakistan, the radio said the
Soviet Union yesterday became the first nation to
recognize the new government.
In Moscow, the Soviet government gave no im
mediate confirmation of that report. Kabul Radio
called Taraki a "nationalist and revolutionary per
sonality" but gave no party affiliation.
Rhodesian firing raises furor
Salisbury, Rhodesia — A powerful faction in
Rhodesia's biracial administration yesterday de
manded the reinstatement of black cabinet minis
ter Byron Hove, but wavered on whether to quit
the interim government in a dispute over his fir
ing.
"The party is reviewing the whole question of its
continued participation in the transitional gov
ernment," the United African National Council
said in a statement.
The statement came after a four-hour meeting
between party leaders and their head — Bishop
Abel Muzorewa, an influential moderate and one
of three blacks on Rhodesia's ruling executive
council.
Hove, dismissed as co-minister of justice Friday
for criticizing the racial makeup of Rhodesia's
police and judiciary, told reporters in London that
the two-month-old government would be in
danger without Muzorewa. He is thought to have
the widest support of any council member among
Rhodesia's blacks.

Carter quote upsets Egyptians
Cairo, Egypt — The newspaper Al Ahram pub
lished an interview yesterday quoting President
Jimmy Carter as saying a Mideast peace settlement
is possible without an independent Palestine state
and without complete Israeli withdrawal from oc
cupied Arab lands.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ibrahim Kamel sum
moned American Ambassador Hermann Eilts to
explain Carter's statements.
The semi-official Cairo paper referred to Car
ter's remarks as "Strange statements . . . con
tradicting all his previous statements."
Previously, Carter has said he favors a "home
land" for the Palestinians and has lent support to
the Palestinians determining their own future.
"The foreign minister was disturbed by the re
port," Eilts told a reporter after the 40-minute
meeting. Eilts said he did not have a transcript of
the interview with Carter.
Kamel said after the meeting with Eilts that he
has asked for a "full text and clarification" of the
statements attributed to Carter.
Nuclear protest draws 5000
Golden, Colo. — A weekend rally that drew some
5000 protesters to the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons
plant drew to a close with an overnight vigil on a
little-used railroad track leading to the plant.
For many who stood for four hours in the wind
and the rain to decry the use of nuclear power, the
weekend held memories of otherdemonstrations,
rallies and marches. But for those who were
around for the turmoil of the 19605, it was a picnic
in comparison.
Saturday's demonstration was the largest ever
held atthe plant, the nation'sonly producer of the
plutonium components for nuclear bombs.
There were no arrests, and plant security offi
cials said the protesters would be allowed to stay
as long as they wish, providing they do not move
along the tracks toward the plant — about V/ 2
miles away.
New letters attributed to Moro
Rome — A flurry of new letters attributed yester
day to former Premier Aldo Moro pressed for ac
ceptance of his kidnappers' demand that the gov
ernment free 13 jailed terrorists in exchange for his
liberty.
The Italian government and ruling Christian
Democratic Party have steadfastly refused that ul
timatum from the Red Brigade's ultra-leftist guer
rillas who seized Moro, the 61-year-old party pres
ident, on March 16.
Seven new pleas purportedly from Moro went
to Italy's heads of state, government and legisla
ture as well as to Christian Democrat colleagues
and the leader of the Socialist Party noted for his
more conciliatory approach to dealing with
Moro's captors.

Cal may lose research grants
Los Angeles — The University of California at
Berkeley may lose millions of dollars in research
grants and contracts starting today because of a
dispute with the federal government over hiring
practices, it was reported yesterday.

the university and the U.S. Department of Health,
Education and Welfare.
The government has set today as the deadline
for the dispute to be resolved.
Without federal certification, Cal will not be

said.
Dayan against Mideast jet sale
Washington — Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe
Dayan said yesterday that Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance is wrong to contend that President Jimmy
Carter's proposed jet sales to Israel and two Arab
countries will increase chances for peace in the
troubled region.
Vance and Dayan basically reiterated public sen
timents al ready expressed over the proposed sales
of jet fighters to Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia in
appearances on nationally broadcast interview
programs. Their remarks came on the eve of for
mal consideration of the sales by Congress.
Nixon held tapes as 'insurance'
New York — Richard Nixon says in his memoirs
that he held on to his White House tapes as "insur
ance" in case his aides turned against him as John
Dean had done.
It was a decision, he says, that helped doom his
tenure in the White House.
"I now believe," he wrote, "that from the time
of the disclosure of the existence of the tapes and
my decision not to destroy them, my presidency
had little chance of surviving to the end of its
term."
Nixon talked about the tapes in the second seg
ment of his memoirs published in today's editions
by newspapers that bought the syndication rights
from a subsidiary of The New York Times.

Cairo, Egypt — The newspaper Al Ahram pub
lished an interview yesterday quoting President
Jimmy Carter as saying a Mideast peace settlement
is possible without an independent Palestine state
and without complete Israeli withdrawal from oc
cupied Arab lands.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ibrahim Kamel sum
moned American Ambassador Hermann Eilts to
explain Carter's statements.
The semi-official Cairo paper referred to Car
ter's remarks as "Strange statements . . . con
tradicting all his previous statements."
Previously, Carter has said he favors a "home
land" for the Palestinians and has lent support to
the Palestinians determining their own future.
"The foreign minister was disturbed by the re
port," Eilts told a reporter after the 40-minute
meeting. Eilts said he did not have a transcript of
the interview with Carter.
Kamel said after the meeting with Eilts that he
has asked for a "full text and clarification" of the
statements attributed to Carter.
Nuclear protest draws 5000
Golden, Colo. — A weekend rally that drew some
5000 protesters to the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons
plant drew to a close with an overnight vigil on a
little-used railroad track leading to the plant.
For many who stood for four hours in the wind
and the rain to decry the use of nuclear power, the
weekend held memories of otherdemonstrations,
rallies and marches. But for those who were
around for the turmoil of the 19605, it was a picnic
in comparison.
Saturday's demonstration was the largest ever
held atthe plant, the nation'sonly producer of the
plutonium components for nuclear bombs.
There were no arrests, and plant security offi
cials said the protesters would be allowed to stay
as long as they wish, providing they do not move
along the tracks toward the plant — about V/ 2
miles away.
New letters attributed to Moro
Rome — A flurry of new letters attributed yester
day to former Premier Aldo Moro pressed for ac
ceptance of his kidnappers' demand that the gov
ernment free 13 jailed terrorists in exchange for his
liberty.
The Italian government and ruling Christian
Democratic Party have steadfastly refused that ul
timatum from the Red Brigade's ultra-leftist guer
rillas who seized Moro, the 61-year-old party pres
ident, on March 16.
Seven new pleas purportedly from Moro went
to Italy's heads of state, government and legisla
ture as well as to Christian Democrat colleagues
and the leader of the Socialist Party noted for his
more conciliatory approach to dealing with
Moro's captors.

of jet fighters to Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia in

Nixon held tapes as 'insurance'
New York — Richard Nixon says in his memoirs
that he held on to his White House tapes as "insur
ance" in case his aides turned against him as John
Dean had done.
It was a decision, he says, that helped doom his
tenure in the White House.
"I now believe," he wrote, "that from the time
of the disclosure of the existence of the tapes and
my decision not to destroy them, my presidency
had little chance of surviving to the end of its
term."
Nixon talked about the tapes in the second seg
ment of his memoirs published in today's editions
by newspapers that bought the syndication rights
from a subsidiary of The New York Times.

Scaffold investigation begins
Parkersburg, W. Va. — Several factors may have
contributed to the scaffold collapse that sent 51
men to their deaths at a power plant cooling tower
last week, the leader of a team of federal inves
tigators said yesterday.
David Rhone, regional director of the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
said his team of six investigators is examining the
quality of the concrete, the mechanism used to
hoist concrete to the top of the tower, the design
of the towerand the method by which the scaffold
ing was moved up after each day's work.
The principal theory advanced after the collapse
was that the last batch of concrete poured atop the
cooling tower had not set well enough to hold the
steel pins supporting the scaffold.
Investigators said they do not believe a flaw in
the scaffold itself caused the collapse.
Afghan prime minister named
New Delhi, India — Afghanistan's new military

Rhodesian firing raises furor

of three blacks on Rhodesia's ruling executive

my decision not to destroy them, my presidency
had little chance of surviving to the end of its
term."
Nixon talked about the tapes in the second seg
ment of his memoirs published in today's editions

from a subsidiary of The New York Times.
