### 
Lewisburg, Ga. (AP) — Saying he would do it all
again, convicted spy Robert Thompson left the
Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary yesterday on his
way to asylum in Communist East Germany in a
complicated swap involving four governments.
Thompson told waiting newsmen that espion
age is not "a game, it's a serious business. But if I
had to do it over again, I'd have to do it again. This
was my job ... I wouldn't change a day in my life,
but I'm glad to be out."
Thompson, 43, who said he was born in Leipzig,
in what is now East Germany, was an Air Force
clerk convicted of passing secrets to the Soviets in
1965. He had been in Lewisburg, a forboding red
brick prison that once held union boss |immy
Hoffa, for more than 13 years of his 30-year sen
tence.
Thompson declined to confirm that he really
was a major in the Soviet KGB secret police. He

also refused to say what his real name is.
"I can't go into that right now," he replied.
"Maybe later on I can give you some more, okay?"
He said he was headed straight for a flight out of
the United States to Germany with East German
attorney Wolfgang Vogel, instrumental in arrang
ing a prisoner exchange involving Thompson, a
young American student jailed by East Germany,
and an Israeli pilot released a week earlier by
Mozambique in Africa.
"You see how that sun's shining today?"
Thompson asked. "That's how I feel.
"I want to thank all the people . . . that were
involved in helping me get my freedom and I just
want to go home and be at peace with the world,"
Thompson said.
Still left to be freed is Alan Van Norman, 23, of
Windom, Minn., waiting in an East Berlin prison.
Van Norman was sentenced to a 2Vi-year term
by the East Germans for trying to smuggle a doc

tor, his wife and his son to the West. He has been
in jail since February 1977.
Thompson said he would not be talking to Van
Norman when he gets to East Berlin. Tall, heavy
set, some of his teeth missing, bearded and gray,
an obviously euphoric Thompson refused to say
where he would meet Vogel and on which flight
they would go to East Germany.
It was realiably understood, however, that
Vogel and Thompson would meet aboard an air
craft that would first take them to Frankfurt in West
Germany.
Thompson said the key to his own release after
so many years was the release by Mozambique of
Israeli flier Miron Marcus, 24, who was let go by
the Communist-controlled regime after 19 months
in prison. He was jailed after his light plane made
an emergency landing on a flight from Rhodesia to
South Africa.
