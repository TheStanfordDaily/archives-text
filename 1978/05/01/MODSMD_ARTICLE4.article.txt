# Dancers 'boogie' to tunes for Dystrophy

Dance-A-Thon participants
danced the night away to the tune of
$11,600, according to Jere
Thompson, chairman of the Muscu
lar Dystrophy Dance-A-Thon Com
mittee.
"And that is a conservative esti
mate," Publicity Chairperson Kate
Supple said. "We still have expenses
to pay and there will still be money
coming in for a few weeks. We might
make more than $12,400," she said.
Surpassing the committee's origi
nal goal of $10,000, the fundraiser's
success surprised committee mem
bers, Supple said. Eighty couples
participated — each couple raising at
least $125 in donations from one or
more sponsors for eight hours of
dancing.
Although there has been no offi
cial reaction from the Muscular Dys
trophy Association, Regional Direc
tor Dave Van Etten was "extremely
excited over the reaction that came
from the school and how much
money was made," Supple said. Van
Etten said he hopes it will become an
annual event, she said.
The mood at the Dance-A-Thon
Friday night was energetic and
happy. T-shirted ("Can't Stop Danc
ing") participants danced in front of
Memorial Church in the Inner Quad
beginning at 6 p.m.
Three bands
The participants kept warm in the
chilly air by dancing to music
supplied by the Gilbert Band, Up In
The Air and the Brothers Owens.
One dancer, sophomore Dave
Richardson, said he was pleased with
the turnout of both dancers and on
lookers.
"I had a great time," Richardson
said. "All the bands, especially the
last (the Brothers Owens), were
good and I was impressed by the fact
that they did it for free."
Sophomore Kelly Foster, another
dancer, said that students were gen

erally supportive. "It took about an
hour each for my partner and I to
raise $150. People were very willing
to pledge us."
Supple estimated that about 2000
people in all attended the eight-hour
event.
Spectators were entertained by
raffle drawings, the awarding of
prizes and a dance contest. The high
light of the hourly raffle drawings
came at 11 p.m. when Dean of Ad
missions Fred Hargadon drew the
winners' tickets.
Hargadon gets laugh
Hargadon got a laugh from the
crowd when he jokingly announced
that the next winner drawn would
receive an acceptance for his
younger brother or sister into Stan
ford.
Hargadon described the Dance-
A-Thon as "tremendous," and said it
could become an annual event."I
think it's obviously a great cause. It
may be that it could set a pattern for
one year trying to do better than the
last — although I think this year's set
a pretty fast pace."
Hargadon also helped judge the
dance contest, according to Supple.
The prize, a dinner at Ming's, was
won by Clark Sterling and Pam Tarr.
Prizes were awarded for couples
who raised the most money. First
prize of a week at Snowbird ski resort
was awarded to Leslie Crozier and
Hank Johns, who raised $1350. Bar
bara Bass and )im Moroney, who
raised $502, received the second
place prize of a dinner at the
Gatehouse. Mark Finn and Ava Bes
bris, raising $400, won a dinner at
Chef Chu's.
Among organizations raising the
most money, Kappa Kappa Gamma
sorority won the first place prize of 20
laps at the Malibu Grand Prix for rais
ing $2228. Zeta Psi fraternity, raising
$891, won 20 cases of beer and the
American Studies house won 15
cases of beer for raising $752.

The participants kept warm in the
chilly air by dancing to music
supplied by the Gilbert Band, Up In
The Air and the Brothers Owens.
One dancer, sophomore Dave
Richardson, said he was pleased with
the turnout of both dancers and on
lookers.
"I had a great time," Richardson
said. "All the bands, especially the
last (the Brothers Owens), were
good and I was impressed by the fact
that they did it for free."
Sophomore Kelly Foster, another
dancer, said that students were gen

erally supportive. "It took about an
hour each for my partner and I to
raise $150. People were very willing
to pledge us."
Supple estimated that about 2000
people in all attended the eight-hour
event.
Spectators were entertained by
raffle drawings, the awarding of
prizes and a dance contest. The high
light of the hourly raffle drawings
came at 11 p.m. when Dean of Ad
missions Fred Hargadon drew the
winners' tickets.
Hargadon gets laugh
Hargadon got a laugh from the
crowd when he jokingly announced
that the next winner drawn would
receive an acceptance for his
younger brother or sister into Stan
ford.
Hargadon described the Dance-
A-Thon as "tremendous," and said it
could become an annual event."I
think it's obviously a great cause. It
may be that it could set a pattern for
one year trying to do better than the
last — although I think this year's set
a pretty fast pace."
Hargadon also helped judge the
dance contest, according to Supple.
The prize, a dinner at Ming's, was
won by Clark Sterling and Pam Tarr.
Prizes were awarded for couples
who raised the most money. First
prize of a week at Snowbird ski resort
was awarded to Leslie Crozier and
Hank Johns, who raised $1350. Bar
bara Bass and )im Moroney, who
raised $502, received the second
place prize of a dinner at the
Gatehouse. Mark Finn and Ava Bes
bris, raising $400, won a dinner at
Chef Chu's.
Among organizations raising the

ing $2228. Zeta Psi fraternity, raising
