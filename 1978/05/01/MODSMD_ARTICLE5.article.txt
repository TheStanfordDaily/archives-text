# Internal struggle mars elections
## Balloting for USE officers slated 
### Bill Burger News analysis 
The long-fought internal strug
gle in United Stanford Employees
(USE) will be at least partially re
solved at tomorrow's member
ship meeting when the results of
the officers election will be an
nounced.
A flock of leaflets and newspap
ers both attacking and defending
the present Jim Berk-Anne
Schlagenhaft union leadership
have descended on the member
ship in the last several months.
The anti-Berk slate of officers,
led by presidential candidate Bob
Britton, is confident of total vic
tory in the election. Britton pre
dicts his slate will win by a "grea
ter than two-to-one margin."
Anne Schlagenhaft, current
USE president and candidate for
union secretary, said she does not
"have any idea" about the elec
tion's results. She did say a high
turnout would best favor her
slate.
Members of the Britton slate
criticize Berk for being too hard

lined in his dealing with the Uni
versity. They propose a more
pragmatic approach, fighting only
those grievances with legitimate
cases.
Berk claims he has been the
only one fighting for the union
members for several years. He
claims all grievances are worth
fighting for.
The widespread dissatisfaction
with the Berk regime was evident
at the April meeting where fewer
than 25 members supported Berk
on issues relating directly to the
differences between the factions.
Tim Twomey, a vice president
for the Service Employees Inter
national Union (SEIU) ffom San
Francisco chaired the April meet
ing at the request of people on
both sides of the dispute.
The April membership meeting
was attended by more than 180
members, an extremely large
turnout for USE.
At the March meeting, Berk was
fired as a union employee by a
vote of the members present. The
meeting was later declared invalid

because USE member Bill
Reynolds was elected to chair the
meeting in place of Schlagenhaft.
It was the invalidation of that
meeting which postponed the of
ficers election until tomorrow's
meeting.
The Britton slate is composed of
Mike Harris, candidate for secret
ary, Karl Schroeder for treasurer,
Sylvia Harris for reporter and Bill
Reynolds as write-in candidate for
assistant president.
Don Ramsay, the original can
didate for assistant president, was
eliminated from the race when it
was discovered he was five days
late in paying his December union
dues.
Ramsay's appeal to SEIU was
denied. Rather-than face further
appeals and rulings with the risk
of losing office if elected, it was
decided by the Britton slate that
Bill Reynolds would run as a
write-in candidate for assistant
president instead.
Berk's slate has Chuck Lacy
running for assistant president,
Anne Schlagenhaft for secretary,

Ron Seefred for treasurer and Bob
Buker for reporter.
Berk, the current union secret
ary, was the target of a recent con
stitutional amendment prohibit
ing one person from holding
union office and being a paid
union employee at the same time.
The amendment was over
whelmingly passed by a 411-147
vote at the April membership
meeting. According to
Schlagenhaft, Berk will take a
leave of absence as a union
employee if elected president.
The Berk forces have published
two "Reality" newspapers in the
last month in an effort to take a
solid foothold against the wide
spread dissatisfaction with the
leadership and mount an offen
sive against the opposition.
The "Reality" papers were cal
led a "bunch of lies" by Britton
who said it was easy for readers to
see "he (Berk) is just throwing
mud."
Schlagenhaft said the Berk slate
has received "positive feedback

from both papers."
The Britton slate countered the
second "Reality" paper with one
headed "Rebuild Our Union."
This paper contained a letter from
the USE lawyers attacking the
Berk/Schlagenhaft leadership.
Schlagenhaft said the lawyers'
letter was "full of false accusa
tions," in her letter in the second
Reality paper.
Berk said in the same issue his
slate would not rehire the same
Wolpman and Eichner law firm if
elected.
judging from the tenor of the
last two membership meetings
and the results of the constitu
tional amendment, the Berk slate
has a long way to go to win this
election.
Just what difference a pragmatic
leadership would have in the un
ion's dealings with the University
are unknown but certainly the
successes of the union in tne past
have been less than spectacular.
Whether or not this election
will erase the differences in the
union is questionable however,
because Berk's powerful position
as union employee will remain in
tact for the time being.

Mike Harris, candidate for secret
ary, Karl Schroeder for treasurer,
Sylvia Harris for reporter and Bill
Reynolds as write-in candidate for
assistant president.
Don Ramsay, the original can
didate for assistant president, was
eliminated from the race when it
was discovered he was five days
late in paying his December union
dues.
Ramsay's appeal to SEIU was
denied. Rather-than face further
appeals and rulings with the risk
of losing office if elected, it was
decided by the Britton slate that
Bill Reynolds would run as a
write-in candidate for assistant
president instead.
Berk's slate has Chuck Lacy
running for assistant president,
Anne Schlagenhaft for secretary,

Ron Seefred for treasurer and Bob
Buker for reporter.
Berk, the current union secret
ary, was the target of a recent con
stitutional amendment prohibit
ing one person from holding
union office and being a paid
union employee at the same time.
The amendment was over
whelmingly passed by a 411-147
vote at the April membership
meeting. According to
Schlagenhaft, Berk will take a
leave of absence as a union
employee if elected president.
The Berk forces have published
two "Reality" newspapers in the
last month in an effort to take a
solid foothold against the wide
spread dissatisfaction with the
leadership and mount an offen
sive against the opposition.
The "Reality" papers were cal
led a "bunch of lies" by Britton
who said it was easy for readers to
see "he (Berk) is just throwing
mud."
Schlagenhaft said the Berk slate
has received "positive feedback

from both papers."
The Britton slate countered the
second "Reality" paper with one
headed "Rebuild Our Union."
This paper contained a letter from
the USE lawyers attacking the
Berk/Schlagenhaft leadership.
Schlagenhaft said the lawyers'
letter was "full of false accusa
tions," in her letter in the second
Reality paper.
Berk said in the same issue his
slate would not rehire the same
Wolpman and Eichner law firm if
elected.
judging from the tenor of the
last two membership meetings
and the results of the constitu
tional amendment, the Berk slate
has a long way to go to win this
election.
Just what difference a pragmatic
leadership would have in the un
ion's dealings with the University
are unknown but certainly the
successes of the union in tne past
have been less than spectacular.
Whether or not this election
will erase the differences in the
union is questionable however,
because Berk's powerful position
as union employee will remain in
tact for the time being.
The long-fought internal strug
gle in United Stanford Employees
(USE) will be at least partially re
solved at tomorrow's member
ship meeting when the results of
the officers election will be an
nounced.
A flock of leaflets and newspap
ers both attacking and defending
the present Jim Berk-Anne
Schlagenhaft union leadership
have descended on the member
ship in the last several months.
The anti-Berk slate of officers,
led by presidential candidate Bob
Britton, is confident of total vic
tory in the election. Britton pre
dicts his slate will win by a "grea
ter than two-to-one margin."
Anne Schlagenhaft, current
USE president and candidate for
union secretary, said she does not
"have any idea" about the elec
tion's results. She did say a high
turnout would best favor her
slate.
Members of the Britton slate
criticize Berk for being too hard

lined in his dealing with the Uni
versity. They propose a more
pragmatic approach, fighting only
those grievances with legitimate
cases.
Berk claims he has been the
only one fighting for the union
members for several years. He
claims all grievances are worth
fighting for.
The widespread dissatisfaction
with the Berk regime was evident
at the April meeting where fewer
than 25 members supported Berk
on issues relating directly to the
differences between the factions.
Tim Twomey, a vice president
for the Service Employees Inter
national Union (SEIU) ffom San
Francisco chaired the April meet
ing at the request of people on
both sides of the dispute.
The April membership meeting
was attended by more than 180
members, an extremely large
turnout for USE.
At the March meeting, Berk was
fired as a union employee by a
vote of the members present. The
meeting was later declared invalid

because USE member Bill
Reynolds was elected to chair the
meeting in place of Schlagenhaft.
It was the invalidation of that
meeting which postponed the of
ficers election until tomorrow's
meeting.
