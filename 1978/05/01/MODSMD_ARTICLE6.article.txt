# Police harassing Spinks

Leon Spinks hasn't had an easy
time of it.
Since he barely beat Muhammad
Ali last February for the World
Heavyweight Boxing Championship,
Spinks has had more than his share
of trouble.
He was evicted by his St. Louis
landlord, arrested for driving with
out a license. Then he had half of his
title stripped from him because he
had signed a contract to fight Ken
Norton next but decided instead to
give Ali a rematch.
Maybe you can say he's brought it
all on himself and be justified in say
ing so. That's not really the issue
here. The issue is Spinks' latest ar
rest.
On April 21, Spinks was again ar
rested in St. Louis. The police stop
ped him for driving with no lights on
at 4 a.m. He was driving again with
out a license. Spinks was arrested for
possession of cocaine and
marijuana.
Somewhere there's a leap from
being stopped for driving with no
lights on and being busted for drugs.
How did the police find the drugs on
Spinks?
There are two different reports.
The first says Spinks began brandish
ing his broad-brimmed black hat at
the officers. Sure not to miss such a
clue, the police searched the hat and
found a foil packet containing the
cocaine. The marijuana was found in
a later search at police headquarters.
The other story says the officers
would have let Spinks go with only a
traffic summons if the woman in the
car with him hadn't started yelling
and cursing at the police. They
searched the car only because she
gave them a hard time.
How much cocaine was in that foil
packet? Only one hundreth of a
gram, worth about one dollar on the
streets. There was even a small
amount of marijuana: only .21 gram.
It doesn't take a sterling mind to
figure out what really happened.
Spinks' brother Michael says the
police in St. Louis have been haras
sing the Spinks brothers ever since
the 1976 Olympics. It got so bad
Michael left St. Louis for New York.
Everything about this arrest points
to a frame up. Why did the police
search Spinks' hat? The "l-dare-you
to-search -this-hat-band" explana
tion doesn't sound too plausible to

me. The other explanation does,
only because the woman with Spinks
probably made the police so mad
they felt they had to teach Spinks
another lesson.
After all, Spinks was reported to
have greeted the officers with
"Come-on, man, I'm Leon." The of
ficers wanted Spinks to realize just
who he was messing with. He was
probably just a little too cocky for
their tastes.
Without knowing anything about
the circumstances of the arrest, you
become suspicious as soon as you
hear the drugs found on Spinks were
worth only $1.50. No one carries
around only .01 gram cocaine unless
they're pretty stupid. And the
marijuana they found in "a later
search" isn't even enough to make a
joint. Even the St. Louis detectives
admitted this.
Why stay?
The mystery is not whether Spinks
was set up; he was set up as sure as
Aldo Moro is dead. The mystery is
why Spinks stays in St. Louis and
why the police there are out to get
him.
I don't think anyone can answer
for why Spinks insists on staying in
St. Louis. Maybe he'll change his
mind now.
As for why the police are out to get
him, you can easily come up with a
few theories. Maybe they don't like
his attitude, but then Spinks comes
on nowhere as strongly as Ali. Maybe
they're jealous of his title and want to
make sure the remaining half of it is
taken away by ruining his reputation.
Maybe they don't like him because
he's black.
No one can say for sure why Spinks
is a target in St. Louis. The very fact
that he is and that he can be so easily
set up makes a statement about the
police in this country.
Sure, police are people, too, just
trying to do their job. Sure, their job
can be dangerous and isn't suitable
for everyone. Sure, they're only
human and occasionally it's easier to
take protection money and look the
other way. Most of the time it might
even be justifiable.
But it's just too easy for a police
man to become corrupt. It's too easy
for an entire police force to become
corrupt. It's too easy for innocent
people to be set up at the whim of an

individual cop or as a result of col
laboration by the whole force.
All aren't perfect
Anyone who still believes police
men are all fine, upstanding men and
women with hearts of gold and a
deep-running love for the law and
respect for the civil rights of indi
viduals forgets the Chicano who
drowned in the custody of three
Houston policemen.
It's not all the fault of the police.
Part of it is due to the bad public
image they get from the uncovering
of corrupt cops and the deeds of
policemen like those in Houston.
Part of it is due to the overabun
dance of laws they must enforce, in
cluding stupid, outdated laws like
those against personal possession of
marijuana, or against certain sex acts
even between consenting adults.
These laws are just waiting to be
applied selectively, to make certain
people examples.
But the police have a responsibility
too. Not only must they enforce the
law and apprehend wrong-doers,
they must protect individual human
rights at the basic level. Perhaps the
latter is often too easy to forget.
