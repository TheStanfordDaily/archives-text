# Griffin for mascot
## 
### 
Banks et al.

We need a strong, unambiguous
school mascot/symbol; one which is
neither ridiculous nor offensive. In
advocating the consideration of a
new school mascot/symbol we are in
keeping with a desire on the part of
Stanford athletes and the Stanford
community for such action.
Past student referendums calling
fora school mascot (albeit with occa
sional ambiguous and zany results),
indicate such a desire,. The history
and tradition of Stanford athletics,
and of the University itself, can be
enhanced by the powerful effect an
appropriate mascot can provide.
Coupled with the desire for a mas
cot that does not offend any race of
people by mimicking their culture,
traditions or ceremonies, is the con
fusion and ambiguity surrounding
the present school symbol Cardinal.
Is it a bird or color?
Either way, cardinal is not a power
ful representative symbol. Often the
media and athletic opponents clas
sify us as the "cards" (e.g. shuffle the
cards), or equally as weak, as the
"cardinals," a docile male finch lack
ing association with both Stanford
and California.
To rectify our weak mascot situa
tion we recently presented President
Richard Lyman and Athletic Director
Joe Ruetz a petition with the signa
tures of 225 men and women varsity
athletes which specifically requests
official consideration of the GRIFFIN
(in addition to the color cardinal) as
the mascot/symbol of Stanford Uni
versity athletics.
The Griffin symbol is majestic yet
ferocious, both swift and alert, por
traying valor and wisdom. With the
body of a lion and the talons, wings
and beak of an eagle, the Griffin is
steeped in its own tradition as a pow
erful mythical creature.

Griffins were the secret weapons
of Califia, then mythical warrior
queen of "an island called California,
very near the Terrestrial Paradise."
The Griffin in art is traditionally red in
color, typifies the union of divine
and human traits, is an intelligent
creature, and serves only the ethical.
As a school symbol the Griffin is
used by few other institutions, a
complimentary aspect for Stanford, a
unique institution in itself.
Our student organized Griff in
fo r-mascot committee has been
working and enlisting support for
nearly two years. We generated the
aforementioned petition and circu
lated it among the various athletes
and athletic teams during autumn
and winter quarters of this academic
year.
We would like to see the Griffin
become Stanford's school symbol
and athletic mascot. It has the appeal
of a powerful symbol and a can
eliminate any confusion and am
biguity that presently exists.
