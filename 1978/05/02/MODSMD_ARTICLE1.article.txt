# Views on senate status varied

ASSU senators and Council of
Presidents (COP) members' reac
tions are mixed concerning the
proposed amendment to eliminate
the ASSU Senate.
Members of the Committee to Re
tire Aspiring Politicos (CRAP) need
600 signatures on the petition they
are circulating to place a constitu
tional amendment on next spring's
ballot.
If passed, the amendment would
transfer the senate's powers to the
COP, effectively eliminating the se
nate.
COP member Greg Larson called
CRAP's action "a good exercise."
Larson said he hopes the effect of the
petition will be to start a discussion
on the senate's structure, eventually
resulting in a more effective and effi
cient senate.
Senate functions
Senate Chairperson Fred Grethel
said the action "could potentially be
useful for opening a discussion" on
the functions of the senate and on
services to students.
However Grethel added he was
"worried" that the CRAP petition
may be being used by individuals to
"decrease the amount of input stu
dents" can have into the system.
COP member Steve Westley de
clined to comment.
Grethel added he was definitely in
favor of a review of the senate, but he

doesn't think abolishing the senate is
the way.
Other ways
Sen. Meriel Burtel said she was
"against eliminating the senate." She
added she thinks there are other
ways to make the senate more effec
tive.
She said the acronym CRAP was
"pretty appropriate."
"It's not a very logical way to go

about it" if they want senate reform,
she said.
Sen. Steve Buckley called the ac
tion a "misguidedeffort."The senate
needs reform, not elimination, he
said.
CRAP member Mike Roberts said
last night he was unsure of the
number of signatures collected so
far. But the drive is still on, according
to Roberts, "we want to see this thing
go."
