# 1915 genocide of Armenians
## Important to recall other annihilations 
### 
Shamshoian, Chooljian

On April 24th a march commemo
rated Armenian Martyr's Day in San
Francisco. It was an effort to bring
attention to human oppression of all
forms. Four hundred to 500 people
participated. Similar marches occur
red throughout the world.
The week of April 16th millions of
Americans were dramatically ex
posed to the emotional shock of
what it was like to be Jewish during
the Holocaust of 1939-45 in Nazi
Germany. The Holocaust once again
reminded us of the insidious nature
of man's inhumanity to man in the
form of genocide — the torture and
murder of a group of people due to
their religious, racial, political and
economic statuses. We were
shocked and stunned by the sys
tematic violence to which the Jews
were subjected by the Nazis. We may
cry out indignantly, but the fact is
that this genocide was neither un
ique nor new to the Twentieth Cen
tury.
Commemorating a nightmare
April 24 is the day which Arme
nians set aside to commemorate
their nightmare, as over 1.5 million of
their people were murdered at the
hands of the Turks. In April, 1915, the
Turkish government began to exe
cute a carefully calculated plan to
annihilate all the Armenian people
withintheboundariesofTurkey. Ina
matter of months 1.5 million de
fenseless women, children, and men
were massacred, while hundreds of
thousands became homeless re
fugees.
The plan was carried out in
stages in order to render the Arme
nians defenseless. First, the able
bodied men were forced to leave
their homes under the guise of man
datory government service, and
were organized into forced labor
battalions in which they were driven
mercilessly until they fell from
exhaustion, starved to death, or were
shot.
Next, on April 24, the intellectual,

cultural, and religious leaders were
gathered and sent to their deaths.
Mass deportation
Finally, mass deportation orders
were issued for those remaining.
Endless caravans of people — torn
from their confiscated homes and
lands were herded toward the desert
on death marches. Along the way
they were subjected to torture, muti
lation, rape, and massacre.
Still today the lives of the Arme
nians in Turkey are marked by op
pression and discrimination in the
sense that they are not allowed to
express themselves culturally, to
hold governmental jobs, and are very
much outcast by the Turkish major
ity. Oftentimes, expressions of
Armenians outside of Turkey bring
about a stricter repression of those
who remain in Turkey.
Turkey denies role
Moreover, Turkey still denies her
role in the genocide, and that in par
ticular is why the tragic fact is not
widely known, although it is well
documented by many non-Armenian
sources, including Ambassador
Morgenthau's Story, by
Hans Morgenthau, the American
ambassador to Turkey during 1915.
The genocide occurred. Nothing
unfortunately, can alter that fact. But
let not the past be prologued. Rather
than dwelling on the past — the los
ses, pain, and hurt which fills those
of us touched by it, it would seem
wise to put the tragedy behind us.
Yet, in all honesty, it is difficult to
forget when such a numbness over
whelms one's soul.
Our purpose in writing this article
is to appeal to man's humanity and to
encourage all people to refrain from
hatreds and prejudices.
Ending human oppression
In an effort to end human oppres
sion, a petition was circulated at the
Armenian Martyr's Day March and
sent to congressmen who are work
ing towards similar goals. The peti
tion states that the undersigned

would like the United States to con
sider the following:
—Sign and uphold the United Na
tions Genocide convention.
—Give no military aid to countries
which are violating the Genocide
Convention or the Helsinki Agree
ment.
—Declare April 24 a national day of
rememberance of "Man's Inhuman
ity to Man."
The Genocide Convention is an in
ternational agreement against the
complete annihilation of a group of
people for any reason. This was in
troduced to the United Nations in
1948 to prevent future atrocities, and
the United States has never ratified
it. The Helsinki Agreement is an in
ternational standard of human rights
to which the United States adheres,
but many of our allies do not. We
believe that our standards of human
rights should be shared by our milit
ary allies, and hopefully by the entire

world.
If our tenets are to be embraced,
we must live them as well as express
them. We propose that April 24, the
date marking the first genocide of
the 20th century, be made a national
memorial day to recognize past as
well as present atrocities. We en
courage all to become informed and
remember the sufferings of mankind
throughout history
By acknowledging the oppressed,
and bringing their plight to the foref
ront of our minds, we may help in
some small way to end present in
humane actions and prevent future
genocides. As Adolf Hitelr stated
while announcing his plans for the
Jewish genocide, "Who after all
speaks today of the annihilation of
the Armenians."
