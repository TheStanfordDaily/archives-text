Haus Mitteleuropa
We would like to thank Gila Ber
kowitz for the concern expressed in
her letter (Daily, April 24). As mem
bers of the group of students which
has been working on all aspects of
Haus Mitteleuropa for the past
couple of weeks we would like to
assure Berkowitz, and all others in
terested, that in this theme house we
shall critically explore as many as
pects as possible of Central Euro
pean history and culture through a
balanced and integrated program.
We shall try to increase awareness of
Central European problems and in
the process, deal with any existing
stereotypes.
We may add that we are planning
to include a course which will deal
with some of the concerns and ques

tions voiced in the letter. This course
will be an in-house seminar, but
everyone interested will be encour
aged to participate.
We would also like to stress that
"mitteleuropa" (Central Europe) —
contrary to what seems to be Ber
kowitz' conception of it — includes
not only East and West Germany, but
also Austria and Switzerland. All
these countries will be dealt with in
our program.
