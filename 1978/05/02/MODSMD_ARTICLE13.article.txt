# Library hours called successful

J. Henry Meyer Library's extended hours ex
periment during dead week and finals week last
quarter was a success and will probably be tried
again, according to Elizabeth Salzer, head libra
rian.
The library was open until 2:30 a.m. during
the last two weeks of winter quarter as an exper
iment to facilitate late-night studying. The lib
rary normally closes at midnight.
The experiment was made possible by a gift of
$4000 from an anonymous parent.
"Between 100 and 300 people were in Meyer
between midnight and 1:30 during the experi
ment," Salzer said. "After 1:30, the numbers fell
off sharply," she added.
The capacity of the library is 1600, but there
have never been more than 700 people there,
she said.
Salzer said she believes the library should
continue its extended hours policy, but stay
open only until 1:30 a.m.
Ideally, Salzer said, there should be a large
comfortable place for students to study, open 24
hours a day, other than a fully staffed library. At
present, Tresidder Union operates a 24-hour
study hall during dead week and finals week
each quarter.
Library services are usually unnecessary late at
night, and additional salaries run up costs, she
continued.
Salzer said that many new libraries are de
signed to have a large multifunctional room at
tached to the library. While the library is open,
the room is part of the library. The room is left

open for students when the library is closed.
However, "no library on campus, including
the new Green Library addition, has this facil
ity," Salzer said.
"Unfortunately, Meyer was not designed to
be a study hall," she said. "The building must be
entirely open as none of it can be closed off
effectively."
Considering otheralternatives, Salzer said the
audio library and the language labs are impracti
cal for doing work because of the large amount
of equipment they contain.
"However," Salzer said, "the downstairs clas
srooms have always been available and seem to
get lots of use."
The classrooms are-usually locked at 3 a.m.
However, no one is asked to leave if they are
already working there," she said.
In a survey conducted last month, Meyer lib
rary patrons were almost equally divided on
what type of catalog they thought most practical
â€” book form, done now or microfiche, used for
periodicals.
Currently, students look in the book catalog
for books acquired by the library before 1974.
The microfiche supplement to the book catalog
or card catalog supplement to the fiche must be
used to find books acquired after 1974.
The library board will make its final decision in
a few weeks. The new catalog will be ready in the
fall.
Students also recommended that the new
catalogs, in whatever form, be placed on each
floor of Meyer, in Green Library and various
branch libraries.
