Spring is here and so are two musicals new to
the Bay Area. And the plots of both are based
on history. ...
To your left: Smiling beneath all those hands,
Michael Rupert enjoys the title role in "Pip
pin," opening the Civic Light Opera season at
the Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco on
Tuesday, May 16.
The musical tells the story of young Pippin,
Charlemagne's son, who journeys far and wide
through a fantastic eighth century France to
find himself, love, the meaning of life, etc. The
show won five Tony awards and ran for five
years on Broadway, making it the seventh
longest-running musical in Broadway history.
It will be at the Orpheum through Saturday,
|une 24.
To your right: "Festival" is now enjoying a
world premiere engagement at ACT's Marines'
Theater in San Francisco. The musical is a

medieval fantasy based on a 13th century chan
tefable, a narrative form which combines spo
ken prose and sections of poetry that are
chanted or sung.
Out of costume here, Gregory Harrison
(top), Lois Young and Bill Hutton are trans
formed every night except Monday into a
troubador and a pair of young lovers, respec
tively.
Below: In a much more true-to-life vein, Dr.
Boyd (Michael Winters) and Sister McPhee
(Diane Salinger) finally express their love for
each other prior to a kidney transplant in ACT's
"The National Fiealth."
Based on England's sweeping system of
specialized medicine, which provides free
"cradle-to-grave" health care for everyone,
the play is filled with satire, gallows humor,
and outrageous gags. It ain't a musical and it
sure ain't fantasy, but it is one of the bright
spots of ACT's spring season.
