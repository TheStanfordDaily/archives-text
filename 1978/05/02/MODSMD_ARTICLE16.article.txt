Steve Hackett
Please Don't Touch
Chrysalis
In this, the latest album by a
former Genesis member gone
solo, guitarist Steve Hackett
delivers an eclectic mixture of
musical styles. With help from,
among others, Richie Havens
and Kansas' Steve Walsh and
Phil Ehart, Hackett serves up
everything from soul ("Hoping
Love Will Last") to ballads
("How Can I," "Icarus Ascend
ing") to rockers ("Please Don't
Touch"). The instrumentation,
from Hackett's noted guitar
playing to the unusual three
man string section, is right on
target, and lends each song the
right texture. The biggest prob
lem with this album is that
Hackett is not as good as a solo
songwriter as he was in collab
oration with other members of
Genesis, while with thatgroup.
Therefore, fans of Genesis
(who make up a good portion
of Hackett's following) are
bound to be somewhat dis
appointed by this album. Those
buying this album on its own
merits, however, should be
satisfied by an overall pleasing
album.

Ted Nugent
Double Live Conzo
Epic
Some call those sounds that
Ted Nugent makes music. I
prefer to call them organized
noises. On this double live al
bum, not only do we get Nu
gent's organized noises, but
we get organized noises from
the audience as well, so
perhaps a better title for this
album would be "A Duet of
Noises in Many Keys (at the
Same Time)." There are really
only two uses for this album
(which is about one more than
the number of distinguishable
Nugent melodies): a make
shift set of frisbees or a
last-resort pick-me-up for the
dying. Because whatever else
you may say about Ted's music,
the one undeniable thing is
that it's high-charged enough
to bring life to anything. Inci
dentally, "Cat Scratch Fever,"
"Motor City Madhouse," and
the new single "Yank Me
Crank Me" are Nugent at his
best, and guaranteed to bring
life to any midterm
studying dorm or frat.

The Rutles
The Rutles
Warner Bros.
If the Beatles had never
existed, this would probably

be heralded as one of the
greatest albums of the decade
— Neil Innes' songs in the vari
ous styles of the Beatles (but
NOT carbon copies) are that
accurate and that good. This
album, the soundtrack to the
T.V. Beatles spoof "All You
Need is Cash," is the perfect
acquisition for anyone who
likes the Beatles, but has
grown tired of the same old
songs. For those who are im
partial to the Beatles' music,
this album still has something
to offer in the included 20-page
booklet which describes the
Rutles' rise to fame and their
eventual breakup. The booklet
is based on the T.V. special,
which was facetiously based on
the Beatles' history, and the
whole package was cleverly
constructed by Monty
Python members Erid Idle and
Neil Innes.

Renaissance
Song For All Seasons
Sire
Unsurprisingly, this album is
finely crafted and lushly tex
tured, has reverence for the
past, and can deliver all the
exhaltation to a popular music
buff that Horowitz can deliver
to the classical connoisseur. As
in the past, Annie Haslam, the
operatically-trained singer
with the five-octave range
voice, does most of the lead
vocals, with Jon Camp singing
the remaining songs. Perhaps
the only bad thing to be said for

this album is that Louis Clark,
who, in addition to arranging
this album, has arranged the
works of the Electric Light Or
chestra, has donated a bit of
ELO's "sound" to Renais
sance's usually distinctive ar
rangements. This is a small de
fect, though, not seriously de
tracting from this luscious al
bum.

Art Garfunkel
Watermark
Columbia
This album serves to rein
force Garfunkel's reputation as
one of the classiest cover ar
tists on the music scene today.
There is not one song on the
album which could be called
sloppy. Garfunkel suffers from
a lack of variety, though, as be
comes all too apparent on the
first side. After the pretty "Cry

ing in My Sleep" and spunky
"Marionette," the remainder
of the songs on the side are
rather indistinguishable. The
excellence of the album picks
up again, however, on the sec
ond side, after the trite and
übiquitous single "Wonderful
World," and continues to the
album's end. Especially poig
nant is the sad "Mr. Shuck and
)ive." In all, Garfunkel, in con
junction with limmy Webb
(who wrote all but two of the
album's songs) is well deserv
ing of the "A-"grade he gave
himself for the album, in his
recent Newsweek interview,
with perhaps an "A" for effort.

Genesis
And Then There Were Three
Atlantic
With guitarist Steve Hac
kett's departure before the re
cording of this album, the orig
inal five-member group
Genesis has shrunken to three,
vocalist Peter Gabriel having
left last year. But surprisingly
enough Genesis is still able to
produce some of the most in
vigorating synthesizer-laden
music around, as is illustrated
by this long (over 52 minutes)
album. From the ballad "Many
too Many" to the rocker
"Down and Out," this album is
on a par with any of Genesis'
previous albums. It may be the
album to bring Genesis out of
cult status and into the
superstardom they need, as it
is showing promising initial

sales, and, in addition, con
tains the very accessible single
"Follow Me Follow You."

Ronnie Montrose
Open Fire
Warner Brothers
One of the most pleasant
surprises of the year, this
album is by the former leader
of the ultra-hard rock group,
Montrose. On this completely
instrumental album (which was
produced by Edgar Winter —
the first time Winter has pro
duced anyone except his own
White Trash group), Mr. Mon
trose reveals a variety of
songwriting talents which were
stifled while with his former
group. This album includes a
good variety of styles, from
rock to "progressive." Mon
trose's songwriting ability cul
minates, however, in his beaut
iful "My Little Mystery," a
guitar-harpsichord duet
backed by a double chamber
ensemble. In all, Ronnie Mon
trose should rightfully increase
his following from his Mon
trose days tenfold, and has in
creased the quality of his music
one hundredfold.
