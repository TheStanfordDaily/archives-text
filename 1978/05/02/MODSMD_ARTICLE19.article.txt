Police launch anti-fencing drive
San Francisco — An eight-month anti-fencing
operation by police and FBI agents working un
dercover from a bogus luggage store netted some
$800,000 worth of stolen goods and 51 indict
ments, officials announced yesterday.
Deputy Chief Clement DeAmicis, who led the
operation, said 27 of those indicted had been ar
rested by 4:30 p.m. yesterday and more arrests
were expected by the end of the week.
Dubbed "The Store," the operation began last
September when officers and FBI agents opened a
phony luggage store seven blocks from City Hall.
It soon became a magnet for Bay Area thieves who
wanted to get rid of their loot quickly for hard
cash.
Among the items the undercover officers
purchased:
Ten automobiles, two motorcycles, 45 35-mm
cameras, 311 pieces of clothing, three fur coats, 39
pounds of meat, 75 drivers licenses, 60 rings, 33
watches, 22 airline tickets, 555 credit cards, 39 sav
ings bonds, 33 typewriters, two computer termi
nals, 1506 cassette tapes, 26 televisions, six chain
saws, nine bootleg movies, 52 firearms, two cases
of whiskey, a sword, a fishing rod, a vibrator, an
oscilloscope and numerous other household
appliances, stereo equipment, auto parts, jewelry,
tools, office equipment and narcotics.
DeAmicis said $791,900 was a "very conserva
tive" estimate of the fair market value of all the
goods. He said "The Store" bought the goods for
an average 7 per cent of their market value, record
ing conversations and videotaping the sales.
A hefty jackhammer worth $1500 to $2000, for
example, was bought by "The Store" for $1,
DeAmicis said, explaining that the thief "just
didn't want to leave with it."
The "sting" operation was financed by a
$400,000 grant from the Law Enforcement Assis
tance Administration, intended to finance anti
theft efforts for 18 months. DeAmicis said "The
Store" is just one of the tactics police used.
Court rules on secret proceedings
Washington — The Supreme Court rules yester
day that news reporters cannot be criminally
punished for disclosing truthful accounts of secret
governmental proceedings to readers, viewers
and listeners.
Before recessing for two weeks, the justices
struck down a Virginia law that made it a crime to
report about a state judicial commission's confi
dential inquiries about judges' fitness to hold of
fice. <
Landmark Communications, publisher of the
Virginian-Pilot newspaper in Norfolk, was in
dicted, convicted and fined $500 after the news
paper ran an accurate report in 1975. The article
said that the state's Judicial Inquiry and Review
Commission had studied complaints against a
local domestic relations judge, H. Warrington
Sharp.

"The article published by Landmark provided
accurate factual information about a legislatively
authorized inquiry . . . and in so doing clearly
served those interests in public scrutiny and dis
cussion of governmental affairs which the First
Amendment was adopted to protect," Chief Jus
tice Warren Burger wrote for the court.
Israel's independence celebrated
Washington — President Jimmy Carter and Prime
Minister Menachem Begin celebrated Israel s 30th
birthday yesterday as Congress began considering
a proposed three-way jet fighter sale that has
heightened tension between the United States
and the Jewish state.
The occasion for Begin's visit was a White House
reception marking the U.S. observance of the an
niversary of the founding of Israel in 1948. Carter
invited about 1200 rabbis and other Jewish leaders
to join him and Begin at the White House recep
tion.
The Israeli leader also planned to hold private
talks with Carter concerning the impasse in Mid
dle East peace talks. But it was not immediately
known whether the pair would discuss Carter s
plan to sell jet fighters to Saudi Arabia and Egypt as
well as to Israel.
Fed adopts new banking policy
Washington — The Federal Reserve Board
moved yesterday to eliminate bouncing checks by
allowing consumers to authorize their banks to
pay checking account overdrafts from savings ac
counts.
Aimed at helping people avoid accidental over
drafts and keep a minimum balance in their check
ing accounts, the regulation takes effect Nov. 1.
The service would have to be requested by a
bank customer and would be available only to
individuals, not businesses or governmental units.
Under the transfer service, a customer could
open a savings account and a checking account at
a bank with any balance he chooses. If he writes a
check larger than the balance in his checking ac
count, the bank automatically pays the check from
money in the client's savings account.
American prisoner returned
Berlin — American student Alan Van Norman,
freed from an East German jail yesterday in ex
change for convicted Soviet spy Robert
Thompson, said he underwent "rough inter
views" and was put in solitary confinement when
he did not answer questions.
The exchange completed an international pris
oner swap among the United States, East Germany
and Mozambique that began last month.
Signatures for anti-gay bill filed
Los Angeles — While about 50 demonstrators
chanted "Stop Briggs, Stop Briggs," state Sen.
John Briggs filed 312,000 signatures yesterday with

the Los Angeles County Registrar of Voters, saying
he now has enough to qualifyforan anti-gay initia
tive for the November ballot.
He said his initiative was designed to remove
homosexuals from California's public schools and
let school districts fire or refuse to hire teachers
and other school personnel for engaging in public
homosexual conduct.
The senator, who is seeking the state Republi
can nomination for governor, said he felt the in
itiative was necessary to ensure that California's
children were given a "moral education.
"A teacher is required by law to teach morals,"
he said. "I don't think a person who is basically
immoral can teach. We have a right to determine
who will be teaching our children."
Youth job plan announced
Washington — Labor Secretary Ray Marshall says
six different programs will make 1.6 million sum
mer jobs available for young people this year,
primarily for disadvantaged youths aged 14 to 21.
"The summer program this year is of sufficient
size to absorb more than 90 per cent of the influx
of disadvantaged youths expected in the labor
market," commented Marshall.
Group attempts to clean up TV
Washington — A citizens group, contending that
television needs to clean up its act for children,
was exhorted by the head of the Federal Com
munications Commission yesterday to exercise
less rhetoric and a greater understanding of
economic realities.
FCC Chairman Charles Ferris made the state
ment in the context of detailing for members of
the organization — Action for Children's Televi
i sion (ACT) — the kinds of things his agency ex
pects of industries under its regulation.
Dow Jones continues to rise
New York — The Dow Jones average of 30 in
dustrials rose 7.01 to 844.33, stretching its gain
since Feb. 28, when it hit a three-year low of

finished at 844.42 last Nov. 25.
Trading remained active, with 37.02 : million
shares changing hands on the New York Stock

$800,000 worth of stolen goods and 51 indict
ments, officials announced yesterday.
Deputy Chief Clement DeAmicis, who led the
operation, said 27 of those indicted had been ar
rested by 4:30 p.m. yesterday and more arrests
were expected by the end of the week.
Dubbed "The Store," the operation began last
September when officers and FBI agents opened a
phony luggage store seven blocks from City Hall.
It soon became a magnet for Bay Area thieves who
wanted to get rid of their loot quickly for hard
cash.
Among the items the undercover officers
purchased:
Ten automobiles, two motorcycles, 45 35-mm
cameras, 311 pieces of clothing, three fur coats, 39
pounds of meat, 75 drivers licenses, 60 rings, 33
watches, 22 airline tickets, 555 credit cards, 39 sav
ings bonds, 33 typewriters, two computer termi
nals, 1506 cassette tapes, 26 televisions, six chain
saws, nine bootleg movies, 52 firearms, two cases
of whiskey, a sword, a fishing rod, a vibrator, an
oscilloscope and numerous other household
appliances, stereo equipment, auto parts, jewelry,
tools, office equipment and narcotics.
DeAmicis said $791,900 was a "very conserva
tive" estimate of the fair market value of all the
goods. He said "The Store" bought the goods for
an average 7 per cent of their market value, record
ing conversations and videotaping the sales.
A hefty jackhammer worth $1500 to $2000, for
example, was bought by "The Store" for $1,
DeAmicis said, explaining that the thief "just
didn't want to leave with it."
The "sting" operation was financed by a
$400,000 grant from the Law Enforcement Assis
tance Administration, intended to finance anti
theft efforts for 18 months. DeAmicis said "The
Store" is just one of the tactics police used.
Court rules on secret proceedings
Washington — The Supreme Court rules yester
day that news reporters cannot be criminally
punished for disclosing truthful accounts of secret
governmental proceedings to readers, viewers
and listeners.
Before recessing for two weeks, the justices
struck down a Virginia law that made it a crime to
report about a state judicial commission's confi
dential inquiries about judges' fitness to hold of
fice. <
Landmark Communications, publisher of the
Virginian-Pilot newspaper in Norfolk, was in
dicted, convicted and fined $500 after the news
paper ran an accurate report in 1975. The article
said that the state's Judicial Inquiry and Review
Commission had studied complaints against a
local domestic relations judge, H. Warrington
Sharp.

"The article published by Landmark provided
accurate factual information about a legislatively
authorized inquiry . . . and in so doing clearly
served those interests in public scrutiny and dis
cussion of governmental affairs which the First
Amendment was adopted to protect," Chief Jus
tice Warren Burger wrote for the court.
Israel's independence celebrated
Washington — President Jimmy Carter and Prime
Minister Menachem Begin celebrated Israel s 30th
birthday yesterday as Congress began considering
a proposed three-way jet fighter sale that has
heightened tension between the United States
and the Jewish state.
The occasion for Begin's visit was a White House
reception marking the U.S. observance of the an
niversary of the founding of Israel in 1948. Carter
invited about 1200 rabbis and other Jewish leaders
to join him and Begin at the White House recep
tion.
The Israeli leader also planned to hold private
talks with Carter concerning the impasse in Mid
dle East peace talks. But it was not immediately
known whether the pair would discuss Carter s
plan to sell jet fighters to Saudi Arabia and Egypt as
well as to Israel.
Fed adopts new banking policy
Washington — The Federal Reserve Board
moved yesterday to eliminate bouncing checks by
allowing consumers to authorize their banks to
pay checking account overdrafts from savings ac
counts.
Aimed at helping people avoid accidental over
drafts and keep a minimum balance in their check
ing accounts, the regulation takes effect Nov. 1.
The service would have to be requested by a
bank customer and would be available only to
individuals, not businesses or governmental units.
Under the transfer service, a customer could
open a savings account and a checking account at
a bank with any balance he chooses. If he writes a
check larger than the balance in his checking ac
count, the bank automatically pays the check from
money in the client's savings account.
American prisoner returned

tive for the November ballot.
He said his initiative was designed to remove
homosexuals from California's public schools and

homosexual conduct.
The senator, who is seeking the state Republi
can nomination for governor, said he felt the in
itiative was necessary to ensure that California's
children were given a "moral education.
"A teacher is required by law to teach morals,"
he said. "I don't think a person who is basically
immoral can teach. We have a right to determine
who will be teaching our children."

operation, said 27 of those indicted had been ar
rested by 4:30 p.m. yesterday and more arrests
were expected by the end of the week.
Dubbed "The Store," the operation began last
September when officers and FBI agents opened a
phony luggage store seven blocks from City Hall.
It soon became a magnet for Bay Area thieves who
wanted to get rid of their loot quickly for hard
cash.
Among the items the undercover officers
purchased:
Ten automobiles, two motorcycles, 45 35-mm
cameras, 311 pieces of clothing, three fur coats, 39
pounds of meat, 75 drivers licenses, 60 rings, 33
watches, 22 airline tickets, 555 credit cards, 39 sav
ings bonds, 33 typewriters, two computer termi
nals, 1506 cassette tapes, 26 televisions, six chain
saws, nine bootleg movies, 52 firearms, two cases
of whiskey, a sword, a fishing rod, a vibrator, an
oscilloscope and numerous other household
appliances, stereo equipment, auto parts, jewelry,
tools, office equipment and narcotics.
DeAmicis said $791,900 was a "very conserva
tive" estimate of the fair market value of all the
goods. He said "The Store" bought the goods for
an average 7 per cent of their market value, record
ing conversations and videotaping the sales.
A hefty jackhammer worth $1500 to $2000, for
example, was bought by "The Store" for $1,
DeAmicis said, explaining that the thief "just
didn't want to leave with it."
The "sting" operation was financed by a
$400,000 grant from the Law Enforcement Assis
tance Administration, intended to finance anti
theft efforts for 18 months. DeAmicis said "The
Store" is just one of the tactics police used.
Court rules on secret proceedings
Washington — The Supreme Court rules yester
day that news reporters cannot be criminally
punished for disclosing truthful accounts of secret
governmental proceedings to readers, viewers
and listeners.
Before recessing for two weeks, the justices
struck down a Virginia law that made it a crime to
report about a state judicial commission's confi
dential inquiries about judges' fitness to hold of
fice. <
Landmark Communications, publisher of the
Virginian-Pilot newspaper in Norfolk, was in
dicted, convicted and fined $500 after the news
paper ran an accurate report in 1975. The article
said that the state's Judicial Inquiry and Review
Commission had studied complaints against a
local domestic relations judge, H. Warrington
Sharp.

"The article published by Landmark provided
accurate factual information about a legislatively
authorized inquiry . . . and in so doing clearly
served those interests in public scrutiny and dis
cussion of governmental affairs which the First
Amendment was adopted to protect," Chief Jus
tice Warren Burger wrote for the court.
Israel's independence celebrated
Washington — President Jimmy Carter and Prime
Minister Menachem Begin celebrated Israel s 30th
birthday yesterday as Congress began considering
a proposed three-way jet fighter sale that has
heightened tension between the United States
and the Jewish state.
The occasion for Begin's visit was a White House
reception marking the U.S. observance of the an
niversary of the founding of Israel in 1948. Carter
invited about 1200 rabbis and other Jewish leaders
to join him and Begin at the White House recep
tion.
The Israeli leader also planned to hold private
talks with Carter concerning the impasse in Mid
dle East peace talks. But it was not immediately
known whether the pair would discuss Carter s
plan to sell jet fighters to Saudi Arabia and Egypt as
well as to Israel.
Fed adopts new banking policy
Washington — The Federal Reserve Board
moved yesterday to eliminate bouncing checks by
allowing consumers to authorize their banks to
pay checking account overdrafts from savings ac
counts.
Aimed at helping people avoid accidental over
drafts and keep a minimum balance in their check
ing accounts, the regulation takes effect Nov. 1.
The service would have to be requested by a
bank customer and would be available only to
individuals, not businesses or governmental units.
Under the transfer service, a customer could
open a savings account and a checking account at
a bank with any balance he chooses. If he writes a
check larger than the balance in his checking ac
count, the bank automatically pays the check from
money in the client's savings account.
American prisoner returned
Berlin — American student Alan Van Norman,
freed from an East German jail yesterday in ex
change for convicted Soviet spy Robert
Thompson, said he underwent "rough inter
views" and was put in solitary confinement when
he did not answer questions.
The exchange completed an international pris
oner swap among the United States, East Germany
and Mozambique that began last month.
Signatures for anti-gay bill filed
Los Angeles — While about 50 demonstrators
chanted "Stop Briggs, Stop Briggs," state Sen.
John Briggs filed 312,000 signatures yesterday with

the Los Angeles County Registrar of Voters, saying
he now has enough to qualifyforan anti-gay initia
tive for the November ballot.
He said his initiative was designed to remove
homosexuals from California's public schools and
let school districts fire or refuse to hire teachers
and other school personnel for engaging in public
homosexual conduct.
The senator, who is seeking the state Republi
can nomination for governor, said he felt the in
itiative was necessary to ensure that California's
children were given a "moral education.
"A teacher is required by law to teach morals,"
he said. "I don't think a person who is basically
immoral can teach. We have a right to determine
who will be teaching our children."
Youth job plan announced
Washington — Labor Secretary Ray Marshall says
six different programs will make 1.6 million sum
mer jobs available for young people this year,
primarily for disadvantaged youths aged 14 to 21.
"The summer program this year is of sufficient
size to absorb more than 90 per cent of the influx
of disadvantaged youths expected in the labor
market," commented Marshall.
Group attempts to clean up TV
Washington — A citizens group, contending that
television needs to clean up its act for children,
was exhorted by the head of the Federal Com
munications Commission yesterday to exercise

ment in the context of detailing for members of
the organization — Action for Children's Televi
i sion (ACT) — the kinds of things his agency ex
pects of industries under its regulation.
