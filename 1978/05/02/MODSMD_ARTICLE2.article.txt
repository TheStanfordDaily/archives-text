# Groups promote fee assessments
## 
### David Ansley 
Eight campus organizations are combining forces in
an attempt to win approval for their fee assessment
proposals in next week's special ASSU election.
The election, called by the ASSU Senate, will allow the
student groups a second chance of obtaining more than
$110,000 in student-paid assessments next year.
In an election held April 19 and 20, only three of the 11
fee requests on the ballot (KZSU, the Band and the Daily)
garnered the 20 per cent voter turnout necessary for
passage by the ASSU Constitution.
The eight groups on the May 10 and 11 ballot will be:
Stanford Committee on Political Education (SCOPE), the
Guest Professorship Board, the Publications Board, the
Academic Organizations Board, the Speakers Bureau,
the Legal Counseling Office, the ASSU Program Fee and
the Graduate Students Association.
Representatives of each group have agreed to work
together to publicize the upcoming election and im
prove voter turnout.
Four thousand copies of a joint flyer are being pro

duced by the Publications Board for mass distribution
early next week.
The Band plans an all-campus rally next Tuesday even
ing to get out the voters, according to Alex Jardetzky,
LSJUMB manager. A Thursday noon performance in
White Plaza, including a keg, is also slated, he said.
KZSU Station Manager Jon Morris said a live broadcast
from White Plaza at noon is being planned for next
Wednesday.
The Daily will provide advertising for the election.
The cost of the election must be borne by the groups
on the ballot, according to Sean Murphy, ASSU elec
tions commissioner. In order to reduce costs to about
$600, which will be divided up among the groups, the
organizations will provide their own tables, chairs and
poll watchers for most of the polling places.
Two more polling places than usual are planned for
the election, one to be located near the Escondido Road
entrance to Meyer Library and the second to be in the
mall between the Daily and Terman Engineering build
ing.
