"The most prevalent form of heart
disease is coronary heart disease,"
according to Dr. Roger Winkle, assis
tant professor of medicine in the De
partment of Cardiology here.
Winkle called coronary heart dis
ease a "big killer," causing the
deaths of about 300,000 Americans
last year.
Winkle spoke on the anatomy and
function of the heart as well as cur
rent areas of research and treatment
of heart disease last Wednesday at
the Med School.
Coronary heart disease, one of the
diseases which causes what lay per
sons call heart attacks, is really a man
ifestation of arteriosclerosis. This is a
hardening of the blood vessels which
supply the heart muscles with blood.
There are six major types of heart
disease, according to Winkle.
A common heart disease which
may result in the implantation of a
pacemaker is cardiac arrhythmia. Ar
rhythmia is an irregularity in the
heart's beating, Winkle said. When
necessary, a man-made pacemaker is
implanted to correct the heart's ir-

regular beating, he added.
Winkle said what are called "heart
murmers" are actually a description
of the sound caused by a leaky or
scared valve.
Malformations of the heart present
at birth are called congenital heart
disease, Winkle said. As an example
of a congenital heart disease, Winkle
cited the "interventricular septum
defect," a term for a hole in the mus
cle tissue separating blood with oxy
gen from blood without oxygen.
The resulting mixing of blood re
duces the amount of oxygen carried
to the body tissues in the arteries.
This can be surgically corrected, he
said.
Winkle said it is important to take
care of "our pump of life by exercis
ing regularly, correcting diets high in
fats and cholesterol, and not smok
ing-
Winkle's talk was one of four re
lated discussions. Tomorrow night,
Dr. Norman Shumway, heart trans
plant pioneer and chairman of car
diovascular surgery at the Med
School, will speak on the future of
heart transplants.
