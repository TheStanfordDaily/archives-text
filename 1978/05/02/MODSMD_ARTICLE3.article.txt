# SCRIP rally and sit-in draw 350 protesters
## 
### Joel Dickholtz 
About 150 angry demonstrators
occupied the lobby of Encina Hall
yesterday afternoon protesting the
Board of Trustees' decision to op
pose a Texaco Co. proxy calling for
corporate withdrawal from South Af
rica.
The protesters also demanded the
trustees vote yes on shareholder re
solutions that will be voted on today,
tomorrow and Thursday.
The demonstrators, who left the
building voluntarily after about an
hour, also demanded the trustees
come to Stanford next Tuesday to
"be educated as a responsible inves
tor."
Next Monday's trustee meeting is
scheduled to take place in Los
Angeles.
Protesters also called upon the
trustees to adopt a policy, as the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR) did, in favor of corpo
rate withdrawal from South Africa.
Noon rally
The sit-in followed an hour long
White Plaza rally that began at noon.
The rally, organized by members of
the Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP),
attracted about 350 people. SCRIP
members have scheduled a follow
up meeting to be held in Donner
House tonight.
After the rally, the demonstrators
marched to Encina Hall. They origi
nally planned to speak to Vice-
President for Business and Finance
William Massy.

However, Massy is out of town, so
protesters spoke instead with Rod
ney Adams, director of finance.
The demonstrators entered Encina
demanding to know what the trustee
ad hoc sub-committee on invest
ment responsibility had recom
mended, and how the trustees had
responded.
Adams said he was "not at liberty
to disclose what the committee re
commended." He added that not all
the trustee votes had been received.
Trustee decision process
The trustees read recommenda
tions made by the trustees' ad hoc
subcommittee. The trustees then
have a limited amount of time to ob
ject to the recommendations. If no
objections are received, Board Pres
ident Peter Bing approves the sub
committee's recommendations on
the proxies.
During the sit-in, Adams answered
demonstrators questions and re
corded their demands, agreeing to
forward the demands to the trustees.
The protesters expressed concern
about what they called a lack of

communication between the Stan
ford community and the trustees.
'Lack of education'
Demonstrators said the no vote on
the Texaco Co. proxy was the pro
duct of the trustees' "lack of educa
tion" on the issue. They added they
thought many of the trustees had
completely ignored the research the
CIR had done on that proxy.
"Do the trustees feel that they
know enough about the issue that
they don't have to read the report of
their own committee?" one de
monstrator asked.
Adams compared the process of
getting trustees to read the CIR re
ports to the process of getting stu
dents to study for a final exam.
"We gave the report to the trus
tees. We asked them to read the re
port. We've done everything we can
to get them to read the report," he
said.
He also cited some difficulty in dis
tributing the reports of the CIR.
Speeches at the rally and the sit-in
ranged from calm to emotional.
"I am from Africa. We are dying in
Africa every day," said Robert
Brooks, a UC-Berkeley graduate stu
dent, originally from Rhodesia.
"While you sit here talking and
debating, we are dying in the streets.
We want you and your corporations
out," Brooks said.
Peter Hendrickse, a black South
African, was a keynote speaker at the
rally and the sit-in. Hendrickse,
whose father currently heads the
South African labor party, is a stu
dent at Ohlone College in Fremont.
Hendrickse told demonstrators
that black South Africans are not
fighting for minor changes like "the
rights to go to the same restaurant (as
whites) and sit in the same toilets (as
whites). We are fighting for our
lives."
Progressive force argument
Ron Johnson, a student member of
the CIR, was another featured
speaker at the rally. He said the trus
tees' use of the progressive force ar
gument — that corporations can
bring about gradual change through

continued presence in South Africa
— is like optimists looking at a drop
of water in a glass.
"An optimist sees that glass as par
tially full because of that one drop.
Well, we (the CIR) went and we
looked at the historical context in
which that glass set. There was a 400
year drought . . . For the trustees to
say there's water in the glass is to
show that someone isn't doing their
homework," Johnson said.
