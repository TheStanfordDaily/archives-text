# Bing terms proxy situation difficult
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees intends to
make its proxy vote decisions public,
but not before the full board has had
an opportunity to respond to its ad
hoc Subcommittee on Investment
Responsibility's recommendations,
Board President Peter Bing said yes
terday.
In a telephone interview, Bing said
the complex mechanism for voting
the proxies, coupled with an "ex
treme time constraint" has made the
situation difficult.
He said it would be "inapprop
riate" to comment on the subcom
mittee recommendations on proxies
for Newmont Mining, Stanford Oil of
California, Mobil Oil and Phelps-
Dodge. He also declined to com
ment on the full board's leaning on
the questions.
According to Bing, the subcommit
tee met last week by conference call,
and members formulated recom
mendations on how to vote the re
ferenda after consideration of the
Commission on Investment Respon

sibility (CIR) recommendations and
information from the IRRC, an in
vestment consulting service used by
the University.
After the subcommittee meeting,
the results were sent to the full board
by mailgram. The mailgram also re
quested a response from each
member by this morning.
After Bing compiles the results to
day, he will telegraph the Universi
ty's vote on the issues to the corpora
tions, and follow that with a letter
explaining the board's rationale for
the action.
He said he would also send a letter
to the CIR explaining the move.
Bing said the full text of the vote
decisions will be published in the
Daily, as was the Texaco proxy deci
sion last week.
He added "as much discontent as
there is that the board has not made
its decision, there is an equal amount
of discontent on the board that it
cannot have more time to consider
the issues."
