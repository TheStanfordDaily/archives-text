# Major speeches on campus
## Abzug supports feminist movement 
### Michelle Vaughen 
Women remain on the fringe of a "flawed demo
cracy" whose "forefathers didn't give a hoot about
our foremothers," Bella Abzug said last night in a
speech sponsored by the Center for Research on
Women in Kresge Auditorium.
"I don't think we can any longer accept the
conditions in which only men rule the cities,
states, nations and the world. I don't think we can
continue to allow the exclusion of half the human
race from effective economic and political power.
"I believe if women shared power with men,
conditions would change. We'd figure out ways to
spend government money for more rational,
humane purposes," Abzug said.
The former congresswoman called for students
to get beyond "me-sim," or centering on oneself,
and become involved with the urgent problems of
unemployment, lack of a national health care and
the arms race.
"Our country now slumbers, and it worries
people like myself who have been an activist all my

life," said Abzug.
Calling the women's movement the "most sig
nificant movement today," Abzug said, "women's
liberation is also male liberation. There are plenty
of men locked in roles that they may not be fitted
to."
The women's movement affects every woman,
from the homemaker, whose hard work deserves
respect, to the female student who wants to be a
baseball player or a physician, to the widow, to the
battered wife, Abzug said.
"We're not just a bunch of fancy feminists that
run around saying 'give me equal rights' and who
have nothing else to do.
"The women's movement is a fundamental
movement of American democracy and the need
to fulfill what they said 202 years ago in the declara
tion."
Abzug said that the movement has a "big re
sponsibility to reach women in the home who feel
terribly threatened" by possible change.
"They're going to have the right to stay in the

house. That's what the whole thing is all about —
freedom of choice.
"Obviously, we can't wrench people out of their
homes. Yet there are people who believe that."
The resistance to the women's movement and
the Equal Rights Amendment in particular, is due
to the fact that "those in power don't want to yield
or share their power," Abzug said.
Abzug, who left a seat in the House of Represen
tatives to run in an unsuccessful bid for a seat in
the all-male U.S. Senate in 1976, said, "A stag
senate means a stag nation."
"We (women) are not supposed to try and get in
to the top levels of institutions." There are lots of
women at the lower levels, but at the top the
resistence is strong, she added.
Abzug said that minority women from "all walks
of life" need to have greater representation in
Congress.
"There's no point in substituting an all-male
white elitist power structure for an all-female
white elitist power structure," she said.
