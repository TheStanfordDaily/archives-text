Dick Gregory, comedian, human rights ac
tivist, and writer spoke at Memorial Auditorium
last night, where he said that young people have a
big job ahead of them in this country.
Gregory, in a speech primarily sponsored by the
ASSU Speakers Bureau and the Stanford chapter
of the NAACP, said that college should not be used
as a place to hide insecurities and that problems
must be dealt with.
According to Gregory colleges should exist to
satisfy the needs of students and should teach
people how to live and not only how to make a
living.
Gregory said we are born in a racist society and
cannot escape its influences. People must be
taught how to deal with racism and sexism, said
Gregory. He said he wonders if young people
realize what power they have. "We can turn this
thing around," said Gregory.
He said this country is not a democratic society.
According to Gregory there needs to be a redis

tribution of resources since too few people hold a
high percentage of wealth.
Gregory said that freedom of speech in this
country is not a reality. "There is freedom of
speech as long as you are ridiculing the welfare
mother or poor folks," he said.
Gregory said the press in this country is not
asking enough basic questions. "When will the
press function as a free press in a free democratic
society?" said Gregory.
The press must reveal the conspiracies that go
on in this country and expose the contradictions of
the government, according to Gregory. He said it
was ironic that unemployment is at its highest
while drugs run rampant. "Everybody can find the
reefer man except the police," said Gregory.
"Something is wrong with this nation," said
Gregory. He said that automobile accidents,
homicides, cancer, drugs and suicide are the top
killers of young people in this country.
Gregory said that the natural resources of Africa
are very important during these times. Black

people in this country have a definite relationship
with Africa and must show love, compassion and
understanding to the peoples' struggle there, he
said.
Gregory added that human beings are impor
tant. "Somewhere you have to care," said Greg
ory. He said that students have to reach down and
find strength to stand up for truth and what is
right.
He added there is a lot of wealth in this country
but there is also pfenty of poverty.
Gregory, a vegetarian and a believer in nonvio
lence, urged all to fast at least one day a week,
suggesting Friday to Saturday, to foster a spiritual
force to oppose the CIA and FBI.
"As I leave you it's not about hate or revenge.
It's about love and understanding," he said. "Until
America becomes more spiritual I ain't never
cared what this nation thought about me."
Gregory said there is a "God force" that can
keep you alive.
