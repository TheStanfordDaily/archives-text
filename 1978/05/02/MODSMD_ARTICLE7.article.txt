# Committee service more than tool for advancement

Robert Hamrdla

Having read the article "University
committees* looking into every
thing" (Daily, April 27), I hasten to
write you about some unfortunate
errors and perhaps unforeseen con
sequences of statements in it.
First, the article notes that "about
46 University committees, each con
sisting of students, faculty and trus
tees" exist. I suspect you are quite
well aware that trustees do not in fact
serve on University committees, but
that another constituency not men
tioned in the article is generally rep
resented on them: administrative
staff.
Second, I am dismayed to read that
"trustee committees are also popu
lar, although these student positions
are less effective." I am curious
about the meaning of "effective."
Having observed many meetings of
committees of the Board of Trustees
this year, I would tend to compli
ment the student members on those
committees on their effectiveness.
Many of them have been
exemplary in "doing their
homework," in talking with staff and
others to gain important
background, and in asking well con
sidered questions during the meet
ings. Without establishment of
criteria for applying the word, there
is no obvious basis for the article's
assertion.
Perpetuating adversary myth
Third, it is even more dismaying
and downright discouraging to read
that "trustee committees are pre
stigious, but as far as being an impor
tant tool for students to use, they're
nothing." This remark is especially
unfortunate because it reinforces the
notion that all students seeking posi
tions on committees should view
that process as a means to attaining
some pre-planned goal (which, the
article implies somewhat darkly and
forebodingly, is obviously some
thing to which all other groups
within the University are automati
cally opposed).
If any one problem has contri
buted to raising barriers to open and
honest communication between
students and other members of
committees, it is this vague supposi
tion that students must be in an ad
versary relationship with everyone
else to be "effective." The article's
greatest disservice to the entire

community is that it perpetuates that
expectation.
No opposition as a block
Having served on many University
committees and subcommittees, I
have never observed a vote in which
the students as a block opposed the
other constituencies as a block.
Committees' decisions are more
often a product of discussion, com
promise and eventual consensus of
all members.
Even in the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility the three
students have voted differently from
time to time. Effectiveness in serving
on a committee stems from the abil
ity — and the willingness — to listen
to others' points of view, to probe,
and to avoid dogmatic stances which
close communication from the be
ginning. In that sense, students' par
ticipation on any committee can be
effective or ineffective, and the ef
fectiveness need not be determined
in so syllogistic a way as the article
would have us believe.
Clarifying term lengths
Fourth, the last paragraph of the
article notes that all student mem
bers of committees serve one year; it
is important that t'lis fact be noted
since many persons in the commun
ity are confused about that. The last
sentence, however, asserts that "fa
culty, administrators and trustees,
who are selected by the Faculty Se
nate, usually serve two years." There
are four major errors in this sen
tence.
— Faculty usually serve three
years.
— Faculty members of committees
are not selected by the Faculty Se
nate, but rather nominated by the
Faculty Senate's Committee on
Committees and appointed by the
president.
— Administrators are nominated
in a variety of ways — but not by the
Faculty Senate — and appointed by
the president.
— As noted above, trustees do not
serve on University committees and,
therefore, are not selected by the Fa
culty Senate.
Effectiveness judged
As chairman this year of the Uni
versity's Committee on Parking and
Transportation, I have had ample
opportunity to see just how effective
student members can be. The four

students who have served on the
committee have been without excep
tion loyal in their attendance, articu
late in their questions, knowledge
able in discussion, and willing to
offer their time outside of the actual
meetings. That is effectiveness, for
they have gained the respect of all
the committee's members — and
that's a sine qua non on which "ef
fectiveness" is based. Since this arti
cle offers me the opportunity to do
so, let me command them publicly:
Kevin Calegari, Tom Newell, Mark
Sexton and Chuck Sword.
I hope that students who read the
article which prompted this re
sponse will take time to contemplate
these points, and I would like to en
courage all students to consider ap
plying for service on committees
without feeling that committees are
necessarily "tools" to be used only
for the accomplishment of a specific
objective. Service on a committee is
one of the best ways to learn more
about the operation of the Univer
sity, to have contact with diverse
groups of people, and to learn more
about oneself.

exemplary in "doing their
homework," in talking with staff and
others to gain important
background, and in asking well con
sidered questions during the meet
ings. Without establishment of
criteria for applying the word, there
is no obvious basis for the article's
assertion.
Perpetuating adversary myth
Third, it is even more dismaying
and downright discouraging to read
that "trustee committees are pre
stigious, but as far as being an impor
tant tool for students to use, they're
nothing." This remark is especially
unfortunate because it reinforces the
notion that all students seeking posi
tions on committees should view
that process as a means to attaining
some pre-planned goal (which, the
article implies somewhat darkly and
forebodingly, is obviously some
thing to which all other groups
within the University are automati
cally opposed).
If any one problem has contri
buted to raising barriers to open and
honest communication between
students and other members of
committees, it is this vague supposi
tion that students must be in an ad
versary relationship with everyone
else to be "effective." The article's
greatest disservice to the entire

community is that it perpetuates that
expectation.
No opposition as a block
Having served on many University
committees and subcommittees, I
have never observed a vote in which
the students as a block opposed the
other constituencies as a block.
Committees' decisions are more
often a product of discussion, com
promise and eventual consensus of
all members.
Even in the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility the three
students have voted differently from
time to time. Effectiveness in serving
on a committee stems from the abil
ity — and the willingness — to listen
to others' points of view, to probe,
and to avoid dogmatic stances which
close communication from the be
ginning. In that sense, students' par
ticipation on any committee can be
effective or ineffective, and the ef
fectiveness need not be determined
in so syllogistic a way as the article
would have us believe.
Clarifying term lengths
Fourth, the last paragraph of the
article notes that all student mem
bers of committees serve one year; it
is important that t'lis fact be noted
since many persons in the commun
ity are confused about that. The last
sentence, however, asserts that "fa
culty, administrators and trustees,
who are selected by the Faculty Se
nate, usually serve two years." There
are four major errors in this sen
tence.
— Faculty usually serve three
years.
— Faculty members of committees
are not selected by the Faculty Se
nate, but rather nominated by the
Faculty Senate's Committee on
Committees and appointed by the
president.
— Administrators are nominated
in a variety of ways — but not by the
Faculty Senate — and appointed by
the president.
— As noted above, trustees do not
serve on University committees and,
therefore, are not selected by the Fa
culty Senate.
Effectiveness judged
As chairman this year of the Uni
versity's Committee on Parking and
Transportation, I have had ample
opportunity to see just how effective
student members can be. The four

students who have served on the
committee have been without excep
tion loyal in their attendance, articu
late in their questions, knowledge
able in discussion, and willing to
offer their time outside of the actual
meetings. That is effectiveness, for
they have gained the respect of all
the committee's members — and
that's a sine qua non on which "ef
fectiveness" is based. Since this arti
cle offers me the opportunity to do
so, let me command them publicly:
Kevin Calegari, Tom Newell, Mark
Sexton and Chuck Sword.
I hope that students who read the
article which prompted this re
sponse will take time to contemplate
these points, and I would like to en
courage all students to consider ap
plying for service on committees
without feeling that committees are
necessarily "tools" to be used only
for the accomplishment of a specific
objective. Service on a committee is
one of the best ways to learn more
about the operation of the Univer
sity, to have contact with diverse
groups of people, and to learn more
about oneself.

Having read the article "University
committees* looking into every
thing" (Daily, April 27), I hasten to
write you about some unfortunate
errors and perhaps unforeseen con
sequences of statements in it.
First, the article notes that "about
46 University committees, each con
sisting of students, faculty and trus
tees" exist. I suspect you are quite
well aware that trustees do not in fact
serve on University committees, but
that another constituency not men
tioned in the article is generally rep
resented on them: administrative
staff.
Second, I am dismayed to read that
"trustee committees are also popu
lar, although these student positions
are less effective." I am curious
about the meaning of "effective."
Having observed many meetings of
committees of the Board of Trustees
this year, I would tend to compli
ment the student members on those
committees on their effectiveness.
Many of them have been
exemplary in "doing their
homework," in talking with staff and
others to gain important
background, and in asking well con
sidered questions during the meet
ings. Without establishment of
criteria for applying the word, there
