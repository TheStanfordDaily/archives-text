# Berk defeated in USE election by wide margin
## 
### Bill Burger 
The established order of United
Stanford Employees (USE) was dealt a
fatal blow yesterday as Bob Britton
defeated long-time union leader Jim
Berk in the race for union president
by a 452-172 margin.
Britton's forces were elected to
each of the remaining four officer
positions and 11 of the 15 group rep
resentative spots to give the group a
16-person majority on the 21-person
USE Executive Committee.
Britton said the high voter turnout
was the "sign of a healthy union." He
said the union must now "heal the
split" and "start planning for the con
tract (future contract negotiations
with the University)."
Berk said last night he had "no
thing appropriate" to say and re
fused further comment.
The results of the election were
announced after 11 last night. The
monthly membership meeting
ended shortly before 8 p.m. and was
adjourned until 10 p.m. to await the
final vote totals. The ballot counting
was overseen by California State
Conciliators to insure accufacy and
security.
During the three hour evening
meeting, a resolution was passed di
recting the new president and Execu
tive Committee to undertake the
termination of Berk as a USE
employee.
The motion introducing this resol
ution brought forth many reactions
from the members on Berk's past
performance and future value to the

union.
Several members whose grie
vances against the University had
been handled by Berk rose to his de
fense while others argued he was no
longer valuable to the union.
Don Ramsay warned the members
of a "personality cult" developed
around Berk. "The strength of the
union is people, not Berk," Ramsay
said.
Mac Dillard said Berk had been a
"good element" at one time for the
union but was nowa "bad element."
Dave Walker said the anti-Berk
forces seek a "permanent" ouster of
Berk. He said the group would not
"reveal strategy" as to the procedure
for his termination.
In the assistant president race,
write-in candidate Bill Reynolds de
feated Chuck Lacy, 334-190. Mike
Harris defeated former president
Anne Schlagenhaft for secretary,
452-163. Karl Schroeder defeated
Ron Seefred, 454-164, in the trea
surer's race and Sylvia Harris beat
Bob Buker, 456-156, in the reporter's
contest.
Schlagenhaft said she hoped the
Britton slate can "live up to its cam
paign statements." She added she
has "grave doubts" about the effec
tive performance of the group.
Schlagenhaft, as past president,
has voting privileges on the union's
Executive Committee.
During the meeting, criticism of
the Berk forces arose over the mail
ing of alleged campaign literature
through the U.S. Postal Service's

bulk rate system.
Several members said the mailing
of campaign literature through bulk
rate mail might be illegal and the un
ion's bulk rate permit might thus be
endangered by the mailing.
Schlagenhaft said Berk, in his
duties as secretary, had authorized
the mailing.
A resolution ordering the new
Executive Committee to look into the
possible violation passed over
whelmingly.
A constitutional amendment pre
venting University supervisors from
holding union membership passed
unofficially yesterday by a 298-9b
vote. In addition, a new bylaw chang
ing the membership meetings from
the first to the second Tuesday of
each month was passed.
Berk, a former union president,
has been an influential USE leader
since the union's formation in the
early '70s.
Britton called Berk's past contribu
tions to the union "valuable" but
added that "it has become apparent
that he cannot carry the union
singlehandedly."
The close of the election brings to
a partial end the internal strife in the
union which has dominated mem
bership meetings and union litera
ture for months.
While most members say they
hope the union can get on with its
business now, several still say they
have doubts about the finality of the
Berk ouster.

Britton's forces were elected to
each of the remaining four officer
positions and 11 of the 15 group rep
resentative spots to give the group a
16-person majority on the 21-person
USE Executive Committee.
Britton said the high voter turnout
was the "sign of a healthy union." He
said the union must now "heal the
split" and "start planning for the con
tract (future contract negotiations
with the University)."
Berk said last night he had "no
thing appropriate" to say and re
fused further comment.
The results of the election were
announced after 11 last night. The
monthly membership meeting
ended shortly before 8 p.m. and was
adjourned until 10 p.m. to await the
final vote totals. The ballot counting
was overseen by California State
Conciliators to insure accufacy and
security.
During the three hour evening
meeting, a resolution was passed di
recting the new president and Execu
tive Committee to undertake the
termination of Berk as a USE
employee.
The motion introducing this resol
ution brought forth many reactions
from the members on Berk's past
performance and future value to the

union.
Several members whose grie
vances against the University had
been handled by Berk rose to his de
fense while others argued he was no
longer valuable to the union.
Don Ramsay warned the members
of a "personality cult" developed
around Berk. "The strength of the
union is people, not Berk," Ramsay
said.
Mac Dillard said Berk had been a
"good element" at one time for the
union but was nowa "bad element."
Dave Walker said the anti-Berk
forces seek a "permanent" ouster of
Berk. He said the group would not
"reveal strategy" as to the procedure
for his termination.
In the assistant president race,
write-in candidate Bill Reynolds de
feated Chuck Lacy, 334-190. Mike
Harris defeated former president
Anne Schlagenhaft for secretary,
452-163. Karl Schroeder defeated
Ron Seefred, 454-164, in the trea
surer's race and Sylvia Harris beat
Bob Buker, 456-156, in the reporter's
contest.
Schlagenhaft said she hoped the
Britton slate can "live up to its cam
paign statements." She added she
has "grave doubts" about the effec
tive performance of the group.
Schlagenhaft, as past president,
has voting privileges on the union's
Executive Committee.
During the meeting, criticism of
the Berk forces arose over the mail
ing of alleged campaign literature
through the U.S. Postal Service's

bulk rate system.
Several members said the mailing
of campaign literature through bulk
rate mail might be illegal and the un
ion's bulk rate permit might thus be
endangered by the mailing.
Schlagenhaft said Berk, in his
duties as secretary, had authorized
the mailing.
A resolution ordering the new
Executive Committee to look into the
possible violation passed over
whelmingly.
A constitutional amendment pre
venting University supervisors from
holding union membership passed
unofficially yesterday by a 298-9b
vote. In addition, a new bylaw chang
ing the membership meetings from
the first to the second Tuesday of
each month was passed.
Berk, a former union president,
has been an influential USE leader
since the union's formation in the
early '70s.
Britton called Berk's past contribu
tions to the union "valuable" but
added that "it has become apparent
that he cannot carry the union
singlehandedly."
The close of the election brings to
a partial end the internal strife in the
union which has dominated mem
bership meetings and union litera
ture for months.
While most members say they
hope the union can get on with its
business now, several still say they
have doubts about the finality of the
Berk ouster.
