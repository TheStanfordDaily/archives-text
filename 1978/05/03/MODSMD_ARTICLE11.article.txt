## Boycott urged for impact 
### 
Funk, Whitson

In light of the Board of Trustees' recent rejection of
the CIR proxy recommendations, we feel that it is a
crucial timeforstudents to speak out and makeit known
to the University that their opinions are important and
cannot be ignored in decisions regarding University in
vestment policy. To this end, we urge all students to
boycott all University fund raising drives; and more
specifically, we urge seniors to boycott the Senior
Pledge Program. A University that does not value or seek
the support of its students should not expect or enjoy
the support of those same students when they become
alumni.
We commend SCRIP on the scope and the impact of
its activities in working for divestiture. At the same time,
we feel that it is important for the University trustees and
administration to realize that the people involved in
SCRIP are not the only members of the community who
are willing to take an active part in voicing their concern
over University investment policy. Even those students
who do not support total divestiture by the University
must feel a certain outrage in the wake of the trustees'
rejection of three of the five CIR recommendations.
President Richard Lyman, speaking in support of the
trustees' decisions, was reported (Daily, April 26) as stat
ing that it is "easier for students to deal with the question
of divestment in an abstract sense than it is for trustees
who must feel the burden of responsibility for managing
the endowment."
Even if one accepts this premise as true, the fact re
mains that the recommendations which the trustees re
jected in their April 25 meeting were not put forth by
students, but were put forth by a committee of faculty,
alumni, staff and students appointed by Lyman — a
selected committee that clearly did not deliberate on the
question of divestment in "an abstract sense." The CIR
approached the problem with a clear perception of the
responsibility of their task and formulated their deci-

sions only after having carefully studied the issues. This
approach was clearly not matched by the trustees' in its
thoroughness.
The trustees' "no" decision on the resolution to inves
tigate Texaco's sale of oil to Rhodesia in violation of a UN
embargo especially calls into question the real motivat
ing force behind all three of the trustees' "no" votes.
One cannot help but wonder if the real tiurden that is
weighing down the trustees in their decision stems not
from their responsibilities as trustees managing the en
dowment, but rather from their responsibilities and in
terests as leaders in corporate management.
If the recommendations of the CIR mean nothing — if
the recent ASSU vote of 61 per cent in favor of-with
drawal means nothing — if Lyman speaks with concern
over "the difference of perceptions between the trustee
point of view and the campus point of view" only be
cause "it could be damaging to the system we've tried to
set up here" (Daily, April 26) — then perhaps it is timefor
us to make our feelings and power known to the Univer
sity in terms that it obviously appreciates and under
stands: cold hard cash.
A boycott of all University fund raising drives would
show the administration not only that we, as students*
are sincerely committed to the establishment of a re
sponsible investment policy in South Africa, but also
that we, as alumni, will continue to work toward this
goal.
We urge you to send in your Senior Pledge cards or to
send in letters withdrawing your pledges to 301 Encina,
indicating your intention to boycott all University fund
raising activities until such time as the administration
and the trustees see fit to adopt a responsive and re
sponsible investment policy in South Africa.
