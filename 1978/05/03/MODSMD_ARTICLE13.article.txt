More harm than good
Angela Davis' recent address to the
University students disturbed me. I
am white, female, 27 years old. I am
anti-racist, anti-sexist, and of her
college-educated generation. I now
find myself frustrated by her words.
"This is the new racism," she said,
"the illusion that racism has been
overcome. And it is an illusion. We
are further from freedom in 1978
than we were in 1968." I fail to under
stand how this can be. What does she
use to measure even minimal suc
cess? How does she define freedom?
As a writer for an affirmative action
publication, I am concerned with the
progress toward equality for all un
derrepresented minorities, includ
ing of course blacks and women.
I agree that there have been set
backs for minorities, the Bakke case
being one vital example. But what of
all the cases of discriminatory
charges in recent years which have
been decided overwhelmingly in
favor of minorities. She must con
cede that legislation is backing the

minority struggle for equality in
every way.
I also agree that "the movement is
certainly not dead," nor will it be as
long as injustice exists. But is she
furthering the movement with
charges of "conspiracy" and "new
racism," or is she discouraging us by
discrediting all the work of the past
10 years?
If "capitalists" and "powerhol
ders" are to be accused of a racist
conspiracy when they support non
racist policies and then publicize
their actions, what are they to do to
be considered non-racist in her
view? She may think me naive or
worse, but I truly do not understand.
As one of the "powerholders"
now, both as a University educator
and an internationally known ac
tivist, what we need from her is en
couragement and direction, not
condemnation of well-intentioned
efforts, and inflamatory accusations
of latent fascism.
