# Opposing viewpoints on role of sororities here
## Feminists, sorority women see sisterhood differently 
### Erica Frassinelli 
Sororities have returned to
Stanford by way of an unex
pected agent: the woman's
movement.
Equal housing for women
here means giving women the
same choices of housing af
forded to men. Therefore the
continuing existence of frater
nities predicated the
reinstatement of sororities.
According to this reasoning,
the Board of Trustees voted last
December to lift the 1944 ban
on sororities. Their action
complied with the federal
anti-discrimination legislation
under Title Nine of the Educa
tional Amendments of 1972.
In the name of equality for
women, the sororities are
back. But in 1944 it was the ex
treme inequalities imposed by
the Greek system upon women
that led to the ban.
Enrollment increase
Ann Van Wagner Robison, a
member of a national sorority
here in the early 1930'5, attri
butes the heightened competi
tion for the sorority places to
the increase in women's en
rollment from 500 to 1200 dur
ing the '30s. At that time there
were approximately 270 spaces
in the nine sororities and the
administration opposed the
addition of any new sororities.
The sorority system was very
selective and excluded many
people from social activities.
Robison described the disap
pointment of women not
asked to join sororities as

"heart-breaking." She recalled
that, "The sororities were the
centers of social life, and the
girls in those days were much
more limited in theirchoices of
ways to live."
Stanford had no coed dorms
at that time. All the women not
living in the sororities on the
Row lived in Lagunita and Ro
ble.
Snobbishness
Robison said that "there did
tend to be a certain amount of
snobbishness in the
sororities." Many women not
living in a sorority were not in
cluded in many campus ac
tivities. This discrimination of
women by other women could
have been alleviated if the
sororities had expanded to
take in more women, stated
Robison.
Although sororities may
have troubled the whole of
University life, Robison noted
the beneficial effects on the
individual women.
"Living in a sorority was lots
of fun; it was like a large family.
Members of the sororities felt
more a part of the University,"
she said.
Some women who didn't
seek out the sisterhood of the
sorority were often
"independent-minded" wo
men, according to Robison.
Those independent-minded
women of the '30s may be the
grandmothers of today's
feminists.
Like the feminists at Stanford
today, they had no desire to

join sororities. Something in
trinsic in the definition of
sorority seems to make
feminists balk at their mention.
Joline Esparza, a resident of
Simone de Beauvoir House
(formerly Androgyny),
explained herobjections to the
ideology behind sororities:
"By definition I thinkof a soror
ity as a social bond, not a per
sonal one. This social bond
necessitates competition for
the goals of society."
Coals
The goals of a materialistic
society are not something the
feminists strive to attain. Mike
Shuman, also of Simone de
Beauvoir House, objected to
sororities because they do not
reevaluate sex roles.
"The general social currents
of sororities perpetuate de
pendency, passivity and
domesticity. The problem is
that sororities do not question
these social currents (such as
sex roles), but reinforce the
behaviors of society," he
stated.
Shuman said he sees
sororities as regressive move
ments within the women's
movement.
Sorority women disagree
with Shuman and view the
sorority as a means to com
plement academic life.
Cindy Hadden, president
of the Inter-Sorority Council,
described the sorority as "a
woman's support group." She
said that many of the goals of

sororities are compatible with
those of feminism.
"Sororities are preparing
women for leadership, posi
tions of responsibility, and
teaching," said Hadden. She
said that the sororities will be
dealing with relevant issues
such as energy conservation
and women's rights; trying to
be open to both sides of any
issue.
Janice Kimball, who was the
first sorority pledge here, ag
reed that sorority activities are
instrumental in developing
strong individual characters.
Most central to the sorority ex
perience is the forming of
strong bonds of friendship,
developing leadership qual
ities, learning to meet and
work with people and having
fun, according to Kimball.
Activities
Besides offering women a
new way to make friendships,
the sororities want to take part
in campus service, and educa
tional and philanthropic ac
tivities, said Kimball.
Kimball emphasized that the
sororities are trying to avoid
the stereotype of the sorority
woman. "People are going into
(the sorority) with the attitude
that they want to be diffe
rent," stated Kimball.
Kimball said the sororities
want to have activities with
coed dorms, not just frater
nities.
Feminists agree that strong
personal friendships between
women are important. But

where they disagree with the
sororities is the grounds for the
bonds of friendship.
One student here who
works with feminist organiza
tions nationwide and on cam
pus said that the ideal of sister
hood between women is good,
but sororities will never unite
all women because they are a
selected group of women shar
ing sisterhood. They tend to
divide women because they
are elitist.
"The basic ideals of sister

hood, working together for so
cial change, and woman's sup
port that are behind sororities
have a lot of potential. This po
tential cannot be realized full
scale because sororities are
very elitist, and they subordi
nate themselves to the frater
nities," she said.
Dawn Todd, a junior af
filiated with feminist campus
organizations, said she sees a
basic difference between the
goals of the sororities and the
feminists.

"Feminist groups strive to
actively unite women from all
socio-economic, ethnic, re
ligious and racial
backgrounds," she said.
Todd doesn't see this as the
ultimate goal of sororities.
To some extent the first
sorority rush supported Todd'?
assertion. Of the 138 women
offered bids to join, most were
freshmen and sophomores.
Few minority women attended
the rush activities or joined
sororities.


Sorority rush, which concluded April 22, gave stu
dents an opportunity to see what sororities are
really like. However, sororities have drawn a vari-

ety of reactions from the campus as to their neec
and purpose.

the goals of society."
Coals
The goals of a materialistic
society are not something the
feminists strive to attain. Mike
Shuman, also of Simone de
Beauvoir House, objected to
sororities because they do not
reevaluate sex roles.
"The general social currents
of sororities perpetuate de
pendency, passivity and
domesticity. The problem is
that sororities do not question
these social currents (such as
sex roles), but reinforce the
behaviors of society," he
stated.
Shuman said he sees
sororities as regressive move
ments within the women's
movement.
Sorority women disagree
with Shuman and view the
sorority as a means to com
plement academic life.
Cindy Hadden, president
of the Inter-Sorority Council,
described the sorority as "a
woman's support group." She
said that many of the goals of

sororities are compatible with
those of feminism.
"Sororities are preparing
women for leadership, posi
tions of responsibility, and
teaching," said Hadden. She
said that the sororities will be
dealing with relevant issues
such as energy conservation
and women's rights; trying to
be open to both sides of any
issue.
Janice Kimball, who was the
first sorority pledge here, ag
reed that sorority activities are
instrumental in developing
strong individual characters.
Most central to the sorority ex
perience is the forming of
strong bonds of friendship,
developing leadership qual
ities, learning to meet and
work with people and having
fun, according to Kimball.
Activities
Besides offering women a
new way to make friendships,
the sororities want to take part
in campus service, and educa
tional and philanthropic ac
tivities, said Kimball.
Kimball emphasized that the
sororities are trying to avoid
the stereotype of the sorority
woman. "People are going into
(the sorority) with the attitude
that they want to be diffe
rent," stated Kimball.
Kimball said the sororities
want to have activities with
coed dorms, not just frater
nities.
Feminists agree that strong
personal friendships between
women are important. But

where they disagree with the
sororities is the grounds for the
bonds of friendship.
One student here who
works with feminist organiza
tions nationwide and on cam
pus said that the ideal of sister
hood between women is good,
but sororities will never unite
all women because they are a
selected group of women shar
ing sisterhood. They tend to
divide women because they
are elitist.
"The basic ideals of sister

hood, working together for so
cial change, and woman's sup
port that are behind sororities
have a lot of potential. This po
tential cannot be realized full
scale because sororities are
very elitist, and they subordi
nate themselves to the frater
nities," she said.
Dawn Todd, a junior af
filiated with feminist campus
organizations, said she sees a
basic difference between the
goals of the sororities and the
feminists.

"Feminist groups strive to
actively unite women from all
socio-economic, ethnic, re
ligious and racial
backgrounds," she said.
Todd doesn't see this as the
ultimate goal of sororities.
To some extent the first
sorority rush supported Todd'?
assertion. Of the 138 women
offered bids to join, most were
freshmen and sophomores.
Few minority women attended
the rush activities or joined
sororities.


Sorority rush, which concluded April 22, gave stu
dents an opportunity to see what sororities are
really like. However, sororities have drawn a vari-

â€”Daily photo by Bill Newcomt
ety of reactions from the campus as to their neec
and purpose.
Sororities have returned to
Stanford by way of an unex
pected agent: the woman's
movement.
Equal housing for women
here means giving women the
same choices of housing af
forded to men. Therefore the
continuing existence of frater
nities predicated the
reinstatement of sororities.
According to this reasoning,
the Board of Trustees voted last
December to lift the 1944 ban
on sororities. Their action
complied with the federal
anti-discrimination legislation
under Title Nine of the Educa
tional Amendments of 1972.
In the name of equality for
women, the sororities are
back. But in 1944 it was the ex
treme inequalities imposed by
the Greek system upon women
that led to the ban.
Enrollment increase
Ann Van Wagner Robison, a
member of a national sorority
here in the early 1930'5, attri
butes the heightened competi
tion for the sorority places to
the increase in women's en
rollment from 500 to 1200 dur
ing the '30s. At that time there
were approximately 270 spaces
in the nine sororities and the
administration opposed the
addition of any new sororities.
The sorority system was very
selective and excluded many
people from social activities.
Robison described the disap
pointment of women not
asked to join sororities as

"heart-breaking." She recalled
that, "The sororities were the
centers of social life, and the
girls in those days were much
more limited in theirchoices of
ways to live."
Stanford had no coed dorms
at that time. All the women not
living in the sororities on the
Row lived in Lagunita and Ro
ble.
Snobbishness
Robison said that "there did
tend to be a certain amount of
snobbishness in the
sororities." Many women not
living in a sorority were not in
cluded in many campus ac
tivities. This discrimination of
women by other women could
have been alleviated if the
sororities had expanded to
take in more women, stated
Robison.
Although sororities may
have troubled the whole of
University life, Robison noted
the beneficial effects on the
individual women.
"Living in a sorority was lots
of fun; it was like a large family.
Members of the sororities felt
more a part of the University,"
she said.
Some women who didn't
seek out the sisterhood of the
sorority were often
"independent-minded" wo
men, according to Robison.
Those independent-minded
women of the '30s may be the
grandmothers of today's
feminists.
Like the feminists at Stanford
today, they had no desire to

join sororities. Something in
trinsic in the definition of
sorority seems to make
feminists balk at their mention.
Joline Esparza, a resident of
Simone de Beauvoir House
(formerly Androgyny),
explained herobjections to the
ideology behind sororities:
"By definition I thinkof a soror
ity as a social bond, not a per
sonal one. This social bond
necessitates competition for
the goals of society."
