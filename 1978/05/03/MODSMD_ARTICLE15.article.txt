# Free noon concerts for publicity
## Lively Arts sponsors concerts 
### Steve Penico 
As part of their "Student Awareness
Campaign," the Lively Arts at Stanford will
sponsor noon concerts atTresidder Union
today and tomorrow, featuring Reilly &
Maloney, The Kronos Quartet and The
Stanford Jazz Band. Free popcorn, flow
ers, balloons and frisbees will be pro
vided.
According to Vicky Holt, Director of the
Lively Arts Program, "We want to let stu
dents know that the Lively Arts Series
brings to campus some of the world's
finest performers at exceptionally low cost
to students, $3.50 a ticket.
"And we don't believe in putting stu
dents in poorly situated 'student sections.'

If you buy tickets early in the season, you
can have the best seats in the house," Holt
said.
Marilee Unruh, student organizer of the
campaign, said she feels most students
don't know much about the Lively Arts.
"Many don't even know we exist," she
said, "and those who do tend to think we
sponsor only stuffy concerts for faculty. In
fact, the series was created specifically for
the benefit of students. It has a wide vari
ety of dance, classical music, acting, and
this coming year, jazz.
"In the past several years we've also had
a lot of success with free 'lecture
demonstrations' in which artists show
finer points that they work on and with

'mini-concerts' in which artists perform
for individual dorms on campus," she
said.
Next season's 35 performances include
playwrite Edward Albee directing two of
his one-act plays, "The Zoo Story" and
"The American Dream," as well as the Juil
liard and the Tokyo String Quartets, the
Berlin Philharmonic Octet, Billy Taylor's
jazz trio, Houle & Wilbaux â€” Mimes, and
the world-renowned dance troups,
Pilobolus and Aman.
"By the time the Student Awareness
Drive is over," said Unruh, "we hope to
have convinced some students that you
don't have to go to San Francisco to see
good performing arts."
