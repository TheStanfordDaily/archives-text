# Three Cards chosen in first two rounds
## Lofton picked sixth by Green Bay; King goes to Giants; Miami takes Benjamin 
### David Georgette 
The Big Apple, the Orange
Bowl and a climate where
snowballs abound each awaits
one of three Stanford football
players this coming season as a
result of yesterday's opening
rounds of the National Football
League's annual draft.
Wide receiver james Lofton
became the sixth pick of the
first round when Green Bay
selected him. Offensive tackle
Gordon King was the next Car
dinal to be taken, going as the
10th choice of the draft to the
New York Giants.
Quarterback Guy Benjamin
was the third Card taken, going
to Miami in the second round
as the Dolphins' first choice of
the draft. Benjamin was the
third of this year's top quarter
backs to be drafted, with
Tampa Bay taking Grambling's
Doug Williams in the first
round and New England grab

bing Matt Cavanaugh of Pitt
right before Benjamin was ta
ken.
Though all three Cards were
not drafted as high as most of
the observers of the draft had
predicted as possible, Lofton
was just one pick after what
had been anticipated.
Buffalo, drafting fifth, chose
running back Terry Miller of
Oklahoma State instead of Lof
ton. King, mentioned as a pos
sible choice in the top five, had
to wait until the Giants took
him 10th.
"There was a little bit of sur
prise. I went through a lot of
possibilities about who would

take me, and the latest I came
up with was Seattle and ninth.
I'm happy to have it over,
though," said King.
"Being in the top 10 is good,
however. That's where people
take a long hard look at you,"
said the new 6-foot-6, 272 lb.
Giant.
Benjamin, though, said he
wasn't surprised that he lasted
as long as he did. "Bill (Walsh)
had told me it's tough to judge
quarterbacks," said Benjamin.
"I was prepared for it."
Good outlook
Though the three weren't
taken as high as had been
hoped, the results for them

could turn out for the better.
According to attorney Leigh
Steinberg, who is representing
King and Benjamin, the exact
order of who is taken in the
first round is not important.
"That player is still the first
choice of that team," he said.
For Lofton, playing with
Green Bay offers him the op
portunity to make an impact in
a division that does not have
many offensive stars. As forthe
weather, the Los Angeles na
tive said, "It's cold in a lot of
places."
Going to the smallest town in
the NFL will be a change for
Lofton, also. "It'll be different

being pro — living up to the
expectations of the fans and
the press. I know when I'm
doing well and when I'm not. I
think I'm the best judge of
that."
Becoming a first round
choice after only one season as
a starter gives a good indica
tion of what kind of player Lof
ton can be. "It either says a lot
about me and coach Walsh,"
the 6-2,187 receiver said, "or it
says a little about coach (Jack)
Christiansen (the Cards'
former coach)."
"I think New York is going to
be a good opportunity," said
King. "The coaching staff
seems to be good. There's a
possibility they could be a con
tending team soon, and there's
the opportunity to grow with
them."
Steinberg added, "The ef
fects of playing sports in New
York cannot be exaggerated."
As for the cold weather that
King can expect to encounter
late in the season in New York,
the tackle said, "I believe you
should play football out in the
elements. And I don't have to
handle the ball since I play a
position where all I have to do
is use my body."
Starting already
King will be going back to
New York within the next few
days fora physical examination
Sunday. Lofton will be in
Green Bay early next week, and
Benjamin will be spending to
morrow through Sunday in
Miami for some running and
weighlifting tests
"I was really deep down in
side hoping for a situation like
this," said Benjamin. "It would
have been unfortunate to get
drafted by a team with no of
fensive line and no receivers. I
know (Don) Shula's a darn
coach. I think there's
very few teams where I could
be in a better situation."
Benjamin said when he and
Steinberg were discussing
which teams he would like to
be drafted by, Miami was at the
top of his list because of their

success, the climate and the
opportunity to play.
"They (the Dolphins) had
talked to Walsh and indicated
they were interested in a quar
terback, specifically me," said
Benjamin.
However, because the Dol
phins had traded their first
round choice to San Francisco
in the Delvin Williams deal,
Benjamin said he did not ex
pect to be around long enough
for Miami to get him.
The Dolphins' veteran Bob
Griese was the top quarterback
in the American Football Con
ference last year, and has a
capable backup in Don Strock.
But as Benjamin said, "They
must be planning something to

do with me to draft me first."
"By and large, I'm delighted
with the results of the draft,"
said Steinberg. "Both Guy and
Gordon were drafted by teams
they're excited about."
In terms of the size of con
tracts King and Benjamin could
expect to be getting, Steinberg
said, "The Giants have not
usually been extravagant, but
King should be well imbursed.
Obviously, a second rounder
receives less than a first roun
der, but Guy is a quarterback
and he's Miami's first pick."
Two other Cards — offensive
lineman Mark Hill and receiver
Bill Kellar — are expected to be
drafted in the remainder of the
draft today.

The Green Bay Packers hope Stanford's James Lofton will be able to
do this often — catch a pass on a way to a touchdown — for them
next year. Lofton was the sixth choice in yesterday's first round of the
pro draft.
