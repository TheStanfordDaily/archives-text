# National 'Sun Day'
## Celebration of solar potential 
### 
Washington (AP) — Solar energy:
Everybody's for it; nobody's against
it..
But solar energy has so much
going for it that optimists want an
all-out drive, on the scale of wartime
mobilization, to base the nation's
economy on energy drawn directly
or indirectly from the light and heat

of the sun.
From dawn's first light to darkness'
fall, the sun will be in the spotlight at
home and abroad today for the
celebration of "Sun Day," an effort
to focus national and international
attention on solar energy.
Broad support
The activities are organized by a
coalition of groups and are being
coordinated by Solar Action Inc., a
non-profit, Washington-based or
ganization that has its roots in such
similar public-interest events as
"Earth Day"and "Food Day."
The celebration has the support of
the Department of Energy and the
expected participation of President
Jimmy Carter, who will speak at the
Solar Energy Institute in Golden,
Colo.
Denis Hayes, a Stanford graduate,
who organized "Earth Day" in 1970 to
publicize the environmental move
ment and originated the idea of to
day's "Sun Day" demonstrations, is
one of the optimists.
"Federal policy has, in the past,
consistently discriminated against
those forms of energy that represent
our brightest hopes," he said.
"The real leadership is not to be
found in Washington,"he said, but
all over the country where com
panies, local governments and pri
vate citizens are building, encourag
ing and inventing new solar projects.
Government support
First lady Rosalynn Carter, Energy
Secretary James Schlesinger, the
president's consumer affairs assis
tant Esther Peterson, and officials of

14 agencies proclaimed the govern
ment's support of solar energy de
velopment yesterday and outlined
scores of federal projects.
But Hayes told them that all this
effort still is not enough.
"Solar supporters hoped to see the
direct solar energy budget dou
bled," said Hayes, referring to the
Carter administration's budget
proposals for fiscal 1979. "Instead, it
was cut 10 per cent ... A far more
ambitious solar energy program
must be designed."
In fact, administration officials say
a new emphasis on solar energy will
emerge in "Phase Two," the next
round of national energy policies to
be tentatively outlined this autumn
and proposed to Congress early next
year.
Solar energy uses
The sun's heat can be captured di
rectly to warm air, water or solid
materials to provide both space heat
ing and hot water for buildings.
Using ingenious heat-exchange de
vices it can even be turned against
itself to provide air conditioning.
Direct solar heat can also be used
for some industrial and agricultural
processes, such as drying crops.
In a millionth of a second, sunlight
can be converted into electricity by
using plates of silicon crystal that
look like paper-thin frosted glass
laced with ribbons of silver.
Or, it can be focused by a giant
mirror system to create steam, which
is used to spin a conventional electri
cal turbine.
