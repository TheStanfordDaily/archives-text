## Cards triumph Hinojosa sets walk standard 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Practice makes perfect and the Stanford baseball team is going
to need perfection or near-perfection this weekend when it faces
Pacific-8 powerhouse USC. That's what makes yesterday's 7-5
non-conference victory over the St. Mary's Gaels important.
The Cards, after establishing a 3-0 lead in the first inning, were
able to practice their offensive tactics that have fallen by the
wayside in recent outings. The team finally got a chance to play
its type of game.
Pepe Hinojosa practiced one of his finest skills at the plate —
drawing walks. Hinojosa collected three bases-on-balls to set the
NCAA record for career walks at 203.
The senior outfielder's 58th walk of the year broke Arizona
Wildcat Dave Stegman's 1973-76 career record of 202. Hinojosa
now needs only four walks to top the Stanford season record of 61
which he set two years ago.
Four Stanford pitchers exercised on the mound yesterday,
combining for a four-hitter against the Gaels. Rob Irwin, who
started the game for the Cards, picked up his fourth win of the
season against two losses, while Larry Kuhn was credited with the
save.
Ahead 3-0 in the seventh, Stanf6rd added four insurance runs
that turned out to be a good investment. Two of the runs came on
designated hitter Randy Wong's seventh homerun of the year,
after Hinojosa had boarded first on a walk.
Todd Ervin was responsible for the other two runs, singling to
center with two men down and the bags loaded.
St. Mary's answered in the bottom of the inning when three
Gaels reached base on walks and John Gibbons rapped a three
run triple. Gibbons then scored on a sacrifice fly. Two walks and
one infield single accounted for St. Mary's final run in the eighth
inning.
