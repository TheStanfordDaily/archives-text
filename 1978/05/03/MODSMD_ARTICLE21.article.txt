# Netters slowed in Ojai tourney

It was a weekend of outstanding indi
vidual efforts as the Cards won both dou
bles titles in the Ojai Intercollegiate Tennis
Tournament but Stanford could not mus
ter enough points in singles to win the
team titles. The men finished third while
the women took second.
Although the Cards finished five points
behind champion USC, it was much closer
than the score indicated. The Cards won
just two of eight singles matches, but four
of the losses came in three sets, all which
involved close tiebreakers.
"Four of our matches could have been
won on one point," said men'scoach Dick
Could. "Had we won those matches we
would have won the tournament. I don't
think we let down; if we did that's my fault
as coach. I think maybe in a couple of
matches we might have gone not fully
ready to play at the outset, but on the
whole we did not play that bad. It wasn't
our best effort of the year, but we ran into
a couple of players who were playing really
well. We're not that invincible that we can
win every match by just walking on the
court."
It was not a wasted weekend however,

as the Cards took first and second in the
doubles.
The ever dependable team of Matt
Mitchell and Perry Wright won the champ
ionship by defeating teammates John Rast
and Bill Maze 6-4, 7-6 in the finals. Rast and
Maze were a regular team last year but
with the addition of John McEnroe to the
Stanford lineup, the pair had split up.
The reunion was sweet as the duo
knocked off the No. 1-seeded 'team of
Robert Van't Hofand Chris Lewis of USC in
the,quarterfinals and the top-seeded team
of John Austin and Bruce Nichols of UCLA
in the semifinals.
The singles was highlighted for Stanford
by the outstanding play of Rast. After easily
winning his first round match 6-3, 6-0 over
Bob Greene of Cal, Rast played a solid
match against the tough Nichols, but
ended up on the short end of 7-6, 4-6, 6-4
score.
Women win
The women's team also took the dou
bles behind Diane Morrison and Susie
Hagey. The strong forehand of Hagey
combined with the incredibly tough volley
of Morrison to lead the two-time national
champions through the tournament with
out the loss of the set.

In the singles, though, the Cards' top
player Kathy Jordan did not lose a set in
advancing to the quarterfinals, but later
was forced to withdraw when she caught
the flu. Sister Barb Jordan also had no
trouble getting to the quarterfinals, but
then she was beaten by UCLA's Jean
Duvall, 6-3, 6-3, who just might be the top
player in the nation.
"Diane and Susie played really well.
They played the tournament two years ago
and didn't win it so it was good for them to
come back and win it," said women's
coach Ann Gould. "In our.singles we also
played well. It's a really tough assignment
for anybody to beat Duvall.
"Kathy looked like she had a good
chance of reaching the final. She had to
play Lindsay Morse who she's beat twice
this year and UCLA's No. 3 player Dana
Gilbert. It's just a tough break," said
Gould.
The men's team is in Pebble Beach for
the Cal State Tournament this week while
the women travel to Berkeley for the
Northern California Athletic Conference
Championships. The two teams reunite
Sunday on the Farm for an exhibition
against the Golden Gaters of World Team
Tennis in a benefit for women's sports.
