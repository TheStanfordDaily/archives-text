Arms sales may be rejected
Washington — There may be enough votes in a
House committee to reject President Jimmy Car
ter's proposed sales of war planes to three Mideast
countries despite predictions to the contrary by
the panel's chairman, a survey of lawmakers
showed yesterday.
Nineteen House members — a bare majority of
the 37-member House International Relations
Committee — said they will approve or are lean
ing in favor of a resolution against the sale of jet
fighters to Saudi Arabia unless Carter makes con
cessions for Israel.
The Carter administration wants to sell sophisti
cated, U.S.-made F-15 war planes to Saudi Arabia,
75 F-15s and 15 F-16s to Israel and 50 F-5s to Egypt —
a $4.8 billion deal.
A House or Senate vote against any one of the
three sales — the Saudi Arabian transaction, for
instance — would jeopardize the deal because
Carter has suggested he'll drop the sales if Con
gress takes such action.
Under congressional procedures a proposed
arms sale by the executive branch must be disap
proved by both houses within 30 calendar days of
the time the president sends it to Capitol Hill.
However, no specific congressional approval is
needed.
The Associated Press questioned each member
of the House committee, which began consider
ing the war planes deal on Monday.
At least half a dozen, including some who listed
themselves as being tentatively opposed to the
Saudi sale, said they would vote for it if Carter
makes concessions for Israel.
Gov't wants theft-proof autos
Washington — The Transportation Department,
leveling its sights primarily on joyriding thieves,
announced plans yesterday to require automobile
manufacturers to install anti-theft equipment be
ginning with 1981 models.
The devices include protected ignition wires to
prevent a car from being started without a key,
hood latches that can be released only from inside
the car and rounded door-lock mechanisms that
prevent a door from being opened by poking a
coat hangar through a window crack.
Many newer model automobiles already include
one or more of the protective systems that would
be required by the proposal, announced by the
department's National Highway Traffic Safety Ad
ministration.
The proposed changes would be effective be
ginning with 1981 model passenger cars and 1982
model multipurpose vehicles and trucks with a
gross vehicle weight of less than 10,000 pounds.
Gay rights bill approved
Sacramento — A bill banning job discrimination
against homosexuals was approved by its first state
Senate committee yesterday after California's
most prominent gay politician said equal rights for
homosexuals were inevitable.
"What is happening is the emergence of gay
political power," San Francisco Supervisor Harvey
Milk told the Senate Industrial Relations Commit
tee. "It's no longer a taboo subject.
. .Someday, whether this year or next year or
'10 years from now, gay people will be given the
'same rights."
J The bill, SB 2053 by Sen. Milton Marks (R-San
sFrancisco), passed on a 4-0 vote, the bare majority
■ needed. Several oppoents were absent when the
vote was taken. The bill next goes to the Senate
Finance Committee.
Only a day earlier, state Sen. John Briggs (R-

Fullerton) said he had enough signatures to place
on the November state ballot an initiative aimed at
removing openly homosexual teachers and gay
rights advocates from schools. Later this month,
the secretary of state's office will announce
whether the measure qualified.
Jury recommends death penalty
San Bernardino — A Superior Court jury decided
Monday that a man who confessed to slashing and
disemboweling two women last year should be
executed in California's gas chamber.
The jury of five men and seven women deliber
ated for less than a day before returning the deci
sion against 32-year-old Andrew Edward
Robertson of Colton. Formal sentencing by the
judge has not been scheduled.
It was the second time the death penalty had
been handed down in California since the state's
revised death penalty law was approved last Au
gust over Gov. jerry Brown's veto.
Last week, the same jury found Robertson guilty
of two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths
of Karen Ann Litzau, 20, of Enid, Okla., and Kim
berly Glowe, 19, of San Bernardino.
The jury decided the death penalty should be
imposed because the case fell under the required
special circumstances of being deliberate, pre
meditated and committed during a kidnap, rob
bery or rape.
Nuclear plant project blocked
San Francisco — The state Public Utilities Com
mission (PUC) yesterday effectively blocked, for
the moment, the controversial $2.3 billion Sun
desert nuclear power plant project south of
Blythe, near the California-Arizona border.
Taking a tough stance, the agency told the utility
it cannot expect the PUC to approve rate increases
to finance the project until after it is in operation.
As part of the 3-1 PUC vote, commissioner Wil
liam Symons issued an eight-page dissent that
said, in part:
"Today's order nails down the coffin lid on the
Sundesert power project for Southern California.
There is an irrational rush to kill Sundesert, yet
there is no reliable alternative to replace the elec
tricity that the people of Southern California will
need."
In case the utility is forced to abandon Sun
desert, it would have to look for other less costly
sources of power, including possible purchase of
electricity from Baja California.
Liberal group criticizes Brown
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown is tilting to
the right politically and doing great damage to
many liberal causes, according to a scathing report
issued yesterday by a liberal group.
Shirley Wechsler, executive director of the
Americans for Democratic Action's Southern
California chapter, said the chapter's report com
pared Brown rhetoric and action and found great
disparity.
"We expected so much of him. He gave us the
impression he would be an activist, liberal gover
nor" like his father, former Gov. Edmund G. "Pat"
Brown, said Wechsler in a telephone interview
from her Los Angeles office.
"He's not liberal, conservative or moderate.
He's a power politician."
Brown's campaign manager, Gray Davis, said,
"We have a fundamental philosophical quarrel
with the spokespersons of the Southern California
chapter of ADA. We don't want to raise taxes. The
ADA thinks we should."

Battle over copper firm begins
New York — Feisty stockholders, concerned
employees and dozens of reporters squeezed into
the annual meeting of Kennecott Copper Corp.
yesterday to witness the latest and most dramatic
battle in the war for control of the nation's largest
copper producer.
The jam-packed meeting was called to order just
minutes after a federal appeals court cleared the
way for a vote on whether the ailing firm's entire
17-member board of directors should be ousted
and replaced by a slate organized by a company
one-third Kennecott's size.
Curtiss-Wright Corp., a Woodwridge, N.J.-
based conglomerate led by T. Roland Berner,
began the takeover war about a month ago by
seeking the proxies of other stockholders. If
Curtiss-Wright, which itself owns 9.9 per cent of
Kennecott's stock, successfully collects about 41
per cent of the votes of other stockholders, it
would acquire apparent control of the copper
firm.
But Kennecott, led by chairman Frank Milliken,
has waged a spirited defense and its own bid for
proxies. The battles, until yesterday, had been car
ried out chiefly through letters to stockholders
and newspaper advertisements and in various
courtrooms.
The fight has been regarded as the most conten
tious in recent Wall Street history.
Paul Newman appointed to U.N.
United Nations— Paul Newman is reported to be
the latest in a lengthening line of entertainers the
United States has booked into one of the world's
most prestigious houses — the U.N. General As
sembly.
Newman would become the first male among
the American performer-diplomats since the prac
tice began with Irene Dunne 21 years ago.
Shirley Temple Black, who recently celebrated
her 50th birthday, was probably the best known
American to serve here.
This looking to the entertainment world to fill
the U.S. diplomatic corps began under Henry
Cabot Lodge, |r., U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations from 1953 to 1960. Lodge apparently
thought Hollywood actresses, Broadway perfor
mers and renowned opera singers would draw
public attention to the fledgling international
body.
U.S. officials say they expect President jimmy
Carter to name the actor-director Newman to the
General Assembly's special session on disarma
ment beginning May 23 midway between two reg
ular sessions.
Dow Jones drops 4.15
New York — The stock market pulled back a bit

negative economic news that had been accumulat
ing since late last week.

had risen 7.01 points Monday to its highest closing
level in more than five months, slipped back 4.15
at 840.18.
New York Stock Exchange volume reached 41.40
million shares, up from 37.02 million Monday and
the sixth heaviest total in exchange history.
