# IRS claim appealed
## 
### Ben Pollock 
The University filed a letter of pro
test with the Internal Revenue Ser
vice Monday to avoid paying $8.4
million which the IRS claims the Uni
versity owes.
The letter appeals charges stem
ming from an audit report last
January in which the IRS said the
University owed "unrelated business
income" taxes from 1972 to 1975, ac
cording to Michael Hudnall, staff
counsel for business and finance.
The "unrelated business income''
is from four areas: security loans,
land development activity, media
coverage of sports and the Stanford
golf course.
Since January, the IRS has ruled
that securities loaned by the Univer
sity to brokerage houses are tax
exempt.
The IRS report said income from
University-owned land, such as the

Stanford Shopping Center, has only
an "indirect or incidental" relation
ship to the University's purposes and
therefore should be taxed.
Hudnall disagreed. He said last
January income from the leasing of
land by educational non-profit or
ganization is by law exempt.
At the request of other universities
the IRS is currently deciding (he
question of tax exemptions for radio
and TV income from sports events,
Hudnall said.
The University has successfully ar
gued in court that income from its
golf course should be exempt, he
added. A Santa Clara County
Superior Court judge overturned the
county tax assessor's ruling that the
land is not exempt because it is used
by people who are not faculty, staff
or students.
Hudnall said the IRS will schedule
a conference with the University
"probably during the late summer."
