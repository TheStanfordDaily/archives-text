# Energetic rafters confront white waters

White spray against your face.
Bouncing wildly over rocks in
rushing rapids. Paddling franti
cally for control. Relaxing on the
sun-baked rocks. Enjoying lush
green surroundings. It's all part of
river rafting, a new sport being en
joyed nationwide.
You can depart on a river raft
ing trip a rookie, like the freshmen
from Rinconada who went to
Stanislaus River three weeks ago.
But before you return, you will
have undergone the full impact of
a white water thrill.
"I was a little nervous even
though I'd been down the river
before," one student said. "You
see that river and it's huge."
River rafting is not a sport of
comfort. You spin and splash and
jostle back and forth among rocks,
rushing water and tree limbs.
But don't let names like "Death
Rock," "Widowmaker," and
"Devil's Staircase" scare you.
Though they aren't exactly shal
lows, chances are the worst thing
that can happen is falling out of
the raft.
So, how does one go about
river rafting? First, choose the
river. There are at least four chal
lenging California rivers. One, the
Stanislaus, is within three hours of

Stanford. Several commercial
rafting organizations lead trips
down the Stanislaus, Mother
Lode and 0.A.R.5., among
others. Those are located directly
on the Stanislaus River. Many
other rafting organizations exist to
help rafters learn the tricks of the
craft and to help rafters organize
trips.
A typical rubber river raft holds
six people. You'll take a paddle
and hop in at the starting point.
Your guide will join the crew as
well, with a longer paddle to steer
the craft. But don't expect a mild
or scenic ride. Crew members do
all the intense oaring.
After the crew has assembled,
you don your lite jacket, grab your
paddle and get in the rubber raft.
After a short routine talk about
safety and what to do when you
fall out, you'll have only a few trial
runs before you "hit" the real
river.
The spray hits your face and
you probably won't be able to see
a thing. You may be a bit tense
during your first rapids experi
ence, particularly if it's one of the
first challenging sets along the
Stanislaus. But soon, you get a
feel for the water.
Some rapids are like stairs. The
raft bounces and jolts

downstream. Others have ledges,
dropping as much as five feet as
the raft tumbles along, spinning in
circles, while the guide attempts to
steer with his paddle-rudder.
Needless to say, many rafters
do fall into the water. The only
danger then is possibly hitting
some of the submerged rocks.
However, the danger is minimal
and you will probably find your
self swept downstream faster than
the raft. Your crew will pick you
up later.
About halfway down the 9-10

mile Stanislaus route, completely
soaked to the skin and fatigued,
but exhilarated still, you can stop
along the riverbank for some
lunch, sunbathing, or relaxing.
Camera buffs will enjoy the scen
ery.
Then, you're back on the wa
ter's path once again. Rafters
reach the close of the trip in about
six hours, tired and wet but "still
psyched," according to some raf
ters.
Reservations are necessary for
the organized trips. The price for a

one-day trip is about $25 per per
son for groups of six or more.
Longer trips can also be made for
two or five days. Rafters camp out
along the river's edge.
For all trips be sure to bring
along shoes, a wool sweater, a
waterproof covering of some sort
and shorts.
And if you have doubts about
river rafting, forget them. It's a
great experience, even for the
non-outdoorsy type. Most people
can't wait to go rafting again.


Never let it be said water is not abundant in
California. The Stanislaus, American and
Tuolumne Rivers offer exciting weekend raft ad-

trained guides who do the rowing and also teach
paddle skills to energetic crews.
