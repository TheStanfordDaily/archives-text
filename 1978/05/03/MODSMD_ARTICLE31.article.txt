# Outdoor Travel Adventures
## Independence in cycling 
### Mitch Wasterlain 
Do you enjoy traveling but hate spending half of
your vacation inside a car? Do you like back roads
and out of the way places? Would you get a sense of
accomplishment from knowing that you've traveled
hundreds of miles using your own power? If so, or if
you just can't afford the price of gas you might want
to try bicycle touring.
The length and difficulty of a trip can be varied to
suit your needs. Some experienced bikers average
more than 100 miles a day. But any individual who is
in fairly good shape can cover 40 to 50 miles in a day.
A route which allows for relaxation and side trips will
probably be most enjoyable for all.
Before departure, bikers should learn basic bike
repairs, get in shape and acquire the proper equip
ment. A rear luggage carrier, toe clips, basic repair
tools and a pump are necessary equipment for tour
ing.
Saddlebags are another worthwhile investment.
Riding six hours a day with a 40 pound pack on your
back can make you look and feel like the hunchback
of Notre Dame.
Bikers should try to find the locations of long hills
along the planned routes. It can be quite disconcert
ing and tiring to suddenly find yourself climbing an
unexpected six-mile hill. Also, make sure that
adequate food will be available.
Lodging is available to the biker in many forms. In
most areas campgrounds are plentiful and provide
the biker with such luxuries as showers and running
water. Beaches and fields may not have many
facilities, but they are numerous and free.
For less adventuresome riders, youth hostels pro
vide a bed, showers and sometimes breakfast for a
total cost of about $2.

The alert biker quickly learns to capitalize on un
expected opportunities. Friendly strangers some
times offer bikers accommodations ranging from the
use of a backyard barn to beds, swimming pools, and
free meals. Churches can be equally generous. One
look at a ragged and famished biker will convince
most good samaritans that their help will be well
received.
Despite the general friendliness of people encoun
tered while touring, bikers do have natural enemies.
Dogs, mosquitoes, Winnebagos and logging trucks
are the most vicious. As a general rule, however,
anything that either bites or has four wheels and is
bigger than a bicycle should be considered danger
ous.
Trucks and cars pose the most serious threat, since
they often literally drive bikers off the road.
One other important source of danger is a poorly
maintained bicycle. Nuts and bolts should be
checked before leaving fc r the day's ride. It is espe
cially important that quick-reioase brakes and hubs
are properly tightened.
Several organizations arrange trips or can help
bikers to plan their own. Among these are American
Youth Hostels, the Bechtel I-Center here and the
California Department of Transportation (CalTrans).
CalTrans publishes a guide to the West Coast
Bicentennial route, which runs along the California
coast from Oregon to San Diego. This publication
contains detailed maps and useful information.
Aside from the pleasure of riding your bike or
relaxing, bicycle touring may also confront you with
unexpected experiences, ranging from being inter
viewed by a small town newspaper to finding the
perfect swimming hole just off the road. The old
saying that "half the fun is getting there" must have
been written by a touring cyclist.

Bike touring gives people the independence of carrying their own
gear and peddling tneir own way, while allowing for companionship
with a friend or in a group. Above, juniors Dave Atkinson and |oel
