# Essence of Spain: Historic Seville
## 
### Nancy Rivenburgh Sitting at Cafe Polio 
Dorado we sample our
glasses of golden cognac An el
derly Spanish man at the next
table told us it was "the hour of
the day for cognac." The sun was
just setting. So we shrugged our
shoulders and we drank.
Outside the door are narrow
streets lined with fruit markets, lot
tery booths and more cafes.
People are strolling, sitting and
talking in the warm evening air.
The scene is Seville and Seville
is Spain.
A long history places Seville re
spectfully as the capital of An
dalusia, and as the fourth largest
city in Spain. Conquests by Ro
mans, Moors, Almohads, and
Christians have left a con
glomeration of art and tradition
in the city.
Emerging from our "pension
(hotel) the next morning we begin
our own conquest of Sevilla,
Spanish for Seville.
As we reach the center of the
city we are confronted by a
cathedral so large that, inside, the
aisles are wider than many of
Seville's streets.
"Let us build a cathedral so
immense that everyone on be
holding it, will take us for mad
men," the Christians were sup-

posed to have said
when they tore down
the mosque which

once occupied the spot They
went on to build what is now the
third largest cathedral in Europe.
Our footsteps sound like tiptoe
ing mice as we wander between
towering columns stretching to
ward flamboyant vaults. We peer
inside richly ornamented chapels
which show the distinct, early Re
naissance influence in this pre
dominantly Gothic structure.

Outside we discover the one
remaining portion of the original
mosque, a graceful Moorish tower
called La Giralda, the weather
vane. It stands in a courtyard lined
with rows of orange trees, the
Patio do los Naranjos.
The tower is decorated by deli
cately simple bands of bas-relief
which rise up to the tower's top,
wheie a bronze statue of Faith
slowly revolves.
From the tower's summit,
Seville lies below us looking like a

patchwork quilt of architectural
styles. Plain wooden huts dot the
Triana quarter across the river,
where brightly-clothed gypsies
live their day-to-day existence.
Also on this spot, a famous horse
fair dating from Roman times is
held each year for the trading of
horses from all parts of Spain.
Directly below the tower are the
narrow streets and white stucco

buildings of the Santa Cruz quar
ter, a residential area once fa
vored by the Seville nobility.
A large grey Almohad alcazar or
fortress stands out among Sevil
le's variety of palaces and plazas;
all of which depict different
Spanish religious periods,
The lasting influence of the
Christian conquests in Spain is
displayed during the celebration
of Semana Santa, or Holy Week.
Although Holy Week is ob
served throughout all of Spain,
the most famous celebrations take

place in Seville.
Commanding almost complete
participation and the fervor of
local residents from Palm Sunday
to Easter, Holy Week is a myriad
of carnivals, costumes and
parades, climaxing in an all-night
celebration and the first bullfight
of the season on Easter.
All week each Christian church,
no matter what sect, conducts

separate, solemn processions por
traying a range of biblical scenes.
Large, elaborate wooden floats
laden with statues of Christ and
the Virgin Mary move through the
city streets. The floats are carried
by 36 sweating stevedores. Other
participants wear distinctive,
hooded costumes of their church,
the same design that was later
adopted by the Ku Klux Klan fur
its uniforms.
The week culminates in an out
burst of lively song and flamenco
dance flowing from bars to streets

— back to bars again,
involving all of Seville
in a crowded, joyous
night long celebration.

However, this vibrance isn't li
mited to Holy Week; it is an inhe
rent part of the Spanish character,
pervading the streets of Seville
every evening.
Sitting in a cafe along Sierpes, a
pedestrian street full of shops and
restaurants, we satiate ourselves
with cafe and churros (crispy spi
rals of grease fried bread) while
watching the passers-by.
The waiter tells us of an old
Spanish saying: "The three finest
pleasures a man can know are to
be young, to be in Sevilla, and to
stand in Sierpes at dusk while the
girls are passing."
An under-the-breath compli
ment of "guapa" by two girl
watchers close by confirms this,
as lovely Spanish women stroll
among other gawking young
men, dark-eyed children, rope
sandaled elders and an occasional
guardia civile.
The silent, massive silhouette
of the Seville cathedral looms
above the hum of people crowd
ing the street. Dipping our churros
into the cafe con leche we
watch these few generations
of Spanish people walk proud
ly among many centuries

of Seville's history.

The lasting influence of the
Christian conquests in Spain is
displayed during the celebration
of Semana Santa, or Holy Week.
Although Holy Week is ob
served throughout all of Spain,
the most famous celebrations take

place in Seville.
Commanding almost complete
participation and the fervor of
local residents from Palm Sunday
to Easter, Holy Week is a myriad
of carnivals, costumes and
parades, climaxing in an all-night
celebration and the first bullfight
of the season on Easter.
All week each Christian church,
no matter what sect, conducts

separate, solemn processions por
traying a range of biblical scenes.
Large, elaborate wooden floats
laden with statues of Christ and
the Virgin Mary move through the
city streets. The floats are carried
by 36 sweating stevedores. Other
participants wear distinctive,
hooded costumes of their church,
the same design that was later
adopted by the Ku Klux Klan fur
its uniforms.
The week culminates in an out
burst of lively song and flamenco
dance flowing from bars to streets

— back to bars again,
involving all of Seville
in a crowded, joyous
night long celebration.

However, this vibrance isn't li
mited to Holy Week; it is an inhe
rent part of the Spanish character,
pervading the streets of Seville
every evening.
Sitting in a cafe along Sierpes, a
pedestrian street full of shops and
restaurants, we satiate ourselves
with cafe and churros (crispy spi
rals of grease fried bread) while
watching the passers-by.
The waiter tells us of an old
Spanish saying: "The three finest
pleasures a man can know are to
be young, to be in Sevilla, and to
stand in Sierpes at dusk while the
girls are passing."
An under-the-breath compli
ment of "guapa" by two girl
watchers close by confirms this,
as lovely Spanish women stroll
among other gawking young
men, dark-eyed children, rope
sandaled elders and an occasional
guardia civile.
The silent, massive silhouette
of the Seville cathedral looms
above the hum of people crowd
ing the street. Dipping our churros
into the cafe con leche we
watch these few generations
of Spanish people walk proud
ly among many centuries

of Seville's history.
Spanish history. Be
cause Seville is Spain.
Dorado we sample our
glasses of golden cognac An el
derly Spanish man at the next
table told us it was "the hour of
the day for cognac." The sun was
just setting. So we shrugged our
shoulders and we drank.
Outside the door are narrow
streets lined with fruit markets, lot
tery booths and more cafes.
People are strolling, sitting and
talking in the warm evening air.
The scene is Seville and Seville
is Spain.
A long history places Seville re
spectfully as the capital of An
dalusia, and as the fourth largest
city in Spain. Conquests by Ro
mans, Moors, Almohads, and
Christians have left a con
glomeration of art and tradition
in the city.
Emerging from our "pension
(hotel) the next morning we begin
our own conquest of Sevilla,
Spanish for Seville.
As we reach the center of the
city we are confronted by a
cathedral so large that, inside, the
aisles are wider than many of
Seville's streets.
"Let us build a cathedral so
immense that everyone on be
holding it, will take us for mad
men," the Christians were sup-

posed to have said
when they tore down
the mosque which

once occupied the spot They
went on to build what is now the
third largest cathedral in Europe.
Our footsteps sound like tiptoe
ing mice as we wander between
towering columns stretching to
ward flamboyant vaults. We peer
inside richly ornamented chapels
which show the distinct, early Re
naissance influence in this pre
dominantly Gothic structure.

Outside we discover the one
remaining portion of the original
mosque, a graceful Moorish tower
called La Giralda, the weather
vane. It stands in a courtyard lined
with rows of orange trees, the
Patio do los Naranjos.
The tower is decorated by deli
cately simple bands of bas-relief
which rise up to the tower's top,
wheie a bronze statue of Faith
slowly revolves.
From the tower's summit,
Seville lies below us looking like a

patchwork quilt of architectural
styles. Plain wooden huts dot the
Triana quarter across the river,
where brightly-clothed gypsies
live their day-to-day existence.
