# Air rates confuse travelers
## 
### Matt Mettler 
There is tremendous confu
sion among consumers over
rates charged by charter and
commercial airlines, according
to Susan Maher. a Sequoia
travel agent here.
Over the past five years there
has been a gradual deregulation
of national airline fares. With the
failure of the Internatinal Air
line Transport Association
(lATA) to reach an agreement
on internatinal air fares at the
April meeting, consumers have
been left with "a scad of diffe
rent rate structures, Maher
said.
Deregulation gives any air
line the right to lower air fares
to any level without Civil
Aeronautics Board (CAB) ap
proval. Airlines can also raise
rates by as much as 2 per cent
without CAB approval. De
regulation proposals have
been approved by the U S. Se
nate and now face House and
executive approval, according
to Maher
Normally the lATA an
nounces the internatinal air
rates, flights, packages and re
strictions to be adhered to by
all major carriers each spring,
Maher said.
Because there was no ag
reement at the meeting, how
ever. each airline is now setting
its own rates and rules. Maher
said.
Air fares have been rising on
most flights, except those be
tween New York and London.
But other foreign nations will
not allow carriers with low rates
to fly into their airports. Maher

said.
"Some nations will not allow
charters," she said. "Sweden is
an example. They don't want to
provide competition for their
national airlines by allowing
foreign airlines with cheap air
fares into the country.''
Consumers are likely to re
main confused by the rate
structure systems unless they
consult a good travel agent
when traveling, Maher said.
"Just as an example thereare
23 different fares to New York
City. All have different rules.
Some are budget fares; others
require that you stay a certain
number of days; others require
making reservations several
monthsahead of the departure
date. If an individual doesn't
have a good agent to decipher
those rates, he'll be lost,'
Maher said.

Some airlines are attempting
to alleviate the confusion con
sumers now face when picking
a flight package. Continental
and National Airlines are sim
ply lowering air fares on various
flights. Thereare no limitations
on time to stay in the city. Fares
are being lowered by as much
as 45 per cent, Maher said
"However, we'll have to wait
to see what the big three do:
American, United and TWA
They have not followed suit, as
of yet."
Despite the large number of
budget packages, excursion
fares and other recently instil
led discounted flight packages,
Maher said that Sequoia Travel
has not noted any new overall
volume increases in flight
sales.
