# The 						Alaskan Bush:
## Remote, rugged and timeless 
### Heather Grahame 
Most of Alakska is "bush"
country, areas that can be
reached only by small plane. And
traveling to the bush country by
plane isn't always easy or com
fortable. Some bush planes can
not fly higher than 300 feet, have
windowpanes taped to the plane
body and are without seatbelts.
But in spite of the inconveni
ences in getting there, the lure of
Alaska for the adventurous
traveler is in its bush country.
Alaskan Indians, Eskimos,
Aleuts and homesteaders live in
the bush country. The Indians live
along the powerful Yukon river,
the Eskimos along the windy Ber
ing Sea coast, and the Aleuts on
the Alaskan Peninsula and in the
stormy Aleutian Islands.
The Indians, Eskimos and
Aleuts live in small, weather
beaten but sturdy wooden
houses. The Alaskan Eskimos do
not live in igloos. Only the Cana
dian Eskimos living in the colder
interior make igloos and then only
for temporary hunting shelters.
Slow pace
Life in the bush is conducted at
a much slower pace than in the
lower 48 states. Time doesn't
have the same meaning, and
watches and clocks are rare. If
time is kept at all, it is kept accord
ing to tides.
Institutions such as school, the
police and the postal service, so
important on the U.S. mainland,
are far less important in Alaska. In
one Indian community, the post

mistress and a neighbor had an
argument. The postmistress
proved her point by locking the
post office and flying to Anchor
age for three weeks. With her ab
sence, no mail could be delivered.
Hot steambaths replace show
ers in remote Alaskan villages. In
the Eskimo village Good News
Bay, the women compete with
each other to see who can take the
hottest steambath. As a result,
many women have scars from the
searing temperatures.
Rugged and rigorous
Life in the bush is rugged and
provides an important contrast to
the much less rigorous lifestyle
experienced in most of the lower
48 states. Imagine having to haul
water, fish and hunt for every
meal, and sew your winter coat
from seal gut.
Some communities do have a
power generator and receive
some supplies from Anchorage
when the weather permits flying.
Still, the physical demands for
survival are great.
But in spite of the difficulties,
the people who live in the bush
find the time to make a traveler
feel comfortable. Freshly caught
salmon mysteriously lands at your
door. Invitations for a traditional
meal of deer, caribou, fish and
greens provide the traveler an op
portunity to learn about a new cul
ture.
If you can't make it to the bush,
there are accessible parts of
Alaska which are still challenging
and wild.

Near the center of the state is
majestic Mount McKinley at
20,320 feet Rivers, tundra, beds
of blueberry bushes, precipitous
glaciers and snowy peaks are all
found in the park.
Wildlife is abundant in the park.
While camping there last summer,
a group of Stanford students
crawled out of their tents one

morning to find several grizzly
bears devouring their granola
bars.
The postcards of people
proudly holding the tail of their
record-length fish must be from
the towns Homer or Seward on
the Kenai Peninsula. These towns
are the center of many fish runs.
Trophy size halibut and salmon

are found on the hook of every
fisherman's line after the fight
Bring your fishing rod. Even a
novice angler can't miss.
No one Alaska trip can cover it
all. It's impossible to stretch your
time enough to see and experi
ence all that the wilderness and
the people offer. One warm
summer will lure you back for
many more.


In many parts of Alaska, snowy mountains tower
more than 5,000 feet above small town marinas.

No one Alaska trip can cover it
all. It's impossible to stretch your
time enough to see and experi
ence all that the wilderness and
the people offer. One warm
summer will lure you back for
many more.


In many parts of Alaska, snowy mountains tower
more than 5,000 feet above small town marinas.

Most of Alakska is "bush"
country, areas that can be
reached only by small plane. And
traveling to the bush country by
plane isn't always easy or com
fortable. Some bush planes can
not fly higher than 300 feet, have
windowpanes taped to the plane
body and are without seatbelts.
But in spite of the inconveni
ences in getting there, the lure of
Alaska for the adventurous
traveler is in its bush country.
Alaskan Indians, Eskimos,
Aleuts and homesteaders live in
the bush country. The Indians live
along the powerful Yukon river,
the Eskimos along the windy Ber
ing Sea coast, and the Aleuts on
the Alaskan Peninsula and in the
stormy Aleutian Islands.
The Indians, Eskimos and
Aleuts live in small, weather
beaten but sturdy wooden
houses. The Alaskan Eskimos do
not live in igloos. Only the Cana
dian Eskimos living in the colder
interior make igloos and then only
for temporary hunting shelters.
Slow pace
Life in the bush is conducted at
a much slower pace than in the
lower 48 states. Time doesn't
have the same meaning, and
watches and clocks are rare. If
time is kept at all, it is kept accord
ing to tides.
Institutions such as school, the
police and the postal service, so
important on the U.S. mainland,
are far less important in Alaska. In
one Indian community, the post

mistress and a neighbor had an
argument. The postmistress
proved her point by locking the
post office and flying to Anchor
age for three weeks. With her ab
sence, no mail could be delivered.
Hot steambaths replace show
ers in remote Alaskan villages. In
the Eskimo village Good News
Bay, the women compete with
each other to see who can take the
hottest steambath. As a result,
many women have scars from the
searing temperatures.
Rugged and rigorous
Life in the bush is rugged and
provides an important contrast to
the much less rigorous lifestyle
experienced in most of the lower
48 states. Imagine having to haul
water, fish and hunt for every
meal, and sew your winter coat
from seal gut.
Some communities do have a
power generator and receive
some supplies from Anchorage
when the weather permits flying.
Still, the physical demands for
survival are great.
But in spite of the difficulties,
the people who live in the bush
find the time to make a traveler
feel comfortable. Freshly caught
salmon mysteriously lands at your
door. Invitations for a traditional
meal of deer, caribou, fish and
greens provide the traveler an op
portunity to learn about a new cul
ture.
If you can't make it to the bush,
there are accessible parts of
Alaska which are still challenging
and wild.

Near the center of the state is
majestic Mount McKinley at
20,320 feet Rivers, tundra, beds
of blueberry bushes, precipitous
glaciers and snowy peaks are all
found in the park.
Wildlife is abundant in the park.
While camping there last summer,
a group of Stanford students
crawled out of their tents one

morning to find several grizzly
bears devouring their granola
bars.
The postcards of people
proudly holding the tail of their
record-length fish must be from
the towns Homer or Seward on
the Kenai Peninsula. These towns
are the center of many fish runs.
Trophy size halibut and salmon

are found on the hook of every
fisherman's line after the fight
Bring your fishing rod. Even a
novice angler can't miss.
