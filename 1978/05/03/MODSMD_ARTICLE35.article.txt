# Backpacking demands rigor

see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not,
when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.

Backpacking can be just about anything the
backpacker wants it to be. One student described it
as a "merging of the physical and metaphysical; I
backpack, therefore i am." Another student de
scribed the adventure as "transportation from point
A to point B." Yet another student described it as
"mellow."
What is backpacking? My dictionary doesn't even
list the sport in which millions of people will partici
pate this year. But a consensus of the backpackers 1
spoke to defined it this way. Backpacking: the act of
putting everything you need in a pack on your back,
then going for it.
Although the word "backpackinq" mav conjure
up images of a casual "Thoreau-like" stroll through
the woods, a closer examination of the sport reveals
that it's a little tougher than it sounds.
Hours of planning and preparation are necessary
before the fun begins. And although walking through
nature may sound easy, the pack can become heavy.
The feet do get sore.
According to one backpacker, the first test to de
termine whether backpacking is for you, is to spend
an entire day walking.
Stressing the importance of this, one backpacker
added. "Some really gung-ho people will go out and
buy brand-new everything one day and set out on
the Applachian Trail the next. They usually won't go
for more than a few miles before they collapse with

blisters and sore muscles."
However, if after all that walking you decide that
you'd still like to do the same thing for several days in
a row while wearing a heavy pack and boots and
living off powdered food, go ahead and invest in
some good, but not great, equipment.
And food may be an important consideration to
some potential backpackers. One student com
mented, "The bad thing about backpacking is the
food — powdered eggs, powdered milk, powdered
stew and powdered powder. Yuck."
The three most important and most expensive
pieces of equipment for the packer are the boots, the
sleeping bag and, of course, the pack.
Boots: Boots should be very sturdy, but comforta
ble. For the beginning walker, boots should be as
light as possible. Weight on the feet feels about
five times heavier than weight on the back.
Packs: The type of pack necessary depends upon
the kind of journey to be undertaken. For day-long
trips, a day pack which looks like a book bag is fine.
Rucksacks are slightly larger, and will handle weights
up to 40 pounds. For real camping trips, however, a
backpack is suggested. The backpack, unlike the
other two, has a frame which distributes the weight of
the pack throughout the hip and leg muscles in addi
tion to the shoulders.

Sleeping bag: The most popular sleeping bags
today are filled with down or polyester. Although the
traditional down bags tend to weigh a pound less and
are more compact than the latter, the polyester bags
cost about 40 per cent less and function better than
down in wet climates. It is also suggested that a foam
pad be placed between the bag and the ground.

It's true. Even the most experienced and energetic backpackers take
breaks along their route. The Sierra Gold Rush Country is one of
many California areas with trails for beginning, intermediate and
advanced packers.
