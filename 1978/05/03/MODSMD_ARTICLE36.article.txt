Imagine receiving academic credit for taking a
safari expedition in Africa, designing ceramics in
Spain or picnicking at the Acropolis in Greece.
Sound too good to be true? Foothill Junior College
has a new Field Studies Program, open to any stu
dents 18 vears or older.
Foothill has planned 10 different trips to Africa,
Spain. Greece, Israel, France, South America. Eng
land. Ireland and Cuba for this summer Departure
dates range from June to September for the two-to
four week trips.
Each trip has a special theme which will provide
the major emphasis of study. Two faculty members
who have expertise in the country's language and
the particular focus will lead the excursions. Theme
topics range from Spanish pottery, Israeli social in
stitutions to family life.
The trips are open to anyone with a curiosity about
a country, and who wants to learn, according to Bill
Tinsley, program director.
The "East Africa and Wildlife of Kenya" trip takes
students on a 23-day safari to study the human and
natural history of Kenya. Using four-wheel drive veh
icles and on foot, participants wil explore places in
cluding Mount Kenya, Meru Reserve and the Masai
Mara.
This trip offers opportunities to study and photo
graph animal behavior in one of the richest wildlife
regions on earth. During the trip, participants will
actually be out in the bush, living among the animals
and the flowers, Tinsley said.

For those more interested in Greeks than gazelles,
there is a Greek language, art and literature trip. This
program has been designed to show students all
major periods of Greek culture, from the prehistoric
Mycenean-Minoan to modern day.
The "Spanish Culture and Ceramics of Galicia"
trip focuses on Sargadelos, a ceramics factory in a
Spanish pueblo.
The factory is located in ?n old part of Spain which
retains many of its old traditions and practices. The
Galician language, maintained for over 400 years by
oral communication, is spoken by all the factory
employees. The factory has a ceramics school at
tached, where students will practice pottery skills.
Tinsley called the "English and Irish Literary
Landmarks ' trips one of the most unusal. Particip
ants will "explore the regions that inspired Shakes
peare, Hardy, Dickens. Lawrence and Austen to
creat their literary masterpieces," and discover the
places they made famous, he said.
For those interested in sampling the finest French
cuisine while studying the history and culture of Fr
ance, there will be a three-week trip led by Henri
Diament, a French language instructor who taught at
Stanford for two years, and Lou Pappas, a food
specialist.
"The other trips feature diverse, unique aspects of
those countries as well," according to Tinsley. About
20 people will participate in each trip. For more
information about any of the programs, people may
contact the Summer Session Office at Foothill Col
lege. Students should act immediately as participants
will be selected on a first-come first-served basis.
