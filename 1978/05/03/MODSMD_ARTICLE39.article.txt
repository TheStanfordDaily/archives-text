# See Europe a la rail pass
## 
### Monika Guttman 
In a country like ours, "where
the predominant means of trans
portation are airplanes and cars,
it's hard to realize that trains can
be convenient, comfortable and
fun."
This sophomore, like many
other students who have traveled
through Europe by train, spoke
highly of the European rail sys
tems. Trains have been the most
popular mode of transportation in
Europe for years, and for a stu
dent who wants to travel for a set
amount of time, rail passes can be
very economical.
"Not only did I save money,'
said one enthusiastic traveler,
"but I saw some of the most
gorgeous scenery of my entire trip
while resting on the train.''
There are many different types
of passes which can be purchased
for European rail travel. Besides
price, the student should check for
differences in the duration of the
passes, the countries where they
are valid, and where passes can
be purchased, to determine which
would be the most economical.
The best known of the passes is
the Eurail pass. Sold only in the
United States, this pass can be

purchased at various travel agen
cies, including ASSU Travel Ser
vice. The only qualification neces
sary is a passport, and the pass
becomes valid the first day of use.
Approximate prices are: $170 for
15 days, $260 for one month,
$420 for three months. The Eurail
pass is good for first class travel in
most Western European coun
tries, except England, Wales and
Scotland.
A cheaper pass, usable in the
same countries as the Eurail pass,
is the Student Rail pass. Student
Rail passes offer only one pass for
two months duration, but may be
more economical for some travel
ers. These passes cost about
$230, and to purchase one, one
must also have an International
Student Identification Card, av
ailable at Bechtel International
Center for $3.
There are also student trains
which run just for students once or
twice a week in summer. Train
fare is an economical 40 per cent
below regular fares. However, the
trains are crowded, and reserva
tions are a must. Tickets can be
purchased at student travel offices
in Europe.
One student, who said she ac

tually preferred hitchhiking to any
other type of transportation, re
commended an Inter-rail pass.
For this pass, however, one must
give a local European address,
and it can only be purchased in
Europe. This pass is usable in vir
tually every European country
except the communist ones. Ap
proximate cost for second class
travel is $160 for one month.
"I never had a single hassle,"
said Doug Davis, a student here
who lived in both England and
Ireland. "I traveled British, Ger
man and Swiss rail systems."
"But I've heard rumors that the
train systems in Italy and Spain
are not as efficient due to Gallic
temperament and lack of
facilities," he added.
Most people agreed that trains
are generally crowded in the
summer.
"When it's hot and you're
dragging your luggage, it can re
ally be a hassle," said one student.
But if you miss one train, you can
always get on the next one, she
said.
Overall, most students enjoyed
riding the trains.
"I felt disoriented when I finally
took a plane home," said one stu
dent.


This German train is typical of the many trains
students can ride across the European mainland. A
variety of travel/rail passes are available here and
