# Rail, bus passes: useful, fun

### Barbie Fields 
Traveling across the United States in a balloon or
in the company of hobos on a freight train may
appeal to some people. But for those of us who are
more cautious, yet still want a rambling kind of vaca
tion this summer, Greyhound or Amtrak may have
something to offer
Julie Cohn, a sophomore, spent two weeks with a
friend exploring parts of the country on Amtrak.
"Lots of things happened that we didn't expect.''
said Cohn. "We thought dining in the dining car
would be impressive like in the movies. It turned out
to be one of our least favorite things because of the
poor food and service we ran into."
Conversely, porters were very helpful with things
like wake-up calls and reading time schedules, ac
cording to Cohn.
She said she also learned a lesson in tipping on
that first train ride. "As we were leaving the train I
noticed one of the porters who had been exception
ally nice to us looking our way with a big grin on his
face. We decided he would be offended if we tried to
tip him. so we just shook his hand and left," said
Cohn.
"He gave us the strangest look. Later we learned
that extra service was in hopes of getting a heftier tip,
not none at all."
Cohn said limited scheduling may frustrate the
Amtrak traveler.

"Trains usually only pass through a town once a
day," she said.
While Amtrak can claim more luxurious travel
than Greyhound, Bob Moog, a senior in political
science pointed out the increased flexibility of bus
trips. Moog started in Missouri and went east with a
friend on Greyhoud's 32-day Ameripass the summer
of 1974 "There is a feeling of independence and
mobility, besides being a relatively inexpensive way
to go," said Moog. "Besides, with buses running at
least three times a day I never felt 'stuck' anywhere.
"Planning ahead is the key. Marking out a general
route of the key places you want to visit is best," he
said. According to Moog, people miss a lot by skip
ping the small towns because that's where you meet
the interesting people.
"We were the first people in a month to stay at this
one youth hostel in New Hampshire. The caretaker
unlocked the place for us and let us play basketball in
the gym connected to it," Moog said.
"The most important thing is to maximize your
time and yet not feel so regimented that you can't do
something unplanned that sounds like fun," he said.
The Greyhound Ameripass, good in the United
States and Canada, can be bought for 15, 30 or 60
days. Prices are $165, $225 and $325 respectively.
Summer fares for the USA Railpass have not been
set yet, but last year's summer fares were $290 for
two weeks, $365 for three weeks and $450 for four
weeks
