# Bella Italia: Romantic still but not quite perfect
## 
### Dan Fiduccia Robert Mauro 
Italy has attracted visitors for centuries:
pilgrims, tourists, and students have all
voyaged to see the glory of ancient Rome,
the home of the Catholic Church, the gran
deur of the Renaissance, and a spectacular
landscape of beaches and rugged moun
tains.
To the traveler who is intent on seeing as
much of Italy as possible in the shortest
time, the nationally-owned train system
may not be the way to go. Second class
train travel is uncomfortable and unreli
able. However, if convenience and speed
aren't important, train travel could be for
you — it's reasonably priced and it can
result in meeting fascinating characters with
long and interesting stories to tell.
Italians spend more time on strike than
just about any other people in the world.
Strikes may last for a few minutes, or a few
days, and travelers should always be pre
pared for one — particularly during national
holidays. If you can't determine the reason
for the strike, don't worry, neither can most
of the strikers.
So some travelers may prefer to travel by
car, plane, motorcycle, or even foot. At any
rate, some of the cities and experiences to
look forward to include:
Milan — home of a splendid Gothic
Cathedral, the famed La Scala Opera
House, and Da Vinci's Last Supper. The
city, second largest in Italy, is the financial
capital of Italy. Unfortunately, the city has

often been the target for much of the
violence that has plagued Italy in recent
years.
Turin — home of the Fiat, Co., which
owns many of the highways in Italy, and
manufactures most of the cars and almost
everything else in the country.
Florence — The rule of the Medici's left
its mark on this city. From the artwork in the
Pitti Palace, Michelangelo's David to the
famous Duomo, the visitor is left awed. He
may also be left aghast.
The automobile fumes that cover most
Italian cities seem to choke Florence, even
though most residents use the buses.
There is an ulterior motive for taking the
bus. In recent years, Italy has encountered
a severe shortage of coin money. Un
daunted, however, Florence has equipped
most of its buses with automatic ticket
machines and the drivers carry no change.
A slight difficulty paying might arise
elsewhere, but not in Italy. If you don't
have coins you just don't pay.
Venice — perhaps the grandest city in
Europe. The winding streets and singing
gondoliers lend the floating city a romantic
air. However, depending on the oceanic
conditions the canals can produce a very
different atmosphere. Wifts of stagnant
water can ruin evenings on the water.
Rome — the Eternal City. Even if you
have all the time in the world, you will never
see all this city has to offer. Baroque
churches, Vatican City and excavations of
ancient Rome await you. So does the social
life of a great, international city.
Rome will assault your sense like no
other city. Air pollution is incredible; (Rome
is reputed to be one of the three dirtiest
cities in the world), and the smog just hangs
in the narrow winding streets which run
throughout the city's center.
But Rome has a magnificient bus system
— for a mere 10 cents, you can take one
ride anywhere in Rome. That 10 cent fare
also guarantees a more thrilling and
danger-filled time than you would have on
any amusement park ride, since the bus
drivers wind their way crazily through the
narrow streets and hills of Rome.

And after gorging yourself in some of
the city's great restaurants you can work it
off by strolling in one of the city's beautiful
parks.
In the last few years, Rome has unfortu
nately joined the other major Italian cities in
becoming a terrorist's battlefield. Shoot
ings have become frighteningly com
monplace. It's possible you may find your
self walking into a conflict between riot
equipped army soldiers and armed ex
tremists in almost any area of the city.
Seeing a huge cloud of tear gas float
down the Tiber river at night may not be
one of the memories you wanted when you
decided to come to Rome, but the Italians
manage to take it in stride, although their
patience has been running short lately.
With a little care, you can avoid most of the
trouble and just worry about confronting all
the other foreigners in town.
Naples — This town has been

memoralized in many songs. It has a few
good museums, and is also NATO's
Southern European headquarters. Naples
is also rather impoverished. That factor and
the large number of servicemen account for
a good deal of crime and vice. Keep your
wallet in your hip pocket.
However, there is enough for you to
enjoy in the area: the ruins of Ercolano and
Pompeii — towns destroyed by a volcanic
eruption in 79 A.D. — and the islands of
Ischia and Capri (you're better off going to
Ischia because the beaches at Capri are
rocky).
Despite its problems, Italy remains a
fabulous country to visit. The Italians are
about the friendliest people you'll ever
meet. Any one going to Europe should
consider spending at least a few weeks in
Italy. Your memories may not be tour book
material, but you'll certainly have enough
to last a lifetime.

The infamous Duomo in Florence is only one of hundreds of relics enjoyed by the tourist
to Italy. The side of the Duomo shown here is only one of its richly decorated facades.

material, but you'll certainly have enough
to last a lifetime.

The infamous Duomo in Florence is only one of hundreds of relics enjoyed by the tourist
to Italy. The side of the Duomo shown here is only one of its richly decorated facades.
Italy has attracted visitors for centuries:
pilgrims, tourists, and students have all
voyaged to see the glory of ancient Rome,
the home of the Catholic Church, the gran
deur of the Renaissance, and a spectacular
landscape of beaches and rugged moun
tains.
To the traveler who is intent on seeing as
much of Italy as possible in the shortest
time, the nationally-owned train system
may not be the way to go. Second class
train travel is uncomfortable and unreli
able. However, if convenience and speed
aren't important, train travel could be for
you — it's reasonably priced and it can
result in meeting fascinating characters with
long and interesting stories to tell.
Italians spend more time on strike than
just about any other people in the world.
Strikes may last for a few minutes, or a few
days, and travelers should always be pre
pared for one — particularly during national
holidays. If you can't determine the reason
for the strike, don't worry, neither can most
of the strikers.
So some travelers may prefer to travel by
car, plane, motorcycle, or even foot. At any
rate, some of the cities and experiences to
look forward to include:
Milan — home of a splendid Gothic
Cathedral, the famed La Scala Opera
House, and Da Vinci's Last Supper. The
city, second largest in Italy, is the financial
capital of Italy. Unfortunately, the city has

often been the target for much of the
violence that has plagued Italy in recent
years.
Turin — home of the Fiat, Co., which
owns many of the highways in Italy, and
manufactures most of the cars and almost
everything else in the country.
Florence — The rule of the Medici's left
its mark on this city. From the artwork in the
Pitti Palace, Michelangelo's David to the
famous Duomo, the visitor is left awed. He
may also be left aghast.
The automobile fumes that cover most
Italian cities seem to choke Florence, even
though most residents use the buses.
There is an ulterior motive for taking the
bus. In recent years, Italy has encountered
a severe shortage of coin money. Un
daunted, however, Florence has equipped
most of its buses with automatic ticket
machines and the drivers carry no change.
A slight difficulty paying might arise
elsewhere, but not in Italy. If you don't
have coins you just don't pay.
Venice — perhaps the grandest city in
Europe. The winding streets and singing
gondoliers lend the floating city a romantic
air. However, depending on the oceanic
conditions the canals can produce a very
different atmosphere. Wifts of stagnant
water can ruin evenings on the water.
Rome — the Eternal City. Even if you
have all the time in the world, you will never
see all this city has to offer. Baroque
churches, Vatican City and excavations of
ancient Rome await you. So does the social
life of a great, international city.
Rome will assault your sense like no
other city. Air pollution is incredible; (Rome
is reputed to be one of the three dirtiest
cities in the world), and the smog just hangs
in the narrow winding streets which run
throughout the city's center.
But Rome has a magnificient bus system
— for a mere 10 cents, you can take one
ride anywhere in Rome. That 10 cent fare
also guarantees a more thrilling and
danger-filled time than you would have on
any amusement park ride, since the bus
drivers wind their way crazily through the
narrow streets and hills of Rome.

And after gorging yourself in some of
the city's great restaurants you can work it
off by strolling in one of the city's beautiful
parks.
In the last few years, Rome has unfortu
nately joined the other major Italian cities in
becoming a terrorist's battlefield. Shoot
ings have become frighteningly com
monplace. It's possible you may find your
self walking into a conflict between riot
equipped army soldiers and armed ex
tremists in almost any area of the city.
Seeing a huge cloud of tear gas float
down the Tiber river at night may not be
one of the memories you wanted when you
decided to come to Rome, but the Italians
manage to take it in stride, although their
patience has been running short lately.
With a little care, you can avoid most of the
trouble and just worry about confronting all
the other foreigners in town.
Naples — This town has been

memoralized in many songs. It has a few
good museums, and is also NATO's
Southern European headquarters. Naples
is also rather impoverished. That factor and
the large number of servicemen account for
a good deal of crime and vice. Keep your
wallet in your hip pocket.
However, there is enough for you to
enjoy in the area: the ruins of Ercolano and
Pompeii — towns destroyed by a volcanic
eruption in 79 A.D. — and the islands of
Ischia and Capri (you're better off going to
Ischia because the beaches at Capri are
rocky).
Despite its problems, Italy remains a
fabulous country to visit. The Italians are
about the friendliest people you'll ever
meet. Any one going to Europe should
consider spending at least a few weeks in
Italy. Your memories may not be tour book
material, but you'll certainly have enough
to last a lifetime.
