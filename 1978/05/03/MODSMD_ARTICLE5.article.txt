# Trustees cast surprise vote for withdrawal
## 
### Randy Keith 
In an unprecedented move, the
Board of Trustees yesterday decided
to vote in favor of a stockholder's
proxy resolution calling for the with
drawal of Phelps Dodge from South
Africa.
The trustees also voted to oppose
shareholder resolutions requiring
Mobil Oil and Standard Oil of
California to reduce oil imports to
South Africa and voted to abstain on
a resolution calling for the with
drawal of Motorola from that coun
try.
The Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR) had urged the
board to vote for the Phelps Dodge
proxy resolution. The CIR stated in
its report the mining company "has
not undertaken a variety of affirma
tive action programs found in many
other companies in South Africa."
The CIR also noted the company
had turned over a controlling in
terest in its largest mine to a South
African firm last October.
Frederick Hillier, professor of op
erations research and chairman of
the CIR, said he was "delighted" with
the trustees' position on the Phelps
Dodge withdrawal proxy.
The Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy issued a
statement which said, "The trustees'
action today has served to cloud
rather than clarify the issue. They
have ignored the fact that any U.S.
corporate presence in South Africa
bolsters apartheid.
"The community should be wary
of accepting this vote as an indication
that the trustees are beginning to ac
cept corporate withdrawal in princi
ple," the statement added.
The Mobil and Standard Oil pro
xies both called for the companies to
reduce oil imports to South Africa in
an attempt to stop the transshipment
of oil to Rhodesia.
The trustees rejected the ClR's re
commendation of a yes vote on both
proxies stating they could find no
evidence that the two companies
were actually participating in the oil
shipments.
In its report, the CIR said "allega
tions have been made by reputable
parties, supported by an impressive
body of evidence, that both Mobil
and Caltex (jointly owned by Stan
dard Oil and Texaco) are involved
with sales to Rhodesia through third
parties, thereby violating at least the
spirit of U.S. laws and regulations."

Last week the trustees voted to
oppose proxies calling for Texaco to
withdraw from South Africa and
asking the company to report on al
legations that it sells oil to Rhodesia
through third parties.
The trustees stand on the Texaco
proxies resulted in two protests
within one week. The first occurred
last Wednesday when about 50 de
monstrators occupied the lobby of
President Richard Lyman's office for
nearly seven hours. The other, last
Monday, resulted in 150 protesters
sitting-in at Encina Hall for an hour
and a half.
On the Motorola proxy, the trus
tees sided with the CIR and voted to
abstain on a proposal requiring the
company to end new investment in
South Africa, to make no more sa'es

to the South African government and
to withdraw from the country.
The trustees said Motorola has an
"unusually good record on socially
affirmative action," and also cited
the company's "declaration that no
more sales will be made to the gov
ernment for military or police pur
poses."
In other proxy votes the trustees:
— Followed the ClR's recommen
dation and voted in favor of a resolu
tion calling on Newmont Mining to
report on its affirmative action prog
rams in Namibia; and
— Voted against proxies on two
General Dynamics resolutions; one
resolution calling for reports on
midwest coal mining operations and
the other on maritime lobbying ef
forts.
