Responding to the Board of Trus
tees vote in favor of the Phelps
Dodge withdrawal proxy, Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) chairman Frederick Hillier said,
"I'm delighted. This is a very signific
ant actton, the first time the trustees
have voted for a withdrawal proxy."
Speaking last night on KZSU's
Campus Conference, Hillier, a pro
fessor in Operations Research, ad
ded, "This indicates that under cer
tain conditions the trustees will vote
for withdrawal."
Hillier said that in contrast with
Texaco, whose withdrawal proxy was
opposed last week by the trustees,
"Phelps Dodge has not had a very
good record of affirmative action."
Disappointing record
The trustees' report indicated "the
company's own report on the Sulli
van principles showed a 'disappoint
ing record of socially affirmative ac
tion,' " Hillier added.
The Sullivan principles are a set of
affirmative action guidelines for
American corporations with South
African holdings.
President of the Board of Trustees
Peter Bing earlier stated in letters to
corporations in Stanford's portfolio
the trustees had a different emphasis
than the CIR. However, Hillier com
mented, "In light of this new vote on

Phelps Dodge, the emphasis of trus
tees and the CIR is fundamentally the
same.
Companies exploit
"The CIR report has found that
companies in South Africa inevitably,
to varying degrees, exploit the social
injury," Hillier added.
"It's understandably very difficult
for the trustees to come around to
the CIR position," he said. "Many
trustees are from the business com
munity. The conventional wisdom in
the business community is that a
multinational corporation can go
anywhere as long as it stays out of
social and political issues."
Hillier also commented on the
trustees' vote to oppose shareholder
resolutions calling for Mobil Oil and
Standard Oil of California to reduce
oil imports to South Africa. CIR had
recommended that the trustees vote
affirmatively on the resolution.
Not surprised
"I'm not particularly surprised,
especially in regard to their no vote
on a similar proxy before Texaco," he
said. "These resolutions were
somewhat mor#ambiguous because
they did not directly relate to the de
sired solution which is the stopping
of third person oil salei to
Rhodesia."
Hillier said he had a more optimis-
tic view than President Richard
Lyman on the University's efforts to
improve the South African situation.
Lyman recently described Stanford's
actions as being "on the margin."
"From discussing the issue with
white South Africans, I think what
American corporations do in South
Africa is closely followed and re
ported in the press (in South Africa).
Any major step or threat towards
withdrawal would send real shock
waves."
He added, "Some whites in South
Africa seem to live in a false paradise;

they don't realize the gravity of the
situation. Withdrawal or a threat of it
would be a real shock to them."
CIR 'influential'
When asked about the effective
ness of the CIR this year, Hillier re
plied, "I believe the CIR has been
very influential. We need go back
only a year. In the past, many or most
of the trustees would have been dis
inclined to vote against manage
ment.
"This year the trustees have made
a number of significant actions. I can
not imagine these actions having
happened without the CIR," he said.
