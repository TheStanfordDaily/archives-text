# New plan fights exploitation
## Carter's immigration plan aims to raise status of undocumented aliens 
### Bert Bower 
President Jimmy Carter's immigration plan will
help reduce the exploitation of the estimated three to
six million undocumented aliens in the United States,
according to Leonel Castillo.
Castillo is commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) and the first Chicano to
hold the top INS position. He spoke to a predomi
nately Chicano audience last night in the law school
during a public forum presented by the Chicano Law
Students Association.
"The Carter plan, which I helped to create and fully
endorse, is as far as we can go to raise the status of a
large number of illegal aliens now working under
extremely exploitative conditions," Castillo said.
The Carter immigration plan is a response to what
the White House sees as the problem of "increasing
entrance of illegal aliens into the United States."
Castillo said 60 per cent of these aliens have been
identified as Mexican.
The plan, if adopted by Congress would:
— Impose $1000 fines on businesses which employ
undocumented aliens.
— Grant amnesty to all illegal aliens who have been
in the Unrted States since 1977.
— Add 2000 officers to the Border Patrol and in
crease other surveillance equipment.
Criticized
After just a short introductory statement, Castillo
was criticized by members of the audience who felt
the Carter plan would not reduce exploitation of
Mexican immigrants but would only make it harder
and more dangerous for immigrants to enter the
country.
Three Chicano students then performed a short
"acto" (skit) which depicted Castillo running a
hard-working undocumented worker out of the
country.
"We feel our amnesty plan will reduce exploitation
of the Mexican migrant by allowing him to work leg
ally in the United States for up to five years," Castillo
said. He estimated that 500,000 Mexican nationals will
be able to obtain legal status.
Another concern voiced by the audience was that
the Carter plan would discriminate against Chicanos
entering the job market because employers may fear
they are illegal aliens and would be reluctant to hire
them.
"Every employer by law will be required to ask each
and every perspective employee, regardless of race,

for some sort of national identification card," Castillo
said. He said he felt this would prevent discrimination
against Chicanos.
Immigration from Mexico has been rising steadily
because the Mexican government has been unable to
control a steadily increasing unemployment rate.
Many members of the audience questioned whether
any INS program could solve the economic inequities
between Mexico and the United States which they
perceived to be the root of the problem.
"Some of Mexico's problems are due to U.S.
economic factors, but the United States is not re
sponsible forall poverty in Mexico," Castillo replied.
Easy to restrict
Castillo said he preferred to view the problem as
one of regulation and control of U.S. international
borders and added, "It would not be difficult either
technically or financially for the United States to re
strict illegal immigration to a mere fraction of what it
is today."
Sensing that his audience was predominately op
posed to the Carter plan because it seems too repres
sive, Castillo said most pressure against the plan
comes from people who feel it is "too liberal."
Hearings in Congress begin today and are
scheduled to include 63 different interest groups.
Castillo predicted "a very close vote" on acceptance
of the plan.
Equal split
He said there is an "equal split" between interest
groups who feel the plan is too harsh and those who
feel it is too lenient.
Castillo pointed to the Mexican government as one
interest group which feels the United States should
give Mexicans jobs as temporary laborers without
welfare or unemployment benefits.
"But Chicanos often times push undocumented
aliens to get on the welfare rolls," Castillo said. "Most
Mexicans I speak with, however, only want the
chance to make enough money to eat."
Legitimacy
The Carter plan will legitimize a large number of
undocumented aliens now in the country by allowing
them to work legally according to Castillo. He admit
ted, however, that these workers would not be al
lowed to receive government benefits and are sub
ject to deportation after the five-year amnesty period.
"But it is better to work under government protec
tion for five years than to continue to work illegally,"
he said.

Castillo pointed to the Mexican government as one
interest group which feels the United States should
give Mexicans jobs as temporary laborers without
welfare or unemployment benefits.
"But Chicanos often times push undocumented
aliens to get on the welfare rolls," Castillo said. "Most
Mexicans I speak with, however, only want the
chance to make enough money to eat."
Legitimacy
The Carter plan will legitimize a large number of
undocumented aliens now in the country by allowing
them to work legally according to Castillo. He admit
ted, however, that these workers would not be al
lowed to receive government benefits and are sub
ject to deportation after the five-year amnesty period.
"But it is better to work under government protec
tion for five years than to continue to work illegally,"
he said.
President Jimmy Carter's immigration plan will
help reduce the exploitation of the estimated three to
six million undocumented aliens in the United States,
according to Leonel Castillo.
Castillo is commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) and the first Chicano to
hold the top INS position. He spoke to a predomi
nately Chicano audience last night in the law school
during a public forum presented by the Chicano Law
Students Association.
"The Carter plan, which I helped to create and fully
endorse, is as far as we can go to raise the status of a
large number of illegal aliens now working under
extremely exploitative conditions," Castillo said.
The Carter immigration plan is a response to what
the White House sees as the problem of "increasing
entrance of illegal aliens into the United States."
Castillo said 60 per cent of these aliens have been
identified as Mexican.
The plan, if adopted by Congress would:
— Impose $1000 fines on businesses which employ
undocumented aliens.
— Grant amnesty to all illegal aliens who have been
in the Unrted States since 1977.
— Add 2000 officers to the Border Patrol and in
crease other surveillance equipment.
Criticized
After just a short introductory statement, Castillo
was criticized by members of the audience who felt
the Carter plan would not reduce exploitation of
Mexican immigrants but would only make it harder
and more dangerous for immigrants to enter the
country.
Three Chicano students then performed a short
"acto" (skit) which depicted Castillo running a
hard-working undocumented worker out of the
country.
"We feel our amnesty plan will reduce exploitation
of the Mexican migrant by allowing him to work leg
ally in the United States for up to five years," Castillo
said. He estimated that 500,000 Mexican nationals will
be able to obtain legal status.
Another concern voiced by the audience was that
the Carter plan would discriminate against Chicanos
entering the job market because employers may fear
they are illegal aliens and would be reluctant to hire
them.
"Every employer by law will be required to ask each
and every perspective employee, regardless of race,

for some sort of national identification card," Castillo
said. He said he felt this would prevent discrimination
against Chicanos.
Immigration from Mexico has been rising steadily
because the Mexican government has been unable to
control a steadily increasing unemployment rate.
Many members of the audience questioned whether
any INS program could solve the economic inequities
between Mexico and the United States which they
perceived to be the root of the problem.
"Some of Mexico's problems are due to U.S.
economic factors, but the United States is not re
sponsible forall poverty in Mexico," Castillo replied.
Easy to restrict
Castillo said he preferred to view the problem as
one of regulation and control of U.S. international
borders and added, "It would not be difficult either
technically or financially for the United States to re
strict illegal immigration to a mere fraction of what it
is today."
Sensing that his audience was predominately op
posed to the Carter plan because it seems too repres
sive, Castillo said most pressure against the plan
comes from people who feel it is "too liberal."
Hearings in Congress begin today and are
scheduled to include 63 different interest groups.
Castillo predicted "a very close vote" on acceptance
of the plan.
Equal split
He said there is an "equal split" between interest
groups who feel the plan is too harsh and those who
feel it is too lenient.
Castillo pointed to the Mexican government as one
interest group which feels the United States should
give Mexicans jobs as temporary laborers without
welfare or unemployment benefits.
"But Chicanos often times push undocumented
aliens to get on the welfare rolls," Castillo said. "Most
Mexicans I speak with, however, only want the
