## Trustees progressive? 
### 
Last week the chairman of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility said he was "disappointed with
the trustees' decision" to reject a unanimous CIR re
commendation and vote no on a proxy calling for
Texaco's withdrawal from South Africa.
"Disappointment" is too mild a word to describe how
we feel about the trustees' action. It appears to have
been more of the trustees' game-playing which we have
seen in the past year.
Last winter the trustees issued their unanimous
Statement on Investment Responsibility, and students
were chided for the brouhaha they raised over changes
the trustees made in the proposed statement. When the
ASSU refused to appoint students to the new CIR, ad
ministrators "appointed" students to the committee be
cause there was "work to be done on the CIR" and
because President Richard Lyman thought it important
to have student viewpoint on the CIR.
Last May 9, Peter Bing, president of the Board of Trus
tees, explained that the trustees were "simply depen
dent" on CIR recommendations.
The CIR — operating under trustee-amended

guidelines and with students appointed in a novel fash
ion — has done a thorough study on the South African
situation and found what its chairman calls an "extraor
dinary situation."
But now the trustees have apparently decided that
they know more than the CI R on South Africa. (We hope
the trustees won't claim they didn't have enough time to
study the situation — they've been using that refrain for
a year.)
As to four South Africa-related proxies, the CIR re
commended three yes votes — the trustees voted no
twice and abstained on the third — and the CIR recom
mended an abstention on the fourth — the trustees
voted against it.
If the trustees don't believe Texaco is a "negative
force" in South Africa, then perhaps some trustees
could go there to see whether Texaco is negative, prog
ressive or otherwise.
The trustees have breached the community's faith in
the CIR; we prefer not to waste any more time on this
farce. If the student CIR members feel the same, then
perhaps they should quit the CIR.
