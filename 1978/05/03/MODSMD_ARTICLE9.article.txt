# Worth risking chaos
## Jarvis-Gann initiative backed 
### 
Doug Bandow

The Jarvis-Gann initiative, even if it
fails, has already made its mark on
California. Politicians, bureaucrats,
paternalists and special interests are
all crying foul over the rising indig
nation of taxpayers — taxpayers who
feel ignored, scorned and trampled
upon.
Even the state legislature, a bastion
of big-government, spend-the
taxpayers'-money type, has been af
fected. One liberal staffer has admit
ted that: "We've gotten away with it
till now because we were so god
damn rich. We had found a way to
live without being responsible for
anything. In past years, there's been
a natural inclination to say — 'we'll
go along partly out of ignorance and
sloth.' "
The Jarvis-Gann initiative (now
Prop. 13) limits property taxes to 1
per cent of the "full cash value" of
the property from the 1975-76 tax
roll, with a maximum 2 per cent in
crease per year for inflation, and with
revisions upward if the property is
sold or changes hands. It would also
require a two-thirds vote of the legis
lature to pass new taxes, and a two
thirds vote of the "qualified elec
tors" of a locality to pass new special
taxes.
This limitation would cut local re
venues from property taxes any
where from $5 to $8 billion; $7 billion
is used most frequently. Further
more, its requirements of extraordi
nary majorities to pass new taxes
would make new taxation more dif
ficult. Though simple on its face, the
measure is ambiguous, and the
method of tax limitation is extreme.
)arvis-Gann is a meat-ax with a jagged
blade.
Some charges unfounded
Opponents are making some
charges that are simply dumb and
untrue. Among these arethat renters
will get no relief under Jarvis-Gann.
There is no explicit provision cover
ing renters, but property taxes are
just another business cost that the
rent must cover, lowering property
taxes will help alleviate the upward
pressure on rents. Furthermore, ris
ing property taxes could no longer
be used as an excuse for rising rents.
Another charge is that commercial
property — which makes up 65 per
cent of the tax base — will be getting
an unfair tax break. Again, high
property taxes are a business ex
pense that consumers pay. Consum
ers gain by lowering business costs,
and therefore costs to themselves.
However, there will be enormous
problems if it passes. For example,
the use of 1975 as the base date for
taxation, and the limit on increases
for inflation, effectively lower the
limitation below 1 per cent. Com

mercial property is generally resold
less often than residential property,
so residential property may be valued
at a higher rate. Property in the same
area of the same value may be ap
praised at different levels depending
on which was transferred when.
The 2 per cent limitation on infla
tion rate also works against property
that declines in value. Localities may
not ever be able to impose new spe
cial taxes, because of the two-thirds
voting requirement. And in allowing
reevaluation for "newly
constructed" property, it is unclear
whether additions or alterations are
covered.
Furthermore, by cutting only
property taxes, the impact of the in
itiative will vary depending on how
much reliance the given locality puts
on property taxes. Some special dis
tricts get all of their money from
property taxes; school districts get
an average of 51 per cent, cities an
average of 35 per cent, and counties
an average of 25 per cent. Thus the
impact on some districts may be de
vastating.
Compelling reasons for support
However, despite its immense
problems, I find some compelling
reasons to support it. First, the $7
billion tax cut is roughly 15 per cent
of the total combined budgets of the
state and localities (over $40 billion).
A reshuffling of those revenues is
possible; an expenditure cut of 15
per cent in our bloated government
is not unfair to ask.
Second, the Behr bill is predicated
on the passage of Prop. 8, which will
allow commercial and residential
property to be taxed at different
rates. This will only exacerbate the
tendency of the legislature to foster
economic illiteracy. In the future, the
politicians will posture and tell us
how they are sparing "the people"
the pain of new taxes by taxing busi
ness. Of course, in the end we will
pay, but the politicians will then be
able to blame "excess profits" rather
than themselves. This dangerous
phenomenon — which is already
prevalent — should not be encour
aged.
Behr bill not effective
Nor does the Behr bill affect the
fundamental course of government;
its expenditure limitations on gov
ernment are virtually meaningless,
and it does not force any long-run
reforms.
Finally, it's about time we sent the
SOB's who rule us a message. Over
the past 10 years, while the popula
tion of California was going up 14 per
cent, and the cost of living up 70 per
cent, the state budget has risen 161
per cent, property taxes have risen
128 per cent, sales tax 194 per cent,

and the state income tax 295 per cent.
This trend must be halted, and re
versed.
Our rulers have refused to hold
down government spending. They
have refused to cut waste. They have
refused to give the surplus of our tax
money back. And they've managed
to defeat prior attempts at meaning
ful tax and government expenditure
reform. We shouldn't take it any
longer — passage of )arvis-Gann
would force our rulers to freeze
budgets and hiring, to cut non
essential services, to reorder
priorities, and to trim back state
mandated programs. If a meat ax is all
we've got, we should wield it.
Best in the long run
David Clayton, a trustee of the
Cupertino School Board, which
voted to endorse Jarvis-Gann,
explained that: "If it was the only way
we would get tax reform, and we had
to close (the schools) while the legis
lature got their act together, I think it
would be in the interest of my kids.
Because as things are now, my kids
are going to graduate from high
school someday and not be able to
buy a house."
This, then, is the best reason for
voting for )arvis-Gann. For too long
we have been facing the metastasiz
ing regulation and control of a run
away government. A. Alan Post, ,the
retired legislative analyst, has ob
served that Jarvis-Gann "would liter
ally create chaos; it would alter the
structure, the priorities and the re
sponsibilities of local government to
the citizens it serves." If chaos is
necessary to alter the course of gov
ernment, so be it; it is about time that
we tell our rulers that there really is
no such thing as a free lunch.

an average of 25 per cent. Thus the
impact on some districts may be de
vastating.
Compelling reasons for support
However, despite its immense
problems, I find some compelling
reasons to support it. First, the $7
billion tax cut is roughly 15 per cent
of the total combined budgets of the
state and localities (over $40 billion).
A reshuffling of those revenues is
possible; an expenditure cut of 15
per cent in our bloated government
is not unfair to ask.
Second, the Behr bill is predicated
on the passage of Prop. 8, which will
allow commercial and residential
property to be taxed at different
rates. This will only exacerbate the
tendency of the legislature to foster
economic illiteracy. In the future, the
politicians will posture and tell us
how they are sparing "the people"
the pain of new taxes by taxing busi
ness. Of course, in the end we will
pay, but the politicians will then be
able to blame "excess profits" rather
than themselves. This dangerous
phenomenon — which is already
prevalent — should not be encour
aged.
Behr bill not effective
Nor does the Behr bill affect the
fundamental course of government;
its expenditure limitations on gov
ernment are virtually meaningless,
and it does not force any long-run
reforms.
Finally, it's about time we sent the
SOB's who rule us a message. Over
the past 10 years, while the popula
tion of California was going up 14 per
cent, and the cost of living up 70 per
cent, the state budget has risen 161
per cent, property taxes have risen
128 per cent, sales tax 194 per cent,

and the state income tax 295 per cent.
This trend must be halted, and re
versed.
Our rulers have refused to hold
down government spending. They
have refused to cut waste. They have
refused to give the surplus of our tax
money back. And they've managed
to defeat prior attempts at meaning
ful tax and government expenditure
reform. We shouldn't take it any
longer — passage of )arvis-Gann
would force our rulers to freeze
budgets and hiring, to cut non
essential services, to reorder
priorities, and to trim back state
mandated programs. If a meat ax is all
we've got, we should wield it.
Best in the long run
David Clayton, a trustee of the
Cupertino School Board, which
voted to endorse Jarvis-Gann,
explained that: "If it was the only way
we would get tax reform, and we had
to close (the schools) while the legis
lature got their act together, I think it
would be in the interest of my kids.
Because as things are now, my kids
are going to graduate from high
school someday and not be able to
buy a house."
This, then, is the best reason for
voting for )arvis-Gann. For too long
we have been facing the metastasiz
ing regulation and control of a run
away government. A. Alan Post, ,the
retired legislative analyst, has ob
served that Jarvis-Gann "would liter
ally create chaos; it would alter the
structure, the priorities and the re
sponsibilities of local government to
the citizens it serves." If chaos is
necessary to alter the course of gov
ernment, so be it; it is about time that
we tell our rulers that there really is
no such thing as a free lunch.

The Jarvis-Gann initiative, even if it
fails, has already made its mark on
California. Politicians, bureaucrats,
paternalists and special interests are
all crying foul over the rising indig
nation of taxpayers — taxpayers who
feel ignored, scorned and trampled
upon.
Even the state legislature, a bastion
of big-government, spend-the
taxpayers'-money type, has been af
fected. One liberal staffer has admit
ted that: "We've gotten away with it
till now because we were so god
damn rich. We had found a way to
live without being responsible for
anything. In past years, there's been
a natural inclination to say — 'we'll
go along partly out of ignorance and
sloth.' "
The Jarvis-Gann initiative (now
Prop. 13) limits property taxes to 1
per cent of the "full cash value" of
the property from the 1975-76 tax
roll, with a maximum 2 per cent in
crease per year for inflation, and with
revisions upward if the property is
sold or changes hands. It would also
require a two-thirds vote of the legis
lature to pass new taxes, and a two
thirds vote of the "qualified elec
tors" of a locality to pass new special
taxes.
This limitation would cut local re
venues from property taxes any
where from $5 to $8 billion; $7 billion
is used most frequently. Further
more, its requirements of extraordi
nary majorities to pass new taxes
would make new taxation more dif
ficult. Though simple on its face, the
measure is ambiguous, and the
method of tax limitation is extreme.
)arvis-Gann is a meat-ax with a jagged
blade.
Some charges unfounded
Opponents are making some
charges that are simply dumb and
untrue. Among these arethat renters
will get no relief under Jarvis-Gann.
There is no explicit provision cover
ing renters, but property taxes are
just another business cost that the
rent must cover, lowering property
taxes will help alleviate the upward
pressure on rents. Furthermore, ris
ing property taxes could no longer
be used as an excuse for rising rents.
Another charge is that commercial
property — which makes up 65 per
cent of the tax base — will be getting
an unfair tax break. Again, high
property taxes are a business ex
pense that consumers pay. Consum
ers gain by lowering business costs,
and therefore costs to themselves.
However, there will be enormous
problems if it passes. For example,
the use of 1975 as the base date for
taxation, and the limit on increases
for inflation, effectively lower the
limitation below 1 per cent. Com

mercial property is generally resold
less often than residential property,
so residential property may be valued
at a higher rate. Property in the same
area of the same value may be ap
praised at different levels depending
on which was transferred when.
The 2 per cent limitation on infla
tion rate also works against property
that declines in value. Localities may
not ever be able to impose new spe
cial taxes, because of the two-thirds
voting requirement. And in allowing
reevaluation for "newly
constructed" property, it is unclear
whether additions or alterations are
covered.
Furthermore, by cutting only
property taxes, the impact of the in
itiative will vary depending on how
much reliance the given locality puts
on property taxes. Some special dis
tricts get all of their money from
property taxes; school districts get
an average of 51 per cent, cities an
average of 35 per cent, and counties
an average of 25 per cent. Thus the
impact on some districts may be de
vastating.
