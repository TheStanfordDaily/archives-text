I "THE BIGGEST PLUS FACTOR . .

That's what Doug Gait, Finance Manager of the Phi Delt Fraternity said to
Mark Triska, the Stanford Community Representative for Northern
California Savings and Loan Association.
"Probably the biggest plus factor of a NCS savings account is the Tele
phone Transfer Service, allowing our house to make the highest interest
rate possible up to the date at which we'll need our money transferred to
our checking account. It makes money for us and saves me time. The Palo
Alto branch office is one of the closest savings and loans around, and its
hours are great. It's also nice to have an on-campus representative availa
ble, to help us set up further accounts and to fill me in on the many different
accounts and services that NCS has to offer our house."
Remember, Mark is just a phone call away.
