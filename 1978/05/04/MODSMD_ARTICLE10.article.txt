# Minorities and ecological living
## Humanity at a turning point 
### 
Amy Pinkerton

Not many people have discussed
the relationship between minorities,
women and ecological living. But
ecology is perhaps the best way to
achieve social and economic equality
for women and minorities, and at the
same time improve health, general
economics, and the environment.
Ecological practices tend to be
labor-intensive — more and better
jobs are what these groups need.
Many of them use low
intermediate-technology skills and
methods, so they are perfect for the
less-educated, or when money for
training programs is not available.
Plus they do not require large
amounts of capital to get started.
Most of them also do not require
much heavy physical labor, and thus
more women can do them.
Biodynamic-French Intensive
(8.F.1.) agriculture, as practiced by
Ecology Action/Common Ground of
Palo Alto and others, is a particularly
good, highly-productive ecological
method, and can give a good means
of support to anyone who will take
the short time to learn and arrange to
use or rent some land. Other exam
ples are alternative energy sources
and recycling.
Minorities and women are now
being unfairly trapped by the system.
Minorities are denied equal educa
tion if they live in poor areas (for un
fortunately schools are paid for
largely through local property taxes
rather than through the state or fed
eral government). Women face sub
tle discrimination, lack of child care
and lack of political representation.
Everyone benefits
Misguided women still fail to sup
port the Equal Rights Amendment, a
ban on discrimination based on sex
only (note the emphasis — women
can still have protective laws if they
need them, and only the strongest
women would be chosen to do the

most physical jobs; the ERA would
also grant more equal rights to men,
which present laws sometimes fail to
do).
Poor women are denied the usual
federal health benefits when it
comes to abortion, or their right to
not have a child should contracep
tives not be available. The system
continues to be too slow to change
and women and minorities continue
to suffer.
Thus, one of the best ways for
equal rights to be gained is for
women and minorities to band to
gether in support of ecological/
appropriate technology practices.
They can also band together directly
and form alternative businesses,
communities, schools or organiza
tions. I encourage all people in
terested in minorities, women or
the poor to support ecological prac
tices, communes, child care, etc.
Critical period
Let's start now! This is a critical
period in the earth's history — not
because we're suddenly all dying of
smog, but more because world strife
and economic decline contribute to

the very real possibility of a nuclear
war or a terrorist incident killing
many people and injuring the genes
of many more. Also, these groups
have been oppressed for so long,
and we finally have the means to
change the situation. Please help out
the cause!
Yesterday was "Sun Day" around
the world, in which we educated
people about solar energy and tried to
get the politicians to do something
(the solar budget was cut this year by
James Schlesinger and Carter to only
3 per cent of the Dept. of Energy's
budget — only one-fourth the
budget for nuclear energy). On Sun
Day the petroleum and nuclear age
was announced economically, so
cially and for health reasons, dead.
Environmental Action has issued a
Declaration of Solar Independence,
modelled after the real one, and
formal public signings are being ar
ranged! Also, Ernest Callenbach has
written a great novel on an egalita
rian, ecological, steady-state
America of the future, called
"Ecotopia," which could be a vision
for many.

Promoting ecological ideas in
other countries could be one of the
best ways to bolster human rights
and equality in those countries, for
the economic-labor reasons already
mentioned. So let's offer South Af
rica, Russia, and South America al
ternative energy, organic agricul
ture, recycling and birth control
methods, and watch social change
begin to happen! And we can set an
example. Also, more education, jobs
and power for women and oppres
sed groups would help out popula
tion problems. For women will have
less children if they have other things
to do, and poor people have less
need to have children for old-age in
surance.
Help make Stanford and Palo Alto
more ecological. Talk about it in your
classes and with your friends and pa
rents. One person may not seem
very effective, but you can start a
chain reaction of publicity for good
ideas. Humanity is at the turning
point now. What do you choose,
Utopia or oblivion?
