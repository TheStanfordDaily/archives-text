Media is biased
A statement has been repeatedly
reiterated during the past few weeks
to the effect that a "media conspi
racy" exists for the purpose of ignor
ing progressive movements in
America, and for pitting various
members of an oppressed class
against one another.
What I feel is important to re
member is that there is a systematic
bias working to preserve the status

quo in America. As only one exam
ple, witness the Daily's response (4/
23/78) regarding similar charges of
conspiracy: "In this case, itwas unin
tentional oversight that the first Gay
People's Union event that the Daily
felt worthy of coverage in recent
months was not covered."
I can accept that the Daily's over
sight was "unintentional," not be
cause I believe it, but because proof
of intention (like conspiracy) is dif

ficult to ferret out. However, does
not the fact that the Daily has the
power to decide what is "worthy of
coverage" imply the threshold over
which bias can cross? That it does so
is something I take to be obvious —
the media will necessarily reflect the
ideas of a dominant class of the soci
ety to which it (the media) belongs.
