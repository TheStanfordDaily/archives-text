# Pleasures of Sun Valley include more than skiing
## 
### Nancy Rivenburgh 
Sun Valley, Idaho — a place where it's hard
not to have a good time. Locals, seasonals and
tourists all faithfully patronize its ski slopes,
tennis courts and bars throughout the year.
The average age in Sun Valley is about 25 and
the average color is "very tan." These numerous
young, or at least young-at-heart, bring en
thusiasm and gaiety to the area.
Since the resort was founded in the mid-1930s
by Averell Harriman, chairman of the board of
the Union Pacific Railroad, Sun Valley has grown
and flourished from a ski resort to a year-round
playground for pleasure-oriented people.
Best skiing
Tucked high up in the Rocky Mountains,
somewhat isolated in the middle of Idaho, Sun
Valley provides some of the best skiing in the
country — maybe the world. The Sun Valley
resorts offer more than 50 ski runs with the
choice of easy or difficult runs, pack or powder
snow. From the gentle slopes of Dollar moun
tain's face to the towering moguls of Baldy's
Exhibition run, Sun Valley's terrain rarely disap
points anyone.
But a weekend ski run is not the only reason to
go to Sun Valley. People head to the resort for a
vacation, a season, or even forever for the
sports, scenery and good living.
Under the dry, hot Sun Valley sun one can
play golf on one of two large 18-hole courses, or
tennis on more than the 100 courts in Sun Valley,
and the neighboring areas of Ketchum, Elkhorn
and Warm Springs. There is also swimming,

horseback riding, biking, sailing and ice skating
both indoors and out. It's only a short trip to
nearby rivers, where fishing, kayaking and raft
ing is possible. And there are plenty of places to
backpack and to rock climb on the jetting Saw
tooth mountains.
The arts
For those more inclined toward the arts, the
Sun Valley Arts and Crafts center offers excel
lent opportunities to work on photography,
ceramics, painting, dance or literature (re
member this was Ernest Hemingway's home).
So you'd like to go? Accommodations range
from campgrounds to condominiums, with an
abundance of the latter. But one step into the
Pioneer Bar or Elkhorn Saloon crowded with
young people every night of the year, shows
students seem to have little problem finding
inexpensive lodgings.
Shops and bars
In addition to the delightful mixture of re
staurants, there are lots of shops and bars, all of
which capture the casual, western atmosphere
of the Sun Valley area.
Plenty of entertainment and pleasant com
pany is available nightly at bars like Elevation
6000, the Ram or Mulvaneys. And even ski-sore
muscles seem to be able to dance a few numbers
at the end of the evening.
A day in Sun Valley cannot help but end in
utter exhaustion; with all the exercise, good
food and a little dance. But it's a good kind of
exhaustion, the kind that makes Sun Valley fam
ous.
