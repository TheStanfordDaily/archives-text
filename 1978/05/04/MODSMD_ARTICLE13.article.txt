# Fashion buffs fascinated by unusual used clothing
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
Those dainty, white lacy
dresses of the Victorian Age
and grandpa's tuxedo shirts
have been yanked from faded
family photos to the center of a
fashion impulse that champ
ions old clothes.
In New York, well-known
department stores like Macy's
and Abraham & Straus are in
corporating used clothes de
partments to compete with the
second-hand shops popping
up all over the city.
A Los Angeles-based chain
called Judy's has introduced
vintage clothing in its spring
line t047 boutiques around the
Southwest. And in Boston and
Dallas, second-hand chic has
become prime merchandise in
the trendy shops.
Foreign buyers
In Europe and Japan, an en
chantment with America's
hand-me-downs has brought
foreign buyers to the same auc

tions, flea markets and
wholesale houses as New York
shoppers looking for vintage
outfits.
Vests from 10- and 20-year
old suits are the rage for men
and women, as are gabardine
shirts and pleated pants for a
combined Punk-Annie Hall
look especially popular on the
West Coast.
For New Yorkers, delicate
silks and crepes, handmade
piano shawls, beaded blouses
and pastel satin underwear
trimmed in lace are big items
that cost half what comparable
goods do on Fifth Avenue. Day
dresses from the '30s and '40s
can be bought for $30 to $45,
while modern outfits of like
quality cost upwards of $100.
Unusual pieces
Catherine Haase, a shop
keeper at "One Woman" here,
said some of the unusual
pieces, say a silk shawl em
broidered with bright roses,
would be most compatible
with a "theatrical" person â€”
"someone who likes to be dif
ferent people different days of
the week."
New York shopowners say
they are performing a service
by rescuing wearable clothes,

then cleaning and mending
them.
West Coast boutiques, on
the other hand, keep holes,
original multicolor patches and
other defects intact and sell the
used clothes at about the same
price as new merchandise.
Big and baggy
All kinds of hats and garish
Hawaiian print shirts made in
Japan 30 years ago are other
popular items with people who
like to dress big and baggy. Old
shoes also are "in" and occa
sionally pairs that have never
been worn turn up in stores
that have searched storage
areas.
Joan Crawford's '40s high
heels, purchased from the late
actress' estate, are the key item
at Classic Clothes in mid-town
Manhattan. Owner Cene Mur
phy said he'll save a dozen of
the most spectacular
custom-made pairs, all with
matching handbags, for a
museum, but has about 20
pairs on sale for memorabilia
hounds.
How long the current fash
ion will last, given the demand
for a limited quantity of goods,
remains an unanswered ques
tion.
