## Study shows big buyers are older Teens are not big record buyers 
### 
From (he Associated Press
The booming U.S. record business, ac
cording to an industry legend, became the
biggest of all show businesses because
American parents never tire of giving their
teenyboppers enough loot to keep Shaun
Cassidy, Peter Frampton, et al, living in
high style.
But a startling industry survey recently
released shows that the basic premise of
the demographics-minded industry is
false:
It is not, the study says, mostly teen
agers who have been oiling the wheels of
the thundering record business, but their
older brothers and sisters and their pa
rents.
Who is buying
The study, commissioned by the giant
Warner Communications Inc., purports to
be the first thorough, scientific examina
tion of just who is buying those vinyl discs
to the tune of $3 billion a year.
Customers who buy rock music are far
and away the industry's biggest spenders,
and it has always been supposed that kids
in the 10- to 19 age bracket were the bulk of
those buyers.

When Shaun Cassidy or Kiss got those
teen juices flowing, record bosses seemed
to believe, relief came in the form of a trip
to the record store.
Biggest buying block
But the survey, "establishes as myth"
that assumption, showing that while kids
10 to 19 account for 28 per cent of all re
cord purchases, the 25 to 44 year -old por
tion of our population accounts for a
whopping 38 per cent of prerecorded
music purchases. The 20 to 24 year-old
group is the biggest single purchasing
block, making 22 per cent of the total re
cord purchases.
"The day the survey came out, we didn't
stop shipping Shaun Cassidy, I can tell you
that," Warner's Bob Merlin said Friday.
"But we did start thinking about broaden
ing his market. We found out there are
people over 20 who like him."
Shift sales pitch
Merlin said the findings of the survey
would likely have some effect "further
down the line," probably in shifting of the
sales pitch to an older audience.
"But I don't think the company is saying,
'Let's go out and sign Perry Como.' It used

to be that the record business was strictly
teensville, but now you can't count on that
any more, cause there aren't that many
teens. So, we work on getting those older
people who buy records to buy our re-
Cords."
In a sense, the data is good news for the
industry. Demographic charts show the
U.S. teen-age population will drop by
neary nearly six million from 1977 figures
by 1985, a projection which would have
spelled bad news for the record industry if
teens were in fact the biggest record
buyers.
More customers
But the industry's high-rolling custom
ers, the 25- to 44 year-olds, will be growing
in size by 1985, up nearly 13 million from
1977 figures, suggesting that if buying pat
terns remain relatively stable, "the pre
recorded music industry has nothing to
fear from the shifting demographics in the
U.S. population," the survey said. •—
The survey, based on face-to-face inter
views with 3,385 respondents, was drawn
up by University of Illinois researcher Dr.
Martin Fishbein and conducted by Na
tional Analysts research firm.
