Spring used to be the time
when galleries and museums
would put on shows of "lesser
interest." Not so any more, if
exhibits at the San Francisco.
Museum of Modern Art are any
indication.
The first show of note, one
that demands and deserves the
viewer's attention, is a retros
pective of the art of hand
bookbinding. While this
sounds rather dull and
academic as a topic, the books
are colorful, imaginative, and
of a consistently high caliber in
craft.
Hand bookbinding is cer
tainly a rarity in a world accus
tomed to slick paperback.
Nonetheless, the art is prac
tised throughout the world.

Typical materials tor the covers
include leather, quality papers,
textiles, and metal leaf. One
book was covered by wooden
dolls and objects, like a minia
ture Rauschenberg combine.
Motifs for the design may be
inspired by the title, the text or
be pure abstraction. In many
cases, the artist also designed
and printed the text. Some
covers were conventional, but
done with great care. Others,
like a six volume version of
Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings,"
were so stunning that we need
not bother with the text!
It was an exciting and re
freshing show, certainly a tour
de force for these artists who
seldom receive recognition for
their work except among peers

and fine book collectors.
Collecting of another kind
was the focus of a second dis
play. The Museum's perma
nent collection of over 1500
photographs, one of the oldest
museum collections of the
medium, is represented by 274
prints by more artists than can
be summarily named.
Most of the collection has
been acquired under the aegis
of curator John Humphrey, for
whom this show is a tribute.
Humphrey's emphasis was
primarily on 20th century
American artists, but has ex
panded to include works from
other countries and from the
19th century.
One can say little about this
show without veering upon the
encyclopedic. One weakness
was the unfortunate lack of a
catalogue or wall labels with
basic biographical data. How
ever, for those conversant in
the medium's history, it is an
excellent survey, with not a few
surprises.
For example, how often can
one see an early Ansel Adams'
print, one not perfectly
crafted, stunning and mag
nificant? Beginning photo
graphy students, take heart!
All joking aside, a number of
images about master photo
graphers and their work were
jolted. A rock study by Imogen
Cunningham in 1961 was to
tally unexpected, very rare for
her concerns, and the sort of
thing one expects from Edward
Weston in the 19305. Brett
Weston's "Magnolia Bud,"
1927, was one of many plant
studies by a number of artists
contemporaneous with Cun
ningham's better known plant
images.
The show was thematically
rich because of these rarely
seen works, and also because
the prints were installed with
an eye to pattern and con
tinuity, but not clear-cut
categories. The works were

hung chronologically when
suitable, but this sequence was
dropped when two images
complimented each other re
gardless of author, date or
country. The variety and rich
ness of the medium, the repeti
tion of concerns, and the cross
currents of sensibility from era
to era was well demonstrated.
Too bad so much was left un
answered due to a lack of basic
identification.
If you've stayed with me up
to this point, and are simply
bursting with enthusiasm for
another great group retrospec
tive, wander down to the
Museum's third floor galleries.
At your own risk, that is.
Something called "The
Aesthetics of Grafitti" has been
installed at the S.F.M.M.A. I
confess, I could not bring my
self to read the introductory
note at the entrance. I was de
voting all my energy to reassur
ing myself that this was not re
ally the art of the 19705.
Well, what can I say? Every
thing you ever imagined that
art is not is probably included
in this show. Some of it might
be worth your attention if you
have the stamina. It's a great
place to take young kids if you
want to demonstrate that van
dalism is bad except when
done by or for artists. They'll
tell you you're nuts!
But then, I just may be
hopelessly conservative. I was
amused by William T. Wiley's
"I hope you've learned your
lesson," a print of this message
scrawled on a blackboard over
the faintly legible "I hope
you've burned your lesson." It
was a toss-up.
In any event, the
S.F.M.M.A., located at McAllis
ter and Van Ness, has not al
lowed spring fever to set in. Be
sure to check with the Museum
for hours and show dates since
all three exhibits will be on
view for different lengths of
time.
