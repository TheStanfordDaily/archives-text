A two-story, 4000 square-foot addition to the Bechtel
International Center is scheduled for completion in
mid-June, according to Lee Zeigler, Bechtel director.
The addition, located behind Bechtel and adjacent to
Lagunita Drive, will include an assembly room, two
seminar rooms and program and office space, Zeigler
said.
Estimated cost of the new construction and surround
ing landscaping is $318,000, he said.
"When the work is finished we'll have a total facility to
accommodate a variety of programs," Zeigler said.
Funds for the construction came from a grant by
Stephen Bechtel, former director of the Bechtel Corpo
ration and Stanford trustee from 1960 to 1964. Bechtel
provided funds in 1961 to reestablish an international
center here after the original had burned down.
The original International Center, located between
the post office and Lathrop house, was built in 1957 as a
meeting place for foreign students and visitors and

Americans.
Current landscaping around the new addition is being
financed by the Lane family, owners of Sunset publica
tions and books, Zeigler said. They have been active at
the Center for many years, he said.
"At the moment, the Center is in active use and there
is no larger place to hold meetings than the center's
dining room," he said.
The new assembly room has a capacity of 132, twice
that of the dining room, he added.
The original june 1 completion date was delayed by
rain, he said. The landscaping should be finished by
mid-summer, and the entire facility will be fully operable
next autumn, he said.
The University has insisted that the architecture of the
addition match that of the present building, Zeigler said.
Zeigler said the addition will help the Center provide
"more programs and better services.
"Stanford has one of the best facilities in international
programs, and this will make it better," he said.
