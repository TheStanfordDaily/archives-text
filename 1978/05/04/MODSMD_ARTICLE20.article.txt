## Sung-Ju Lee: young, first-rate 
### 
Last Friday evening the Lively
Arts' auspicious season came
to a close with the equally au
spicious appearances of the
young Korean violinist Sung-Ju
Lee with pianist David Oei
here.
The concert got to a rather
shaky start with Handel's
Sonata No. 5 in A for Violin and
continuo. The performance
was doomed from the start by
the instrumentation: much as
one may try, a piano cannot im
itate a harpsichord, and
neither can a modern violin
substitute for its softer, less
brilliant Baroque relative. This
was not helped by Lee's play
ing which had a dryness and
brittleness more befitting Pen
derecki or Henze than Handel.
However, a remarkable
transformation took place in
the Sonata in C for Violin and
Piano, Op. 78, by Brahms.
Suddenly both violinist and
pianist came into their own and
delivered an immaculate per

formance. With none of her
previous dessication, Sung-Ju
Lee gave a rich and lyrical in
terpretation, yet one suffused
throughout with a powerful
sense of drama. David Oei also
gave a fine showing, playing
nis solo passages with gusto
and considerable theatrical
flair, but without ever over
shadowing the violin.
The high point of the prog
ram was definitely Bach's Un
accompanied Sonata No. 2 in
Am. The audience was treated
here to an exceptionally re
fined and dignified perfor
mance, each movement re
flecting the violinist's profound
understanding of the work.
Afteran achievement of such
power, the rest of the evening
was almost a let-down. While
Tchaikovsky's Melodie and
Waltz-Scherzo, as well as the
two encores, consisting of a
painful transcription for violin
and piano of Chopin's Nocture
in C-m and Kreisler's vacuous

Liebeslied, were all well
played, it would appear that
nothing can really help these
bits of musical trivia.
Finally, mention should be
made of some of the other
programs of the Lively Arts. In
addition to the regular con
certs, such as the one discus
sed above, the Lively Arts also
sponsors informal mini
concerts for senior citizens
groups, schools, community
centers and the like. I was able
to attend such a concert given
April 26 at the International
Center by Sung-Ju Lee and
David Oei. Unfortunately they
had already given another con
cert and completed a long
plane flight that day, and so
were suitably exhausted. Still,
she gave beautiful and techni
cally flawless performances of
Paganini's Caprices No. 5 and
No. 9. This was contrasted with
insipid renditions of
Tchaikovsky's Melodie, the
first movement of the Bach

Sonata, arid a proper dose of
sentimental treakle in
Kreisler's Liebeslied and
Liebesfreude. The event gave
an enjoyable opportunity to
meet the artists, and the Lively
Arts are to be commended for
their efforts in this direction.
Overall, it is clear that at 21
Sung-Ju Lee is already a first
rate performer. Besides having
an incredible technical com
mand of her instrument, she
displays a depth in her playing
worthy of someone many years
her elder. Her sole weakness
lies in her programming. By
her own admission she opens
and closes her programs with
some "lighter pieces," here
the Handel (!) and the
Tchaikovsky; and sure
enough, these were the least
satisfying parts of the concert.
David Oei too, is a distin
guished pianist. With this I
wish both much successâ€” but
please, no more Kreisler.
