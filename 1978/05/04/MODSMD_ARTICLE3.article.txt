# Rush successful as houses fill quotas

This year's spring Fraternity Rush
was very successful, according to
Mark Triska, Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC) rush chairman.
Most fraternities had no trouble
with attendance at open houses,
Triska said. More serious rushees at
tended than in past years, he said.
The return of sororities was cited by
Triska as the main reason for the suc
cess of this year's rush.
"The presence of sororities pro
duced a 'different outlook' among
rushees," said john Gomez, Alpha
Delta Phi fraternity rush chairman.
Pre-rush activity in individual
fraternities caused more potential
rushees to think about fraternities
before official rush activities began,
Triska said. Students may be under
going a general trend toward more
traditional values and fraternities as
symbols of tradition, may be in
volved in that trend, he said.
More freshmen are becoming in
creasingly aware of the lack of free
dom of choice in the draw system
and are attracted to the possibility of
having a say in where they will live
from year to year, Triska said.
The return of Lake Lagunita may
have attracted more rushees to the
lakeside fraternities, specifically
Alpha Delta Phi, Zeta Psi and Kappa
Alpha, Gomez said.
Triska said he felt the fraternity sys
tem as a whole will fulfill its
university-assigned quotas for stu
dents joining and living in houses.
Under the guaranteed housing
plan quota system, fraternities are
required to pledge their share of cur
rent unmarried male freshmen and
transfer students. Because frater
nities contain 16.5 per cent of the
3408 non-freshman housing spaces

on campus they are required to
house 16.3 per cent of all returning
sophomores and transfers.
The fraternity quota is calculated at
239.5 "sophomore equivalents,"
persons with two guaranteed years
left on campus. A person with one
guaranteed year of housing left is
counted as half a sophomore equiva
lent.
Once the figure of 239.5 is deter
mined as the overall quota for the
fraternity system, specific fraternities
are allotted their share of the quota,
based on their per cent of total
fraternity occupancy.
If a fraternity falls short of its al
loted quota, the fraternity advisor for
the Office of Residential Education
assists the house in determining a
plan to increase house occupancy.
This plan may include rushing au
tumn transfer students.
If a fraternity fails to fill its quota for
three out of four consecutive years,
house officers and fraternity alumni
meet with representatives of the Of
fice of Residential Education to de
termine if the house should enterthe
University draw system.
Alpha Delta Phi is the only house
which must fill its quota this year or
face the possibility of entering the
draw, Triska said. Gomez said he be
lieved his house would fill its quota,
though it could be difficult.
Burt Etling, rush chairman for
Theta Xi fraternity, another house
which has had problems filling its
quota in the past, said he felt his
fraternity would fill its quota. How
ever, he said it was "going to be
close."
If a fraternity does not meet its
quota, it will make efforts to pledge
transfer students who arrive next fall,
who may be counted toward the
quota fulfillment.
