Leading officials support jet sale
Washington — The nation's leading diplomatic
and military officials told Congress yesterday the
pending sale of jet fighters to Israel, Saudi Arabia
and Egypt will enhance Israel's security, not im
peril it.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, Defense Secret
ary Harold Brown and Air Force Gen. David Jones,
acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called
the proposal a step toward peace in the Middle
East and "vitally important" to U.S. interests there.
The trio, testifying before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, opened the Carter ad
ministration's formal defense of the war planes
sales. President Jimmy Carter wants to sell 60 F-15
jet fighters to Saudi Arabia, 75 F-16s and 15 F-15s to
Israel and 50 less sophisticated F-5Es to Egypt.
Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Howard
Baker (R-Tenn.) said he personally approves of the
most controversial element of the sales plan — the
sale of the F-15s to Saudi Arabia.
Mail delays increased
Washington — The use of machines instead of
humans to sort mail is leading to increases in the
number of letters routed to the wrong city and
subsequent delays in delivery, the Postal Service
says.
A Postal Service survey of intercity mail handled
in 30 facilities found 2.2 per cent of the letters were
directed to the wrong cities — often to cities in
other parts of the country, Senior Assistant Post
master General E.V. Dorsey has told the Postal
Service board.
"As an example, a letter from New York City to
Washington might wind up in Cleveland. You then
have to send it from Cleveland to Washington. It
will be at least one day late," he said.
Revolution area attracts tourists
Kabul, Afghanistan — The revolution that littered
streets with bodies, rubble and the hulks of
burned-out tanks has become a tourist attraction
in this old caravan city of bazaars and minarets.
Where rebel and loyalist soldiers fought to the
death just six daysago, colorful queues of ordinary
Afghans shuffle in to the presidential palace for a
glimpse of the opulent rooms from which Presi
dent Mohammed Daoud ruled the country for five
years.
The curious thousands file past troops of the
Communist-led Revolutionary Council, which last
week deposed Daoud and killed him, his family
and many of his supporters, and past the charred
remains of armored vehicles, now festooned with

garlands of flowers, eerie reminders of the two
days of death and destruction.
Authoritative sources said as many as 10,000
persons may have been killed, but the casualty toll
could not be independently confirmed. The rebels
reported originally that 200 were killed.
Moslems and U.N. forces clash
Tyre, Lebanon — "I have never seen a battle so
confused like it. There was shooting everywhere,
and everyone was shooting at everyone."
A French army spokesman yesterday thus de
scribed a series of clashes between Moslem ex
tremists and U.N. forces in which a Senegalese
soldier, two French troops and a Palestinian were
killed.
Twelve French soldiers were wounded in the
fighting Tuesday night, and the spokesman, Capt.
Jean Menegaux, said "many gunmen" were killed.
French U.N. forces in southern Lebanon beefed
up their positions yesterday following the fighting,
which began when the Moslem extremists am
bushed a French patrol.
Menegaux said the two-hour battle was the
worst since the U.N. Security Council dispatched
troops to southern Lebanon last month.
Scouts seek special handicap rank
North Brunswick, N.J. — Steven Cerbasi and
Frank Burrell, Boy Scouts who have muscular dys
trophy, wanted to be Eagle Scouts. So their scout
master tried to work out a way: instead of hikes
and endurance tests, they took and passed oral
tests.
But the Boy Scouts of America then said they
can't be Eagle Scouts after all — and now the na
tional headquarters is adamant about denying
them the special rank.
"You can't say tell me, when the book states
show me," spokesman Thomas Dew summed up
the rules yesterday at national Boy Scout head
quarters here.
Dew said it is possible the organization will wind
up creating special badges for handicapped teen
agers instead — "one of several ideas" to revise
policy. But even if adopted, that won't satisfy the
two handicapped youths' scoutmaster, 76-year
old Edward Mattern.
"Special awards mean nothing. They earned an
Eagle," Mattern said.
Pilot unaware of Russian location
Seoul, South Korea — The pilot of a Korean Air
Lines jet forced down over the Soviet Union April
20 said yesterday he didn't know he was in Russian
airspace until his co-pilot saw a Russian fighter
with its red star insignia.

Pilot Kim Chang-kyu and navigator Lee-shik re
turned yesterday from Paris. The Soviets, who had
detained them for questioning, released them
Sunday.
Kim declined to go into details of the incident,
saying the plane's "black box" flight recorder was
confiscated by the Russians and he and his
navigator were still recovering from shock.
He said the Russians denied him permission to
copy the Boeing 707's flight records before he was
released.
The plane strayed into Soviet air space while on
a polar flight from Paris to Seoul via Anchorage,
Alaska. Two passengers were killed and 10 injured
when the Russian jet fired on the KAL plane, blow
ing a grapefruit-sized hole in the fuselage.
Labor fight stops produce delivery
San Francisco — Several produce delivery trucks
were forced to leave the San Francisco Produce
Terminal without being unloaded yesterday be
cause of a long-simmering labor dispute, the ter
minal reported.
At the same time, as many as 20 big trucks were
reported to have backed up in long lines at the
Golden Gate Produce Terminal in South San Fran
cisco over the same dispute.
San Francisco terminal manager George Con
stant said his staff reported to him that the trucks
were turned around fully loaded. Constant said he
wasn't certain about the number of trucks in
volved.
"Say several," Constant said.
"This is the first time it's happened here," he
added.
Police said they were aware of the problem, but
had no knowledge of any trouble.

Dow Jones down 11.35
New York — The stock market tumbled steeply

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial and blue
chip stocks fell 11.35 points to 828.83, recording its
largest single-day drop in nearly four months.

Pilot unaware of Russian location
Seoul, South Korea — The pilot of a Korean Air
Lines jet forced down over the Soviet Union April
20 said yesterday he didn't know he was in Russian
airspace until his co-pilot saw a Russian fighter
with its red star insignia.

Pilot Kim Chang-kyu and navigator Lee-shik re
turned yesterday from Paris. The Soviets, who had
detained them for questioning, released them
Sunday.
Kim declined to go into details of the incident,
saying the plane's "black box" flight recorder was
confiscated by the Russians and he and his
navigator were still recovering from shock.
He said the Russians denied him permission to
copy the Boeing 707's flight records before he was
released.
The plane strayed into Soviet air space while on
a polar flight from Paris to Seoul via Anchorage,
Alaska. Two passengers were killed and 10 injured
when the Russian jet fired on the KAL plane, blow
ing a grapefruit-sized hole in the fuselage.
Labor fight stops produce delivery
San Francisco — Several produce delivery trucks
were forced to leave the San Francisco Produce
Terminal without being unloaded yesterday be
cause of a long-simmering labor dispute, the ter
minal reported.
At the same time, as many as 20 big trucks were
reported to have backed up in long lines at the
Golden Gate Produce Terminal in South San Fran
cisco over the same dispute.
San Francisco terminal manager George Con
stant said his staff reported to him that the trucks
were turned around fully loaded. Constant said he
wasn't certain about the number of trucks in
volved.
"Say several," Constant said.
"This is the first time it's happened here," he
added.
Police said they were aware of the problem, but
had no knowledge of any trouble.

Dow Jones down 11.35
New York — The stock market tumbled steeply
yesterday, in what brokers described as heavy
profit-taking and the return of investors' worries
over economic performance and inflation.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial and blue
chip stocks fell 11.35 points to 828.83, recording its
largest single-day drop in nearly four months.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except patches of fog
near the ocean night and morning. Slightly
warmer today. Lows both nights in the 50s. Highs
today and tomorrow in the 70s and 80s.
Leading officials support jet sale
Washington — The nation's leading diplomatic
and military officials told Congress yesterday the
pending sale of jet fighters to Israel, Saudi Arabia
and Egypt will enhance Israel's security, not im
peril it.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, Defense Secret
ary Harold Brown and Air Force Gen. David Jones,
acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called
the proposal a step toward peace in the Middle
East and "vitally important" to U.S. interests there.
The trio, testifying before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, opened the Carter ad
ministration's formal defense of the war planes
sales. President Jimmy Carter wants to sell 60 F-15
jet fighters to Saudi Arabia, 75 F-16s and 15 F-15s to
Israel and 50 less sophisticated F-5Es to Egypt.
Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Howard
Baker (R-Tenn.) said he personally approves of the
most controversial element of the sales plan — the
sale of the F-15s to Saudi Arabia.
Mail delays increased
Washington — The use of machines instead of
humans to sort mail is leading to increases in the
number of letters routed to the wrong city and
subsequent delays in delivery, the Postal Service
says.
A Postal Service survey of intercity mail handled
in 30 facilities found 2.2 per cent of the letters were
directed to the wrong cities — often to cities in
other parts of the country, Senior Assistant Post
master General E.V. Dorsey has told the Postal
Service board.
"As an example, a letter from New York City to
Washington might wind up in Cleveland. You then
have to send it from Cleveland to Washington. It
will be at least one day late," he said.
Revolution area attracts tourists
Kabul, Afghanistan — The revolution that littered
streets with bodies, rubble and the hulks of
burned-out tanks has become a tourist attraction
in this old caravan city of bazaars and minarets.
Where rebel and loyalist soldiers fought to the
death just six daysago, colorful queues of ordinary
Afghans shuffle in to the presidential palace for a
glimpse of the opulent rooms from which Presi
dent Mohammed Daoud ruled the country for five
years.
The curious thousands file past troops of the
Communist-led Revolutionary Council, which last
week deposed Daoud and killed him, his family
and many of his supporters, and past the charred
remains of armored vehicles, now festooned with

garlands of flowers, eerie reminders of the two
days of death and destruction.
Authoritative sources said as many as 10,000
persons may have been killed, but the casualty toll
could not be independently confirmed. The rebels
reported originally that 200 were killed.
Moslems and U.N. forces clash
Tyre, Lebanon — "I have never seen a battle so
confused like it. There was shooting everywhere,
and everyone was shooting at everyone."
A French army spokesman yesterday thus de
scribed a series of clashes between Moslem ex
tremists and U.N. forces in which a Senegalese
soldier, two French troops and a Palestinian were
killed.
Twelve French soldiers were wounded in the
fighting Tuesday night, and the spokesman, Capt.
Jean Menegaux, said "many gunmen" were killed.
French U.N. forces in southern Lebanon beefed
up their positions yesterday following the fighting,
which began when the Moslem extremists am
bushed a French patrol.
Menegaux said the two-hour battle was the
worst since the U.N. Security Council dispatched
troops to southern Lebanon last month.
Scouts seek special handicap rank
North Brunswick, N.J. — Steven Cerbasi and
Frank Burrell, Boy Scouts who have muscular dys
trophy, wanted to be Eagle Scouts. So their scout
master tried to work out a way: instead of hikes
and endurance tests, they took and passed oral
tests.
But the Boy Scouts of America then said they
can't be Eagle Scouts after all — and now the na
tional headquarters is adamant about denying
them the special rank.
"You can't say tell me, when the book states
show me," spokesman Thomas Dew summed up
the rules yesterday at national Boy Scout head
quarters here.
Dew said it is possible the organization will wind
up creating special badges for handicapped teen
agers instead — "one of several ideas" to revise
policy. But even if adopted, that won't satisfy the
two handicapped youths' scoutmaster, 76-year
old Edward Mattern.
"Special awards mean nothing. They earned an
