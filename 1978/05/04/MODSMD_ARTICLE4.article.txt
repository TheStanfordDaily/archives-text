# Displays show solar energy possibilities
## 
### Dean Eyre 
If there ever was a day to believe
in the weather forecaster, it had to
be yesterday. The predictions of
fair and warm conditions came
true, and rightly so, as Sun Day
culminated a 31-nation apprecia
tion of solar energy.
The topic of the day — the sun's
power — was confirmed by water
heated in collector arrays, erector
sets moved by photovoltaic cells,
and potatoes cooked by
parabolically-focused radiation.
These demonstrations offered
Bay Area residents an opportunity
to witness the applications of
solar energy.
In White Plaza, representatives,
literature and displays were pro
vided by the Energy Conservation
Center (ECO, Department of
Energy, Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) and several manufacturers
of solar equipment. Students
from SWOPSI 175, Energy Con
servation as an Energy Resource,
and Engineering 235, Engineering
Systems Design, displayed class
projects and led tours of the Roth
House solar water heating system.
Reams of free information on
conservation, insulation, solar
legislation, manufacturers'
specifications, and concepts of
solar technology were available.
At the Stanford Shopping
Center, similar resources were
situated in the mall area. In addi

tion, representatives from the
Sierra Club distributed material
about their energy projects, and
volunteers presented brochures
on pending solar legislation. The
displays will be open Sunday from
noon to 5 p.m.
Two major energy proposals in
clude the California Solar Hous
ing and Retrofit Program (Cal
SHARP) and Proposition 3.
Cal SHARP (SB 1731) is a prog
ram to solarize state-funded hous
ing for low and moderate income
families. Proposition 3, appearing
on the ]une 6 ballot, is an effort to
strongly encourage the utilization
of alternative energy sources.
Currently, the only major state
legislation for solar energy is the
55 per cent solar energy tax credit.
This credit compensates
homeowners for investing in solar
equipment.
The Bay Area is a natural for
solar energy. Besides the promis
ing potential of the area's climate
for comparatively short payback
periods on solar investments, the
peninsula is also the location of
many research and manufacturing
firms interested in solar energy.
Some of the major names in
energy study include the Univer
sity's Institute for Energy Studies,
ECC, and Energy Information
Center and San jose State's
Center for Solar Energy Applica
tions and Environmental Studies

The Roth House solar hot water heating system was built by a SWOPSI
class. It is currently awaiting arrival of plumbing parts before going into
operation. It will be monitored by SWOPSI classes and by the Energy
Conservation Center.
