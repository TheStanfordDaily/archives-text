# Sun Day
## Solar energy day observed across nation 
### Associated Press 
"Sun Day" celebrants across the country paid
tribute to the power and potential of solar
energy yesterday with displays, demonstra
tions and demands for federal action. But the
sun itself proved a fickle target of affection,
failing to show up for the occasion in several
places.
The effort to focus attention on the sun was
sponsored by Solar Action Inc., a
Washington-based nonprofit group. Backers
included consumer activists, environmen
talists, businessmen, government officials and
labor leaders.
The speakers around the country had a
common theme: Solar power can cut energy
costs without damaging the environment and
the federal government should do more to en
courage its use.
Events in the nation's capital began early in
the morning with speeches, music and solar
cooled food. The area around the Washington
Monument was turned into a giant sundial.
President |immy Carter marked "Sun Day" by
proposing increased federal spending for solar
energy and promising to develop a new "na
tional solar strategy."
In the first stop of a planned three-day West

ern trip, Carter visited a nine-month-old solar
research facility in Golden, Colorado.
Before arriving, however, Carter sprang a
surprise announcement to reporters while en
route from Washington to Denver on Air Force
One, then repeated the announcement in his
speech.
Carter said he has instructed the Department
of Energy to shift $100 million in proposed
spending in the next fiscal year from un
specified areas and into solar, wind, mini
hydroelectric and other so-called "renewable
energy" projects.
Presidential press secretary ]ody Powell told
reporters aboard the presidential jet that Carter
and Energy Secretary lames Schlesinger had
been "cooking up" the idea for some time but
that Carter had wanted to save the announce
ment as a surprise.
In his speech, Carter announced he is order
ing a new Cabinet-level study to develop a na
tional solar strategy and praised solar energy as
a potential counterweight to rising oil prices.
The sun broke through low clouds yesterday
just in time for Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. to cap
Sun Day celebrations by announcing creation
of a state office of solar energy.
"I see the sun is coming out â€” that's good,"

Brown said, grinning and gazing heavenward as
the crowd at the California Museum of Science
and Industry in Los Angeles applauded.
"California is going to lead this country with
respect to solar energy," Brown proclaimed,
announcing he had established by executive
order the SolarCal office in the state Business
and Transportation Agency.
Brown told the crowd of about 200 that politi
cal activist Tom Hayden would be a member of
his 25-member SolarCal Council, an advisory
body to "push the concept of solar energy."
The council will include representatives from
labor, utilities, universities, industry, govern
ment and consumer groups.
Brown also named Hayden, of the Campaign
for Economic Democracy, as the state rep
resentative to Western SUN, a 13-state group
formed to promote use of solar energy.
At a news conference across from San Fran
cisco's City Hall, actress )ane Fonda, Hayden's
wife, said solar energy can free people from
"the umbilical cord" of utilities that "can raise
rates willy-nilly."
"Solar energy is not futuristic, Flash Cordony
or a plaything of the rich, but something for
everyone in California whose rooftop has ac
cess to the sun," she said.



Solar energy displays were mounted in White Plaza yesterday at noon. At left
