# SCRIP conduct mannerly

I went to the recent sit-in at Presi
dent Richard Lyman's office. The
Board of Trustees had ignored the
recommendation of the Committee
on Investment Responsibility to vote
Stanford's proxies in favor of
Texaco's withdrawal from South Af
rica, and the students were protest
ing. The sit-in left me feeling very
excited about democracy and the po
tential for peaceful social change.
Perhaps that attitude leaves me in a
minority of one, since there is clearly
some frustration on all sides. But that
is the nature of the system under
which we are fortunate to live: a sys
tem of checks and balances, of ad
versary justice, of compromise.
Let me tell you why I'm hopeful. I
see signs that idealism has not died in
America. Even after the Vietnam war
and the Watergate scandals, cyni
cism and apathy have not overtaken
American students. Neither have
they become militant radicals.
Students today seem committed to
responsible use of the American
political process. I sat in Lyman's of
fice and I watched them organize.
They were angry at the decision of
the board, angry that student opin
ion and the formal recommendation
of the board's own advisory commit
tee had not been honored, angry that
even this small step toward the aboli
tion of apartheid had not been taken.
Conduct impeccable
But their conduct was impeccable.
They were scrupulously careful of
property, considerate of Lyman's of
fice staff, well-mannered, thought
ful, calm, firm, determined in a quiet
way. Small discussion groups were
established to share information and
develop strategies â€” every de
monstrator had an equal say in the
conduct of the sit-in. I could not help
thinking that these students were
learning more about effective politi
cal action than they could ever learn
from a textbook or a lecture. In that
sense the sit-in was in the

mainstream of the educational pro
cess.
And I wonder how many people
realize the frequent sacrifices made
by students such as these. Missed
classes, foregoing of social events,
late-night meetings, and financial
contributions are common. Con
tinued dedication over the past year
is a sign of the depth of commitment
students feel to the cause of peaceful
change in South Africa. Setbacks
neither discourage norenrage them.
They simply go on doing what they
have to do. I admire them greatly.
And I echo Dean Robert Hamerton-
Kelly, who in a Memorial Church
sermon last quarter said, "Thank
Cod for SCRIP!" SCRIP does our
homework for us, and the liberty
they fight for in a far country is our
liberty too. When one person is en
slaved none are free.
Hopeful at progress
I'm also hopeful at the progress in
understanding that has been made
by the CIR. Fred Hillier in a recent
Daily article was quoted as explain
ing the board's vote on our Texaco
proxies by pointing out that the trus
tees are not as far along in their think
ing process as the CIR. This is a highly
perceptive comment. It implies that
anyone who looks deeply, as the CIR
has had both the opportunity and the
responsibility to do, will see that
American corporate involvement in
South Africa in many cases contri
butes directly to the institutionalized
racism practiced there.
I attended the meeting at which
the newly formed CIR listened to the
views of the community on South Af
rica. I congratulate the CIR for listen
ing to the overwhelming sentiment
in favor of withdrawal and divest
ment, for then studying the issue
with an open mind; doing their own
careful, independent research into
the facts; and having the courage to
make the recommendations they
did.

Finally, I'm hopeful about the at
titude of the trustees. I am convinced
that they are acting out of a sincere
conviction that their votes rep
resented the most prudent action for
the future of Stanford. Anyone who
looks at the precarious financial posi
tion of many private American col
leges and universities in the 70s will
realize that the trustees have good
reason to be cautious in managing
the University's endowment and its
relationship with the business com
munity.
Room to differ
There is room here for an honest
difference of opinion. I am confident
that, given additional time and the
opportunity to study the issues as
thoroughly as the CIR has done, the
board will become more responsive
to the recommendations of its com
mittee.
It's important to note that SCRIP is
not "against" the board, the board is
not "against" the CIR, and the ad
ministration is not "against" the stu
dents. Rather each group is respond
ing to the problem of South African
investment in terms of its own un
derstanding and convictions. All
agree that apartheid is wrong and
must be stopped. In the wide-open
arena of the democratic political
process, a creative solution can and
must be found.
