Charge me.
Let's say you come up to my room and listen to my
terrific Direct/Reflecting" speakers. You spin my
belt-drive turntable. You twirl the dials on my AM/FM
tuner-arnplifier. All of a sudden you want me. Well,
sometimes even people with good taste haven t got
the bread. So Bose is making me available on credit.
Master Charge, Visa, or American Express. I'm the
Bose Model 360 Component Music System and I'm
easy. Easy to love. Easy to own.
Call your Bose Campus Manager for a free
demonstration.
