# Concerns lost in bureaucracy
## CIR caught in 'rigged poker game'

"... I have a feeling that students and the Uni
versity community are content to see what hap
pens with the newly formed Commission on In
vestment Responsibility." Robert Rosenzweig
Feb., 1978.
It has been almost one year since more than 290
students were arrested for protesting this Univer
sity's investment policy in South Africa. Since that
time, the Stanford administration has asked forthe
Stanford community to be patient — to wait for
"the system" to operate through normal channels
before making judgment on investment responsi
bility.
Last week the CIR voted unanimously to support
a proxy resolution which called for withdrawal of
Texaco's investments in South Africa. This was the
very first recommendation by the CIR to vote in
favor of a proxy for withdrawal.
According to the Chairman of the CIR, Professor
Hillier, "The CIR intensely studied the South Afri
can issue and found this was truly an extraordi
nary situation where 'business as usual' is no
longer a tolerable alternative." Thus the unanim
ous vote on Texaco.
When this recommendation moved through the
"system" and reached President Lyman and the
trustees it was unanimously rejected.
So far the "system" has operated like nothing
more than a rigged poker game. Consider what
has happened since last Spring's Old Union sit-in.
The 294 students were arrested last spring be
cause the administration called in the police to
remove protestors from the Old Union. The ar
rested students all faced trials, received stiff fines
and were placed on probation.
The administration made no effort to bargain
with the district attorney to reduce the sentences
imposed on its own students. In essence, they saw
to it that the protestors were punished for expres
sing their outrage at Stanford's immoral invest
ment policy.
After the arrests, the administration urged the
community to "wait and see." A special committee
was established to revise Stanford's investment
policy. However, the final recommendations of
this committee were not acceptable to many ele
ments of the community because they did not give
any positive indication that Stanford would refrain
from supporting apartheid in South Africa for the
sake of maximizing investment returns. As a result
both the ASSU Senate and the Council of Presi
dents did not appoint students on the committee
that would interpret the new document on in
vestment responsibility.
Instead President Lyman appointed students to
the newly created CIR. President Lyman justified
his disregard for the ASSU Constitution and stu
dent leaders for placing students on the CIR be
cause it was time "to get on with the business of
trying to work out in practice what it means for a
university to be a responsible investor". Again the
Stanford community offered protest, but was wil
ling to trust that the "system" would work.
After all the CIR was not just another committee
whose recommendation would be ignored, like so
many of Stanford's committees. The CIR was com
posed of key constituencies of the University so

that a wide spectrum of views could formulate
proxy decisions for the trustees.
Trustees 'dependent on CIR'
The President of the Board of Trustees, Dr. Peter
Bing, stated the importance and need of the CIR:
"The trustees are not in a position to delve deeply
and thoughtfully on proxy resolutions which are
complex issues. We are simply dependent on the
recommendation of the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility."
Bing's message was clear: The CIR would
play a significant role with the trustees. Thus,
when the CIR unanimously recommended that the
trustees support a proxy which called for with
drawal of Texaco's investments in South Africa —
the first such withdrawl proxy that the CIR sup
ported — it came as a great personal disappoint
ment that the trustees, including President Lyman,
flatly rejected the advice of the CIR.
The patience of our community has been tested.
We have been asked to put our trust and confi
dence in a committee that apparently carries little
clout with the trustees. The reasoned debate and
study of Stanford's investments in South Africa has
convinced a substantial portion of the community
that Stanford should exercise social responsibiltiy
and divest from those corporations that support
apartheid in South Africa. However, the concerns
of the community have unfortunately been lost in
the bureaucratic maze of the committee system.
Colleges express outrage
College campuses across the country are ex
pressing similar outrage over the role of U.S. in
vestments in supporting both U.S. corporations'
profit from apartheid and university profits from
its investments in these companies. The "move
ment" if there ever was such a thing, is strong and
determined to change something that is terribly
wrong.
Protest is the exercise of a legitimate constitu
tional right. It is also a tool that educates people
about an issue and can unite them in support of a
common goal. But so far protest has not changed
the opinions of the trustees.
Instead, the protests have left many people frus
trated about the prospects for reform. This frustra
tion is also leading toward a greater polarization of
forces.
Strategies suggested
At this juncture it might be appropriate to
suggest several strategies that might aid the goal of
making Stanford a responsible investor.
The first is for the ASSU to bring suit against the
trustees for not acting responsibly in its invest
ment decisions. Although a court ruling will take a
lot of time and money it would define how far the
trustees can legally go toward promoting a re
sponsible investment policy for the trust.
It would also help keep people educated about
South Africa, in addition to serving as a potential
legal precedent that other universities fighting
apartheid might find useful. The ambiguity of the
responsibilities that trustees for all private institu
tions live with would be clarified.
This suggestion is based on the assumption that
the trustees are reasonable people, and are not
corporate puppets as some might suggest. A fear

that a trustee revealed to me recently was that a
moral investment policy might endanger their fis
cal and legal responsibilities to the trust. The pos
sibility of a legal suit against the trustees for put
ting moral responsibility above fiscal responsibil
ity is a real one.
A second suggestion , which a Business School
student advanced, is to challenge the trustees to
prove theirconcern forapartheid by establishing a
special scholarship fund that South African stu
dents could use while attending Stanford. Al
though the actual worth of an undergraduate edu
cation at Stanford is questionable these days, I
believe the symbolic effect of this scholarship
would be very significant.
Informed debate needed
A third suggestion is for the trustees to make
internal reforms to so that they can receive more
information about the proxy issues. Presently, the
recommendations of the CIR go to an ad hoc
committee of the trustees which makes a final
recommendation to the entire board.
It seems that this ad hoc committee should be
eliminated and replaced by using the CIR as the
last link to the trustees. This will guarantee that the
intelligent and thorough debate of the CIR will be
directly communicated to all of the trustees, in
stead of being screened by the several trustees
sitting on an ad hoc committee.
The South African controversy has many paral
lels with the civil rights movement and the tragedy
of Vietnam. The mobilization of students to pro
test a policy that is morally repugnant gives me
great hope for the future. I only wonder why we
have not been able to learn from history and profit
from our past mistakes.
Stanford is supporting a country where 100
blacks are arrested a day for pass law violations,
where blacks can't vote, where they can't strike,
where white children are educated for free and
black children must pay. Certainly we can expect
more from President Lyman and the Board of Trus
tees than just endless rhetoric.
