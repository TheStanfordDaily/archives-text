# Bike routes on campus, to nature, to the beach
## Exciting near-by destinations for bikers revealed 
### Anne Bowden 
Are you a victim of spring
fever? Do you experience a
longing to get away from the
campus and see the outside
world? Does the sunshine
highlight some extra flesh be
neath your bathing suit? Then
hop on your bike and ride!
There are several exciting
destinations on or near the

campus. They don't require a
touring bike, and nearly any
one in nearly any shape can
easily reach them within a half
hour.
"You could even ride there
on a Stingray," said junior
Holly Cornwall. Cornwall, a
math major, rides extensively
in her free time. At the end of
this quarter she plans to bike

the 320 miles down to Santa
Barbara in five days.
Local routes
Among local routes,
Cornwall recommends Fren
chman's Hill. Off Peter Coutts
Avenue, it is "ideal for kite fly
ing. It's a green and grassy
knoll with no lines or trees,"
Cornwall said. Turn right from
Hanover Street onto California
Avenue and follow the foot
path at the end of the road.
Another grassy knoll within
easy reach is the Pine Hill Pic
nic Spot (Lathrop Park). Ride
on Mayfield and turn right onto
Cedro Way. From the dead end
is a view of the entire campus.
Another good picnic spot,
according to Cornwall, is Fren
chman's Bridge.
"The bridge is over grass
now, but you can still dangle
your feet," Cornwall said. The
bridge is near a small playfield
off of Peter Coutts Road.
Frenchman's Tower, an "old
brick castle building has a his
torical plaque and everything,"
Cornwall said. The tower is off
of Old Page Mill Road.
Commune with nature
If you need to commune
with Nature, maybe a trip to
the Baylands will help.
Ride down Embarcadero and

watch for the pedestrian over
pass near the Bayshore Free
way.
"There is a bird and wildlife
reserve with boardwalks over
the marshlands. More animals
are around if the tide is in,"
Cornwall said. "All the land is
flat and it is so peaceful," she
added. The round trip should
last a day.
One of Cornwall's favorite
rides is through Portola Valley.
Co down Sand Hill Road, turn
on Portola Road and then head
down Alpine.

"Sure, there are some hills,
but the road is wide and trees
provide shade for most of the
loop," Cornwall siad.
Beach bums
And now for you beach
bums. Co on Old La Honda,
cross Skyline and continue
until you hit Highway 84,
where you turn. Depending on
your degree of ambition, con
tinue up or down the coast to
San Cregorio, Pescadero or
Half Moon Bay beaches.
According to Cornwall, it
takes three hours at moderate
speed to reach the beach.
From Skyline on, bikers
"swoop." "But for the hills be
forehand you need to be in fair
shape," Cornwall said. "Bring
something warm for the other
side of the mountains," she
added.
"Biking is good exercise, but
there's something about get
ting places on your own power
that makes it worth it,"
Cornwall said. "You're going
slow enough to see what's
going by, to feel the breeze on
your face. There is a big feeling
of accomplishment after
you've ridden to the top of La
Honda," she said.
Check the brakes
Before starting out on a trip,
Cornwall suggests checking
your brakes. Another biker,
freshman Hal Schectman
added "Adjust the bike seat so

you can'almost straighten your
leg."
When on a hill, "don't think
about how steep it is,"
Cornwall said. "It's not good to
stop, your muscles get cold
and then it's harder to start up
again. Instead, concentrate on
keeping the pedals moving.
"Think about something
else. Watch the scenery or the
gravel right in front of the
wheel. If you have toeclips
think about just lifting up your
knees. It makes hills easier,"

she added.
All of the roads mentioned
above have shoulders or are
rarely used by cars.
"These trips aren't hard,
there's no real need to train for
any of them," Cornwall said.
"Go out whenever you have
the chance, a free hour or
two." And most importantly,
"don't let the hills scare you
away. 'Swooping' down makes
everything worthwhile,"
Cornwall said.
