New York — Americans think President
Jimmy Carter is an honest, hard-working
man, but they don't think he has gotten
much done as president.
That's the finding of the latest As
sociated Press-NBC News poll, taken this
week.
Moreover, Carter's job rating has
plummeted once again, with Americans'
judgment of his performance at levels
touched only by Richard Nixon among re
cent occupants of the Oval Office.
Only 29 per cent of those questioned
said Carter has done a good or excellent
job in office, compared with 69 per cent
who rated his work as fair or poor. Two per
cent were undecided in the telephone in
terviews conducted Monday and Tuesday.
That is down four points since the last
AP-NBC News poll in March.
A question similar to the AP-NBC News
wording has been asked in recent years by
pollster Louis Harris. The current AP-NBC
News rating on Carter is lower than the
lowest point found by Harris on either
Lydon Johnson or Gerald Ford. Only Ni
xon's 71-26 negative rating in March 1974 is

lower than Carter's current rating.
Asked about specific areas, the public's
rating of Carter dropped in foreign affairs,
energy and the economy.
The poll was taken before the govern
ment released its latest finding of a major
jump in wholesale prices and before Car
ter began his fence-mending tour to
Western states.
And these declines came despite Car
ter's first major foreign policy victory —
Senate approval of the Panama Canal
treaties — and despite settlement of the
coal strike and announcement of his anti
inflation program.
About 80 per cent of the 1600 adults in
terviewed agreed with statements that
Carter is honest and that he is hard
working. Only about 14 per cent disagreed
with either statement.
But 63 per cent disagreed with the
statement: "As president, Jimmy Carter
has shown that he can gets things done."
Thirty-one per cent agreed with the state
ment and 6 per cent were undecided.
Fighting inflation was one major area

where the poll found public sentiment
that Carter has not done enough.
While about two-thirds of the-people
say that a president has the power to deal
with inflation, only about a quarter of
those interviewed said Carter is doing
enough to fight inflation and 68 per cent
said he was not doing enough. Eight per
cent were undecided.
People's trust in Carter to do what's
right also has sunk in the last four months.
Only 40 per cent now say they trust Carter
to do the right thing at least most of the
time. That's down from 57 per cent in
January.
Those who say Carter can be trusted
only some of the time or almost never now
stands at 56 per cent, up from 40 per cent.
As with any sample survey, the results of
the AP-NBC News polls could differ from
the results of interviews with all Americans
because of chance variations in the sam
ple. For polls with 1600 interviews, the re
sults should vary no more than three per
centage points either way because of sam
ple errors.
