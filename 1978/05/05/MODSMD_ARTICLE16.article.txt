# Bing gives Commission on Investment Responsibility reasons for Trustee actions on proxy votes at Motorola, Phelps Dodge, Mobil, Standard Oil, Newmont Mining
## 
### 
Following is a May 3 letter from Dr. Peter Bing,
president of the Stanford Board of Trustees, to Prof.
Frederick Hillier, chairman of the Committee on In
vestment Responsibility, concerning the reasons for the
Board's votes on several proxy issues.
This is to inform you of actions taken by the Board of
Trustees relative to the third round of proxy recom
mendations by the CIR.
Motorola
The Board followed the ClR's recommendation to abstain
on the Motorola resolution which called for 1) no further
investment in South Africa, 2) no further sales to the South
African Government, and 3) withdrawal from South Africa.
The Board agreed with the ClR's opposition to part 3 of
the resolution, and a letter to management will be sent
expressing that view. Additionally, the letter will [urge no]
further expansion by Motorola in South Africa, as well as
cessation of sales to the South African Government when
the product is likely to be used for repressive purposes. The
Board intends to comment favorably about Motorola's
unusually good record on socially affirmative actions.
Phelps
Again following the recommendation of the CIR, the
Board has voted in favor of the shareholder resolution calling
for Phelps Dodge to terminate its operations in South Africa
as expeditiously as possible, unless and until the government
takes meaningful steps to end apartheid.
The Board's judgment is based in large measure on the
unlikelihood that Phelps Dodge will be able to act as a
progressive influence in South Africa. This inability results
from Phelps Dodge's relinquishing to a South African mining
company a controlling interest in its major South African
operation. Furthermore, the available evidence, including
the company's own report on its application of the Sullivan
principles (which was received after the CIR made its
recommendation), indicated a disappointing record of
socially affirmative action.
Mobil, Standard Oil
In the case of Mobil h.id the Standard Oil Company of
California, the Board decided to vote against shareholder
resolutions calling for a reduction in the volume of oil imports
into South Africa in 1978 by one-third of the average volume
of such imports during the past five years.
The intent of the proposed resolutions was to "provide

one way of compensating" for the companies' alleged
participation in transshipments of oil from South Africa to
Rhodesia in violation of the United Nations sanction against
the latter country. The CIR had recommended a vote in favor
of the shareholder resolutions.
The Board's actions were based on several con
siderations.
First, allegations of company participation in the tran
sshipments are not proved, and they originate in part from
lawsuits that appear to involve economic motives. Though
there certainly are personal and corporate connections
between Mobil Rhodesia and Mobil South Africa, Mobil's
South Africa Directors informed Rhodesia a decade ago of
company policies adopted by their marketing and refining
operations to end "the supply or sale by the company of
lubricating oils and other petroleum products to MOSR
[Rhodesia]."
In following up compliance with those policies, Mobil
states that review of the documentation it has received from
South Africa shows 'there has been no indication in any of
the material that there was any trade in petroleum products
between South Africa and Mobil Rhodesia." A Mobil official
testified to this effect before the U.S. Senate in 1976. Similar
assurances have been provided by Stanford of California
regarding its jointly owned subsidiary Caltex.
Secondly, the proposed one-third reduction in oil imports
to South Africa would constitute a punitive action against
that country and its population (both blacks and whites). This
would amount to what is called a secondary boycott, which
[is] considered [to be] dangerous to the rights of third parties
(in this case the South African people) and which [is] illegal in
the U.S. Rhodesia's total petroleum requirements are 10,000
barrels per day, and the proposed reductions would amount
to about 70,000 barrels per day.
Originators of the resolution have alleged in the proxy
material that "Total Rhodesian oil importation during the
past 12 years, calculated on the basis of Mobil figures
submitted to the U.S. Senate, amounts to at least one-third of
the current annual South African importation." An identical
statement is made in the Standard Oil proxy.
The proponents conclude that each company "Should
cut back allocations'to South Africa in 1978 by the whole

(Space paid by Naws and Publications Sarvica)

amount that has been leaked to the support of lan Smith's
illegal regime in violation of international law." Thus the
proposed reductions, which are many times the size of the
alleged annual transshipments of both companies, cannot
be said to be directed only to eliminating future tran
sshipment,
Third, the proposed one-third reduction of imports by
Mobil and Socal is punitive with respect to these companies
and their South African subsidiaries. While their participation
in transshipments cannot be ruled out, the available
evidence does not establish that conclusion.
As with the similar allegation of transshipment by Texaco
(which the Board considered last week) we are inclined to
accept management's statements in the absence of con
vincing evidence to the contrary. Mobil and Standard
acknowledge, as did Texaco, that transshipment is oc
curring, but the Board does not find evidence of their par
ticipation. Punitive action is not in order until a credible case
for the alleged action and the appropriateness of the
proposed remedy can be made. The Board does not believe
that this has been done.
May I note again that the Board feels strongly about
looking at the specific action proposed in each shareholder
resolution and voting each according to its merits. The CIR
stated, "an affirmative vote [on the Mobil and Standard Oil
resolutions] is a reasonable way to convey our sense that
our companies, in collaboration with other oil companies
operating in South Africa, should be pursuing effective
corrective action more vigorously." The Board is not
prepared to vote for a proposal in order to send a signal
other than the one embodied in the substance of the
proposal itself.
Newmont Mining
The last case before the CIR, and the Board, was the
proposal calling upon Newmont Mining Corporation to report
on affirmative action progress in its Namibia (South West
Africa) operations. The Board agreed with the ClR's analysis
and adopted its recommendation to vote for the proposal.
The Board continues to be grateful for your efforts and
those of your colleagues. We have learned from you, and we
hope our correspondence (describing our reasoning in those
cases in which our judgments have differed) will make this
feeling mutual. If I can be of any further assistance, please
do contact me.

African Government, and 3) withdrawal from South Africa.
The Board agreed with the ClR's opposition to part 3 of
the resolution, and a letter to management will be sent
expressing that view. Additionally, the letter will [urge no]
further expansion by Motorola in South Africa, as well as
cessation of sales to the South African Government when
the product is likely to be used for repressive purposes. The
Board intends to comment favorably about Motorola's
unusually good record on socially affirmative actions.
Phelps
Again following the recommendation of the CIR, the
Board has voted in favor of the shareholder resolution calling
for Phelps Dodge to terminate its operations in South Africa
as expeditiously as possible, unless and until the government
takes meaningful steps to end apartheid.
The Board's judgment is based in large measure on the
unlikelihood that Phelps Dodge will be able to act as a
progressive influence in South Africa. This inability results
from Phelps Dodge's relinquishing to a South African mining
company a controlling interest in its major South African
operation. Furthermore, the available evidence, including
the company's own report on its application of the Sullivan
principles (which was received after the CIR made its
recommendation), indicated a disappointing record of
socially affirmative action.
Mobil, Standard Oil
In the case of Mobil h.id the Standard Oil Company of
California, the Board decided to vote against shareholder
resolutions calling for a reduction in the volume of oil imports
into South Africa in 1978 by one-third of the average volume
of such imports during the past five years.
The intent of the proposed resolutions was to "provide

one way of compensating" for the companies' alleged
participation in transshipments of oil from South Africa to
Rhodesia in violation of the United Nations sanction against
the latter country. The CIR had recommended a vote in favor
of the shareholder resolutions.
The Board's actions were based on several con
siderations.
First, allegations of company participation in the tran
sshipments are not proved, and they originate in part from
lawsuits that appear to involve economic motives. Though
there certainly are personal and corporate connections
between Mobil Rhodesia and Mobil South Africa, Mobil's
South Africa Directors informed Rhodesia a decade ago of
company policies adopted by their marketing and refining
operations to end "the supply or sale by the company of
lubricating oils and other petroleum products to MOSR
[Rhodesia]."
In following up compliance with those policies, Mobil
states that review of the documentation it has received from
South Africa shows 'there has been no indication in any of
the material that there was any trade in petroleum products
between South Africa and Mobil Rhodesia." A Mobil official
testified to this effect before the U.S. Senate in 1976. Similar
assurances have been provided by Stanford of California
regarding its jointly owned subsidiary Caltex.
Secondly, the proposed one-third reduction in oil imports
to South Africa would constitute a punitive action against
that country and its population (both blacks and whites). This
would amount to what is called a secondary boycott, which
[is] considered [to be] dangerous to the rights of third parties
(in this case the South African people) and which [is] illegal in
the U.S. Rhodesia's total petroleum requirements are 10,000
barrels per day, and the proposed reductions would amount
to about 70,000 barrels per day.
Originators of the resolution have alleged in the proxy
material that "Total Rhodesian oil importation during the
past 12 years, calculated on the basis of Mobil figures
submitted to the U.S. Senate, amounts to at least one-third of
the current annual South African importation." An identical
statement is made in the Standard Oil proxy.
The proponents conclude that each company "Should
cut back allocations'to South Africa in 1978 by the whole

(Space paid by Naws and Publications Sarvica)

amount that has been leaked to the support of lan Smith's
illegal regime in violation of international law." Thus the
proposed reductions, which are many times the size of the
alleged annual transshipments of both companies, cannot
be said to be directed only to eliminating future tran
sshipment,
Third, the proposed one-third reduction of imports by
Mobil and Socal is punitive with respect to these companies
and their South African subsidiaries. While their participation
in transshipments cannot be ruled out, the available
evidence does not establish that conclusion.
As with the similar allegation of transshipment by Texaco
(which the Board considered last week) we are inclined to
accept management's statements in the absence of con
vincing evidence to the contrary. Mobil and Standard
acknowledge, as did Texaco, that transshipment is oc
curring, but the Board does not find evidence of their par
ticipation. Punitive action is not in order until a credible case
for the alleged action and the appropriateness of the
proposed remedy can be made. The Board does not believe
that this has been done.
May I note again that the Board feels strongly about
looking at the specific action proposed in each shareholder
resolution and voting each according to its merits. The CIR
stated, "an affirmative vote [on the Mobil and Standard Oil
resolutions] is a reasonable way to convey our sense that
our companies, in collaboration with other oil companies
operating in South Africa, should be pursuing effective
corrective action more vigorously." The Board is not
prepared to vote for a proposal in order to send a signal
other than the one embodied in the substance of the
proposal itself.
Newmont Mining
The last case before the CIR, and the Board, was the
proposal calling upon Newmont Mining Corporation to report
on affirmative action progress in its Namibia (South West
Africa) operations. The Board agreed with the ClR's analysis
and adopted its recommendation to vote for the proposal.
The Board continues to be grateful for your efforts and
those of your colleagues. We have learned from you, and we
hope our correspondence (describing our reasoning in those
cases in which our judgments have differed) will make this
feeling mutual. If I can be of any further assistance, please
do contact me.
Following is a May 3 letter from Dr. Peter Bing,
president of the Stanford Board of Trustees, to Prof.
Frederick Hillier, chairman of the Committee on In
vestment Responsibility, concerning the reasons for the
Board's votes on several proxy issues.
This is to inform you of actions taken by the Board of
Trustees relative to the third round of proxy recom
mendations by the CIR.
