# Bribery not tried here for Med, Law School admissions
## 
### Andrea James 
Although the New York Times re
cently reported an increase in illegal
efforts to gain admission to medical
and law schools across the country,
bribery has not even been attempted
here, according to admissions per
sonnel.
"To my knowledge no one has
ever formally attempted to bribe"
admissions staff, said John Steward,
associate dean of student affairs at
the medical school. He defined a
formal attempt as someone "coming
right out and saying 'If you will ac
cept me, I will do' such and such for
the University."
However, Steward, who has been
with the Med School admissions
committee for five years, said "there
is pressure" when an applicant be
longs to an "extraordinarily influen
tial" family or to a family who has
already done something for the Uni
versity.
"The family may not say a thing,
but it's awkward when we receive an
application from the son or daughter
of someone who, over the last 30
years or so, has donated $5 million to
the University," Steward said.
"There may be absolute clean in
tent and it's not the family's fault if
the student applies," he added. "But
we can't help but feel some pressure,
some thought that maybe this stu
dent deserves extra-special atten
tion."
Nevertheless, Steward assured
that these applicants receive no spe

cial consideration and that the ad
missions committee is incorruptible.
"The admissions committee is not
influenced by anything, not any
thing," Steward said. "There's not a
chance in the world that they could
be influenced."
Steward said some years ago the
committee used to interview applic
ants whose parents had University af
filiation. But because of the in
creased number of applications,
"the only way we can admit students
is to put everyone through the same
procedure. No one gets an interview
here unless they qualify."
Law school admissions staff also
claim not to be influenced by applic
ants with University affiliation.
William Baxter, who served for
three years as chairman of (he admis
sions committee until William Cohen
took over the position this year, said
he had never been approached with
a bribe.
"We get hundreds of letters of re
commendation from alumni writing
fortheirchildren, nieces, nephews,"
Baxter said. "We usually just ignore
them."
Baxter said the law school usually
responds to those who write letters
of recommendations.
"We usually send a letter saying
we're terribly sorry but johnny's ap
plication just isn't in the ball park,"
Baxter said.

Cohen said in his short term as
chairman he too had never been
bribed.
According to the New York Times
article, questionable efforts to gain
admission have been cited at UC-
Davis, Georgetown University, Loma
Linda and several universities in
Pennsylvania.
