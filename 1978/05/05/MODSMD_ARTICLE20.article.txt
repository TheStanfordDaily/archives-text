# Hayden calls for solar legislation
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) â€” With the
Sun Day awareness of solar
energy over, "now we have to
get to work on the legislation
to fund solar energy in the
state," Tom Hayden, newly
appointed to two government
solar energy groups, said yes
terday.
Hayden, an anti-war activist a
decade ago and an unsuccess
ful U.S. Senate candidate two
years ago, was named Wed
nesday by Gov. Edmund Brown
Jr. as a member of a new state
SolarCal Council and as the
state representative to the fed
eral Western SUN, a 13-state
group.
"It requires more than an
executive order creating Sol
arCal and setting up of a
bureaucracy," Hayden said at a
news conference. "It needs
continued great concern for
the passage of legislation we
think is vital."
"It's very clear to me there is
extensive constituent support
for creation of a decentralized
solar industry in California,"
added actress )ane Fonda,
Hayden's wife.
Hayden's citizens group,
Campaign for Economic
Democracy, has been pushing
a package of 13 solar energy
bills in the Legislature. The

package was called SolarCal,
the name also chosen by
Brown for his new office.
Brown, speaking at Sun Day
ceremonies, said the new of
fice in the state Business and
Transportation Agency, would
work on administration solar
energy policy.
The main points of the legis
lative package supported by
Hayden and CED are competi
tion, so s utilities don't domi
nate the new solar market; fi
nancial assistance to fledgling
solar businesses, and loans to
consumers for solar equip
ment installation.
He said he and his group
support Proposition 3 on the
June 6 ballot. It is a proposed
constitutional amendment that
would allow the Legislature to
exempt from taxation energy
systems, like solar, that don't
use fossil fuels.
Although he wants state
support in the form of loans for
homeowners installing solar
systems, Hayden said he
thought most solar programs
should be funded with federal
money. The Western SUN
group, when approved by the
13 states, should get between
$500,000 and $1.5 million for
California solar projects,
Hayden said.
