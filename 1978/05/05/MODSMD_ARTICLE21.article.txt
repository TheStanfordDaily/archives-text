### Alison Carpenter 
I am a sophomore this year and I had the bad
luck of drawing a very high number. Since I'm
unguaranteed for next year, and since I don't
feel like chancing it by going on the waiting list,
I'm going to move off-campus. The big thing is,
though, I know next to nothing about life off
campus. None of my friends from last year had to
go off-campus and I really don't know anyone
who is off-campus . A lot of my friends are in the
same boat.
How do you go about finding a place? Does
the University have anything to do with off
campus housing? Also, I've never had to shop or
cook for myself - I've lived in a dorm both years.
What can you tell me?

the topics to be dealt with as "legal issues,"
"budget planning," "transportation," "com
munity resources," "housemates and group
living," "places to get away to" and "keeping in
touch with campus."
The workshops will be held May 18 and 19,2 to
5 p.m.
You also might want to contact the Rental
Housing Information of the third floor of Old
Union. )une Becker, head of the office, said they
have listings for houses, apartments and rooms
in homes for rent in the area.

Is the University planning on repainting the
parking space lines on Galvez (by Stern)? The
lines are almost invisible now and people now
park just close enough together so a car cannot
park in between. This wastes about 10-15 spaces
on the street.

According to Ezekiel Smith, manager ot Work
Measurement, the parking lines on Galvez will be
painted next week.

inal group are still performing in the area.
