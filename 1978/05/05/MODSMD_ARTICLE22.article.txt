Old Mill
Director Fred Zinnemann's
superb craftsmanship and
complete intelligence domi
nate this film about friendship
and its responsibilities. Jane
Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave
star in this true story based on a
chapter of Lillian Hellman's au
tobiographical book Pen
timento. Both are brilliant;
Fonda effectively captures
Hellman's spirited personality,
and Redgrave delivers a fine,
understated performance as
the idealistic Julia. A must-see
film.

SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER
Bijou * ★ ★
No nutritional value. Also very
good. A dopey plot and only
one real actor and stupid
dialogue — pure schlock — but
still a damn good film and you
should see it. Even though
John Travolta makes a fool of
himself every week on TV he is
a legitimate star here; as the
best disco dancer in the entire
one-mile radius of this picture
he gives power to what other
wise would have been awful.
No one will blame you if you
loathe, despise, detest and
abhor this picture because of
its unrepentant dumbness;

still, if you scoff too loudly at
followers we are liable to punch
you in the nose.
—John Nielsen
THE FURY * *
Palo Alto Square
An empty style piece. Director
Brian DePalma gets great sequ
ences, but he has no vision in
this mess about a telekinetic
boy and girl. Nothing con
nects; the script is terrible and
the characterization is worse.
The film is too serious for satire,
but the climax has all the ele
ments of classic parody (John
Cassavetes literally gets
blownup; we see his frag
mented body from about six
different angles. The scene

must be the ultimate in camp
horror.)

AN UNMARRIED WOMAN
Old Mill ★***
Paul Mazursky's ("Harry and
Tonto") warm and intelli
gent look at '70s divorce. Jill
Clayburgh finally gets a role
which is equal to her talent, and
she doesn't disappoint. The
supporting cast is solid, with
Alan Bates standing out. The
film is a bit slow in its middle
third, but is generally strong
and honest. Comic without
being cruel, touching without
being saccharine.

You like cowboy movies?
You likegunfights, death, pain,
chewing tobacco, artful and to
tally incongruous love scenes,
and ostensibly stereotypical
characters (Chief Dan George)
who beat gleefully and re
peatedly stab their stereotypes
in the kidney? If so, then Clint
Eastwood's "Magnum Horse"
is the movie for you. Its the
same old Clint Eastwood we are
said to know and love — con
stantly blowing people to bits
because he had no choice,
pausing from time to time to
deliver a desultory phillipic or
two before he seduces another
woman — and if that stuff
makes you tingle then "Wales"
is a three-star masterpiece. If
not, it stinks, but we'll let that
pass.
—J.N.
THE TURNING POINT * *
Old Mill
A movie about bitchy people
who won't shut up. The film is
done in by its soap opera plot
based on beliefs straight from
the fifties. For example, Shirley
MacLaine gives up her career
because she gets married. The
film seems to say that a woman
can't have a career and love
both. The film's only redeem
ing feature is Baryshnikov's
dancing; basically, the movie is
too much soap opera and not
enought ballet.
R.L.
STAR WARS * *
Old Mill
At first glance, 1) stunningly en
tertaining and wildly visual 2)
wildly entertaining and stun
ningly visual 3) the kind of
movie nobody makes anymore.
On second thought, a deliber
ately anaesthetic, vapid and
happy sell-out. Except for Alec
Guiness the actors are not un
like Barbie dolls, or escapees
from an episode of Lassie;
though Lucas is to be praised
for avoiding the asinine politi
cal commentary implicit in
things like Rollerball and Lo
gan's Run his decision to center
the action around the aformen
tioned members of the Pepsi
Generation rankles and irks
and peeves. True 2007 fans in
sist that for all its visual
achievements Star Wars is really
very bland — even though I still
don't know what the hell was
going on in Kubrick's movie I
am tempted to agree.

You like cowboy movies?
You likegunfights, death, pain,
chewing tobacco, artful and to
tally incongruous love scenes,
and ostensibly stereotypical
characters (Chief Dan George)
who beat gleefully and re
peatedly stab their stereotypes
in the kidney? If so, then Clint
Eastwood's "Magnum Horse"
is the movie for you. Its the
same old Clint Eastwood we are
said to know and love — con
stantly blowing people to bits
because he had no choice,
pausing from time to time to
deliver a desultory phillipic or
two before he seduces another
woman — and if that stuff
makes you tingle then "Wales"
is a three-star masterpiece. If
not, it stinks, but we'll let that
pass.

THE TURNING POINT * *
Old Mill
A movie about bitchy people
who won't shut up. The film is
done in by its soap opera plot
based on beliefs straight from
the fifties. For example, Shirley
MacLaine gives up her career
because she gets married. The
film seems to say that a woman
can't have a career and love
both. The film's only redeem
ing feature is Baryshnikov's
dancing; basically, the movie is
too much soap opera and not
enought ballet.
R.L.
STAR WARS * *
Old Mill
At first glance, 1) stunningly en
tertaining and wildly visual 2)
wildly entertaining and stun
ningly visual 3) the kind of
movie nobody makes anymore.
On second thought, a deliber
ately anaesthetic, vapid and
happy sell-out. Except for Alec
Guiness the actors are not un
like Barbie dolls, or escapees
from an episode of Lassie;
though Lucas is to be praised
for avoiding the asinine politi
cal commentary implicit in
things like Rollerball and Lo
gan's Run his decision to center
the action around the aformen
tioned members of the Pepsi
Generation rankles and irks
and peeves. True 2007 fans in
sist that for all its visual
achievements Star Wars is really
very bland — even though I still
don't know what the hell was
going on in Kubrick's movie I
am tempted to agree.

The camp classic of the de

The Bond films sure ain't art,
but the best ones have a wink

the interest throughout. I still
like Sean Connery's Bond bet

"Spy" compares favorably with
any of Connery's 007 films.
Superb effects and stunts.

Bijou * ★ ★
No nutritional value. Also very
good. A dopey plot and only
one real actor and stupid
dialogue — pure schlock — but
still a damn good film and you
should see it. Even though
John Travolta makes a fool of
himself every week on TV he is
a legitimate star here; as the
best disco dancer in the entire
one-mile radius of this picture
he gives power to what other
wise would have been awful.
No one will blame you if you
loathe, despise, detest and
abhor this picture because of
its unrepentant dumbness;

still, if you scoff too loudly at
followers we are liable to punch
you in the nose.
