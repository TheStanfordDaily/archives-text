## the 						palestinian'/katherine ellison A 						considered opinion of Vanessa Redgrave's film 
### 
Monday and Tuesday of this week, a film
starring the English actress Vanessa Red
grave was brought to San Francisco's "Av
enue" theater.
In this film, however, the part Redgrave
played — that of a fervent revolutionary En
glish Trotskyite — was her own. Redgrave
produced as well as narrated the film, called,
"The Palestinian," and it is, above all else, a
strong statement of her own political views.
The fact that Redgrave produced the film
caused a great deal of controversy at the
Academy Awards ceremony last month. Be
fore the ceremony, when Redgrave was
nominated for an award for her part in
"Julia," many protested the nomination be
cause of the views she expressed in her film.
The British actress received the award any
way, and, in her acceptance speech,
applauded the judges for not giving way to
political pressure.
Publicized
In view of this well-publicized con
troversy, one might have expected the over
flow crowds at Monday's premiere of "The
Palestinian" to have included a majority of
non-partial but curious San Franciscans. In
reality, however, and even though the (un
identified) man who introduced the film said
its primary value would be to "enlighten the
lewish American worker," well over half of
the 700 or so moviegoers at the first showing
seemed to be of Arab descent.
The "Ramallah Club," comprised of Pales
tinian San Franciscans, contracted with Van
essa Redgrave Productions and the Avenue
theater to show the film. Beginning last
month, the club publicized the film with
fliers, but these were mainly sent to Arab
student associations and leftist groups at var
ious local campuses. This was unfortunate.
Many who may have been most curious to
see the film heard nothing about it. In this
way, Redgrave's film probably had little real
effect — on the whole it preached to the
converted.
Preaching
Yet even if the audience had been more
varied, the film's impact may still have
been slight because that sense of preaching
to the converted is rooted in the content and
style of the movie itself. The producers as
sumed a great deal of both knowledge and
conviction on the part of their audience,
thus they let a great opportunity to pro
selytize and/or educate slip by, contenting
themselves with a product heavy on emo
tion yet void of constructive or lasting im
pact.
"The Palestinian" is a film which needed
to be made. Very few Americans of any polit
ical slant are aware of the tragedy the Pales
tinians have suffered at the hands of both

Arabs and Israelis. To most U.S. citizens, the
Palestinain is automatically a sinister guer
rilla in a kaffiyeh, a lunatic bomber and an
undulating primitive.
Redgrave takes a closer look inside the
Lebanese refugee camps and shows us the
Palestinian doctor, builder and teacher. She
shows us, as well, the Lebanese Phalangist
— an obscure character to many

Americans. It is important that these people
be seen and identified. But Redgrave's most
serious mistake in making her film is that,
while she shows us the individual characters
and groups, she makes no connections,
gives no real analyses, and draws few tena
ble conclusions from her images.
Damur
For instance, the major part of the film
examines a settlement of Palestinian re
fugees at Lebanese Damur. Most of Damur's
refugees came from Tel Az-Zaatar, which

underwent a 55-day seige by Phalangists dur
ing the Lebanese civil war. The film begins
with a long interview with a Palestinian doc
tor, in which he recounts the horrors he
witnessed during the seige. Later on, there is
a chilling interview with an armed Phalan
gist, who sits at his desk and recites the
creed of this ultra-rightist party: "It is the
duty of every Lebanese to kill a Palestinian."

We hear this Phalangist emphasize that the
Palestinian children must not be spared as
otherwise, in "in 10 years, they will grow up
to kill you." Throughout the film we listen to
Redgrave denouncing the "Zionists, im
perialists, and fascists."
Rifles
That Redgrave herself wholeheartedly
supports the Palestinian resistance is quite
obvious from the film. Almost every time she
appears as interviewer, she seems on the
verge of crying; her eyes brim, and her voice

is hoarse. She has been widely criticized for
a concluding scene in which she dances with
Palestinian guerrillas, holding a rifle in her
arms. Whether one is repulsed by this par
ticular scene or not, is the wholly committed
tone of the film objectionable?
In some very important ways, it is. While
the film makes no claims to be a journalistic
or unbiased endeavor, it is yet prone to

charges that it lacks both artisticand intellec
tual integrity.
Artistically, the film must be faulted for its
total lack of restraint. Over two and a half
hours long, it is the obvious result of overen
thusiasm, leading to a reluctance to edit at
all. Thus, many scenes carry on awkwardly
and for far too long a time. The film shows
little or no attention to details, omitting even
to identify by name on screen any of the
interviewees, including Yasser Arafat, three
major Phalangist-Rightist Lebanese, etc.

In this case, and in several others, the inat
tention to details makes for a real lack of
integrity. In some scenes the subtitled En
glish translation of Arabic interviews is mis
leading. For example, the word "Yehud" —
Jew — is uniformly translated as "Zionist."
The reason for this may be that most Palesti
nian peasants have never learned to distin
guish between the two, but why must this
fact be hidden from us? The audience
should be given the true responses and al
lowed to decide for itself. This didactic yet
devious treatment makes one suspicious.
A slightly more reassuring note was
sounded in an interview with a little Palesti
nian girl, who explained very clearly that her
enemy was "not the Jews, but the
Zionists," emphasizing that if she saw a
wounded Israeli soldier, she would help
him, and try to "explain our cause." The
audience clapped enthusiastically at her
words.
Redgrave tells us that "a Palestinian nation
was born in the camps." Indeed, one learns
this from her film. The resistance of Palesti
nians to their expulsion by Israel and violent
rejection by the Arab nations is undeniable;
their bitterness is expressed eloquently in
the film. There have been some heroic in
stances of resourcefulness by the Palesti
nians, and these are exemplified in the film
sequences in which they build hospitals and
schools, care for their sick, and tearh their
children.
Stopping short
Nevertheless, in many ways, Redgrave's
film stops short of identifying the real issues,
or indeed, anything more than her interpre
tation of "good guys" and "bad guys" in the
Middle Eastern conflict.
While she dances with a rifle, she says not
a word about any nonviolent ways out of the
dilemma; this is inexcusable. Much of the
film seems to be an attempt to deny the
stereotypical view of the refugees as a killer
horde, yet Redgrave ends up by nearly reaf
firming that stereotype. She mentions
the Israelis only by epithets: "Zionists," or
"the enemy." By expecting her audience to
take her at her word in all these matters she
conveys a very low opinion of it.
On the whole, "The Palestinian" shows
those prepared to sympathize just how
much needs to be said about the Palesti
nians, the human crux of the Middle East
conflict. So much might have been said . . .
but was not.
In this way, and sadly, "The Palestinian"
abuses the art of film-making; where it
might have brought understanding and em
pathy to the ignorant or cold-hearted, it
preached a mostly militant reaction to an
audience of the converted.
