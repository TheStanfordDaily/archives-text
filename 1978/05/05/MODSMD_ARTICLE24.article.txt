## 'Perhaps a first step towards a needed exorcism' 
### 
After the press screening of
her new film "Coming Home,"
Jane FondA and the associate
producer of the film, Bruce
Gilbert, held a news confer
ence about the film and related
topics.
"Coming Home" took "six
years to get it made and re
leased," Fonda said. She de
scribed the film as "a love story

"We always saw the movie as a story of
people coming out of boxes; the war is a
catalyst for people reexamining who they
were - men and women. It took a toll on
both sexes. .

which evolved out of discus
sions and experiences" with
both the cast and with actual
war veterans.
"We wanted to make a
movie about the effects of the
war on very specific lives, and I
wanted to be in it, so we had to
have a woman," Fonda said in
response to a question about
the film's feminist implica
tions.
Military wives
She continued: "I had spent
a certain amount of time prior
to the making of 'Coming
Home,' in fact four years, as an
activist in what we called the
'CI movement.' Through that
movement, I came into contact
with a number of military wives
and so had some feelings on
what it a was like to be a milit
ary wife. I actually saw women
go through considerable
change, not to mention my
own change. So it (feminism)
was always an integral part of
the story we wanted to tell."
"We always saw the movie as
a story of people coming out of
boxes; the war as a catalyst for
people reexamining who they
were — men and women; it
took a toll on both sexes."
Fonda described the charac
ter she plays in the film as "a
lower middle class marine of
ficer's wife who married out of
high school, and has never

known any other man in her
life. She is extremely — as we
say these days—male defined.
Her entire life has been bound
up into that of her husband."'
New worlds
"Like a lot of women who
have never known anything
else, it never occurs to her that
things could be different; I
mean, that a relationship with a

man could be different than
what she experiences with her
husband, whom she loves.
Luke Martin opens up an en
tirely new world for her, and
she loves him as well."
"She's utterly terrified with
the idea of making a choice,
because one represents her
identity, her life, her security;
the other, passion and new
ness — but uncertainty to
where that can lead to. She
would never, ever want to
leave her husband when he is
in the kind of state he is when
he comes back."
"She would help him, un
derstand him, try to save the
marriage. If the movie didn't
end and if he didn't kill himself
and had continued, I think she
would have stayed with him for
quite a long time. Ultimately, I
don't think the marriage could
work, but neither, necessarily,
would a relationship with Luke
Martin."
Vietnam
Howfilms about the Vietnam
war are received "depends on
the context of how they are
made," she said. "It seems to
me that there are two ways to
do it. One is the way we did it,
which is in the context of a
highly human and emotional
story."
"Essentially, the film's not a
war story; it's a love story. And

it's because of the vehicle of
the love story that I think
people who wouldn't want to
go to see a movie about the
Vietnam War find this movie
accessible."
And the movie is doing quite
well; "doing record business
in very unexpected places —
Orange County, for example;
lines around the block. I think
this is very interesting."
"The other way to do a Viet
nam War film," continued
Fonda, "is the way Francis Ford
Coppola is doing it, which is
epic ("Apocalypse Now"). You
extend beyond realism to a
gargantuan level, which some
one of Francis' capability can
do. It's wonderful that both of
these spectrums will reach the
American public this year."
Not clearly
"Coming Heme" is "not
clearly anti-war . . . dealing
with the reasons why the war
was being fought" because we
didn't feel that such a film
could be made today, or if it
was, people wouldn't see it."
She feels that such a film
should be made, however: "I

. . we wanted to make a movie about
the effects of war on very specific lives,
and I wanted to be in it, so we had to have
a woman. Feminism was always an integ
ral part of the story we wanted to tell."

think that until the majority of
Americans understand why we
were in Vietnam, and why we
didn't win the war, then some
thing has got to be done. It's a
national exorcism that needs to
be carried out. I think that cul
ture is a key factor in this; not
only movies, but television,
plays, novels, every form pos
sible has to help our people
understand so it will never
happen again."
"Coming Home" may
"perhaps be a first step" on the
road to this needed "exor

cism," according to Fonda.
The inevitable question was
asked about Fonda's opinion
of friend Vanessa Redgrave's
speech at the Oscars. She said
that "the problem for me in
what Vanessa said was the use
of the words 'Zionist hood
lums'; an unfortunate choice
of words. I think it rendered a
lot of the rest of what she said
inaudible. It got blinders up
over people's ears."
'Klute'
"But I don't think that my
situation in accepting an Oscar
for "Klute" (in which I played a
prostitute), where I said 'this is
not the place to talk about a lot
of things that are going on,'
namely, the Vietnam War, can
be equated with Vanessa Red
grave's, for whom there was
massive campaign pressure on
the industry to not give her this
award for a movie about fas
cism."
"In other words, the topic of
the movie, the campaign
against her, and the fact that
she got the award anyway, I
think created a situation quite

different from my own (in ac
cepting the Oscar for "Klute "
in 1971). I think it's wonderful
that McCarthyism and the
witch-hunts are no longer op
erable in Hollywood, and that
despite the campaign, she was
given the award."
Jane Fonda closed the press
conference with this: "I've
made 30 films. Never, for any
other film I've ever made, have
I gotten the mail that I'm get
ting for 'Coming Home.' I
would love someday to publish
the letters that not just me, but
all of us involved, are getting."
Six years
"Nothing is more gratifying.
It makes those six years seem
valid. The letters are from all
kinds of people. Handicapped
people, veterans, wives of vet
erans, military wives, military
daughters, and just plain folks.
They are very viscerally being
affected by the movie in ways
that exceed anything that I
could ever have imagined. So
we're really happy."

own change. So it (feminism)
was always an integral part of
the story we wanted to tell."
"We always saw the movie as
a story of people coming out of
boxes; the war as a catalyst for
people reexamining who they
were — men and women; it
took a toll on both sexes."
Fonda described the charac
ter she plays in the film as "a
lower middle class marine of
ficer's wife who married out of
high school, and has never

known any other man in her
life. She is extremely — as we
say these days—male defined.
Her entire life has been bound
up into that of her husband."'
New worlds
"Like a lot of women who
have never known anything
else, it never occurs to her that
things could be different; I
mean, that a relationship with a

man could be different than
what she experiences with her
husband, whom she loves.
Luke Martin opens up an en
tirely new world for her, and
she loves him as well."
"She's utterly terrified with
the idea of making a choice,
because one represents her
identity, her life, her security;
the other, passion and new
ness — but uncertainty to
where that can lead to. She
would never, ever want to
leave her husband when he is
in the kind of state he is when
he comes back."
"She would help him, un
derstand him, try to save the
marriage. If the movie didn't
end and if he didn't kill himself
and had continued, I think she
would have stayed with him for
quite a long time. Ultimately, I
don't think the marriage could
work, but neither, necessarily,
would a relationship with Luke
Martin."
Vietnam
Howfilms about the Vietnam
war are received "depends on
the context of how they are
made," she said. "It seems to
me that there are two ways to
do it. One is the way we did it,
which is in the context of a
highly human and emotional
story."
"Essentially, the film's not a
war story; it's a love story. And

it's because of the vehicle of
the love story that I think
people who wouldn't want to
go to see a movie about the
Vietnam War find this movie
accessible."
And the movie is doing quite
well; "doing record business
in very unexpected places —
Orange County, for example;
lines around the block. I think
this is very interesting."
"The other way to do a Viet
nam War film," continued
Fonda, "is the way Francis Ford
Coppola is doing it, which is
epic ("Apocalypse Now"). You
extend beyond realism to a
gargantuan level, which some
one of Francis' capability can
do. It's wonderful that both of
these spectrums will reach the
American public this year."
Not clearly
"Coming Heme" is "not
clearly anti-war . . . dealing
with the reasons why the war
was being fought" because we
didn't feel that such a film
could be made today, or if it
was, people wouldn't see it."
She feels that such a film
should be made, however: "I

. . we wanted to make a movie about
the effects of war on very specific lives,
and I wanted to be in it, so we had to have
a woman. Feminism was always an integ
ral part of the story we wanted to tell."

think that until the majority of
Americans understand why we
were in Vietnam, and why we
didn't win the war, then some
thing has got to be done. It's a
national exorcism that needs to
be carried out. I think that cul
ture is a key factor in this; not
only movies, but television,
plays, novels, every form pos
sible has to help our people
understand so it will never
happen again."
"Coming Home" may
"perhaps be a first step" on the
road to this needed "exor

cism," according to Fonda.
The inevitable question was
asked about Fonda's opinion
of friend Vanessa Redgrave's
speech at the Oscars. She said
that "the problem for me in
what Vanessa said was the use
of the words 'Zionist hood
lums'; an unfortunate choice
of words. I think it rendered a
lot of the rest of what she said
inaudible. It got blinders up
over people's ears."
'Klute'
"But I don't think that my
situation in accepting an Oscar
for "Klute" (in which I played a
prostitute), where I said 'this is
not the place to talk about a lot
of things that are going on,'
namely, the Vietnam War, can
be equated with Vanessa Red
grave's, for whom there was
massive campaign pressure on
the industry to not give her this
award for a movie about fas
cism."
"In other words, the topic of
the movie, the campaign
against her, and the fact that
she got the award anyway, I
think created a situation quite

different from my own (in ac
cepting the Oscar for "Klute "
in 1971). I think it's wonderful
that McCarthyism and the
witch-hunts are no longer op
erable in Hollywood, and that
despite the campaign, she was
given the award."
Jane Fonda closed the press
conference with this: "I've
made 30 films. Never, for any
other film I've ever made, have
I gotten the mail that I'm get
ting for 'Coming Home.' I
would love someday to publish
the letters that not just me, but
all of us involved, are getting."
Six years
"Nothing is more gratifying.
It makes those six years seem
valid. The letters are from all
kinds of people. Handicapped
people, veterans, wives of vet
erans, military wives, military
daughters, and just plain folks.
They are very viscerally being
affected by the movie in ways
that exceed anything that I
could ever have imagined. So
we're really happy."

marriage. If the movie didn't
end and if he didn't kill himself
and had continued, I think she
would have stayed with him for
quite a long time. Ultimately, I
don't think the marriage could
work, but neither, necessarily,
would a relationship with Luke
Martin."
Vietnam
Howfilms about the Vietnam
war are received "depends on
the context of how they are
made," she said. "It seems to
me that there are two ways to
do it. One is the way we did it,
which is in the context of a
highly human and emotional
story."
"Essentially, the film's not a
war story; it's a love story. And

it's because of the vehicle of
the love story that I think
people who wouldn't want to
go to see a movie about the
Vietnam War find this movie
accessible."
And the movie is doing quite
well; "doing record business
in very unexpected places —
Orange County, for example;
lines around the block. I think
this is very interesting."
"The other way to do a Viet
nam War film," continued
Fonda, "is the way Francis Ford
Coppola is doing it, which is
epic ("Apocalypse Now"). You
extend beyond realism to a
gargantuan level, which some
one of Francis' capability can
do. It's wonderful that both of
these spectrums will reach the
American public this year."
Not clearly
"Coming Heme" is "not
clearly anti-war . . . dealing
with the reasons why the war
was being fought" because we
didn't feel that such a film
could be made today, or if it
was, people wouldn't see it."
She feels that such a film
should be made, however: "I

. . we wanted to make a movie about
the effects of war on very specific lives,
and I wanted to be in it, so we had to have
a woman. Feminism was always an integ
ral part of the story we wanted to tell."

think that until the majority of
Americans understand why we
were in Vietnam, and why we
didn't win the war, then some
thing has got to be done. It's a
national exorcism that needs to
be carried out. I think that cul
ture is a key factor in this; not
only movies, but television,
plays, novels, every form pos
sible has to help our people
understand so it will never
happen again."
"Coming Home" may
"perhaps be a first step" on the
road to this needed "exor

cism," according to Fonda.
The inevitable question was
asked about Fonda's opinion
of friend Vanessa Redgrave's
speech at the Oscars. She said
that "the problem for me in
what Vanessa said was the use
of the words 'Zionist hood
lums'; an unfortunate choice
of words. I think it rendered a
lot of the rest of what she said
inaudible. It got blinders up
over people's ears."
'Klute'
"But I don't think that my
situation in accepting an Oscar
for "Klute" (in which I played a
prostitute), where I said 'this is
not the place to talk about a lot
of things that are going on,'
namely, the Vietnam War, can
be equated with Vanessa Red
grave's, for whom there was
massive campaign pressure on
the industry to not give her this
award for a movie about fas
cism."
"In other words, the topic of
the movie, the campaign
against her, and the fact that
she got the award anyway, I
think created a situation quite

different from my own (in ac
cepting the Oscar for "Klute "
in 1971). I think it's wonderful
that McCarthyism and the
witch-hunts are no longer op
erable in Hollywood, and that
despite the campaign, she was
given the award."
Jane Fonda closed the press
conference with this: "I've
made 30 films. Never, for any
other film I've ever made, have
I gotten the mail that I'm get
ting for 'Coming Home.' I
would love someday to publish
the letters that not just me, but
all of us involved, are getting."
Six years
"Nothing is more gratifying.
It makes those six years seem
valid. The letters are from all
kinds of people. Handicapped
people, veterans, wives of vet
erans, military wives, military
daughters, and just plain folks.
They are very viscerally being
affected by the movie in ways
that exceed anything that I
could ever have imagined. So
we're really happy."
