## Recapturing the feel of '68 
### 
"Coming Home" captures
the feel, the look, the texture
of the late '60s — specifically,
1968 — as well as has yet been
done in movies. This is that pic
ture's greatest, and most im
portant, achievement.
Those who expect a "war
film" will not find it here. In
both tone and subject matter,

Director Hal Ashby ("Harold and Maude,"
"Shampoo") has done a marvelous job of
fitting the fragmented pieces of the film
together into a coherent and relatively
well-structured whole. . .

"Coming Home" reminds one
of the 1946 film, "Best Years of
Our Lives": the focus is on
people at home and how war
affects them.
Jane Fonda plays Sally Hyde,
wife of a Marine captain in Vie
tnam (Bruce Dern). At the vete
rans hospital where she does
volunteer work she meets Luke
Martin (Jon Voight), a parap
legic. Her experiences in the
hospital and with Luke cause
her to question her all-too
traditional life and beliefs.
Gradually — and believably —
she falls in love with Luke.
How each of the characters
view the war is an important
part of the film. But the main
characters are not one
dimensional political carica
tures; they are multi
dimensional real people.
Bob Hyde
The only person we really
don't understand is the Bruce
Dern character, Bob Hyde.
When he comes back from the
war, the alienation and disillu
sionment he feels are instantly
recognizable, bringing back a
host of memories of similarly
angry and confused Vietnam
veterans.
But we haven't seen enough
of him to understand fully the
tangle of pain and humiliation
that he, in particular, feels; we
are forced, unfortunately, to
generalize,. Hyde's suicide at
the end of the film is the action
of a stereotype more than of a
sharply defined character.
The problems the film has,
including the lack of definition
in the Bob Hyde character, are
largely due to the fact that
much of what was filmed dur
ing the shooting of the movie
had to be cut. Scenes had to

be cut because they simply
didn't fit; also, the conception
of the characters changed over
the course of shooting, leaving
some scenes unworkable by
the end of filming.
Hal Ashby
Director Hal Ashby ("Harold
and Maude," "Shampoo") has
done a marvelous job in form

ing the fragmented pieces of
the film together into a cohe
rent and relatively well struc
tured whole. Ashby keeps the
discontinuity the film occa
sionally suffers from to a
minimum.
Other things that help
"Coming Home" overcome its
flaws are the cinematography
of the brilliant Haskell Wexler,
its essential honesty, and
especially the film's overriding
attention to performance.
Bruce Dern gives a solid per
formance considering what lit
tle he has to work with. As Sal
ly's friend, Penelope Milford
is a welcome and engaging
surprise. The best acting in the
film, however, is done by Jane
Fonda and Jon Voight.
Fonda's performance is not
able for what it doesn't do.
Fonda has been the driving
force in the film from start to
finish. Many other performers
in such a situation have
exploited it in order to glorify
themselves — what Streisand
did in her version of "Star is
Born,"forexample. But Fonda,
always professional and intelli
gent, resists this temptation.
Sally Hyde
Fonda's understated, quietly
forceful portrayal of Sally Hyde
is one of her very best. Very
clearly, she understands the
feelings involved in undergo
ing an emotional awakening
and reevaluation.
The subtlety of Fonda's per
formance makes Voight's all
the stronger. Voight's perfor
mance is one of honest and
deep emotion; his speech to
the high school at the end of
the film is perfection itself. So
many other actors would have
reduced the scene to mawkish

sentimentality, but Voight
saves it with his complete au
thenticity as Luke Martin.
Jane Fonda
The film never really decides
where it wants to go, and its
construction is occasionally
sloppy, but it captures the
mood of the time.
The soundtrack (of the
Stones, Beatles, etc., circa
1968), the direction, the
cinematography, and the per
formances all combine to give
one a sense that the people
who made this movie — espe
cially Jane Fonda and Hal
Ashby — knew what the hell
our crazy war felt like.
"Coming Home" is by no
means a universal or perfect
statement of what the war was
all about. But it successfully
captures the essence of the
feelings that many of those
who lived through that trou
bled period experienced. And
in this respect, "Coming
Home" is a triumph.
