# Three-day series
## USC invades Sunken 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Tom Seaver, Fred Lynn, Dave Kingman, Jim
Barr — what do these players have in common
besides being successful major league baseball
players? All four played college ball at the Uni
versity of Southern California.
Potential major league greats like them (in
cluding Stanford's pro prospects) can be seen
this weekend in what promises to be one of the
best baseball series of the year. The USC Trojans
will visit Stanford's Sunken Diamond today at
2:30 p.m. forasinglegame,andagain tomorrow
and Sunday for single games at 1 p.m.
The Trojans come to the Farm with sopho
more All-America pitcher Bill Bordley, All-
Conference performers in catcher Dave Van
Corder, first baseman Dave Hostetler, third
baseman Dave Engle and shortstop Doug
Stokke, and seven of the last eight league
championships. And they also have a 9-2
Pacific-8 record this year.
"Hopefully we'll get a couple of good pitching
performances this weekend," said Stanford
coach Mark Marquess. "Pitching is always the
key. We're not going to outslug people nor
mally. Good pitching is why SC's winning and,
of course, they do have some outstanding hit
ters."
Six of the Trojan starting nine come into the
series batting better than .300. Leftfielder Tim
Tolman paces the team with .381. Power, more
than consistency, is the Trojan story, however,
and Engle is big in that department. The
righthanded-batting junior has a .352 average
with 41 RBI and 11 home runs thus far.
On the mound
USC has scheduled a sophomore, junior and
senior for mound duties against the Cards. To

day, Bordley (9-1,2.69 ERA), will be more deter
mined than ever to beat the Cardinals because
they are the only team to have defeated him in
his two years at USC. High school teammate
Larry Kuhn outdueled Bordley when Stanford
played the Trojans at Dedeaux Field in April.
Tomorrow, righthander Rod Boxberger will
be the Trojan pitcher. Boxberger was drafted in
the second round last spring by the New York
Mets but chose to stay at USC. Sunday senior
Ernie Mauritson will throw. Mauritson currently
leads the staff with a 2.01 ERA and has nine wins
against no losses this year.
Stanford will counter the Trojan pitching rota
tion with three pitchers who have demonstrated
consistency in their most recent outings. Brian
Harrison is slated to start today's contest, Joe
LoPresti will go Saturday, and Trojan-stopper
Larry Kuhn will get the nod in the final game.
"We haven't pitched well in league," said
Marquess. "Larry has probably been the most
consistent for us. All the pitchers are capable of
pitching well."
Tom Cuardino, cleanup batter for the Cardi
nals, will break the Stanford season mark for
home runs with his next rouridtripper. He has 13
al ready this year. NCAA walk recordholder Pepe
Hinojosa will be leading off for the Cards.
"We'll give them a battle for sure," said Guar
dino.

weeks ago against USC. McEnroe will be matched against former
Card Sandy Mayer Sunday night when the Cards face the Golden
Caters.
