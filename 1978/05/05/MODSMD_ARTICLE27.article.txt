# Iron man Guardino has made his mark
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
He's practically an institu
tion. Even if you've been to
only one Stanford baseball
game over the past four years,
you should have seen this de
dicated athlete. He's played in
every game Stanford has had
for the past four years.
This year his name has ap
peared in nearly every lines
core, often with the letters HR
by it. Tom Guardino, the Car
dinal first baseman and clean
up batter, has 13 homeruns this
season and with one more he
will set a season high in Stan
ford history.

Guardino's name already
appears several times in the
school's record books. The
three-year letterman currently
heads the lists of Stanford
greats in seven of the 11 career
batting categories. And at the
end of this year, he's likely to
have established a few season
bests also.
When asked about Guar
dino's performance this year, a
couple of his teammates
answered simply, "He's a
god." Dave Perez, who has
played alongside Guardino
since they both entered as
freshmen in 1974, called this a

"super year" for Guardino.
Perez said, "It's good to see
him swinging the bat so well."
Perez indicated the way
things have worked out for
Guardino have been espe
cially important after his
somewhat disappointing sea
son last year. Guardino en
tered his junior season with
high hopes after a productive
summer playing semi-pro ball
with the Boulder Colorado Col
legians.
"Last year I fell short of my
expectations, quite a bit shor
ter than I had hoped," said
Guardino. "For some reason or
another it just didn't happen.
There wasn't too much differ
ence in what I came into this
year wanting to achieve. I think
I just approached things a little
different this year.
"Before this season started,"
Guardino admitted, "I told
people 'I'm going to have a
good year.' Things have just
worked out. I never really got
into the groove last year."
Mental attitude
The 6-foot-3, 1% lb. senior
from San Jose credited his
mental attitude for this sea
son's success. There are a few
minor mechanical adjustments
Guardino has made recently —
such as waiting longer on the
pitch and reducing unneces
sary movement in his swing —
but by far the biggest factor has
been a gain in confidence. That
confidence showed up in his
.333 batting average and his 48
RBI.
"I've been playing since I
was little," Guardino
explained, "and for the past
four years I've played about 10
out of every 12 months. I prob
ably play close to 120 games a
year. I know I can hit!"

The entire Stanford baseball
organization is geared toward
Guardino's type of attitude. A
team goal is to develop each
player so he is the best possible
player. Coach Mark Marquess
and assistant coach Dean Stotz
expect certain basics out of
every player, but from there,
realization of goals is highly in
dividual.
"They don't tell me to swing
for the fences," said Guardino.
"Knowing wnat my job is (as
cleanup batter) and doing that
job is what's important. The
coaches don't preach different
things to different players."
Guardino did mention a few
team philosophies that have
carried over from one year to
the next and have helped to
structure the team. Expecta
tions that team members will
always give 100 per cent and
will project the image of a
"class opponent" are made
explicit, along with the ideas
that there will be a lot of hard
work in practice and winning is
not the most important issue.
"Winning is obviously im
portant," said Guardino, "but
maintaining a good image and
being good sports — that's
what's really important. It can
be difficult some times after
losing, but it's not a win at all
costs thing."
The "win at all costs" ap
proach is more typical of the
USC Trojans, according to
Guardino. Though they may
have excellent recruiting,
coaches, facilities and ability,
they're known for harassing
their opponents' coaches and
players. Guardino said, "I'm
happy I'm not in that situa
tion."

With his Stanford career only
seven games away from its
end, Guardino said, "Right
now I'd have to say that, in a
way, I'm looking forward to the
season being over, to catching
up in my classes and getting
ready for graduation. But I
know that one week after the
season is over, I'll wish it were
starting all over again. I know I
don't realize, while I'm doing
it, just how much it means to
me."
The aspect of Cardinal
baseball that Guardino expects
he will miss the most is the
team-sport camaraderie. The
relations between players on
the team are the best of any
Guardino ..said he has ever
been a part of, and that feeling
is shared by most of the players
and the coaches.
After college, baseball may
still play a role in Tom Guar
dino's life, at least fora while. It
would be impossible to im
agine the human biology major
separated from the sport after
playing it for the past 15 years.
There is a fair chance that
Guardino will be drafted by
one of the major league clubs
at the conclusion of the sea
son.
"I'm thinking very seriously
of playing this summer," said
Guardino. "Depending on
how I'm doing, I might play
longer. If it's worth it to me —
especially if I make enough
money to pay for another year
of school — I'll go ahead and
give it a try for a couple of
years. Next year or the follow
ing year, though, I expect to be
back in school."

Stanford's Tom Guardino needs only one more home run to set a new
school season mark of 14. He already holds the record in seven
Cardinal career batting categories.
He's practically an institu
tion. Even if you've been to
only one Stanford baseball
game over the past four years,
you should have seen this de
dicated athlete. He's played in
every game Stanford has had
for the past four years.
This year his name has ap
peared in nearly every lines
core, often with the letters HR
by it. Tom Guardino, the Car
dinal first baseman and clean
up batter, has 13 homeruns this
season and with one more he
will set a season high in Stan
ford history.

Guardino's name already
appears several times in the
school's record books. The
three-year letterman currently
heads the lists of Stanford
greats in seven of the 11 career
batting categories. And at the
end of this year, he's likely to
have established a few season
bests also.
When asked about Guar
dino's performance this year, a
couple of his teammates
answered simply, "He's a
god." Dave Perez, who has
played alongside Guardino
since they both entered as
freshmen in 1974, called this a

"super year" for Guardino.
Perez said, "It's good to see
him swinging the bat so well."
Perez indicated the way
things have worked out for
Guardino have been espe
cially important after his
somewhat disappointing sea
son last year. Guardino en
tered his junior season with
high hopes after a productive
summer playing semi-pro ball
with the Boulder Colorado Col
legians.
"Last year I fell short of my
expectations, quite a bit shor
ter than I had hoped," said
Guardino. "For some reason or
another it just didn't happen.
There wasn't too much differ
ence in what I came into this
year wanting to achieve. I think
I just approached things a little
different this year.
"Before this season started,"
Guardino admitted, "I told
people 'I'm going to have a
good year.' Things have just
worked out. I never really got
into the groove last year."
Mental attitude
The 6-foot-3, 1% lb. senior
from San Jose credited his
mental attitude for this sea
son's success. There are a few
minor mechanical adjustments
Guardino has made recently —
such as waiting longer on the
pitch and reducing unneces
sary movement in his swing —
but by far the biggest factor has
been a gain in confidence. That
confidence showed up in his
.333 batting average and his 48
RBI.
"I've been playing since I
was little," Guardino
explained, "and for the past
four years I've played about 10
out of every 12 months. I prob
ably play close to 120 games a
year. I know I can hit!"

The entire Stanford baseball
organization is geared toward
Guardino's type of attitude. A
team goal is to develop each
player so he is the best possible
player. Coach Mark Marquess
and assistant coach Dean Stotz
expect certain basics out of
every player, but from there,
realization of goals is highly in
dividual.
"They don't tell me to swing
for the fences," said Guardino.
"Knowing wnat my job is (as
cleanup batter) and doing that
job is what's important. The
coaches don't preach different
things to different players."
Guardino did mention a few
team philosophies that have
carried over from one year to
the next and have helped to
structure the team. Expecta
tions that team members will
always give 100 per cent and
will project the image of a
"class opponent" are made
explicit, along with the ideas
that there will be a lot of hard
work in practice and winning is
not the most important issue.
"Winning is obviously im
portant," said Guardino, "but
maintaining a good image and
being good sports — that's
what's really important. It can
be difficult some times after
losing, but it's not a win at all
costs thing."
The "win at all costs" ap
proach is more typical of the
USC Trojans, according to
Guardino. Though they may
have excellent recruiting,
coaches, facilities and ability,
they're known for harassing
their opponents' coaches and
players. Guardino said, "I'm
happy I'm not in that situa
tion."

With his Stanford career only
seven games away from its
end, Guardino said, "Right
now I'd have to say that, in a
way, I'm looking forward to the
season being over, to catching
up in my classes and getting
ready for graduation. But I
know that one week after the
season is over, I'll wish it were
starting all over again. I know I
don't realize, while I'm doing
it, just how much it means to
me."
The aspect of Cardinal
baseball that Guardino expects
he will miss the most is the
team-sport camaraderie. The
relations between players on
the team are the best of any
Guardino ..said he has ever
been a part of, and that feeling
is shared by most of the players
and the coaches.
After college, baseball may
still play a role in Tom Guar
dino's life, at least fora while. It
would be impossible to im
agine the human biology major
separated from the sport after
playing it for the past 15 years.
There is a fair chance that
Guardino will be drafted by
one of the major league clubs
at the conclusion of the sea
son.
"I'm thinking very seriously
of playing this summer," said
Guardino. "Depending on
how I'm doing, I might play
longer. If it's worth it to me —
especially if I make enough
money to pay for another year
of school — I'll go ahead and
give it a try for a couple of
years. Next year or the follow
ing year, though, I expect to be
back in school."
