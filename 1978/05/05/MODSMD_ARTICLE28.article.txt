## 
### Ivan Maisel 
Seventeen athletes from Stanford will join some of the
finest athletes in the nation at the annual West Coast Relays
on the Fresno State campus tomorrow.
The best track and field teams on the West Coast will be
challenged by runners from Tennessee, Oklahoma and
others.
Leading the Cardinal contingent will be senior sprinter
James Lofton, distance man Roy Kissin, and a 400-meter
relay team (Lofton, Darrin Nelson, Gordon Banks and Alan
Sheats) that has an excellent shot at placing well in the
meet.
The West Coast Relays annually attract national attention
because of the superlative performances that always seem
to occur at the meet. "Thirty world records have been set
during past relays and I see no reason why there won't be
more set this weekend," said Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan.
Jordan will be running in the 100 in the 55-and-over age
bracket and has set several records in the event.
"Fresno's track is one of the fastest in the country, and is
also one of the last remaining clay tracks in the country.
They expect good weather, and in the past, that has meant
good performances," said Jordan.
Jordan said he thinks if anyone will set the 31st world
record at Fresno, it will be the USC 800 relay team, led by
sprinter Clancy Edwards. Another squad with hopes for a
world record is the Washington State distance men, led by
Kenyan Henry Rono.
Stanford's representatives will have an excellent oppor
tunity to break some school records. In the hammer throw,
both Chuck Weidmann and Dave Thomson have a good
shot at a new record, and both the 400 relay team and the
mile relay team of Paul McCarthy, Banks, Sheats and Lofton
have chances to break their own record-setting pace.
This meet is considered a tune-up for the Pacific-8 meet
later this month at Oregon State. "Many of the people
we're sending will be entered in the same events at the
Pac-8 meet," said Jordan.
