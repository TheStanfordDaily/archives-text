## Amateurs first Netters tangle with the pros 
### Karen O'Leary 
Maples Pavilion is usually empty on Sunday nights, but that
won't be the case this Sunday when Stanford's varsity tennis
teams play host to the Golden Caters of World Team Tennis.
The match will be a benefit for women's sports teams at Stan
ford.
The Cards' defending NCAA champions and top-ranked men's
squad will combine with the second-ranked women's team to
play against one of the strongest teams in professional tennis.
The match will be played according to the WTT five-set format.
One set each of men's and women's singles and doubles and one
set of mixed doubles will be played. Stanford men's coach Dick
Could said this format will result in fast-paced, exciting action.
"From the spectators' standpoint, this will be a very exciting
evening," said the Card coach. "It's a whole different thing from
regular matches, with a little bit of everything going on in a short
period of time. There'll be a good variety of top-flight tennis."
The Stanford Band and the Dollies will also be present.
The action on the court will begin at 7 p.m. when Stanford's
mixed doubles team of Barbara Jordan and Bill Maze will meet a
team to be selected from the Caters. In men's singles, it is ex
pected that 1973 NCAA singles champ and former Card Sandy
Mayer will face freshman star John McEnroe. The two have met
before, with McEnroe downing Mayer in the round of 16 last
summer at Wimbledon.
Mayer, who became a Golden Cater this season, was voted the
1976 Most Valuable Player in the WTT.
Women's doubles
The women's doubles match will pit two-time intercollegiate
champions Diane Morrison and Susie Hagey against a Gater team
to be announced. Then Barb's younger sister Kathy will represent
Stanford in the women's singles, possibly facing Wimbledon
champion Virginia Wade.
Gould said Wade will definitely be at Maples, but Cater coach
Frew McMillan has not yet announced his line-up. In addition to
Mayer, Wade and McMillan, the Caters have Michael Waymen,
liana Kloss and Marise Kruger on their roster.
Stanford should give the Caters a good match, according to
Gould. "We've got an excellent team," said Gould, "and we are
strong at every position. This match will be worth watching."
Men's doubles action will feature the Card team of Matt Mitch
ell and Perry Wright. Two years ago, when Stanford hosted the
Caters for the first time, the Mitchell-Wright team defeated
McMillan and Tom Okker, at the time one of the top doubles
pairings in the world.
"Our team will get a chance to play world class tennis in front of
home crowds," said Could. "They'll compete against players
they wouldn't ordinarily meet in collegiate tennis. And it's espe
cially important to remember that this is a benefit, so the athletes
are helping themselves."
Take on Bears
The Stanford men will also be taking on the Cal Bears tomorrow
at Berkeley. Though it is undefeated through 18 matches this
year, Gould said he thinks Stanford will have to play extremely
well to win against the Bears. "They're a fast, young, team and
rated in the top 10 in the country. If we aren't prepared, their
eagerness could be the edge that beats us," he said.
Could said the Cards have played up to their capabilities only a
few times this year. "We've been plagued with little nagging
injuries and colds this season," he said. "A lot of the guys have
played sick and hurt, and although they've done well individu
ally, as a team we haven't been up to full strength.
"I'd like to rest a couple of the players if I could, but we may
need the full line-up to defeat them," added Gould. Meanwhile,
the Card women — with only one loss in 18 matches this season
— will be competing in the individual Northern California Athle
tic Conference Championships today and tomorrow in Berkeley.
The Cards have already won the Nor-Cal team title.
"The league isn't that strong," said women's coach Anne
Gould, "so this tournament isn't as important as some of the
others we've played in the season. But it will help prepare us for
the regionals on May 18-21, which will be very tough."

home crowds," said Could. "They'll compete against players
they wouldn't ordinarily meet in collegiate tennis. And it's espe
cially important to remember that this is a benefit, so the athletes
are helping themselves."
Take on Bears
The Stanford men will also be taking on the Cal Bears tomorrow
at Berkeley. Though it is undefeated through 18 matches this
year, Gould said he thinks Stanford will have to play extremely
well to win against the Bears. "They're a fast, young, team and
rated in the top 10 in the country. If we aren't prepared, their
eagerness could be the edge that beats us," he said.
Could said the Cards have played up to their capabilities only a
few times this year. "We've been plagued with little nagging
injuries and colds this season," he said. "A lot of the guys have
played sick and hurt, and although they've done well individu
ally, as a team we haven't been up to full strength.
"I'd like to rest a couple of the players if I could, but we may
need the full line-up to defeat them," added Gould. Meanwhile,
the Card women — with only one loss in 18 matches this season
— will be competing in the individual Northern California Athle
tic Conference Championships today and tomorrow in Berkeley.
The Cards have already won the Nor-Cal team title.
"The league isn't that strong," said women's coach Anne
Gould, "so this tournament isn't as important as some of the
others we've played in the season. But it will help prepare us for
the regionals on May 18-21, which will be very tough."
Maples Pavilion is usually empty on Sunday nights, but that
won't be the case this Sunday when Stanford's varsity tennis
teams play host to the Golden Caters of World Team Tennis.
The match will be a benefit for women's sports teams at Stan
ford.
The Cards' defending NCAA champions and top-ranked men's
squad will combine with the second-ranked women's team to
play against one of the strongest teams in professional tennis.
The match will be played according to the WTT five-set format.
One set each of men's and women's singles and doubles and one
set of mixed doubles will be played. Stanford men's coach Dick
Could said this format will result in fast-paced, exciting action.
"From the spectators' standpoint, this will be a very exciting
evening," said the Card coach. "It's a whole different thing from
regular matches, with a little bit of everything going on in a short
period of time. There'll be a good variety of top-flight tennis."
The Stanford Band and the Dollies will also be present.
The action on the court will begin at 7 p.m. when Stanford's
mixed doubles team of Barbara Jordan and Bill Maze will meet a
team to be selected from the Caters. In men's singles, it is ex
pected that 1973 NCAA singles champ and former Card Sandy
Mayer will face freshman star John McEnroe. The two have met
before, with McEnroe downing Mayer in the round of 16 last
summer at Wimbledon.
Mayer, who became a Golden Cater this season, was voted the
1976 Most Valuable Player in the WTT.
Women's doubles
The women's doubles match will pit two-time intercollegiate
champions Diane Morrison and Susie Hagey against a Gater team
to be announced. Then Barb's younger sister Kathy will represent
Stanford in the women's singles, possibly facing Wimbledon
champion Virginia Wade.
Gould said Wade will definitely be at Maples, but Cater coach
Frew McMillan has not yet announced his line-up. In addition to
Mayer, Wade and McMillan, the Caters have Michael Waymen,
liana Kloss and Marise Kruger on their roster.
Stanford should give the Caters a good match, according to
Gould. "We've got an excellent team," said Gould, "and we are
strong at every position. This match will be worth watching."
Men's doubles action will feature the Card team of Matt Mitch
ell and Perry Wright. Two years ago, when Stanford hosted the
Caters for the first time, the Mitchell-Wright team defeated
McMillan and Tom Okker, at the time one of the top doubles
pairings in the world.
"Our team will get a chance to play world class tennis in front of
home crowds," said Could. "They'll compete against players
they wouldn't ordinarily meet in collegiate tennis. And it's espe
cially important to remember that this is a benefit, so the athletes
are helping themselves."
