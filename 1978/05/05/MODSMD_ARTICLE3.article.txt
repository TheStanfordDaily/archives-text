Los Angeles (AP) — A 37-year-old
sex offender shot to death in an ap
parent kidnapping attempt Monday
is a prime suspect in the Hillside
Strangler case, suburban Glendale
Police Chief Duane Baker said yes
terday.
The body of Richard Reynolds was
found in a car with a 29-year-old wo
man, Roxanne Barnwell, Monday
night outside Glendale Community
Hospital. Both had been shot to
death with small caliber handguns.
"It appears that Richard Reynolds
was attempting to kidnap Barnwell,"
Baker said. "He had been laying in
wait there for some time."
Barnwell's Glendale residence,
not far from the hospital, is a block
from where two Strangler victims,
Kristina Weckler and Cindy Lee
Hudspeth, had lived.

Sex offender
Baker said Reynolds, a registered
sex offender, had been investigated
in December in connection with the
chain of 13 Hillside stranglings since
last October and he remained a sus
pect. Baker said a search of Reynolds'
La Crescenta apartment had yielded
no clues connecting him to the
Strangler case. But he said there
were many items still to be analyzed
and indicated that he considered
Reynolds a good suspect in the case.
"We would hope that Reynolds
would be the suspect, but we're not
going to say until we're sure," Baker
told reporters at a news conference
here.
"He's a very good suspect, even
though he's dead."
Cmdr. William Booth, a spokes
man for the Los Angeles police Hill
side Strangler Task Force, said the

unit did not consider Reynolds a
prime suspect but was assisting
Glendale police with their investiga
tion.
"We have nothing at this time to
my knowledge to show that he
(Reynolds) was connected with those
other crimes (the 13 stranglings),"
Booth said.
Analyzing fingerprints
Glendale's Baker said investigators
from the task force were assisting
with the analyzing of items, includ
ing fingerprints, fodjnd in Reynolds'
hillside apartment.
Baker said the alleged kidnapping
attempt might provide a clue to the
method used by the Strangler to lure
victims into his car.
"You put a gun in their face and
convince them you're capable of
using it," Baker said. "In this case, he
got surprised and rightfully so."
Baker said Reynolds' last known
arrest occurred 11 years ago, but
would not specify the nature of the
crime. He said, however, that
Reynolds was among registered sex
offenders being checked by au
thorities in connection with the 13
stranglings that have stymied police
since last October.
No surveillance
"Reynolds was checked once and
officers indicated he would be worth
another check," Baker said. The man
had not been under surveillance,
Baker said, but officers are now try
ing to reconstruct his activities at the
times of the murders.
Baker said investigators have de
termined that Reynolds and Barnwell
did not know each other. The wo
man's husband, John, said he had
bought his wife the handgun found
with her for protection against the
Strangler.
"My wife said that if she could get a
crack at the Hillside Stranger she
would," said Barnwell. "She wanted
to wipe out the HillsideStrangler,and
I believe she did."
Reynolds apparently had sepa
rated from his wife, Victoria, 31, sev
eral months ago.
Gail Cloutier, 35, a neighbor in
Reynolds' middle-class neighbor
hood, said a plainclothes inves
tigator, identifying himself as a
member of the Stranger task force,

interviewed her briefly last January
or February about Reynolds.
"He showed me a badge. He came
very late at night," said Cloutier. "He
asked whether or not there were par
ties, whether he had women coming
in and out, what type of person he
was."
Cloutier said she had known
Reynolds as a neighbor for about
three years. "He was very quiet, a
very good neighbor."

or February about Reynolds.
"He showed me a badge. He came
very late at night," said Cloutier. "He
asked whether or not there were par
ties, whether he had women coming
in and out, what type of person he
was."
Cloutier said she had known
Reynolds as a neighbor for about
three years. "He was very quiet, a
very good neighbor."
Los Angeles (AP) — A 37-year-old
sex offender shot to death in an ap
parent kidnapping attempt Monday
is a prime suspect in the Hillside
Strangler case, suburban Glendale
Police Chief Duane Baker said yes
terday.
The body of Richard Reynolds was
found in a car with a 29-year-old wo
man, Roxanne Barnwell, Monday
night outside Glendale Community
Hospital. Both had been shot to
death with small caliber handguns.
"It appears that Richard Reynolds
was attempting to kidnap Barnwell,"
Baker said. "He had been laying in
wait there for some time."
Barnwell's Glendale residence,
not far from the hospital, is a block
from where two Strangler victims,
Kristina Weckler and Cindy Lee
Hudspeth, had lived.

Sex offender
Baker said Reynolds, a registered
sex offender, had been investigated
in December in connection with the
chain of 13 Hillside stranglings since
last October and he remained a sus
pect. Baker said a search of Reynolds'
La Crescenta apartment had yielded
no clues connecting him to the
Strangler case. But he said there
were many items still to be analyzed
and indicated that he considered
Reynolds a good suspect in the case.
"We would hope that Reynolds
would be the suspect, but we're not
going to say until we're sure," Baker
told reporters at a news conference
here.
"He's a very good suspect, even
though he's dead."
Cmdr. William Booth, a spokes
man for the Los Angeles police Hill
side Strangler Task Force, said the

unit did not consider Reynolds a
prime suspect but was assisting
Glendale police with their investiga
tion.
"We have nothing at this time to
my knowledge to show that he
(Reynolds) was connected with those
other crimes (the 13 stranglings),"
Booth said.
Analyzing fingerprints
Glendale's Baker said investigators
from the task force were assisting
with the analyzing of items, includ
ing fingerprints, fodjnd in Reynolds'
hillside apartment.
Baker said the alleged kidnapping
attempt might provide a clue to the
method used by the Strangler to lure
victims into his car.
"You put a gun in their face and
convince them you're capable of
using it," Baker said. "In this case, he
got surprised and rightfully so."
Baker said Reynolds' last known
arrest occurred 11 years ago, but
would not specify the nature of the
crime. He said, however, that
Reynolds was among registered sex
offenders being checked by au
thorities in connection with the 13
stranglings that have stymied police
since last October.
No surveillance
"Reynolds was checked once and
officers indicated he would be worth
another check," Baker said. The man
had not been under surveillance,
Baker said, but officers are now try
ing to reconstruct his activities at the
times of the murders.
Baker said investigators have de
termined that Reynolds and Barnwell
did not know each other. The wo
man's husband, John, said he had
bought his wife the handgun found
with her for protection against the
Strangler.
"My wife said that if she could get a
crack at the Hillside Stranger she
would," said Barnwell. "She wanted
to wipe out the HillsideStrangler,and
I believe she did."
Reynolds apparently had sepa
rated from his wife, Victoria, 31, sev
eral months ago.
Gail Cloutier, 35, a neighbor in
Reynolds' middle-class neighbor
hood, said a plainclothes inves
tigator, identifying himself as a
member of the Stranger task force,

interviewed her briefly last January
or February about Reynolds.
"He showed me a badge. He came
very late at night," said Cloutier. "He
asked whether or not there were par
ties, whether he had women coming
in and out, what type of person he
was."
Cloutier said she had known
Reynolds as a neighbor for about
three years. "He was very quiet, a
very good neighbor."
