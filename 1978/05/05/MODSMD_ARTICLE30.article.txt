# Even the subs are super on this team

If you ever wandered by the Stanford Tennis
Stadium to watch the top team in the nation
practice, you would probably be amazed not
only by the ability of John McEnroe, Bill Maze
and Matt Mitchell, but also at the play of the
non-starting members of the team. Dave
Becker, Alan Blumberg, Henry Brandon, Andy
Chase, Greg Hing, Jeff Jones and Dave Larson
are not household names to Stanford tennis
fans, but they are all certainly quite talented.
"All these guys are top players, and they really
add a lot to the team not only in their play, but in
their team spirit," said Card coach Dick Gould.
"No team in the country has the depth we have.
If my second six were to form their own team,
they would probably rank somewhere in the top
20, probably closer to 10 than 20. The toughest
thing is getting over the frustration of not play
ing. If this is overcome, practicing with players
of high caliber every day can do nothing but
help. I'm looking for these players to help our
team in future years."
All the non-starters have had good success on
the national junior circuit and some have even
ventured onto the pro circuit. At most any other
school, making the top sixwould be no problem
for them. At some schools the Stanford subs
would be playing No. 1 or 2.
Chase, a freshman, and Becker, a sophomore,
probably have the most impressive credentials
of the bunch. Chase has two national titles
under his belt besides a No. 1 national ranking in
doubles he earned last year. According to
Gould, Chase has the potential to become one
of Stanford's best players, which is in itself quite
a compliment.
Becker is considered to be one of Canada's
most promising players. He has played in the
junior competition at Forest Hills and reached
the junior quarterfinals at Wimbledon, which
has the largest junior tournament in the world.
In addition, he has won Canadian champion
ships and last year he spent the tournament
season competing in professional tournaments
in Australia and Europe.

All the other members also have outstanding
records of winning. Blumberg was No. 4 in
South Africa junior rankings last year. He also
won the Australian Jewish Championships last
December.
Brandon, a senior redshirt, won the Georgia
State Open Junior Tournament's singles and
doubles crowns to go along with his Pacific
Coast Championships junior title.
"Unlimited potential" is the phrase Gould
uses to describe freshman Greg Hing. The
freshman from Paradise Valley, Ariz., reached
the finals of the tough California State Champ
ionships last June.
Jones won the California Interscholastic Fed
eration's title in high school last May before
entering Stanford. He also brought his No. 3
southern California singles and No. 4 national
doubles ranking to the Farm with him.
Larson is the only graduating senior of the
reserves. He has been on the team for four years
after an incredible high school career. In high
school Larson won back-to-back state individual
titles and was perenially ranked in the top 10 of
the Pacific Northwest rankings.
"I guess the big problem is staying up men
tally," said Larson. "All of us were superstars in
high school and were used to getting all the
attention. Here we're just another member of
the team. If you can stay up mentally, you can't
help but benefit from practicing every day with
such top players. I've enjoyed being able to play
every day, meeting the McEnroes, Mitchells,
Mazes and Rasts, and just being on the team. I
wish I could have played more, but when I came
here I knew I'd be low man on the totem pole."
So they keep practicing two and one-half
hours a day. All are walk-ons. Several made the
team through campus-wide tryouts which con
sists of 70 to 80 people a year. In the subs' minds,
though, there is that glimmer of hope that keeps
them going, the thought of winning the big
match against UCLA in Stanford's Tennis
Stadium in front of 2000 screaming fans.

Dave Becker, one of the Stanford netters who does not get a lot of
varsity playing action, has won titles in Canada and reached the
quarterfinals at Wimbledon's junior tournament.
