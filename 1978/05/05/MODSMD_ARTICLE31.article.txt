# Findings cite communication problems

### Paul Spaeth 
According to a survey conducted last
spring by the Student Athletic Commit
tee (SAC), though a majority of Stan
ford students regard athletics as "sig
nificant" or "very significant" parts of
their educational program, there exists
"a serious communication problem be
tween the Department of Athletics,
Physical Education and Recreation
(DAPER) and the Stanford community."
Initially a small-scale unfunded ques
tionnaire to be distributed to a sample
of the student body, the project de
veloped into a six-page survey mailed
to all 10,391 registered students when
the president's office deemed it worthy
enough to justify a $12,000 grant.
A report of the results of the survey
showed 2350 (24.2 per cent) of the
forms were returned, "a rate slightly
better than average for similar sur
veys." The survey questioned students
regarding participation in and attitudes
toward all levels of athletics at Stanford
â€” varsity, club, intramural, physical
education and recreation. The survey
also sought general attitudes concern
ing the value of athletics, DAPER, and
other athletic organizations.
"This is the biggest sample of college
athletics ever undertaken," said Ron
Rice, a Ph.D. student in communica
tion. "And it is not concerned only with
varsity but with all sports. Because of

these two things I think it has a lot of
validity."
Rice, who did all the computer work
and analysis on the report and eventu
ally turned it into his master's thesis,
noted "that two significant results of
the survey are that students don't feel
they have enough input into the athle
tic decision-making process and that
students are unfamiliar with a lot of
things having to do with athletics at
Stanford."
Not surprised
His conclusions, however, came as
no surprise to SAC. This ad hoc group
of students and members of the Stan
ford community was formed for the
purpose of bridging this communica
tion gap and assisting the University in
maintaining and improving the quality
of athletics at Stanford.
Stanford record-setting quarterback
Guy Benjamin, one of the key figures
behind the survey and a member of
SAC, said the results were expected.
"We knew that there was a general lack
of communication between the athletic
department and the students," he said,
"which is one of the major reasons be
hind the survey and the formation of
SAC.
"Since we are an unofficial organiza
tion, we needed to legitimize ourselves
by finding out who and what we repre
sent. So we designed the survey to
learn the interests of the students,"

said Benjamin.
Having tabulated the results and
completed a data analysis, SAC then
drew up a list of eight recommenda
tions to DAPER. The list suggests im
provements not only in areas such as
club sports, facilities and equality of
opportunity, but also in communica
tion between the athletic department
and the student body.
"It is evident not only from the survey
results but also from the experience of
a wide variety of people in the Stanford
community that the department's re
sponses to sincere questions about its
programs and policies are frequently
defensive and unsatisfactory," the re
port states.
Student intern
SAC therefore recommended the es
tablishment of a student intern who
"would participate in all departmental
staff meetings and have access to all
financial and management informa
tion. This person would also be en
couraged to meet with coaches and
others on the department staff on a fre
quent basis to keep abreast of current
developments, and would solicit com
munity input on current issues."
In addition SAC recommended:
"The department should provide more
information to interested members of
the Stanford community of all elements
of the department's operations."
Athletic director Joe Ruetz said the

survey was "very good in that it deter
mined student perceptions about ath
letics and how we (the athletic depart
ment) are viewed." However, he does
not see a serious communication prob
lem.
"In some ways, there is a communi
cation problem. But we're in the busi
ness of making decisions. When some
one walks in and asks for something
and we say no, they say there is a com
munication problem. I feel we have
been quite open when people have
come in to talk to us. On the other hand
I don't feel that the percentages of a
survey are adequate measures to deal
with a fundamental decision-making
process."
Ruetz indicated, however, that a stu
dent intern might be useful. "No one
individual can represent and com
municate with a community
adequately. But an internship would
help in that it shows we are not afraid
for people to listen to our discussions
or decision making."
Ruetz said he is also redoing the for
mat of the budget to make it easier for
interested persons to understand.

commendations can be obtained free
