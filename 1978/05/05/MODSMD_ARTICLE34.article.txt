# Kansas City chooses Kellar
## 
### 
Wide receiver Bill Kellar was
taken on the seventh round of
the National Football League's
draft Wednesday morning, giv
ing Stanford its best showing
ever in tf\e annual affair.
Four Cards were taken over
all. Tuesday wide receiver
James Lofton was the No. 1
pick of the Green Bay Packers,
offensive tackle Cordon King
was the top choice of the New
York Giants and the 10th player
taken overall, and quarterback
Guy Benjamin went on the
second round to Miami. Ben
jamin was the Dolphins' top
pick, however, since they had
no first round choice.
The Cards' previous best had

been in 1972 when two players
were drafted in the first round,
one in the second and one in
the eighth.
Kellar, the second player
picked by the Chiefs in the
seventh round, was pleased to
be going to Kansas City. "As far
as I'm concerned, there were a
number of teams where there
was a need for receivers, and
Kansas City was one of them,"
said Kellar. "They said they
were definitely looking for re
ceivers, and said I was the kind
who could help and also con
tribute on special teams. I'm
really excited about it."
Leigh Steinberg, who is rep
resenting Kellar along with
Benjamin and King, said, "It is
an incredibly good place for
him to go. They have not been
strong at wide receiver or on
special teams, and Bill can help
them in both those areas."
The Chiefs' top receivers for
most of last year were Larry
Brunson and Henry Marshall.
Kansas City also drafted two
other receivers along with Kel
lar.
In addition to Kellar being

drafted by a team which can
use his talents, the other three
Cards were also drafted into
situations which suit them
well.
The Packers need help on of
fense, and Lofton should pro
vide that big play capability
they have been lacking.
"It was cut and dried when
Lofton was available," said
Packer coach and general
manager Bart Starr. "Even
though he has been productive
in college, he has not even ap
proached his potential in foot
ball."
