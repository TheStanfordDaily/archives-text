# Carter denounces inequities in legal system

### 
Los Angeles (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter, in a ringing denuncia
tion of the legal profession, declared
yesterday that the vast majority of
Americans don't get adequate legal
representation while those with
means get all the help they need.
In an address to the Los Angeles
Bar Association, Carter also found
fault with a legal system he charac
terized as being too lenient with
"big-shot crooks" — a reference to
white-collar crime.
"We have the heaviest concentra
tion of lawyers on earth — one for
every 500 Americans," the president
said in questioning the quality of
legal assistance available to people.
But, he added, "90 per cent of our
lawyers serve 10 per cent of our
people. We are over-lawyered and
under-represented."
Carter said the United States needs

more women and minority judges,
fewer and shorter lawsuits and more
legal aid for poor and middle-income
persons.
He also called on lawyers to slow
down their fee increases as part of his
voluntary anti-inflation program and
called for "free and open competi
tion" in setting fees and advertising
them.
Carter observed that lawyers often
have attempted to thwart civil rights
and economic justice, have been re
sponsible for long delays in court
proceedings and have tended to
favor the rich over the poor.
"I have inspected many prisons
and I know that nearly all inmates are
drawn from the ranks of the power
less and the poor. A child of privilege
frequently receives the benefit of the
doubt; a child of poverty seldom
does," the president said.

The president denounced white
collar criminals who, he said, cheat
consumers of millions of dollars and
corrupt the government. "Too often
these big-shot crooks escape the full
consequences of theiracts," he said.
Within a few hours of Carter's
speech, the American Bar Associa
tion (ABA) issued a statement taking
exception to it.
"We are surprised he accuses us of
resisting innovation," said ABA Pres
ident William Spann of Atlanta. "This
is particularly astonishing in view of
the fact that we are due to meet at the
White House next week on establish
ing the Center for Defense Services
to help the poor accused of crime.
"Since the president appears to
also be criticizing the Justice De
partment, it would seem that his
basic complaint is with a system that

can only be corrected through his
leadership," Spann said. "To be
sure, lawyers can do more but
lawyers can do only so much. The
ultimate responsibility rests with
government."
The ABA is a trade group, to which
some 230,000 of the nation's 400,000
lawyers belong.
Carter urged Congress to move
speedily in passing a new federal
criminal code. And he said vagrancy
and public intoxication should be
decriminalized to relieve over
worked courts for more important
cases.
Carter also said he is ordering spe
cial efforts to find more women,
blacks and Hispanics to be nomi
nated to federal judgeships. "Of the
525 federal judges, only 20 are black
or Hispanics and only six are wo
men," he noted.
