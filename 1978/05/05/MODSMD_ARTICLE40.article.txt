Higher prices push up inflation
Washington — Rapidly rising food costs and
sharply higher prices for jewelry pushed
wholesale prices up 1.3 per cent in April for the
biggest inflationary surge at the wholesale level in
more than three years, the government said yes
terday.
The price report confirmed fears that inflation is
stuck at a very high level since wholesale prices
have increased 3.6 per cent since the beginning of
the year.
Higher wholesale prices are bad news for con
sumers since they eventually result in higher retail
prices. Consumer prices already have been in
creasing substantially this year, rising 0.8 per cent
in March alone.
Wholesale food prices rose another 1.9 per cent
in April, raisingto6.7percentthe total increase for
the year. There were sharply higher prices for pro
cessed poultry and pork, fresh fruits and vegeta
bles and dairy products.
Prices also increased for automobiles, rugs, fur
niture and household appliances.
But the big surprise was an unusually large jump
in prices of jewelry, which analysts said was due to
the rising price of gold and which they said proba
bly would not be repeated.
Nixon accused of 'fraud' in suit
San Francisco — Former President Richard Ni
xon, accused of "fraud" among other charges, was
sued yesterday in a class action civil suit aimed at
denying him the profits from his newly published
memoirs.
The suit, entitled "People versus PORN," was
brought in Santa Clara County Superior Court by
plaintiffs J.T. Anderson of Fremont and Madge Van
Horn of San Jose. The suit said PORN meant "Pro
fit of Richard Nixon."
The suit asked compensatory damages of $1.3
million, punitive damages amounting to "20 per
cent of the total net worth of Nixon" and unnamed
others, plus costs of the suit and legal fees. The
suit demands all these funds, less costs of the suit,
should go into the U.S. Treasury.
At a news conference to announce the suit,
lawyer A. Lee Sanders told reporters U.S. tax
payers "feel that Richard Nixon has already cost
this country enough" and that the information in
Nixon's new $19.95 book "already has been
bought and paid for by the American people."
Rainstorm floods New Orleans
New Orleans — Roads were clogged with aban
doned cars yesterday and snakes slithered
through the streets as floodwaters receded from
one of the area's worst rainstorms in 50 years. The
deluge was blamed for four deaths and an esti
mated $60 million damage.
Water remained a problem in suburban com
munities with houses still flooded. But conditions
in most areas eased from Wednesday when ducks
floated down Canal Street.
It rained so hard on Wednesday — which ironi
cally was national Sun Day — that the National

Weather Service rain gauge broke after reaching
8.67 inches in five hours. Unofficial totals hit 10.5
inches in some areas. Places where floods previ
ously were unknown became rivers, carrying
catamarans and motor boats instead of cars.
House budgets tuition credits
Washington — The House voted yesterday, 227
to 136, to make room in its tentative budget for tax
credits to help pay tuition of students in private
elementary and secondary schools as well as col
leges.
The vote, although it does not directly advance
legislation for such credits, was a rebuff to Presi
dent Jimmy Carter and the House's own Budget
Committee.
Carter has proposed instead liberalizing existing
loan and grant programs so that more middle in
come students could qualify and more funds
would be available.
The committee recommended against any pro
vision for tuition credits.
The Senate has included in its tentative budget
proposal provision for tuition tax credits without
specifically limiting these to college expenses, but
its Budget Committee favored this course.
Two killed in Florida tornado
Clearwater, Fla. — Atornado cuta swath through
an elementary school yesterday, ripping away
walls and roofing as terrified children ran for
safety. At least two youngsters were killed, includ
ing one celebrating his sixth birthday, and 94 per
sons were injured.
"I laid on the floor and saw half the school
gone," said a shaken fourth-grader.
After tearing through the High Point Elementary
School shortly before noon, the twister skipped
into a nearby high school vocational facility, then
hit a trailer park and upended a half-dozen mobile
homes.
It was the worst of several tornadoes that hit
Florida, causing power outages and heavy damage
at Gainesville, disrupting an airport at Sebring and
flipping a truck trailer on a highway near
Kenansville.
Brezhnev: ban neutron bomb
Borm, West Germany — Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev began his long-delayed visit to West
Germany yesterday by calling for world renuncia
tion of neutron weapons and renewed efforts to
ward disarmament.
Human rights activists and German rightists
held demonstrations against his visit.
In a dinner speech last night, the Soviet leader
said his country would do all it can be ensure
world peace and that all nations should renounce
"new systems of mass destruction weapons" such
as the neutron bomb, which has been developed
by the United States but not deployed.
Congressmen's finances released
Washington — About one-third of House mem

bers have $100,000 or more in outside financial
interests and several have portfolios so diversified
that many votes they cast could affect their fi
nances, House records show.
Only 22 members reported they had no signific
ant income outside their basic $57,500 congres
sional salary.
Several reported they were heavily in debt. Rep.
Fermand St. Germain, who heads a House sub
committee that overseas banking practices, dis
closed debts of more than $500,000. The debts
apparently are secured by five commercial proper
ties which he owns and rents.
The first detailed look at the financial holdings
of the 435 House members showed that 153 had
financial interests of more than $100,000, exclud
ing personal residences.
MOVE begins to surrender
Philadelphia — Members of a band of radicals
called MOVE began surrendering to police yester
day under a fragile truce aimed at ending a 50-day
blockade of their rat-infested, red brick house.
Under terms of the agreement, the city is to
swap food and water for MOVE'S guns and explo
sives in the hope that the mop-haired anarchists
will-move on.
Merle Austin Africa, the first to surrender,
leaped to the sidewalk grinning and with hands
thrust into her jeans. She was escorted to a red
police communications van by detectives and
MOVE'S lawyer.
Soybean trading called technical
Chicago — Trading in the soybean complex was
mostly technical yesterday. Cash prices were firm
due to a lack of farmer sales and a pickup in ship
ments from the Great Lakes, dealers said.
Final bids for soybeans ranged from 3 cents to 9
cents higher, with May contracts quoted at $7.17 a
bushel. Wheat was VU cents to 3 cents higher, May
$2.97; corn was 3% cents to 4V2 cents higher, May
$2.51 V* and oats were 2Vi cents to4Vi cents higher,
May $1.38%.

wholesale prices last month.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off
more than 10 points in the first hour, cut its loss to
