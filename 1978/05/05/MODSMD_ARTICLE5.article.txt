# Trial period proposed for Western Culture courses
## 
### Peter Brett 
At yesterday's Faculty Senate meet
ing, the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (C-US) recom
mended that the next two academic
years be "set aside as an experimen
tal period during which several
three-quarter courses are to be tried
out as alternative, voluntary, pilot"
Western Culture Requirement
courses.
The proposal sparked considera
ble discussion among the faculty.
According to Assoc. English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz, chairman of the
Western Culture Task Force, the ex
perimental period will provide an
opportunity to get faculty opinions
on the courses.
In addition, the experimental
period will provide a chance to judge
students' ability to deal with the
amount of independent work in
cluded in the Western Culture
courses.
The recommendations of C-US
also included tentative criteria by
which the experimental sequences
should be evaluated. A sequence
should "include the study of a con
siderable number, and share a basic
core, of primary works or basic
texts," stated the C-US report.
Courses must also deal with more
than one national and linguistic
sub-culture, cover the entire spec
trum of time from ancient to mod
ern, and be approached through
more than one discipline.

If lectures are the heart of the
course, there should be at least two
hours a week of small group instruc
tion by faculty or instructors with a
Ph.D. with fewer than 20 students.
The study of primary works will be
the small groups' major objective,
according to the C-US report.
The recommendations of C-US will
be discussed at subsequent Faculty
Senate meetings and voted on be
fore the end of the year.
Concern about class size was voi
ced by Asst. Philosophy Prof.
Michael Bratman. Bratman said the
attempts to cover the same material

in the courses coupled with budget
ary constraints would probably result
in large lecture classes.
However, "We should make sure
that at some point students have the
chance to interact actively with a fa
culty member," he said.
Asst. Political Science Prof. Nan
nerl Keohane agreed, "This kind of
material is peculiarly conducive to
discussion," she added.
Extending present courses and
new courses should both be consi
dered for inclusion in the pilot
period, according to the report.
Religious Studies Prof. William
Clebsch said, however, "we cannot
tinker with courses and expand
them" without destroying their qual
ity.
Clebsch used the Humanities 60
series as an example. If that series is
modified to include post-doctoral,

instead of pre-doctoral TAs, then the
program will be significantly diffe
rent, he said.
In other business, President
Richard Lyman responded to several
questions posed by members of the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR) regarding the recent
Board of Trustees corporate proxy
resolution votes.
