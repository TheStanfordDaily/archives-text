# Lyons questions fee levying change
## 
### Dave Ansley 
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said yesterday that he has "re
servations" about a pending ASSU
constitutional amendment permit
ting graduate students only to vote
on fee assessments for graduate or
, ganizations.
He indicated he would recom
mend that President Richard Lyman
reject the funding change.
The amendment received a 71 per
cent "yes" vote in student balloting
last month, and it was certified as

approved by the ASSU Senate last
week.
Final adoption requires Lyman's
approval.
Reservations
"You could say that I have reserva
tions that will be reflected in my re
commendation to the president,"
Lyons said.
"But he has quite an independent
mind on this," Lyons added. "He
may not necessarily refuse to ap
prove the amendment."
Lyman was out of town until late
last night and could not be reached
for comment.
The amendment would permit fee
assessment proposals that benefit
only graduate student organizations
to be voted on by just graduate stu
dents.
Lowers voter turnout
In addition, it would reduce the
turnout required for passage of
graduate fee assessment proposals
to 10 per cent of the graduate stu
dents.
The present system requires all as
sessments to be voted on by both
undergraduate and graduates and
requires a 20 per cent turnout for
passage.
Lyons said he has reservations
about both of these provisions.
"The requirement that 20 per cent
vote before the University collect
fees is minimal but acceptable," he
said. "The amendment would re
duce it even more, while leaving
some (other fee assessments) at 20
per cent. That doesn't seem fair.
Distinction
"Also, over time, we have rarely
made a distinction between graduate
and undergraduate affairs in student
life. This amendment would create a
situation where the University is col
lecting money for an organization
that excludes an entire category of
students.
"We are sympathetic, however, to
the strong need for organizations
that integrate graduate interests."
Such an organization, the
Graduate Student Association, has a
fee assessment on next week's spe
cial election ballot.
ASSU Co-president Greg Larson, a
member of the GSA, said yes
terday a prompt resolution of the
split assessment issue is necessary to
avoid confusion at the polls.
"Lyman will have to take action by
early Monday, because we'll need
the senate's interpretation of the as
sessment before the baJlots are
printed on Tuesday," Larson said.
The ASSU Senate had approved an
assessment to be voted on by
only graduate students for the next
week's ballot, Larson said, on the as
sumption that Lyman would approve
the amendment.
