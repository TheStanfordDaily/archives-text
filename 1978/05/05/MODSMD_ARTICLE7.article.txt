# Holocaust commemorated
## Elie Wiesel discusses what it means to 'remember' 
### Jonathan Slater 
He said "remember."
Before a packed house in Memorial Au
ditorium last night, Elie Wiesel, a well
known survivor of the Holocaust, spent
more than an hour discussing what it means
to remember.
He asked many questions and gave few
answers.
Wiesel spoke on Holocaust Day, or Yom
Hashoah, the day set aside to commemo
rate the death of six million Jews.
He said "remember" but he did not say
that it is easy.
"It is natural for human beings not to
remember. We have a need to not re
member things that were painful," he said.
But Wiesel remembered anyway, telling
the tale he said had to be told.
He "remembered" the Nazis and their
"psychological genius" by which they

created "illusion after illusion . . . and re
duced the Jewish ghetto to a passive com
munity ready to be killed."
He "remembered" the Warsaw Ghetto
and its 500,000 inhabitants, their courage
and their resistance to the Germans, their
youth and their strength.
He "remembered" the Jewish resistance
movement, for whom "no one in the world
cared and to whom not even a message of
encouragement was sent."
He "remembered" the Jewish under
ground, whose members defied the
"mightiest army of Europe" and prolonged
the siege of the Warsaw Ghetto longer than
even the French could defend their own
country.
At the time of the Holocaust, the "whole
world became mad," he said.
He asked why the Jews allowed them
selves to be deported to the concentration

camps without protest, and answered his
own question, "they did not know where
they were going."
He said the whole world had known
about the camps since 1942 — everyone
except the Jews who were isolated by the
Nazis in the ghettos.
"We listened to the radio every night, the
BBC and Russian radio and nobody cared to
warn us," he said.
"Nobody cared. People knew and didn't
care," he said.
Yet what he called the indifference to
these atrocities has caused him to question
more than just human actions.
"What about Cod?" he asked. "He knew,
why didn't he care? That has always been
my obsession."
He talked about the continuation of the
Nazi movement today. He told of Nazis
marching in St. Louis, Mo., and San Fran-

CISCO.
He cited 65 books in a dozen languages
which deny that the killing of the Jews ever
took place.
"In 1945 I would have burst out laugh
ing," he said, if someone would have
suggested any of these present situations.
Today, Wiesel does not laugh.
As for the survivors he said they are
"weary" and "close to despair.
"On the ruins of the world we had hopes,
in 1945, we had hopes." But Wiesel said,
"now there are dangers. It is a sick situation
and now we even have some sick people, so
morally perverted that they even deny that a
Holocaust ever took place."
Wiesel asks, "What will happen when the
last survivor is gone? Who knows what will
happen when our generation will be not
only without cemeteries, but without
memories?"
