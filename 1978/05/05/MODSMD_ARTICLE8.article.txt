# Letters: N-bomb, elections
## 
### 
Weapons equally immoral
I am appalled at Keith Jarett's sup
port of the neutron bomb (Daily,
Apr. 23).
Jarett first calls neutron bomb
opponents hypocrites for arguing
that the N-bomb is immoral. (The
N-bomb kills by radiation without
the extensive blast damage of ordi
nary nuclear weapons.) The N-bomb
is no more immoral than ordinary
nuclear weapons, he says.
Jarett missed the opponent's point
completely. With destructive forces
at this level, "relative" immorality
makes no sense. The weapons are
equally immoral; possession of one
can not by itself justify development
and deployment of the other.
However, Jarett's second argu
ment is more plausible, and so more
dangerous. He says,"The N-bomb
would enhance the credibilty of
NATO's defense," and that it "would
more effectively deter a Warsaw Pact
invasion of Western Europe."
The reason? He says that, in use,
N-bombs are more efficient. "Enemy
targets closer to civilians could be
eliminated without civilian losses."
Let's ignore for the moment
Jarett's Pentagon verbiage. (Why
military thinkers disguise the
realities of war with whitewashed
jargon like "eliminate enemy targets"
is beyond me.) The problem is in
Jarett's viewpoint that a more effi
cient killing device is necessarily a
"better" weapon.
Jarett argues that, in use, N-bombs
are better. But this is contrary to the
deterrence nature of U.S. and NATO
military doctrine. The whole idea is
to not use nuclear weapons, by scar
ing the other side into not using
theirs.
Even though "efficient" has a
normatively "good" implication (and
an efficient weapon is a contradic
tion in terms), I grant Jarett's conten
tion that the N-bomb is more effi
cient in use. But it is not a better
deterrent.
In fact, because it is useable in a
larger variety of situations, and be
cause it provides a lower-scale
response than is possible with
NATO's ordinary tactical nuclear
weapons, the N-bomb increases the
likelihood of nuclear weapon use in
Europe.
Strategic considerations are vitally
important, if we are to survive as a
species on this Earth for much
longer.
The last point I'll make against
Jarett's letter is that he made a dire
sin of omission. He ignored the most
important point about the whole
N-bomb debate. By refusing to de
velop the N-bomb, the U.S. has the
opportunity to take the first tentaive
steps toward breaking the vicious
U.S.-U.S.S.R. circle of developing
ever more destructive ("better")
weapons.
At some point in the weapons race
we must find a way to say "enough is
enough." Restraint in neutron bomb

development is an unprecedented
opportunity to say, symbolically, just
that. It is unfortunate that people like
Jarett do not see the broader impact
the N-bomb will have on arms con
trol efforts.

Good intentions not enough
All civilized humanity applauded
President Anwar Sadat's visit to
Jerusalem in November. I admire
Sadat for declaring that there can be
peace between Arabs and Jews, and
for stating that no longer would Arab
persistence in denying Israel's right
to exist be an obstacle to true peace.
But genuine peace, which Sadat
states he desires, can only come by
long hard negotiations. Yet Sadat
stated he did not go to Jerusalem "to
strike a bargain or reach a com
promise." How can peace evolve
when he denies the very essence of
the negotiating process?
Sadat's position seems to be "I
gave all that I can by going to
Jerusalem, now Israel must either ac
cept or deny peace on my terms." If
these were Sadat's intentions, he was
doomed to fail from the start. For
Israel cannot simply trade territory
for promises, especially when other
confrontation states, that is Syria,
denounce Sadat as a traitor to the
Arab world.
Issues which remain obstacles to
peace, such as security arrange
ments on the West Bank, can be sol
ved with negotiations. To Sadat I ask,
what is wrong with Begin's offer of
self-rule to the Palestinian Arabs?
Why does Sadat deny the Israelis the
right to a security presence on the
West Bank? It is surely needed to
protect human lives from the PLO
terrorists, from Soviet incursions and
from Arab hard liners, for example
Syria.
To Sadat I state only with negotia
tions can there be peace. Good in
tentions are not enough.

Abstentions have it!
In the midst of the confusion over
the recent fee assessment elections,
did anyone notice a strange effect of
the ASSU Constitution's provisions
requiring a 20 per cent voter turnout?
Given the present situation, a
"No" vote on a fee assessment helps
it pass; an abstention works toward
defeat far more surely than does a
negative vote.
This situation is clearly in violation
of fundamental principles of voting
(see, for example, Robert's Rules of
Order on abstentions): a voter who
seeks to defeat a proposal should, in

any reasonable system of rules, find a
"No" vote to be his most effective
choice.
Granted the need for some sort of
quorum provision in a fee assess
ment election, the desired effect
could be achieved by amending the
ASSU Constitution to require that fee
assessments pass by a simple major
ity. Majority must be at least N per
cent of the student body, and N
might be 10, 12, 15 or higher, de
pending on how comfortable one is
with the idea of a minority deciding
how everyone's money gets spent.
At least the fees are refundable!
The easiest way to make this point
clear would be for everyone who op
poses any of the eight fee assess
ments to be voted on this week (May
10 and 11) to abstain on those issues
rather than voting "no."
The resulting spectacle of an elec
tion losing on a 1500-to-zero vote
should spur the ASSU Senate into
formulating the necessary amend
ments in short order, thus restoring
some measure of sanity to a situation
in which it is sorely needed.

Weapons equally immoral
I am appalled at Keith Jarett's sup
port of the neutron bomb (Daily,
Apr. 23).
Jarett first calls neutron bomb
opponents hypocrites for arguing
that the N-bomb is immoral. (The
N-bomb kills by radiation without
the extensive blast damage of ordi
nary nuclear weapons.) The N-bomb
is no more immoral than ordinary
nuclear weapons, he says.
Jarett missed the opponent's point
completely. With destructive forces
at this level, "relative" immorality
makes no sense. The weapons are
equally immoral; possession of one
can not by itself justify development
and deployment of the other.
However, Jarett's second argu
ment is more plausible, and so more
dangerous. He says,"The N-bomb
would enhance the credibilty of
NATO's defense," and that it "would
more effectively deter a Warsaw Pact
invasion of Western Europe."
The reason? He says that, in use,
N-bombs are more efficient. "Enemy
targets closer to civilians could be
eliminated without civilian losses."
Let's ignore for the moment
Jarett's Pentagon verbiage. (Why
military thinkers disguise the
realities of war with whitewashed
jargon like "eliminate enemy targets"
is beyond me.) The problem is in
Jarett's viewpoint that a more effi
cient killing device is necessarily a
"better" weapon.
Jarett argues that, in use, N-bombs
are better. But this is contrary to the
deterrence nature of U.S. and NATO
military doctrine. The whole idea is
to not use nuclear weapons, by scar
ing the other side into not using
theirs.
Even though "efficient" has a
normatively "good" implication (and
an efficient weapon is a contradic
tion in terms), I grant Jarett's conten
tion that the N-bomb is more effi
cient in use. But it is not a better
deterrent.
In fact, because it is useable in a
larger variety of situations, and be
cause it provides a lower-scale
response than is possible with
NATO's ordinary tactical nuclear
weapons, the N-bomb increases the
likelihood of nuclear weapon use in
Europe.
Strategic considerations are vitally
important, if we are to survive as a
species on this Earth for much
longer.
The last point I'll make against
Jarett's letter is that he made a dire
sin of omission. He ignored the most
important point about the whole
N-bomb debate. By refusing to de
velop the N-bomb, the U.S. has the
opportunity to take the first tentaive
steps toward breaking the vicious
U.S.-U.S.S.R. circle of developing
ever more destructive ("better")
weapons.
At some point in the weapons race
we must find a way to say "enough is
enough." Restraint in neutron bomb

development is an unprecedented
opportunity to say, symbolically, just
that. It is unfortunate that people like
Jarett do not see the broader impact
the N-bomb will have on arms con
trol efforts.

Good intentions not enough
All civilized humanity applauded
President Anwar Sadat's visit to
Jerusalem in November. I admire
Sadat for declaring that there can be
peace between Arabs and Jews, and
for stating that no longer would Arab
persistence in denying Israel's right
to exist be an obstacle to true peace.
But genuine peace, which Sadat
states he desires, can only come by
long hard negotiations. Yet Sadat
stated he did not go to Jerusalem "to
strike a bargain or reach a com
promise." How can peace evolve
when he denies the very essence of
the negotiating process?
Sadat's position seems to be "I
gave all that I can by going to
Jerusalem, now Israel must either ac
cept or deny peace on my terms." If
these were Sadat's intentions, he was
doomed to fail from the start. For
Israel cannot simply trade territory
for promises, especially when other
confrontation states, that is Syria,
denounce Sadat as a traitor to the
Arab world.
Issues which remain obstacles to
peace, such as security arrange
ments on the West Bank, can be sol
ved with negotiations. To Sadat I ask,
what is wrong with Begin's offer of
self-rule to the Palestinian Arabs?
Why does Sadat deny the Israelis the
right to a security presence on the
West Bank? It is surely needed to
protect human lives from the PLO
terrorists, from Soviet incursions and
from Arab hard liners, for example
Syria.
To Sadat I state only with negotia
tions can there be peace. Good in
tentions are not enough.

Abstentions have it!
In the midst of the confusion over
the recent fee assessment elections,
did anyone notice a strange effect of
the ASSU Constitution's provisions
requiring a 20 per cent voter turnout?
Given the present situation, a
"No" vote on a fee assessment helps
it pass; an abstention works toward
defeat far more surely than does a
negative vote.
This situation is clearly in violation
of fundamental principles of voting
(see, for example, Robert's Rules of
Order on abstentions): a voter who
seeks to defeat a proposal should, in

any reasonable system of rules, find a
"No" vote to be his most effective
choice.
Granted the need for some sort of
quorum provision in a fee assess
ment election, the desired effect
could be achieved by amending the
ASSU Constitution to require that fee
assessments pass by a simple major
ity. Majority must be at least N per
cent of the student body, and N
might be 10, 12, 15 or higher, de
pending on how comfortable one is
with the idea of a minority deciding
how everyone's money gets spent.
At least the fees are refundable!
The easiest way to make this point
clear would be for everyone who op
poses any of the eight fee assess
ments to be voted on this week (May
10 and 11) to abstain on those issues
rather than voting "no."
The resulting spectacle of an elec
tion losing on a 1500-to-zero vote
should spur the ASSU Senate into
formulating the necessary amend
ments in short order, thus restoring
some measure of sanity to a situation
in which it is sorely needed.
