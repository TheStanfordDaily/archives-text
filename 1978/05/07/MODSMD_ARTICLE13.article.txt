# Tennis family affair for champ
## 
### Chris Haft 
When young athletes dream,
they do so in a grandiose fash
ion. Little Leaguers think of
playing in the World Series and
Pop Warner footballers im
agine themselves in the Super
Bowl.
Youthful tennis players
doubtlessly fantasize about
winning National Junior
championships, competing in
the NCAA's and ultimately
playing at Wimbledon.
These dreams remain unful
filled for most people, but
junior Susie Hagey, who is still
quite youthful herself, has ac
tually experienced almost all of
the highlights that only the
most gifted tennis players en
joy.
One might think that Hagey,
after doing so many things in
such a short amount of time,
would be restless and search
ing for bigger thrills.
Indeed, what challenges are
left in amateur tennis after
winning two straight intercol
legiate doubles titles and mak
ing the All-America team both
freshman and sophomore
years, as Hagey has?
However, Hagey is happy at
Stanford and on the women's
tennis team. Unlike some of
the men's team stars who are
turning professional before
graduating, she is comfortable
staying down on the Farm.
Tennis is obviously some
thing else Hagey is comforta
ble with. Now No. 55 in U.S.
Women's rankings, she's
played the sport since she was
seven years old, and though
she participated in five other
sports in high school (basket
ball, volleyball, field hockey,
Softball and soccer), she af
firms, "Tennis was always the
special one."
Hagey, the sixth of eight child
ren, shares the tennis fever
with the rest of her family. Her
father, Robert, is a top-ranked
senior. Brother Chico, cur
rently a touring pro, was a Stan

ford Ail-American in 1974 and
brother Ted plays on the San
Diego State team. Brother Rob
played for Cal in '74-'75, sister
Cari recently won the National
Girls 12 Indoor Doubles, and
sister Bess played for USC from
'73-74.
"My whole family is pro
athletic," Hagey understates.
"Athletics were part of the day
when I grew up, and that
helped me as a tennis player."
When discussing Hagey's
game, her destructive
forehand immediately comes
to mind. "It is my outstanding
shot," she agrees.
"I use more wrist in it, and I
have a slightly western grip. I
can hit it harder than girls, and
even harder than most guys."
As is typical of many fine
athletes, Hagey acquired her
major weapon naturally. "No
body ever really taught the
forehand to me. I just started
using it when I was a kid, and
I've had confidence in it since
then."
"Besides her forehand,
Hagey also has an outstanding
net game which gives her some
variety," adds women's coach
Anne Gould. "It allows her to
stay back or come in."
The No. 1 singles player last
year, Hagey has dropped to
No. 4 this year. This does not
represent a decline in her
abilities. Rather, it reflects the
abundant talent on the wo
men's squad.
"With our team this year, the
top four players are so close (in
ability) that when you lose one
challenge match, you drop
down," explains doubles part
ner Diane Morrison. "Susie's
game hasn't gone down, it's
just that we have a lot of good
tennis players."
Hagey has had many excep
tional moments in tennis, but
her appearances at Wimble
don are among the most excit
ing. In 1974 at age 16 she made
the mixed doubles quarterfi
nals, and played on Wimble

don's hallowed center court. "I
was so nervous I couldn'ttalk,"
Hagey recalls.
Hagey was also a Junior
Wimbledon quarterfinalist in
1975, and after missing the
tournament in 1976 (she was at
the NCAA's), she qualified for
the singles last year, flying to
England immediately after the
1977 NCAA's.
"That was definitely a
dream," Hagey says of her
singles berth. "To be among
the top tennis players in the
world that's an honor in it
self."
Yet Hagey is not preoc
cupied with titles and high
rankings. She plays tennis to
have fun. She feels no pressure
about repeating as doubles
champ or an Ail-American:
"Nobody even worries about
honors like those. If they
come, that's great.
"Like all coaches tell you,
you have to play them one at a
time," she goes on. "You can't
just shoot for the finals right
away."
It follows that Hagey, a vete
ran of diverse tennis adven
tures, is a leader on the Stan
ford team. "She's been
around," says Gould, "and the
girls certainly admire and re
spect her."
"Because I've played tennis
forever, I've traveled a lot I
played on the pro circuit last
quarter," Hagey explains. "I
have a lot of experience, so I
know what I'm talking about
on and off the court, like in de
aling with the press and with
traveling."
Hagey, an art major going to
Florence next fall on the over
seas program, has every inten
tion of finishing school and
graduating. After graduation,
she expects to turn pro, and
maybe play World Team Ten
nis.
"There's no reason to stay
amateur," she says. "It would
be fun to make money playing,
though I don't plan to be
Number One."
No, being No. 1 isn't the im
portant thing in tennis for
Susie Hagey. It's the fun that
counts, which is the way it
should be.

Tennis is obviously some
thing else Hagey is comforta
ble with. Now No. 55 in U.S.
Women's rankings, she's
played the sport since she was
seven years old, and though
she participated in five other
sports in high school (basket
ball, volleyball, field hockey,
Softball and soccer), she af
firms, "Tennis was always the
special one."
Hagey, the sixth of eight child
ren, shares the tennis fever
with the rest of her family. Her
father, Robert, is a top-ranked
senior. Brother Chico, cur
rently a touring pro, was a Stan

ford Ail-American in 1974 and
brother Ted plays on the San
Diego State team. Brother Rob
played for Cal in '74-'75, sister
Cari recently won the National
Girls 12 Indoor Doubles, and
sister Bess played for USC from
'73-74.
"My whole family is pro
athletic," Hagey understates.
"Athletics were part of the day
when I grew up, and that
helped me as a tennis player."
When discussing Hagey's
game, her destructive
forehand immediately comes
to mind. "It is my outstanding
shot," she agrees.
"I use more wrist in it, and I
have a slightly western grip. I
can hit it harder than girls, and
even harder than most guys."
As is typical of many fine
athletes, Hagey acquired her
major weapon naturally. "No
body ever really taught the
forehand to me. I just started
using it when I was a kid, and
I've had confidence in it since
then."
"Besides her forehand,
Hagey also has an outstanding
net game which gives her some
variety," adds women's coach
Anne Gould. "It allows her to
stay back or come in."
The No. 1 singles player last
year, Hagey has dropped to
No. 4 this year. This does not
represent a decline in her
abilities. Rather, it reflects the
abundant talent on the wo
men's squad.
"With our team this year, the
top four players are so close (in
ability) that when you lose one
challenge match, you drop
down," explains doubles part
ner Diane Morrison. "Susie's
game hasn't gone down, it's
just that we have a lot of good
tennis players."
Hagey has had many excep
tional moments in tennis, but
her appearances at Wimble
don are among the most excit
ing. In 1974 at age 16 she made
the mixed doubles quarterfi
nals, and played on Wimble

don's hallowed center court. "I
was so nervous I couldn'ttalk,"
Hagey recalls.
Hagey was also a Junior
Wimbledon quarterfinalist in
1975, and after missing the
tournament in 1976 (she was at
the NCAA's), she qualified for
the singles last year, flying to
England immediately after the
1977 NCAA's.
"That was definitely a
dream," Hagey says of her
singles berth. "To be among
the top tennis players in the
world that's an honor in it
self."
Yet Hagey is not preoc
cupied with titles and high
rankings. She plays tennis to
have fun. She feels no pressure
about repeating as doubles
champ or an Ail-American:
"Nobody even worries about
honors like those. If they
come, that's great.
"Like all coaches tell you,
you have to play them one at a
time," she goes on. "You can't
just shoot for the finals right
away."
It follows that Hagey, a vete
ran of diverse tennis adven
tures, is a leader on the Stan
ford team. "She's been
around," says Gould, "and the
girls certainly admire and re
spect her."
"Because I've played tennis
forever, I've traveled a lot I
played on the pro circuit last
quarter," Hagey explains. "I
have a lot of experience, so I
know what I'm talking about
on and off the court, like in de
aling with the press and with
traveling."
Hagey, an art major going to
Florence next fall on the over
seas program, has every inten
tion of finishing school and
graduating. After graduation,
she expects to turn pro, and
maybe play World Team Ten
nis.
"There's no reason to stay
amateur," she says. "It would
be fun to make money playing,
though I don't plan to be
Number One."
No, being No. 1 isn't the im
portant thing in tennis for
Susie Hagey. It's the fun that
counts, which is the way it
should be.

When young athletes dream,
they do so in a grandiose fash
ion. Little Leaguers think of
playing in the World Series and
Pop Warner footballers im
agine themselves in the Super
Bowl.
Youthful tennis players
doubtlessly fantasize about
winning National Junior
championships, competing in
the NCAA's and ultimately
playing at Wimbledon.
These dreams remain unful
filled for most people, but
junior Susie Hagey, who is still
quite youthful herself, has ac
tually experienced almost all of
the highlights that only the
most gifted tennis players en
joy.
One might think that Hagey,
after doing so many things in
such a short amount of time,
would be restless and search
ing for bigger thrills.
Indeed, what challenges are
left in amateur tennis after
winning two straight intercol
legiate doubles titles and mak
ing the All-America team both
freshman and sophomore
years, as Hagey has?
However, Hagey is happy at
Stanford and on the women's
tennis team. Unlike some of
the men's team stars who are
turning professional before
graduating, she is comfortable
staying down on the Farm.
