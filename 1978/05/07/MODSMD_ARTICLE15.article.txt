## Attitude â€“ Mitchell's key to success 
### Yvonne Randle 
"11 NC2A," reads the license
plate of Matt Mitchell, defend
ing NCAA tennis champion.
"It's justa reminderto me that I
won," he said.
And win, he did. But what is
the secret of winning as he
does, under pressure? Accord
ing to Mitchell, it consists of
"maintaining a fairly constant
attitude: not getting too high
when you win, nor too low
when you lose. Realize that it's
important, but relax."

According to coach Dick
Gould, this is the attitude that
Mitchell displays on the courts.
"Matt is mentally prepared and
looks at the match realisti
cally," said Gould. "A particu
lar match is not important. It's
more the overall perspective."
The junior from Palo Alto
began playing tennis at the age
of seven. His parents enrolled
him, along with his three
brothers and sisters, in sum
mer group lessons. From these
first 20 lessons emerged not

only the future college champ
ion, hut a brother, Mark, who
was a 1976 Stanford Ail-
American.
Coming to Stanford after a
successful high school career
may be tough for some. But
Mitchell said that the transition
to college tennis was not a dif
ficult one for him because he
had previously played with
most of the team's members
and because he was "used to
playing up." He continued,
"You must move from
echelon to echelon from
high school to college, to pros.
If you don't; you're in trou
ble."

During his stay at Stanford,
Mitchell has been a successful
singles, as well as doubles,
player. Last year, he not only
took the national amateur sing
les championship, but along
with his partner Perry Wright,
claimed the doubles champ
ionship as well.
Of doubles play, Mitchell
said, "There's not much time
to psych up. Doubles is a rela
xation period. It's quick, fun
and exciting."
Success
Mitchell said that he attri
butes much of his success as a
player to a belief in himself.
After returning to Stanford
from a summer on the North
west circuit in 1976, Mitchell
said this belief had increased.
"I knew that I could play the
big points the way I wanted
without being as emotionally
involved as when I was a
freshman," Mitchell said.
"Matt has perspective," ag
reed Gould.
Upon returning to school
this year, Mitchell found him
self no longer at the top. Being
the No. 3 player after

winning the NCAA champion
ship last year could have been
quite a letdown. But Mitchell
said, "It's a fair and just posi
tion. It doesn't matter what
position I play as long as I go
out to win for myself and then
for the team."

Going out to win usually in
volves a certain amount of
"psyching up" for the match.
Mitchell's way of preparing for
a match consists of listening to
music. "Music is a means of
easing inner tensions," he
said.

As in all spectator sports,
fans continually cheer on their
favorites on the court. In
Mitchell's case, however,
there is one cheer that bothers
him "Let's go, Matt." Mitch
ell said, "When I'm out there,
I'm out there to win, and it's
like they're patting me on the
back. When I'm going through
a match and after two and a half
sets someone yells, 'Let's go,
Matt,' it's like I haven't been
out there for those first two
sets."
Perhaps his biggest fan is his
father, who attends all of his
matches. Mitchell said that his
father is "great" and doesn't
put a lot of pressure on him to
win. "While his central focus is
on me, he wants Stanford ten
nis to do well," he said.
According to Gould, Mitch
ell displays this same attitude.
"Matt has a concern for the
team's welfare and progress
which sometimes gets lost in
what individuals do for the
team."
Looking ahead
Mitchell also has a strong be
lief in living for the present.
"Once you start delving in the
past, you can't look at yourself
objectively," he said. So,

where does he plan to go from
here?
"Matt has the physical talent
to be a pro," Could said, "but it
all depends on his goal."
As far as Mitchell is con
cerned, he would like to play
the Grand Prix circuit, even
though he doesn't like clay. He
played this circuit last year and
was not too successful. "Last
summer was a big shock,"
Mitchell said. "I wasn't used to
losing in the first and second
rounds." He thought that his
game had been improved by
the play, however.
The move to professional
tennis will probably not take
place until after his graduation.
Mitchell said, "College is fun,
so I might as well relax and
grow. I wouldn't have the op
portunity if I turned pro now."
As the NCAA championships
draw near, the defending
champion has his reminders
from last year's tournament,
his success from this year, and
his goals to focus on for the
future.

Mitchell's powerful returns helped him capture the 1977 NCAA
Championship. Against the Gaters they may be the moves he needs to
beat a World Team Tennis pro.
