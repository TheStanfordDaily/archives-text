# Sports companies trade gear for advertising

Stanford's Kathy Jordan
wears Nike tennis shoes, Bill
Maze wears Tred 11, and John
McEnroe wears whatever he
wants. The shoes and clothes
many college players display,
and the tennis rackets they
swing are, for the most part,
given to them indirectly by
sporting goods companies for
promotional reasons.
The players you see before
you on both teams are not only
playing tennis, but also adver
tising this equipment. That
doesn't mean they are promot
ing what they wear, though
they do use it without
charge in most cases and it is
seen by many admiring fans.
How do tennis players go
about obtaining this free
promotional tennis equipment
and clothing? Simple. By either
being on one of the top college
tennis teams in the United
States, or by being a nationally

As Stanford Tennis Coach
Dick Gould noted, "When
you're a number one team you
get a lot more attention from
sporting good distributors."
While the best teams in the
country may receive "free"
promotional equipment di
rectly, the top individual
players may not. Two years ago
they could have, butinl976the
NCAA passed a special ruling.
It is not permissible for a
student athlete to accept athle
tic equipment from a manufac
turer without jeopardizing the
student athlete's eligibility
under the NCAA professional
ruling.
The reason for this ruling is
that receiving free equipment
would be a benefit not availa
ble to the student body in gen
eral.
However, sports equipment
and clothing can be given to
the student athlete's college if
it is made available to be used
h" tho Â»/hol Q foam In mnd

cases the particular coach de
termines who on the team will
receive the equipment.
The NCAA also states that
the equipment issued should
be retrieved at the end of the
year. This is usually impossible
because the equipment is
worn beyond use.
Though the ruling may be
awkward for some, it does not
prevent the best players from
getting promotional gear. "The
NCAA ruling has never af
fected me, and to tell you the
truth I don't even think about
it," said John McEnroe. "I
don't lose sleep over not being
abletogetequipment. If I need
some equipment, 1 get it. I've
been getting free equipment
since I was 12 years old."
The difference now is that
McEnroe is in college.
An athlete can be in college
and receive promotional
equipment directly only if he is
not affiliated with the NCAA.
Althrt, ifih

team belongs to the AIAW
many companies treat the
women players the same as the
men.
"We don't want to get into
any trouble with our college
contacts so we use the same
policy for the men and the
women," said a Wilson rep
resentative.
In many ways the NCAA rul
ing seems ludicrous, but as
Stanford's Peter Rennert
pointed out "personally I don't
think it is very fair, but people
should obey the NCAA rules
unless they want to lose their
college eligibility."
How do the sporting goods
companies feel about the rul
ing? According to Adidas rep
resentatives, "We trust the col
leges and the NCAA, and feel
that they trust and respect us."
Once the players receive
equipment they are under no
obligation to wear or use it. As
one company revealed
th"" gh a nlai/gr

some promotional equipment
and that person wears another
brand, we will usually not-give
them any more equipment for
that particular year. We submit
the merchandise to them so
that they will wear it, and that
equipment will, in turn, be
seen by other people. It is
purely promotional. They do
us a favor and we do them a
favor."
Is there any limit to how
much equipment these, com
panies may give colleges? "If
there is a limit we have not hit it
yet," said Adidas sources. "We
are fairly careful in what we al
locate to the teams, but we've
never had a problem with giv
ing them too much."
Many people wonder if all
this free promotional equip
ment actually benefits the
companies.
Stop wondering it does.

Jordan wears or uses a com-
