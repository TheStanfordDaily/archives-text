When Stanford All-America
Diane Morrison first came to
Stanford it was with little
thought of playing tennis. In
fact, Morrison was never re
cruited by the Stanford tennis
team, even though she was
one of the best women junior
players in the United States.
Morrison was a product of
Beverly Hills High School in
Los Angeles where she was in
vited to play for the men's ten
nis squad. She promptly began
to beat most of the men on the
team, and established herself
as one of the best junior wo
men's players in Los Angeles.
How did it feel to play on a
men's team in high school?
"When I played against men in

high school and beat them,
people would just look at me
and raise their eyebrows," said
Morrison. "I was never afraid
of playing men. After all, they
had a lot more to lose than I
did, and the whole experience
only tended to build me up."
Morrison did not begin her
tennis career playing men,
though. "I started tennis as
something to do for fun," said
Morrison. "I first began play
ing on the city recreation
courts in Los Angeles when I
was a young kid. My sisters
were taking a lot of lessons at
the time, and so I thought I
should also."
By junior high school Morri
son had won a good share of
major tournaments and be

come one of the best women's
junior players in the United
States. Aside from this, she had
skipped a grade or two in
school, joined the West Side
racket club, and acquired a full
time coach.
Even so, Morrison had not
become completely serious
about tennis. It was not until
she was 16, and a teammate of
Stanford's Perry Wright at Be
verly Hills High, that the "turn
ing point" came.
Not recruited
At 16 Morrison had finished
high school and was accepted
to Stanford on an academic
scholarship. "I came- to Stan
ford primarily for the
academics, though I had some
hope of playing tennis," said
Morrison.
Although Morrison was not
recruited by Stanford she suc
ceeded in making the team as a
walk-on. According to coach
Anne Could, "Getting a player
the way we got Diane will not
continue. Good players don't
just walk in like that anymore.
They are heavily recruited."
The credentials this walk-on
has amassed in the last few
years are astounding. She has
been All-America, and the
AIAW doubles champion with
Susie Hagey the last two years.
She was one of the top four
college women's singles
players in the United States last
year, and a member of the

junior Wightman and Federa
tion Cup teams.
In 1977 Morrison was ranked
the 64th best women's player
by the United States Tennis As
sociation and was co-MVP of
the Stanford Women's team.
With good justification,
Morrison is planning on turn
ing professional after she
graduates.
"Itwon'tbeaneasy life. I will
be practicing twice as long
each day, and playing twice the
number of matches I am now,"
said Morrison. "But I think
that's how professionals differ
from amateurs; they play more

matches and are more mature
on the court."
According to coach Gould
"Diane is one of the mainstays
of this team. She could be
come an excellent professional
player. She has a net game that
is better than any player I have
ever seen. She plays with a
quiet intensity."
Whether it's tennis or
academics, the direction Diane
Morrison is taking now is
straight up. Morrison is truly a
remarkable find not only for
the Stanford Tennis Team but
for tennis in general.

Diane Morrison readies for a return. Her ability has propelled her
from a member of the men's team at Beverly Hills High to a collegiate
contender for national titles.
When Stanford All-America
Diane Morrison first came to
Stanford it was with little
thought of playing tennis. In
fact, Morrison was never re
cruited by the Stanford tennis
team, even though she was
one of the best women junior
players in the United States.
Morrison was a product of
Beverly Hills High School in
Los Angeles where she was in
vited to play for the men's ten
nis squad. She promptly began
to beat most of the men on the
team, and established herself
as one of the best junior wo
men's players in Los Angeles.
How did it feel to play on a
men's team in high school?
"When I played against men in

high school and beat them,
people would just look at me
and raise their eyebrows," said
Morrison. "I was never afraid
of playing men. After all, they
had a lot more to lose than I
did, and the whole experience
only tended to build me up."
Morrison did not begin her
tennis career playing men,
though. "I started tennis as
something to do for fun," said
Morrison. "I first began play
ing on the city recreation
courts in Los Angeles when I
was a young kid. My sisters
were taking a lot of lessons at
the time, and so I thought I
should also."
By junior high school Morri
son had won a good share of
major tournaments and be

come one of the best women's
junior players in the United
States. Aside from this, she had
skipped a grade or two in
school, joined the West Side
racket club, and acquired a full
time coach.
Even so, Morrison had not
become completely serious
about tennis. It was not until
she was 16, and a teammate of
Stanford's Perry Wright at Be
verly Hills High, that the "turn
ing point" came.
Not recruited
At 16 Morrison had finished
high school and was accepted
to Stanford on an academic
scholarship. "I came- to Stan
ford primarily for the
academics, though I had some
hope of playing tennis," said
Morrison.
Although Morrison was not
recruited by Stanford she suc
ceeded in making the team as a
walk-on. According to coach
Anne Could, "Getting a player
the way we got Diane will not
continue. Good players don't
just walk in like that anymore.
They are heavily recruited."
The credentials this walk-on
has amassed in the last few
years are astounding. She has
been All-America, and the
AIAW doubles champion with
Susie Hagey the last two years.
She was one of the top four
college women's singles
players in the United States last
year, and a member of the

junior Wightman and Federa
tion Cup teams.
In 1977 Morrison was ranked
the 64th best women's player
by the United States Tennis As
sociation and was co-MVP of
the Stanford Women's team.
With good justification,
Morrison is planning on turn
ing professional after she
graduates.
"Itwon'tbeaneasy life. I will
be practicing twice as long
each day, and playing twice the
number of matches I am now,"
said Morrison. "But I think
that's how professionals differ
from amateurs; they play more

matches and are more mature
on the court."
According to coach Gould
"Diane is one of the mainstays
of this team. She could be
come an excellent professional
player. She has a net game that
is better than any player I have
ever seen. She plays with a
quiet intensity."
Whether it's tennis or
academics, the direction Diane
Morrison is taking now is
straight up. Morrison is truly a
remarkable find not only for
the Stanford Tennis Team but
for tennis in general.
