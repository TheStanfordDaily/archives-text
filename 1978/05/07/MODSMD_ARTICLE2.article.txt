A few weeks ago, the Uni
versity of Santa Clara played
the San Francisco Giants in an
exhibition baseball game. But
somebody forgot to tell the
Broncos about the proper
amount of awe to exhibit, and
when to crumble in the face of
the professional athletes'
superior talent.
In other words, Santa Clara
won.
Golden Gaters' player-coach
Frew McMillan would like to
forget about what happened to
the Giants. He has plenty to
worry about in anticipation of
tonight's third annual exhibi
tion match between World
Team tennis' Golden Gaters
and the Stanford men's and

women's tennis teams.
"It makes me so nervous that
I don't want to think about it,"
said McMillan about tonight's
match. McMillan's concern is
understandable, because the
Gaters will face the number
one men's and number two
women's college teams in the
nation. But Gould is worried
that people will remember
Santa Clara and every other
upstart college athletic team
that has won an exhibition with
a professional team.
"Frew is a real gentle
man ... he is tennis' finest
representative," Gould said. "I
know he doesn't want to let
this get out of hand.
"We're not trying to prove
anything . . . seriously, we're

not. We're not saying 'Hey, we
want to beat the Gaters.' We
just want to play some good,
solid tennis and get some ex
perience playing world-class
players.
"We're definitely not out to
prove anything . . . that's the
light we want everybody to see
the match in."
And there will be plenty of
tennis to see, even if it isn't for
the NCAA or the WTT champ
ionship.
"The Gaters will have played
four matches this week,"
Gould said. "They have a tough
schedule and a long season,
and it's tough to come over
here and play us. And it's not
like they won't qualify for their
championshships if they lose

to us.
"I don't want to build it up
too much but I don't want to
downplay it, either. We're ex
cited about it."
The Caters will have to, be
cause the Stanford team that is
scheduled to play tonight
could probably form their own
WTT franchise. Each of the
men and women have com
peted against professional
players in various tournaments
across the country, and all are
nationally ranked among col
legians.
"We'd be able to play some
WTT teams on equal terms with
some regularity," said Gould.
"We're going to try and stay
close and win at least a few
games.
"We expect some solid,
even matches. There's a possi
bility we could win, but there's
always a possibility on paper."
Anything is possible with
John McEnroe. The Wimble
don semi-finalist and
20th-ranked player in the
world will probably play men's
singles for Stanford. His prob
able opponent, ironically, is
1973 NCAA singles champion
and former Stanford standout,
Sandy Mayer. Gould calls the
matchup a "natural draw," but
adds that tennis fans will prob
ably remember McEnroe's
upset victory over Mayer at
Wimbledon last year more
than Mayer will.
"Sandy will definitely not be
out for revenge," said Gould.
"I hope people won't turn it
into that, because it will be a
bona fide match."
Defending NCAA singles
champion Matt Mitchell and

Stanford's number four player
Perry Wright are scheduled to
team up in men's doubles
against Frew McMillan and
Mayer. McMillan is considered
the world's premier doubles
player.
Bill Maze, the 1977 Pacific-8
champion, and Barbara Jordan,
No. 2 on the Stanford
women's team, are slated to
take on McMillan and 1977
Wimbledon singles champion
Virginia Wade.
In women's doubles, Gaters
Marise Kruger and liana Kloss
are scheduled to challenge
Diane Morrison and Susie
Hagey, the Cards' number one
women's doubles team.
Women's singles will feature
Wade against Kathy Jordan, the
No. 1 ranked Stanford
woman.
Wade is recovering from a
"superficial" injury in her right
calf, but will play women's
singles, according to Gater
publicist Chuck Bennett.
''She'll definitely play sing
les," he said. "People want to
see Virginia play singles."
And Virginia wants to play
singles.
"It will be fun to play at
Stanford," she said. "I'm look
ing forward to it."
That's the way Stanford wo
men's coach Ann Gould is
looking at tonight's match also.
"It's something fun," she
said. "It's not like a dual
(league) match, where there's
a lot of pressure. You just go
out and play well."
