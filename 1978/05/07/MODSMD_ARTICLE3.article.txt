# WTT struggle finished, healthy growth continues

When the announcment of the in
ception of World Team Tennis came
about in May 1973, the sports experts
howled. Team tennis? How could ten
nis, an individual sport, possibly be
come a team game?
Through efficient management, un
ique scoring rules, and the signing of
top professional stars, World Team
Tennis has become a permanent fixture
on the professional sports scene.
Now in its fifth year of play, World
Team Tennis enjoys a prosperity that at
one time it did not have. The first 18
months of league existence included 16
teams, three league presidents, and
problems concerning audience partici
pation (league officials did not know
whether to invite or subdue the
crowds' yelling and cheering).
With the appointment of Larry King
as league president in November 1974,
these problems began to be turned
around. The number of teams was re
duced from 16 to 10, thereby cutting
out the dead weight that had plagued
the initial season. The 1975 season was
marked by the unveiling of the WTT's
patented four-color, no-line court
along with a 28 per cent increase in at
tendance.
After the 1976 season, a season in
which attendance continued to spiral,
Butch Buchholz was named Commis

sioner, replacing King as head of the
league. Under Buchholz's leadership,
the WTT truly became a "world"
league. With the inclusion of "The
Soviets" in 1977, the WTT became the
first league to stretch across two conti
nents.

1977 was also the first year in which
the WTT had the number one male and
female players in the world in its fold.
With the signings of Bjom Borg and
Chris Evert, the WTT answered its cri
tics who claimed that its play was not of
championship quality.
This season the WTT has all of the top
10 women on its rosters and three of the
top 10 men, including Golden Gater
Sandy Mayer.

The benefits of playing WTT are var
ied depending on the player's wants.
"It's guaranteed money for 13
weeks," said Chuck Bennett, Golden
Gater Public Relations Director. "They
don't have to travel every week from
town to town, maybe losing in the first
round.
"They have a home base for three
months. They play 22 matches on the
road, but they play and then they come
home."
Bennett added the fact that playing
for a team actually adds something to
the player's game.
"liana Kloss said that on the tour
she's just another player. But here, she

comes home before a crowd that she
knows will cheerforher," Bennett said.
One only need look at this season's
league statistics to see that the WTT can
add years to a player's career.
"Rod Laver leads the league in wins
this season," Bennett said. "Laver
doesn't need the week in, week out
concept of tournament tennis. For one
thing, he has nothing to prove. He's
done it all. For another thing, he's too
old. All he does is play one or two sets a
week, which he is obviously capable of
doing."
The scheduling of league play during
the summer months has proven to be a
big success.

"There are competing circuits in
other parts of the. year," said Bennett.
In previous seasons most players spent
the summer in Europe. Bennet noted that
"there is a four week break for Wimb
ledon. Our regular season ends in Au
gust, and after a two week break for the
U.S. Open, we complete our playoffs."
One group of people made espe
cially happy by the fact that the league
plays during the summer is the arena
owners. "In previous summers, most of
the arenas were empty. Basketball and
hockey take up six months of the year,
and now we are here to take the sum
mer months," Bennett said.
In this, the third year of the
Stanford-Gaters series, all parties in

volved realize that it is a success.
"The Stanford players get a chance to
play the pros, and the Gaters are ex
posed to some different players for a
change," said Bennett.
Bennett had nothing but praise for
the Stanford organization, noting that
the Gaters are appreciative. "Dick
Gould perenially puts together a good
team, the best in the Bay Area," noted
Bennett.
World Team Tennis is unique in that
it survived a sports depression that saw
several professional leagues fall by the
wayside. With leadership such as it has
today, tennis fans can be assured that it
will be around for a long time.

In previous seasons most players spent
the summer in Europe. Bennet noted that
"there is a four week break for Wimb
ledon. Our regular season ends in Au
gust, and after a two week break for the
U.S. Open, we complete our playoffs."
One group of people made espe
cially happy by the fact that the league
plays during the summer is the arena
owners. "In previous summers, most of
the arenas were empty. Basketball and
hockey take up six months of the year,
and now we are here to take the sum
mer months," Bennett said.
In this, the third year of the
Stanford-Gaters series, all parties in

volved realize that it is a success.
"The Stanford players get a chance to
play the pros, and the Gaters are ex
posed to some different players for a
change," said Bennett.
Bennett had nothing but praise for
the Stanford organization, noting that
the Gaters are appreciative. "Dick
Gould perenially puts together a good
team, the best in the Bay Area," noted
Bennett.
World Team Tennis is unique in that
it survived a sports depression that saw
several professional leagues fall by the
wayside. With leadership such as it has
today, tennis fans can be assured that it
will be around for a long time.
When the announcment of the in
ception of World Team Tennis came
about in May 1973, the sports experts
howled. Team tennis? How could ten
nis, an individual sport, possibly be
come a team game?
Through efficient management, un
ique scoring rules, and the signing of
top professional stars, World Team
Tennis has become a permanent fixture
on the professional sports scene.
Now in its fifth year of play, World
Team Tennis enjoys a prosperity that at
one time it did not have. The first 18
months of league existence included 16
teams, three league presidents, and
problems concerning audience partici
pation (league officials did not know
whether to invite or subdue the
crowds' yelling and cheering).
With the appointment of Larry King
as league president in November 1974,
these problems began to be turned
around. The number of teams was re
duced from 16 to 10, thereby cutting
out the dead weight that had plagued
the initial season. The 1975 season was
marked by the unveiling of the WTT's
patented four-color, no-line court
along with a 28 per cent increase in at
tendance.
After the 1976 season, a season in
which attendance continued to spiral,
Butch Buchholz was named Commis

sioner, replacing King as head of the
league. Under Buchholz's leadership,
the WTT truly became a "world"
league. With the inclusion of "The
Soviets" in 1977, the WTT became the
first league to stretch across two conti
nents.

1977 was also the first year in which
the WTT had the number one male and
female players in the world in its fold.
With the signings of Bjom Borg and
Chris Evert, the WTT answered its cri
tics who claimed that its play was not of
championship quality.
This season the WTT has all of the top
10 women on its rosters and three of the
top 10 men, including Golden Gater
Sandy Mayer.

The benefits of playing WTT are var
ied depending on the player's wants.
"It's guaranteed money for 13
weeks," said Chuck Bennett, Golden
Gater Public Relations Director. "They
don't have to travel every week from
town to town, maybe losing in the first
round.
"They have a home base for three
months. They play 22 matches on the
road, but they play and then they come
home."
Bennett added the fact that playing
for a team actually adds something to
the player's game.
"liana Kloss said that on the tour
she's just another player. But here, she

comes home before a crowd that she
knows will cheerforher," Bennett said.
One only need look at this season's
league statistics to see that the WTT can
add years to a player's career.
"Rod Laver leads the league in wins
this season," Bennett said. "Laver
doesn't need the week in, week out
concept of tournament tennis. For one
thing, he has nothing to prove. He's
done it all. For another thing, he's too
old. All he does is play one or two sets a
week, which he is obviously capable of
doing."
The scheduling of league play during
the summer months has proven to be a
big success.

"There are competing circuits in
other parts of the. year," said Bennett.
