# No change in trustee position
##

Despite fourteen months of edu
cation, debate, and demonstrations,
the Stanford Trustees have not sub
stantially changed their position on
South Africa.
While other groups, such as the
YWCA, the Daily, and CIR have
analyzed the issue and come to a pos
ition that basically calls for corporate
withdrawal, the trustees have stuck
to their basic argument that U.S.
corporations can act as a progressive
force in South Africa. Why is this?
The trustees have yet to give a
reasoned defense of their premises.
True, they do give arguments to sup
port the specific application of their
premises: Texaco is progressive so
we can't vote for its withdrawal, or
Phelps-Dodge is not progressive in
their employment practices so we
feel they should leave South Africa.
But what is the context of these prog
ressive or non-progressive employ
ment practices?
Black South Africans, such as
Peter Hendricksen who spoke here
recently, argue that they are not in
terested in the elimination of segre
gated toilets and in small wage in
creases for the black workers that the
U.S. corporations employ.
What Peter and every legitimate
black group in South Africa have cal
led for is that foreign corporations
leave South Africa because they
serve to strengthen the apartheid
system and the South African re
gime.
Caltex, jointly owned by Texaco
and Standard Oil, whose president is
Trustee John Grey is a perfect exam
ple. Trustee President Peter Bing

cites Texaco's payment of wages
slightly above subsistence level, and
their movement of a handful of black
employees into sales positions as
reason for not accepting the unani
mous recommendation of the CIR
that Stanford vote its Texaco shares
for withdrawl.
Caltex has less than a thousand
black employees anyway. Yet, being
a key strategic industry they are vital
to the South African system. A high
South African government official
pointed out, "dependence on im
ported fuel is one of South Africa's
most vulnerable points."
And as Mobil Oil admitted, "Oil
supplies are the very lifeblood of the
army, navy and air force." (Stanford's
trustees voted against a proxy resolu
tion to cut Mobil's imports of oil to
South Africa by on«v-third.)
The reliance of the trustees on the
progressive force argument may lead
to their taking of good positions
(such as on Phelps-Dodge) for the
wrong reasons.
But, until the trustees see the role
of U.S. corporations in the South Af
rica context with all their strategic
implications, Stanford's investment
policy on South Africa will remain
fatally flawed.
For this reason many Stanford
community members are calling on
the trustees to extend their regular
monthly meeting and come to Stan
ford to hear the information that led
groups such as the YWCA and the
CIR to support the position of corpo
rate withdrawal.
We are also calling on the trustees
to abandon their prejudices and

examine the evidence on South Af
rica, not just the employment prac
tices of a few companies, and accept
the position of corporate withdrawal
as the position of Stanford Univer
sity.
Other universities have done so.
Why should Stanford, dedicated as it

is to strong and unbiased inquiry and
analysis, have a policy on South Af
rica shaped not by the facts, but
rather by the opinions of our Board
of Trustees?
