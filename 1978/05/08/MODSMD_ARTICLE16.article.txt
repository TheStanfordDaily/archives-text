The Stanford men's and
women's tennis teams com
bined forces yesterday in
Maples against World Team
Tennis' Golden Caters in a be
nefit for women's sports. The
Caters eeked out a one point
victory in overtime 24-23.
It was a match in which the
Stanford women's play over
shadowed the Stanford men's
play as Barb Jordan defeated
Marisa Kruger 6-3, in the wo
men's singles, and Diane Mor
rison and Susie Hagey de
feated Wimbledon Champion
Virginia Wade and liana Kloss
in the women's doubles 6-2.
The Cards started out on the
wrong foot as they dropped
the mixed doubles 6-3. Peter
Rennert and Kathy Jordan were
broken in the first game of the
match and the Cater pair of
Kruger and Frew McMillan
never looked back.
Earlier in the day Diane Mor
rison had played four matches
in 90 degree weather in win
ning the Northern California
Intercollegiate singles and
doubles championships, so it
was understandable at five
o'clock when she dragged her
self to Maples to practice, she
seemed worn out. But there's
something about hearing the
Band play in Maples that seems

to get the adrenalin flowing.
If Morrison was tired, she
didn't let anyone on to the fact.
Teaming up with Susie Hagey,
the collegiate champs put on a
clinic on the game of doubles.
The presence of the Wimble
don Champion did not intimi
date the Card pair. If anyone
left impressed, it was Wade and
Kloss.
This victory moved the Cards
out to a four point lead and it
seemed they also had the
momentum. When John
McEnroe won the first two
games against Sandy Mayer,
the crowd now thought it was
all over. Mayer turned it
around, though, winning the

set 6-4 and slicing the Cardinal
lead to just two.
In the final match of the
night, the Card team of Perry
Wright and Bill Maze were
down 3-1, when Wright had
trouble with his knee and was
forced to leave. John Rast, sub
stituting for Wright, gave the
team a lift as they immediately
won the next two games to

knot the match at three-all.
But McMillan, playing with
ex-USC grad Mike Wayman,
pulled the set out, 6-4. Then,
because the match score was
tied at 22-all, a super tie
breaker was played to deter
mine the match outcome.
McMillan and Wayman pre
vailed seven points to one and
the Caters had won the con
test.
