## Netters crush Bears 
### Chris Haft 
Stanford's men's tennis team overcame aches
and pains Saturday at Berkeley to trounce the
Cal Bears, 8-1.
The Cardinals were without the services of
No. 3 singles player Matt Mitchell, who had a
strep throat. Cal, without No. 1 Cary Stansbury,
was also at sub-par strength.
Perry Wright, replacing Mitchell in the No. 3
slot, also suffered physical damage. With the
score tied 5-5 in the third set, Wright stepped
into a backhand and aggravated his already sore
knee.
"Perry's knee worries me, because it could be
serious," said Card coach Dick Could. "We

won't know anything definite until the trainer
looks at it."
On Wednesday, Stanford will face Pepper
dine, which has also previously defeated Cal.
"They're a really strong team," said Could of the
Waves. "It'll take another effort like today's to
beat them."
