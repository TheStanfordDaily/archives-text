# Trojan nine sweeps Cards
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Though the weather was
gorgeous on the Stanford
campus this weekend, ail three
days were bleak for the varsity
baseball team. The Cardinals
bowed to the mighty USC Tro
jans in all three games of their
next-to-last league series of
this year.
Friday, USC pounded the
Cards 17-7; Saturday the two
teams were neck and neck
until the ninth inning when the
Trojans came up with two runs
to win, 4-3. Sunday, Stanford
again lost by a wide margin,
12-6.
The three wins increase the
Trojans current winning streak
to 15 games and makes their

league record 12-2. With the
Saturday win, along with UC
LA's loss to Cal, USC cinched
the Pacific-8 Southern Division
title for the eighth time in nine
years.
With the exception of Satur
day's game, absolutely nothing
went well for the Cards. A
combination of a weak offen
sive attack, a lack of good
pitching, and a number of un
sightly errors— including Larry
Reynold's first in two years —
plagued the Stanford team.
On the other side of the
coin, USC was awesome at bat,
slugging a total of 40 hits for the
three game series, including
seven home runs. On the
mound, the three Trojan star

ters successfully stymied the
Cardinal batters and even
when Stanford got the bat on
the ball, it was hit right at one
of the sharp Trojan fielders.
"They (USC) certainly de
served to win it (the series),"
said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess. "We made mistakes;
they took advance of our mis
takes. That's what a good team
will do."
Forgetting the humiliating
experience of Friday after
noon, the Cards came into the
second game of the series hop
ing to hand All-America Bill
Bordley his second loss of his
USC career. Joe LoPresti went
the distance on the mound for
the Cards in an outstanding ef
fort.
Dave Perez put the Cards on
equal ground with the Trojans
in the fifth with a two-run blast
to straight-away centerfield,
after the Trojans had scratched
out two runs in their half of that
inning.
In the seventh, Paul Zuvella
singled to lead off the inning,
was moved to second and then
to third by Todd Ervin and
Perez, and scored when
freshman catcher Phil Wilson
placed a single just in front of
centerfielder Bob Skube. That
gave Stanford a 3-2 edge.
It looked like LoPresti was
going to ruin the Sports Illus
trated story on Bordley that
was in process over the
weekend, but USC third base
man Dave Engle saved the
game for his teammate. Engle
took a LoPresti pitch out of the
park inthetopof the ninth with
Dave Hostetler on first base to
make the score 4-3 in favor of
the Trojans.
Yesterday, Larry Kuhn, who
is the only pitcher to have de
feated Bordley in his college
career, ran into trouble early in
the game. USC jumped out to a
3-0 lead in the first inning,
capitalizing on a hit batter, two
Stanford errors and two hits.
The Trojans maintained that
lead and stretched it out as the

game progressed. They added
single runs in the third and
fourth on home runs by Keith
Brown and Dave Hodgins. USC
collected one in the seventh,
one in the eighth and brought
in three more in their last ups
against Stanford this year.
Stanford's scoring was scat
tered throughout the game.
The best offensive perfor
mance in the game came in the
sixth inning. Designated hitter
Randy Wong jacked his eighth
home run of the year — a two
run shot to right-center.
The Cardinals league record
tumbled to 4-10-1 this
weekend, closely resembling
their finishing mark of 5-13 for
the 1977 season.

title for the eighth time in nine
years.
With the exception of Satur
day's game, absolutely nothing
went well for the Cards. A
combination of a weak offen
sive attack, a lack of good
pitching, and a number of un
sightly errors— including Larry
Reynold's first in two years —
plagued the Stanford team.
On the other side of the
coin, USC was awesome at bat,
slugging a total of 40 hits for the
three game series, including
seven home runs. On the
mound, the three Trojan star

ters successfully stymied the
Cardinal batters and even
when Stanford got the bat on
the ball, it was hit right at one
of the sharp Trojan fielders.
"They (USC) certainly de
served to win it (the series),"
said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess. "We made mistakes;
they took advance of our mis
takes. That's what a good team
will do."
Forgetting the humiliating
experience of Friday after
noon, the Cards came into the
second game of the series hop
ing to hand All-America Bill
Bordley his second loss of his
USC career. Joe LoPresti went
the distance on the mound for
the Cards in an outstanding ef
fort.
Dave Perez put the Cards on
equal ground with the Trojans
in the fifth with a two-run blast
to straight-away centerfield,
after the Trojans had scratched
out two runs in their half of that
inning.
In the seventh, Paul Zuvella
singled to lead off the inning,
was moved to second and then
to third by Todd Ervin and
Perez, and scored when
freshman catcher Phil Wilson
placed a single just in front of
centerfielder Bob Skube. That
gave Stanford a 3-2 edge.
It looked like LoPresti was
going to ruin the Sports Illus
trated story on Bordley that
was in process over the
weekend, but USC third base
man Dave Engle saved the
game for his teammate. Engle
took a LoPresti pitch out of the
park inthetopof the ninth with
Dave Hostetler on first base to
make the score 4-3 in favor of
the Trojans.
Yesterday, Larry Kuhn, who
is the only pitcher to have de
feated Bordley in his college
career, ran into trouble early in
the game. USC jumped out to a
3-0 lead in the first inning,
capitalizing on a hit batter, two
Stanford errors and two hits.
The Trojans maintained that
lead and stretched it out as the

game progressed. They added
single runs in the third and
fourth on home runs by Keith
Brown and Dave Hodgins. USC
collected one in the seventh,
one in the eighth and brought
in three more in their last ups
against Stanford this year.
Stanford's scoring was scat
tered throughout the game.
The best offensive perfor
mance in the game came in the
sixth inning. Designated hitter
Randy Wong jacked his eighth
home run of the year — a two
run shot to right-center.
The Cardinals league record
tumbled to 4-10-1 this
weekend, closely resembling
their finishing mark of 5-13 for
the 1977 season.

Though the weather was
gorgeous on the Stanford
campus this weekend, ail three
days were bleak for the varsity
baseball team. The Cardinals
bowed to the mighty USC Tro
jans in all three games of their
next-to-last league series of
this year.
Friday, USC pounded the
Cards 17-7; Saturday the two
teams were neck and neck
until the ninth inning when the
Trojans came up with two runs
to win, 4-3. Sunday, Stanford
again lost by a wide margin,
12-6.
The three wins increase the
Trojans current winning streak
to 15 games and makes their

league record 12-2. With the
Saturday win, along with UC
LA's loss to Cal, USC cinched
the Pacific-8 Southern Division
title for the eighth time in nine
years.
