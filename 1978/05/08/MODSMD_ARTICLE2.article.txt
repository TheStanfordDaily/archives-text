# Bandow elected president
## College Republicans turn to the right 
### Lee Tien News analysis 
"Not illegal, but pretty shady," was how outgo
ing president of the Stanford chapter of the Col
lege Republicans (CR) Paul Cheverton described
the election of next year's CR officers.
Between 40 and 45 members were present for
the April 26 selection of Doug Bandow as presi
dent. Bandow, second-year law student and ASSU
Senator, said he was looking forward to an "excit
ing election year" and hoped the club would be
more "active and visible" on campus.
Bandow and the other new officers all ran un
opposed.
Some 25 new members joined the club at the
meeting. Bill Cosgrove, a member of CR and
vice president of CSU said "many of them had
never been members before. The main reason that
they were there was to help Bandow get elected.
The way it ended up, it was kind of ridiculous.
There weren't any opposing nominations; the
same people would have been elected anyway."
Bandow offered to pay membership dues for 13
of the new members, but Cheverton refused to

accept Bandow's check.
"It was a matter of convenience," Bandow
explained. "As it turned out, I was glad that they
paid out of their own pockets, so I didn't have to
collect money from them later."
He also mentioned that although "six to eight of
the people" would probably "never come again,"
most of them were conservatives who had at
tended meetings before but who had been "dis
appointed" with the club's direction.
Freshman Tom Friedbergwas elected first vice
president.
Also elected were: Peter Radin, freshman, as
second vice president; Jim Preston, first-year law
student, as third vice president; Dan Livingston,
junior, as secretary-treasurer and Ingrid Nystrom,
freshman, as newsletter editor.
Bandow said "it seemed like anyone to the right
of McCloskey was being ignored. It was time for
conservatives to reassert their influence in the
club." Bandow, Preston and Livingston, who are
members of the Conservative Students Union
(CSU), ran together.
Bandow added, "I felt the club was getting too

involved with certain candidates, rather than help
ing people get interested in their own candidates.
Also, the club needs to be more campus
oriented."
"The opportunities were there for the conserva
tives to get involved," Cheverton said. "What I
thought was important was trying to appeal to a
broader base. On a college campus you just have
to be a little more progressive."
He said he feared a more conservative stance
would "scare off" potential members.
A recorded vote was taken for Livingston's elec
tion when the voice vote proved inconclusive, but
he was elected, Cosgrove said.
Neither Livingston nor Preston had previously
been members of CR, but Preston's nomination
went unquestioned.
Cheverton expressed doubt that Bandow would
succeed in making the club more popular with the
shift toward the right. "I don't think that they'll be
as successful as they could have been. What they
want to do has been tried in the past — it's not
particularly new."
