"It was sweet revenge," said Sue Handel.
"It" was a 3-0 taming of the Cal women's soc
cer team by Stanford, to give them the lead in
the Northern California Women's Soccer Con
ference with one game left to play for the Cards.
"It" was also a 2-0 victory by Stanford's second
team, to complete a sweep of the doubleheader
with Berkeley on Saturday, bringing their record
to 2-3-1.
For the I's, the win resulted in a return to first
place in the league and was consolation for the
4-3 loss to Cal in March.
"Our team went 100 per cent the whole game
— we went hard even when we were ahead two,
three to nothing. They didn't slow down, they
were not satisfied. They remember losing to
Berkeley. Ofie thing I can say that I am very
proud of is that we have never lost to any team
twice in one season. That's something that
comes from the Stanford athlete," said head
coach Phil Wright.
The Bears, with a 9-2 record had to get a win or
tie to keep control of the top spot. Stanford
faces Hayward State Saturday at 2 p.m. on Roble
Field, putting their 9-1-1 conference record on
the line — a win will wrap up the title for the
Cards.
"We have one more game. Of course we can't
let down next week; we have to win but it's at
home and we're a better team than them. I think
we're going to win it," Wright said.
Stanford beat Hayward in their previous meet
ing, 3-2.
John Jenke, I I's head coach, credited the win
to the ability to open space and move the ball,
although he felt that the style of play was still
rushed.
"I think our entire game was centered on the
play of Betsy Lovekin — she directed play, pro
vided the defensive strength to allow our of
fense to go into a relentless, almost uncom
promising attack. I think she used the know
ledge she gained (in the first ll's match with Cal)
to help her play in this game and it showed
because they didn't have a single shot on goal,"
Jenke explained.
After a scoreless first half, the ll's went ahead

on a goal by Pam Krone six minutes into the
second half. Anne Vosti added the final goal six
minutes later.
"Krone showed a remarkable ability to win the
ball in the front line and thisenabled usto main
tain possession of the ball," Jenke said.
Other standouts for the ll's were Karen Ven
iga, Karen Benedek and Dianne Long.
"Veniga had seven or eight runs that were real
goal threats; she played a very exceptional
game. Longplayedasuperbgameatwing. Sheis
probably the most technically-skilled player on
our team. Benedek played well in terms of di
recting play," Jenke added.
The ll's meet Cal again May 20 and host Davis
on May 21.
In the I's game, Ellen Griep led off the scoring,
putting in a shot with 10 minutes left in the first
half. Lisa Steinkampf added the other two goals
for the Cards, one eight minutes into the second
half. Steinkampf's second goal came 10 minutes
before the end of the game on a double assist by
Handel.
The key to the turnaround in the Stanford-
Berkeley match-up was defense. In March, the
lack of it hurt the Cards, as the Bears penetrated
and shot too easily. Saturday, the experienced,
improved Stanford defense thwarted the Cal
forwards.
"I didn't see a chance for them (Berkeley) to
score ever. I had so much confidence in our
defense — Lynne (McComb-goalie) and all four
of the fullbacks and Cindy (Shorney)," Wright
said.
"The defense played a fantastic game and the
midfield controlled the ball and fed the ball to
the offense. The defense, by containing the
four-man line coming at them, made the game.
They (Berkeley) couldn't do anything; they were
playing kick and run and we were playing a real
controlled ball and that's the difference right
there," said Nancy Jo Geenan.
A key to Stanford's defense is Shorney.
"Cindy, fortwoyears, has dominated the mid
field against every player she's ever played
against and in my opinion she's the best
halfback in the western United States if not the
United States. She has never had a halfback out
play her," Wright said.

lack of it hurt the Cards, as the Bears penetrated
and shot too easily. Saturday, the experienced,
improved Stanford defense thwarted the Cal
forwards.
"I didn't see a chance for them (Berkeley) to
score ever. I had so much confidence in our
defense — Lynne (McComb-goalie) and all four
of the fullbacks and Cindy (Shorney)," Wright
said.
"The defense played a fantastic game and the
midfield controlled the ball and fed the ball to
the offense. The defense, by containing the
four-man line coming at them, made the game.
They (Berkeley) couldn't do anything; they were
playing kick and run and we were playing a real
controlled ball and that's the difference right
there," said Nancy Jo Geenan.
A key to Stanford's defense is Shorney.
"Cindy, fortwoyears, has dominated the mid
field against every player she's ever played
against and in my opinion she's the best
halfback in the western United States if not the
United States. She has never had a halfback out
play her," Wright said.

Julie Zender battles with a Berkeley opponent for the ball. The Cards virtually sealed the conference title
with a 3-0 victory over the Bears this weekend.
"It was sweet revenge," said Sue Handel.
"It" was a 3-0 taming of the Cal women's soc
cer team by Stanford, to give them the lead in
the Northern California Women's Soccer Con
ference with one game left to play for the Cards.
"It" was also a 2-0 victory by Stanford's second
team, to complete a sweep of the doubleheader
with Berkeley on Saturday, bringing their record
to 2-3-1.
For the I's, the win resulted in a return to first
place in the league and was consolation for the
4-3 loss to Cal in March.
"Our team went 100 per cent the whole game
— we went hard even when we were ahead two,
three to nothing. They didn't slow down, they
were not satisfied. They remember losing to
Berkeley. Ofie thing I can say that I am very
proud of is that we have never lost to any team
twice in one season. That's something that
comes from the Stanford athlete," said head
coach Phil Wright.
The Bears, with a 9-2 record had to get a win or
tie to keep control of the top spot. Stanford
faces Hayward State Saturday at 2 p.m. on Roble
Field, putting their 9-1-1 conference record on
the line — a win will wrap up the title for the
Cards.
"We have one more game. Of course we can't
let down next week; we have to win but it's at
home and we're a better team than them. I think
we're going to win it," Wright said.
Stanford beat Hayward in their previous meet
ing, 3-2.
John Jenke, I I's head coach, credited the win
to the ability to open space and move the ball,
although he felt that the style of play was still
rushed.
"I think our entire game was centered on the
play of Betsy Lovekin — she directed play, pro
vided the defensive strength to allow our of
fense to go into a relentless, almost uncom
promising attack. I think she used the know
ledge she gained (in the first ll's match with Cal)
to help her play in this game and it showed
because they didn't have a single shot on goal,"
Jenke explained.
After a scoreless first half, the ll's went ahead

on a goal by Pam Krone six minutes into the
second half. Anne Vosti added the final goal six
minutes later.
"Krone showed a remarkable ability to win the
ball in the front line and thisenabled usto main
tain possession of the ball," Jenke said.
Other standouts for the ll's were Karen Ven
iga, Karen Benedek and Dianne Long.
"Veniga had seven or eight runs that were real
goal threats; she played a very exceptional
game. Longplayedasuperbgameatwing. Sheis
probably the most technically-skilled player on
our team. Benedek played well in terms of di
recting play," Jenke added.
The ll's meet Cal again May 20 and host Davis
on May 21.
In the I's game, Ellen Griep led off the scoring,
putting in a shot with 10 minutes left in the first
half. Lisa Steinkampf added the other two goals
for the Cards, one eight minutes into the second
half. Steinkampf's second goal came 10 minutes
before the end of the game on a double assist by
Handel.
The key to the turnaround in the Stanford-
Berkeley match-up was defense. In March, the
lack of it hurt the Cards, as the Bears penetrated
and shot too easily. Saturday, the experienced,
improved Stanford defense thwarted the Cal
forwards.
"I didn't see a chance for them (Berkeley) to
score ever. I had so much confidence in our
