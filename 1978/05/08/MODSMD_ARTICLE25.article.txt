ing out their "death sentence" on the president of Italy's
ruling Christian Democrat party.
Hundreds of police searched the hills north of Rome
yesterday, continuing the hunt that has failed to find
Moro or the persons who seized the former premier
March 16 in a Rome street ambush.
CIA accused of 'stupidity' in Angola
Washington — A former CIA official said yesterday that
"blundering stupidity" by the intelligence agency paved
the way for massive intervention in Angola later by Cuba
and the Soviet Union.
John Stockwell, a 12-year CIA veteran who said he
commanded the ClA's Angola task force in agency
headquarters at Langley, Va., made the allegations in an
interview on the CB S television program "60 Minutes."
Stockwell said the CIA embarked on what amounted
to a "secret war" in the torn country, but withheld in
formation about its activities from the congressional
committees set up to oversee covert CIA operations.
PLO fires rocket into Jerusalem
Jerusalem — Yasser Arafat's Palestinian guerrillas
claimed responsibility yesterday for the first rocket at
tack in Jerusalem since 1976, and said it was timed to
coincide with this week's 30th anniversary of Israeli in
dependence.
Authorities here said one woman was injured in the
explosion of a single Soviet-made Katyusha rocket. The
Palestine Liberation Organization in Beirut, Lebanon,
said several persons were killed or injured in a "heavy
rocket attack" and Israeli government buildings were
damaged.
It was the first time in two years that Arab guerrillas
had fired a Katyusha rocket into the holy city. Indepen
dence day celebrations have been traditional targets for
Arab terrorism, and Israeli police and civilians were on
alert against possible attacks.
Compromise on jet sale expected
Washington — President Jimmy Carter and his oppo
nents in Congress may be ready to compromise this
week on his proposal to sell jet fighters to Israel, Egypt
and Saudi Arabia.
An administration source, who asked not to be iden
tified, said Carter is willing to compromise, and Sen.
Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.) says he thinks congressional oppo
nents are also.
"My guess is that when the proposal comes from
Carter there will be acceptance," Javits said.
The terms of a possible compromise are unclear. The
administration source said Carter is willing only to add a
commitment to give Israel more planes in the future.
East-West talks break new ground
Hamburg, West Germany — Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev wrapped up a four-day sunrnit yesterday with
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who said the
talks broke new ground in East-West relations.
"The new thing is the complete openness of the talks
on almost everything in the world. . . . That is the real
political result of the talks," Schmidt told a news confer
ence here minutes after Brezhnev's llyushin jetliner left

for Moscow.
Schmidt said President Jimmy Carter planned to tele
phone him later for a briefing on the summit.
The 71-year-old Brezhnev was given a full military sen
doff at hamburg airport. Backin Moscow, Brezhnev was
met at Vnuvko diplomatic airport by Premier Alexei
Kosygin and other top Soviet officials at a welcoming
ceremony broadcast live on Soviet television.
Ventura murder suspect found dead
Los Angeles — A dead man being investigated in the
Hillside Stranger case closely resembles a man wanted
for questioning in the strangulation murders of three
alleged prostitutes in Ventura County, authorities say.
The body of Richard Reynolds, 37, a registered sex
offender, was found with that of a woman whom inves
tigators say he may have attempted to assault prior to a
gun battle.
The woman, Roxanne Barnwell, 29, of Glendale, was a
supermarket checker who worked in Pasadena.
Glendale police contend Reynolds "is a very good
suspect" in the investigation of the deaths of 13 young
women that have been attributed to the so-called Hill
side Stranger. But Los Angeles police have all but elimi
nated him as a prime suspect because of an initial lack of
evidence.
Berkowitz guilty plea to be accepted
New York — The city's criminal court system plans to
accept possible guilty pleas from David Berkowitz, ac
cused of being the Son of Sam killer who terrorized the
city for a year.
The 24-year-old ex-postal clerk has admitted all six
murders. His lawyers want him to plead innocent to each
by reason of insanity.
Today he goes before state Supreme Court Justice
Joseph Corso in Brooklyn. If Berkowitz pleads guilty, as
expected, an unusual plan will take effect. Judges from
the three jurisdictions where Son of Sam is accused of
striking will appear in the courtroom prepared to accept
guilty pleas to all charges against Berkowitz.
Affirmative action affects unequal
Los Angeles — Affirmative action programs have
helped to nearly equalize wages earned by black and
white women, but there is little indication the programs
have done much for black men in that respect, accord
ing to studies released yesterday by two Rand Corp.
economists.
The studies by James Smith and Finis Welch show that
black men now earn about three-fourths as much as
white men while black women have just about achieved
parity with white women.
"Because hiring a black woman met both race and sex
quotas for employers, the affirmative action thrust may
have given black women advantage in the job mar
ket," the economists said.
