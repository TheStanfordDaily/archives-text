# District elections discussed
## Senate election change proposed 
### Rob Lempert 
In hopes of making the ASSU Senate more accessible
and accountable to students, several senators are striv
ing to place a constitutional amendment on next fall's
ballot which would instigate fundamental changes in the
way the body is elected.
Last quarter the ad hoc senate committee on election
reform brought two proposals before the senate, one of
which met with much opposition, said Sen. Steve
Buckley, who formed the committee. However no vote
was ever taken.
The first proposal called for staggered elections. Half
the senators would be elected in fall and half in spring.
This would give the senate a "blend of newness and
continuity," Buckley said, and he added this idea was
fairly well received.
The second and more controversial proposal called
for the student body to be divided into 10 districts based
on place of residence and for each senator to be elected
by a specific district instead of by all the students at
large. For instance, Wilbur would elect one senator and
Stern would elect one senator. Each district would con
tain about 600 students, said Peter Joost, another
senator on the committee.
Proponents of district elections say it would make the
senate more responsive and visible to the students.
"I like to talk to people, but there's no way you can
campaign all over campus," said Joost.
Sen. Tom McCormack added, "it is ludicrous to as
sume that I can be an effective senator for 6500 stu
dents."
Buckely said tying senators to specific groups of stu
dents would tend to make them more accountable to
their constituencies. He added that since senators
would be elected by a smaller number of students, cam
paigns would be cheaper, more personal, and would
allow the voter to make a more rational and thoughtful

choice.
Fred Crethel, senate chairperson, said he opposes the
districting idea on several grounds.
According to Grethel, districting divides the student
body along residential lines while their real needs and
interests aren't correlated with where they live. Grethel
also said districting creates problems for off-campus
students and would discriminate against minority
groups, whose numbers would be fractioned through
out several districts.
Sen. Carlyle Kennison said districting would reduce
the chances of minorities getting a senate seat because it
would split up the minority vote.
"Basically, only minorities vote for minorities," he
said.
Under McCormack's plan the campus would again be
divided into five residential districts, each with 1000 to
1200 students. Elections would be staggered with each
district electing an undergraduate senator and alternate
in the fall while students at large would elect five more
senators and alternates in the spring.
If the senate does decide on a reform plan, a constitu
tional amendment would go before the student body
next fall. A two-thirds vote would put it into effect.
If the senate votes against placing a proposal on the
fall ballot, a petition signed by 5 per cent of the students
could put it there instead.
McCormack said he'll be "pushing hard" to make sure
a districting proposal is considered in the fall.
McCormack said districting would help build the Se
nate's prestige. The purpose of the body is to compile a
lot of diverse opinions and districting would "leave
room for everybody to be represented," he added.
Buckley said because districting would bring senate
campaigns down to a more personal and thoughtful
level, it would increase voter turnout.
