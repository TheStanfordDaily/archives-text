## Fee assessments asked by groups

(Editor's Note: This fee assessment
profile is part one of a two-part
analysis. Tomorrow's section will de
scribe proposed uses for the ASSU
Program Fee and fee assessments for
the Academic Organizations Board,
Guest Professorship Board and
Graduate Students Association.)
Many campus programs will have
no funding to stay alive if 20 per cent
of the student body does not vote in
the fee assessment election Wed
nesday and Thursday.
"Our entire budget comes from
the fee assessment," said Glen
Schofield, attorney from the Stan
ford Legal Counseling Office (LCO).
"We know of no other source of
funds. The office will have to close if
the LCO fee assessment does not
pass," he said.
With regular lawyers fees at $50 to
$70 per hour, the LCO could not
function on a "users pay" system,
Schofield added.
A $1 fee assessment covers each
student and student spouse with a
type of legal insurance. Like any
other kind of insurance, the minimal
fee paid each year covers everyone
for any emergency that requires pro
fessional help.
The LCO handles problems rang
ing from landlord squabbles to car
and bike accidents. It is staffed by
four practicing attorneys and several
law students. Open three days a
week, LCO gives advice on any legal
problem.
Only students who demand the re
fund of their fee assessment are not
guaranteed free aid by the LCO.
Pub Board
Without fee assessment funding
for the Publications Board, many of
the student-run literary or journalis
tic publications will "cease al
together or suffer severe cutbacks,"
explained Barry Parr, board chairper
son.
The board consists of 15 student
editors or former editors who "act as

a resource of publishing know
ledge," Parr said. The board's job is
to distribute the fee assessment
money to campus publications
which range from humor magazines
to minority newspapers.
The publications rely on the board
for up to half of their operating costs.
"There isn't enough money availa
ble" for all these organizations to
cover 100 per cent of their expenses
without funds from the publishing
board, said Parr.
Sequoia, the Stanford Literary
magazine would "become disas
sociated with the Stanford commun
ity," said editor Ted Gioia. "Without
student body support we could no
longer give priority to student writ
ing. The special all-student issue
would not be published."
Other publications which would
be forced to close or cut back are
Aurora, Catalyst, La Onda, Stanford
Review, The Arena, Against the
Grain, Winds, The Real News, Edge
and the ASSU Course Guide.
Speakers Bureau
"Stanford students saw Dick Gre
gory speak for free this year. Without
fee assessment funding, we will have
to charge $3 to $4 a head fbr a speaker
like that," said Tom Wilmanns, direc
tor of the Speakers Bureau. "The
whole concept of the organization
would have to be changed. Programs
will be smaller and admission will be
charged."
The Speakers Bureau has worked
alone and with other groups on cam
pus' to bring to the University such
speakers as Milton Friedman and
Stansfield Turner. Sherry hours with
less well-known people who are
nonetheless experts in their fields
have also been arranged and fi
nanced by the Speakers Bureau.
"I think we served the student
body well this year. We really need
the fee assessment to keep going,"
said Wilmanns.
Funds for the Stanford Committee
on Political Education "are slowly

drying up," said Alex Alben, co
director of SCOPE.
Since all events are free, SCOPE
has depended on the Dickenson
Fund to finance its symposiums on
current political issues. Many other
organizations also rely on Dickenson
funds for their existence, so money is
tight, Alben said.
The Dickenson fund restricts
SCOPE to holding forums or debates
in which both sides of an issue are
presented.
"A lot of times it detracts from a
well-informed, respected speaker to
have to debate with someone less
knowledgeable in his field," Com
mented Alben.
With a fee assessment budget,
SCOPE will be able to have "fantas
tic" programs next year, said Alben.
Possible future speakers include: Ar
thur Schlessinger Jr. and Theodore
Sorenson. A forum on the Soviet
Union is also planned, with perspec
tive speakers such as recently re
leased dissident Mikhail Stern, and
Norman Kaiser, former Moscow
Bureau Chief for the Washington
Post.
Honorarium fees for well-known
speakers range from $1000 to $5000.
After travel and lodging expenses for
guests, plant services and publicity,
SCOPE'S fees approach $3000 per
speaker.
All the above organizations re
ceived more than 70 per cent yes
votes at the last election.
The groups were among the 11
which sought fee assessments in the
ASSU elections held last month.
In that election, all organizations
on the ballot received well over the
51 per cent majority of those voting
required for passage. Yet only as
sessment votes for the Daily, KZSU
and the band could be certified,
those organizations being the only
groups to receive votes from the re
quired 20 per cent of the registered
student body.
After the votes on campus were

tallied, none of the organizations
had hit the 20 per cent figure, but a
heavy turnout of voters at University
overseas' campuses pushed the
three groups over the mark.
Oddly, the Daily and the band are
the only two organizations which
could most easily survive without the
fee assessment money, though the
band would have to forego some
trips to away sports events and the
Daily would be forced to delay
needed capital improvements.

The Speakers Bureau has worked
alone and with other groups on cam
pus' to bring to the University such
speakers as Milton Friedman and
Stansfield Turner. Sherry hours with
less well-known people who are
nonetheless experts in their fields
have also been arranged and fi
nanced by the Speakers Bureau.
"I think we served the student
body well this year. We really need
the fee assessment to keep going,"
said Wilmanns.
Funds for the Stanford Committee
on Political Education "are slowly

drying up," said Alex Alben, co
director of SCOPE.
Since all events are free, SCOPE
has depended on the Dickenson
Fund to finance its symposiums on
current political issues. Many other
organizations also rely on Dickenson
funds for their existence, so money is
tight, Alben said.
The Dickenson fund restricts
SCOPE to holding forums or debates
in which both sides of an issue are
presented.
"A lot of times it detracts from a
well-informed, respected speaker to
have to debate with someone less
knowledgeable in his field," Com
mented Alben.
With a fee assessment budget,
SCOPE will be able to have "fantas
tic" programs next year, said Alben.
Possible future speakers include: Ar
thur Schlessinger Jr. and Theodore
Sorenson. A forum on the Soviet
Union is also planned, with perspec
tive speakers such as recently re
leased dissident Mikhail Stern, and
Norman Kaiser, former Moscow
Bureau Chief for the Washington
Post.
Honorarium fees for well-known
speakers range from $1000 to $5000.
After travel and lodging expenses for
guests, plant services and publicity,
SCOPE'S fees approach $3000 per
speaker.
All the above organizations re
ceived more than 70 per cent yes
votes at the last election.
The groups were among the 11
which sought fee assessments in the
ASSU elections held last month.
In that election, all organizations
on the ballot received well over the
51 per cent majority of those voting
required for passage. Yet only as
sessment votes for the Daily, KZSU
and the band could be certified,
those organizations being the only
groups to receive votes from the re
quired 20 per cent of the registered
student body.
After the votes on campus were

tallied, none of the organizations
had hit the 20 per cent figure, but a
heavy turnout of voters at University
overseas' campuses pushed the
three groups over the mark.
Oddly, the Daily and the band are
the only two organizations which
could most easily survive without the
fee assessment money, though the
band would have to forego some
trips to away sports events and the
Daily would be forced to delay
needed capital improvements.
(Editor's Note: This fee assessment
profile is part one of a two-part
analysis. Tomorrow's section will de
scribe proposed uses for the ASSU
Program Fee and fee assessments for
the Academic Organizations Board,
Guest Professorship Board and
Graduate Students Association.)
Many campus programs will have
no funding to stay alive if 20 per cent
of the student body does not vote in
the fee assessment election Wed
nesday and Thursday.
"Our entire budget comes from
the fee assessment," said Glen
Schofield, attorney from the Stan
ford Legal Counseling Office (LCO).
"We know of no other source of
funds. The office will have to close if
the LCO fee assessment does not
pass," he said.
With regular lawyers fees at $50 to
$70 per hour, the LCO could not
function on a "users pay" system,
Schofield added.
A $1 fee assessment covers each
student and student spouse with a
type of legal insurance. Like any
other kind of insurance, the minimal
fee paid each year covers everyone
for any emergency that requires pro
fessional help.
The LCO handles problems rang
ing from landlord squabbles to car
and bike accidents. It is staffed by
four practicing attorneys and several
law students. Open three days a
week, LCO gives advice on any legal
problem.
Only students who demand the re
fund of their fee assessment are not
guaranteed free aid by the LCO.
Pub Board
Without fee assessment funding
for the Publications Board, many of
the student-run literary or journalis
tic publications will "cease al
together or suffer severe cutbacks,"
explained Barry Parr, board chairper
son.
The board consists of 15 student
editors or former editors who "act as

a resource of publishing know
ledge," Parr said. The board's job is
to distribute the fee assessment
money to campus publications
which range from humor magazines
to minority newspapers.
The publications rely on the board
for up to half of their operating costs.
"There isn't enough money availa
ble" for all these organizations to
cover 100 per cent of their expenses
without funds from the publishing
board, said Parr.
Sequoia, the Stanford Literary
magazine would "become disas
sociated with the Stanford commun
ity," said editor Ted Gioia. "Without
student body support we could no
longer give priority to student writ
ing. The special all-student issue
would not be published."
Other publications which would
be forced to close or cut back are
Aurora, Catalyst, La Onda, Stanford
Review, The Arena, Against the
Grain, Winds, The Real News, Edge
and the ASSU Course Guide.
Speakers Bureau
"Stanford students saw Dick Gre
gory speak for free this year. Without
fee assessment funding, we will have
to charge $3 to $4 a head fbr a speaker
like that," said Tom Wilmanns, direc
tor of the Speakers Bureau. "The
whole concept of the organization
would have to be changed. Programs
will be smaller and admission will be
charged."
The Speakers Bureau has worked
