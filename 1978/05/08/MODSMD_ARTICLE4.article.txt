# Trustees, CIR differ on limits

### Jill Liscom 
The difference between the Board
of Trustees and the Committee on
Investment Responsibility (CIR) is
not whether companies have been
causing "substantial social injury"
but, rather, "where the line should
be drawn in applying that criterion,"
explained Board of Trustees Presi
dent Peter Bing in response to a letter
from CIR chairman Frederick Hillier.
In his letter, Hillier clarified the
ClR's position on withdrawal with re
spect to the substantial social injury
criterion.
The ClR's analysis "suggests that
American and other foreign based
firms have not only taken advantage
of the substantial social injury
primarily caused by the South Afri
can government, but also in varying
degrees have contributed directly
and indirectly to continuing a pattern
of substantial social injury," wrote
Hillier.
Records evaluated
In contrast, the Trustee Subcom
mittee on Investment Responsibility
determined social injury "primarily,
but not exclusively, upon the com
pany's own record of socially affirma
tive action in South Africa," stated
Bing.
In cases where the companies
have a good record of socially affir
mative action, "the Board was less
inclined to place emphasis upon
possible indirect consequences of a
corporation's presence in South Af
rica," Bing continued.
Commenting on Bing's letter, Hill
ier said it indicates the trustees feel
the decision to withdraw "should be
based primarily on a micro analysis
focusing on the internal employment
practices of the company."
Effects examined
On the other hand, the CIR sup
ports a macro analysis focusing on

the effect of the companies' pre
sence in maintaining the current so
cial structure of South Africa, said
Hillier.
"Both letters focus on the area
where the trustees and the CIR have
come to different conclusions, but I
want to emphasize that the trustees
have come a long way in one year in
agreeing with CIR recommendations
that there should not be further
loans to the government of South Af
rica, that companies should not be
expanding the scope of their opera
tions and that companies should be
withdrawing under certain condi
tions," commented Hillier.
"I am very hopeful that with more
time the trustees will gain a greater
appreciation for the CIR analysis that
the South African situation is a truly
extraordinary one where macro con
siderations are central," he added.
The board will consider the work
of the ad hoc subcommittee on In
vestment Responsibility at a break
fast meeting today in Los Angeles.
Telephone discussions
Since the last board meeting one
month ago, the subcommittee has
met twice by conference telephone
call to consider recommendations of
the CIR concerning certain proxy is
sues.
The subcommittee findings were
sent to the entire board with a re
quest for response to its recommen
dations. Based on trustee responses,
Bing voted the proxies on behalf of
the University.
A full-board discussion of sub
committee work may well occur
when the full board meets this after
noon.
SCRIP has organized a rally for
noon today at White Plaza to urge the
trustees to fly here after their meet
ing to attend a public forum tonight.
