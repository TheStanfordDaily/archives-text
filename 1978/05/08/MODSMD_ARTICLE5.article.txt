A concerned Stanford community
demanded better quality health pro
cedures in the University's DNA
laboratories during a recent meeting
of the Panel for Recombinant DNA
Molecules.
The panel, which researches
policies in splicing genetic materials
to form new biological combina
tions, met May 4 in the Center for
Educational Research at Stanford
(CERAS).
The major concern of the audience
was the danger of contamination in
designated work areas.
"We should develop some type of
task force, then we can set up an
intelligent procedure for health
monitoring," one student said.
'Responsibility'
"We have a responsibility to not
misinform or frighten the public
where there is no basis," said John
Brauman, chemistry professor and
chairman of the DNA panel.
He added he felt the problem of
health'monitoring is in not knowing
how to test for contamination.
"We should move to accomplish

something (health monitoring pro
cedures), not just for the sake of
moving," he said.
Minutes unavailable
Complaint was also heard on the
issue of the panel's accessibility to
the public. "The only way to know
the action of this committee is
through the minutes," said one con
cerned person. "They (minutes)
have not always been available.
You're still way behind and as a result
we know nothing."
According to Andrew Golden
kranz, Council of Presidents (COP)
president-elect, minutes for the last
six months have been virtually unav
ailable.
The issue of public participation
was also raised during the panel's
meeting.
Diana Dutton, associate professor
of preventive medicine, said, "I think
more public participation should be
tried. The most basic issue is 'Why
should only some meetings of the
panel be open to the public?' The
only way to build public trust is to
have an open spirit where informa
