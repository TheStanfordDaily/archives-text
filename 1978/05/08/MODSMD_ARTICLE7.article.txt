# SCRIP 'cures' considered worse than 'illness'
## 
### 
Try this scenario on for size: a per
son has a very bad case of acne; one
doctor is consulted and his/her re
commendation is surgery — to am
putate at the neckline.
This, in essence, is the outline of
the argument by Funk and Whitson
(Daily, May 3) in which they diagnose
that Stanford is blemished (it re
jected three of the five CIR recom
mendations) and the correct cure is
to cut its carotid artery (stop the flow
of "cold hard cash"). There are sev
eral serious flaws in both their diag

nosis and especially their prescrip
tion for cure.
First, Funk and Whitson cite the
recent ASSU elections in which 61
per cent of the votes were cast for
withdrawal (not divestiture). They
neglect to mention that this is 67 per
cent of less than 20 per cent of the
student body.
Second, Funk and Whitson cor
rectly point out that the membership
of SCRIP, even though it is very
vocal, cannot be construed to repre
sent the entire campus community

fat most only 1 to 2 per cent ot the
student body are members).
But then they draw the heroic and
heinous conclusion that the remain
ing 98 to 99 per cent of the student
body "must feel a certain outrage in
the wake of the trustees' rejection of
three of the five CIR recommenda
tions." Do you?!
Finally, after their diagnosis of the
problem. Funk and Whitson exhort
us to boycott all University fund
raising activities (especially the
Senior Pledge Program) until "the

administration and the trustees see
fit to adopt a responsive and respon
sible investment policy in South Af
rica."
Even if the administration and the
trustees were to adopt a policy which
met with Funk's and Whitson's ap
proval, should those students op
posed to nuclear weapons continue
the boycott because Stanford trains
nuclear engineers?
Should young libertarians con
tinue the boycott because Stanford
turns out politicians? Should athletes

continue the boycott if Stanford
doesn't change its mascot?
In short, the magnitude of the
malady diagnosed by Frank and
Whitson is not nearly as serious as
they would have us believe. Indeed
the vast majority of the student body
has not voiced its opinion one way or
the other.
And their prescribed cure is both
insipid and ill-advised; donations to
Stanford subsidize over 50 per cent
of a student's education (including
Funk and Whitson and all the mem-

Tony Becker

bers of SCRIP).
Admittedly Stanford has its faults
and cannot be expected to satisfy
everyone. But it does do some good
things like educate people who will
become doctors, engineers and
teachers. Boycotting contributions
would seriously curtail these positive
aspects. Is it rational to cut off our
heads to spite our acne or are there
other, less radical cures?
