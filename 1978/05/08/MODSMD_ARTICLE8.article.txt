## Jarvis-Gann increases state control 
### 
Eric Miethke

Doug Bandow's column (Daily,
May 3) demonstrates what happens
when lawyers argue about economic
issues â€” they are satisfied with cour
troom rhetoric and don't consider
the full economic implications of
their argument.
No one can dispute the idea that
Californians desperately need prop
erty tax relief. But what if the cure is
worse than the illness, the costs
higher than the benefits? Is it really
worth amputating your hand over a
hangnail?
Let's examine the Jarvis-Gann
proposition moreclosely. First, Jarvis
would indeed reduce property tax
revenues by $7 billion. But who really
benefits from this? Homeowners will
receive only 34 per cent of this tax
relief while businesses and the State
will receive 56 per cent and 10 per
cent of the relief respectively.
As time progresses, the tax load
will shift even further from busines
ses to homeowners. Under Jarvis,
property is reassessed and taxed at
full market value each time it is sold.
Homes are sold on an average of
every seven years, while businesses
are sold much less often, if at all.
Home assessments will rise much
faster than business assessments
and cause a shift in the tax burden.
Bandow asserts that "high prop
erty taxes are a business cost that
consumers pay." But look at the cure
Jarvis offers. To replace the $7 billion
in lost local revenue, an increase in
the state sales, income or corpora
tion taxes may be expected. Senator
Rodda has already introduced such a
measure that would increase per
sonal income tax 20 per cent, sales
tax 1 per cent and business and cor
poration lax 40per cent. Is this going
to result in lower consumer prices?
Bandow then discusses renters
and admits, "There is no explicit pro
vision concerning renters." Forty
five per cent of all residences in
California are rentals. Current and
projected shortages of rentals in the
face of increased demand will con
tinue the "upward pressure" on
prices, even if taxes are reduced.
Furthermore, why should renters
have to rely on the goodwill of land
lords for rent relief? Certainly renters
need love too.
Renters penalized
Renters are futher penalized under
Jarvis. They are not guaranteed lower
rents, yet they will share the in
creased burden of any increase in
sales and income taxes. Homeow
ners, too, will bear a tremendous
burden since they pay 35 per cent of
property taxes, as well as 55 per
cent of sales taxes and 75 per cent of
income taxes. But Bandow is con
cerned with tax relief, and Jarvis is his
cure.
Bandow further supports Jarvis-

Cann because "it's about time we
sent the SOB's who rule us a mes
sage." Perhaps Doug should check
the address he's sending his message
to. )arvis affects property taxes,
which is the life blood of local gov
ernment, not state government.
Again, here are just a few of the im
plications.
Local governments currently raise
revenues for schools, police and fire
facilities, libraries, hospitais and
other capital improvements through
the issuance of municipal bonds.
These bonds are serviced through
property tax overrides. Jarvis-Gann
would reduce local tax revenues and
would limit the security local gov
ernments could offer bondholders.
This will drive up interest rates
municipalities would have to pay on
bonds and therefore increase con
struction costs.
Moreover, it is questionable if
bonds could be issued at all. Since
property tax overrides would be
eliminated under Jarvis, all future
bonds would have to be serviced
within the )arvis-Gann tax limits. This
is almost an inconceivable criterion
to be met. But Bandow is concerned
with property tax relief at all costs,
and Jarvis is his cure.
Message contorted
And so the message being sent is
headed for the State legislature, and
it is being sent in the form of a ran
som note for local government. But
the message is contorted. Everyone
wants to see a reduction in expendi
tures. But Jarvis puts no limit on ex
penditures at any level,especiallythe
state level, where the majority of
waste occurs.
If local governments are forced to
rely on income and sales tax re
venues to replace local property tax
revenue, the result will bemore state
control, not less. But if increased de
pendence on state control, not oi
local control is the price for property
tax relief, I'm sure Bandow is in favor
of it.
But indeed, there is a way to in
crease taxes. The state legislature can
increase any tax except property tax,
but only with a two-thirds majority of
both houses. Local governments, on
the other hand, must have the ap
proval of two-thirds of the "qualified
electors" (usually construed to mean
"registered voters").
The majority of municipal elec
tions do not exceed 25 per cent turn
out of registered voters, which
means that even 100 per cent ap
proval would not be sufficient to pass
a tax measure. Additionally, such a
vote could not bp used to increase
property taxes beyond the Jarvis
limits.
Finally, the tax crisis has been pre
sent for some time, yet voters have
not been motivated to remove legis-

lators that do not vote for tax relief.
Why should they suddenly come out
and vote for a tax increase, no matter
how necessary?
No one can dispute that Califo
rians need property tax relief. But
Jarvis-Gann is a cure far worse than
the illness. So much chaos would re
sult that Standard Oil, who would
save $13.1 million, opposes (arvis-
Cann because the disruption of the
state's economy would not be worth
the savings.
A much more rational approach to
the problem is Proposition 8, which
would cut property taxes by 30 per
cent, double the income tax credit
for renters, increase tax relief for
senior citizens and allow residential
property to be taxed at a lower rate
than commercial property, all with

out the threat of chaos. This is a far
more fitting solution to the problem.
I suppose if I were Doug Bandow,
in Stanford Law School, I would want
my future property taxes reduced at
all costs. But perhaps the operative
statement here is "If you can keep
your head while those around you
are losing theirs, maybe you just
don't understand the situaton."
(arvis-Gann will cut taxes for cor
porations, businesses and homeow
ners alike, but it will do so at the
expense of school children, the el
derly and the poor who depend so
greatly on local government ser
vices. And that is a cost that our soci
ety cannot afford to bear.
