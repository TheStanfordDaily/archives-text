# Profits vs. human rights

In nearly all the discussion about
apartheid as it relates to Stanford's
investments, it seems that the focus
revolves around a distorted view of
the moral issue at hand. The fact is
that unfortunately the trustees can
not deal with the question of
whether or not corporate influence
in South Africa is good or bad as an
isolated moral issue.
As in many cases of real life, there
is a "moral dilemma" at hand, for
presumably, we would like to ac
complish both the good of extending
to all people of South Africa the basic
human rights now being denied
them, and the good of preserving the
University's existence as an institu
tion for pursuing knowledge and
(one would hope) truth.
Sadly, the reality is that the
achievements of these goods may be
mutually exclusive, i.e., it is possible
that there is no way of fully ac
complishing one without to some
degree compromising the other.
Life would be so much simpler if
we could deal only with one of these.
Professor Stone is probably right
when he says that economics and
politics in South Africa cannot be
separated (Daily, May 1), and while it
is very possible that, as he suggests,
the trustees either do not under
stand or do not believe this, even if
they did, their decisions about with
drawal would not therefore be made

immediately clear.
They were appointed to commit
themselves to the first good, preser
vation of the University. However, if
they concern themselves with this
good only, they then become so
cially irresponsible. Being responsi
ble in this case means taking on the
unenviable task of attempting to
maximize both goods.
Extremes illustrated
The extreme cases may illustrate
my point. If voting in favor of a certain
proxy were to cause the total
economic downfall of Stanford while
effecting only a minor improvement
for the people of South Africa, prac
tically no one would expect the trus
tees to vote for it.
Conversely, not even the most
ruthless sort of profit-monger would
be expected to make a decision that
would cause the extermination of an
entire race while bringing about only
an infinitesimal economic gain foran
academic institution.
The issues, taken to their extreme
limits, become simply black and
white and are clear to everyone.
However, the painfully complex
question, which all socially respon
sible trustees must ask themselves, is
one which will seem callous to
people who refuse to consider the
economic realities of trusteeship,
and unbusinesslike to those who
don't mind ignoring the consequ
ences of their business dealings
upon humankind.
That question is this: given a decis
ion which will cause a certain degree
of improvement for the people of
South Africa, but which will also
cause a certain incremental loss in
Stanford's economic position, hov\
great must that increment be before
it becomes unacceptable in light of
the improvement?
Unfortunately, the question is
made ever so much more complex by
the fact that seldom can any of these
quantities be known with much de
gree of certainty.
Maximize goods
With all this by way of introduc
tion, I arrive specifically at the Texaco
issue. Based on what I have said
above, it seems to me that the ap-

proach the trustees should have
taken is this:
— determine whether or not
Texaco's continued operations in
South Africa are detrimental to the
goal of its people's achieving their
rights,
— determine what the effect of
Texaco's withdrawal from South Af
rica would be upon the economic fu
ture of Stanford, and
— use the above information to
make a decision whose outcome is
most likely to maximize the ac
complishment of the two "goods" at
hand.
Up until now, it seems that discus
sion has revolved almost entirely
around the first step only. In the
Texaco case, as Professor Stone has
suggested, the trustees have appa
rently chosen to ignore or disbelieve
the thesis that economics and poli
tics cannot be separated, and to dis
regard the ClR's finding that " 'busi
ness as usual' is no longer a tolerable
situation." (Professor Hillier, Daily,
April 26).
As for the second step, Peter Bing,
in his letter to Professor Hillier and
the CIR (Daily, April 28), provided no
information on this account, but
when he said that "The board tried to
evalute withdrawal as an action
proposed for implementation by
Texaco," it sounds suspiciously like
the board was more preoccupied
with Texaco's interests than with
Stanford's. I cannot believe that
there is a direct link between the
two.
To summarize, let me first exhort
members of the Stanford community
to take a realistic look at the difficult
nature of the moral situation that is
actually involved here, and secondly
address two questions to Peter Bing
and the trustees.
Do you really believe that a corpo
ration can lend a regime its economic
support without providing some de
gree of political support? How did
you determine (or did you determine
at all) the effect that Texaco's with
drawal would have on Stanford's
economic future?
