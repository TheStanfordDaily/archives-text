# Trustees discuss investment
## 
### 
With a relatively light agenda be
fore them, the Board of Trustees de
voted much of its time yesterday to a
discussion of the South African in
vestment issue and social responsi
bility at its Los Angeles meeting.
According to Assistant to the Pres
ident for Trustee Affairs Robert
Hamrdla, the issue took 90 minutes
of the full board meeting after more
than two hours of discussion in
committee meetings yesterday and
Sunday.
Hamrdla described the discussion
as "reasoned and relatively intense"
in the sense that a good deal of mate
rial was covered and many trustees
spoke. He said, however, the discus
sion was not hostile.
The board took no action on the
issue, except issuing a letter refusing
an invitation from the Stanford
Committee for a Responsible In
vestment Policy (SCRIP) for trustees
to attend a forum on investment pol
icy held here last night.
'Accurate reflection'
Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig said last night
that the letter the trustees sent "is an
accurate reflection of what they (the
trustees) believe."
Hamrdla said he "heard no opposi
tion" to the letter as sent.
In the letter, board President Peter
Bing turned down the SCRIP invita
tion, saying "such public events do
not further genuine communication
between the board and the campus."
Bing's letter did announce that the
trustee ad hoc Subcommittee on In
vestment Responsibility would meet
with the Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR) to discuss the
trustee position on the issue.
The meeting will not be open, but
members of the student press will be
allowed to cover it, and representa
tives of various campus gioups will
be allowed to attend.
Hamrdla and Rosenzweig said the
meeting would take place some time
early next week, though no date has
been set as yet.
Both Rosenzweig and Hamrdla
said they knew of no trustees who
said they planned to attend last
night's forum held in Bishop Au
ditorium. Earlier yesterday, reports
that a few trustees had agreed to fly
here for the event circulated, but ac
cording to the administrators, no
trustees had issued such a statement.
Discussing divestment
Rosenzweig said much of the trus
tee discussion centered around in
vestment policy issues. He said drafts
of the Bing letter circulated through
out the morning but that the final
wording was not approved until 2
p.m.
The trustees acted on a number of
South Africa-related proxy issues be
tween meetings of the board
through its ad hoc subcommittee.
The subcommittee met twice bet
ween meetings by conference tele
phone call to consider two separate
sets of CIR recommendations.
The subcommittee recommenda
tions were wired to members of the
board with a request to respond to
them. Trustees here asked to inform
Bing of their opinions by a certain
date, and based on those opinions,
Bing voted the proxies.
According to Rosenzweig, the
board agreed with the CIR recom
mendations on 10 of 16 issues.
With a relatively light agenda be

voted much of its time yesterday to a
discussion of the South African in
