# Letters: trustees ignorant of situation
## 
### 
Listen to facts
This is in reply to Peter Kahn's let
ter (Daily, May 1) and to some SCRIP
statements that I think are confusing
the South Africa issue. SCRIP de
mands that the trustees "not ignore
the sentiment of the Stanford com
munity." Kahn replies that SCRIP'S
demand is "arrogant and anti
democratic": Since on ly 35 per cent
of the campus signed the SCRIP peti
tion and most people neglected to
vote on the withdrawal referendum,
Kahn argues that the trustees may
take this as a sort of mandate from
the silent majority to ignore the is
sue.
There are Some flaws in Kahn's ar
gument — e.g. the unstated premise
that abstention should count as a
vote for the status quo — but they
aren't important. Neither (except as a
tactical error) is SCRIP'S contention
that Stanford should be a democ
racy. What is important is the confu
sion of issues apparent here.
The issue is not Stanford's power
structure but South Africa's. Any
thing that distracts attention from
that real issue is counterproducive.
The CIR studied the facts about
South Africa for two months, and the
facts forced most members to re
verse their positions and favor with
drawal. Unless the trustees' values
and premises are very different from
those of the presumably impartial
CIR, we can expect that the same
facts, when faced, will force them to
the same conclusion.
If that should not happen, we will
be right to ask what the trustees' val
ues are. Protests of whatever kind we
choose should aim to make the trus
tees face the facts and their own con
sciences.
But meanwhile let's be clear about
it: The issue is not whether the trus
tees will listen to the students. It's
whether they will listen to the facts.

I am really amazed. Last week the
trustees voted "no" on a Texaco
proxy resolution that would require
that Texaco withdraw from South Af
rica. The trustees defended this vote
by pointing out that Texaco isn't par
ticularly gross in its treatment of its
black employees and that therefore it
might as well stay in South Africa.
This explanation completely mis
ses the point of all the arguments that
have been advanced since South Af
rica first became an issue last spring:
United States corporations, just by
their very presence in South Africa,
are inherently anti-progressive. They
foster apartheid by supplying essen
tial military, police and consumer
goods — essentially supporting the
South African government and in
sulating it against internal demands
for change.
Conceivably, it is possible that
American corporations could, by
exerting pressure on the govern
ment, cause the apartheid system to
recede to some extent. This is the
progressive-force argument. But in
fact, South Africa has grown more
repressive in the last 30 years as
American and other foreign in
volvement in South Africa has
grown. There is no reason to believe
that US corporations are a net prog
ressive force.
These arguments were clearly laid
out and documented in a paper pre
pared last year for a SWOPSI class.
This paper was widely disseminated
by SCRIP and copies were sent to the
trustees. Then, last fall, this paper
was expanded into an 80-page book
let "United States Investment in
South Africa" prepared by the South
Africa Catalyst Project. A copy of this
booklet was sent to each of the Trus
tees.
The University Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR), after
reviewing these documents and after
hearing testimony from expert wit
nesses and from South Africans, ac

cepted the validity of these argu
ments.The ClRdecidedthatall proxy
resolutions calling for withdrawal
should be voted "yes" unless the
corporation involved could de
monstrate that it met several strin
gent criteria. Since Texaco obviously
didn't meet these criteria, the CIR
recommended unanimously that the
trustees vote this proxy "yes."
The trustees responded by voting
"no." The explanation advanced by
Board President Peter Bing to exp
lain this vote didn't even address the
SCRIP arguments or mention the
documentation that SCRIP had pro
vided. When contacted by SCRIP
members, many of the trustees ad
mitted that they had essentially no

knowledge of the South Africa issue.
They simply went along with Texaco
management.
I really can't see that the trustees
are acting responsibly as Trustees.
They certainly haven't been respon
sive to the community. Many trus
tees even after the civil disobedience
that resulted in 294 arrests last
spring, still don't know the argu
ments advanced by SCRIP. President
Richard Lyman seems unable to con
vey to the rest of the trustees how
importan this issue is to a substantial
part of the community. When are
they going to listen?

ticularly gross in its treatment of its
black employees and that therefore it
might as well stay in South Africa.
This explanation completely mis
ses the point of all the arguments that
have been advanced since South Af
rica first became an issue last spring:
United States corporations, just by
their very presence in South Africa,
are inherently anti-progressive. They
foster apartheid by supplying essen
tial military, police and consumer
goods — essentially supporting the
South African government and in
sulating it against internal demands
for change.
Conceivably, it is possible that
American corporations could, by
exerting pressure on the govern
ment, cause the apartheid system to
recede to some extent. This is the
progressive-force argument. But in
fact, South Africa has grown more
repressive in the last 30 years as
American and other foreign in
volvement in South Africa has
grown. There is no reason to believe
that US corporations are a net prog
ressive force.
These arguments were clearly laid
out and documented in a paper pre
pared last year for a SWOPSI class.
This paper was widely disseminated
by SCRIP and copies were sent to the
trustees. Then, last fall, this paper
was expanded into an 80-page book
let "United States Investment in
South Africa" prepared by the South
Africa Catalyst Project. A copy of this
booklet was sent to each of the Trus
tees.
The University Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR), after
reviewing these documents and after
hearing testimony from expert wit
nesses and from South Africans, ac

cepted the validity of these argu
ments.The ClRdecidedthatall proxy
resolutions calling for withdrawal
should be voted "yes" unless the
corporation involved could de
monstrate that it met several strin
gent criteria. Since Texaco obviously
didn't meet these criteria, the CIR
recommended unanimously that the
trustees vote this proxy "yes."
The trustees responded by voting
"no." The explanation advanced by
Board President Peter Bing to exp
lain this vote didn't even address the
SCRIP arguments or mention the
documentation that SCRIP had pro
vided. When contacted by SCRIP
members, many of the trustees ad
mitted that they had essentially no

knowledge of the South Africa issue.
They simply went along with Texaco
management.
I really can't see that the trustees
are acting responsibly as Trustees.
They certainly haven't been respon
sive to the community. Many trus
tees even after the civil disobedience
that resulted in 294 arrests last
spring, still don't know the argu
ments advanced by SCRIP. President
Richard Lyman seems unable to con
vey to the rest of the trustees how
importan this issue is to a substantial
part of the community. When are
they going to listen?

Listen to facts
This is in reply to Peter Kahn's let
ter (Daily, May 1) and to some SCRIP
statements that I think are confusing
the South Africa issue. SCRIP de
mands that the trustees "not ignore
the sentiment of the Stanford com
munity." Kahn replies that SCRIP'S
demand is "arrogant and anti
democratic": Since on ly 35 per cent
of the campus signed the SCRIP peti
tion and most people neglected to
vote on the withdrawal referendum,
Kahn argues that the trustees may
take this as a sort of mandate from
the silent majority to ignore the is
sue.
There are Some flaws in Kahn's ar
gument — e.g. the unstated premise
that abstention should count as a
vote for the status quo — but they
aren't important. Neither (except as a
tactical error) is SCRIP'S contention
that Stanford should be a democ
racy. What is important is the confu
sion of issues apparent here.
The issue is not Stanford's power
structure but South Africa's. Any
thing that distracts attention from
that real issue is counterproducive.
The CIR studied the facts about
South Africa for two months, and the
facts forced most members to re
verse their positions and favor with
drawal. Unless the trustees' values
and premises are very different from
those of the presumably impartial
CIR, we can expect that the same
facts, when faced, will force them to
the same conclusion.
If that should not happen, we will
be right to ask what the trustees' val
ues are. Protests of whatever kind we
choose should aim to make the trus
tees face the facts and their own con
sciences.
But meanwhile let's be clear about
it: The issue is not whether the trus
tees will listen to the students. It's
whether they will listen to the facts.

I am really amazed. Last week the
trustees voted "no" on a Texaco
proxy resolution that would require
that Texaco withdraw from South Af
rica. The trustees defended this vote
by pointing out that Texaco isn't par
ticularly gross in its treatment of its
black employees and that therefore it
might as well stay in South Africa.
