# Police starting campus bicycle patrol
## 
### Kathy Andrews 
Campus police began to
issue warnings and citations to
bicycle and moped riders for
violations of the state vehicle
code on a regular basis early
last week, according to Dept.
of Public Safety Captain Walter
Konar.
Pairs of uniformed officers
are riding bicycles themselves
while on patrol, Konar said.
"When riding bicycles, of
ficers can set a good example
by observing the vehicle code
and can also move more effec
tively to enforce it," Konar
explained.
The enforcement measure is
one feature of a campaign by
the Subcommittee on Bicycle
Safety of the University's Ad
ministrative Panel on Health
and Safety.
"A crescendo of increased
reports of injuries, complaints
and claims against the Univer
sity motivated us to institute
the program," said Robert
Beth, University risk manage
ment and insurance director.
"Past enforcement programs

have been conducted on a
one- to two-week blitz basis.
This program will be different
since it will occur at random
times and places," Beth stated.
"We will be cracking down
particularly on motorcycles
and mopeds in White Plaza,
the Quad and other pedestrian
mall areas," Konar said.
Although mopeds can not be
driven through these areas,
they may be pedaled, Konar
added.
Violators will also be cited
for running stop signs, having
inadequate safety equipment
or unlicensed vehicles or for
other infractions.
The issuance of warnings
and citations will be left to each
officer's discretion. All vio
lators will receive a bike safety
booklet, Konar said.
According to Konar, the en
forcement measures will not
cause the community to suffer
a serious slowdown in other
police services.
Since most calls come from
the central campus area, cycl
ing police will now be able to
respond to them as quickly as
they had from patrol cars,
Konar explained.
"People who have had acci
dents before are usually the
most conscientious about bike
safety and maintenance. We
hope that the enforcement
program will provide another
way to make people believ
ers," said Beth.
The subcommittee is also
studying the general traffic
situation with a view to en
gineering better bike flow pat
terns.
Student coordinators Rob
White and Meg Smollen col
lected data from Cowell, the
Department of Public Safety

and other sources to compile a
list of areas where bicycle acci
dents most frequently occur.
The three most hazardous
spots are White Plaza, Lomita
Mall (including the Biological
Sciences vicinity) and Serra
Street and Campus Drive,
White said.
But according to Health and
Safety Specialist Hal Wilson,
the subcommittee's data pro
vides a limited insight into the
situation.
"We estimate that around 10
per cent of all accidents are re
ported. You just never hear
about the minor run-ins and
near misses," Wilson
explained.
"We're still in the elemen
tary planning stage," Beth said.
"So far our engineering

plans include the installation of
signs, directional graphics for
pavements and improved bike
paths. We also want to reduce
the number of barriers," he
continued.
Beth said he expects some of
these ideas to be implemented
through the Facilities Planning
Office during fall quarter.
The subcommittee is also
concerned with making bicycle
safety equipment more availa
ble to the University commun
ity. The Bookstore and the
Bicycle Shop will be encour
aged to stock bicycle lights,
bells and reflectors.
"Our funding will come out
of general funds and possibly
from parking fees. I estimate
that the program will cost
around $10,000," Beth said.
