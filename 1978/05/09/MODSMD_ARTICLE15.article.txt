# Moderates take Cal student offices

### 
Berkeley (AP) â€” Lindsay Spil
ler, who described himself as a
"Republican at heart," has
been elected to an office held
for the past 15 years on a cam
pus where college radicalism
of the '60s began.
He is the president-elect of
the 29,000-member student
body of the University of
California at Berkeley, where
the Free Speech Movement
and its left-leaning spinoffs
were born.
Spiller, 21, who used to toot
a horn on street corners with a
Salvation Army band, was the
candidate of a group of campus
moderates who formed six
weeks prior to the election and
called themselves the Com

mon Sense Party.
They pledged cooperation
with the university's administ
ration, a virtually unthinkable
campaign platform for previ
ous winners.
"I think the majority of stu
dents are willing to work with
instead of against the univer
sity."
However, he cautioned the
administration not to think of
him as a patsy.
"Now it rests with the uni
versity," he said. "They now
have a student government
they can work with. It'stimefor
them to come through on such
issues as divestiture of stocks
in South Africa and reform of
the tenure svstem."
