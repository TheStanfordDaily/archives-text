## art/katherine draznin James McNeill Whistler: he etches music in black and white 
### 
The first major West Coast exhibit of Whis
tler's work is now on display at the Stanford
Museum. The show, made up of etchings,
small oil and pastel sketches and other
works by the artist, provides a rich source of
information on what might too easily be
dismissed as a minor aspect of a painter's
oeuvre.
Whistler, popularly but woefully misrep
resented as simply the painter of that Ameri
can icon, "Whistler's Mother," was a color
ful and controversial figure in his day. He
was an American by birth, a Londoner by
residence, and, according to a contempor
ary, a Parisian by taste. Not unexpectedly,
his cosmopolitan nature has been the bain
of those historians who wish to claim his
work as representative of their nation's cul
ture.
Mapmaker
Born in Lowell, Massachusetts in 1834,
Whistler was trained as an etcher,and, after a
brief stint at West Point, by the U.S. Coast
Geodetic Survey in the technique of map
making. Having traveled abroad with his
family, he determined to become an artist,
and set out for Paris in 1855, where he
studied for the next five years. He then re
turned to London, where he worked most of
his life.
Whistler was among a group of painters

and printmakers who revived interest in and
expanded the expressive range of etching, a
technique that had fallen into disuse with
the introduction of lithography and photo
graphy as reproductive media.
Obvious link
Tonality is, of course, the obvious link be
tween musical composition and black and
white prints. But it was a quite conscious link
in Whistler's case. In an era when Realists
and Impressionists were painting, this artist
took a classicist's attitude, creating "impres
sions" of reality based on selection and re
finement of his experiences.
Almost all of his major paintings and
works were titled in the manner of musical
compositions, substituting color for key,
such as "Arrangement in Gray and Black,"
the correct title for the portrait of his
mother.
Favorite subjects
The show traces a number of sources for
the artist's imagery. He returned to favorite
subjects throughout his career — river
fronts, canals, bridges, shop fronts and
workshops. The Dutch masters, especially
Rembrandt, English landscapists, and pain
ters of the French Barbizon school had direct
bearing upon the artist's selection of subject
and its treatment.
Nonetheless, Whistler introduced many

important innovations, particularly in the
bold variation in the preparation and inking
of his etching plates. He drew directly onto
the plate, rather than copying a sketch.
Sometimes he brushed acid onto the plate
with a feather. His line is typically feather
thin, but always decisive and bold, never
tentative.
Clean plates
These experiments continued for more
than 40 years, carried on in conjunction with
his painting. At first, Whistler's plates were
"wiped" clean in the manner of professional
printing; then he began to wipe them par
tially, leaving films of ink for dark tones. In
his late work, complex webs of lines created
the same chiaroscuro as the partially cleaned
plates, but were inked and wiped in the trad
itional manner.
Tonal variations in the ink were only one
aspect of the "musicality" of his work. Most
important, perhaps most difficult to ap
preciate without a grasp of the historical
context in which these prints were made,
was his ability to create the illusion of light,
water, cloth and stone, of material reality,
with minimal amount of line. As in the
Japanese ink drawings that were popular
among Whistler's circle, reality was evoked
by a few bold strokes or lines, not a clutter of
detail. The white paper was an active high

light, not simply the suppoit for the image.
To create the illusion of reality is much
moredifficultthan his prints reveal. Whistler
felt that a finished piece was one where "all
trace of the means used to bring about the
end has disappeared." Part of the success of
these works was the forceful manner of his
composition. Perhaps the key lies in his
"seizing upon the chief point of interest"
from which he would elaborate.
But the recurrent musical quality of his
work has not been completely explained.
Ironically, one must take apart the visual
elements of a Whistler print in order to un
derstand how simple yet strikingly complete
it is. If one segregates the horizontal and
vertical accents, the deep blacks, middle
grays and whites, these highly coherent
sketches suddenly look like fragments or
patterns reminiscent of chords of musical
notes. Where black predominates, a sombre
bass vibration occurs. In other prints, espe
cially the brilliant Venetian scenes, there is a
high-pitched but delicate quality.
A 'textural experience'
Subtle, almost imperceptible variations in
line, present a rich textural experience for
the viewer. Even excluding the emotional
contribution of the specific subject to our
experience of his work, it is clear that Whis
tler was a master of his craft. In many ways,

his subjects were simply an excuse for a vir
tuoso performance in line and tone.
The exhibit includes booklets that the ar
tist published as catalogues of his work, fil
led with disparaging comments by art critics
who took him to task for almost everything
we find compelling and exciting in his work.
One wrote that "form and line are of little
account to him," another that he was "push
ing a single artistic principle to the verge of
affectation." Ironically, Whistler may have
taken one comment as praise, despite its
inaccuracy: "Whistler does not take much
pains with his work."
The artist has the last word in this exhibit,
however. He wrote, "the masterpiece
should appear as the flower to the painter —
perfect in its bud as in its bloom — with no
reason to explain its presence — no mission
to fulfill — a joy to the artist — a delusion to
the philanthropist, a puzzle to the botanist,
an accident of sentiment and alliteration to
the literary man."
The show, accompanied by an informative
and beautifully designed catalogue, will re
main at the Museum through June 18. Spe
cial docent tours of the exhibit will be con
ducted Thursdays at 12:15 p.m. and on
weekends at 2 p.m. Museum hours are
weekdays except Monday, 10 to 4:45,
weekends 1 to 4:45.
