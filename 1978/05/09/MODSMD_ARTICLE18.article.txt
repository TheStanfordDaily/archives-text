# THE
						ROOKY HORROR SHOW
## 
### 
While you may still be humming "Gary, In
diana, Gary, Indiana, Gary, Indiana," to your
self, Toyon's corridors are reverberating with
music from"The Rocky Horror Show." The star
of the show, Rick Jimenez, practices strutting up
and down a ramp while wearing four-inch heels
and black fish-net stockings. He still hasn't told
the folks back home about his role. And the
female lead, Ann Jennings, clad only in under
wear for most of the play, is glad her family lives
in Arkansas.
Producer Doug Greenfield admits he coerced
several members of the cast to audition. One
might expect the cast to consist entirely of cult
fans but many of the leads had never heard of
"The Rocky Horror Show" or "The Rocky Horror
Picture Show" until they auditioned. (The play
originated in London about five years ago and
the movie followed soon afterward.) Even the
director, Marvin Diogenes, was recruited.
Diogenes didn't like the movie when he first
saw it, but soon afterward he realized its poten
tial as a stage production. "The show addresses,
well, actually, undresses itself to a college audi
ence," he said. After all, it's one thing to view a
film and quite another to be confronted by a
rock musical replete with aliens, transvestites
and combinations thereof.
Straining music
"The music is rock and the necessity to
amplify it puts an extra strain on the signers,"
said Diogenes. "And another thing is that the
show is blatantly sexual. A lot of shows are quiet
about sex. American comedy treats sex behind

closed doors." |
Of course, the actors are still nervous about
some of the more intimate scenes in the play. At
the same time, they enjoy the attention they
draw as they wait through the Toyon lobby in
black speedos, lime green eye-shadow and pink
plastic pearls. They are also enthusiastic about a
few alterations they've made in the show.
And how will the old Rocky Horror fans feel
about the changes? Diogenes believes that
"members of a cult have a static conception of
the play and I would hope that even the cult
members, along with those who've never seen
the show before, will get something out of it."
Transylvanian maid
According to Risa Shimoda, who play? a
"domestic" in the Transylvanian castle "the cult
fans have developed a sub-script (for the pj&y)
. . . and this production is geared to expecjt au
dience participation."
As for those unfamiliar with the rock musical,
it's a parody of late-night horror movies, the
lead is a transexual, transvestite Frankemurter,
not Frankenstein. A nice, young, American
couple, Brad and )anet, stumble into his castle
the night that he creates his monster, Rocky
Horror. The rest is... too complicated to exp
lain here.
If you want to see the play that brought you
songs like "Sweet Transvestite," "Time Warp"
and "Toucha-Toucha-Toucha Touch Me,"

just another law student by day
light, but at night she becomes

ginning Thursday night.


The photographer shook his
head, smiled sardonically, then
said, "now try to seduce the
camera." Clockwise from center
