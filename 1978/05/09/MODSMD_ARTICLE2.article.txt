# 100 sit in at Old Union, leave to avoid arrest
## 
### Joel Dickholtz 
About 100 students occupying Old
Union voted to leave the building be
fore closing time to avoid arrest yes
terday.
The students ended a four-hour
sit-in which began at a noon rally in
White Plaza.
About 325 persons attended the
noon rally. The protesters agreed to
make a "massive effort" to encour
age public attendance at a "teach-in"
or educational forum on South Africa
last night.
Stanford Committee for a Respon
sible Investment Policy (SCRIP)
spokesperson Maggie Goud said that
following a planned all-night vigil,
"there will probably be some type of
action at Lyman's office (this morn
ing) but that's up in the air."
Organized by SCRIP
The protest, organized by SCRIP,
occurred almost one year to the day
after the Old Union sit-in in which
294 students were arrested last May
9.
Students "sitting in" yesterday

demanded that the Board of Trustees
come to campus for an educational
forum on South African investments.
The trustees were at a monthly meet
ing in Los Angeles.
The protesters also demanded that
the trustees adopt a policy of corpo
rate withdrawal from South Africa.
The trustees responded with a let
ter addressed to SCRIP from Board of
Trustees' President Peter Bing. The
letter said the trustees would not at
tend the forum, stating "such public
events do not further genuine com
munication between the board and
the campus."
The trustees did, however, invite
the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CIR) to meet with the
trustee ad hoc Subcommittee on In
vestment Responsibility "to review
this year's work, to discuss areas of
agreement and disagreement, and to
consider what improvements can be
made to facilitate exchange of views
between the two groups."
The reading of the trustees' letter
was met with boos and hisses by the
students occupying Old Union. After
the letter was read, several speakers
called for "more militant action."

Following an early morning
meeting, SCRIP has decided to "take
action" today.

A few protesters, in response to
the trustee action, favored what
SCRIP member Chris Gray called
"putting our bodies on the line to
build a mass movement" and "get
ting arrested not once, not twice, but
time and time again."
However, a large portion of the
group was strongly opposed to the
idea of attempting a repeat of last
year.
"There's nothing the trustees
would like to see more than just 50
people arrested so they can say
'ha-ha — there were 300 people ar
rested last year,' " said Grant
Lichtman, one of the many speakers.
Militant action
Leon Orr, another speaker, then
added "what many people consider
militant action is getting arrested and
going to jail. I don't consider that
militant action, I consider that
foolish."
Orr suggested the group utilize
"more long lasting means of force,
such as non-payment of tuition and
unfulfilled promised senior dona
tions, to pressure the University.
The group's alternatives were
eventually narrowed to three: active
disruption by the whole group,
probably resulting in mass arrests;
disruption by a small number of stu
dents, resulting in a few arrests; or
exit from the union before 5 p.m. to
avoid arrest, and make a massive ef
fort to encourage public attendance
at last night's educational forum.
When the vote was finally taken at
4:35, the first two proposals received
almost no backing. The third was
overwhelmingly chosen as the
course of action.
SCRIP spokesperson Kim McCall
later said "considering the low
turn-out at the sit-in" and the "re
markable apathy" on campus, the
group made the best decision it
could have made.
About 175 persons attended last
night's educational forum.


About 100 students occupied Old Union yesterday after a
noon rally protesting the actions of the Trustees. The Stan-

ford Committee for a Responsible Investment Policy held an
educational forum last night on South African investments.
Wagner said the original purpose
of the forum was "to inform trustees
of what SCRIP wanted presented to
the CIR."
SCRIP member Chris Coleman
said the "purpose is to bring forward
an analysis of where we are at today
in light of the trustees' action."
Speakers at the forum included
Jean Hendrickse, a South African
blacklisted by the South African gov
ernment.
Hendrickse called forthe Universi
ty's withdrawal from South Africa,

saying "Now is the time for you to
withdraw your investment from
companies that murder our chil
dren."
Also speaking was Lewis Cann, a
senior fellow at Hoover Institution.
Gann spoke for the trustee position.
Following the forum, SCRIP plan
ned a 10 p.m. rally last night. At that
time, Wagner said SCRIP members
planned to decide on what, if any
action, would be taken this morning.
Plans for this morning were un
known at the Daily's press time last
night.
