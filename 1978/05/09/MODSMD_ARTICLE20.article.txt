No fatalities reported in 727 crash
Pensacola, Fla. — A National Airlines 727 carrying 60
persons crashed off the Florida coast while coming in for
a landing last night, but remained afloat while dozens of
boats pulled survivors out cf the wreckage, authorities
said.
The Federal Aviation Administration, the Coast Guard
and the Pensacola County Medical Examiner said they
knew of no fatalities.
The downed jet was tied to a barge about two miles
from land in Escambia Bay near Pensacola, authorities
said. . „
"People are being loaded onto the boats right now,
said a Coast Guard spokesman. "We don't have a
number but we understand there are a lot.'

Corona to get new murder trial
San Francisco — Juan Corona, convicted of the
machete murders of 25 farm workers, will get a new trial
because his lawyer made a "farce and mockery of his
defense and was too interested in cashing in on a book
about the case, an appeals court ruled yesterday.
In a blistering decision, the three-member state Court
of Appeal agreed with Corona's contention that his
former lawyer, Richard Hawk, failed to provide an
adequate defense and had a conflict of interest.
However, the appeal court also said the evidence of
Corona's guilt was "overwhelming.''
Hawk failed to claim mental incompetency for
Corona, was unable to render undivided loyalty, and
was considering "his own pocketbook' while making a
defense for the accused, the court held.
"There was a great wealth of evidence in Hawk's pos
session or at his disposal . . . that unerringly indicated
that Corona was suffering from renewed psychosis,
schizophrenia and paranoia," the unanimous ruling
said.
Berkowitz pleads guilty to slaying
New York — Without the slightest outward flicker of
emotion, David Berkowitz pleaded guilty yesterday to
the six random ,44-caliber killings committed during a
year-long reign of terror as the furtive Son of Sam.

"I'm an excellent shot," Berkowitz said quietly at one
stage in a unique interrogation by three different judges,
At another point, the 24-year-old Berkowitz coolly de
tailed the slaying of 18-year-old Donna Lauria of the
Bronx, the first of his six victims.
Berkowitz faces a maximum of 25 years to life in prison
for each of the six slayings and a maximum of 25 years in
prison for the attempted murder of seven victims who
escaped with injuries. Sentencing was set for May 22 on
all counts.
Textron destroyed bribe evidence
Washington — Textron Inc. said yesterday evidence
showing that a sales agent for Textron's helicopters had
paid a $300,000 kickback to sell helicopters in Ghana was
destroyed the day after C. William Miller was asked
about the transaction at his Senate hearings to be Fed
eral Reserve chairman.
Textron, the parent corporation of Bell Helicopter,
made the disclosure in a document filed with the Sec
urities and Exchange Commission. Miller is former
chairman of Textron.
Textron's SEC filing said there is "no indication" that
Textron officers including Miller knew that a bribe had
been demanded by a high Ghanaian military official or
that funds had been made available to pay it.
However, Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.), chairman
of the Senate Banking Committee, called on the De
partment of Justice to determine where the destruction
of an internal Bell memo "constitutes the basis for crim
inal prosecution."
More jet sales to Israel urged

under discussion.
Kissinger appeared before the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee, which decided to delay until yesterday
a planned closed session for further discussion of the
administration plan to sell fighters to Israel, Egypt and
Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabian oil minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani said his
country does not see a direct linkage between Saudi oil
sales and the purchase of the U.S. fighters. But he said it
would be "naive" to think that a rejection of one would
not affect the other.

Corona to get new murder trial
San Francisco — Juan Corona, convicted of the
machete murders of 25 farm workers, will get a new trial
because his lawyer made a "farce and mockery of his
defense and was too interested in cashing in on a book
about the case, an appeals court ruled yesterday.
In a blistering decision, the three-member state Court
of Appeal agreed with Corona's contention that his
former lawyer, Richard Hawk, failed to provide an
adequate defense and had a conflict of interest.
However, the appeal court also said the evidence of
Corona's guilt was "overwhelming.''
Hawk failed to claim mental incompetency for
Corona, was unable to render undivided loyalty, and
was considering "his own pocketbook' while making a
defense for the accused, the court held.
"There was a great wealth of evidence in Hawk's pos
session or at his disposal . . . that unerringly indicated
that Corona was suffering from renewed psychosis,
schizophrenia and paranoia," the unanimous ruling
said.
Berkowitz pleads guilty to slaying
New York — Without the slightest outward flicker of
emotion, David Berkowitz pleaded guilty yesterday to
the six random ,44-caliber killings committed during a
year-long reign of terror as the furtive Son of Sam.

"I'm an excellent shot," Berkowitz said quietly at one
stage in a unique interrogation by three different judges,
At another point, the 24-year-old Berkowitz coolly de
tailed the slaying of 18-year-old Donna Lauria of the
Bronx, the first of his six victims.
Berkowitz faces a maximum of 25 years to life in prison
for each of the six slayings and a maximum of 25 years in
prison for the attempted murder of seven victims who
escaped with injuries. Sentencing was set for May 22 on
all counts.
Textron destroyed bribe evidence
Washington — Textron Inc. said yesterday evidence
showing that a sales agent for Textron's helicopters had
paid a $300,000 kickback to sell helicopters in Ghana was
destroyed the day after C. William Miller was asked
about the transaction at his Senate hearings to be Fed
eral Reserve chairman.
Textron, the parent corporation of Bell Helicopter,
made the disclosure in a document filed with the Sec
urities and Exchange Commission. Miller is former
chairman of Textron.
Textron's SEC filing said there is "no indication" that
Textron officers including Miller knew that a bribe had
been demanded by a high Ghanaian military official or
that funds had been made available to pay it.
However, Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.), chairman
of the Senate Banking Committee, called on the De
partment of Justice to determine where the destruction
of an internal Bell memo "constitutes the basis for crim
inal prosecution."
More jet sales to Israel urged
Washington — Former Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer urged yesterday that the administration increase
sales to Israel in its Mideast jet fighter package amid
growing signs that a compromise along that line was
under discussion.
Kissinger appeared before the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee, which decided to delay until yesterday
a planned closed session for further discussion of the
administration plan to sell fighters to Israel, Egypt and
Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabian oil minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani said his
country does not see a direct linkage between Saudi oil
sales and the purchase of the U.S. fighters. But he said it
would be "naive" to think that a rejection of one would
not affect the other.

Winds wash oil onto English coast
Great Yarmouth, England — A sudden change of winds
in the treacherous North Sea washed thick black blobs
of heavy fuel oil from a wrecked Greek tanker across the
sandy, white beaches of England's most popular coastal
resort yesterday.
Local residents scurried to clean up the patches of oil
that had smeared up to 25 feet across the beaches. Tug
boats sprayed chemicals up and down the coastline to
disperse the oil, while bulldozers scooped up the

colliding with the French ore carrier Roseline six miles
off the foggy coast. No crew member was hurt.
