Court denies rehearing
The Third District Court of Appeals
has ruled against the University's pet
ition for a rehearing on a claim for
$448,000 of state money.
The University will appeal to the
state Supreme Court, according to
University counsel John Schwartz.
The appeals court ruled April 10
that state capitation grants based on
percapita enrollment in private med
ical schools violate the California
constitution. The refusal to rehear
the matter came last Wednesday.
The April ruling struck down the
state Scholarship and Loan Commis
sion program, set up by the legisla
ture for the purpose of increasing the
number of physicians in California.
The original suit was filed by the
University against the state treasurer
and controller to collect $448,000 in
support because the Medical School
increased its enrollment.
The state controller argued that
the constitution bans state support
to schools with church ties or to any
school not under exclusive state con
trol. The University countered that
contracts serving "important public
purposes" were not "support"
under the terms of the constitution.
