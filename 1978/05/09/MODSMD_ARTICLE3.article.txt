section of a two-part profile on the
organizations on the ballot for fee as
sessments.)
Tomorrow and Thursday a special
election will be held on eight prop
osed fee assessments which were
not approved in the last election due
to insufficient voter turnout.
Students will vote on the ASSU
Program Fee and on fee assessments
for the Guest Professorship Board,
Academic Organizations Board,
Graduate Students Association, Pub
lications Board, Speakers Bureau,
Legal Counseling, and Stanford
Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE).
The ASSU Program Fee would be a
$1 per student fee assessment in
both fall and winter quarters. Ac
cording to ASSU Chairperson Fred
Grethel, the fee assessment was de
signed to go to "campus organiza
tions that needed funding but we
ren't large enough to garner the sup
port for their own fee assessments."
The assessment would help sup
port about 30 organizations, includ
ing the Black Student Union, China
Study Group and Half the Sky.
Increase fee
The senate recommended increas
ing the ASSU Program fee from $1 to
$2 per student per year "because of
the proliferation of organizations
who need funding and because of
the restricted fund sources," Grethel
said.
"Without this money, most of the
groups will be in serious financial
trouble since they get most or all of
their funding from the fee assess
ment," he added.
If passed, the $1 Academic Organi
zations Board (AOB) fee assessment
will go to "academic, departmental
and pre-professional organizations
like American Studies, Stanford-in-
Government, Black Pre-Medical Soc
iety and the Economics, History and
Political Science undergraduate as
sociations," said AOB Chairperson
Regina Petty.
"Another purpose of the AOB is to

help initiate organizations which
don't currently exist but which
should," she added.
While the AOB is not the only
source of funds for these organiza
tions, said Petty, "it would be impos
sible for some of the organizations to
carry out extensive programming
without the fee assessment."
ASSU Co-president Greg Larson, a
member of the Graduate Students
Association (GSA), said the GSA fee
assessment would enable that or
ganization to start a graduate student
orientation similar in function to
freshman orientation.
Grad students
The money would also be used to
finance a grad students' newsletter,

campus lounge and social functions,
he said.
"A $1 per student fee would bring
in about $10,000. The GSA needs only
$5000 to operate for one year. So the
fee assessment this next fall would
be used for two years," Larson said.
Larson said he hoped this fee as
sessment will be the only one neces
sary. He said in the next few years the
GSA will seek funds for orientation
similar to those given to freshmen
orientation.
Larson said President Richard
Lyman has not yet approved or re
jected the proposed ASSU Senate
constitutional amendment passed
last month that would allow only
graduate students to vote on such an

assessment in the future.
If the amendment is passed, the
proposed CSA fee would be asses
sed only on graduate students, said
Larson.
The Guest Professorship Board is
seeking a $1 fee assessment for fall
quarter. According to board member
Beth Kerttula, the money would be
used to sponsor guest professors,
films and public events such as the
minority women's night held during
SOC Disorientation Week.
"We try to bring to campus people
who will give students alternate vie
wpoints, from the left and the right,"
she said. If the Guest Professorship
Board does not get the money, "it
goes out of existence," she added.
