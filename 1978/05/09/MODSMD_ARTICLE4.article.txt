# Extent of problem unknown
## Concern over rape increases 
### Robert Mauro News analysis 
In recent months concern over rape has increased
both here and in the surrounding community. Numer
ous seminars and discussions on rape have been held.
Charges of insensitivity on the part of the police and the
news media continue to be levied.
Despite continued publicity and the number of victim
assistance programs, the actual extent of the problem
remains a mystery.
The apparent confusion arises partially from a healthy
mistrust of official police statistics and partially from
misconceptions about what constitutes a forcible rape.
Two rapes were reported in the Stanford Department
of Public Safety in 1976. According to Investigations
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, one rape and three attempts
were reported in 1977.
Palo Alto Police Lt. Chuck Hauser reports that 14 rapes
occurred in the 1976-77 fiscal year in that city. He also
noted that a slight increase in the number of rapes re
ported had occurred so far this fiscal year.
According to Niemeyer, "This is probably not all that
occurred, only those officially reported." For instance,
"many victims here may be counseled at Cowell (Stu
dent Health Services Center) and other places and not
report the rape."
Unfortunately, few local medical and psychological
centers keep records of the number of crime victims
seen for treatment.
After consulting with their staffs, Gene Phillips, As

sociate Director of Student Health Services and David
Dorosin, Director of Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices report that three women had been seen by their
(Cowell) staffs in connection with a sexual assault.
According to Dorosin, "We saw one student's spouse
who lived off campus and two women on campus where
there was an actual sexual attack." Phillips added that at
least two of these women eventually reported the crime
to police.
Dorosin said "We generally urge people to report
these crimes to the police; it's a situation where nothing
is likely to be done if it isn't reported."
According to Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Leah
Kaplan, a member of the ASSU Task Force on Rape,
"We've had calls of near misses... and at least two
student rapes."
According to William Snyder of the Medical Center
News Bureau, 43 persons have been treated in the last 15
months at the hospital in connection with sexual as
saults. However, hospital patients come from through
out the bay area.
Not all local hospitals and clinics keep such efficient
records. Jane Torres, Administrative Secretary at the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic said the clinic does not keep any
record of treated crime victims. The clinic does not re
port sexual assaults to the police, she added.
Spokespersons for both Sequoia Hospital and El
Camino Hospital stated that all cases of sexual assaults
known to their staff are reported to the police whether
the victim desires it or not.
Fewer reported rapes appear to have occurred here
than in the surrounding areas even when size and popu
lation factors are taken into account. Rape is less of a
problem here than at UC-Berkeley, where seven rapes
were reported in 1976.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that at
most 30 per cent of the rapes committed in the United
States are ever reported. According to FBI statistics,
57,730 rapes were reported in 1976. This means 52 out of
every 100,000 women were reported rape victims.
However, more rapes are committed in urban areas
than in the suburbs, and more occur in the western
states.
According to the FBI, 41 per cent of the total number

of rapes reported to the police occurred in large cities
with more than 250,000 inhabitants. Thus, in large cities,
61 out of every 100,000 women were rape victims com
pared to 26 of every 100,000 women in the suburbs. For
the western states as a whole, however, there were 76
rape victims for every 100,000 women.
According to Santa Clara County Sheriff's Investiga
tions Sgt. Ken Bush, assigned to the sex crime unit,
"There's no real problem right on the (Stanford) cam
pus, but rather off campus in the community . . . the
concern comes from off campus. In East Palo for in
stance, there is a problem."
The number of rapes reported in 1976 in the local area
were: Stanford, 2; Palo Alto, 18; Menlo Park, 7; Moun
tain View, 13; San Mateo, 14; Redwood City, 27; Los
Altos, 3; Santa Clara, 34; San Jose, 2%; and San Fran
cisco, 619.

The apparent confusion arises partially from a healthy
mistrust of official police statistics and partially from
misconceptions about what constitutes a forcible rape.
Two rapes were reported in the Stanford Department
of Public Safety in 1976. According to Investigations
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, one rape and three attempts
were reported in 1977.
Palo Alto Police Lt. Chuck Hauser reports that 14 rapes
occurred in the 1976-77 fiscal year in that city. He also
noted that a slight increase in the number of rapes re
ported had occurred so far this fiscal year.
According to Niemeyer, "This is probably not all that
occurred, only those officially reported." For instance,
"many victims here may be counseled at Cowell (Stu
dent Health Services Center) and other places and not
report the rape."
Unfortunately, few local medical and psychological
centers keep records of the number of crime victims
seen for treatment.
After consulting with their staffs, Gene Phillips, As

sociate Director of Student Health Services and David
Dorosin, Director of Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices report that three women had been seen by their
(Cowell) staffs in connection with a sexual assault.
According to Dorosin, "We saw one student's spouse
who lived off campus and two women on campus where
there was an actual sexual attack." Phillips added that at
least two of these women eventually reported the crime
to police.
Dorosin said "We generally urge people to report
these crimes to the police; it's a situation where nothing
is likely to be done if it isn't reported."
According to Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Leah
Kaplan, a member of the ASSU Task Force on Rape,
"We've had calls of near misses... and at least two
student rapes."
According to William Snyder of the Medical Center
News Bureau, 43 persons have been treated in the last 15
months at the hospital in connection with sexual as
saults. However, hospital patients come from through
out the bay area.
Not all local hospitals and clinics keep such efficient
records. Jane Torres, Administrative Secretary at the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic said the clinic does not keep any
record of treated crime victims. The clinic does not re
port sexual assaults to the police, she added.
Spokespersons for both Sequoia Hospital and El
Camino Hospital stated that all cases of sexual assaults
known to their staff are reported to the police whether
the victim desires it or not.
Fewer reported rapes appear to have occurred here
than in the surrounding areas even when size and popu
lation factors are taken into account. Rape is less of a
problem here than at UC-Berkeley, where seven rapes
were reported in 1976.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that at
most 30 per cent of the rapes committed in the United
States are ever reported. According to FBI statistics,
57,730 rapes were reported in 1976. This means 52 out of
every 100,000 women were reported rape victims.
However, more rapes are committed in urban areas
than in the suburbs, and more occur in the western
states.
According to the FBI, 41 per cent of the total number

of rapes reported to the police occurred in large cities
with more than 250,000 inhabitants. Thus, in large cities,
61 out of every 100,000 women were rape victims com
pared to 26 of every 100,000 women in the suburbs. For
the western states as a whole, however, there were 76
rape victims for every 100,000 women.
According to Santa Clara County Sheriff's Investiga
tions Sgt. Ken Bush, assigned to the sex crime unit,
"There's no real problem right on the (Stanford) cam
pus, but rather off campus in the community . . . the
concern comes from off campus. In East Palo for in
stance, there is a problem."
The number of rapes reported in 1976 in the local area
were: Stanford, 2; Palo Alto, 18; Menlo Park, 7; Moun
tain View, 13; San Mateo, 14; Redwood City, 27; Los
Altos, 3; Santa Clara, 34; San Jose, 2%; and San Fran
cisco, 619.
