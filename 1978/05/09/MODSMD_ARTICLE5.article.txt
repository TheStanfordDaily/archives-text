# Elie Wiesel holds some hope for the future
## 
### Jonathan Slater News analysis 
It has been 30 years since the Holocaust,
since the massacre of six million Jews, since
Elie Wiesel lost his family at the hands of the
Nazis.
Today the Nazis are still around.
So is Wiesel.
Unlike many other concentration camp
survivors who have given in to despair,
Wiesel retains some hope for the future.
Wiesel, a professor, said "occasionally I
have good students, a good response from
a student, small rewards and small mira
cles."
But he added, "I am afraid. We are going
through a difficult phase of history, it's not a
sunny episode."
He said he felt the situation in the world
today is not inducive to hope.
"There is something in civilization now
which is wrong. You feel it, you feel the
crisis. Too many movements fail, too many
hopes are broken," he added.
The '60s
Wiesel contrasted today with the '60s
when "there was a youth rebellion all over
the world."
He said people at that time "believed in
sacred missions to change life and change
men — something beautiful."
Wiesel said he recognizes "a simple res
ignation among the students" today.
"Today again they want credits and
grades. They are credit conscious, then

they were ideal conscious. Then they were
saying 'to hell with grades, we want some
thing True — capital T,' " he said.
If Wiesel sees a bright spot anywhere in
the world today, it comes from Israel. "In
Israel I am much more hopeful than any
where else," he said.
"I am curiously hopeful. I think that we'll
have peace this year, meaning first with
Egypt and then with Jordan — something
separate," he added.
Wiesel was here for a Holocaust Day
speech last Thursday, sponsored by the
Jewish Cultural Arts Center and the Anti-
Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
He spoke on several aspects of the
Holocaust before a packed house in Memo
rial Auditorium.
One subject with which Wiesel had par
ticular difficulty understanding was Cod's
apparent indifference to the atrocities
committed by the Nazis.
It is perhaps this inability to sit aside and
let God control things which has prompted
Wiesel to be so active.
He holds a chair at Boston University and
has written 17 books, three of which are on
the subject of the Holocaust.
The reason so few of his books deal with
the Holocaust is because Wiesel feels the
subject is "sacred" and fears that "if you
speak too much, the words may be desac
ralized."
"There are certain words you cannot
misuse, you should not misuse," he added.

Much of his objection to the television
program, "Holocaust," is because "they
took a word, Holocaust, which was exclu
sively used to describe a certain Jewish ex
perience, and now it became a household
word."
"From now on," he said, "when we speak
of Holocaust we will have to qualify it: 'do I
mean the program or the event.' Nobody
had the right to do that. Nobody. To present
it as the story of the Holocaust. Nobody."
"I was critical of the program. It could
have been an important contribution, but

because of the way it was treated, it was less
important," he said.
He added that it did not meet his expecta
tions, largely because of a "total disrespect
for the subject matter and historical inac
curacies which are too many to ennumer
ate.
"It was wrong. The main thing was it did
not give the real picture oranything close to
it — of what used to be an experience."
Intentions good
He said that he felt the intentions of the
producers were probably good in the be
ginning, but added "you cannot create a
picture where half of the characters are true
and others are invented, because in the end
we don't know who is who and what is
what."
As a result he thought that the program's
effect was limited.
"Short range reactions were good, mean
ing that many, many people who surpris
ingly didn't know anything until now, now
do know," said Wiesel.
Yet he countered, "because of the super
ficiality of the production, I think the re
sponse too is a superficial response and that
it will be forgotten within a couple of
years."
In the end, Wiesel fears that "the prog
ram may have done more damage than
good. Those superficial people to whom
the program was addressed have the feeling
that they have seen it all, and they have seen
the wrong thing."
