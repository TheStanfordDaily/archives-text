# Understanding needed
## Sociobiology complicated 
### 
Allan Chen

Scientific and techological issues
are prominent in the policy-making
realm. Issues ranging from nuclear
proliferation to behavioral modifica
tion experiments are major concerns
of the public and the government for
their potential impact on the quality
of life. For the most part, however,
these are technological issues which
concern society in a direct sense.
Only rarely is pure scientific
theory, whose immediate aim is exp
lanation rather than exploitation,
debatedoutside scientific circles. An
idea must be a loaded, emotionally
charged idea indeed to find its way to
public scrutiny. Sociobiology is just
such an idea.
The discipline of sociobiology,
made coherent for the first time in
Edward Wilson's Sociobiology: The
New Synthesis, postulates that much
of human behavior can be explained
genetically. It extends Darwin's
natural selection argument from the
species' physical characteristics to
its behavioral ones. It asserts, for
example, that our ethical beliefs are
the result of an evolutionary rather
than a consciously initiated process.
Controversy easily seen
It isn't hard to see why sociobiol
ogy is controversial. Any theory
wflich ventures out of its own nar
rowly defined realm to challenge
human thinking in some other field,
especially philosophy, religion and
ethics, is bound to draw fire. There
are precedents â€” Galileo's defense
of the heliocentric theory, and Dar
win's theory of evolution are exam
ples.
The debate on the implications of
sociobiology is an extension of the
social Darwinist controversy (which
tried to justify capitalism through
evolution) in the same way that the
theory is an extension of evolutio
nary theory. Its critics are concerned
that the new synthesis might be used
to 'prove' that intelligence .is race
linked, to jystify male sexist behavior,
and to suppress or slow social re
forms by demonstrating that the
human genetic makeup would pre
vent change from working, that the
status quo with all its imperfections is
the best of all attainable worlds.
Detractors organizing
The detractors of sociobiology
have been organizing. A session of
the annual convention of the Ameri
can Association for the Advancement
of Science was disrupted by mem
bers of the International Committee

against Racism. Edward Wilson, the
principal speaker, was doused with
water from a pitcher during the con
fusion.
The Boston-based Science for the
People has geared itself up for an
anti-sociobiology campaign. A
number of academics are becoming
outspoken in their criticism of the
scientific basis of the field.
All of this activity points to a very
basic question: just when does sci
ence cross the line between the objec
tive and the value-laden? It could be
that the two are inherently insepara
ble the closer to the lie and social
sciences, the farther from the physi
cal sciences a discipline is located.
And if certain fields of study are
indeed more subjective than objec
tive while claiming all the while to be
value-free, what is to be done about
the possible effects on society's in
stitutions and ways of thinking?
Dangerous reasoning
This line of reasoning is uncom
fortably close to being subversive
and suppressionist. Any prohibition
of investigation in any discipline,
value-laden or not, for other than
reasons of physical safety, is tan
tamount to the tacit acceptance of
censorship, and the notion that
some people are better qualified to
judge what is seditious.
On the other hand scientific theory
is too often misused by both the sci
entist, who will claim that his/her
technical expertise is a prerequisite
for making value judgments, as well
as the non-scientist, who will use un
certain scientific theory to justify
his/her actions in society. Hitler's at
tempts to 'prove' the superiority of
the Aryan race, to even elaborate an
Aryan physics, and Lysenko's
heavy-handed domination of Soviet
genetic research are among the more
extreme examples.
Sociobiology represents natural
science's foray into the domain of
the social sciences, and it could eas
ily be misunderstood and misused in
the above tradition. It offers a very
real challenge to social science in its
reductionistic worldview that re
duces the underlying causes of
human behavior to purely biological
mechanisms.
Wilson unflinchingly writes: "It
may not be too much to say that
sociology and the other social sci
ences, as well as the humanities, are
the last branches of biology waiting
to be included in the New Synth

esis."
While his desire to encompass the
social sciences in a grand unified
field theory of biology is admirable,
the effort is somewhat misguided.
Because the social sciences are inhe
rently subjective, they cannot be un
ified under the scientific method,
which is based on logical reasoning
and objective, quantifiable thinking,
despite its imperfections.
Secondly, the social sciences and
humanities represent a completely
different way of thinking. They are
both openly dependent on subjec
tive, very personal worldviews, and
on intuitive, non-quantifiable ways
of thinking, more so than the pure
sciences are. Science certainly has
little predictive value over individual,
random behavior.
The objectivization of the social
sciences under sociobiology can
only have dire consequences for the
quality of life. Likewise, the politici
zation of sociobiology, expecially if
its final goal is suppression, could
have serious implications for free
dom of thought. Before passing
judgment on sociobiology, we
should come to understand it.
