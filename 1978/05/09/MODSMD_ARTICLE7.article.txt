# Harvard Experiment

A couple of days ago, Harvard Uni
versity's Faculty of Arts and Sciences
voted 182 to 65 to begin a major revi
sion of its undergraduate cur
riculum. Under Harvard's present
"general education" system, stu
dents have to take courses in the
natural sciences, social sciences and
humanities. Under the new "core
curriculum" scheme just adopted,
the requirements will get considera
bly more directed and specific. This
change is likely to have a significant
educational impact on Harvard and
the other colleges and universities
that follow events there. But it's also a
sign of the larger reversals we've
seen over the past decade in the role
universities have chosen to play in
society as a whole.
Ten years ago, the country was
watching the early development of
the wave of student strikes and de
monstrations that were to have such
a jarring effect on our political life.
The protest movement wasn't just at
tacking a set of national policies; it
also came to indict the universities
that served as the movement's
launching pad. According to the cri
tics, the universities oppressed their
students in much the same way the
larger society oppressed the power
less. Educators ignored the ideologi
cal biases in the learning they con
veyed. And the colleges were shrink
ing their obligations refusing to en
list the the great political and moral
struggles of the day.
The clenched fist that decorated
posters during various student
strikes and demonstrations became a
symbol of the movement, and uni
versities proceeded to dismantle
their requirements in varying ways in
an attempt to satisfy their accusers.
But Harvard was never without fa
culty members who resisted the
trend. In 1974 they began trying to
repair some of the damage the years

had done to the general education
program there, and this week's vote
was the result.
The new program lays out five
areas in which students must take
courses: literature and the arts, his
tory, social and philosophical
analysis, science and mathematics,
and foreign languages and culture. It
tells what core courses should be
doing in each of these fields. For in
stance, the plan says that the com
mon aim of the "literature and the
arts" course is "to foster a critical
understanding of how man gives ar
tistic expression to his experience of
the world." By examining "selected
major works," the plan goes on, stu
dents should develop "skills of read
ing, seeing, and hearing."
The plan even gives a definition of
an "educated person": He should
"think and write clearly and effec
tively," have an "informed acquain
tance" with the basic academic
areas, use his experience in the con
text of "other cultures and other
times," have some acquaintance
with "moral and ethical problems,"
and acquire "depth in some field of
knowledge." Not much talk here
about relevance. Nor is there much
skrinking from the thought that it is
indeed possible to decide what it
means to be educated, and to direct
students accordingly.
The Harvard plan is going to face
difficulties on the way to full im
plementation. It may provide too
many ways for ingenious students to
escape its requirements; it will cer
tainly run upagainstthe special prob
lems of teaching science and math to
those not gifted in the fields. But as a
statement of a university's willing
ness to resume its role in a liberal
society, the program is well worth
emulating.
