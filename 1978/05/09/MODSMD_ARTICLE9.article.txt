# Why de Beauvoir was axed
## Decision-making process explained

I was moved by Ellen Byrne's column (Daily,
April 7) "A Shelter From the Storm" about Simone
de Beauvior House because I thought she articu
lated well some of the goals and promises of the
house as it was established last year. As proposed
last winter, de Beavoir was "potentially one of
Stanford's most disturbing, catalytic, and exciting
resources," and it did "(represent) 'a unique re
source on this campus." To some extent it
achieved these goals, even after a distressingly
long start-up period.
However, hercolumn disturbed mefora couple
of reasons and I would like to be sure one under
stands both the standards that were used in
evaluating the house this year and the process
used to make the decision.
The academic program of the house was central
to its proposal last year. While the advisory com
mittee which recommended adoption of the
theme had serious reservations about the
academic program, it was assured that a SWOPSI
course last spring quarter would "lay the
groundwork for the house . . . and, most impor
tantly, its academic program." A Resource Croup
of five to ten professors and administrators was to
be established which would be in regular contact
with the house (monthly or bi-monthly) and which
would help the house members in academic plan
ning, evaluation, and advising.
Since that failed to happen last spring, over the
summer and throughout autumn quarter when
Alice Supton or I of the Office of Residential Edu
cation met with coordinators or members of the
house, we stressed the importance of the house's
fulfilling its theme academically and emphasized
that they should be taking advantage of the re
sources available to them — of faculty and staff
who had supported the proposal last year and of
University and community programs which could

be utilized by the house in its program.
As early as November, when I met with the resi
dent assistant, I pointed out that involvement of
faculty would be important to help the house meet
its goals, to help the coordinators articulate and
focus on academic aspects of the theme, and to
give us an informed perspective on house evalua
tion.
Nothing was more distressing in reviewing the
start-up of the house than the fact that the house
had not been ready for occupancy in the fall. The
mistakes that were made by University offices re
sponsible for readying for the house were taken
into account in explaining the length of time it
took for the house to get its operation underway.
No excuses can be made for the mistakes — over
sights, not elements of any conspiracy to do the
house in.
Indeed, attention was paid to the house and
resources both fiscal and personal committed to
the program, many of which were never used by
the residents. Had the academic program been
planned as promised in the proposal, it would
have awaited only the readying of the house to be
implemented. As it was, both the setting up of the
co-op and the development of the academic prog
ram could not both be handled during autumn
quarter.
Coherent academic program
In mid-January I asked the house (through the
resident assistant) for an evaluation of the prog
ram this year, specifically requesting information
about whether a coherent academic program had
been developed around the theme. The house's
report was reviewed at a meeting I held at the
house in February. Out of that meeting and sub
sequent discussions (with two of the graduate
coordinators of the house and members of the
Dean of Student Affairs Office) arose questions

about the house's leadership for next year and the
development of its academic program.
Another reason the review and decision-making
process took so long was that we were reluctant to
have to make judgments on barely more than one
quarter's experience and we were favorably im
pressed with the beginnings of th academic prog
ram winter quarter. To determine what provision
was being made to continue and build upon this
year's experience, in early March we asked the
house several questions about its leadership and
program planning for next year.
Measuring against standards
The judgment which had to be made before this
spring's Draw and which was considered for as
long a period as possible was made by measuring
the house against the standards of its own prop
osal. Those of us in Residential Education charged
with making that decision were very seriously
concerned about the lack of specificity in planning
for next year or even spring quarter of this year.
We were si mply not persuaded that the program
would be substantially better. As Norm Robinson
stated in his letter to the house informing them of
the decision, "These concerns about the viability
of the academic program, along with reservations
about house leadership for next year, have led to
the decision."
We in the Dean of Student Affairs Office are
disappointed to have to make the judgment we
did, but we cannot avoid making it. Whether you
agree with the decision or not, I hope you will
understand the process by which it was made and
the standards set by the house itself used in mak
ing it.
