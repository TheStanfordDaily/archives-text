# Protesters block Lyman's office

### 
Continuing their protest against South African in
vestments, about 60 demonstrators locked arms in front
of all three doors to President Richard Lyman's office
early yesterday morning and blocked entry of
employees until 9:30 a.m.
The protestors allowed Jean Fetter, assistant to the
president, and others to enter the building after being
warned by Robert Rosenzweig, vice president for public
affairs, that they wou! J face arrest and campus judicial
proceedings if they continued to block entry.
About 40 of the protestors arrived at Lyman's office at
about 7:10 a.m. after a 7 a.m. gathering behind Memo
rial Church.
One protestor said, "Thp Board of Trustees has built a
wall of resistance to student opinion. We're not going to

be obstructed by a brick wall. We're building a human
wall."
Lyman remained at home throughout the demonstra
tion even though he was scheduled to be in the office
before leaving for the East later in the day. Lyman will be
out of town until later in the week.
According to Provost William Miller, the protest had
"inconvenienced" the office but not disrupted it.
Shortly after deciding to allow the employees to enter
the office, five Santa Clara County Sheriff's cars contain
ing 22 deputies pulled into the Quad. The deputies left
quickly after learning the protestors chose not to f«2Cto
arrest.
The protestors left Lyman's office and circled the
Inner Quad chanting and singing at 10 a.m.
