Griffin unoriginal
As a graduate of Canisius College
1968, frankly, I was appalled to learn
that certain Stanford students had
written to the president of that Uni
versity, requesting that the school
mascot become the Griffin, a symbol
long used and revered by Canisius
College.
I'm well aware that robber baron,
Leland Stanford, built Stanford as the
Harvard of the West, but why should

this robber baron spirit be continued
in this day and age?
Cannot the students/alumni of
what purports to be a great university
choose a symbol that another insitu
tion of learning does not have? Is
creativity and ingenuity so lacking at
Stanford?

Trustee supports CIR
(This letter was originally sent to Pro
fessor Frederick Hillier, chairman of
the CIR.)
The CIR may mistakenly conclude
from official statements in the Daily
that trustees' recent proxy votes have
been unanimous. Although I may be
in a minority, perhaps even a minor
ity of one, I have consistently sup
ported the ClR's recommendations
on all South African proxy resolu
tions.
I agree with the CI R's reasoning on
social responsibility criteria and,
specifically, on withdrawal from
South Africa. Also I believe that trus
tees should be guided by the advice
of the CIR in all but the most excep
tional circumstances.

Democracy at Stanford
I wrote an editorial about the re
cent Texaco proxy sit-in, "Democ
racy at Stanford," which you pub
lished under the headline "SCRIP
Conduct Mannerly." My title was an
integral part of my statement of opin
ion, and yours gave an unintended
impression which I'd like to correct.
First of all, this was not an editorial
about SCRIP. The sit-in as I observed
it had a wide base of student support,
and I was writing about all of the
Stanford students who participated.
Second, I called attention to the
conduct of the protesters not to pat
them on the head — see the nice
boys and girls, they say please and
thank you and clean under their
fingernails — but to point out that
their self-restraint was a conscious
political choice, the same kind of
politics practiced by Mohandas K.
Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. I
was holding this mature and dig
nified conduct up for admiration;
your headline reduced it to absur
dity.
Third, democracy was highlighted
in the original title because it was my
major theme. I meant to convey the
opinion that the sit in was an honor
able and traditional means of effect
ing non-violent political change, a
means as American as the Fourth of
July and a lot more peaceful.
We too often condemn our politi
cal system for being frustrating, inef
ficient, slow and unwieldy, without
remembering that it is also the
greatest guarantor of civil liberties

and peaceful evolution yet disco
vered. On the subject of South Afri
can investments, slowly and frustrat
ingly, progress is being made! Let us
applaud the system which makes that
possible.

Outrage and platitudes
The outrage against the South Afri
can system of apartheid and the de
mand that U.S. corporations stop
supporting this system through their
business with the South African gov
ernment are not new. And the
platitudes about corporations being
a progressive force, the statements
that "reasonable people can differ,"
the granting of unimportant conces
sions, the "progress" that gives the
illusion of motion with the minimum
of change are not new either.
I recognize that reasonable people
do differ on this — I suppose reason
able people could differ on almost
every important issue — and I will
even grant that the trustees' yes vote
on the proxy calling for withdrawal
by Phelps Dodge was another very
small step in the right direction. But
meanwhile the blacks and other col
ored peoples of South Africa con
tinue to be deprived of their basic
freedoms, continue to suffer, to see
their children die of disease and
malnutrition under the apartheid
system bolstered by U.S. corpora
tions.
Nothing the trustees have done or
said gives any hope that they will
change their basic view that U.S.
corporations are fundamentally a
progressive force in South Africa,
even though this approach is in di
rect opposition to the conclusions of
the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility which the trustees
explicitly established to thoroughly
investigate the corporations' role in
South Africa.
The trustees set the rules for deci
sion making and if they don't win,
they change the rules.
Undoubtably the trustees will con
tinue to make "concessions" that
concede nothing or very little, to
take actions that perpetuate the illu
sion of progress. I hope the students
here do not allow the current situa
tion to be so superficially diffused.
The issues involved aren't simple
— but neither are they overwhelm
ingly complex — and the arguments
for corporate withdrawal have al
ready been well researched and
documented in the form of "U.S. In
vestments in South Africa," available
in the Bookstore.
The South Africa issue isn't an
academic exercise in economics or
ethics. It's a living, vital issue that has
real impact on millions of lives and
which demands involvement.
