# Anti-gay initiative attacked by Bay-area coalition
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — A coalition of politicians,
educators and community leaders yesterday
blasted an anti-homosexual teachers initiative,
calling it insidious, dangerous and undemocra
tic.
The coalition, called Bay Area Committee
Against the Briggs Initiative, announced at a
press conference that it would wage a statewide
battle against the anti-gay proposal, the brain
child of state Sen. John Briggs of Fullerton, a
Republican candidate for governor.
Briggs, who joined Anita Bryant's campaign
against gays in Miami last year, turned in last
week what he claimed were enough signatures
to get the initiative on the November ballot. It
would allow school boards to fire or refuse to
hire teachers and school employees who are
avowed homosexuals or publicly support gay
lifestyles.
"It's an attempt to play upon fear and pre
judice and find false scapegoats for real prob
lems in the educational system," said Sally
Cearhart, a professor at San Francisco State Uni

versity and an avowed lesbian.
Harvey Milk, who last year became the first
proclaimed homosexual elected to the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors, urged more
gays to speak out and tell their friends and
neighbors that "it's my rights you're taking
away."
"A one-to-one campaign is the best thing to
do," said Milk. "It's always easy to legislate
against a small minority. We have to let
everyone know who we are."
James Ballard, president of American Federa
tion of Teachers Local 61, said that the AFT feels
that "more than gay rights are involved." He
reported several teachers' unions and other
AFL-CIO affiliates would offer financial support
to the coalition.
In a statement read at the news conference,
author and pediatrician Benjamin Spocksaid the
initiative would "teach children to fear
homosexuals, which would be as bad for chil
dren as teaching them to be afraid of any group
or category of people."


Just seconds after demonstrators agreed not to block entrance to
President Lyman's office yesterday, five Santa Clara Sheriff cars
packed with well-prepared deputies pulled into the Quad prepared
tor the worst. With the early morning sunlight glinting off their

shielded helmets and nightsticks, the deputies were told they weren't
needed. Thus, after an unexpectedly short stay in the sandstone
rectangle beneath the towering palms, the men in green got back into
their green and white Dodges for the long drive back to San Jose.
