# Defective track found to be growing cause of train accidents
## 
### Associated Press 
A recent rash of serious de
railments and other train inci
dents has prompted federal in
spectors to take a harder line
toward railroads that have al
lowed their track to deterior
ate.
Defective track has become
the most rapidlygrowing cause
of train accidents in the past
decade. In some of the acci
dents, tank cars broke open
and deadly gas spread through
trackside neighborhoods.
Latest federal statistics show
that defective or missing
crossties, worn or poorly

aligned rails and other track
related problems account for
43 per cent of train mishaps.
)ohn Sullivan, head of the
Federal Railroad Administra
tion, told the Senate recently
that his agency has increasingly
found it must use orders and
other legal tools to get rail
roads to repair tracks.
"Among many railroads,
compliance with the regula
tions is poor," Sullivan said.
Derailments this year in
Waverly, Tenn., and
Youngstown, Fla., in which 20
persons were killed, have
drawn attention to the deterio

ration of the nation's 200,000
miles of track. And last month,
the mayor of Selma, Ala., bar
red train traffic through his
town, claiming rail conditions
presented a deadly hazard to
his citizens.
Interviews with federal track
inspectors reveal an apparent
crackdown on prosperous,
mostly well-maintained west
ern railroads, as well as ban
krupt, deteriorating lines in the
Midwest and Northeast.
Railroad spokesmen say they
are voluntarily spending hun
dreds of millions of dollars on
repairs, ordering trains to slow

down on hazardous stretches,
or closing badly deteriorated
lines. Some of the voluntary
steps are at the insistence of
federal inspectors, however.
In recent weeks, FRA inspec
tors have notified the Balti
more & Ohio Railroad that due
to track conditions, the gov
ernment intends to shut down
70 miles of track carrying po
tentially hazardous freight be
tween Springfield, 111. and In
dianapolis.
On April 27, the FRA issued
an order banning hazardous
cargo on all northern New Jer
sey lines of the bankrupt New
York, Susquehanna & Western
Railroad Co. The FRA had
found the railroad had done
nothing to maintain the tracks
since it was declared bankrupt
in 1976.
Harold Keeler, an FRA reg
ional track engineer who in
spects 49,000 miles of track in
California, Arizona, Nevada,
Utah and Colorado, says the
Southern Pacific Railroad re
cently agreed to lower speed
limits from 60 to 45 mph bet
ween Oakland and Ogden,
Utah, and between Oakland
and Seattle.
Philadelphia's regional track

inspector, Joe Zebrowski, says
Conrail has voluntarily agreed
to post a 10-mph "go-slow"
order on a 6'/2-mile stretch be
tween Camden and Wood
bury, N.J., because of "a vari
ety of defects."
Just north of Philadelphia, an
11-mile run of the Amtrak met
roliner passenger service has a
10-mph limit. And Amtrak,
which is spending $1.75 billion
to upgrade its northeast pas
senger service, has lowered
the speed limit from 105 to 60
mph in the vicinity of Oden
ton, Md., due to track condi
tions.
Bob Johnson, head of the
FRA regional office for Texas,
Oklahoma, Louisiana, New
Mexico and Arkansas, says the
approximately 30,000 miles of
track in his area generally are in
good condition compared with
other parts of the country.
Bur Johnson says his office is
getting more complaints from
local officials worried about
hazardous track passing
through their towns, and he
says his inspectors are "getting
stricter."
The railroads in Johnson's
region and in the West, gener
ally are more prosperous and

in better repair than those in
the East and Midwest. Western
railroads also have an
economic edge over eastern
lines because longer freight
hauls are more profitable than
the short hauls typical in the
East.
But that hasn't necessarily
meant eastern trains are more
hazardous than western ones.
Rail experts say poorer track
conditions in the East mean
slower runs. Thus, while acci
dents tend to be more frequent
in the East and Midwest, they
also tend to be less serious
than in the West and South
where accidents often occur at
higher speeds.
The FRA says there were 4260
train accidents due to track de

fects out of a total of 10,248 ac
cidents from all causes in 1976,
the latest year for which figures
are available. Roughly 500 ac
cidents involved shipments of
hazardous materials. Over a
nine-year period from 1967 to
1976, track-related accidents
increased 100 per cent.
Railroads' track problems re
flect 25 years of dwindling pro
fits. A draft study on rail safety
by the congressional Office of
Technology and Assessment
estimates the industry has de
ferred $6.6 billion in track
maintenance in that period and
needs $14.5 billion "to make
necessary capital and track im
provement over the next 10
years."

A recent rash of serious de
railments and other train inci
dents has prompted federal in
spectors to take a harder line
toward railroads that have al
lowed their track to deterior

Defective track has become
the most rapidlygrowing cause
of train accidents in the past
decade. In some of the acci
dents, tank cars broke open
and deadly gas spread through
trackside neighborhoods.
Latest federal statistics show
that defective or missing
crossties, worn or poorly

aligned rails and other track
related problems account for
43 per cent of train mishaps.
)ohn Sullivan, head of the
Federal Railroad Administra
tion, told the Senate recently
that his agency has increasingly
found it must use orders and
other legal tools to get rail
roads to repair tracks.
"Among many railroads,
compliance with the regula
tions is poor," Sullivan said.
Derailments this year in
Waverly, Tenn., and
Youngstown, Fla., in which 20
persons were killed, have
drawn attention to the deterio

ration of the nation's 200,000
miles of track. And last month,
the mayor of Selma, Ala., bar
red train traffic through his
town, claiming rail conditions
presented a deadly hazard to
his citizens.
Interviews with federal track
inspectors reveal an apparent
crackdown on prosperous,
mostly well-maintained west
ern railroads, as well as ban
krupt, deteriorating lines in the
Midwest and Northeast.
Railroad spokesmen say they
are voluntarily spending hun
dreds of millions of dollars on
repairs, ordering trains to slow

down on hazardous stretches,
or closing badly deteriorated
lines. Some of the voluntary
steps are at the insistence of
federal inspectors, however.
In recent weeks, FRA inspec
tors have notified the Balti
more & Ohio Railroad that due
to track conditions, the gov
ernment intends to shut down
70 miles of track carrying po
tentially hazardous freight be
tween Springfield, 111. and In
dianapolis.
On April 27, the FRA issued
an order banning hazardous
cargo on all northern New Jer
sey lines of the bankrupt New
York, Susquehanna & Western
Railroad Co. The FRA had
found the railroad had done
nothing to maintain the tracks
since it was declared bankrupt
in 1976.
Harold Keeler, an FRA reg
ional track engineer who in
spects 49,000 miles of track in
California, Arizona, Nevada,
Utah and Colorado, says the
Southern Pacific Railroad re
cently agreed to lower speed
limits from 60 to 45 mph bet
ween Oakland and Ogden,
Utah, and between Oakland
and Seattle.
Philadelphia's regional track

inspector, Joe Zebrowski, says
Conrail has voluntarily agreed
to post a 10-mph "go-slow"
order on a 6'/2-mile stretch be
tween Camden and Wood
bury, N.J., because of "a vari
ety of defects."
Just north of Philadelphia, an
11-mile run of the Amtrak met
roliner passenger service has a
10-mph limit. And Amtrak,
which is spending $1.75 billion
to upgrade its northeast pas
senger service, has lowered
the speed limit from 105 to 60
mph in the vicinity of Oden
ton, Md., due to track condi
tions.
Bob Johnson, head of the
FRA regional office for Texas,
Oklahoma, Louisiana, New
Mexico and Arkansas, says the
approximately 30,000 miles of
track in his area generally are in
good condition compared with
other parts of the country.
Bur Johnson says his office is
getting more complaints from
local officials worried about
hazardous track passing
through their towns, and he
says his inspectors are "getting
stricter."
The railroads in Johnson's
region and in the West, gener
ally are more prosperous and

in better repair than those in
the East and Midwest. Western
railroads also have an
economic edge over eastern
lines because longer freight
hauls are more profitable than
the short hauls typical in the
East.
But that hasn't necessarily
meant eastern trains are more
hazardous than western ones.
Rail experts say poorer track
conditions in the East mean
slower runs. Thus, while acci
dents tend to be more frequent
in the East and Midwest, they
also tend to be less serious
than in the West and South
where accidents often occur at
higher speeds.
The FRA says there were 4260
train accidents due to track de

fects out of a total of 10,248 ac
cidents from all causes in 1976,
the latest year for which figures
are available. Roughly 500 ac
cidents involved shipments of
hazardous materials. Over a
nine-year period from 1967 to
1976, track-related accidents
increased 100 per cent.
Railroads' track problems re
flect 25 years of dwindling pro
fits. A draft study on rail safety
by the congressional Office of
Technology and Assessment
estimates the industry has de
ferred $6.6 billion in track
maintenance in that period and
needs $14.5 billion "to make
necessary capital and track im
provement over the next 10
years."
