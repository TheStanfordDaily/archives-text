# Gatsby night to be decadent
## 
### Kathy Trafton 
Picture this: several hundred women in
chiffon gowns, flapper dresses, floppy
hats, bangle jewelery and 1920s Paris orig
inals. With them under the soft moonlight
promenade as many men in white suits,
baggy pants, knickers, garters, panama
hats and spats.
One of Jay Gatsby's decacJent bashes
from the Maybe. Well, almost. Ac
tually, it is a scene from the Senior Gatsby
Night this Friday from 8 p.m. to midnight,
the one last special event for seniors and
their dates that may be the highlight of
their Stanford careers.
Beverley Standing, one of the four senior
class presidents who is putting on the
event, said that the atmosphere in Frost
Amphitheater that night will be "roman

tic," and that there will be just the merest
"suggestion of light."
Greek columns
Around the stage where the Stanford
Jazz Band will play tunes, "everything
from '10s and '40s to Stevie Wonder,"
said Standing, there will be Grecian
columns and statues of ancient Greek
maidens.
Champagne punch will flow from a
seven-tiered fountain near the stage.
Other lavish Gatsby touches include freely
distributed wine and champagne, and
hot and cold hors d'oeuvres.
Senior Class Co-President Peter Jones
will drive the other three co-presidents in
a rented blue Rolls Koyce to the party.
The cost of the evening is $4 a person.
Tickets are available at Bowman Alumni

Hcjuse, and also in White Plaza at lun
chtime. The co-presidents hope to sell 550
tickets, Standing said.
Tickets will not be sold at the gate, and
they most likely will not be available on
Friday afternoon. Standing suggests that
seniors buy early, recalling that the Senior
Casino Night last autumn was sold out and
nothing could be done about the desper
ate calls from seniors who wanted tickets
too late.
The senior class presidents plan to break
even on the Gatsby night, Standing said.
The cost for music, decorations, food, etc.
will be about $2000.
Standing said that a coordinating com
mittee of seniors will help to set up and
clean up in order to reduce the cost of
Plant Services.
