"There is a stigma here about help. Sup
posedly everyone is 'self-sufficient.' Learning is
a skill, and people have to learn how to learn.
Students can use this program to learn how to
study less," said junior Bill Sing, a peer coun
selor at the Learning Assistance Center (LAC).
He spoke enthusiastically about the recent
expansions in the walk-in peer counseling prog
ram.
"The professors here aren't realistic. They
aren't dealing with the whole person — they
only see the poli-sci student or the engineering
major. This is where the real value of LAC comes
in — they don't make distinctions. They focus
on the whole person, and work from there,"
Sing commented.
Counselors listen
The LAC, located at the north entrance to
Meyer Library, does not offer "remedial help.
The trained peer counselors do not "dish out
advice."' Rather, the counselors listen fo the
overall situation of the student and help the
student pinpoint what he or she needs to do.
They offer valuable assistance in areas such as
time management, note-taking, test anxiety,
and concentration. They concentrate on tangi
ble methods and techniques for overcoming
what may seem like an impossible work load.
"I want people to know there is somewhere to
go if they feel panicky," said Rosa Casarez, in
structor in efficiency skills at LAC. "All students
need these skills at one point."
Normally, only students in the efficiency
learning skills class could take advantage of the
peer counseling program. But LAC has now ex
panded its program, and counselors are availa
ble for spontaneous walk-ins. There is also a
sign-up sheet for students who would like to
make an appointment with a specific counselor.
Training
Peer counselors undergo extensive training to
help students deal with academic problems.
"I think counselors are competently trained,"
said Camille Fong, who has been a counselor tor
three quarters. "Instead of going to AIC
(Academic Information Center) where they
hand you a book, at LAC you get personal feed
back."

"You can never separate pu rely academic , so
cial, or emotional factors," said Sing. "Good
counseling means you listen to the problems of
the whole person and then look at alternatives."
"Since we haven't been trained as emotional
counselors, we refer students to the Bridge or
elsewhere if they need help in that capacity.'
said Alka)oshi, another peer counselor. "But we
always listen to the person."
'Sensitive response'
Casarez said she believes the "sensitive re
sponse" of the LAC walk-in peer counseling
program to academic problems is much needed
at the University, but most people simply don't
know about it.
"College life is college life. Sometimes social
life gets in the way, and then there is a natural
tendency to feel guilt and anxiety bei luse
people here feel they 'should be' good tu
dents. LAC can help by providing reference
points, a way to tackle the work load.
The peer counselors also said they enjoy their
work.
"We put in a lot more hours than we get cr> dit
for," said Joshi.
"I wouldn't do it it I didn't like it," said *>ing
"In fact, I'll probably do it without compensa
tion next year."
Expansion
I hose involved in the LAC walk-in counseling
program said they hope to see it expand even
more.
I would like to see a lot more sophomore
junior and senior walk-ins," said Joshi. "There is
a lot of potential for help here, but it needs to be
utilized."
Sing said he sees the future role of LAC as
expanding into the area of teaching effective
ness.
"More than half the teaching done on campus
is done by non-professionals, that is, teaching
assistants and grad students. That's a lot ot
teaching by people who supposedly aren't
trained," Sing remarked.
But for now the people involved in the walk-in
peer counseling program are concerned that
students hear about the program and take ad
vantage of its services. The LAC is open from ') to
12 a.m. and 1 to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

a lot of potential for help here, but it needs to be
utilized."
Sing said he sees the future role of LAC as
expanding into the area of teaching effective
ness.
"More than half the teaching done on campus
is done by non-professionals, that is, teaching
assistants and grad students. That's a lot ot
teaching by people who supposedly aren't
trained," Sing remarked.
But for now the people involved in the walk-in
peer counseling program are concerned that
students hear about the program and take ad
vantage of its services. The LAC is open from ') to
12 a.m. and 1 to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.
"There is a stigma here about help. Sup
posedly everyone is 'self-sufficient.' Learning is
a skill, and people have to learn how to learn.
Students can use this program to learn how to
study less," said junior Bill Sing, a peer coun
selor at the Learning Assistance Center (LAC).
He spoke enthusiastically about the recent
expansions in the walk-in peer counseling prog
ram.
"The professors here aren't realistic. They
aren't dealing with the whole person — they
only see the poli-sci student or the engineering
major. This is where the real value of LAC comes
in — they don't make distinctions. They focus
on the whole person, and work from there,"
Sing commented.
Counselors listen
The LAC, located at the north entrance to
Meyer Library, does not offer "remedial help.
The trained peer counselors do not "dish out
advice."' Rather, the counselors listen fo the
overall situation of the student and help the
student pinpoint what he or she needs to do.
They offer valuable assistance in areas such as
time management, note-taking, test anxiety,
and concentration. They concentrate on tangi
ble methods and techniques for overcoming
what may seem like an impossible work load.
"I want people to know there is somewhere to
go if they feel panicky," said Rosa Casarez, in
structor in efficiency skills at LAC. "All students
need these skills at one point."
Normally, only students in the efficiency
learning skills class could take advantage of the
peer counseling program. But LAC has now ex
panded its program, and counselors are availa
ble for spontaneous walk-ins. There is also a
sign-up sheet for students who would like to
make an appointment with a specific counselor.
Training
Peer counselors undergo extensive training to
help students deal with academic problems.
"I think counselors are competently trained,"
said Camille Fong, who has been a counselor tor
three quarters. "Instead of going to AIC
(Academic Information Center) where they
hand you a book, at LAC you get personal feed
back."

"You can never separate pu rely academic , so
cial, or emotional factors," said Sing. "Good
counseling means you listen to the problems of
the whole person and then look at alternatives."
"Since we haven't been trained as emotional
counselors, we refer students to the Bridge or
elsewhere if they need help in that capacity.'
said Alka)oshi, another peer counselor. "But we
always listen to the person."
'Sensitive response'
Casarez said she believes the "sensitive re
sponse" of the LAC walk-in peer counseling
program to academic problems is much needed
at the University, but most people simply don't
know about it.
"College life is college life. Sometimes social
life gets in the way, and then there is a natural
tendency to feel guilt and anxiety bei luse
people here feel they 'should be' good tu
dents. LAC can help by providing reference
points, a way to tackle the work load.
The peer counselors also said they enjoy their
work.
"We put in a lot more hours than we get cr> dit
for," said Joshi.
"I wouldn't do it it I didn't like it," said *>ing
"In fact, I'll probably do it without compensa
tion next year."
Expansion
I hose involved in the LAC walk-in counseling
program said they hope to see it expand even
more.
I would like to see a lot more sophomore
junior and senior walk-ins," said Joshi. "There is
a lot of potential for help here, but it needs to be
utilized."
Sing said he sees the future role of LAC as
expanding into the area of teaching effective
ness.
