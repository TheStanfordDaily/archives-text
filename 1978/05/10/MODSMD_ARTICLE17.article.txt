### Alfred Nakatsuma 
In the last NorCal Confer
ence match of the season, the
Stanford's women's tennis
team defeated UC-Davis, 6-3.
The Cards remained unde
feated in league action, and
have only lost one match all
year, to No. 1-ranked USC.
Both Kathy and Barb Jordan
easily disposed of the No. 1
and No. 2 Davis singles players,
Debbie Cator and )oan Pen
nello. With consistent, forcing
strokes and timely volleys,
neither girl gave up more than
three games.
Susie Hagey played her
match with a pulled muscle in
the back of her leg and had
some problems moving, but

she nevertheless had enough
energy to beat Diane Demar
tini. Playing mostlya backcourt
game, Hagey outlasted Demar
tini in a second set tiebreaker.
Caryn Hertel also succeeded.
According to Coach Anne
Gould, "I thought she played
an exceptional match."
Stanford dropped two of the
three doubles matches, but the
outcome had already been de
cided. The Aggies toughened
up and beatythe teams of
Wendy Richardson-Corrine
Nevinny and Hillary Landorf-
Pam Gardner.
This match was probably the
last one in which seniors Land
orf and Audrey Kemp will play.
Their serivces have been in

valuable to the team and coach
Gould said, "Both have added
tremendously in playing and in
spirit. Their value to the team
goes beyond their playing.''
The Stanford women will in
vade the courts of UCLA this
weekend for their last match.
Next Thursday, they will go to
the WAIAW regional qualifying
tournament in Berkeley, and
on June 4-12 will be entered in
the AIAW National tournament
at Salisbury, Maryland.
Gould, heading into the end
of the season, said, "Many im
portant matches lie ahead, but
our girls are ready and excited
to play. Everybody's healthy
and we have the confidence to
go all the way. We can win it
all."
