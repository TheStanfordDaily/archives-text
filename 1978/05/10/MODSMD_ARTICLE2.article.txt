# Strike at 'heart of state'
## Italian terrorists kill Moro 
### Associated Press 
The bloody, bullet-riddled body of
Aldo Moro was found chained and
stuffed in the back of a parked car in
downtown Rome yesterday, climax
ing a 55-day ordeal of terror that
stunned Italy and the world.
Red Brigade terrorists, flaunting
to the end their attack on the "heart
of the state," pumped 11 bullets into
the chest of the former premier.
They left the body in a stolen maroon
Renault at the very center of Italian
political power — on a cobblestoned
sidestreet between the party head
quarters of the Communists and
Moro's Christian Democrats.
The discovery left the nation
grief-stricken and fearful. Millions of
Italians poured into streets and piaz
zas in a massive display of unity.
The ruling Christian Democrats,
with staunch backing from the
Communists, steadfastly refused the
kidnappers' demand that 13 impris
oned terrorists be freed in exchange
for Moro's life.
Moro's embittered family, which
had pleaded with the Christian
Democrats to bargain for his free
dom, issued a statement opposing a
state funeral and official mourning
ceremonies.
"The family locks itself up in si
lence and demands silence," it said.
"History will pass judgment on the
life and death of Aldo Moro."
From captivity, Moro appealed in
handwritten letters for his Christian
Democrats to deal with the ultra
leftist terrorists. Facing death, he re
quested in a letter two weeks ago
that no government or party official
attend his funeral.
World leaders from President
)immy Carter to Queen Elizabeth II
condemned the murder of the man
considered Italy's most influential
politician, the leading candidate for
president and architect of a historic
agreement between the Vatican
backed Christian Democrats and the
largest Communist Party in the West.
Carter called it a "contemptible
and cowardly act." He sent a letter of
sympathy to Moro's widow.
Premier Giulio Andreotti called an
emergency Cabinet meeting. It
lasted 30 minutes, received a report
from the Interior Ministry and ad
journed without issuing a statement,
noting the family's request for si
lence.

President Giovanni Leone, in an
emotional television address to the
nation, said: "Aldo Moro has been
pitilessly and horrifyingly slain. The
beast who tried to give the kidnap
ping ... an ideological and political
mantle failed to listen to the cry that
the whole of mankind gave out in
order that this man could be
spared."
Communist Party chief Enrico Ber
linguer called Moro "a great democ
ratic leader who fell murdered by an
organization of terrorist animals."
Thousands of police mounted a
massive new manhunt for the killers
who abducted Moro on March 16,
slaying his five police bodyguards.
The terrorists later issued a state
ment, saying he had been sentenced
to death by a "people's court" for the
"anti-proletarian" policies of the
Christian Democrats — rulers of Italy
for three decades.
The body, clad in the pinstriped
shirt, dark blue suit, blue socks and
black shoes Moro wore when ab
ducted, was wrapped in a blue over
coat and red blanket.
It was hunched over in the luggage
space behind the rear seat of the Re
nault hatchback abandoned on Via
Michelangelo Caetani, a 200-yard
long street in one of Rome's busiest
districts.
Moro's hands and feet were
chained, his eyes half closed. The
head rested on a spare tire. His watch
and a bracelet were in a plastic bag
beside the body.
Police said 11 bullets had been
fired in a 5-inch-wide circle into
Moro's chest, apparently within 24
hours before the body was found.
They said the killers possibly used a
submachine pistol with a silencer.
Earlier reports had said the victim
had been shot in the head.
An infected wound of the buttocks
indicated Moro was wounded at the
time he was kidnapped, police re
ported.
There were bullet holes in Moro's
shirt and undershirt but not in his
jacket. Police said the jacket appa
rently was put on and the hands
chained after the murder.
They theorized Moro may have
been shot in the gang's hideout and
the body then dragged to the car.
Sand and bits of grass were found in
his trouser cuffs and on his socks.

The shoes were dusted clean.
Police found the body after a bug
ging device monitored an anonym
ous call to Moro's office saying it was
in a red car on Via Michelangelo
Caetani. At about the same time,
another call to a police emergency
number said a bomb had been
placed in a car on a nearby street.
Explosives experts examined the
Renault, ripping out the ignition ca
bles before opening the rear hatch
and finding the body.
Firemen who saw the body said the
face was extremely pale with several
days' growth of beard, and the
5-foot-11 frame had lost considerable
weight.
