They're still at it.
The Cardinal nine, prepar
ing for their season
concluding series with Ber
keley this coming weekend,
ripped the USF Dons 19-8
yesterday afternoon in San
Francisco.
Mark Abbondola, shown
here facing USC,with the help
of reliever Bruce Fiala, picked
up his sixth win of the year
improving Stanford's season
record to 32-18-2.
Catcher Bruce Walters had
a day at the plate, going four
for-four with an inside-the
park home run. Tom Guar
dino collected five RBI on
three hits — including two
triples — but is still looking
fot the record breaking 14th
round-tripper of his season.
"We didn't play super, by
any means," said coach Mar
quess, "but it's better than
losing."
The Cards play a make-up
game this afternoon with
Santa Clara at 2:30 p.m. in
Sunken Diamond.
