# Cardinal nine's steadfast fan
## 
### Caryn Coulter 
About two years ago Saturday, Stanford
was leading USC at the top of the fifth
inning in the Sunken Diamond when
James "Woody" Woodside crushed my ef
fort to interrupt his concentration with an
on-the-spot interview.
"We've been waiting a long time for
this," spouted Stanford's fondest fan from
under his faded red baseball cap.
That day, Woody was concentrating
especially hard. "We were up to our necks
that year," he now recalls, "but this year is
different."
Last Saturday at the 1978 USC-Stanford
contest, Woody produced an old worn
clipping from a 1976 Daily, featuring him
along with the rest of his crew in the Card
bleachers. The changes are few: he still
wears a hat, but the new one is red and
white. He still attends all the games, or "as
many as possible," as he has done for over
50 years. But he no longer sits in the shade
of the stands; Woody's new seat is a bench
under the flag pole by the drinking foun
tains. He explains, "I need a back rest
now, you know."
After Saturday's first homer, a fan
rushed up from behind Woody's post.
"Hey, Woody, who was that — Guar
di no?"
Woody jumped. "No, that was Perez.
He hits one every once in awhile. You
wanna know how many he's hit? I got it
right here."
He leafed through the carefully folded
stat sheets in his lap. Then he snatched a
sly glance at his curious new friend. "I
charge, ya know."
Saturday, Woody tried to tell me he was
71. Two years ago, however, he claimed he
was already 83. This time, I caught him and
he chuckled, "You're right, I was just kid
ding. Now I'm 84."
It doesn't really matter. Woody may al
ways be Stanford's foremost authority on
college baseball.
"I take off my hat to college baseball!"
he shouts, waving his hat after a sudden
spurt of Card talent. "These kids are just
great I think — they're just beautiful."
Sitting next to Woody was Pete
Kmetovik, a one-time Stanford half-back
and former member of the "Wild Boys."
Woody whispered, "He's probably the

best ball-carrier we ever had, back when I
still liked football."
"Remember in 1921?" Woody asked,
turning to Kmetovik. "Cal beat Ohio State
21 to 7. And up till then, they thought we
were just a bunch of palookas out here on
the West Coast. Do you remember that,
Pete?"
"No. . . Kmetovik replied, "Sorry,
Woody, that was before my time."
Undaunted, Woody turned to me. "May
I ask you a personal question?" he said,
without waiting for my permission. "Have
you found a nice fella for yourself at Stan
ford?"
As if to offer guidance, he continued.
"I've said this many a time: A good boy
becomes a better boy when he plays
baseball. Baseball is a fun game and a
friendly game."
He suddenly paused. "Get that ball in
there! . . . They should have had a double
play," he groaned.
"I qualify it in this way," he said, return
ing to his pitch, "too damn many people
tell me it's a slow game. But baseball is like
playing cards with your friends. You sit
down and play a game to win. And when
the game's over, you're friends."
And even the fans make friends: former
coaches Ray Young and Dutch Fehring,
USC Coach Rod Dedeaux and every player
in Stanford's baseball history — they're all
personal friends of Woody.
"Remember Heidi?" Woody asked
about the former Card statistician, Heidi
Munsinger. "She's got a job now." Many
women are working, he said, and that's
fine, as long as they quit when they get
married. The Stanford bat girls are fine,
too, he said, but as for the female trainer,
well, "that's a man's job," he said.
"Hey," he asked me. "Tell me what you
did last night."
I told him. He was not pleased to hear I
had not been out with a member of the
team Even worse, he said, "You mean you
didn't even go out for ice cream after
wards? Or to Kirk's for a hamburger?
"Things are different nowadays," he
said. "My god, when I was young, you fell
in love and you couldn't eat or breathe
without the other one."
Woody's wife, "mama," was not with
him Saturday. "She would have liked to
come," he said, "but she wanted to watch

the Giants on T.V."
The play continued with the score at 3-2,
Stanford. Woody moved into a story of
former first baseman and present coach
Mark Marquess:
"Mark's on first. They're playing S.C. An
S.C. guy's on first, and he bumps into
Mark pretty good. . . Mark lost his contact
lens because of the bump. The game stop
ped, naturally."
Woody paused. "Have you ever had
contacts? I did, but I never had any prob
lems with them.
"So Ray Young appeals to the audience
for combs to comb the ground around first
base. And they do it for about 20 minutes.
Suddenly something happens. Something
says to me, 'Woody, you go out there and
look for that lens.' I had watched them for
six years — I knew where to look.
"And I saw it. There it was. I got a mes
sage. What do you call that, mental tele
pathy? It was a little thing, maybe they're
bigger today. We saved him how much? a
hundred bucks, maybe?
"You know, Mark will never forget that,
and I don't think I will either."
Woody has a keen sight for baseball,
even though two cataract operations and a
case of glaucoma in his left eye make read
ing the scoreboard a bit difficult for him.
He has a keener sight for sentiments.
"You see Tom Cuardino?" he asked.
"He's having a great year, leads the whole
team in home runs; just look at that re
cord.
"But you know, he was in love last year
. . . Well, I don't know if he was really 'in
love,' but he didn't have such a good year
last year, and I just told him once this year,
'Tom, you were just in love last year.' "
At no time were Woody's own senti
ments more apparent than in his com
ments as he watched USC coach Rod De
deaux trotting off the field after some
pre-pitch coaching.
"Poor old Rod," Woody said. "He can
barely run anymore. But you know he's
about 60 — and he won't quit the game till
he dies on the field ... I think he's 64 . . .
imagine that."
Woody extended his hand to Dedeaux
as he was leaving the field after USC's vic
tory.
"Hi, Dad," Dedeaux said, as they shook.
"A fine game, coach," Woody returned.
