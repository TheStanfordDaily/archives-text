# Swimmers assess season, future

Women optimistic
Predicted in pre-season to finish fifth in
the AIAW championships, the Stanford
women's swimming team surprised
everyone but themselves and coaches Jim
Gaughran and Claudia Thomas by placing
third behind Arizona State and Florida.
Many swimmers had lifetime bests, un
usual for women competing intercol
legiately. Perhaps this was best per
sonified by senior co-captain Anne
Brodell, who was a finalist in three events
(200 , 500, 1650 freestyle) and registered
life-time bests in each.
"I think the team as a whole had an ex
cellent season," said one of the top per
formers of the year, freshman Laura
Raymond. "The team was really together
and the coaches did a super job. Jim and
Claudia complemented each other well."
It was also a banner recruiting year for
the women as two of the nation's top
prospects indicated their intent to attend
Stanford next fall. Linda Jezek, a product
of the Santa Clara Swim Club, is a national
recorder holder in the 100 yard and 200
yard backstroke as well as being a fine
individual medlevist. Noel Moran, a

teammate of Jezek's at Santa Clara, is a
world class breaststroker and also a na
tional qualifier in the individual medley.
"The addition of Jezek and Moran to the
team will be a fantastic boost to our prog
ram," commented coach Gaughran.
"They will add strength where we need
it most, in the backstroke, breaststroke
and individual medley."
With Brodell being the only AIAW point
winner not returning to the Farm, the
Cards' outlook for the future is bright.
With bumper crops of freshmen of the
likes of the Class of 1982, Arizona State
should be hard pressed to retain their
AIAW crown.
Men disappointed
"In some ways the season was a suc
cess," said one member of the men's
team, which finished 18th at the NCAA
Championships. "We qualified a lot of
guys for the NCAA's despite the tough
cut-off times and swam a great meet
against Cal. But at the NCAA's the team fell
apart. Whether it was our fault or the
coach's, there was a definite lack of lead
ership, unity and motivation."
Commented another team member, "At

times I think that )im (Caughran) took on
too much by trying to coach both the men
and the women. I think our performances
and recruiting have suffered somewhat as
a result."
"I think that the flu which was caught by
many guys at the Pac-B's really hurt us at
the NCAA's, explained assistant coach
Thomas, as a reason for Stanford's sub-par
showing at the NCAA's. "Although we
were sprinting well before the meet, our
endurance was never fully regained. The
women were on the same program as the
men, did not gel (he flu, and they swam
super at the AlAW's. So I think the men
would have done well if healthy."
Next fall, coaches Caughran and
Thomas will welcome several standout
mermen to the Farm. Jeff Stiling, from
Greenwich, Connecticut, is "one of the
most versatile high school seniors in the
country," according to Caughran, and is
an Ail-American in freestyle, butterfly and
individual medley. Joining Stiling will be
Joe Jimenez, a national qualifier in
breaststroke from Pleasant Valley, S.C.,
Don King, a sprinter from Punaho School,
Hawaii and Cliff Coran, a fine backstroker
and individual medleyist.

against Cal. But at the NCAA's the team fell
apart. Whether it was our fault or the
coach's, there was a definite lack of lead
ership, unity and motivation."
Commented another team member, "At

times I think that )im (Caughran) took on
too much by trying to coach both the men
and the women. I think our performances
and recruiting have suffered somewhat as
a result."
"I think that the flu which was caught by
many guys at the Pac-B's really hurt us at
the NCAA's, explained assistant coach
Thomas, as a reason for Stanford's sub-par
showing at the NCAA's. "Although we
were sprinting well before the meet, our
endurance was never fully regained. The
women were on the same program as the
men, did not gel (he flu, and they swam
super at the AlAW's. So I think the men
would have done well if healthy."
Next fall, coaches Caughran and
Thomas will welcome several standout
mermen to the Farm. Jeff Stiling, from
Greenwich, Connecticut, is "one of the
most versatile high school seniors in the
country," according to Caughran, and is
an Ail-American in freestyle, butterfly and
individual medley. Joining Stiling will be
Joe Jimenez, a national qualifier in
breaststroke from Pleasant Valley, S.C.,
Don King, a sprinter from Punaho School,
Hawaii and Cliff Coran, a fine backstroker
and individual medleyist.

Women optimistic
Predicted in pre-season to finish fifth in
the AIAW championships, the Stanford
women's swimming team surprised
everyone but themselves and coaches Jim
Gaughran and Claudia Thomas by placing
third behind Arizona State and Florida.
Many swimmers had lifetime bests, un
usual for women competing intercol
legiately. Perhaps this was best per
sonified by senior co-captain Anne
Brodell, who was a finalist in three events
(200 , 500, 1650 freestyle) and registered
life-time bests in each.
"I think the team as a whole had an ex
cellent season," said one of the top per
formers of the year, freshman Laura
Raymond. "The team was really together
and the coaches did a super job. Jim and
Claudia complemented each other well."
It was also a banner recruiting year for
the women as two of the nation's top
prospects indicated their intent to attend
Stanford next fall. Linda Jezek, a product
of the Santa Clara Swim Club, is a national
recorder holder in the 100 yard and 200
yard backstroke as well as being a fine
individual medlevist. Noel Moran, a

teammate of Jezek's at Santa Clara, is a
world class breaststroker and also a na
tional qualifier in the individual medley.
"The addition of Jezek and Moran to the
team will be a fantastic boost to our prog
ram," commented coach Gaughran.
"They will add strength where we need
it most, in the backstroke, breaststroke
and individual medley."
With Brodell being the only AIAW point
winner not returning to the Farm, the
Cards' outlook for the future is bright.
With bumper crops of freshmen of the
likes of the Class of 1982, Arizona State
should be hard pressed to retain their
AIAW crown.
Men disappointed
"In some ways the season was a suc
cess," said one member of the men's
team, which finished 18th at the NCAA
Championships. "We qualified a lot of
guys for the NCAA's despite the tough
cut-off times and swam a great meet
against Cal. But at the NCAA's the team fell
apart. Whether it was our fault or the
coach's, there was a definite lack of lead
ership, unity and motivation."
Commented another team member, "At
