Fighter sales to Israel discussed
Washington — The Carter administration insisted yes
terday the basic terms of its sale of jet fighters to Egypt,
Israel and Saudi Arabia will not be changed, but there
was growing talk of a compromise that would later send
additional war planes to Israel.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance told the House Interna
tional Relations Committee that private negotiations are
continuing with House and Senate members and that
"some members on both sides" have suggested such a
compromise.
Vance had met earlier in the day with members of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Jacob
Javits (R-N.Y.) left the session saying, "I believe we're on
a road which could lead to a settlement."
The senators said they had agreed not to discuss de
tails of the talks but Sen. Clifford Case (R-N.J.) asked
whether more fighters for Israel figured in the com
promise talks, replied: "If that isn't one of the elements,
I don't know what we're talking about."
President Jimmy Carter wants to sell $4.8 billion worth
of jet fighters. The deal calls for the sale of 15 F-15sand 75
F-16s to Israel, 60 F-15s to Saudi Arabia and 50 less sophis
ticated F-5Es to Egypt.
Vance told the House panel that negotiations are
under way "to see if there is something that could be
done that would be helpful" to provide assurances that
aircraft sold to Arab states will not be used against Israel.
Three killed as plane lands in bay
Pensacola, Fla. — The landing seemed almost normal.
National Airlines' Flight 193 nosed down gently toward
Pensacola Airport, and a flight attendant announced the
Boeing 727 was about to land. Even the jolt as it smacked
into Escambia Bay was not the best clue that something
was wrong.
"I thought we were on land," said passenger Tom
Holmes.
"It wasn't until the water poured in up to my knees
that I realized we were in the bay."
But three persons were killed Monday night in the
belly-flop landing, three miles short of the runway.
Holmes, 37, of Pensacola, was among the 55 passen
gers and crew members who survived, most of them
rescued by a cool-headed tugboat pilot and mate who
rushed their tug and barge to the plane.
The National Transportation Safety Board set up a base
in this north Florida city, and said a preliminary report on
a possible cause for the crash and the deaths might be
ready in a few days.
Vietnam vet booked on three counts
Torrance — A 28-year-old war veteran who says his
"mind was messed up" by an explosion in Vietnam held
nine persons hostage and fired more than 100 shots
during a 13Vi-hour drama, police said yesterday.
Booked for investigation of robbery, assault with in
tent to commit murder and assault with a deadly weapon
was William John Dwyer Jr., 28, who as recently as
January was a patient in a Miami mental hospital, said
police Lt. James Papst.

Dwyer, carrying his 2-year-old daughter in his arms,
meekly walked out of a bullet-riddled jewelry store
shortly after sunrise yesterday and surrendered to offic
ers who had besieged the building since 6 p.m. Monday.
Detective Rollo Green said Dwyer told investigators
he was unemployed and was on a 100 per cent disability
pension from the military because of injuries he suffered
when a grenade or bomb exploded near him in Vietnam.
"He said his mind was messed up by the explosion,"
Green added.
Brown supports coal power plants
Pasadena — Gov. Jerry Brown supported yesterday the
development of coal-fired power plants in California as
long as the environment is protected.
Saying "this is an immediate challenge that must be
met," the governor announced he was creating a new
agency, the California Clean Fuels Coordinating Coun
cil, to oversee the sometimes conflicting actions of
boards that now control power sources.
He said the new agency will be responsible "to quickly
resolve problems of air pollution" associated with elec
tricity production.
The new agency, Brown said, will coordinate activities
of the state's Public Utilities Commission, Energy Com
mission, Air Resources Board, Water Resources Control
Board, Solid Waste Management Board and the state's
Washington, D.C., office.

Brown supports coal power plants
Pasadena — Gov. Jerry Brown supported yesterday the
development of coal-fired power plants in California as
long as the environment is protected.
Saying "this is an immediate challenge that must be

boards that now control power sources.

resolve problems of air pollution" associated with elec
tricity production.
The new agency, Brown said, will coordinate activities
of the state's Public Utilities Commission, Energy Com

Fighter sales to Israel discussed
Washington — The Carter administration insisted yes
terday the basic terms of its sale of jet fighters to Egypt,
Israel and Saudi Arabia will not be changed, but there
was growing talk of a compromise that would later send
additional war planes to Israel.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance told the House Interna
tional Relations Committee that private negotiations are
continuing with House and Senate members and that
"some members on both sides" have suggested such a
compromise.
Vance had met earlier in the day with members of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Jacob
Javits (R-N.Y.) left the session saying, "I believe we're on
a road which could lead to a settlement."
The senators said they had agreed not to discuss de
tails of the talks but Sen. Clifford Case (R-N.J.) asked
whether more fighters for Israel figured in the com
promise talks, replied: "If that isn't one of the elements,
I don't know what we're talking about."
President Jimmy Carter wants to sell $4.8 billion worth
of jet fighters. The deal calls for the sale of 15 F-15sand 75
F-16s to Israel, 60 F-15s to Saudi Arabia and 50 less sophis
ticated F-5Es to Egypt.
Vance told the House panel that negotiations are
under way "to see if there is something that could be
done that would be helpful" to provide assurances that
aircraft sold to Arab states will not be used against Israel.
Three killed as plane lands in bay
Pensacola, Fla. — The landing seemed almost normal.
National Airlines' Flight 193 nosed down gently toward
Pensacola Airport, and a flight attendant announced the
Boeing 727 was about to land. Even the jolt as it smacked
into Escambia Bay was not the best clue that something
was wrong.
"I thought we were on land," said passenger Tom
Holmes.
"It wasn't until the water poured in up to my knees
that I realized we were in the bay."
But three persons were killed Monday night in the
belly-flop landing, three miles short of the runway.
Holmes, 37, of Pensacola, was among the 55 passen
gers and crew members who survived, most of them
rescued by a cool-headed tugboat pilot and mate who
rushed their tug and barge to the plane.
The National Transportation Safety Board set up a base
in this north Florida city, and said a preliminary report on
a possible cause for the crash and the deaths might be
ready in a few days.
Vietnam vet booked on three counts
Torrance — A 28-year-old war veteran who says his
"mind was messed up" by an explosion in Vietnam held
nine persons hostage and fired more than 100 shots
during a 13Vi-hour drama, police said yesterday.
Booked for investigation of robbery, assault with in
tent to commit murder and assault with a deadly weapon
was William John Dwyer Jr., 28, who as recently as
January was a patient in a Miami mental hospital, said
police Lt. James Papst.

Dwyer, carrying his 2-year-old daughter in his arms,
meekly walked out of a bullet-riddled jewelry store
shortly after sunrise yesterday and surrendered to offic
ers who had besieged the building since 6 p.m. Monday.
Detective Rollo Green said Dwyer told investigators
he was unemployed and was on a 100 per cent disability
pension from the military because of injuries he suffered
when a grenade or bomb exploded near him in Vietnam.
"He said his mind was messed up by the explosion,"
Green added.
