# Dennis to be editor
## 
### 
Craig Dennis, 22, a junior
majoring in economics, was
elected last night to be editor of
Vol. 174 of The Stanford Daily.
His term will begin in Sep
tember and continue through
January 1979.
Dennis' home town is
Raymond, Wash., population
3100, "just 850 miles up Bayshore
Freeway â€” I live five blocks off
101." He is the second consecu
tive Daily editor from a
Washington town no one has ever
heard of.
Currently serving as Daily news
editor, Dennis began his jour
nalism career in junior high
school, as editor of the Baby Cull.
In high school he edited the Sea
gull (clever) and wrote for the
Raymond Herald.
He plans a career in newspaper
management. "My goal is to own
my own paper in four or five
years," Dennis says. "But it might
be a weekly."
Dennis took last year off from
Stanford to work six months as a
press assistant to Sen. Warren
Magnuson in Washington, D.C.,
and six months as a legislative as
sistant in Olympia. He says he has
no political affiliation. "I lived
with a Republican state attorney

general and worked for a Democ
ratic caucus chairman."
Dennis plans no major changes
for the Daily. "But I hope to insti
gate senior staff writers to get the
more investigative, better-written
stories that will appeal to our
readers," he says.
"You can expect a major staff
recruitment drive to attract inno
cent freshmen next fall."
