# Fee assessments must pass to maintain student activities
## 
### Craig Dennis 
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said yesterday that if the eight
fee assessments totaling approxi
mately $110,000 do not pass, it will be
"a loss deeply felt by a significant
number of students."
He added, "The fact is there are no
other sources of funds."
Voting for the special fee assess
ment election starts today and runs
through 4 p.m. tomorrow at five pol
ling places around campus.
Robert Rosenzweig, University
vice-president for public affairs, said
Monday it would be "predictable"
for the organizations to turn to the
University if the fees fail to pass this
week.
No strong case
But he added, "If the students do
not think enough of the organiza
tions to support them themselves, it
doesn't make a strong case for Uni
versity support. '
KZSU plans to broadcast live from
White Plaza at noon today in support
of the fee assessments. A live band
will be featured entertainment. The
Stanford Band was also rallying
around campus last night urging stu
dents to get out and vote.
Polling places will be set up at
Terman Engineering Building, the
French and Italian corner, post of
fice, deGuerre pool complex and
Meyer Library facing Stern Hall.
The fee propositions and the
amounts requested are: Program Fee
($2), Legal Counseling Office (LCO)
($3), Speakers Bureau ($1), Stanford
Committee on Political Education
($1), Academic Organizations Board
($1) and the Guest Professorship
Board ($1).
Important
Greg Larson, outgoing Council of
Presidents member, said, "The fee
assessments are something people
will not realize how important they
are until they are gone. Let's not lose

them."
The special election for the fee as
sessments was called by the ASSU
Senate when the eight assessments
failed to draw the constitutionally
required 20 per cent turnout in the
regular election three weeks ago.
The Band, Daily and KZSU assess
ments just passed by a few votes.
However, ail assessments at that
election received wide popular sup
port with most organizations being
approved by 70 to 80 per cent mar
gins.
'Fair'
Yesterday Larson stressed that the
fee collection process is "fair" by
noting that all fees are refundable
after being collected.
"The money that comes into these
student organizations are for the
most important student organiza
tions on campus," said Chuck Nel
son, Speakers Bureau chairman.
"For one dollar you get to see
some of the most interesting people
in the world â€” something the stu
dents are not necessarily getting

from their quarterly tuition bill," he
added.
Helps diversity
Referring to groups supported by
the program fee, Lyons said, "Some
of those activities are very important
to the principle of diversity here at
Stanford."
Speaking for the groups supported
by the program fee, senate chairper
son Fred Grethel said, "Without this
money, most of the groups will be in
serious financial trouble since they
get most or all of their funding from
the fee assessment."
Glen Schofield, attorney from the
LCO, said, "Our entire budget
comes from the fee assessment. We
know of no other source of funds.
The office will have to close if the
LCO fee assessment does not pass."
Without fee assessment funding
for the Publications Board, many of
the student-run literary or journalis
tic publications will "cease al
together or suffer severe cutbacks,"
explained Barry Parr, board chairper
son.
