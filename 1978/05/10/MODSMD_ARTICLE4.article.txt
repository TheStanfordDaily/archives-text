# Suspects arrested in three of four rape cases over past year
## 
### Robert Mauro News analysis 
Despite alleged police inefficiency in the handling of
rape cases, Dept. of Public Safety Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said that out of the single rape and three attempted
rapes that occurred on campus last year, only one sus
pect has not been apprehended.
That suspect, wanted for the attempted rape of a
Roble resident, was described as a male about 20 years
old with slender build, olive-colored complexion and an
Afro hairstyle.
However, Palo Alto Police Investigator Pam Crocker
described two rape suspects that are still at large in the
mid-Peninsula.
One, a Latin male in his 20s, about 5-foot-11 weighing
170-180 pounds with brown curly hair, is wanted in con
nection with an attempted rape on El Camino near Em
barcadero.
The other, described as a black male around 29, 5-10
with a slim build and short cropped hair, is wanted in
connection with four rapes of elderly women near Palo
Alto. According to Crocker, this rapist always enters the
house through a window around midnight. She added

that his crimes have been perpetrated about one month
apart.
According to FBI statistics, 52 per cent of all reported
sexual assaults are cleared by arrests. The offender is
most frequently white, under 25 and known to the vic
tim.
However, according to Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Investigator Sgt. Ken Bush, most of the county's rape
victims do not know their assailants.
There continues to be considerable confusion over
what constitutes rape or attempted rape. Last quarter,
the ASSU Task Force on Rape caused some commotion
when it reported three indecent exposures as at
tempted rapes.
According to the California Penal Code, rape is an act
of sexual intercourse, accomplished with a female not
the wife of the perpetrator, under one of several condi
tions:
— Where she is incapable, through lunacy or other
"unsoundness of mind" of giving legal consent;
— Where she is unconscious of the nature of the act or
believes that the person committing the act is her hus
band.
— Where she resists, but her resistance is overcomeby
force;
— Where she is prevented from resisting by threats of
great and immediate bodily harm accompanied by appa
rent power of execution, or by any intoxicating sub
stance administered without the victim's knowledge.
According to Santa Clara County Deputy District At
torney Dave Davies, . . resistance requires the actual
resistance of the woman or that she be prevented from
resisting by the threat of immediate use of physical force
with the present ability to use it."
According to Davies there are really two crimes com
monly referred to as attempted rape: assault with intent
to commit rape and attempted rape.
Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Randy
Hey, a sex crime prosecution specialist, said that to
prosecute for assault with intent, it is necessary to prove
that an actual physical assault occurred.
For an attempted rape prosecution, only the intent to
commit a rape must be shown. Davis added that assault
with intent to commit rape also entails a longer sen
tence.
"While rape sentences can be three, four or five years,

attempted rape is half that: 1 Vi, twoor2'/i years," Davies
said. "Assault with intent to rape is slightly more than
that: two, three or four years."
According to Hey, both crimes require that the sus
pect had "a specific intent to commit the crime, that he
made a direct but ineffectual attempt to commit it. It
must be clearly indicated, an unambiguous attempt."
Given the strenuous conditions for proving guilt, few
men are convicted of attempted rape. According to FBI
statistics, only 15 per cent of the reported rapes ever
result in a conviction. However, these strict conditions
are necessary because a full 19 per cent of the rapes
reported in 1976 proved to be unfounded.
According to Davies, "We generally charge attempts
with another offense because it's easier to prove. Quite
often we use false imprisonment or battery . . . out of
five cases you get maybe one or two convictions."
Despite the difficulties involved in the prosecution
and investigation of rapes and attempted rapes, Leah
Kaplan, assistant dean of students, pleaded that all vic
tims of sexual assaults report attacks to police.
"You've got to report it or the police can't do any
thing," Kaplan stressed. "If not in person, you can do it
through a neutral party, like my office, Huston House or
psychological services."

— Where she resists, but her resistance is overcomeby
force;
— Where she is prevented from resisting by threats of
great and immediate bodily harm accompanied by appa
rent power of execution, or by any intoxicating sub
stance administered without the victim's knowledge.
According to Santa Clara County Deputy District At
torney Dave Davies, . . resistance requires the actual
resistance of the woman or that she be prevented from
resisting by the threat of immediate use of physical force
with the present ability to use it."
According to Davies there are really two crimes com
monly referred to as attempted rape: assault with intent
to commit rape and attempted rape.
Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Randy
Hey, a sex crime prosecution specialist, said that to
prosecute for assault with intent, it is necessary to prove
that an actual physical assault occurred.
For an attempted rape prosecution, only the intent to
commit a rape must be shown. Davis added that assault
with intent to commit rape also entails a longer sen
tence.
"While rape sentences can be three, four or five years,

attempted rape is half that: 1 Vi, twoor2'/i years," Davies
said. "Assault with intent to rape is slightly more than
that: two, three or four years."
According to Hey, both crimes require that the sus
pect had "a specific intent to commit the crime, that he
made a direct but ineffectual attempt to commit it. It
must be clearly indicated, an unambiguous attempt."
Given the strenuous conditions for proving guilt, few
men are convicted of attempted rape. According to FBI
statistics, only 15 per cent of the reported rapes ever
result in a conviction. However, these strict conditions
are necessary because a full 19 per cent of the rapes
reported in 1976 proved to be unfounded.
According to Davies, "We generally charge attempts
with another offense because it's easier to prove. Quite
often we use false imprisonment or battery . . . out of
five cases you get maybe one or two convictions."
Despite the difficulties involved in the prosecution
and investigation of rapes and attempted rapes, Leah
Kaplan, assistant dean of students, pleaded that all vic
tims of sexual assaults report attacks to police.
"You've got to report it or the police can't do any
thing," Kaplan stressed. "If not in person, you can do it
through a neutral party, like my office, Huston House or
psychological services."
Despite alleged police inefficiency in the handling of
rape cases, Dept. of Public Safety Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said that out of the single rape and three attempted
rapes that occurred on campus last year, only one sus
pect has not been apprehended.
That suspect, wanted for the attempted rape of a
Roble resident, was described as a male about 20 years
old with slender build, olive-colored complexion and an
Afro hairstyle.
However, Palo Alto Police Investigator Pam Crocker
described two rape suspects that are still at large in the
mid-Peninsula.
One, a Latin male in his 20s, about 5-foot-11 weighing
170-180 pounds with brown curly hair, is wanted in con
nection with an attempted rape on El Camino near Em
barcadero.
The other, described as a black male around 29, 5-10
with a slim build and short cropped hair, is wanted in
connection with four rapes of elderly women near Palo
Alto. According to Crocker, this rapist always enters the
house through a window around midnight. She added

that his crimes have been perpetrated about one month
apart.
According to FBI statistics, 52 per cent of all reported
sexual assaults are cleared by arrests. The offender is
most frequently white, under 25 and known to the vic
tim.
However, according to Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Investigator Sgt. Ken Bush, most of the county's rape
victims do not know their assailants.
There continues to be considerable confusion over
what constitutes rape or attempted rape. Last quarter,
the ASSU Task Force on Rape caused some commotion
when it reported three indecent exposures as at
tempted rapes.
According to the California Penal Code, rape is an act
of sexual intercourse, accomplished with a female not
the wife of the perpetrator, under one of several condi
tions:
— Where she is incapable, through lunacy or other
"unsoundness of mind" of giving legal consent;
— Where she is unconscious of the nature of the act or
believes that the person committing the act is her hus
band.
— Where she resists, but her resistance is overcomeby
force;
— Where she is prevented from resisting by threats of
great and immediate bodily harm accompanied by appa
rent power of execution, or by any intoxicating sub
stance administered without the victim's knowledge.
