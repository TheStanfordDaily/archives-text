# Addition completed 'within six weeks'
## 
### Emily Sachar 
Final construction on the
bookstore addition will be complete
within six weeks, according to Rose
Sims, operations manager of the
Stanford Bookstore. The addition
will be in use by the end of June, she
added.
Although the outside structure has
been finished forseveral weeks, light
fixtures, carpeting, paneling and
painting jobs are still being com
pleted.
Construction began in August 1976
and was scheduled to be completed
by late March or early April of this
year.
"We're behind schedule because
construction just has its problems,"
Sims said. "Sometimes our supplies
didn't arrive on time. In other cases,
the construction companies simply
didn't estimate that certain tasks
would take as long as they did."
In addition, small aspects of con
struction had to be rebuilt because
they failed to meet University and
county inspection, according to
Sims.
The project is costing $2.9 million.
The University approved a loan of $2
million to the bookstore before con
struction began. The bookstore will
obtain this money soon, according to
Sims.

The remaining $.9 million came
from bookstore reserve funds.
Many services will be rearranged
with the new addition's completion.
The entire main floor of the present
store will hold general and paper
back books while textbooks will be
located on the addition's top floor.
The cash registers will remain at the
entrance of the store.
On the main floor of the addition
will be an expanded stock of student
supplies, clothing and other general
merchandise.
"There will be much more selec
tion than we currently have," Sims
said. "We're hoping our business
will greatly increase because of this."
The balcony of the existing store
will have a lounge for customers near
the textbook information window.
Technical reference book sections
will also be expanded, according to
Sims.
Sims said she expects that there
will be some expansion of staff after
the addition is completed. Presently,
the bookstore's accounting office
and warehouse are located in Palo
Alto but Sims said that after the addi
tion is completed, the warehouse
will be in the basement and the ac
counting office will be moved to the
back corner of the addition's main
floor.
