# Ties with South Africa outlined
## Accomplice in apartheid: Israel 
### 
During the past year students here
have become increasingly con
cerned about South African apar
theid. They have expressed this con
cern with sit-ins, protest marches
and "awareness sessions." Con
sequently, many of them can now tell
you detailed facts about South Afri
ca's domestic politics . . . yet, one
thing they are not aware of is the
strong support South Africa receives
from Israel.
The government of South Africa is
infamous as one of the most repres
sive and racist governments in the
history of mankind. Its rac ism has not
been directed against Blacks alone.
During the years of the Nazi
Holocaust, the Nationalist Party of
South Africa instigated a local cam
paign of anti-Semitism.
John Vorster, South Africa's prime
minister, was at that time a general in
this nationalist movement, which
opposed the Allied war efforts
against Nazi Germany.
It is a shameful irony of history that
this man, who has never publicly
repudiated his pro-Nazi stand, vis
ited Israel in 1976, where he received
the only official state welcome ac
corded him by any country (with the
possible exception of Rhodesia).
There he laid a wreath at the Yad
Vashem Memorial in Jerusalem for
the victims of the Holocaust. Even
the pro-government Jerusalem Post
protested that it was not "for the
Jews to become associated with a
former Nazi sympathizer."
The paradoxical relationship bet
ween South Africa and Israel can be
understood in terms of the
similarities between apartheid and
Zionism. In The Two Faces of Apar
theid, Paul Giniewski, a prominent
French Zionist writer, advances a
new theory in support of apartheid.
Apartheid, with its concept of Ban
tustan (separate, inferior homelands
for the Blacks), he argues, is nothing
more than "Bantu Zionism."
In 1961, a year of relatively strained
relations between South Africa and
Israel due to Israel's courtship of a
number of Black African countries,
the South African Die Transvaler
asked: "... is there any real differ
ence between the way that the
people of Israel are trying to maintain
themselves amid non-Jewish
peoples and the way the Afrikaner is
trying to remain what he is? The
people of Israel base themselves
upon the Old Testament to explain
why they do not wish to mix with

other people; the Afrikaner does this
too."
Mutual recognition of their similar
origins and circumstances has moti
vated Israel and South Africa to de
velop various means of cooperation
on political, economic and military
levels. In 1948 South Africa was
among the first governments to give
de facto recognition of the nascent
state of Israel.
Israel inspires apartheid
In 1953 South African prime minis
ter Daniel Malan, the first head of
government to visit Israel, returned
to his country with the message that
Israel could be a source of inspira
tion to the apartheid state. From the
early days of Zionism, financial sup
port from the South African Jewish
community has been of great value.
The Encyclopedia Judaica states:
"From 1926 South Africa occupied
the second place in the world (after
the U.S.) in (Zionist) fund raising . . .
its per capita contribution . . . was
by far the largest."
Ties between the two countries
grew stronger over the years. The
1967 and 1973 wars brought them
closer than ever. A South African
general consulate was established in
Tel Aviv in 1971, and it became a full
fledged embassy in 1975. Today, rela
tions between the two countries
seem to have reached their zenith.
This is confirmed by the fact that Is
raeli Prime Minister Menahem
Begin presides over the South Africa
Friendship Association.
The strongest ties between the two
countries are economic. From 1965
to 1974 the value of Israeli exports to
South Africa grew from $2.7 million
to $28.7 million, while that of imports
from South Africa grew from $4.3
million to $43.1 million.
The diamond cutting industry,
which represents about 34 per cent
of Israel's total exports, imports its
raw material from South Africa, mak
ing the two countries primary
partners in trade. Moreover, Israel
has encouraged South African in
vestment in its economy by raising
the ceiling on South African capital
from 10 million rand in 1974 to 32
million rand in 1977.
According to Newsweek (August
23, 1976), the two countries plan to
cooperate in building a "railroad, a
steel-rolling mill, and a hydro
electric plant that will use Mediterra
nean water and divert it into the
Dead Sea." In turn, Israel has placed
an order for large quantities of South

African coal.
Of particular importance is an ag
reement by which Israel will import
semi-finished products from South
African countries which have trade
embargoes on South Africa. Futher
more, as the Rand Daily Mail of April
14, 1976 explains, the agreement is
designed to "take advantage of Is
rael's free-trade agreements with the
(European) Community and the Un
ited States."
Fighting side by side
The military relationship between
the two states dates back to 1948
when South African Zionist volun
teers fought on the side of the Zionist
settlers in Palestine. The same holds
for the wars of 1956, 1967 and 1973. In
the latter, 1500 Jews of South African
descent took part in combat, and at
least one jet fighter of South African
origin was shot down over the Suez
canal.
According to representatives of
the South West African People's Or
ganization (SWAPO), Israeli soldiers
are actually involved in the fighting
against their forces in the frontier
areas between Namibia and Angola.
During his 1975 visit to South Afri
ca, General Meir Amit, former chief
of the Israeli secret service, declared
that Israeli officers, "regularly lec
ture before an audience of South Af
rican officers about modern warfare
and anti-guerrilla tactics."
Cooperation between the two
countries in the area of arms man
ufacture is also strong. South Africa
manufactures the Israeli-invented
Uzi submachine gun under license
granted through Belgium. On Au
gust 9, 1976, Kol Israel, the Israeli
radio station, disclosed that Israel is
building long range boats for South
Africa. The vessels are to be armed
with sea-to-sea missiles.
In addition, there are reports from
the New York Times (August 18,1976)
of an "arms deal" which is to include
"up to two dozen Israeli-built Kfir jet
planes." More ominous is a report
from the Wall Street Journal of April
23,1976 that South Africa is preparing
to "supply Israel with uranium."
Palestinians, Blacks oppressed
The cooperation between South
Africa and Israel is too strong to re
main unnoticed. It is bound to have a
major influence on the prospects of
peace and justice in both the Middle
East and Africa. Therefore, the
movement against apartheid must go
hand in hand with that against its ac
complice, the Zionist policies of the

state of Israel.
The Palestinian Arab living under
Israeli occupation is oppressed in
basically the same way as the black
living in Soweto. Neither peace nor
justice is possible in Soweto or Pales
tine without the full recognition of
the national, economic, and human
rights of the Arabs and Blacks who
live there.

ited Israel in 1976, where he received
the only official state welcome ac
corded him by any country (with the
possible exception of Rhodesia).
There he laid a wreath at the Yad
Vashem Memorial in Jerusalem for
the victims of the Holocaust. Even
the pro-government Jerusalem Post
protested that it was not "for the
Jews to become associated with a
former Nazi sympathizer."
The paradoxical relationship bet
ween South Africa and Israel can be
understood in terms of the
similarities between apartheid and
Zionism. In The Two Faces of Apar
theid, Paul Giniewski, a prominent
French Zionist writer, advances a
new theory in support of apartheid.
Apartheid, with its concept of Ban
tustan (separate, inferior homelands
for the Blacks), he argues, is nothing
more than "Bantu Zionism."
In 1961, a year of relatively strained
relations between South Africa and
Israel due to Israel's courtship of a
number of Black African countries,
the South African Die Transvaler
asked: "... is there any real differ
ence between the way that the
people of Israel are trying to maintain
themselves amid non-Jewish
peoples and the way the Afrikaner is
trying to remain what he is? The
people of Israel base themselves
upon the Old Testament to explain
why they do not wish to mix with

other people; the Afrikaner does this
too."
Mutual recognition of their similar
origins and circumstances has moti
vated Israel and South Africa to de
velop various means of cooperation
on political, economic and military
levels. In 1948 South Africa was
among the first governments to give
de facto recognition of the nascent
state of Israel.
Israel inspires apartheid
In 1953 South African prime minis
ter Daniel Malan, the first head of
government to visit Israel, returned
to his country with the message that
Israel could be a source of inspira
tion to the apartheid state. From the
early days of Zionism, financial sup
port from the South African Jewish
community has been of great value.
The Encyclopedia Judaica states:
"From 1926 South Africa occupied
the second place in the world (after
the U.S.) in (Zionist) fund raising . . .
its per capita contribution . . . was
by far the largest."
Ties between the two countries
grew stronger over the years. The
1967 and 1973 wars brought them
closer than ever. A South African
general consulate was established in
Tel Aviv in 1971, and it became a full
fledged embassy in 1975. Today, rela
tions between the two countries
seem to have reached their zenith.
This is confirmed by the fact that Is
raeli Prime Minister Menahem
Begin presides over the South Africa
Friendship Association.
The strongest ties between the two
countries are economic. From 1965
to 1974 the value of Israeli exports to
South Africa grew from $2.7 million
to $28.7 million, while that of imports
from South Africa grew from $4.3
million to $43.1 million.
The diamond cutting industry,
which represents about 34 per cent
of Israel's total exports, imports its
raw material from South Africa, mak
ing the two countries primary
partners in trade. Moreover, Israel
has encouraged South African in
vestment in its economy by raising
the ceiling on South African capital
from 10 million rand in 1974 to 32
million rand in 1977.
According to Newsweek (August
23, 1976), the two countries plan to
cooperate in building a "railroad, a
steel-rolling mill, and a hydro
electric plant that will use Mediterra
nean water and divert it into the
Dead Sea." In turn, Israel has placed
an order for large quantities of South

African coal.
Of particular importance is an ag
reement by which Israel will import
semi-finished products from South
African countries which have trade
embargoes on South Africa. Futher
more, as the Rand Daily Mail of April
14, 1976 explains, the agreement is
designed to "take advantage of Is
rael's free-trade agreements with the
(European) Community and the Un
ited States."
Fighting side by side
The military relationship between
the two states dates back to 1948
when South African Zionist volun
teers fought on the side of the Zionist
settlers in Palestine. The same holds
for the wars of 1956, 1967 and 1973. In
the latter, 1500 Jews of South African
descent took part in combat, and at
least one jet fighter of South African
origin was shot down over the Suez
canal.
According to representatives of
the South West African People's Or
ganization (SWAPO), Israeli soldiers
are actually involved in the fighting
against their forces in the frontier
areas between Namibia and Angola.
During his 1975 visit to South Afri
ca, General Meir Amit, former chief
of the Israeli secret service, declared
that Israeli officers, "regularly lec
ture before an audience of South Af
rican officers about modern warfare
and anti-guerrilla tactics."
Cooperation between the two
countries in the area of arms man
ufacture is also strong. South Africa
manufactures the Israeli-invented
Uzi submachine gun under license
granted through Belgium. On Au
gust 9, 1976, Kol Israel, the Israeli
radio station, disclosed that Israel is
building long range boats for South
Africa. The vessels are to be armed
with sea-to-sea missiles.
In addition, there are reports from
the New York Times (August 18,1976)
of an "arms deal" which is to include
"up to two dozen Israeli-built Kfir jet
planes." More ominous is a report
from the Wall Street Journal of April
23,1976 that South Africa is preparing
to "supply Israel with uranium."
Palestinians, Blacks oppressed
The cooperation between South
Africa and Israel is too strong to re
main unnoticed. It is bound to have a
major influence on the prospects of
peace and justice in both the Middle
East and Africa. Therefore, the
movement against apartheid must go
hand in hand with that against its ac
complice, the Zionist policies of the

state of Israel.
The Palestinian Arab living under
Israeli occupation is oppressed in
basically the same way as the black
living in Soweto. Neither peace nor
justice is possible in Soweto or Pales
tine without the full recognition of
the national, economic, and human
rights of the Arabs and Blacks who
live there.

During the past year students here
have become increasingly con

theid. They have expressed this con
cern with sit-ins, protest marches
and "awareness sessions." Con
sequently, many of them can now tell
you detailed facts about South Afri
ca's domestic politics . . . yet, one
thing they are not aware of is the
strong support South Africa receives
from Israel.
The government of South Africa is
infamous as one of the most repres
sive and racist governments in the
history of mankind. Its rac ism has not
been directed against Blacks alone.
During the years of the Nazi
Holocaust, the Nationalist Party of
South Africa instigated a local cam
paign of anti-Semitism.
John Vorster, South Africa's prime
minister, was at that time a general in
this nationalist movement, which
opposed the Allied war efforts
against Nazi Germany.

asked: "... is there any real differ
ence between the way that the
people of Israel are trying to maintain
themselves amid non-Jewish
peoples and the way the Afrikaner is
trying to remain what he is? The
people of Israel base themselves
upon the Old Testament to explain
why they do not wish to mix with

other people; the Afrikaner does this
too."
Mutual recognition of their similar
origins and circumstances has moti
vated Israel and South Africa to de
velop various means of cooperation
on political, economic and military
levels. In 1948 South Africa was
among the first governments to give
de facto recognition of the nascent
state of Israel.
Israel inspires apartheid
In 1953 South African prime minis
ter Daniel Malan, the first head of
government to visit Israel, returned
to his country with the message that
Israel could be a source of inspira
tion to the apartheid state. From the
early days of Zionism, financial sup
port from the South African Jewish
community has been of great value.
The Encyclopedia Judaica states:
"From 1926 South Africa occupied
the second place in the world (after
the U.S.) in (Zionist) fund raising . . .
its per capita contribution . . . was
by far the largest."
Ties between the two countries
grew stronger over the years. The
1967 and 1973 wars brought them
closer than ever. A South African
general consulate was established in
Tel Aviv in 1971, and it became a full
fledged embassy in 1975. Today, rela
tions between the two countries
seem to have reached their zenith.
This is confirmed by the fact that Is
raeli Prime Minister Menahem
Begin presides over the South Africa
Friendship Association.
The strongest ties between the two
countries are economic. From 1965
to 1974 the value of Israeli exports to
South Africa grew from $2.7 million
to $28.7 million, while that of imports
from South Africa grew from $4.3
million to $43.1 million.
The diamond cutting industry,
which represents about 34 per cent
of Israel's total exports, imports its
raw material from South Africa, mak
ing the two countries primary
partners in trade. Moreover, Israel
has encouraged South African in
vestment in its economy by raising
the ceiling on South African capital
from 10 million rand in 1974 to 32
million rand in 1977.
According to Newsweek (August
23, 1976), the two countries plan to
cooperate in building a "railroad, a
steel-rolling mill, and a hydro
electric plant that will use Mediterra
nean water and divert it into the
Dead Sea." In turn, Israel has placed
an order for large quantities of South

African coal.
Of particular importance is an ag
reement by which Israel will import
semi-finished products from South
African countries which have trade
embargoes on South Africa. Futher
more, as the Rand Daily Mail of April
14, 1976 explains, the agreement is
designed to "take advantage of Is
rael's free-trade agreements with the
(European) Community and the Un
ited States."
Fighting side by side
The military relationship between
the two states dates back to 1948
when South African Zionist volun
teers fought on the side of the Zionist
settlers in Palestine. The same holds
for the wars of 1956, 1967 and 1973. In
the latter, 1500 Jews of South African
descent took part in combat, and at
least one jet fighter of South African
origin was shot down over the Suez
canal.
According to representatives of
the South West African People's Or
ganization (SWAPO), Israeli soldiers
are actually involved in the fighting
against their forces in the frontier
areas between Namibia and Angola.
During his 1975 visit to South Afri
ca, General Meir Amit, former chief
of the Israeli secret service, declared
that Israeli officers, "regularly lec
ture before an audience of South Af
rican officers about modern warfare
and anti-guerrilla tactics."
Cooperation between the two
countries in the area of arms man
ufacture is also strong. South Africa
manufactures the Israeli-invented
Uzi submachine gun under license
granted through Belgium. On Au
gust 9, 1976, Kol Israel, the Israeli
radio station, disclosed that Israel is
building long range boats for South
Africa. The vessels are to be armed
with sea-to-sea missiles.
In addition, there are reports from
the New York Times (August 18,1976)
of an "arms deal" which is to include
"up to two dozen Israeli-built Kfir jet
planes." More ominous is a report
from the Wall Street Journal of April
23,1976 that South Africa is preparing
to "supply Israel with uranium."
Palestinians, Blacks oppressed
The cooperation between South
Africa and Israel is too strong to re
main unnoticed. It is bound to have a
major influence on the prospects of
peace and justice in both the Middle
East and Africa. Therefore, the
movement against apartheid must go
hand in hand with that against its ac
complice, the Zionist policies of the

state of Israel.
The Palestinian Arab living under
Israeli occupation is oppressed in
basically the same way as the black
living in Soweto. Neither peace nor
justice is possible in Soweto or Pales
tine without the full recognition of
the national, economic, and human
rights of the Arabs and Blacks who
live there.

During the past year students here
have become increasingly con
cerned about South African apar
theid. They have expressed this con
cern with sit-ins, protest marches
and "awareness sessions." Con
sequently, many of them can now tell
you detailed facts about South Afri
ca's domestic politics . . . yet, one
thing they are not aware of is the
strong support South Africa receives
from Israel.
The government of South Africa is
infamous as one of the most repres
sive and racist governments in the
history of mankind. Its rac ism has not
been directed against Blacks alone.
During the years of the Nazi
Holocaust, the Nationalist Party of
South Africa instigated a local cam
paign of anti-Semitism.
John Vorster, South Africa's prime
minister, was at that time a general in
this nationalist movement, which
opposed the Allied war efforts
against Nazi Germany.
It is a shameful irony of history that
this man, who has never publicly
repudiated his pro-Nazi stand, vis
ited Israel in 1976, where he received
the only official state welcome ac
corded him by any country (with the
possible exception of Rhodesia).
There he laid a wreath at the Yad
Vashem Memorial in Jerusalem for
the victims of the Holocaust. Even
the pro-government Jerusalem Post
protested that it was not "for the
Jews to become associated with a
former Nazi sympathizer."
The paradoxical relationship bet
ween South Africa and Israel can be
understood in terms of the
similarities between apartheid and
Zionism. In The Two Faces of Apar
theid, Paul Giniewski, a prominent
French Zionist writer, advances a
new theory in support of apartheid.
Apartheid, with its concept of Ban
tustan (separate, inferior homelands
for the Blacks), he argues, is nothing
more than "Bantu Zionism."
In 1961, a year of relatively strained
relations between South Africa and
Israel due to Israel's courtship of a
number of Black African countries,
the South African Die Transvaler
asked: "... is there any real differ
ence between the way that the
people of Israel are trying to maintain
themselves amid non-Jewish
peoples and the way the Afrikaner is
trying to remain what he is? The
people of Israel base themselves
upon the Old Testament to explain
