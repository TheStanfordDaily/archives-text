## 'Let the meaning choose the word' 
### 
Byrne and Burtle

On Feb. 2, the Faculty Senate re
jected their steering committee's re
solution to agree "in spirit" with an
ASSU Senate resolution discourag
ing the use of sexist language. An
alternative resolution was passed,
reaffirming the senate's position in
favor of the "social and economic
equality of women."
Only a week ago, the student body
failed to ratify a constitutional
amendment eliminating sexist lan
guage from the ASSU constitution. A
similar proposal failed three years
ago.
Students here either feel that the
Women's Movement is inflicting
meaningless mayhem upon the lan
guage or that such changes are only
petty reforms.
As proponents of non-sexist lan
guage, we do not wish to debase lan
guage or abandon proper grammar,
but hope to make it more precise,
reasonable, and reflective of social
change. Language is a human institu
tion, and must adapt to the needs of
the people and society that use it.
We have no illusions that the
eradication of sexist language will
end sexism in our culture. The use of
"chair" or "chairperson" instead of
"chairman" is a minor act in itself,
and taken alone, doesn't constitute a
dramatic move toward sexual equal
ity.
The choice of non-sexist language
is essentially a symbolic act, since
language is but a set of symbols cho
sen by community consent But
through these symbols, the inequal
ity of women and sexism are cultur
ally reinforced and extended to other
institutions besides language.
Language indicated change
When people say they support
women's equality, but that change
should be more "fundamental" than
using non-sexist language, they mis
understand how basic, how funda
mental, an indicator of social change
that language can be.
Language has great social power to
define and influence cultural norms.
It is particularly influential because
not only does it define, it also con
notes. This effect of sexist language
is pervasive and insidious â€” so per

vasive that it must be talked about, so
insidious that it must be ended.
When a girl reads in the British
Junior Encyclopedia that "Man is the
highest form of life on earth . . . His
superior intelligence combined with
certain physical characteristics, have
enabled man to achieve things that
are impossible for other animals,"
she is likely to suspect that she may
not be included in this laudable
category.
If her expectation and achieve
ment levels are measured by diffe
rent standards than men's in later
life, her suspicions will be con
firmed.
In a subtle manner, sexist language
excludes women, or, at best, incor
porates them only by implication.
Take Webster's primary definition of
the word "man," the generic term in
common use. Webster's reads, "1) a

human being; esp: an adult male
human being."
Webster inaccurate
In a sense, Webster's definition is
sadly accurate, for in almost every
realm of human affairs the majority
of active participants are males un
less specifically referred to as
female: mother, wife, housekeeper,
secretary, nurse, teacher.
The generic terms "man" and 'he"
by definition refer especially to men,
consequently reducing women to a
subsidiary role.
Although some of us may mean
"person" and not "man" most of us
often do not infer "person" from
"man." While it is indeterminate
how far language influences the
achievement and self-image of wo
men, it is one factor among many
limiting efforts to attain social and
economic equality of the sexes.

A classic argument is that non
sexist terminology is ugly and cum
bersome. However, there are easy
alternatives coming into common
use. ' Person," "people" and "hu
manity" can be used instead of
"man." "They" is increasingly substi
tuted for "he."
The fact is that there is almost al
ways a non-sexist alternative built
into the language, and the substitu
tion can be suprisingly easy.
We do acknowledge that the
generic use of "he" is generally accu
rate when speaking in a historical
sense, since it literally was a man's
world in almost every sphere that is
documented by historical record.
Rewriting history
Feminists are not determined to
rewrite history by the substitution of
non-sexist language, but to draw at
tention to the omission of women in
standard history and to research and
write our own.
Finally, we must dispel any notions
that words such as "boycott" and
"mandate" are sexist vocabulary.
Critics who reduce the case for non
sexist language to this level are guilty
of trivialization.
There may be some legitimacy to
the argument that legislation of lan
guage (such as the ASSU resolutions)
impinges on personal freedoms. We
concede it poses certain problems,
and if someone uses non-sexist lan
guage it doesn't necessarily make
them a non-sexist person. (See how
easy that was? A non-sexist sentence,
folks.)
Yet, although the adoption of
non-sexist language may be initially
cumbersome, it is also socially
"cumbersome" to grant equal rights
to women. If we do recognize the
need for social and economic equal
ity of men and women, our language
should reflect it.
As George Orwell put it, "Let the
meaning choose the word and not
the other way around."
