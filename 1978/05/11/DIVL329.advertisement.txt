That's what Alison Bernhard, Resident of Larkin, Stern Hall, said to Mark
Triska, the Stanford Community Representative for Northern California
Savings and Loan Association.
"I was tired of having to wait in long lines at the bank, and knew that I
could get the highest interest possible at NCS. I was very pleased with
the amount of interest that I discovered I already earned for only one
quarter. It's also nice to have a Prestige Card, allowing me to make
Telephone Transfers and to take advantage of all the other many free
services of NCS."
Give Mark a call and he'll help you to start your own Prestige Savings
Account at NCS.
