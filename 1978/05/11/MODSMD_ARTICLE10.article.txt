# Thailand's controlling junta
## Supporting odious regimes 
### 
Randy Stross

"l've worked day and night to
make sure that a concern for human
rights is woven through everything
our government does," President
Jimmy Carter disclosed at his De
cember 16 press conference. Unct
ous sincerity is not enough, how
ever, if good 'intentions' are not
translated into action. The continued
flow of U.S. military and economic
aid to a brutal military junta control
ling Thailand certainly does not
strengthen the Administration's cre
dibility.
It's a commonplace that the United
States continues to support a host of
odious regimes around the world
who are dependent upon foreign aid
and arms for securing and maintain
ing power. In Thailand's case, 26
years of CIA and Department of
Defense-directed development of
Thai 'defense' forces provided the
right-wing with the power to shatter
Thailand's brief era of democracy
(1973-1976). In the fall of 1976, a milit
ary coup, accompanied by a great
deal of bloodshed and an estimated
10,000 arrests, brought martial law
back to Thailand.
The junta has subsequently pur
sued counter-insurgency programs
in the countryside and implemented

anti-labor legislation in the cities. But
of all the repressive policies, no
example better illustrates the ab
sence of 'human rights' than the sad
plight of the 'Bangkok 18.' A group of
young people, mostly college stu
dents, with an average age of 22, the
'Bangkok 18' were among the
thousands arrested in late 1976. They
are being tried in a military court,
without right to cross-examination
and appeal, and face death sen
tences.
Conspiracy
The prosecution's lengthy indict
ment charges a conspiracy to violate
the Communist Suppression Act,
e.g., "arranging for a People's Re
public of China exhibit at Thammasat
University with the aim of moving the
public toward favoring communism
and hating the government." Six of
the eighteen are also charged with
lese majesty, offenses against the
king.
What is particularly innovative
about the prosecution's case is the
retroactive application of military
jurisdiction. All of the acts charged
occured while the 1974 Constitution
was in effect and prior to the coup.
Many of the acts charged in the in
dictment, such as distributing litera-

ture, were protected activities at the
time they occurred. The military tri
bunal has refused to allow the case to
be tried before a civilian court, with
all the attendant rights accorded de
fendants under Thai Law.
Confidence lacking
The military tribunal consists of
three members: an Air Force general
(non-lawyer), an Army colonel (non
lawyer), and a Navy captain (a milit
ary attorney). Leonard Weinglass,
who recently visited Bangkok to try
to observe the trial, has pointed out,
"Since the judges were selected by
one of the military officers involved
in the coup, confidence in their
being able to render a fair verdict is
totally lacking."
The defendants have been held
without bail for more than a year. But
they had best not be impatient. After
all, it was three months after they
were jailed before they were charged
under the Suppression Act and it was
almost a year before they were ar
raigned. It is estimated that the trial
itself will take one to three years.
Press censorship, book burnings,
widespread firings of university pro
fessors and a strangulation of politi
cal debate are other features of the
junta's rule that should not be ig
nored.
Refusing recognition
The U.S. government refuses to
recognize the human rights prob
lems in Thailand. When Walter
Mondale visited Bangkok two weeks
ago, he announced U.S. agreement
to supply new military hardware that
the junta had requested. It is unfor
tunate that the administration still re
fuses to implement its avowed con
cern for human rights and to stop
subordinating any and all other is
sues to 'national security' aims.
At the Bangkok airport, while
Mondale beamed as 33 saronged
Thai girls sprinkled flower petals in
his path, the military junta itself had
good reason to smile, too.
