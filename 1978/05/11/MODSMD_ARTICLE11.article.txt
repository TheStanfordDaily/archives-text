Credit for work
1 was pretty surprised to see the
"Four Professors" cartoon on a re
cent SCRIP flyer, not only because I
didn't think they read the Chaparral,
but because I thought they had more
respect for the rights of others. This
cartoon was drawn by Frank Hewitt
'47 and has been used in virtually
every issue of the Chaparral since
then. It is the property of the Ham
mer and Coffin Society and is as
vmuch a trademark of the Chaparral as
our logotype, staffbox, or the Old
Boy.
SCRIP does not seem to respect
the rights of either editors or pub
lishers who have spent a great deal of
time perfecting their work. It is not
to be clipped every time someone
wants to make a point. This is espe
cially true of a political cause with
which the artist may not agree.
I and several other editors have
spent years making the Chaparral the
largest publisher of high-quality
graphics on campus. We are not
about to have that stolen from us by
every weekend activist with a $10
offset budget in his pocket.
Anyone wishing to use an illustra
tion from the Chaparral (or any pub
lication for that matter) should re
quest permission. All we want is cre
dit for our work.

Muddling issues
Tony Becker's column (Daily, May
8) is a masterpiece of muddled is
sues. By means of factual inac
curacies and a rather questionable
analogy between this University's
participation in the repression and
exploitation of black South Africans
and a case of acne, Becker succeeds
in distracting our attention from
what is really at issue.
The question the trustees' actions
have raised is not just whether or not
to vote for corporate withdrawal
from South Africa. The question is
also how are decisions to be made in
this univeristy and by what criteria.
Are students expected to stand back
and watch while the trustees disre
gard the recommendations of the
very people they appointed to do in
depth research and make recom
mendations?
We would like to make three
comments in response to Becker's
article. First, he implies, and the
Daily headline states, that Whitson,
Funk, and the others responsible for
the boycott of the Senior Pledge
Program, including ourselves, are
representatives of SCRIP. In fact, we
have no affiliation with SCRIP. We
are simply people who have become
concerned at the way policy deci
sions are being made in this univer
sity.
Secondly, Becker argues that there
is no evidence for claiming over
whelming sentiment against the trus
tees' decision, but then goes on to
compare a donation boycott on the
part of those who are opposed, to
cutting the university's carotid artery
of cash. If we are such a small minor
ity as he claims then our boycott is
not likely to so much as nick that
imposing vessel.
If, instead, there are enough of us
to make our boycott felt, then we are
a substantial part of the Stanford
community and our opinions should
be heard. We have chosen to boycott
donations because for too long the
university has refused to listen to ar
guments based on reason and con
viction.
Thirdly, Becker seeks to trivialize
the whole issue of investment re
sponsibility by speaking of it as a
mere surface blemish, in the same
league with the quarrels over the
team mascot. Such a blemish, he ar
gues, should not be allowed to inter
fere with the high and holy purpose
of turning out engineers, doctors
and teachers.
Is it mere lunatic idealism to be
lieve that a university is more than a
vocational school, to believe that it
ought to impart a concern for values
as well as technical skills? If the Uni
versity acts in ways we feel to be seri
ously wrong, we cannot excuse it on
the ground that the University has
more important things to do.
When the Univeristy abnegates its
role in the area of values and social
issues, its role as a teacher of skills
becomes meaningless. We feel that
the University's disregard of the CIR
recommendations is an action too
serious to be dismissed as a blemish,
and we refuse to give our tacit en
dorsement to it by donating funds.
We urge all concerned seniors to
join us in boycotting the Senior
Pledge Program.
