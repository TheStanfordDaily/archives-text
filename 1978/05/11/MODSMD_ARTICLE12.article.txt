# Women challenge Himalayan peak
## 
### Libby Vernon 
A woman's place is on top.
Of what?
Annapurna I, 26,545 feet.
Ten women mountain clim
bers, age 20 to 49, hope to get
there.
Several aspects of the An
napurna expedition will be
significant firsts. For example,
it is the first American expedi
tion to attempt the Himalayan
Annapurna I, the 10th highest
mountain in the world.
If successful, the expedition
will put the first American
woman above 26,000 feet.
In addition, the expedition is
planning to use two Nepalese
women as sherpas — porters
who assist with climbing at
high altitudes.
While it is common for
women to serve as porters at

low altitudes, never have na
tive women participated in an
expedition at a high altitude.
Five of the American women
are from the Bay Area.
Arlene Blum, 32, a research
biochemist and leader of the
expedition, said the climbers
want to give native women a
chance to break out of tradi
tional roles.
"If it is successful, it will
mean a great deal to Nepalese
women," she said.
"They'll never do it," a male
mountain climber said re
cently. "I just don't think
women are capable of rigorous
climbing."
"Contrary to what most
people think, we're not
pioneers," said expedition
member Vera Watson, 44, a
computer programmer living

at Stanford. "We're following
the tradition that was estab
lished by Annie Peck and
women like her."
In 1897, Peck scaled Mt.
Orizaba, 8546 feet, and set a
record for the highest eleva
tion attained by a woman. At
age 58, she made the first as
cent ever of the north summit
of Mt. Huascaran, which was
later named Cumbra Ana Peck
by the Lima Geographical Soc
iety.
Watson admires the fact that
Peck was climbing at an age
when society considers
women "over the hill."
Also, Watson declared, "she
did it without men — in the
sense that she had no husband
or boyfriend to tag along with.
It was very difficult to do it on
your own in those days. People
thought you were crazy."
Organizing an expedition is
a monumental task. An
napurna climbers will need
approximately 6000 pounds of
food and equipment each.
In addition, the women must
stay in shape for the climb.
Irene Miller, 42, a solid state
physicist living in Palo Alto, re
cently ran the Paul Masson
Marathon and averaged nine
minutes per mile.
Miller began climbing when
she was a student at Stanford.
At that time the prevailing
opinion was that women could
make good second "men" on a
climb, but lacked the ability to
lead. She is convinced women
are as capable of leading as
men, and said there needs to
be the outlook that women can
do things.
"If there had been a different
attitude, I would have assumed
a leadership role earlier," she
said.
Can women compete with
men on an equal basis in
mountain climbing? Women
are generally not as strong as
men, but they have good en
durance and this is especially
important in climbing.
Watson laughed, "Our en
gines may be smaller but we go
far on them."
Miller agreed. "In mostareas
I think we're equal, though we

can't generally compete with
men in acrobatic rock climbing
which requires great muscular
strength. However, I don't
look at it as a competitive
sport. It's an individual thing
and you do as well as you can,"
she said.
Although many expeditions
climb during the pre-monsoon
season, the women are plan
ning to hike to their 14,500 foot
base camp during the summer
monsoon in August.
Fivesuccessivecampswill be
established further up the
mountain starting in Sep
tember. Climbers will attempt
the summit in October during
more stable, but still unpre
dictable post-monsoon
weather.
Other potential hazards the
women must consider are "ob
jective dangers" of the moun
tain, such as avalanches.
The Annapurna women have
formed the American Wo
men's Himalayan Expeditions,
Inc. and are raising money for
the $80,000 expedition.

bers, age 20 to 49, hope to get
there.
Several aspects of the An
napurna expedition will be
significant firsts. For example,
it is the first American expedi
tion to attempt the Himalayan
Annapurna I, the 10th highest
mountain in the world.
If successful, the expedition
will put the first American
woman above 26,000 feet.
In addition, the expedition is
planning to use two Nepalese
women as sherpas — porters
who assist with climbing at
high altitudes.
While it is common for
women to serve as porters at

low altitudes, never have na
tive women participated in an
expedition at a high altitude.
Five of the American women
are from the Bay Area.
Arlene Blum, 32, a research
biochemist and leader of the
expedition, said the climbers
want to give native women a
chance to break out of tradi
tional roles.
"If it is successful, it will
mean a great deal to Nepalese
women," she said.
"They'll never do it," a male
mountain climber said re
cently. "I just don't think
women are capable of rigorous
climbing."
"Contrary to what most
people think, we're not
pioneers," said expedition
member Vera Watson, 44, a
computer programmer living

at Stanford. "We're following
the tradition that was estab
lished by Annie Peck and
women like her."
In 1897, Peck scaled Mt.
Orizaba, 8546 feet, and set a
record for the highest eleva
tion attained by a woman. At
age 58, she made the first as
cent ever of the north summit
of Mt. Huascaran, which was
later named Cumbra Ana Peck
by the Lima Geographical Soc
iety.
Watson admires the fact that
Peck was climbing at an age
when society considers
women "over the hill."
Also, Watson declared, "she
did it without men — in the
sense that she had no husband
or boyfriend to tag along with.
It was very difficult to do it on
your own in those days. People
thought you were crazy."
Organizing an expedition is
a monumental task. An
napurna climbers will need
approximately 6000 pounds of
food and equipment each.
In addition, the women must
stay in shape for the climb.
Irene Miller, 42, a solid state
physicist living in Palo Alto, re
cently ran the Paul Masson
Marathon and averaged nine
minutes per mile.
Miller began climbing when
she was a student at Stanford.
At that time the prevailing
opinion was that women could
make good second "men" on a
climb, but lacked the ability to
lead. She is convinced women
are as capable of leading as
men, and said there needs to
be the outlook that women can
do things.
"If there had been a different
attitude, I would have assumed
a leadership role earlier," she
said.
Can women compete with
men on an equal basis in
mountain climbing? Women
are generally not as strong as
men, but they have good en
durance and this is especially
important in climbing.
Watson laughed, "Our en
gines may be smaller but we go
far on them."
Miller agreed. "In mostareas
I think we're equal, though we

can't generally compete with
men in acrobatic rock climbing
which requires great muscular
strength. However, I don't
look at it as a competitive
sport. It's an individual thing
and you do as well as you can,"
she said.
Although many expeditions
climb during the pre-monsoon
season, the women are plan
ning to hike to their 14,500 foot
base camp during the summer
monsoon in August.
Fivesuccessivecampswill be
established further up the
mountain starting in Sep
tember. Climbers will attempt
the summit in October during
more stable, but still unpre
dictable post-monsoon
weather.
Other potential hazards the
women must consider are "ob
jective dangers" of the moun
tain, such as avalanches.
The Annapurna women have
formed the American Wo
men's Himalayan Expeditions,
Inc. and are raising money for
the $80,000 expedition.
A woman's place is on top.
Of what?
Annapurna I, 26,545 feet.
Ten women mountain clim
bers, age 20 to 49, hope to get
there.
