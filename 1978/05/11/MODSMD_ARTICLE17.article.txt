# Significant campus lifestyle changes noted in study of Daily

Miss Burke's mother is pay
ing her a visit at Roble, the
bones of a thoroughbred
named Palo Alto have been en
shrined in a local museum and
Professor Chamber has been
stricken with another case of
diarrhea.
How do you know? It is 1892,
and you have just read the daily
campus newspaper.
Students in Assoc. Prof. Mar

ion Lewenstein's History of
American Journalism class
were asked to read issues of
the original Stanford Daily,
then titled The Daily Palo Alto,
and compare them with the
newspaper we have today.
Although reactions varied
slightly among class members,
there was no indication that
any student would want to re
turn to the lifestyle which
could be reconstructed from a

careful reading of the four
pages put out in 1892.
It appears to have been a life
where establishing hard play
ing and highly moral athletic
teams meant the world. Insig
nificant social interchanges
became everybody's business
and trying to be No. 1 was gosh
darn hard with all those super
schools out on the East Coast.
Calling the Daily Palo Alto a
gossip sheet or an organ of the

sports department might be
harsh, but "news" coverage
was clearly split almost 50-50
between social trivia and athle
tic news.
Certainly the editors of the
time meant it to be more.
"True it is that the daily will
not make a great university,
but just as true is it that the
daily is one of the signs of a
great university."
This inspirational statement
appeared in the first issue of
the Daily Palo Alto along with
the news that Miss Dickinson
and Messrs. Hopkins and
Means had returned for a sec
ond yearof graduate work, and
F.L. Burk was at home in Moun
tain View.
At that time Stanford was a
school with barely more than
600 students. It was easy, in a
community that small, to know
the names of every member.
And, as in a small town cut off
from the passage of strangers

and strange events, internal
happenings took on exagger
ated importance.
For instance, Nellie
Johnson's attack of chills and
fever made the paper, along
with the fact that R.E. Rankin
was confined to his room in
Encina with a slight attack of
inflammatory rheumatism.
(Remember, please, that ad
vanced medical technology
was virtually nonexistent,
perhaps accounting for the
many cases of influenza and
diarrhea cited.)
The social happenings of
professors were treated almost
as casually in the Daily Palo
Alto as those of students. De
tails of lectures and vacation
plans were both common
items in "The Alumni" column.
Although articles depicted a
paternalistic attitude on the
part of faculty, there neverthe
less appeared to be a friendly
working relationship between

students and professors which
is often absent today.
Almost all of the students
evaluating the Daily Palo Alto
criticized the focus of report
ing, but one compliment re
curred over and over; the
sports coverage was thorough.
Sports included everything
from straight event reporting
to editorials decrying the lack
of training facilities. One arti
cle called for the rejection of a
recent shipment of school flags
and ribbons which were sev
eral shades too dark â€” accep
tance would undermine school
spirit. Another item contained
scathing criticism of the Ber
keley baseball team, describ
ing the players as "... a band
of tricksters who will use any
kind of underhand meaVis to
win present victory, regardless
of the reputation it gains the
university and college athletics
generally."
Moral judgments of this sort

were common in the Daily Palo
Alto. The importance of fair
play, both in athletics and
academics, was frequently
stressed, and the editors even
ran the full texts of sermons de
livered in Memorial Church.
But when it came to issues
outside of the Stanford cam
pus, the paper was startlingly
quiet. It's true that the facilities
and technology available to the
staff were not as advanced as
today. The four-page news
paper contained no photo
graphs and there were no wire
services sending in briefs on
nation and world news.
Even so, the newspaper
could have provided some cur
sory summary of current
events. Perhaps the theory was
that students would be con
fronted by the outside world
soon enough and should be al
lowed a few years of shelter.
