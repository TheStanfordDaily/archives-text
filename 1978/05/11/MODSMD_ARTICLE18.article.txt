# Renewed ROTC interest claimed by Army general

Fort Monroe, Va. (AP) — College students
around the country are showing renewed in
terest in Army Reserve Officers Training Corps
(ROTC), says Maj. Gen. Charles Rogers, deputy
chief of staff for ROTC at the Army's Training
and Doctrine Command here.
"Whatever the motive — to receive a commis
sion as second lieutenant in the U.S. Army; to
be awarded a merit scholarship; or to develop
leadership and management skills — students
are enrolling in Army ROTC, which is making a
strong comeback," says Rogers.
For the fourth consecutive year, enrollment in
Army ROTC programs has shown substantia! in
crease, he reports. Latest nationwide figures
show that about 60,000 cadets, approximately
14,000 of whom are women, are taking part in
Army ROTC.
Candidates
More than 6000 ROTC candidates are ex
pected to be commissioned this year as second
lieutenants in the Army.
There are 280 colleges and universities across
the country that host Army ROTC programs,
plus more than 600 other schools which offer
the program through cross-enrollment.
"In the past five years the program has been
overhauled and given a new approach," the
general says. "For example, the academic cur
riculum has been thoroughly and thoughtfully
revised to meet the needs of today's college
students in terms of their field of study and

future careers. Emphasis is placed on leadership
and managerial skills.
Challenge
"We provide a stimulating challenge for our
students — not just an intellectual challenge but
a physical one as well," adds Rogers, noting that
one of the most popular programs developed in
recent years is Adventure Training.
Adventure Training includes instruction in
rubber rafting, mountain climbing, survival
training, rappelling and orienteering.
Rappelling is controlled descent down a rope
from high lofts such as mountains, cliffs and
helicopters. Orienteering is a relatively new
sport that takes boredom out of cross-country
running.
The objective is for the participants, known as
orienteers, to navigate themselves over rugged
and mapped-out terrain with the aid of a topog
raphical map and compass.
Scholarships
Another attraction of Army ROTC is the scho
larship program, Rogers points out. The four-,
three- and two-year merit scholarships are avail
able to qualified students on a competitive
basis. These scholarships pay the entire tuition,
plus the cost of textbooks, laboratory fees and
other education expenses. In addition, ROTC
scholarships provide a living allowance of as
much as $1000 a year, each year the scholarship
is in effect.
