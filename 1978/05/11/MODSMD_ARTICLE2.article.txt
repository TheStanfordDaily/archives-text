# House, Senate tax credit plans not based on need
## Administrators favor Carter proposal 
### Kevin Cox 
University administrators are op
posed to Congress' proposed tuition
tax credits and are backing the Carter
administration's proposal on finan
cial aid, which they say could help at
least 800 more Stanford families and
save the University $600,000.
Both the Senate and House have
proposed a tax credit for each child
in college. This credit is a direct re
duction of taxes. The House bill gives
parents up to $100 credit for each
student and would increase this
amount to $250 by 1980. Meanwhile,
the Senate is considering a tax credit
of $500. Neither bill is based on pa
rental income or need.
Therein lies the problem, accord
ing to University administrators.
They favor the Carter administra
tion's proposal because it provides
more funds for existing financial aid
programs which are based on need.
In this way, administrators say that
financial assistance will be concen
trated on the middle income
families, many of whom cannot af
ford the entire cost of a private in
stitution but who are currently inelig
ible for many financial aid programs
that assist low income families.
Carter's proposal would add more
than $1 billion to existing financial
aid programs. Families with incomes
up to $25,000 would be eligible for
federally-funded Basic Educational
Opportunity Grants (BEOG). Cur
rently only families with incomes of
$15,000 or less are eligible.
The proposal would also enable
families with incomes up to $45,000
to apply for interest-free loans. Cur
rently only families with incomes of
$25,000 or less are eligible. Increases
in the work-study program, which
creates jobs for college students, and
the Supplemental Educational Op-

portunity Grants (SEDS) would also
be possible under Carter's plan.
Robert Huff, director of financial
aids here, said Carter's proposal to
fund existing programs is a "more
equitable and efficient" way to help
middle income families.
"Middle income families can make
some contributions, but are in most
cases unable to pay the total costs of
a Stanford education," he said. By
raising the eligibility ceiling to
$25,000, Huff said Carter's plan is
"targeted to help the neediest stu
dents," many of whom are not cur
rently eligible for financial assis
tance.
This year, according to Huff, 53 per
cent of Stanford students receive
some sort of financial assistance.
About 530 receive BEOG assistance
of up to $1400 per year.
Carter's proposal would make
some 800 additional students eligible
for BEOC aid, a "very significant" in
crease, Huff said. More students
could be eligible for loans, SEOC aid
and work-study, he added.
The University could save $600,000
in 1979-80 if Carter's plan is adopted,
Huff said. This year, the University
contributed $2.7 million to financial
aids from its general fund and will
provide $3.1 million in 1978-79.
Because Carter's proposal would
provide assistance to students now
aided by general fund contributions,
Huff said the savings could be "used
elsewhere for new books in the lib
rary or other improvements in the
academic level."
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
of public affairs, said the tuition tax
credit proposal "gives a little money
to a lot of people, some of whom
need it, many of whom don't."
Rosenzweig added that tuition tax
credits discriminate against the more

expensive private institutions such as
Stanford because the fixed amount
of assistance at public schools is
proportionately higher than at pri
vate institutions. Rosenzweig said he
favors the Carter administration's
proposal because it provides more
money to students who attend more
expensive schools.
"There is concern as the disparity
in price in private institutions and the
price in public institutions grows,"
he said, adding that some students
are forced to choose public schools
because they cannot afford private
institutions.
"Society has to decide whether it
wants private institutions to exist on
a reasonably competitive basis," he
said.
"In terms of cost, there is not a
significant difference between pri
vate and public institutions â€” it's a
question of who bears the cost. For

instance, in the UC (University of
California) system, the taxpayer
pays. There ought to be some sort of
equalization that makes it possible
for students to choose a private in
stitution if they want to,"
Rosenzweig said.
Fred Hargadon, dean of under
graduate admissions, said ability to
pay is never a criteria for admission
to the University because requests
for financial assistance are analyzed
and considered only after a student
has been admitted. Hargadon said he
prefers the Carter financial aid plan,
calling scholarships and grants "ter
ribly important.
"That way, we don't have to admit
people on the basis of who can pay,"
he said. "It's important to have a di
verse class from all backgrounds,
without regard to whether they can
afford it."
