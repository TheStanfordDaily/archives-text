## classical music/dave lang The
						Kronos Quartet: Playing inside out 
### 
It's not unusual to find musi
cians doing their thing in front
of Tresidder these days. After
all, it is spring, and the weather
is the typically gorgeous sort
that brings out Waterwheel or
the Stanford Jazz Band, attract
ing hundreds of appreciative
students eager to both listen
and skip their 1:15 classes.
There was something
strange about last Wednes
day's fare, however, in that
there was a string quartet,
namely the Kronos String
Quartet. How pleasant, you
might think, to listen to the
subtle strains of Mozart or
Haydn while wolfing down a
Tresidder burger. This is where
the most unusual part comes
in: The Kronos Quartet is not
only the Bay Area's only full
time quartet but they
specialize in playing twentieth
century music. And they play it
well.
The letter "B"
Looking over their reper
toire list you see that they play
all the classics, Beethoven,
Brahms, Bartok (and even
works by famous composers
whose names don't start with
the letter "B") but since they
were formed in 1973 they have
given premieres of over 70
works, including 30 written
specifically for them.
As their first violinist David
Harrington quotably said, they
feel a responsibility "to integ
rate modern quartet music into
everyday life," but he later ad
mitted that they really only play
music they like, be it ancient or
contemporary.
Mr. Harrington also said that

the group is particularly fond
of music with jazzy overtones,
seeking out premiers of works
that represent a fusion of clas
sical music and jazz. An exam
ple of this is the piano quartet
that Keith Jarrett is currently
writing for them. Another
example is the piece that
opened last Wednesday's per
formance, Ken Benshoof's
"Traveling Music" (1974).
Atonal shuffle
This work sounded as if the
composer had written varia
tions on Gershwin snips, and
then rearranged them into a
sort of atonal shuffle. A very
interesting thing happened
during this piece: people who
walked by oblivious to the
quartet's presence ended up
unknowingly sauntering to the
beat!
This was followed by Austra
lian composer Peter Scul
thorpe's Eighth Quartet (1969),
which according to Scul
thorpe, is based on the modes
and ostinati of the Balinese
Gamelan. I'm not sure just how
much Bali was in this piece but
it was really very listenable and
well constructed, especially
with its exciting use of special
effects, such as eery bow tap
ping and creepy harmonics.
George Crumb
The afternoon's highlight
was the arresting performance
of Pulitzer Prize winning com
poser George Crumb's "Black
Angels for Electric String Qur
Quartet" (1970). This piece was
conceived of as a sort of bas
tard wedding of Witches Sab
bath symbolism and anti-
Vietnam war frustration,

matching numerology (prefer
ence for 7 and 13) with quota
tions from such cheery pieces
as Saint-Saens' "Danse
Macabre" and Schuheii
"Death and the Maiden."
This piece is supposed to
move you by making you terri
bly uncomfortable, eithei by
the disembodied harmonics
and unearthly sounds of bows
being drawn across tuned crys
tal water goblets, or by assault
ing your ears with amplifica
tion "to the point of pain," as
stipulated by the composer
For this reason I felt the
Crumb suffered the most from
being played outdoors, nol
just because there is a fine line
between "disembodied" and
"too soft" that lunch noises
forced them to cross, but also
because few people eating
lunch want to have their ears
hurt. (Not to sound like an
elitist, but I was sitting about 15
feet away and I loved it.)
The only solution
We have to have them back
for a real concert: that's the
only solution; they play too
well to not invite them back.
The key to their success is that
not only do they understand
the music, not only do they
play as if they understand the
music, but they enjoy playing
as if they understand the
music, and this is obvious to all
who see them play.
Oh, yes, the Kronos is made
up of violinists David Har
rington, and Ella kilian Cray,
violist Hank Dutt, and cellist
Walter Gray. We ought not
forget them.
