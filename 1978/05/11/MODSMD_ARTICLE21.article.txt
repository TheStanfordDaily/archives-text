## Meanwhile, in Zurich 
### 
I have been under the spell
of the ACT Production of
Tom Stoppard's play "Traves
ties" for the last two days.
In this production at the
Geary Street Theater before
the house lights even dim, and
while the audience is still
shuffling toward seats, one ex
pects something really ex
traordinary. There in full view
is the intricate set designed by
John Jensen, and it is already
being populated by the charac
ters. And what characters they
are — Tristan Tzara, the inven
tor of Dada, James Joyce, Lenin
and his wife Nadya, and in the
background somewhere, and
seemingly writing a good deal
of the Ida dialogue, is Oscar
Wilde.
The play takes place in
Zurich; its action concerns the
not very reliable recollection of
a minor British diplomat of the
events of 1917. This diplomat,
Henry Carr, played to perfec
tion by Raye Birk, is our
ringleader. Through his mem
ory, Lenin, Joyce and Tzara
meet one another and during
these meetings jump through
all the literary and intellectual
hoops they or Mr. Stoppard
can think of.
Under Nagle Jackson's
sprited direction, everyone
jumps to perfection and does
so using every conceivable part
of the set, including table tops
and bookcase tops. As natty
and posturing Tristan Tzara
(James R. Winkler) exchanges
epigrams with Carr while eat
ing cucumber sandwiches, and

the Wildelike women, Gwen
dolyn and Cecily, played by
Susan E. Pellegrino and Bar
bara Dirickson, do everything
from reciting Shakespeare to a
striptease. The butler, Joseph
Bird, guzzles champagne but
comes under the influence of
Communism, and James Joyce
(Sydney Walker), softly steps
his way through limfericks
wearing mismatched Irish
tweeds and a kelly green hat.
Historically this group of
people never met, and as Carr
finally admits, he never met
any of them either. But as Carr
also says, he might have met
them, and certainly such im
agined meetings are to our be
nefit. During these meetings
the characters present their
differing views on art for art's a
sake, art for the sake of society,
anti-art, and of course Carr's
philistinism, "British Theatre?
Take Gibert and Sullivan, "Pi
rate of Penzance," now there's
theatre."
The only person who does
not join in this free-for-all is
Lenin, Michael Winters, who
maintains a dower communist
dignity even when delivering a

speech on the necessity of
censorship from the top of a
bookcase.
The purpose of this play is to
undercut as many ideas of re
volution and art as possibleand
finally to undercut the play it
self. At one point Carr says
"This may be nonsense, but at
least it's clever nonsense." Un
fortunately Lenin's speech,
though it may be nonsense, is
not up to the farcical clever
level of the rest of the play, and
so, for a moment we tumble
from the air cushion that the
rest of the play has supported.
We are quickly put back on
our cushion, however, by a
scene in verse between Gwen
dolyn and Cecily in which th<
plays comic conventions, mis
taken identity and complica
tions are quickly resolved to
the accompaniment of the now
dancing butler.
The play ends with Carr tel
ling us the three lessons of
1917. Of course he forgets the
last one and so Carr and th<
play itself join all the ideas and
doctrines that have been
\poked and tickled throughout
a delightful evening.

sake, art for the sake of society,
anti-art, and of course Carr's
philistinism, "British Theatre?
Take Gibert and Sullivan, "Pi
rate of Penzance," now there's
theatre."
The only person who does
not join in this free-for-all is
Lenin, Michael Winters, who
maintains a dower communist
dignity even when delivering a

speech on the necessity of
censorship from the top of a
bookcase.
The purpose of this play is to
undercut as many ideas of re
volution and art as possibleand
finally to undercut the play it
self. At one point Carr says
"This may be nonsense, but at
least it's clever nonsense." Un
fortunately Lenin's speech,
though it may be nonsense, is
not up to the farcical clever
level of the rest of the play, and
so, for a moment we tumble
from the air cushion that the
rest of the play has supported.
We are quickly put back on
our cushion, however, by a
scene in verse between Gwen
dolyn and Cecily in which th<
plays comic conventions, mis
taken identity and complica
tions are quickly resolved to
the accompaniment of the now
dancing butler.
The play ends with Carr tel
ling us the three lessons of
1917. Of course he forgets the
last one and so Carr and th<
play itself join all the ideas and
doctrines that have been
\poked and tickled throughout
a delightful evening.
I have been under the spell
of the ACT Production of
Tom Stoppard's play "Traves
ties" for the last two days.
In this production at the
Geary Street Theater before
the house lights even dim, and
while the audience is still
shuffling toward seats, one ex
pects something really ex
traordinary. There in full view
is the intricate set designed by
John Jensen, and it is already
being populated by the charac
ters. And what characters they
are — Tristan Tzara, the inven
tor of Dada, James Joyce, Lenin
and his wife Nadya, and in the
background somewhere, and
seemingly writing a good deal
of the Ida dialogue, is Oscar
Wilde.
The play takes place in
Zurich; its action concerns the
not very reliable recollection of
a minor British diplomat of the
events of 1917. This diplomat,
Henry Carr, played to perfec
tion by Raye Birk, is our
ringleader. Through his mem
ory, Lenin, Joyce and Tzara
meet one another and during
these meetings jump through
all the literary and intellectual
hoops they or Mr. Stoppard
can think of.
Under Nagle Jackson's
sprited direction, everyone
jumps to perfection and does
so using every conceivable part
of the set, including table tops
and bookcase tops. As natty
and posturing Tristan Tzara
(James R. Winkler) exchanges
epigrams with Carr while eat
ing cucumber sandwiches, and

the Wildelike women, Gwen
dolyn and Cecily, played by
Susan E. Pellegrino and Bar
bara Dirickson, do everything
from reciting Shakespeare to a
striptease. The butler, Joseph
Bird, guzzles champagne but
comes under the influence of
Communism, and James Joyce
(Sydney Walker), softly steps
his way through limfericks
wearing mismatched Irish
tweeds and a kelly green hat.
Historically this group of
people never met, and as Carr
finally admits, he never met
any of them either. But as Carr
also says, he might have met
them, and certainly such im
agined meetings are to our be
nefit. During these meetings
the characters present their
differing views on art for art's a
sake, art for the sake of society,
anti-art, and of course Carr's
philistinism, "British Theatre?
Take Gibert and Sullivan, "Pi
rate of Penzance," now there's
theatre."
The only person who does
not join in this free-for-all is
Lenin, Michael Winters, who
maintains a dower communist
dignity even when delivering a
