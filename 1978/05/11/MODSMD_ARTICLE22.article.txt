## Good show 
### 
Who ever heard of a five
year-old, thumb-sucking,
blanket-carrying kid discus
sing the "sociological impli
cations of a work such as
Peter Rabbit?"
Of course, everyone
knows that only Linus Van
Pelt could utter such an en
lightening dissertation —
and he does — in Larkin
House's impressive presen
tation of "You're a Good
Man Charlie Brown," pre
sented tonight at 8 p.m. and
tomorrow at 7 p.m. in Lar
kin's North Lounge.
Set upon a deceptively
simple stage, the show dis
plays a single day in the life
of our hero, Charlie Brown.
The play was written like a
series of comic strips, featur
ing the cast in a cohesive
group of short sketches.
The show is very well
done, has many outstanding
features and relatively few
problems. Overall, the most
proficient aspects of the per
formance are the musical
numbers. The acting is gen-,,
erally good, with a few por
trayals that could be called
exceptional.
One exceptional perfor

mance is turned in by Renee
Richerds in the role of lucy.
Her grasp of the character is
fantasic and is highlighted by
some convincing facial ex
pressions that Charles
Schulz would be proud of.
The musical numbers,
however, are where the
greatest strength of the pro
duction lies. This is due to
the particularly moving pei
formance turned in by Rich
Taylor in the role of Charlie
Brown. "The Baseball
Game" creates a feeling ot
such piteous unhappiness
that you will feel it all the way
down your spine. The real
Charlie Brown truly comes to
life when Rich begins to sing.
The technical aspects of
the show, if not perfect, are
excusable.Little time was left
for their preparation and
consequently, there are a
few (justifiable) blunders.
The costumes, purposefully
simple, are well done, the
mos outstanding garb being
that of Pigpen (Tim Warren).
So, if you attend the play,
take a handkerchief. If
Taylor's singing doesn't get
to you, Pigpen's dusty cos
tume certainly will.
