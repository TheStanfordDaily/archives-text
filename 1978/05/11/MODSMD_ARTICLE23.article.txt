3, 4, 5 and 6 balls. 3, 4, 5 and 6 rings. 3 and 4
clubs. Devil sticks, cigar boxes, manipulations

tunes. Fiddle, mandolin, acoustic guitar, jug,
kazoo, dobro, drums, washboard, acoustic bass,

Speaking of which (the Stanford Spring Faire,

and theater in the tradition of vaudeville, with
tuba/mandolin/banjo/megaphone/toy piano. All

Madrigals, Suggs the mime, the Bay City Reds,
the Al Fellahin Belly Dancers, foot masseurs,
Herb Moore, face painters, Flans Sven Paulsen,
a clown on stilts, Robert Hartman, a Hungarian
