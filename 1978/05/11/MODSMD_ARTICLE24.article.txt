## Fine performances you're missing 
### 
This campus is crawling with
accomplished musicians, and
we are not doing them good.
They are constantly giving con
certs worthy of our attention,
and they are consistantly giving
them for audiences that ought,
by all rights, to be larger. For
example:
Cellist Joshua Koestenbaum
will perform works of Ginest
era, Schumann, Brahms, and
Tchaikovsky at 8 p.m. Sunday,
May 21, in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. Koestenbaum has
been a member of the San Jose
Symphony for five years and is
principle cellist with the Stan
ford Chamber Orchestra. He is
a senior music major at Stan
ford, planning to study next
year with Aldo Parisot at the
Yale School of Music, and he

won the 1974 California Cello
Club competition. Pianist Ai
leen lames, now completing
her doctoral degree in piano
performance (at Stanford) be
fore taking a spot as assistant
professor of music history and
piano (at the University of
Santa Clara), will assist Koes
tenbaum, and it should be a
memorable occasion.
Stupid frat parties
Will you be there? Probably
not. Even though everybody
who ever took "Sleep and
Dreams" (and that's just about
everybody) knows where Din
kelspiel Auditorium is, you'll
probably come up with some
lame excuse about midterms,
or frat parties (stupid frat par
ties). You won't go, and twenty

years from now you will sin
cerely regret it.
More examples: Pamela De
cker will be in Memorial
Church at 8 p.m. playing the
organ. She will be playing J.S.
Bach's "Toccata in F Major,"
Mozart's "Fantasia in F Minor,"
Franck's "Choral no. 1 in E
Major" and works of Scheidt,
Vierne and Reger. On Friday
the 19th in Mem Chu the Uni
versity Choral, with conductor
William Ramsey assisted by
doctoral candidates in choral
conducting, will peform pieces
by Brahms, Schubert, Mozart
and Poulenc. On the 20th the
Stanford Studio Jazz Band will
play music of Bay Area com
posers, featuring guest sol
oists. None of these events will
cost you a cent, but you'll

probably decide to wash your
hair that night.
Mimi's voice will be famous
OK then — but don't be sur
prised if a student performer
you never went to see grows
up and becomes world fam
ous, or even respected. Most
of these people are talented
(there are more here than
those mentioned), and some
day one of them is going to
grow up and make you pay.
Your children will ask you if
you ever knew Mimi Wyche
and Nancy Perloff, (Sunday the
14th in Dinkeispiel: perfect
voice) and you'll have to
choose between lying through
your teeth and shuffling dejec
tedly into the next room. If you
lie I will call your children up
and tell them so (I know who

you are), and if you shuffle de
jectedly you'll ruin your in
steps.
So how 'bout hanging
around a student performance
from time to time? The Music
Department would thank you,
the performers would thank
you, and you might even learn
something new. Besides, the
future of your children de
pends on it.

Bach's "Toccata in F Major,"
Mozart's "Fantasia in F Minor,"
Franck's "Choral no. 1 in E
Major" and works of Scheidt,
Vierne and Reger. On Friday
the 19th in Mem Chu the Uni
versity Choral, with conductor
William Ramsey assisted by
doctoral candidates in choral
conducting, will peform pieces
by Brahms, Schubert, Mozart
and Poulenc. On the 20th the
Stanford Studio Jazz Band will
play music of Bay Area com
posers, featuring guest sol
oists. None of these events will
cost you a cent, but you'll

probably decide to wash your
hair that night.
Mimi's voice will be famous
OK then — but don't be sur
prised if a student performer
you never went to see grows
up and becomes world fam
ous, or even respected. Most
of these people are talented
(there are more here than
those mentioned), and some
day one of them is going to
grow up and make you pay.
Your children will ask you if
you ever knew Mimi Wyche
and Nancy Perloff, (Sunday the
14th in Dinkeispiel: perfect
voice) and you'll have to
choose between lying through
your teeth and shuffling dejec
tedly into the next room. If you
lie I will call your children up
and tell them so (I know who

you are), and if you shuffle de
jectedly you'll ruin your in
steps.
So how 'bout hanging
around a student performance
from time to time? The Music
Department would thank you,
the performers would thank
you, and you might even learn
something new. Besides, the
future of your children de
pends on it.
Futhermore:
— The Stanford Glee club
performs in Dink this Saturday.

Tuesday, the 23rd.
So there. You have no ex
cuse. The rest is silence.
This campus is crawling with
accomplished musicians, and
we are not doing them good.
They are constantly giving con
certs worthy of our attention,
and they are consistantly giving
them for audiences that ought,
by all rights, to be larger. For
example:
Cellist Joshua Koestenbaum
will perform works of Ginest
era, Schumann, Brahms, and
Tchaikovsky at 8 p.m. Sunday,
May 21, in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. Koestenbaum has
been a member of the San Jose
Symphony for five years and is
principle cellist with the Stan
ford Chamber Orchestra. He is
a senior music major at Stan
ford, planning to study next
year with Aldo Parisot at the
Yale School of Music, and he

won the 1974 California Cello
Club competition. Pianist Ai
leen lames, now completing
her doctoral degree in piano
performance (at Stanford) be
fore taking a spot as assistant
professor of music history and
piano (at the University of
Santa Clara), will assist Koes
tenbaum, and it should be a
memorable occasion.
Stupid frat parties
Will you be there? Probably
not. Even though everybody
who ever took "Sleep and
Dreams" (and that's just about
everybody) knows where Din
kelspiel Auditorium is, you'll
probably come up with some
lame excuse about midterms,
or frat parties (stupid frat par
ties). You won't go, and twenty

years from now you will sin
cerely regret it.
More examples: Pamela De
cker will be in Memorial
Church at 8 p.m. playing the
organ. She will be playing J.S.
Bach's "Toccata in F Major,"
Mozart's "Fantasia in F Minor,"
Franck's "Choral no. 1 in E
Major" and works of Scheidt,
Vierne and Reger. On Friday
the 19th in Mem Chu the Uni
