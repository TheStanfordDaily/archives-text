## On some of the mechanics of staging Feydeau 
### 
How do you put a play together? What are the brass tacks of a
theatrical production? For Martin Esslin, Mike Fisher and Jim
Stearns — they, respectively, are directing, set-designing, and
costume-coordinating the Drama Department's upcoming set of
Feydeau one-acts — the past few months have been spent to a
large degree dealing with precisely those questions.
All three have found the mechanics of staging The Purging
and "Don't Go Walking Around Naked" to be an interesting and
sometimes unconventional challenge, and all three seem satis
fied with what they are about to present (the plays run May 17-20,
and May 23-27, at 8 p.m., in the Little Theater).
For Esslin, who as director is overseeing every aspect of the
productions, the first and most important question involved the
selection of a play. "You have to select a play that you think is
feasible within the means you have," he said; "you have to
account for things like budget, available actors, and the nature of
your audience.
"In this case I was thinking in terms of trying to find something
which would be both of scholarly interest and literary value, and
therefore be fitting for a university, and at the same time get
something that was as amusing as it could possibly be. I hat's why
I decided to go for Feydeau. Most of Feydeau — the long plays,
the full-length plays — most of that is tremendously intricate,
requiring tremendous technical apparatus, but the later playsare
very suitable.
"We've been very fortunate, I think, in that we've got a very
good cast. In the university situation, where you have to take
what there is, rather than being able to call up thousands of actors
capable of the parts, its a question of fitting the play to the
people. We've done well there, I think — we've found people
suited both physically and dramatically to the various roles to be
played."
If choosing and casting the plays went smoothly for Esslin,
Mike Fisher's task was perhaps a little stickier. In addition to the
perennial fitting of a setting to the theme, Fisher has had some
intriguing technological dilemmas to deal with.
"We were faced with making eleven chamber pots for each
showing of 'The Purging,' " he said. "Ten a night have to break,
and one has to stand up to anything. We had a time with those.
First the handles wouldn't stick, and we lost 10 pots. Then they'd
be too dry, or they'd break coming out of the mold. We thrashed
around with several methods before getting it right."
Fisher, of course, has had much else to deal with, though the
chamber pots are not all that unrepresentative of his task as a
whole. "These plays are a lot like cartoons," he said; "they are
domestic situations requiring a realistic focus. We've had other
than purely practical considerations — even people like Walt
Disney and Walter Lance, when they had an idea for a cartoon,
had a concept behind the lightest and most frivolous things
— but the major thing has been the realistic focus.
Jim Stearns is in an analogous position. "The characters are so
self-explanatory in the text that there's really no problem of
groping for images, and the period is very clearly defined. The
costuming for this show involves a lot of ornate tayloring, but it is
clearly defined."
One of Stearns' potential stumbling blocks, in fact, has the
costume, or lack thereof, worn by the central character in
"Naked." "In this case we've decided to use a flesh-colored
body-stocking, and it was a struggle for awhile to make sure none
of the seams show. The play is a little unspecific about how
undressed she is — I think that in terms of the farce itself her
nudity is more in husband's mind than it is anywhere else. We
have tried to make her ornate, then, dressed— but still quite
naked-looking at times."
Jim Stearns, then, like Mike Fisherand Martin Esslin, appears to
have dealt with his end of the "French Farce a la Feydeau" quite
nicely. Like all productions, this one had aspects demanding
special attention, but as Esslin said, "there isn't any theatrical
production immune to those things, and of course the beauty of
this is finding a way of solving the problems. Everything can be
solved."

Costume designer Jim Steam's images of Clarisse, a central character in the Drama
Department's "French Farce a la Feydeau," eventually found their way onto the

person of Tricia Heaton; Hochenpiuex (Craig Letner) and Clarisse's husband (Larry
Friedlander) seemed pleased by the metamorphosis.
