# Theme house restaurants prove successful

The Italian House's La Pizzeria and
The French House's La Creperie are
doing very well financially and plan
to continue operation next year, ac
cording to the managers of the two
restaurants.
La Pizzeria and La Creperie are
non-profit programs. The money
remaining after paying the
employees is turned back into the
program funds of La Casa Italiana and
La Maison Francaise.
The programs are relatively new on
campus; La Creperie opened in fall
1976 while La Pizzeria opened about
a year later.
La Pizzeria's initial capital expendi
ture was very high because of the
high cost of the oven but after 24
weeks of operations, the initial debt
was paid, according to Matt Cobb,
general manager of La Pizzeria.
Cobb said running La Pizzeria re
quires 130 man-hours per week. The
program draws its 30 needed
employees from the 50 people in its
employment pool. Most employees
live in La Casa Italiana and all are as
sociated in some way with the house.
La Creperie employs fewer stu
dents because it requires only eight
or 10 people each week, according to
John Gibson, last quarter's manager
of La Creperie.
Both restaurants are open only on
Saturday nights â€” La Creperie from 6
to 11 p.m. and La Pizzeria from 5 to

midnight.
While La Pizzeria prefers to serve
dessert only to those who have
purchased a meal, La Creperie does
primarily dessert business. Accord
ing to Gibson, "Americans don't
think of eating a crepe for dinner."
La Creperie serves approximately
110 persons every Saturday, while La
Pizzeria serves about 270. Gibson
said business at La Creperie has
dropped this year with the opening
of La Pizzeria but added that the
French restaurant is serving more
customers now than last autumn and
has apparently become firmly estab
lished despite competition.
La Pizzeria and La Creperie are
managed independently from the
Italian and French Houses. Supplies
for each program are ordered one
week at a time and are stored sepa
rately from the house's supplies.
Neither program operates under a
large overhead.
La Creperie's major expenses are
dairy products ordered from Penin
sula Creamery, while La Pizzeria's
bills are most frequently from
Domestic Cheese Company. Both
programs also buy goods from the
Stanford Commissary.
Cobb said the ultimate goal of the
French and Italian theme houses and
of the restaurants is the promotion of
foreign culture at the University.
Other purposes include publicizing
the houses and providing jobs for

students living in those houses.
The restaurants are "informally"
audited once each quarter by Tom
Hornbeak of the Office of Residen
tial Education. According to
Hornbeak, he sees that the programs
are run "effectively, safely, legally,
and in a solvent manner."

The operations have strong sup
port from the office, said Hornbeak,
because they are "well-run, foster
cohesion and bring a touch of France
and Italy to the Stanford Commun
ity." Financially, Hornbeak makes
sure that the programs are treated
"as a business" and that they follow
all applicable codes and regulations.
