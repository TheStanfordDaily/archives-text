More jets to Israel urged
Washington — Two Cabinet officers urged Pres
ident Jimmy Carter yesterday to promise Israel an
additional 20 jet fighters as a way to keep Congress
from rejecting his proposed sale of war planes to
Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, a White House
source said.
The source, who asked not to be identified, said
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Defense Sec
retary Harold Brown recommended that Carter
propose the sale of the added planes for Israel.
If Carter agrees to such a compromise, the Is
raelis would receive 90 jet fighters under the pac
kage now before Congress and an additional 20
planes at a later date.
Both the House International Relations Commit
tee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
have scheduled votes today on resolutions that
would reject the arms sales. Both the House and
Senate must pass resolutions of disapproval or the
arms sales go through.
Princess Margaret will divorce
London — Princess Margaret will divorce her
husband Lord Snowdon, ending a stormy 18-year
marriage and flying in the face of Britain s old
taboo against royal divorce.
Kensington Palace, home of the 47-year-old
younger sister of Queen Elizabeth 11, made this
official announcement:
"Her royal highness, the Princess Margaret,
Countess of Snowdon, and the Earl of Snowdon
after two years of separation have now agreed that
their marriage should formally be ended. Accord
ingly her royal highness will start the necessary
legal proceedings."
Women protest paper policy
Amherst, Mass. — Fifty women remained bar
ricaded behind desks, chairs and couches in the
offices of the University of Massachusetts' student
newspaper for the tenth day yesterday, deter
mined to get their demand of a separate page of
women's news.
The women have been living in the four rooms
used by the 20,000-circulation daily since last Sun
day, sleeping on couches and sleeping bags,
sponge bathing in two adjacent bathrooms and
eating food brought in by sympathizers.
Negotiations between the newspaper's staff and
representatives of the women's group showed no
sign of an immediate breakthrough yesterday.
The women have rejected a proposal by the
newspaper for a guaranteed 40 column inches of
women's news a day, interspersed with other
news.
Instead, they are demanding one page of wo
men's news each day, with 25 per cent reserved for
advertisements, independent editorial control
and a women's department editor selected by the
campus women's community.
Soviet defector's wife kills self
Moscow — The wife of Soviet defector Arkady
Shevchenko took her own life in her Moscow

apartment, her son said yesterday.
Leongina Shevchenko, 49, died Monday from an
overdose of sleeping pills, according to well
informed Soviet sources. Her body was found
Tuesday in a closet in the apartment she shared
with her daughter, Anya, 16.
Shevchenko, who left his U.N. post as under
secretary general for political and Security Council
affairs and sought permission to remain in the
United States, appealed in his statement for help
from the U.S. government to bring his daughter
back to the United States.
The Soviets blamed Shevchenko's refusal to re
turn on a "frameup" by U.S. intelligence agents.
There were reports that the diplomat had a drink
ing problem and was having an affair. There was
also speculation that he was a secret American
agent.
AMC ordered to recall autos
Washington — The federal government yester
day ordered American Motors Corp. to recall most
of its 1976 autos for exhaust system repairs, an
action that could cost the smallest of the U.S. car
companies $3.1 million.
The Environmental Protection Agency ordered
the recall because of a faulty part that can allow
high levels of nitrogen oxide to escape into the air,
said the EPA'sdeputy administrator, Barbara Blum.
The AMC recall order involves 270,000 Hornets,
Gremlins, Pacers and Matadors, the EPA said. The
EPA also ordered AMC to recall 40,000 Jeeps and
Post Office dispatcher trucks made in 1975 and
1976.
Israel celebrates 30th birthday
Jerusalem — Looking back on 30 years of
achievement and ahead to political uncertainty,
Israel ended a day of mourning for its war dead
and began a 24-hour nationwide birthday party at
sundown yesterday.
As Israelis started a round of picnics, street car
nivals and flag-waving merriment in honor of In
dependence Day, Prime Minister Menachem
Begin boasted that Israel has "massive strength"
with which to confront its foes.
State legislator faces expulsion
Lansing, Mich. — After a month of agonizing, the
Michigan House prepared to vote yesterday on
whether to expel a popular colleague who was
convicted of embezzling $24,000 from an heiress.
But the legislator, Rep. Monte Geralds, was pes
simistic.
"There's still a little hope, and I think the vote
will be close," he said wearily. "But I expect to be
expelled."
Today, Geralds is to be sentenced in Oakland
County Circuit Court for taking money from a
wealthy Bloomfield Hills heiress, Geraldine Patria,
whom he was representing as a lawyer.
She said she had entrusted the money to him
and that he used some for a down payment on an
office building and to buy stock. He claimed she
owed him the money in fees.

State-funded abortions approved
Sacramento — In a compromise aimed at defus
ing the explosive issue of state-funded abortions,
an Assembly committee yesterday approved $24.8
million for MediCal abortions but restricted fund
ing of elective abortions after three months of
pregnancy.
Supporters and opponents of state funding of
poor women's abortions both said they were un
happy with the compromise.
But the restrictions approved by the Assembly
Ways and Means Committee appeared to improve
chances for legislative approval of Gov. Jerry
Brown's proposal for the state to replace with
drawn federal funding for 77,000 MediCal abor
tions this fiscal year.
Snow forces parks to open late
San Francisco—The National Park Service, citing
one of the deepest California snowpacks on re
cord, said yesterday some facilities will be late in
opening for the season in the mountain parks,
normally well groomed by this time for the arrivai
of heavy tourist business.
So great is the pack at Lassen Volcanic National
Park that the park road will be impossible to open
at all this month, according to park superinten
dent Bill Stephenson.
Stephenson said his road crews were working
this week in 30-foot snowdrifts near Emerald Lake
and it would take at least until next week to get to
the 8500-foot road summit.
At Yosemite National Park, the most popular in
the state, snowplow crews were reported struggl
ing east on the Tioga Road in pack up to 14 feet. In
some places they are encountering4o-foot drifts at
7000-feet elevation. The Tioga Road is a major sec
ondary route over the Sierra.
Ed Wing, the Park Service's regional information
officer, said some facilities at popular Tuolumne
Meadows were damaged in snowstorms and must
be repaired. He estimated it would take until mid-
June to get things ready for campers.
