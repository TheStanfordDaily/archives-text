# Sonic treatments may help heal skin cancers

Heat emitted from high frequency
sound waves is being researched by
Medical School dermatologists as a
possible treatment for superficial
skin cancers.
Tumors in eight patients shrank
after receiving hyperthermia treat
ments, according to Eugene Farber,
chairman of the department of der
matology. He described these results
as "encouraging."
Hyperthermia has been used for
several years as an experimental
treatment for other cancers. How
ever, this is the first time hyperther
mia has been applied without com
plementary radiation or drug treat
ments, according to Dr. Elaine
Orenberg-Anderson, senior re
search associate in dermatology.
Is it lethal?
Farber said the department is at
tempting to see if hyperthermia is
lethal to skin cancer cells.
"If it is effective, this technique
may provide a painless, non-surgical
method of removing skin tumors,"
he said.
Sound waves are administered to
the patients through a device re
sembling a suction cup which is
placed directly on the skin. Doctors
can adjust the pitch of the sound and
increase the frequency in proportion
to the depth of the tumor.

Researchers have not determined
if the sound waves actually stop the
cancer and are therefore cautious in
directly linking the shrinkage of
tumors to the sound waves.
Skin cancer is currently treated via
surgical removal. The tumor is
scraped off and the underlying skin is
cauterized by needle. Bad scars can
result, especially if the tumor is lo
cated on the face or neck, said Oren
berg.
Hahn designed
The ultrasound equipment for
hyperthermia was designed and con
structed in the laboratory of Dr.
George Hahn, associate professor of
radiology.
Hahn and his associates have
found that tumor cells seem to be
more sensitive to elevated tempera
tures than normal cells. Hyperther
mia also has been shown to increase
the effectiveness of radiation and
drug treatments.
One-year grant
The research, being conducted by
Farber, Orenberg-Anderson and
David Deneau, assistant professor of
dermatology, is supported by a one
year grant from the American Cancer
Society.
Farber said the group plans to ex
pand their studies and has applied
for a second year of funding.
