New Dollie
There's a new Dollie in town â€” Anna Maria Cuerra. Cuerra moved up from
her previous status as first alternate about two weeks ago when Dana Fugelso
decided to leave the group.
The newest addition to Stanford's dance squad is a sophomore double
majoring in psychology and international relations. She is a winter quarter
transfer from Princeton.
No Rolls Royce
Senior class president Clark Sterling said the four class co-presidents will
not be entering the Gatsby Night in a Rolls Royce Friday at Frost Am
phitheatre.
Sterling said what appeared in yesterday's Daily was meant as a joke, but
came across wrong. He said seniors and their guests can wear anything to the
event and 1920s attire is not required.
