# Moro assassination news produces furor in Italy
## 
### 
Rome (AP) — Aldo Moro was
quietly buried by his embittered fam
ily yesterday in a secluded village
cemetery miles from a mounting
political furor over his assassination
and from the continuing wave of
urban terrorism besieging this na
tion.
Italy's chief police official, Interior
Minister Francesco Cossiga, res
igned in the face of the growing
backlash to the government's failure
to save Moro. In Milan, a four
member "kneecapping" team gun
ned down an industrialist. And in Tu
rin, an imprisoned leader of Moro's
Red Brigades kidnappers ominously
warned that the siege of terror is not
about to end.
Four hundred mourners — all fam
ily members and friends — attended
the funeral service in Torrita
Tiberina, a village 30 miles north of
Rome where the Moros had a house.
The widow and her children, who
had vainly appealed to the govern
ment to negotiate with the kidnap

pers in hopes of saving Moro's life,
issued a terse statement after his
bullet-riddled body was found lues
day saying they wanted no state fun
eral or other public commemora
tion.
The government, nevertheless,
scheduled a state funeral service for
Saturday in Rome, without the body.
In one of his last letters during 54
days in captivity, Moro, in despair
over his fellow Christian Democrats'
refusal to bargain with his Red
Brigades kidnappers, requested that
no party or government official at
tend his funeral.
Despite the family's expressed op
position to public mourning, mill
ions of Italians paid homage to Moro
yesterday in rallies, work stoppages
and quiet personal tributes.
Cossiga announced he was resign
ing "in order to ensure the necessary
serenity" for a government review of
its handling of the Moro c ase.
The Republicans, one of five par
ties supporting the Christian Democ
rat government, asked Premier
Ciulio Andreotti to summon a meet
ing of the five parties' leaders to dis
cuss Cossiga's resignation and other
problems linked with Moro's death
and"the necessary, severe struggle
against terrorism."
Police in Milan said three men and
a woman shot and wounded indus
trialist Franco Giacomazzi in the legs.
The victim is an executive of the
state-run Montedison chemical
company.
The shooting had all the
trademarks of an attack by the urban
guerrilla Red Brigades, police said,

hut the Milan newspaper II Ciorno
received an anonymous telephone
call claiming the shooting was the
work of the previously unknown
"Armed Popular Communist Front."
In Turin, the founder of Red
Brigades, Renato Curcio, disrupted
court proceedings in his trial on sedi
tion charges to shout a warning to
the prosecutor, "You live outside of
history. Perhaps you have not under
stood what has happened in these
days or what will happen in the com
ing months in Italy."
Curcio, a one-time philosophy
student, called Moro's assassination
"an act of revolutionary justice, the
highest act of humanity possible in
this society without justice and di
vided into classes." He was dragged
from the courtroom in chains after
the outburst.
Authorities stepped up protection
for prominent politicians and other
likely targets of terrorist violence.
Police pressed their all-out search for
20 wanted persons, including nine
charged in arrest warrants with com
plicity in the Moro kidnapping.
Workers nationwide observed a
two-hour work stoppage, and
thousands braving a driving rain
massed in St. John Lateran Square at
a rally organized by the country's
three major unions to pay tribute to
Moro and speak out against ter
rorism.
"I have faith that the state with the
help of labor will have the strength to
defeat the Red Brigades," declared
Luigi Macario, leader of a Christian
Democrat-dominated union.
