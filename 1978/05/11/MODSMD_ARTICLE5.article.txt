# Illegal posters add to University's 'decay'
## 
### John Timpane News analysis 
It's springtime at Stanford, the
most beautiful — and the trashiest —
time of the year. Along with the flow
ers, illegal posters pop up
everywhere.
"I made a sweep down the main
walk, from the Business School up to
Tresidder, just counting the illegal
posters and notices," moaned Tom
Massey, assistant director of Tresid
der Union. "I noted hundreds of in
fractions from 45 organizations in all.
Almost 90 per cent of them are on
campus groups and surprisingly,
University departments are as much
atfaultas student volunteer groups."
Excessive postering, a well-known
campus eyesore, became an issue
this year when Ronald Hilton, pro
fessor emeritus of Spanish and Por
tuguese, complained that his de
partment, located in the old En
gineering Corner, is now the ugliest
spot on campus.
Massey called the corner "a total
mess from posters and tliers all over
the place — especially Dailys."
Hilton is not the only one with a
problem. Several buildings, espe
cially public halls and auditoriums,
are in bad shape and are getting
worse.
Cubberley falling apart
Vicky Holt, director of public
events, said, "It's well known that
Cubberley is falling apart — people
have stopped scheduling classes
there because of it. And Memorial
Auditorium is just plain ugly because
it hasn't been painted for so long. It's
getting to be a pain in the ass."
"We need to educate people
about how to advertise their prog

rams without destroying the campus
environment," Massey said.
According to Massey, the Office of
Public Events distributes a rules
manual for the use of bulletin boards
and kiosks each fall. But some stu
dent effort is still needed. Massey
envisions a student patrol which will
scour walls and bulletin boards for
illegal or unauthorized posters. He
said he hopes help will come from
campus fraternities.
"The frats are social service or
ganizations and they might as well
perform their service for us," he
said. He urged students, faculty or
staff who observe violations to con
tact him or to call Service Opera
tions.
'Slumming'
Holt described the campus prob
lem as a "gradual decay and slum
ming" of the University and said the
problem is money. In the past, regu
lar interior and exterior repaintings
of buildings took place according to
a master schedule. But because the
University has tightened its budget,
money for maintenance is in short
supply.
A staff member of the Provost's of
fice commented, "What we basically
do now is wait'until somebody comp
lains. Then we go in — sometimes.
We just don't have the money to do
anything else."
Until a way is found to keep things
usable and appealing, the "gradual
decay and slumming" may continue.
"It really begins with the people
who use the facilities," said Massey.
"If they want a nice place to live and
learn in, they've got to keep campus
beautification on their minds."
