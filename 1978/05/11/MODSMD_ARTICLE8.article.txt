# Aliens exploited

The Commissioner of the Immigra
tion and Naturalization Service (INS),
Leonel Castillo, was on campus last
week to promote one of the most
racist and anti-labor pieces of legisla
tion currently before Congress.
But as Castillo was extolling the vir
tues of President Jimmy Carter's im
migration plan which he said would
"end the exploitation of the esti
mated three to six million illegal
aliens in this country" the predomi
nately Chicano audience was sys
tematically citing evidence to the
contrary.
A closer look at the Carter plan re
veals that it both singles out un
documented workers as scapegoats
of our sagging national economy and
would increase exploitation of all
workers of Mexican descent
(Chicanos, legal aliens, un
documented workers, etc.). Let us
examine three main aspects of the
Carter plan with these indictments in
mind.
Documented abuses
First, the Carter plan proposes to
add 2000 officers to the border patrol
as well as augment the present
amount of surveillance equipment.
This increased militarization of the
border will only contribute to the al
ready extensively documented
abuses by members of the border
patrol against both undocumented
workers, legal aliens and Chicanos.
There have been several recorded
cases where border patrolmen have
physically abused undocumented
workers and have flagrantly violated
the rights of many Chicano citizens.
More patrolmen can only lead to
more such racist attacks.
Secondly, the Carter plan prop
oses to levy $1000 fines on any
employer found guilty of knowingly
hiring an undocumented alien. This
sanction would effectively extend
the border patrol's policing function
to individual employers who would
be responsible under the law to
make sure they were employing no
illegal aliens.
General amnesty
The threat of receiving $1000 fines
would make many employers reluc
tant to hire anyone of "suspected
foreign background," i.e. Mexican
descent and would offer other al
ready racist employers further
rationale for not hiring Chicanos.
And finally, the "general amnesty"
for undocumented workers now liv
ing in the United States which Cas
tillo so proudly pointed to as an
example of Carter's
humanitarianism, is actually a way of
creating a legal sub-class of Mexican
workers and extending the control
and surveillance of Mexican workers
by the U.S. government.
The Carter plan would allow un
documented workers who have
been living in the country before
1970 to acquire legal status. This is
simply a restatement of an existing
law which permits long-term illegal
residents to claim resident status if
they go through the correct legal
procedures. It would not affect many
people since the bulk of un
documented workers have come
here since 1970.
Temporary status
This provision would also grant
"temporary status" to those un
documented aliens who have
worked in this country betwen 1970
and 1977. This affects by far the
greatest number of undocumented
workers from Mexico. During a one
year period undocumented aliens
would be able to sign up for the
program which would allow them to
remain in this country for a five year
period.
Any undocumented laborer who
does not sign up for the program
within the time limit is immediately
subject to deportation. Furthermore,
no guarantee is given to these "tem
porary status" workers that they wil!
be allowed to stay in the country after
the five-year grace period.
Those who do not sign up for the
program will live under increased

fear of discovery which makes them
far more exploitable by unscrupul
ous employers. Those who do sign
up for the program will not be able to
benefit from welfare, Medicare, aid
to dependent families, etc. even
though they pay taxes through their
checks.
Creating a sub-class
By signing up with the INS they can
be closely monitored and deported
after a five year period. This last
proposal, then, essentially creates a
sub-class which has no rights other
than the right to work in this country.
The Carter immigration plan is
another racist, anti-labor piece of
legislation in a long history of attacks
against workers of Mexican descent
in this country. During the Depres
sion there were massive repatria
tions of Mexican workers and in 1954
"Operation Wetback" expelled over
a million workers from the country.
It is quite clear that what precipa
tated those deportations is the same
problem which plagues us in the '70's
— a sagging national economy.
When the economy is in trouble, un
documented workers are quick and
easy prey to blame.
The Carter plan is a shameless
piece of legislation foran administra
tion that is avowedly concerned with
human rights abroad but which prac
tices discrimination and legalized
exploitation at home.

and 1977. This affects by far the
greatest number of undocumented
workers from Mexico. During a one
year period undocumented aliens
would be able to sign up for the
program which would allow them to
remain in this country for a five year
period.
Any undocumented laborer who
does not sign up for the program
within the time limit is immediately
subject to deportation. Furthermore,
no guarantee is given to these "tem
porary status" workers that they wil!
be allowed to stay in the country after
the five-year grace period.
Those who do not sign up for the
program will live under increased

fear of discovery which makes them
far more exploitable by unscrupul
ous employers. Those who do sign
up for the program will not be able to
benefit from welfare, Medicare, aid
to dependent families, etc. even
though they pay taxes through their
checks.
Creating a sub-class
By signing up with the INS they can
be closely monitored and deported
after a five year period. This last
proposal, then, essentially creates a
sub-class which has no rights other
than the right to work in this country.
The Carter immigration plan is
another racist, anti-labor piece of
legislation in a long history of attacks
against workers of Mexican descent
in this country. During the Depres
sion there were massive repatria
tions of Mexican workers and in 1954
"Operation Wetback" expelled over
a million workers from the country.
It is quite clear that what precipa
tated those deportations is the same
problem which plagues us in the '70's
— a sagging national economy.
When the economy is in trouble, un
documented workers are quick and
easy prey to blame.
The Carter plan is a shameless
piece of legislation foran administra
tion that is avowedly concerned with
human rights abroad but which prac
tices discrimination and legalized
exploitation at home.

The Commissioner of the Immigra
tion and Naturalization Service (INS),
Leonel Castillo, was on campus last
week to promote one of the most
racist and anti-labor pieces of legisla
tion currently before Congress.
But as Castillo was extolling the vir
tues of President Jimmy Carter's im
migration plan which he said would
"end the exploitation of the esti
mated three to six million illegal
aliens in this country" the predomi
nately Chicano audience was sys
tematically citing evidence to the
contrary.
A closer look at the Carter plan re
veals that it both singles out un
documented workers as scapegoats
of our sagging national economy and
would increase exploitation of all
workers of Mexican descent
(Chicanos, legal aliens, un
documented workers, etc.). Let us
examine three main aspects of the
Carter plan with these indictments in
mind.
Documented abuses
First, the Carter plan proposes to
add 2000 officers to the border patrol
as well as augment the present
amount of surveillance equipment.
This increased militarization of the
border will only contribute to the al
ready extensively documented
abuses by members of the border
patrol against both undocumented
workers, legal aliens and Chicanos.
There have been several recorded
cases where border patrolmen have
physically abused undocumented
workers and have flagrantly violated
the rights of many Chicano citizens.
More patrolmen can only lead to
more such racist attacks.
Secondly, the Carter plan prop
oses to levy $1000 fines on any
employer found guilty of knowingly
hiring an undocumented alien. This
sanction would effectively extend
the border patrol's policing function
to individual employers who would
be responsible under the law to
make sure they were employing no
illegal aliens.
General amnesty
The threat of receiving $1000 fines
would make many employers reluc
tant to hire anyone of "suspected
foreign background," i.e. Mexican
descent and would offer other al
ready racist employers further
rationale for not hiring Chicanos.
And finally, the "general amnesty"
for undocumented workers now liv
ing in the United States which Cas
tillo so proudly pointed to as an
example of Carter's
humanitarianism, is actually a way of
creating a legal sub-class of Mexican
workers and extending the control
and surveillance of Mexican workers
by the U.S. government.
The Carter plan would allow un
documented workers who have
been living in the country before
1970 to acquire legal status. This is
simply a restatement of an existing
law which permits long-term illegal
residents to claim resident status if
they go through the correct legal
procedures. It would not affect many
people since the bulk of un
documented workers have come
here since 1970.
Temporary status
This provision would also grant
"temporary status" to those un
documented aliens who have
worked in this country betwen 1970
and 1977. This affects by far the
greatest number of undocumented
workers from Mexico. During a one
year period undocumented aliens
would be able to sign up for the
program which would allow them to
remain in this country for a five year
period.
Any undocumented laborer who
