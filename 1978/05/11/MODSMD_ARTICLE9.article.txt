## Past provides instruction 
###

By tragic coincidence of history,
last Thursday marked both the eighth
anniversary of the killings at Kent
State and Yom Hashoah, the day Jews
commemorate the Holocaust. This
ironic coupling of the two brought to
mind a flood of thoughts and
memories.
During the Vietnam war it was fash
ionable among some radicals to
liken the United States to Nazi Ger
many. Not surprisingly, the compari
son angered conservatives, but it
also bothered other members of the
peace movement, who felt that such
an overdrawn equation with the Nazi
regime would only weaken the an
tiwar message.
It is true, of course, that the con
duct of our government in Indochina
never approached the vile, uncons
cionable depths of the concentration
camps. But to say that the Vietnam
war was not as horrible as the
Holocaust is hardly any praise for
what we did in Southeast Asia.
Wanton slaughter
In fact our guns and bombs laid
waste to a land and its people, mur
dering hundreds of thousands and
making refugees of millions more.
Vietnam, like the Holocaust, was an

act of wanton slaughter, if on a smal
ler scale.
But it was a different kind of
slaughter, thanks to the technology
of modern weaponry. Instead of
using concentration camps, the Un
ited States carried out its policy of
ruin largely through the bombs, mill
ions of tons of them, that were drop
ped on unseen people and villages
below. By thus separating the
executioner from his victim, Ameri
can military policy made for much
less public indignation than might
otherwise have been the case.
Weekly death tolls
The weekly death tolls of Viet
namese announced on our TV sc
reens meant nothing, as we divorced
humanity from the statistics of our
destruction. Only when the war be
came more personal did the public
become outraged, as in the massacre
at My Lai or the newspaper photo of
the South Vietnamese officer shoot
ing a prisoner at point-blank range.
Though one bomb could do the
damage of ten My Lais, this did not
distress us; the men in the B-52s and
other planes never saw their victims,
and neither did we.
Memories. They come in and out

of the mind at this time of the year,
the time when the invasion of Cam
bodia and the murders at Kent State
and Jackson State took place, the
time when the war finally ended
three years ago. These memories
must not be forgotten.
Elie Wiesel spoke on campus last
Thursday night of the need to re
member the Holocaust and its mill
ions of victims. The same is true of
the Vietnam war, when it was our
own government that was now
committing the carnage.
I shall never forget when I first
heard about the four murders at Kent
State. It was towards the end of my
freshman year at a small college in
Connecticut. I was in a large au
ditorium, where students were or
ganizing protests to the Cambodian
invasion launched a few days earlier.
Someone came in and told us about
the shootings.
Shock and numbness
A certain kind of shock and numb
ness seized me â€” kids my own age
murdered, for protesting the war.
The same feeling grabbed me a few
days later, when I heard a radio re
cording of 30 seconds of bullets
bursting into the dorm at Jackson
State in Mississippi. Each second
seemed much more than that, and
the whole world was out of its mind.
Two years later I was one of four
defendants on trial for chaining our
selves to the Federal Building in
Hartford, Connecticut to protest the
war. Acting as my own attorney, I was
giving a summation to the jury and
attempted to talk about my religious
motivation for demonstrating against
the war: "I've been told ever since I
was a little boy what it means to be a
Jew and what happened 30 years ago
in Germany. Right now the United
States is committing more extermi
nation in Indochina. Some call it
genocide. It might well be. But it is
something that must stop."
The judge cut me off at that point,
ruling my comments irrelevant. But
they were very relevant to me. I was
trying, as Elie Wiesel put it in a pas
sage I'd only read a few days earlier,
"to bear witness to what was, and to
what must be no longer." The trial
was a climactic moment for me. I had
found a new meaning in Judaism that
I tried to convey to the jury, which in
the end could not reach a verdict,
causing the charges to be dismissed.
Flood of memories
And so a flood of memories over
took me last Thursday. As a Jew I
grieved for the six million of my faith
who died in the gas chambers and
slaughterhouses in the most diaboli
cal acts history has ever known. And
as an American I grieved equally for
the millions of Indochinese killed
and made homeless by my own na
tion.
As Wiesel said Thursday night, we
must remember. The Holocaust and
the Vietnam war existed, they were
real, they were horribly real. Though
our memories may fill us with grief
and despair, we must hang onto
them lest the past be forgotten. We
must fight the efforts of shameless
authors who claim that the Holocaust
never took place.
And now, only a few years after the
Vietnam war ended, we must strug
gle against the willingness of so many
Americans to forget or deny the de
vastation committed in our names.
We must use our memories to spur
us into action against other kinds of
misery and injustice, whether they
be apartheid in South Africa, the op
pression of Jews in the Soviet Union,
or poverty here at home.
For if we do not remember the past
we shall let it be repeated, and once
again a reign of terror will stain the
record of humanity.
