# ASSESSMENTS PASS
## Record voter turnout brings second-chance win 
### Stephen Penico 
Preliminary results from the spe
cial election held Wednesday and
Thursday indicate that all eight prop
osed fee assessments passed, ac
cording to Will Nixon, elections
commissioner.
Nixon was approved last night by
the ASSU Senate as next year's elec
tions commissioner.
The assessments which failed last
month because of insufficient turn
out brought a record 3400 voters to
the polls in this election, said Nixon.
The results are preliminary, pend
ing the arrival of results from ballot
ing at overseas campuses, he said.
Overseas ballots
But the expected 100 to 150 votes
from those campuses would not af
fect the outcome for any of the as
sessments, he added.
The election was called by the
ASSU Senate to allow the student
groups a second chance of obtaining
more than $110,000 in student-paid
assessments next year.
In the election held on April 19 and

20, only three of 11 fee requests on
the ballot (KZSU, the Band and the
Daily) garnered the 20 per cent voter
turnout necessary for passage by the
ASSU Constitution.
However, none of the fee assess
ments was "voted down," former
Elections Commissioner Sean Mur
phy said two weeks ago. The eight
simply did not receive the required
voter turnout.
Election results
In this week's election the Legal
Counseling Office received
92 per cent "yes" votes, the highest
of all the assessments.
The Speakers Bureau received 91
per cent followed by ASSU Program
Fee with 88 per cent, Publications
Board with 86 per cent, Stanford
Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE) with 84 per cent, Cuest Pro
fessorship Board with 82 per cent,
Academic Organizations Board with
79 per cent and the Graduate Stu
dents Association with 74 per cent
affirmative votes.
Regina Petty, a member of the
Academic Organizations Board
(AOB), said she was "extremely
pleased about the elections."
"It's excellent that the individual
groups involved got out and lobbied
for the assessments," she said.
Save costs
To save costs in the special elec
tions, all groups involved agreed to
coordinate efforts. The groups seek
ing fee assessments supplied chairs
and tables, and members manned
the polls.
The cost of the election, estimated
to be about $600, will be paid for by
the groups involved.
'Didn't understand'
Most of the students didn't under
stand the implications of the loss of
funds. When students realized what
they would actually be losing they
got out and voted, Petty added.
ASSU Sen. Rick Levy said many
groups will be relieved by the pas
sage of the fee assessments, because
they are relying on the fees as their
sole source of funding.
"I'm especially pleased for the
minority and political groups whose
effectiveness will be enhanced with
these funds," he said.
Without the fee assessments,
funding for many groups could be
difficult to find. University funding is
"tight," ASSU Chairperson Fred
Grethel said two weeks ago.
No other sources
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said this week, "the fact is,
there are no other sources of funds,"
for the organizations.
Lyons also said Wednesday that if
the eight assessments did not pass, it
would be "a loss deeply felt by a sig
nificant number of students."
Crethel said the fee assessments
had failed to get the necessary

number of votes in the last election
because they had fallen under the
"general veil of apathy" which sur
rounds student politics at Stanford.
Students don't feel that they have a
say in decision-making on campus,
he said.
But he added that the fee assess
ments are some of the few inputs
students here have.
On Wednesday, former Co
president Greg Larson said the fee
collection process is "fair," noting
that all fees are refundable after
being collected.
Petty complimented the Band on
its participation in the attempt to get
people to vote.
The Band made it "fun to vote" by
providing noon concerts, she said.
However, not everyone was
pleased with the drive to get people
to vote. Barry Parr, Publications
Board Chairman, said the Daily
"blatantly manipulated" the news in
order to encourage students to vote.

Preliminary results from the spe
cial election held Wednesday and
Thursday indicate that all eight prop
osed fee assessments passed, ac
cording to Will Nixon, elections
commissioner.
Nixon was approved last night by
the ASSU Senate as next year's elec
tions commissioner.
The assessments which failed last
month because of insufficient turn
out brought a record 3400 voters to
the polls in this election, said Nixon.
The results are preliminary, pend
ing the arrival of results from ballot
ing at overseas campuses, he said.
Overseas ballots
But the expected 100 to 150 votes
from those campuses would not af
fect the outcome for any of the as
sessments, he added.
The election was called by the
ASSU Senate to allow the student
groups a second chance of obtaining
more than $110,000 in student-paid
assessments next year.
In the election held on April 19 and

20, only three of 11 fee requests on
the ballot (KZSU, the Band and the
Daily) garnered the 20 per cent voter
turnout necessary for passage by the
ASSU Constitution.
However, none of the fee assess
ments was "voted down," former
Elections Commissioner Sean Mur
phy said two weeks ago. The eight
simply did not receive the required
voter turnout.
Election results
In this week's election the Legal
Counseling Office received
92 per cent "yes" votes, the highest
of all the assessments.
The Speakers Bureau received 91
per cent followed by ASSU Program
Fee with 88 per cent, Publications
Board with 86 per cent, Stanford
Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE) with 84 per cent, Cuest Pro
fessorship Board with 82 per cent,
Academic Organizations Board with
79 per cent and the Graduate Stu
dents Association with 74 per cent
affirmative votes.
Regina Petty, a member of the
Academic Organizations Board
(AOB), said she was "extremely
pleased about the elections."
"It's excellent that the individual
groups involved got out and lobbied
for the assessments," she said.
Save costs
To save costs in the special elec
tions, all groups involved agreed to
coordinate efforts. The groups seek
ing fee assessments supplied chairs
and tables, and members manned
the polls.
The cost of the election, estimated
to be about $600, will be paid for by
the groups involved.
'Didn't understand'
Most of the students didn't under
stand the implications of the loss of
funds. When students realized what
they would actually be losing they
got out and voted, Petty added.
ASSU Sen. Rick Levy said many
groups will be relieved by the pas
sage of the fee assessments, because
they are relying on the fees as their
sole source of funding.
"I'm especially pleased for the
minority and political groups whose
effectiveness will be enhanced with
these funds," he said.
Without the fee assessments,
funding for many groups could be
difficult to find. University funding is
"tight," ASSU Chairperson Fred
Grethel said two weeks ago.
No other sources
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said this week, "the fact is,
there are no other sources of funds,"
for the organizations.
Lyons also said Wednesday that if
the eight assessments did not pass, it
would be "a loss deeply felt by a sig
nificant number of students."
Crethel said the fee assessments
had failed to get the necessary

number of votes in the last election
because they had fallen under the
"general veil of apathy" which sur
rounds student politics at Stanford.
Students don't feel that they have a
say in decision-making on campus,
he said.
But he added that the fee assess
ments are some of the few inputs
students here have.
On Wednesday, former Co
president Greg Larson said the fee
collection process is "fair," noting
that all fees are refundable after
being collected.
Petty complimented the Band on
its participation in the attempt to get
people to vote.
The Band made it "fun to vote" by
providing noon concerts, she said.
