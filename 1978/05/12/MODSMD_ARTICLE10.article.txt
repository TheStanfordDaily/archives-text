# Students isolating themselves from outside
## 
### 
Josh Frieman

It is a typically sunny April morning
in Palo Alto, California, the kind of
spring day which steers young minds
away from their books, and stirs
young hearts to poetically amorous
thoughts.
A blonde-haired, thinly-clad girl, a
piece of black funeral cloth looking
strangely out of place bound to her
arm, tries to gain the interest of the
passersby recently freed from class
by handing out green sheets of
paper. A young couple approaches.
"There'll be a rally in 10 minutes to
protest the trustees' vote on the
Texaco South Africa proxy. Have you
seen SCRIP'S position paper?"
"I already have a copy," the male
partner responds and brushes past
her. Several steps later, the couple
breaks into laughter, for the man has
told his companion that he hasn't
really seen the position paper.
Ahead of them on their path
through White Plaza, an older man is
selling a newspaper. The couple ap
proaches, and he asks them to buy.
This time the female partner re
sponds, "I already have a copy/' and
again the couple finds amusement in
the lie. As they pass between the
Bookstore and the Claw, the male
partner becomes bolder and pro
claims in a loud voice, "I don't have
a copy of the SCRIP position paper,
and I don't have a copy of the Work
er's Vanguard!"
He is proud. These are fine
achievements. He lowers his voice
and continues, "I don't know how
I'm going to get through these two
five-pagers."

The above is part fiction, mostly
fact, but it is an epitome. We are a
community torn, dichotomized. We
are torn between concern and indif
ference.
Zealous concern on the part of a
number of students has transformed
South Africa and its system of apar
theid into a campus campaign, if not
a crusade. But they seem to have
buried the central issue under a
mountain of words. We have been
inundated by rhetoric, by technical
jargon and mystifying language.
The reaction among many has
been confusion, and therefore
apathy, indifference, and alienation:
the student who doesn't understand
a lecture is quickly bored and stops
listening or walks out.
To add to his perplexity, the pro
fessor speaks in a foreign tongue. To
many, the words apartheid and
proxy, and such acronyms as SCRIP
and CIR are meaningless.
We stop listening
As a result, the subject itself is for
gotten, and instead of serving merely
to publicize the issue, intermediaries
such as SCRIP become controversies
in themselves. Confusion com
pounds confusion. So we stop listen
ing and close ourselves off. But this is
letting us off too easily.
If it were only the difficulty of un
derstanding the complicated and
multi-faceted issue of Stanford's in
volvement in South Africa, our ac
tion, or lack of it, might be partly
excusable. It would be easy to say
this is just an isolated problem of
education and communication.
But this is only a symptom of the

larger problem of student apathy to
wards anything which goes on out
side the Stanford campus.
We go to college, in part, in an
effort to turn out socially responsible
human beings who are aware of, and
concerned about, the myriad prob
lems current in the world. Most of
us, however, are more concerned
about the grade on our next mid
terms.
But why are we here? To get A's so
we can go to graduate school and get
good jobs? To close ourselves in
cubicles-and study hard all week so
we can release the tension such
monastic cloistering builds up, on
the weekend?
If we aren't interested enough in
what directly concerns Stanford it
self, how do we expect to become

"citizens of the world"?
Alexis de Tocqueville, observing
the mores and habits of this country
over a 150 years ago, warned of a
developing apathy as leading to the
downfall of democracy. If we lose the
desire to take charge of our affairs,
we make way for others to spoon
feed us our existence.
Mores parallel economy
Student mores and attitudes de
velop in cycles which roughly paral
lel the economy: we either have the
leisure to be radicals (especially if we
have something like an unjust war to
protest against), or we are forced by
recession to live solely for our
careers.
But one can actively pursue a
career while having other concerns.
One can get the necessary A's while

having other concerns. Otherwise, if
we completely close ourselves off to
everything which does not directly
lie in the narrow path to success, we
shall have lost all that gives meaning
to our endeavors.
SCRIP has not handled itself per
fectly; it has taken certain attitudes
which have hurt its cause. But its
ultimate aim is one with which no
one can take issue: to end the evils of
apartheid. And for this, no matter
how much we may disagree with
their means or tactics, we should re
spect them and listen to them and
question them.
Let us get back to the issue at hand.
Look up from this page and look at
the human beings, not just the stu
dents, sitting around you.

young hearts to poetically amorous
thoughts.
A blonde-haired, thinly-clad girl, a
piece of black funeral cloth looking
strangely out of place bound to her
arm, tries to gain the interest of the
passersby recently freed from class
by handing out green sheets of
paper. A young couple approaches.
"There'll be a rally in 10 minutes to
protest the trustees' vote on the
Texaco South Africa proxy. Have you
seen SCRIP'S position paper?"
"I already have a copy," the male
partner responds and brushes past
her. Several steps later, the couple
breaks into laughter, for the man has
told his companion that he hasn't
really seen the position paper.
Ahead of them on their path
through White Plaza, an older man is
selling a newspaper. The couple ap
proaches, and he asks them to buy.
This time the female partner re
sponds, "I already have a copy/' and
again the couple finds amusement in
the lie. As they pass between the
Bookstore and the Claw, the male
partner becomes bolder and pro
claims in a loud voice, "I don't have
a copy of the SCRIP position paper,
and I don't have a copy of the Work
er's Vanguard!"
He is proud. These are fine
achievements. He lowers his voice
and continues, "I don't know how
I'm going to get through these two
five-pagers."

The above is part fiction, mostly
fact, but it is an epitome. We are a
community torn, dichotomized. We
are torn between concern and indif
ference.
Zealous concern on the part of a
number of students has transformed
South Africa and its system of apar
theid into a campus campaign, if not
a crusade. But they seem to have
buried the central issue under a
mountain of words. We have been
inundated by rhetoric, by technical
jargon and mystifying language.
The reaction among many has
been confusion, and therefore
apathy, indifference, and alienation:
the student who doesn't understand
a lecture is quickly bored and stops
listening or walks out.
To add to his perplexity, the pro
fessor speaks in a foreign tongue. To
many, the words apartheid and
proxy, and such acronyms as SCRIP
and CIR are meaningless.
We stop listening
As a result, the subject itself is for
gotten, and instead of serving merely
to publicize the issue, intermediaries
such as SCRIP become controversies
in themselves. Confusion com
pounds confusion. So we stop listen
ing and close ourselves off. But this is
letting us off too easily.
If it were only the difficulty of un
derstanding the complicated and
multi-faceted issue of Stanford's in
volvement in South Africa, our ac
tion, or lack of it, might be partly
excusable. It would be easy to say
this is just an isolated problem of
education and communication.
But this is only a symptom of the

larger problem of student apathy to
wards anything which goes on out
side the Stanford campus.
We go to college, in part, in an
effort to turn out socially responsible
human beings who are aware of, and
concerned about, the myriad prob
lems current in the world. Most of
us, however, are more concerned
about the grade on our next mid
terms.
But why are we here? To get A's so
we can go to graduate school and get
good jobs? To close ourselves in
cubicles-and study hard all week so
we can release the tension such
monastic cloistering builds up, on
the weekend?
If we aren't interested enough in
what directly concerns Stanford it
self, how do we expect to become

"citizens of the world"?
Alexis de Tocqueville, observing
the mores and habits of this country
over a 150 years ago, warned of a
developing apathy as leading to the
downfall of democracy. If we lose the
desire to take charge of our affairs,
we make way for others to spoon
feed us our existence.
Mores parallel economy
Student mores and attitudes de
velop in cycles which roughly paral
lel the economy: we either have the
leisure to be radicals (especially if we
have something like an unjust war to
protest against), or we are forced by
recession to live solely for our
careers.
But one can actively pursue a
career while having other concerns.
One can get the necessary A's while

having other concerns. Otherwise, if
we completely close ourselves off to
everything which does not directly
lie in the narrow path to success, we
shall have lost all that gives meaning
to our endeavors.
SCRIP has not handled itself per
fectly; it has taken certain attitudes
which have hurt its cause. But its
ultimate aim is one with which no
one can take issue: to end the evils of
apartheid. And for this, no matter
how much we may disagree with
their means or tactics, we should re
spect them and listen to them and
question them.
Let us get back to the issue at hand.
Look up from this page and look at
the human beings, not just the stu
dents, sitting around you.
