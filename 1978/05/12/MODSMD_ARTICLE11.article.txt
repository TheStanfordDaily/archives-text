Ministers voice concern
(This letter was jointly submitted by
18 ministers in the local community,
one of whom is Rev. Wendy Smith.)
We are concerned about the Stan
ford University Board of Trustees de
cision to vote against proxy resolu
tions calling for Texaco's withdrawal
from South Africa and investigation
into allegations of Texaco's selling of
oil to Rhodesia in violation of a Un
ited Nation's embargo.
By this decision, the Board of Trus
tees acted against the unanimous re
commendation of the Commission
on Investment Responsibility. The
overturned recommendations were,
in our opinion, persuasive, insightful
and morally responsible.
Several of our churches and cam
pus ministries gave testimony at the
campus hearing that was part of ClR's
fact finding charge.
We are especially concerned since
this decision comes after a policy of
abstention on last year's proxy resol
utions calling for withdrawal. Our
concern is increased in light of the
negligible financial loss to the Uni
versity of a "yes" vote.

We realize the seriousness of the
moral crisis we face. We feel that
substantial student and community
support has been demonstrated in
favor of ClR's recommendations in
the future.

Progressive force bankrupt
The trustees affirmative vote on
the recent Phelps Dodge proxy cal
ling for that corporation to withdraw
from South Africa was a step in the
right direction. It is the first time that
the trustees have committed them
selves to calling for a corporation to
withdraw. However, I feel that step
was nowhere near large enough.
The trustees' actions were consis
tent with their policy that corpora
tions can be a progressive force for
change in South Africa. The trustees
still maintain that distinction bet
ween corporations that integrate
toilets and those who do not. The
trustees still maintain that there is a
distinction between U.S. corpora
tions who pay their black workers
less that than South African counter
parts and those who do not. To look
at the question in these terms is only
to miss the whole point of corporate
withdrawal.
The point is that apartheid is an
economically based system. The
cheap, mobile sources of labor it
provides are vital to the functioning
of the South African economy. U.S.
corporations, on the basis of the
technology and capital that they pro

vide (computers, oil refineries and
bank loans, for example), are now an
integral part of this economy. So the
stability and maintenance of the pre
sent system is in their interest as well
as in the interest of white South Af
rica.
Any weakening of this system
would threaten the profits of both.
So any changes brought about by
their presence in South Africa would
necessarily be only cosmetic. Mean
while, while they remain there, they
provide vital political and economic
support to the government.
If the trustees are so progressive,
then why did they vote against CIR
recommendations on the Texaco,
Standard Oil, Mobil and Bank of
America proxies?
One reason might be that the trus
tees are composed of predominantly
people like John Gray. He also serves
on the board of directors of Bank of
America, and is president of Stan
dard Oil, which together with
Texaco, owns Caltex, an oil refinery
operation in South Africa. This might
be one of the causes of the differing
perceptions Richard Lyman tells us
the trustees have from the rest of the
community.
The "progressive force" argument
is bankrupt. The trustees must adopt
a policy of overall corporate with
drawal. I urge the Stanford commun
ity not to be mislead by the trustees
action and sustain their efforts to get
the trustees to adopt this policy.
