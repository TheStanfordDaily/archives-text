# Major fundraiser for the Bridge begins today
## Spring Faire combines art, food, entertainment features 
### Ben Pollock 
Over 140 booths of crafts, art, food and bever
age will turn White Plaza into a maze of organic
culture this weekend for the seventh annual
Stanford Spring Faire.
The Faire, held today through Sunday, from 10
a.m. to 6 p.m., has no admission charge. It is the
principle money maker for the Bridge, "a peer
counseling and personal growth center" lo
cated at 640 Campus Dr.
Raffle tickets, in the form of receipts from
Spring Faire purchases, will give people a
chance to win any of several dozen prizes do
nated by Spring Faire participants. The drawing
will be held Sunday afternoon.
Raises funds
"About 90 per cent of the Bridge funds come
from the Spring Faire," said Don Gallagher,
Bridge coordinator.
"Last year, the Bridge made $9000 from the
Spring Faire, according to )ane Turner, a Bridge
staffer.
Gallagher said that the guiding principle of
the Bridge is that "People can help each other
and you don't need to be a professional to do
that."
He said that Bridge staffers believe "in
people's ability to help themselves, and we pro
vide support for them."
Services
The Bridge offers drop-in peer counseling six
days a week, workshops on everything from as
trology to massage, an information and referral

service and a 24-hour crisis line.
Entertainment at the Spring Faire will be non
stop. Bay-area musicians William Ackerman,
Alex DeGrassi, Tom Hunter and others will be
performing.
Wirewalkers, face-painters, and jugglers will
amuse spectators, as well as belly dancers, tarot
readers, mimes and eccentric musicians.
Gallagher said that the entertainers are not
officially paid, but instead "pass the hat."
Food booths
The food booths will offer "Mrs. Fields'
Cookies," strawberry shortcake, quiche, soft
pretzels, fresh lemonade, and selections of Viet
namese, Lithuanian, Indian and Thai cuisine.
The Bridge did not need to "recruit"
craftspeople for the Faire because it is "quite
well known," Gallagher said.
He also said planning for this year's Spring
Faire stated "four months ago."
Among the handmade arts and handicrafts to
be displayed are pottery, jewelry, leather, furni
ture, stained glass, toys, clothes, and etchings.
Selection
"Over 500 people were screened for the 120
spaces," Gallagher said. He said the artists
were selected for their diversity and their quality
of work.
He said a few social action groups will also
have booths.
"The Faire is the best opportunity to involve
everyone on campus with the Bridge," said Gal
lagher.
