# Haus Mitteleuropa to bring German culture here
## 
### Susan Larsen 
"Haus Mitteleuropa will de
finitely be an asset to the Ger
man Studies department. It will
be a good place for students to
live before or after going over
seas, or even instead of, for
those students whose
schedules do not permit them
to spend a quarter in Berlin or
Vienna," stated Maria Biege,
future resident fellow of the
new German Studies theme
house.
The theme house will be lo
cated at 620 Mayfield, replac
ing the present Simone de
Beauvoir House, which was
Androgyny House earlier this
year, and Jordan House before
that.
The culture, politics and his
tory of the people of Central
Europe will be the specific

theme of Haus Mitteleuropa,
according to Biege. Residents
will be encouraged to speak
German "as much as possible"
in the house and are required
to complete fourth quarter
German. Afterward they must
take at least one German lan
guage or literature course a
year, in addition to three units
of in-house seminar.
The concept of a German
Studies house was thought up
and approved during winter
quarter last year. Once plans
for the house were finalized, a
core group of five students was
quickly chosen from a pool of
20 applicants to coordinate
house activities for the first
year.
Members of this core group
include Kevin Kearney, a
chemistry major; freshman

Linda Chin, who will be social
director; juniorTodd Doersch,
a double major in german liter
ature and economics, who will
be house manager; and junior
Linda Uyechi, an electrical en
gineering major who will be fi
nancial director, junior Mark
Phillips, also an electrical en
gineering major, will be assis
tant to both Doersch and
Uyechi.
"You could say that most of
the core people are reasonably
pysched about next year," said
Kearney. "We are looking for
ward to it with the vague idea
that it will be a lot of work, but
we expect it will be successful
judging from the enthusiasm
everyone involved has shown
thus far."
According to Biege, "a great
many students" attended the
open houses held during the
week before the housing draw,
and 55 students submitted
proposals for in-house semi
nars to obtain first priority for
the house. Ten other students
signed the house agreement to
obtain second priority.
The house only has room for
33 to 34 residents, according to
Doersch. The exact capacity of
both living and dining areas
has not yet been determined
by the Row Housing Office.
"We definitely want eating
associates, but we're not sure
how many we can take because
we're not sure how many the
dining room can hold,"
explained Doersch. "The more
people involved in the house,
the more exciting the atmos
phere will be."
The core group had nothing
to do with determining the
exact focus of the house, ex
cept for several members who
worked on the committee last

year preparing the original
house proposal.
The committee chose the
broad area of Central European
culture rather than focusing
solely on German culture for
two reasons, according to
Biege.
"First, Stanford students go
to both campuses in Germany
and Austria, and German is
spoken there and also in Swit
zerland; so it seemed approp
riate to link those three areas
together for the reason of the
bond established by language.
"Secondly, the name of the
department, German Studies,
implies a broader scope as
well. We teach courses in
German culture, as well as in
language and literature," she
explained. "It was felt that a
house focusing on the culture
of Central Europe would best
augment what is already being
taught."
Kearney said the core
group's objectives for the
house are: to allow students to
develop their ability to speak
German; to further an under
standing and an awareness of
Central European culture; and
to meet the needs of the
people in the house.
The house's theme will be
reflected in cuisine as well as
academic and social offerings.
Doersch is still searching for a
cook who specializes in Cent
ral European dishes.
"We're looking for someone
who's very good at German,
Swiss and Austrian cuisine,

preferably someone who is
competent in the language,
and also someone who will be
nefit the house by his or her
Doersch said.
One in-house seminar the
group plans to sponsor each
quarter will be a cooking ciass
which will prepare one meal
each weekend, according to
Doersch, as the cook will
probably prepare only 10 meals
a week.
Kearney said the house plans
to sponsor other seminars next
year on such topics as Current
Events in Central Europe, the
History of the Weimar Repub
lic, German Thought, the Jew
in Central European Culture
and Society, and German
Fairytales and Legends.
Other seminars which may
be taught in the house include
studies of Popular German
Culture and Central European
dialects, as well as weekend
workshops on travel in Central
Europe, according to Biege.
The seminars will "probably
not receive departmental cre
dit towards the German
Studies major," according to
Kearney. "We are definitely
trying to make the seminars
different from regular Univer
sity courses. We're looking for
instructors who are willing to
approach the subject in origi
nal way," stated Kearney.
"We'd like them to be well
attended. Anyone interested is
welcome to sign up for the
courses."
The core group also plans to

sponsor a German film series
in the house and "we will have
quite a sizeable library, and a
large selection of weekly Aust
rian, Swiss and German news
papers," remarked Biege.
How best to encourage Mit
teleuropa residents to speak
German is one point the core
group has not yet resolved.
Kearney said he had "imagined
a sort of saturation in the lan
guage and the culture," but he
reported that the director of
the Italian theme house, Casa
Italiana, had stressed that "the
needs of the people in the
house must come first."
"We don't want to alienate
those people who have only
had one quarter of the lan
guage by insisting that
everyone speak it at all times.
Right now, we think that speak
ing German in the house will
be encouraged, but not en
forced," stated Kearney.
Biege, a native of Stradtha
gen, Germany, said she felt
one of her main tasks would be

"to encourage people to speak
German, to devise some sys
tem whereby advanced stu
dents can speak as much as
they want, without overpower
ing students who are not as
fluent."
However, the core group in
tends to sponsor quite a few
events whose primary purpose
is recreational, rather than
strictly educational. Social di
rector Chin anticipates that the
first "theme-oriented" social
activity will be an Oktoberfest
in the first or second week of
October. The festival will in
clude small booths, the prep
aration of special foods,
"hopefully" a German band,
and "lots of beer."
Mitteleuropa residents will
also celebrate the German
Christmas on December 6, ac
cording to Chin, and
"throughout the school year
we will be emphasizing Central
European holidays which are
not usually celebrated in the
United States."
