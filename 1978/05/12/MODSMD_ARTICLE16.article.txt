COMING HOME ****
Regency 11, San Francisco
Set in 1968, "Coming
Home" is a drama about
people at home dealing with
the Vietnam War. One of its
major characters is unde
fined, and it occasionally suf
fers from poor transition, but
the movie more than makes
up for these deficiencies with
its understanding of the look
and feel of the time. Jane
Fonda and Jon Voight (as a
paraplegic) are excellent; and
Hal Ashby's direction is fine
throughout.

THE SERPENT'S EGG ***
Varsity
One of Ingmar Bergman's
worst movies. However, this
story of an American circus
performer and a cabaret
singer in 1923 Berlin does
boast the extraordinary Liv
Ullman and the brilliant
cinematography of Sven Nyk
vist. With David Carradine
and Gert Froebe.

STRAIGHT TIME **
Park
Matter-of-factness is the life
and death of this picture. At
its best "Straight Time" has a
good-natured normalcy and
distance that permits it to be
objective about an ex-con's
nightmare; at its less-than
best the thing is just another
scathing indictment of the
American criminal justice sys
tem. Dustin Hoffman's dazed
posture and good intentions
are enough initially to make
us glad he never met Dirty
Harry, and Harry Dean Stan
ton's J. Emmett Walsh is a
masterpiece of sliminess,
but Walsh meets his tate early

on in the film, and from there
its just like 90 zillion other
ex-con movies. I didn't like
them either.

THE 39 STEPS and
SABOTAGE *****
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Two of Alfred Hitchcock's
best movies, both made in
Great Britain during the mid
'3os. "The 39 Steps" stars
Robert Donat in the ar
chetypal Hitchcock plot: the
innocent man attempting to
discover the truth while flee
ing from the authorities.
"Sabotage'' is an adaption
of Conrad's "The Secret
Agent," and stars Oscar
Homolka as the deliciously
evil terrorist Verloc.

CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE
THIRD KIND *****
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
Steven Spielberg's wonder
fully childlike fantasy about
man's first meeting with ex
traterrestial beings. Spielberg
is clearly indebted to Hitch
cock, but in all the right
ways, and he has the youthful
exuberance that Hitchcock
lost about four decades ago.
The unfortunate thing about
"Close Encounters" is that it
came so soon after "Star
Wars," a situation which pro
vokes unnecessary and mis
leading comparisons bet
ween the two.

TOM JONES *****
Friday night, Kresge Aud.
Tony Richardson's bawdy
and excitingadaption of Field
ing's novel stars a youthful
Albert Finney as the lovable

rogue. Sex and eating are jux
taposed brilliantly in a justly
famous scene.

DIRTY HARRY ***
Saturday night, Cubberley Aud.
Clint Eastwood plays God,
also known as Harry Callahan,
in this film about an "ends jus
tify the means" cop. A celeb
ration of urban vigilante jus
tice, "Dirty Harry" must have
struck a nerve somewhere;
the film was very popular and
it spawned two sequels.

STAR WARS * ★ *
Old Mill
At first glance, 1) stunningly en

tertaining and wildly visual 2)
wildly entertaining and stun
ningly visual 3) the kind of
movie nobody makes anymore.
On second thought, a deliber
ately anesthetic, vapid and
happy sell-out. Except for Alec
Guiness the actors are not un
like Barbie dolls, or escapees
from an episode of Lassie;
though Lucas is to be praised
for avoiding the asinine politi
cal commentary implicit in
things like Rollerball and Lo
gan's Run his decision to center
the action around the aformen

tioned members of the Pepsi
Generation rankles and irks
and peeves. True 2001 fans in
sist that for all its visual
achievements Star Wars is really
very bland — even though I still
don't know what the hell was
going on in Kubrick's movie I
am tempted to agree.

Director Fred Zinnemann's
superb craftsmanship and
complete intelligence domi
nate this film about friendship
and its responsibilities. |ane
Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave
star in this true story based on a
chapter of Lillian Hellman's au
tobiographical book Pen
timento. Both are brilliant;
Fonda effectively captures
Hellman's spirited personality,
and Redgrave delivers a fine,
understated performance as
the idealistic lulia. A must-see
film.

SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER
Bijou ★ ★ ★
No nutritional value. Also very
good. A dopey plot and only
one real actor and stupid
dialogue— pure schlock — but
still a damn good film and you
should see it. Even though
John Travolta makes a tool of
himself every week on TV he is
a legitimate star here; as the
best disco dancer in the entire
one-mile radius of this picture
he gives power to what other
wise would have been awful
No one will blame you if you
loathe, despise, detest and
abhor this picture because of
its unrepentant dumbness;
still, if you scoff too loudly at
followers we a re liable to punch
you in the nose.

THE FURY * *
Palo Alto Square
An empty style piece. Director
Brian DePalma gets great sequ
ences, but he has f no vision in
this mess about a telekinetic
boy and girl. Nothing con
nects; the script is terrible and
the characterization is worse.
The film is too serious for satire,
but the climax has all the ele
ments of classic parody ()ohn
Cassavetes literally gets
blownup; we see his frag
mented body from about six
different angles. The scene
must be the ultimate in camp
horror.)
R.L.
THE TURNING POINT * *
Old Mill
A movie about bitchy people
who won't shut up. The film is
done in by its soap opera plot
based on beliefs straight from
the fifties. For example, Shirley
MacLaine gives up her career
because she gets married. The
film seems to say that a woman
can't have a career and love
both. The film's only redeem
ing feature is Baryshnikov's
dancing; basically, the movie is
too much soap opera and not
enought ballet.
R.L.
AN UNMARRIED WOMAN
Old Mill
Paul Ma/ursky's ("Harry and
Tonto") warm and intelli
gent look at '70s divorce. Jill
Clayburgh finally gets a role
which is equal to her talent, and
she doesn't disappoint. The
supporting cast is solid, with
Alan Bates standing out. The
film is a bit slow in its middle
third, but is generally strong
and honest. Comic without
being cruel, touching without
being saccharine.
