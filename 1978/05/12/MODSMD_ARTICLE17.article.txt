## Behind 'The Last Waltz' 
### 
At first glance, "The Last
Waltz" seems like a striking
departure for its director, Mar
tin Scorsese. Why would the
maker of "Taxi Driver" and
"Alice Doesn't Live Here Any
more" want to film The Band's
last concert?
But, as Scorsese explained in
an interview last week, "The
Last Waltz" fits into his body of
work in that "it was rock 'n'
roll. I was always interested in
rock 'n' roll. 'Mean Streets'
(made in 1973) is a good exam
ple; it had a rock soundtrack.
'Who's That Knocking at My
Door,' my first film (made in
1969), that's rock 'n' roll."
Also, "The Last Waltz" is
similar to Scorsese's past work
because "it's about love and
friendship . . . breaking apart,
yet coming together, that sort
of thing. It has a lot to do with
relationships. That's why we
concentrate on the stage; no
audience shots."
Interviews
The interviews in the film are
intended to "set down who
The Band is, and why we're
making a film on them." He
chose to do the interviews
himself because "it was the
easiest thing to do; nobody

else was around. I'm a terrible
interviewer. We made fun of it
that way. I left in all the mis
takes, and had them even ask
ing me 'could you say that
again?' several times."
"They were friends of mine.
It would have been silly to
bring in anyone else to inter
view them . It was just like 'go
on Robbie (Robertson,
guitarist for The Band) tell
them what its about.' "
Scorsese's original intention
was just "to film the concert."
But he now feels that the film is
something more than just
filmed concert: "After we got
the rushes back from the con
cert, we realized we had some
thing much more interesting."
"We decided to shoot some
documentary, and then from
there to shoot the three scenes
inside the soundstage: 'The
Weight,' 'Evangeline,' and 'The
Last Waltz Suite.' These were
shot like a feature film."
Cilliatt asleep
One of the few bad reviews
that the film has received was
written by Penelope Gilliatt in
The New Yorker. Scorsese said
that Gilliatt "was asleep during
the film, from the reports that
I've got. Also, there are other

things I don't really want to get
into; they might be detrimen
tal to people."
"But she really didn't see the
film. She liked the interviews
and wanted more of them. But
when she quoted the inter
views, she quoted the wrong
things; in other words, nobody
said what's quoted in The New
Yorker. I don't see how any cri
tic could go see a movie, fall
asleep and do their job prop
erly."
In general, the film turned
out to be "more difficult" than
Scorsese had anticipated. "In
shooting the concert, I didn't
expect any difficulty, and it
went smoothly. But then we
did more and more and more;
it got bigger and bigger. It
turned into the biggest
sound mix in history (seven
months). That was difficult."
"There was nothing you
could do about it. The basis of
the film is the music, and the
music has to be right. The
problem was timing; to get the
sound right. With 48 tracks, if
one of them was out of sync, it
takes hours to find it. You have
to listen to each track."
Also the film's Dolby sound

system presented some prob
lems: "A reel is ten minutes
long. With the Dolby system, if
you go nine minutes and every
thing is perfect and in that last
minute of film something really
bad happens, you have to redo
all nine minutes. So if you get it
and work at it night after night,
all you have do is mess up one
thing and you have to go back

and redo the whole reel."
Scorsese's next film will be
entitled "Raging Bull." It will
star Robert De Niro, in his
fourth film for Scorsese, as
boxer Jake LaMotta. Scorsese
will begin shooting in "Sep
tember or October" of this
year, with the release date for
the film tentatively set for late
1979.

an interview last week, "The
Last Waltz" fits into his body of
work in that "it was rock 'n'
roll. I was always interested in
rock 'n' roll. 'Mean Streets'
(made in 1973) is a good exam
ple; it had a rock soundtrack.
'Who's That Knocking at My
Door,' my first film (made in
1969), that's rock 'n' roll."
Also, "The Last Waltz" is
similar to Scorsese's past work
because "it's about love and
friendship . . . breaking apart,
yet coming together, that sort
of thing. It has a lot to do with
relationships. That's why we
concentrate on the stage; no
audience shots."
Interviews
The interviews in the film are
intended to "set down who
The Band is, and why we're
making a film on them." He
chose to do the interviews
himself because "it was the
easiest thing to do; nobody

else was around. I'm a terrible
interviewer. We made fun of it
that way. I left in all the mis
takes, and had them even ask
ing me 'could you say that
again?' several times."
"They were friends of mine.
It would have been silly to
bring in anyone else to inter
view them . It was just like 'go
on Robbie (Robertson,
guitarist for The Band) tell
them what its about.' "
Scorsese's original intention
was just "to film the concert."
But he now feels that the film is
something more than just
filmed concert: "After we got
the rushes back from the con
cert, we realized we had some
thing much more interesting."
"We decided to shoot some
documentary, and then from
there to shoot the three scenes
inside the soundstage: 'The
Weight,' 'Evangeline,' and 'The
Last Waltz Suite.' These were
shot like a feature film."
Cilliatt asleep
One of the few bad reviews
that the film has received was
written by Penelope Gilliatt in
The New Yorker. Scorsese said
that Gilliatt "was asleep during
the film, from the reports that
I've got. Also, there are other

things I don't really want to get
into; they might be detrimen
tal to people."
"But she really didn't see the
film. She liked the interviews
and wanted more of them. But
when she quoted the inter
views, she quoted the wrong
things; in other words, nobody
said what's quoted in The New
Yorker. I don't see how any cri
tic could go see a movie, fall
asleep and do their job prop
erly."
In general, the film turned
out to be "more difficult" than
Scorsese had anticipated. "In
shooting the concert, I didn't
expect any difficulty, and it
went smoothly. But then we
did more and more and more;
it got bigger and bigger. It
turned into the biggest
sound mix in history (seven
months). That was difficult."
"There was nothing you
could do about it. The basis of
the film is the music, and the
music has to be right. The
problem was timing; to get the
sound right. With 48 tracks, if
one of them was out of sync, it
takes hours to find it. You have
to listen to each track."
Also the film's Dolby sound

system presented some prob
lems: "A reel is ten minutes
long. With the Dolby system, if
you go nine minutes and every
thing is perfect and in that last
minute of film something really
bad happens, you have to redo
all nine minutes. So if you get it
and work at it night after night,
all you have do is mess up one
thing and you have to go back

and redo the whole reel."
Scorsese's next film will be
entitled "Raging Bull." It will
star Robert De Niro, in his
fourth film for Scorsese, as
boxer Jake LaMotta. Scorsese
will begin shooting in "Sep
tember or October" of this
year, with the release date for
the film tentatively set for late
1979.

At first glance, "The Last
Waltz" seems like a striking
departure for its director, Mar
tin Scorsese. Why would the
maker of "Taxi Driver" and
"Alice Doesn't Live Here Any
more" want to film The Band's
last concert?
