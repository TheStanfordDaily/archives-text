While a friend was visiting from another
school he was impressed with the beauty of
Stanford, except for the blighted area we call the
Inner Quad. Why doesn't the University tear up
the asphalt and plant grassi lust about anything
would look better!
-8.8.
Unless a drastic change in the Planning Of
fice's reasoning takes place, it doesn't look like
you're going to see grass in the Inner Quad.
Oscar Nelson, master planner in the Facilities
Planning Office said the inconsistency of lawns
within this area is the main reason grass has not
been planted in the Inner Quad. He said lawns
are alien to this area and its desert climate.
Other grass areas on campus serve as athletic
fields.
But for public areas "the standard treatment is
basically a hard surface," he added.
The costs of planting a lawn, preparing soil,
installing a sprinkler system, and maintaining
the area are the other major obstacles. Unless
the lawn was carefully maintained, it wouldn't
survive the heavy traffic.
Nelson said the area "needs to be resurfaced
in some appropriate manner." He suggested
combining materials to work in a pattern "sym
pathetic to the architecture materials and design
that's there."
The Facilities Planning Office is currently re
viewing some plans for the Inner Quad. Nelson
said he feels they are still in the exploratory
stages, however.
Nelson said planting grass is not among these
plans.

Do C.H.P.'s use radar? I heard they aren't al
lowed to. If not - hoW do they catch speeders?
-D.A.
The California Highway Patrol is the only state
patrol that does not use radar, according to Sgt.
Cuinane of the Redwood City office.

Every year the C.H.P. puts a bill in, and every
year its defeated, he added.
Cuinane said the C.H.P. catches speeders by
clocking them against the speeds of their own
cars. If a C.H.P. car going at maximum speed is
keeping pace with a vehicle and the vehicle pulls
away, for example, Cuinane said a C.H.P. officer
would consider its driver to be speeding.
Is there any organization that provides infor
mation on the social responsibility of different
banks: (Please don't answer "yes" or "no.")
-D.C.
Regretfully, there does not seem to be any
central place that provides such information.
Senior Vice President of the Peninsula Divi
sion of Wells Fargo Bank, Mr. Daniel S.
Livingston, said the particular bank you deal
withwould be the best source for obtaining this
information.
He said he believes most banks publish some
sort of statement on the social responsibility of
their own organization. Lending to minority
groups and servicing communities are among
the topics frequently covered by such publica
tions, he added.
Livingston said you should contact the public
relations department of any bank.
Wells Fargo has just recently published a
pamphlet dealingwith the social responsibility it
bears. To obtain one you can write Wells Fargo
Public Relations Dept. at 475 Sansome St., San
Francisco, CA 94104, ask for a copy at the Wells
Fargo Stanford Branch, or come by the Daily
office to look at a copy that Livingston very con
siderately mailed over.

The sign in front of the white plastic structure in Lomita Mall near the
Physics Tank reads: "ALBER'S RUNNING WALL — At the University

mysterious "wall" there. Barry Parr of the Hammer & Coffin society
confessed last night that it was the work of four people being initiated
into the society today. Elsen said he felt the use of nis quotation was
"fair use in the area of parody."

school he was impressed with the beauty of
Stanford, except for the blighted area we call the

-8.8.
Unless a drastic change in the Planning Of
fice's reasoning takes place, it doesn't look like
you're going to see grass in the Inner Quad.
Oscar Nelson, master planner in the Facilities
Planning Office said the inconsistency of lawns
within this area is the main reason grass has not
been planted in the Inner Quad. He said lawns
are alien to this area and its desert climate.
Other grass areas on campus serve as athletic
fields.
But for public areas "the standard treatment is
basically a hard surface," he added.
The costs of planting a lawn, preparing soil,
installing a sprinkler system, and maintaining
the area are the other major obstacles. Unless
the lawn was carefully maintained, it wouldn't
survive the heavy traffic.
Nelson said the area "needs to be resurfaced
in some appropriate manner." He suggested
combining materials to work in a pattern "sym
pathetic to the architecture materials and design
that's there."
The Facilities Planning Office is currently re
viewing some plans for the Inner Quad. Nelson
said he feels they are still in the exploratory
stages, however.
Nelson said planting grass is not among these
plans.

Do C.H.P.'s use radar? I heard they aren't al
lowed to. If not - hoW do they catch speeders?
-D.A.
The California Highway Patrol is the only state
patrol that does not use radar, according to Sgt.
Cuinane of the Redwood City office.

Every year the C.H.P. puts a bill in, and every
year its defeated, he added.
Cuinane said the C.H.P. catches speeders by
clocking them against the speeds of their own
cars. If a C.H.P. car going at maximum speed is
keeping pace with a vehicle and the vehicle pulls
away, for example, Cuinane said a C.H.P. officer
would consider its driver to be speeding.
Is there any organization that provides infor
mation on the social responsibility of different
banks: (Please don't answer "yes" or "no.")
-D.C.
Regretfully, there does not seem to be any
central place that provides such information.
Senior Vice President of the Peninsula Divi
sion of Wells Fargo Bank, Mr. Daniel S.
Livingston, said the particular bank you deal
withwould be the best source for obtaining this
information.
He said he believes most banks publish some
sort of statement on the social responsibility of
their own organization. Lending to minority
groups and servicing communities are among
the topics frequently covered by such publica
tions, he added.
Livingston said you should contact the public
relations department of any bank.
Wells Fargo has just recently published a
pamphlet dealingwith the social responsibility it
bears. To obtain one you can write Wells Fargo
Public Relations Dept. at 475 Sansome St., San
Francisco, CA 94104, ask for a copy at the Wells
Fargo Stanford Branch, or come by the Daily
office to look at a copy that Livingston very con
siderately mailed over.
