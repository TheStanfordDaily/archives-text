# Fund move withdrawn by senate
## 
### Rob Lempert 
A motion to pull ASSU funds out of
the University merge pool was with
drawn last night by the ASSU Senate
when two senators warned they
would walk out and break the body's
quorum.
Part of the merge pool of Univer
sity funds including those of the
ASSU, is invested in corporations
doing business in South Africa. The
motion, proposed by Sen. Rick Levy,
would have essentially divested the
ASSU from these holdings.
Senators Doug Bandow and Peter
Joost threatened to leave when a mo
tion to table the proposal failed.
"This is a major step that needs a
lot of discussion. It's not something
to be relegated to the last few mi
nutes of a senate meeting," Joost
said.
In other action the senate certified
the results of the April run-off elec
tion, installing Andrew Golden
kranz, Regina Petty, Fred Estes and
Mary Morimoto as members of the
new Council of Presidents. The new
COP takes office today. Will Nixon, a
sophomore, was elected next year's
Elections Commissioner.
Financial manager
Levy's motion would have given
the ASSU financial manager the re
sponsibility of re-investing ASSU
funds withdrawn from the merge
pool.
Sen. Steve Buckley, however, said
he was worried about the wisdom of
giving control of ASSU investments
to the financial manager.
The financial manager doesn't
have the knowledge or experience to
handle stocks, he said. The ASSU
depends heavily on the interest from
its investment and Buckley said the
motion might bankrupt the body.
Bandow said he wanted to stop a
vote from being taken on the motion
because the issue had come up with
out adequate warning and because
there were not enough senators pre
sent to discuss such an important is
sue.
Allocating funds
From the senate discretionary
fund, the senate gave $225 to the
Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion for their annual powwow, $150
to the Association of Puerto Rican
Students for a symposium later this
month, and $130 to Manzanita Park
for their "Splendor in the Crass"
carnival next week.
To helpfinance nextTuesday'sGay
Freedom Day, the senate voted to
give $175 to the Gay People's Union
(GPU). The money will be used to
fund a talk by Sally Cerhart, a noted
lesbian feminist.
In other action, Grethel an
nounced that the Elections Review
Board (ERB) report is being typed,
and should be done soon.
Elections Commissioner Sean
Murphy announced that the Com
mittee to Retire Aspiring Politicos
(CRAP) petitions, calling for the
elimination of the senate, have re
ceived enough signatures and will
appear on next fall's ballot.
