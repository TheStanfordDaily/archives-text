# U. Mass paper reaches accord with feminists

### 
Amherst, Mass. (AP) â€” An agreement was
reached yesterday to end an 11-day occupation
of the University of Massachusetts student
newspaper offices by militant feminists de
manding improved women's news coverage.
In an eight-point compromise, the Mas
sachusetts Daily Collegian and the occupying
women agreed to formation of a fact-finding
commission whose recommendations will not
be binding.
"We're not totally satisfied with the agree
ment, but I think that we will gain some im
provements," said Jvilie Melrose, leader of the
protest and the Daily Collegian's women's news
editor.
Her group had vowed previously to remain in
the offices, hindering production of the news
paper, until its demands were met. The women
were expected to leave the offices sometime on
Friday.
The2o,ooo-circulation Daily Collegian, unable
to use much of its equipment and files, has been
publishing from temporary quarters.
"It's obvious that the Collegian is willing to
ignore the sentiments of all the feminists on

campus and across the country who gave us
support, so it's unreasonable to think that
they're going to give on any of our proposals on
their own initiative," Melrose said. "So we had
to look for a compromise resolution of this. I'm
quite confident about the composition of the
commission."
The commission will include two students
from each side of the dispute, three faculty
members and three representatives of the
school administration. The administrators will
not have votes in commission deliberations.
After the occupation began April 30, the Daily
Collegian staff had reiterated its opposition to
separate pages of women's news, affirming a
vote taken during another occupation of the
offices earlier this spring. In an effort to reach
agreement, the newspaper had offered to allo
cate 40 column inches of space scattered
through the paper each day for women's news.
In addition to a daily separate page, the oc
cupying women asked for independent editing
control of its contents and that future women's
news editors be selected by the university's
women's community, not the newspaper staff.
