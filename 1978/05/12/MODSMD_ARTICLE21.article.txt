# Sosa: Control over life important
## 
### Kathleen Sanders 
Eddie Sosa believes that injustice
cannot be overthrown instantly but the
whole process of struggling against it is
a liberating force in itself.
"When a Chicano youth is shot by a
cop and you try to prosecute the cop, or
you fight against the Bakke case, or to
free Dessie Woods, or to uphold the
treaties of the native Americans you
realize that it is positive to struggle and
not to struggle is to become like the
oppressor. There is no middle
ground."
Sosa, a senior majoring in Political
Science here, is a member of the
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de
Aztlan (MEChA). According to Sosa,
during the civil rights movement of the
'60s many Chicanos in the United States
felt they should have a distinct nation in
this country. MEChA was formed as an
organization to work toward that goal.
Sosa is proud of his heritage. His dis
tinctive features reveal his native
American and Spanish ancestry.
" 'Chicano' signifies a people and a
culture distinct from Mexico and dis
tinct from the United States although
the people are tied to these two cul
tures."
Sosa was born in Los Angeles and
grew up in a Chicano neighborhood.
"People call it 'Frogtown' because
there are frogs in the river and during
the spring they come out and people
say they see them going along the
street," he says laughing. His eyes light
up when he smiles.
Remembering his childhood, Sosa
says,"I did what everybody else did. I
went to school, goofed around with the
other kids, worked and got into trou
ble."
Gene and Pilar Sosa, his parents,
have five children. Sosa is the second
oldest. "We're a pretty tight family. My
tather worked as a gardener and my
brothers and I would help. Now he has
a real estate agency and sells property."
Before coming to Stanford he at
tended Doris Place Grammar School
and later Divine Savior Catholic School.
"We called ourselves Mexicans in

grammar school and we were OK. It
wasn't until we went out to different
neighborhoods that we realized other
people saw us as different. We felt no
thing about being Mexican but outside
people did."
He says he remembers in high school
some students were treated as idiots
because they didn't speak English. The
Chicano movement in this country dur
ing the late '60s and early '70s resulted
in more recognition of Chicano cul
ture, Sosa adds. Working at different
times with high school students he has
found that Spanish is now generally
more accepted in the schools. But he
says there is a definite need for more
bilingual communication.
"The history of Chicano people in
this country is one of oppression and
therefore we must struggle to regain

our rights to self-determination," says
Sosa. It is necessary, he feels, for the
Chicano in this country to gain regional
autonomy and adequate representa
tion within regional institutions of soci
ety.
He believes that it is important for
people to work together and that even
when there is a low response concern
ing an issue it doesn't make him want to
stop organizing. There is a strength
within people to do what ever they be
lieve, according to Sosa, and he is op
timistic.

"Before you can understand any
body's oppression you have to realize
and understand your own oppression
and that is the key." He feels people
should not struggle out of liberalism
but realize that people's struggles are
intertwined and all are affected.
"Before people talk about liberating
others they have to recognize their own
oppression'. They have to see where
theirown oppression fits in. Only when
that is done can we move forward."
He sees oppression fiere at Stanford
as "alienation." "I have met very few
people who feel their studies are relev
ant to their own personal goals or any
one else's needs. Most people don't
know why they are here."
He says there pre many creative
people here at Stanford and their ideas
are being channeled into things they
don't really want to do. Students are
not controlling their lives, he says, and
there are always those who are making
decisions for them.
He lives what he believes. His friends
say that he is sincere about the things
he does. One student emphasized So
sa's patience and understanding in de
aling with people and social issues.
Sosa says there are literally hundreds
of people who are working in the strug
gle against injustice and he is only one
of many. His involvement is a very per
sonal thing and stems from his life ex
periences and seeing oppression of
Chicanos and other third world people.
"Chicano people in this country are
still being oppressed and being a
Chicano I am also oppressed."
Now he is working with the Anti-
Bakke Decision Coalition (ABDC), a
multinational coalition of students,
workers and community activists.
It is important, he feels, to work
within the constraints of reality when
dealing with issues and not get caught
up into abstract intellectual know
ledge. "You have to work with people
and talk to people to see where they are
at.
"That's why it is positive to struggle,"
says Sosa. "Living is something you
gotta do. You have no choice."
