## History and old rustic charm enhance L'Omelette's cuisine

L'Omelette French Restaurant and Bistro
4170 El Camino Real
Palo Alio
493-1660
Walking into L'Omelette is like walking
into a romantic, somewhat rustic old
country inn in provincial France. The at
mosphere is casual yet elegant. Large cop
per pots hang from exposed dark wood
beams. China, silver and polished brass
hurricane lanterns decorate the intimate
tables. Old brick fireplaces also add to this
provincial setting. New owner and chef,
Louis Borel, treated my escort and me to a
tasteof history as well as exquisite cuisine.
L'Omelette has been around since 1932.
Throughout the '40s, '50s, and '60s it was a
traditional hangout for Stanford students
and their friends and families. However,
the restaurant changed owners in the '60s
and subsequently its atmosphere, as well
as food, was altered and L'Omelette drew
a different crowd. Today, Borel is striving
to once more create the original congenial
atmosphere and reestablish L'Omelette's
reputation for excellent French cuisine.
My escort and I lingered over a delecta

ble dinner that we won't soon forget. For
an appetizer, we tried L'Omelette's spe
cial, Pate Maison, a tasty country style pate
made of pork, veal, and pork liver.
For our main dishes, we opted for the
special of the day, Fresh Filet of Sole ala
Varnee ($9.50), and the Cote de Veau, aux
Parfums des Sous Bois (white veal with
wild mushroom sauce, $10.25). Soup,
salad, a fresh vegetable and potato or rice
come with all entrees.
The soup du jour was a smooth cream of
watercress. This mouth-watering blend of
tender watercress, potatoes and delicate
spices, was a hit with both my escort and
me. Following this was an ice cold salad,
consisting of a tender heart of butter let
tuce lightly veiled in dressing. We recom
mend the excellent Dijon mustard dres
sing for a change of pace.
We had finished our salads and were
gazing out of the window onto a plant
covered patio when we caught a whiff of
our entrees, coming to us, steaming hot.
Both choices proved to be sensational.
The filet of sole, moist and tender, was
stuffed with spinach. A light seafood sauce

with shrimp and mushrooms was spooned
over it. This greatly enhanced the enjoy
able blend of flavors. Rice and finely
chopped, subtly creamed broccoli com
plimented the fish.
The veal was superb: perfectly cooked
and tender. It was the delicate wild mush
room sauce, with a hint of sherry, which
made the veal such a memorable dish.
Broccoli and a baked potato completed
the course.
Both of us ate slowly to prolong our ple
asure, but finally finished and ordered de
ssert. We had cheesecake ($1.25) which
was good hut rather ordinary. The fresh
fruit ala liqueur ($1.75) was sublime. It
consisted of fresh apples, oranges,
bananas and strawberries in liqueur,
spooned over rich vanilla ice cream; a per
fect way to end a perfect meal.
L'Omelette is a restaurant forall types of
people. There is live piano music Monday
through Thursday in the bar. For those
who like to dance, the Terry Bell Trio pro
vides all kinds of dance music on Friday
and Saturday nights.
