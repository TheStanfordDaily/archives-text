How many restaurants do
you know that transform from
an ordinary coffee shop during
the day into an outstanding
Chinese restaurant at night? I
know of only one: the newly
opened "Little Restaurant" lo
cated in Menlo Park.
At times, one is in the mood
for a classy restaurant com
plete with tuxedoed waiters,
candlelight and flaming de
sserts. Other times, however,
one likes to feel at home, to
have a fellow Stanford student
as one's waitress, or to be free
to spontaneously converse
with the chef. When one is in
the second mood that I have
described, check out Little Re
staurant.
Arriving 45 minutes after the
restaurant opened, my com

panion and I were quickly sea
ted in the non-smoking sec
tion. Those, like me, who dis
like others' cigarette smoke
would appreciate this restaur
ant as it has separated rooms
for smokers and non-smokers.
When the waitress noticed
we were ready to order, she
promptly took our order. We
decided to have the Szechuan
Dinner (7.50 each) since we fi
gured the sign on the door "Lit
tle Restaurant — Szechuan
Cuisine" was an indication of
the restaurant's specialty.
Howe.ver, I later learned that
this is only one of the restaur
ant's many specialties.
It did not take us long to dis
cover that "hot and spicy" is
the theme of Szechuan
cuisine. Each dish we were
served, excluding the rice and
the dessert, seemed to get
spicier and spicier. Whole dry
pepper, chile sauce, and
ground pepper create the spic

iness in the food. However,
there are many dishes on the
menu for people who prefer
the more mild Chinese food.
Our waitress, who hap
pened to be everybody's wait
ress, brought us a large bowl of
Hot and Sour Soup, more than
enough for two people. Al
though it was delicious, we
didn't finish it as we wanted to
save room for the rest of our
meal.
This soup is a pleasant depar
ture from the ordinary Won
Ton or Egg Drop Soup one
usually orders. Long thin bam
boo shoots, egg, a little
shrimp, bean curd and black
fungus did not leave much
room for the broth. When the
waitress informed us of these
unusual ingredients I must
admit I was a little skeptical.
Who wants to eat curd and
fungus, I thought to myself.
However I was surprised to
find this soup was excellent.
Next we were served two
cold appetizers: Bon Bon
Chicken and Cold Shrimp. The
chicken and cucumber dish
which the waitress had accu
rately warned us was very
spicy, unfortunately was not
on the some high level of per
fection as the other dishes. My
companion and I both noticed
bits of cartilage in our servings.
The second appetizer con
sisted of marinated shrimp and
crisp celery and was not as
spicy as the other dishes. Even
though I'm not usually a
shrimp lover, I enjoyed this
dish immensely.
After these spicy dishes, our
burning mouths told us that a
mere glass of water simply was
not enough. Our understand

ing waitress gladly brought us a
whole pitcher to keep on our
table.
After we polished off these
dishes, the two main courses
along with a bowl of steamed
rice were served. Shredded
beef, carrots, celery and lots of
hot peppers characterized the
Szechuan Beef. The other dish,
Kung Pao Chicken, consisted
of diced chicken, water
chestnuts, red peppers,
peanuts, and, or course, hot
sauce, Szechuan style. In spite
of the spiciness, the superb
flavor of these dishes still man
aged to stand out.
The waitress then gave us a
few minutes to let our mouths
cool down before bringing us
our dessert — six Fried
Bananas. They are not exactly
Chinese since the Chinese do
not eat desserts with their me
als, but are still worth mention
ing. These ripe bananas had
been dipped in a light batter,
deep fried and sprinkled with
sugar. Delicious.
The comfortable atmos
phere added a nice touch to
our dinner. The customers felt
at home here and conversed
freely with Louis Kao, the well
liked manager/chef. The wait
ress told us that many people
comein regularly, threeorfour
times a week. One customer
said she was a "Louis fan" and
really enjoys his cooking.
For an excellent Szechuan
dinner, ample servings, good
service and an easygoing at
mosphere, try out Little Re
staurant. I doubt you will be
disappointed. It is open daily
from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.
