If a dinner of egg rolls, won ton soup, and
sweet-and-sour pork sounds all too familiar and
you would like to branch out, the China Lion is
the place to experiment.
This week, the China Lion is debuting their
all-new menu, and all I can say, is, if you liked
the old one, you'll love the new one!
The new menu offers twice as many selections
as the old, and all selections are organized in
groups of appetizers, seafood, vegetables and
meats. To help with choosing what you'd like,
the hot or spicy foods are marked with an as
terisk.
For those who were unsure of what to order,
the old menu had a "gourmet dinner," with all
the choices made for you. The new menu has
expanded this alternative. Vou can choose from
thirteen main dishes, such as Hot Spicy Whole
Fish ($7.75), or Lake Tung Ting Vegetables
($4.50).
Soup of the day, fried prawns, eggrolls,
steamed or fried rice, fresh fruit, a fortune
cookie and jasmine tea are all included with the
gourmet dinner.
If you would rather try one of the dishes not
on the gourmet dinner list, but you would still
like all the condiments, just add one dollar to
the price of any dish of your choice and every
thing will be included. Forexample, by ordering
Egg Foo Yung, the whole meal would be only
$3.75. Vegetarians especially might want to
choose the only gourmet vegetarian dish, Lake
Tung Ting Vegetables. It consists of small corn,
dry bean cane, Chinese cabbage, and has an
unusual consistency. But, there are plenty of

other dishes from which to choose.
All vegetable dishes contain absolutely no
meat, so that vegetarians can enjoy many diffe
rent dishes.
How can a restaurant so small offer such an
extensive menu? It's simple, according to Sam
son Chu, the owner and chef. Unlike the larger
restaurants, no food is prepared in advance.
Also, as there are only two chefs, you can be
sure that the meals will be consistent.
Ready to go? Be sure to take a large group
along so you can sample many dishes. The best
rule for ordering is to select one soup for the
whole group, then have each person choosp
one dish. If you are uncertain about what to
order, I would recommend the following
dishes.
Fried Won Tons are great for an appetizer.
These crispy wont ns are served with a sweet
and-sour dip.
Three Delight Sizzling Rice is an interesting
soup. The rice and the soup are brought seper
ately to the table, then poured together. Hence
the name.
Two main dishes I would suggest are Mu Shu
Pork and Three Gems. The first is a blend of
shredded pork and vegetables rolled in a rice
pancake and served in an oriental plum sauce,
($3.75). The three gems in the second dish are
chicken, shrimp and beef, ($4.75).
Lychees are a nice way to finish off the meal.
They are a tasty cross between a pineapple and
an orange.
Even if you decide not to experiment with
more unusual Chinese dishes, you can still be
assured that your chow mein and cashew chic
ken will have the freshest meats and vegetables,
prepared in the most delicious way.
