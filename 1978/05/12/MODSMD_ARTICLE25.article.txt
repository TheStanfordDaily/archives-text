Trader Vic's has been a part
of the San Francisco scene for
so long that we tend to take it
for granted. But pleasure and
enjoyment continue to be a
part of this elegant dining ex
perience.
During the 1930's Victor
Bergeron established the first
Trader Vic's in Oakland. To
day, less than 50 years later,
there are 19 different Trader
Vic's located throughout the
United States, Europe, and
Canada. The San Francisco re
staurant, now run by Mr.
Bergeron's son, Lynn, is the
crown jewel of the entire oper

ation. With a personality all its
own, this Trader Vic's is as col
orful as the people and the city
it serves.
No other restaurant com
mands the same unique
Polynesian flair. The walls and
roof are "thatched", fishing
nets and glass floats are sus
pended from the ceiling, and
carved masks decorate each of
the three main dining rooms.
The world of a South Sea isle
beckons the moment you walk
in the door.
We were escorted to our
table by David Gibson, our
captain for the evening. The
room is arranged to accommo
date a maximum number of
people in a minimum amount
of space. Fortunately for the

customers, dark colors, soft
amber lighting, and an efficient
entourage of waiters and bus
boys help to compensateforan
atmosphere that might other
wise be crowded and noisy.
The menu is awesome. De
scriptions of Chinese country
cooking, Calcutta curries, and
Oysters Florentine tease im
agination and palate both. Al
most discouraged by the range
of our selection, we decided to
place our order in the hands of
our captain. If this is your
first visit to Trader Vic's, we
suggest that you might want to
do the same.
At David's recommendation,
we began with the Cosmos
Tidbits ($5.50), a delightful
array of seafood, pork and

cheese appetizers. The three
old favorites, fried shrimp,
barbequed spareribs and eg
groll, were superb; especially
the eggroll, whose flaky pastry
wrapper was really excep
tional. And yet the two new
features, Crab Rangoons and
Cheese Bings, were even bet
ter. The rangoons consisted of
a cream and crab mixture dip
ped and fried in a sweet won
ton batter and made a nice var
iation of the traditional
Chinese snack. The Cheese
Bings, warm and tangy bundles
of three different kinds of
cheeses, were one more treat.
Again relying on the advice
of our captain, we ordered, the
Cosmos Salad Marie ($3.10)
and Bongo Bongo Soup

($2.75). As the names suggest,
both dishes are house special
ties.
The salad is a fantastic com
bination of mushroom, celery,
and artichoke slices in Trader
Vic's own mustard dressing, a
dressing which enhances
without ever drowning the
central ingredients. Taste, tex
ture and the thought of eating
all "those healthy things" made
this vegetable medley agree
able to both body and soul.
Bongo Bongo Soup—
somehow the name alone
seems to say it all. Actually, the
smooth puree of oyster and
spinach merits one more
adjective—good!
Unleavened sesame crac
kers, were also served with the
soup and salad. Light and un
obtrusive, they were a pleas
ant, (though easily addicting),
complement.
Next in line were warm sce
neted towels, chilled wine
glasses, a bottle of Wente
Brothers Chenin Blanc and
David, ready to take our order.
Unlike many restaurants where
a heavy first course diminishes
the enjoyment of the main en
tree, the success of our earlier
selections led us to anticipate
what was still to come.
We ordered the Indonesian
Lamb Roast ($13.25), the Sea
food Cluster (not listed on the
menu), Chinese Asparagus
($2.95), artichokes stuffed with

spinach and hollandaise sauce
(also not on the menu), and
Chinese peapods with water
chestnuts ($3.50). Within 10 to
15 minutes our meal was be
fore us, being heated and pre
pared on a cart brought di
rectly to our table. Each dish
was divided and arranged in
almost photographic perfec
tion. The portions were small
but appropriate for the
number and variety of our or
der.
Blended together in a simple
white wine and herb sauce,
sections of cracked crab,
scampi, and prawns competed
for attention in the Seafood
Cluster. Needless to say, they
all came out winners. Another
honorable mention was the
lamb roast, which was accom
panied by a thick, rich peanut
sauce. The meat itself was a
young, juicy cut but should
have been cooked a little bit
longer; our preference for
medium rare was unfortu
nately heeded as more raw
than medium.
Fresh from the garden and
ambrosia to the palate, each of
the vegetables was a blue prize
winner. In all cases, taste
matched appearance. The as
paragus was cut in thin slices
and crisply finished in butter so
as to capitalize on its delicate
flavor and bright color. The
peapods were prepared in a
similar manner and not met
with equally successful results.

Nevertheless, the spinach
stuffed artichokes were the
clearest example of the im
aginative cookery of the Trader
Vic chefs. Intricately sauced
and spiced, the artichokes
were an enjoyable difference.
The end of our meal was as
perfect as the beginning and as
satisfying as the middle. After
one more round of steamed
hand towels and one last sip of
wine, we began our last round.
Long-stemmed strawberries
($2.75) served on a bed of ice
with sour cream and brown
sugar, rich rum ice cream driz
zled with praline syrup, and
mugs of Kafe-La'Te ($.95) defy
description. Let us just say that
they were an appropriate finale
to one of the finest meals I have
ever enjoyed.
Before leaving, David es
corted us on a tour of the
kitchen and banquet facilities;
also included was the well
known Captain's Cabin where
the rich, the famous, and the
not-so-famous come to see
and be seen. As an interesting
side note, Henry Kissinger was
scheduled to dine there that
same evening.
The cuisine atmosphere,
and clientele, Trader /ic's
claims its own. Though tabs are
quick to soar, I suggest that for
the evening you let it claim
you.
