Mission Rock Resort
817 China Basin Street
San Francisco
621-5538
Dining on Mission Rock Re
sort's outdoor deck on a sunny
afternoon is a matchless San
Francisco treat. Unique to the
city, one must go to either
Pete's FHarbor in the Redwood
City Marina or further north to
Sausalito fora comparable din
ing experience.
Owned and run by Norma
and Robert Wahl, the restaur
ant is directly across the slough
from the Bethlehem steel
yards. In shipside tradition the
dining pace is easy and the ser
vice slow. Downstairs is a bar
and billiard room while up
stairs another bar partitions the
dining room from the deck.
Open seven days a week for
breakfast and lunch, Mission
Rock Resort serves a Sunday
champagne brunch from 9
a.m. to 3 p.m. If it's a warm,
sunny day and you have two
hours to devote to lunch, Mis
sion Rock may be the answer.

Claiming a deck table with two
friends on a hot spring day
provided me with an opportun
ity to investigate a restaurant
that I'd heard about for the last
couple of years.
We had a $3 carafe of Paul
Masson white house wine
while we scanned the menu.
Lunch choices include a half
pound cheeseburger and fries
($2.50), chowder ($1), spinach
salad ($2) and chef's salad ($3).
For those with heartier appe
tites, luncheon plates with a
choice of pilaf, baked potato or
trench fries, range from $3.75
for deep-fried scallops to $7.95
for New York steak Five kinds
of deli sandwiches with your
choice of bread and cheese are
available for $2.50, and an
omelette is $2.75.
One of my companions had
the three-egg, ham, cheese
and mushroom omelette
which he rated fair, while
another chose the daily spe

cial, sturgeon, which was a dis
appointment. My crab and
shrimp Louis ($5) was enorm
ous and as it was enough tor
several people I shared it with
my friends who were dissatis
fied with their choices.
A common fault I have found
with this dish in almost any re
staurant was evident here; the
crabmeat was too salty and the
bed consisted of an excess
amount of lettuce. The saline
quotient could be cancelled by
rinsing the crabmeat before
preparing the Louis. This neg
lected practice is paramount
for restaurants ordering frozen
or canned crab or shrimp from
their suppliers, but seldom
performed.
I'm certain to return to Mis
sion Rock Resort on a warm
day, convinced that the ambi
ence is marvelous and offsets
any shipside culinary lapses
