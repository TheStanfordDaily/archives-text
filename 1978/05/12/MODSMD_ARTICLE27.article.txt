Plump strawberries and
fresh blueberry muffins are a
part of The Gatehouse Sunday
brunch — a welcome change
for the food service student.
A New Orleans-style patio fil
led with flowers and greenery
provides an atmosphere of
spring while a peaceful water
fall muffles the restaurant's
noises. Although a patio table
requires a longer wait, most
people choose this rather than
a table in the colonial-styled
indoors.
Champagne or fruit juice

begins the buffet brunch. An
unusually good-tasting
smoked salmon crowns a large
table of different cheeses,
fruits, ham, seafood, and
salads. Among the various
salads is a strawberry gelatin
which is sweet and fluffy with
out being too rich.
The thinly-sliced ham goes
well with the Swiss, cheddar,
and smoked cheddar cheeses.
But for the dorm student, the
table's greatest attraction is the
fresh fruit. Abundantly-filled
bowls of large ripe strawber
ries and sweet orange and
grapefruit sections surround a
platter piled with slices of can
taloupe, pineapple and hon

eydew melon. It is tempting to
overeat here, but the table of
hot entrees is equally inviting.
The house specialties in
clude cheese blintzes in
blueberry sauce and eggs Be
nedict, English muffins topped
with melted cheese and egg.
Scrambled eggs, sausage
and bacon and hash browns
compose the typical breakfast.
Moist homemade muffins,
purple with the juice and fruit
of many blueberries, are a
highlight in the meal.
Rice pilaf provides a bed for
the special hot luncheon item
of sweet-and-sour ham. This
special luncheon dish varies
from week to week.

After such a spectacular
meal, the coffee and dessert
are somewhat of a letdown.
The coffee is slightly bitter
while the German chocolate
and carrot cakes are rather
bland.
The service, on the other
hand, is impressive. The wait
ers and waitresses are cheerful
and helpful. Anything a per
son orders i* brought
promptly. Even a simple glass
of water is not served in any
ordinary way. Garnished with a
lemon slice in a champagne
glass filled with ice, water has a
refreshing tangy taste to it.
The attire worn for the Sun
day brunch is varied. The
Gatehouse attracts a cos
mopolitan crowd dressed in
anything from a springy sun
dress to nice blue jeans.
A person should wear loose
fitting clothing, however, since
the meal leaves one with
that gorged Thanksgiving feel
ing. With so much delicious
food to eat, one must either
loosen one's belt or lie down to
digest in the park, conve
niently located across the
street from The Gatehouse.
The Gatehouse is open from
10 a.m. t02:30 p.m. for its Sun
day buffet brunch. The price is
$6.75 per person for unlimited
servings. For senior citizens
over 65 the price is $5 and for
children under 12 the price is
$3.50.
Lunch is served Monday
through Saturday from 11:30
a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and dinner is
seven days a week from 5:30
p.m. to 10 p.m.
