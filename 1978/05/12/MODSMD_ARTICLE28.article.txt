# Third place at stake
## Cards close season with Cal 
### Cathy Dickerson 
Stay down on the ball . . .
swing level . . . make a hard
turn and look. All the instruc
tions that the six senior mem
bers of the Stanford baseball
team have received over the
past four years will aid them in
the final series of their Stanford
career this weekend against
Cal.
What better way for the
graduating seniors to end four
demanding years of personal
sacrifices, tough practices, and
stiff competition than a series
with their rivals from across the
Bay — the Golden Bears.
The two teams will play Fri
day afternoon in Berkeley start
ing at 2 p.m. with the conclu
sion of the April 22 tie. Im
mediately following that game,
asingle nineinningcontestwill
take place.
Saturday, Cal will come to
Stanford's Sunken Diamond
for a doubleheader that will
begin at noon. Prior to the start
of one of the games that day,
the graduating seniors Tom
Guardino, Todd Ervin, Dave
Perez, Gary Scott, Pepe

Hinojosa and Randy Wong will
be honored.
This season-concluding
series is also a place
determining one for both
teams. The 1978 Pacific-8 title
belongs to the USC Trojans
(currently 13-2) but second
place is up for grabs. UCLA,
who faces USC this weekend,
is 8-7 right now, while Cal is
5-9-1 and Stanford is 4-10-1.
A sweep for either Cal or
Stanford this weekend could
put one of them in or tied for
second place. That is, if USC
continues its current victory
pattern. Even if one of the
teams takes three out of four
it's going to make a large dif
ference in the final standings.
Neitherteam isgoingto have
an easy time winning any of the
games this weekend, as both
are fairly evenly matched.
Coach Bob Milano of Cal ex
pects the usual. He said,
"When Cal and Stanford play it
is always a battle."
Milano went on to say,
"There is a tremendous rivalry
between these two teams, but
after the battle is over it's still

neat to watch the kids mingle
and talk. That's what I like best
about the games between Cal
and Stanford: when all is said
and done, everybody is still
friends."
Friday afternoon, Joe LoP
resti will take the mound for
the Cardinals picking up where
he left off in the April game that
was called on account of dark
ness. After granting Cal an 8-0
lead in the first three innings of
the final game of the April
series, Stanford came back
with six runs in the sixth inning
and two in the seventh.
After 10full inningsthe score
was still tied 8-8 and LoPresti,
who had come into the game
when it was only 1-1/3 innings
old, was still going strong. As
darkness fell on Evans Field,
LoPresti stepped off the
mound, still the pitcher.
As disappointing as it was for
him to have pitched nearly a
full game and coming away
with nothing to show for it,
LoPresti was determined to
right the injustice later in the
season if he was given the
chance. Coach Mark Marquess
has granted him that opportun
ity.

"Joe will start the first
game," said Marquess, "and
hopefully it won't take too
long. Then he can just stay out
there and start the next game."
Marquess plans to go with
Brian Harrison, Paul Crame
and Rob Irwin in some combi
nation on Saturday.
Berkeley will match right
hander Paul Fox (4-2, 2.84 ERA)
against LoPresti Friday with
similar plans of finishing the tie
quickly and letting Fox start the
next contest. Saturday Steve
Kaia (5-6, 3.08 ERA) and
freshman Mitch Hawley (4-1,
2.85 ERA) will be scheduled for
Cal mound duties.
Tom Guardino stands a good
chance of coming up with
homerun number 14, which
would be a Stanford season
high, in one of the games this
weekend. When the two teams
met earlier this year, Guardino
slugged three homers and was
responsible for nine RBI.
Leading the Cal offense will
be big Bob Bohnet, the first
baseman. Bohnet is batting
.347 leading the team with 45
RBI. Dennis Barfield, the sec

ond baseman, sports a .311 av
erage while third baseman
Terry Stigge and outfielder Bob
Silverman are not far behind at
.302 and .301 clips. All four of
these team-leading seniors will
also be playing their last col
legiate baseball games this
weekend.
Wednesday the Cards
brushed up on a few skills be
fore heading to Cal when they
played the Santa Clara Broncos
at home in Sunken Diamond.
Stanford beat Santa Clara in 12
innings, 7-6.
"We weren't hitting the ball
really well," said Marquess,
"but we got seven runs on nine
hits and that's good. We hung
in there and got the timely
hits."
Grame and Irwin contri
buted with relief pitching and
were backed by designated hit
ters Wong and Larry Reynolds.
Reynolds came up with his first
homerun of the year — a two
run shot in the sixth inning.
