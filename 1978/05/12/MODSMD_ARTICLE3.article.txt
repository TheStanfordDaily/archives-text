# Recycling center turns trash into cash
## 
### Donna DePue 
The midterm you sweated over last
week and the cans from the six-pack
of beer you consumed afterward
probably are part of the 77 tons of
paper and the 3500 pounds of
aluminum the ASSU Recycling
Center has recycled since (anuary.
The center has "generally been an
overwhelming success," according
to |fm Knox, one of the center's pro
ject managers.
"In three months, the center has
gone from scratch to an organization
recycling 30 to 40 tons each month,"
Knox added.
Knox compared the ASSU Recycl
ing Center to other similar organiza
tions. Knox said the center here is the
only one he knows of that "actually
goes inside buildings" to collect re
cyclables. It is a "phenomenal level
of service," he added.
"However, there is no question
that there is a huge potential for im
provement. We're collecting a lot,
but it's only a fraction of what's out
there," he said.
The ASSU Recycling Center, lo
cated behind the Plant Services
building, opened earlier this year
with a budget of about $18,000.
Students approved a two quarter
fee assessment for the center last fall.
The center had no assets, so it oper
ated in the "red" until the fee as
sessment money was received, Knox
said.
Initial costs for paving and fencing
the center totaled about $7000. Addi
tional costs for a truck, recycling
drums and a storage shed ran to

$5100.
According to Knox, "Recycling is
not a money-making operation. Our
goal is to break even or to operate at
as small a deficit as possible. Thus far
we have averaged about $900 re
venue against $1000 labor expense
per month."
The center sells its paper waste to
Pioneer Paper in Santa Clara. The
company accepts notebook paper,
paper bags, leaflets and colored
paper and converts these materials
into cardboard.
The price of paper has dropped

from $28 per ton to $22 per ton since
the center began. Nevertheless, the
center has made $1765 from its sale of
paper, Knox said.
About 30 tons of glass have been
lecycled since January. The center
sells long-necked or shouldered
wine bottles to a firm in Berkeley
which washes and sells the bottles to
wineries.
Coors and Olympia beer bottles go
directly to the breweries, and return
able bottles go back to the stores. All
other glass is broken and is sold to
Circa Class in Fresno. The center has
made about $500 from glass sales.

Aluminum cans go to Kaiser
Aluminum in Oakland for 17 cents
per pound, netting $570 for the
center so far.
Bi-metal cans, made of steel and
aluminum sides, are not accepted by
the companies.
"There is no cost difference in the
production of bi-metal versus
aluminum cans and it is questionable
as to why bi-metal cans are manufac
tured," Knox said.
Tin cans go to the Palo Alto recycl
ing center, with no financial gain for
the center.
