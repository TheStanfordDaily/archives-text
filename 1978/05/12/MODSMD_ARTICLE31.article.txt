Stanford's Bill Maze won his match in straight sets Wednesday as the Cardinals throttled Pepperdine6-3.
Stanford also received some bad news as No. 1 singles player John McEnroe was upset 6-3, 6-2 by Eddie
Edwards of Pepperdine, and it was learned that doubles player Perry Wright may have to undergo
surgery. Wright's knee was hurt last Saturday against California and reinjured against the Golden Gaters
on Sunday.
