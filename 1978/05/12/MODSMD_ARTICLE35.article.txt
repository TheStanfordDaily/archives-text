## Concessions from a Stanford fan 
### Sukie Jackson 
It you've ever been to a Stanford
sporting event and bought a malt,
there's a good chance you bought it
trom Paul Eyrond. He was 12 years
old when he first sold ice cream malts
at Stanford tootball games.
But Eyrond was not a typical young
salesman.
Instead of selling malts with the
familiar "Get your ice cold malts
here" cry, Paul, who was born deaf,
had to devise his own means of
communication. He wore a hat
marked "65<f" — the price of the
malt. Remembering the first years,
Eyrond wrote, "I sold few malts. I
carried 24 at a time. Some malts
melted and I lost some money."
He wasn't discouraged, though.
Eyrond stuck with the job and now, at
22, he runs the concession stands at
baseball, tennis, swimming, vol
leyball and basketball games. At one
Stanford tootball game this year, he
sold "440 malts" and carried "96
malts at a time."
His determination and enterprise
have helped Eyrond overcome his
difficulties.
Born in San Francisco, Paul was
adopted as a baby by Mr. and Mrs.
Eyrond, who discovered he was deaf
when Paul was four months old.
"The first eight years of his life we
ren't easy," said Mrs. Eyrond. "When
he started to finger spell and use
signs, it made all the difference in the
world. He could communicate with

people," she said.
Now Eyrond communicates with
people by the writing, finger spelling
and sign language he learned at the
California School of the Deaf at Ber
keley. Paul wrote that after graduat
ing in 1975, "I wanted to work in the
operating room at Stanford Hospital
but the director of surgery didn't
want to hire me because employees
must hear."
Instead, Eyrond got a job at Kaiser
Hospital in south San lose. Now in
his third year in the medical records
department, Paul's responsibilities
include filing records, sorting mail,
copying doctor s schedules and de
livering mail to all doctors and ad
ministrators.
Besides being a concessions
salesman and a hospital employee,
Eyrond has one other occupation. He
is a sports fanatic, too, and fortu
nately, his Monday-through-Friday
hospital job leaves his weekends free
for his No. I interest —sports. Along
with attending all the Stanford sport
ing events, Eyrond has season tickets
to the San Francisco Giant and 49er
games and he watches football and
baseball on TV. He also manages to
find time to ski, too, "when Stanford
basketball is on the road."
Eyrond — a devoted Stanford fan
likes to watch football the most.
Fie has collected programs from
every football game since 1967, a
bucketful of chin straps from the
helmets of Stanford players and a

wide assortment ot Stanford decals
and banners. These thingsalong with
a picture of |im Plunkett decorate
Eyrond's room in his toster parents
home.
But with two jobs and an adven
turous spirit, tyrond spends little
time at home. "I love to go on trips,"
Paul wrote. While past excursions in
clude trips to the Rogue River and
Mexico with the YMCA, two times to
Pasadena to watch Stanford play in
the Rose Howl, and an annual trip to
Tahoe and Reno to play casino,
Eyrond still hopes to visit Hawaii, At
lanta, and Disneyworld in the future.
Since he began selling malts, he
has financed all his travels on Ins
own, including the YMC A camp
which he paid for by selling peanuts
door to door. "Even job he's gotten,
he sgotten on his own," Mrs. I yrond
commented. But Paul has never let
work interfere with his enjoyment of
sports as evidenced by his short stint
working as a busboy at a si//ler Re
staurant.
He preferred baseball to bussing
tables so when Eyrond's work
schedule conflicted with the baseball
schedule, he went to the games in
stead of to work. " I he third time I
got fired," Paul wrote.
By selling c one essions at Stanford
sporting events, though, I yrond lias
conveniently combined Ins love tor
sports with his work. His only prob
lem is titting everything he wants to
do into his already full schedule.


Paul Eyrond has been selling torn essions at Stanford games
for 10 years. The avid Cardinal rooter once quit a job

liecause he couldn't get the time off to watch baseball
games.
