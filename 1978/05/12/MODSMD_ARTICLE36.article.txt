China says Soviets invaded border
Tokyo — China claimed 30 Soviet soldiers penetrated
2Yt miles into northeastern China Tuesday and shot and
wounded "a number" of Chinese in one of the most
serious frontier incidents reported since the bloody
border battles of 1969.
There was no immediate comment from Moscow,
which resumed 8-year-old negotiations with China over
the Sino-Soviet boundary two weeks - ago after a 14-
month hiatus.
The Chinese government, in a sharply worded protest
to the Soviet ambassador in Peking, condemned the
incident as a "grave and calculated step to create tension
on the border," the official Chinese news agency
Hsinhua reported yesterday.
"It was only due to the restraint of the Chinese side
that the incident did not develop into an armed con
flict," the note said.
Terrorist attacks in Italy continue
Rome — Terrorists struck at an American multinational
target yesterday, wounding the Italian manager of the
Chemical Bankof New York in a street ambush in Milan.
Meanwhile, the government's parliamentary allies
demanded stronger police measures to deal with the
violence climaxed by the murder of Aldo Moro.
In the sixth "kneecapping" attack in six days, a man
and a woman fired three bullets into the legs and one
into the groin of Marzio Astarita, 37, manager of the
Milan and Rome offices of the bank.
Mideast arms sales not blocked
Washington — A Senate committee yesterday turned
down a resolution aimed at blocking President Jimmy
Carter's Mideast jet fighter sales, giving Carter a victory
in the first round of his battle to keep Congress from
scuttling the deal.
On an 8-8 vote, the Senate Foreign Relations commit
tee refused to block the $4.8 billion arms sales package,
in which the United States would sell jet fighters to Israel
and two of its Arab neighbors, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
Under parliamentary procedure, Congress may reject
an administration's planned arms sale within 30 days of
its formal submission to Capitol Hill. But the administra
tion does not need express approval from Congress. To
halt such a deal, both the House and Senate must ap
prove resolutions blocking it.
Black Panther leader arrested
Santa Cruz — Black Panther leader Huey Newton's
arrest in a barroom brawl yesterday clouds the future
leadership of his party and his own freedom while await
ing trial on a murder charge.
Newton, 36, and two other men were booked for
investigation of assault with intent to commit murder
following a melee at a bar in nearby Aptos, the Santa
Cruz County sheriff's office said.
Arrested with Newton were Robert Heard, 29, and
William Moore, 43. Moore later was released on $25,000
bond. Newton remained in custody with bail set at
$50,000, while Heard was held in lieu of $25,000 bail.

Deputies said at least two shots were tired in the
incident about 100 miles south of San Francisco.
Tremors felt in Santa Clara Valley
San Jose — Some 60 earthquakes were recorded in the
Santa Clara Valley in the 24 hours ending at 6 p.m.
yesterday, but only "half a dozen" of the tremors were
felt by residents, University of California seismologists
say.
The last earthquake strong enough to be felt in the
affected area — stretching from five miles west of Mt.
Hamilton to the Calaveras fault system in the foothill
area east of here — was recorded at 5:27 p.m.
Dr. Robert Uhrhammer, research seismologist with
the UC seismographic station at Berkeley, said the
quake measured 2.6 on the Richter scale. The strongest
of the quakes, at 4:57 a.m. yesterday, measured 3.9.
Fed supports higher interest rates
Washington — The Federal Reserve Board, reflecting
its concern over inflation, continued yesterday to sup
port higher interest rates despite fears by the administra
tion that they could slow the nation's economy.
The board raised its discount rate on loans to banks to
7 per cent, up from 6V2 per cent previously and the
highest since early 1975 when the county was in a deep
recession.
The action was one of a series taken by the board in
recent weeks to push up interest rates throughout the
economy in an effort to cool inflationary pressures.
The new chairman of the Fed, C. William Miller, said
yesterday that if inflation is not checked it could go
above 10 per cent within a few years and that such an
increase could bring on a serious recession.
Electric power sales investigated
Washington — Emergency electric power that was
moved into areas hardest hit by the winter coal strike
may have cost consumers $100 million too much in fuel
adjustment charges, a federal energy official said yes
terday.
William Lindsay, director of electric power regulation
for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said
utilities may be ordered to refund some of this money.
Dow Jones up 12.04
New York — The stock market, despite economic de
velopments that once would have been blamed for set
backs, yesterday posted a strong gain as it closed with a
rush.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose
12.04 to 834.20, despite a hike in the Federal Reserve's
discount rate to 7 per cent from bVi per cent and the
imminent release of money supply statistics.
Analysts said the market's showing yesterday ex
tended a trend that began about a month ago.

China says Soviets invaded border
Tokyo — China claimed 30 Soviet soldiers penetrated
2Yt miles into northeastern China Tuesday and shot and
wounded "a number" of Chinese in one of the most
serious frontier incidents reported since the bloody
border battles of 1969.
There was no immediate comment from Moscow,
which resumed 8-year-old negotiations with China over
the Sino-Soviet boundary two weeks - ago after a 14-
month hiatus.
The Chinese government, in a sharply worded protest
to the Soviet ambassador in Peking, condemned the
incident as a "grave and calculated step to create tension
on the border," the official Chinese news agency
Hsinhua reported yesterday.
"It was only due to the restraint of the Chinese side
that the incident did not develop into an armed con
flict," the note said.
Terrorist attacks in Italy continue
Rome — Terrorists struck at an American multinational
target yesterday, wounding the Italian manager of the
Chemical Bankof New York in a street ambush in Milan.

demanded stronger police measures to deal with the
violence climaxed by the murder of Aldo Moro.

into the groin of Marzio Astarita, 37, manager of the
Milan and Rome offices of the bank.
Mideast arms sales not blocked
Washington — A Senate committee yesterday turned
down a resolution aimed at blocking President Jimmy
Carter's Mideast jet fighter sales, giving Carter a victory
in the first round of his battle to keep Congress from
scuttling the deal.
On an 8-8 vote, the Senate Foreign Relations commit
tee refused to block the $4.8 billion arms sales package,
in which the United States would sell jet fighters to Israel
and two of its Arab neighbors, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
Under parliamentary procedure, Congress may reject
an administration's planned arms sale within 30 days of
its formal submission to Capitol Hill. But the administra
tion does not need express approval from Congress. To
halt such a deal, both the House and Senate must ap
prove resolutions blocking it.

bond. Newton remained in custody with bail set at
$50,000, while Heard was held in lieu of $25,000 bail.

Deputies said at least two shots were tired in the
incident about 100 miles south of San Francisco.
Tremors felt in Santa Clara Valley
San Jose — Some 60 earthquakes were recorded in the
Santa Clara Valley in the 24 hours ending at 6 p.m.
yesterday, but only "half a dozen" of the tremors were
felt by residents, University of California seismologists

area east of here — was recorded at 5:27 p.m.

Fed supports higher interest rates
Washington — The Federal Reserve Board, reflecting
its concern over inflation, continued yesterday to sup
port higher interest rates despite fears by the administra
tion that they could slow the nation's economy.
The board raised its discount rate on loans to banks to
7 per cent, up from 6V2 per cent previously and the
highest since early 1975 when the county was in a deep
recession.
The action was one of a series taken by the board in
recent weeks to push up interest rates throughout the
economy in an effort to cool inflationary pressures.
The new chairman of the Fed, C. William Miller, said
yesterday that if inflation is not checked it could go
above 10 per cent within a few years and that such an
increase could bring on a serious recession.
Electric power sales investigated
Washington — Emergency electric power that was
moved into areas hardest hit by the winter coal strike
