# Flashing, bouncing 'OSL-ARC' wins $2000 from Mattel Toys

In a few years, a new item called
the OSL-ARC may catch your at
tention among toy store shelves
crammed with Barbie dolls, talk
ing frogs and plastic noses.
No simple plaything, this
super-ball-like object attached to
a string has a controllable oscillat
ing light source inside that will
create flashing patterns when
twirled. And when the OSL-ARC is
bounced on the floor, it will
"explode" with light.
Mike Barry, creator of the
OSL-ARC, was announced first
prize winner of the recent Mattel
Toy Contest, on April 24-25. The
contest, open to all Stanford stu
dents who had taken at least one
course in engineering, attracted
80 applicants. However, only 23
students eventually brought in
projects to be judged.
Barry, a first year graduate stu
dent in product design, won $2000
for his creation. The idea, he said,

came to him easily. It's based on
something he likes to do, he ad
ded, twirling a ball on a string.
Other winning entries included
Scott Wakefield, a third year
graduate student in electrical en
gineering. Wakefield won the
second prize $1500 for his
friction-free bicycle
speedometer-odometer, called
the Easy Rider.
Brad Bartanen, a senior in gen
eral engineering, took the $1000
third prize with a new swing con
cept and Dave Willis, a first-year
graduate student in the Art De
partment received fourth prize of
$500 for his Gravity Racer; a
fiberglass racer with steering and
disc brakes.
Simon Perez, a first year
graduate student in mechanical
engineering, won honorable
mention for a child's pedal car
which runs on tracks like a tank.
Designing an entry for the con
test was time-consuming, accord
ing to all the winners. But two of

the contestants knew what to ex
pect. Both Barry and Wakefield
entered the first Mattel contest
last year, winning second and
third place, respectively.
Students were encouraged to
work on their own without faculty
help, according to Mechanical
Engineering Prof. Robert McKim,
the contest's faculty sponsor.
"Part of my feeling was that
competition should be separate
from special class activities,"
McKim said.
Entries were judged by a five
person panel selected by Mattel.
The panel included a child
psychologist, a designer, and a
toy store owner.
Last year's winning toy, de
signed by Eric Lee, is in the pro
cess of being marketed and has
reached the production design
level, McKim said.
"I thought the contest was a
good chance for students to exer
cise their imagination and make
some money," he said.
