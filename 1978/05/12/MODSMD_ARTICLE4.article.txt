# Traditional curriculum returning
## 
### Susan Hart 
Growing concern over decreasing
educational standards has caused
many of the nation's colleges and
universities to re-evaluate their cur
ricula.
Harvard's new "core curriculum,"
which is considered by many to be
one of the most important under
graduate reform efforts, is having a
broad impact on universities. Debate
at Harvard has prompted a national
movement toward increased
academic requirements.
The University of Chicago has al
ready implemented a more stringent
requirement program and St. John's
in Annapolis, Md., now has a "great
books" curriculum requirement.
Amherst College, in Mas
sachusetts, which gained national at
tention in the late '40s when it

adopted a core course in the prob
lems of American civilization, drop
ped the program 20 years later.
During the '60s, the liberalized
education movement called for more
student choice in determining their
own undergraduate programs. But
Amherst faculty is now discussing a
return to the core course.
Here at Stanford, discussions are
focusing on the introduction of a
university-wide Western Culture re
quirement.
"We should not be complacent
about our capacity to adapt to new
needs," said President Richard
Lyman in a recent address to the
Academic Council.
However, Lyman advocates a
"piecemeal approach" in changing
academic requirements rather than
the method adopted by Harvard.

The more liberal Western Culture
approach here is "inherently more
attractive, given the general reluc
tance of contemporary academics to
assert the traditional kind of magiste
rial judgments about what consti
tutes an educated human being," he
said.
The Harvard core curriculum
proposal specifically attempts to de
sign requirements to "create edu
cated people."
"When we welcome a student at
graduation," the report states, "We
are welcoming them to the company
of educated men and women."
"An educated person," the report
continues, "should have a critical
appreciation of the ways in which we
gain knowledge and understanding
of the universe, of society, and of
