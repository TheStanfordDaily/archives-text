# Traditional curriculum returning
## 
### Susan Hart 
Growing concern over decreasing
educational standards has caused
many of the nation's colleges and
universities to re-evaluate their cur
ricula.
Harvard's new "core curriculum,"
which is considered by many to be
one of the most important under
graduate reform efforts, is having a
broad impact on universities. Debate
at Harvard has prompted a national
movement toward increased
academic requirements.
The University of Chicago has al
ready implemented a more stringent
requirement program and St. John's
in Annapolis, Md., now has a "great
books" curriculum requirement.
Amherst College, in Mas
sachusetts, which gained national at
tention in the late '40s when it

adopted a core course in the prob
lems of American civilization, drop
ped the program 20 years later.
During the '60s, the liberalized
education movement called for more
student choice in determining their
own undergraduate programs. But
Amherst faculty is now discussing a
return to the core course.
Here at Stanford, discussions are
focusing on the introduction of a
university-wide Western Culture re
quirement.
"We should not be complacent
about our capacity to adapt to new
needs," said President Richard
Lyman in a recent address to the
Academic Council.
However, Lyman advocates a
"piecemeal approach" in changing
academic requirements rather than
the method adopted by Harvard.

The more liberal Western Culture
approach here is "inherently more
attractive, given the general reluc
tance of contemporary academics to
assert the traditional kind of magiste
rial judgments about what consti
tutes an educated human being," he
said.
The Harvard core curriculum
proposal specifically attempts to de
sign requirements to "create edu
cated people."
"When we welcome a student at
graduation," the report states, "We
are welcoming them to the company
of educated men and women."
"An educated person," the report
continues, "should have a critical
appreciation of the ways in which we
gain knowledge and understanding
of the universe, of society, and of
ourselves.
"A crucial difference between the
educated and the uneducated is the
extent to which one's life experience
is viewed in wider contexts," accord
ing to the Harvard report.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Herant Katchadourian, a Western
Culture advocate, says there is a
need for Stanford students to receive
a "broadly-based, solid liberal edu
cation which is well integrated."
Exposure to fields outside a stu
dent's major "as well as a meaningful
acquaintance with culture and fts his
torical context," regardless of a stu
dent's major is important, he said.
"How to achieve it is something we
are in the process of working out,"
said Katchadourian.
The Harvard core curriculum will
occupy about one-quarter of a stu
dents time while at Harvard.
That curriculum consists of up to
10 courses in five academic areas, as
follows:
— one course each in literature
and the arts;

— two courses in history; one exp
laining "some aspect of the present
world" and another a pre-10th cen
tury topic;
— social and philosophical
analysis;
— science and mathematics; one
course in the physical and mathemat
ical areas and another in biological or
behavioral sciences; and
— foreign languages and culture.
In addition to the five major area
requirement, Harvard students must
demonstrate "competence in algeb
raic manipulation and quantitative
reasoning," writing and acquire
fluency in at least one language.
The Stanford Faculty Senate and
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) will continue to dis
cuss the Western Culture require
ment.
The Faculty Senate will decide be
fore the end of the year whether to
adopt a proposal calling for a two
year trial period to develop courses
to fulfill the Western Culture re
quirement, according to History
Prof. Peter Stansky, chairman of the
Faculty Se'nate.

Amherst College, in Mas
sachusetts, which gained national at
tention in the late '40s when it

adopted a core course in the prob
lems of American civilization, drop
ped the program 20 years later.
During the '60s, the liberalized
education movement called for more
student choice in determining their
own undergraduate programs. But
Amherst faculty is now discussing a
return to the core course.
Here at Stanford, discussions are
focusing on the introduction of a
university-wide Western Culture re
quirement.
"We should not be complacent
about our capacity to adapt to new
needs," said President Richard
Lyman in a recent address to the
Academic Council.
However, Lyman advocates a
"piecemeal approach" in changing
academic requirements rather than
the method adopted by Harvard.

The more liberal Western Culture
approach here is "inherently more
attractive, given the general reluc
tance of contemporary academics to
assert the traditional kind of magiste
rial judgments about what consti
tutes an educated human being," he
said.
The Harvard core curriculum
proposal specifically attempts to de
sign requirements to "create edu
cated people."
"When we welcome a student at
graduation," the report states, "We
are welcoming them to the company
of educated men and women."
"An educated person," the report
continues, "should have a critical
appreciation of the ways in which we
gain knowledge and understanding
of the universe, of society, and of
ourselves.
"A crucial difference between the
educated and the uneducated is the
extent to which one's life experience
is viewed in wider contexts," accord
ing to the Harvard report.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Herant Katchadourian, a Western
Culture advocate, says there is a
need for Stanford students to receive
a "broadly-based, solid liberal edu
cation which is well integrated."
Exposure to fields outside a stu
dent's major "as well as a meaningful
acquaintance with culture and fts his
torical context," regardless of a stu
dent's major is important, he said.
"How to achieve it is something we
are in the process of working out,"
said Katchadourian.
The Harvard core curriculum will
occupy about one-quarter of a stu
dents time while at Harvard.
That curriculum consists of up to
10 courses in five academic areas, as
follows:
— one course each in literature
and the arts;

— two courses in history; one exp
laining "some aspect of the present
world" and another a pre-10th cen
tury topic;
— social and philosophical
analysis;
— science and mathematics; one
course in the physical and mathemat
ical areas and another in biological or
behavioral sciences; and
— foreign languages and culture.
In addition to the five major area
requirement, Harvard students must
demonstrate "competence in algeb
raic manipulation and quantitative
reasoning," writing and acquire
fluency in at least one language.
The Stanford Faculty Senate and
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) will continue to dis
cuss the Western Culture require
ment.
The Faculty Senate will decide be
fore the end of the year whether to
adopt a proposal calling for a two
year trial period to develop courses
to fulfill the Western Culture re
quirement, according to History
Prof. Peter Stansky, chairman of the
Faculty Se'nate.
Growing concern over decreasing
educational standards has caused
many of the nation's colleges and
universities to re-evaluate their cur
ricula.
Harvard's new "core curriculum,"
which is considered by many to be
one of the most important under
graduate reform efforts, is having a
broad impact on universities. Debate
at Harvard has prompted a national
movement toward increased
academic requirements.
The University of Chicago has al
ready implemented a more stringent
requirement program and St. John's
in Annapolis, Md., now has a "great
books" curriculum requirement.
