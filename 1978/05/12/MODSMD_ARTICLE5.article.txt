# Experts feel national security only factor in arms sale policy
## 
### Kevin Cox 
The national security of the Un
ited States should be the only fac
tor determining America's policy
on arms sales abroad, two au
thorities in military policy agreed
last night in a symposium in Skil
ling Auditorium.
Sanford Gottlieb, arms reduc
tion coordinator for a new citi
zens' lobby called New Direc
tions, and Thomas Jones, chair
man and chief executive officer of
Northrop Corp., participated in
the symposium sponsored by
Stanford New Directions.
"There should be one and only
one criterion for arms sales —
U.S. national security," Gottlieb
said. He added that the "vital in
terests" of the country should be
defined. But he said that giving
arms to countries the U.S. relies
on for a "significant amount" of
oil exports, so that those coun
tries can defend themselves,
would be a valid reason.
"Then, that country's security
becomes a vital interest of the Un
ited States," Gottlieb said.
However, Gottlieb said there
are "special cases where moral in

terests are involved. The case of
Israel might be a moral question
— they are not important to the
vital interests of this country."
(ones also said that countries
should be "told that they will not
be allowed to buy arms if their
security is not important to us."
Jones also proposed that deci
sions on which countries' security
are vital to the United States
should be made before the coun
try asks to buy arms.
"There should be a clear policy
from the start," Jones said. "The
situation should be addressed
from the top, not after the need
has arisen," he added.
Because of the Mutual Security
Act and the Munitions Control
Act, Jones said that Northrop can
not make its own arm sales deci
sions.
"The arms industry has a re
sponsibility of serving the in
terests of the country, under strict
policy controls, in the most effi
cient way possible."
Gottlieb said he saw nothing
wrong with Jones' proposals for
predetermining arms policy case
by case.

He added that under President
Jimmy Carter's proposed arms
policy, "there are two classes of
nations — one where the criteria
wouldn't apply at all, and
loopholes for the ones (nations)
where the criteria would apply."
While Gottlieb and Jones ag
reed on arms sales policy, they
disagreed on disarmament policy.
Jones called unilateral disarma
ment by the United States "coun
terproductive to the cause of sec
urity in the first place."
Calling for "meaningful agree
ments," Jones said that the United
States should enter into a bilateral
agreement but not until it is
"clearly identified, agreed upon
and safeguards are obtained."
Gottlieb, however, said that un
ilateral disarmament by the Un
ited States is necessary. "There is
no way to even begin discussions
without the U.S. taking unilateral
steps and cutting back on our
own," he said.
"There is no reason for Russia
or any of the other countries to
take us seriously unless we're
going to do something that hurts
us."

U.S. national security," Gottlieb
said. He added that the "vital in
terests" of the country should be
defined. But he said that giving
arms to countries the U.S. relies
on for a "significant amount" of
oil exports, so that those coun
tries can defend themselves,
would be a valid reason.
"Then, that country's security
becomes a vital interest of the Un
ited States," Gottlieb said.
However, Gottlieb said there
are "special cases where moral in

terests are involved. The case of
Israel might be a moral question
— they are not important to the
vital interests of this country."
(ones also said that countries
should be "told that they will not
be allowed to buy arms if their
security is not important to us."
Jones also proposed that deci
sions on which countries' security
are vital to the United States
should be made before the coun
try asks to buy arms.
"There should be a clear policy
from the start," Jones said. "The
situation should be addressed
from the top, not after the need
has arisen," he added.
Because of the Mutual Security
Act and the Munitions Control
Act, Jones said that Northrop can
not make its own arm sales deci
sions.
"The arms industry has a re
sponsibility of serving the in
terests of the country, under strict
policy controls, in the most effi
cient way possible."
Gottlieb said he saw nothing
wrong with Jones' proposals for
predetermining arms policy case
by case.

He added that under President
Jimmy Carter's proposed arms
policy, "there are two classes of
nations — one where the criteria
wouldn't apply at all, and
loopholes for the ones (nations)
where the criteria would apply."
While Gottlieb and Jones ag
reed on arms sales policy, they
disagreed on disarmament policy.
Jones called unilateral disarma
ment by the United States "coun
terproductive to the cause of sec
urity in the first place."
Calling for "meaningful agree
ments," Jones said that the United
States should enter into a bilateral
agreement but not until it is
"clearly identified, agreed upon
and safeguards are obtained."
Gottlieb, however, said that un
ilateral disarmament by the Un
ited States is necessary. "There is
no way to even begin discussions
without the U.S. taking unilateral
steps and cutting back on our
own," he said.
"There is no reason for Russia
or any of the other countries to
take us seriously unless we're
going to do something that hurts
us."
