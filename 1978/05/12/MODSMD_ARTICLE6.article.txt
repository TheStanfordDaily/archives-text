# Fund-back alternative posed
## Elections are pointless exercises opinions 
### 
There has been a lot of uproar
lately about the poor voter turnout at
the last elections. Not only did eight
fee assessments fail to pass, but
the validity of the referenda on that
ballot has also been questioned (cor
rectly). With such a low turnout, stu
dent opinion cannot be genuinely
determined.
Obviously, the existing voting sys
tem is not performing satisfac
torily. There ought to be a bet
ter way of doing things! Australia
has a mandatory voting procedure
whereby electors who do not vote
are fined. However, such a system
would not be practicable at Stanford
given the relative lack of coercive au
thority of the ASSU.
Since there is no easy way of
punishingthosewhofail to vote, why
not reward those who do? I propose
the amendment of the ASSU bylaws
to allow for the authorization of a $1
fee assessment during each quarter
when an election is normally
scheduled to be refunded at the time
that each student votes.
This system has several advan
tages. It appeals to the need for in
stant gratification of a generation
raised on a steady diet of television.
It is easily worth the time of most
students to spend a few minutes fil
ling out a ballot if they can pick up a
buck for their trouble. Fee assess
ment proposals would be assured of
passage if they received majority
support.
The sentiments of Stanford stu
dents on referenda could be far more
accurately assessed. It would also
foster the development of regular
voting habits in Stanford students. As
an age group we are notoriously lax
about voting in elections at any level.
I estimate that voter turnout would at
least double based on my own
straw-sample.
The main drawback of this system
in practical terms would be the in
creased cost of security at the polling
places on campus. However, that
cost would be offset, wholly or in
part, by the uncollected funds which
would inevitably remain.
Even if a particularly high turnout
required that additional monies be
spent, it would be more than worth
the expense to get a large majority of
the student body participating in the
political process to this minimal ex
tent.
A larger fee assessment to be re
funded would doubtless increase the
amount of participation, but it might
be too inequitable for those persons
who were unable to vote for legiti
mate reasons.
Some might question the ethics of
"bribing" students to vote. I do not
believe that publicity campaigns with
performances by the Band, ads in the
Daily, and coverage on KZSU are any
more ethical means of "coaxing"
students to vote. The differences be
tween these ploys and the "get out

the vote" tactics of money-spending
American electoral machines
are simply differences of
degree.
Furthermore, I would argue that
the monetary incentive involved
would make voters realize that gov
ernment, at all levels, affects them
directly. They are free to vote as their
ideologies direct them to, but they
do so knowing that their vote will
have ramifications which will affect
many people. They will already have
concrete evidence of that in their poc
kets.
One additional adjustment would

be required to make this new voting
system completely effective. Those
persons who so desire should be
able to mark an appropriate space on
their ballot and thereby forgo the
standard $1 refund.
'Vote for the money'
Conversely, for those who do not
feel competent to vote on any mea
sure, an option could be provided
stating, "I only voted for the
money." That is as valid a political
statement as any other could be.
Unfortunately, as a graduating
senior with extensive academic re
quirements, to complete, I do not

Ignacio Lazo

have the time to work on forwarding
my proposals personally. However,
if my ideas find some degree of ac
ceptance among Stanford students,
I'm certain that some "aspiring
politicos" will incorporate them as
part of their platforms during the
next ASSU Senate elections.
I at least hope that my fellow stu
dents will use their fertile imagiha
tions to formulate alternatives to the
pointless exercises that are elections
at Stanford under the existing sys
tem.

more ethical means of "coaxing"
students to vote. The differences be
tween these ploys and the "get out

the vote" tactics of money-spending
American electoral machines
are simply differences of
degree.
Furthermore, I would argue that
the monetary incentive involved
would make voters realize that gov
ernment, at all levels, affects them
directly. They are free to vote as their
ideologies direct them to, but they
do so knowing that their vote will
have ramifications which will affect
many people. They will already have
concrete evidence of that in their poc
kets.
One additional adjustment would

be required to make this new voting
system completely effective. Those
persons who so desire should be
able to mark an appropriate space on
their ballot and thereby forgo the
standard $1 refund.
'Vote for the money'
Conversely, for those who do not
feel competent to vote on any mea
sure, an option could be provided
stating, "I only voted for the
money." That is as valid a political
statement as any other could be.
Unfortunately, as a graduating
senior with extensive academic re
quirements, to complete, I do not

Ignacio Lazo

have the time to work on forwarding
my proposals personally. However,
if my ideas find some degree of ac
ceptance among Stanford students,
I'm certain that some "aspiring
politicos" will incorporate them as
part of their platforms during the
next ASSU Senate elections.
I at least hope that my fellow stu
dents will use their fertile imagiha
tions to formulate alternatives to the
pointless exercises that are elections
at Stanford under the existing sys
tem.
(Ignacio Lazo, a senior, is majoring in
political science.)
There has been a lot of uproar
lately about the poor voter turnout at
the last elections. Not only did eight
fee assessments fail to pass, but
the validity of the referenda on that
ballot has also been questioned (cor
rectly). With such a low turnout, stu
dent opinion cannot be genuinely
determined.
Obviously, the existing voting sys
tem is not performing satisfac
torily. There ought to be a bet
ter way of doing things! Australia
has a mandatory voting procedure
whereby electors who do not vote
are fined. However, such a system
would not be practicable at Stanford
given the relative lack of coercive au
thority of the ASSU.
Since there is no easy way of
punishingthosewhofail to vote, why
not reward those who do? I propose
the amendment of the ASSU bylaws
to allow for the authorization of a $1
fee assessment during each quarter
when an election is normally
scheduled to be refunded at the time
that each student votes.
This system has several advan
tages. It appeals to the need for in
stant gratification of a generation
raised on a steady diet of television.
It is easily worth the time of most
students to spend a few minutes fil
ling out a ballot if they can pick up a
buck for their trouble. Fee assess
ment proposals would be assured of
passage if they received majority
support.
The sentiments of Stanford stu
dents on referenda could be far more
accurately assessed. It would also
foster the development of regular
voting habits in Stanford students. As
an age group we are notoriously lax
about voting in elections at any level.
I estimate that voter turnout would at
least double based on my own
straw-sample.
The main drawback of this system
in practical terms would be the in
creased cost of security at the polling
places on campus. However, that
cost would be offset, wholly or in
part, by the uncollected funds which
would inevitably remain.
Even if a particularly high turnout
required that additional monies be
spent, it would be more than worth
the expense to get a large majority of
the student body participating in the
political process to this minimal ex
tent.
A larger fee assessment to be re
funded would doubtless increase the
amount of participation, but it might
be too inequitable for those persons
who were unable to vote for legiti
mate reasons.
Some might question the ethics of
"bribing" students to vote. I do not
believe that publicity campaigns with
performances by the Band, ads in the
Daily, and coverage on KZSU are any
more ethical means of "coaxing"
students to vote. The differences be
tween these ploys and the "get out

the vote" tactics of money-spending
American electoral machines
are simply differences of
degree.
