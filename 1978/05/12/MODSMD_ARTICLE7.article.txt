# Editorial
## COP farewell 
### 
Last year we took one of our more
unenlightened editorial positions
and endorsed the Johnson slate over
the Jordan slate in the race for Coun
cil of Presidents. Glenn Jordan, Anne
Henkels, Steve Westly and Greg Lar
son were elected in spite of our en
dorsement to the COP last spring,
and as they turn over their
office and offices to their successors,
we'd like to make a few final com
ments concerning the performance
of this year's COP.
We decided not to endorse the
Jordan slate because we felt they
lacked the ability to compromise and
to understand the actions of the
ASSU Senate. History shows us
wrong on both counts. Throughout a
year filled with some complex issues
and a few constitutional crises, the
COP acted fairly, reasonably, dili
gently, and quickly. They have not
only worked with the senate and
other ASSU officials, but with many
other students. We find their actions
marked with honesty and above all a
concern for the students, and not for

themselves. The four presidents
have always given generously of their
time, whether it be just to listen or to
lend a hand. Though they may be
politicians, they have not been
politicos — the pettiness, backstab
bing, and cheap threats which some
student officials occasionally prac
tice have not even been attempted
by the COP.
As most campus observers know,
we usually have only criticism for the
ASSU, but, to be frank, we've been
impressed by this year's COP. We
hope next year's COP of Andrew
Coldenkranz, Regina Petty, Fred
Estes, and Mary Morimoto — whom
we find well-qualified and quite able
to follow in the footsteps of this
year'sCOP —will follow the example
of this year's COP, which has been
the best in recent years.
On second thought, we do have
one criticism of the COP: they won't
be in any official position next year.
Maybe they would like to run for se
nate in the fall .
