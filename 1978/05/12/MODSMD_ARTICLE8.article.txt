Rallies, sit-ins annoying
Often, the more a particular in
terest group harps on an issue, the
more the general populace wearies
of it. Certain tactics which result in
omnipresent publicity are only effec
tive up to a certain point.
It seems as though the Stanford
community has been saturated with
the present approach to the South
African investment situation (i.e. ral
lies, sit-ins, protests). If these ag
gravating methods of arousing social
awareness aren't altered, the student
body will only become more im
mune, and perhaps even callous, to
the issue.
The public is aware! Another
poster, headline, or rally will no
longer serve to inform as much as it
will serve to annoy.

SCRIP hypocritical
After reading Tom Devine's letter
(Daily, May 9), as well as many other
letters and articles pertaining to the
South African issue, I find it time to
comment on the hypocrisy of SCRIP.
Devine claims that the trustees
should pay attention to facts and not
to the majority of students who do
not think that divestment is the ans
wer or who do not want it badly
enough to vote for withdrawal.
It seems rather odd to me that a
group calling for majority rule in
South Africa, would call for minority
rule at Stanford. Of course, SCRIP
says that they are right; therefore,
even if the are the minority, they
should decide what to do.
I am sure that the leaders in South
Africa also feel that they are right,
even though they are in the minority.
How can SCRIP apply one principle
to Stanford and another to South Af-

Rica without clearly being hypocriti
cal?
I am not surprised at all that the
trustees will not conform to the
hypocritical demands of SCRIP. I also
agree with the principle that Stanford
should remain in South Africa and
use its influence to change apartheid
instead of divesting and pushing
South Africa toward anarchy.

Rallies disturbing
Within the past two weeks, I have
observed three different student ral
lies on campus. In each case I was
disturbed by statements that vitiated
the humanitarian aims of the pro
tests: a total disregard for a staff
member's disagreement with the
protester's' position; an out-of
context quotation from an article on
the Bakke case in a recent Campus
Report; an accusation to Mr. Lyman
that he was "either a liar or an in
competent administrator"; an asser
tion that the trustees met in Los
Angeles to avoid possible distur
bances in San Francisco. I could go
on.
Concern and support for oppres
sed peoples is admirable — in fact, I
cannot believe any member of the
Stanford community does not feel
anquish over the probems of the
Bakke decision and the fate of black
people in South Africa. It is, how
ever, distressing when the zeal of
those who are striving to insure the
rights of others overlook the fact that
their means contradict their end. I
hope that it is possible to maintain
humanity in the - search for
humanitarianism.
