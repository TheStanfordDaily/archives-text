# Netters upset

### Ivan Maisel 
Stanford's women's tennis
team closed out their regular
season on a losing note Satur
day, as they were defeated by
UCLA 5-4 in Los Angeles.
The Bruins, in avenging their
7-2 loss to the Cards here ear
lier this season, threw the
seedings for next month's
AIAW tournament into confu
sion.
"Stanford and UCLA will be
ranked No. 2 and No. 3 (behind
USC) tor the nationals," said
Stanford coach Anne Gould.
"It's lip to the national commit
tee to decide."
UCLA's homecourt advan
tage was just too much for the
Cards to handle.
"It's always tough playing
down there," said Could.
"Their courts are a lot slower
than what we're used to."
The courts weren't the only
thing slowing the Cardinals
down. The weather was stifling
(94 degrees, smoggy), and the
cold that everyone on campus
seems to be getting struck the
team, too. Donna Rubin lost
her doubles match and played
half of her singles before suc
cumbing to illness.
"We were counting on
Donna to win her singles be
cause she beat her opponent
up here," said Gould. "The
weather just got to her."
Gould switched Kathy Jor
dan from No. 1 singles to No. 2
for the same reason. "Kathy
has been sick since the Ojai In
vitational, and just hasn't been

playing up to par. I decided to
move her sister Barbara to No.
I because she's been outplay
ing Kathy."
Barbara lost the No. 1 sing
les, 6-2, 6-1, to UCLA's jean
DuVall, who is considered to
be one of the best collegiate
players in the country.
In somewhat of a surprise,
Stanford's No. I doubles team
of Susie Hagey and Diane Mor
rison were beaten by Becky
Bell and Kathy Snelson of
UCLA, b-.i, 6-2.
"Susie and Diane had beaten
those girls up here, and we
were hoping that they would
do it again," said Gould. "I
don't think their girls played
that much better this time. I
|ust think our girls couldn't
quite put it together."
Barring an upset in the AIAW
Nationals next month, Hagey,
Morrison and the rest of the
Stanford team will have
another chance to "put it to
gether" against UCLA. Since it
is probable that the teams will
be ranked two and three for
the tournament, their possible
third and final match could be
in the semifinals.
