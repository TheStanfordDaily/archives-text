## Lambert resigns coaching post 
### 
Citing "financial considera
tions" as a motivating factor,
volleyball coach Art Lambert
resigned his position Friday,
marking the second time in as
many years that Lambert has
resigned following a title sea
son.
Lambert came to Stanford in
ilh- fall of 1974 to act as the first
full-time water polo coach for
the Cardinals. In his second
year, he coached the team to a
Pacific-8 championship, only
to lose in the semi-finals of the
NCAA championships. The
next year, however, Stanford
edged out UCI A, I J-12, in the
finals to become NCAA champ
ion.
Following the season, how
ever, Lambert resigned the
water polo post to take over
the volleyball program for
1977-78. Continuing his
championship-aimed coach
ing, Lambert coached both the
men and the women to confer
ence titles. His resignation last
Friday followed three months
of deliberation, Lambert said.
"It's awfully difficult to make
ends meet," Lambert
explained. I felt it was what I
had to do."
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
said he was "not too surprised
(by Lambert's resignation). Me
had been talking to me about
salary problems for a few
months.

"The costs of living in this
area are so high," Ruetz added.
Lambert said he is uncertain
what line of work he will now
pursue.
"I don't know yet what I'll be
doing," he said. "I have a
number of leads, but nothing
concrete." Lambert men
tioned home construction and
athletic wear as possible fields
of work.
One thing that Lambert
seems set on, is that he proba
bly will not go back to coaching
at another school.
"The chance to work with
student athletes at Stanford
has been the most rewarding
experience. The kids are smart.
I'm not sure I'd want to coach
at another school," Lambert
said.
Lambert picked three things
that particularly stood out in
his years here.
"The NCAA (water polo)
championship, of course, is
one. The team came along so
fast. Coaching women (in vol
leyball) for the first time was
certainly a tremendous experi
ence also. They were a tre
mendous team," said Lambert.
The third high point of his
coaching career was "the great
deal of satisfaction I got from
having players placed on na
tional teams in two different
sports," Lambert explained.
