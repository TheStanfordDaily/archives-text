## Booters win conference title

"My soccer playing goes
back to the '30s and I always
thought that soccer was one of
the games which was not
suited for women and 40 years
later these young ladies
changed my mind," explained
French and Italian Chairman
Alphonse luilland.
Stanford's women soccer
players continued to change
spectators' minds with impres
sive teamwork in their 10-2 vic
tory over Ftayward State.
Saturday's victory clinched
the second consecutive
Northern California Women's
Soccer Conference title for the
Cards and raised their overall
record to 13-1-1. The I's next
action comes in the Stanford
Invitational Tournament slated
for May 28-30.
"We played just fantastic
soccer. They're (Hayward) not

that bad a team — we just really
outplayed them and happened
to be shooting fantastic today.
We've had games where we've
made close to this many nice
plays but the ball hasn't gone
into the net," head coach Phil
Wright said.
Stanford's 4-0 halftime lead
began with Lisa Steinkamp's
goal five minutes into the
game. Fifteen minutes later
Kris McGarrey scored and Ellen
Criep drilled a penalty shot
intothe netwith 10 minutes left
in the half, lust before the
halftime whistle, Sue Handel
dribbled through the Hayward
defense for a goal.
In the second half Hayward
got on the scoreboard with its
first goal, but not before Sonja
Schoeppel put Stanford ahead
7-0 with her hat trick. Schoep
pel's three-goal explosion
came in just four minutes.

Criep, McGarrey and Cindy
Shorney each added one goal
apiece before Hayward came
up with the final score of the
game.
Commenting on the six
player scoring attack, assistant
coach Mike Lohrer said "it's a
real surprise. We relied on one
or two players to score be
fore. Havinga diverse scoring
potential "can only help; we're
not dependent on just one
person and the team realizes
that we have to have more than
one" person putting the ball in
the goal, Lohrer said.
Besides the strong offense,
Stanford's depth was evident
in the match. Substitutes went
in and out of the game while
maintaining the skill level
throughout.
"Newer players and second
team players have started to
improveskillwise. Phil has con
fidence in them. Fortunately
we've had enough players to
spare for the second team —
you don't want to deplete it
and there's a substitution
limit," Lohrer said.
Another sign of improve
ment noticeable in recent
games has been teamwork. In
the team's development, the
factor that is "most important
is that we're playing together
as a team finally. We're really
starting to feel comfortable in
team positions," Wright said.
Steinkamp commented, "If
you get to know each other off
the field you play a lot better on

the field because you trust
each other. You're playing
more as a unit instead of as in
dividuals."
"Going to Colorado gave us
confidence in our team as a
whole. That helped — when
we came back here, Berkeley
didn't look nearly as good after
seeing them (the other schools
in the Colorado College Tour
nament)," she added.
With another league champ
ionship wrapped up, a very
successful road trip to Col
orado, and a .833 winning per
centage, it's an understate
ment to say that the team is
pleased with its achievements.
"Last season was close to a
dream season as far as I was
concerned just like the first
one. I couldn't believe any
thing could be better, but this
season's been even better. It's
been a perfect season because
we managed to win as we were
developing and now we're de
veloped," Wright commented.
"I think we can win the tour
nament and be 17-1-1 and eas
ily thebest team in thecountry.
If we play like we did the last
three weeks in Colorado,
against Berkeley and today, I
really would be glad to put up a
challenge anywhere — I would
say this is the best college wo
men's soccer team in the coun
try and someone's going to
have to show me they're better
because the way we're playing
right now no one can touch
us," Wright added.
