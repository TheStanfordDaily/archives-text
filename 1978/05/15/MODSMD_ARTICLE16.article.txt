## Coors: unethical hiring practices 
### 
Joey George

Ever see those ads in the Daily that
feature a giant Coors can and say,
"Thanks, Stanford"? Ever wonder
why Coors is thanking Stanford?
If you haven't heard by now,
there's a nationwide boycott of
Coors beer. California alone ac
counts for about 45 per cent of
Coors' total volume, and sales have
been down here around 15 per cent.
Coors is thanking Stanford for not
observing the boycott. With all the
Coors beer consumed on campus,
observance of the boycott here
would hurt sales to a noticeable de
gree.
First, some history. Last April,
Coors workers began a strike to pro
test, not wage levels, but attempts by
the company to limit seniority rights
and todiminish the authority of Local
366 over its workers.
The struggle soon grew and the
central issues became the use by the
company of lie detector tests to pry
into the lives of job applicants and
discrimination against minorities in
hiring practices.
For years, applicants hooked up to
the lie detector were asked ques
tions about their sexual preferences,
their sex lives with their spouses, and
whether or not they were com
munists.
Coors claims the questions were
made up by the company that pre
pared the tests and that questions
about sex are no longer asked. Coors
claims that the tests must still be ad

ministered to discover health prob
lems applicants may be hiding, and
to ensure applicants do not want the
jobs for suoversive reasons.
Coors denies the discrimination
charge.
Hi Mom!
Why isn't the boycott more wide
spread here? Outside observers
would consider this an activist cam
pus since we lead the rest of the na
tion in the struggle against apartheid.
The Coors boycott may seem small in
comparison, but it is nonetheless an
important issue.
One reason why the boycott isn't
in effect here is that those in favor of
the boycott haven't received a lot of
publicity.
There has been no nationwide
publicity campaign either, even
though supporters of the boycott in
clude gay rights groups, feminists
and Chicanos. Simply put, suppor
ters haven't really organized all the
means at their disposal. After all, the
boycott is only a little over one year
old.
Apparently, the Adolf Coors Co.
doesn't know that there is a lack of
infomation here. Already, there are
so-called Coors representatives hov
ering around campus, using
techniques similar to those used by
Gallo last spring during the closing
months of that famous boycott.
Last spring, in my capacity as a rush
co-chairman for one of the frater
nities, I was approached by an on

campus representative of Gallo who
was trying to get the fraternities to
use Gallo wines for punches for rush
activities. Though he could not offer
discounts on wine, he would provide
the recipes, punch bowl and all the
cups you needed.
Send no cash . •.
The Coors representative is not a
student, nor is Coors offering to help
with refreshments at rush.
Instead, the Coors representative
is a woman, middle aged, and de
scribed as very attractive. She al
legedly asks what she can do for the
fraternity and gives away free six
packs, bar signs and literature.
Someone is paying for all this, just
as someone paid for all the "help
offered during the Gallo boycott. I
would wager the Adolf Coors Co. has
more than a little to do with it.
This shows more than anything
else that Coors is taking the boycott
seriously, contrary to confident re
marks its executives have made to
the press. Peter Coors, the com
pany's marketing vice president, was
quoted in Time magazine in Dec.
1977, as saying he felt Coors had
weathered the worst.
Really? Then why are attractive
women representing the company
giving away free beer and anti
boycott literature?
It seems to me that now is the time
for Coors to feel the full impact of the
boycott. They're worried as it is. It's
up to us to make them more worried.

It's up to us to force Coors to correct
its injustices: to respect the privacy
of its employees, to institute fair hir
ing practices. The opportunity is just
waiting to be seized.
.. . just more Coors beer!
All it takes is to be able to give up
Coors. Switch to another brand.
Sure, you'll taste the difference in
other beers, but it's worth the effort
and temporary inconvenience to be
able to correct the injustices prac
ticed by the Coors company. There
are other beers with better taste that
aren't that much more expensive.
I've liked the taste of Coors since I
first tasted it, and I've drunk a good
bit of it since I came to Stanford. But I
can no longer enjoy the taste with a
clear conscience. I would hope that
from now on, you won't be able to
either.
Boycott Coors.

claims that the tests must still be ad

ministered to discover health prob
lems applicants may be hiding, and
to ensure applicants do not want the
jobs for suoversive reasons.
Coors denies the discrimination
charge.
Hi Mom!
Why isn't the boycott more wide
spread here? Outside observers
would consider this an activist cam
pus since we lead the rest of the na
tion in the struggle against apartheid.
The Coors boycott may seem small in
comparison, but it is nonetheless an
important issue.
One reason why the boycott isn't
in effect here is that those in favor of
the boycott haven't received a lot of
publicity.
There has been no nationwide
publicity campaign either, even
though supporters of the boycott in
clude gay rights groups, feminists
and Chicanos. Simply put, suppor
ters haven't really organized all the
means at their disposal. After all, the
boycott is only a little over one year
old.
Apparently, the Adolf Coors Co.
doesn't know that there is a lack of
infomation here. Already, there are
so-called Coors representatives hov
ering around campus, using
techniques similar to those used by
Gallo last spring during the closing
months of that famous boycott.
Last spring, in my capacity as a rush
co-chairman for one of the frater
nities, I was approached by an on

campus representative of Gallo who
was trying to get the fraternities to
use Gallo wines for punches for rush
activities. Though he could not offer
discounts on wine, he would provide
the recipes, punch bowl and all the
cups you needed.
Send no cash . •.
The Coors representative is not a
student, nor is Coors offering to help
with refreshments at rush.
Instead, the Coors representative
is a woman, middle aged, and de
scribed as very attractive. She al
legedly asks what she can do for the
fraternity and gives away free six
packs, bar signs and literature.
Someone is paying for all this, just
as someone paid for all the "help
offered during the Gallo boycott. I
would wager the Adolf Coors Co. has
more than a little to do with it.
This shows more than anything
else that Coors is taking the boycott
seriously, contrary to confident re
marks its executives have made to
the press. Peter Coors, the com
pany's marketing vice president, was
quoted in Time magazine in Dec.
1977, as saying he felt Coors had
weathered the worst.
Really? Then why are attractive
women representing the company
giving away free beer and anti
boycott literature?
It seems to me that now is the time
for Coors to feel the full impact of the
boycott. They're worried as it is. It's
up to us to make them more worried.

It's up to us to force Coors to correct
its injustices: to respect the privacy
of its employees, to institute fair hir
ing practices. The opportunity is just
waiting to be seized.
.. . just more Coors beer!
All it takes is to be able to give up
Coors. Switch to another brand.
Sure, you'll taste the difference in
other beers, but it's worth the effort
and temporary inconvenience to be
able to correct the injustices prac
ticed by the Coors company. There
are other beers with better taste that
aren't that much more expensive.
I've liked the taste of Coors since I
first tasted it, and I've drunk a good
bit of it since I came to Stanford. But I
can no longer enjoy the taste with a
clear conscience. I would hope that
from now on, you won't be able to
either.
Boycott Coors.

Ever see those ads in the Daily that
feature a giant Coors can and say,
"Thanks, Stanford"? Ever wonder
why Coors is thanking Stanford?
If you haven't heard by now,
there's a nationwide boycott of
Coors beer. California alone ac
counts for about 45 per cent of
Coors' total volume, and sales have
been down here around 15 per cent.
Coors is thanking Stanford for not
observing the boycott. With all the
Coors beer consumed on campus,
observance of the boycott here
would hurt sales to a noticeable de
gree.
First, some history. Last April,
Coors workers began a strike to pro
test, not wage levels, but attempts by
the company to limit seniority rights
and todiminish the authority of Local
366 over its workers.
The struggle soon grew and the
central issues became the use by the
company of lie detector tests to pry
into the lives of job applicants and
discrimination against minorities in
hiring practices.
For years, applicants hooked up to
the lie detector were asked ques
tions about their sexual preferences,
their sex lives with their spouses, and
whether or not they were com
munists.
Coors claims the questions were
made up by the company that pre
pared the tests and that questions
about sex are no longer asked. Coors
claims that the tests must still be ad

ministered to discover health prob
lems applicants may be hiding, and
to ensure applicants do not want the
jobs for suoversive reasons.
