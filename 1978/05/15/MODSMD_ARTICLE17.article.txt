Gay day like jr. high
While commuting to school sev
eral weeks ago, I took note of a radio
news story announcing that day was
national gay blue jeans day. Wearing
jeans as usual, I was surprised to hear
that gays were being urged to wear
jeans as an act of solidarity and pride.
In light of the recent media cam
paign against homosexual rights, it is
understandable that gays would
want to launch a public relations
event of their own, but what is to be
gained by a blue jeans day?
The organizers of gay blue jeans
day would like to see society divided
into two groups. Gays would wear
jeans, and straights would not. Un
fortunately, the world is not so sim
ple.
There were at least eight distinct
groups within society on gay blue
jeans day: — straights who never
wear jeans, — straights who usually
wear jeans, but didn't for fear of os
tracism, — straights who wore jeans
because they hadn't heard that it was
national gay blue jeans day, —
straights who wore jeans because
they didn't care what day it was, —
gays who always wear jeans — gays
who don't normally wear jeans but
did because they had decided to
come out of the closet, — gays who
didn't wear jeans because they
feared coming out of the closet, and
— gays who didn't wear jeans be
cause they didn't care what day it was
and thought the whole thing was
silly.
So if one wore blue jeans on gay
blue jeans day it means he is gay, he
didn't know, or he doesn't care
("he" in the generic sense, of
course). This seems to prove no
thing!
From the poster blitz on campus I
note that Tuesday, May 16, is Stan
ford gay blue jeans day. Is this to
become a monthly event? This situa
tion reminds me of junior high
school.
Every Thursday was 'fairy day' (my
junior high school was not as sophis
ticated as Stanford; we referred to

homosexuals as "fairies' rather than
'gays'). If one wore green or yellow
on Thursday, he was immediately as
sumed to be a 'fairy' and ostracized
as such.
I had hoped that when I came to
Stanford I would encounter people
at an intellectual level above that of
my junior high school. I think that I
have, and I think that most people
will accept Stanford gay blue jeans
day as the joke that it is.

Misdirected boycott
This letter is directed to Janet
Funk, Curtis Whitson, Elfie Forbes,
Dave Swanson, and anyone else who
would boycott the Senior Pledge
Program to protest the trustees' posi
tion on South Africa proxy voting.
To begin with, the Senior Pledge
Program is not a vehicle of the trus
tees, administration, or the familiar
scapegoat, "the University." It is a
program conceived, designed, and
painstakingly executed by students
who are just as concerned about
Stanford's political actions as any
other group.
Second, Senior Pledge donations
are in no way associated with the en
dowment fund or other profit yield
ing plans. The donations are gener
ally restricted gifts; each donor may
choose to support whatever program
or cause he or she desires.
Most gifts end up as funding for IM
and club sports, student loans and
scholarships, special academic prog
rams, as wpII as other luxuries which
serve to make our time at Stanford a
pleasant experience. Are these the
targets you have so carefully chosen
as the best way to protest against the
trustees?
Third, the Senior Pledge Program
is only seeking gifts of $15 to $50
spread over a three year period. I
cannot understand why a boycott
employing mail to every senior and
use of United Campus Christian

Ministry funds would be wasted on
such a small scale project as Senior
Pledge.
If the issue of U.S. involvement in
South Africa is so important that you
will attack other harmless and unre
lated student programs to advance
your position, I would suggest that
you aim higher. Find an approach
which will have a real impact, or at
least make a strong statement with
out hurting your fellow students,
whose support you seek.
If I may make use of your letter to
the Daily, May 11, why not "interfere
with (Stanford's) high and holy pur
pose of turning out engineers, doc
tors, and teachers" by refusing to
graduate?

national gay blue jeans day. Wearing
jeans as usual, I was surprised to hear
that gays were being urged to wear
jeans as an act of solidarity and pride.
In light of the recent media cam
paign against homosexual rights, it is
understandable that gays would
want to launch a public relations
event of their own, but what is to be
gained by a blue jeans day?
The organizers of gay blue jeans
day would like to see society divided
into two groups. Gays would wear
jeans, and straights would not. Un
fortunately, the world is not so sim
ple.
There were at least eight distinct
groups within society on gay blue
jeans day: — straights who never
wear jeans, — straights who usually
wear jeans, but didn't for fear of os
tracism, — straights who wore jeans
because they hadn't heard that it was
national gay blue jeans day, —
straights who wore jeans because
they didn't care what day it was, —
gays who always wear jeans — gays
who don't normally wear jeans but
did because they had decided to
come out of the closet, — gays who
didn't wear jeans because they
feared coming out of the closet, and
— gays who didn't wear jeans be
cause they didn't care what day it was
and thought the whole thing was
silly.
So if one wore blue jeans on gay
blue jeans day it means he is gay, he
didn't know, or he doesn't care
("he" in the generic sense, of
course). This seems to prove no
thing!
From the poster blitz on campus I
note that Tuesday, May 16, is Stan
ford gay blue jeans day. Is this to
become a monthly event? This situa
tion reminds me of junior high
school.
Every Thursday was 'fairy day' (my
junior high school was not as sophis
ticated as Stanford; we referred to

homosexuals as "fairies' rather than
'gays'). If one wore green or yellow
on Thursday, he was immediately as
sumed to be a 'fairy' and ostracized
as such.
I had hoped that when I came to
Stanford I would encounter people
at an intellectual level above that of
my junior high school. I think that I
have, and I think that most people
will accept Stanford gay blue jeans
day as the joke that it is.

Misdirected boycott
This letter is directed to Janet
Funk, Curtis Whitson, Elfie Forbes,
Dave Swanson, and anyone else who
would boycott the Senior Pledge
Program to protest the trustees' posi
tion on South Africa proxy voting.
To begin with, the Senior Pledge
Program is not a vehicle of the trus
tees, administration, or the familiar
scapegoat, "the University." It is a
program conceived, designed, and
painstakingly executed by students
who are just as concerned about
Stanford's political actions as any
other group.
Second, Senior Pledge donations
are in no way associated with the en
dowment fund or other profit yield
ing plans. The donations are gener
ally restricted gifts; each donor may
choose to support whatever program
or cause he or she desires.
Most gifts end up as funding for IM
and club sports, student loans and
scholarships, special academic prog
rams, as wpII as other luxuries which
serve to make our time at Stanford a
pleasant experience. Are these the
targets you have so carefully chosen
as the best way to protest against the
trustees?
Third, the Senior Pledge Program
is only seeking gifts of $15 to $50
spread over a three year period. I
cannot understand why a boycott
employing mail to every senior and
use of United Campus Christian

Ministry funds would be wasted on
such a small scale project as Senior
Pledge.
If the issue of U.S. involvement in
South Africa is so important that you
will attack other harmless and unre
lated student programs to advance
your position, I would suggest that
you aim higher. Find an approach
which will have a real impact, or at
least make a strong statement with
out hurting your fellow students,
whose support you seek.
If I may make use of your letter to
the Daily, May 11, why not "interfere
with (Stanford's) high and holy pur
pose of turning out engineers, doc
tors, and teachers" by refusing to
graduate?
