# Make Mom happier!
## 
### 
Tired of hearing about nothing but divestment? Bored of
accusations that you're an apathetic electorate? So are we! We
would love to read and publish something interesting, fresh,
and provocative . . . even something that makes cornflakes
curl.
How about a touching article on the sexual frustrations of
attending grad school? or a hearty discussion of the effects of
the "Saturday Night Fever" epidemic on college culture? or a
refutation of the claims that ours is the "Me, Me, Me" genera
tion? or even a thoughtful treatment of the demise of the
Church in a post-Christian era?
Finally, how can you resist the incomparable opportunity to
see your name aggrandized on page 2 of one of the world's
foremost college newpapers?
Edify us with your opinion. All we ask for is double-spaced
typing, a 57-space line, and be concise. Simply bring it into the
Daily office (across from the new Terman engineering build
ing), or mail it to: Opinions, The Stanford Daily, Storke Student
Publications Building, Stanford, CA 94305.
If nothing else, you'll make Mom happier by including some
thing worthwhile in your next financial request letter.
