# RAs need humor, 'sense of the absurd'
## 
### 
How can I cope with my mother? What courses
should I take? I can't stand my roommate, will you
talk to him? Where can I get some good dope?
Beleaguered by an endless onslaught of ques
tions concerning many aspects of daily life, lies the
omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient Resident
Assistant.
How do RAs get to assume their position? And
what's it really like to be an RA?
Prospective RAs must first obtain application
forms from the Office of Residential Education.
The application process includes writing an essay
describing what they, as RAs, expect to gain from
and contribute to the community. Applicants must
also procure two recommendations.
They are then granted a first-round interview by
their resident fellows and several staff members.

About two-thirds of the original contenders pro
ceed into the applicant-pool, where potential RAs
attend group meetings and sign name lists at
specific residences. Round-two interviews are
granted and then resident fellows work out among
themselves who gets whom.
Because personalities are difficult to measure,
much less to set down on paper, the process of RA
selection is subjective, trying, and well, "some
times it works and sometimes it doesn't," said
David Carlson, an RA in Alondra.
Mark Mancall, resident fellow at Florence
Moore, said resident fellows look for a well
rounded number of men and women.
He said he appreciates honesty in the applica
tion process, imagination, a sense of humor and a
"sense of the absurd."

Carlson and Paloma RA Jeff Stone said they
agree that open-mindedness and availability are
desirable qualities, along with, as Carlson said,
"being subtle in personality and opinion."
Carlson defined his role as being able to per
ceive when to interfere and being flexible so as to
change with the students in his house.
Stone said he sees his role as that of a "horizon
broadener."
When questioned as to his motives forassumirig
the position of RA, Carlson said the job comes
naturally, because "being an RA is an extension of
being myself."
Another RA, who requested anonymity, re
mareked he did it for the money — between $1300
and $1770 a year(oneßAcalculated his earnings at
87 cents an hour), and the easy access to sex.
