Tomorrow is Cay Freedom Day at
Stanford. This day will include a con
cert of gay feminist music on theTre
sidder Patio and a speech by Sally
Cearheartin Kresge Auditorium. Cay
women and men will bewearing blue
jeans all day.
Why are we irritating people and
calling attention to ourselves when
we could soft-pedal our gayness and
pass for "straight?"
We want our gay friends to know
that they are not alone. We'd like
everyone to realize that we are many,
we are everywhere, and we are
people they know and respect. And
we want the chance to say we're gay
and proud.
For our struggle for freedom be
gins as a struggle for self-respect. As
gay people, like all other oppresssed
minorities, we have had it drummed
into our heads that we are inferior.
We have been told that what we are
is so abhorrent that if we admit it
openly we will be trampled on.
Every gay person must decide
whether to be honest about who he
or she is. The ability to make this
choice is a key distinction between
the oppression we face and the op
pression of other minority groups.
A black woman has no choice
about whether to disclose her sex or
the color of her skin to the rest of the
world. She has no escape from dis
crimination based on these visible
characteristics.
Some gay people have escaped
society's most heavy-handed perse
cutions, but only through leading
lives of secrecy and deceit. The only
way most lesbians and gay men could
ever keep their jobs, families and
friends has been by denying who
they are and trading away their self
respect.
Those of us who struggle today for
gay liberation have read these rules,
and we refuse to play the game.
Torn by self-hatred
We refuse because we will no
longer allow society to label as ugly
what we know to be beautiful. We
refuse because we have seen too
many of our sisters and brothers torn
apart by the fear, guilt, and self
hatred that society's oppression im
poses. And we refuse because we
see that our invisibility is what ena
bles the oppression to continue.
Invisibility has kept us alone and

alienated from each other, and is the
reason why far too many of us have
accepted the lies that society has told
us about ourselves. Too often we
have had no one to turn to to help us
find the truth.
We have not even been able to rely
on our families as a source of positive
role models, self-respect, and pride
in our heritage. Each of our lives is a
struggle, both personal and political,
to recapture the dignity that society
denies us.
So we now fight for our civil rights.
We demand the right to be open,
honest, and proud of who we are
without fear of losing our jobs, our
homes and our children. Those are
the weapons used to keep us hidden.
Yet Americans seem willing to in
validate the Constitution for ten per
cent of the population. Why are gay
people denied even the token pro
tection from discrimination that has
been accorded other minority
groups? Why is society so insistent
on keeping us in the closet?
Straights run the slow
Our society promotes one formula
for happiness: one man, one wife,
three kids, two cars, and a home in
the suburbs. To be admitted into the
system people must deny their true
selves and accept the values of the
straight white men who run the
show.
For gay people, not even token ac
ceptance is possible. For the very act
of our being open implies a rejection
of heterosexual values.
Our society is built around one ac
ceptable form of sexual expression.
But lesbians and gay men de
monstrate that it is possible for
people to achieve fulfilling, satisfy
ing relationships with others of the
same sex.
America keeps us in the closet be
cause we raise disquieting alterna
tives.
Lesbians and gay men threaten the
traditional sex-role stereotypes. Two
women or men living together, even
with two cars, a dishwasher, and a
split-level home, still can't be fitted
into the expected division of roles
and labor.
Women learn they don't need
someone to be dependent on. They
learn to value other women. Men
learn to love without dominating or
competing, learning that they can be

equals and still be men.
Society wants to keep us in the
closet because our openness could
not help but shatter the roles that are
used to keep everyone in line.
So we want more than our basic
human rights. We want to remove
the sexism that is at the root of our
oppression. For only with the end of
male supremacy will gays, women

and racial minorities achieve real lib
eration.
We are proud. We are angry. We
are revolutionary. Our struggle for
gay liberation will change America.
