# Do professors hate business?

Hostility between the "Academy"
and the business world is one of the
standard cliches of modern sociol
ogy. Thanks to popularizations of
Joseph Schumpeter and others,
people in industry and commerce
have the strong impression that their
problems with over-regulation, en
vironmentalism and public relations
can be traced to a "New Class" of
professionals, intellectuals and other
"knowledge worke r s." So some re
taliate with blanket condemnations
of the "professors."
There's much truth in all this, to be
sure, but new evidence suggests that
these business broadsides are far too
simple-minded. A major faculty opin
ion survey conducted by Professors
Everett C. Ladd Jr. and Seymore Mar
tin Lipset has turned up a surprising
degree of pro-business, pro-free en
terprise sentiment.
According to findings published in
the Jan. 16 Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation, more than four out of five pro
fessors of the 4200 polled agree with
the statement that "the private busi
ness system in the U.S., for all its
flaws, works better than any other
system devised for advanced indust
rial society." More than two-thirds
agree that "the growth of govern
ment in the U.S. now poses a threat
to the freedom and opportunity for
individual initiative of the citizenry."
More than 50 per cent agree that
"economic growth, not redistribu
tion, should be the primary objective
of American economic policy."
These results carried over to sev
eral familiar opinion survey ques
tions. On the confidence scales fa
vored by the Harris Poll, people run-

ning banks and financial institutions
placed second, after "the scientific
community." On positive or nega
tive ratings for "aspects of American
society," the "private business sys
tem" came out well ahead, eliciting a
favorable response from 67 per cent
of the professors. The leaders of
"major companies" didn't do so
well, receiving slightly more negative
than positive responses. But they
fared much better than leaders of
"organized labor," who were liked
by only only 20 per cent of the sam
ple.
Some of the surprise can be
explained by the tremendous differ
ences in outlook among different
academic fields. The Ladd-Lipset
survey has consistently found that
professors in the social sciences and
humanities are much more "liberal"
than the general population,and
those in law, business and agricul
ture are much more conservative.
True to form, corporate executives
had the confidence of only a third of
the first group but more than two
thirds of the second.
Still, the overall results are much
more favorable to free enterprise
than our social theories would pre
dict. It seems that businessmen are
off the mark in trying to make higher
education the main scapegoat for
their woes. The evidence suggests
that we declare a moratorium on
sweeping rhetoric. The "New Class,"
we think, is still something to worry
about, but it won't be understood
through over-drawn generalizations.
