# Sierra Camp brings alumni together
## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
Five hours from the Stanford
campus lies Fallen Leaf Lake
and the Stanford Sierra Camp.
Owned and operated by the
Stanford Alumni Association,
the camp is designed "to serve
alumni, faculty, staff and their
families and friends," accord
ing to Larry Bascom, this year's
camp staff director.
The camp operates weekly
sessions of children's prog
rams, waterskiing, boating,
arts and crafts and tennis.
Families usually stay for one
week, arriving Saturday after
noon and leaving the following
Saturday morning, said Bas
com. This leaves time for staff
members to clean guest ca
bins.
Guests can stay longer than
one week but "the programs
are based around a one-week
schedule," Bascom said. Many
families reserve the same week
each year to reunite with
friends, he added.
For them, camp becomes a
family tradition, said Phil Var
gas, a returning staffer and in
terviewer for this summer's
positions.
All camp guests must belong
to the Stanford Alumni Associ
ation and must pay the $18 an
nual membership dues.
Guest accommodations
range in price from $180 per
person, per week fora "rustic"
cabin, to $1350 per family, per
week for a "modern" cabin.
This price includes rneals and
all activities. Boat rentals,
waterskiing, horseback riding,
fishing licenses, special
babysitting, "rustic" cabin li
nens, sales tax and staff
gratuities are additional.
Current Stanford students
make up the camp's staff.

Staff members must work in
all areas of the camp, from of
fice personnel to children's
counselor, he said. Vargas
added that "every staffer not
only does his own program,
but also does cleaning, hash
ing, etc."
Staff salaries are $80 per
week, plus room, board and
staff gratuities. "You're not
going to make money — it's
not a money-making job. You
go to be outdoors, to be
among Stanford students
without the academic pres
sures, and to serve as a liaison
between alumni and Stanford
as you know it now," he said.
To become staff members,
students go through a "very
competitive" application pro
cess, said Vargas.
Applications are available in
the fall and must be turned in
by winter quarter, when inter
views take place.
This year there were less
applicants than usual, Bascom
noted. He accounts for this de
crease because the job has a
reputation of being hard to get
and also because more stu
dents are interested in having
summer jobs pertaining to
their careers.
The 34 staff positions were
chosen from an applicant pool
of 80 new people and 20 former
staffers. Bascom said that "not
all the old staffers were re
hired. These positions are not
impossible to get, and once
you're there, you're not there
forever. It's a fairly equitable
process."
Vargas said it is fairly difficult
to get a job. He estimated that
from the 200 applications
which were initially picked up,
about 125 were returned and 34
positions were filled.

He said that returning staff
have priority. "There is rarely
any objection to anyone com
ing back. It's the most difficult
for freshmen to get hired," he
added.
Normally the staff director is
a returning staffer of several
years as well as a Stanford stu
dent. This year, however, Bas
com, a Stanford graduate of
1975, was selected for the job.
"Since the staff director pos
ition has more and more re
sponsibility involved, it be
came impossible to be a stu
dent and the staff director this
year," said Bascom who cur
rently works for the Alumni As
sociation.
Staff members must stay in
"rustic" cabins with a room
mate. Returning staffers are

usually paired with new staf
fers.
Staff gratuities, also known
as "wampum," replace tips at
the camp. At the end of the
week guests are requested to
contribute to the "wampum"
and the money received is then
divided equally among the
staff. This alleviates tipping and
provides staffers with an addi
tional $20 to $50 per week, said
Vargas.
The site is in use all summer
for camp sessions. Confer
ences are held there from
mid-April until June and from
the end of summer through
November.
Camp Director Frank Hil
dreth said that winter use is a
future possibility.


Some guests read books on the waterfront of Fallen Leaf Lake, the site of Stanford Sierra Camp.

for freshmen to get hired," he
added.
Normally the staff director is
a returning staffer of several
years as well as a Stanford stu
dent. This year, however, Bas
com, a Stanford graduate of
1975, was selected for the job.
"Since the staff director pos
ition has more and more re
sponsibility involved, it be
came impossible to be a stu
dent and the staff director this
year," said Bascom who cur
rently works for the Alumni As
sociation.
Staff members must stay in
"rustic" cabins with a room
mate. Returning staffers are

usually paired with new staf
fers.
Staff gratuities, also known
as "wampum," replace tips at
the camp. At the end of the
week guests are requested to
contribute to the "wampum"
and the money received is then
divided equally among the
staff. This alleviates tipping and
provides staffers with an addi
tional $20 to $50 per week, said
Vargas.
The site is in use all summer
for camp sessions. Confer
ences are held there from
mid-April until June and from
the end of summer through
November.
Camp Director Frank Hil
dreth said that winter use is a
future possibility.


Some guests read books on the waterfront of Fallen Leaf Lake, the site of Stanford Sierra Camp.
Five hours from the Stanford
campus lies Fallen Leaf Lake
and the Stanford Sierra Camp.
Owned and operated by the
Stanford Alumni Association,
the camp is designed "to serve
alumni, faculty, staff and their
families and friends," accord
ing to Larry Bascom, this year's
camp staff director.
The camp operates weekly
sessions of children's prog
rams, waterskiing, boating,
arts and crafts and tennis.
Families usually stay for one
week, arriving Saturday after
noon and leaving the following
Saturday morning, said Bas
com. This leaves time for staff
members to clean guest ca
bins.
Guests can stay longer than
one week but "the programs
are based around a one-week
schedule," Bascom said. Many
families reserve the same week
each year to reunite with
friends, he added.
For them, camp becomes a
family tradition, said Phil Var
gas, a returning staffer and in
terviewer for this summer's
positions.
All camp guests must belong
to the Stanford Alumni Associ
ation and must pay the $18 an
nual membership dues.
Guest accommodations
range in price from $180 per
person, per week fora "rustic"
cabin, to $1350 per family, per
week for a "modern" cabin.
This price includes rneals and
all activities. Boat rentals,
waterskiing, horseback riding,
fishing licenses, special
babysitting, "rustic" cabin li
nens, sales tax and staff
gratuities are additional.
Current Stanford students
make up the camp's staff.

Staff members must work in
all areas of the camp, from of
fice personnel to children's
counselor, he said. Vargas
added that "every staffer not
only does his own program,
but also does cleaning, hash
ing, etc."
Staff salaries are $80 per
week, plus room, board and
staff gratuities. "You're not
going to make money — it's
not a money-making job. You
go to be outdoors, to be
among Stanford students
without the academic pres
sures, and to serve as a liaison
between alumni and Stanford
as you know it now," he said.
To become staff members,
students go through a "very
competitive" application pro
cess, said Vargas.
Applications are available in
the fall and must be turned in
by winter quarter, when inter
views take place.
This year there were less
applicants than usual, Bascom
noted. He accounts for this de
crease because the job has a
reputation of being hard to get
and also because more stu
dents are interested in having
summer jobs pertaining to
their careers.
The 34 staff positions were
chosen from an applicant pool
of 80 new people and 20 former
staffers. Bascom said that "not
all the old staffers were re
hired. These positions are not
impossible to get, and once
you're there, you're not there
forever. It's a fairly equitable
process."
Vargas said it is fairly difficult
to get a job. He estimated that
from the 200 applications
which were initially picked up,
about 125 were returned and 34
positions were filled.

He said that returning staff
have priority. "There is rarely
any objection to anyone com
ing back. It's the most difficult
for freshmen to get hired," he
added.
