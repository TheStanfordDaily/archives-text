## 'Rocky Horror' smashing success Antici............... 
### Mary Anderson 
. . . pation.
My deepest sympathies to
anyone who missed "The
Rocky Horror Show" at Toyon
last weekend. The production
experienced occasional lapses
in sound and smoothness, but
"Rocky," a transsexual science
fiction rock musical, was im
pressive and fun for the stand
ing room only crowds.
The long opening night lines
established the performance
as one of the year's major cam
pus events. Because of the
overwhelming demand, an
extra midnight performance
was scheduled on Friday.
Rick Jimenez starred as the
bizarre Dr. Frank-n-Furter, an
alien from the planet Trans
sexual in the galaxy of Transyl
vania. He sets up his own fan
tasy world on Earth, his motto
being, "Don't dream it — be
it." He lives for "absolute plea
sure," thwarting any
semblance of the moral order

dictated by society.
The action occurs during
one adventurous night in the
lives of super-straight Brad
Majors and his virginal fiance,
Janet Weiss. Naturally, their
car breaks down in the middle
of nowhere on a dark, stormy
night, and they ask for help at
Frank-n-Furter's foreboding
mansion.
Trans vestites
Kinky Frank introduces him
self: "Don't get strung out by
the way I look. Don't judge a
book by its cover. I'm not
much of a man by the light of
day, but by night I'm one hell
of a lover. I'm just a sweet
transvestite, from Transsexual,
Transylvania. . .
So begins a generally freaky
evening for Brad and Janet.
They are "lucky" to arrive on
a special night, when Frank will
bring his creation (and pros
pective lover) to life — a blond,
tanned athlete named Rocky

Horror.
Frank's lifestyle, however,
becomes too extreme. He be
gins to dispose of anyone who
ceases to entertain him. In
"Rose Tints My World," Frank
and his companions realize
that their pleasure lives only
masktheirpainand loneliness.
Frank's servants, Riff Raff
and Magenta, turn against him,
since his mission has failed to
resolve the dilemma between
repressive social order and the
"liberating" pursuit of plea
sure. They destroy him before
leaving for their long-awaited
return to Transylvania.
Casting excellent
Overall, the casting was ex
cellent. Rick Jimenez, as
Frank-n-Furter, filled the role
that Tim Curry made famous
on stage and screen. Jimenez'
voice and facial expressions
were remarkably like Curry's,
although his body movements
were relatively tame.
Ann Jennings (playing Janet
Weiss) was well-matched with
Mike Vilkin (Brad Majors).
They both sang well and had
the appropriate vocal inflec
tions for the naive young
couple from small town De
nton. Jennings, however, was
too inhibited in scenes where
she had to convince the audi
ence she really "wanted to be
dirty."
Roy Holliday as Riff Raff and
Risa Shimoda as his sister,
Magenta, also made a good
pair. Both were vigorous and
sensual dancers. Holliday
achieved the entertaining and
cynical dementia of Riff Raff;
Shimoda's somber sensuality
fit the proper (or improper)
image for Magenta.
Innovative
Special commendations
should go to Tony Peet, who
was superb as the Narrator.
Toyon was innovative with this
character; the originally sedate
intellectual gradually suc
cumbs to the nutty decadence
of the very story he chronicles.
He emphasizes the loss of con
trol that, underthe right condi
tions, is latent in us all.
Steve Messner played a good
Rocky Horror. He should have
emerged, however, into more
blatant sexuality in his tryst
with Janet. As it was, he could
not be convincing by the time
he declared, "my libido hasn't
been controlled."
Brock Fisher worked well as
rock'n'roll tough, Eddie, dis
playing much more appeal
than did Meatloaf, who acted
the part in both stage and film
productions.
Opening night nerves,

though, seemed to be to blame
for Laurie Siperstein's rela
tively weak opening and clos
ing renditions of "Science Fic
tion — Double Feature." Her
voice was unsure, and her ap
parent discomfort detracted
from the vitality needed for the
part.
Time-Warpers
The singing and dancing
Time-Warpers, Frank-n-
Furter's bizarre houseguests,
were fun and energetic. The
chorus, likewise, did a great
job on backup vocals.
The band was tight, although
hindered by occasional sound
difficulties and by moments
when the lead voices did not
quite synch with the instru
ments. The music is demand
ing, especially in a small thea
ter situation, and the band
made "The Rocky Horror
Show" a vibrant musical.
Makeup, costumes and
choreography were also very
effective.
A few weaknesses, however,
affected the show. Most of the
singers were weak at one time
or another. The words were
frequently unclear to those
who did not already know
them by heart. And I still won
der why Frank's farewell song,
"I'm Going Home," was omit
ted, since it is significant to his
characterization.
Though "Rocky" took well to
the Toyon stage, its production
relied heavily on the movie
version, since few had previ
ously seen it on stage. One im
pressive yet ineffective touch,
taken from the movie, was the
use of a video machine for one
segment. Members of the au
dience who had not seen the
movie could not discern the
video images.
Elaborate sets
The sets were definitely
more elaborate than other
stage versions of "The Rocky
Horror Show," even the origi
nal. Russ Winslow and his col
laborators on the sets are to be
congratulated.
Sets surrounding the audi
ence at different levels greatly
facilitated the fast pace, indeed
frenzy, that "The Rocky Horror
Show" requires.
Producer Doug Greenfield
and Director Marvin Diogenes,
as well as the rest of the cast
and crew, merited the crowds'
standing ovations for one of
the outstanding dorm presen
tations at Stanford.
If you missed it, well, you
can wait in antici. . . pation for
the movie.

Show" a vibrant musical.
Makeup, costumes and
choreography were also very
effective.
A few weaknesses, however,
affected the show. Most of the
singers were weak at one time
or another. The words were
frequently unclear to those
who did not already know
them by heart. And I still won
der why Frank's farewell song,
"I'm Going Home," was omit
ted, since it is significant to his
characterization.
Though "Rocky" took well to
the Toyon stage, its production
relied heavily on the movie
version, since few had previ
ously seen it on stage. One im
pressive yet ineffective touch,
taken from the movie, was the
use of a video machine for one
segment. Members of the au
dience who had not seen the
movie could not discern the
video images.
Elaborate sets
The sets were definitely
more elaborate than other
stage versions of "The Rocky
Horror Show," even the origi
nal. Russ Winslow and his col
laborators on the sets are to be
congratulated.
Sets surrounding the audi
ence at different levels greatly
facilitated the fast pace, indeed
frenzy, that "The Rocky Horror
Show" requires.
Producer Doug Greenfield
and Director Marvin Diogenes,
as well as the rest of the cast
and crew, merited the crowds'
standing ovations for one of
the outstanding dorm presen

Transsexuals from Transylvania prepare to do the time-warp before a standing room only crowd in
Toyon Lounge. Toyon's production of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" was estimated to have been one
of the most popular dorm productions in recent years.
. . . pation.
My deepest sympathies to
anyone who missed "The
Rocky Horror Show" at Toyon
last weekend. The production
experienced occasional lapses
in sound and smoothness, but
"Rocky," a transsexual science
fiction rock musical, was im
pressive and fun for the stand
ing room only crowds.
The long opening night lines
established the performance
as one of the year's major cam
pus events. Because of the
overwhelming demand, an
extra midnight performance
was scheduled on Friday.
Rick Jimenez starred as the
bizarre Dr. Frank-n-Furter, an
alien from the planet Trans
sexual in the galaxy of Transyl
vania. He sets up his own fan
tasy world on Earth, his motto
being, "Don't dream it — be
it." He lives for "absolute plea
sure," thwarting any
semblance of the moral order

dictated by society.
The action occurs during
one adventurous night in the
lives of super-straight Brad
Majors and his virginal fiance,
Janet Weiss. Naturally, their
car breaks down in the middle
of nowhere on a dark, stormy
night, and they ask for help at
Frank-n-Furter's foreboding
mansion.
Trans vestites
Kinky Frank introduces him
self: "Don't get strung out by
the way I look. Don't judge a
book by its cover. I'm not
much of a man by the light of
day, but by night I'm one hell
of a lover. I'm just a sweet
transvestite, from Transsexual,
Transylvania. . .
So begins a generally freaky
evening for Brad and Janet.
They are "lucky" to arrive on
a special night, when Frank will
bring his creation (and pros
pective lover) to life — a blond,
tanned athlete named Rocky

Horror.
Frank's lifestyle, however,
becomes too extreme. He be
gins to dispose of anyone who
ceases to entertain him. In
"Rose Tints My World," Frank
and his companions realize
that their pleasure lives only
masktheirpainand loneliness.
Frank's servants, Riff Raff
and Magenta, turn against him,
since his mission has failed to
resolve the dilemma between
repressive social order and the
"liberating" pursuit of plea
sure. They destroy him before
leaving for their long-awaited
return to Transylvania.
Casting excellent
Overall, the casting was ex
cellent. Rick Jimenez, as
Frank-n-Furter, filled the role
that Tim Curry made famous
on stage and screen. Jimenez'
voice and facial expressions
were remarkably like Curry's,
although his body movements
were relatively tame.
Ann Jennings (playing Janet
Weiss) was well-matched with
Mike Vilkin (Brad Majors).
They both sang well and had
the appropriate vocal inflec
tions for the naive young
couple from small town De
nton. Jennings, however, was
too inhibited in scenes where
she had to convince the audi
ence she really "wanted to be
dirty."
Roy Holliday as Riff Raff and
Risa Shimoda as his sister,
Magenta, also made a good
pair. Both were vigorous and
sensual dancers. Holliday
achieved the entertaining and
cynical dementia of Riff Raff;
Shimoda's somber sensuality
fit the proper (or improper)
image for Magenta.
Innovative
Special commendations
should go to Tony Peet, who
was superb as the Narrator.
Toyon was innovative with this
character; the originally sedate
intellectual gradually suc
cumbs to the nutty decadence
of the very story he chronicles.
He emphasizes the loss of con
trol that, underthe right condi
tions, is latent in us all.
Steve Messner played a good
Rocky Horror. He should have
emerged, however, into more
blatant sexuality in his tryst
with Janet. As it was, he could
not be convincing by the time
he declared, "my libido hasn't
been controlled."
Brock Fisher worked well as
rock'n'roll tough, Eddie, dis
playing much more appeal
than did Meatloaf, who acted
the part in both stage and film
productions.
Opening night nerves,

though, seemed to be to blame
for Laurie Siperstein's rela
tively weak opening and clos
ing renditions of "Science Fic
tion — Double Feature." Her
voice was unsure, and her ap
parent discomfort detracted
from the vitality needed for the
part.
Time-Warpers
The singing and dancing
Time-Warpers, Frank-n-
Furter's bizarre houseguests,
were fun and energetic. The
chorus, likewise, did a great
job on backup vocals.
The band was tight, although
hindered by occasional sound
difficulties and by moments
when the lead voices did not
quite synch with the instru
ments. The music is demand
ing, especially in a small thea
ter situation, and the band
made "The Rocky Horror
Show" a vibrant musical.
Makeup, costumes and
choreography were also very
effective.

achieved the entertaining and
cynical dementia of Riff Raff;
Shimoda's somber sensuality
fit the proper (or improper)
image for Magenta.
Innovative
Special commendations
should go to Tony Peet, who
was superb as the Narrator.
Toyon was innovative with this
character; the originally sedate
intellectual gradually suc
cumbs to the nutty decadence
of the very story he chronicles.
He emphasizes the loss of con
trol that, underthe right condi
tions, is latent in us all.
Steve Messner played a good
Rocky Horror. He should have
emerged, however, into more
blatant sexuality in his tryst
with Janet. As it was, he could
not be convincing by the time
he declared, "my libido hasn't
been controlled."
Brock Fisher worked well as
rock'n'roll tough, Eddie, dis
playing much more appeal
than did Meatloaf, who acted
the part in both stage and film
productions.
Opening night nerves,

though, seemed to be to blame
for Laurie Siperstein's rela
tively weak opening and clos
ing renditions of "Science Fic
tion — Double Feature." Her
voice was unsure, and her ap
parent discomfort detracted
from the vitality needed for the
part.
Time-Warpers
The singing and dancing
Time-Warpers, Frank-n-
Furter's bizarre houseguests,
were fun and energetic. The
chorus, likewise, did a great
job on backup vocals.
The band was tight, although
hindered by occasional sound
difficulties and by moments
when the lead voices did not
quite synch with the instru
ments. The music is demand
ing, especially in a small thea
ter situation, and the band
made "The Rocky Horror
Show" a vibrant musical.
Makeup, costumes and
choreography were also very
effective.
A few weaknesses, however,
affected the show. Most of the
singers were weak at one time
or another. The words were
frequently unclear to those
who did not already know
them by heart. And I still won
der why Frank's farewell song,
"I'm Going Home," was omit
ted, since it is significant to his
characterization.
Though "Rocky" took well to
the Toyon stage, its production
relied heavily on the movie
version, since few had previ
ously seen it on stage. One im
pressive yet ineffective touch,
taken from the movie, was the
use of a video machine for one
segment. Members of the au
dience who had not seen the
movie could not discern the
video images.
Elaborate sets
The sets were definitely
more elaborate than other
stage versions of "The Rocky
Horror Show," even the origi
nal. Russ Winslow and his col
laborators on the sets are to be
congratulated.
Sets surrounding the audi
ence at different levels greatly
facilitated the fast pace, indeed
frenzy, that "The Rocky Horror
Show" requires.
Producer Doug Greenfield
and Director Marvin Diogenes,
as well as the rest of the cast
and crew, merited the crowds'
standing ovations for one of
the outstanding dorm presen
tations at Stanford.
If you missed it, well, you
can wait in antici. . . pation for
the movie.

Transsexuals from Transylvania prepare to do the time-warp before a standing room only crowd in
Toyon Lounge. Toyon's production of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" was estimated to have been one
of the most popular dorm productions in recent years.
