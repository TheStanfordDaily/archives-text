# Humiliation, shame depicted in Dern role
## 
### Ron Lillejord 
Bruce Dern is a very good,
yet mostly unknown, actor. He
was the best thing in a notable
list of failures: "Silent Run
ning," "The Great Gatsby" and
"Black Sunday."
In "Coming Home," his new
film, Dern plays a Marine
Corps captain whose experi
ence in Vietnam and the shock
of his wife's affair with another
man drive him to suicide.
While enthused about the
movie, Dern is disappointed
about the definition of his
character in the film.
"My character," he said in
an interview last week, "is the
least defined of all, and the film

shows that at times. There was
very little I could do about it."
In early December of 1976,
Dern was hired, "with a lot of
promises that we were going to
get down to my part when the
time came, and solve the prob
lems inherent and enormous
in my character," he said.
"They started shooting the
first week in )anuary, knowing
that if they didn't start then,
United Artists might never
make the picture. So they
began without a final script."
When Dern joined filming in
mid-February, his questions —
"where we were going with the
character, what the character
was going to say, and what the
movie was really about" —
werp still there.
He said "it was almost a day
to-day struggle" for him to re
solve these difficulties.
And Dern wasn't entirely
successful. Audiences, he
feels, "are confused as to why
I'm getting a medal. Also, I
think they're confused, and I
really don't know why, as to
why I am a suicide at the end. If
they wonder why I behave like
I do, I can only tell them to ask
anybody who served in that
war.
"In the original script, I took
prisoners at the end and was
killed by a SWAT Well,
we'd all seen 'Black Sunday,'
hadn't we? There was no way
that plot could be.

"It wasn't really fair for him
to come home, take hostages,
and then be killed. It's too
easy. There was no question in
my mind that my character
couldn't die a violerlt death,
nor could he take other
people's lives.
"Nothing drives Vietnam
War vets nuts quicker than the
fact that that's the only image
anybody ever sees: the dis
turbed guy comes home and
shoots up someplace."
Dern spoke of his character
in the movie in terms of the
Marine Corps mentality: "A
Marine is a trained warrior.
There is no Marine Academy in
this country. It's very simple

why. You can't train a man to
kill in a classroom.
"You spend 10 or 12 years
waiting to finally get your
chance to prove yourself — in
that whole locker room type of
esprit de corps, 'the elite sol
dier' and everything — and
then you are sent to a war such
as Vietnam, it turns out that in
stead of being offensive and
taking charge, you are in a
holding action, fighting
women and children.
"You're not actually fighting
them, but that's all you see. Or
you're burning cities and vil
lages. That's not what these
guys are trained to do; these
guys are trained to raise the
flag at Iwo Jima. That's what
their whole image is.
"For the M&rine, Vietnam
was the most frustrating ex
perience he could possibly
have. That's the basis for my
character. Self-degradation,
humiliation, shame ... all the
negatives. That's why it was the
hardest role I ever had to play,
simply because I dealt with no
thing but negatives every
single day."
To prepare for the part,
Dern "just got depressed. I
started thinking about how
tough it is in my life, in my
career."
Dern's career has indeed
been a struggle. Although he's
had a number of near misses,
Dern has never really been in

the film that could make him a
major star.
"Coming Home" is also not
likely to be that film. Even
though the movie is doing
very well, most of the public
ity is going to its other two
stars, Jane Fonda and jon Voi
ght.
Dern is hoping that two pro
jects coming up will provide
this thus-far elusive step
pingstone to stardom. One is a
movie called "The Driver,"
which will be released in July,
and the other is a play about
Sinclair Lewis and Dorothy
Thompson. Dern terms the
Lewis role as "perhaps the best
I'll ever get in my life."The play
will open on Broadway this fall.
