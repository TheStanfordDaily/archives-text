The Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP)
receives money indirectly from
nearly all students through ASSU
Program Fees, and the ASSU Publica
tions Board, Mike Veiluva of SCRIP
said.
Veiluva, who described his posi
tion at SCRIP as "minister of fi
nance," said the Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC), which receives
money from student fee assess
ments, has given funds to SCRIP.
Against The Grain, the ARC news
paper, has not been published this
quarter because it used the money to
pay half of the printing costs of

SCRIP-published leaflets, Veiluva
said.
Each set of 3000 leaflets costs $100
to print, he added.
While SCRIP did not receive prog
ram fees this year, it should get $800
next year from fee assessments, Vei
luva said. He added he will recom
mend that this money be used, in
conjunction with money from such
organizations as the Black Students
Union and the Asian American Stu
dents Organization, to buy a public
address system.
A used public address system
would cost about $1200, and used
bullhorns run at $75 apiece, he said.
SCRIP has been renting them for $20

a day, he added.
During April and May of 1977 and
1978, SCRIP spent an average of $200
a week, Veiluva said. He added, "The
greater the level of militancy, the
more expensive it is."
HeestimatedthatSCßlPwould use
$300 to $400 during the rest of the
quarter.
Veiluva said SCRIP "usually runs a
deficit ... we buy something now,
get funds later; our credit is good."
SCRIP'S budget runs in cycles. Vei
luva said it has gone as far as $700 in
debt; now it is only $100 in the red.
/'Last quarter we were hit up by
collection agencies," he said.
Although he is minister of finance,

Veiluva has little say ir. how the
money will be spent — or how much.
"No one at SCRIP has veto power,"
he said.
SCRIP gets its money from dona
tions, not dues. Donations are taken
at rallies and through a mailing list.
Although no membership dues are
required, Veiluva said SCRIP is "ex
pensive to belong to . . . members
may put in $20."
Recent graduates who were politi
cally active also contribute. "The
largest donation — $200 — was from
an alumnus," he added. Veiluva
would not give names of con
tributors.
More than a dozen unnamed fa
culty members, over half of whom
are tenured, have contributed $5 to
$15, said Veiluva. He said he consid
ers any amount over $10 large. Stu
dents usually contribute much less,
he added.
"We have received nothing from
Moscow or Peking," Veiluva said.
Veiluva said SCRIP has an ASSU
student organizing fund account.
The fund is a banking service for stu
dent organizations, projects and
dorms.
The account's books are closed to
the public. Veiluva would not let
them be examined "because of cer
tain controversial items and certain
names."
