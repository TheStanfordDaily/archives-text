## Amateurs try musical talent at Coffee House 'Open Mike' 
### Anne Bowden 
The group of friends sitting on the steps below the small stage
laugh their encouragement to the guitarist. Studying students
look up from their books and listen to what may be an undisco
vered talent. It's Thursday night at the Coffee House and the
"Open Mike" is on.
"I think of the Coffee House as a space for people to use," said
Coffee House manager Heidi Grose.
Occurring during the first and third Thursdays of the month
from 8:30 to 11 p.m., "Open Mike" is a chance for groups or
soloists to perform in a "relaxed, personal atmosphere. The per
formers are usually just starting and need some feedback," Grose
added. They need not be University students.
Susan Spinrad, a sophomore human biology major who sings
and plays guitar, was signed up by a friend to perform at an
"Open Mike" session.
"Instead of practicing to walls, I got a chance to play for
people," she said. She stressed the importance of learning how
to interact with a crowd and of developing stage presence.
Friends also encouraged singing and guitar-playing Doug
McMillan to perform at an "Open Mike" session.
Receptive
"I like playing if it provides some enjoyment for people," he
said. "The crowd at the Coffee House was very receptive. They
listened quietly and clapped after every song."
"Open Mike" was McMillan's first time in front of a strange
audience. Although one of his original songs has a copyright,
McMillan says his interest in music is strictly on the hobby level.
Spinrad, however, has performed professionally, traveling with a
madrigal repertoire group in the Los Angeles area. She is consid
ering a music career.
"I was really impressed with how smoothly the 'Open Mike'
was run," Spinrad said. She added the sound system was good
but more importantly, "Open Mike" wasn't "made into anything
bigger than it was meant to be."
The people who performed were doing it for a hobby, "not for
money. They had no ulterior motives other than for their own and
others' enjoyment," Spinrad said.
"I wanted to find out how people besides my friends liked my
music," McMillan said. "People were smiling when I finished,
and that made any nervousness I ever had worth it."

'The only pressure is self-inflicted," Grose agreed. "We provide
a person to run the sound system. All you need to do is get on the
stage, adjust the mikes and perform."
Interested amateur performers need to register at the Coffee
House about a week ahead of the performance date.
No auditions are necessary.
Friday night entertainment for the Coffee House started in
1975. "It was originally geared for amateur groups, but evolved
into a time for quality performances," Crose said. "Open Mike"
sessions during the first and third Thursday nights of each month
began winter quarter of this year.
Fridays for pros
Friday nights are now reserved for professional groups. "There
is usually at least one group per 'Open Mike' worthy of perform
ing on Friday nights," Grose said. If the group has enough mate
rial, they are invited back for Friday and are paid, she said.
In order to make the atmosphere more low-key "many of the
Thursday night musicians bring their own cheering group,"
Grose added. "Thursday nights become fun time for everyone
here."
The Coffee House will soon begin a Sunday Night Storytelling
and Poetry Reading time. It is designed for anyone interested in
non-musical performing, Grose said.
"I'm excited about the idea. It will provide a quiet evening's
entertainment," she added. Anyone interested in participating
should contact Grose at the Coffee House. "As soon as we have
enough people, we'll start," she said.
