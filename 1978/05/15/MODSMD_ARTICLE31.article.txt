# WSI profitable for swimmers
## 
### Annette Boken 
To get a head start on the
frantic search forsummer jobs,
a group of outgoing students
meet at deGuerre clad only in
bathing suits. They have been
cultivating their tans and get
ting into good physical shape
all quarter. These students,
under the supervision of Uni
versity faculty members Betsy
Weeks, Jeff Hammet and Kathy
Dagget, are learning how to
teach swimming.
Through lectures, films,
readings and pool work, Water
Safety Instruction (WSI) stu
dents can assimilate everything
needed to become certified
Red Cross instructors. One TA,
Kristen McCauley, said that
after passing this class and get
ting some practical teaching
experience, one can teach a
basic stroke to an inexperi
enced swimmer in about two
weeks' time.
Before students come to this
class, which is offered each
spring, "they must have a bet
ter than average grasp of
lifesaving skills," according to
Weeks. As the class begins, the
students work in small groups
and take turns evaluating each

other's skills and strokes, in ef
fect, teaching each other. The
swimming part of the Red
Cross examination is adminis
tered at this time. Perfecting
their skills the first few weeks is
hard work and the attrition rate
is high.
As the quarter progresses,
the emphasis switches to the
teaching aspect of the class.
The students draw up lesson
plans using Red Cross manuals
as guides. About 140 children
from Escondido Village come
for eight classes to obtain free
lessons from these aspiring
teachers.
'I like my teacher'
Andrea Otos, a seven-year
old student, expressed the
mutual sentiment of the chil
dren: "I really like my teacher
. . . now I can go swimming in
Grandma's big pond."
The Red Cross certificate is

the WSI students' ultimate
goal. They must pass two
take-homes, a written final
exam and the swimming per
formance test to obtain their
certificate.
Comments from teaching
assistants are also important.
TAs look for "friendliness, cor
rect and clear explanations,
logical lesson plans and future
teaching potential" in evaluat
ing the WSI students.
The TAs, most of whom took
the class last year, explained
the value of taking this rigor
ous course. Jim Hinson had
been teaching swimming pri
vately during previous sum
mers. Only after obtaining his
Red Cross certificate could he
make $3.25 an hour as a
lifeguard/instructor at a public
pool at his home in Albany,
Oregon. He also found that he
was able to TA an advanced
swimming class here at Stan

ford because he had the cer
tificate.
$12 an hour
McCauley said that in Los
Angeles, a certified instructor
can make $4.25 an hour at a
public pool. For private les
sons, she could make $6 a half
hour.
At Stanford this summer,
veteran water polo coach
Dante Dettamanti will be head
ing a team of swim instructors
who will be paid $8 an hour for
their services. However, more
experience is required of these
candidates. Some of the WSI
TAs hope to participate in this
during the upcoming summer.
A three-unit class, Water
Safety Instruction is a profita
ble investment in the future. It
is a great opportunity for those
who want to combine their
swimming ability with teaching
or lifeguarding. However, the
WSI tan is deceptively appeal
ing: it cannot be obtained
without a good deal of effort.

Swimming instruction can take place both in the water and "on shore" as this youngster is finding out.
After attending lectures and films and teaching swimming to about 140 children from Escondido Village,
University students enrolled in Water Safety Instruction find their ultimate goal to be a Red Cross
certificate. Two take-home exams, a written final and the swimming performance test must all be passed
before this goal becomes a reality, however. But despite the tremendous hard work students must devote
to the class, the net result can be extremely profitable — a team of swim instructors at Stanford will be
paid $8 an hour this summer.

Swimming instruction can take place both in the water and "on shore" as this youngster is finding out.
After attending lectures and films and teaching swimming to about 140 children from Escondido Village,
University students enrolled in Water Safety Instruction find their ultimate goal to be a Red Cross
certificate. Two take-home exams, a written final and the swimming performance test must all be passed
before this goal becomes a reality, however. But despite the tremendous hard work students must devote
to the class, the net result can be extremely profitable — a team of swim instructors at Stanford will be
paid $8 an hour this summer.
To get a head start on the
frantic search forsummer jobs,
a group of outgoing students
meet at deGuerre clad only in
bathing suits. They have been
cultivating their tans and get
ting into good physical shape
all quarter. These students,
under the supervision of Uni
versity faculty members Betsy
Weeks, Jeff Hammet and Kathy
Dagget, are learning how to
teach swimming.
Through lectures, films,
readings and pool work, Water
Safety Instruction (WSI) stu
dents can assimilate everything
needed to become certified
Red Cross instructors. One TA,
Kristen McCauley, said that
after passing this class and get
ting some practical teaching
experience, one can teach a
basic stroke to an inexperi
enced swimmer in about two
weeks' time.
Before students come to this
class, which is offered each
spring, "they must have a bet
ter than average grasp of
lifesaving skills," according to
Weeks. As the class begins, the
students work in small groups
and take turns evaluating each

other's skills and strokes, in ef
fect, teaching each other. The
swimming part of the Red
Cross examination is adminis
tered at this time. Perfecting
their skills the first few weeks is
hard work and the attrition rate
is high.
As the quarter progresses,
the emphasis switches to the
teaching aspect of the class.
The students draw up lesson
plans using Red Cross manuals
as guides. About 140 children
from Escondido Village come
for eight classes to obtain free
lessons from these aspiring
teachers.
'I like my teacher'
Andrea Otos, a seven-year
old student, expressed the
mutual sentiment of the chil
dren: "I really like my teacher
. . . now I can go swimming in
Grandma's big pond."
The Red Cross certificate is

the WSI students' ultimate
goal. They must pass two
take-homes, a written final
exam and the swimming per
formance test to obtain their
certificate.
Comments from teaching
assistants are also important.
TAs look for "friendliness, cor
rect and clear explanations,
logical lesson plans and future
teaching potential" in evaluat
ing the WSI students.
The TAs, most of whom took
the class last year, explained
the value of taking this rigor
ous course. Jim Hinson had
been teaching swimming pri
vately during previous sum
mers. Only after obtaining his
Red Cross certificate could he
make $3.25 an hour as a
lifeguard/instructor at a public
pool at his home in Albany,
Oregon. He also found that he
was able to TA an advanced
swimming class here at Stan

ford because he had the cer
tificate.
