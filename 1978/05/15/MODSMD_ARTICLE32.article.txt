Postal rates due to increase soon
Washington — The cost of mailing a letter almost cer
tainly will go from 13 cents to 15 cents around the end of
May.
The Postal Rate Commission's recommendation for
the fifth increase in the first-class mail rate in the past
decade was to be made official today. The Postal Ser
vice's governors have called a special meeting for May 19
to consider the recommendation.
Under law, the Postal Service could reject the rate
commission's recommendation and keep the present
rates, but that is considered unlikely. The deficit
plagued service saysit needs the money that higher rates
would bring in.
The rate commission action amounts to a rejection of
President Jimmy Carter's suggestion last July that private
individuals be spared the next postal rate increase.
Ethiopian desert rebellion persists
Nairobi, Kenya — Ethiopia's military strongman said
neighboring Somalia is keeping the secessionist rebell
ion alive in Ethiopia's Ogaden desert and his Cuban and
Soviet-backed forces will strike across the frontier un
less Somalia halts its support for the rebels.
"We will be forced to carry the struggle across the
border" in the absence of Somali restraint, Lt. Col. Men
gistu Haile Mariam told a crowd of 20,000 in the Ogaden
market town of Jijiga, Ethiopian radio said yesterday.
The radio also quoted Mengistu, chairman of the rul
ing military council, as saying: 'Thousands of Egyptian,
Pakistani and U.S. military advisers and like-minded
powers are now in Somalia preparing to strike Ethiopia
when the opportunity permits."

He accused Somalia of "stockpiling its war arsenal
with the active cooperation of the imperialist block," to
invade Ethiopia.
Train derails, three tank cars burn
Nacogdoches, Texas — Several hundred people were
evacuated yesterday after three tank cars exploded and
burned when a Southern Pacific freight train derailed in
Nacogdoches.
The police department said the contents of the burn
ing cars had not been determined by late afternoon, and
a chemical expert was en route from Houston.
The only injuries reported were minor ones sustained
by two law enforcement officials in the fire that followed
the explosion.
South African black power rapped
London — South African Prime Minister John Vorster,
in an interview broadcast yesterday on British television,
said he ruled out one-man, one-vote status for South
Africa's black majority.
"We will not be swamped, make no mistake about
that, whatever you or anybody else has to say about it,"
Vorster said on the program "Weekend World."
Vorster said blacks in South Africa can only have polit
ical power in their own specially created homelands.
