# Harvard Corporation opposes divestment
## Students counter with marches 
### Joel Dickholtz 
While members of the Stanford
Committee for Responsible Invest
ment Policy (SCRIP) spent much of
this spring staging sit-ins in President
Richard Lyman's office, Encina Hall
and Old Union, Harvard students
held a torchlight march, a five-day
vigil and a sit-out that resulted in the
closing of the administrative offices
at University Hall.
The cause of protest in both cases
was University stock holdings in cor
porations that do business in South
Africa.
Members of the South African Sol
idarity Committee (SASC), Harvard's
counterpart to SCRIP, have expres
sed outrage at the Harvard Corpora

tion's recent decision not to divest
itself of stock in American corpora
tions with operations in South Africa.
In a report released on April 27, the
Harvard Corporation said that al
though the apartheid system is "re
pugnant and inhumane," it opposes
divestiture.
The night after the report was re
leased, more than 3500 students
marched across the Harvard campus
in protest. The demonstration began
at 9:30 p.m. with protesters carrying
candles and kerosene-soaked
torches.
The next day approximately 150 to
500 students staged a sit-out around
University Hall, closing the building.
As Archie Epps, dean of students, at

tempted to enter the building, his
path was blocked by a student who
said, "I think the issue of South Af
rica is too important for this building
to be open today."
The demonstrators also blocked
President Derek Bok's entrance to
the building.
According to Frank Connoly of
Harvard's student newspaper, The
Harvard Crimson, the movement
started to die down slightly as "read
ing period" began at the beginning
of May. Reading period at Harvard is
somewhat similar to Stanford's Dead
Week.
Connoly added that some form of
protest may be staged during com
mencement.
