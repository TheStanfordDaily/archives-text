# Paraquat usage continues despite proven hazards
## 
### Jean Kimmel 
Despite pressure from U.S. offi
cials, the Mexican government is
continuing to use paraquat to kill
fields of marijuana, according to the
National Organization for the Re
form of Marijuana Laws (NORML).
The White House has been trying
to persuade the Mexicans to switch
to the less lethal herbicide, 2,4-D.
On March 12, HEW Secretary
joseph Califano issued a health warn
ing cautioning that the amount of
paraquat usually contained in con
taminated pot could have serious ef
fects on marijuana users.
"I don't see this switch as a solu
tion to the problem," said Gordon
Brownell, director of the San Fran
cisco office of NORML. "Tons of con
taminated marijuana are brought

into the United States. Millions of
people are going to be affected
whether it is contaminated with
paraquat or 2,4-D," he continued.
Two million
The National Institute of Drug
Abuse estimates that over two mill
ion people, both heavy and light pot
smokers, may have been affected.
Paraquat causes a condition in the
lungs called fibrosis, where some
cells of the lungs die and foreign
growths appear. Fibrosis reduces the
capacity of the lungs to absorb oxy
gen.
A heavy smoker (one to three
joints per day, each contaminated to
a paraquat level of 2000 parts per mill
ion) could have measurable lung
damage after several months. The
damage is irreversible.
Ingesting marijuana contaminated
with paraquat also presents a risk. A
human would have to ingest (as in
brownies) about two ounces of
marijuana every day for two years (at
a contamination level of 2000 ppm) to
reach the lowest dose level where
cell damage was observed in ani
mals. However, scientists have
found humans to be more sensitive
to the poison that animals.
Don't smoke poison
"The best advice I can give to any
one is not to smoke marijuana that
could be poisoned. You may not
show the symptoms now but there

could be long-term damage that is
not apparent. We are still investigat
ing the problem so there may be
other dangers that we don't know of
as yet," said Dr. David Smith of the
Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic.
Smith said the common symptoms
are respiratory distress, burning of
the throat, nausea and bloody saliva.
Science magazine reported in Feb
ruary that 2,4-D is not considered to
be as toxic to humans as paraquat
although studies have indicated that
it causes mutations and cancer in
animals.
Sucks plant dry
Paraquat is the herbicide used for
marijuana spraying and 2,4-D is cur
rently used for opium poppy spray
ing. Paraquat, in conjunction with
the sun destroys the marijuana plant
tissue within three to seven days
after the spraying. It literally sucks
the plant dry.
The U.S. drug enforcement estab
lishment and the Mexican govern
ment began the herbicide spraying
project in 1975, with the purpose of
diminishing the flow of drugs into
the United States.
The project consisted of spraying
fields of marijuana and opium pop
pies with potent herbicides. This
same system was used in the Vietnam
War to defoliate the dense South
Asian jungles.
Over 50 million American tax dol
lars have been used for this program
of aerial herbicide spraying. The
funds have gone to the Mexican gov
ernment in the form of helicopters,
support systems and trained staff.
The trained staff fly with the Mexican
pilots to locate marijuana and poppy
fields and to insure the fields are de
stroyed.
Mexican farmers discovered that if
they harvested the marijuana 24
hours after the spraying, their crops
were unharmed and could still be
sold.
Approximately 2500 tons of
marijuana enter this country from

Mexico every year. Pharm Chem Re
search Foundation, a Palo Alto-based
firm that operates a testing service
for street drugs recently estimated
that between 25 to 33 per cent of the
marijuana samples tested were con
taminated with paraquat.
Once paraquat-laced marijuana
reaches the consumer, identification
may not be possible without sophis
ticated testing equipment. Paraquat
has no characteristic odor and may
be mixed with untreated marijuana.
Pharm Chem is the only local firm
where pot samples can be chemically
tested for paraquat contamination.
The lab also tests for other contamin
ants.

"We have been swamped with
samples to be tested," said an
employee. "We have tested all types
of marijuana from Mexico pot to the
so-called Columbian Gold. We have
found contamination in all types no
matter what it is called," he con
tinued.
"No pot is really safe except for
home-grown," said Dave McQueen
of KSAN-FM radio. "Venezuela and
Argentina are also spraying their
crops and selling them to the United
States via Columbia."
Pharm Chem lab discourages the
use of home-testing kits. The kits
they tried have been unreliable be
cause they lack the many chemicals
needed to adequately separate the
paraquat from the plant tissue.
Separating the two is an involved
filtration process and testing for con
tent use is a sophisticated thin-layer
chromatography method.
"This is a serious issue. I wouldn't
trust a $10 mail-order kit from the
Rolling Stone with your health," said
one University senior.
