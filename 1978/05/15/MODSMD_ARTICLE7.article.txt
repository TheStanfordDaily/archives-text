# SLE curriculum sets demanding workload

SLE. What is it? One student said it
stands for a computer system at
LOTS. Another thought it had some
thing to do with SLAC. Many stu
dents don't seem to know what SLE
stands for: Structured Liberal Educa
tion, a nine-unit, year-long residen
tial freshman seminar.
SLE is a five-year-old interdiscipli
nary program for selected freshmen
in which students learn and live to
gether, according to Director Mark
Mancall. The goals of SLE are to pro
mote students' learning skills, to
teach them about the great cultural
monuments of Western Civilization,
and to help students understand the
common denominators of certain
cultures by studying their
philosophical, scientific, literary and
political products, said Mancall.
Mancall said that during the late
'60s several University faculty and
graduate students noticed a growing
lack of education among students,
many of whom were unaware of the
great cultural monuments of our
civilization and were unable to read
and write.
According to Mancall, Western
Civilization was chosen to combat
these problems because "We are the
products of this culture; even
though we may have ties to other
cultures, we all live in Western Cul
ture."
Mancall added it was felt that
everyone needs a firm basis from
which to view the world, whether or
not that basis is the right one. "Only
through knowledge can- control or
change occur," he said.
The SLE curriculum is based on as
sumptions that there are certain
documents, art works and dis
coveries that every student should

be familiar with and that these texts
should be studied in a historical and
cross-disciplinary context.
Seminars and small group tutorials
are the main forms of instruction,
though some regular University lec
tures are also used.
The SLE faculty boasts scholars
from many fields, including English
and humanities, political science,
sociology, physics and philosophy.
Advanced undergraduate and
graduate students, including many
former SLE students, serve as writing
tutors. Both tutors and faculty are
chosen for their desire to work
closely with the program.
Each tutor is assigned three or four
students per quarter. SLE faculty
member John Goheen said he felt
that everyone on the SLE staff really
enjoys it. Mancall added that
everyone seemed to work hard to
cooperate with each other and that
many of the original faculty have
stayed with the program.
An important part of SLE is its em
phasis on residential education, said
Mancall. Since education and living
are not separate in life, the SLE prog
ram does not separate them at the
University, he added. All SLE stu
dents live in Florence Moore Hall,
along with other non-SLE students.
Most of the course work of SLE takes
place in the dorm.
Several SLE and non-SLE students
interviewed said they felt SLE stu
dents were too cliquish and closed
off from other students. One tutor
said it was only natural for students
who spend much time together to
"develop into a tight group."
SLE freshman Jim Moore cited
pressure as another problem with
having students learn and live to
gether. Because so many people un
dergo pressure (from papers, etc.) at
the same time, the atmosphere at the
dorm can be quite oppressive and
tense, he said.
Ted Mitchell, an SLE tutor and
former SLE student, said SLE attracts
the most highly motivated students,
many of whom measure themselves
only through grades. The result, he
added, is that a competitive, high
pressure atmosphere tends to de
velop at times.
Each SLE assignment is graded by
at least two faculty members. At the
end of each quarter, the entire SLE
staff gets together and discusses

whether or not each student has
been working up to his or her full
potential. Students are graded on
this basis.
SLE is a program which encourages
breadth and critical thinking, said
Mancall. He added he feels it is most
important to teach students how to
question. He said one of his goals for
the program is to end up with "60
dissatisfied students who won't ac
cept anything as a given."
It is important to the faculty that
students know how to question,
Mancall noted, because if students
don't question, faculty won't either,
and stagnation will result.

Each tutor is assigned three or four
students per quarter. SLE faculty
member John Goheen said he felt
that everyone on the SLE staff really
enjoys it. Mancall added that
everyone seemed to work hard to
cooperate with each other and that
many of the original faculty have
stayed with the program.
An important part of SLE is its em
phasis on residential education, said
Mancall. Since education and living
are not separate in life, the SLE prog
ram does not separate them at the
University, he added. All SLE stu
dents live in Florence Moore Hall,
along with other non-SLE students.
Most of the course work of SLE takes
place in the dorm.
Several SLE and non-SLE students
interviewed said they felt SLE stu
dents were too cliquish and closed
off from other students. One tutor
said it was only natural for students
who spend much time together to
"develop into a tight group."
SLE freshman Jim Moore cited
pressure as another problem with
having students learn and live to
gether. Because so many people un
dergo pressure (from papers, etc.) at
the same time, the atmosphere at the
dorm can be quite oppressive and
tense, he said.
Ted Mitchell, an SLE tutor and
former SLE student, said SLE attracts
the most highly motivated students,
many of whom measure themselves
only through grades. The result, he
added, is that a competitive, high
pressure atmosphere tends to de
velop at times.
Each SLE assignment is graded by
at least two faculty members. At the
end of each quarter, the entire SLE
staff gets together and discusses

whether or not each student has
been working up to his or her full
potential. Students are graded on
this basis.
SLE is a program which encourages
breadth and critical thinking, said
Mancall. He added he feels it is most
important to teach students how to
question. He said one of his goals for
the program is to end up with "60
dissatisfied students who won't ac
cept anything as a given."
It is important to the faculty that
students know how to question,
Mancall noted, because if students
don't question, faculty won't either,
and stagnation will result.
SLE. What is it? One student said it
stands for a computer system at
LOTS. Another thought it had some
thing to do with SLAC. Many stu
dents don't seem to know what SLE
stands for: Structured Liberal Educa
tion, a nine-unit, year-long residen
tial freshman seminar.
SLE is a five-year-old interdiscipli
nary program for selected freshmen
in which students learn and live to
gether, according to Director Mark
Mancall. The goals of SLE are to pro
mote students' learning skills, to
teach them about the great cultural
monuments of Western Civilization,
and to help students understand the
common denominators of certain
cultures by studying their
philosophical, scientific, literary and
political products, said Mancall.
Mancall said that during the late
'60s several University faculty and
graduate students noticed a growing
lack of education among students,
many of whom were unaware of the
great cultural monuments of our
civilization and were unable to read
and write.
According to Mancall, Western
Civilization was chosen to combat
these problems because "We are the
products of this culture; even
though we may have ties to other
cultures, we all live in Western Cul
ture."
Mancall added it was felt that
everyone needs a firm basis from
which to view the world, whether or
not that basis is the right one. "Only
through knowledge can- control or
change occur," he said.
The SLE curriculum is based on as
sumptions that there are certain
documents, art works and dis
coveries that every student should

be familiar with and that these texts
should be studied in a historical and
cross-disciplinary context.
Seminars and small group tutorials
are the main forms of instruction,
though some regular University lec
tures are also used.
The SLE faculty boasts scholars
from many fields, including English
and humanities, political science,
sociology, physics and philosophy.
Advanced undergraduate and
graduate students, including many
former SLE students, serve as writing
tutors. Both tutors and faculty are
chosen for their desire to work
closely with the program.
Each tutor is assigned three or four
