# LSD: popular student use continues
## 
### Erik Cleage News analysis 
Lysergic acid diethylamide, commonly
known as LSD-25 or simply LSD, the mystical
wonder drug which unlocks the doors of per
ception, still maintains its popularity on the
Stanford campus.
In a random survey of campus residences,
student responses were mixed. Seven per cent
of the residents in one dormitory admitted to
having used the drug. This figure was the low
est percentage obtained in the survey. In one
freshman dormitory, 19 per cent of the resi
dents had "tripped" at least once.
The highest percentage was found in a four
class residence in which approximately 50 per
cent of the residents had experimented with
LSD.
There is no indication that any of these fi
gu res accurately represents the student body as
a whole.
Perhaps one reason LSD is apparently so
popular is its inexpensive cost compared to
other drugs such as cocaine. LSD can be taken
for as little as 75 cents per trip.
Dr. Albert Hofmann, a Swiss chemist, first
synthesized LSD in 1938. Five years later, Hof
mann accidentally allowed a minute amount of

the chemical to be absorbed into his hand.
After about 40 minutes, Hofmann noted "mild
dizziness, restlessness, inability to concen
trate, visual disturbance and uncontrollable
laughter."
LSD was classified as a hallucinogen soon
after its discovery. However, this label has been
debated ever since. An actual hallucination is
something one sees and thinks is there but
really isn't.
One major difference between an LSD user
and a person actually experiencing hallucina
tions is that the LSD user usually remains aware
that what he is experiencing is a drug-inducpd
phenomenon and doesn't accept it as real.
Dr. Sidney Cohen wrote in 1960 that people
"with excessive initial apprehension," have an
increased likelihood of a bad trip.
Many persons in the medical field agree that
a person under the influence of LSD should not
be left alone.
LSD can sometimes take as long as two hours
after ingestion before it begins to act. The first
indication of effectiveness is an almost uncon
trollable feeling of euphoria throughout the
body.
By 1966 LSD's use, particularly among college
students, had escalated to such a level that it

became a national controversy.
Mass "scare attempts" against LSD use were
launched and had little effect. However, in 1967
LSD use temporarily dropped drastically when
it was announced that the drug damaged
white-blood-cell chromosomes.
Although damage to white-blood-cell
chromosomes is no indication of genetic dam
age, many people took it as such until healthy
babies were born to LSD users.
A study of 120 "LSD babies" subsequently
showed birth defects no more common than in
babies of non-LSD users. LSD use again began
to rise.
Today, two widespread fears of LSD are brain
damage and flashbacks — a sudden and unex
pected re-experiencing of some portion of an
earlier trip, weeks or even months after the
intake.
According to a government Consumer Re
ports Guide, anyone can experience a
flashback with or without LSD. Any intense
emotional experience may unexpectedly re
turn vividly to consciousness weeks or even
months later.
By 1973 about 10 million Americans had tried
LSD according to the National Commission of
Marijuana and Drug Abuse.

One major difference between an LSD user
and a person actually experiencing hallucina
tions is that the LSD user usually remains aware
that what he is experiencing is a drug-inducpd
phenomenon and doesn't accept it as real.
Dr. Sidney Cohen wrote in 1960 that people
"with excessive initial apprehension," have an
increased likelihood of a bad trip.
Many persons in the medical field agree that
a person under the influence of LSD should not
be left alone.
LSD can sometimes take as long as two hours
after ingestion before it begins to act. The first
indication of effectiveness is an almost uncon
trollable feeling of euphoria throughout the
body.
By 1966 LSD's use, particularly among college
students, had escalated to such a level that it

became a national controversy.
Mass "scare attempts" against LSD use were
launched and had little effect. However, in 1967
LSD use temporarily dropped drastically when
it was announced that the drug damaged
white-blood-cell chromosomes.
Although damage to white-blood-cell
chromosomes is no indication of genetic dam
age, many people took it as such until healthy
babies were born to LSD users.
A study of 120 "LSD babies" subsequently
showed birth defects no more common than in
babies of non-LSD users. LSD use again began
to rise.
Today, two widespread fears of LSD are brain
damage and flashbacks — a sudden and unex
pected re-experiencing of some portion of an
earlier trip, weeks or even months after the
intake.
According to a government Consumer Re
ports Guide, anyone can experience a
flashback with or without LSD. Any intense
emotional experience may unexpectedly re
turn vividly to consciousness weeks or even
months later.
By 1973 about 10 million Americans had tried
LSD according to the National Commission of
Marijuana and Drug Abuse.
