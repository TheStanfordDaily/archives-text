# Cardinals, Bears finish in tie
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
It was only right for the
senior members of the Cardi
nal baseball team to conclude
their last season at Stanford
with a victory. Atter losing the
first game of Saturday's twinbill
14-11, Stanford came back to
beat the California Golden
Bears 6-4 in the final game of
1978.
The Cards had mopped up
one win Friday at Berkeley by
adding three runs while Cal
only contributed two to the 8-8
tie of April 22 that had been
called because of darkness.
But the regular series game
that day went to the Bears 7-6.
So the teams began on Satur
day with identical records.
Saturday's split, then, leaves
the Bears and the Cards with
6-12 records in league play and
makes this the second year in a
row that the two teams have
shared third place. Meanwhile,
in Southern California, theTro
jans took two out of three from
UCLA to improve their record
to 15-3 while the Bruins broke
even at 9-9.
Stanford concluded the 1978
season well above .500 overall.
The team's 35-20-1 record
makes this the 13th out of the
past 14 years that Stanford has
finished above .600 for the
year. And for coach Mark Mar
quess, the .625 winning per
centage for his second year of
coaching here goes well with
last year's .647 ending mark.
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nals, most of the wins con
tributing to the high percen
tages this year and last have
come in pre-season play. Be

fore jumping to the conclusion
that the teams seem to
"choke" in league play, one
must consider the high caliber
of play in the Pacific-8 South
ern Division. Next year, the
addition of Arizona and
Arizona State to the league
ought to even out the current
Southern California domi
nance.
This weekend's games with
Cal were by no means the best
played games this year for
either team. Worn out pitch
ers, erring fielders, and a host
of other happenings from bad
calls to intermittent time-outs
for soccer balls in left field,
gave the games a circus-like
appearance at times.
In the conclusion of the 8-8
tie Friday, Cal committed four
errors during Stanford's first at
bats. That gave the Cards a 10-8
edge and what looked like an
easy win for Stanford pitcher
|oe LoPresti, but Cal came up
with a couple of runs on two
hits to tie the game in the home
half of the inning.
Paul Zuvella led off the top of
the 12th with a stand-up dou
ble into right field. Larry
Reynolds moved Zuvella over
to third laying down a perfect
bunt to the third base side, and
Tom Guardino collected the
RBI as Stanford executed an
excellent squeeze play.
LoPresti held the Bears in the
bottom of the 12th to pick up
his delayed gratification win
that he worked at for 8-2/3 in
nings in April.
LoPresti had another win in
his hand through four innings

of the game that started shortly
thereafter. Stanford jumped
out to a 5-0 lead early in the ball
game, but Cal scored twice in
the third and tied the score in
the fifth on one walk and three
solid hits before LoPresti
yielded his position.
Cal went ahead in the sixth
on an unearned run, but Mike
Codiroli's second homerun of
the year evened the score in
the eighth. A Cal double and a
two-out clutch single by Cal
catcher Tom Colburn ac
counted for the single run in
the last inning that earned the
Bears the 7-6 victory.
Saturday, in the first game,
the parade of the pitchers be
gan. Eight pitchers for the two
teams took their turns on the
mound. Along with the chang
ing pitchers routine went a
home run hitting contest that
see-sawed the score through
out the three and one-half
hour game.
Seniors Randy Wong, Dave
Perez, Pepe hlinojosa, and
Gary Scott all homered for the
Cardinals while Cal catcher
Colburn jacked two home runs
and Cal centerfielder Don
Driscoll took one out of the
park. Though there was some
disagreement on the ruling on
Hinojosa's hit (as to wheiher it
hit the bank or the top of the
fence before bouncing back
into play) it went as a grand
slam in the official scorebook,
Despite the numerous Stan
ford home runs, Cal's three
run eighth and two run ninth

inning closed the door on the
Cardinals and left a lot riding
on the final game of the day.
In that final game, freshman
righthander Paul Grame gave a
super performance on the
mound. The local product
from Los Altos High worked his
way through eight full innings
yielding seven hits and only
two runs.
Tiring a bit in the top of the
ninth, he gave up a two-run
home run to shortstop Greg
Thys after walking the first bat
ter in the inning. Rob Irwin
came in to strike out the final
Cal batter after Grame got two
outs.

There's got to be an easier way, but C ardinal secondbaseman Todd Ervin used this method to complete a
double play against Cal Saturday.
It was only right for the
senior members of the Cardi
nal baseball team to conclude
their last season at Stanford
with a victory. Atter losing the
first game of Saturday's twinbill
14-11, Stanford came back to
beat the California Golden
Bears 6-4 in the final game of
1978.
The Cards had mopped up
one win Friday at Berkeley by
adding three runs while Cal
only contributed two to the 8-8
tie of April 22 that had been
called because of darkness.
But the regular series game
that day went to the Bears 7-6.
So the teams began on Satur
day with identical records.
Saturday's split, then, leaves
the Bears and the Cards with
6-12 records in league play and
makes this the second year in a
row that the two teams have
shared third place. Meanwhile,
in Southern California, theTro
jans took two out of three from
UCLA to improve their record
to 15-3 while the Bruins broke
even at 9-9.
Stanford concluded the 1978
season well above .500 overall.
The team's 35-20-1 record
makes this the 13th out of the
past 14 years that Stanford has
finished above .600 for the
year. And for coach Mark Mar
quess, the .625 winning per
centage for his second year of
coaching here goes well with
last year's .647 ending mark.
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nals, most of the wins con
tributing to the high percen
tages this year and last have
come in pre-season play. Be

fore jumping to the conclusion
that the teams seem to
"choke" in league play, one
must consider the high caliber
of play in the Pacific-8 South
ern Division. Next year, the
addition of Arizona and
Arizona State to the league
ought to even out the current
Southern California domi
nance.
This weekend's games with
Cal were by no means the best
played games this year for
either team. Worn out pitch
ers, erring fielders, and a host
of other happenings from bad
calls to intermittent time-outs
for soccer balls in left field,
gave the games a circus-like
appearance at times.
In the conclusion of the 8-8
tie Friday, Cal committed four
errors during Stanford's first at
bats. That gave the Cards a 10-8
edge and what looked like an
easy win for Stanford pitcher
|oe LoPresti, but Cal came up
with a couple of runs on two
hits to tie the game in the home
half of the inning.
Paul Zuvella led off the top of
the 12th with a stand-up dou
ble into right field. Larry
Reynolds moved Zuvella over
to third laying down a perfect
bunt to the third base side, and
Tom Guardino collected the
RBI as Stanford executed an
excellent squeeze play.
LoPresti held the Bears in the
bottom of the 12th to pick up
his delayed gratification win
that he worked at for 8-2/3 in
nings in April.
LoPresti had another win in
his hand through four innings

of the game that started shortly
thereafter. Stanford jumped
out to a 5-0 lead early in the ball
game, but Cal scored twice in
the third and tied the score in
the fifth on one walk and three
solid hits before LoPresti
yielded his position.
Cal went ahead in the sixth
on an unearned run, but Mike
Codiroli's second homerun of
the year evened the score in
the eighth. A Cal double and a
two-out clutch single by Cal
catcher Tom Colburn ac
counted for the single run in
the last inning that earned the
Bears the 7-6 victory.
Saturday, in the first game,
the parade of the pitchers be
gan. Eight pitchers for the two
teams took their turns on the
mound. Along with the chang
ing pitchers routine went a
home run hitting contest that
see-sawed the score through
out the three and one-half
hour game.
Seniors Randy Wong, Dave
Perez, Pepe hlinojosa, and
Gary Scott all homered for the
Cardinals while Cal catcher
Colburn jacked two home runs
and Cal centerfielder Don
Driscoll took one out of the
park. Though there was some
disagreement on the ruling on
Hinojosa's hit (as to wheiher it
hit the bank or the top of the
fence before bouncing back
into play) it went as a grand
slam in the official scorebook,
Despite the numerous Stan
ford home runs, Cal's three
run eighth and two run ninth

inning closed the door on the
Cardinals and left a lot riding
on the final game of the day.
In that final game, freshman
righthander Paul Grame gave a
super performance on the
mound. The local product
from Los Altos High worked his
way through eight full innings
yielding seven hits and only
two runs.
Tiring a bit in the top of the
ninth, he gave up a two-run
home run to shortstop Greg
Thys after walking the first bat

came in to strike out the final

the third and tied the score in
the fifth on one walk and three
solid hits before LoPresti
yielded his position.
Cal went ahead in the sixth
on an unearned run, but Mike
Codiroli's second homerun of
the year evened the score in
the eighth. A Cal double and a
two-out clutch single by Cal
catcher Tom Colburn ac
counted for the single run in
the last inning that earned the
Bears the 7-6 victory.
Saturday, in the first game,
the parade of the pitchers be
gan. Eight pitchers for the two
teams took their turns on the
mound. Along with the chang
ing pitchers routine went a
home run hitting contest that
see-sawed the score through
out the three and one-half
hour game.
Seniors Randy Wong, Dave
Perez, Pepe hlinojosa, and
Gary Scott all homered for the
Cardinals while Cal catcher
Colburn jacked two home runs
and Cal centerfielder Don
Driscoll took one out of the
park. Though there was some
disagreement on the ruling on
Hinojosa's hit (as to wheiher it
hit the bank or the top of the
fence before bouncing back
into play) it went as a grand
slam in the official scorebook,
Despite the numerous Stan
ford home runs, Cal's three
run eighth and two run ninth

inning closed the door on the
Cardinals and left a lot riding
on the final game of the day.
In that final game, freshman
righthander Paul Grame gave a
super performance on the
mound. The local product
from Los Altos High worked his
way through eight full innings
yielding seven hits and only
two runs.
Tiring a bit in the top of the
ninth, he gave up a two-run
home run to shortstop Greg
Thys after walking the first bat
ter in the inning. Rob Irwin
came in to strike out the final
Cal batter after Grame got two
outs.

There's got to be an easier way, but C ardinal secondbaseman Todd Ervin used this method to complete a
double play against Cal Saturday.
