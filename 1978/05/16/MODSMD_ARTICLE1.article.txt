# Trustees, CIR members discuss proxy vote issues
## 
### Mike Charlson 
Tight timetables and a dearth of
independent information on South
Africa have been encountered by
both the Board of Trustees and the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility in their deliberations on vot
ing proxy issues.
That was the common complaint of
members of both groups in a meet
ing between the CIR and the board's
ad hoc Subcommittee on Investment
Responsibility last night at Durand.
The meeting ended with a promise
to try and adjust the timetable to give
trustees and CIR members more time
for consideration of controversial
proxy issues.
Both groups also expressed a de
sire to have more meetings together.
But basic differences in interpreta
tion of facts surrounding the South

African situation did not appear to be
resolved.
Trustee Otis Pease said making de
cisions based on published facts was
"very difficult. The question of
whether economic activity and
economic expansion ... in any fun
damental way can be said to contri
bute to lessening of oppression, of
apartheid, is one of the key academic
issues in the literature," Pease said.
Pease, a University of Washington
history professor, said he has found
substantial evidence on both sides of
the issue making it "very difficult to
come to a conclusion."
He and President Richard Lyman
said history shows that'political
change tends to occur during
periods of economic prosperity, not
during times of recession and depre
ssion which most people feel would
result from corporate withdrawal
from South Africa.
They pointed out that oppression
generally increases during period of
economic strife.
But Assoc. Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy, a CIR member,
said he felt withdrawal was the ans
wer.
"There is something close to a zero
per cent c hance of some sort of posi
tive political change for Africans with
continued corporate investment,"
he said.
He added that the chance of im
provement in the situation as a result
of withdrawal was probably only 3 to
5 per cent, but corporations had
been given the chance to initiate
progressive change, and they for the
most part had failed.
Withdrawal or the talk of with
drawal "produces a setting where
corporations and governments can
talk about the larger questions of so
cial justice," he said.
Abernethy said he felt the trustees

centered on a narrower definition of
substantial social injury than did the
CIR, addressing only employment
practices of the corporations.
Operations Research Prof. Fre
derick Hillier, chairman of the CIR,
said that a white South African stu
dent had told the CI R that withdrawal
would send "shock waves" through
the society, potentially prompting
action for change by some South Af
rican whites.
Many persons noted that specula
tion as to what withdrawal would do
was difficult, but trustees stressed
that the likely effect of withdrawal
was the matter in dispute, not
whether there was or was not social
injury caused by the corporations.
The issue is, after withdrawal, "did
the (social) injury go down or go up,"
said Trustee William Ayer.
Trustees generally agreed that so
cial injury does occur and corpora
tions do contribute to it despite an
Abernethy statement at the begin
ning of the meeting.
"The CIR, in order to reach the
trustees, had to prove that not only
was there substantial social injury in
South Africa, but that the corpora
tions were contributing to it," Aber
nethy said.
"I'm not sure that the trustees be
lieve that some corporations do con
tribute to social injury," he added.
Trustee William Eberle said the
issue was complex. He cited foreign
policy implications as well as the his
tory of investment. "Certainly many
of these companies invested money
many years ago when it wasn't so bad
to be there," he said.
Time pressures and possible im
provements in communication pro
cedures took much of the meeting
time.
