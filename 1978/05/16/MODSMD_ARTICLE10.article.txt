# GOP threatens for governor's seat
## Jerry Brown: running hard as primary nears 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — Gov.
Jerry Brown Jr. is setting a fran
tic pace these days, scrambling
for re-election as if his political
life depended on every last
vote.
There isn't even a remote
threat to Brown's renomina
tion in the June 6 Democratic
primary, where the 40-year-old
governor faces only token op
position from eight political
unknowns.
But Brown has a campaign
staff of 25 fulltime workers and
a radio and television advertis
ing budget of $600,000 for the
primary.
He is traveling tens of
thousands of miles throughout
California for a never-ending
series of speeches to civic, bus
iness, laborand ethnic groups,
student rallies, senior citizen
centers, dedication cere
monies, fund-raising parties,
anyplace there are voters.
"So far as I'm concerned, the
general election campaign has
begun, and I'm not stopping
until the day after the general
election," Brown said in an in
terview last week between
campaign appearances.
Full panoply
"And that means the full
panoply of activities from fun
draising to speech-making to
pressing the flesh to speaking
on the issues. I've dedicated all
my energy to the objective of
getting my message across."
Why all the activity?
Is Brown in political trouble

in 1978?
He could be.
In the last six months, the
Jerry Brown who has been vie
wed in the White House as the
most serious potential chal
lenger to President Jimmy Car
ter in 1980 has taken a nose
dive in California polls.
Slim lead
Last fall, Brown led all poten
tial COP opponents by margins
of 28 per cent or more. Recent
polls give him leads as slim as 6

per cent.
Republicans who viewed the
gubernatorial race as futile a
year ago now are enthusiasti
cally talking about an upset
over a man who nas been de
scribed repeatedly by national
columnists and other
opinionmakers as one of the
nation's most exciting and
charismatic new political lead
ers.
But Brown faces a bundle of
political problems in 1978,
foremost of which may be a

75-year-old political gadfly
named Howard Jarvis.
Jarvis spearheaded the peti
tion drive which placed on the
June ballot Proposition 13, a $7
billion annual cut in property
taxes.
Alternative proposition
Brown vigorously opposes
Proposition 13 and is sponsor
ing Proposition 8, an alterna
tive which offers smaller tax
cuts but which comes with the
promise of its backers that
there will be no other tax in
crease.
If Proposition 13 passes, as
many observers think it will, it
puts Brown in a no-win posi
tion. He can either watch
cities, counties and schools
start to lay off employees in
order to cut a total of $7 billion
from their budgets, or he can
sign massive appropriations of
state funds, probably tied to
some kind of state tax increase.
Either course is sure to an
tagonize huge blocs of voters
andgiveapotentelection issue
to Brown's opponent in
November.
Consequently, Brown is
campaigning as vigorously
against 13 as he is against his
major Republican challengers,
Attorney General Evelle
Younger, San Diego Mayor
Pete Wilson, state Assembly
man Ken Maddy and former
Los Angeles Police Chief Ed
Davis.
Line of attack
All of those Republican chal
lengers have adopted similar
lines of attack.
They blame Brown for a bad
business climate which they
say is taking jobs away from
Californians. They attack his
opposition on the construction
of new huclear power plants,
which they say will lead to
crippling power shortages in
the 1980s.
And they say Brown has
named inept or insensitive ap
pointees to state regulatory
boards and allowed them to
harass individuals and

businesses with unreasonable
regulations.
But something that appears
to nettle Brown even more
than those criticisms, and
spurs him on to an increasingly
frenetic campaign pace, is the
charge that he hasn't ac
complished much as governor.
Accomplished nothing
In a survey last fall, pollster
Mervin Field found that 80 per
cent of the voters thought
Brown was doing a good or fair
job, but that 51 per cent also
agreed with the statement that
Brown "hasn't really ac
complished anything impor
tant as governor."
For three years, Brown
ridiculed "laundry lists" of
political goals or accomplish
ments. But today he is pulling
out his own laundry list at every
stop and reciting accomplish
ments.

The list varies with the audi
ence, but it normally includes
signing of California's nuclear
safety laws, tougher enforce
ment of anti-smog laws, in
creased unemployment and
disability benefits, creation of a
permanent coastal conserva
tion commission and an in
crease in the number of
women and minorities in major
public posts.
Brown also is taking the of
fensive on the issue of the bus
iness climate, accusing Repub
licans of "a cynical manipula
tion" of economic statistics
when they say he is impeding
business growth.
More jobs
"California is creating jobs at
a rate 70 per cent faster than
the national average. Last year
we created 500,000 new jobs,"
he says.
"Corporate profits increased

25 per cent in California last
year compared to a national
average of 11 to 12 per cent. We
have a strong, diverse
economy, and that's why we're
able to afford good schools,
good parks, necessary services
for the less fortunate."
But two ideas which were
cornerstones of Brown's pub
lic image the past three years
are seldom mentioned today in
his campaign speeches.
One is the Agricultural Labor
Relations Board which he
created in 1975.
The ALRB is perhaps the
most difficult accomplishment
of Brown's administration, but
it is also the source of deep re
sentment in agricultural areas,
where many farmers say Brown
betrayed them by initially ap
pointing board members
biased in favor of farm labor
leader Cesar Chavez.

Gov. Jerry Brown
Sacramento (AP) — Gov.
Jerry Brown Jr. is setting a fran
tic pace these days, scrambling
for re-election as if his political
life depended on every last
vote.
There isn't even a remote
threat to Brown's renomina
tion in the June 6 Democratic
primary, where the 40-year-old
governor faces only token op
position from eight political
unknowns.
But Brown has a campaign
staff of 25 fulltime workers and
a radio and television advertis
ing budget of $600,000 for the
primary.
He is traveling tens of
thousands of miles throughout
California for a never-ending
series of speeches to civic, bus
iness, laborand ethnic groups,
student rallies, senior citizen
centers, dedication cere
monies, fund-raising parties,
anyplace there are voters.
"So far as I'm concerned, the
general election campaign has
begun, and I'm not stopping
until the day after the general
election," Brown said in an in
terview last week between
campaign appearances.
Full panoply
"And that means the full
panoply of activities from fun
draising to speech-making to
pressing the flesh to speaking
on the issues. I've dedicated all
my energy to the objective of
getting my message across."
Why all the activity?
Is Brown in political trouble

in 1978?
He could be.
In the last six months, the
Jerry Brown who has been vie
wed in the White House as the
most serious potential chal
lenger to President Jimmy Car
ter in 1980 has taken a nose
dive in California polls.
Slim lead
Last fall, Brown led all poten
tial COP opponents by margins
of 28 per cent or more. Recent
polls give him leads as slim as 6

per cent.
Republicans who viewed the
gubernatorial race as futile a
year ago now are enthusiasti
cally talking about an upset
over a man who nas been de
scribed repeatedly by national
columnists and other
opinionmakers as one of the
nation's most exciting and
charismatic new political lead
ers.
But Brown faces a bundle of
political problems in 1978,
foremost of which may be a

75-year-old political gadfly
named Howard Jarvis.
Jarvis spearheaded the peti
tion drive which placed on the
June ballot Proposition 13, a $7
billion annual cut in property
taxes.
Alternative proposition
Brown vigorously opposes
Proposition 13 and is sponsor
ing Proposition 8, an alterna
tive which offers smaller tax
cuts but which comes with the
promise of its backers that
there will be no other tax in
crease.
If Proposition 13 passes, as
many observers think it will, it
puts Brown in a no-win posi
tion. He can either watch
cities, counties and schools
start to lay off employees in
order to cut a total of $7 billion
from their budgets, or he can
sign massive appropriations of
state funds, probably tied to
some kind of state tax increase.
Either course is sure to an
tagonize huge blocs of voters
andgiveapotentelection issue
to Brown's opponent in
November.
Consequently, Brown is
campaigning as vigorously
against 13 as he is against his
major Republican challengers,
Attorney General Evelle
Younger, San Diego Mayor
Pete Wilson, state Assembly
man Ken Maddy and former
Los Angeles Police Chief Ed
Davis.
Line of attack
All of those Republican chal
lengers have adopted similar
lines of attack.
They blame Brown for a bad
business climate which they
say is taking jobs away from
Californians. They attack his
opposition on the construction
of new huclear power plants,
which they say will lead to
crippling power shortages in
the 1980s.
And they say Brown has
named inept or insensitive ap
pointees to state regulatory
boards and allowed them to
harass individuals and

businesses with unreasonable
regulations.
But something that appears
to nettle Brown even more
than those criticisms, and
spurs him on to an increasingly
frenetic campaign pace, is the
charge that he hasn't ac
complished much as governor.
Accomplished nothing
In a survey last fall, pollster
Mervin Field found that 80 per
cent of the voters thought
Brown was doing a good or fair
job, but that 51 per cent also
agreed with the statement that
Brown "hasn't really ac
complished anything impor
tant as governor."
For three years, Brown
ridiculed "laundry lists" of
political goals or accomplish
ments. But today he is pulling
out his own laundry list at every
stop and reciting accomplish
ments.

The list varies with the audi
ence, but it normally includes
signing of California's nuclear
safety laws, tougher enforce
ment of anti-smog laws, in
creased unemployment and
disability benefits, creation of a
permanent coastal conserva
tion commission and an in
crease in the number of
women and minorities in major
public posts.
Brown also is taking the of
fensive on the issue of the bus
iness climate, accusing Repub
licans of "a cynical manipula
tion" of economic statistics
when they say he is impeding
business growth.
More jobs
"California is creating jobs at
a rate 70 per cent faster than
the national average. Last year
we created 500,000 new jobs,"
he says.
"Corporate profits increased

25 per cent in California last
year compared to a national
average of 11 to 12 per cent. We
have a strong, diverse
economy, and that's why we're
able to afford good schools,
good parks, necessary services
for the less fortunate."
But two ideas which were
cornerstones of Brown's pub
lic image the past three years
are seldom mentioned today in
his campaign speeches.
One is the Agricultural Labor
Relations Board which he
created in 1975.
The ALRB is perhaps the
most difficult accomplishment
of Brown's administration, but
it is also the source of deep re
sentment in agricultural areas,
where many farmers say Brown
betrayed them by initially ap
pointing board members
biased in favor of farm labor
leader Cesar Chavez.
