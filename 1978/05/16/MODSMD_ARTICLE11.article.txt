San Francisco (AP) — For what it's worth, San
Francisco Airport may be the safest place in the
world for a plane crash.
"It stands as a model for others to emulate,"
said John Galipault, president of the Aviation
Safety Institute of Columbus, Ohio.
The clinic, with staff of 14 doctors, nurses and
technicians, noramlly has two or three doctors
on duty. It is equipped with $150,000 worth of
apparatus — including two mini-ambulances —
to deal with just about any medical emergency,
from a jumbo jet crash to a heart attack to food
poisoning to breathing failure to cuts and burns.
It handles as estimated 11,000 people annu
ally, about half of them passengers and "well
wishers." The rest are airline employees or
workers at nearby factories, motels or other
small businesses.
Treatment ranges from providing a Band-Aid
to restarting a heart.
"Just like a fire department, we have more
false alarms and little things than real things,"
said Dr. Lawrence Smookler, the airport's medi
cal director and driving force behind the clinic.
"But when that big baby comes . .
In a mere 1200 feet of space, across a corridor

from Delta Airlines' baggage claim area, the
clinic has three examining rooms, an X-ray
room, an operating room, two electrocardiog
ram machines, three defibrilators, and equip
ment to test employees' vision, hearing and eye
pressure — plus a reception area and an office
the doctors share.
"It's like working in a submarine," said
Smookler, who helped to start the clinic four
years ago.
For larger disasters — a major plane crash or
an earthquake, for example — the clinic de
pends on Building 1000. An old hanger named
for the pilot's code number for a crash, Building
1000 has enough portable hospital parapher
nalia to care for more than 200 crash victims and
enough cots to accommodate more than 1000.
"It boggles the mind, but one can envision
two 747's crashing together and we ending up
with 600 casualties. So you have to be pre
pared," said Smookler.
Once a month an emergency drill is held.
Doctors, nurses and firefighters are timed as
they rush to a runway as if a crash had occurred.
Once a year, a mock crash is staged, complete
with plane, fire and victims.
