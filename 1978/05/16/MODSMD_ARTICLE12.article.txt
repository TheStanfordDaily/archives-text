# High Court rejects appeal to consider gay rights
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Supreme Court re
fused yesterday to call into question the author
ity of states to outlaw homosexual acts between
consenting adults.
The court, with two justices disagreeing, left
untouched North Carolina's sodomy law over
arguments that it violates the privacy rights of
homosexuals.
Civil liberties lawyers had urged the justices to
use the case to study for the first time in more
than a decade the rights of homosexuals.
Returning from its last two-week recess of a
term scheduled to end )une 19, the court
handed down hundreds of orders and several
decisions. In other matters, the court:
— Agreed in a New York case to decide
whether states may refuse to hire resident aliens
as public school teachers. Past Supreme Court
decisions have barred states from discriminat
ing aginst aliens in various occupations, but last
March 22 the court said states may refuse to hire
aliens as state police officers.
— Ruled by a 6-3 vote that state courts may
intervene in labor disputes involving alleged il

legal picketing on private property. Since 1959,
state courts have had little authority to intervene
in such matters if the National Labor Relations
Board might become involved.
— Split 7-1 in a major decision on Indian tribal
sovereignty that tribes are immune from civil
suits alleging sex discrimination.
— Told a Moylan, Pa., Quaker who from 1969
to 1972 withheld portions of his federal income
taxes as "war crime deductions" that he has to
pay those back taxes.
— Decided by a 7-2 vote that the results of a
telephone wiretap in a criminal investigation are
admissable in court even though most of the
calls overheard by police were not relevant to
the probe.
— Rejected the fourth and, most likely, last
attempt by fc>o House members to scuttle the
Panama Canal treaties.
— Turned down an attempt by a Gulf Oil af
filiate to escape from a billion-dollar uranium
lawsuit pending before a New Mexico state
judge.
