# Davis may get Briggs' endorsement today

Sacramento (AP) â€”- State Sen.
John Briggs, a conservative
who has campaigned against
homosexual school teachers,
is expected to drop out of the
Republican race for governor
and endorse former Los
Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis.
Briggs, who has canceled
most campaign appearances in
recent weeks, ignored re
quests for interviews. A cam
paign aide would say only that
Briggs has scheduled a news
conference today in Los
Angeles.
A spokesman for Davis, )im
Bishop, said yesterday that
Briggs invited Davis to join him
at the news conference and
that Davis accepted the invita
tion "with electricity."
Bishop said he knew the
purpose of the joint news con
ference but was not at liberty to
confirm any rumors.
"It would be either Davis
endorsing Briggs or vice versa,
wouldn't it?" Bishop said.
Davis ranks either first or
second in various polls of Re
publican voters in the five-way
race for the Republican nomi
nation in the June 6 primary.
Briggs consistently places fifth,
and he sank to two per cent in
one recent poll.

That small amount of sup
port could be critical if the vot
ing on election day is as close
as the polls, which have placed
Davis, Attorney General Evelle
Younger and Assemblyman
Ken Maddy all within a range of
five percentage points and San
Diego Mayor Pete Wilson a few
points behind in fourth.
Briggs' best-known backer,
tax critic Howard Jarvis, author
of the Proposition 13 property
tax cut initiative, said he had
not talked to Briggs recently,
but believed the report to be
accurate.
"I've heard the same rumor.
Under the circumstances, I
have to believe it," Jarvis said.
"I understand the Briggs cam
paign did not get off the
ground."
Jarvis, who has built an inf
luential political following of
his own, said if Briggs does
withdraw, he will give his sup
port to Davis.
Briggs is generally regarded
as the most conservative Re
publican in the gubernatorial
primary, with a campaign built
around proposed voter initia
tives to make it easier to fire
homosexual teachers and to
broaden the death penalty.
