## Theater/karen caesar Silliness runs rampant in 'Festival' 
### 
When you go see "Festival," you
shouldn't take with you any preconceived
notions of what a good musical is. This
new musical by Stephen Downs is not
"Fiddler On the Roof"; it's not even "The
Music Man." It is, however, a vaguely
charming little show, the substance of
which you will probably forget within an
hour of leaving the theater, not because
you didn't like it, but because there simply
isn't much to it.
You will, however, remember the cos
tumes, the set and the lighting; these
three elements alone make "Festival"
worth seeing.
"Festival" puts to music the prototypical
story of two star-crossed lovers who meet
for 10 seconds during the middle ages and
fall madly, passionately in love. It is based
on the thirteenth century work "Aucassin
and Nicolette," which is rumored to have
been a source for Shakespeare's pastoral
comedies, as well as for parts of "Romeo
and Juliet."
Indeed, the plot is suspiciously familiar:
the lovers' parents are mortal enemies
who forbid them to pursue their love, but
of course they have already pledged their
devotion to one another and of course
they have to go through hell and high
water and a lot of stupid shenanigans (pi
rates, strange island natives) till they can
finally gaze into each other's eyes and sing
and. . . well, you just know there has to be
a happy ending.
You know this because three minutes
do not pass without someone bursting
into song; not song laden with tears and
melodrama, but song laden with one
liners and folk-rocky cuteness, all of which
seem somewhat inappropriate. In less
than two hours, there are 20 virtually indis
tinguishable songs — and that's about 10

too many.
The fact that Aucassin (Bill Hutton) is a
dead ringer for Shaun Cassidy doesn't
help matters much; combined with a few
other facts like the silly script and some
really silly musical numbers, it makes "Fes
tival" the kind of "family entertainment"
that can be a somewhat trying experience.
Ten years ago, "Festival" might have
been a refreshing change from the average
Broadway song-and-dance show, but
we've seen musicals progress and mature
and experiment; we've seen "Codspell"
and we've seen "A Chorus Line" and
we've s&en "The Rocky Horror Show";
we've seen just about everything, and the
mindless romping and uninspired
dialogue in "Festival" is a giant step
backward.
Good things
There are good things in the show, like
Gregory Harrison as the affable troubador
who narrates and occasionally participates
in the story. Unlike some of the other ac
tors, he has a good-natured, good -hu
mored enthusiasm that says to the audi
ence "hey, let's have some fun! Don't take
this stuff seriously!" You can't even hate
him when he says things like "without war
to keep our population down, we'd have
to turn to chastity, cold showers and the
plague." And his voice is excellent, rich
and expressive, which helps, since many
of the songs are so bland.
There is a whole lot of talent in the
nine-member cast. With the exception of
Nicolet'e (Lois Young), whose piercing
soprano is strangely inconsistent, all the
voices in the show are marvelous. And
while "Festival" is hardly a vehicle for
showing off any credible acting ability,
most of the troupe does the best with what
they have been given.

Indeed, the trouble lies in the script,
music and lyrics which are all the doings of
one man, Stephen Downs. "Festival" is
sometimes funny and sometimes sad, but
it is never funny or sad enough. Everyone
has heard this story or variations of it eight
zillion times and if we're going to re
member this particular version then there
better be something memorable about it.
Unbelievable set
What we will remember forever about
"Festival" is the production itself: lovely
period costumes, colorful, moody lighting
and an absolutely incredible wooden set;
just to see these alone is worth the price of
admission. If there is one thing that sus
tains the audience through the intermina
ble songs, it is the ongoing fear that the
entire set will cave in. Everything that is
needed — beds, boats, bridges, altars,
ladders, stairways, stained glass windows
— falls out of three huge wood-panelled
walls.
It is exciting to see how far costume,
lighting and set design have come; as op
posed the to the musical and literary as
pects of "Festival," the technical and artis
tic side of the show is way ahead of its
time. Madeline Ann Craneto did the ex
traordinary costumes; Russell Pyle should
be awarded the highest honors for his set
and lighting design (the man is a genius).
Jack Rowe and Michael Shawn directed
the production, which is being presented
by the American Conservatory Theatre
(ACT) outside its regular repertory
framework. "Festival" plays every night
except Monday at ACT's cozy Marines'
Theatre in San Francisco. There are Satur
day and Sunday matinees.
Go and see it. Chances are, on the drive
home you'll be talking more about that
fantastic set than about the show.


It's too bad Pamela Cordova, Kenneth Henley and
Roxann Parker aren't wearing their fabulous cos
tumes. The costumes, lighting and set are the real
