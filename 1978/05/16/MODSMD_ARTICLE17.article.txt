## 'Starting Here...': a celebration 
### 
"Starting Here, Starting
Now" is a rarity in entertain
ment today. It is a bright and
energetic production with all
the slam-bang excitement of a
hit Broadway musical; but, at
the same time, it retains the
style and intimacy of a quiet
nightclub performance.
For the past 20 years, lyricist
Richard Maltby and composer
David Shire have collaborated
in writing some of the most de
lightful songs in memory. Al
though their works had been
sung by artists such as Barbara
Steisand, Andy Williams and
Robert Flack, Maltby and Shire
still felt, and rightly so, that
their music had gone un
noticed by the public. For this
reason, the song team wrote
"Starting Here, Starting Now"
which is currently playing at
the Little Fox Theatre in San
Francisco.
Celebration
Made up of some 25 loosely
connected Maltby and Shire
songs, this production is much
more than a finely tuned musi
cal revue; it is a celebration of
music, humor, and life itself.
The young three-member
cast is brilliant. Made up of two
of the original Broadway stars
— Loni Ackerman and Margery
Cohen — along with the richly
talented Harvey Evans, the cast
fills the stage with a youthful
enthusiasm that is refreshing
to see.
"Starting Here, Starting
Now" really has no plot. The
tunes of which it is comprised,
however, are all related to the
central theme of love: its ups,
downs, joys and pains. It is a
credit to the three actors that
they are able to keep their au
dience spellbound with no
more than their songsand their
unending supply of talent.
The major criticism of the
production is that the swift and
bright pace does falter in the
second act. The actors, how
ever, are totally competent and
are able to quickly get the show
back on the right track.

Particularly good were Co
hen's quietly breathtaking re
ndition of "Autumn," Evans' "I
Don't Remember Christmas,"
and Ackerman's comic talent in
"Crossword Puzzle." All three
combine their abilties in "I
Hear Bells" and the show stop
ping "One Step."
Deserving particular men
tion is Cohen's hilarious
number, "I am Going to Make
You Beautiful" in which she
portrays a cosmetic saleswo
man at Bloomingdale's. Her
main goal is to "do the best I
can" to make her customers

pretty.
Since there are no more than
300 seats in the Little Fox
Theatre, it is easy to forget that
you are seeing a smash Off-
Broadway hit and not an enter
taining nightclub act. It is truly
a refreshing experience to be
in a theatre where the worst
seat is no more than 40 feet
from the stage.
"Starting Here, Starting
Now" plays Tuesday through
Friday at 8:30, Saturdays at 7
and 8:30, and Sundays at 3 and
7:30.
See it here! See it now!
