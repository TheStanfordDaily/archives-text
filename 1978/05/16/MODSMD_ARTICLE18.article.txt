## 'Streamers' disturbs 
### 
The Cannery Cinema celeb
rates its transformation into
the Cannery Theatre with a
presentation of David Rabe's
"Streamers." Unfortunately,
you cannot see this excellent
drama. Or, to be more specific,
you cannot see all of it.
The San Francisco director,
Richard L. Barr, has neglected
to correct the set's most blatant
fault: one cannot see the floor
of the stage. With most plays,
the limited viewing would only
be annoying, but the impaired
visibility proved more than
slightly detrimental to
"Streamers." Crucial scenes,
including two deaths, are visu
ally obstructed for most of the
audience.
Nevertheless, the produc
tion verifies the promoter's
claims of being "deeply mov
ing." The Vietnam war still
rages. Three roommates in an
army camp await orders to be
sent overseas. Billy ()ohn
Rubenstein), well-educated
and conservative, has enlisted
to fight for "freedom's fron
tier." Roger (Eddie Haley),
easygoing and black, simply
accepts the additional hard
ship of war. Richie (Warner
Shook), coy, wealthy and
homosexual, is exempt from

battle. Enter Carlyle (Richard
Lawson), and his tense, brutal
energy that lingers long after
he leaves the stage.
Carlyle, who befriends
Roger as a fellow black, is
against this warand, in particu
lar, against his own participa
tion. He expresses all the pas
sions and fears about war that
Billy, Roger and Richie repress.
Lawson presents a multi
dimensional Carlyle, so in
timidating yet plaintive that
one forgets one is watching a
Play-
Charles Durning as Cokes is
equally convincing as an old
sergeant returning from a bat
tle. Drunken and loud, he and
his friend, Rooney (Ralph
Meeker), tell the story of a man
who, detached from his
parachute, falls through the
sky with it streaming above
him. Survival is so near him
one moment, then streaming
far beyond him the next. They
laugh at death, at the triviality
of individual lives. Soon, how
ever, the laughter reveals a
nervous terror for one's own
life.
The other performances in
"Streamers" are all excellent
examples of professional act
ing, smooth and impeccably

timed.
The technical aspects of the
production (other than the de
tracting stage floor), the cos
tumes, set, lighting and
make-up,' added to the reality
of the scenes before the audi
ence.
One left the-raw emotional
ity of the drama clinging to the
comforting thought that "it is
only a play," but feeling that it
is much more. If you want to
spend a pleasant evening at the
theatre, buy tickets foranother
play. If you yvbuld rather be
emotionally drained but left
with the belief that you've seen
and learned something sub
stantial, I highly recommend
"Streamers " at the Cannery
Theatre.
