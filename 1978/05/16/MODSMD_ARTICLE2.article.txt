# Blue jeans, denims on campus today; part of Gay Freedom Day celebration

Today is Blue Jeans Day. But it's not
a tribute to the man who made Levis
famous. It's part of Gay Freedom Day
at Stanford.
"We encourage gay people to
wear levis, denims, whatever," said
Gay People's Union (GPU) member
Ben Schalit.
"We're not saying straights should
or shouldn't wear jeans, but if people
want to understand what it is to be
gay, one way is to wear blue jeans
and have others wonder about you,"
he added.
GPU member Sheila O'Rourke
said the day is a "consciousness
raising thing, it gets people wonder
ing and thinking."
There are two reasons for wearing
jeans today, CPU member Dave
Morandi said. One is "to show
people we're here," especially to
show gays they aren't alone. It's edu
cational for everyone else, he added,
saying gays are "people everybody
knows."
Blue Jeans Day is part of Gay Free
dom Day, originally set aside to
commemorate the police raid on a
gay bar that many consider to be the
beginning of the gay liberation
movement in late |une 1969.
But since most students are on va
cation by late |une, Morandi said the
GPU decided to hold Gay Freedom
Day today.
Other activities planned for the
day include a noon concert with
Gwen Avery, a lesbian singer and
songwriter, and a speech tonight by
San Francisco State Prof. Sally
Gearhart.
Gay Freedom Day is sponsored by
the GPU, which calls itself "a place
where gay people can meet and
realize that being gay does not mean
being alone or having to hide."
The GPU, according to a GPU ad
hoc publication, is "a positive, sup
portive community in which gay and
bisexual men and women can share
their concerns in an atmosphere of
pride, trust and respect."

GPU members estimate that about
10 per cent of the Stanford commun
ity is gay, based on estimates of the
entire U.S. population.
Schalit said GPU has roughly 200
members. A core group of about 50
attend CPU's Thursday night discus
sion and social sessions.
The amount of student participa
tion in the GPU has quadrupled this
year, according to GPU member Ar
thur Slepian.
"We organized the gay community
more effectively this year," he said.
Gay men and women are available
at the Bridge as peer counselors,
Morandi said. The counseling ses
sions give gay people a place, to go, to
talk, and to discuss issues related to
being gay, he added.
Morandi said the 12 counselors
talk to about five students per week,
both by phone and in person.
In addition, for a number of years
GPU has been doing dorm out
reaches, Morandi said. Several gay
people go to various campus dorms
and residences by invitation, to talk
about being gay.
"Our reception this year has been
very good," Slepian said.
"It's a change from other years,"
Morandi added. "Straights and gays
alike are interested in finding out
what's going on and why gay issues
have been so much in the news."
Also this year, GPU members have
passed out several student ques
tionnaires.
Morandi said the responses have
helped give an indication of campus
acceptance of gay people.
"If individuals are asked whether
they would accept a gay person in
their dorm, the answer is usually
yes," Morandi said. However, most
students asked whether they
thought the dorm as a whole would
accept a gay reply that dorm reaction
would be negative.
"There is a real split on the indi
vidual level," Morandi added.
People think they are liberal. Yet in
groups, attitudes are often hostile

toward gays, he said. People make
gay jokes and are careful not to be
associated with gays, he added.
But Stanford is still a better place
than most universities for gay
people, according to GPU members
interviewed.
Morandi said there is at least a
"veneer of liberalism" here. Almost
everyone supports gay rights on the
surface, he said, in the samp way
there is surface support for the black
civil rights movement.
Yet straights are uncomfortable
with gays around, he added.
The gay community is strong here,
Slepian added, making Stanford a
better place than most.
"At times when you need support,
the people are here," he said.
GPU helps provide this support,
according to Schalit, especially for
gays in the process of "coming out."
The first step in "coming out," ac
cording to Morandi, "is telling other
gay people that you are gay, and for
many that is the whole process."
But since the beginnings of the gay
liberation movement about 10 years
ago, the second step has included
telling "everyone," Morandi said.
"Coming out" is not just one big
step, it's a series of small steps taken
to adjust oneself to being gay, Schalit
said.
"Its a life-long process," O'Rourke
added.
The counselors at the Bridge
mostly see people in the process of
"coming out"; gays who have de
cided they are gay and don't know
who to tell, Morandi said.
He added at the start of his own
"coming out," he told several
straight friends, but didn't know any
gay people. Meeting other gays
through the GPU turned out to be a
"liberalizing process," he said. Gays
often have a real fear of meeting
other gay people and they turn out to
be people we like, he said.
Coming out also means develop
ing a "sense of self," according to
O'Rourke, which the counselors at

the Bridge help develop.
O'Rourke said she moved off cam
pus to live with a group of gay
women when she began to "come
out."
"I was so paranoid for two years,
but I found coming out didn't make a
difference, I still have all the same
friends, my job is public," she said.
O'Rourke said for women, being
gay means learning to lead a life
without men.
Morandi said for men, being gay
includes learning how to have an
equal relationship, learning to share
the processes that are divided by sex
roles in heterosexual relationships.
