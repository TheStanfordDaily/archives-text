Moro's party gains in elections
Rome — Italy's Christian Democrats scored sweeping
gains yesterday in local elections, gathering strength
from a voter backlash to the kidnap-murder of former
Premier Aldo Moro and other terror attacks by left-wing
extremists.
Reversing a move toward the left registered in the 1976
national elections, Italians gave the Christian Democrats
42.5 per cent of the vote while the Communists slumped
to 26.5 per cent — a drop of 9.1 per cent from the 1976
results.
Violence continued as ballots were being cast in more
than 800 municipalities.
An auto company official was shot and seriously
wounded yesterday morning in Bologna by members of
the Red Brigades — the same group that killed Moro,
who also was president of the Christian Democrat Party.
The Bologna executive was the eighth victim of terrorist
gunmen in 10 days.
The Christian Democrat Party— led by Moro until his
kidnapping and assassination by the Red Brigades —
appeared to be raking in a strong sympathy vote, while

the Communists seemed to be losing support of voters
who associated the leftist party with the radical-Marxist
terrorists.
Ironically the Communists, parliamentary partners
with the ruling Christian Democrats, had joined the
government in its rejection of Red Brigades demands
that jailed terrorists be freed in exchange for Moro. The
bullet-riddled body of the former premier, who was
kidnapped in a Rome street ambush March 16, was
found in Rome last Tuesday.
Orlov allowed defense statement

me speak," Irina Orlov quoted her husband as saying.
The trial was closed to foreign reporters.
Irina Orlov, who was allowed to attend with her two
sons, told reporters outside the courthouse her hus
band was accused of sending slanderous information to
Western embassies and correspondents and getting
paid for it.
Irina Orlov said her husband, founder of the "Hel
sinki" human rights group, defended himself by saying
he was motivated by humanitarian and not political con
cerns.
Yuri Orlov founded the group to uphold the provi
sions of the Helsinki Agreement, a statement signed in
1975 by 33 nations that froze postwar European borders
and supported human rights.
Rebels invade Zaire, take two cities
London — An invasion army of 4000 exiled tribesmen is
driving toward the heart of Zaire's south-eastern Shaba
province after seizing two towns from government
troops, according to reports reaching Belgium and
Zambia yesterday.
In Washington, the State Department said it was con
sidering evacuating the estimated 100 American citizens
in the area of the fighting. In Brussels, the Belgian
Foreign Ministry said the Americans and Belgians in the
region were unharmed.
Reliable Belgian sources in Brussels said the invading
katangans who crossed into Zaire from Zambia late last
week had taken the copper-mining city of Kolwezi, 25

Moro's party gains in elections
Rome — Italy's Christian Democrats scored sweeping
gains yesterday in local elections, gathering strength
from a voter backlash to the kidnap-murder of former
Premier Aldo Moro and other terror attacks by left-wing
extremists.
Reversing a move toward the left registered in the 1976
national elections, Italians gave the Christian Democrats
42.5 per cent of the vote while the Communists slumped
to 26.5 per cent — a drop of 9.1 per cent from the 1976
results.
Violence continued as ballots were being cast in more
than 800 municipalities.
An auto company official was shot and seriously
wounded yesterday morning in Bologna by members of
the Red Brigades — the same group that killed Moro,
who also was president of the Christian Democrat Party.
The Bologna executive was the eighth victim of terrorist
gunmen in 10 days.
The Christian Democrat Party— led by Moro until his
kidnapping and assassination by the Red Brigades —
appeared to be raking in a strong sympathy vote, while

the Communists seemed to be losing support of voters
who associated the leftist party with the radical-Marxist
terrorists.
Ironically the Communists, parliamentary partners
with the ruling Christian Democrats, had joined the
government in its rejection of Red Brigades demands
that jailed terrorists be freed in exchange for Moro. The
bullet-riddled body of the former premier, who was
kidnapped in a Rome street ambush March 16, was
found in Rome last Tuesday.

he was motivated by humanitarian and not political con
