# New offices near completion; scholars move into Hoover
## 
### Andrea James 
Research fellows tired of their
cramped offices in Hoover Tower
have begun to move into the un
finished but spacious offices in the
new Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building.
With dedication ceremonies plan
ned for mid-July, the Memorial Build
ing and two Hoover pavilions are al
most completed. Not all of the furni
ture has arrived and a few finishing
touches are being added to the in
teriors of the structures, according to
George Marotta, public relations
coordinator at Hoover Institution.
Nevertheless, some Hoover scho
lars are working in their new offices
amid stray pieces of furniture,
cardboard cartons and carpet scraps.
Marotta said staff members who
were forced to rent office space out
side the campus because of the to
wer's overcrowded conditions will
now be able to return to the institu
tion.
"Some of the scholars were rent
ing space on the other side of the
hospital on Welch Road," Marotta
said.
He added none of the offices in the
institution will be rented out to
non-Hoover affiliates.
Marotta said the scholars "had a lot
to say" about which offices were as
signed to which scholars.
The lowest floor of the three-story
Memorial Building north wing will be
used for storing and receiving arc
hive shipments. Marotta said arc
hives have been received there since
May although document fumigation
has not yet begun.
The lowest floor of the building's
south wing will house the Hoover In
stitution Press, now located in the
ground floor of Hoover Tower.
Above-ground floors of both

wings will hold research offices,
domestic studies research areas and
a domestic studies library. The build
ing also contains a large meeting
room and smaller seminar rooms.
The two pavilions contain archival
reading and display rooms and a
commons area where "younger
scholars can exchange views daily
with such persons as Milton Fried
man and Sidney Hook," according to
Marotta.
The interior design of the new

structures is done primarily in wood
and earth-toned accents.
The changes and expansions will
allow the Center for Research in In
ternational Studies to move into the
Hoover Tower quarters, Marotta
said. The center is now located near
the row houses.
The expansion project cost ap
proximately $9 million and was
funded through a federal grant and
private sources.
