# New federal guidelines
## U.S. research funding in doubt 
### Peter Brett 
"lf the cost principles in the new
OMB (U.S. Office of Management
and Budget) guidelines are not
changed, this is going to be a very
different institution than it is now,"
said Frank Riddle, the University's
associate controller.
The federal costing guidelines,
announced March 10, have been the
subject of a good deal of concern
here and at other research institu
tions, according to Prof. Gerald
Lieberman, vice provost and dean for
research.
"It's quite a serious issue," he said.
According to Riddle, if the prop
osed changes in guidelines for uni
versity contracts and grants are en
forced strictly, the University stands
to lose "at least $7.5 million" in fed
eral grants.
Officials here contend the propos
als deny an equitable recovery of lib
rary costs related to research, pro
hibit reimbursement for the
research-related share of student
service costs and make it substan

tially more expensive for principal
investigators to involve students in
research.
Changes in these three areas alone
would cost the University $4.5 mill
ion annually, the officials said.
The OMB has given University of
ficials until )une 15 to submit final
comments on the proposed
guidelines. Riddle is one of four
members of a task force of the na
tional Committee on Governmental
Relations charged with preparing the
official response for OMB.
The task force met with OMB
members May 4 in Washington. "We
met for a Clarification of intent in
their publication," said Riddle.
"They seemed open to rewording
where their intent was different than
stated. A lot of our comments will be
based on what was written versus
what was said."
Riddle says an example of the con
fusion is that while the agency claims
to be in favor of allowing universities
to recover the full cost of funded re
search, it is not permitting reim
bursement for certain student ser

vices.
"Graduate students who are re
search assistants can get just as sick
while doing research as while teach
ing a class," Riddle says, but "the
written proposals disallow recovery"
for medical expenses.
Riddle pointed to another exam
ple. "In one section," he said, "they
tell how we can purchase capital as
sessments for research projects, but
they won't allow us the interest from
borrowing the money to buy them.
It's cheaper for the government if we
buy; it's just not quite equitable to
the institution."
In this case, "their (the OMB's) in
tent was not the way we interpreted it
from the words," Riddle said, "but
on this point we're responding to
what the words say, and we're noting
what OMB has said personally.
"Ultimately we'll have to live with
the (written) words."
Lieberman said that, after interpre
tations have been worked out, "I
don't think it'll cost us $7.5 million.
"But even if it's a half or third of it,
it's a terribly large number."
