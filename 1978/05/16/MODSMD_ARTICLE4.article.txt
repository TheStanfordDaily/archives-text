# Bakke decision's effect on minority admissions uncertain
## 
### Emily Sachar 
Regardless of the decision by
the Supreme Court in the Bakke
case which may be handed down
this week, top administrators say
it is difficult to know how minority
admission decisions here will be
affected.
The case, Allan Bakke v. Univer
sity of California Board of Re
gents, was heard in oral argument
on Oct. 12, 1977 by the U.S. Sup
reme Court.
Bakke filed suit against UC-
Davis after being denied admis
sion to its medical school. Bakke
demanded he be admitted be
cause an unconstitutional special
admission program for minorities
had prevented him from gaining
admission.
The California State Supreme
Court ruled, after appeal by Bakke
and the University of California,
that the special admission prog
ram did discrimate against whites,
but a medical school admission
was still denied to Bakke.
Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig said there is a
need for experimentation in ad
missions processes. Colleges
want to achieve both a qualified

student body and want to over
come racial discrimination. The
Bakke decision will affect the ba
lance between these two goals, he
said.
No discriminatory phrases
Rosenzweig added that the sol
ution to the race problem in this
country is not to build dis
criminatory or sanctioning
phrases regarding race into the
U.S. Constitution.
The most devastating and
damaging decision the Court
could make would be to say
categorically that consideration of
race was unconstitutional,
Rosenzweig said.
The effect of such a ruling
would be to allow universities to
deny admission to more
minorities than they have been
with affirmative action programs,
he said.
W. Bliss Carnochan, dean of
graduate studies, said he also
hopes for a somewhat ambiguous
decision that "would leave us
elbow room."
"There are lots of ways of doing
affirmative action on the graduate
admissions level without impos
ing a quota system," he added.

"The most dangerous thing the
Court could do would be to say or
imply that standardized tests and
test scores were a single criterion
for admission. Totally objective
criteria would not be a good thing
for affirmative action," Car
nochan said.
Medical school spokesmen said
their affirmative action plans
could be upset by certain Sup
reme Court decisions. The medj
cal school has met its goal of 20
per cent minority admissions over
the last five years, according to
James McClenahan, chairman of
the Medical School Minority Ad
missions Committee.
"If the Court makes race an un
acceptable criteria and sets up
new criteria for minority status
such as the quality of an individu
al's secondary school education,
there would be a dilution of the
minority pool," McClenahan said.
This would occur because dis
advantaged whites might be con
sidered part of the school's 20 per
cent quota. Fewer minority stu
dents would then be needed to fill
the pool, according to McClena
han.


About 80 Stanford students accompanied over 3000
people at a rally and march protesting the Bakke deci
sion in San Francisco on Saturday. The march ended at

the Federal Building at Golden Park Street and Polk
Street.
"But the best thing is to let each
school set its own criteria for ad
mission. We will continue to do
the good job we have in the past.
Stanford's medical school has the
best affirmative action record of
any white-predominated med
school in the country," he said.
Black student sentiment here is
that the Supreme Court will prob
ably rule in favorof Bakke, accord
ing to Keith Archuleta, co
president of the Black Student
Union (BSU).

"There have been many nega
tive judicial decisions aimed at
hurting minorities in the past, and
Congress has sponsored legisla
tion aimed at hurting native
Americans. It seems like the coun
try is being thrown back because
of a few influential people who
are against affirmative action,"
Archuleta said.
Stanford will only accept the
minimum number of blacks or
other minorities necessary to en
sure federal money, according to
Archuleta.
