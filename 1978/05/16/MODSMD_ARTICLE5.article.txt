# Give trustees consideration
## SCRIP'S approach wrong 
### 
Bill England

I am very dissatisfied with SCRIP. I
dispute some of its claims of support
and its methods of action. They
exhibit a lack of common sense in
dealing with people. Both SCRIP and
the trustees have shown very little
consideration in dealing with each
other and have let emotion replace
reason and good judgement. This
breakdown in communication is not
helping anyone here or in South Af
rica.
SCRIP'S cause is undisputably
worthy; apartheid is unjust and
wrong. SCRIP has served to increase
awareness of apartheid and should
be congratulated for those efforts.
But, their methods and their rhetoric
reek of yellow journalism and com
mon propaganda. Is their concern
over South Africa humanitarian ef
forts toward social justice or mere
political sensationalism?
After growing up in rural lowa, I've
learned that one can catch far more
flies with honey than with gall. Vet
SCRIP persists in offering the trus
tees mandates covered with gall, and
then protests when they don't smil
ingly accept it. Threats may sound
dramatic, but they will not make the
trustees any more cooperative and
will not help anyone in South Africa.
Commands uncalled for
SCRIP insists on telling the trustees
they are wrong; admittedly, SCRIP
may be right. But implying that the
trustees are fools and denigrating
their intelligence is not the" way to
gain their cooperation. SCRIP shows
no respect for the trustees' values,
concerns, or opinions and SCRIP
only condemns what the trustees
have done or said.
•No matter how wrong SCRIP feels
the trustees are, they must accept
and carefully consider the trustees'
positions, then ask serious, non
rhetorical questions, rather than giv
ing the trustees direct orders and
empty ultimatums. Commands are
not conducive to discussion. Any
common ground and a compromise
is far more beneficial than nothing at
all.
SCRIP must try to see things from
the trustees' point of view. The trus
tees are charged with directing the
University as their first responsibil
ity, and then saving the world. SCRIP
does not deal with ramifications of
investment policy, such as how any
monetary loss from divestment
would affect the already tight situa
tion of financial aids for needy stu
dents.
Don't harass trustees
SCRIP, obviously, should not
harass the trustees. For example, the

orange flyer with the subtle compari
son of the trustees fo dinosaurs and
listing their home phone numbers
was juvenile, discourteous, and
counterproductive. Everyone has the
right to be free from harrassment,
and anyone would resent a similar
gesture directed towards them.
The trustees deserve to be treated
as mature human beings, no matter
how infuriated SCRIP becomes. They
have been far more courteous to
SCRIP than vice versa. Why should
they respect an organization that is
so abusive? SCRIP should not be sur
prised by President Richard Lyman's
"piece of paper" remark, when in
the same leaflet they say "it is dis
honesty, belying Lyman's claim to
membership in an intellectual com
munity."
SCRIP also appears hypocritical.
For instance, they claim the trustees
"don't have the facts." And admit
tedly, SCRIP has done far more re
search into South Africa. But how do
they know, and why should the trus
tees believe, that SCRIP actually
knows all the facts — does anyone
really understand completely?
Who has answers
SCRIP also stated that the trustees
"feel they know more than . . . mill
ions of black South Africans." I'm
curious, does SCRIP know more than
millions of black South Africans? I'm
sure they desire freedom, but what
else? And at what cost? Should SCRIP
decide for them?
I'm also curious about the per
sonal involvement of the SCRIP, and
how many of them are benefitting
from South Africa. How many of
them have parents working for com
panies involved in South Africa, or
own investments in these com
panies? Are they paying for Stanford
on profits from apartheid? And how
many people in SCRIP have a Texaco
credit card, a Bank of America check
ing account, BankAmericard, or use
Kodak film?
Show personal sacrifice
And before they blame the 50 per
cent mortality rate on the trustees,
I'd like to see them sell their cars and
live simpler lifestyles, donating the
money to help these children. Per
sonal sacrifice would help the trus
tees to consider making Stanford
sacrifice. And why are they so ready
to spend our money by being ar
rested for breaking laws which have
nothing to do with South Africa?
Do they really believe this is the
best way to attract positive attention
to a problem in South Africa, or do
they just crave the personal publicity

and need to feed their self
righteousness by physically barring
secretaries from their offices?
No authority
SCRIP has time and again claimed
to speak for the Stanford commun
ity, with no right or authorization to
do so. I'm a member of the Stanford
community and they sure as hell
don't speak for me. Considering only
20 per cent of students voted on
SCRIP'S referendum, and two-thirds
as many voted "no" as voted "yes,"
SCRIP can hardly claim a mandate
from the people.
SCRIP'S cause is just and impor
tant. This alone makes it worthwhile
to forget appearances and strive for
any concrete results. Whether or not
SCRIP can do this depends on if
they're more interested in helping
South Africans or in their image as
freedom fighters and headlines in he
Daily.
SCRIP needs to cool off and try
some common sense and considera
tion. They must treat the trustees as
they would have the trustees treat
them. SCRIP states "this isn't a de
bate between reasonable people."
They can help make it.so.

son of the trustees fo dinosaurs and
listing their home phone numbers
was juvenile, discourteous, and
counterproductive. Everyone has the
right to be free from harrassment,
and anyone would resent a similar
gesture directed towards them.
The trustees deserve to be treated
as mature human beings, no matter
how infuriated SCRIP becomes. They
have been far more courteous to
SCRIP than vice versa. Why should
they respect an organization that is
so abusive? SCRIP should not be sur
prised by President Richard Lyman's
"piece of paper" remark, when in
the same leaflet they say "it is dis
honesty, belying Lyman's claim to
membership in an intellectual com
munity."
SCRIP also appears hypocritical.
For instance, they claim the trustees
"don't have the facts." And admit
tedly, SCRIP has done far more re
search into South Africa. But how do
they know, and why should the trus
tees believe, that SCRIP actually
knows all the facts — does anyone
really understand completely?
Who has answers
SCRIP also stated that the trustees
"feel they know more than . . . mill
ions of black South Africans." I'm
curious, does SCRIP know more than
millions of black South Africans? I'm
sure they desire freedom, but what
else? And at what cost? Should SCRIP
decide for them?
I'm also curious about the per
sonal involvement of the SCRIP, and
how many of them are benefitting
from South Africa. How many of
them have parents working for com
panies involved in South Africa, or
own investments in these com
panies? Are they paying for Stanford
on profits from apartheid? And how
many people in SCRIP have a Texaco
credit card, a Bank of America check
ing account, BankAmericard, or use
Kodak film?
Show personal sacrifice
And before they blame the 50 per
cent mortality rate on the trustees,
I'd like to see them sell their cars and
live simpler lifestyles, donating the
money to help these children. Per
sonal sacrifice would help the trus
tees to consider making Stanford
sacrifice. And why are they so ready
to spend our money by being ar
rested for breaking laws which have
nothing to do with South Africa?
Do they really believe this is the
best way to attract positive attention
to a problem in South Africa, or do
they just crave the personal publicity

and need to feed their self
righteousness by physically barring
secretaries from their offices?
No authority
SCRIP has time and again claimed
to speak for the Stanford commun
ity, with no right or authorization to
do so. I'm a member of the Stanford
community and they sure as hell
don't speak for me. Considering only
20 per cent of students voted on
SCRIP'S referendum, and two-thirds
as many voted "no" as voted "yes,"
SCRIP can hardly claim a mandate
from the people.
SCRIP'S cause is just and impor
tant. This alone makes it worthwhile
to forget appearances and strive for
any concrete results. Whether or not
SCRIP can do this depends on if
they're more interested in helping
South Africans or in their image as
freedom fighters and headlines in he
Daily.
SCRIP needs to cool off and try
some common sense and considera
tion. They must treat the trustees as
they would have the trustees treat
them. SCRIP states "this isn't a de
bate between reasonable people."
They can help make it.so.

I am very dissatisfied with SCRIP. I
dispute some of its claims of support
and its methods of action. They
exhibit a lack of common sense in
dealing with people. Both SCRIP and
the trustees have shown very little
consideration in dealing with each
other and have let emotion replace
reason and good judgement. This
breakdown in communication is not
helping anyone here or in South Af
rica.
SCRIP'S cause is undisputably
worthy; apartheid is unjust and
wrong. SCRIP has served to increase
awareness of apartheid and should
be congratulated for those efforts.
But, their methods and their rhetoric
reek of yellow journalism and com
mon propaganda. Is their concern
over South Africa humanitarian ef
forts toward social justice or mere
political sensationalism?
After growing up in rural lowa, I've
learned that one can catch far more
flies with honey than with gall. Vet
SCRIP persists in offering the trus
tees mandates covered with gall, and
then protests when they don't smil
ingly accept it. Threats may sound
dramatic, but they will not make the
trustees any more cooperative and
will not help anyone in South Africa.
Commands uncalled for
SCRIP insists on telling the trustees
they are wrong; admittedly, SCRIP
may be right. But implying that the
trustees are fools and denigrating
their intelligence is not the" way to
gain their cooperation. SCRIP shows
no respect for the trustees' values,
concerns, or opinions and SCRIP
only condemns what the trustees
have done or said.
•No matter how wrong SCRIP feels
the trustees are, they must accept
and carefully consider the trustees'
positions, then ask serious, non
rhetorical questions, rather than giv
ing the trustees direct orders and
empty ultimatums. Commands are
not conducive to discussion. Any
common ground and a compromise
is far more beneficial than nothing at
all.
SCRIP must try to see things from
the trustees' point of view. The trus
tees are charged with directing the
University as their first responsibil
ity, and then saving the world. SCRIP
does not deal with ramifications of
investment policy, such as how any
monetary loss from divestment
would affect the already tight situa
tion of financial aids for needy stu
dents.
