### 
Peter Nye

Accepting your gay feelings and
revealing them to other people in
your life is a slow, frightening, and
yet exhilarating process. It is a decla
ration of self-respect, indepen
dence, and freedom in a world which
is attempting to keep them from you.
Here is a composite of experiences
gay women and men have had com
ing out at Stanford:
The internal struggle
— You escape from a small mid
western town and come to California
to find freedom, only to find your
freshperson dorm has about the
same opinion of faggots as your high
school class had.
— After months of feeling that you
must be the only gay person on cam
pus, you notice another man looking
at you. You panic, and walk quickly
the other way. <•
— You fall in love with your room
mate and spend the next half year in
agony, because you are afraid that if
he finds out, he won't associate with
you any more.
— You try to be straight. You con
vince vourself that you are falling in
love with a woman in your dorm. It
becomes clear that the relationship
isn't going to work, but you can't tell
her why.
First ventures out
— You want desparately to meet
other Lesbians. You finally work up
the courage to walk intoCPU,only to
find out it is Men's Night.
— You tell your roommate. She
moves out, word gets out, and you
suddenly find it very difficult to find a
replacement.
— You pace back and forth across
the street from GPU every Tuesday
night for two quarters. You finally go
in, petrified because for the first time
in your life, there will be other
people who will know you are gay.
You find that the woman who sits
next to you in your math class is
there, as well as several other people
you know.
— You tell your roommate. She
says she's known all along, and she's
glad you finally decided to start ac
cepting yourself.
— You try to come out to a friend,
but whenever you bring up the sub
ject of homosexuality, she changes
the subject.
Reactions
— On your way out of a CPU meet
ing, you are threatened with an iron
pipe by two drunks, who call you a

stinking faggot. Later they claim you
were trying to molest them.
— You find that at parties, men are
continually coming up and asking
you to dance, because "We hate to
see you two girls dancing all by your
selves."
— You are afraid your advisor will
find out, because you think you
probably won't get your Ph.D. if he
does.
— You have problems with finding
a place for you and your lover of five
years to live. You are told that the
housing in Escondido Village is for
married couples only.
— A group of men attack you ver
bally in the Coffee House for sitting
too close toyourwoman friend. They

then proceed to discuss your proba
ble sexual orientation in loudvoices.
— After spending most of your life
watching straight couples being af
fectionate, you are accused of being
blatant for holding hands with your
lover.
Cay people are everywhere
— You quit a woman's CR group
because only relationships with men
are discussed. You find out later that
more than half the group are Les
bians.
— You are afraid that your room
mate will find out about your being
involved with a woman. Later you
find out that she had broken up with
the same woman the year before.
— You are at a party with your

lover, and are afraid to dante with
her because one of your co-workers
is there, until you notice him dancing
with another man.
— Vou go to the Gay Freedom Day
Parade in the city. After years of
being surrounded by straights, there
are nothing but people like you as far
as you can see.
— A student comes to see you for
counselling at the Bridge. He says
you're the only other gay person he
has ever met. You remember what it
was like to be alone, and think that
no one should ever have to go
through that again.

ject of homosexuality, she changes
the subject.

Accepting your gay feelings and
revealing them to other people in
your life is a slow, frightening, and
yet exhilarating process. It is a decla
ration of self-respect, indepen
dence, and freedom in a world which
is attempting to keep them from you.
Here is a composite of experiences
gay women and men have had com
ing out at Stanford:
The internal struggle
— You escape from a small mid
western town and come to California
to find freedom, only to find your
freshperson dorm has about the
same opinion of faggots as your high
school class had.
— After months of feeling that you
must be the only gay person on cam
pus, you notice another man looking
at you. You panic, and walk quickly
the other way. <•
— You fall in love with your room
mate and spend the next half year in
agony, because you are afraid that if
he finds out, he won't associate with
you any more.
— You try to be straight. You con
vince vourself that you are falling in
love with a woman in your dorm. It
becomes clear that the relationship
isn't going to work, but you can't tell
her why.
First ventures out
— You want desparately to meet
other Lesbians. You finally work up
the courage to walk intoCPU,only to
find out it is Men's Night.
— You tell your roommate. She
moves out, word gets out, and you
suddenly find it very difficult to find a
replacement.
— You pace back and forth across
the street from GPU every Tuesday
night for two quarters. You finally go
in, petrified because for the first time
in your life, there will be other
people who will know you are gay.
You find that the woman who sits
next to you in your math class is
there, as well as several other people
you know.
— You tell your roommate. She
says she's known all along, and she's
glad you finally decided to start ac
cepting yourself.
— You try to come out to a friend,
but whenever you bring up the sub
ject of homosexuality, she changes
the subject.
