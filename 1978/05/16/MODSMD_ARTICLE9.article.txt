Alternative to postering
I would like to let your readers
know about one alternative to illegal
postering on campus (Daily, May 11).
The Tresidder Information Center
maintains a master calendar of
events, which has listings up to two
years in advance (believe it or not,
some groups plan that far ahead!).
In addition, we make a daily cam
pus events tape (497-J880) and have a
certain amount of posting space for
flyers (it's small right now, but we're
looking to expand it in the near fu
ture). .
We get hundreds of calls each
week from people wanting to know
what'sgoing on around campus, and
if groups planning an event would
call and let us know, we'd be happy
to act as an information agent for
them in this way. As space and time
permit, we can sometimes display
flyers and list events on the tape re
cording as well.
Any- group planning an event on
campus may call the Information
Center at 497-4311 between Bam and
noon, or drop by the second floor of
Tresidder Union. Oh, and by the
way, please don't put any posters on
the walls — they'll only be torn
down.

Reasoned debate needed
I wish to express my concern at the
level of public debate regarding the
South' Africa issue at Stanford. At a
meeting at Bishop Auditorium on
May 9, I listened to an account by a
South African women who claimed,
amid copious tears, that Africans
pray for American divestment from
South Africa;
— White South African soldiers
made a practice of tearing open the
wombs of pregnant Bantu women,
and using embryos for target prac
tice.
— White oppression occasioned
the death of a third of all Bantu in
fants who died of malnutrition.
As regards divestment,. South Af
rica supplies the bulk of its capital
from domestically generated
sources. Foreign investment now ac
counts for only a small proportion of
total South African investment. The
South African authorities in fact en
courage indigenous South African
companies to increase their holdings
in foreign-owned companies.
Seen in Marxist terms, divestment
— if effective — must "objectively"
further strengthen the indigenous
South African bourgoisie, by enabl
ing them to extend to purchase stock
at artificially lowered prices.
As regards the second charge,
even militant critics of South Africa,
including respected bodies such as
Amnesty International and the South
African Institute for Race Relations,

have never accused the South Afri
can army of atrocities of the kind
listed under this charge. Perhaps the
speaker nas confused the South Afri
can army with the soldiery of Burundi
or Uganda
As regards the last charge, South
Africa's black population has one of
the highest rates of increase in the
world, amounting to 2.78 per cent in
1975. (In absolute numbers, the Afri
can population stood at 11,578,000 in
1960; and 17.823.000 in 1975; it is ex
pected to increase to 27,892,000
by 1990.) Life expectation for African
men increased from 39.58 years
(1935-40) to 51.16 (1965-1970); the
corresponding figures for African
women were 40.46 and 58.93.
Health care has made considerable
progress both in the cities and in the
homelands.
Nevertheless, the aforementioned
women speaker received a standing
ovation from what purports to be a
highly educated audience, schooled
in the critical and dispassionate
evaluation of facts. As I walked out I
understood why, in 1914, millions of
Englishmen could be made to be
lieve the most ludicrous atrocity
charges against the Germans, and
why, in 1933, millions of Germans
could be made to accept even more
ludicrous accusations against the
lews.

Africa's black population has one of
the highest rates of increase in the
world, amounting to 2.78 per cent in
1975. (In absolute numbers, the Afri
can population stood at 11,578,000 in
1960; and 17.823.000 in 1975; it is ex
pected to increase to 27,892,000
by 1990.) Life expectation for African
men increased from 39.58 years
(1935-40) to 51.16 (1965-1970); the
corresponding figures for African
women were 40.46 and 58.93.
Health care has made considerable
progress both in the cities and in the
homelands.
Nevertheless, the aforementioned
women speaker received a standing
ovation from what purports to be a
highly educated audience, schooled
in the critical and dispassionate
evaluation of facts. As I walked out I
understood why, in 1914, millions of
Englishmen could be made to be
lieve the most ludicrous atrocity
charges against the Germans, and
why, in 1933, millions of Germans
could be made to accept even more
ludicrous accusations against the
lews.

Alternative to postering
I would like to let your readers
know about one alternative to illegal
postering on campus (Daily, May 11).
The Tresidder Information Center
maintains a master calendar of
events, which has listings up to two
years in advance (believe it or not,
some groups plan that far ahead!).
In addition, we make a daily cam
pus events tape (497-J880) and have a
certain amount of posting space for
flyers (it's small right now, but we're
looking to expand it in the near fu
ture). .
We get hundreds of calls each
week from people wanting to know
what'sgoing on around campus, and
if groups planning an event would
call and let us know, we'd be happy
to act as an information agent for
them in this way. As space and time
permit, we can sometimes display
flyers and list events on the tape re
cording as well.
Any- group planning an event on
campus may call the Information
Center at 497-4311 between Bam and
noon, or drop by the second floor of
Tresidder Union. Oh, and by the
way, please don't put any posters on
the walls — they'll only be torn
down.

Reasoned debate needed
I wish to express my concern at the
level of public debate regarding the
South' Africa issue at Stanford. At a
meeting at Bishop Auditorium on
May 9, I listened to an account by a
South African women who claimed,
amid copious tears, that Africans
pray for American divestment from
South Africa;
— White South African soldiers
made a practice of tearing open the
wombs of pregnant Bantu women,
and using embryos for target prac
tice.
— White oppression occasioned
the death of a third of all Bantu in
fants who died of malnutrition.
As regards divestment,. South Af
rica supplies the bulk of its capital
from domestically generated
sources. Foreign investment now ac
counts for only a small proportion of
total South African investment. The
South African authorities in fact en
courage indigenous South African
companies to increase their holdings
in foreign-owned companies.
Seen in Marxist terms, divestment
— if effective — must "objectively"
further strengthen the indigenous
South African bourgoisie, by enabl
ing them to extend to purchase stock
at artificially lowered prices.
As regards the second charge,
even militant critics of South Africa,
including respected bodies such as
Amnesty International and the South
African Institute for Race Relations,

have never accused the South Afri
can army of atrocities of the kind
listed under this charge. Perhaps the
speaker nas confused the South Afri
can army with the soldiery of Burundi
or Uganda
As regards the last charge, South
Africa's black population has one of
the highest rates of increase in the
world, amounting to 2.78 per cent in
1975. (In absolute numbers, the Afri
can population stood at 11,578,000 in
