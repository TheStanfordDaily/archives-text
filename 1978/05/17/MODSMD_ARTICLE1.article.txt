# 'Sounds' Supplement
## Play for themselves La 						Honda bar offers unique jam sessions 
### Nancy Rivenburgh 
Rhythmic guitar strumming filters through the old log cabin
bar. The smooth, musical progressions blend well with around
the-bar conversation. Soon another guitar begins picking its way
through the air; a little bluegrass to step up the tempo. Toes are
tapping.
Heads turn toward the circle of solemn-faced musicians in
front of the stone fireplace. A large deer head listens from the
wall above. A young woman in the circle starts to play her mando
lin.
Suddenly lively banjo music pierces the air. The crowd grins
from torn bar stools. Toes tap harder and a few musicians nod and
then exchange soft whines of country lyrics.
"I'm still thinking of you and feeling so blue about why I left
you behind . . ."
As if in reply, the bartender reaches down and pulls out his
violin. Sweet, longing notes speak in a final country crescendo
with the other instruments.
It's Thursday night at Boots and Saddles bar in La Honda and
the interveaving of string music is the "Locals Jam Session."
Each week these local musicians gather to share, learn and
reminisce within the realms of country, folk and bluegrass music.
And the music is mesmerizing. It's played with swift, skilled
fingers, intense with feeling, yet created by expressionless faces.
The large circle of exceptional talent seems phenomenal for a
town whose population is only 500, but one La Honda resident,
Faith, tells us, "What's most important is the atmosphere."
Innumerable plaid shirts, jeans and boots depict that easy
going country aura of La Honda.
Boots and Saddles bar, itself, provides that country atmos
phere which spawns music like "Steel Guitar Rag" and "Your
Cheatin' Heart."
Old lassoes and lanterns hang from large steer horns above the
dusty piano. A few faded paintings and beer ads litter the walls
and, of course, a miniature leather boot and saddle hang directly
above the bar.
Some of the musicians who meet on Locals Jam Night play in
other bands, most do not. But together they talk tirelessly for
hours by means of only music.
"If you're listening you don't have to talk," says Gail, who
expertly plays the mandolin and guitar, "It's just fun to play."
Yet the music sounds so perfected. Leads move naturally from
guitar to mandolin to banjo to fiddle back to steel guitar without
ever a spoken word except age-old folk and country verse.
"But the music's different every time, "another musician, Jerry,
says, and be begins to play and sweetly sing a new "old" folk song
for the others to learn — although no learning process ever
seems to occur for within moments the guitar on his right has
taken over with a quick-playing lead well complimented by the
other musicians — and thus the song and the evening progress.
Dan, the bartender and owner of Boots and Saddles, originated
the Thursday night jam sessions. His love of music is well
founded for he once performed in Carnegie Hall and has played
with the likes of Tommy Dorsey.
But Thursday's jam night at Boots and Saddles is the music of
years past; folk ballads and bluegrass melodies played with the
commitment of skillful younf musicians intent on making it their
music today.
And so the toes are tapping as the banjo winds down from a
rousing lead.
Soon all the instruments experiment, mix, then grow until the
entire bar joins in singing the final verse and the room is im
mersed in song.

Boots and Saddles bar, itself, provides that country atmos
phere which spawns music like "Steel Guitar Rag" and "Your
Cheatin' Heart."
Old lassoes and lanterns hang from large steer horns above the
dusty piano. A few faded paintings and beer ads litter the walls
and, of course, a miniature leather boot and saddle hang directly
above the bar.
Some of the musicians who meet on Locals Jam Night play in
other bands, most do not. But together they talk tirelessly for
hours by means of only music.
"If you're listening you don't have to talk," says Gail, who
expertly plays the mandolin and guitar, "It's just fun to play."
Yet the music sounds so perfected. Leads move naturally from
guitar to mandolin to banjo to fiddle back to steel guitar without
ever a spoken word except age-old folk and country verse.
"But the music's different every time, "another musician, Jerry,
says, and be begins to play and sweetly sing a new "old" folk song
for the others to learn — although no learning process ever
seems to occur for within moments the guitar on his right has
taken over with a quick-playing lead well complimented by the
other musicians — and thus the song and the evening progress.
Dan, the bartender and owner of Boots and Saddles, originated
the Thursday night jam sessions. His love of music is well
founded for he once performed in Carnegie Hall and has played
with the likes of Tommy Dorsey.
But Thursday's jam night at Boots and Saddles is the music of
years past; folk ballads and bluegrass melodies played with the
commitment of skillful younf musicians intent on making it their
music today.
And so the toes are tapping as the banjo winds down from a
rousing lead.
Soon all the instruments experiment, mix, then grow until the
entire bar joins in singing the final verse and the room is im
mersed in song.
