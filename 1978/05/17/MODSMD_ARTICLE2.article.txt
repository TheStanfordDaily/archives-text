# Stereo specs explained
## 
### Lee Tien 
Stereo systems have become
amazingly sophisticated in the
last few years. Along with the
increasingly complex technol
ogy has come an increasingly
technical language. The stereo
buyer who walks into a store
these days had better watch
out for salesman bearing too
much information.
The secret to not being
overwhelmed by salesmen's
pitches isn't closing your eyes.
It's not even flipping a coin.
Better than either of these is
checking technical specifica
tions.
Before moving into a discus
sion of some important specs,
there are a few main ideas
worth mentioning.
First, there are lots of
sounds. The deep, booming
beat that you hear from the
drums are low frequency
sounds — the bass. The sparkl

ing flute solo you might listen
to is filled with high frequen
cies — the treble. Thus, when
your stereo system is given a
musical program to play, it
plays with many frequencies.
Frequencies are measured in
hertz (Hz). Bass notes are at the
low end of the spectrum,
below 750 Hz. Treble sounds
reach frequencies as high as
18,000 or 20,000 Hz before they
become too high for us to hear.
Another point is power.
Usually measured in watts (W),
power is what makes the sys
tem work. Keep in mind that
different frequencies require
different amounts of power for
the same strength. In general,
bass consumes more power
than treble.
Volume (or sound intensity)
is measured in decibels (dßs).
An average spoken conversa
tion has a loudness of about 65
dßs, while a passing subway

registers more than 100dBs.
With this in mind, let's look
at the components of our
stereo system.
Speakers first
Speakers should beyourfirst
acquisition. If you buy a good,
powerful receiver and then (af
ter you've spent almost all your
money end up with speakers
that can't handle the power,
you'll always be worrying
about how much you can turn
up the amplifier before blow
ing out or destroying the
speakers.
What's most important
about choosing speakers is the
way they sound to you. But to
help you out, there are a few
things you ought to consider.
Efficiency is a measurement
of the speaker's ability to turn
electrical energy into sound.
The more efficient a speaker is,
the less power it will need to
