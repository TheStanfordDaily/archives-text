# Stereo specs explained

### Lee Tien 
Stereo systems have become
amazingly sophisticated in the
last few years. Along with the
increasingly complex technol
ogy has come an increasingly
technical language. The stereo
buyer who walks into a store
these days had better watch
out for salesman bearing too
much information.
The secret to not being
overwhelmed by salesmen's
pitches isn't closing your eyes.
It's not even flipping a coin.
Better than either of these is
checking technical specifica
tions.
Before moving into a discus
sion of some important specs,
there are a few main ideas
worth mentioning.
First, there are lots of
sounds. The deep, booming
beat that you hear from the
drums are low frequency
sounds — the bass. The sparkl

ing flute solo you might listen
to is filled with high frequen
cies — the treble. Thus, when
your stereo system is given a
musical program to play, it
plays with many frequencies.
Frequencies are measured in
hertz (Hz). Bass notes are at the
low end of the spectrum,
below 750 Hz. Treble sounds
reach frequencies as high as
18,000 or 20,000 Hz before they
become too high for us to hear.
Another point is power.
Usually measured in watts (W),
power is what makes the sys
tem work. Keep in mind that
different frequencies require
different amounts of power for
the same strength. In general,
bass consumes more power
than treble.
Volume (or sound intensity)
is measured in decibels (dßs).
An average spoken conversa
tion has a loudness of about 65
dßs, while a passing subway

registers more than 100dBs.
With this in mind, let's look
at the components of our
stereo system.
Speakers first
Speakers should beyourfirst
acquisition. If you buy a good,
powerful receiver and then (af
ter you've spent almost all your
money end up with speakers
that can't handle the power,
you'll always be worrying
about how much you can turn
up the amplifier before blow
ing out or destroying the
speakers.
What's most important
about choosing speakers is the
way they sound to you. But to
help you out, there are a few
things you ought to consider.
Efficiency is a measurement
of the speaker's ability to turn
electrical energy into sound.
The more efficient a speaker is,
the less power it will need to
make the same sound. The
main advantage of efficiency is
that it allows you to buy a less
powerful receiver.
Efficiency is often referred to
as sensitivity and is measured
in terms of the loudness of the
speaker at a distance of one
meter when driven by one watt
of power (dB/W/m). Measured
this way, an inefficient speaker
is rated at around 82 dBAV/m,
while an efficient speaker rates
about 93 dBAW/m. Average effi
ciency lies between these ex
tremes.
Power handling capacity will
help you maintain your
speaker life. This measure
ment, usually given in watts,
tells you how much power you
can put in your speakers be
fore they blow. Plan on using
speakers which have the capac
ity to handle your receiver's
rated power output.
Dispersion is a measure of
the loudness variation at diffe
rent angles from the speaker
face. This spec is given in the
form of a polar graph plotting
loudness versus position on a
one meter half-circle around
the speaker front. If you plan to
place your speakers in or near a
corner, this is relatively unim
portant, since the reflection off
the walls will even out the
sound.
Frequency response specs
for speakers are common, but
useless. The figures vary with
test conditions and defy com
parison. Also, while frequency
response specs on receivers
and tuners are usually correct
to within one dB (inaudible dif
ference), the same figures on
speaker specs may vary by as
much as 5 dB.
Amplifiers
After speakers, a receiver
should be the next considera
tion. The receiver takes a sig
nal, usually from a turntable or
radio station, and amplifies it
until it can drive the speakers.
There are three major specs
for receivers.
Power per channel or power
per speakers. An important
thing to remember about
power is that volume is not the
main reason you need it. Nor
mal listening levels don't use
more than three to six watts of
power.
Furthermore, because of the
way the human ear works,
doubling the power output
only increases loudness by 3
dßs. Thus, if you had a 50 watt
receiver and replaced it with a
100 watt receiver, you would
only get a 3 dB louder musical
output.
However, power will allow
you to play music louder with
less distortion. You can turn
your clock radio to a respecta
ble volume on a few watts, but
it'll sound awfully distorted.
Power is needed to reproduce
the music cleanly, if not with
more volume.
RMS and IHF
Specs will often list two
power ratings, one for con

tinuous power (watts RMS) and
one forpeak (IHF). Ignore peak
power, because when it comes
to listening, you are only con
cerned with what power the
amplifier can put out for a rela
tively long time.
Frequency response is also
important. Virtually all good
receivers have a frequency re
sponse of 20-20,000 Hz with
variations no larger than one
dB, which means that they will
reproduce all sounds in that
frequency range with no more
than a one dB loudness varia
tion.
Distortion is the third big
point. It comes in two types,
total harmonic distortion
(THD) and intermodulation
distortion (IM), both measured
in terms of percentage of the
receiver's total output. The
lower the numbers, the better.
THD is caused by the creation
of overtones of the notes. It af
fects the total coloration of the
music. IM adds new notes to
the music which are heard as
distortion.
Remember when looking at
these three specs to look at
them simultaneously. Often a
manufacturer will try to de
ceive you by quoting a great
distortion figure and a great
power output — carefully hid
ing in the fine print the fact that
the that distortion figure is fora
much lower power output.
You won't know anything then
about the receiver's perfor
mance at its rated power out
put.
Other receiver specs are less
important, but still worth
knowing about.
Signal to noise ratio
The signal to noise ratio (S/N)
indicates how much softer
noise within the receiver is
than the receiver's maximum
signal level. Stay away from
anything with less than 60 dB
S/N; the higher the figure, the
quieter the noise will be rela
tive to the music.
The damping factor refers to
the ability of the receiver to
damp, or lessen, residual
movements of the speaker
caused by inertia or other ex
traneous forces. The higher
the figure, the better; anything
over 20 is acceptable, although
good receivers may have
damping factors of up to 100.
You'll pay for anything that
good, however.
The other specs important
for receivers refer to tuner per
formance. The tuner accepts
FM and AM signals from the
antenna, demodulates them,
and puts them into a form suit
able to be amplified.
Selectivity, expressed in de
cibels, tells you how much in
terference you'll get from the
station on the dial closest to
the one you want to hear. The
higher the figure, the less in
terference. Most tuner sec
tions give you alternate chan
nel selectivity, which is for a
station two channels away.
Again, the larger the figure, the
better, and a figure of about 60
dB is not uncommon. You
should have at least 50 dB;
some go up to 100.
Selectivity (either kind) is
important in urban areas
where a lot of powerful sta
tions are crowded together.
A related spec is sensitivity
measured in microvolts. Sen
sitivity measures a tuner's abil
ity to pull in weak signals with
out unacceptable distortion.
For FM, there are two types:
usable sensitivity, the
minimum signal strength in
microvolts necessary for the
signal to be3odß stronger than
the noise; and quieting sen
sitivity, the minimum signal
necessary for a 50 dB S/N ratio.
The smaller the figure, the bet
ter.
You should have at least 3
microvolts of usable sensitivity
and 10 microvolts of quieting
sensitivity.
Sensitivity is important in
rural areas, where signals are
usually weak. In general, you
will find a trade-off between
selectivity and sensitivity.
The capture ration expres
sed in dßs, shows the tuner's
ability to distinguish between
two signals on the same fre
quency, such as two stations in
different cities, or one sta
tion's main signal and an echo
off of a tall building. Such dis
tortions are called multipath
distortions, and usually give a
fuzzy quality to the music.
This is expressed in decibels
and shows how much stronger
one signal has to be than the
other for the receiver to pick
up the stronger one and ignore
the weaker one. It should be at
least J dB, and the lower the
figure, the better.
Turntables
Turntable specs fall into two
main categories, those which
describe accuracy of speed and
those which describe tone arm
performance.
The turntable's major func
tion is to maintain a constant
speed of record rotation. The
following specs determine its
accuracy.
Wow and flutter measure
ments, usually in percentages,
tell you about variations in
speed. Wow refers to a waver
ing sound in the bass, pro
duced by slow variations in
pitch while flutter refers to
wavering in the higher fre
quencies produced by fast var
iations in pitch. The lower the
specs the better, and 0.15 per
cent should be expected.
Above $150, most turntables
have less than 0.08 per cent
flutter, a negligible amount.
Rumble refers to low fre
quency noise from the motor,
which can affect the cartridge.
Measured in dßs under two dif
ferent systems, look for no less
than 35 dB NAB or 60 dB DIN.
Tone arms
The tone arm and cartridge
play the other major part of the
turntable operation. The pur
pose of the tone arm is to serve

as a support for the cartridge,
which picks up the signal from
the record.
Tracking force, measured in
grams, tells you how much
downward force is exerted by
the tone arm to keep the car
tidge in place. Too much track
ing force will increase record
wear (and gouge a canyon
through your album) while too
little tracking force will lead to
an attack of bouncing needles.
Light tracking will also increase
the likelihood of having the
needle skate across the record.
On most tone arms, the
tracking force can be adjusted
with a various spring or coun
terweight balancing systems,
to fit the cartridge. Hope for a
tracking force of around one
gram — some of the better
turntables can give you 3/4
gram. In any case, avoid a unit
that requires more than three
grams. You'll probably lose
your high frequency response
very quickly.
Skating force
Skating force is another
source of trouble. It is in effect
whenever the needle is in con
tact with the rotating record
surface; it acts inward, pulling
the cartridge and tone arm to
wards the center of rotation.
This is due to the record
groove's drag on the needle.
If not corrected, skating
force can cause lowered track
ing force on the outer groove
wall, which will lead to mis
tracking and distortion, and
uneven needle wear. Also, if
the needle should ever jump
up and you watch it move
several grooves across, blame
it on too much skating.
Fortunately, most good
turntables have an antiskating
adjustment which equalizes
the pressure on both sides of
the groove and keeps it from
skipping across.
Tracking error
A fairly inaudible problem
which the more expensive
turntables deal with is tracking
error. When a record is cut, the
lathe goes directly across the
record, but most turntable
arms swing across the record in
an arc, so that the cartridge is
seldom exactly tangent to the
groove, producing some dis
tortion. Tracking error is the
measure of the cartridge's de
viation from the tangent; the
smaller the error the better.
Expensive turntables exist
which move the tone arm the
same way the lathe moves.
Most conventional tone arms
with properly offset cartridge
shell and about eight to nine
inch arm pivot-to-needle
length can achieve very good
tangency.
Resonance of the tone arm is
a more pressing problem. The
tone-arm cartridge assembly is
essentially a simple mass
spring system which inevitably
has a preferred resonance fre
quency— a frequency at which
it will prefer to vibrate or reso
nate if disturbed.
This characteristic becomes
troublesome if it corresponds
with a frequency at which re
cord warps tend to occur, (ab
out 4 Hz for a 12 inch, 33 1/3
rpm record) because then the
tone arms will bob and weave
to its heart's content, more
than the warp itself would
cause.
On the other hand, a much
higher resonance such as 25 Hz
is also unpleasant, since this
begins to enter the range of re
corded material on the record.
Stereo systems have become
amazingly sophisticated in the
last few years. Along with the
increasingly complex technol
ogy has come an increasingly
technical language. The stereo
buyer who walks into a store
these days had better watch

the speaker front. If you plan to

the walls will even out the
sound.

to within one dB (inaudible dif
ference), the same figures on
speaker specs may vary by as
much as 5 dB.
Amplifiers
After speakers, a receiver
should be the next considera
tion. The receiver takes a sig
nal, usually from a turntable or
radio station, and amplifies it
until it can drive the speakers.
There are three major specs
for receivers.
Power per channel or power
per speakers. An important
thing to remember about
power is that volume is not the
main reason you need it. Nor
mal listening levels don't use
more than three to six watts of
power.
Furthermore, because of the
way the human ear works,
doubling the power output
only increases loudness by 3
dßs. Thus, if you had a 50 watt
receiver and replaced it with a
100 watt receiver, you would
only get a 3 dB louder musical
output.
However, power will allow
you to play music louder with
less distortion. You can turn
your clock radio to a respecta
ble volume on a few watts, but
it'll sound awfully distorted.
Power is needed to reproduce
the music cleanly, if not with
more volume.
RMS and IHF
Specs will often list two
power ratings, one for con

tinuous power (watts RMS) and
one forpeak (IHF). Ignore peak
power, because when it comes
to listening, you are only con
cerned with what power the
amplifier can put out for a rela
tively long time.
Frequency response is also
important. Virtually all good
receivers have a frequency re
sponse of 20-20,000 Hz with
variations no larger than one
dB, which means that they will
reproduce all sounds in that
frequency range with no more
than a one dB loudness varia
tion.
Distortion is the third big
point. It comes in two types,
total harmonic distortion
(THD) and intermodulation
distortion (IM), both measured
in terms of percentage of the
receiver's total output. The
lower the numbers, the better.
THD is caused by the creation
of overtones of the notes. It af
fects the total coloration of the
music. IM adds new notes to
the music which are heard as
distortion.
Remember when looking at
these three specs to look at
them simultaneously. Often a
manufacturer will try to de
ceive you by quoting a great
distortion figure and a great
power output — carefully hid
ing in the fine print the fact that
the that distortion figure is fora
much lower power output.
You won't know anything then
about the receiver's perfor
mance at its rated power out
put.
Other receiver specs are less
important, but still worth
knowing about.
Signal to noise ratio
The signal to noise ratio (S/N)
indicates how much softer
noise within the receiver is
than the receiver's maximum
signal level. Stay away from
anything with less than 60 dB
S/N; the higher the figure, the
quieter the noise will be rela
tive to the music.
The damping factor refers to
the ability of the receiver to
damp, or lessen, residual
movements of the speaker
caused by inertia or other ex
traneous forces. The higher
the figure, the better; anything
over 20 is acceptable, although
good receivers may have
damping factors of up to 100.
You'll pay for anything that
good, however.
The other specs important
for receivers refer to tuner per
formance. The tuner accepts
FM and AM signals from the
antenna, demodulates them,
and puts them into a form suit
able to be amplified.
Selectivity, expressed in de
cibels, tells you how much in
terference you'll get from the
station on the dial closest to
the one you want to hear. The
higher the figure, the less in
terference. Most tuner sec
tions give you alternate chan
nel selectivity, which is for a
station two channels away.
Again, the larger the figure, the
better, and a figure of about 60
dB is not uncommon. You
should have at least 50 dB;
some go up to 100.
Selectivity (either kind) is
important in urban areas
where a lot of powerful sta
tions are crowded together.
A related spec is sensitivity
measured in microvolts. Sen
sitivity measures a tuner's abil
ity to pull in weak signals with
out unacceptable distortion.
For FM, there are two types:
usable sensitivity, the
minimum signal strength in
microvolts necessary for the
signal to be3odß stronger than
the noise; and quieting sen
sitivity, the minimum signal
necessary for a 50 dB S/N ratio.
The smaller the figure, the bet
ter.
You should have at least 3
microvolts of usable sensitivity
and 10 microvolts of quieting
sensitivity.
Sensitivity is important in
rural areas, where signals are
usually weak. In general, you
will find a trade-off between
selectivity and sensitivity.
The capture ration expres
sed in dßs, shows the tuner's
ability to distinguish between
two signals on the same fre
quency, such as two stations in
different cities, or one sta
tion's main signal and an echo
off of a tall building. Such dis
tortions are called multipath
distortions, and usually give a
fuzzy quality to the music.
This is expressed in decibels
and shows how much stronger
one signal has to be than the
other for the receiver to pick
up the stronger one and ignore
the weaker one. It should be at
least J dB, and the lower the
figure, the better.
Turntables
Turntable specs fall into two
main categories, those which
describe accuracy of speed and
those which describe tone arm
performance.
The turntable's major func
tion is to maintain a constant
speed of record rotation. The
following specs determine its
accuracy.
Wow and flutter measure
ments, usually in percentages,
tell you about variations in
speed. Wow refers to a waver
ing sound in the bass, pro
duced by slow variations in
pitch while flutter refers to
wavering in the higher fre
quencies produced by fast var
iations in pitch. The lower the
specs the better, and 0.15 per
cent should be expected.
Above $150, most turntables
have less than 0.08 per cent
flutter, a negligible amount.
Rumble refers to low fre
quency noise from the motor,
which can affect the cartridge.
Measured in dßs under two dif
ferent systems, look for no less
than 35 dB NAB or 60 dB DIN.
Tone arms
The tone arm and cartridge
play the other major part of the
turntable operation. The pur
pose of the tone arm is to serve

as a support for the cartridge,
which picks up the signal from
the record.
Tracking force, measured in
grams, tells you how much
downward force is exerted by
the tone arm to keep the car
tidge in place. Too much track
ing force will increase record
wear (and gouge a canyon
through your album) while too
little tracking force will lead to
an attack of bouncing needles.
Light tracking will also increase
the likelihood of having the
needle skate across the record.
On most tone arms, the
tracking force can be adjusted
with a various spring or coun
terweight balancing systems,
to fit the cartridge. Hope for a
tracking force of around one
gram — some of the better
turntables can give you 3/4
gram. In any case, avoid a unit
that requires more than three
grams. You'll probably lose
your high frequency response
very quickly.
Skating force
Skating force is another
source of trouble. It is in effect
whenever the needle is in con
tact with the rotating record
surface; it acts inward, pulling
the cartridge and tone arm to
wards the center of rotation.
This is due to the record
groove's drag on the needle.
If not corrected, skating
force can cause lowered track
ing force on the outer groove
wall, which will lead to mis
tracking and distortion, and
uneven needle wear. Also, if
the needle should ever jump
up and you watch it move
several grooves across, blame
it on too much skating.
Fortunately, most good
turntables have an antiskating
adjustment which equalizes
the pressure on both sides of
the groove and keeps it from
skipping across.
Tracking error
A fairly inaudible problem
which the more expensive
turntables deal with is tracking
error. When a record is cut, the
lathe goes directly across the
record, but most turntable
arms swing across the record in
an arc, so that the cartridge is
seldom exactly tangent to the
groove, producing some dis
tortion. Tracking error is the
measure of the cartridge's de
viation from the tangent; the
smaller the error the better.
Expensive turntables exist
which move the tone arm the
same way the lathe moves.
Most conventional tone arms
with properly offset cartridge
shell and about eight to nine
inch arm pivot-to-needle
length can achieve very good
tangency.
Resonance of the tone arm is
a more pressing problem. The
tone-arm cartridge assembly is
essentially a simple mass
spring system which inevitably
has a preferred resonance fre
quency— a frequency at which
it will prefer to vibrate or reso
nate if disturbed.
This characteristic becomes
troublesome if it corresponds
with a frequency at which re
cord warps tend to occur, (ab
out 4 Hz for a 12 inch, 33 1/3
rpm record) because then the
tone arms will bob and weave
to its heart's content, more
than the warp itself would
cause.
On the other hand, a much
higher resonance such as 25 Hz
is also unpleasant, since this
begins to enter the range of re
corded material on the record.
Stereo systems have become
amazingly sophisticated in the
last few years. Along with the
increasingly complex technol
ogy has come an increasingly
technical language. The stereo
buyer who walks into a store
these days had better watch
out for salesman bearing too
much information.
The secret to not being
overwhelmed by salesmen's
pitches isn't closing your eyes.
It's not even flipping a coin.
Better than either of these is
checking technical specifica
tions.
Before moving into a discus
sion of some important specs,
there are a few main ideas
worth mentioning.
First, there are lots of
sounds. The deep, booming
beat that you hear from the
drums are low frequency
sounds — the bass. The sparkl

ing flute solo you might listen
to is filled with high frequen
cies — the treble. Thus, when
your stereo system is given a
musical program to play, it
plays with many frequencies.
Frequencies are measured in
hertz (Hz). Bass notes are at the
low end of the spectrum,
below 750 Hz. Treble sounds
reach frequencies as high as
18,000 or 20,000 Hz before they
become too high for us to hear.
Another point is power.
Usually measured in watts (W),
power is what makes the sys
tem work. Keep in mind that
different frequencies require
different amounts of power for
the same strength. In general,
bass consumes more power
than treble.
Volume (or sound intensity)
is measured in decibels (dßs).
An average spoken conversa
tion has a loudness of about 65
dßs, while a passing subway

registers more than 100dBs.
With this in mind, let's look
at the components of our
stereo system.
Speakers first
Speakers should beyourfirst
acquisition. If you buy a good,
powerful receiver and then (af
ter you've spent almost all your
money end up with speakers
that can't handle the power,
you'll always be worrying
about how much you can turn
up the amplifier before blow
ing out or destroying the
speakers.
What's most important
about choosing speakers is the
way they sound to you. But to
help you out, there are a few
things you ought to consider.
Efficiency is a measurement
of the speaker's ability to turn
electrical energy into sound.
The more efficient a speaker is,
the less power it will need to
make the same sound. The
main advantage of efficiency is
that it allows you to buy a less
powerful receiver.
Efficiency is often referred to
as sensitivity and is measured
in terms of the loudness of the
speaker at a distance of one
meter when driven by one watt
of power (dB/W/m). Measured
this way, an inefficient speaker
is rated at around 82 dBAV/m,
while an efficient speaker rates
about 93 dBAW/m. Average effi
ciency lies between these ex
tremes.
Power handling capacity will
help you maintain your
speaker life. This measure
ment, usually given in watts,
tells you how much power you
can put in your speakers be
fore they blow. Plan on using
speakers which have the capac
ity to handle your receiver's
rated power output.
Dispersion is a measure of
the loudness variation at diffe
rent angles from the speaker
face. This spec is given in the
form of a polar graph plotting
loudness versus position on a
one meter half-circle around
the speaker front. If you plan to
place your speakers in or near a
corner, this is relatively unim
portant, since the reflection off
the walls will even out the
sound.
Frequency response specs
for speakers are common, but
useless. The figures vary with
test conditions and defy com
parison. Also, while frequency
response specs on receivers
and tuners are usually correct
to within one dB (inaudible dif
ference), the same figures on
speaker specs may vary by as
much as 5 dB.

terference. Most tuner sec
tions give you alternate chan
nel selectivity, which is for a
station two channels away.
Again, the larger the figure, the
better, and a figure of about 60
dB is not uncommon. You
should have at least 50 dB;
some go up to 100.
Selectivity (either kind) is
important in urban areas
where a lot of powerful sta
tions are crowded together.
A related spec is sensitivity
measured in microvolts. Sen
sitivity measures a tuner's abil
ity to pull in weak signals with
out unacceptable distortion.
For FM, there are two types:
usable sensitivity, the
minimum signal strength in
microvolts necessary for the
signal to be3odß stronger than
the noise; and quieting sen
sitivity, the minimum signal
necessary for a 50 dB S/N ratio.
The smaller the figure, the bet
ter.
You should have at least 3
microvolts of usable sensitivity
and 10 microvolts of quieting
sensitivity.
Sensitivity is important in
rural areas, where signals are
usually weak. In general, you
will find a trade-off between
selectivity and sensitivity.
The capture ration expres
sed in dßs, shows the tuner's
ability to distinguish between
two signals on the same fre
quency, such as two stations in
different cities, or one sta
tion's main signal and an echo
off of a tall building. Such dis
tortions are called multipath
distortions, and usually give a
fuzzy quality to the music.
This is expressed in decibels
and shows how much stronger
one signal has to be than the
other for the receiver to pick
up the stronger one and ignore
the weaker one. It should be at
least J dB, and the lower the
figure, the better.
Turntables
Turntable specs fall into two
main categories, those which
describe accuracy of speed and
those which describe tone arm
performance.
The turntable's major func
tion is to maintain a constant
speed of record rotation. The
following specs determine its
accuracy.
Wow and flutter measure
ments, usually in percentages,
tell you about variations in
speed. Wow refers to a waver
ing sound in the bass, pro
duced by slow variations in
pitch while flutter refers to
wavering in the higher fre
quencies produced by fast var
iations in pitch. The lower the
specs the better, and 0.15 per
cent should be expected.
Above $150, most turntables
have less than 0.08 per cent
flutter, a negligible amount.
Rumble refers to low fre
quency noise from the motor,
which can affect the cartridge.
Measured in dßs under two dif
ferent systems, look for no less
than 35 dB NAB or 60 dB DIN.
Tone arms
The tone arm and cartridge
play the other major part of the
turntable operation. The pur
pose of the tone arm is to serve

as a support for the cartridge,
which picks up the signal from
the record.
Tracking force, measured in
grams, tells you how much
downward force is exerted by
the tone arm to keep the car
tidge in place. Too much track
ing force will increase record
wear (and gouge a canyon
through your album) while too
little tracking force will lead to
an attack of bouncing needles.
Light tracking will also increase
the likelihood of having the
needle skate across the record.
On most tone arms, the
tracking force can be adjusted
with a various spring or coun
terweight balancing systems,
to fit the cartridge. Hope for a
tracking force of around one
gram — some of the better
turntables can give you 3/4
gram. In any case, avoid a unit
that requires more than three
grams. You'll probably lose
your high frequency response
very quickly.
Skating force
Skating force is another
source of trouble. It is in effect
whenever the needle is in con
tact with the rotating record
surface; it acts inward, pulling
the cartridge and tone arm to
wards the center of rotation.
This is due to the record
groove's drag on the needle.
If not corrected, skating
force can cause lowered track
ing force on the outer groove
wall, which will lead to mis
tracking and distortion, and
uneven needle wear. Also, if
the needle should ever jump
up and you watch it move
several grooves across, blame
it on too much skating.
Fortunately, most good
turntables have an antiskating
adjustment which equalizes
the pressure on both sides of
the groove and keeps it from
skipping across.
Tracking error
A fairly inaudible problem
which the more expensive
turntables deal with is tracking
error. When a record is cut, the
lathe goes directly across the
record, but most turntable
arms swing across the record in
an arc, so that the cartridge is
seldom exactly tangent to the
groove, producing some dis
tortion. Tracking error is the
measure of the cartridge's de
viation from the tangent; the
smaller the error the better.
Expensive turntables exist
which move the tone arm the
same way the lathe moves.
Most conventional tone arms
with properly offset cartridge
shell and about eight to nine
inch arm pivot-to-needle
length can achieve very good
tangency.
Resonance of the tone arm is
a more pressing problem. The
tone-arm cartridge assembly is
essentially a simple mass
spring system which inevitably
has a preferred resonance fre
quency— a frequency at which
it will prefer to vibrate or reso
nate if disturbed.
This characteristic becomes
troublesome if it corresponds
with a frequency at which re
cord warps tend to occur, (ab
out 4 Hz for a 12 inch, 33 1/3
rpm record) because then the
tone arms will bob and weave
to its heart's content, more
than the warp itself would
cause.
On the other hand, a much
higher resonance such as 25 Hz
is also unpleasant, since this
begins to enter the range of re
corded material on the record.
Stereo systems have become
amazingly sophisticated in the
last few years. Along with the
increasingly complex technol
ogy has come an increasingly
technical language. The stereo
buyer who walks into a store
these days had better watch
out for salesman bearing too
much information.
The secret to not being
overwhelmed by salesmen's
pitches isn't closing your eyes.
It's not even flipping a coin.
Better than either of these is
checking technical specifica
tions.
Before moving into a discus
sion of some important specs,
there are a few main ideas
worth mentioning.
First, there are lots of
sounds. The deep, booming
beat that you hear from the
drums are low frequency
sounds — the bass. The sparkl

ing flute solo you might listen
to is filled with high frequen
cies — the treble. Thus, when
your stereo system is given a
musical program to play, it
plays with many frequencies.
Frequencies are measured in
hertz (Hz). Bass notes are at the
low end of the spectrum,
below 750 Hz. Treble sounds
reach frequencies as high as
18,000 or 20,000 Hz before they
become too high for us to hear.
Another point is power.
Usually measured in watts (W),
power is what makes the sys
tem work. Keep in mind that
different frequencies require
different amounts of power for
the same strength. In general,
bass consumes more power
than treble.
Volume (or sound intensity)
is measured in decibels (dßs).
An average spoken conversa
tion has a loudness of about 65
dßs, while a passing subway

registers more than 100dBs.
With this in mind, let's look
at the components of our
stereo system.
Speakers first
Speakers should beyourfirst
acquisition. If you buy a good,
powerful receiver and then (af
ter you've spent almost all your
money end up with speakers
that can't handle the power,
you'll always be worrying
about how much you can turn
up the amplifier before blow
ing out or destroying the
speakers.
What's most important
about choosing speakers is the
way they sound to you. But to
help you out, there are a few
things you ought to consider.
Efficiency is a measurement
of the speaker's ability to turn
electrical energy into sound.
The more efficient a speaker is,
the less power it will need to
make the same sound. The
main advantage of efficiency is
that it allows you to buy a less
powerful receiver.
Efficiency is often referred to
as sensitivity and is measured
in terms of the loudness of the
speaker at a distance of one
meter when driven by one watt
of power (dB/W/m). Measured
this way, an inefficient speaker
is rated at around 82 dBAV/m,
while an efficient speaker rates
about 93 dBAW/m. Average effi
ciency lies between these ex
tremes.
Power handling capacity will
help you maintain your
speaker life. This measure
ment, usually given in watts,
tells you how much power you
can put in your speakers be
fore they blow. Plan on using
speakers which have the capac
ity to handle your receiver's
rated power output.
Dispersion is a measure of
the loudness variation at diffe
rent angles from the speaker
face. This spec is given in the
form of a polar graph plotting
loudness versus position on a
one meter half-circle around
the speaker front. If you plan to
place your speakers in or near a
corner, this is relatively unim
portant, since the reflection off
the walls will even out the
sound.
Frequency response specs
for speakers are common, but
useless. The figures vary with
test conditions and defy com
parison. Also, while frequency
response specs on receivers
and tuners are usually correct
to within one dB (inaudible dif
ference), the same figures on
speaker specs may vary by as
much as 5 dB.
Amplifiers
After speakers, a receiver
should be the next considera
tion. The receiver takes a sig
nal, usually from a turntable or
radio station, and amplifies it
until it can drive the speakers.
There are three major specs
for receivers.
Power per channel or power
per speakers. An important
thing to remember about
power is that volume is not the
main reason you need it. Nor
mal listening levels don't use
more than three to six watts of
power.
Furthermore, because of the
way the human ear works,
doubling the power output
only increases loudness by 3
dßs. Thus, if you had a 50 watt
receiver and replaced it with a
100 watt receiver, you would
only get a 3 dB louder musical
output.
However, power will allow
you to play music louder with
less distortion. You can turn
your clock radio to a respecta
ble volume on a few watts, but
it'll sound awfully distorted.
Power is needed to reproduce
the music cleanly, if not with
more volume.
RMS and IHF
Specs will often list two
power ratings, one for con

tinuous power (watts RMS) and
one forpeak (IHF). Ignore peak
power, because when it comes
to listening, you are only con
cerned with what power the
amplifier can put out for a rela
tively long time.
Frequency response is also
important. Virtually all good
receivers have a frequency re
sponse of 20-20,000 Hz with
variations no larger than one
dB, which means that they will
reproduce all sounds in that
frequency range with no more
than a one dB loudness varia
tion.
Distortion is the third big
point. It comes in two types,
total harmonic distortion
(THD) and intermodulation
distortion (IM), both measured
in terms of percentage of the
receiver's total output. The
lower the numbers, the better.
THD is caused by the creation
of overtones of the notes. It af
fects the total coloration of the
music. IM adds new notes to
the music which are heard as
distortion.
Remember when looking at
these three specs to look at
them simultaneously. Often a
manufacturer will try to de
ceive you by quoting a great
distortion figure and a great
power output — carefully hid
ing in the fine print the fact that
the that distortion figure is fora
much lower power output.
You won't know anything then
about the receiver's perfor
mance at its rated power out
put.
Other receiver specs are less
important, but still worth
knowing about.
Signal to noise ratio
The signal to noise ratio (S/N)
indicates how much softer
noise within the receiver is
than the receiver's maximum
signal level. Stay away from
anything with less than 60 dB
S/N; the higher the figure, the
quieter the noise will be rela
tive to the music.
The damping factor refers to
the ability of the receiver to
damp, or lessen, residual
movements of the speaker
caused by inertia or other ex
traneous forces. The higher
the figure, the better; anything
over 20 is acceptable, although
good receivers may have
damping factors of up to 100.
You'll pay for anything that
good, however.
The other specs important
for receivers refer to tuner per
formance. The tuner accepts
FM and AM signals from the
antenna, demodulates them,
and puts them into a form suit
able to be amplified.
Selectivity, expressed in de
cibels, tells you how much in
terference you'll get from the
station on the dial closest to
the one you want to hear. The
higher the figure, the less in
terference. Most tuner sec
tions give you alternate chan
nel selectivity, which is for a
station two channels away.
Again, the larger the figure, the
better, and a figure of about 60
dB is not uncommon. You
should have at least 50 dB;
some go up to 100.

Skating force
Skating force is another
source of trouble. It is in effect
whenever the needle is in con
tact with the rotating record
surface; it acts inward, pulling
the cartridge and tone arm to
wards the center of rotation.
This is due to the record
groove's drag on the needle.
If not corrected, skating
force can cause lowered track
ing force on the outer groove
wall, which will lead to mis
tracking and distortion, and
uneven needle wear. Also, if
the needle should ever jump
up and you watch it move
several grooves across, blame
it on too much skating.
Fortunately, most good
turntables have an antiskating
adjustment which equalizes
the pressure on both sides of
the groove and keeps it from
skipping across.
Tracking error
A fairly inaudible problem
which the more expensive
turntables deal with is tracking
error. When a record is cut, the
lathe goes directly across the
record, but most turntable
arms swing across the record in
an arc, so that the cartridge is
seldom exactly tangent to the
groove, producing some dis
tortion. Tracking error is the
measure of the cartridge's de
viation from the tangent; the
smaller the error the better.
Expensive turntables exist
which move the tone arm the
same way the lathe moves.
Most conventional tone arms
with properly offset cartridge
shell and about eight to nine
inch arm pivot-to-needle
length can achieve very good
tangency.
Resonance of the tone arm is
a more pressing problem. The
tone-arm cartridge assembly is
essentially a simple mass
spring system which inevitably
has a preferred resonance fre
quency— a frequency at which
it will prefer to vibrate or reso
nate if disturbed.
This characteristic becomes
troublesome if it corresponds
with a frequency at which re
cord warps tend to occur, (ab
out 4 Hz for a 12 inch, 33 1/3
rpm record) because then the
tone arms will bob and weave
to its heart's content, more
than the warp itself would
cause.
On the other hand, a much
higher resonance such as 25 Hz
is also unpleasant, since this
begins to enter the range of re
corded material on the record.
Stereo systems have become
amazingly sophisticated in the
last few years. Along with the
increasingly complex technol
ogy has come an increasingly
technical language. The stereo
buyer who walks into a store
these days had better watch
out for salesman bearing too
much information.
The secret to not being
overwhelmed by salesmen's
pitches isn't closing your eyes.
It's not even flipping a coin.
Better than either of these is
checking technical specifica
tions.
Before moving into a discus
sion of some important specs,
there are a few main ideas
worth mentioning.
First, there are lots of
sounds. The deep, booming
beat that you hear from the
drums are low frequency
sounds — the bass. The sparkl

ing flute solo you might listen
to is filled with high frequen
cies — the treble. Thus, when
your stereo system is given a
musical program to play, it
plays with many frequencies.
Frequencies are measured in
hertz (Hz). Bass notes are at the
low end of the spectrum,
below 750 Hz. Treble sounds
reach frequencies as high as
18,000 or 20,000 Hz before they
become too high for us to hear.
Another point is power.
Usually measured in watts (W),
power is what makes the sys
tem work. Keep in mind that
different frequencies require
different amounts of power for
the same strength. In general,
bass consumes more power
than treble.
Volume (or sound intensity)
is measured in decibels (dßs).
An average spoken conversa
tion has a loudness of about 65
dßs, while a passing subway

registers more than 100dBs.
With this in mind, let's look
at the components of our
stereo system.
Speakers first
Speakers should beyourfirst
acquisition. If you buy a good,
powerful receiver and then (af
ter you've spent almost all your
money end up with speakers
that can't handle the power,
you'll always be worrying
about how much you can turn
up the amplifier before blow
ing out or destroying the
speakers.
What's most important
about choosing speakers is the
way they sound to you. But to
help you out, there are a few
things you ought to consider.
Efficiency is a measurement
of the speaker's ability to turn
electrical energy into sound.
The more efficient a speaker is,
the less power it will need to
make the same sound. The
main advantage of efficiency is
that it allows you to buy a less
powerful receiver.
Efficiency is often referred to
as sensitivity and is measured
in terms of the loudness of the
speaker at a distance of one
meter when driven by one watt
of power (dB/W/m). Measured
this way, an inefficient speaker
is rated at around 82 dBAV/m,
while an efficient speaker rates
about 93 dBAW/m. Average effi
ciency lies between these ex
tremes.
Power handling capacity will
help you maintain your
speaker life. This measure
ment, usually given in watts,
tells you how much power you
can put in your speakers be
fore they blow. Plan on using
speakers which have the capac
ity to handle your receiver's
rated power output.
Dispersion is a measure of
the loudness variation at diffe
rent angles from the speaker
face. This spec is given in the
form of a polar graph plotting
loudness versus position on a
one meter half-circle around
the speaker front. If you plan to
place your speakers in or near a
corner, this is relatively unim
portant, since the reflection off
the walls will even out the
sound.
Frequency response specs
for speakers are common, but
useless. The figures vary with
test conditions and defy com
parison. Also, while frequency
response specs on receivers
and tuners are usually correct
to within one dB (inaudible dif
ference), the same figures on
speaker specs may vary by as
much as 5 dB.
Amplifiers
After speakers, a receiver
should be the next considera
tion. The receiver takes a sig
nal, usually from a turntable or
radio station, and amplifies it
until it can drive the speakers.
There are three major specs
for receivers.
Power per channel or power
per speakers. An important
thing to remember about
power is that volume is not the
main reason you need it. Nor
mal listening levels don't use
more than three to six watts of
power.
Furthermore, because of the
way the human ear works,
doubling the power output
only increases loudness by 3
dßs. Thus, if you had a 50 watt
receiver and replaced it with a
100 watt receiver, you would
only get a 3 dB louder musical
output.
However, power will allow
you to play music louder with
less distortion. You can turn
your clock radio to a respecta
ble volume on a few watts, but
it'll sound awfully distorted.
Power is needed to reproduce
the music cleanly, if not with
more volume.
RMS and IHF
Specs will often list two
power ratings, one for con

tinuous power (watts RMS) and
one forpeak (IHF). Ignore peak
power, because when it comes
to listening, you are only con
cerned with what power the
amplifier can put out for a rela
tively long time.
Frequency response is also
important. Virtually all good
receivers have a frequency re
sponse of 20-20,000 Hz with
variations no larger than one
dB, which means that they will
reproduce all sounds in that
frequency range with no more
than a one dB loudness varia
tion.
Distortion is the third big
point. It comes in two types,
total harmonic distortion
(THD) and intermodulation
distortion (IM), both measured
in terms of percentage of the
receiver's total output. The
lower the numbers, the better.
THD is caused by the creation
of overtones of the notes. It af
fects the total coloration of the
music. IM adds new notes to
the music which are heard as
distortion.
Remember when looking at
these three specs to look at
them simultaneously. Often a
manufacturer will try to de
ceive you by quoting a great
distortion figure and a great
power output — carefully hid
ing in the fine print the fact that
the that distortion figure is fora
much lower power output.
You won't know anything then
about the receiver's perfor
mance at its rated power out
put.
Other receiver specs are less
important, but still worth
knowing about.
Signal to noise ratio
The signal to noise ratio (S/N)
indicates how much softer
noise within the receiver is
than the receiver's maximum
signal level. Stay away from
anything with less than 60 dB
S/N; the higher the figure, the
quieter the noise will be rela
tive to the music.
The damping factor refers to
the ability of the receiver to
damp, or lessen, residual
movements of the speaker
caused by inertia or other ex
traneous forces. The higher
the figure, the better; anything
over 20 is acceptable, although
good receivers may have
damping factors of up to 100.
You'll pay for anything that
good, however.
The other specs important
for receivers refer to tuner per
formance. The tuner accepts
FM and AM signals from the
antenna, demodulates them,
and puts them into a form suit
able to be amplified.
Selectivity, expressed in de
cibels, tells you how much in
terference you'll get from the
station on the dial closest to
the one you want to hear. The
higher the figure, the less in
terference. Most tuner sec
tions give you alternate chan
nel selectivity, which is for a
station two channels away.
Again, the larger the figure, the
better, and a figure of about 60
dB is not uncommon. You
should have at least 50 dB;
some go up to 100.
Selectivity (either kind) is
important in urban areas
where a lot of powerful sta
tions are crowded together.
A related spec is sensitivity
measured in microvolts. Sen
sitivity measures a tuner's abil
ity to pull in weak signals with
out unacceptable distortion.
For FM, there are two types:
usable sensitivity, the
minimum signal strength in
microvolts necessary for the
signal to be3odß stronger than
the noise; and quieting sen
sitivity, the minimum signal
necessary for a 50 dB S/N ratio.
The smaller the figure, the bet
ter.
You should have at least 3
microvolts of usable sensitivity
and 10 microvolts of quieting
sensitivity.
Sensitivity is important in
rural areas, where signals are
usually weak. In general, you
will find a trade-off between
selectivity and sensitivity.
The capture ration expres
sed in dßs, shows the tuner's
ability to distinguish between
two signals on the same fre
quency, such as two stations in
different cities, or one sta
tion's main signal and an echo
off of a tall building. Such dis
tortions are called multipath
distortions, and usually give a
fuzzy quality to the music.
This is expressed in decibels
and shows how much stronger
one signal has to be than the
other for the receiver to pick
up the stronger one and ignore
the weaker one. It should be at
least J dB, and the lower the
figure, the better.
Turntables
Turntable specs fall into two
main categories, those which
describe accuracy of speed and
those which describe tone arm
performance.
The turntable's major func
tion is to maintain a constant
speed of record rotation. The
following specs determine its
accuracy.
Wow and flutter measure
ments, usually in percentages,
tell you about variations in
speed. Wow refers to a waver
ing sound in the bass, pro
duced by slow variations in
pitch while flutter refers to
wavering in the higher fre
quencies produced by fast var
iations in pitch. The lower the
specs the better, and 0.15 per
cent should be expected.
Above $150, most turntables
have less than 0.08 per cent
flutter, a negligible amount.
Rumble refers to low fre
quency noise from the motor,
which can affect the cartridge.
Measured in dßs under two dif
ferent systems, look for no less
than 35 dB NAB or 60 dB DIN.
Tone arms
The tone arm and cartridge
play the other major part of the
turntable operation. The pur
pose of the tone arm is to serve

as a support for the cartridge,
which picks up the signal from
the record.
Tracking force, measured in
grams, tells you how much
downward force is exerted by
the tone arm to keep the car
tidge in place. Too much track
ing force will increase record
wear (and gouge a canyon
through your album) while too
little tracking force will lead to
an attack of bouncing needles.
Light tracking will also increase
the likelihood of having the
needle skate across the record.
On most tone arms, the
tracking force can be adjusted
with a various spring or coun
terweight balancing systems,
to fit the cartridge. Hope for a
tracking force of around one
gram — some of the better
turntables can give you 3/4
gram. In any case, avoid a unit
that requires more than three
grams. You'll probably lose
your high frequency response
very quickly.
Skating force
Skating force is another
source of trouble. It is in effect
whenever the needle is in con
tact with the rotating record
surface; it acts inward, pulling

registers more than 100dBs.
With this in mind, let's look
at the components of our
stereo system.
Speakers first
Speakers should beyourfirst
acquisition. If you buy a good,
powerful receiver and then (af
ter you've spent almost all your
money end up with speakers
that can't handle the power,
you'll always be worrying
about how much you can turn
up the amplifier before blow
ing out or destroying the
speakers.
What's most important
about choosing speakers is the
way they sound to you. But to
help you out, there are a few
things you ought to consider.
Efficiency is a measurement
of the speaker's ability to turn
electrical energy into sound.
The more efficient a speaker is,
the less power it will need to
make the same sound. The
main advantage of efficiency is
that it allows you to buy a less
powerful receiver.
Efficiency is often referred to
as sensitivity and is measured
in terms of the loudness of the
speaker at a distance of one
meter when driven by one watt
of power (dB/W/m). Measured
this way, an inefficient speaker
is rated at around 82 dBAV/m,
while an efficient speaker rates
about 93 dBAW/m. Average effi
ciency lies between these ex
tremes.
Power handling capacity will
help you maintain your
speaker life. This measure
ment, usually given in watts,
tells you how much power you
can put in your speakers be
fore they blow. Plan on using
speakers which have the capac
ity to handle your receiver's
rated power output.
Dispersion is a measure of
the loudness variation at diffe
rent angles from the speaker
face. This spec is given in the
form of a polar graph plotting
loudness versus position on a
one meter half-circle around
the speaker front. If you plan to
place your speakers in or near a
corner, this is relatively unim
portant, since the reflection off
the walls will even out the
sound.
Frequency response specs
for speakers are common, but
useless. The figures vary with
test conditions and defy com
parison. Also, while frequency
response specs on receivers
and tuners are usually correct
to within one dB (inaudible dif
ference), the same figures on
speaker specs may vary by as
much as 5 dB.
Amplifiers
After speakers, a receiver
should be the next considera
tion. The receiver takes a sig
nal, usually from a turntable or
radio station, and amplifies it
until it can drive the speakers.
There are three major specs
for receivers.
Power per channel or power
per speakers. An important
thing to remember about
power is that volume is not the
main reason you need it. Nor
mal listening levels don't use
more than three to six watts of
power.
Furthermore, because of the
way the human ear works,
doubling the power output
only increases loudness by 3
dßs. Thus, if you had a 50 watt
receiver and replaced it with a
100 watt receiver, you would
only get a 3 dB louder musical
output.
However, power will allow
you to play music louder with
less distortion. You can turn
your clock radio to a respecta
ble volume on a few watts, but
it'll sound awfully distorted.
Power is needed to reproduce
the music cleanly, if not with
more volume.
RMS and IHF
Specs will often list two
power ratings, one for con

tinuous power (watts RMS) and
one forpeak (IHF). Ignore peak
power, because when it comes
to listening, you are only con
cerned with what power the
amplifier can put out for a rela
tively long time.
Frequency response is also
important. Virtually all good
receivers have a frequency re
sponse of 20-20,000 Hz with
variations no larger than one
dB, which means that they will
reproduce all sounds in that
frequency range with no more
than a one dB loudness varia
tion.
Distortion is the third big
point. It comes in two types,
total harmonic distortion
(THD) and intermodulation
distortion (IM), both measured
in terms of percentage of the
receiver's total output. The
lower the numbers, the better.
THD is caused by the creation
of overtones of the notes. It af
fects the total coloration of the
music. IM adds new notes to
the music which are heard as
distortion.
Remember when looking at
these three specs to look at
them simultaneously. Often a
manufacturer will try to de
ceive you by quoting a great
distortion figure and a great
power output — carefully hid
ing in the fine print the fact that
the that distortion figure is fora
much lower power output.
You won't know anything then
about the receiver's perfor
mance at its rated power out
put.
Other receiver specs are less
important, but still worth
knowing about.
Signal to noise ratio
The signal to noise ratio (S/N)
indicates how much softer
noise within the receiver is
than the receiver's maximum
signal level. Stay away from
anything with less than 60 dB
S/N; the higher the figure, the
quieter the noise will be rela
tive to the music.
The damping factor refers to
the ability of the receiver to
damp, or lessen, residual
movements of the speaker
caused by inertia or other ex
traneous forces. The higher
the figure, the better; anything
over 20 is acceptable, although
good receivers may have
damping factors of up to 100.
You'll pay for anything that
good, however.
The other specs important
for receivers refer to tuner per
formance. The tuner accepts
FM and AM signals from the
antenna, demodulates them,
and puts them into a form suit
able to be amplified.
Selectivity, expressed in de
cibels, tells you how much in
terference you'll get from the
station on the dial closest to
the one you want to hear. The
higher the figure, the less in
terference. Most tuner sec
tions give you alternate chan
nel selectivity, which is for a
station two channels away.
Again, the larger the figure, the
better, and a figure of about 60
dB is not uncommon. You
should have at least 50 dB;
some go up to 100.
Selectivity (either kind) is
important in urban areas
where a lot of powerful sta
tions are crowded together.
A related spec is sensitivity
measured in microvolts. Sen
sitivity measures a tuner's abil
ity to pull in weak signals with
out unacceptable distortion.
For FM, there are two types:
usable sensitivity, the
minimum signal strength in
microvolts necessary for the
signal to be3odß stronger than
the noise; and quieting sen
sitivity, the minimum signal
necessary for a 50 dB S/N ratio.
The smaller the figure, the bet
ter.
You should have at least 3
microvolts of usable sensitivity
and 10 microvolts of quieting
sensitivity.
Sensitivity is important in
rural areas, where signals are
usually weak. In general, you
will find a trade-off between
selectivity and sensitivity.
The capture ration expres
sed in dßs, shows the tuner's
ability to distinguish between
two signals on the same fre
quency, such as two stations in
different cities, or one sta
tion's main signal and an echo
off of a tall building. Such dis
tortions are called multipath
distortions, and usually give a
fuzzy quality to the music.
This is expressed in decibels
and shows how much stronger
one signal has to be than the
other for the receiver to pick
up the stronger one and ignore
the weaker one. It should be at
least J dB, and the lower the
figure, the better.
Turntables
Turntable specs fall into two
main categories, those which
describe accuracy of speed and
those which describe tone arm
performance.
The turntable's major func
tion is to maintain a constant
speed of record rotation. The
following specs determine its
accuracy.
Wow and flutter measure
ments, usually in percentages,
tell you about variations in
speed. Wow refers to a waver
ing sound in the bass, pro
duced by slow variations in
pitch while flutter refers to
wavering in the higher fre
quencies produced by fast var
iations in pitch. The lower the
specs the better, and 0.15 per
cent should be expected.
Above $150, most turntables
have less than 0.08 per cent
flutter, a negligible amount.
Rumble refers to low fre
quency noise from the motor,
which can affect the cartridge.
Measured in dßs under two dif
ferent systems, look for no less
than 35 dB NAB or 60 dB DIN.
Tone arms
The tone arm and cartridge
play the other major part of the
turntable operation. The pur
pose of the tone arm is to serve

as a support for the cartridge,
which picks up the signal from
the record.
Tracking force, measured in
grams, tells you how much
downward force is exerted by
the tone arm to keep the car
tidge in place. Too much track
ing force will increase record
wear (and gouge a canyon
through your album) while too
little tracking force will lead to
an attack of bouncing needles.
Light tracking will also increase
the likelihood of having the
needle skate across the record.
On most tone arms, the
tracking force can be adjusted
with a various spring or coun
terweight balancing systems,
to fit the cartridge. Hope for a
tracking force of around one
gram — some of the better
turntables can give you 3/4
gram. In any case, avoid a unit
that requires more than three
grams. You'll probably lose
your high frequency response
very quickly.
Skating force
Skating force is another
source of trouble. It is in effect
whenever the needle is in con
tact with the rotating record
surface; it acts inward, pulling
the cartridge and tone arm to
wards the center of rotation.
This is due to the record
groove's drag on the needle.
If not corrected, skating
force can cause lowered track
ing force on the outer groove
wall, which will lead to mis
tracking and distortion, and
uneven needle wear. Also, if
the needle should ever jump
up and you watch it move
several grooves across, blame
it on too much skating.
Fortunately, most good
turntables have an antiskating
adjustment which equalizes
the pressure on both sides of
the groove and keeps it from
skipping across.
Tracking error
A fairly inaudible problem
which the more expensive
turntables deal with is tracking
error. When a record is cut, the
lathe goes directly across the
record, but most turntable
arms swing across the record in
an arc, so that the cartridge is
seldom exactly tangent to the
groove, producing some dis
tortion. Tracking error is the
measure of the cartridge's de
viation from the tangent; the
smaller the error the better.
Expensive turntables exist
which move the tone arm the
same way the lathe moves.
Most conventional tone arms
with properly offset cartridge
shell and about eight to nine
inch arm pivot-to-needle
length can achieve very good
tangency.
Resonance of the tone arm is
a more pressing problem. The
tone-arm cartridge assembly is
essentially a simple mass
spring system which inevitably
has a preferred resonance fre
quency— a frequency at which
it will prefer to vibrate or reso
nate if disturbed.
This characteristic becomes
troublesome if it corresponds
with a frequency at which re
cord warps tend to occur, (ab
out 4 Hz for a 12 inch, 33 1/3
rpm record) because then the
tone arms will bob and weave
to its heart's content, more
than the warp itself would
cause.
On the other hand, a much
higher resonance such as 25 Hz
is also unpleasant, since this
begins to enter the range of re
corded material on the record.
