# Muddy 'Mississippi' Waters sings the blues

### Phil Otto 
The other night I went up to San Francisco to
see Muddy Waters. When I got to the Old Wal
dorf the Charles Musselwhite Blues Band was on
the stage, they looked bored. I ordered my first
of two drinks and settled down to wait for the
man I'd come to see, Muddy "Mississippi'' Wat
ers.
I was already impatient. I'd been hearing him
andabout himformostof my lifeand itoccurred
to me that he must be pretty old. I wanted to
hear Muddy telling me about when he was a
little boy and how it is in Kansas City. Finally
Charles Musselwhite sang his last "I need that
woman" and left the stage.
The Muddy Waters Blues Band came out and
did three numbers before Muddy Waters him
self took the stage. Charles Musselwhite's band
had been competent, but these guys had flair.
They were on stage to play the blues and have a
good time. The guitars were quite blatantly out
of tune with the piano, but it didn't matter. The
band was hot.
Muddy introduced the band starting with the
harmonica player, Jerry Portnoy. He was really
good on harp, but I didn't like him after a
while. He dressed and acted just a little too Las
Vegas. He frowned at the audience and told the
guitarists not to talk to us. And when he made
his typically Vegas announcements he flashed a
cheap smile. Oh well. He was young and so
were both the guitarists.
On lead guitar was Bob Margolin, who was
just reallygood. Theotherguitarwas played bya
little crazy-looking guy. Muddy always called
him "my young friend Brian." Willie "Big Eyes"

Smith was the drummer and he made really
good expressions when he played. He's been
with Muddy for 17 years. On bass we had the
great Calvin )ones, and on piano was "Pine Top'
Perkins, that was my favorite name of the bunch.
When Muddy took the stage he did look old,
but fun. He was amazing. He just smiled and I
knew it was going to be a great show. He picked
up this old, really beat up guitar and sat down on
a stool. He sang "Hoochie Koochie Man" and
"The Blues had a Baby," "Kansas City" and
"Howlin' Wolf." He'd sing a line then he and
Pine Top would talk about it for a while, and
Muddywouldaddafewlittlelickson hisguitar. I
couldn't believe his expressions. He had the
most intense happy smiles and sometimes these
sneaky grins.
During Howlin' Wolf Muddy brought the
song's writer, Charles Brown, out of the audi
ence to sing a couple of verses. Muddy held the
mike for him and would point at him and look
proud.
Most of the audience stayed for the second
set. So did I and I was paranoid about the wait
ress, still that two drink minimum per set and I
was out of money. But I lived through it. The
second set was worth staying for because they
did Mannish Boy. That made the evening.
Muddy was singing it really nice, then halfway
through he stood up and started batting the
mike stand around, jumping out ai the audi
ence; this old guy was rockin' out.
The show was relaxed, the music was great,
and Muddy "Mississippi" Waters was amazing
on stage. When I've forgotten other entertain
ers I'll . . . well, this old guy was great and that's
it.
