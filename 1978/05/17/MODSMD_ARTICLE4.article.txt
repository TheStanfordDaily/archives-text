# New sound wave
## Computer new instrument for musicians 
### Yvonne Randle 
A sound which seems to circle the room, a low
pitched, reverberating tone, which fades into a
chorus of voices, bells . . . music? Have beings from
outer space sent us a message through musical
sounds?
Hardly. But some of the music that is produced at
Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music
and Acoustics (CCRMA) does sound very much like
something from a "Close Encounter of the Third
Kind."
The idea of using a computer to produce music is
revolutionary. Computer music is a relatively new
field, having its origins only 19 years ago.
One of its originators, Max Matthews, working at
Bell Laboratories, showed that one could combine
the fine art of music with the technology of a compu
ter. For this, he is sometimes called the grandfather of
the process.
The computer music program was brought to Stan
ford about 10 years ago, but it wasn't until 1975 that
CCRMA was established through funds from the Na
tional Science Foundation and the National Endow
ment for the Arts.
Using a computer, it is possible both to record
natural sounds and to produce sounds which have
never been heard before.
This is possible because, with a computer, the
composer works not in individual notes, but in mil
liseconds of sound. Numbers are used to represent
sound in the form of sound waves. These can then be
converted into voltage which goes to an amplifier to
produce a tone.
Because there are 25,000 numbers occurring each
second to produce a tone, a change in the sequence
of numbers will produce quite a different tone from
the original. As Mike McNabb, a graduate student in
music put it,"The main limitation is imagination."

McNabb has spent approximately a year compos
ing a work for the computer. The basic element of his
composition is the recorded vioce of a soprano. He
explained that the voice was stored in the computer
as wave forms, which were later changed into a
chorus effect.
As one listens to the piece, the voice seems to
move around the room in a somewhat circular fash
ion. It has been altered to a point where it is almost
unrecognizable as a human voice. Later in the com
position, bells are added which blend in with the
soprano's voice.
The keyboard operator/musician can punch in a
series of numbers which can produce the sound of
any number of orchestral instruments, plus sounds
which are not possible on any conventional music
maker.
As McNabb explained, there is a code for each
instrument as well as a code for the tones which it is
capable of playing. Once a tone has been produced,
the musician can alter the original tone to produce a
sound which he wants.
This is done through analyzing and altering the set
of sound waves which can be displayed on the termi
nal screen. These represent, in milliseconds, the tone
which is produced.
It is possible, through the use of the computer, not
only to alter a tone by changing its wave amplitude at
a fraction of a millisecond, but also to edit out distor
tion within a recording.
McNabb is working on editing out certain "clicks"
from his composition. As the wave pattern is dis
played on the terminal screen, the clicks appear as
irregular changes in the normal pattern. These are
edited out by selecting two points on either side of
the click's pattern which have about the same
amplitude and connecting them with a relatively

straight line, taking out the irregular pattern.
The potential use for such a process seems very
great. In addition to the new and different sounds
which a computer can produce, it could allow musi
cians a way of eliminating distortion within their re
cordings to a degree not known in the past.
Prof. )ohn Chowning and others at CCRMA are
working on a plan to build the first all-digital record
ing studio in which everything would be stored,
mixed and then played on a master disc, all using a
computer. McNabb said that he estimates the cost of
such a project to be about half a million dollars.
Another hope of most computer musicians is that
the computer will become a "real" instrument.
McNabb said he thought it would never replace con
ventional instruments. Rather, as Robert Harvey,
another graduate student put it,"It can be used to
supplement the resources available to the musician."
McNabb said that present synthesizers, like those
used by many rock artists, lack the capability to con
trol sound like the computer does. He said, however,
that he would like to see the computer become more
like a synthesizer in one way: the ability to operate in
real time.
Presently, the sound must to typed into the compu
ter as a set of numbers, and then translated into
sound. In real time, the sound would be heard as it is
produced. This is possible now, but only on a limited
basis.
The idea of seeing a computer terminal brought out
onto the stage of a rock concert, along with electric
guitars, drums, etc., may seem like a very futuristic
dream. However, with advancing technology, il may
not be so far away.

only to alter a tone by changing its wave amplitude at
a fraction of a millisecond, but also to edit out distor
tion within a recording.
McNabb is working on editing out certain "clicks"
from his composition. As the wave pattern is dis
played on the terminal screen, the clicks appear as
irregular changes in the normal pattern. These are
edited out by selecting two points on either side of
the click's pattern which have about the same
amplitude and connecting them with a relatively

straight line, taking out the irregular pattern.
The potential use for such a process seems very
great. In addition to the new and different sounds
which a computer can produce, it could allow musi
cians a way of eliminating distortion within their re
cordings to a degree not known in the past.
Prof. )ohn Chowning and others at CCRMA are
working on a plan to build the first all-digital record
ing studio in which everything would be stored,
mixed and then played on a master disc, all using a
computer. McNabb said that he estimates the cost of
such a project to be about half a million dollars.
Another hope of most computer musicians is that
the computer will become a "real" instrument.
McNabb said he thought it would never replace con
ventional instruments. Rather, as Robert Harvey,
another graduate student put it,"It can be used to
supplement the resources available to the musician."
McNabb said that present synthesizers, like those
used by many rock artists, lack the capability to con
trol sound like the computer does. He said, however,
that he would like to see the computer become more
like a synthesizer in one way: the ability to operate in
real time.
Presently, the sound must to typed into the compu
ter as a set of numbers, and then translated into
sound. In real time, the sound would be heard as it is
produced. This is possible now, but only on a limited
basis.
The idea of seeing a computer terminal brought out
onto the stage of a rock concert, along with electric
guitars, drums, etc., may seem like a very futuristic
dream. However, with advancing technology, il may
not be so far away.
A sound which seems to circle the room, a low
pitched, reverberating tone, which fades into a
chorus of voices, bells . . . music? Have beings from
outer space sent us a message through musical
sounds?
Hardly. But some of the music that is produced at
Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music
and Acoustics (CCRMA) does sound very much like
something from a "Close Encounter of the Third
Kind."
The idea of using a computer to produce music is
revolutionary. Computer music is a relatively new
field, having its origins only 19 years ago.
One of its originators, Max Matthews, working at
Bell Laboratories, showed that one could combine
the fine art of music with the technology of a compu
ter. For this, he is sometimes called the grandfather of
the process.
The computer music program was brought to Stan
ford about 10 years ago, but it wasn't until 1975 that
CCRMA was established through funds from the Na
tional Science Foundation and the National Endow
ment for the Arts.
Using a computer, it is possible both to record
natural sounds and to produce sounds which have
never been heard before.
This is possible because, with a computer, the
composer works not in individual notes, but in mil
liseconds of sound. Numbers are used to represent
sound in the form of sound waves. These can then be
converted into voltage which goes to an amplifier to
produce a tone.
Because there are 25,000 numbers occurring each
second to produce a tone, a change in the sequence
of numbers will produce quite a different tone from
the original. As Mike McNabb, a graduate student in
music put it,"The main limitation is imagination."

McNabb has spent approximately a year compos
ing a work for the computer. The basic element of his
composition is the recorded vioce of a soprano. He
explained that the voice was stored in the computer
as wave forms, which were later changed into a
chorus effect.
As one listens to the piece, the voice seems to
move around the room in a somewhat circular fash
ion. It has been altered to a point where it is almost
unrecognizable as a human voice. Later in the com
position, bells are added which blend in with the
soprano's voice.
The keyboard operator/musician can punch in a
series of numbers which can produce the sound of
any number of orchestral instruments, plus sounds
which are not possible on any conventional music
maker.
As McNabb explained, there is a code for each
instrument as well as a code for the tones which it is
capable of playing. Once a tone has been produced,
the musician can alter the original tone to produce a
sound which he wants.
This is done through analyzing and altering the set
of sound waves which can be displayed on the termi
nal screen. These represent, in milliseconds, the tone
which is produced.

only to alter a tone by changing its wave amplitude at
a fraction of a millisecond, but also to edit out distor
