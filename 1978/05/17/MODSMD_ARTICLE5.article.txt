# Harvey to head Alea II Ensemble
## 
### David Lang 
Unbeknownst to most of you
out there the Music Depart
ment recently decided to allow
one of its most prestigious per
forming organizations to
change management. It wasn't
exactly a coup; I mean, the
Knoll didn't authorize the inva
sion of Dinkelspiel by Cuban
militia men.
It means that a position was
rotated, the position being the
directorship of Stanford's Alea
II Ensemble, and the new head
will be Stanford's own Robert
Harvey.
For those ill-informed
among you the Alea II ensem
ble is the performance wing of
the New Music part of the
Music Department, and it puts
on average of one concert per
quarter, with pieces from Stan
ford student composers and
works out of the mainstream of
contemporary classical music.
Harvey sees some problems
in this one-concert-oriented
format. "There's a danger in
letting Alea turn into the type
of ensemble that just puts to
gether concerts on time. Since
this is an educational institu
tion part of our role should be
to educate both the audience

and the performers them
selves, over and above the de
mands of a single perfor
mance."
This principle of education
stretches to all aspects of the
performance. Harvey suggests
that more concerts will be
scheduled in less likely places,
in order to reach a different
crowd ("Taking the concerts
out of Dink.") He is hoping to
create a core of performers
with whom he can tour the Bay
Area.
Harvey also foresees an ex
pansion of the types of pieces
played. "I would like to expand
our sample of the literature:
everything from repetitive
music to quasi-ethnic. I am also
very enthusiastic about using
Alea as a platform for the com
puter and music produced at

the Artificial Intelligence Lab."
More important than all
these are two basic priorities:
to play the works of Stanford
student composers and to play
music that is NEW. '"This is not
just to push my own tastes but
to give a more honest view of
the whole new music field."
Robert Harvey is a solid
composer and pianist in his
own right; in fact, he will be
represented in both of thse
these facets on the upcoming
Alea concert, next Tuesday at 8
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. This concert should
be absolutely wicked, and you
should all go. "I didn't say any
of this," Harvey fictitiously ad
ded, but later went on to say
that "the future of your educa
tion demands your atten
dance."
