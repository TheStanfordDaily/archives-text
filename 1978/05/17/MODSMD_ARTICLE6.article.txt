# Punk rock at Stanford
## 
### Jacob Young 
There is a movement afoot in this country to undermine the
empire currently held by those insipid Brothers Gibb and their
saccharine (but catchy) success known as "Saturday Night
Fever." That movement, led by such notable persons and groups
as The Slits, the Ramones and High Priestess Patti Smith, is known
generically as "punk rock."
Punk rock is not very big at Stanford. Can you imagine
freshpeople in Larkin getting off to "Your Love is Like A Nuclear
Waste," or even "Gloria (In Excelsis Deo)?" Not quite.
So why is there even a story about punk in The Daily. Well,
because you are going to have to face this phenomenon in the
real world this summer, and we want you to be ready. We want
you to be able to tell real punk from the guano.
Now some may argue that punk is merely primitive rock, as my
cousin Chuck who writes for Rolling Stones insists. Cousin
Chuck fell under the trance of Johnny Rotten and the Sex Pistols
about a year ago, and just hasn't been the same since. His idea is
that lousy guitar and lousy vocals, combined with "raw" lyrics
equals the salvation of rock and roll just because it is the
antithesis of the Bee Gees and the Slick L.A. Sound.
Well, I can prove him wrong. At least here.
There is a group of Stanford students, most of them hangers-on
at a little-known humor publication, who have assembled a
"punk" band in Wilbur (admittedly the place where punk should
arise here, if at all). They call themselves "John Vomit and the
Leather Scabs." That name, a rip-off on Rotten, et al., should be
the first tip off.
Vomit and the Scabs, whose names will be kept from the
public, are a senior, a freshman, a junior and an unemployed
guitarist from Carmel.
According to leader Vomit, the Scabs' concept of punk is that it
is "the ultimate act of creative destruction." There is, in the
British punk rock movement, an overtone of anarchy (get that,
overtone), which sociologists would perhaps classify as
stemming from the current British economic situation and the
lack of any sort of real hope in the British working classes. There is
none of that in John Vomit.
They claim to be libertarians.
Vomit is a political science major. He claims that qualifies him
for a "working class background.'' Pus Grimes, bassist and lyricist
("I Suck," off the first record is the state of his art. . .) never
declared a major. "That was pretty punk, I'd say," Grimes said.
Commented??? Said.
Grimes continually compares himself to Paul McCartney,
having become entranced with the "Paul is dead" myth on the
Beatles' "Abbey Road" album. "I'm not dead," he says every
other sentence.
Vomit and the Scabs actually have put out a record. The tapes
were cut one night in the spacious studios of KZSU under
Memorial Auditorium, certainly an auspicious place to begin a
recording career. The two sides (surprise!) contain "I Suck, " and
the anthem "I'm a Punk Rock Star." Both are fairly primitive rock,
and perhaps I would have been able to accept the Scabs as
legitimate punk, or at least closer than they come off in person,
had I only heard the record.
Two weeks ago, before the Chaparral showing of "Rocky
Horror Picture Show" the Scabs gave a concert, and showed a
good deal of punkiness (Jesus. . ) especially, when backed by the
straining guitar of the mysterious Mr. Montgomery, who may
actually be too good a guitarist to play much punk.
The band has claimed alternatively to be not interested in
money, to be headed toward Harvard Business School and to be
"totally dedicated to rock and roll."
"Look at the greats in music. Bach, Beethoven, Rachmaninoff
â€” they're all dead. They aren't making any money. The record
companies are making money," Grimes said.
According to Vomit, "the Monkees are our heroes. The
Monkees were the band. The Beatles got all the publicity. The
Monkees were the band. Our only consolation is that the
Monkees have been reincarnated as Kiss."
"This society has got no heroes. And we ain't music." Grimes
tried to snarl. It didn't work.
Now dear reader, you may accuse me of trying to intellectualize
punk rock, which is a current debate going on among those of
this trade who are no longer interested in merely following Mick
Jagger from tryst to tryst. Punk need not be intellectual. It need
not be based on anarchy or Marxism or any of the other isms to
which it has been assigned. But it should have some basis. And
the Scabs don't.
But see them in concert. Buy their record. It's available at 117
Soto, in Wilbur. It may not make you want to put a safety pin
through your cheek, but at least you'll be prepared for Blondie,
The Deamons, and everyone else who lives on the East Coast.
