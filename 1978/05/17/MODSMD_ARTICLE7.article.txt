# Are you in danger of losing your hearing?

Students who spend long hours soaking in
the high-volume, pulsating throb of rock
music may be losing more than must just
study time.
Though the evidence is not conclusive,
cases of temporary and permanent hearing
loss as a result of prolonged exposure to the
blasting amplified sounds of rock have been
reported.
"Nationwide, we're seeing many more
people with these types of hearing losses
than before," said Kathy Cooper, au
diologist at the Stanford Medical School.
"What happens is people get subtle
changes in their hearing, and young people
aren't noticing it," she said.
Dr. John Christensen, an ear specialist list
at the Palo Alto Clinic, said he has seen cases
where members of rock groups had a dam
aged the nerve which transmits inner-ear
vibrations to the brain.
Dr. Karl Kryter, a staff scientist at Stanford
Research Institute, agreed that rock musi
cians probably do receive the most hearing
damage.
"It's the musicians who are in more
jeopardy than the audience, becausfe of their
greater exposure," he said.
He said the effects become apparent usu

ally after four or five years.
Cooper estimated amplified rock music
measures in the 90-and-above decibel
range.
In general, the 85-decibel level is consi
dered the maximum safe level for any
lengthy period.
Hearing loss caused by loud music affects
mainly higher frequencies, so that many are
not even aware of the damage, she said.
Cases where a person's normal hearing
returns a couple hours after prolonged ex
posure to blaring amps have been well
documented, Cooper said.
"But by continually exposing themselves,
that's where the hearing loss may occur,"
she added.
But Dr. Earl Schubert, director of Stan
ford's audiology department, believes the
evidence of irreparable hearing damage as a
result of prolonged exposure to amplified
music is "inconclusive."
"People are not convinced the damage
will be permanent, and there is some evi
dence for that," he said.
He likened listening to loud amplified
music to drinking: "It's a question of balanc
ing off the pleasure with the possible ef
fects."
