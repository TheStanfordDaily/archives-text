T.ie San Francisco Symphony, under the direction of Edo de
Waart, has offered a spirited and diverse selection of music dur
ing its 1978 season.
Familiar works of the orchestral repertoire — Flgar's "Enigma
Variations," Beethoven's "Symphony No. 3" and Tchaikowsky's
"Swan Lake" — have been performed alongside symphony pre
mieres of important modern compositions and lesser-known
works of great composers.
The quality of visiting artists has also distinguished the 1978
season. Visiting conductors include Seiji Ozawa and several ris
ing young conductors; among the guest artists have been Isaac
Stern, Andre Watts and Alicia de Larrocha. San Francisco audi
ences have welcomed young artists-such as Radu Lupu, pianist,
and liana Vered, whose debut performance with the Symphony
of Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini" highligh
ted one of the season's earlier concerts.
Variety and outstanding guest artists will be emphasized again
in the symphony's 1979 season. De Waart will begin the season
with an all Stravinsky concert featuring "The Rite of Spring." An
all-Beethoven concert will follow, and later in the season an all
Bach program conducted by the well-known baroque interpreter
Nikolaus Harnoncourt.
Among the other guest artists next year will be Andre Watts,
)anet Baker, Misha Dichter and Michael Tilson Thomas. The San
Francisco Chorus will join the Symphony in Verdi's "Four Sacred
Pieces," Dvorak's "Stabat Mater," and Berlioz' "The Damnation
of Faust."

the San Francisco Symphony at less than half the regular price if
they purchase student tickets. Prices for a 12-concert series dur
ing the 1978 season ranged from $50 in the orchestra to $36 for
side balcony seats located almost in the rafters of the Opera
House. For those not willing to invest in an entire series of tickets,
