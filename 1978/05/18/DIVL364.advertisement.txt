If you're afraid of
cancer you're not alone.
But some people are so afraid
that, they won't go to the
doctor when they suspect
something's wrong
They're afraid the
doctor might "find some
thing" This kind of fear can
I prevent them from discover
I ing cancer in the early stages
when it is mast often curable
These people run the
risk of letting cancer scare
them to death
