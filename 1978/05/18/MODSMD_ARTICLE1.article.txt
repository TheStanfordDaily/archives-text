What are you doing when you touch your stapes
with your metacarpals? Who was the English pope?
What famous battle was decided by a person's organ ?
The Stanford College Bowl team won the national
title in Miami last weekend by answering questions
like these and more in only three seconds each.
Team members include Peter Friedland, a graduate
student in computer science and housing associateat
Florence Moore; lonathan Reider, a graduate student
in the History of Social Theory; [David Weinstein, a
graduate student in applied physics, and the only
undergraduate member, Ted Gioia, an English major.
The team first defeated seven other California
schools to take the state title then went on to Miami.
National champs
The team defeated Yale 260-200 to take the national
championship after first defeating Rutgers, Cornell
and Morris Harvey College of Charleston, W.Va.
The team then faced the British team in the interna
tional competition and was defeated. However, there
is a tentative rematch scheduled for the fall, to take
place in England.
The College Bowl is sponsored by Reader's Digest,
NBC Television Network and Smith Corona.
"College Bowl questions are academic in nature,
instead of just basic trivia questions," Gioia said.
The team members said they did not prepare for
the final matches. However, members said that other
school's team members did study the College Bowl
Almanac, which reportedly contains questions asked

in the matches.
"We just thought it would be better not to study
that thing; we were really a lot better than the other
schools," Weinstein said.
The team won a $7500 scholarship which goes to
the University, a silver bowl and each member re
ceived a silver medal.
In addition, the final matches will be televised on
KGO-TV Channel 7 sometime in the next two months,
and a regular regional College Bowl series may be
started sometime in the fall, also to be televised.
Team members had mixed reactions about the
week-long stay in Miami Beach.
Too humid
"The weather is much nicer here," Friedland said.
"It's too humid there. There isn't that much beach,
even at low tide. There were mostly a lot of retired
people."
He took a computer terminal along to keep him
busy when the team wasn't rehearsing for the televi
sion cameras.
Reider said the stay was boring at times, just "sit
ting around and doing nothing. Plus, you miss a week
of school."
Future contestants might be interested in the cor
rect responses to the sample College Bowl questions.
