# Western Culture an inadequate proposal
##

(This is the second of a two-part arti
cle.)
On May 2, the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies (CUS) pre
sented its preliminary recommenda
tion for a requirement in Western
Culture. CUS recommends that the
next two academic years be set aside
as an "experimental period" during
which several three-quarter sequ
ences — though no more than six —
would be tried as voluntary pilot
tracks.
A Committee on the Western Cul
ture Requirement thereafter would
decide which of the pilot sequences
would satisfy the requirement, to be
instituted September 1980. The re
quirement would then be given a
three-year mandate after which time
the courses and the requirement it
self would be re-evaluated.
This proposal suffers from several
serious defects. Three of the six
sequences would consist of the
Structured Liberal Education prog
ram (SLE), the History 1-2-3
sequnece, and the Humanities 61-

-62-63 sequence.
The fourth would probably be a
scaled-down version of the Preferred
Model (the plan recommended by
the Task Force); the fifth, a series
developed by faculty in the program
in Values, Technology and Society
(VTS), and the sixth, possibly, a
sequence proposed by Professors
Abernethy, Duus, Kennedy and
Wirth.
SLE, as a residentially based prog
ram is necessarily small, and could
not satisfy the Western Culture re
quirement. The History series, in
order to meet the criteria proposed
by CUS, would have to broaden its
approach and expand its coverage to
include the medieval and classical
periods. Such compromises could
very well diminish the quality of what
must be an excellent offering.
The Humanities series, too, would
have to significantly alter its format in
order to meet the CUS criteria. In
addition, the inevitable expansion of
its enrollment would intensify dif
ficulties in staffing — given that TA's
currently must have completed a
two-year seminar.
Thus, its inclusion in the Western
Culture program would seriously
threaten its quality. As for the Aber
nethy and VTS proposals, and par
ticuarly the Preferred Model, they
could not play a significant role in
any future requirement in the ab
sence of new and substantial funding.
What, then, is the purpose of an
"experimental period" if many of the
results can be determined in ad
vance? The quality of current prog
rams would suffer from their inclu
sion in the Western Culture re
quirement, and the development of
new programs of commensurate
quality would seem impossible due

to the inavailablility of funding.
Is it really even an experiment?
Will those who invest significant time
and energy into developing a new
sequence be willing to.scrap it if it is
lacking in quality or popularity? How
will an experiment with six major var
iables be evaluated ? And — by
whom?
As we contended in our original
statement, it seems likely that the
multi-track scheme would rapidly
degenerate into nothing more than a
tightened up version of the recently
abolished humanities sequence re
quirement. The University has
neither the desire nor the resources
to develop a truly innovative and ex
cellent program in Western Culture.
The fact that many members of the
faculty are nevertheless willing to
support an inadequate requirement
leads us to believe that they are not
motivated solely by the desire to
offer Stanford undergraduates a
"liberal education."
Stanford has acquired a national
reputation as a university where en
gineering and the natural sciences
predominate. Faculty in the
humanities and social sciences have
a vested interest in altering that im
age, and the implementation for a
Western Culture requirement would
be a great step toward that end.
Without a doubt, the net results
would be increased enrollments in
humanities and social sciences, in
creased funding to these depart
ments, expanded programs and ad
ditional faculty. Such a coup d'etat
would serve to attract new grants and
top-notch scholars, and provide a
shot in the arm to the professional
careers of current faculty.
Of far greater importance to stu-

dents is the general trend nationally
towards more "structured" under
graduate education — a move openly
advocated by President Lyman and
Dean Royden. The loose rationale
used to justify the Western Culture
Requirement can, and in all probabil
ity will, be used to justify additional
requirements in other fields of study.
'Faculty knows best'
The wide course offerings and the
freedom of choice that students
enjoy today are the result of a long
and arduous journey away from the
"good ol' days" when faculty always
knew best. These achievements
should not be surrendered without a
fight.
The CUS was directed to propose a
requirement for the study of West
ern Culture. The task force re
sponded with a proposal which had
the potential for being a valuable ad
dition to the undergraduate cur
riculum — the Preferred Model.
The Faculty Senate rejected that
proposal, and it is our conviction that
they should have the courage and
integrity to reject other proposals
which are not just "second-best" but
"second rate."
President Lyman has said that "we
shouldn't allow 'first-best' to be the
enemy of 'good.' " But he has also
stated that "If our education costs a
lot, then it must be worth a lot. If we
compromise on quality we shall lose
our attractiveness as an educational
institution."
We agree wholeheartedly.

humanities and social sciences have
a vested interest in altering that im
age, and the implementation for a
Western Culture requirement would
be a great step toward that end.
Without a doubt, the net results
would be increased enrollments in
humanities and social sciences, in
creased funding to these depart
ments, expanded programs and ad
ditional faculty. Such a coup d'etat
would serve to attract new grants and
top-notch scholars, and provide a
shot in the arm to the professional
careers of current faculty.
Of far greater importance to stu-

dents is the general trend nationally
towards more "structured" under
graduate education — a move openly
advocated by President Lyman and
Dean Royden. The loose rationale
used to justify the Western Culture
Requirement can, and in all probabil
ity will, be used to justify additional
requirements in other fields of study.
'Faculty knows best'
The wide course offerings and the
freedom of choice that students
enjoy today are the result of a long
and arduous journey away from the
"good ol' days" when faculty always
knew best. These achievements
should not be surrendered without a
fight.
The CUS was directed to propose a
requirement for the study of West
ern Culture. The task force re
sponded with a proposal which had
the potential for being a valuable ad
dition to the undergraduate cur
riculum — the Preferred Model.
The Faculty Senate rejected that
proposal, and it is our conviction that
they should have the courage and
integrity to reject other proposals
which are not just "second-best" but
"second rate."
President Lyman has said that "we
shouldn't allow 'first-best' to be the
enemy of 'good.' " But he has also
stated that "If our education costs a
lot, then it must be worth a lot. If we
compromise on quality we shall lose
our attractiveness as an educational
institution."
We agree wholeheartedly.

On May 2, the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies (CUS) pre
sented its preliminary recommenda
tion for a requirement in Western
Culture. CUS recommends that the
next two academic years be set aside
as an "experimental period" during
which several three-quarter sequ
ences — though no more than six —
would be tried as voluntary pilot
tracks.
A Committee on the Western Cul
ture Requirement thereafter would
decide which of the pilot sequences
would satisfy the requirement, to be
instituted September 1980. The re
quirement would then be given a
three-year mandate after which time
the courses and the requirement it
self would be re-evaluated.
This proposal suffers from several
serious defects. Three of the six
sequences would consist of the
Structured Liberal Education prog
ram (SLE), the History 1-2-3
sequnece, and the Humanities 61-

-62-63 sequence.
The fourth would probably be a
scaled-down version of the Preferred
Model (the plan recommended by
the Task Force); the fifth, a series
developed by faculty in the program
in Values, Technology and Society
(VTS), and the sixth, possibly, a
sequence proposed by Professors
Abernethy, Duus, Kennedy and
Wirth.
SLE, as a residentially based prog
ram is necessarily small, and could
not satisfy the Western Culture re
quirement. The History series, in
order to meet the criteria proposed
by CUS, would have to broaden its
approach and expand its coverage to
include the medieval and classical
periods. Such compromises could
very well diminish the quality of what
must be an excellent offering.
The Humanities series, too, would
have to significantly alter its format in
order to meet the CUS criteria. In
addition, the inevitable expansion of
its enrollment would intensify dif
ficulties in staffing — given that TA's
currently must have completed a
two-year seminar.
Thus, its inclusion in the Western
Culture program would seriously
threaten its quality. As for the Aber
nethy and VTS proposals, and par
ticuarly the Preferred Model, they
could not play a significant role in
any future requirement in the ab
sence of new and substantial funding.
What, then, is the purpose of an
"experimental period" if many of the
results can be determined in ad
vance? The quality of current prog
rams would suffer from their inclu
sion in the Western Culture re
quirement, and the development of
new programs of commensurate
quality would seem impossible due

to the inavailablility of funding.
Is it really even an experiment?
Will those who invest significant time
and energy into developing a new
sequence be willing to.scrap it if it is
lacking in quality or popularity? How
will an experiment with six major var
iables be evaluated ? And — by
whom?
As we contended in our original
statement, it seems likely that the
multi-track scheme would rapidly
degenerate into nothing more than a
tightened up version of the recently
abolished humanities sequence re
quirement. The University has
neither the desire nor the resources
to develop a truly innovative and ex
cellent program in Western Culture.
The fact that many members of the
faculty are nevertheless willing to
support an inadequate requirement
leads us to believe that they are not
motivated solely by the desire to
offer Stanford undergraduates a
"liberal education."
Stanford has acquired a national
reputation as a university where en
gineering and the natural sciences
predominate. Faculty in the
