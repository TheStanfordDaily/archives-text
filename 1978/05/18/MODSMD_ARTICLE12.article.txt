# ISSUES: Coors earns award; Puerto Rico exploited by U.S.
## 
### 
Model programs
I read «\ <th interest Joey George's
column on the Coors beer boycott
(Daily, May 15). George was advocat
ing the boycott of Coors beer in sol
idarity with the workers' "strike."
As ? resident of Golden, Colorado,
during the first several months of the
strike I became aware of many as
pects of this situation that were not
brought up in George's column.
Less than one-third of eligible
Coors employees recognized the
union as their bargaining representa
tive before the strike, and when the
strike was declared, some union
members crossed the picket line.
Production at the brewery was not
affected by the strike.
By the time the summer rush was
on, Coors had replaced the striking
wor! ers with people who were eager
to work (one man's scab is another
man's breadwinner). Many of the
striking workers soon found jobs
elsewhere.
The original dispute was over
seniority rights, and, as George con
tends, the dispute grew into minority
discrimination. There seems to be a
contradiction of causes here. The
issue of the strike was Coors' policy
of promoting employees oh the basis
of merit, rather than on years on the
job.
Minority groups elsewhere have
fought for merit promotions, as past
discrimination has provided non
minority workers seniority over their
minority counter-parts.

What is Coors to do? Damned if
they do, damned if they don't! It
seems that minority activist groups,
these days, can find discrimination
wherever they look for it!
George seemed aghast by the local
Coors' representative p r oviding
six-packs, bar signs, and literature to
fraternities. It is not unusual for
manufacturers to provide free sam
ples to prospective customers.
I was surprised by George's two
references to the "attractive" woman
Coors represenatative. I would have
thought that he (being an advocate of
progressive ideas) would be more
sensitive to feminist ideals.
I don't drink much Coors beer my
self; I prefer more hearty brews.
However, other beer drinkers who
may be considering boycotting
Coors should consider this: Coors'
environmental programs are the
model of the brewing industry.
According to the EPA, "Coors has
earned the U.S. Environmental Pro
tection Agency's environmental
achievement award for its total en
vironmental program which in
cluded aluminum and glass recycl
ing, waste treatment, air and sound
pollution control, and environmen
tal planning."
Because the boycott's motives and
propaganda have been so weak,
Coors sales have not been greatly af
fected.

Puerto Rican plight
At a time when campus attention
has been focused on South Africa
and Stanford University's role in the
oppression of these peoples, we be
lieve it is imperative that similar at
tention be given to the role of the
United States in relationship to its
own colonies, such as Puerto Rico.
U.S. colonialism in Puerto Rico
dates back to the Spanish-American
war in 1898. During the military oc
cupation which ensued, large U.S.-
owned plantations displaced small
farmers, drained profits from the
economy, and tied it to that of the
United States in a relationship of de
pendency.
The U.S. economic penetration in
Puerto Rico is so widespread that
Puerto Rico produces what she does
not consume and consumes what
she does not produce.
The pollution of the environment
by great petrochemical complexes,
the dependence of the majority of
the people on food stamps, the
sterilization of 35 per cent of the
women of child-bearing age, and cul
tural assimilation are all proof of the
exploitative nature of the U.S.-
Puerto Rico relationship.
The situation of the majority of the
two million Puerto Rican residents of
the continental United States is no
less critical. The poverty and power
lessness of these Puerto Ricans is
evident in the dismal employment fi
gures:
—in 1978 28 per cent lived below
the poverty line;

—55 per cent of the labor force
lacked a high school diploma;
—28 per cent were unemployed
sometime during that year;
—the median annual earnings for
time male workers was $8500 as
compared to $13,000 for white non
hispanic males.
Like Blacks, Chicanos, Native
Americans and other minority
groups, Puerto Ricans share the
same insitutionalized inequities in
herent in racial discrimination,
segregation in housing and employ
ment, unequal educational oppor
tunity, cultural stereotyping and neg
lect in vital social services.
Despite the oppression and disen
franchisement, despite our relatively
small numbers, Puerto Ricans are not
and never have been a docile people.
Leaders have never been lacking in
our liberation efforts, be it in the
labor movement, the formation of
militant political groups, the efforts
of committed student and commun
ity movements, or even in that "hot
bed of complacency," Stanford Uni
versity.
Whether in international fdrums
such as the United Nations, or in the
occupied offices of university ad
ministrators, the voices of Puerto
Ricans have been raised in loud
protest demanding the rights of
self-determination, equal opportun
ity and economic justice.

time male workers was $8500 as
compared to $13,000 for white non
hispanic males.
Like Blacks, Chicanos, Native
Americans and other minority
groups, Puerto Ricans share the
same insitutionalized inequities in
herent in racial discrimination,
segregation in housing and employ
ment, unequal educational oppor
tunity, cultural stereotyping and neg
lect in vital social services.
Despite the oppression and disen
franchisement, despite our relatively
small numbers, Puerto Ricans are not
and never have been a docile people.
Leaders have never been lacking in
our liberation efforts, be it in the
labor movement, the formation of
militant political groups, the efforts
of committed student and commun
ity movements, or even in that "hot
bed of complacency," Stanford Uni
versity.
Whether in international fdrums
such as the United Nations, or in the
occupied offices of university ad
ministrators, the voices of Puerto
Ricans have been raised in loud
protest demanding the rights of
self-determination, equal opportun
ity and economic justice.

I read «\ <th interest Joey George's
column on the Coors beer boycott
(Daily, May 15). George was advocat
ing the boycott of Coors beer in sol
idarity with the workers' "strike."
As ? resident of Golden, Colorado,
during the first several months of the
strike I became aware of many as
pects of this situation that were not
brought up in George's column.
Less than one-third of eligible
Coors employees recognized the
union as their bargaining representa
tive before the strike, and when the
strike was declared, some union
members crossed the picket line.
Production at the brewery was not
affected by the strike.
By the time the summer rush was
on, Coors had replaced the striking
wor! ers with people who were eager
to work (one man's scab is another
man's breadwinner). Many of the
striking workers soon found jobs
elsewhere.
The original dispute was over
seniority rights, and, as George con
tends, the dispute grew into minority
discrimination. There seems to be a
contradiction of causes here. The
issue of the strike was Coors' policy
of promoting employees oh the basis
of merit, rather than on years on the
job.
Minority groups elsewhere have
fought for merit promotions, as past
discrimination has provided non
minority workers seniority over their
minority counter-parts.

What is Coors to do? Damned if
they do, damned if they don't! It
seems that minority activist groups,
these days, can find discrimination
wherever they look for it!
George seemed aghast by the local
Coors' representative p r oviding
six-packs, bar signs, and literature to
fraternities. It is not unusual for
manufacturers to provide free sam
ples to prospective customers.
I was surprised by George's two
references to the "attractive" woman
Coors represenatative. I would have
thought that he (being an advocate of
progressive ideas) would be more
sensitive to feminist ideals.
I don't drink much Coors beer my
self; I prefer more hearty brews.
However, other beer drinkers who
may be considering boycotting
Coors should consider this: Coors'
environmental programs are the
model of the brewing industry.
According to the EPA, "Coors has
earned the U.S. Environmental Pro
tection Agency's environmental
achievement award for its total en
vironmental program which in
cluded aluminum and glass recycl
ing, waste treatment, air and sound
pollution control, and environmen
tal planning."
Because the boycott's motives and
propaganda have been so weak,
Coors sales have not been greatly af
fected.

Puerto Rican plight
At a time when campus attention
has been focused on South Africa
and Stanford University's role in the
oppression of these peoples, we be
lieve it is imperative that similar at
tention be given to the role of the
United States in relationship to its
own colonies, such as Puerto Rico.
U.S. colonialism in Puerto Rico
dates back to the Spanish-American
war in 1898. During the military oc
cupation which ensued, large U.S.-
owned plantations displaced small
farmers, drained profits from the
economy, and tied it to that of the
United States in a relationship of de
pendency.
The U.S. economic penetration in
Puerto Rico is so widespread that
Puerto Rico produces what she does
not consume and consumes what
she does not produce.
The pollution of the environment
by great petrochemical complexes,
the dependence of the majority of
the people on food stamps, the
sterilization of 35 per cent of the
women of child-bearing age, and cul
tural assimilation are all proof of the
exploitative nature of the U.S.-
Puerto Rico relationship.
The situation of the majority of the
two million Puerto Rican residents of
the continental United States is no
less critical. The poverty and power
lessness of these Puerto Ricans is
evident in the dismal employment fi
gures:
—in 1978 28 per cent lived below
the poverty line;

—55 per cent of the labor force
lacked a high school diploma;
—28 per cent were unemployed
sometime during that year;
—the median annual earnings for
time male workers was $8500 as
compared to $13,000 for white non
hispanic males.

Americans and other minority
