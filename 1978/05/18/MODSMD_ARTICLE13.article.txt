# Ex-L.A. police chief runs for governor
## Davis wants to rescue government 
### 
Weavervillc (AP) — Ed Davis gestured
vigorously with his right hand, accentuat
ing each word: "I am neither a lawyer nor a
member of the Sierra Club."
A ripple of laughter spread through the
crowd of 65 people in the brick town
square by the 124-year-old Trinity County
Court House at the center of this small
Northern California town.
They had come to see Davis, a 60-year
old candidate for the Republican nomina
tion for governor, and the grey-haired,
blunt-speaking former Los Angeles police
chief was entertaining them.
Davis was telling them what he told au
diences all over California — that he is
against much more than Democratic Gov.
Edmund Brown Jr. and his frturCOP rivals.
He is also against the federal govern
ment, the state Legislature, bureaucrats,
the press, "phony" ecologists, liberals and
"social tinkerers" of all stripe in and out of
government.
Gun control
At the town square, the next question
was about gun control.
Davis said he had a plan. He would take
his life membership plaque from the Na
tional Rifle Association and put it directly
behind his desk in the governor's office.
Then every time photographers took his
picture, they'd show that plaque as a re
minder of where California's chief execu
tive stands.
"We're going to keep our guns in this
state. Nobody's going to take them away."
Davis said. "Gun control hasn't worked
anyplace in the world. We shouldn't tryto
disarm the decent, law-abiding citizen."
Davis describes himself as a common
man who will rescue government from the
elitists and return it to the common
people.
In some polls he is the leading conten
der for the Republican nomination. In
others, he is a close second to Attorney

General Evelle Younger.
To supporters, Davis is a charismatic
conservative who will duplicate Ronald
Reagan's triumph of a dozen years ago,
winning the governorship on his first run
for public office.
Foes call him "Crazy Ed," an opponent
of social programs and advocate of harsh
law enforcement. In their views, he is
dangerous not only for what he advocates,
but because he is attracting such broad
support for his views.
On the campaign trail, Davis tells audi
ences that Brown and the Legislature rep
resent "a priesthood of powerful polti
cians" insensitive to the people. And the
state's countless boards and commissions
are an oppressive fourth branch of gov
ernment, accountable to noone.
"We're going to take government off
our back. That's really our mission, top
reserve the American Revolution," Davis
said.
Fourth branch
"Through the various boards and com
missions in the state today, we have a
fourth branch of government — adminis
trators and bureaucrats who have been
granted rule-making authority that is more
tyrannical in California today than King
George was in the Revolution," Davis says.
"Real leadership comes from the per
ception of what the needs and aspirations
and desires of the citizens are," he says.
"And do you know what it is the people
want in California today. It's 'Leave me
alone! Stop regulating me so much! Stop
taxing me so much!' "
Davis has tied his campaign closely to
Proposition 13, the property tax cut initia
tive by Howard Jarvis that would slash
homeowner and business property taxes
by 57 per cent.
Davis calls it a Magna Carta for tax
payers, essential to curb government's
growth. As governor, Davis says he would

see that 13 works by cutting "fat and frills."
He would, for example, cut all special
programs in schools, reducing the cur
riculum to basics such as reading, writing
and mathematics.
Quoted polls
Davis constantly quotes the polls, which
lately have brought nothing but good
news for him.
"We know our areas of strength, where
to get out the vote. Ours is a very scientific
campaign as well as a human campaign,"
Davis says. ,
A confident candidate, Davis is some
times a little pompous, but with a sense of
humor.
He delights in comments which liberals
describe as "outrageous," because they
"really twist the liberals' tails," and he be
rates reporters who try to interpret those
comments.
A few years ago, for example, Davis
suggested that the way to deal with hijac
kers was to bring temporary courtrooms
and portable gallows to the airports, try
the hijackers there, fly in the Supreme
Court to review the case and insure due
process, and then "hang them at the air
port."
Comment literally
Should that comment be taken literally,
Davis was asked, or should it be inter
preted as a metaphor intended to
dramatize his concern with long delays in
bringing criminals to trial.
"I said 'hang them at the airpotrt.' I
chose that as the title for a book. And let
me tell you that most people believe that
hijackers should be hung at the airport,"
he said.
"I mean exatly what I say," Davis added
a moment later. "Do you reporters have a
license to practice psychiatry? Why do you
have a problem with the idea that I say
exactly what I mean?"

He is also against the federal govern
ment, the state Legislature, bureaucrats,
the press, "phony" ecologists, liberals and
"social tinkerers" of all stripe in and out of
government.
Gun control
At the town square, the next question
was about gun control.
Davis said he had a plan. He would take
his life membership plaque from the Na
tional Rifle Association and put it directly
behind his desk in the governor's office.
Then every time photographers took his
picture, they'd show that plaque as a re
minder of where California's chief execu
tive stands.
"We're going to keep our guns in this
state. Nobody's going to take them away."
Davis said. "Gun control hasn't worked
anyplace in the world. We shouldn't tryto
disarm the decent, law-abiding citizen."
Davis describes himself as a common
man who will rescue government from the
elitists and return it to the common
people.
In some polls he is the leading conten
der for the Republican nomination. In
others, he is a close second to Attorney

General Evelle Younger.
To supporters, Davis is a charismatic
conservative who will duplicate Ronald
Reagan's triumph of a dozen years ago,
winning the governorship on his first run
for public office.
Foes call him "Crazy Ed," an opponent
of social programs and advocate of harsh
law enforcement. In their views, he is
dangerous not only for what he advocates,
but because he is attracting such broad
support for his views.
On the campaign trail, Davis tells audi
ences that Brown and the Legislature rep
resent "a priesthood of powerful polti
cians" insensitive to the people. And the
state's countless boards and commissions
are an oppressive fourth branch of gov
ernment, accountable to noone.
"We're going to take government off
our back. That's really our mission, top
reserve the American Revolution," Davis
said.
Fourth branch
"Through the various boards and com
missions in the state today, we have a
fourth branch of government — adminis
trators and bureaucrats who have been
granted rule-making authority that is more
tyrannical in California today than King
George was in the Revolution," Davis says.
"Real leadership comes from the per
ception of what the needs and aspirations
and desires of the citizens are," he says.
"And do you know what it is the people
want in California today. It's 'Leave me
alone! Stop regulating me so much! Stop
taxing me so much!' "
Davis has tied his campaign closely to
Proposition 13, the property tax cut initia
tive by Howard Jarvis that would slash
homeowner and business property taxes
by 57 per cent.
Davis calls it a Magna Carta for tax
payers, essential to curb government's
growth. As governor, Davis says he would

see that 13 works by cutting "fat and frills."
He would, for example, cut all special
programs in schools, reducing the cur
riculum to basics such as reading, writing
and mathematics.
Quoted polls
Davis constantly quotes the polls, which
lately have brought nothing but good
news for him.
"We know our areas of strength, where
to get out the vote. Ours is a very scientific
campaign as well as a human campaign,"
Davis says. ,
A confident candidate, Davis is some
times a little pompous, but with a sense of
humor.
He delights in comments which liberals
describe as "outrageous," because they
"really twist the liberals' tails," and he be
rates reporters who try to interpret those
comments.
A few years ago, for example, Davis
suggested that the way to deal with hijac
kers was to bring temporary courtrooms
and portable gallows to the airports, try
the hijackers there, fly in the Supreme
Court to review the case and insure due
process, and then "hang them at the air
port."
Comment literally
Should that comment be taken literally,
Davis was asked, or should it be inter
preted as a metaphor intended to
dramatize his concern with long delays in
bringing criminals to trial.
"I said 'hang them at the airpotrt.' I
chose that as the title for a book. And let
me tell you that most people believe that
hijackers should be hung at the airport,"
he said.
"I mean exatly what I say," Davis added
a moment later. "Do you reporters have a
license to practice psychiatry? Why do you
have a problem with the idea that I say
exactly what I mean?"
Weavervillc (AP) — Ed Davis gestured
vigorously with his right hand, accentuat
ing each word: "I am neither a lawyer nor a
member of the Sierra Club."
A ripple of laughter spread through the
crowd of 65 people in the brick town
square by the 124-year-old Trinity County
Court House at the center of this small
Northern California town.
They had come to see Davis, a 60-year
old candidate for the Republican nomina
tion for governor, and the grey-haired,
blunt-speaking former Los Angeles police
chief was entertaining them.
Davis was telling them what he told au
diences all over California — that he is
against much more than Democratic Gov.
Edmund Brown Jr. and his frturCOP rivals.
He is also against the federal govern
ment, the state Legislature, bureaucrats,
