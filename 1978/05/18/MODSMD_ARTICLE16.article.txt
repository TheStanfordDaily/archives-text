Political Science Prof. Nannerl Keohane
is not only a good teacher because of her
stimulating lectures, her enthusiasm
about political theory and her ability to
inspire student discussion. The challenges
she has discovered in her life as a teacher,
feminist, wife and mother, have made her
a particularly exciting and aware profes
sor.
"Things have worked out well because I
have been happy at what I am doing,"
Keohane said. She "never considered
another career besides teaching" after her
junior year at Wellesley College.
Keohane said her education at Wellesley
contributed to her growth as a feminist.
Keohane explained, "It was very important
for me to be at a women's college. There
was nobody else around to do the active,
aggressive things than us."
Keohane found that the atmosphere at
Wellesley encouraged women to take
leadership roles in all social and academic
activities. "I gained a certain kind of confi
dence there that is a little harder to get in a
co-ed environment," she said.
Keohane was born in Arkansas in a small
town on the Mississippi River and grew up
in Texas and Arizona. She attended Ox
ford University for two years on a Marshall
scholarship where she studied a program
in philosophy, politics and economics.
She then completed her graduate work
in political science at Yale University.
Keohane said she chose to specialize in
political theory because "it bridged all my
other interests."
The study of different political thinkers
allowed her to discuss history, literature
and philosophy, "as well as to ask ques

tions about politics," she added.
Keohane's contact with students at Stan
ford has been a very important part of her
â€¢experience as ateacherandafeminist. She
said she finds she is "becoming more and
more committed to feminism all the time,
almost week by week."
Keohane attributed her increasing con
sciousness to social and academic interac
tions with her students and colleagues.
For Keohane, feminism is a kind of con
sciousness or awareness about what other
women have done in the past and are
doing now.
Keohane said her awareness has led her
to open up questions of power and sexual
ity in her political thought class and her
seminar, Freedom and Equality. Keohane
has expanded her syllabus to include
works about women and politics.
She said she feels that making feminist
literature a regular and valid part of the
assigned reading list is a major step in
realizing and accepting feminist princi
ples. Her experiences have also made her
careful to avoid sexist language in her lec
tures.
Next year Keohane is taking the year off
to write a book exploring the reasons why
women have not participated in political
life. Ultimately, she said she hopes to de
velop a feminist political philosophy.
For a long time, Keohane had a "real
block about writing a book. I just didn't
think I would write anything longer than
an essay. Books are so long and so much
more cohesive."
However, she did recently finish a book,
Power and Participation in French Politics,
which will be published by the Princeton
Press. Keohane said that she thinks re

search was responsible for getting her
over her "block" and compelled her to
organize and publish her thoughts.
This year Keohane received tenure. She
said she considers research a vital part of
her teaching career, but she feels the
strong emphasis on research is not the
problem with the tenure system here.
According to Keohane, research makes
a tremendous difference in the quality of
her lectures and her overall approach to
teaching.
Keohane explained that research pro
vides a teacher with a certain rigor or dis
cipline. She said she feels research has
made her expose her ideas to criticism
and, for this reason, she is more open to
change and new ideas.
Despite a busy class schedule, Keohane
tries to keep two days a week clear for
research.
Keohane first started teaching part time
so she could devote more time to her chil
dren at home. However, she found she
was not fulfilled, giving only half of herself
to her job.
She and her husband Robert Keohane,
also a professor in the political science
department here, have been able to raise
three children while pursuing academic
careers.
Keohane described their marriage as
"an equal marriage with no subordinate
partners" in which she and her husband
spend the same amount of time doing the
housework and raising their children.
"Work and family come first," she said.
Keohane advised that the best way to
find out how their working family gets
along is to ask her children, who attend
the Lucille Nixon Elementary School.
