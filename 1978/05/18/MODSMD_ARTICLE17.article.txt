# Amnesty International adopts 'prisoners of conscience'
## 
### Katherine Ellison 
One of the most active groups on campus
these days is Amnesty International's Palo
Alto chapter, Group 19. The 90 mostly
student members organize meetings, fun
draisers, letter-writing campaigns and edu
cational programs throughout the year.
This spring, Group 19 is particularly busy;
its activities include intensive education
campaigns on South Korea and Argentina,
debates on the death penalty, and the
"adoption" of a new prisoner from Czechos
lovakia.
Amnesty International won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1977 mostly because of its
adoption campaigns for "prisoners of con
science." These are defined by the organiza
tion as men or women held for political
reasons which do not include their advoca
cy of violence.
Investigation
Amnesty's technique is to investigate po
tential adoption cases through information
supplied by its own missions and contacts

around the world, and then to offer chosen
cases to its chapters in 32 countries. These
chapters take, on the average, three prison
ers, one each from a right-wing, left-wing
and third world country, following Amnes
ty's non-partisan mandate.
The chapter's subcommittees hold
periodic letter-writing sessions for their
prisoner, imploring foreign government of
ficials to reinvestigate his or her case.
In addition, the sub-groups send money
to the prisoner's family, circulate petitions
to send to foreign governments or their con
sulates, and organize onslaughts of tele
grams if they receive word of imminent tor
ture or execution of their adoptee.
Releases
Over the years, Group 19 has been in
strumental in the release of four prisoners.
One of them, a Greek, was represented in
Costa-Gavras' film, "Z."
As of last month, the group adopted two
prisoners, Whang Hon-Sung, from South
Korea, and Miloslav Cerny of Czechos
lovakia. Whang is a high school teacherfrom

Seoul, who was imprisoned under South
Korea's Emergency Regulations for his par
ticipation in the National Democratic
Youth-Student League.
The regulations under which Whang was
arrested were repealed two months after his
conviction; therefore, under South Korea's
own criminal code, his continued impris
onment is illegal.
Whang's three-year-old adoption by
Group 19 is illustrative of Amnesty's primary
strategy: to urge countries to behave in ac
cordance with their own constitutions.
New adoptee
Group 19 is just beginning to investigate
its new adoptee, Miloslav Cerny. Cerny was
imprisoned a year ago for "incitement." His
crime: distributing 12 leaflets accusing the
Czech government of being afraid to pub
licize the "Charter of '77," a list of human
rights accords which would inform Czechos
lovakian citizens whose rights have been
violated where to go for help. Cerny's con
finement is particularly disturbing as he, a
functional epileptic, is being refused pre

ventative medicine for his seizures.
This quarter, Group 19 will be waging a
"country campaign" on Argentina. The
group aims to educate the Stanford com
munity about the two-year-old military
junta, under which at least 8000 political
prisoners are being held and 15,000 citizens
have disappeared.
The campaign is timed to coincide with
the World Cup Soccer competition to be
held in Argentina in June. While Argentina's
junta has stepped up its public relations ef
forts, hoping the 500 or so expected visiting
journalists will keep their minds on soccer,
Amnesty is trying to redirect international
attention to its overt and violent political
suppression.
General meetings
This year, Group 19 has held general meet
ings every two weeks, while its sub
committees for special projects have met
more often. The group's co-chairmen,
senior Jim Lake and graduate student Steve
Tappel, note with pride the members' high
level of energy and commitment.

"Right now I think it's at its peak," says
Lake. "We've got committed students in
volved to the practical extent possible, work
ing on one campaign or another."
Lake and Tappel will continue as chairmen
next year. Some of their plans include ex
panding this year's SWOPSI-sponsored
course on human rights into a part of the
general curriculum, holding demonstra
tions at consulates and adopting a new pris
oner from Latin America.
For now, however, Group 19 is absorbed
with preparations for its upcoming fun
draiser â€” a dinner this Sunday at the Ather
ton home of Ambassador and Mrs. Rodney
Kennedy-Minott. V.I.P.s in attendance will
include Congressmen Pete McCloskey
(R-San Mateo) and Don Edwards (D-San
Jose), Joan Baez and Richard Lyman. Amnes
ty's international focus will be reflected in
the lasagne dinner, Chilean folk music, Rus
sian icon-exhibit and Greek dancing lessons
offered. For further information and/or re
servations, call 369-4709 or 323-4506.
