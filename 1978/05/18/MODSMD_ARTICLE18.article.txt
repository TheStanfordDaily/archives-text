# Inhibitions let loose at annual Brazilian Carnival
## features 
### Katherine Ellison 
The general consensus on
this Friday's Brazilian Carnival
night, to be held at the Bechtel
l-Center from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.,
is that it will be a time when
inhibitions, self-consciousness
and sobriety will be vigorously
eschewed.
"Everybody wanna dance,
more and more and more!" "A
mob! People really let go," "I
can't really describe the danc
ing style — somebody called it
'exuberant kicking,' " and
"Free Beer?" are only some of
the comments being heard
around campus.
The first Brazilian carnival
originated as a "last chance for
sinning before Lent," accord
ing to Maria Bun, coordinator
of Bechtel's Office for Foreign
Visitors and director of prep
arations for the carnival.
Three themes
The three themes of the
holiday are dancing, drinking
and dressing, and the required
carnival costumes range from
the ridiculous to the sublime
(mostly the ridiculous).
Festivities in Brazil have
reached the point where pre

paratory dancing lessons start
in December. On Mardi Cras,
the day of the carnival, tens of
thousands of people gather in
Rio de Janeiro, sometimes
grouped into identically
costumed clubs of anywhere
from five to 6000.
There one sees flamboyant
parading and posturing in front
of the judging stand, from
which prizes are awarded for
the most beautiful, ugly and
original costumes.
Stanford's ninth annual car
nival will follow this format on
a proportional scale. Bun said
she expects at least 700 to 1000
people to attend the carnival.
Big splash
"It's the only really big
splash we put on this year,"
said Bun, "and it brings a mob
to the l-Center. You really
need that, too, because people
can't really let go without a
mob."
But if the crowds don't pro
vide enough incentive to let
go, "Viva Brazil," the band to
play Friday, will. The band
plays only Brazilian carnival
music, "bossa nova," a type of
jazz with an African beat.

"Viva Brazil," usually
employed by a San Francisco
nightclub, gave a teaser de
monstration at Tresidder yes
terday at noon.
Most of the 56 registered
Brazilian students and their
families at Stanford have been
busy for the past three weeks
putting up fliers, organizing
preparations and, of course,
making their costumes.
Organized clubs
Following the Rio de Janeiro
tradition, there will be at least
two organized clubs at the car
nival. One, made up of several
of the married students, will
dress alike in black costumes
with striped accessories and
plumed hats.
Another, the singles contin
gent, will dress a little wilder.
Its 15 members will dress diffe
rently, but will combine their
energies in an effort to win the
prize for "the happiest block,
the block that doesn't stop
moving," according to
Eduardo Gattaz, who is a prom
inent representative of the
group.
Of course, this does not
mean the married group is too
domesticated to get into the
spirit of the occasion. Their
spokesman, Jose Amarant, de
scribed the night as "a time
when you put out everything
you have — you jump, you
kick, you don't feel any social
inhibitions."

The one remaining element
of mystery in the preparations
for the carnival is what some of
the more prominent par
tygoers are going to wear. Pro
fessors from such varied de
partments as computer science
and Latin American studies all
seemed reluctant to describe
their planned costumes.
Although Bun would not dis
close any details about her cos
tume either, she did make re
commendations for the attire
of the Stanford community.
The spirit of the carnival is
not to spend much on cos
tumes, she warned, although
there are some "obsessed
cases" in stubborn exception
to this rule.
On the whole, the over-100
degree heat at carnival time in
Brazil acts as a "social leveler,"
said Bun, and most Brazilians
appear in various interpreta
tions of half-nakedness.
Stanford students will have
to decide for themselves, of
course, how authentic they
want to dress. "But what we
want," said Bun, "is for you to
put a lightbulb on your head,
and come as stupid as possi
ble."

kick, you don't feel any social
inhibitions."

The one remaining element
of mystery in the preparations
for the carnival is what some of
the more prominent par
tygoers are going to wear. Pro
fessors from such varied de
partments as computer science
and Latin American studies all
seemed reluctant to describe
their planned costumes.
Although Bun would not dis
close any details about her cos
tume either, she did make re
commendations for the attire
of the Stanford community.
The spirit of the carnival is
not to spend much on cos
tumes, she warned, although
there are some "obsessed
cases" in stubborn exception
to this rule.
On the whole, the over-100
degree heat at carnival time in
Brazil acts as a "social leveler,"
said Bun, and most Brazilians
appear in various interpreta
tions of half-nakedness.
Stanford students will have
to decide for themselves, of
course, how authentic they
want to dress. "But what we
want," said Bun, "is for you to
put a lightbulb on your head,
and come as stupid as possi
ble."

year's Brazilian Carnival, to be held this Friday night at Bechtel International Center. ,
The general consensus on
this Friday's Brazilian Carnival
night, to be held at the Bechtel
l-Center from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.,
is that it will be a time when
inhibitions, self-consciousness
and sobriety will be vigorously
eschewed.
"Everybody wanna dance,
more and more and more!" "A
mob! People really let go," "I
can't really describe the danc
ing style — somebody called it
'exuberant kicking,' " and
"Free Beer?" are only some of
the comments being heard
around campus.
The first Brazilian carnival
originated as a "last chance for
sinning before Lent," accord
ing to Maria Bun, coordinator
of Bechtel's Office for Foreign
Visitors and director of prep
arations for the carnival.
Three themes
The three themes of the
holiday are dancing, drinking
and dressing, and the required
carnival costumes range from
the ridiculous to the sublime
(mostly the ridiculous).
Festivities in Brazil have
reached the point where pre

paratory dancing lessons start
in December. On Mardi Cras,
the day of the carnival, tens of
thousands of people gather in
Rio de Janeiro, sometimes
grouped into identically
costumed clubs of anywhere
from five to 6000.
There one sees flamboyant
parading and posturing in front
of the judging stand, from
which prizes are awarded for
the most beautiful, ugly and
original costumes.
Stanford's ninth annual car
nival will follow this format on
a proportional scale. Bun said
she expects at least 700 to 1000
people to attend the carnival.
Big splash
"It's the only really big
splash we put on this year,"
said Bun, "and it brings a mob
to the l-Center. You really
need that, too, because people
can't really let go without a
mob."
But if the crowds don't pro
vide enough incentive to let
go, "Viva Brazil," the band to
play Friday, will. The band
plays only Brazilian carnival
music, "bossa nova," a type of
jazz with an African beat.

"Viva Brazil," usually
employed by a San Francisco
nightclub, gave a teaser de
monstration at Tresidder yes
terday at noon.
Most of the 56 registered
Brazilian students and their
families at Stanford have been
busy for the past three weeks
putting up fliers, organizing
preparations and, of course,
making their costumes.
Organized clubs
Following the Rio de Janeiro
tradition, there will be at least
two organized clubs at the car
nival. One, made up of several
of the married students, will
dress alike in black costumes
with striped accessories and
plumed hats.
Another, the singles contin
gent, will dress a little wilder.
Its 15 members will dress diffe
rently, but will combine their
energies in an effort to win the
prize for "the happiest block,
the block that doesn't stop
moving," according to
Eduardo Gattaz, who is a prom
inent representative of the
group.
Of course, this does not
mean the married group is too
domesticated to get into the
spirit of the occasion. Their
spokesman, Jose Amarant, de
scribed the night as "a time
when you put out everything
you have — you jump, you
kick, you don't feel any social
inhibitions."
