# Researchers may get lower computer rates

Partial relief might be in sight for Stanford
researchers stuck with inadequate computer
budgets, announced representatives of the
Academic Working Group (AWG), a liaison
group between the Stanford Center for In
formation Processing (SCIP) and the facility's
users.
After receiving numerous complaints from
graduate students and junior faculty whose
departments can't supply the computer
funds needed for their research, the AWG
began working to increase SCIP's availability.
"Approximately half of the Academic
Computing Fund now goes to the Low Over
head Timesharing System (LOTS)," said AWG
member Gloria Guth, "leaving unsponsored
researchers without enough funds for SCIP
computing."
Empty-handed
"Social science data sets typically exceed
the size limitations of the LOTS system,'' said
David Pasta, also of the AWG, "so many re
searchers are left empty-handed."
Since the SCIP 370/168 computer has a
much greater capacity than the LOTS compu
ter, but isn't fully used during evening and
weekend hours, the AWG proposed estab

lishing special accounts to run certain types
of programs during those hours, at greatly
reduced rates.
"Jobs taking less than six seconds to exe
cute (running in Class Q) would be charged
at a flat rate of about 25 cents," said Pasta,
"not counting the printing."
Emergency aid
"Also, there is a possibility of receiving
emergency aid to assist researchers whose
work has been forced to a halt by a lack of
computer funds," said Guth.
The AWG, in cooperation with the Office
of the Dean of Humanities and Sciences, is
surveying graduate students, junior faculty
and department heads to assess the need for
the proposed low-cost batch accounts.
Approximately 7000 questionnaires will be
distributed through department mailboxes
early next week. According to Guth, the sur
vey asks computer users if they have enough
computer money to get their research done.
"Widespread interest in these accounts
could make them available this summer, well
ahead of SCIP's current estimate," Pasta said.
