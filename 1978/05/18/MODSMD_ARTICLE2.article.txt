# Three houses put 'on notice
## Number of housing draw participants jumps 
### Cheryl Zollars 
The round one results of next
year's housing draw were posted
yesterday.
And the results show an increasing
number of people who want on
campus housing, a change in the
cut-off draw number for men, and
three row houses being put on
"notice," according to Office of Re
sidential Education Administrative
Assistant Phil Curry.
A total of 3754 students entered
this year's draw, drawing for only
2671 available spaces.
Curry said the number of people
entering the draw increased this
year, after a decrease during the last
several years. More women also en
tered the draw, Curry added, 1668

compared to 1543 last year.
"On the one hand, people are
starting to understand the guaran
teed housing plan a little better,
realizing that in their non
guaranteed year they can still enter
the draw and have a chance at hous
ing," Curry said.
"The other thing we're sensitive to
is the possibility that off-campus ren
tal rates are climbing, making on
campus housing relatively more at
tractive," he added.
Columbae House and the French
Theme House, which had four and
five vacancies respectively at the end
of round one, and also Synergy
House are being put "on notice" by
the University because of a lack of
"demand," Curry said.

Those house members were told
that "there should be substantial im
provement in student demand" or
the houses will be reviewed next
winter, he said.
Priorities relaxed
Curry said although priorities are
relaxed in round two, the housing
office restricts admittance to priority
houses such as the French theme
house in round one "so that only
people who both choose the house
and have a priority to it can get as
signed," he said.
Curry said that a few more stu
dents will be admitted to that house
after the restriction is relaxed.
But the "depth of demand beyond
that is not terribly high," he added.
Columbae House had no such re
striction and it was not filled, Curry
said.
Synery House, which was not re
stricted either, "did not have any
vacancies but it did have a large
number of people who were as
signed without any priority," Curry
said.
"That's not, in the long term, a
good outlook for the house," he ad
ded.
Co-op houses
Curry said there will have to be
increased interest in getting
priorities for the co-ops such as
Synergy and Columbae, for those
houses to be open next year.
The problem "for these houses is
that when they have vacancies they
may find their board and room bills
getting relatively high," he added.
Curry said that the housing office
would not make any general assign
ments to these houses during the
draw, but would be willing to discuss
this possibility with the houses later.
"Usually the houses aren't in
terested," he added.
Change in cut-off
This year's draw showed a change
in the cut-off draw numbers for men,
according to Curry.

"Ever since the guaranteed plan
got started the cut-offs at the end of
round one have fallen among non
guaranteed students," he said. "For
women that's the case again this
year, the cut-off there is 649 for the
non-guaranteed."
This means that any unguaranteed
woman who drew a number higher
than 649 was not assigned.
"The men's cut-off this year actu
ally fell among the very bottom of the
guaranteed people," he said. "The
cut-off is 4991 which means that one
guaranteed male is left out of the as
signable group."
"The cut-offs, especially the
men's, move quite a lot in round
two" because of vacancies created
by men who have joined fraternities.
The most popular residence listed
by students as their first choice was
558 Mayfield, followed by Lambda
Nu, Curry said. Third most popular
was Alpha Sig for men and American
Studies House for women.
Of students' top eight dorm
choices, excluding row houses, both
men and women chose Granada
House in Lagunita Court.
The German Studies House, Haus
Mitteleuropa, which replaces
Simone de Beauvoir House for next
year, filled easily, Curry said.
Curry said that the outlook for
non-guaranteed students is good.
"For the last two years in a row,
everybody who went into the draw
who was not guaranteed, and who
was willing to accept any space we
could find for them and who stayed
on the waiting list throughout the
summer was assigned housing by the
second week of fall quarter," he said.
To get on the waiting list, students
entering the draw can indicate their
interest on the draw cards, and enter
the second round.
Students have until Friday to de
cide whether to accept their first
round housing draw assignments or
to enter the second round.

vacancies but it did have a large
number of people who were as
signed without any priority," Curry
said.
"That's not, in the long term, a
good outlook for the house," he ad
ded.
Co-op houses
Curry said there will have to be
increased interest in getting
priorities for the co-ops such as
Synergy and Columbae, for those
houses to be open next year.
The problem "for these houses is
that when they have vacancies they
may find their board and room bills
getting relatively high," he added.
Curry said that the housing office
would not make any general assign
ments to these houses during the
draw, but would be willing to discuss
this possibility with the houses later.
"Usually the houses aren't in
terested," he added.
Change in cut-off
This year's draw showed a change
in the cut-off draw numbers for men,
according to Curry.

"Ever since the guaranteed plan
got started the cut-offs at the end of
round one have fallen among non
guaranteed students," he said. "For
women that's the case again this
year, the cut-off there is 649 for the
non-guaranteed."
This means that any unguaranteed
woman who drew a number higher
than 649 was not assigned.
"The men's cut-off this year actu
ally fell among the very bottom of the
guaranteed people," he said. "The
cut-off is 4991 which means that one
guaranteed male is left out of the as
signable group."
"The cut-offs, especially the
men's, move quite a lot in round
two" because of vacancies created
by men who have joined fraternities.
The most popular residence listed
by students as their first choice was
558 Mayfield, followed by Lambda
Nu, Curry said. Third most popular
was Alpha Sig for men and American
Studies House for women.
Of students' top eight dorm
choices, excluding row houses, both
men and women chose Granada
House in Lagunita Court.
The German Studies House, Haus
Mitteleuropa, which replaces
Simone de Beauvoir House for next
year, filled easily, Curry said.
Curry said that the outlook for
non-guaranteed students is good.
"For the last two years in a row,
everybody who went into the draw
who was not guaranteed, and who
was willing to accept any space we
could find for them and who stayed
on the waiting list throughout the
summer was assigned housing by the
second week of fall quarter," he said.
To get on the waiting list, students
entering the draw can indicate their
interest on the draw cards, and enter
the second round.
Students have until Friday to de
cide whether to accept their first
round housing draw assignments or
to enter the second round.
The round one results of next
year's housing draw were posted
yesterday.
And the results show an increasing
number of people who want on
campus housing, a change in the
cut-off draw number for men, and
three row houses being put on
"notice," according to Office of Re
sidential Education Administrative
Assistant Phil Curry.
A total of 3754 students entered
this year's draw, drawing for only
2671 available spaces.
Curry said the number of people
entering the draw increased this
year, after a decrease during the last
several years. More women also en
tered the draw, Curry added, 1668

compared to 1543 last year.
"On the one hand, people are
starting to understand the guaran
teed housing plan a little better,
realizing that in their non
guaranteed year they can still enter
the draw and have a chance at hous
ing," Curry said.
"The other thing we're sensitive to
is the possibility that off-campus ren
tal rates are climbing, making on
campus housing relatively more at
tractive," he added.
Columbae House and the French
Theme House, which had four and
five vacancies respectively at the end
of round one, and also Synergy
House are being put "on notice" by
the University because of a lack of
"demand," Curry said.

Those house members were told
that "there should be substantial im
provement in student demand" or
the houses will be reviewed next
winter, he said.
Priorities relaxed
Curry said although priorities are
relaxed in round two, the housing
office restricts admittance to priority
houses such as the French theme
house in round one "so that only
people who both choose the house
and have a priority to it can get as
signed," he said.
Curry said that a few more stu
dents will be admitted to that house
after the restriction is relaxed.
But the "depth of demand beyond
that is not terribly high," he added.
Columbae House had no such re
striction and it was not filled, Curry
said.
Synery House, which was not re
stricted either, "did not have any
vacancies but it did have a large
number of people who were as
signed without any priority," Curry
said.
"That's not, in the long term, a
