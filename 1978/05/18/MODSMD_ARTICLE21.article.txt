# Fourth-place Mayor Wilson running for governor on record
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — Pete Wil
son has traveled back and forth
across California the past two
years for an endless series of
buffet lunches, interviews,
service club dinners, recep
tions and candidate forums.
The 44-year-old mayor of San
Diego says he has campaigned
longer and made more
speeches than the other three
candidates for the Republican
nomination for governor all
combined.
But despite the tens of
thousands of miles of travel
and hundreds of appearances,
Wilson still is fourth in the
voter preference polls, one
rung lower than when he
started.
An attorney and former state
assemblyman, Wilson says the
issue in the GOP primary
should be the record of each of
the candidates, and who has
the best chance of defeating
Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown.
And as N mayor the past six
years of California's second
largest city, he says he has the
best qualifications of the Re
publican contenders to be
governor.
Soft-spoken
Wilson labels himself as "a
good manager" who practices
"positive conservatism."
It's not a message that brings
audiences to their feet cheer
ing. But that wouldn't be Wil
son's style. He is low-keyed,
soft-spoken. He talks about
complex issues, only occa
sionally lapsing into slogans.
Wilson avoids the provoca
tive, controversial comments
of rival GOP candidate Ed
Davis. He says
he believes Republicans will
take a cold hard look at their
candidates and pick him on the
basis of his record in office.

The message seldom
changes:
"I am the only one who has
had to set a tax rate, the only
one who has been engaged in
stimulating economic de
velopment, the only one who
has reduced the ratio of per
manent employees to popula
tion, the only one who has said
to public employees union
leaders threatening an illegal
strike that if they walked off
their jobs we would fire them
and hire replacements the next
morning," Wilson says.
"The result is we have had a
couple of strike threats and no
strikes. That's good manage
ment. I think it's also leader
ship. We've had very little of
either in Sacramento the last
three years.
"It's one thing to talk about
what you would do if elected.
It's another to have done it."
Small crowds
On the campaign, he is wil
ling to listen at length to ques
tions from voters, and he ap
pears unconcerned at the gen
erally small crowds or that fact
that many voters still don't rec
ognize his face or name.
At the state university cam
pus at Chico recently, Wilson
spent 2% hours mingling with
voters at a weekend carnival.
He spoke with only about 30
voters among the 1000 at the
carnival, some for as long as 10
minutes each. He smiled
weakly when the only televi
sion reporter to interview him
that day garbled his name as
"Mayor Pete Davis."
Although Wilson still is not
well known outside of San
Diego, he says the polls don't
accurately reflect his standing
because most of them were
taken before he started his
television commercials.

Most observers see Wilson
competing with Assemblyman
Ken Maddy and Attorney Gen
eral Evellp Younger for the
votes of moderate Republi
cans, while Davis battles
for the conservative
vote.
Younger, the front-runner,
has slipped in the polls, while
Davis and Maddy have gained.
But Wilson has stayed about
even, favored by about one
sixth of the Republican voters.
Wilson has been labeled as a
liberal and an environmentalist
by his foes, but he disputes

those labels and says he stands
for balance and moderation.
One issue on which Wilson
does differ from his GOP rivals
is abortion. He is the only Re
publican contender who sup
ports state funding of abor
tions for women on Medi-Cal.
Agreement
But Wilson says he and his
GOP rivals agree on most is
sues. Therefore, he says, elec
tability in November rather
than ideology should be the
major concern of Republican
voters in the June 6 primary.

"I think you'll find we agree
on the death penalty. I think
you'll find that we agree largely
on the jobs climate in the state.
Very largely we agree on
energy," Wilson says.
"The difference is I have
been a practitioner in most of
the areas that we agree that
Gov. Brown has been deficient
in leadership and manage
ment. I have a record of per
formance and leadership in a
managerial capacity."
The record that Wilson urges
voters to study is both a

strength and liability for him.
He has won GOP support by
opposing public employee
strikes. But he is viewed as an
enemy by organized labor,
which would be a liability in
November if he wins the Re
publican nomination.
San Diego's tax rate has
dropped in recent years to ba
lance off the rising property tax
assessments, which wins some
conservative support for Wil
son.
Wilson has held taxes down
in part by channeling new pro

jects into undeveloped -
kets of the city near existing
city services, rather than allow
ing leapfrog development iflto
outlying areas.
Another troublesome ispue
for Wilson has been tfie
animosity from conservatives
due to Wilson's aggressive
campaigning in 1976 for forrjler
President Gerald Ford andjhis
criticism of former Gtov.
Ronald Reagan.

voters in the June 6 primary.

"I think you'll find we agree
on the death penalty. I think
you'll find that we agree largely

Very largely we agree on

"The difference is I have
been a practitioner in most of
the areas that we agree that
Gov. Brown has been deficient
in leadership and manage

formance and leadership in a
managerial capacity."
The record that Wilson urges
voters to study is both a

strength and liability for him.
He has won GOP support by
opposing public employee
strikes. But he is viewed as an
enemy by organized labor,
which would be a liability in
November if he wins the Re
publican nomination.

Sacramento (AP) — Pete Wil
son has traveled back and forth
across California the past two
years for an endless series of
buffet lunches, interviews,
service club dinners, recep
tions and candidate forums.
The 44-year-old mayor of San
Diego says he has campaigned
longer and made more
speeches than the other three
candidates for the Republican
nomination for governor all
combined.
But despite the tens of
thousands of miles of travel
and hundreds of appearances,
Wilson still is fourth in the
voter preference polls, one
rung lower than when he
started.
An attorney and former state
assemblyman, Wilson says the
issue in the GOP primary
should be the record of each of
the candidates, and who has
the best chance of defeating
Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown.
And as N mayor the past six
years of California's second
largest city, he says he has the
best qualifications of the Re
publican contenders to be
governor.
Soft-spoken
Wilson labels himself as "a
good manager" who practices
"positive conservatism."
It's not a message that brings
audiences to their feet cheer
ing. But that wouldn't be Wil
son's style. He is low-keyed,
soft-spoken. He talks about
complex issues, only occa
sionally lapsing into slogans.
Wilson avoids the provoca
tive, controversial comments
of rival GOP candidate Ed
Davis. He says
he believes Republicans will
take a cold hard look at their
candidates and pick him on the
basis of his record in office.

The message seldom
changes:
"I am the only one who has
had to set a tax rate, the only
one who has been engaged in
stimulating economic de
velopment, the only one who
has reduced the ratio of per
manent employees to popula
tion, the only one who has said
to public employees union
leaders threatening an illegal
strike that if they walked off
their jobs we would fire them
and hire replacements the next
morning," Wilson says.
"The result is we have had a
couple of strike threats and no
strikes. That's good manage
ment. I think it's also leader
ship. We've had very little of
either in Sacramento the last
three years.
"It's one thing to talk about
what you would do if elected.
It's another to have done it."
Small crowds
On the campaign, he is wil
ling to listen at length to ques
tions from voters, and he ap
pears unconcerned at the gen
erally small crowds or that fact
that many voters still don't rec
ognize his face or name.
At the state university cam
pus at Chico recently, Wilson
spent 2% hours mingling with
voters at a weekend carnival.
He spoke with only about 30
voters among the 1000 at the
carnival, some for as long as 10
minutes each. He smiled
weakly when the only televi
sion reporter to interview him
that day garbled his name as
"Mayor Pete Davis."
Although Wilson still is not
well known outside of San
Diego, he says the polls don't
accurately reflect his standing
because most of them were
taken before he started his
television commercials.

Most observers see Wilson
competing with Assemblyman
Ken Maddy and Attorney Gen
eral Evellp Younger for the
votes of moderate Republi
cans, while Davis battles
for the conservative
vote.
Younger, the front-runner,
has slipped in the polls, while
Davis and Maddy have gained.
But Wilson has stayed about
even, favored by about one
sixth of the Republican voters.
Wilson has been labeled as a
liberal and an environmentalist
by his foes, but he disputes

those labels and says he stands
for balance and moderation.
One issue on which Wilson
does differ from his GOP rivals
is abortion. He is the only Re
publican contender who sup
ports state funding of abor
tions for women on Medi-Cal.
Agreement
But Wilson says he and his
GOP rivals agree on most is
sues. Therefore, he says, elec
tability in November rather
