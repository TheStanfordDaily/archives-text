# Russian portraits hang in Basily room
## 
### Andrea James 
Unknown to many University stu
dents, several original 18th century
Russian portraits hang in the Nicolas de
Basily Room, a remote corner of
Hoover Institution.
About 50 Russian, English and French
works of art adorn the pale green walls
of the Basily Room, named in honor of a
late imperial Russian diplomat. The
room was created by Basily's wife, who
also donated to the Institution her hus
band's personal papers and library col
lection.
According to George Marotta, public
relations coordinator at Hoover, Basily
helped the last Russian imperialist Czar
Nicholas II draw up his resignation.
These drafts are included in the papers

now stored in Hoover.
Prominent on the Basily Room walls
are the numerous portraits of royal
Romanov family members. Representa
tives from four generations of the
Romanov line stare penetratingly at
Basily Room visitors. Perhaps the most
intimidating of these royal portraits is
that of the plump and aging Catherine
the Great, done by Italian court painter
Lampi the Elder.
Not all the Basily Room portraits are
of Russian imperialists, however. One
English portrait by John Hoppner is of
Jenny Duncan, daughter of a promi
nent 18th century British admiral. A
gouache by a French artist and good
friend of Basily, Alexander Benout, is
also located in the room. This art piece,

painted with opaque colors, water,
honey and gum, depicts the Winter
Palace.
Two large landscapes by the French
painter ]oseph Vernet add a touch of
Italy to the predominantly Russian
room. These landscapes show the area
around Naples and were found in the
St. Petersburg Palace of Gatchina.
Along with the art treasures in the
room are several Russian medals and
plaques awarded to Basily and photo
graphs of Basily, his wife and Russian
royalty.
The Basily Room is used on special
occasions as a conference room. For
example, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn
spoke from this room when he did re
search at Hoover two years ago.
