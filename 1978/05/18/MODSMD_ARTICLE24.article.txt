## masscult/mark van oss Borge: music and humor 
### 
Victor Borge is back in San
Francisco, this time with his
marvelously entertaining
show, "Comedy With Music,."
Once again Borge establishes
his standing as one of the fun
niest men around. Not only
that, but his musical talent at
the piano is almost as unbeata
ble.
Straight from a smashing
"held-over" run on Broadway
this production is a light and
airy evening of music and
humor. Borge is as enter
taining as ever; heisas funny at
the piano — "Now, where the
hell is C" — as he is away from
it — "My grandfather gave me
this watch just before he died
. . . for twenty bucks."
Borge plays the first act
alone. His monologue begins
with the promise, "Hello, we
have an intermission coming
up soon" and covers every
thing from "that great Danish
composer, Hans Christian
Mozart" to children: "There
are children in the audience?
That means I can't play the sec
ond act in the nude! Oh well,

I'll wear the tie . . . yes, the
long one."
As entertaining as his pre
pared material is his constant
ad-lib conversation with the
audience. Borge, at one point,
asked one woman to "kindly
laugh with the rest of the audi
ence. Otherwise we will never
get out of here." At another
point he asked a woman whose
laughter did cackle a bit
whether or not she were laying
eggs. Borge's success as a per
former stems greatly from the
relationship he develops with
his audience. To form any feel
ing of intimacy in the dark re
cesses of the Curran Theatre is,
indeed, an achievement.
The comedian is aided in the
second act by a lovely soprano,
Marylyn Mulvey. This gifted
singer from the Metropolitan
Opera proves to be a splendid
foil to the show's star. While
singing a gorgeous aria from
the opera, "Rigoletto," Miss
Mulvey is accompanied by
Borge, at the piano. Borge
cheers her on with comments
like, "Oh, shut up!"and "Keep

your hands off my piano."
It is very easy to become
caught up with Borge's comic
ability and lose sight of the fact
that he is an accomplished
musician. Borge brilliantly
combines his humor with his
music; indeed, they are almost
inseparable. At one point he
asks the audience if they would
like to hear some good music.
In response to the applause he
says, "Too bad."
Because he does combine so
many forms of music and
humor, Borge can become a
little tiring. His performance
will appeal to tastes at different
times, but there is something
there — from "Riogoletto" to
"Chopsticks" — for everyone.
In closing this enjoyable
evening, Borge states that "the
shortest distance between
people is a smile — the bigger
the smile, the shorter the dis
tance."
"Comedy With Music" plays
through May 21 at the Curran
Theatre.
