## 
### Sara Lessley 
The ASSU Senate may not exist
next year.
Members of the Committee to Re
tire Aspiring Politicos (CRAP) have
coiieeied the necessary 600 signa
tures to place a constitutional
amendment on the next ballot which
would eliminate the senate.
The proposed amendment would
change Article II of the ASSU Con
stitution. This article authorizes the
senate.
If approved, the amendment would
effectively transfer all of the senate's
powers to the Council of Presidents,
essentially eliminating the senate.
Former Elections Commissioner
Sean Murphy announced at last
week's senate meeting that enough
signatures had been collected and
certified, and that the measure
would appear on the autumn ballot.
Two-thirds of those voting in the

election would have to vote yes to
pass the amendment. Pending Board
of Trustees' approval, the measure
would become part of the ASSU
Constitution.
Reactions to the proposed
amendment have been varied. CRAP
member Doug Bandow said "he
didn't know how the administration
would react" if the proposed
amendment passed.
Bandow said administrators prob
ably would not approve of the move
in the "abstract." However, if two
thirds of those voting approved the
move, administration reaction might
be "different," he added.
Bandow said if the amendment
passed, it would be "silly" if Lyman
did not approve the action.
Voters will also vote for candidates
running for ASSU Senate on the au
tumn ballot.
