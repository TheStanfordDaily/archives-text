## A
						Mabuhay punker spills his wisdom 
### 
It's only 10 feet between the
first row of chairs and the two
foot high stage. But she takes
an eternity to traverse the dis
tance, her glazed eyes fixed
like beaming devices some
where around the base of the
microphone stand. Slowly,
laboriously, Little Miss
Quaalude weaves her way for
ward, balancing on her out
\ stretched right hand a small
basket filled with popcorn.
She eventually does reach
the stage, no mean feat since
her brain has apparently res
igned all control of motor
capacities. She pauses for a
moment to ascertain that she is
still standing, then slowly
cocks her throwing arm and
lets fly with her ammo. The
ammo, instead of pelting the
lead singer in the face, dribbles
pathetically around his feet. He
keeps jumping and singing.
She collapses in a heap in front
of the stage.
Oddly enough
Oddly enough, this girl's
gesture is a heartfelt — if
booze-and-drug fueled — dis
play of approval and affection
for the performers. This is no
standard rock concert. No, no,
no. It's Tuesday night at the
Mabuhay Gardens, 443 Broad
way, San Francisco's leading
(and only) punk rock/newwave
venue.
Three bands share the bill
tonight; two are experienced,
local talent and have played
this club before. The opening
act, however, has never done a
show at the Mabuhay. Except
for one small party, the band
has never even performed in
front of an audience. As a mat
ter of fact, it has only existed
two and a half months, as long
as the bassist has been "study
ing" his instrument.
Raw Meat
The band can be considered
un/que solely in terms of its
membership: the musicians,
manager and "road crew" are
Stanford students. They are
Phil Otto (vocals), Tim Clark
(guitar), Dave Latchaw

.. .Latchaw ticks a reggae rhythm, and looks like
the deranged grandfather your family never
talked about. Missed cues . . . out-of-tune
guitars . . . heat . . . lights.

(drums), Jimmy Jett (bass), Rich
Johnson (manager), and Dean
Thomas (sound). I also play
guitar in the band. We are cal
led Raw Meat. We play original
material, and we are not
punks.
The two-year-old punk rock
movement originated in Eng
land as a backlash against the
ultra-clean, supermarket
quality, middle-of-the road,
baby food heard these days on
"progressive" FM radio sta
tions (once bastions of "free
programming" and anti-Top 40
ideals).
Highly publicized in this
country during the 1977 Ameri
can tour of the Sex Pistols, Eng
land's best known punk band,
punk rock and its Thalidomide
offspring, New Wave and
"power pop," have since been
denounced by critics as a
media fad, a trend which
couldn't last.
Barry Manilow
The sound is a far cry from
the sterile Fleetwood Mac/
Boston/Kansas/ABBA/Foreigner/
Barry Manilow lightweight
schlock of the '70s. Influenced
by "punks" like the early Rol
ling Stones, Who, Kinks and

Velvet Underground, the sim
ple, guitar-based music is al
most frightening in its inten
sity. It's rough, raw, loud, vici
ous and decidedly non
commercial. Listening to New
Wave is like having a nose job
done with a jackhammer dur
ing an earthquake in a vat of
boiling tar and pig intestines: it
has a subtlety quotient of zero.
The major outlets for New
Wave bands are small clubs (as
opposed to the intimate
100,000 person concerts of to
day's rock "megastars"), the
leading two of which in the
U.S. are CBCB's in New York,
and San Francisco's Mabuhay
Gardens.
Spray paint
Having done a sound check
this afternoon (to set up
equipment and insure that all
sound levels are properly ba
lanced), we await our 11 p.m.
starting time. At 10:30 we re
pair to the "dressing room" —
a 716 yd. x IV2 yd. disaster area
sporting the latest in "spray
paint chic" — to tune guitars
and don stage garb.
The Mabuhay is one block
east of Broadway's real
primordial sleeze: Carol Do
da's, topless/bottomless joints,
nude wrestling parlors,
hustlers, hookers — and
one-hand-gal I op-book
bookstores. The marquee in
nocently boasts a "piano bar,"

. . . not your standard evening. No, no, no. It's
Tuesday night at 443 Broadway, the city's leading,
(only) punk/wave venue.

"Filipino cooking" and —
strangely —'"family entertain
ment."
Tahitian
Inside chandeliers that look
like bunches of communion
wafers strung together cast in
appropriately dim glow over
the stage, the dance floor and
three rows of wooden chairs
and tables in front. A second
level, raised about three feet,
houses more chairs and elon-

gated picnic-style tables. An
enormous, decrepit canvas
backdrop frames the stage,
and on one wall a lake/
volcano/palm tree mural of
Tahitian tranquility is an ano
maly in the otherwise seedy
atmosphere. Capacity is about
250, and anyone over 18 is wel
come: refreshments include a
fully stocked bar and free pop
corn.
Stage left
Eleven o'clock. Standing
stage left. The lights dim. Dirk
Dirksen, goateed owner of the
"Fab Mab," babbles an intro
duction; all I hear is . . Raw
Meat —" We saunter onstage
to a hefty cheer, the lion's
share of which apparently
comes from our "rooting sec
tion" (because bands are paid a
percentage of the door — and
are guaranteed return en
gagements on the basis of their
draw, it is not unusual for a
group to "stack" the audience
with friends, parents, lovers,
winos and any other fools they
can coax to shell out the $3
cover charge.
We're on. Plug in. Slow
drum count for "White Al
ligators," the set opener. Then

BOOM! — ZAP! — SLASH!! —
a veritable phantasmorgasm of
light, noise, sound and fury.
And we're off and running.
Weird things begin to hap
pen. Ash trays fly up on stage.
Popcorn too. Apparently all
part of the game: the more
they throw, the better you are.
45 minutes
It's a very short 45 minutes.
Only flashes remain: Jimmy,
legs bent and mouth open,
prowls the stage, plugging
musical holes with cannon-like
bass plucks ... a roadie stage
left tosses a glass of beer at me
. . . Tim chonks away at his
guitar, sweat flying as if from a
law sprinkler... we sit during
"Crazy Jenny," the slow one,
the guitars wrapping majorand
minor chords around Phi'l's st
raining, aching lyric . . .
Latchaw ticks a BOMP
CHUKKA-OOMPH-BOMP re
ggae rhythm for "Planned Ob
solescence," looking like the
deranged grandfather your
family never talked about . . .
missed cues... out-of-tune
guitars. . . weakening legs . . .
heat . . . lights.
BASH! We're done; we're off
. . . That's it. One minute total
chaos, the next, relative si
lence. It was that short.
U-haul
We made enough money to
cover both the rental fee for
the U-Haul trailer, in which

we'd trundled our equipment
to the city, and back, and the
tape used to record the show.
In this case, however, monet
ary gain is incidental.
