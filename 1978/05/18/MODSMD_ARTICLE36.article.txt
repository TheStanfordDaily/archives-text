Dominican army halts vote count
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic — Dominican
armed forces stopped tabulation of presidential election
results yesterday, at least temporarily, after the opposi
tion opened a wide lead. The military denied it had
seized the government.
Reports received in Washington said the vote count
had resumed in this central Caribbean nation, which
shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, and that the
action to suspend it was taken by national police.
This capital appeared calm yesterday afternoon, with
no sign of the troops and police who took to the streets
before dawn, sparking rumors of a coup.
Earlier reports said armed forces invaded the head
quarters of the Central Electoral Board at4a.m., stopped
the vote count and the broadcasting of results. The in
tervention came as challenger Antonio Guzman took a
big lead over incumbent President Joaquin Balaguer.
House approves reduced budget
Washington — A federal budget that makes room for a
tax cut of $19.4 billion next year and reduces spending
slightly below earlier plans was narrowly approved by
the House yesterday.
The House adopted the compromise budget, 201 to
198, after the Senate accepted it Monday by voice vote.
This completes action on a tentative budget resolution,
not requiring the president's signature.
This target budget for fiscal 1979, the federal book
keeping year starting Oct. 1,1978, calls for $498.8 billion
in spending and $447.9 billion in revenues, resulting in a
$50.9 billion deficit.
The budget resolution will serve as a guide while the
lawmakers consider actual spending and taxing bills. A
second resolution in September will set mandatory
limits.
President Jimmy Carter, who originally proposed a $25
billion tax cut, bowed to increasing concern about infla
tion and congressional insistence in accepting the $19.4
billion total tax reduction.
Brown pledges no tax raise
Sacramento — If voters approve Proposition 13, Gov.
Jerry Brown said yesterday he will cut government ser
vices and lay off workers rather than raise taxes.
"I'm not going to raise state taxes. I ran on a pledge
not to raise state taxes, and I'm not going to do it,"
Brown told a group of officials from fire departments
throughout California.
"Now, if the whole sky falls in, maybe in 1979, if I'm
still around, we can look at a tax increase. But I just
cannot see taxes going up at the state level," Brown
added.
Proposition 13, the property tax cut initiative by How
ard Jarvis, would cut property taxes an average of 57 per
cent and reduce funds for schools, cities, counties and
local districts by $7 billion annually.
Social Security tax cut defeated
Washington — The House Ways and Means Commit
tee reversed itself yesterday and stifled an election-year
effort to roll back Social Security taxes for 106 million
workers and their employers.
"I have decided that I cannot live with a vote" to undo
the tax increases enacted last December, said Rep. Al
Ullman (D-Ore.), chairman. His position, and the com
mittee's turn-about, defies a mandate from the House
Democratic Caucus, which last month instructed the
panel to write a tax-cut bill.
Ullman had cast the tie-breaker last week when the
committee voted 19-18 for a rollback. He and four other
members switched their positions yesterday, resulting
in a 21-16 vote against a reduction.
Ullman said that vote probably settled the question for
the year. That would mean higher Social Security taxes
starting next Jan. 1.

Report reveals Hayakawa's wealth
Washington — Sen. S.I. Hayakawa disclosed yesterday
that he personally controlled assets between $515,000
and $1.25 million — with most of it in real estate — and
that he and his wife have a net worth between $1 million
and $2.5 million.
The California senator said his wife had assets of bet
ween $970,000 and $2,025,000, with most of it in stocks.
He listed another $100,000 to $250,000 in a trust fund
set up for one dependent son and administered by his
wife.
The combined assets of the family, which total bet
ween $1,585,000 and $.3,490,000, show Hayakawa to be
among the richest of the dozen or so senators who have
so far disclosed their financial statements.
However, several of those senators generally thought
to be the richest have not yet released their statements,
which they were required to file by May 15. Those re
ports are expected to be released by May 30.
Chaplin's body found; two arrested
Lausanne, Switzerland — The body of Charlie Chaplin,
stolen from its grave 76 days ago in a macabre theft that
seemed to have stumped international investigators,
was found yesterday in a shallow hole in a cornfield near
Lake Geneva and the two alleged grave robbers were
arrested.
Authorities said they picked up the pair — a Pole and a
Bulgarian — after they allegedly called the Chaplin fam
ily lawyer demanding a ransom for the return of the
remains of the famed comedian.
Examining Magistrate Jean-Daniel Tenthorey said the
call was traced, the two men were tracked down Tuesday
and the body, still in its oak coffin, was found early
yesterday near Villeneuve, a small town at the eastern tip
of Lake Geneva.
L.A. Olympic bid up for vote
Athens, Greece — A Los Angeles delegation survived a
two-hour grilling by the International Olympic Commit
tee yesterday and prepared to insure against financial
loss in staging the 1984 Olympic Games.
The lOC votes on Los Angeles' troubled, all-alone bid
today. But Mayor Tom Bradley and John Argue, chair
man of the delegation, were confident their city will get
the Games.
"The agreement solves the problem with insurance,"
Argue said. "The insurance will adequately protect the
lOC and the U.S. Olympic Committee. In the past they
have looked to the city for a guarantee. This time they
are looking to insurance."
There was no official word from the lOC that it was
ready to rewrite its draft contract, which for weeks Los
Angeles has been refusing to sign.

ween $970,000 and $2,025,000, with most of it in stocks.
He listed another $100,000 to $250,000 in a trust fund
set up for one dependent son and administered by his
wife.
The combined assets of the family, which total bet
ween $1,585,000 and $.3,490,000, show Hayakawa to be
among the richest of the dozen or so senators who have
so far disclosed their financial statements.
However, several of those senators generally thought
to be the richest have not yet released their statements,
which they were required to file by May 15. Those re
ports are expected to be released by May 30.
Chaplin's body found; two arrested
Lausanne, Switzerland — The body of Charlie Chaplin,
stolen from its grave 76 days ago in a macabre theft that
seemed to have stumped international investigators,
was found yesterday in a shallow hole in a cornfield near
Lake Geneva and the two alleged grave robbers were
arrested.
Authorities said they picked up the pair — a Pole and a
Bulgarian — after they allegedly called the Chaplin fam
ily lawyer demanding a ransom for the return of the
remains of the famed comedian.
Examining Magistrate Jean-Daniel Tenthorey said the
call was traced, the two men were tracked down Tuesday
and the body, still in its oak coffin, was found early
yesterday near Villeneuve, a small town at the eastern tip
of Lake Geneva.
L.A. Olympic bid up for vote
Athens, Greece — A Los Angeles delegation survived a
two-hour grilling by the International Olympic Commit
tee yesterday and prepared to insure against financial
loss in staging the 1984 Olympic Games.
The lOC votes on Los Angeles' troubled, all-alone bid
today. But Mayor Tom Bradley and John Argue, chair
man of the delegation, were confident their city will get
the Games.
"The agreement solves the problem with insurance,"
Argue said. "The insurance will adequately protect the
lOC and the U.S. Olympic Committee. In the past they
have looked to the city for a guarantee. This time they
are looking to insurance."
There was no official word from the lOC that it was
ready to rewrite its draft contract, which for weeks Los
Angeles has been refusing to sign.

Spring activity boosts Dow Jones
New York — The stock market overcame spells of
selling at the opening and near the close to record its
sixth straight gain in another extremely active session
yesterday.
Analysts said recent signs that the economy was mov
ing ahead at a healthy pace had helped reinforce this
spring's outburst of enthusiasm for stocks.
The Dow |ones average of 30 industrials rose 4.07 to
858.37, establishing an eight-month high for the second
successive day. Over the past six sessions the average
has climbed 36.30 points.

Dominican army halts vote count
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic — Dominican
armed forces stopped tabulation of presidential election
results yesterday, at least temporarily, after the opposi
tion opened a wide lead. The military denied it had
seized the government.
Reports received in Washington said the vote count
had resumed in this central Caribbean nation, which
shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, and that the
action to suspend it was taken by national police.
This capital appeared calm yesterday afternoon, with
no sign of the troops and police who took to the streets
before dawn, sparking rumors of a coup.
Earlier reports said armed forces invaded the head
quarters of the Central Electoral Board at4a.m., stopped
the vote count and the broadcasting of results. The in
tervention came as challenger Antonio Guzman took a
big lead over incumbent President Joaquin Balaguer.
House approves reduced budget
Washington — A federal budget that makes room for a
tax cut of $19.4 billion next year and reduces spending
slightly below earlier plans was narrowly approved by
the House yesterday.
The House adopted the compromise budget, 201 to
198, after the Senate accepted it Monday by voice vote.
This completes action on a tentative budget resolution,
not requiring the president's signature.
This target budget for fiscal 1979, the federal book
keeping year starting Oct. 1,1978, calls for $498.8 billion
in spending and $447.9 billion in revenues, resulting in a
$50.9 billion deficit.
The budget resolution will serve as a guide while the
lawmakers consider actual spending and taxing bills. A
second resolution in September will set mandatory
limits.
President Jimmy Carter, who originally proposed a $25
billion tax cut, bowed to increasing concern about infla
tion and congressional insistence in accepting the $19.4
billion total tax reduction.
Brown pledges no tax raise
Sacramento — If voters approve Proposition 13, Gov.
Jerry Brown said yesterday he will cut government ser
vices and lay off workers rather than raise taxes.
"I'm not going to raise state taxes. I ran on a pledge
not to raise state taxes, and I'm not going to do it,"
Brown told a group of officials from fire departments
throughout California.
"Now, if the whole sky falls in, maybe in 1979, if I'm
still around, we can look at a tax increase. But I just
cannot see taxes going up at the state level," Brown
added.
Proposition 13, the property tax cut initiative by How
ard Jarvis, would cut property taxes an average of 57 per
cent and reduce funds for schools, cities, counties and
local districts by $7 billion annually.
Social Security tax cut defeated
Washington — The House Ways and Means Commit
tee reversed itself yesterday and stifled an election-year
effort to roll back Social Security taxes for 106 million
workers and their employers.
"I have decided that I cannot live with a vote" to undo
the tax increases enacted last December, said Rep. Al
Ullman (D-Ore.), chairman. His position, and the com
mittee's turn-about, defies a mandate from the House
Democratic Caucus, which last month instructed the
panel to write a tax-cut bill.
Ullman had cast the tie-breaker last week when the
committee voted 19-18 for a rollback. He and four other
members switched their positions yesterday, resulting
in a 21-16 vote against a reduction.
Ullman said that vote probably settled the question for
the year. That would mean higher Social Security taxes
starting next Jan. 1.

Report reveals Hayakawa's wealth
Washington — Sen. S.I. Hayakawa disclosed yesterday
that he personally controlled assets between $515,000
and $1.25 million — with most of it in real estate — and
that he and his wife have a net worth between $1 million
and $2.5 million.
The California senator said his wife had assets of bet
ween $970,000 and $2,025,000, with most of it in stocks.

House approves reduced budget
Washington — A federal budget that makes room for a
tax cut of $19.4 billion next year and reduces spending
slightly below earlier plans was narrowly approved by
the House yesterday.
The House adopted the compromise budget, 201 to
198, after the Senate accepted it Monday by voice vote.
This completes action on a tentative budget resolution,
not requiring the president's signature.
This target budget for fiscal 1979, the federal book
keeping year starting Oct. 1,1978, calls for $498.8 billion
in spending and $447.9 billion in revenues, resulting in a
$50.9 billion deficit.
The budget resolution will serve as a guide while the
lawmakers consider actual spending and taxing bills. A
second resolution in September will set mandatory
limits.
President Jimmy Carter, who originally proposed a $25
billion tax cut, bowed to increasing concern about infla
tion and congressional insistence in accepting the $19.4
billion total tax reduction.
Brown pledges no tax raise
Sacramento — If voters approve Proposition 13, Gov.
Jerry Brown said yesterday he will cut government ser
vices and lay off workers rather than raise taxes.
"I'm not going to raise state taxes. I ran on a pledge
not to raise state taxes, and I'm not going to do it,"
Brown told a group of officials from fire departments
throughout California.
"Now, if the whole sky falls in, maybe in 1979, if I'm
still around, we can look at a tax increase. But I just
cannot see taxes going up at the state level," Brown
added.
Proposition 13, the property tax cut initiative by How
ard Jarvis, would cut property taxes an average of 57 per
cent and reduce funds for schools, cities, counties and
local districts by $7 billion annually.
Social Security tax cut defeated
Washington — The House Ways and Means Commit
tee reversed itself yesterday and stifled an election-year
effort to roll back Social Security taxes for 106 million
workers and their employers.
"I have decided that I cannot live with a vote" to undo
the tax increases enacted last December, said Rep. Al
Ullman (D-Ore.), chairman. His position, and the com
mittee's turn-about, defies a mandate from the House
Democratic Caucus, which last month instructed the
panel to write a tax-cut bill.
Ullman had cast the tie-breaker last week when the
committee voted 19-18 for a rollback. He and four other
members switched their positions yesterday, resulting
in a 21-16 vote against a reduction.
Ullman said that vote probably settled the question for
the year. That would mean higher Social Security taxes
starting next Jan. 1.

Report reveals Hayakawa's wealth
Washington — Sen. S.I. Hayakawa disclosed yesterday
that he personally controlled assets between $515,000
and $1.25 million — with most of it in real estate — and
that he and his wife have a net worth between $1 million
and $2.5 million.
The California senator said his wife had assets of bet
ween $970,000 and $2,025,000, with most of it in stocks.
He listed another $100,000 to $250,000 in a trust fund
set up for one dependent son and administered by his
wife.
The combined assets of the family, which total bet
ween $1,585,000 and $.3,490,000, show Hayakawa to be
among the richest of the dozen or so senators who have
so far disclosed their financial statements.
However, several of those senators generally thought
to be the richest have not yet released their statements,
which they were required to file by May 15. Those re
ports are expected to be released by May 30.
Chaplin's body found; two arrested
Lausanne, Switzerland — The body of Charlie Chaplin,
stolen from its grave 76 days ago in a macabre theft that
seemed to have stumped international investigators,
was found yesterday in a shallow hole in a cornfield near
Lake Geneva and the two alleged grave robbers were
arrested.
Authorities said they picked up the pair — a Pole and a
Bulgarian — after they allegedly called the Chaplin fam
ily lawyer demanding a ransom for the return of the
remains of the famed comedian.
Examining Magistrate Jean-Daniel Tenthorey said the
call was traced, the two men were tracked down Tuesday
and the body, still in its oak coffin, was found early
yesterday near Villeneuve, a small town at the eastern tip
of Lake Geneva.
L.A. Olympic bid up for vote
Athens, Greece — A Los Angeles delegation survived a
two-hour grilling by the International Olympic Commit
tee yesterday and prepared to insure against financial
loss in staging the 1984 Olympic Games.
The lOC votes on Los Angeles' troubled, all-alone bid
today. But Mayor Tom Bradley and John Argue, chair
man of the delegation, were confident their city will get
the Games.
"The agreement solves the problem with insurance,"
Argue said. "The insurance will adequately protect the
lOC and the U.S. Olympic Committee. In the past they
have looked to the city for a guarantee. This time they
are looking to insurance."
There was no official word from the lOC that it was
ready to rewrite its draft contract, which for weeks Los
Angeles has been refusing to sign.
