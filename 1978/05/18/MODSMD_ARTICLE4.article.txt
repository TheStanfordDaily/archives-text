# Zaire rebels gain ground; many Americans rescued
## 
### 
Kinshasa, Zaire (AP) — Rebel
tribesmen were reported gaining
ground yesterday in southern Zaire,
stranding 2500 foreigners behind
their lines, but American officials
said a surprise ground-and-air rescue
mission mounted by a U.S. firm
managed to evacuate most Ameri
cans from the embattled area.
In this capital city, more than
100,000 dancing and chanting Zai
reans rallied in a stadium in support
of President Mobutu Sese Seko's
pro-West government and to de
nounce alleged Cuban and Soviet
support for the rebels.
The central government and rebel
invaders accused each other of mur
dering whites in the war zone.
"Foreigners are being hunted in
Kolwezi," Foreign Minister Henri
Simonet told the Belgian Parliament
in Brussels. He said this was the last
message Belgian officials received
from the rebel-held town in this
central African nation's southeastern
copper belt.
Belgian Foreign Ministry spokes
man Alfred Cahen described the 2000
Belgians, 400 French citizens and as
sorted other foreigners in the Kol
wezi area as hostages of the rebels.
The Kinshasa government drop
ped several hundred paratroopers
around Kolwezi earlier this week to
join ground forces in a drive against
the rebels. The Zairean news agency
AZAP said the paratroopers recap
tured the Kolwezi airport yesterday

after three hours of heavy fighting.
There has been no word on milit
ary casualties.
Various reports from diplomats
here and from Belgian sources said
between five and nine Europeans
have been killed in the Kolwezi area
— apparently all Belgians, except for
one Italian.
In a statement issued in Brussels,
the rebel Congolese National I ibera
tion Front denied its forces had killed
foreigners in the five-day-old inva
sion, said they were protecting civi
lians and blamed any civilian deaths
on "barbaric" government forces.
Meanwhile, State Department of-,
ficials said late yesterday that the Un
ited States was considering requests
from Belgium for logistical support in
Shaba.
The official refused to disclose
what type of operation the Belgians
were planning or whether it was in
tended to rescue Belgian and French
citizens in Shaba.
A senior Defense Department offi
cial, who did not wish to be iden
tified, said the United States "might
be willing" to helpwith an airlift. The
State Department official said there
was no question of sending U.S.
troops into the area.
The American rescue operation
was mounted by the construction
firm Morrison-Knudson of Boise,
Idaho, which is building a power pro
ject near Kolwezi and employs most
of the Americans in the area.

Without encountering fire, the
convoy of trucks and helicopters
reached a compound eight miles
from the rebel-held town of Kolwezi
yesterday morning, State Depart
ment spokesman Hodding Carter
said in Washington. He said the con
voy took 65 Morrison-Knudson
employees and dependents out by
truck and rescued another 12 by
helicopter.
Left behind were 11 Americans
caught in the midst of renewed fight
ing in which some4ooo exiled Lunda
tribesmen from Angola crossed
northern Zambia and seized Kol
weiz, 25 miles from the Zambian
border.
Nonetheless, Defense Depart
ment sources here said it was "highly
unlikely" that Army paratroopers,
still on alert yesterday, would be sent
to Africa. A Pentagon source said
"the situation seems to be sorting
itself out."
But a senior defense official said
later that approximately 1500 parat
roopers will remain on alert "be
cause we are not sure a rescue mis
sion will not be needed."
Meanwhile, legislation was intro
duced to ease congressional re
straints on President limmy Carter's
authority to ship arms and equip
ment to Zaire without prior approval
from Capitol Hill.
Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) submit
ted a bill that would repeal a section
of the Security Assistance Act pro
hibiting the shipment of military aid
to Zaire unless the president de
clares that such assistance "should
be furnished in the national security
interests of the United States."
Dole also introduced a bill that
would modify the so-called Clark
Amendment which prohibits U.S.

shipments of military equipment or
aid to Angola. Dole said his modifica
tion "would make it absolutely clear"
that the Clark Amendment in no way
restricts U.S. assistance to neighbor
ing Zaire.
However, Sen. Dick Clark (D
-lowa), for whom the amendment is
named, said it applies only to Angola.
"I find it difficult to believe they want
to go back into Angola," he said.

from Capitol Hill.
Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) submit
ted a bill that would repeal a section
of the Security Assistance Act pro
hibiting the shipment of military aid
to Zaire unless the president de
clares that such assistance "should
be furnished in the national security
interests of the United States."
Dole also introduced a bill that
would modify the so-called Clark
Amendment which prohibits U.S.

shipments of military equipment or
aid to Angola. Dole said his modifica
tion "would make it absolutely clear"
that the Clark Amendment in no way
restricts U.S. assistance to neighbor
ing Zaire.
However, Sen. Dick Clark (D
-lowa), for whom the amendment is
named, said it applies only to Angola.
"I find it difficult to believe they want
to go back into Angola," he said.
Kinshasa, Zaire (AP) — Rebel
tribesmen were reported gaining
ground yesterday in southern Zaire,
stranding 2500 foreigners behind
their lines, but American officials
said a surprise ground-and-air rescue
mission mounted by a U.S. firm
managed to evacuate most Ameri
cans from the embattled area.
In this capital city, more than
100,000 dancing and chanting Zai
reans rallied in a stadium in support
of President Mobutu Sese Seko's
pro-West government and to de
nounce alleged Cuban and Soviet
support for the rebels.
The central government and rebel
invaders accused each other of mur
dering whites in the war zone.
"Foreigners are being hunted in
Kolwezi," Foreign Minister Henri
Simonet told the Belgian Parliament
in Brussels. He said this was the last
message Belgian officials received
from the rebel-held town in this
central African nation's southeastern
copper belt.
Belgian Foreign Ministry spokes
man Alfred Cahen described the 2000
Belgians, 400 French citizens and as
sorted other foreigners in the Kol
wezi area as hostages of the rebels.
The Kinshasa government drop
ped several hundred paratroopers
around Kolwezi earlier this week to
join ground forces in a drive against
the rebels. The Zairean news agency
AZAP said the paratroopers recap
tured the Kolwezi airport yesterday

after three hours of heavy fighting.
There has been no word on milit
ary casualties.
Various reports from diplomats
here and from Belgian sources said
between five and nine Europeans
have been killed in the Kolwezi area
— apparently all Belgians, except for
one Italian.
In a statement issued in Brussels,
the rebel Congolese National I ibera
tion Front denied its forces had killed
foreigners in the five-day-old inva
sion, said they were protecting civi
lians and blamed any civilian deaths
on "barbaric" government forces.
Meanwhile, State Department of-,
ficials said late yesterday that the Un
ited States was considering requests
from Belgium for logistical support in
Shaba.
The official refused to disclose
what type of operation the Belgians
were planning or whether it was in
tended to rescue Belgian and French
citizens in Shaba.
A senior Defense Department offi
cial, who did not wish to be iden
tified, said the United States "might
be willing" to helpwith an airlift. The
State Department official said there
was no question of sending U.S.
troops into the area.
The American rescue operation
was mounted by the construction
firm Morrison-Knudson of Boise,
Idaho, which is building a power pro
ject near Kolwezi and employs most
of the Americans in the area.

Without encountering fire, the
convoy of trucks and helicopters
reached a compound eight miles
from the rebel-held town of Kolwezi
yesterday morning, State Depart
ment spokesman Hodding Carter
said in Washington. He said the con
voy took 65 Morrison-Knudson
employees and dependents out by
truck and rescued another 12 by
helicopter.
Left behind were 11 Americans
caught in the midst of renewed fight
ing in which some4ooo exiled Lunda
tribesmen from Angola crossed
northern Zambia and seized Kol
weiz, 25 miles from the Zambian
border.
Nonetheless, Defense Depart
ment sources here said it was "highly
unlikely" that Army paratroopers,
still on alert yesterday, would be sent
to Africa. A Pentagon source said
"the situation seems to be sorting
itself out."
But a senior defense official said
later that approximately 1500 parat
roopers will remain on alert "be
cause we are not sure a rescue mis
sion will not be needed."
Meanwhile, legislation was intro
duced to ease congressional re
straints on President limmy Carter's
authority to ship arms and equip
ment to Zaire without prior approval
from Capitol Hill.
