Album giveaways and competi
tions between Bay Area radio station
representatives will be part of KZSU's
celebration today in White Plaza
commemorating its power increase
to 500 watts.
According to Laurie Newton,
promotions director, KZSU will
sponsor recreational sports and
album giveaways from noon to 1
p.m. today.
"We're going to give away 90.1 al
bums," she said, "90 albums and one
single by John Vomit and the Leather
Scabs."
Representatives from KSJO,
KAML, KOME and KSAN will attend
the event.
KZSU has been trying to get the
power increase for the last several
years, according to Jon Morris, sta

tion manager. Today's events celeb
rate the official increase of power
from 10 to 500 watts.
Although KZSU had all the equip
ment necessary for the increase by
the early 19705, there were several
legal and engineering problems in
volved.
"We waived interference," Morris
explained. "But the FCC (Federal
Communications Commission) was
reluctant to set a precedence for our
doing this."
By waiving interference, KZSU
realized "there would be about five
square miles where there would be
interference," he said. "But most of
it is over uninhabited land. We really
didn't care."
KFJC, the radio station at Foothill
College which would be interfered
with, also agreed to the waiver, he ad
ded.
Morris said hiring a Washington
D.C. lawyer to work as a lobbyist was
what finally made the FCC decide to
grant the increase.
"We also hired an engineering
consulting firm to prepare the last
application," he said. KZSU spent
between $1500 and $2000 in legal and
consulting fees alone.
He had no figures on the total cost
of the increase.
"The cost was spread over several
years," Morris explained. "We

bought the transmitters and new an
tenna clear back in 1972 or 1973."
People from South San Francisco
to San lose can now hear KZSU. "I
heard we got a request from Gilroy,"
Morris said.
One KZSU staff member said that
before the increase, "Palo Alto could
get us on a good day."
Morris said there could be some
changes in program direction be
cause of the greater Bay Area audi
ence, but added that the increase
was made primarily so students living
off campus could tune in to KZSU.
"Our purpose is still to serve the
Stanford community," Morris said.
Since KZSU has moved from FCC's
Class D category to Class A, regula
tions require that periodic ascer
tainment studies be made.
"These studies ascertain both the
educational and commercial needs
of the community," Morris said. He
added University communication
classes will be compiling the first
study.
Another change KZSU will make
involves an "increased awareness"
of FCC regu'ations regarding "the
occasional gratuitous obscentiy,"
said one KZSU staff member.
"The University student wouldn't
mind the occasional obscenity, but
you never know about those little old
ladies in Hayward," he said.
