Prof. Hugo Aebi (above), president of the Swiss Science Council, was at the
Faculty Club yesterday to promote a new book, "Modern Switzerland,"
edited by Emeritus Chemistry Prof. |. Murray Luck. Luck had visited Swit
zerland in the early 1960s while he was science attache in the U.S. Embassy
in Bern and became interested in the country. Aebi was invited by the Swiss
government to come here and draw attention to the problems of science in
Switzerland, such as lack of research funding. Unlike many countries
Switzerland has more of a problem with an excess of well-trained
academics, rather than a shortage.
