More power to KZSU
Today marks a significant change for campus radio station
KZSU, which will now broadcast with 500 watts of power instead
of 10 watts. The Federal Communications Commission finally
approved KZSU's application for the increase last January, after
several years of review.
The increase in wattage will not only allow for clearer recep
tion of KZSU-FM on campus and in the Palo Alto area, but it will
also permit members of the Stanford community to receive
KZSU throughout most of the Peninsula and surrounding area,
from South San Francisco to San Jose.
KZSU's news, sports, and programming of campus affairs can
now be heard by community members either at their homes
on the Peninsula or as they commute to and from the campus.
We commend KZSU on several years of perseverance in bring
ing this better service to the community, and we look forward to
hearing KZSU around the Peninsula and even in some places
across the Bay. We hope you'll join us.
