Not enough housing
At a time when most of us are hav
ing our housing fates decided it
seems appropriate to make a few
comments about the housing situa
tion here.
Stanford offers a wide variety of
housing options for its students.
Aside from the traditional dorm life,
there are numerous theme houses
and cooperatives. For those who pre
fer apartment living there is Mir
rielees.
The problem then does not lie in a
lack of variety. Rather, the problem is
that there is not enough housing.
The University can only offer its stu
dents three guaranteed years. It con
structed the notorious Manzanita
park as a "temporary" solution to the
shortage. Many less endowed and
less expensive universities offer
housing that would seem like heaven
to most Stanford students.
Everywhere one turns one sees
construction: the new fountain, the
new library, the addition to the
Bookstore, the Psychology corner,
the Flistory corner, etc. Perhaps
there's more prestige to having a
fountain named after you than a
dorm.
Finally, the current system of al
locating housing is unfair. A
freshman can receive better housing
than a senior who spent his sopho
more year in Manzanita and his
junior year off campus.
The priority system is set up so that
those who are lucky enough to get
into one of the priority residences
one year will have a better chance of
getting good housing the next year
than someone who lived in Man
zanita. Doesn't lhat seem wrong?
Shouldn't someone else be given a
chance to live in a priority residence?
Although there are constant com
plaints and there are few other things
that play such a large role in the lives
of Stanford undergraduates little or
nothing is being done.

Lyman misquoted
In his generally excellent report of
the meeting between the CI Rand the
Trustees' Subcommittee on Invest
ment Responsibility (Daily, May
16th), Mike Charlson does attribute
one statement to me that I did not
make and with which I do not agree,
namely (in Mr. Charlson's parap
hrase) that "history shows that politi
cal change tends to occur during
periods of economic prosperity, not
during times of recession and de
pression which most people feel
would result from corporate with
drawal from South Africa."
The contrary example of the New
Deal in the United States, arising out
of the Depression of the 1930'5,

would seem sufficient by itself to cast
strong doubt on such a generaliza
tion, and it is by no means the only
such example that could be cited.
In relation to South Africa, there is
at least a considerable likelihood that
political reform in favor of the black
majority would become more likely
rather than less by further develop
ment of the still small numbers of
black South Africans who are edu
cated and involved in the modern
economy, rather than uneducated
and living in the "homelands."
That is quite a different question,
however, from any sweeping
generalizations cocncerning links,
positive or negative, among depi es
sion, prosperity, and political
change.

Relative anguish
In Friday's Daily we find three let
ters criticizing SCRIP, one from a
freshman disturbed that the placidity
of the fine spring weather at his
campus/country club home is being
disrupted, another, also from a
freshman, engaging in a-curious bit
of casuistry over the word "hypoc
risy," and a third, certainly the most
disturbing of the three, from Jean
Fetter, assistant to the president,
who has the nerve to equate the suf
fering of South Africans with the of
fense taken, presumably by herself,
at the alleged rudeness of groups of
demonstrators, presumably to her
self and her colleagues in administra
tion.
That the crushing injustice of apar
theid and the annoying fact of being
sassed by a group of student protes
ters are in no sense comparable on
any conceivable moral scale should
go without saying. If Ms. Fetter and
the rest of the Stanford Community
— the rest of the world for that mat
ter —were actually all that anguished
(her word) over the fate of South Af
ricans, or Cambodians, or Chileans,
or any of the rest of by far the larger
portion of people who are in some
basic sense "oppressed," then they,
that is we, would move heaven and
earth to do something about it.
We do not, and that fact itself wit
nesses to the fatuity of our "an
guish." When we, as Ms. Fetter and
her two fellow correspondents do,
carp at an organization like SCRIP,
which is, if nothing else, seeking to
arouse our consciences, because
SCRIP is a personal annoyance and
perhaps at times somewhat rude,
then let us not hearabout anguish, or
an "admirable . . . concern and sup
port for oppressed peoples."

Words unlegislatable
Ellen Byrne and Meriel Burtle, in
their recent column on sexist lan
guage (Daily, May 10), stress the im
portance of legislation in the fight
against sexist language. This idea of
"language through law" is both inef
fective and dangerous.
Unfortunately, changing words
will not change attitudes, at least not
in a positive direction. While
feminists may see nothing wrong
with saying "chairperson" instead of
"chairman," most people who do
not fully embrace the concept of
feminism will resent the idea of
being told that they must change
their choice of words.
Words reflect the culture and soci
ety in which they are used. They will
change when the cultural and
societal attitudes have been changed
— and not before.
The authors do concede, however,
that "there may be some legitimacy
to the argument that legislation of
language (such as the ASSU resolu
tion) impinges on personal free
doms." This, indeed, is the crux of
the issue. How can they even con
sider legislating how people speak,
what words they may or may not use?
Words are symbols of the mind,
and I would give the state no more
power to interfere with a person's
mind than most feminists would give
the state the power to interfere with a
person's body. Language is not an
area for legislative control.
As George Orwell might have
said," Let the meaning choose the
word, and not the legislation."

GPU missed it
It seems to me that the CPU in or
ganizing the "blue jeans day" really
blew it — they missed a chance for a
far greater show of support. They
should have sponsored a "clothes
day" in which only gay people wore
clothes. This might have had a
greater PR value.
