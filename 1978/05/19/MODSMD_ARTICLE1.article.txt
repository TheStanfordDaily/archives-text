# Against the Grain loses some funds
## 
### Ben Pollock 
The ASSU Publications Board, in
reaction to a Daily article published
Monday, cut in half the allocation to
the radical newspaper Against the
Grain Wednesday.
Against the Grain was allocated
$750 to publish four eight-page tab
loid newspapers during the 1977-78
school year, according to Barry Parr,
Publications Board chairman.
However, the Against the Grain
staff has only printed one issue this
year, during fall quarter. They helped
finance the Stanford Organizing
Committee (SOC) Disorientation
Week program and also donated
$140 to the Stanford Committee for a
Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) for printing leaflets this quar
ter Parr said.
Normally, the publications board
takes requests for monetary alloca
tions fall quarter, approves them,
then transfers the money from the
publications board ASSU account to
the accounts of the various campus
newspapers.
However, Parr said, through over
sight, he neglected to transfer the
money for Against the Grain. He said
he only needed reminding. "If they
had needed the money, they
would've called me."
The fault was thus with the paper
as well as with him, Parr said.
Lloyd Dixon, spokesperson for
Against the Grain, agreed. "It is my
fault, too, because I forgot," he said.
Dixon said they had enough
money from last year to cover the
first issue last fall and the donations
to SOC and SCRIP. Since theydid not
publish after that, he said he never
checked to see if the funds were
transferred.
Although it was thr donation to
SCRIP that "angered him, Parr said
he had been planning to give Against
the Grain less money than they had
been allocated since they had only
published one issue. He said he did
not "think the other three issues
would be printed this late in the
year."
Assuming they would publish one
more issue, Parr recommended to
the Publications Board that they pay
the newspaper half their allocation,
$375, to reimburse them for this year.
Dixon said yesterday, "it's fairly
unprecedented for them to do that."
Against the Grain originally plan
ned to do "one issue fall, two in the
winter, and the fourth around the
end of spring quarter," he said.
Although articles were written for
the second issue, Dixon said, the
paper never got printed because
"people's energies were
elsewhere."
