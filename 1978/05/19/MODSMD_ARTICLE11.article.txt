# Withdrawal won't benefit black majority
##

The issue of a moral investment
policy — one that has rocked Stan
ford and other universities — is a
complex question that cannot be re
duced to cute phrases. "Apartheid
means profit and Stanford won't stop
it" may flow smoothly off the tongue
— or fit nicely on a banner — but
such asimplisticargument, oblivious
to any rational discussion, does an
injustice to the cause.
The problems with investment also
appear in terms of foreign aid and
trade with other nations. Whether
we build a tractor plant in country X,
sell them the tractors, or lend them
the money to buy the tractors, we are
still, in some sense, "supporting"
that country.
Further questipns may arise, such
as the pragmatic one dealing with
self-defense. For example, there may
be no specific "moral" reason not to
sell computers to the USSR, but if
they can be used to guide missiles
toward the U.S., there is a very
pragmatic one. I won't discuss these
concerns any further.
The purpose of any moral invest
ment policy should be to benefit
those people who are being injured
by the particular investment and
country involved. Few people would
argue that apartheid in South Africa
is not immoral, reprehensible, and
indefensible, or that the
neocolonialism and repression of
dissidents by the Soviet Union-is out
rageous, immoral, and evil; how
ever, the question is whether corpo
rate withdrawal from South Africa, or
a ban on wheat sales to the USSR, will
help those people who are being op
pressed.
Rightists who hate the USSR and
leftists who hate South Africa should
be consistent. Though the govern
ment in each case may epitomize the
worst humanity has to offer, our in
vestment policy will affect people as
well as that government. Leonid
Brezhnev and Prime Minister )on
Vorster will not suffer; the average
worker will.
Easier cases found
Some easy cases can be found.
Where the conduct of the companies
involved is clearly injurious to the
people of the country, withdrawal
(or the end of aid or trade) would be
appropriate. Examples of these are
the sale of military hardware to
militarily aggressive and avaricious

regimes, the near sale of helicopters,
which would have been used to help
murder political opponents, to
Uganda, and the sale of surveillance
technology, which has undoubtedly
been used to track down dissidents,
to the USSR.
However, the mere presence of
American corporations in a country,
or the mere existence of aid or trade,
is not enough. A company that was
notably regressive in its treatment of
the local populace compared to the
local/national standard could con
ceivably cause substantial injury, but
this is not the normal case.
Thus the question in the current
debate over companies investing in
South Africa should be to find the
policy most beneficial to the black
majority — not the one most attuned
to any particular political
philosophy.
Helping or hurting
In South Africa, most of the com
panies appear to operate at the na
tional standard, and do not engage in
any other clearly injurious activities.
The question is then whether the
withdrawal of corporations — whose
alleged harm is only their presence
— will help, or hurt, the blacks in
volved.
While withdrawal would eliminate
any implicit approval of apartheid
that corporate investment may give,
it would also remove any possible
leverage with which to moderate the
South African government. Further
more, since South African law re
quires that any funds garnered from
the sale of corporate assets be used
to purchase government bonds,
withdrawal may — at least in the
short run — strengthen the South Af
rican government.
Only four per cent
And what of the black workers in
volved? Since only 4 per cent of
foreign investment is American,
withdrawal would probably have lit
tle effect. What little effect it would
have, however, would be to throw
blacks out of work; it is inconceiva
ble that the South African govern
ment would let the white minority
suffer.
Hcwever, if we assume a pull-out
would have a major effect on the
South African economy, we will be
causing furthe/ economic misery
primarily to the black majority. We
may even help foster a bloody civil

war — in which blacks would bear
the bulk of the hardship, suffering,
and dying. This might be fine for
armchair political theorists, who
think it is the price of liberty; how
ever, theyaren'tthe ones who would
be paying that price.
Realistic policy
Finally, since American invest
ment, aid, and trade are übiquitous
throughout the world, a policy
against mere presence (or exis
tence), as opposed to substantial in
jury, would be virtually impossible to
follow.
Only Western Europe, Japan, ahd a
few other nations respect human
rights to any degree. Abrogation of
all investment in, trade with, and aid
to most of the world seems impracti
cal at best, and counterproductive at
worst.
And it is not enough to say that we
should start with South Africa and
later think about a total policy.
Where will withdrawn funds be rein
vested? To Uganda or the Central Af-

rican Empire? Both of these regimes
are racist, minority, and repressive.
To Cambodia? It is estimated that
fully one-seventh of the population
has been slaughtered by the Khmer
Rouge. To Chile? The Philippines?
The USSR? If our "moral" investment
policy resulted in investments being
shifted to one of the countries that is
more offensive, murderous, and
immoral than South Africa, we would
have, at best, a perverse policy.
Therefore, the withdrawal issue
should be decided in the best in
terests of the black majority, and
should be the result of a total invest
ment policy.
I have yet to be shown that with
drawal of U.S. corporations from
South Africa — because of the evil of
their mere presence — will benefit
the black majority, or that such a polr
icy could be, or should be, carried
out consistently throughout the
world.

country involved. Few people would
argue that apartheid in South Africa
is not immoral, reprehensible, and
indefensible, or that the
neocolonialism and repression of
dissidents by the Soviet Union-is out
rageous, immoral, and evil; how
ever, the question is whether corpo
rate withdrawal from South Africa, or
a ban on wheat sales to the USSR, will
help those people who are being op
pressed.
Rightists who hate the USSR and
leftists who hate South Africa should
be consistent. Though the govern
ment in each case may epitomize the
worst humanity has to offer, our in
vestment policy will affect people as
well as that government. Leonid
Brezhnev and Prime Minister )on
Vorster will not suffer; the average
worker will.
Easier cases found
Some easy cases can be found.
Where the conduct of the companies
involved is clearly injurious to the
people of the country, withdrawal
(or the end of aid or trade) would be
appropriate. Examples of these are
the sale of military hardware to
militarily aggressive and avaricious

regimes, the near sale of helicopters,
which would have been used to help
murder political opponents, to
Uganda, and the sale of surveillance
technology, which has undoubtedly
been used to track down dissidents,
to the USSR.
However, the mere presence of
American corporations in a country,
or the mere existence of aid or trade,
is not enough. A company that was
notably regressive in its treatment of
the local populace compared to the
local/national standard could con
ceivably cause substantial injury, but
this is not the normal case.
Thus the question in the current
debate over companies investing in
South Africa should be to find the
policy most beneficial to the black
majority — not the one most attuned
to any particular political
philosophy.
Helping or hurting
In South Africa, most of the com
panies appear to operate at the na
tional standard, and do not engage in
any other clearly injurious activities.
The question is then whether the
withdrawal of corporations — whose
alleged harm is only their presence
— will help, or hurt, the blacks in
volved.
While withdrawal would eliminate
any implicit approval of apartheid
that corporate investment may give,
it would also remove any possible
leverage with which to moderate the
South African government. Further
more, since South African law re
quires that any funds garnered from
the sale of corporate assets be used
to purchase government bonds,
withdrawal may — at least in the
short run — strengthen the South Af
rican government.
Only four per cent
And what of the black workers in
volved? Since only 4 per cent of
foreign investment is American,
withdrawal would probably have lit
tle effect. What little effect it would
have, however, would be to throw
blacks out of work; it is inconceiva
ble that the South African govern
ment would let the white minority
suffer.
Hcwever, if we assume a pull-out
would have a major effect on the
South African economy, we will be
causing furthe/ economic misery
primarily to the black majority. We
may even help foster a bloody civil

war — in which blacks would bear
the bulk of the hardship, suffering,
and dying. This might be fine for
armchair political theorists, who
think it is the price of liberty; how
ever, theyaren'tthe ones who would
be paying that price.
Realistic policy
Finally, since American invest
ment, aid, and trade are übiquitous
throughout the world, a policy
against mere presence (or exis
tence), as opposed to substantial in
jury, would be virtually impossible to
follow.
Only Western Europe, Japan, ahd a
few other nations respect human
rights to any degree. Abrogation of
all investment in, trade with, and aid
to most of the world seems impracti
cal at best, and counterproductive at
worst.
And it is not enough to say that we
should start with South Africa and
later think about a total policy.
Where will withdrawn funds be rein
vested? To Uganda or the Central Af-

rican Empire? Both of these regimes
are racist, minority, and repressive.
To Cambodia? It is estimated that
fully one-seventh of the population
has been slaughtered by the Khmer
Rouge. To Chile? The Philippines?
The USSR? If our "moral" investment
policy resulted in investments being
shifted to one of the countries that is
more offensive, murderous, and
immoral than South Africa, we would
have, at best, a perverse policy.
Therefore, the withdrawal issue
should be decided in the best in
terests of the black majority, and
should be the result of a total invest
ment policy.
I have yet to be shown that with
drawal of U.S. corporations from
South Africa — because of the evil of
their mere presence — will benefit
the black majority, or that such a polr
icy could be, or should be, carried
out consistently throughout the
world.

The issue of a moral investment
policy — one that has rocked Stan
ford and other universities — is a
complex question that cannot be re
duced to cute phrases. "Apartheid
means profit and Stanford won't stop
it" may flow smoothly off the tongue
— or fit nicely on a banner — but
such asimplisticargument, oblivious
to any rational discussion, does an
injustice to the cause.
The problems with investment also
appear in terms of foreign aid and
trade with other nations. Whether
we build a tractor plant in country X,
sell them the tractors, or lend them
the money to buy the tractors, we are
still, in some sense, "supporting"
that country.
Further questipns may arise, such
as the pragmatic one dealing with
self-defense. For example, there may
be no specific "moral" reason not to
sell computers to the USSR, but if
they can be used to guide missiles
toward the U.S., there is a very
pragmatic one. I won't discuss these
concerns any further.
The purpose of any moral invest
