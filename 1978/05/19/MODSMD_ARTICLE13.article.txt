### Alison Carpenter 
I have a Ford Maverick, which by any defini
tion is a "compact car." I have a "B" lot sticker.
Many parking spots on campus are marked
"compact cars only." Yet, at times, I have seen
sedans, station wagons and even trucks parked
in these spots. Sometimes, because the parking
spots really are made for compact cars only, the
larger vehicles overlap into two spots, forcing
me to park illegally, usually getting ticketed.
I want to know why "non-compact cars" don't
ever get tickets for parking in the "compact cars
only" spots. I once asked a cop who was giving
out tickets; he claimed the "compact car" stan
dard is too vague to apply. I've been studying
law for four years, and "compact cars" is a lot
clearer and narrower than many standards the
courts have said are not too vague to apply.
I resent getting ticketed for parking illegally
when those who've forced me to park illegally by
taking spots reserved for my kind of car don't
themselves get ticketed.
I hope you can help me.

According to Walt Konar, captain in charge of
the parking program on campus, "non-compact
cars" don't get ticketed in the spaces marked
"compact cars only" because it is not illegal for
them to park there.
The "compact cars only" designation is
merely an encouragement for the drivers of
"compact cars" to use these spaces, he said. But
it is not illegal when large cars do.
Konar pointed out, however, that officers fre
quently write "obstruction" citations for "non
compact cars" in the "compact cars only" slots
when the ends of the cars jut out, hindering the
maneuvering of other vehicles. But to argue
they should receive a citation solely for parking
in a "compact car only" space is simply not valid,
he said.
In an effort to "encourage people" to Lse the
spaces as designated, Konar said officers fre
quently leave notes on the windshields of such
vehicles pointing out to them the spaces have
been designated for "compact cars."
If you wish to inquire more about this issue or
investigate the possibility of citations for "non
compact cars" parked in "compact cars only"

spaced, he said you might want to contact Bob
Hamrdla, assistant to the president for trustee
affairs and chairman of the Committee on Park
ing and Transportation.

Last week I placed some posters advertising a
speech sponsored by the Law School on some of
the kiosks around White Plaza and the
bookstore. To my dismay, I discovered that a
very high proportion of the posters were
obscured the very next day by leaflets advertis
ing coming attraction at a Palo Alto bar and night
club.
It seems to me that Stanford activities should
have priority over off-campus events when it
comes to advertising on the kiosks. Is there a
policy regulating use of this valuable advertising
spacef If so, is there any enforcement? If not,
why not?
- D.B.
The Office of Public Events has jurisdiction
over what goes up on the kiosks, said Sally
Mentzer, secretary there. The next time you
want an ad up on them you probably should
work through their office rather than putting it
up yourself.
Ads for University groups do get priority over
publicity for off-campus organizations, Mentzer
said.
The does not mean, however, the office does
not post ads for outside groups. But, Mentzer
added, they will do so only if the ads pertain to
the students here. Mentzer cited the perform
ing arts groups at Berkeley, Foothill and the local
community as examples.
Twice a week students hired by Public Events
post ads requested by on- and off-campus
groups. Mentzer said ads for University organi
zations — even if not put up by the office — are
not taken down at that time.
However, she said, the students are told to
discard ads for outside groups not put up by
their office.

I have a Ford Maverick, which by any defini
tion is a "compact car." I have a "B" lot sticker.
Many parking spots on campus are marked
"compact cars only." Yet, at times, I have seen
sedans, station wagons and even trucks parked
in these spots. Sometimes, because the parking
spots really are made for compact cars only, the
larger vehicles overlap into two spots, forcing
me to park illegally, usually getting ticketed.
I want to know why "non-compact cars" don't
ever get tickets for parking in the "compact cars
only" spots. I once asked a cop who was giving
out tickets; he claimed the "compact car" stan
dard is too vague to apply. I've been studying
law for four years, and "compact cars" is a lot
clearer and narrower than many standards the
courts have said are not too vague to apply.
I resent getting ticketed for parking illegally
when those who've forced me to park illegally by
taking spots reserved for my kind of car don't
themselves get ticketed.
I hope you can help me.

According to Walt Konar, captain in charge of
the parking program on campus, "non-compact
cars" don't get ticketed in the spaces marked
"compact cars only" because it is not illegal for
them to park there.
The "compact cars only" designation is
merely an encouragement for the drivers of
"compact cars" to use these spaces, he said. But
it is not illegal when large cars do.
Konar pointed out, however, that officers fre
quently write "obstruction" citations for "non
compact cars" in the "compact cars only" slots
when the ends of the cars jut out, hindering the
maneuvering of other vehicles. But to argue
they should receive a citation solely for parking
in a "compact car only" space is simply not valid,
he said.
In an effort to "encourage people" to Lse the
spaces as designated, Konar said officers fre
quently leave notes on the windshields of such
vehicles pointing out to them the spaces have
been designated for "compact cars."
If you wish to inquire more about this issue or
investigate the possibility of citations for "non
compact cars" parked in "compact cars only"

spaced, he said you might want to contact Bob
Hamrdla, assistant to the president for trustee
affairs and chairman of the Committee on Park
ing and Transportation.

Last week I placed some posters advertising a
speech sponsored by the Law School on some of
the kiosks around White Plaza and the
bookstore. To my dismay, I discovered that a
very high proportion of the posters were
obscured the very next day by leaflets advertis
ing coming attraction at a Palo Alto bar and night
club.
It seems to me that Stanford activities should
have priority over off-campus events when it
comes to advertising on the kiosks. Is there a
policy regulating use of this valuable advertising
spacef If so, is there any enforcement? If not,
why not?

The Office of Public Events has jurisdiction
over what goes up on the kiosks, said Sally
Mentzer, secretary there. The next time you
want an ad up on them you probably should
work through their office rather than putting it
up yourself.

not post ads for outside groups. But, Mentzer
