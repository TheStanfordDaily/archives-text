# U.S. spying recounted in trial
## 
### Jeffrey Stein Pacific News Service 
Washington, D.C. — The current trial of
two men charged with spying for Hanoi is
also providing a rare glimpse into the
shadow world of espionage used by the
United States against Vietnam through the
testimony of the Vietnamese wife of a U.S.
Navy intelligence officer.
Dung Krall, 32, a key witness and a CIA
agent, has described on the stand her mis
sion to spy on the Vietnamese Mission in
Paris during post-war negotiations with
the United States. She also recounted how
she worked with the FBI in 1977 to infiltrate
Vietnamese activities aimed at promoting
reconciliation between the United States
and Vietnam and aiding the settlement of
refugees.
Krall was recruited in 1975 by Robert
Hall, a CIA officer who contacted her in
Hawaii and directed her operations over
the next two years. "She was a first-rate
agent," Hall testified.
Krall was not the only member of the
family linked to the CIA. Her sister also
was recruited in 1975 by the CIA to operate
an accommodation address in Honolulu at
$250 a month, to which mail and messages
between agents could be sent in confi
dence. The CIA is also paying relocation
expenses from London to the United
States for Dung Krall's husband, Douglas.
But the family member that might have
benefitted the CIA most was Krall's father
Dang Quang Minh, a high-ranking official
in the foreign ministry in Hanoi who in
1968 was the Viet Cong's ambassador to

Moscow.
The war had torn the family apart. With
her sister, then her mother, Krall had be
come a virulent anti-communist, while her
father joined the revolution in Hanoi. In
1954, the family — except for the father —
went to the south.
Twice after being recruited by the CIA,
Krall tried to induce her father to defect to
the West under the guise of rejoining his
family. After a separation of 20 years, she
met her father in a London hotel room in
1975 and pleaded with him to "forget poli
tics and come live with my mother any
place he wants."
"It was a CIA operation," she conceded
on the stand.
During a Hiroshima memorial gathering
in Japan in 1977, she was sent by the CIA to
ask her father to leave the Communists
and come live in the West. Again he turned
her down.
Krall's role in the trial — and that of her
CIA mentor — has been to produce proof
of a Vietnamese communist spy ring in the
United States. Through her work for the
FBI in infiltrating the Vietnamese recon
ciliation movement in the United States,
Krall befriended David Truong, a Stanford
graduate, who is on trial on charges of
allegedly funneling documents obtained
by a U.S. State Department officer to Viet
namese officials in Paris.
Krall testified that Truong asked her to
take materials from Washington to Viet
namese government officials in Paris. Sev
eral times before making the trip, she said,
she delivered the contents of the packets

to FBI agents who opened and photo
graphed them before allowing them to go
on to Paris.
On Jan. 31, Truong and Ronald Hum
phrey, the U.S. Information Agency
employee who allegedly supplied the clas
sified information, were arrested on the
strength of indictments handed up by a
grand jury after hearing only secret tes
timony from Krall. The Vietnamese ambas
sador to the United Nations, Dinh Ba Thi,
was named an unindicted co-conspirator
and expelled from the United States.
Krall's testimony illuminated her own
and the ClA's operations against the
Communist Vietnamese. She described
how, using her father's name, she bef
riended Vietnamese officials during talks
with the United States in Paris in the spring
of 1977 and reported almost daily to her
CIA superior information she had elicited.
On one occasion in late April 1977 she was
sent to Paris during preparations for a
round of talks when Hanoi Premier Pham
Van Dong arrived.
"She was targeted against certain mem
bers of the Vietnamese delegation," Hall
testified.
Hall did not reveal if the mission was
successful, but Krall testified that one of
her reports outlined a reported Viet
namese demand of war reparations in ex
change for information on Americans mis
sing in action in Vietnam.
For her two-year career with the agency,
Krall said she was paid $18,000 in salary and
far beyond that in expenses, including $80
per diem while traveling.

testimony of the Vietnamese wife of a U.S.
Navy intelligence officer.
Dung Krall, 32, a key witness and a CIA
agent, has described on the stand her mis
sion to spy on the Vietnamese Mission in
Paris during post-war negotiations with
the United States. She also recounted how
she worked with the FBI in 1977 to infiltrate
Vietnamese activities aimed at promoting
reconciliation between the United States
and Vietnam and aiding the settlement of
refugees.
Krall was recruited in 1975 by Robert
Hall, a CIA officer who contacted her in
Hawaii and directed her operations over
the next two years. "She was a first-rate
agent," Hall testified.
Krall was not the only member of the
family linked to the CIA. Her sister also
was recruited in 1975 by the CIA to operate
an accommodation address in Honolulu at
$250 a month, to which mail and messages
between agents could be sent in confi
dence. The CIA is also paying relocation
expenses from London to the United
States for Dung Krall's husband, Douglas.
But the family member that might have
benefitted the CIA most was Krall's father
Dang Quang Minh, a high-ranking official
in the foreign ministry in Hanoi who in
1968 was the Viet Cong's ambassador to

Moscow.
The war had torn the family apart. With
her sister, then her mother, Krall had be
come a virulent anti-communist, while her
father joined the revolution in Hanoi. In
1954, the family — except for the father —
went to the south.
Twice after being recruited by the CIA,
Krall tried to induce her father to defect to
the West under the guise of rejoining his
family. After a separation of 20 years, she
met her father in a London hotel room in
1975 and pleaded with him to "forget poli
tics and come live with my mother any
place he wants."
"It was a CIA operation," she conceded
on the stand.
During a Hiroshima memorial gathering
in Japan in 1977, she was sent by the CIA to
ask her father to leave the Communists
and come live in the West. Again he turned
her down.
Krall's role in the trial — and that of her
CIA mentor — has been to produce proof
of a Vietnamese communist spy ring in the
United States. Through her work for the
FBI in infiltrating the Vietnamese recon
ciliation movement in the United States,
Krall befriended David Truong, a Stanford
graduate, who is on trial on charges of
allegedly funneling documents obtained
by a U.S. State Department officer to Viet
namese officials in Paris.
Krall testified that Truong asked her to
take materials from Washington to Viet
namese government officials in Paris. Sev
eral times before making the trip, she said,
she delivered the contents of the packets

to FBI agents who opened and photo
graphed them before allowing them to go
on to Paris.
On Jan. 31, Truong and Ronald Hum
phrey, the U.S. Information Agency
employee who allegedly supplied the clas
sified information, were arrested on the
strength of indictments handed up by a
grand jury after hearing only secret tes
timony from Krall. The Vietnamese ambas
sador to the United Nations, Dinh Ba Thi,
was named an unindicted co-conspirator
and expelled from the United States.
Krall's testimony illuminated her own
and the ClA's operations against the
Communist Vietnamese. She described
how, using her father's name, she bef
riended Vietnamese officials during talks
with the United States in Paris in the spring
of 1977 and reported almost daily to her
CIA superior information she had elicited.
On one occasion in late April 1977 she was
sent to Paris during preparations for a
round of talks when Hanoi Premier Pham
Van Dong arrived.
"She was targeted against certain mem
bers of the Vietnamese delegation," Hall
testified.
Hall did not reveal if the mission was
successful, but Krall testified that one of
her reports outlined a reported Viet
namese demand of war reparations in ex
change for information on Americans mis
sing in action in Vietnam.
For her two-year career with the agency,
Krall said she was paid $18,000 in salary and
far beyond that in expenses, including $80
per diem while traveling.
Washington, D.C. — The current trial of
two men charged with spying for Hanoi is
also providing a rare glimpse into the
shadow world of espionage used by the
United States against Vietnam through the
