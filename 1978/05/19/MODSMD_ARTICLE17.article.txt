# UC investments criticized

### 
Sacramento (AP) — The University of Califor
nia's most "disappointing investments" are in
companies doing business with South Africa,
according to a nonprofit research organization.
The findings by the California Public Policy
Center contradicted comments by UCTreasurer
Owsley Hammond, who has argued it would be
financially unwise to sell UC stock in companies
doing business with South Africa.
The center's calculations placed the poten
tial loss due to poor investment policies at $119
million.
Tom Hayden, a former U.S. Senate Democra
tic candidate who is on the center's board, had
urged the board to study how UC invests its $1.9
billion investment portfolio.
The center criticized UC's action putting the
bulk of its money, about $880 million, in com

mon stocks. The UC treasurer's report said UC
investment in common stock lost 5.11 per cent.
Cary Lowe, the Los Angeles-based center's
co-director, said the UC Regents "affirmatively
ignored numerous other opportunities which
would have yielded a dramatically superior rate
of return on fully-secured investments.
Hammon said this sort of criticism could be
made "of any portfolio in a time when the stock
market happens to go down."
Hammon said yesterday in San Francisco that
the figures cited by Hayden did not include
dividends earned by the stock.
When dividends are taken into account,
Hammon said, UC's stock investments have
earned an average of 10.48 per cent for each of
the last seven years — higher than any of the
options suggested by Hayden.
