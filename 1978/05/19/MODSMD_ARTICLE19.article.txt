# Empty sundecks suggested for not-yet-tan sunbathers
## features 
### Mindy Mayer 
There is a curious paradox in
Stanford fashion this season:
one may be sporting a tan (in
deed one must be seen sport
ing a tan), but one may never
be seen acquiring it.
This is not to say that lying
out in the sun is not fashiona
ble — au contraire, it is defi
nitely fashionable (as long as
you don't appear to be concen
trating too hard), and is even
essential if you want to show
off that new Parisian bikini you

purchased over spring break.
Getting it wet is out of the
question, however.
But before you venture out
into those rays (and into some
one s gaze), it is imperative
that you have an itsy bit of a tan
leftover either from St.
Thomas, or if you have no
other recourse, from last sea
son in San Jose.
Never, repeat, never go out
side with glaring white thighs
exposed, unless you want to
lose that "special someone,"

your friends, and every chance
you ever had of being asked
how much that lovely suit cost.
Terrible dilemma
Of course this means a terri
ble dilemma: one can't begin
to be seen tanning because
one looks like a herring in sour
cream, yet one will never stop
looking like a herring in sour
cream unless one begins tan
ning. This can be very trying,
unless your friends happen to
be herring fetishists.

But trying or not, it will never
do to give up in the world of
fashion. The following, then, is
a list of options open to those
students suffering from pig
ment inferiority.
First of all, you can just give
up. This means trying to blend
in with the flourescent lights in
Meyer library, or trying to con
sole yourself by: taking out
your old Art 1 book and look
ing at the Rubens women; or
finding out everything there is
to know about the perils of
ultraviolet overexposure, and
telling all your friends that their
hair and teeth will fall out. This
is not recommended.
Incognito
Secondly, you can start your
suntan "incognito" on another
residence's sundeck. Almost
every dormitory has its own
sundeck — Branner, Toyon,
Roble and most of the Row
Houses, for example, have
their own decks, all quite dis
tinctively decorated with vary
ing shades of brown and a col
orful blend of bathing suits.

The only problem is that they
all have their "sundeck
toughs," too. They are the reg
ulars who, when confronted
with an "irregular," tend to be
come aggressive, leaving you
the option of defending your
self with your Bain de Soleil
Super Filter, or slinking back
into the shade.
Thirdly, but only if you are
absolutely desperate, there is
Q-T. Whatever you do, don't
deceive yourself into thinking
that Q-T will leave you looking
normal. Rumor has it that Q-T
is really only leftover orange
Easter egg dye.
Furtive suntanners
Finally, the most highly re
commended option is to join
the masses of furtive suntan
ners at Stanford. The furtive

suntanner typically shuns large
groups of tanning bodies.
He or she will instead stride
past these groups (usually
clothed in tweed coat and
gloves) and call out "Really, I'd
love to, but my doctor says I
mustn't," only to shed their
clothing on one of the Univer
sity's desolate roof-tops, and
acquire a gorgeous tan.
There are several such sun
decks on campus, most of
which are very large and very
empty. For example, there is
one over the Graduate School
of Business, the School of Edu
cation, the Mathematical Sci
ences Library and the Biology
building.
All are open to Stanford stu
dents (though some require an
ID), and remain open for the

same hours as the facilities
below them.
Decor
Granted, their decor is not
outstanding. The business
school sundeck, for instance,
contains a lot of cement, a few
cawing birds, and a scattering
of wire mesh tables and chairs
— the kind that leave your back
looking like minute steak.
But after all, the essential
element is not what they con
tain, but what they lack —
people, especially those of a
deeper hue. It will be just you,
your thighs and loads of sun.
The lack of people also
means these sundecks are
ideal for studying, if you don't
mind having your book slip out
of your well-greased fingers
occasionally.

For those students who wish to preserve and exhibit their beautiful bronze tans, deGuerre Pool is the
place to be. But those with milky-white skin often prefer to ba>> their first rays of the season in more
secluded spots, such as the Meyer Library sundeck.

orful blend of bathing suits.

The only problem is that they
all have their "sundeck
toughs," too. They are the reg
ulars who, when confronted
with an "irregular," tend to be
come aggressive, leaving you
the option of defending your
self with your Bain de Soleil
Super Filter, or slinking back
into the shade.
Thirdly, but only if you are
absolutely desperate, there is
Q-T. Whatever you do, don't
deceive yourself into thinking
that Q-T will leave you looking
normal. Rumor has it that Q-T
is really only leftover orange
Easter egg dye.
Furtive suntanners
Finally, the most highly re
commended option is to join
the masses of furtive suntan
ners at Stanford. The furtive

suntanner typically shuns large
groups of tanning bodies.
He or she will instead stride
past these groups (usually
clothed in tweed coat and
gloves) and call out "Really, I'd
love to, but my doctor says I
mustn't," only to shed their
clothing on one of the Univer
sity's desolate roof-tops, and
acquire a gorgeous tan.
There are several such sun
decks on campus, most of
which are very large and very
empty. For example, there is
one over the Graduate School
of Business, the School of Edu
cation, the Mathematical Sci
ences Library and the Biology
building.
All are open to Stanford stu
dents (though some require an
ID), and remain open for the

same hours as the facilities
below them.
Decor
Granted, their decor is not
outstanding. The business
school sundeck, for instance,
contains a lot of cement, a few
cawing birds, and a scattering
of wire mesh tables and chairs
— the kind that leave your back
looking like minute steak.
But after all, the essential
element is not what they con
tain, but what they lack —
people, especially those of a
deeper hue. It will be just you,
your thighs and loads of sun.
The lack of people also
means these sundecks are
ideal for studying, if you don't
mind having your book slip out
of your well-greased fingers
occasionally.

For those students who wish to preserve and exhibit their beautiful bronze tans, deGuerre Pool is the
place to be. But those with milky-white skin often prefer to ba>> their first rays of the season in more
secluded spots, such as the Meyer Library sundeck.
There is a curious paradox in
Stanford fashion this season:
one may be sporting a tan (in
deed one must be seen sport
ing a tan), but one may never
be seen acquiring it.
This is not to say that lying
out in the sun is not fashiona
ble — au contraire, it is defi
nitely fashionable (as long as
you don't appear to be concen
trating too hard), and is even
essential if you want to show
off that new Parisian bikini you

purchased over spring break.
Getting it wet is out of the
question, however.
But before you venture out
into those rays (and into some
one s gaze), it is imperative
that you have an itsy bit of a tan
leftover either from St.
Thomas, or if you have no
other recourse, from last sea
son in San Jose.
Never, repeat, never go out
side with glaring white thighs
exposed, unless you want to
lose that "special someone,"

your friends, and every chance
you ever had of being asked
how much that lovely suit cost.
Terrible dilemma
Of course this means a terri
ble dilemma: one can't begin
to be seen tanning because
one looks like a herring in sour
cream, yet one will never stop
looking like a herring in sour
cream unless one begins tan
ning. This can be very trying,
unless your friends happen to
be herring fetishists.

But trying or not, it will never
do to give up in the world of
fashion. The following, then, is
a list of options open to those
students suffering from pig
ment inferiority.
First of all, you can just give
up. This means trying to blend
in with the flourescent lights in
Meyer library, or trying to con
sole yourself by: taking out
your old Art 1 book and look
ing at the Rubens women; or
finding out everything there is
to know about the perils of
ultraviolet overexposure, and
telling all your friends that their
hair and teeth will fall out. This
is not recommended.
Incognito
Secondly, you can start your
suntan "incognito" on another
residence's sundeck. Almost
every dormitory has its own
sundeck — Branner, Toyon,
Roble and most of the Row
Houses, for example, have
their own decks, all quite dis
tinctively decorated with vary
ing shades of brown and a col
orful blend of bathing suits.

The only problem is that they
all have their "sundeck
toughs," too. They are the reg
ulars who, when confronted
with an "irregular," tend to be
