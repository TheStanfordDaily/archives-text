# Scientists discuss role of technology in society

### Cheryl Zollars 
Wits and opinions clashed last
night as three scientists discussed
the public responsibility of science
and technology and its implications
for the future in a symposium spon
sored by Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues.
Paul Ehrlich, Willis Harman and
John McCarthy participated in
the symposium held in Kresge Au
ditorium. Discussion focused on
"how science can go forward to
maximize the good aspects of the
paradoxes" created by the rapid ad
vance of technology, according to
SWOPSI spokesman Bruce Rittman.
Paul Ehrlich, professor of biologi
cal sciences, said Americans must
ask the question "Are we going to be
trampled by the gall up of technol
ogy?" The continuation of civiliza
tion depends on the science and
technology that brought about our
present problems, he said.
Ehrlich said increased education
and public awareness is a solution to
the problem. "The time has come to
realize that science is a fully human
activity and present it like that," he
said.
John McCarthy, professor of com
puter science, had a different ap
proach. He questioned the need for
discussing the appropriateness of
science.
"The term appropriate science'
suggests that there is 'inappropriate
science,' " he said. "If there is 'inap
propriate science,' then there is'ap
propriate ignorance' and I don't be
lieve in it."
McCarthy discussed areas of scien
tific study he said he was "enthused"

about such as artificial intelligence,
the possibility of an improved elec
tric battery to solve energy and
transportation problems, low grade
ores supplying needed minerals and
the ability to lengthen life. He also
suggested home computer terminals
and "construction robots" to cut
high construction costs.
McCarthy said he would like to see
advances in space travel "in order to
recreate a frontier'' which is "impor
tant for the preservation of any de
gree of human freedom.''
McCarthy criticized America's fai
lure to move to nuclear energy and
the tendency for scientific subjects
to become political issues.
Willis Harman, also a professor of
computer science, considered a
third solution to the problems
created by the advance of technol
ogy-
Our present scientific knowledge
is imbalanced and the appropriate
sciences are the sciences needed to
restore the balance, Harman said.
Harman said the appropriate sci
ences were those which would study
man's inner experience. However
scientists have been resistant to the
study of sciences which focus on
this, such as hypnosis because of the
"implicit suggestion that the vast
majority of mental activity is out of
your consciousness."
"This reduces our sense of being
in control," he said. Through studies
of biofeedback, psychic phenome
non, and consciousness control "we
can get the kind of wisdom about
values and goals that are wholesome
for man," Harman said.
In a question and answer session

following the discussion, wits and
tempers flared when the scientists
disagreed on the merits of their re
spective views. At one tense moment
between Ehrlich and McCarthy, the
moderator, James Leckie, associate
professor of civil engineering, inter
vened.
