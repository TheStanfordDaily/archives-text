## 'the last waltz'/dave ford The 						best rock film yet, and only slightly flawed 
### 
"Rock and roll" films, like
the art form they attempt to
portray, have historically (if
such a word can be applied to
so young a media fixation) re
lied on feeling and style at the
expense of any more solid sub
stance or essence. Such works
as the Stones' "Ladies and
Gentlemen," Zeppelin's
"Song Remains the Same," and
the Dead's "Steal Your Face,"
while providing the viewer
with adequate (barely) concert
footage and the occasional "in
terview" or fantasy shot, have
failed to make any lasting
statements, implicit or explicit,

The cinematography, as could be ex
pected from Scorsese ("New York, New
York/'"Taxi Driver") is flawless, and is the
prime reason why the film stands head
and shoulders above anything ever done
about rock music. . . .

on the nature of the music it
self or the lifestyle intrinsic to
its production. They seem
more like excuses to keep the
bands' names before the pub
lic — for rock 'n' roll films, they
sure ain't rock 'n' roll.
Winterland
With "The Last Waltz," (play
ing at the Century 21 in San
Jose), director Martin Scorsese
and producer Robbie
Robertson have managed a
generally superb marriage of
the documentary and the rock
concert. Primarily set at San
Francisco's Winterland on
Thanksgiving 1976, the movie
chronicles the last public per
formance of the Band, the
Woodstock-based group of
16-year road veterans, and
their "friends": a panoply of
stars whose performances
serve as much to prove the
Band's excellence as backup
musicians as to pay last re
spects to the unique brand of
honkytonk/gypsy lifestyle em

bodied by their hosts. "Friends
of" of the Band appearing in
"Waltz" include Neil Young,
Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters,
Neil Diamond, Emmylou Harris
and Bob Dylan.
Wayward
It is this wayward, almost
"Travels With Charlie" exis
tence Scorsese wants to em
phasize: to this end he in
terspaces with the concert
footage various backstage "in
terviews," in which individual
band members recall incidents
from their life on the road. Ex
cept for the presence of Scor

cese as interviewer, the anec
dotes are expertly spliced to
point up their — and the
storyteller's — authenticity. A
story about harmonica player
Sonny Boy Williamson gives
way to concert footage of Paul
Butterfield grinding out "Mys
tery Train"; Levon Helm's diat
ribe on Memphis music leads
into Muddy Waters belting the
classic "Mannish Boy"; Robbie
Robertson recalls the New
York songwriterdays, followed
by Neil Diamond footage. (His
inclusion in the movie can only
be attributed to his association
with the Band in those days.
Otherwise he is very much out
of place.)
Voyeur
The cinematography, as
could be expected from Scor
sese ("New York, New York,"
"Taxi Driver") is flawless, and
is the prime reason why the
film stands head and shoulders
above anything ever done
about rock music. Viewer be
comes voyeur: we see Robbie
Robertson battling his guitar,
yanking every sqwak with a
fierceness belying his offstage
manner. We see Joni Mitchell,
in her stunning "Coyote,"
flash her eyes in a "come hither
. . . oooh you wouldn't" look.
It is precisely that cinematic
expertise, however, which
raises the primary questions
about the film's — and the
event's — flaws. Everything we
see, every camera shot, zoom,

and angle, is so well-timed that
one wonders which came first:
the movie or the concert? Like
any good show, the event had
to be rehearsed; at the same
time, Scorsese must have mi
nutely planned every move. In
one sense, f hen, the event was
staged for the cameras — the
one medium directly influ
enced the other, presumably
more important one. There
fore, we end up not with an
objective examination of a
music performance, but with a
subjective look at an inter
media dalliance.
Staginess
All of this is underscored by
the occasional use of the
sound stage footage (in which
The Band performs a speeded
up version of "The Weight,"
accompanied by the Staple
Singers, and "Evangeline" with
Emmylou Harris). Soft lighting
and dry ice fog accentuate the
irritating staginess of these
scenes in particular, and — to a
lesser degree — of the entire
film. But the filmmakers
acknowledge and validate the
seeming phoniness when, at
the end of "Evangeline" an
overhead shot expands to re
veal other cameras, techni
cians approaching the stage,
and band members doffing
quitars and lighting cigarettes:
just like in "real life," hard real
ity encroaches on surreal
space.
These and other minor
grievances (again, Scorsese's
insistance on capturing his in
adequacies as an inteviewer on
film are the worst); disappear
in the face of the movie's awe
inspiring moments: The Band
singing "The Night. . with
conviction and intensity that
puts )oan Baez to shame; Rick
Danko, framed by a single
spotlight, wrenching out
Stage Fright"; Dylan's poignant
commentary, "Forever
Young"; the ensemble chorus
of "I Shall Be Released," the
group of friends united one
last time for the love of music
that has been their — and our
— lives for so long.
Tacky finish
Sadly, the film ends with a
horribly tacky shot of the Band
in the soundstage, playing the
insipid "Last Waltz Suite," a
closing which threatens to de
stroy the ambiguous
immediacy/immortality of the
Robbie Robertson's final
comment: "The road, itcan kill
you. It sure can."
But for its weakneseses,
"The Last Waltz" stands as a
potent capitulization of an
era's end, a testimony to the
powers of music, friends, and
life on the road. Finally, it's
some of the best music you'll
ever hear.
