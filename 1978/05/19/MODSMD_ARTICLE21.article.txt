THE GREEK TYCOON
Fine Arts
In 1976, "Once is Not
Enough" was released. Last
year brought us "The Other
Side of Midnight." This year,
"The Greek Tycoon" joins
these instantly forgettable
soap opera movies which
celebrate the vapidness of the
rich and of moviemakers.
The film details the "inside
story" of the Aristotle
Onassis-lackie Kennedy mar
riage. Like its innumerable
predecessors, this tripe will
probably make a lot of
money, confirming the belief
in Hollywood that glossy gar
bage pays.

CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE
THIRD KIND *****
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
Steven Spielberg's wonder
fully childlike fantasy about
man's first meeting with ex
traterrestial beings. Spielberg
is clearly indebted to Hitch
cock, but in. all the right
ways, and he has the youthful
exuberance that Hitchcock
lost about four decades ago.
The unfortunate thing about
"Close Encounters" is that it
came so soon after "Star
Wars," a situation which pro

vokes unnecessary and mis
leading comparisons bet
ween the two.

THE SOUND OF MUSIC
****
Sunday night, Mem Aud
A wonderful movie, and
good for you. Swell singing,
and lots of Nazis. Wonderful
performances by Julie An
drews and Christopher
Plummer, plus several million
adorable small children. Fun,
fun, fun. Whoopee.
—John Nielsen
COMING HOME ****
Regency 11, San Francisco
Set in 1968, "Coming
Home" is a drama about
people at home dealing with
the Vietnam War. One of its
major characters is unde
fined, and it occasionally suf
fers from poor transition, but
the movie more than makes
up for these deficiencies with
its understanding of the look
and feel of the time, lane
Fonda and |on Voight (as a
paraplegic) are excellent; and
Hal Ashby's direction is fine
throughout.

FAREWELL, MY LOVELY ***
Tonight, Kresge
Robert Mitchum and Char
lotte Rampling are excellent
in this too-studied adaption of
the Raymond Chandler novel.
Dick Richards, the director,
fails to balance the film's
somber mood with the feeling
of excitement necessary for a
film like this to be most effec
tive. But Mitchum's superb
performance as detective
Philip Marlowe keeps the
movie interesting through
out. I . njoyed Mitchum's
tired, cynical, wonderfully
human Marlowe almost as
much as Bogart's hardboiled
Marlowe of "The Big Sleep."

THE THREE MUSKETEERS
****
Saturday night, Cubberley
A fine entertainment, di
rected with zest and high style
by Richard Lester. This tale of
Gallic derring-do is carried off
with an air of general good
spirits and unpretentious
ness. Theall-starcastincludes
Faye Dunaway, Raquel
Welch, Oliver Reed, and
Michael York.

AN UNMARRIED WOMAN
Old Mill
Paul Mazursky's ("Harry and
Tonto") warm and intelli
gent look at 70s divorce. Jill
Clayburgh finally gets a role
which is equal to her talent, and
she doesn't disappoint. The
supporting cast is solid, with
Alan Bates standing out. The
film is a bit slow in its middle
third, but is generally strong
and honest. Comic without
being cruel, touching without
being saccharine.
—R.L.
THE FURY * ★
Palo Alto Square
An empty style piece. Director
Brian DePalma gets great sequ
ences, but he has no vision in
this mess about a telekinetic
boy and girl. Nothing con
nects; the script is terrible and
the characterization is worse.
The film is too serious for satire,
but the climax.has all the ele
ments of classic parody ()ohn
Cassavetes literally gets
blownup; we see his frag
mented body from about six
different angles. The scene
must be the ultimate in camp
horror.) R.L.
