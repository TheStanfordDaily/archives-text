## Tracksters set for Pacific-8s 
### Ivan Maisel 
The Pacific-8 Track and Field
Championships, which start
today on the campus of Ore
gon State at Corvallis, will see a
Stanford team that is "at its
peak and tough," according to
track coach Payton Jordan.
"We're thin in numbers but
consistent in producing per
formances. We're tougher be
cause of that thinness, too,"
said Jordan.
"Tom O'Neil was scheduled
to run the three-mile, but he's
having knee trouble and we
decided he should not make
the trip. Chuck Weidmann
qualified in the hammer, but
he's been having trouble in
practice, and we agreed he just
wasn't ready," said Jordan.
The rest of the team looks
good. "Our men have a ten
dency to do well in champion
ship experience," said Jordan.
"Seniors such as James Lofton
and Alan Sheats have been
there many times before and
can provide the leadership.
The sophs and juniors know
what to expect, and this year's
treshman class is the toughest
I've had in years."
Jordan expects big perfor

mances from the relay teams
and the hurdlers. "We rank in
the top three in the 400 meter
relay. USC is the only team we
can't run over. In the 1600 relay
we can run with anyone."
"Our hurdlers have been
doing extremely well in prac
tice. Ken Margerum (110 HH)
has broken his personal record
and gotten his pep back, and
Tom Shellworth's back in form
forthe4oo intermediates," said
Jordan.
Stanford is sending onlyfour
men in the field events, but
Jordan feels all will be scorers.
(Scoring in the Pac-8 meet will
be done on a 10 - 8-6-4-2-1
basis.) "In the long jump Lof
ton and Darrin Nelson may
place one-two. I also expect
discus man Rick Buss and
hammer thrower Dave Thom
son to place well."
Jordan has the team peaked.
"We've undertrained the last
two days to allow the bodies to
recover," he said. He is, how
ever, realistic in his goals. "We
are in the battle for the second
division. We're going to fight
forfifth place, and if everything
goes right, we'll get it."
