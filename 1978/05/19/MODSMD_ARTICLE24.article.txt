# Kissin: running distance for the fun of it
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
The distance runner — run
ning, running, rain or shine,
step after step, mile after mile.
It's you out there alone, run
ning, step after step, quietly. A
car approaches and passes into
the night, and you're still
there, running.
The distance runner — re
served, thoughtful, yet proud,
almost egotistical. Proud in
knowing he can do what few
fellow men can do — simply
run and run, and nothing else.
Roy Kissin fits the mold of
the distance runner, but don't
let him hear you say that. The
junior from Danville is another
in a long line of excellent Stan
ford runners of the '70s, from
Duncan Mac Donald, through
Don Kardong and Tony San
doval, and now, Roy Kissin.
Track coach Payton Jordan

calls him "consistent. He's a
tough, steady competitor."
Steady — a word that means
more in distance running than
in any other event. Steady
means running no matter how
worked up you are, how in
tense you get.
"You train your body, put it
out on the track, and it goes,"
said Kissin. "When I look at the
guys coming in from high
school, I can see what I was
like. You have done well all
your life, and suddenly you're
faced with more pressure, a
more serious level of competi
tion."
Kissin didn't always cope so
well. Jordan said he used to
"let his head get in the way of
his body." Kissin admits that he
has tried to remove himself
from his running, and has done
so almost to the point <?f

fatalism.
"I used to have a lot more
feelings tied up in running —
running is only important to
you, and maybe your coach
and the people close to you.
"I just try to run as best as I'm
capable. I don't think about
how I'm going to fare against
others, only how I'm going to
fare with myself. I'm going to
run how I'm going to run. For
so long, I was competing; now
I worry about me."
Whether intent on compet
ing or not, Kissin is entered in
the 5000 and 10,000 meter runs
this weekend at the Pacific-8
championships in Corvallis,
Oregon. His time in the 10,000
is the second best time in the
conference, although Jordan
says he will be ranked third or
fourth come race time.
Actually, Jordan plays the
role of overseer when it comes
to training Kissin. The real
coaching is done by cross
country coach Marshall Clark.
Kissin and Clark's relationship
is, according to Jordan, "an ex
cellent personal relationship."

Kissin said that Clark's best
asset is that he helps his run
ners to become self-reliant.
"Anyone can write a good
workout. The best thing a
coach can do for an athlete is
teach him to do things for him
self and for what he needs."
"Coach Clark has always
been tolerant and tough. He's
always willing to try new
things, which gives two inputs
instead of one. The give-and
take is very healthy."
Only in distances would a
junior in college still be tabbed
as having a "bright future."
Many distance men don't iiit
their peak until their mid
twenties. Kissin acknowledges
that he will be marathoning in
the future.
"I expect to become a
marathoner. All Stanford guys
move up in their distances as
time goes on." But Kissin has
no special goals.
"I used to think in terms of
the Olympics and such, but I
don't project ahead anymore."
The tidal wave of interest in
running brought on by the

overnight appeal of the sport
has intrigued Kissin.
"Now when I run, I get a lot
more respect. In high school, I
got hit in the face by an ice
cream sandwich thrown from a
passing car. It was discourag
ing. Now that everyone's run
ning, people are more consid
erate.
"The* running trend fasci
nates me. I've been running
eight or nine years — I can't
remember exactly — and I al
ways liked to think of myself as
different — everyone does.
Now everyone's running."
Kissin is different from
everyone. Different because
the most running most of us do
is from home to first in the IM
softball game. But, Kissin calls
it "as natural as brushing my
teeth. It's a force of habit. I'd
feel funny if I hadn't run to
day."
Kissin is reluctant to call him
self a running junkie. "People
try to make more of it than it
really is. I enjoy the competi
tion. It's fun — nothing more
than that."
