Women's waterpolo has fi
nally reached Stanford and has
had an active season of games
and tournaments. Created last
March by a group of women
interested in playing waterpolo
for fun, the numbers grew to
such an extent that they were
able to attend various intercol
legiate tournaments last
spring.
The results of the games . . .
a few victories and numerous
"good experiences," and the
experience has paid off. This
year the group has added to its
numbers, becoming an official
club sport, and though the

time commitment is consider
able, the victories are reward
ing.
This year Stanford hosted
the first Stanford Invitational
Women's Waterpolo Tourna
ment in which they placed sec
ond, losing to UC-Santa Bar
bara in the finals. Two weeks
ago the team placed fifth at the
Aztec Tournament in San
Diego, known to be the largest
regional tournament, defeat
ing the UC-Santa Barbara"B"
team and Arizona State Univer
sity. In a series of games
throughout the season, Stan
ford has defeated Hayward
State, Chico State, Marin, Ber

keley and Los Altos High
School.
Last weekend the poloists re
turned from the annual Chico
Invitational Tournament with a
third place trophy, losing to
the UC-Santa Barbara "A" team
and UC-Davis. The games
were highlighted by a high
scoring performance from
Laurie Foster, who scored 15
goals in five games, followed
by Wendy Seamans (7), Nori
Cerardo (5), Janice Axebu (4),
Jacqueline Heslop (3), and
Francis French (3). Goalie
Nancy Patterson kept up a
strong defense in the cage with
numerous outstanding saves.
Final scores were: Stanford
12, UC-Berkeley7; Stanford 2,
UC-Santa Barbara "A" team 6;
Stanford 12, UC-Berkeley 2;
Stanford 9, Chico State 6, and
Stanford 4, UC-Davis 7. All
tournament team trophies
were awarded to Nori Gerardo
and Wendy Seamans for their
strong performances. Russ De
siderio, team coach, and Brian
Roux coached poolside
throughout the tournament.
The team has two more sea
son games and will be perform
ing an exhibition game for the
