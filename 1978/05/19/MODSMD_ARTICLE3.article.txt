# Undergrad dean OK needed for SWOPSI, SCIRE events
## 
### Michelle Vaughen 
The Faculty Senatevoted yesterday
to recertify Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI)
and the Student Center for Innova
tion and Research in Education
(SCIRE) for another three years, but
under revised "charges," the
guidelines under which they oper
ate.
As recommended by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies (C
-US), the senate voted to require
SWOPSI and SCIRE to obtain final
approval from the Dean of Under
graduate Studies for non-accredited
activities as well as accredited work
shops.
Prior to this revision, no procedure
for dealing with non-accredited ac
tivities such as public events, films
and lectures was included in the
charges. These activities were under
the sole jurisdiction of the policy
boards of each of the organizations.
SWOPSI has been objecting to the
charge revision since the issue first
surfaced at the March 8 C-US meet
ing, SWOPSI Co-Director Chris Col
eman said.
"We don't think the dean (of un
dergraduate studies) should have
jurisdiction over non-accredited ac
tivities," Coleman said. "We have an
elaborate (public events planning)
process with a variety of input from
students, faculty and community. No
single individual should have the
power to cut off an event.
"There's a representative from the
dean's office that sits on the (policy)
board as an ex-officio member, and
we think this is plenty of input," he
said.

C-US member and Classics Prof.
Marsh McCall said the issue is one of
accountability. "Virtually everything
in the University is accountable to
something else," he said.
"What's being argued for is a
harmless, well-run, but strange little
anomaly in an entire system in which
everyone has to be accountable to a
higher authority, leading up
pyramid-style eventually to the
Board of Trustees," he said.
According to Robert Helliwell,
electrical engineering professor and
C-US member, tighter accountability
will "help protect the program."
"If you have a program that's sus
ceptible to criticism, although it
(SWOPSI) hasn't been recently as far
as I know, you want to protect it with
appropriate administrative
safeguards," he said.
Such accountability is viewed as a
loss of flexibility by June Cooper
man, chairperson of the SWOPSI Pol
icy Board.
"The program loses some of its
flexibility and responsiveness to the
community by adding another
bureaucratic layer and becoming
more incorporated into the adminis
trative structure," she said.
Cooperman also said there was
concern that if an event were vetoed
by the dean and then approved
through the appeal process, there
might not be enough time to or
ganize and publicize the event be
fore it was scheduled to occur.
If the dean disagrees with the pol
icy board, the revised charge now
states that he must "notify the board
within 24 hours." The matter would
then be brought before C-US,

"which shall resolve the disagree
ment as rapidly as possible, prefera
bly within 24 hours of being
notified.''
The policy board is "protected
from the possibility that the dean
would not respond fast enough and
let the event come â€¢and go, thereby
blocking it," Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Herant Katchadourian said.
C-US student member Pat Flinn
said the revised charge insures that
"the arbitration process be dealt with
relatively swiftly."
Flinn said he didn't think the revi
sion would represent "any real*
change in terms of the way SWOPSI
will operate. The important issue is
what this represents symbolically in
terms of the relationship between
the extradepartmental programs and
the University," he said.
"Having C-US as an arbitrator in
corporates the SWOPSI Policy Board
under the umbrella of the University

structure. In effect, it is saying that
SWOPSI, in the final analysis, is sub
ject to the administration," Flinn
said. .
Katchadourian said he doesn't an
ticipate any changes resulting from
the charge revision, "as long as I'm
dean.
"The dean has had the capacity to
approve or disapprove their (SWOP
SI's) accredited activities, and it has
not been used at all during the time
I'ye been dean," he said.
The revised charge will take effect
Jan. 1, 1979.
