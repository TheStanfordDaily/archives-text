# Stanford's role educational
## Lyman discusses University 
### Kevin Cox 
The University's educational and
research activities are more impor
tant than providing services for sur
rounding communities, President
Richard Lyman told businessmen
yesterday at a luncheon of Oppor
tunities Industrialization Center
West.
"Society as a whole is farther
ahead if the University is able to
focus as many of its resources as pos
sible upon teaching and research,"
Lyman said.
Stanford is not a profit-making
commerical enterprise that can
freely donate its resources to worthy
causes, he said. "Neighbors ask to
audit classes, to use our auditoria for
benefit performances, to hold group
picnics on our land, or to check out
books at the library.
"But we cannot charge our stu
dents $4700 in tuition ayearand then
fill their classrooms, libraries and re
creation fields with all those who
wish to use them."
However, Lyman said that Stanford
has been "quite responsive to area
concerns," and cited the Medical
Center, the museum, art gallery, af
firmative action programs, student
interns and community volunteers as
beneficial to surrounding com
munities.
Business community
Research contracts granted to the
University from the federal govern
ment have also developed a business
community in the area, said Lyman.
Eight hundred technology com
panies are a direct result of those
grants.
Those firms, as well as the lease of
800 acres of land owned by the Uni
versity, create revenue for surround
ing communities, Lyman said. The
leased land created $14.7 million of
revenues. University purchases ac
count for $80 million, 79 per cent
from Bay Area firms, he added.
But the University also makes sig
nificant contributions to local com
munities by what it doesn't do, ac
cording to Lyman.
Minimal burden
"Stanford is a private, self
sufficient institution that is a minimal
burden to its neighbors," said Ly
man. He said the University, not the
local taxpayer, pays for its own fire,
police and maintenance services.
Also, by developing only one-third

of its 8800 acres, Stanford is perform
ing a public service, Lyman said.
"Those rolling hills and open fields
represent a priceless asset to both
Stanford and the Midpeninsula," he
said.
But the University's decision not to
develop its land is being taken advan
tage of by the community, Lyman
said.
Not land bank
"Stanford is not a land bank that
can be used to meet area needs for
parks, golf, courses or housing," he
said. "Our neighbors roundly
applauded that decision (in 1974) to
preserve open space and hold down
traffic congestion. We must ask them
now to respect that decision by not
proposing their own uses now."
Lyman said that he is "disap
pointed" in thecommunity'sattitude
toward the University.
"Indeed, if I had one main disap-

pointment to express, it would be
that much of what the University
does is taken for granted," Lyman
said.
Without University
"Probably the best way to assess
the overall impact of Stanford upon
this area is to imagine the Midpenin
sula without the University," he said.
"We could now find the Stanford
campus covered, or being covered,
by cities and towns similar to those
that now surround the University."
On the basis of two studies, Lyman
said that from 66,000 to 92,000
people would be living in cities on
University lands.
Instead, he said, there are major
achievements in medicine and sci
ence that can "benefit millions of
people.
"There are not very many places in
the world where such a body of ta
lent may be found," Lyman said.

police and maintenance services.
Also, by developing only one-third

of its 8800 acres, Stanford is perform
ing a public service, Lyman said.
"Those rolling hills and open fields
represent a priceless asset to both
Stanford and the Midpeninsula," he
said.
But the University's decision not to
develop its land is being taken advan
tage of by the community, Lyman
said.
Not land bank
"Stanford is not a land bank that
can be used to meet area needs for
parks, golf, courses or housing," he
said. "Our neighbors roundly
applauded that decision (in 1974) to
preserve open space and hold down
traffic congestion. We must ask them
now to respect that decision by not
proposing their own uses now."
Lyman said that he is "disap
pointed" in thecommunity'sattitude
toward the University.
"Indeed, if I had one main disap-

pointment to express, it would be
that much of what the University
does is taken for granted," Lyman
said.
Without University
"Probably the best way to assess
the overall impact of Stanford upon
this area is to imagine the Midpenin
sula without the University," he said.
"We could now find the Stanford
campus covered, or being covered,
by cities and towns similar to those
that now surround the University."
On the basis of two studies, Lyman
said that from 66,000 to 92,000
people would be living in cities on
University lands.
Instead, he said, there are major
achievements in medicine and sci
ence that can "benefit millions of
people.
"There are not very many places in
the world where such a body of ta
lent may be found," Lyman said.
The University's educational and
research activities are more impor
tant than providing services for sur
rounding communities, President
Richard Lyman told businessmen
yesterday at a luncheon of Oppor
tunities Industrialization Center
West.
"Society as a whole is farther
ahead if the University is able to
focus as many of its resources as pos
sible upon teaching and research,"
Lyman said.
Stanford is not a profit-making
commerical enterprise that can
freely donate its resources to worthy
causes, he said. "Neighbors ask to
audit classes, to use our auditoria for
benefit performances, to hold group
picnics on our land, or to check out
books at the library.
"But we cannot charge our stu
dents $4700 in tuition ayearand then
fill their classrooms, libraries and re
creation fields with all those who
wish to use them."
However, Lyman said that Stanford
has been "quite responsive to area
concerns," and cited the Medical
Center, the museum, art gallery, af
firmative action programs, student
interns and community volunteers as
beneficial to surrounding com
munities.
Business community
Research contracts granted to the
University from the federal govern
ment have also developed a business
community in the area, said Lyman.
Eight hundred technology com
panies are a direct result of those
grants.
Those firms, as well as the lease of
800 acres of land owned by the Uni
versity, create revenue for surround
ing communities, Lyman said. The
leased land created $14.7 million of
revenues. University purchases ac
count for $80 million, 79 per cent
from Bay Area firms, he added.
But the University also makes sig
nificant contributions to local com
munities by what it doesn't do, ac
cording to Lyman.
Minimal burden
"Stanford is a private, self
sufficient institution that is a minimal
burden to its neighbors," said Ly
man. He said the University, not the
local taxpayer, pays for its own fire,
police and maintenance services.
Also, by developing only one-third

of its 8800 acres, Stanford is perform
ing a public service, Lyman said.
"Those rolling hills and open fields
represent a priceless asset to both
Stanford and the Midpeninsula," he
said.
