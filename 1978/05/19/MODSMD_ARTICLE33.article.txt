U.S. aid to S. Korea not yet cut off
Washington — House leaders were blocked yesterday
from rushing approval of a resolution threatening to cut
off U.S. aid to South Korea until it allows questioning of a
former ambassador accused of influence buying in Con
gress.
Special counsel Leon Jaworski had asked for approval
of the resolution in an effort to counteract House rejec
tion last week of a non-binding proposal to reduce U.S.
aid to South Korea.
But House leaders withdrew the resolution after Rep.
Robert Bauman (R-Md.), saying proponents were mov
ing too hastily, served notice he would force a delay if
necessary to give lawmakers more time to study it.
Extension of ERA deadline debated
Washington — Leaders in the fight over the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) argued yesterday over the
legal and ethical questions surrounding congressional
proposals to extend the deadline for ratification by
seven years.
Phyllis Schlafly, chairman of STOP ERA, said an exten
sion beyond the current deadline of March 22, 1979,
"would be an unfair attempt to tamper with the United
States Constitution."
Eleanor Smeal, president of the National Organization
of Women, said refusal to extend the deadline risks
"setting back the clock on women's rights."
Both women testified before a House judiciary sub
committee considering a resolution to double the
seven-year ratification period prescribed by Congress in
1972 when it adopted ERA. A similar resolution has been
sponsored in the Senate.
Conservatives fight limitation pact
Washington — A leading conservative organization,
undaunted by its failure to defeat the Panama Canal
treaties, announced plans yesterday to wage an even
greater offensive against the arms limitation pact being
negotiated with the Soviet Union.
The American Conservative Union (ACU), which
spent $1.4 million in its futile battle against Senate ratifi
cation of the Panama accords, said it will produce a
30-minute film critical of the Carter administration's pol
icy on the strategic arms limitation treaty (SALT).
Rep. Philip Crane (R-lll), chairman of the ACU, said the
film will be ready for showing in July and will be "our
opening effort to defeat SALT."
LA gets chance to host '84 Olympics
Los Angeles — Los Angeles was given the chance yes
terday to host the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, but the
city will take them only if it can assure its taxpayers they
won't be saddled with the financial problems of past
Olympics.
In a decision that capped months of public and private
maneuvering, the International Olympic Committee
(IOC) awarded the Summer Games to Los Angeles with
the provision that the city assume full financial respon
sibility forstagingthem, including absorbingany losses.
lOC members, meeting in Athens, gave Los Angeles
officials until July 31 to sign such a commitment and

made it plain the welcome mat would be extended to
other cities if they did not. Montreal, Munich and
Mexico City — hosts of the last three Olympics — repor
tedly are interested, as is New York, which lost out to Los
Angeles as the U.S. candidate.
Tax critic Jarvis endorses Davis
Sacramento — Former Los Angeles police chief Ed
Davis received an expected endorsement yesterday
from tax critic Howard )arvis in the campaign for the
Republican nomination for governor.
Earlier in the day, Davis received less positive news
when a Mervin Field poll contradicted his claim that he
had overtaken Attorney General Evelle Younger in the
four-way campaign in the june 6 Republican primary.
Jarvis said a Davis victory is needed to make Proposi
tion 13, the $7 billion property tax cut initiative which
jarvis authored, really work if voters approve it on June
6.
Court rules against alien children
Houston — The 296 illegal alien children attending
makeshift classes in a Baptist church basement in a
Mexican-American barrio hoped they might be able to
go to public schools next year.
But that possibility appears ruled out by a Texas Sup
reme Court decision Wednesday which held that such
children have no constitutional right to free public
schooling.
Under a 1975 amendment to a state education finance
bill, only U.S. citizens and legally resident aliens are
entitled to tuition-free education in Texas public
schools. Schools that do not comply could face loss of
state funds.
In Houston, the estimated 5000 illegal alien children
can attend public schools by paying $90 tuition a month,
but most of their parents say they cannot afford that
amount. Officials of the Houston Independent School
District contend it would cost an additional $8.3 million a
year to admit the children.
Dow Jones down 7.45
New York — Pushed by the dollar's drop in value in
foreign-exchange trading, stock prices nosedived yes
terday, snapping a winning streak that stretched over
the past six sessions.
Prices also were depressed because many investors
wanted to sell issues that had risen in value in the past
several days.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial blue chips
closed down 7.45 at 850.92 in heavy trading on the New
York Stock Exchange. Nearly twice as many issues fell as
rose.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except patchy fog near the
ocean beginning tonight. Cooler tomorrow. Lows both
nights in the 50s. Highs today in the mid 60s to mid 70s
near the beaches and in the 80s to low 90s inland and
tomorrow in the 60s to low 80s. Westerly winds to 20
mph in afternoons.

from rushing approval of a resolution threatening to cut
off U.S. aid to South Korea until it allows questioning of a
former ambassador accused of influence buying in Con
gress.
Special counsel Leon Jaworski had asked for approval
of the resolution in an effort to counteract House rejec
tion last week of a non-binding proposal to reduce U.S.
aid to South Korea.
But House leaders withdrew the resolution after Rep.
Robert Bauman (R-Md.), saying proponents were mov
ing too hastily, served notice he would force a delay if
necessary to give lawmakers more time to study it.
Extension of ERA deadline debated
Washington — Leaders in the fight over the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) argued yesterday over the
legal and ethical questions surrounding congressional
proposals to extend the deadline for ratification by
seven years.
Phyllis Schlafly, chairman of STOP ERA, said an exten
sion beyond the current deadline of March 22, 1979,
"would be an unfair attempt to tamper with the United
States Constitution."
Eleanor Smeal, president of the National Organization
of Women, said refusal to extend the deadline risks
"setting back the clock on women's rights."
Both women testified before a House judiciary sub
committee considering a resolution to double the
seven-year ratification period prescribed by Congress in
1972 when it adopted ERA. A similar resolution has been
sponsored in the Senate.
Conservatives fight limitation pact
Washington — A leading conservative organization,
undaunted by its failure to defeat the Panama Canal
treaties, announced plans yesterday to wage an even
greater offensive against the arms limitation pact being
negotiated with the Soviet Union.
The American Conservative Union (ACU), which
spent $1.4 million in its futile battle against Senate ratifi
cation of the Panama accords, said it will produce a
30-minute film critical of the Carter administration's pol
icy on the strategic arms limitation treaty (SALT).
Rep. Philip Crane (R-lll), chairman of the ACU, said the
film will be ready for showing in July and will be "our
opening effort to defeat SALT."
LA gets chance to host '84 Olympics
Los Angeles — Los Angeles was given the chance yes
terday to host the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, but the
city will take them only if it can assure its taxpayers they
won't be saddled with the financial problems of past
Olympics.
In a decision that capped months of public and private
maneuvering, the International Olympic Committee
(IOC) awarded the Summer Games to Los Angeles with
the provision that the city assume full financial respon
sibility forstagingthem, including absorbingany losses.
lOC members, meeting in Athens, gave Los Angeles
officials until July 31 to sign such a commitment and

made it plain the welcome mat would be extended to
other cities if they did not. Montreal, Munich and
Mexico City — hosts of the last three Olympics — repor
tedly are interested, as is New York, which lost out to Los
Angeles as the U.S. candidate.
Tax critic Jarvis endorses Davis
Sacramento — Former Los Angeles police chief Ed
Davis received an expected endorsement yesterday
from tax critic Howard )arvis in the campaign for the
Republican nomination for governor.
Earlier in the day, Davis received less positive news
when a Mervin Field poll contradicted his claim that he
had overtaken Attorney General Evelle Younger in the
four-way campaign in the june 6 Republican primary.
Jarvis said a Davis victory is needed to make Proposi
tion 13, the $7 billion property tax cut initiative which
jarvis authored, really work if voters approve it on June
6.
Court rules against alien children
Houston — The 296 illegal alien children attending
makeshift classes in a Baptist church basement in a
Mexican-American barrio hoped they might be able to
go to public schools next year.
But that possibility appears ruled out by a Texas Sup
reme Court decision Wednesday which held that such
children have no constitutional right to free public
schooling.
Under a 1975 amendment to a state education finance
bill, only U.S. citizens and legally resident aliens are
entitled to tuition-free education in Texas public
schools. Schools that do not comply could face loss of
state funds.
In Houston, the estimated 5000 illegal alien children
can attend public schools by paying $90 tuition a month,
but most of their parents say they cannot afford that
amount. Officials of the Houston Independent School
District contend it would cost an additional $8.3 million a
year to admit the children.
Dow Jones down 7.45
New York — Pushed by the dollar's drop in value in
foreign-exchange trading, stock prices nosedived yes
terday, snapping a winning streak that stretched over
the past six sessions.
Prices also were depressed because many investors
wanted to sell issues that had risen in value in the past
several days.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial blue chips
closed down 7.45 at 850.92 in heavy trading on the New
York Stock Exchange. Nearly twice as many issues fell as
rose.
