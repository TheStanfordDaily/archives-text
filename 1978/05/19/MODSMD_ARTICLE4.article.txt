# Pilot program suggested for Western Culture plan
## 
### Peter Brett 
The Faculty Senate yesterday in
formally voted to institute a pilot
program to develop a limited
number of course sequences which
may satisfy a Western Culture re
quirement.
The votes only represent a pre
liminary opinion, and a final vote will
be taken within the next few weeks.
Yesterday's votes were taken "to
clear the air" on the issue, according
to Geology Prof. Tjeerd van Andel.
The pilot program will be super
vised by a Western Culture Pilot
Program Committee. This committee
will report to the senate after two
years on the academic quality of the
pilot courses which have been de

veloped and the financial feasibility
of the requirement. At this time, the
senate will vote on whether to im
pose a requirement in Western Cul
ture.
Provost William Miller also pre
sented rough estimates of the finan
cial feasibility of two models of the
Western Culture Requirement.
The preferred model of the West
ern Culture Task Force would cost
the University about $628,000 a year,
according to Miller. The calculations
estimate that about 1600 students will
be enrolled in three, four or five unit
courses in Western Culture each
year. About 80 sections would thus
be needed each quarter, utilizing 25
faculty members and 28 fellows.
"This model is too costly for us. I
really do believe that's out of reach
for this institution," Miller said.'
He said $628,000 is equal to two
thirds of the budget of the history
department or the entire budget of
the art department.
On the other hand, the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies (C-US)
model would only cost about
$208,000 each year. This model in
cludes 400 students enrolled in a
modified history sequence, 250 in a
modified humanities sequence, 50 in
the Structured Liberal Education
program, 500 in two other de
partmental sequences, and there

maining 400 in the preferred model
course. Only five faculty members
and eight fellows would be needed
to teach the preferred model in this
case.
"This kind of incremental money is
feasible," Miller said.
Some faculty members said they
felt the curriculum should be de
cided by individual professors rather
than the Faculty Senate. Humanities
Prof. William Clebsch said, "I'm
completely convinced that cur
riculum devised on high always falls
apart down below."
English Prof. Ronald Re
bholz, however, said he did not think
that the faculty would be sufficiently
inspired to develop the courses on
their own.
Some faculty members were con
cerned with how the courses were to
be evaluated at the end of the two
year pilot program. Education As
sociate Prof. Denis Phillips said,
"whenever curriculum innovation is
made, it isn't easy to detect change.
It will make it very hard to decide in
the future."
President Richard Lyman, how
ever, said "if we don't make the ef
fort, we're never going to know the
answer to the question."
The senate also passed a resolu
tion setting up a joint major in
philosophy and religious studies.
