Kolwezi, Zaire (AP) — Belgian
paratroopers and French comman
dos flew to Zaire yesterday to mount
a joint Western rescue mission foran
estimated 2500 foreigners, including
14 Americans, isolated and
threatened by the rebel invasion of
Shaba Province.
Plane after plane packed with
crack airborne troops took off from
Brussels' military airport yesterday
afternoon on the 5000-mile journey
to this central African nation, a
former Belgian colony. The flight by
the U.S.-made C-130 transports was
expected to take at least 10 hours.
An estimated 1750 paratroops and
other Belgian military personnel had
been alerted to take part in the inter
continental operation.
The French government con
firmed last night it also has sent
troops to help evacuate Europeans in
Zaire. Defense Minister Yvon
Bourges told the National Assembly
France would not take part in fight
ing, but would act to assure safety of
French citizens. *
Official sources said several
hundred commandos of the French
Foreign Legion left their base in Cor
sica last night for Africa in four char
tered jetliners.
In Washington, a State Depart
ment official who asked not to be
identified said the United States
would not supply troops or planes
for the mission but might provide
some lesser logistical support. About
1500 U.S. Army airborne soldiers re
mained on alert at Fort Bragg, N.C.,
however.
The British also were involved in
the planning for the rescue effort,
but it was not known what role they
might play.

Belgian officials reported receiving
a single radio report from the battle
area saying only: "Thete is no more
fighting in Kolwezi."
Kolwezi, a copper-mining town at
the center of the rebel-held area of
southern Zaire, is where most of the
2500 foreigners have been stranded
since the invasion last Friday.
A Belgian Foreign Ministry
spokesman said the broadcast could
not be reconfirmed. It was not
known whether it meant that either
the rebels or government troops had

withdrawn, or that a truce had been
arranged.
The-Belgian paratroopers were re
ported headed for Kinshasa and then
on to the government-held air base
at Kamina, 130 miles north of Kol
wezi.
The last battle report by the pro-
West Zaire government claimed its
forces had recaptured Kolwezi's air
port Wednesday. The rebels said
they still held the town and the area
around it for nine miles in all direc
tions.
