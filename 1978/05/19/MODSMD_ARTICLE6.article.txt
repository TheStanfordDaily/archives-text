Moscow (AP) — A Soviet court yes
terday sentenced dissident physicist
Yuri Orlov to 12 years' loss of free
dom and police briefly detained
Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei
Sakharov with his wife after they hit
officers who barred them from the
courthouse.
Sakharov, also a physicist, is the
most prominent Russian dissident.
Orlov's was the first of an expected
round of trials of Moscow dissenters,
with the apparent aim of putting
down organized criticism of the
Soviet government.
In Washington, the House passed
by a 399-0 vote and sent to the Senate
a resolution asking the Soviet Union
to free the 53-year-old Orlov. State
Department spokesman Thomas Re
ston said the U.S. government
"strongly deplores" the action
against Orlov and called it "a gross

distortion of internationally ac
cepted standards of human rights."
British politicians from both left
and right said the sentence was
"shameful" and an "outrage."
Orlov was convicted in a trial that
began Monday of "anti-Soviet agita
tion and propaganda" on the basis of
documents about Soviet human
rights that he wrote and distributed
to Western correspondents and em
bassies.
The official Tass news agency said
the court "bore in mind the public
danger of his crime" in sentencing
Orlov to seven years at hard labor
and five years of internal exile, mean
ing banishment from Moscow. He
has seven days to appeal.
In Paris, L'Humanite, the of.icial
newspaper of the French Communist
Party, said the sentence showed "a
neglect of basic freedoms that could
threaten the future of socialism
throughout the world." The party is
part of the Eurocommunism move
ment and professes independence
from Moscow.
Moscow's evening newspaper
Vechernaya Moskva gave Soviet
readers their first news of the Orlov
trial yesterday, reporting the verdict
and saying spectators "received it
with satisfaction."
During the trial, the newspaper
said, Orlov "acted like a dishonest
gambler caught with a marked card
in his hands."
Orlov's British lawyer John Mac
donald, who was barred from the
trial, said in London that an appeal
was being prepared.
Still awaiting trial but with no date
set are Anatoly Shcharansky and Ale
xander Ginzburg — co-founders
with Orlov of Moscow's "Helsinki"
dissident group formed to monitor
Soviet compliance with human rights
provisions of the 6975 Helsinki ac
cords.
Ginzburg was arrested just before
and Shcharansky just after Orlov,
who was imprisoned Feb. 10, 1977.
All have been held incommunicado.
