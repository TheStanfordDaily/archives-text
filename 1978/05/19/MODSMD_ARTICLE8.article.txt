# Case of Sami Esmail
## Violating human rights 
### 
Nabil Qadumi

In reference to the column
"Clarifying arrest conditions" (Daily,
April 20), Jean Myers could have
saved herself much trouble. She
could have sent the Daily a xeroxed
copy of "The case of Sami Esmail" as
released by the Embassy of Israel in
Washington D.C. in a publication on
March 27, 1978.
Furthermore, Myers does not ad
dress the real issue. The crux of Es
mail's case is that he has committed
no crime on Israeli soil. He is being
tried for political activity, legal in the
U.S., but illegal in Israel. Esmail has
been arrested for exercising, in the
U.S., his basic rights under the First
Amendment.
Esmail has been tortured and
forced to sign confessions under
duress by Israeli Police. State De
partment officials at Washington
D.C. acknowledged receiving U.S.
Consular reports that Esmail has
been mistreated by Israeli Police
(Gannet News service).
No crime committed
The issue being emphasized here
is the human rights issue. Esmail did
notcommitany crimein Israel except
that he wanted to pay his dying father
a last visit. He is being charged with
"membership in an illegal organiza
tion," an offense under section 85,
paragraph 1a of the Defense
(Emergency) Regulation of 1945."
This is the same law which
Menachem Begin is guilty of violat
ing when he was head of the terrorist
Irgun organization during British
rule of Palestine. There is however, a
major difference between the cases
of Esmail and Begin. Begin and his
organization committed the Deir
Yassin massacre in which 254 inno
cent men, women and children were
murdered in April, 1948.
Esmail is in no way guilty of mur
der, much less the murder of inno
cent people. He has spoken out for
Palestinian rights on many occa
sions, but so has President Jimmy
Carter.
The Defense Regulations of 1945
deserve further discussion. They are
a set of laws inherited by the state of
Israel from the British who adopted
them in 1945 to control organiza
tions, both Arab and Jewish, op
posed to British rule. They were
strongly criticized by representatives
of the Jewish community in Pales
tine.
At a conference of the Jewish
Lawyers' Association held in Tel Aviv
in February 1946, the representative
of the Jewish Agency, Dr. Bernard
Joseph, who later became Israel's
Minister of Justice, stated: "With re
gard to the Defense Laws them
selves, the question is: are we ail to
become the victims of officially

licensed terrorism, or will the free
dom of the individual prevail?
No safeguards?
"Is the administration to be al
lowed to interfere in the life of each
individual without any safeguards for
us? There is nothing to prevent a citi
zen from being imprisoned all his life
without trial. There is no safeguard
for the rights of the individual.
"There is no possibility of appeal
against the decision of the Military
Commander, no possibility of resort
to the Supreme Court, and the ad
ministration has unrestricted free
dom to banish any citizen at any
moment." At the same conference,
Ya'acov Shimshan Shapiro, a future
Attorney General of Israel who later
succeeded Joseph as Minister of Jus
tice, stated: "The system established
in Palestine since the issue of the De
fense Laws is unparalleled in any
civilized country; there were no such
laws even in Nazi Germany. . . .
"They try to pacify us by saying that
these laws are only directed against
malefactors, not against honest citi
zens. But the Nazi governor of oc
cupied Oslo also announced that no
harm would come to citizens who
minded their own business.
"It is our duty to tell the whole
world that the Defense Laws passed
by the British Mandatory Govern
ment of Palestine destroy the very
foundations of justice in this land."
Somehow, these people quickly for
got theircriticisms once Israel gained
its independence in 1948, and with a
sudden role reversal they were in the
position of turning these same laws
against the Palestinian Arab minority.
Treatment relatively benign
Furthermore, the Esmail case
brings into focus violations of human
rights of Palestinians in Israel and the
occupied territories which occur on
a daily basis. Amnesty International,
in its 1977 Annual Report, cite Hail
Levi, Israel's Commissioner of pris
ons for the figure of 3227 prisoners
"convicted" of "crimes against the
security of the state" (502 more than
1976, according to Amnesty).
Esmail's treatment has been rela
tively benign as compared to that of
thousands of prisoners who have not
benefited from international pres
sures on their behalf. Last July, the
London Sunday Times charged Is
rael with systematic torture of Pales
tinian prisoners. According to
Newsweek, Feb. 20, 1978: "During
the West Bank riots of 1976, Israeli
troops charged mobs of stone
throwing Arabs with such gusto that
11 Arabs died, including two children
aged 5 and 6.
"Israeli authorities routinely barge
into Palestinian homes seeking sus
pects or incriminating literature. Is-

rael has expelled many Palestinian
leaders from the West Bank, and it
has seized large tracts of Arab land.
Occasionally, interrogators still get
out of hand.
"Last month (January), Khalid Rab
boh, a student at Bir Zeit University,
charged that Israeli police had
beaten him with truncheons and a
thick rope after he refused to admit
taking part in a demonstration. The
beating was witnessed by three
Western teachers, who complained
to the Red Cross."
These cases indicate an increased
level of repression within Israel and
an apparent effort by the Israeli gov
ernment to intimidate those who
participate in activities sympathetic
to the Palestinian people, even out
side Israel.
Everyone is urged to support the
cause of Esmail, and the Palestinian
prisoners, regardless of your politi
cal convictions. Anyone who feels
strongly about the rights of black
people in South Africa and Rhodesia
should feel the same moral obliga
tion towards supporting the basic
rights of all people: and that includes
Sami Esmail and the Palestinian
people.

In reference to the column
"Clarifying arrest conditions" (Daily,
April 20), Jean Myers could have
saved herself much trouble. She
could have sent the Daily a xeroxed
copy of "The case of Sami Esmail" as
released by the Embassy of Israel in
Washington D.C. in a publication on
March 27, 1978.
Furthermore, Myers does not ad
dress the real issue. The crux of Es
mail's case is that he has committed
no crime on Israeli soil. He is being
tried for political activity, legal in the
U.S., but illegal in Israel. Esmail has
been arrested for exercising, in the
U.S., his basic rights under the First
Amendment.
Esmail has been tortured and
forced to sign confessions under
duress by Israeli Police. State De
partment officials at Washington
D.C. acknowledged receiving U.S.
Consular reports that Esmail has
been mistreated by Israeli Police
(Gannet News service).
No crime committed
The issue being emphasized here
is the human rights issue. Esmail did
notcommitany crimein Israel except
that he wanted to pay his dying father
a last visit. He is being charged with
"membership in an illegal organiza
tion," an offense under section 85,
paragraph 1a of the Defense
(Emergency) Regulation of 1945."
This is the same law which
Menachem Begin is guilty of violat
ing when he was head of the terrorist
Irgun organization during British
rule of Palestine. There is however, a
major difference between the cases
of Esmail and Begin. Begin and his
organization committed the Deir
Yassin massacre in which 254 inno
cent men, women and children were
murdered in April, 1948.
Esmail is in no way guilty of mur
der, much less the murder of inno
cent people. He has spoken out for
Palestinian rights on many occa
sions, but so has President Jimmy
Carter.
The Defense Regulations of 1945
deserve further discussion. They are
a set of laws inherited by the state of
Israel from the British who adopted
them in 1945 to control organiza
tions, both Arab and Jewish, op
posed to British rule. They were
strongly criticized by representatives
of the Jewish community in Pales
tine.
At a conference of the Jewish
Lawyers' Association held in Tel Aviv
in February 1946, the representative
of the Jewish Agency, Dr. Bernard
Joseph, who later became Israel's
Minister of Justice, stated: "With re
gard to the Defense Laws them
selves, the question is: are we ail to
become the victims of officially

licensed terrorism, or will the free
dom of the individual prevail?
No safeguards?
"Is the administration to be al
lowed to interfere in the life of each
individual without any safeguards for
us? There is nothing to prevent a citi
zen from being imprisoned all his life
without trial. There is no safeguard
for the rights of the individual.
"There is no possibility of appeal
against the decision of the Military
Commander, no possibility of resort
to the Supreme Court, and the ad
ministration has unrestricted free
dom to banish any citizen at any
moment." At the same conference,
Ya'acov Shimshan Shapiro, a future
Attorney General of Israel who later
succeeded Joseph as Minister of Jus
tice, stated: "The system established
in Palestine since the issue of the De
fense Laws is unparalleled in any
civilized country; there were no such
laws even in Nazi Germany. . . .
"They try to pacify us by saying that
these laws are only directed against
malefactors, not against honest citi
zens. But the Nazi governor of oc
cupied Oslo also announced that no
harm would come to citizens who
minded their own business.
"It is our duty to tell the whole
world that the Defense Laws passed
by the British Mandatory Govern
ment of Palestine destroy the very
foundations of justice in this land."
Somehow, these people quickly for
got theircriticisms once Israel gained
its independence in 1948, and with a
sudden role reversal they were in the
position of turning these same laws
against the Palestinian Arab minority.
Treatment relatively benign
Furthermore, the Esmail case
brings into focus violations of human
rights of Palestinians in Israel and the
occupied territories which occur on
a daily basis. Amnesty International,
in its 1977 Annual Report, cite Hail
Levi, Israel's Commissioner of pris
ons for the figure of 3227 prisoners
"convicted" of "crimes against the
security of the state" (502 more than
1976, according to Amnesty).
Esmail's treatment has been rela
tively benign as compared to that of
thousands of prisoners who have not
benefited from international pres
sures on their behalf. Last July, the
London Sunday Times charged Is
rael with systematic torture of Pales
tinian prisoners. According to
Newsweek, Feb. 20, 1978: "During
the West Bank riots of 1976, Israeli
troops charged mobs of stone
throwing Arabs with such gusto that
11 Arabs died, including two children
aged 5 and 6.
"Israeli authorities routinely barge
into Palestinian homes seeking sus
pects or incriminating literature. Is-

rael has expelled many Palestinian
leaders from the West Bank, and it
has seized large tracts of Arab land.
Occasionally, interrogators still get
out of hand.
"Last month (January), Khalid Rab
boh, a student at Bir Zeit University,
charged that Israeli police had
beaten him with truncheons and a
thick rope after he refused to admit
taking part in a demonstration. The
beating was witnessed by three
Western teachers, who complained
to the Red Cross."
These cases indicate an increased
level of repression within Israel and
an apparent effort by the Israeli gov
ernment to intimidate those who
participate in activities sympathetic
to the Palestinian people, even out
side Israel.
Everyone is urged to support the
cause of Esmail, and the Palestinian
prisoners, regardless of your politi
cal convictions. Anyone who feels
strongly about the rights of black
people in South Africa and Rhodesia
should feel the same moral obliga
tion towards supporting the basic
rights of all people: and that includes
Sami Esmail and the Palestinian
people.
