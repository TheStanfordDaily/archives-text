VISTA/PEACE CORPS
There are lots of ways to see the world.
We'll give you a way to understand it.
You'll understand the world and yourself a whole lot
better after a year or two of experience as a Peace
Corps of VISTA volunteer.
Whether you're a specialist whose wish is to shar
pen your professional skills in engineering, math, the
physical and life sciences, health, business (or a
dozen other areas); or a liberal arts grad eager to
share your talents while acquiring new skills and
insights, the Peace Corps and VISTA will open an
entire new world to you.
You'll not only experience a new culture and learn a
new language, you'll also share in the development
of an emerging nation, or help the poor and power
less in America to gain control over their lives.
Complete information on volunteer openings be
ginning this summer and fall in Africa, Asia, Latin
America, the Pacific, and throughout the U.S. is now
available.
