Kinshasa, Zaire (AP) — French
paratroopers attacked pockets of
rebel resistance in southern Zaire
yesterday and continued the evacua
tion of 2500 whites rescued by French
and Belgian troops in a weekend as
sault on the mining center of Kol
wezi.
Paratroop officers reported at least
100 white foreigners — most of them
French and Belgian — were killed by
the Angola-based rebels who swept
into Kolwezi eight days ago. They
said some 150 Zairean civilians and
government soliders also were slain
and about 200 rebels were killed in
battles with the French and Belgian
airborne units.
"Fighting is over now and both the
French and Belgian paratroops are
controlling Kolwezi town," said an
official at the French Embassy in
neighboring Zambia. "The parat
roops will remain in Kolwezi until
further notice."
A Moroccan transport plane
brought 30 to 50 combat-ready com
mandos into Kinshasa Airport yes
terday. Their commander said they
came to protect the Moroccan Em
bassy in the capital.
1500 Moroccan soldiers
About 1500 Moroccan soldiers
helped the Zaire government crush a
rebel invasion of copper-rich Shaba
Province 14 months ago.
Fifteen U.S. Air Force Starlifterand
Galaxy jet transports continued to
ferry fuel and military supplies bet
ween Kinshasa and Lubumbashi, the
capital of Shaba Province 900 miles
southeast of Kinshasa. Lubumbashi
is 160 miles southeast of Kolwezi and
is not in the battle zone.
American officials here said all but
one of 14 Americans known to have
been in the Kolwezi area have been
rescued. Americans who were
evacuated identified the missing
man as Lonnie Glen, 32, of
Yerington, Nev. He was a security of
ficer for Morrison-Knudsen, an
Idaho construction firm that was
building a power line in Shaba.
In Washington, State Department
spokesman Robert Holliday said 12
of the Americans have been
evacuated, one is known to be still in
Kolwezi and one is missing. Fie gave
no names.
Shot and killed
Harold Amstutz, an American
flown to Brussels yesterday, told re
porters Glen was shot and killed by
rebels Wednesday after he returned
to Kolwezi to pick up his German
born wife and child. That was the day
Morrison-Knudsen ran its own re
scue operation and evacuated more
than 70 Americans from Kolwezi by
truck and helicopter. American
evacuees said they believed Glen's
wife and child were among the
foreigners who were rescued.
Col. Yves Gras, the French military

commander in Kolwezi, said civilian
survivors of the rebel assault "saw
four Cubans and Angolan Por
tuguese among the rebel forces."
Trained by Cubans
Despite repeated Cuban denials,
Western sources said the rebels were
trained at bases in Angola by some of
the estimated 20,000 Cubans who
helped bring a Marxist government
to power in Angola after it received
independence from Portugal in 1975.
The rebels are Lunda tribesmen
driven into exile in Angola when they
sought self-rule for their native
Shaba Province after Zaire gained in
dependence from Belgium in 1960.
Zaire formerly was the Belgian
Congo and Shaba Province was
known as Katanga.
"Cubans have been preparing this
operation for a year. I have this from
official information," Cras told The
Associated Press.
