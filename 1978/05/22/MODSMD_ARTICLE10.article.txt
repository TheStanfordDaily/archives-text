# CIA supports Chilean killings
## American haunted by blind impulses

Dan Shanahan

Recently, the United States de
ported Michael Townley, an
American national living in Chile,
and charged him with conspiracy in
connection with the assassination of
Orlando Letelier, a former member
of Salvador Allende's socialist Chi
lean government.
Letelier was killed in Washington,
D.C. when a remote-controlled
bomb attached to his car was deto
nated as he rode to the institute
where he worked. News releases
have suggested that Cuban exile
groups were at the centcr of the con
spiracy, and three Cubans have been
charged in the murder. But a look at
the undercurrents of Allende's over
throw in the fall of 1973 suggests that
the responsibility for Letelier's death
lies elsewhere.
Letelier's death suggests that
America's cavalier, "secret-agent"
approach to international politics has
become a Frankenstein creation that
has returned to haunt us; as Malcolm
X put it after the assassination of John
Kennedy in Dallas, "The chickens
have come home to roost."
Recently Fernando Flores, another
member of the Allende cabinet and
now a visiting professor at Stanford,
told his class that the coup which
brought the Allende government
down was no surprise to the cabinet
members; military and police activity
during the preceeding weeks
warned them of what was coming.
However, what did surprise Flores
and the other members of Allende's
government was the vicious brutality

with which the military initiated re
prisals against the Marxist party, and
the extent to which assassination and
torture were used by the coup with
out hesitation.
The history of coups in Chile was
such that Allende felt reasonably cer
tain his overthrow would be blood
less and that the opposition would
treat he and his cabinet members
humanely. After all, the members of
the government could hardly expect
barbaric treatment from people they
had grown up and gone to school
with.
Anyone familiar with Chilean soci
ety knows that a power elite does
exist in the country, an elite so small
and ingrown that acquaintance on a
first-name basis among members of
opposing factions is common, if not
the rule; most members of the ruling
class are likely to have known one
another from childhood.
But the average American is not
familiar with this fact, and we fail to
understand the real significance of
the coup's ruthlessness. The situa
tion could be likened to a Stanford
fraternity, twenty years hence, split
ting into two factions on political
grounds, with one faction setting out
to annihilate its fraternity brothers
with no mercy.
Could Chilean culture have fallen
into such an advanced state of decay,
I asked myself when Flores' remark
put the coup into perspective?
It was the memory ot Letelier's as
sassination — and in particular, the
style of his assassination — that made

me recognize that moral decay in
Chile was not the sole cause of the
brutality that followed Allende's
overthrow. For what both Allende's
overthrow and the assassination of
Orlando Letelier have in common —
one directly, and the other indirectly
— is the stamp of the American CIA.
One can imagine two scenarios for
CIA involvement in the 1973 coup.
Either CIA agents were, as was the
case in the overthrow of the Diem
regime in South Vietnam, present in
the coup leaders' headquarters, pul
ling strings, even directing troop and
police movements, and urging brutal
ity upon the coup's members as a
sure means of intimidating popular
opposition.
Or, the tacit approval and support
of the CIA and the American busi
ness community went to the heads of
the coup leaders, allowing them to
rationalize the assassination of close
acquaintances as a fact of political ■
life.
This second possibility is proba
bly more frightening than the first.
For the self-righteousness apparent
among the leaders of the coup —
self-righteousness which allowed
them to murder friends and imprison
and torture thousands for political
beliefs alone — is the same senti
ment that motivated America in Viet
nam, the same sentiment that al
lowed Richard Nixon to be elected
twice, and the same sentiment that
allows a figure like Ronald Reagon to
maintain influence in the political
sphere.
* Blind self-righteousness
The Letelier assassination tells us
that we have transmitted our blind
self-righteousness like a virus to
those around us; at best, the spirit of
the Chilean coup is alive in Ameri
can, at worst it probably originated
here.
I recently had dinner with a Chi
lean couple who were on a business
trip to the United States. I was in
terested — and a little shocked — to
find that, though the husband
worked for an American multi
national firm in Chile and supported
Allende's overthrow completely,
both he and his wife had known Or
lando Letelier well and considered
him part of their social circle.
"A sad story," the man said, refer
ring to Letelier's murder; "we have
not yet found out who is responsi
ble . . . but we will!" he said, shak
ing his finger in the air for effect.
His words reminded me of the
countless times I have heard Ameri
cans at the dinner table make fatu
ous, self-serving remarks about the
"American way of life," remarks in
which they inevitably shift from the
use of "the government" to the use
of the democratic "we," remarks
which imply that political punch is
the same as moral character.
Such remarks always betray the
speaker's political naivete, and they

almost always seem to be prompted
by resentment and indignance over
the suggestion that American demo
cracy might do a better job than it has
done in the past. It was ironic to hear
the same tone taken by a Chilean
who lived, willingly, in a highly fas
cistic police state.
Americans are only just beginning
to discover the invisible network of
covert political influence that per
meates their government, but they
have yet to realize that any political
system makes such networks plausi
ble. what makes them possible is a
self-righteous and self-satisfied elec
torate that will accept and perpetuate
simplistic explanations for complex
problems.
It is far less important for us in this
country to learn the details of every
instance of covert political activity
than it is for us to recognize that an
atmosphere of self-righteous indig
nation must exist before the use of
political brutailty can be rationalized
by a country's leaders.
And since America has per
petuated such an atmosphere, she
must accept responsibilityfor having
set a vicious political style: when we
have rationalized our own covert
amorality, we can expect others to
use us as a rationalization for their
barbarisms.
We killed Orlando Letelier.
America killed him by establishing a
tone that justified the use of political
assassination and torture, and by
creating rationalizations forsuch tac
tics that could be adopted by de
veloping nations who look to this
country as a model for democracy.
And as long as Americans continue
to hide in the safety of their own
political self-righteousness and use it
to veil their shortcomings, as long as
they continue to close their eyes to
the complexities of political life in
the twentieth century, then power
hungry men will use that self
righteousness as an excuse for un
dermining the democratic principles
they pretend to uphold.
We must not ignore the role that
self-scrutiny plays in democracy, and
we must not forget that vigilance is
the price of liberty; but we must also
remember that decay is the fate of
the self-satisfied. It is ourselves we
must be vigilant with, it is our own
premises we must scrutinize.
America, if she is to survive, must
grow out of her adolescent tendancy
towards simplistic indignation and
cultivate true moral wisdom. As a
people we must learn to make long
term, in-depth assessments of our
actions instead of acting on the basis
of impulsive self-righteousness.
For impulsive actions always re
turn to haunt you, chickens do come
home eventually, and it will not take
many more of them to break the back
of our democratic roost.

Recently, the United States de
ported Michael Townley, an
American national living in Chile,
and charged him with conspiracy in
connection with the assassination of
Orlando Letelier, a former member
of Salvador Allende's socialist Chi
lean government.
Letelier was killed in Washington,
D.C. when a remote-controlled
bomb attached to his car was deto
nated as he rode to the institute
where he worked. News releases
have suggested that Cuban exile
groups were at the centcr of the con
spiracy, and three Cubans have been
charged in the murder. But a look at
the undercurrents of Allende's over
throw in the fall of 1973 suggests that
the responsibility for Letelier's death
lies elsewhere.
Letelier's death suggests that
America's cavalier, "secret-agent"
approach to international politics has
become a Frankenstein creation that
has returned to haunt us; as Malcolm
X put it after the assassination of John
Kennedy in Dallas, "The chickens
have come home to roost."
Recently Fernando Flores, another
member of the Allende cabinet and
now a visiting professor at Stanford,
told his class that the coup which
brought the Allende government
down was no surprise to the cabinet
members; military and police activity
during the preceeding weeks
warned them of what was coming.
However, what did surprise Flores
and the other members of Allende's
government was the vicious brutality

with which the military initiated re
prisals against the Marxist party, and
the extent to which assassination and
torture were used by the coup with
out hesitation.
The history of coups in Chile was
such that Allende felt reasonably cer
tain his overthrow would be blood
less and that the opposition would
treat he and his cabinet members
humanely. After all, the members of
the government could hardly expect
barbaric treatment from people they
had grown up and gone to school
with.
Anyone familiar with Chilean soci
ety knows that a power elite does
exist in the country, an elite so small
and ingrown that acquaintance on a
first-name basis among members of
opposing factions is common, if not
the rule; most members of the ruling
class are likely to have known one
another from childhood.
But the average American is not
familiar with this fact, and we fail to
understand the real significance of
the coup's ruthlessness. The situa
tion could be likened to a Stanford
fraternity, twenty years hence, split
ting into two factions on political
grounds, with one faction setting out
to annihilate its fraternity brothers
with no mercy.
Could Chilean culture have fallen
into such an advanced state of decay,
I asked myself when Flores' remark
put the coup into perspective?
It was the memory ot Letelier's as
sassination — and in particular, the
style of his assassination — that made

me recognize that moral decay in
Chile was not the sole cause of the
brutality that followed Allende's
overthrow. For what both Allende's
overthrow and the assassination of
Orlando Letelier have in common —
one directly, and the other indirectly
— is the stamp of the American CIA.
One can imagine two scenarios for
CIA involvement in the 1973 coup.
Either CIA agents were, as was the
case in the overthrow of the Diem
regime in South Vietnam, present in
the coup leaders' headquarters, pul
ling strings, even directing troop and
police movements, and urging brutal
ity upon the coup's members as a
sure means of intimidating popular
opposition.
Or, the tacit approval and support
of the CIA and the American busi
ness community went to the heads of
the coup leaders, allowing them to
rationalize the assassination of close
acquaintances as a fact of political ■
life.
This second possibility is proba
bly more frightening than the first.
For the self-righteousness apparent
among the leaders of the coup —
self-righteousness which allowed
them to murder friends and imprison
and torture thousands for political
beliefs alone — is the same senti
ment that motivated America in Viet
nam, the same sentiment that al
lowed Richard Nixon to be elected
twice, and the same sentiment that
allows a figure like Ronald Reagon to
maintain influence in the political
sphere.
* Blind self-righteousness
The Letelier assassination tells us
that we have transmitted our blind
self-righteousness like a virus to
those around us; at best, the spirit of
the Chilean coup is alive in Ameri
can, at worst it probably originated
here.
I recently had dinner with a Chi
lean couple who were on a business
trip to the United States. I was in
terested — and a little shocked — to
find that, though the husband
worked for an American multi
national firm in Chile and supported
Allende's overthrow completely,
both he and his wife had known Or
lando Letelier well and considered
him part of their social circle.
"A sad story," the man said, refer
ring to Letelier's murder; "we have
not yet found out who is responsi
ble . . . but we will!" he said, shak
ing his finger in the air for effect.
His words reminded me of the
countless times I have heard Ameri
cans at the dinner table make fatu
ous, self-serving remarks about the
"American way of life," remarks in
which they inevitably shift from the
use of "the government" to the use
of the democratic "we," remarks
which imply that political punch is
the same as moral character.
Such remarks always betray the
speaker's political naivete, and they

almost always seem to be prompted
by resentment and indignance over
the suggestion that American demo
cracy might do a better job than it has
done in the past. It was ironic to hear
the same tone taken by a Chilean
who lived, willingly, in a highly fas
cistic police state.
Americans are only just beginning
to discover the invisible network of
covert political influence that per
meates their government, but they
have yet to realize that any political
system makes such networks plausi
ble. what makes them possible is a
self-righteous and self-satisfied elec
torate that will accept and perpetuate
simplistic explanations for complex
problems.
It is far less important for us in this
country to learn the details of every
instance of covert political activity
than it is for us to recognize that an
atmosphere of self-righteous indig
nation must exist before the use of
political brutailty can be rationalized
by a country's leaders.
And since America has per
petuated such an atmosphere, she
must accept responsibilityfor having
set a vicious political style: when we
have rationalized our own covert
amorality, we can expect others to
use us as a rationalization for their
barbarisms.
We killed Orlando Letelier.
America killed him by establishing a
tone that justified the use of political
assassination and torture, and by
creating rationalizations forsuch tac
tics that could be adopted by de
veloping nations who look to this
country as a model for democracy.
And as long as Americans continue
to hide in the safety of their own
political self-righteousness and use it
to veil their shortcomings, as long as
they continue to close their eyes to
the complexities of political life in
the twentieth century, then power
hungry men will use that self
righteousness as an excuse for un
dermining the democratic principles
they pretend to uphold.
We must not ignore the role that
self-scrutiny plays in democracy, and
we must not forget that vigilance is
the price of liberty; but we must also
remember that decay is the fate of
the self-satisfied. It is ourselves we
must be vigilant with, it is our own
premises we must scrutinize.
America, if she is to survive, must
grow out of her adolescent tendancy

And as long as Americans continue
to hide in the safety of their own
political self-righteousness and use it
to veil their shortcomings, as long as
they continue to close their eyes to
the complexities of political life in

they pretend to uphold.
We must not ignore the role that
self-scrutiny plays in democracy, and

America, if she is to survive, must
grow out of her adolescent tendancy

cultivate true moral wisdom. As a
people we must learn to make long

Recently, the United States de
ported Michael Townley, an
American national living in Chile,
and charged him with conspiracy in
connection with the assassination of
Orlando Letelier, a former member
of Salvador Allende's socialist Chi
lean government.
Letelier was killed in Washington,
D.C. when a remote-controlled
bomb attached to his car was deto
nated as he rode to the institute
where he worked. News releases
have suggested that Cuban exile
groups were at the centcr of the con
spiracy, and three Cubans have been
charged in the murder. But a look at
the undercurrents of Allende's over
throw in the fall of 1973 suggests that
the responsibility for Letelier's death
lies elsewhere.
Letelier's death suggests that
America's cavalier, "secret-agent"
approach to international politics has
become a Frankenstein creation that
has returned to haunt us; as Malcolm
X put it after the assassination of John
Kennedy in Dallas, "The chickens
have come home to roost."
Recently Fernando Flores, another
member of the Allende cabinet and
now a visiting professor at Stanford,
told his class that the coup which
brought the Allende government
down was no surprise to the cabinet
members; military and police activity
during the preceeding weeks
warned them of what was coming.
However, what did surprise Flores
and the other members of Allende's
government was the vicious brutality

with which the military initiated re
prisals against the Marxist party, and
the extent to which assassination and
torture were used by the coup with
out hesitation.
The history of coups in Chile was
such that Allende felt reasonably cer
tain his overthrow would be blood
less and that the opposition would
treat he and his cabinet members
humanely. After all, the members of
the government could hardly expect
barbaric treatment from people they
had grown up and gone to school
with.
Anyone familiar with Chilean soci
ety knows that a power elite does
exist in the country, an elite so small
and ingrown that acquaintance on a
first-name basis among members of
opposing factions is common, if not
the rule; most members of the ruling
class are likely to have known one
another from childhood.
But the average American is not
familiar with this fact, and we fail to
understand the real significance of
the coup's ruthlessness. The situa
tion could be likened to a Stanford
fraternity, twenty years hence, split
ting into two factions on political
grounds, with one faction setting out
to annihilate its fraternity brothers
with no mercy.
Could Chilean culture have fallen
into such an advanced state of decay,
I asked myself when Flores' remark
put the coup into perspective?
It was the memory ot Letelier's as
sassination — and in particular, the
style of his assassination — that made

me recognize that moral decay in
Chile was not the sole cause of the
brutality that followed Allende's
overthrow. For what both Allende's
overthrow and the assassination of
Orlando Letelier have in common —
one directly, and the other indirectly
— is the stamp of the American CIA.
One can imagine two scenarios for
CIA involvement in the 1973 coup.
Either CIA agents were, as was the
case in the overthrow of the Diem
regime in South Vietnam, present in
the coup leaders' headquarters, pul
ling strings, even directing troop and
police movements, and urging brutal
ity upon the coup's members as a
sure means of intimidating popular
opposition.
Or, the tacit approval and support
of the CIA and the American busi
ness community went to the heads of
the coup leaders, allowing them to
rationalize the assassination of close
acquaintances as a fact of political ■
life.
This second possibility is proba
bly more frightening than the first.
For the self-righteousness apparent
among the leaders of the coup —
self-righteousness which allowed
them to murder friends and imprison
and torture thousands for political
beliefs alone — is the same senti
ment that motivated America in Viet
nam, the same sentiment that al
lowed Richard Nixon to be elected
twice, and the same sentiment that
allows a figure like Ronald Reagon to
maintain influence in the political
sphere.
* Blind self-righteousness
The Letelier assassination tells us
that we have transmitted our blind
self-righteousness like a virus to
those around us; at best, the spirit of
the Chilean coup is alive in Ameri
can, at worst it probably originated
here.
I recently had dinner with a Chi
lean couple who were on a business
trip to the United States. I was in
terested — and a little shocked — to
find that, though the husband
worked for an American multi
national firm in Chile and supported
Allende's overthrow completely,
both he and his wife had known Or
lando Letelier well and considered
him part of their social circle.
"A sad story," the man said, refer
ring to Letelier's murder; "we have
not yet found out who is responsi
ble . . . but we will!" he said, shak
ing his finger in the air for effect.
His words reminded me of the
countless times I have heard Ameri
cans at the dinner table make fatu
ous, self-serving remarks about the
"American way of life," remarks in
which they inevitably shift from the
use of "the government" to the use
of the democratic "we," remarks
which imply that political punch is
the same as moral character.
Such remarks always betray the
speaker's political naivete, and they

almost always seem to be prompted
by resentment and indignance over
the suggestion that American demo
cracy might do a better job than it has
done in the past. It was ironic to hear
the same tone taken by a Chilean
who lived, willingly, in a highly fas
cistic police state.
Americans are only just beginning
to discover the invisible network of
covert political influence that per
meates their government, but they
have yet to realize that any political
system makes such networks plausi
ble. what makes them possible is a
self-righteous and self-satisfied elec
torate that will accept and perpetuate
simplistic explanations for complex
problems.
It is far less important for us in this
country to learn the details of every
instance of covert political activity
than it is for us to recognize that an
atmosphere of self-righteous indig
nation must exist before the use of
political brutailty can be rationalized
by a country's leaders.
And since America has per
petuated such an atmosphere, she
must accept responsibilityfor having
set a vicious political style: when we
have rationalized our own covert
amorality, we can expect others to
use us as a rationalization for their
barbarisms.
We killed Orlando Letelier.
America killed him by establishing a
tone that justified the use of political
assassination and torture, and by
creating rationalizations forsuch tac
tics that could be adopted by de
veloping nations who look to this
country as a model for democracy.
And as long as Americans continue
to hide in the safety of their own
political self-righteousness and use it
to veil their shortcomings, as long as
they continue to close their eyes to
the complexities of political life in
the twentieth century, then power
hungry men will use that self
