Bovine Holocaust
In view of the present concern for
animal welfare, we feel that the fol
lowing atrocity should be brought to
the Daily's attention. Each night,
scores of drunken students rampage
into the Stanford foothills where
they sneak up on unsuspecting cows
as they sleep.
Then, with total disregard for the
laws of the animal kingdom, they
send them plunging horns over
hooves down the hillside.
This bovine holocaust, commonly
known as "cow tipping" to its under
graduate perpetrators, is usually car
ried out by groups of two, who lunge

headlong into the sides of upright,
slumbering cows.
Given the brutal nature of this vile
and atrocious act, it is the opinion of
the undersigned that only the hear
tiest of these magnificent, intelligent
and graceful creatures can avoid
serious injury or even death. If the
authorities would only be more dili
gent in the protection of our bovine
breathren, this horrific development
could be curtailed.

Columbae house viable
At the risk of soiling Columbae
House by entering into the popular
ity contest mentality of the housing
draw, I feel that it's important to
clarify an error in the Daily article of
May 18 which seems to cast doubts
on Columbae's viability.
Contrary to the Daily article, as
signment to Columbae was made
only for students who were in the
assignable pool of applicants, who
listed Columbae specifically as a
choiceand who had a special priority
status. By this criteria there were 4
empty men's spaces (we overfilled
the women's spaces).
In fact, however, there are six re
turning male residents who listed
Columbae as their first or second
choice, who were not assigned and
about 30 other students listing Col
umbae, who did not have priority
and therefore could not be assigned
in round one.
Granted, Columbae's draw popu
larity is not competative with 558
Mayfield, and is even below that for
the Terra and Theta Chi co-ops. Liv
ing in Columbae can be, and gener
ally is, one of the more genuinely
educational, supportive apd gener
ally broadening experiences availa
ble at Stanford, but it's not some
thing that people should be enticed
into.
For this reason, Columbae
priorities are assigned by the people
interested in living at Columbae
themselves, through a process of
self-selection.
Yes, we as a community should
reach out more actively and make
ourselves more available to the rest
of Stanford. And yes, we should be
concerned about making Columbae
a good place to live. But to publicly
announce that Columbae has been
"put on notice" without further exp
lanation is misleading and counter
productive.

Senior Pledge boycotted
We are submitting this letter in re
sponse to Jonathan Mill's letter
(Daily, May 17) concerning the
Senior Pledge boycott. Once again
we have been mistakenly identified
with SCRIP. The "group of graduat
ing seniors, unaffiliated with any es
tablished organization," who sent
out the mailings on the boycott of the
Senior Pledge Program are, in fact, a
group of graduating seniors, unaf
filiated with any established organi
zation.
Their roles are many: one plays on
the lacrosse team; one is a boy scout
leader; one teaches a poetry class;
one works in a chemistry lab; and
one is from Oklahoma! But none of
us are members of SCRIP.
We would also like to thank Mills
for having the Daily reproduce the
two letters sent to all graduating
seniors. Apparently, for one reason
or another, many students who were
supposed to receive letters did not.
We hope that these people, as well
as others who support the boycott,
will read our letter and react by send
ing in their own letter of protest.
We would also like to comment on
Mills' claim that the United Campus
Christian Ministry (UCCM) did not
have the right to use their non-profit
status in mailing out the boycott let
ters.
In fact, the Senior Pledge Program
went so far as to request an investiga
tion of the non-profit status of the
UCCM. The San Francisco postmas
ter, however, has ruled in favor of
the UCCM's use of their mailing
permit.
We are just a group of "nondeS
CRIPs" concerned about the univer
sity's handling of our investments in
companies doing business in South
Africa. The reason for our boycott is
not that we don't think money do
nated to the Senior Pledge Program,
or any other university fund, goes for
good purposes and benefits stu
dents. We do.
But we feel that the South Africa
issue is important enough that we
must express our concern in the only
terms the university administration
seems to understand — money.
People have withheld money be
fore, for reasons ranging from the
football coaches' choice of quarter
back to the administration's choice
of the school mascot. We fell that our
concern deserves at least the same
means of expression, and we hope
you will join us.

scores of drunken students rampage
into the Stanford foothills where
they sneak up on unsuspecting cows
as they sleep.
Then, with total disregard for the
laws of the animal kingdom, they
send them plunging horns over
hooves down the hillside.
This bovine holocaust, commonly
known as "cow tipping" to its under
graduate perpetrators, is usually car
ried out by groups of two, who lunge

headlong into the sides of upright,
slumbering cows.
Given the brutal nature of this vile
and atrocious act, it is the opinion of
the undersigned that only the hear
tiest of these magnificent, intelligent
and graceful creatures can avoid
serious injury or even death. If the
authorities would only be more dili
gent in the protection of our bovine
breathren, this horrific development
could be curtailed.

Columbae house viable
At the risk of soiling Columbae
House by entering into the popular
ity contest mentality of the housing
draw, I feel that it's important to
clarify an error in the Daily article of
May 18 which seems to cast doubts
on Columbae's viability.
Contrary to the Daily article, as
signment to Columbae was made
only for students who were in the
assignable pool of applicants, who
listed Columbae specifically as a
choiceand who had a special priority
status. By this criteria there were 4
empty men's spaces (we overfilled
the women's spaces).
In fact, however, there are six re
turning male residents who listed
Columbae as their first or second
choice, who were not assigned and
about 30 other students listing Col
umbae, who did not have priority
and therefore could not be assigned
in round one.
Granted, Columbae's draw popu
larity is not competative with 558
Mayfield, and is even below that for
the Terra and Theta Chi co-ops. Liv
ing in Columbae can be, and gener
ally is, one of the more genuinely
educational, supportive apd gener
ally broadening experiences availa
ble at Stanford, but it's not some
thing that people should be enticed
into.
For this reason, Columbae
priorities are assigned by the people
interested in living at Columbae
themselves, through a process of
self-selection.
Yes, we as a community should
reach out more actively and make
ourselves more available to the rest
of Stanford. And yes, we should be
concerned about making Columbae
a good place to live. But to publicly
announce that Columbae has been
"put on notice" without further exp
lanation is misleading and counter
productive.

Senior Pledge boycotted
We are submitting this letter in re
sponse to Jonathan Mill's letter
(Daily, May 17) concerning the
Senior Pledge boycott. Once again
we have been mistakenly identified
with SCRIP. The "group of graduat
ing seniors, unaffiliated with any es
tablished organization," who sent
out the mailings on the boycott of the
Senior Pledge Program are, in fact, a
group of graduating seniors, unaf
filiated with any established organi
zation.
Their roles are many: one plays on
the lacrosse team; one is a boy scout
leader; one teaches a poetry class;
one works in a chemistry lab; and
one is from Oklahoma! But none of
us are members of SCRIP.
We would also like to thank Mills
for having the Daily reproduce the
two letters sent to all graduating
seniors. Apparently, for one reason
or another, many students who were
supposed to receive letters did not.
We hope that these people, as well
as others who support the boycott,
will read our letter and react by send
ing in their own letter of protest.
We would also like to comment on
Mills' claim that the United Campus
Christian Ministry (UCCM) did not
have the right to use their non-profit
status in mailing out the boycott let
ters.
In fact, the Senior Pledge Program
went so far as to request an investiga
tion of the non-profit status of the
UCCM. The San Francisco postmas
ter, however, has ruled in favor of
the UCCM's use of their mailing
permit.
We are just a group of "nondeS
CRIPs" concerned about the univer
sity's handling of our investments in
companies doing business in South
Africa. The reason for our boycott is
not that we don't think money do
nated to the Senior Pledge Program,
or any other university fund, goes for
good purposes and benefits stu
dents. We do.
But we feel that the South Africa
issue is important enough that we
must express our concern in the only
terms the university administration
seems to understand — money.
People have withheld money be
fore, for reasons ranging from the
football coaches' choice of quarter
back to the administration's choice
of the school mascot. We fell that our
concern deserves at least the same
means of expression, and we hope
you will join us.
