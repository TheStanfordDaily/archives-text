# Younger in 'battle of styles' for Republican nomination
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — Evelle
Younger has been climbing the
ladder of public offices for
three decades.
Now he is seeking Califor
nia's highest office, the gover
norship.
By all standards of traditional
politics, the 59-year-old attor
ney general should be a cinch
to win the Republican nomina
tion.
Younger is the most widely
known of the Republican can
didates. And he has paid his
political dues as a deputy city
attorney, city prosecutor,
municipal and superior court
judge, Los Angeles County dis
trict attorney and, for the past
seven years, attorney general
of California.
The question facing Younger
today is whether traditional
politics still work in 1978.
He started the campaign
with an overwhelming lead in
polls — 25 per cent over his
nearest rival. The lead was
based on his high name iden
tification and long years of
public service.
But two challengers who are
practicing new and different
brands of politics have closed
the gap on Younger.
There's Assemblyman Ken
Maddy, Hollywood handsome
and articulate, who has leaped
from zero in polls to major
candidate status with polished,
expensive television commer
cials.
And there is retired Los
Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis,
who is trying to copy Ronald
Reagan's citizen-politican for
mula of starting at the top in
politics after winning fame in
another field.
Younger describes himself
as a moderate Republican —
tough on crime issues, sym
pathetic to consumer and en
vironmental concerns, a friend
by organized labor.
He says he stands for balance
and good management, and he
contrasts that with what he
calls the extremism and mis
management of Democratic
Cov. Jerry Brown.
Younger is following a tradi
tional path — district attorney,
attorney general — which took
Earl Warren and Pat Brown to
the governor's office. And
Younger is using tried and
proven political techniques,
campaigning on his record and .
using all of the advantages of
his office to generate publicity.
In recent weeks, Younger
has issued task force reports
on organized crime, the Mexi
can Mafia and energy. He em
phasizes his role at attorney
general, and is making signific
antly fewer strictly political ap
pearances than any of his
major foes.
Younger concedes he may
not be as charismatic as Brown
or some of his COP rivals. But
he says it would be phony for
him to try to change his style.

"I will offer leadership. I will
conduct a campaign based on
the issues. I won't try to out
cute the incumbent by eating
exotic sandwiches or putting
my mattress on the floor,"
Younger says.
"Neither will I try to be the
most entertaining of all Repub
lican candidates. While others
get laughs, I will talk about
people's problems. I will not
seek to amuse the citizens, but
to gain their confidence and
respect."
On specific issues, Younger
and his COP rivals agree more
often than they disagree. They
all support development of
nuclear energy and say Brown
is discouraging rather than en
couraging business expansion.
On Proposition 13, the Jarvis
property tax cut initiative,
Younger has positioned him
self as close to the middle as
possible.

Maddy and San Diego Mayor
Pete Wilson are campaigning
against Proposition 13, while
Davis is campaigning for it.
Younger says he personally will
vote for 13, but that he will not
campaign for it.
Vounger's chief campaign
issue is that he has the best
chance of beating Brown and
that he has never lost an elec
tion, which is the same theme
that Maddy and Wilson em
phasize.
But Younger has polls to
bolster his claim. Every inde
pendent poll over the past year
has shown Younger running
better than Davis, Maddy or
Wilson in one-on-one compet
ition with Brown.
The surveys show Brown
ahead of all rivals, but Younger
ranks 6 to 15 percentage points
behind in various polls, while
the other Republicans trail
Brown by 20 to 30 points.

he says it would be phony for
him to try to change his style.

"I will offer leadership. I will
conduct a campaign based on
the issues. I won't try to out
cute the incumbent by eating
exotic sandwiches or putting
my mattress on the floor,"
Younger says.
"Neither will I try to be the
most entertaining of all Repub
lican candidates. While others
get laughs, I will talk about
people's problems. I will not
seek to amuse the citizens, but
to gain their confidence and
respect."
On specific issues, Younger
and his COP rivals agree more
often than they disagree. They
all support development of
nuclear energy and say Brown
is discouraging rather than en
couraging business expansion.
On Proposition 13, the Jarvis
property tax cut initiative,
Younger has positioned him
self as close to the middle as
possible.

Maddy and San Diego Mayor
Pete Wilson are campaigning
against Proposition 13, while
Davis is campaigning for it.
Younger says he personally will
vote for 13, but that he will not
campaign for it.
Vounger's chief campaign
issue is that he has the best
chance of beating Brown and
that he has never lost an elec
tion, which is the same theme
that Maddy and Wilson em
phasize.
But Younger has polls to
bolster his claim. Every inde
pendent poll over the past year
has shown Younger running
better than Davis, Maddy or
Wilson in one-on-one compet
ition with Brown.
The surveys show Brown
ahead of all rivals, but Younger
ranks 6 to 15 percentage points
behind in various polls, while
the other Republicans trail
Brown by 20 to 30 points.
Sacramento (AP) — Evelle
Younger has been climbing the
ladder of public offices for
three decades.
Now he is seeking Califor
nia's highest office, the gover
norship.
By all standards of traditional
politics, the 59-year-old attor
ney general should be a cinch
to win the Republican nomina
tion.
Younger is the most widely
known of the Republican can
didates. And he has paid his
political dues as a deputy city
attorney, city prosecutor,
municipal and superior court
judge, Los Angeles County dis
trict attorney and, for the past
seven years, attorney general
of California.
The question facing Younger
today is whether traditional
politics still work in 1978.
He started the campaign
with an overwhelming lead in
polls — 25 per cent over his
nearest rival. The lead was
based on his high name iden
tification and long years of
public service.
But two challengers who are
practicing new and different
brands of politics have closed
the gap on Younger.
There's Assemblyman Ken
Maddy, Hollywood handsome
and articulate, who has leaped
from zero in polls to major
candidate status with polished,
expensive television commer
cials.
And there is retired Los
Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis,
who is trying to copy Ronald
Reagan's citizen-politican for
mula of starting at the top in
politics after winning fame in
another field.
Younger describes himself
as a moderate Republican —
tough on crime issues, sym
pathetic to consumer and en
vironmental concerns, a friend
by organized labor.
He says he stands for balance
and good management, and he
contrasts that with what he
calls the extremism and mis
management of Democratic
Cov. Jerry Brown.
Younger is following a tradi
tional path — district attorney,
attorney general — which took
Earl Warren and Pat Brown to
the governor's office. And
Younger is using tried and
proven political techniques,
campaigning on his record and .
using all of the advantages of
his office to generate publicity.
In recent weeks, Younger
has issued task force reports
on organized crime, the Mexi
can Mafia and energy. He em
phasizes his role at attorney
general, and is making signific
antly fewer strictly political ap
pearances than any of his
major foes.
Younger concedes he may
not be as charismatic as Brown
or some of his COP rivals. But
he says it would be phony for
him to try to change his style.

conduct a campaign based on
