# Anti-abortion movement spurs emotion-charged debate

A determined fight by those
who oppose abortion is greatly
modifying the scope and im
pact of the 1973 Supreme Court
decision legalizing the proce
dure.
Because of pressure exerted
by the Right to Life movement
and those who agree with it, 22
states, including Florida,
Maine, Ohio, Illinois and New
Jersey, will pay for abortions
only if the mother's life is in
danger. These states will not
pay for elective abortions even
for victims of rape or incest.
Twelve other states will pay
for abortions for rape and in
cest victims. Only 16 states, in
cluding California, Colorado,

Massachusetts and Michigan,
still pay for most abortions for
women on Medicaid.
These laws do not run
counter to the Supreme Court
decision because they do not
ban abortions. Women who
can afford them can still get
legal abortions, but the denial
of public funding makes them
extremely difficult — if not im
possible — for poor women to
obtain.
And, if those in the anti
abortion movement succeed,
the Supreme Court's 1973 de
cision would be reversed.
Twelve states have already pas
sed legislation calling for a
constitutional convention to
write an amendment making
the procedure illegal except

where the life of the mother is
in danger. Although few politi
cal analysts and proponents of
abortion believe enough states
will call for a convention, they
think Congress might be pres
sured into passing the con
stitutional amendment for the
states to ratify.
The issue has been charged
with emotion. Abortion oppo
nents have crowded legislative
chambers across the country to
make impassioned statements
for the rights of the unborn.
Mervin Field, a San
Francisco-based pollster, has
drawn a portrait of those op
posed to abortion based on
several studies and surveys in
California. "The anti-abortion
people feel more passionate

and strongly," he said in an in
terview. "It's more important
to them to have candidates
running for office than it is for
people who are pro-abortion."
He said that their candidates
are more vocal on the issue
than candidates who favor
abortion. "The one-issue
people are very single-minded,
and that makes it difficult for
candidates (seeking political
office)."
Abortion clinics in Cleve
land, Cincinnati, Akron and
Columbis, Ohio, and Omaha,
Neb., and a Planned Parent
hood center in St. Paul, Minn.,
have been the targets of van
dalism, arson or firebombing
in the last two years. While no
one has been apprehended in

any of the cases, the incidents
indicate the emotional fervor
surrounding abortion.
"This is a life and death is
sue," said Judie Brown of the
National Right to Life Commit
tee, "and we'll fight until we
get what we want."
Ellen Leitzer of the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
says she believes is a religi
ous issue. "It is an attempt,
primarily by the Catholic and
Mormon churches, to enact
doctrinal law into civil law, and
violates First Amendment
guarantees on the separation
of church and state."
The right-to-lifers have been
stunningly successful thus far.
In 1976 and 1977, they per
suaded Congress to amend the
Health, Education and Welfare
appropriation bill so federal
money could be used for abor
tions only under very limited
conditions.
Right-to-life groups at the
state level have convinced
many legislatures and govern
ment administrators to restrict
the use of state funds for
Medicaid abortions.
In June 1977, the U.S. Sup
reme Court confirmed that
states were not obligated to
spend public funds on abor
tions, although it did not mod

ify its 1973 position that abor
tion was a private matter bet
ween a woman and her doctor
and thus protected by the con
stitutional right to privacy.
Nevertheless, the ruling
shocked many abortion advo
cates. They see in the new
court decision and in the ac
tions taken by Congress and
state legislatures an ominous
swing back to the era, some 15
years ago, when most abor
tions were performed illegally.
They admit they were caught
off-guard by the breadth and
intensity of the anti-abortion
campaign. "Most of our
people became complacent
after the 1973 decision," said
Karen Mulhauser of the Na
tional Abortion Rights Action
League (NARAL) "and many of
them went on to other things."
Brown sees abortion as more
than a cause to be waged on a
political battleground. "It is a
biological question of when
life begins," she said, "an ethi
cal question of whether a
human being's life can be ter
minated because he or she
lives in a womb."
However, said Mulhauser,
"Politicians, especially on the
state level, are often swamped
with anti-abortion mail and
threatened with a large bloc of

single-issue votes against them
if they do not support right-to
life legislation. It's beginning
to distort the entire political
process."
Mulhauser also noted that
right-to-life groups have estab
lished committees in many
states to work against candi
dates who do not support legis
lation limiting abortions.
"Politicians now believe that
unless they vote for the anti
abortion measures, they will
be hurt at the polls."
Since the 1977 Supreme
Court ruling that states need
not pay for Medicaid abor
tions, pro-choice groups have
noted a renewed interest in
their cause. In New York re
cently, a well-organized abor
tion rights lobby was able to
easily turn back anti-abortion
legislation despite a strong
right-to-life effort, and anti
abortion measures were also
defeated in Virginia and Mary
land.
More is sure to be heard —
both pro and con — on the
abortion issue during the fall
election campaigns, especially
in California and Colorado
where statewide anti-abortion
initiatives are expected to be
on the ballot.
