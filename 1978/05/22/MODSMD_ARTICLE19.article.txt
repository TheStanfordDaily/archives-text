# Stanford tennis teams approach championships
## Wright's knee casts doubt as men begin NCAAs sports 
### 
Undefeated and top-ranked nationally, Stan
ford's tennis team defends its NCAA title in the
NCAA Championships beginning today and
running through May 29 at the University of
Georgia.
However, the Cardinals, 20-0 on the season,
have lost one of the key ingredients to last year's
championship and this year's dual match re
cord. Senior All-America Perry Wright suffered
cartilage damage in his right knee after playing
No. 4 singles and No. 2 doubles all season and
will not see action in the team tournament.
Card coach Dick Gould's ladder remains the
same at No. 1 through No. 3 singles, headed by
freshman John McEnroe, senior Bill Maze and
defending NCAA singles champ Matt Mitchell, a
junior. Completing the lineup will be sopho
more Peter Rennert, junior John Rast and
sophomore Lloyd Bourne.
In the format established by the NCAA last
year, the nation's top 16 schools will play an
overall team tournament May 22 to 25, followed
by individual singles and doubles competition
May 26 to 29. Stanford opens play in the team
tourney today at 1 p.m. against South Carolina,
led to a 26-6 record this season by All-America
Chris Mayotte.
"Obviously we're weakened by the loss of

Perry," said Gould. "We have some inexperi
ence in doubles, which had been a strong point
this season. Although the doubles teams ha
ven't played much this year, I have confidence
in them."
Throughout the greater part of the season,
McEnroe and Maze played No. 1 doubles fol-
by Mitchell-Wright and Rennert-Bourne.
In Wright's absence, McEnroe will team with
Mitchell at No. 1, and Maze with Rast at No. 2.
Gould said he has three of the top collegiate
players in the country in McEnroe, Maze and
Mitchell.
"If they play up to their potential, it will help
offset Perry's loss," said Gould. "But all three
have been beaten and are not invincible. It'll
take a total team effort for us to win."
Seeded behind Stanford in the team play is
UCLA, which Gould feels could spell trouble for
the Cards.
"When we met UCLA in the regular season,
we were at full strength and they weren't," said
Gould, whose Cards defeated the Bruins 5-4 in
Los Angeles and 8-1 at Stanford. "Both Jon
Paley and Robbie Venter have returned to the
UCLA team after having been injured. That's a
tremendous equalizer to say the least. Provided
we reach the finals, UCLA will be the team to
beat."
