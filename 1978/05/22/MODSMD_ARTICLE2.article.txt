### 
Paris (AP) — Three terrorists who
touched off a gun battle in Orly air
port were planning "a veritable mas
sacre" of passengers waiting to
board an El Al flight to Tel Aviv, a
French official said yesterday.
In Beirut, the newspaper An Nahar
reported that a guerrilla group cal
ling itself the "Sons of South Leba
non" claimed responsibility. Israeli

newspapers charged that the Pales
tine Liberation Organization was be
hind Saturday's aborted raid.
The three terrorists were shot and
killed by Israeli and French security
men, and a 55-year-old French
policeman also died in the shootout.
Six other persons — four French pas
sengers, two policemen and a hos
tess for El Al, the Israeli airline —

were wounded.
The passengers were waiting for a
Boeing 707, which normally seats
160. El Al refused to say how many
passengers were in the lounge so as
not to give a clue to the number of its
traveling and non-traveling security
officers.
"The attack was directed against a
number of enemy Israeli officers
who were to board the jetliner," said
a statement signed by the "Sons of
South Lebanon" and slipped under
the Beirut newspaper's door.
In Paris, Interior Minister Christian
Bonnet said: "We have proof that the
terrorists did not intend to hijack the
plane, but were planning a veritable
massacre of the passengers waiting
to board it." He did not say what
proof the government had.
Bonnet told reporters the ter
rorists held tickets to the North Afri
can country of Tunisia on another air
line and carried Tunisian and
Lebanese passports that were
forged. The trio's identities have not
been established, he said.
The name of the guerrilla group
claiming responsibility indicated the
attack may have been staged in re
venge for Israel's invasion of south
ern Lebanon March 15. Israel sent
troops against Palestinian stron
gholds in southern Lebanon four
days after a Palestinian attack on a
tourist bus near Tel Aviv in which 35
Israelis were killed.
Spokesmen for the major Palesti
nian guerrilla groups declined to
comment on the attack. An official of
Yasser Arafat's PLO said: "We have
nothing to say."
Israeli diplomats paid tribute to the
rapid intervention of the French
police which, they said, foiled the
terrorists' plan.
