# lls edge Cal in soccer

Berkeley — Stanford's sec
ond women's soccer team was
doing its homework over the
weekend for an important test
— the Stanford Invitational
Tournament. In preparing for
the upcoming competition,
the H's improved their record
to 3-3-1 by defeating Berkeley
2-1 Saturday night and scrim
aging with Davis yesterday.
John Jenke, head coach of
the ll's described the matches
as "extra games added to our
schedule to prepare us for next
week's tournament in which
we have been entered as the
12th team. Our intention was
to familiarize each player with
the people that will be playing
next to them."
The ll's, serving the soccer
program as a junior varsity
squad, receive extensive
game-time experience, but a
flexible roster must accommo
date newly joined players and
absences caused by women
moving to the I's team.
Jenke's hope is to counter
this characteristic variability
with the additional games and
meet his tourney expectations.
The ll's will "enter the tourna
ment not just to have a good
time; we are very serious about
winning and I think that be
cause we have been perform
ing against one of the better
teams on the west coast, our
own first team, that we have
the experience of competing,"
lenke said.

Against Cal, the Cardinals
took a 1-0 lead 11 minutes into
the game on a goal by Margaret
Sampson. Fourteen minutes
later Stanford went ahead 2-0
on an "own-goal" by Berkeley.
Confusion in the Bears' de
fense left several players out of
position and the ball was de
flected into the goal before the
goalie could get a hand on it.
Instead of the usual
"chalktalk," halftime for Stan
ford was highlighted by play
diagrams with gum drops laid
out on the synthetic surface.
The final score of the match
came when Cal's Ellen Tafs
scored a goal with 14 minutes
remaining.
Three major elements of
soccer were effectively de
monstrated by the Cards — use
of the wings, specialty kicks
and overlapping, and were re
sponsible for the control of the
game.
"What really developed in
our game was our outside at
tack. Both Margaret Deuchar
and Dianne Long played tre
mendously intelligent games.
They gave us an aspect of our
game that we have not had this
year — strong wing play.
Dianne and Margaret were
able to cross the ball and get it
into the center of the field, set
ting up extremely dangerous
attacks and in fact we scored
one of our goals on that,"
Jenke commented.
"Another aspect of our game
that has improved tremend

ously is the specialty kicks —
corner kicks and direct kicks at
goal. Betsy Lovekin has been
placing the ball extremely well
and with people like Karen Be
nedek and Margaret Sampson
in front to head the ball we
have quite a dangerous
weapon," he said.
Even if the Berkeley contest
had ended up as a scoreless tie,
anybody playing in or watching
the game could sense the im
provement in playmaking and
teamwork.
"It (Saturday's game) made
me realize how much I enjoy
playing soccer. I did feel that
the team got to its best point
and people were cooperating
well," Deuchar noted.
Perhaps the sense of im
provement and achievement
from this season was best ex
pressed by Long, who said,
"Participating in the develop
ment of this team's been a joy
for me. The team play was
technically sound — it's very
calm — every person had con
trol of their position. There was
a look before each pass and
we've been noticing it more
and more in practice and it
came together in this game. It's
like you're finally attaining
something you've worked on
for a long time and it's nice to
see it happening. It's great!"
