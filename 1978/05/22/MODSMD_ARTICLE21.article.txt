# Cards qualify four women
## 
### Alfred Nakatsuma 
At the WAIAW Region 8
Tournament in Berkeley this
weekend, the Stanford women
netters fell prey to the No. 1
ranking USC in singles, but de
fended their doubles title. The
tournament, touted to be the
toughest in the country, in
cluded many of the best teams
in the U.S. coming from the
Western states.
Players for this tournament
were chosen on the basis of
their performance during the
regular season. Chosen to rep
resent Stanford were Kathy
(No. 2 seed), and Barb (No. 6
seed) Jordan, Diane Morrison
(No. 10 seed), Susie Hagey
(No. 12 seed) and Donna Rubin
(No. 16 seed). The teams of
Morrison-Hagey (No. 1 seed),
and Jordan-Jordan (No. 3 seed)
were entered in doubles.
Kathy Jordan lost to Stacy
Margolin of USC in the semifi
nals, 7-5, 6-1. Jordan couldn't
seem to solidify her game as
she committed unforced er
rors, and missed volleys. Mar
golin, on the other hand was
hot, and seemed to do nothing
wrong.
The finals in singles was a
USC affair, as Stacy Margolin
defeated Barbara Hallquist in a
well-contested match.
Diane Morrison and Susie

Hagey again proved their
superiority in women's dou
bles as they toppled Barbara
Hallquist-Sheila Mclnerney of
USC 7-6, (5-4 in tie-breaker),
6-2. Down in the first set three
games to none, Stanford bat
tled back to win the tie
breaker. Hagey played excep
tionally well, as she ripped
forehands through the USC
defense.
Most importantly, four of the
five singles players and both
doubles teams from Stanford,
qualified for the national tour
nament in Salisbury, Md. June
4 to 12. In the all-tournament
team for the WAIAW regionals,
the top four Stanford women
were chosen. This was not a
team competition, but indi
vidual qualifying tournament.
However, Stanford was ranked
No. 2 in the West, behind USC,
as a result of their success in
the tournament.
UCLA and UC-San Diego
came in third and fourth, re
spectively.
