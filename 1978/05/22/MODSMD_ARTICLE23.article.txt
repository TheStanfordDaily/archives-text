# Tracksters finish last in Pac-8s

The Stanford track team's lack of depth
was the telling blow this weekend at the
Pacific-BTrackand Field Championships in
Corvallis, Ore.
The Cardinals finished in last, scoring
only 28 points, nine points out of seventh
and 98 behind conferencechampion USC.
"We got the hell beat out of us,"
lamented track coach Payton Jordan. "The
competition was absolutely ferocious. The
teams were talented and deep."
The question of depth seems to pere
nially haunt the Cardinals, and this year
was no exception. Only 17 athletes made
the trip this year, the smallest contingent
from any Pac-8 school.
"Our athletes did a good job," said Jor
dan, "we just didn't have the depth. We
went in with half of what the leaders had.
When they made a mistake, it didn't hurt
them. When we made a mistake, it
showed."
USC was proof positive of Jordan's
theory. The Trojans won the champion
ship despite losing two first places in the
400 and 800 meter races because of dis
qualifications. The 20 points they lost
turned a runaway into a close meet, but

they pulled it out nonetheless.
As an indication of the tough competi
tion, two Stanford records were broken in
the meet, and neither was close to a win
ning effort.
In the 200, James Lofton bettered his and
Larry Questad's record of 20.5 with a blaz
ing time of 20.33, and finished fourth (it is
only fair to add that the winner of the
event, USC's Clancy Edwards, is the world
record holder for the 200).
In the hammer throw, freshman Dave
Thomson broke the school record by
more than eight feet, yet finished in sixth
place with his throw of 174-2.
Stanford's best event was the long jump,
wjth Lofton capturing first place with a
leap of 25-9V2, and Darrin Nelson placing
fifth with an effort of 23-11 Vi. Their efforts
scored 12 of Stanford's 28 points, even
though they were well below their per
sonal bests.
In the 10,000 meters, Roy Kissin of Stan
ford finished sixth, with a time of 32:55.6,
five minutes behind world-class runner
Henry Rono of Washington State.
The relay teams both picked up points,
the 400 team placing third with a time of
39.%, and the 1600 team finished fourth

with a time of 3:08.1.
As for the remaining Stanford athletes,
the problem was not a lack of good per
formances.
"They performed well," said Jordan.
"They were just beaten. Tom Lobsinger
ran a tough and courageous race in the
1500, but he came in seventh. Nelson
eliminated a 10 flat sprinter in the prelims
of the 100, and finished seventh, too. Rick
Buss threw farther than he has thrown all
year, yet failed to score."
The collegiate season is over for all but a
handful of Stanford tracksters. The NCAA
Championships will be held in Eugene,
Oregon on June 1 to 3. Both Lofton and
Nelson have qualified in the long jump,
and Roy Kissin will run in the 5000 meters.
The 400 relay team of Alan Sheats, Cordon
Banks, Nelson and Lofton will compete,
also. Lofton has qualified for the 200 met
ers, but will not run. Said Jordan, "It's too
much in conflict with his performing well
in the other events."

Team Scoring - Southern California 126, Oregon 119, UCLA
