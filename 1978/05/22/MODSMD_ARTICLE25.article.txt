Narita, Japan (AP) â€” De
monstrators withdrew from the
flame-scorched gates protecting To
kyo's new international airport after
a weekend of violent protests and
officials said all flights were proceed
ing on schedule today.
Some 15,000 airport opponents ral
lied Saturday, but bands of radicals
who tried to force their way through
the gates with fire bombs and burn
ing trucks were repelled by 13,000
riot police on guard for the dedica
tion ceremonies.
The number of protesters dwin
dled to about 2500 yesterday. They
snake-danced and shouted- protests
while the first of the day's 23 cargo
and passenger planes landed with
out incident.
This morning there were no de
monstrators at the airport, 41 miles
northeast of Tokyo, as commercial
aircraft made their first departures
from the billion-dollar facility.
Police said some protesters were
still staying at various "fortresses"
and huts erected on private land
around the airport and were vowing
that the fight would continue.
Officials reported foes of the air
port tried to topple a pylon support
ing high-voltage wires overnight.
They said one of the four legs was cut
through and bolts were released on
other legs, but the tower did not fall.
They also said radicals flew a six
foot balloon from a 650-yard-long
rope near the end of the runway early
this morning in an attempt to disrupt
air traffic. Police who removed the
balloon said they found 20 gasoline
bombs, 10 gallons of gasoline and 17
steel pipes where the balloon was
tied to a tree.
The first plane to leave was a Ko
rean Airlines cargo plane. Passenger

departures started with a japan Air
lines flight to Saipan and Guam.
Many departing passengers said
they traveled to Narita the night be
fore because of expected traffic con
gestion between the airport and To
kyo.
The airport opening had been
postponed 11 times in seven years
because of opposition from en
vironmentalists, radical political
groups and local farmers who en
gaged in bloody clashes with police.
They said farmers were forced to sell
their land to make way for the airport
and that the facility will pollute the
environment.
Ceremonies honoring the $1 bill
ion airport's opening were held
Saturday.
That evening 19 policemen were
injured, two of them seriously, when
150 radicals attacked one of the air
port's barricaded gates with
firebombs and bottles filled with a
nauseating chemical.
Opponents stuck to their positions
yesterday at 35 barricaded stron
gholds outside the airport grounds.
"We aim to have Narita closed
down," said a nurse at one of the
field hospitals run by the de
monstrators. "The landing of a
couple of planes is no reason for the
government to shout 'Banzai' (long
life)."
Yesterday evening, an uniden
tified woman called a government of
fice in Tokyo, saying she had thrown
bacteria in the water works that
serves the airport and 4500 nearby
homes.
Water processing was shut down
for at least five hours while officials
checked the water, but police said a
full day's supply of drinkable water
was in reserve.
