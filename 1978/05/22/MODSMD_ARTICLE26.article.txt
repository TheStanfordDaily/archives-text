Siege survivors relate horrors
Brussels, Belgium — White survivors of the rebel
siege in Zaire's copper-mining capital of Kolwezi
began arriving here yesterday with their baggage
of nightmares — accounts of runaway rebels "out
to kill as many as they could" before being driven
out by French and Belgian troops.
"If the French had landed one day earlier there
probably would have been fewer victims," an Ita
lian refugee told reporters. "But if they had landed
one day later it would have been a real massacre."
A nun identified only as "Sister Helena" said:
"We were subjected to the worst kind of vio
lence." A 20-year-old Belgian woman said she was
raped eight times by rebel soldiers.
According to French and Belgian accounts, re
bels killed about 100 whites and 150 blacks during
their eight-day rampage at Kolwezi. French parat
roopers, followed by their Belgian counterparts,
broke the siege in weekend assaults and freed
survivors of the 2500-strong colony of Europeans
and Americans.
Church roof collapse kills one
Garland, Texas — A church roof collapsed under
tons of water from an overnight rainstorm yester
day as worshippers bowed their heads in prayer. A
9-year-old girl was killed, and 57 other persons
were injured, the city manager's office said.
Twelve of the injured were still in hospitals last
night, five in critical condition, officials said.
Mike Cain, 18, a survivor, pulled debris from his
pockets as he described the collapse.
"We heard just an explosion, wood cracking
and the water just kept coming. Water must have
poured down hard for at least nine seconds. It was
like being under a waterfall.
"A beam fell on a girl just two seats away from
me . . . There was a lot of screaming. I know the
little girl is dead because I saw her."
General strike expected in Peru
Lima, Peru — Troops patrolled Lima and other
Peruvian cities yesterday on the eve of a strike

expected to halt all but essential services in this
riot-torn nation of 17 million.
Peru's military government declared a state of
emergency Saturday and ruled the strike illegal,
but it appeared to be resigned to a walkout by
workers.
The strike will follow a week of violence in which
17 persons were reported killed, scores injured
and hundreds arrested. Rioting started last Mon
day after the government announced price in
creases and other austerity measures to help the
country's troubled economy.
The CGTP — the powerful Communist-led Gen
eral Confederation of Peruvian Workers — plus
organizations representing agricultural workers,
bus drivers, printers, electricians and glass and
brewery workers called the 48-hour strike to pro
test high prices and military rule.
U.S. accused of 'undermining'
Jerusalem — The Israeli government yesterday
accused th'e United States of "undermining the
Middle East arms balance" by agreeing to Sell
warplanes to Saudi Arabia and Egypt as well as to
Israel.
Cabinet Secretary Arish Naor, reading a state
ment to reporters after a cabinet meeting, said the
government feels the plane sales may "lead to a
further hardening of the Arab political position,
which remains inflexible and uncompromising in
any case."
Outside the cabinet room, several hundred Is
raelis shouted demands that the government of
Prime Minister Menachem Begin soften its own
negotiating stand in Israeli-Egyptian peace talks.
World leaders seek arms cuts
United Nations — World leaders meet here this
week for a special U.N. conference to seek ways of
trimming global arms spending— now budgeted
at nearly $400 billion a year, or double what it was
just over a decade ago.
The United States and the Soviet Union, which
together account for more than half the annual

total spent on arms, are likely to bear the brunt of
criticism from Third World leaders. Those leaders
want to see a substantial portion of weapons ex
penditures diverted to development.
The five-week General Assembly session, start
ing tomorrow, also will focus on ways to halt the
spread of nuclear weapons. That issue is close to
the heart of the Carter administration, which is
sending a high-powered delegation to the U.N.
talks.
UC regents rebuff protests
San Francisco — Rebuffing protests over South
African apartheid, the University of California re
gents voted Friday against creating a committee to
advise them on "social responsibility" on invest
ments.
The proposal, backed by Democratic Gov. Ed
mund Brown Jr., his appointees to the board, and
UC President David Saxon, failed on a 10-10 tie
vote, with several regents absent. All Brown ap
pointees voted yes and all apointees of former
Republican Gov. Ronald Reagan voted no.
Supporters said they would try again for passage
in September. Both Saxon and Brown predicted
the plan eventually would pass.
The regents also refused to delay new 1979 ad
missions standards that critics say will hurt
minorities.

to kill as many as they could" before being driven
out by French and Belgian troops.
"If the French had landed one day earlier there
probably would have been fewer victims," an Ita
lian refugee told reporters. "But if they had landed
one day later it would have been a real massacre."
A nun identified only as "Sister Helena" said:
"We were subjected to the worst kind of vio
lence." A 20-year-old Belgian woman said she was
raped eight times by rebel soldiers.
According to French and Belgian accounts, re
bels killed about 100 whites and 150 blacks during
their eight-day rampage at Kolwezi. French parat
roopers, followed by their Belgian counterparts,
broke the siege in weekend assaults and freed
survivors of the 2500-strong colony of Europeans
and Americans.
Church roof collapse kills one
Garland, Texas — A church roof collapsed under
tons of water from an overnight rainstorm yester
day as worshippers bowed their heads in prayer. A
9-year-old girl was killed, and 57 other persons
were injured, the city manager's office said.
Twelve of the injured were still in hospitals last
night, five in critical condition, officials said.
Mike Cain, 18, a survivor, pulled debris from his
pockets as he described the collapse.
"We heard just an explosion, wood cracking
and the water just kept coming. Water must have
poured down hard for at least nine seconds. It was
like being under a waterfall.
"A beam fell on a girl just two seats away from
me . . . There was a lot of screaming. I know the
little girl is dead because I saw her."
General strike expected in Peru
Lima, Peru — Troops patrolled Lima and other
Peruvian cities yesterday on the eve of a strike

expected to halt all but essential services in this
riot-torn nation of 17 million.
Peru's military government declared a state of
emergency Saturday and ruled the strike illegal,
but it appeared to be resigned to a walkout by
workers.
The strike will follow a week of violence in which
17 persons were reported killed, scores injured
and hundreds arrested. Rioting started last Mon
day after the government announced price in
creases and other austerity measures to help the
country's troubled economy.
The CGTP — the powerful Communist-led Gen
eral Confederation of Peruvian Workers — plus
organizations representing agricultural workers,
bus drivers, printers, electricians and glass and
brewery workers called the 48-hour strike to pro
test high prices and military rule.
U.S. accused of 'undermining'
Jerusalem — The Israeli government yesterday
accused th'e United States of "undermining the
Middle East arms balance" by agreeing to Sell
warplanes to Saudi Arabia and Egypt as well as to
Israel.
Cabinet Secretary Arish Naor, reading a state
ment to reporters after a cabinet meeting, said the
government feels the plane sales may "lead to a
further hardening of the Arab political position,
which remains inflexible and uncompromising in
any case."
Outside the cabinet room, several hundred Is
raelis shouted demands that the government of
Prime Minister Menachem Begin soften its own
negotiating stand in Israeli-Egyptian peace talks.
World leaders seek arms cuts
United Nations — World leaders meet here this
week for a special U.N. conference to seek ways of
trimming global arms spending— now budgeted
at nearly $400 billion a year, or double what it was
just over a decade ago.
The United States and the Soviet Union, which
together account for more than half the annual

total spent on arms, are likely to bear the brunt of
criticism from Third World leaders. Those leaders
want to see a substantial portion of weapons ex
penditures diverted to development.
The five-week General Assembly session, start
ing tomorrow, also will focus on ways to halt the
spread of nuclear weapons. That issue is close to
the heart of the Carter administration, which is
sending a high-powered delegation to the U.N.
talks.
UC regents rebuff protests
San Francisco — Rebuffing protests over South
African apartheid, the University of California re
gents voted Friday against creating a committee to
advise them on "social responsibility" on invest
ments.
The proposal, backed by Democratic Gov. Ed
mund Brown Jr., his appointees to the board, and
UC President David Saxon, failed on a 10-10 tie
vote, with several regents absent. All Brown ap
pointees voted yes and all apointees of former
Republican Gov. Ronald Reagan voted no.
Supporters said they would try again for passage
in September. Both Saxon and Brown predicted
the plan eventually would pass.
The regents also refused to delay new 1979 ad
missions standards that critics say will hurt
minorities.
