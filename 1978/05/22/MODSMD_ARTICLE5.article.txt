# Until investment policies change
## UCCM urges pledge program boycott 
### Matt Mettler 
The United Campus Christian
Ministry (UCCM) has mailed two let
ters to each senior urging them to
boycott the Senior Pledge Program
as a way of expressing their concern
over the University's investment pol
icy.
The first letter, written by a group
of graduating seniors unaffiliated
with the UCCM, was enclosed in a
UCCM mailing. The letter urges
seniors to "boycott all University
fundraising drives, particularly the
Senior Pledge Program" until "the
trustees and administration respond
to the community and adopt a re
sponsible investment policy."
Elfie Forbes, co-author of the let
ter, said "we feel that as a minimum,
the trustees should vote their corpo
rate proxies for withdrawal."
The second letter, written by
UCCM chairman Hope Raymond,
was included with the other letter. It
said the UCCM "strongly endorses"
the position of Forbes, et al.
SCRIP not involved
SCRIP spokesperson Charlie Hus
kins said SCRIP had not been in
volved in the boycott. "The boycott
has not been brought up at any of our
meetings, but it isn't something we
haven't endorsed," he said.
There are two senior pledge prog
rams, according to Jonathan Mills, a
volunteer for the engineering pledge
program. One has been operated for
several years by students who solicit

engineering seniors, and the other
program was started this year by the
School of Humanities and Sciences
to cover all other graduating seniors.
Mills said he was "outraged and
angered" by the fact that the UCCM
was involved in trying to boycott stu
dent fund raising efforts.
"To me the boycott is particularly
galling. I'm Christian and have a
strong feeling that it is the church's
job to take political stands when the
moral basis is really clear," Mills said.
Mills said he agreed with the polit
ical stand of the UCCM in regard to
investments in South Africa, but he
saw "no relationship" between the
pledge program and the actions of
the Board of Trustees.
"They are treatingthe University as
a monolith, where a bad decision at
the top leads to a general attack on
the institution," Mills said.
"The engineering pledge program
is a student program," Mills said. The
money raised goes into the engineer
ing department's discretionary fund
for purchase of student-oriented
items not included in the regular
budget, he said.
Demise not wished
Byron Bland, a UCCM minister in
volved in the boycott campaign,
stated he "did not wish the demise of
the Senior Pledge Program nor the
subversion of the education of future
Stanford students, only to communi
cate as strongly as possible our con
cern."

Mills said as far as he knew, the
pledge programs were singled out
because they were "convenient and
vulnerable."
"Arguments that a boycott might
somehow influence the trustees are
poppycock because the pledge fund
is small and has no bearing on the
basic operating budget,"he said.
Forbes said she could see why
Mills would be angered by the
boycott. However, she said "the
Board of Trustees are responsible for
the University; they are not an iso
lated entity." In addition, "all dona
tions affect the University's budget,"
she said.

The boycott is an effective way for
graduating seniors to express their
opinions, Forbes said. "Equally im
portant is that people who don't con
tribute write a letter and say why. We
are not trying to give people a gen
eral excuse not to give money to the
University," she said.
)ohn Lind, UCCM vice chairman,
said he "will urge the steering com
mittee to put Mr. Mills on the agenda
for their next board meeting."
Mills said he would like to talk to
the UCCM and try to dissuade them
from continuing the boycott. He
added that he didn't think the
boycott would have a large effect.

kins said SCRIP had not been in
volved in the boycott. "The boycott
has not been brought up at any of our
meetings, but it isn't something we
haven't endorsed," he said.
There are two senior pledge prog
rams, according to Jonathan Mills, a
volunteer for the engineering pledge
program. One has been operated for
several years by students who solicit

engineering seniors, and the other
program was started this year by the
School of Humanities and Sciences
to cover all other graduating seniors.
Mills said he was "outraged and
angered" by the fact that the UCCM
was involved in trying to boycott stu
dent fund raising efforts.
"To me the boycott is particularly
galling. I'm Christian and have a
strong feeling that it is the church's
job to take political stands when the
moral basis is really clear," Mills said.
Mills said he agreed with the polit
ical stand of the UCCM in regard to
investments in South Africa, but he
saw "no relationship" between the
pledge program and the actions of
the Board of Trustees.
"They are treatingthe University as
a monolith, where a bad decision at
the top leads to a general attack on
the institution," Mills said.
"The engineering pledge program
is a student program," Mills said. The
money raised goes into the engineer
ing department's discretionary fund
for purchase of student-oriented
items not included in the regular
budget, he said.
Demise not wished
Byron Bland, a UCCM minister in
volved in the boycott campaign,
stated he "did not wish the demise of
the Senior Pledge Program nor the
subversion of the education of future
Stanford students, only to communi
cate as strongly as possible our con
cern."

Mills said as far as he knew, the
pledge programs were singled out
because they were "convenient and
vulnerable."
"Arguments that a boycott might
somehow influence the trustees are
poppycock because the pledge fund
is small and has no bearing on the
basic operating budget,"he said.
Forbes said she could see why
Mills would be angered by the
boycott. However, she said "the
Board of Trustees are responsible for
the University; they are not an iso
lated entity." In addition, "all dona
tions affect the University's budget,"
she said.

The boycott is an effective way for
graduating seniors to express their
opinions, Forbes said. "Equally im
portant is that people who don't con
tribute write a letter and say why. We
are not trying to give people a gen
eral excuse not to give money to the
University," she said.
)ohn Lind, UCCM vice chairman,
said he "will urge the steering com
mittee to put Mr. Mills on the agenda
for their next board meeting."
Mills said he would like to talk to
the UCCM and try to dissuade them
from continuing the boycott. He
added that he didn't think the
boycott would have a large effect.
The United Campus Christian
Ministry (UCCM) has mailed two let
ters to each senior urging them to
boycott the Senior Pledge Program
as a way of expressing their concern
over the University's investment pol
icy.
The first letter, written by a group
of graduating seniors unaffiliated
with the UCCM, was enclosed in a
UCCM mailing. The letter urges
seniors to "boycott all University
fundraising drives, particularly the
Senior Pledge Program" until "the
trustees and administration respond
to the community and adopt a re
sponsible investment policy."
Elfie Forbes, co-author of the let
ter, said "we feel that as a minimum,
the trustees should vote their corpo
rate proxies for withdrawal."
The second letter, written by
UCCM chairman Hope Raymond,
was included with the other letter. It
said the UCCM "strongly endorses"
the position of Forbes, et al.
SCRIP not involved
