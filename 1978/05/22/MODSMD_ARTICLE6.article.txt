# New MCAT scores to be thrown out

### Randy Keith 
Standardized test scores for nearly
30,000 pre-medical students across
the nation were miscalculated by the
company which administered the
tests, according to information re
ceived by medical schools Thursday.
Admissions officers here and at
other Bay Area medical schools were
told to disregard scores reported
after the April 15 administration of
the Medical College Admissions Test
(MCAT). They were given no reason
for throwing out the results.
The American Association of Med
ical Colleges (AAMC) administers the
test through the American College
Testing Program.
Spokesmen at both organizations
refused to comment on the prob
lems with the test, saying a statement
will be released today.
Anne Coxon, assistant director of
the Academic Information Center,
said she had spoken with people at
the AAMC and was told that the error
was "widespread." They said the
scores would be recalculated, new
results should be sent to students
and medical schools about June 1.
A spokesperson at the Medical
School said the problems with grad
ing the MCAT would not affect the
admissions process for the 1979-80
academic year because the corrected
scores would arrive before the date
applications will be accepted.
The Medical School has finished its
admission process for this fall's class
and they won't begin accepting ap
plications for the 1979-80 school year
until June 15, the spokesperson said.
About 240 pre-medical students
took the exam here and none will be
notified about the misgrading, ac
cording to Coxon. Instead, an expla
nation will be included with the cor
rected scores sent in June, she said.
Coxon added that it was unclear
which way the scores would change.
"The people I talked to seemed to
think it would be in a lot of different
ways," she said.
