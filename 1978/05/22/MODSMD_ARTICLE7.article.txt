# University alum, USIA official convicted of spying for Vietnam
## 
### 
A federal jury in Alexandria, Va., convicted David
Troung, a Vietnamese Stanford graduate, and Ronald
Humphrey, a former U.S. Information Agency official,
Friday of spying for Vietnam in 1976 and 1977.
The pair was found guilty by the jury of six men and six
women on six of the seven counts in the indictment
against them. Each man could be sentenced to life in
prison.
Their lawyers said they would appeal the conviction to
the Supreme Court.
Humphrey was accused of stealing sensitive docu
ments from the U.S. Information Agency and giving
them to Troung who has lived in this country for 13
years.
The indictment stated Troung then passed the docu
ments to a courier for relay to Vietnamese diplomats in
Paris. The courier was an informant for the CIA and the
FBI working as a double-agent.
Troung, the son of an anti-war politician who finished
second in the 1967 presidential election in South Viet
nam, graduated from here with a political science de
gree in 1968. He was an active anti-war speaker and
charged that his father, Troung Dinh Dzu, was harassed
by the Thieu/Ky regime in Saigon.

Throughout the 12 days of testimony, both defendants
argued they were merely trying to promote better U.S.-
Vietnamese relations by releasing what they considered
low-grade "diplomatic chit-chat" materials.
Judge Albert Bryan Jr. said he would hear arguments
on motions for a new trial and other legal issues on June
23 and at that time would set a date for sentencing. In the
meantime, he said, he will ask for a probation report on
both men.
Bryan ruled that key information from warrantless
searches and electronic surveillance could be used in
the case. President Jimmy Carter and Attorney General
Griffin Bell had approved the use of such information
gathering.
Defense attorneys said one appeal will seek to deter
mine for the first time in federal court whether the pres
ident and attorney general can authorize wiretaps and
other surveillance without a court warrant in a national
security investigation.
The two men were arrested Jan. 31. Troung was re
leased from jail on April 14 after his sister and other
friends and charitable organizations posted bail of
$250,000. Humphrey, who resigned his job in mid-
February, has been held in jail in lieu of $150,000 bond.
