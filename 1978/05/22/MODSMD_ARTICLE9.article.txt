Wrong people aided
Some sort of college tuition aid is bound to be forced
through Congress this year. Despite evidence that in
comes have actually been rising faster than college
costs, the plaints of middle-class parents have moved a
majority in Congress to action. President Carter has
wisely threatened to veto any automatic tax credit that
includes help for "those who need it least."
But his resistance alone is not enough. There is still
time, though not much, to design legislation that aims
the aid at those who need it most in a program that
provides for continuing Congressional supervision.
Two packages are now competing for Congressional
attention. One, involving tuition tax credits, would
allow all parents to deduct up to $500 per college student
from their income-tax payments. The other, known as
educational opportunity grants, would extend existing
Federal aid programs to families earning up to $30,000.
Loans would be available tor students from families
with still larger incomes. Of the two, the grant approach
supported by the President is much to be preferred.
Education grants would remain tied to a concept of
need. By contrast, all students, regardless of whether
their parents earn $20,000 or $200,000 would be eligible
for the tax credit Supporters of the credit brush aside
the distinction, noting that only a modest amount of it
would go to the truly affluent.
But that is sophistry; the only reason few rich people
would be helped by a tax credit is that there aren't very
many rich people. The real issue remains: Why give any
such welfare payment to people who can easily.afford to
pay their own way.
The champions of tax credits also emphasize the
simplicity of their approach. Educational opportunity
grants must be applied for, they point out; applicants
may have to prove their eligibility. With tax credits, there
would be no messy forms to fill out, and no bureaucrats
to process them. Just a few extra lines on the income tax
form would do the job.
But in the struggle to retain control over Federal ex
penditures, some things are simply too simple. A tax
credit is just as much an expenditure as any other item in
the budget, except that it is rarely reviewed by Congress.
Hundreds of billions of dollars are already passed out
annually in the form of forgiven tax liability. Adding
college tuition credits to the list would be one more step
toward losing political control of Federal expenditures.
Tuition credits and expanded grants are riding the
crest of the same wave of support. Both respond to the
same perceived need of middle-income parents. And
both can offer financial relief. But a grant program has
the significant advantage of allowing it to be directed at
those with the greatest need while always allowing the
Government to decide how much it wants to spend, and
how.
.• We hope Congress pauses long enough in this
election-year rush to appease parents to grasp the dif
ference.

Public schools hurt
Giving tax credits to all families with children in col
lege, regardless of need, would be bad enough. But a
still greater threat lurks in the companion proposal to
give tax credits for private elementary and secondary
school tuition as well. Here the issue is nothing less than
the future of public education.
Such rebates would put the Federal Government in
the business of encouraging parents to withdraw their
children from the public schools. It would turn back the
clock more than a century to a time when the "poor
schools" werethe only instruments of public education.
Fortunately, the House Ways and Means Committee
has striken lower-grade tuition aid from the college-aid
bill. But the momentum that was building for this mis
guided legislation shows that the threat remains real.
The idea could reappear on the floor of the House or,
under pressure from the Senate, in the joint conference
that will shape the final bill.
Parents have every right to send their children to
non-public schools. They have no claim to a subsidy for
exercising that right. Such a subsidy would be a"pre
mium paid with tax refunds for the withdrawal of chil
dren from public schools.
Can there be any doubt, moreover, that once the
Federal Government offered such a reward, a further
subsidy would soon be demanded of state and local gov
ernments? And how long thereafter before huge num
bers of taxpayers would take their assorted tuition tax
credits and run even farther from support of the public
school budgets?
Consider also the nature of the proposed subsidies.
Four of every five private-school pupils attend Catholic,
Jewish and Protestant parochial schools. Tuition tax sub
sidy would thus amount to an unprecedented Federal
subsidy of religious education.
The allocation of so much public money to religious
education would clash head-on with the principle of
keeping church and state separate. That was precisely
why the Supreme Court struck down a similar, though
far more modest, state-tax benefit five years ago.
But constitutional or not, tax credits for private school
tuition would quickly lead to the creation of two sepa
rate but unequal tax-supported school systems. The pri
vate schools would siphon off increasing numbers of
middle-class pupils, leaving the public schools with the
poor and the rejected.
Public schools have trouble enough. Whatever their
deficiencies, they remain the best hope for keeping
opportunity open to all. They need more support, not
more competition. And so do the urban centers, which
will never recover without free and flourishing public
education.

Federal aid programs to families earning up to $30,000.
Loans would be available tor students from families
with still larger incomes. Of the two, the grant approach
supported by the President is much to be preferred.
Education grants would remain tied to a concept of
need. By contrast, all students, regardless of whether
their parents earn $20,000 or $200,000 would be eligible
for the tax credit Supporters of the credit brush aside
the distinction, noting that only a modest amount of it
would go to the truly affluent.
But that is sophistry; the only reason few rich people
would be helped by a tax credit is that there aren't very
many rich people. The real issue remains: Why give any
such welfare payment to people who can easily.afford to
pay their own way.
The champions of tax credits also emphasize the
simplicity of their approach. Educational opportunity
grants must be applied for, they point out; applicants
may have to prove their eligibility. With tax credits, there
would be no messy forms to fill out, and no bureaucrats
to process them. Just a few extra lines on the income tax
form would do the job.
But in the struggle to retain control over Federal ex
penditures, some things are simply too simple. A tax
credit is just as much an expenditure as any other item in
the budget, except that it is rarely reviewed by Congress.
Hundreds of billions of dollars are already passed out
annually in the form of forgiven tax liability. Adding
college tuition credits to the list would be one more step
toward losing political control of Federal expenditures.
Tuition credits and expanded grants are riding the
crest of the same wave of support. Both respond to the
same perceived need of middle-income parents. And
both can offer financial relief. But a grant program has
the significant advantage of allowing it to be directed at
those with the greatest need while always allowing the
Government to decide how much it wants to spend, and
how.
.• We hope Congress pauses long enough in this
election-year rush to appease parents to grasp the dif
ference.

Public schools hurt
Giving tax credits to all families with children in col
lege, regardless of need, would be bad enough. But a
still greater threat lurks in the companion proposal to
give tax credits for private elementary and secondary
school tuition as well. Here the issue is nothing less than
the future of public education.
Such rebates would put the Federal Government in
the business of encouraging parents to withdraw their
children from the public schools. It would turn back the
clock more than a century to a time when the "poor
schools" werethe only instruments of public education.
Fortunately, the House Ways and Means Committee
has striken lower-grade tuition aid from the college-aid
bill. But the momentum that was building for this mis
guided legislation shows that the threat remains real.
The idea could reappear on the floor of the House or,
under pressure from the Senate, in the joint conference
that will shape the final bill.
Parents have every right to send their children to
non-public schools. They have no claim to a subsidy for
exercising that right. Such a subsidy would be a"pre
mium paid with tax refunds for the withdrawal of chil
dren from public schools.
Can there be any doubt, moreover, that once the
Federal Government offered such a reward, a further
subsidy would soon be demanded of state and local gov
ernments? And how long thereafter before huge num
bers of taxpayers would take their assorted tuition tax
credits and run even farther from support of the public
school budgets?
Consider also the nature of the proposed subsidies.
Four of every five private-school pupils attend Catholic,
Jewish and Protestant parochial schools. Tuition tax sub
sidy would thus amount to an unprecedented Federal
subsidy of religious education.
The allocation of so much public money to religious
education would clash head-on with the principle of
keeping church and state separate. That was precisely
why the Supreme Court struck down a similar, though
far more modest, state-tax benefit five years ago.
But constitutional or not, tax credits for private school
tuition would quickly lead to the creation of two sepa
rate but unequal tax-supported school systems. The pri
vate schools would siphon off increasing numbers of
middle-class pupils, leaving the public schools with the
poor and the rejected.
Public schools have trouble enough. Whatever their
deficiencies, they remain the best hope for keeping
opportunity open to all. They need more support, not
more competition. And so do the urban centers, which
will never recover without free and flourishing public
education.

Wrong people aided
Some sort of college tuition aid is bound to be forced
through Congress this year. Despite evidence that in
comes have actually been rising faster than college
costs, the plaints of middle-class parents have moved a
majority in Congress to action. President Carter has
wisely threatened to veto any automatic tax credit that
includes help for "those who need it least."
But his resistance alone is not enough. There is still
time, though not much, to design legislation that aims
the aid at those who need it most in a program that
provides for continuing Congressional supervision.
Two packages are now competing for Congressional
attention. One, involving tuition tax credits, would
allow all parents to deduct up to $500 per college student
from their income-tax payments. The other, known as
educational opportunity grants, would extend existing
Federal aid programs to families earning up to $30,000.
Loans would be available tor students from families
with still larger incomes. Of the two, the grant approach
