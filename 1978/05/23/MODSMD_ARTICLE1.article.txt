## 
### Randy Keith 
There's no way to go but up. At
least that's the case with corrected
scores for pre-meds who took the
MCAT test in April.
"In all cases the revised grade will
be greater than the one (students)
received in the mail," said Charles
Fentress, spokesman for the Ameri
can Association of Medical Colleges
(AAMC), which administers the test.
"We anticipate that the change will
not begreaterthan one point and the
problem was not in any one subsec
tion but scattered throughout the
test," he added.
Nearly 30,000 people nationwide
took the test April 15 and at least 90
per cent of the tests were misgraded,
according to Fentress.
New grades will be mailed to
pre-meds who took the test by June
10 and the problem will not affect
medical schools' application proces
ses.
Fentress said that students who
will be leaving school or changing
the address given to the testing ser
vice when they took the exam should
write immediately to MCAT Records.
