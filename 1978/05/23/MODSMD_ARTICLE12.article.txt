# Collective ethical stance needed
## Crucial issue sidestepped 
### 
Rev. Manfred Bahmann

As one of the organizers of the
Senior Pledge Program, Jonathan
Mills must obviously have many frus
trating experiences. This is under
standable. Presumably he must have
been aware of that before accepting
this particular assignment. His per
sonal attack on Rev. Byron Bland of
the United Christian Campus Minis
try, however, is not only unwar
ranted. It is naive and petty.
Mills accuses Bland and the UCCM
board of "having clearly abused their
powers, using their funds and special
mailing privileges given them for dis
seminating the Gospel of Christ to
mail out one-sided political litera
ture." He is particularly incensed

over the alleged misuse of the non
profit postage permit.
He seems to overlook the simple
fact that it is the U.S. postal service
which issues these permits to anyone
who complies with its own rules.
Whether we like it or not, the U.S.
mail could not care less about the
gospel or Jesus Christ.
A quick phone call to the local
postmaster would have provided
Mills with all the pertinent informa
tion and could have saved him a lot of
personal embarrassment before writ
ing his diatribe.
Although Mills shows a peculiar
obsession with mailing privileges
throughout his article, the real issue
at hand is clearly not the question of
the non-profit organization permit.
Stance on controversies
The central question is whether
Christians out of their commitment
to Christ and Christ's Good News for
the poor, hungry, and oppressed are
called to take collectively an ethical
stance on existing problems which
are politically controversial and
times highly explosive.
Jesus and the early disciples
showed a reckless disregard for the
political consequences of the mes
sage of hope they preached to those
"who are poor now, who hunger
now, who weep now, who are hated
by men now and excluded and made
fun of," and their message of doom
for those "who are rich, who are full
now, who laugh now, and of whom
all men now speak well" (Luke 6:20-
26).
Where does this message of Jesus
and the disciples put a committed
Christian on the Stanford campus,
which right now is struggling to keep
its own soul together as the interests
for maximizing one's- profit and
keeping one's own tuition to the
lowest possible minimum clash with
the poverty, hunger, tears, and the
complete exlusion by men (apar
theid) which are experienced by the
black people in South Africa? In
some of the recent rallies on campus,
we were chanting: "Which side are
you on? Which side are you on?"
In his article Millls sidesteps the
issue of a Christian responsibility to
take a collective ethical stance in
politically controversial matters. He
merely opines that the Gospel of
Christ ought to be preached and that
after this event people should be al
lowed "to make their own political
decisions in light of it."
He is certainly entitled to his own
opinion. But this does not make it
anything more than strictly a per
sonal opinion and that an opinion
not shared by the large body of
Christians who out of their commit
ment to Christ and the Good News
have collectively and clearly de
nounced the present political system
in South Africa and those who know-

ingly or unknowingly aid and sup
port it, through the World Council of
Churches, the National Council of
the Churches of Christ, and a long
list of denominational world, na
tional, and local agencies.
Results contrary to gospel
The fundamental flaw in Mills' line
of reasoning is that he naively over
looks the numerous instances in
which the preaching of a strictly
"Christ-centered" message has had
political consequences completely
contrary to the gospel of Jesus
Christ.
I have heard many black Africans
say: "The white man came and gave
us his Christ and his bible. In return
he took our land." Is this what Christ
has in mind for us? Hardly!
In my own native Germany those
Christians who under the Nazi re
gime restricted themselves to the
preaching of a strictly "Christ
centered" message were considered
to be "good Germans" by the politi
cal bosses of the day. Their silence in
the area of political ethics was cor
rectly interpreted as a tacit approval
of the Nazi system.
I am not part the the UCCM opera
tion. We Lutherans run our own
show at the Stanford Lutheran Center.
I am free to argue that picking on the
Senior Pledge Program is indeed
picking on the littlest member of the
team.
Had Mills simply stated this, he
would have made a valid point. He
also could have pointed out that the
support and endorsement which the
UCCM board gave to its own boycot
ting seniors was only one part in a
series of actions taken by the board.
But he could not leave well enough
alone. He had to invoke once more
again the asinine image created by
Tony Becker (Daily, May 8), who
compared the agony and struggle
over the South African issue to a mild
case of acne and the boycott of the
Senior Pledge to cutting off Stan
ford's head: a suprisingly unen
lightened view of the present world
for people who have spent costly
years at this university in order to be
educated.
The question on which Mills still
owes a convincing answer to the
larger Christian community and
perhaps also to himself is simply
stated: "Which side are you on?"
Once he has found that answer, he
still will have to find an effective way
to communicate it to the trustees.
Who knows? I might yet be able to
see him at one of the next SCRIP
meetings, which often wrestle with
the problem of how to communicate
with the trustees effectively, â€” be
fore he graduates.

anything more than strictly a per
sonal opinion and that an opinion
not shared by the large body of
Christians who out of their commit
ment to Christ and the Good News
have collectively and clearly de
nounced the present political system
in South Africa and those who know-

ingly or unknowingly aid and sup
port it, through the World Council of
Churches, the National Council of
the Churches of Christ, and a long
list of denominational world, na
tional, and local agencies.
Results contrary to gospel
The fundamental flaw in Mills' line
of reasoning is that he naively over
looks the numerous instances in
which the preaching of a strictly
"Christ-centered" message has had
political consequences completely
contrary to the gospel of Jesus
Christ.
I have heard many black Africans
say: "The white man came and gave
us his Christ and his bible. In return
he took our land." Is this what Christ
has in mind for us? Hardly!
In my own native Germany those
Christians who under the Nazi re
gime restricted themselves to the
preaching of a strictly "Christ
centered" message were considered
to be "good Germans" by the politi
cal bosses of the day. Their silence in
the area of political ethics was cor
rectly interpreted as a tacit approval
of the Nazi system.
I am not part the the UCCM opera
tion. We Lutherans run our own
show at the Stanford Lutheran Center.
I am free to argue that picking on the
Senior Pledge Program is indeed
picking on the littlest member of the
team.
Had Mills simply stated this, he
would have made a valid point. He
also could have pointed out that the
support and endorsement which the
UCCM board gave to its own boycot
ting seniors was only one part in a
series of actions taken by the board.
But he could not leave well enough
alone. He had to invoke once more
again the asinine image created by
Tony Becker (Daily, May 8), who
compared the agony and struggle
over the South African issue to a mild
case of acne and the boycott of the
Senior Pledge to cutting off Stan
ford's head: a suprisingly unen
lightened view of the present world
for people who have spent costly
years at this university in order to be
educated.
The question on which Mills still
owes a convincing answer to the
larger Christian community and
perhaps also to himself is simply
stated: "Which side are you on?"
Once he has found that answer, he
still will have to find an effective way
to communicate it to the trustees.
Who knows? I might yet be able to
see him at one of the next SCRIP
meetings, which often wrestle with
the problem of how to communicate
with the trustees effectively, â€” be
fore he graduates.

As one of the organizers of the
Senior Pledge Program, Jonathan
Mills must obviously have many frus
trating experiences. This is under
standable. Presumably he must have
been aware of that before accepting
this particular assignment. His per
sonal attack on Rev. Byron Bland of
the United Christian Campus Minis
try, however, is not only unwar
ranted. It is naive and petty.
Mills accuses Bland and the UCCM
board of "having clearly abused their
powers, using their funds and special
mailing privileges given them for dis
seminating the Gospel of Christ to
mail out one-sided political litera
ture." He is particularly incensed

over the alleged misuse of the non
profit postage permit.
He seems to overlook the simple
fact that it is the U.S. postal service
which issues these permits to anyone
who complies with its own rules.
Whether we like it or not, the U.S.
mail could not care less about the
gospel or Jesus Christ.
A quick phone call to the local
postmaster would have provided
Mills with all the pertinent informa
tion and could have saved him a lot of
personal embarrassment before writ
ing his diatribe.
Although Mills shows a peculiar
obsession with mailing privileges
throughout his article, the real issue
at hand is clearly not the question of
the non-profit organization permit.
Stance on controversies
The central question is whether
Christians out of their commitment
to Christ and Christ's Good News for
the poor, hungry, and oppressed are
called to take collectively an ethical
stance on existing problems which
are politically controversial and
times highly explosive.
Jesus and the early disciples
showed a reckless disregard for the
political consequences of the mes
sage of hope they preached to those
"who are poor now, who hunger
now, who weep now, who are hated
by men now and excluded and made
fun of," and their message of doom
for those "who are rich, who are full
now, who laugh now, and of whom
all men now speak well" (Luke 6:20-
26).
Where does this message of Jesus
and the disciples put a committed
Christian on the Stanford campus,
which right now is struggling to keep
its own soul together as the interests
for maximizing one's- profit and
keeping one's own tuition to the
lowest possible minimum clash with
the poverty, hunger, tears, and the
complete exlusion by men (apar
theid) which are experienced by the
black people in South Africa? In
some of the recent rallies on campus,
we were chanting: "Which side are
you on? Which side are you on?"
In his article Millls sidesteps the
issue of a Christian responsibility to
take a collective ethical stance in
politically controversial matters. He
merely opines that the Gospel of
Christ ought to be preached and that
after this event people should be al
lowed "to make their own political
decisions in light of it."
He is certainly entitled to his own
opinion. But this does not make it
anything more than strictly a per
sonal opinion and that an opinion
not shared by the large body of

ment to Christ and the Good News
