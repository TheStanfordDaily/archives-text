### Richard Rubin 
I he Faculty Club is "definitely not a boarding
house," according to its manager, Mario Sher
rer.
Located next to Tresidder Student Union, the
Faculty Club plays an important role in alumni
functions by serving as the center for alumni
dinners and meetings.
The "private club" also "provides faculty and
junior faculty of different academic fields an op
portunity to come together," Sherrer said.
Membership is usually limited to professors
and assistant professors, according to assistant
Manager Pat Heeger.
"Professors encourage assistant professors.
This is mainly achieved by lesser dues for the
assistant professor," Sherrer said.
Membership dues are $7.50 or $5.
Primarily a restaurant
The club is primarily a restaurant, although
the building does hold a few conference and

seminar rooms.
"Prices on the menu are controlled by the
limited membership," said Sherrer. "The cost of
meals does not reflect the cost of operation. We
operate under the assumption that if faced with
outside competition, the club's restaurant
would not be economically feasible."
The club is financed partly from membership
dues and partly from University revenues
supplied when special services are needed.
Sherrer said the club relies upon this extra re
venue to manage the growing needs from the
faculty community.
Students serve meals during all service func
tions.
"Student help is not normally advertised,"
Heegen said, adding "word of mouth" is usually
how students learn of employment oppor
tunities at the club.
Employment positions are usually limited to
waiters and waitresses.
