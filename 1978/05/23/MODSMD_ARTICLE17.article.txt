## dorm drama/thomas hempel 'The Three-Penny Opera': Lag puts on a good show 
### 
Kurt Weill is without a doubt
one of the most important
operatic composers of the
twentieth century. He stands
out as one of the few moderns
who has successfully bridged
the gap between composer
and audience which dooms so
many works to failure. His
techniques have influenced
virtually every contemporary

composer, including Ger
shwin, Britten, Orff, Menotti
and others. Among his two
dozen stageworks, three stand
out: "The Three Penny Opera,,
(1928), "The Rise and Fall of the
City of Mahagonny" (1930) and
"Street Scene" (1947).
Of these, the "Three Penny
Opera" is certainly the most
famous. While a relatively early

work, it already shows Weill's
style fully developed. The his
tory of the work is interesting
to relate: In the London of the
1720s Handel's Italian operas
were all the rage; John Cay and
John Pepusch capitalized on
this by writing a stunning satire
of Handel's music in particular
and society in general, entitled
"The Beggar's Opera."

Skipping ahead 200 years, to
the Berlin of the 19205, we find
Bertolt Brecht adapting Cay's
text into German. While sup
posedly set in London at the
time of Queen Victoria's coro
nation, it is really a farce about
Berlin's underworld in 1928, as
well as a commentary on Ger
man society between the wars.
The work remains very much

in repertory, and an ex
ceedingly sophisticated ver
sion was produced here by
Lagunita Court. Unlike most
musicals, this is a full opera,
and its music is as important as
its libretto. Firmly neoclassicist
in style, it shows much the un
fluence of the Parisian music
hall style. Characteristicarethe
jazzy rhythms, languid, hazy
and largely athematic orchest
ral passages, which sound oc
casionally a little like Satie, and
the percussive treatment of the
piano. The result is strong and
harsh, yet still pleasing to the
ears.
In this production, the origi
nal orchestration was followed
with slight reductions. Samuel
Bent deserves much praise for
his exciting piano playing. The
rest of the orchestra played in
terpretatively well, even
though the occasional wrong
note, and the insistently rag

ged intonation belied the
amateur nature of this produc
tion. My major objection was
that the orchestra was too dis
tant, especially in view of its
reduced size.
Dramatically, the production
was excellent. The street
singer, Rob Robinson, (who
also happens to be an associate
professor of German Studies),
more or less stole the show
with his heartfelt rendition of
the work's hit, "Mackie-
Messer." This song, which
opens and closes the show,
was properly done in German
to fully convey its melancholy.
The heroine, Polly Peachum,
played by Gretchen Steffy-
Bond, displayed a beautiful
voice, especially in "Pirate
Jenny."
The climax of the work oc
curs in the finale where the
hero is about to be hung, and
he receives a purposefully con

trived reprieve, supposedly
because this is opera. How
ever, the audience was quickly
informed by Mr. Peachum
(Lyle Ungar) that in real life
things don't happen this way
and that tragedy is the rule. The
entire scene was played with
great feeling by all, but by
Ungar in particular.
The acting was generally bet
ter than the singing. Several
singers simply lacked the pro
jection and brilliance needed
to cope with the more difficult
passages.
To summarize, Lagunita has
given an interpretatively excel
lent production of one of hte
operatic masterpieces of the
century. Though it was a non
professional production, the
drama and simple musical
pleasure the company drew
from the work and provided
for the audience was truly
breathtaking.

informed by Mr. Peachum
(Lyle Ungar) that in real life
things don't happen this way
and that tragedy is the rule. The
entire scene was played with
great feeling by all, but by
Ungar in particular.
The acting was generally bet
ter than the singing. Several
singers simply lacked the pro
jection and brilliance needed
to cope with the more difficult
passages.
To summarize, Lagunita has
given an interpretatively excel
lent production of one of hte
operatic masterpieces of the
century. Though it was a non
professional production, the
drama and simple musical
pleasure the company drew
from the work and provided
for the audience was truly
breathtaking.
Kurt Weill is without a doubt
one of the most important
operatic composers of the
twentieth century. He stands
out as one of the few moderns
who has successfully bridged
the gap between composer
and audience which dooms so
many works to failure. His
techniques have influenced
virtually every contemporary

composer, including Ger
shwin, Britten, Orff, Menotti
and others. Among his two
dozen stageworks, three stand
out: "The Three Penny Opera,,
(1928), "The Rise and Fall of the
City of Mahagonny" (1930) and
"Street Scene" (1947).
Of these, the "Three Penny
Opera" is certainly the most
famous. While a relatively early

work, it already shows Weill's
style fully developed. The his
tory of the work is interesting
to relate: In the London of the
1720s Handel's Italian operas
were all the rage; John Cay and
John Pepusch capitalized on
this by writing a stunning satire
of Handel's music in particular
and society in general, entitled
"The Beggar's Opera."

Skipping ahead 200 years, to
the Berlin of the 19205, we find
Bertolt Brecht adapting Cay's
text into German. While sup
posedly set in London at the
time of Queen Victoria's coro
nation, it is really a farce about
Berlin's underworld in 1928, as
well as a commentary on Ger
man society between the wars.
The work remains very much

in repertory, and an ex
ceedingly sophisticated ver
sion was produced here by
Lagunita Court. Unlike most
musicals, this is a full opera,
and its music is as important as
its libretto. Firmly neoclassicist
in style, it shows much the un
fluence of the Parisian music
hall style. Characteristicarethe
jazzy rhythms, languid, hazy
and largely athematic orchest
ral passages, which sound oc
casionally a little like Satie, and
the percussive treatment of the
piano. The result is strong and
harsh, yet still pleasing to the
ears.
In this production, the origi
nal orchestration was followed
with slight reductions. Samuel
Bent deserves much praise for
his exciting piano playing. The
rest of the orchestra played in
terpretatively well, even
though the occasional wrong
note, and the insistently rag

ged intonation belied the
amateur nature of this produc
tion. My major objection was
that the orchestra was too dis
tant, especially in view of its
reduced size.
Dramatically, the production
was excellent. The street
singer, Rob Robinson, (who
also happens to be an associate
professor of German Studies),
more or less stole the show
with his heartfelt rendition of
the work's hit, "Mackie-
Messer." This song, which
opens and closes the show,
was properly done in German
to fully convey its melancholy.
The heroine, Polly Peachum,
played by Gretchen Steffy-
Bond, displayed a beautiful
voice, especially in "Pirate
Jenny."
The climax of the work oc
curs in the finale where the
hero is about to be hung, and
he receives a purposefully con

trived reprieve, supposedly
because this is opera. How
ever, the audience was quickly
informed by Mr. Peachum
(Lyle Ungar) that in real life
things don't happen this way
and that tragedy is the rule. The
entire scene was played with
great feeling by all, but by
