Throughout the history of
jazz, the popular song has
served as a source of inspira
tion to countless musicians.
One of the most salient fea
tures of much new jazz is the
unexplicable aversion many ar
tists show to pop songs. Keith
Jarrett, Chick Corea, Miles
Davis and many others have
rarely, in recent years, tried
their hand at re-interpreting
the standards.
It is perhaps the jazz artist's
attempt to achieve serious rec
ognition that has prompted
this change. To play pop songs
is, according to many jazz ar
tists, to play pop music. But the
difference is, in fact, a vast one.
The true jazz artist — aTatum, a
Coltrane, a Pres — is able to
make the material take on
added dimensions regardless
of how banal the original may
be.
Nowhere is this more appa
rent than in the "Eccentricities
of Earl Dant," the newest re
lease from Art Lande (pro
nounced Land-ee). Lande has
long been considered one of
the avant-garde, and thus his
album of jazz standards was
quite a surprise. Yet after lis

tening to his latest album, it
becomes immediately clear
that Lande transforms these
songs into mini-masterpieces.
Taking songs by Gershwin,
Kern, Rogers and others,
Lande uses the tunes as a
springboard for improvisations
in the style of jarrett and
Corea. His style is contrapuntal
— he is one of the few jazz
pianists who thinks in terms of
multi-layered melody lines. His
off-beat bass lines and high re
gister melodies are fantasti
cally conceived. On "Star
Eyes," Lande moves walking
chords in the middle register
and works on slow melodic
lines high above them — the
effect is original and very pow
erful.
Other cuts are equally suc
cessful, particularly "Sweet
Georgia Brown," and "All the
Things You Are." Lande is a
local talent who greatly de
serves wider recognition. His
work for the ECM label has
been excellent but generally
overlooked. The "Eccen
tricities of Earl Dant" is on the
Arch Street label. 1750 Arch
Street is rapidly becoming the
most daring label in Northern
California. Their new Lande re
lease is perhaps the unrecog
nized masterpiece of the year.

Eddie Jefferson <
The Main Man
Inner City
Eddie Jefferson has estab
lished himself as the most in
genious member of a neg
lected branch of jazz singing.
Jefferson takes famous jazz
pieces and adds vocals to them
— not only to the melody but
also to the often complex im
provisations. His vocal ver

sions of Charlie Parker's
"Now's the Time" and Miles'
"So What" are classics in which
he uses the lyrics to
make a commentary on the
music and artists.
The crux of Jefferson's ap
proach is this: the lyrics and

more songs in his inimitable
style. His voice is unconven
tional — perhaps even more so
than that of rock stars such as
Jagger, Newman or Stewart.
Yet like Jagger his voice is un
deniably fitting to his style. As
one friend of mine commented
— "If it weren't for jazz, he
would be out of a job."
Thealbum is generally excel
lent, but my personal favorites
are Jefferson's version of
James Moody's "I'm in the
Mood for Love," and Charlie
Parker's "Confirmation." By
relying heavily on jazz tradition
Jefferson risks losing today's
uninformed jazz audience.
This is unfortunate; to define
jazz singing by the work of
Flora Purim or Al Jarreau is to
miss much of the pleasure of
traditional jazz singing. Jeffer
son, while not a true
traditionalist, is a happy
medium and perhaps an excel
lent introduction to the multi
faceted aspects of jazz singing.

Other cuts are equally suc
cessful, particularly "Sweet

local talent who greatly de
serves wider recognition. His
work for the ECM label has
been excellent but generally
overlooked. The "Eccen
tricities of Earl Dant" is on the
Arch Street label. 1750 Arch

Eddie Jefferson <
The Main Man
Inner City
Eddie Jefferson has estab
lished himself as the most in
genious member of a neg
lected branch of jazz singing.
Jefferson takes famous jazz
pieces and adds vocals to them
— not only to the melody but
also to the often complex im
provisations. His vocal ver

sions of Charlie Parker's
"Now's the Time" and Miles'
"So What" are classics in which
he uses the lyrics to
make a commentary on the
music and artists.
The crux of Jefferson's ap
proach is this: the lyrics and

more songs in his inimitable
style. His voice is unconven
tional — perhaps even more so
than that of rock stars such as
Jagger, Newman or Stewart.
Yet like Jagger his voice is un
deniably fitting to his style. As
one friend of mine commented
— "If it weren't for jazz, he
would be out of a job."
Thealbum is generally excel
lent, but my personal favorites
are Jefferson's version of
James Moody's "I'm in the
Mood for Love," and Charlie
Parker's "Confirmation." By
relying heavily on jazz tradition
Jefferson risks losing today's
uninformed jazz audience.
This is unfortunate; to define
jazz singing by the work of
Flora Purim or Al Jarreau is to
miss much of the pleasure of
traditional jazz singing. Jeffer
son, while not a true
traditionalist, is a happy
medium and perhaps an excel
lent introduction to the multi
faceted aspects of jazz singing.

Throughout the history of
jazz, the popular song has
served as a source of inspira
tion to countless musicians.
One of the most salient fea
tures of much new jazz is the
unexplicable aversion many ar
tists show to pop songs. Keith
Jarrett, Chick Corea, Miles
Davis and many others have
rarely, in recent years, tried
their hand at re-interpreting
the standards.
It is perhaps the jazz artist's
attempt to achieve serious rec
ognition that has prompted
this change. To play pop songs
is, according to many jazz ar
tists, to play pop music. But the
difference is, in fact, a vast one.
The true jazz artist — aTatum, a
Coltrane, a Pres — is able to
make the material take on
added dimensions regardless
of how banal the original may
be.
Nowhere is this more appa
rent than in the "Eccentricities
of Earl Dant," the newest re
lease from Art Lande (pro
nounced Land-ee). Lande has
long been considered one of
the avant-garde, and thus his
album of jazz standards was
quite a surprise. Yet after lis

tening to his latest album, it
becomes immediately clear
that Lande transforms these
songs into mini-masterpieces.
Taking songs by Gershwin,
Kern, Rogers and others,
Lande uses the tunes as a
springboard for improvisations
in the style of jarrett and
Corea. His style is contrapuntal
— he is one of the few jazz
pianists who thinks in terms of
multi-layered melody lines. His
off-beat bass lines and high re
gister melodies are fantasti
cally conceived. On "Star
Eyes," Lande moves walking
chords in the middle register
and works on slow melodic
lines high above them — the
effect is original and very pow
erful.
Other cuts are equally suc
cessful, particularly "Sweet
Georgia Brown," and "All the
Things You Are." Lande is a
local talent who greatly de
serves wider recognition. His
work for the ECM label has
been excellent but generally
