# Two fraternities may miss their quotas

### Richard Rubin 
Two of the 13 fraternities on campus are not
likely to meet their housing quotas for this year,
according to Inter-Fraternity Council President
Reid Butler and other fraternity spokesmen.
Both the Phi Delta Theta (Phi Delts) fraternity
and the Theta Xi fraternity had no problem filling
vacancies, but fell short of the necessary number
of "sophomore equivalents" needed to satisfy
University regulations, said Theta Xi President
Rich Johnson, and Phi Delts Co-Rush Chairman
Mike Kavoukjian.
A house can be full, yet not meet its pledge
quota requirement. This happens when a house
retains its older members, rather than recruiting
new members who represent quota points.
A rushee with two years guaranteed housing
counts as one sophomore equivalent, while a
rushee with one year of guaranteed housing
counts as only half a sophomore equivalent.
Under the guaranteed housing system, frater
nities become liable for the housing needs of 16.3
per cent of the University's male population. That
percentage is converted into sophomore equiva
lent points.
This year 239.5 sophomore equivalents were al
loted to the fraternity system to be filled. Under
this system, a freshman with two years of guaran
teed housing equals one sophomore equivalent
point while a sophomore with only one year
guaranteed housing counts as half an equivalent.
Unofficial results show "that Phi Delts and Theta
Xi missed their respective allotted points of 21.5
and 11.5 by small margins.
Official fraternity pledge results will be released
from the Row House office tomorrow. At this time
last year eight of the 13 fraternities here had not
met their quotas either. However, six of those

fraternities later filled their quotas.
This would be the second year in a row that
Theta Xi fraternity has failed to satisfy their pledge
quota obligation. Under University guidelines, if a
house fails to meet its quota for three out of four
consecutive years, it becomes subject to being
placed in the draw system.
Johnson said this year's failure would place Xi in
a "pressure position" next year. If the house does
not meet its quota next year, the third year in a
row, it will be subject to examination by Dean of
Residential Education Norm Robinson.
For the Phi Delts, this year's failure would be the
second in three non-consecutive years.
Robinson said failure to meet the pledge quota
three years in a row does not automatically mean a
house will be placed in the draw. But he said he felt
the quota system "gives a responsible amount of
time for a house to turn around."
Many fraternity members said they did not think
three out of four consecutive years is an ample
amount of time for a fraternity to recover from a
low pledge quota period.
Inter-Fraternity Council Rush Chairman Mark
Triska said he felt "other variables should be in
cluded in the quota system."
Alpha Delta Phi President Mark Donnelly said
"the (draw) system hasn't been revamped or
changed." He added, "it's not really fair. All
fraternities have weak and strong periods. It's un
justified to kick a house into the draw on the basis
of three years.
"The only way to tell if a house should be put in
the draw is if it shows a marked decrease for a
number of years," Donnelly said.
The basic aim of the quota system is to "have
fraternities sharing an equal proportion of Univer
sity housing with the draw system," said Robin

son.
He added he would rather operate with an ex
cess of student demand to insure that the existing
fraternities are healthy and not marginally filled.
However, Robinson said that "demand for frater
nities has stabilized" this year.
Butler, however, said, "the fraternity system is a
strong system."
Triska added that "the system as a whole was
way over quota this year. Theta Xi and the Phi Delts
missed by only a small amount, while a lot of
houses went way over quota."
Donnelly said he feels that the quota system
itself serves as a deterrent to fraternity popularity.
He said he felt that rushees feel they only repre
sent "quota points," and so all interest in rushees
seems superficial.
He said psychologically, "this is a disincentive to
a good rush. It definitely puts extra strain and
pressure on making one's quota."
Butler said he did not think the "University is Out
to get the fraternities. I feel that there is more of a
spirit of cooperation with the University."
"It is hard to say if the numbers have done their
job, it's been hard to say how effective the quota
system has been,"he added.
Alongside general concern with the fraternity
system there have come definite notes of support
and enthusiasm. Butler said, "We really want to
provide a spot for everyone who wants a spot. We
don't want to become too exclusive."
If official pledge quota results show either that
the Theta Xi fraternity or the Phi Delta Theta frater
nity did not meet their quotas, both houses will
come under increasing pressure next year.
Both fraternities will have to fulfill their quotas
next year or be placed under examination from the
University.
