## More Television, more Tull 
### 
When their first album,
"Masque Moon," was re
leased, it seemed that Televi
sion was headed on a course of
long, coarse tracks, some bor
dering on punk. All of which
spelled non-accessibility and
forbode little commercial suc
cess for Television (critical
acclaim abounded, however).
On this album, as if to show
everyone how easily they can
be misled, writer/groupleader
Tom Verlaine and company
have, for the most part, begun
to tread a completely different
path.
Some of the songs, notably
"Days" (note the inviting
meiody the guitars lay down in
this one) and "Carefui," are
short, hook-filled and melodi
ous, and could forseeably be
come radio hits, providing
crossover between commer
cial AM and less commercial
FM programming. Others,
especially "Carried Away,"
would not provide such cros
sover, but might become stan
dards on the mellower FM sta
tions.
Perhaps the biggest surprise
is that Valeraine seems to have
decided to "pay his dues" with
this album. "Foxhole" is very
reminiscent of The Who (com
pare it with the harder pas
sages of "Slip Kid"). "The
Fire," if one didn't know bet
ter, could be mistaken for jim
Morrison and The Doors, with

both its vocals and the dreary
melody and overall dreary im
pression it creates. Definitely
not punk style (most punkers
probably don't know where
their roots lie).
But, as if not to completely
lose sight of his earlier album,
Valeraine has included one
track, "The Dream's Dream,"
whose length and composition
(almost completely non-vocal)
render it non-commercial to
the hilt. Maybe this is Val
erate's way of paying his dues
to Television's first album. At
any rate, if "Masque Moon"
was a notable effort in its
genre, "Adventure" is a more
notable effort in its genre,
though what its genre is might
be hard to say. Perhaps "ad
venturesome?"

Last year's "Songs from the
Woods" was a change for Jet
hro Tull, having a distinctive
folk-music-meets-rock flavor.
It was also a welcome addition
to the Tull catalog. The trouble
with this year's Tull addition,
"Heavy Horses," is that it not
only deals with the same gen
eral subject matter as "Songs
from the Woods" — the En
glish countryside — but it also
sounds much like the latter,
giving the overall impression
that a more appropriate name
for "Heavy Horses" would be
"Songs from the Woods, Vol
ume 2."
About the biggest difference

one might perceive is that
overall "Horses" is harder
edged than "Woods." This,
perhaps, could mark a transi
tion of Jethro Tull back to the
type of music they had most
success with, e.g., their hard
rock era which peaked with
"Aqualung." More likely,
though, is that JethroTull's wri
ter lan Anderson has a tempor
ary fixation with this type of
music, and is attempting to
progress while remaining
within its confines.
Overall, then, the music is
about as good as that of "Songs
from the Woods," with a few
exceptions. "Acres Wild" re
calls the musically appealing
title track of the last album. The
jumpy, rock influenced "And
the Mouse Police Never
Sleeps" is reminiscent of
"Hunting Girl"from "Woods."
Only four songs on this
album do not seem re-hashed
"Woods" material. "One
Brown Mouse," while fitting in
with the style of the previous
album, could easily have been
included with that album with
out being criticized for dupli
cation (perhaps, in some way,
such as the smooth, relaxed
acoustic style, "One Brown
Mouse" is related to "One
White Dove" from the
"Minstrel in the Gallery" al
bum).
The other non-copies are the
pretty ballad "Moths," the
somewhat compelling, gener
ally soft-toned title track (an
ode to Shire horses, which are
threatened with extinction)
and the awful monotone and
monotonous "Journeyman."
Overall, the best advice
would be: if you are consider
ing getting a )ethro Tull album,
and you're not a devotee, get
"Songs from the Woods." It's
almost everything "Heavy
Horses" is, and the tunes are
generally more inviting. For
devotees: ifyougetthealbum,
be prepared — the horses are
clones.

calls the musically appealing
title track of the last album. The
jumpy, rock influenced "And
the Mouse Police Never
Sleeps" is reminiscent of
"Hunting Girl"from "Woods."
Only four songs on this
album do not seem re-hashed
"Woods" material. "One
Brown Mouse," while fitting in
with the style of the previous
album, could easily have been
included with that album with
out being criticized for dupli
cation (perhaps, in some way,
such as the smooth, relaxed
acoustic style, "One Brown
Mouse" is related to "One
White Dove" from the
"Minstrel in the Gallery" al
bum).
The other non-copies are the
pretty ballad "Moths," the
somewhat compelling, gener
ally soft-toned title track (an
ode to Shire horses, which are
threatened with extinction)
and the awful monotone and
monotonous "Journeyman."
Overall, the best advice
would be: if you are consider
ing getting a )ethro Tull album,
and you're not a devotee, get
"Songs from the Woods." It's
almost everything "Heavy
Horses" is, and the tunes are
generally more inviting. For
devotees: ifyougetthealbum,
be prepared — the horses are
clones.

When their first album,
"Masque Moon," was re
leased, it seemed that Televi
sion was headed on a course of
long, coarse tracks, some bor
dering on punk. All of which
spelled non-accessibility and
forbode little commercial suc
cess for Television (critical
acclaim abounded, however).
On this album, as if to show
everyone how easily they can
be misled, writer/groupleader
Tom Verlaine and company
have, for the most part, begun
to tread a completely different
path.
Some of the songs, notably
"Days" (note the inviting
meiody the guitars lay down in
this one) and "Carefui," are
short, hook-filled and melodi
ous, and could forseeably be
come radio hits, providing
crossover between commer
cial AM and less commercial
FM programming. Others,
especially "Carried Away,"
would not provide such cros
sover, but might become stan
dards on the mellower FM sta
tions.
Perhaps the biggest surprise
is that Valeraine seems to have
decided to "pay his dues" with
this album. "Foxhole" is very
reminiscent of The Who (com
pare it with the harder pas
sages of "Slip Kid"). "The
Fire," if one didn't know bet
ter, could be mistaken for jim
Morrison and The Doors, with

both its vocals and the dreary
melody and overall dreary im
pression it creates. Definitely
not punk style (most punkers
probably don't know where
their roots lie).
But, as if not to completely
lose sight of his earlier album,
Valeraine has included one
track, "The Dream's Dream,"
whose length and composition
(almost completely non-vocal)
render it non-commercial to
the hilt. Maybe this is Val
erate's way of paying his dues
to Television's first album. At
any rate, if "Masque Moon"
was a notable effort in its
genre, "Adventure" is a more
notable effort in its genre,
though what its genre is might
be hard to say. Perhaps "ad
venturesome?"

Last year's "Songs from the
Woods" was a change for Jet
hro Tull, having a distinctive
folk-music-meets-rock flavor.
It was also a welcome addition
to the Tull catalog. The trouble
with this year's Tull addition,
"Heavy Horses," is that it not
only deals with the same gen
eral subject matter as "Songs
from the Woods" — the En
glish countryside — but it also
sounds much like the latter,
giving the overall impression
that a more appropriate name
for "Heavy Horses" would be
"Songs from the Woods, Vol
ume 2."
About the biggest difference

one might perceive is that
overall "Horses" is harder
edged than "Woods." This,
perhaps, could mark a transi
tion of Jethro Tull back to the
type of music they had most
success with, e.g., their hard
rock era which peaked with
"Aqualung." More likely,
though, is that JethroTull's wri
ter lan Anderson has a tempor
ary fixation with this type of
music, and is attempting to
progress while remaining
within its confines.
Overall, then, the music is
about as good as that of "Songs
from the Woods," with a few
exceptions. "Acres Wild" re
calls the musically appealing
title track of the last album. The
jumpy, rock influenced "And
the Mouse Police Never
Sleeps" is reminiscent of
"Hunting Girl"from "Woods."
