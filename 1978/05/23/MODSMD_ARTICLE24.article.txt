Presbyterians say 'no' to gays
San Diego— United Presbyterian Church dele
gates voted overwhelmingly yesterday not to sanc
tion the ordination of acknowledged, practicing
homosexuals. They went on to consider ordina
tion for homosexuals who remain celibate or who
try to become heterosexual.
It was the first full-fledged confrontation of the
issue by the governing body of a major Christian
denomination.
In a show of hands, after a debate at the church's
190 th general assembly, only about 50 of the 650
voting delegates supported the ordination of ac
tive homosexuals.
Before the vote, Sandra Brawders, a candidate
for the ministry, avowed her homosexuality to the
assembly and declared: "We can discover and find
ways to share the delicate and lovely rainbow of
acceptance under which Cod offers to meet us
all."
About 2000 observers packed the hall. Televi
sion cameras recorded the deliberations. Pickets
on both sides of the issue paraded outside.
Delegates recessed for dinner after the vote and
were to act afterward on a committee's recom
mendation that the church sanction ordination of
homosexuals who attempt to espouse heterosex
uality or who remain celibate.
Sadat's foes lose political rights
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat, trying to
silence a "campaign of doubt" about his leader
ship, won almost unanimous popular backing in a
referendum to bar his opponents of the left and
right from politics, the government announced
yesterday.
The Interior Ministry said the tough measures
proposed by Sadat were approved by 98.29 per
cent of the voters in the Sunday balloting. It said
9,202,553 voted in favor and 159,578 people voted
"no," and the turnout was 85.4 per cent.
Cairo newspapers reported, meanwhile, that
eight leftists were arrested in the Nile Delta pro
vince of Gharbeya on Sunday for distributing
pamphlets urging a negative vote and "inciting
voters against the regime."
The leftist party, the National Progressive Un
ion, said one of its members in the Egyptian parli
ament, Abul Ezz el Hariri, also was arrested Sun
day, his second arrest since leading a demonstra
tion last week that authorities denounced as "en
dangering social peace."
The left and right had opposed the referendum
as a "repression of political liberalism" fostered by
Sadat in 1976 when he legalized opposition groups
for the first time in two decades of one-party rule.
Belgian troops leave Kolwezi
Kolwezi, Zaire — Belgian paratroopers who
helped evacuate nearly 2500 white foreigners pul
led out of this battle-ravaged African city yester
day. French legionnaires patrolled the dusty

streets strewn with corpses bloating in the sun.
The French and Belgians made separate air
borne assaults into Kolwezi Friday and Saturday,
ending a week-long orgy of killing, rape and pil
lage by rebel invaders.
Some 1200 Belgian soldiers boarded C-130
transport planes and were flown to a military base
at Kamina, 130 miles north of this copper-mining
center.
In Brussels, Belgian Premier LeoTindemans said
one battalion would stay at Kamina "to guarantee
the safety" of Belgians remaining in Zaire's south
eastern Shaba Province. Several thousand Euro
peans are still in mineral-rich Shaba, with many
living in Likasi and Lubumbashi, east and south
east of Kolweiz.
200 killed in Kolwezi siege
Brussels, Belgium — Rebel tribesmen
slaughtered as many as 200 persons in a "hunt for
the white man" during the weeklong Kolwezi
siege, survivors said on arriving here yesterday.
Some said Zairean government troops took advan
tage of the chaos in the southern Zaire city and
joined in the looting.
Airplanes carrying refugees from the Central Af
rican war landed in Brussels, Rome, Lisbon and
Paris. All 2500 surviving Europeans and Americans
trapped during the fighting were reported
evacuated from Kolwezi, and most had reached
Europe.
"One thing is certain: no white will return to
Kolwezi without a permanent European military
force there," said one arrival in Brussels, a Fren
chman who identified himself only as Boni.
About Boo French Foreign Legionnaires, partofa
French-Belgian force that drove the rebels from
Kolwezi over the weekend, were still there yester
day, searching for rebel holdouts. Belgium an
nounced that a Belgian paratroop battalion would
remain at an air base at Kamina, 130 miles north of
Kolwezi.
Violence mars Peruvian strike
Lima, Peru — Police fired warning volleys and
tear gas to break up demonstrations that erupted
yesterday on the first day of a Communist-led gen
eral strike against government price hi kes for basic
foods, fuel and transportation.
The government imposed a midnight to 5 a.m.
curfew for Lima and the port city of Callos, de
clared the strike illegal and ordered workers to
return to their jobs today.
Witnesses said at least three persons died in
clashes between police and slum dwellers near a
key bridge linking this city of 4.5 million with its
suburban airport.
Government sources said two civilians were kil
led in the highland city of Huancavelica, 150 miles
east of Lima, when mobs clashed with police. The
sources said saboteurs with dynamite damaged
government offices, a railroad station and a power

station. The city of 265,000 was reported without
electricity yesterday afternoon.
With the airport virtually cut off, Peru's two na
tional airlines canceled most flights, leaving many
tourists stranded.
The military government of Gen. Francisco
Morales Bermudez is blaming leftist "professional
agitators" for sparking the wave of sabotage, arson
and looting that erupted nationwide following last
Monday's announcement of price hikes ranging
from 30 to 120 per cent.
Disarmament protesters jailed
Bangor, Wash. — Nearly 300 demonstrators were
arrested yesterday after they climbed over a
6-foot-tall barbed-wire fence into the Navy's Tri
dent nuclear submarine base to protest nuclear
weaponry.
Only four, all second offenders, were jailed, and
the others said they would be back today.
The demonstrators, holding a United Nations
flag and singing "We Shall Overcome" said they
were trying to draw attention to the U.N. General
Assembly special session on nuclear disarma
ment.
The four jailed at Tacoma City jail faced federal
trespassing charges after refusing a bail stipulation
that they would obey all federal laws pending
further court action.
Two were Canadians, and all were second of
fenders, having been involved last year in similar
protest actions at the base.
World leaders will be meeting at U.N. headquar
ters in New York City for the five-week session
starting today to discuss ways of trimming global
arms spending, now nearly $400 billion a year.
The United States and the Soviet Union, which
together account for more than half the annual
total spent on arms, are expected to take the brunt
of criticism leveled by Third World leaders, who
want a major portion of weapons expenditures
diverted to development.
Casino stocks boost Dow Jones
New York — Casino-gambling issues were the
star performers yesterday as the stock market re
bounded from its slump of late last week.
The trading pace was subdued, however. New
York Stock Exchange volume totaled 28.68 million
shares, coming in below 30 million for the first
time in more than five weeks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off
11.52 points last Thursday and Friday, recovered
8.57 to 855.42.
Gambling stocks attracted a continuing influx of
speculative money, with Resorts International
planning to open the first casino in Atlantic City,
N.J. late this week.
Today's Weather
Fair cool and breezy through tomorrow. Lows in
the mid 40s to low 50s. Highs in the 60s.
