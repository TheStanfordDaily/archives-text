# Medical experts debate future of health care
## 
### Andrea James 
"There is no individual in this
country who can't find health care
when he needs it."
Views ranging from this conserva
tive statement to "health care is in a
serious crisis" were expressed yes
terday afternoon in Fairchild Au
ditorium as four experts in public
health policy gave their opinions on
"Medical Policy at a Crossroads."
The public debate was sponsored
by the Stanford Medical Students As
sociation (SMSA) and the Medical
School's Department of Family,
Community and Preventive
Medicine.
The debate was a "kick-off" for a
series of speaker programs which the
two groups hope to sponsor next
year, according to Todd Kotler, a
student in family, community and
preventive medicine.
Count Gibson, professor of family,
community and preventive
medicine, served as moderator.
About 100 people attended the
debate which divided the health care
issue into categories of equity, qual
ity of care, organization of services
and financing mechanisms.
Dr. Frank Rogers, past president of
the American Association of Physi
cians and Surgeons and a professor
of surgery at Loma Linda, began the
debate with his conservative views.
Although he said equity in the dis
tribution of health care is not a prob
lem, he agreed the nation is in a state
of "bankruptcy."
Rogers advocated fewer mass gov
ernment services and more indi
vidual services.
"Each individual is separate and
distinct," he said, and therefore
must be treated as an individual.
Equity in health care is therefore

not a problem because it can't exist,
he said.
He added the government is trying
to force equality into the health care
system, "in the same way one can try
to drive a square peg into a round
hole."
But he said that equality in availa
ble health care opportunities is evi
dent in the United States.
"It's a fallacy to believe other
wise," he said. "The vast majority of
persons in the United States are
well-covered by some form of health
care insurance."
Dr. Robert Burnett, past president
of the Santa Clara Medical Society,
agreed that "access to care is not a
major problem.
"We have a system that seems to
satisfy the needs of most people," he
said after citing statistics from vari
ous health policy surveys.
But Burnett said he is concerned
whether health care is carried out ef
ficiently.
Although he said it is "better to
spend more (of the Gross National
Product) on medical care than on
building highways to nowhere," he
agreed the money in health care
could be spent more efficiently.
Dr. Alain Enthoven, Business
School professor and special consul
tant to Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare Secretary Joseph
Califano, stressed the need for com
petition in the health care system.
He described the current system as
"poorly designed" and suggested
converting to a market economy sys
tem in which consumers could make
their own choipes between a variety
of health care systems.
He said this market economy
would serve long-term advantages
while the current system deals only

with the short-term benefits "like
getting the politician into office after
the next election."
He said his plan would benefit
both doctors and consumers.
After questioning Burnett's statis
tics, Dr. Robert Alford, professor of
sociology at UC-Santa Cruz, said he
did not believe health care is being
distributed equally.
Alford also said there is no reason
why the doctor-patient relationship
must be harmed if the fee-for
medical-services tradition is drop
ped.

"We are heading toward a national
health care insurance and eventually
toward a national health care ser
vice," Alford added. "The fee-for
service method is clearly no longer
preferred."
For this reason and because he
said the fee-for-service method
forces patients to pay doctors more
than is really necessary, he advocates
alternative methods.
He added he felt the United States
can "do a much better job than Bri
tain" in developing national health
care services.
