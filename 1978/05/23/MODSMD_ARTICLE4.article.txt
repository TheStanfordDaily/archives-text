# Sentencing delayed
## Berkowitz disrupts court 
### 
New York (AP) — David Berkowitz,
the "Son of Sam" killer, was dragged
from a Brooklyn courtroom yester
day, kicking, biting and yelling as the
boyfriend of one of his victims
shouted obscenities at him. Mem
bers of the girl's family jumped to
their feet and cursed the confessed
murderer.

A judge postponed the sentencing
for six murders until june 12 and or
dered another psychiatric examina
tion for Berkowitz, 24.
After he was brought briefly into
the courtroom in handcuffs, Ber
kowitz began chanting, "Stacy was a
whore!" over and over again. Stacy
Moskowitz was the last of Berkowitz'

murder victims.
Berkowitz also shouted, "That's
right! That's right! I'd kill heragain."
As 10 guards wrestled the .44-
caliber killer from the court
chamber, Robert Violante, the Mos
kowitz girl's date who also was shot
by Berkowitz, stood up in the cour
troom and began shouting
obscenities at him. Members of the
Moskowitz family jumped to their
feet and screamed curses at the
pudgy former postal worker.
The girl's mother then broke down
crying, and Violante sobbed into his
hands.
The victim's father, Jerry Mos
kowitz, cried, "No Justice!" after Jus
tice Joseph Corso of Brooklyn an
nounced the sentencing delay.
Earlier, as guards tried to bring
Berkowitz into the courtroom the
first time about 10 a.m., he lunged
toward a window and had to be sub
dued. In the struggle, he bit and
kicked several of the guards and one
of them was taken to a hospital, ac
cording to a police source.
The extent of the guard's injuries
was not known.
Edward McCarthy, aide to Bronx
District Attorney Mario Merola, said
Berkowitz told court authorities he
did not want to be sentenced — "at
least not today."
Berkowitz faces prison terms total
ing up to 175 years.
Last year, Berkowitz offered to
plead guilty but only if he was al
lowed to warn the world of the
bloodthirsty demons that he said
made him kill. Since then, Berkowitz
says he has become a born-again
Christian.
