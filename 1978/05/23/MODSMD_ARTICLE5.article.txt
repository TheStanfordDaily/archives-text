# Blacks air grievances at community meeting
## 
### Ellie Lanza 
The University's staff grievance
policy, funds frozen for the Commit
tee on Black Performing Arts (BPA)
and a Food Research Institute (FRI)
recommendation that Asst. FRI Prof.
Tetteh Kofi not be granted tenure
were some of the topics discussed
last night at the Black Community
Meeting.
About 60 people attended the
meeting to talk about problems
faced by black students, faculty and
staff here.

"In order to survive in this country
we have to be a creative people,"
Asst. Psychology Prof. Irvin Brown
said. Brown, resident fellow of
Ujamaa, expressed his concern over
the "myth" that certain things are in
evitable.
"The problems that we have to re
ckon with in the future are not the
problems we have had to reckon
with in the past," he added.
Some of the issues discussed in
cluded the Food Research Institute
recommendation earlier this year
that Prof. Tetteh Kofi not be granted
tenure. Kofi was brought to Stanford
in 1970 amid demands by students
who wanted Third World economic
courses.
Another topic of discussion was
the staff grievance policy recently
adopted by the University. That pol
icy may have adverse effects on the
non-union staff of the University, ac
cording to one speaker.
