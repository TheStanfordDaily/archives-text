# Suit questions policy on staff grievances

### Gary Furlong 
A lawsuit was filed against the Uni
versity last week in Santa Clara
County Superior Court in an attempt
to settle a long-running dispute over
Stanford's grievance policy interpre
tation.
The suit was filed by Henry Organ,
an associate director of foundations
in the Office of Development.
The suit stems from a grievance
filed approximately a year ago by Or
gan, in which he contends that his
job responsibilities were removed
and given to another person. This
person, whom Organ declined to
identify, was then designated as his
superior.
The motive for this, according to
Organ, was to compensate the un
named individual for not receiving a
desired promotion. The net result
was an indirect demotion for him,
Organ said.
Organ then filed a written grie
vance last August, and an internal
hearing was held before Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center Director
Wolfgang Panofsky. The decision
went against Organ.
After that decision was handed
down, Organ applied for review by
an outside hearing officer to Director
of Personnel Robert Parker, who de
nied his request.
The current suit contends that
Parker and the University have misin
terpreted the grievance policy.
Organ contends he has the right to
an outside hearing officer. The Uni
versity contends he does not.
"I filed suit in superior court," said

Organ, "to request a court order that
the University carry out its own grie
vance policy. Under it I have a right
to an outside hearing officer.
"I didn't want to file suit," Organ
stated. "I first went to Bill Massy
(Vice-president of Business and Fi
nance) to see if the Director of Per
sonnel was following the grievance
procedure (correctly). Massy said he
was. I even appealed to President
Richard Lyman, who also concur
red." Organ said he disagreed that
the procedure was being followed
correctly, and decided to file suit.
The University has since changed
the grievance policy to explicitly rule
out access to an outside hearing of
ficer in cases such as Organ's. Only
in cases of firing or permanent layoff
will outside arbitration be allowed in
the future.
