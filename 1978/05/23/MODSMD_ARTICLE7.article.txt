# Speakers hit jailing of Sami Esmail

### Kevin Cox 
The imprisonment of Sami Esmail
in an Israeli jail is threatening the
constitutional and human rights of all
Americans, speakers at a White Plaza
rally said yesterday.
The rally was sponsored by the
Stanford Committee to Defend the
Human Rights of Sami Esmail. Esmail,
a Palestinian graduate student at
Michigan State, was arrested by Is
raeli authorities last December when
he went to the occupied West Bank
to visit his dying father.
About 100 people attended the
rally.
"Other governments arrest people
for breaking their laws in the United
States, even though no law in this
country has been broken," said Leah
O'Brien, a National Lawyers Guild
(NLC) spokeswoman. NLG is inves
tigating the Esmail case.
O'Brien said Esmail was arrested
by Israeli authorities because of
statements he made against the Is
raelis in the United States, even
though he was protected by the First
Amendment in making such state
ments here.
O'Brien also alleged that the U.S.
governmettt collaborated with the Is
raeli government in the apprehen
sion of Esmail and that the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) notified
Israeli authorities of Esmail's inten
tions to travel to Israel.
Dwight Simpson, chairman of the
San Francisco State University Com
miteee to Defend the Human Rights
of Sami Esmail, charged the Israeli
government with "extra-territorial
jurisdiction," alleging that Esmail
was arrested for his statements in the
United States.
"Sitting in the sun in Palo Alto, you
might think it is absurd, that it can't
happen. . . but that's precisely what
happened," Simpson said.
If a student in the United States is
associated with a known political
agitator from a country such as Chile,
that student could be arrested if he
ever visited that country, he said.
A "terrible gap" exists, said

Simpson. He alleged that the Israeli
government is denying Esmail's U.S.
constitutional rights as well as his
human rights.
He also asserted that a reason for
the imprisonment of Esmail is to "in
timidate the Palestinians studying in
America from expressing their views
about their people."
The Black Students Union (BSU)
also called for the support of all Third
World people for Esmail.
"Their struggle is our struggle . . .
their enemy is our enemy," said Clin
ton Killian, a BSU spokesman.
