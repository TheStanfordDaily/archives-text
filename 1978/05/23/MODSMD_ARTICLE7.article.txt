The imprisonment of Sami Esmail
in an Israeli jail is threatening the
constitutional and human rights of all
Americans, speakers at a White Plaza
rally said yesterday.
The rally was sponsored by the
Stanford Committee to Defend the
Human Rights of Sami Esmail. Esmail,
a Palestinian graduate student at
Michigan State, was arrested by Is
raeli authorities last December when
he went to the occupied West Bank
to visit his dying father.
About 100 people attended the
rally.
"Other governments arrest people
for breaking their laws in the United
States, even though no law in this
country has been broken," said Leah

O'Brien also alleged that the U.S.
