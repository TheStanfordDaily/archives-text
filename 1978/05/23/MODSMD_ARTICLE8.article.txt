# CIR actively supported
## Boycott expresses moral witness 
### 
Rev. Byron Bland

Jonathan Mill's remarks concerning the United Cam
pus Christian Ministry Board's endorsement of a boycott
of university fund-raising, provide an occasion to con
sider the theological' implications of Stanford's invest
ments in corporations doing business in South Africa.
I, as the ordained staff for UCCM, wish to express my
personal reasons for seeing the UCCM Board's en
dorsement as an act of Christian witness.
I doubt that anyone questions that substantial human
suffering and misery is occurring in South Africa. This
suffering and misery is the result of a sophisticated net
work of laws and institutional practices governing bi
level economies and dual societies in South Africa.
In March, the Board of Directors of UCCM and the
ad-hoc Committee on South Africa of the First Baptist
Church of Palo Alto, gave joint testimony at ihe CIR
public forum. They urged Stanford to divest itself of
corporations doing business in South Africa because
they believed that to maintain an intimate relationship
with apartheid was unconscionable.
Through this statement, they wished to express strong
moral concern, and it was in this vein that CIR received
and interpreted their presentation. The UCCM Board
supports the insightful and thoughtful analysis that CIR
presented to the Trustees of Stanford University.
It is impossible for me to look at the cross of Jesus
without seeing that same cross in the face of every suf
fering black South African. In their suffering, Cod is
suffering, just as God suffered when Jesus hung on the
cross in Jerusalem two thousand years ago.
Christians believe that God's love broke into the
world to love our dying and suffering Lord. They con
clude that in response, they are to love and care for each
other as God had loved and cared for them.
Response of love
I see our response today to be the love and care we
express towards our South African brothers and sisters
who also suffer powerlessly and silently. The founding
of the Church was on the primacy of that same love for
human living, both within general human affairs and in
personal life.
I cannot pass off my concern for the welfare of black
South Africans as a consideration secondary to corpo
rate board-room ethics or the day-to-day workings of the
university. Jesus' weeping, pointing to the massive suf
fering in South Africa, stands foremost in my conscience
and prayers.
God's concern for justice transcends normal human
activity. Jesus disrupts "business as usual" to hold up to
us the powerless and oppressed, the suffering and the
hungry that otherwise might pass us by unnoticed Jesus
even says that in as much as we give of water to those in
need, we give that drink to Jesus himself.
The trustees charged the Commission on Investment
Responsibility to analyze the effect of corporate pre
sence in South Africa and the make recommendations
on investment responsibility. CIR, who could hardly be
called irrational or radical, or accused of pushing and

ideology or point of view, made an objective study, and
recommended, 8-4, a general policy of withdrawal.
Commanding allegiance to |esus
To my knowledge, all specific recommendations for
withdrawal received a larger, if not unanimous favorable
vote. The trustees have charged a commission for study
and analysis. They cannot silently disregard the Com
mission's findings which seem objectionable or chal
lenging. This is where I find the witness of our Lord Jesus
commanding my allegiance.
I should say that I do not wish the demise of the Senior
Pledge Program nor the subversion of the education of
future Stanford students. I wish both success after Stan
ford acts more responsibly toward the suffering of Black
South Africans.
Nor do I wish to punish the university of future stu
dents, but only to communicate as strongly as possible
our concern. President Lyman has reminded us that
Stanford is not government by democratic processes.
Boycott expresses moral witness
Economic boycott is the most immediate and direct
way I know to express moral witness. If the boycott has
negative repercussions, we accept that responsibility
humbly, and prayer for these effects to be minimal.
The history, theology, and witness of the Black
Church in the I%o's leads us today to understand our
situation with deep spiritual insight. Black Church lead
ers theologically witnessed to the church at large by
non-violently confronting the racist practices, laws and
institutions that degraded their humanity and destroyed
their lives.
That they saw clearly the connection between their
faith and their actions, is a message of ministry and
leadership to the Church today.
In response to the crisis we face, the Rev. Andrew
Young, a United Church of Christ minister and the Un
ited States Ambassador to the United Nations, has re
commended the Civil Rights Movement of the I%o's to
South Africa as a model for the black South Africa strug
gle. I believe we must consider his counsel seriously
here in the United States.
During World War 11, the Theological Declaration of
Barmen of the Confessing Church of Nazi Germany chal
lenged the complacency of Christians in the face of the
suffering and slaughter that was around them. This con
fession motivated the brave witness of a few Christian
clergy who suffered with the Jews and homosexuals in
the Nazi concentration camps.
Countless other historical examples can be evoked to
clearly ground the UCCM Board's actions within the
bounds of the church and Christian activity.
I would urge all Stanford students and alumni to
boycott Stanford fundraising as a way to express moral
concern. In all religions, there exists the strength and
commitment to express concern in the face of moral
crisis. I urge all religious groups as well as Christians to
examine their traditions in order to find that strength
and commitment.
