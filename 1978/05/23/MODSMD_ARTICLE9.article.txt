# Letters: divestment and Tresidder

Refusal to burn-out
A few days ago I was angry enough
at my fellow Synergites to call them
nasty names in a nasty note. It was
pointed out to me, then, that my
anger only further alienates people
from arriving at a constructive solu
tion to simple problem.
The problem surrounding South
Africa is not so simple, and dealing
with the trustees has been frustrating
and confusing for everyone in
volved. However, I believe SCRIP is
finding, too, that our anger will not
help us help the community to un
derstand what apartheid is all about
and why we are fighting it.
We need the support of the com
munity; and students should know
about situations like these, while
they are preparing to "run the na
tion" in future years.
I spoke at a rally one night about
black women in South Africa. They
work in white homes, giving tender
ness and care to white children.
Their own children are forced to live
with relatives or stangers in squalid
black ghettos. Tvro out of four chil
dren die before age five, starving.
Meanwhile women's husbands or
lovers are segragated miles away,
slaving in the mines for rich people's
gold and diamonds.
We are fighting to free these
people, though sometimes I think
my friends forget this, too. Our
anger overwhelms us — anger that
people should die under the white

male racist regime, anger that Stan
ford students have better things to
do than show support for this
movement, or learn about it.
And my anger digs deeper in me,
every day. I spent the evening of
Mother's Day trying to convince my
mother that life is worth living after
all, trying to tell this woman how to
reconstruct her whole self-image
after the devastation of a twenty-year
marriage.
I get angry that society so distorts
our self-images, especially of women
who grow up seeing themselves in
relation to man: Eve of his ribs, wife
in his name, body for his hands.
We who ask for women's libera
tion, for South African liberation,
liberation for gays and minorities,
are simply indignant that people
must suffer while others are so com
fortably educated, preparing to live
comfortable lives.
You might ask, Why don't you
drop out? Some of us have. But then
who would put their educations
careers and reputations on the line to
shake up the rest of us, and say,
"Look, there is a bigger world out
there, and we're all part of it."
We don't have to look to South
Africa to see suffering. It happens in
East Palo Alto, children dying of mal
nutrition. Sexism and racism go on
all the time at Stanford.
We're not going to change it until
we all recognize that our care is im
portant, that our support changes

minds and lives.
We have more constructive things
to do than fend off attacks, though
positive criticism is always welcome.
A little humanity, patience and self
initiative go a long way in any strug
gle.

Tresidder cafeteria abominable
Yes, I'm sick and tired of the endless
talk about divestment, a policy
whose benefit to the South Africans
cannot even be established with any
confidence. I want to suggest an
issue of more immediate concern to
students, and one where the Daily
has a greater chance of making its
influence felt.
Why doesn't the Daily investigate
the reasons for the woeful lack of a
restaurant or cafeteria on campus
which is worthy of the name? I'm not
talking about the Faculty Club, which
isn't open to students but about the
Tresidder cafeteria and coffee
house.
The Tresidder cafeteria is abomin
able. One isn't even safe buying
something as simple as a hot dog. I
tried it recently, and the bun
wouldn't even go around the wiener
(no, the wiener wasn't outsized). I
had thought to order a chili-dog, but
on seeing some fossilized remnants
of what might once have been chili, I
quickly abandoned the idea.
If located off-campus, this
cafeteria would most assuredly never
see a repeat customer. The prices are
not in any sense low, and certainly
aren't geared to the student budget
— $1.30 for a chili-dog!! Once I or
dered breakfast at Tresidder — for
the last time. *
In fairness, one can get good pas
tries at Marcel's and at the Coffee
House, and the latter has OK
sandwiches and good coffee. But not
at budget prices.
But decent hot meals are unavaila
ble to students on campus, except
perhaps to those who live in dorms
or living groups. Why? There must be
many like myself, who live off
campus but would appreciate the
convenience of a decent hot meal on
campus, on occasion.

Covert stupidity
I wish to make a few comments on
Doug Bandow's article in the May 19,
Daily. If this article is a typical exam
ple for the mentality of students who
oppose corporate withdrawal from
South Africa, we seem to be dealing
with either latent racism or covert

stupidity.
Bandow states, "In South Africa,
most of the companies appear to op
erate at the national standard and do
not engage in any other clearly in
jurious activities."
I respectively advise Mr. Bandow
that "the national standard" lets the
South African police arrest blacks at
any time without cause or warning;
"the national standard" forces 70 per
cent of the population to live in
primitiveconditions on 20 per cent of
the land; "the national standard" al
lows one out of every two black
babies to die before they reach the
age of five.
Corporations that operate at the
national standard can only serve to
uphold that standard, and if we, as
American investors, support those
corporations with our capital, we are
suffering not from a lack of interest,
but from a lack of intelligence.

Support telegram
The following telegram was re
ceived by the ASSU Council of Presi
dents and the Catalyst Project on
South Africa on May 10. It was sent by
Leslie Harriman, the chairperson of
the United Nations Special Commit
tee Against Apartheid:
"On behalf of United Nations Spe
cial Committee Against Apartheid I
commend you for your campaign for
divestment from corporations in
volved in South Africa, and inform
you of followingaStatement adopted
by Special Committee today.
"The Special Committee Against
Apartheid expresses its great satis
faction at the campaigns by students
in universities and colleges in the Un
ited States of America and other
countries for divestment of invest
ments by the institutions in corpora
tions and banks involved in South
Africa.
"It declares that these campaigns
are in full harmony with the resolu
tions of the United Nations and de
serve the widest support. The Special
Committee undertakes to maintain
close cooperation with the student
campaign for the total isolation of the
apartheid regime and for maximum
support to the oppressed people of
South Africa and their national liber
ation movement.
"I wish you success."
