# Scholars' obligation only to understand
##

I would like to express my
wholehearted approval of the stand
taken by Harris, Eberts and Fetter
(Daily, May 12) in their letters con
cerning the disruptive and, as Eberts
so accurately deems them, "hypoc
ritical" policies of SCRIP. I believe
that I speak for the majority of stu
dents when I say that it is surely not
our place as members of the
academic community to participate
in any form of expressed opposition
to any given political, social, or moral
issue if such an issue demands that
we venture out of the sacred and
strictly-defined boundaries of cogni
tion and argumentation.
Granted, Fetter is speaking for us
all when she claims (barely able to
suppress her overhwelmingly in
tense humanitarianism) that she
cannot imagine how "any member of
the Stanford community does not
feel anguish over the . . . fate of the
black people in South Africa."
But like her I nevertheless main
tain that our "anguish" and concern
do not justify our overstepping the
tacit rules of propriety and confor
mity by engagement in protests, sit
ins or rallies which may disrupt the
inviolable life of scholarship and in
tellectualizing which this university
propagates in its elitist isolation.
All considered, what do the masses
of penurious, dehumanized, and
tyrannized third world nations have
to do with us? Why should we ea
gerly embrace the very same bonds
that chain the South Africans to a life
of harsh and bitter physical realities

when the moral duty of the modern
scholar lies neither in condemning
orapproving, merelyin recognizing?
Our priorities are such that it is not
only reasonable but also desirable
that our concern for racism and vir
tual slavery doeÂ« not interfere with
our disdain for active pursuit of its
eradication, particularly at the cost of
upsetting the administration and in
conveniencing our fellow students.
Such practices might be misinter
preted by others as a token of emo
tional affliction, a symptom that a
germ of global responsibility had
penetrated the sterility of the Stan
ford environment, a symbol that we
care about the horrendous affrontarv
to human dignity called "apartheid"
when, in fact, as Harris implies, we
are obligated always to understand
and believe, never to feel and act.
Surely, the members of SCRIP and
their supporters are just the mis
placed heirs of the movements of
emotional dissention which promp
ted the Vietnam War protests at Stan
ford a decade ago. Let history pass its
proverbial sentence on the corpora
tions that support the nefarious
South African regime and those who
actively oppose it, just as it has pas
sed sentence on those who partici
pated in the Vietnam War and those
who protested it, while the rest of us
escape history's judgment in the safe
and static confines of our books and
beliefs.
