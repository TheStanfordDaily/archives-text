# Police raid closes down gay publication
##

Bloomington Gay Rights Coalition, Bloomington, Ind.

On December 30,1977, one of the
most highly regarded gay/feminist
publications in the world was raided
and effectively closed down by the
police. The Body Politic, which is run
by a collective of gay feminist
socialists in Toronto, was the target
of a sudden police raid.
Several collective members were
arrested and charged with "the use
of the mails for.. .transmitting any
thing that is obscene, indecent, im

moral or scurrilous." Although any
reasonable person would know that
it would only be necessary for the
police to seize one copy of the issue
in question, the police carted away
12 crates of the Body Politic's posses
sions, including the complete sub
scription list, manuscripts, corres
pondence, and in general all the
papers it takes to run a magazine.
Also seized were the papers and all
the books printed and offered for

sale by the Pink Triangle Press, which
publishes books of gay interests.
Body Politic and Pink Triangle Press
are effectively crippled . . .
... we would like to point out a
simple moral lesson from this event.
In the last few years, more and more
feminist and lesbian groups in the
U.S. and Canada have been involved
with censorship and anti
pornography campaigns. In most
cases, this has centered on opposi
tion to pornographic materials that
glorify violence against women, such
as the movie "Snuff."
What many of these women fail to
realize is that their support of cen
sorship only lends fuel to the
enemies of feminism and gayness.
Even the stupidest of prosecutors,
police, or anti-porn campaigners
realizes that serious gay and feminist
publications and books pose a much
greater threat to their traditional
view of society and family than does
the hardest of hard-core porn.
An issue of Body Politic or a publi
cation from a feminist press such as
Diana press will spread more new
ideas, influence more people, cause
more action for gay liberation and
feminism than any number of show
ings of the movie "Snuff" will inspire
violence. For this reason, the target
of nominal anti-pornography cam
paigns is bound to be political writ
ings that support sexual freedom.
Such was the case in Toronto.
We are sure there is as much "por
nography" in Toronto as any other
city, yet the police used the anti
obscenity laws to close down a polit
ical magazine whose appeal to pru
rient interest would be hard to find,
unless somebody out there is getting
off on scholarly book rev ; ews or
news reports of police raids on gay
bars, the usual content of Body Poli
tic.
The specific article for which Body
Politic was cited was an interview
with three men who have been sexu
ally involved with boys. The tone and
intent of the article was clearly stated
to be an unbiased inquiry into the
nature of people involved in this type
of sexual activity.
The purpose was clearly to educate
readers. The Body Politic is a self
examining publication that has been
so free of sexism or erotica that it can
publish an article on that subject
without sensationalism. The police

were able to home in on that article at
a timewhen "child pornography" isa
topic of great interest and crusades,
and useitasanexcuseforcensorship
of everything Body Politic stands for.
A search through recent feminist,
lesbian, and gay publications will
show many examples of com
munities where feminists and les
bians have activiely participated in
censorship campaigns, particularly
in regard to the movie "Snuff."
. . . Our crusading enemies, the
Anita Bryants and her nasty follow
ers, make no distinction between
pornographic and feminist or gay
liberation publications.
They know which of these are
greater threats to their ideas of how
humans should behave sexually.
They will gleefully censor everything
they can get their hands on. The only
thing that stops them are other citi
zens who fight to defend the rights of
freedom of press and free speech.
Yet, what are some of the lesbian and
feminist groups, such as the one in
Rochester, doing?
They are aligning themselves with
the book-burners, under the mista
ken impression that only the types of
pornography the feminists object to
will be censored. Once allowed and
supported, there is NO end to cen
sorship. Who will appoint the cen
sors, and who will judge what is cen
sorable?
Does anyone think that the mayor
of Rochester will appoint a censor
ship committee consisting of les
bians? Perhaps when the gay and
feminist publications are all closed
down, will that same group of
women go around sticking little
pieces of paper on the locked doors
of the gay and lesbian publication's
offices that say, "This Offends Wo
men?"
The movie "Snuff" is undoubtedly
objectionable, a lot of books and
movies are objectionable, but cen
sorship — the end to a free press and
freedom of speech — is the most
obscene, most violent against wo
men, children and men, most objec
tionable of all pornography. We ap
peal to the people in the U.S.,
Canada, and the world to cease all
participation in any kind of censor
ship campaign. You are cutting our
throats.

most highly regarded gay/feminist
publications in the world was raided
and effectively closed down by the
police. The Body Politic, which is run
by a collective of gay feminist
socialists in Toronto, was the target
of a sudden police raid.
Several collective members were
arrested and charged with "the use
of the mails for.. .transmitting any
thing that is obscene, indecent, im

moral or scurrilous." Although any
reasonable person would know that
it would only be necessary for the
police to seize one copy of the issue
in question, the police carted away
12 crates of the Body Politic's posses
sions, including the complete sub
scription list, manuscripts, corres
pondence, and in general all the
papers it takes to run a magazine.
Also seized were the papers and all
the books printed and offered for

sale by the Pink Triangle Press, which
publishes books of gay interests.
Body Politic and Pink Triangle Press
are effectively crippled . . .
... we would like to point out a
simple moral lesson from this event.
In the last few years, more and more
feminist and lesbian groups in the
U.S. and Canada have been involved
with censorship and anti
pornography campaigns. In most
cases, this has centered on opposi
tion to pornographic materials that
glorify violence against women, such
as the movie "Snuff."
What many of these women fail to
realize is that their support of cen
sorship only lends fuel to the
enemies of feminism and gayness.
Even the stupidest of prosecutors,
police, or anti-porn campaigners
realizes that serious gay and feminist
publications and books pose a much
greater threat to their traditional
view of society and family than does
the hardest of hard-core porn.
An issue of Body Politic or a publi
cation from a feminist press such as
Diana press will spread more new
ideas, influence more people, cause
more action for gay liberation and
feminism than any number of show
ings of the movie "Snuff" will inspire
violence. For this reason, the target
of nominal anti-pornography cam
paigns is bound to be political writ
ings that support sexual freedom.
Such was the case in Toronto.
We are sure there is as much "por
nography" in Toronto as any other
city, yet the police used the anti
obscenity laws to close down a polit
ical magazine whose appeal to pru
rient interest would be hard to find,
unless somebody out there is getting
off on scholarly book rev ; ews or
news reports of police raids on gay
bars, the usual content of Body Poli
tic.
The specific article for which Body
Politic was cited was an interview
with three men who have been sexu
ally involved with boys. The tone and
intent of the article was clearly stated
to be an unbiased inquiry into the
nature of people involved in this type
of sexual activity.
The purpose was clearly to educate
readers. The Body Politic is a self
examining publication that has been
so free of sexism or erotica that it can
publish an article on that subject
without sensationalism. The police

were able to home in on that article at
a timewhen "child pornography" isa
topic of great interest and crusades,
and useitasanexcuseforcensorship
of everything Body Politic stands for.
A search through recent feminist,
lesbian, and gay publications will
show many examples of com
munities where feminists and les
bians have activiely participated in
censorship campaigns, particularly
in regard to the movie "Snuff."
. . . Our crusading enemies, the
Anita Bryants and her nasty follow
ers, make no distinction between
pornographic and feminist or gay
liberation publications.
They know which of these are
greater threats to their ideas of how
humans should behave sexually.
They will gleefully censor everything
they can get their hands on. The only
thing that stops them are other citi
zens who fight to defend the rights of
freedom of press and free speech.
Yet, what are some of the lesbian and
feminist groups, such as the one in
Rochester, doing?
They are aligning themselves with
the book-burners, under the mista
ken impression that only the types of
pornography the feminists object to
will be censored. Once allowed and
supported, there is NO end to cen
sorship. Who will appoint the cen
sors, and who will judge what is cen
sorable?
Does anyone think that the mayor
of Rochester will appoint a censor
ship committee consisting of les
bians? Perhaps when the gay and
feminist publications are all closed
down, will that same group of
women go around sticking little
pieces of paper on the locked doors
of the gay and lesbian publication's
offices that say, "This Offends Wo
men?"
The movie "Snuff" is undoubtedly
objectionable, a lot of books and
movies are objectionable, but cen
sorship — the end to a free press and
freedom of speech — is the most
obscene, most violent against wo
men, children and men, most objec
tionable of all pornography. We ap
peal to the people in the U.S.,
Canada, and the world to cease all
participation in any kind of censor
ship campaign. You are cutting our
throats.
