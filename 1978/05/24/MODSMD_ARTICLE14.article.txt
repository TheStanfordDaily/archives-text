# Fundraising, media spark Maddy

### 
Fresno (AP) — Ken Maddy
was just one of 120 state legis
lators a year ago, unknown to
most voters outside the sprawl
ing San Joaquin Valley farm dis
trict he represents in the state
Assembly.
But today Maddy is a major
contender for the Republican
nomination for governor,
close behind Attorney General
Evelle Younger and former Los
Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis.
The main factors in the
phenomenal rise in the 43-
year-old Fresno attorney's
political fortunes are a massive
fundraising drive among
California farmers and the slick
television commercials which
that money bought.
Hollywood looks
Maddy is a thoughtful, ar
ticulate former college football
player with the good looks of a
Hollywood star. He has charm
and charisma. He is a confi

dent, relaxed campaigner. He
projects well on television.
But there are also serious
clouds on Maddy's political
horizon.
— There are the charges that
he is nothing more than a
"media candidate," a man
without substance who has
been packaged like a box of
soap and sold to voters with
television commercials.
— There are glaring con
tradictions in his voting record.
For six years, Maddy compiled
one of the highest scores
among California Republicans
on the voting report cards of
the American Civil Liberties
Union and the AFL-CIO, and
one of the worst records on the
scales of conservative groups.
He supported public bar
gaining for public employees,
loosening of penalties for
marijuana and legalization of

all private sexual acts between
consenting adults.
But beginning in 1976, when
Maddy endorsed former Gov.
Ronald Reagan for president,
he took a sudden turn to the
right on votes in the Assembly,
and now stands squarely in the
middle of the Republican
mainstream. Maddy says that's
the result of changing times,
not political expediency.
— And recently, Maddy took
a stand against Proposition 13,
the Jarvis property tax cut in
itiative which a majority of his
farm supporters are advocat
ing.
In some circles, Maddy's
stand against Proposition 13 is
viewed as an act of political
courage. But it has put him on
the defensive for the first time.
It has probably slowed the
momentum of his campaign,
and reminded doubting con
servatives of his earlier liberal
voting record.
The flap caused by Maddy's
opposition to 13 — a $7 billion
property tax cut plan which
three of his four COP foes have
endorsed — is probably Mad
dy's most serious problem as
he has climbed in some polls to
within 5 percentage points of
the leaders of the Republican
primary.
Not hurt by 13
Maddy says he hasn't lost
any significant part of his farm
support because of the stand
against 13, which he says will
only cause a tax shift instead of
a tax reduction. But it has
forced him to spend time de
fending his position to his own
supporters.
He described his problem
with the Jarvis initiative en
route to a dinner at the farming
community of Greenfield,
where 450 persons would each
contribute $5 or more, and
many would complain about
his stand on 13.
"Tonight will be another
classic," Maddy predicted. "I
will spend my time — the
whole night — a drink in my
hand, never being able to take
a swallow.
"One after another. Just
wham, wham, wham! 'I want to
talk to you about Jarvis.' I get
away from one crowd after
doing my thing and go to the
next one. Jarvis. Next one: Jar
vis," Maddy said.
"I do my best. I feel I under
stand their problems, and I try
to convey that. I tell them
there's a down side to Jarvis,

too. I tell them that I don't
think it's good government,
that it's appealing, but it's not a
solution."
Top fundraiser
The comments were typical
of Maddy, who is the top fun
draiser in the COP this year
with $1.1 million. He calls him
self "moderate in every way."
He avoids extreme positions
and extreme rhetoric.
He criticizes Democratic
Gov. Jerry Brown. But he says
he agrees with many of
Brown's goals, if not in the way
Brown has tried to accomplish
them.
Such moderation usually
doesn't excite political crowds.
But more often than not it
works for Maddy.
Maddy's emphasis on the
campaign trail is noton specific
issues, but on his claim that he
has the best chance of defeat
ing Brown.
He praises Brown for trying
to limit state spending. But he
attacks Brown on nuclear
power, which Maddy supports
and Brown does not, and on
state land use controls, which
he says Brown would impose at
the expense of local govern
ment control.
Brown 'extreme'
"Brown does things in an ex
treme way," Maddy says."He
may take a good idea like put
ting more blacks, browns and
women on the bench, and he
does it almost at the expense of
reasonableness. You often
can't argue with what he's try
ing to do. But we argue with
the way he does it.
"We went wild in this state in
the expansion of the early six
ties. But Brown's gone over
board the other way. With his
'small is beautiful' ideas, he's
looking at the world through
the wrong end of the tele
scope," Maddy says.
Maddy has had mixed suc
cess courting the conservatives
who have dominated the
California Republican Party for
the past dozen years.
"I have not been viewed as
one who is a purist. But for Re
publicans, the major issue is to
defeat )erry Brown, and I rep
resent the best cnance of doing
that," Maddy says.
"I think they (conservatives)
in this campaign come down to
a point where they say, 'We
love Ed Davis, but he can't win.
We don't love Ken Maddy as
much, but he's acceptable to
us.' "

phenomenal rise in the 43-
year-old Fresno attorney's
political fortunes are a massive
fundraising drive among
California farmers and the slick
television commercials which
that money bought.
Hollywood looks
Maddy is a thoughtful, ar
ticulate former college football
player with the good looks of a
Hollywood star. He has charm
and charisma. He is a confi

dent, relaxed campaigner. He
projects well on television.
But there are also serious
clouds on Maddy's political
horizon.
— There are the charges that
he is nothing more than a
"media candidate," a man
without substance who has
been packaged like a box of
soap and sold to voters with
television commercials.
— There are glaring con
tradictions in his voting record.
For six years, Maddy compiled
one of the highest scores
among California Republicans
on the voting report cards of
the American Civil Liberties
Union and the AFL-CIO, and
one of the worst records on the
scales of conservative groups.
He supported public bar
gaining for public employees,
loosening of penalties for
marijuana and legalization of

all private sexual acts between
consenting adults.
But beginning in 1976, when
Maddy endorsed former Gov.
Ronald Reagan for president,
he took a sudden turn to the
right on votes in the Assembly,
and now stands squarely in the
middle of the Republican
mainstream. Maddy says that's
the result of changing times,
not political expediency.
— And recently, Maddy took
a stand against Proposition 13,
the Jarvis property tax cut in
itiative which a majority of his
farm supporters are advocat
ing.
In some circles, Maddy's
stand against Proposition 13 is
viewed as an act of political
courage. But it has put him on
the defensive for the first time.
It has probably slowed the
momentum of his campaign,
and reminded doubting con
servatives of his earlier liberal
voting record.
The flap caused by Maddy's
opposition to 13 — a $7 billion
property tax cut plan which
three of his four COP foes have
endorsed — is probably Mad
dy's most serious problem as
he has climbed in some polls to
within 5 percentage points of
the leaders of the Republican
primary.
Not hurt by 13
Maddy says he hasn't lost
any significant part of his farm
support because of the stand
against 13, which he says will
only cause a tax shift instead of
a tax reduction. But it has
forced him to spend time de
fending his position to his own
supporters.
He described his problem
with the Jarvis initiative en
route to a dinner at the farming
community of Greenfield,
where 450 persons would each
contribute $5 or more, and
many would complain about
his stand on 13.
"Tonight will be another
classic," Maddy predicted. "I
will spend my time — the
whole night — a drink in my
hand, never being able to take
a swallow.
"One after another. Just
wham, wham, wham! 'I want to
talk to you about Jarvis.' I get
away from one crowd after
doing my thing and go to the
next one. Jarvis. Next one: Jar
vis," Maddy said.
"I do my best. I feel I under
stand their problems, and I try
to convey that. I tell them
there's a down side to Jarvis,

too. I tell them that I don't
think it's good government,
that it's appealing, but it's not a
solution."
Top fundraiser
The comments were typical
of Maddy, who is the top fun
draiser in the COP this year
with $1.1 million. He calls him
self "moderate in every way."
He avoids extreme positions
and extreme rhetoric.
He criticizes Democratic
Gov. Jerry Brown. But he says
he agrees with many of
Brown's goals, if not in the way
Brown has tried to accomplish
them.
Such moderation usually
doesn't excite political crowds.
But more often than not it
works for Maddy.
Maddy's emphasis on the
campaign trail is noton specific
issues, but on his claim that he
has the best chance of defeat
ing Brown.
He praises Brown for trying
to limit state spending. But he
attacks Brown on nuclear
power, which Maddy supports
and Brown does not, and on
state land use controls, which
he says Brown would impose at
the expense of local govern
ment control.
Brown 'extreme'
"Brown does things in an ex
treme way," Maddy says."He
may take a good idea like put
ting more blacks, browns and
women on the bench, and he
does it almost at the expense of
reasonableness. You often
can't argue with what he's try
ing to do. But we argue with
the way he does it.
"We went wild in this state in
the expansion of the early six
ties. But Brown's gone over
board the other way. With his
'small is beautiful' ideas, he's
looking at the world through
the wrong end of the tele
scope," Maddy says.
Maddy has had mixed suc
cess courting the conservatives
who have dominated the
California Republican Party for
the past dozen years.
"I have not been viewed as
one who is a purist. But for Re
publicans, the major issue is to
defeat )erry Brown, and I rep
resent the best cnance of doing
that," Maddy says.
"I think they (conservatives)
in this campaign come down to
a point where they say, 'We
love Ed Davis, but he can't win.
We don't love Ken Maddy as
much, but he's acceptable to
us.' "
Fresno (AP) — Ken Maddy
was just one of 120 state legis
lators a year ago, unknown to
most voters outside the sprawl
ing San Joaquin Valley farm dis
trict he represents in the state
Assembly.
But today Maddy is a major
contender for the Republican
nomination for governor,
close behind Attorney General
Evelle Younger and former Los
Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis.
