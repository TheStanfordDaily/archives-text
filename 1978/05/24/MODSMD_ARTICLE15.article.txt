# Student grade altering hard to accomplish
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Students
often try to break into univer
sity computers as a sort of chal
lenge, officials say. But they
don't usually try to alter their
grades.
However, two University of
Southern California students,
apparently unhappy with their
grades and financial aid, tried
to tap into the university's
computer to brighten the situa
tion, a USC spokesman said
Monday.
But they failed to beat the
security system, Associate Di
rector of the USC News Bureau
Burt Wuttken said. He said the
18- and 20-year-old students,
who are still in school, were
later booked for investigation
in connection with the alleged
theft of computer equipment
last February. Their names
were not disclosed.
Nationwide problem
A USC computer science of
ficial said students across the
country often try to break into
university computers just to
see if they can get away with it.
"But it's not common for
them to try to do something
criminal once they've broken
in," said Professor Frederic
Carlson, director of the en
gineering computer lab at USC
and assistant dean of engineer
ing.
"Particularly for the very
bright students, it's a challenge
to see if they can pick the lock
and get in and out without
anyone finding them."
"You want your students to
learn about the system and
somewhere along the way it
may not be too clear that
they're straying over into an
area where criminal charges
may be filed," Carlson said.
"This is particularly true where
many university records are on
file within the computer."

Carlson said university com
puters generally have elabo
rate security systems to insure
"that you leave footprints
around," he said.
He said he did not know of
any incidents in which stu
dents had successfully tapped
into computers and altered
grades.
"The students did not
change the grades and did not
alter their financial aid re
cords," said Wuttken, adding
the university is investigating
those incidents and charges
may be filed.
"In order to get into various
parts of the computer, you
have to have certain
passwords," Wuttken said.
"Those passwords are pretty
tightly held."
UCLA incident
A UCLA spokesman said his
university also had an attemp
ted computer-tapping incident
around 1969.
"Three students attempted
to go into the computer and
alter their records, and it was
curious because two of the
three were clearly qualified for
graduate school without such
foolishness and they were de
tected and suspended, and
were later reinstated," said
UCLAspokesman Chan Harris.
