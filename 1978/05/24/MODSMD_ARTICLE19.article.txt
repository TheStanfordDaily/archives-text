# University officials investigate imitation diplomas

Robert Houghton's true
story had all the ingredients
for a second rate detective
novel — an anonymous note,
newspaper clippings, under
cover esionage, possibly
forged documents, and fi
nally, calling in the authorities
and proposing legislation to
ensure that such a thing could
never happen again.
The anonymous note? A
postcard with an ad taped to it
from the San Francisco
Chronicle for Diploma Service
Co. which read: "COLLEGE
DEGREES $10. Has your dip
loma been lost-damaged
stolen? Do you need another
copy for your den and second
office?"
The newspaper clippings?
Similar ads appearing in the
New York Times, the Los
Angeles Times, and the Palo
Alto Times between February
26 and April 25.
The espionage? Undertaken
by two classic amateur sleuths:
Associate Registrar Houghton
and a staff attorney for the Uni
versity — Cassius Kirk, Jr.
As Houghton explained, "It
seemed like we should follow
up on it (the post card with the
ad taped to it). I talked to Cas
sius Kirk and agreed to find out
the conditions for obtaining
such replacement diplomas.
"I made two telephone calls
to the company. In the first I
asked how to get a replace
ment diploma. The person I
spoke to replied that I only had
to send an affidavit of the loss,
but added that it didn't have to
be notarized. They knew right
away what the Stanford dip
loma looked like and they told
me it was $45 because it re
quired three-color printing
and hand lettering."
The second time Houghton
called the company, he talked
with someone Hse, "who was
just as aware of the Stanford
diploma."
Houghton asked what signa
tures would be used on the

diploma for a Master of Arts in
Economics for 1942 from Stan
ford. Houghton was told that
for 1942 they would "just have
to fill them (the signatures) in.
They would have to make it
look authentic — butthat since
it was a reproduction it would
not be forgery."
On March 2, Houghton
wrote to Diploma Service re
questing a diploma for an M.A.
in Economics from Stanford in
1942 to which he was not enti
tled. He paid with a money
order because his personal
checks have his address on
them, and he did not want the

company to treat his request
any differently because he was
from Stanford. Houghton had
the diploma sent to a relative's
address in Alameda.
Inquiries
Houghton also warned the
Information Section of the Re
gistrar's Office to answer any
inquiries about his educational
rccord "as you would any
other." He graduated from
Stanford with a B.A. in
Economics in 1941 and was not
registered at Stanford again
after that.
Three weeks later Houghton
received the diploma he had
requested. The Registrar's Of
fice reported that the Diploma
Service Co. had made no effort
to ascertain whether he had
earned the degree or not, said

Houghton.
The diploma "looked au
thentic" according to
Houghton, "but in writing out
1942, they spelled it 'fourty
two.' " Moreover, the fake ap
pears to be signed by President
Richard Lyman, who was not
president in 1942, and by Arjay
Miller, presently dean of the
Graduate School of Business,
who is listed as being from the
School of Economics.
The signature of the presi
dent of the Board of Trustees is
that of one "William S. Pod
ray," who may or may not exist,
but has never been president
of the Board.
Other Flaws
Thediploma had otherflaws,
but "it would take someone
familiar with Stanford's dip
loma to detect them," said
Houghton.
"We initially didn't like the
idea of anyone else reproduc
ing our diplomas, but getting
an unearned one this easily
showed that the company was
not being careful," stated
Houghton. "In any case, we
thought the reproduction of
Stanford diplomas should be
the privilege of the University.

Whether the documents
Diploma Service Co. provides
can be regarded as forged
documents or not is a ques
tionable point. Jay Kamlet, the
owner of the Marina del Rey
based corporation claims that
legally he is not required to
check a prospective cus
tomer's right to the diploma he
requests.
On the back of each re
placement diploma is the
statement: "This is a reproduc
tion from Diploma Service Co.,
Marina del Rey, Cal. No school
credit or degree status is
granted or implied."
Preliminary checking
Once Houghton received
the diploma, Kirk did some
preliminary checking into the
Business and Professional
Code, and the California Civil
Code, then contacted the San
Francisco attorney general in
charge of consumer fraud.
Eventually, the case was
turned over to Deputy Attor
ney General Karen Fried in Los
Angeles. She filed a consumer
fraud suit against Diploma Ser
vice Co., claiming that the
company causes prospective
employers to believe that the

persons holding the repro
duced diplomas have earned
them.
The suit, filed in Los Angeles
Superior Court, asks that the
company be enjoined from
providing the diplomas and be
required to pay $2500 for each
act of wi >ngdoing. The first
hearing will be held next Tues
day.
Kamlet estimates his com
pany prints about 30 diplomas
a week. But the suit would not
make him pay $2500 for each
one of these, but only for the
instances in which the state
could prove that Diploma Ser
vice had sold someone an un
earned diploma.
Never attended
In addition to Houghton,
four people associated with
the state investigation pur
chased six diplomas for de
grees from universities they
had never attended.

Kamlet claims prospective
customers must produce a
copy of a diploma or a college
transcript proving they have
earned a degree, or sign a
notarized statement. How
ever, none of these four were
asked for a transcript. One was
asked for a notarized state
ment after requesting a Stan
ford Law degree. When the
notarized statement was re
jected because of "vague
wording," the customer asked
for an M.A. from Stanford in
stead, which he was given.
Two other people signed
statements that they had
earned the diplomas they
wanted reproduced, but the
company did not ask that the
statements be notarized. The
fourth person received two
diplomas without having to
sign any statement.
Kamlet claims he can repro

duce diplomas from 200 col
leges across the United States.
He said Diploma Service has
just opened a New York office
as well.
According to Kirk, "Criminal
law is very technical — it is not
illegal to make photocopies
(Kamlet uses photographic re
productions of actual diplomas
to print the diplomas he sells),
but this company makes dip
lomas that look like originals."
Kirk described the Universi
ty's role in the case now as that
of "an interested party. These
things are not unusual; it's re
ally not just a Stanford matter,
it affects all universities."
However, California state at
torney general has stated that
he intends to sponsor a bill in
the California Legislature spec
ifically to forbid the operation
of activities such as Diploma
Service Co.
