# High Court requires use of search warrants by OSHA
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Supreme
Court told the federal government
yesterday it must stop making unan
nounced safety inspections of the
nation's workplaces unless first ob
taining search warrants.
Voting 5-3, the justices struck
down as unconstitutional a portion
of 1970 law passed by Congress to
provide government protection of
workers against on-the-job safety
hazards.

The law had authorized inspectors
from the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) to
make spot checks of some six million
industry and business locations
without proving to a judge or magis
trate that such a search was justified.
The Constitution's protection
against unreasonable searches "pro
tects commercial buildings as well as
private homes," Justice Byron White
wrote for the court.

"We are unconvinced that requir
ing warrants to inspect will impose
serious burdens on the inspection
system or the courts, will prevent in
spections necessary to enforce the
statute or will make them less effec
tive," White said.
Essentially, the justices' decision
places a buffer — the courts — bet
ween the OSHA, a division of the
Labor Department, and the busines
ses it inspects.
Now, if an OSHA inspector is de
nied access by a business owner, the
inspector must obtain a court
ordered search warrant before gain
ing access.
White's opinion acknowledged
that "the risk is that during the inter
val between the inspector's initial
request to search a plant and his pro
curing a warrant . . . violations . . .
could be corrected and thus escape
the inspector's notice."
The court's decision does not pre
clude OSHA inspectors from trying
to obtain a search warrant first —
without the business owner's know
ledge — to preserve the element of
surprise.
