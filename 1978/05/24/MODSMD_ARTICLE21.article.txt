# International theme house has co-op lifestyle
## Hammarskjold brings cultures together 
### Jiri Weiss 
Located on the outskirts of
the faculty ghetto, on Alvarado
Row, stands a white house
which bears vague re
semblance to its Washington
counterpart.
This is Stanford's interna
tional theme house, Ham
marskjold House. Twenty-six
foreign and American under
graduates and graduates live
here and another 20 or so,
mostly foreign students, are
house associates who rely on
the house for their social life.
Six years ago Cliff Clarke,
who was the Assistant Director
of Bechtel International Center
and is now finishing his Ph.D.
in education, was given two
weeks by the housing office to
come up with a written prop
osal, and the students to back
it, for an international resi
dence.
"I stood at the door of the
l-Center and offered lunch to
anyone that came," recalled
Clarke.
Hammarskjold was named
after the Secretary General of
the U.N., who according to
Clarke, "exemplified cultural
pluralism."
Co-operative
The house is a co-operative.
"The only kind of international
house that works" said Clarke,
who helped create a similar
house at Cornell University.
Every day around 4 p.m.
three house members or as
sociates can be seen, like the
three witches from Macbeth,
brewing the day's dinner.
The house is completely run
by those who live in it; they
even do the cleaning and pur
chasing of food.
"It's the co-op that makes
the house" said Sheila Lynch,
21, an international relations

major who is the house as
sociate (RA). Several other re
sidents agreed.
'Unique place'
"Hammarskjold is a unique
place" said Clarke. "There is
no other house like it.
Nowhere else do you get the
chance of living with people
from entirely different cul
tures.
"The first year was a struggle
for organization," recalled
Clarke, but morale was
boosted when the president of
the General Assembly of the
United Nations, Stanislav
Trepzynski spent several
nights at Hammarskjold with
his wife and bodyguard.
"He played the piano and
sang Christmas carols," said
Clarke.
However, living in an inter
national theme house also has
its problems. As one resident
explained, it's easy to feel left
out sitting at breakfast having
Chinese poetry discussed
around you — in Chinese.
Spices, food
At Hammarskjold House,
students also learn difficult to
pronounce names of spices
and eat food that they never
dreamed was edible.
"Your mouth sweats after a
hot curry; your palate is sen
sitized with sushi and sake,"
commented one resident.
But not all the food suits
everyone's tastes. Tripe
cooked in soysauce overnight
by an ambitious house
member several years ago
created such a stench that
many could not sleep, and
weak stomachs turned.
Other house activities in
clude trips to Yosemite and
study breaks. Also, the house
cooperates on a bi-weekly
"Cafe al Fresco" with Bechtel
International Center. Ham
marskjold also runs a guest
house used primarily by
foreign visitors to the Univer
sity.
But most activities tend to be
informal. "It's a great place to

argue," said Winnie Luk, 26, a
Ph.D. student from Hong Kong
who has been involved with
the house for four years.
Bill Stanley, a junior from
Texas, admitted he was initially
frightened by the idea of living
with foreigners, but joined the
house because "It was a chal
lenge to see if I could over
come being a redneck Texan."
Stanley said he thinks that he
has succeeded. "I have been
brought out a lot, to think and
express opinions," he said.
Armando Rodriguez, 26, a
masters candidate in computer

science from Mexico said he
moved in because, "It's two
blocks from LOTS," but
quickly added, "I feel diffe
rently about it now."
Rodriguez said he found out
that "I was not saving time but
wasting it chattering."
Willing to talk
"As a graduate student I have
little chance to meet people in
formally, here people are wil
ling to talk abou anything
under the sun," said Arvind
Khilnani, a Ph.D. candidate in
economic engineering from
Pakistan.
Khilnani said he met his wife

here. Theirweddingtook place
over spring break and the re
ception was a Hammarskjold
House production.
International weddings have
plagued the house ever since
its conception.
Like at least one other co-op,
Hammarskjold has been sub
jected to pressure from the
housing office to institute
more campus-directed prog
rams, according to Clarke.
"Perhaps there is not
enough support from the
housing office," said Clarke.
"What is needed is a strong RA
and faculty support."

come up with a written prop
osal, and the students to back
it, for an international resi
dence.
"I stood at the door of the
l-Center and offered lunch to
anyone that came," recalled
Clarke.
Hammarskjold was named
after the Secretary General of
the U.N., who according to
Clarke, "exemplified cultural
pluralism."
Co-operative
The house is a co-operative.
"The only kind of international
house that works" said Clarke,
who helped create a similar
house at Cornell University.
Every day around 4 p.m.
three house members or as
sociates can be seen, like the
three witches from Macbeth,
brewing the day's dinner.
The house is completely run
by those who live in it; they
even do the cleaning and pur
chasing of food.
"It's the co-op that makes
the house" said Sheila Lynch,
21, an international relations

major who is the house as
sociate (RA). Several other re
sidents agreed.
'Unique place'
"Hammarskjold is a unique
place" said Clarke. "There is
no other house like it.
Nowhere else do you get the
chance of living with people
from entirely different cul
tures.
"The first year was a struggle
for organization," recalled
Clarke, but morale was
boosted when the president of
the General Assembly of the
United Nations, Stanislav
Trepzynski spent several
nights at Hammarskjold with
his wife and bodyguard.
"He played the piano and
sang Christmas carols," said
Clarke.
However, living in an inter
national theme house also has
its problems. As one resident
explained, it's easy to feel left
out sitting at breakfast having
Chinese poetry discussed
around you — in Chinese.
Spices, food
At Hammarskjold House,
students also learn difficult to
pronounce names of spices
and eat food that they never
dreamed was edible.
"Your mouth sweats after a
hot curry; your palate is sen
sitized with sushi and sake,"
commented one resident.
But not all the food suits
everyone's tastes. Tripe
cooked in soysauce overnight
by an ambitious house
member several years ago
created such a stench that
many could not sleep, and
weak stomachs turned.
Other house activities in
clude trips to Yosemite and
study breaks. Also, the house
cooperates on a bi-weekly
"Cafe al Fresco" with Bechtel
International Center. Ham
marskjold also runs a guest
house used primarily by
foreign visitors to the Univer
sity.
But most activities tend to be
informal. "It's a great place to

argue," said Winnie Luk, 26, a
Ph.D. student from Hong Kong
who has been involved with
the house for four years.
Bill Stanley, a junior from
Texas, admitted he was initially
frightened by the idea of living
with foreigners, but joined the
house because "It was a chal
lenge to see if I could over
come being a redneck Texan."
Stanley said he thinks that he
has succeeded. "I have been
brought out a lot, to think and
express opinions," he said.
Armando Rodriguez, 26, a
masters candidate in computer

science from Mexico said he
moved in because, "It's two
blocks from LOTS," but
quickly added, "I feel diffe
rently about it now."
Rodriguez said he found out
that "I was not saving time but
wasting it chattering."
Willing to talk
"As a graduate student I have
little chance to meet people in
formally, here people are wil
ling to talk abou anything
under the sun," said Arvind
Khilnani, a Ph.D. candidate in
economic engineering from
Pakistan.
Khilnani said he met his wife

here. Theirweddingtook place
over spring break and the re
ception was a Hammarskjold
House production.
International weddings have
plagued the house ever since
its conception.
Like at least one other co-op,
Hammarskjold has been sub
jected to pressure from the
housing office to institute
more campus-directed prog
rams, according to Clarke.
"Perhaps there is not
enough support from the
housing office," said Clarke.
"What is needed is a strong RA
and faculty support."

Hammarskjold House on the row offers a unique opportunity to foreign and American students alike to
share their own culture with others, and to learn everything from tolerance to exotic cooking.
Located on the outskirts of
the faculty ghetto, on Alvarado
Row, stands a white house
which bears vague re
semblance to its Washington
counterpart.
This is Stanford's interna
tional theme house, Ham
marskjold House. Twenty-six
foreign and American under
graduates and graduates live
here and another 20 or so,
mostly foreign students, are
house associates who rely on
the house for their social life.
