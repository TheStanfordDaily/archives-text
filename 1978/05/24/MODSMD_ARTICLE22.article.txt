# Netters still undefeated
## Cards, SMU, USC, UCLA in semis 
### Jeff Brandon 
Undefeated and top
ranked nationally, Stan
ford's tennis team stormed
its way into the semifinals
crushing both South
Carolina (8-1) and Arizona
State (8-1) along the way.
The defending champs have
won 34 consecutive dual
matches and now face No. 4
ranked Southern Methodist
University in the semis.
SMU defeated North
Carolina State 8-1, and
those amazing Cal Bears 7-2
to gain a spot in the final
four.
The Cards, led by their
"3M" combination of John
McEnroe, Bill Maze and
Matt Mitchell, have yet to
face any real problems in
the tournament, despite the
loss of senior All-American
Perry Wright.
Wright played 4th singles
and 2nd doubles for the
Cards all year before damag
ing a cartilage in his right
knee in the next to last
match of the season. The in
jury sidelined Wright for the
team tournament although

he will attempt to play in the
individual doubles tourna
ment starting tomorrow.
In the opening matches
the Cards looked awesome
insingles capturingll ofthe
12 matches played. Stan
ford's top player, and prob
ably the top player in the na
tion, John McEnroe, has not
been extended in his first
two matches. McEnroe dis
posed of South Carolina's
All-American Chris Mayotte
6-4, 6-2, and Arizona State's
top player Eric Sherbeck 6-2,
6-1.
The lefthander from
Douglastown has an
nounced that ho is playing
in his final matches for the
Cards as he plans to play on
the pro circuit full time start
ing next month in the
Queens Club tournament in
England.
Two time All-American
Bill Maze and Stanford's No.
2 man, took three sets to
beat SC's Chuck Hodgin
yesterday, but settled down
today to whip Tonny Sie 6-3,
6-3.
Defending National Sing

les Champion Matt Mitchell
(11-1) says he doesn't mind
playing third singles behind
McEnroe and Maze. Playing
third, Mitchell is in a diffe
rent class than most of his
opponents and should have
no problem winning. This
was shown again as Mitchell
crushed Barry Gilbert 6-2,
6-0, and Alan Waldman 6-3,
7-6.
The Cards, now 22-0 on
the season, also received
help from the bottom half of
their line-up. John Rast and
Lloyd Bourne have been
perfect so far in the tourna
ment, while Peter Rennert
has split his two matches.
Rast knocked off Arthur
Anastopoulo and John
Hermanson by identical 6-1,
6-4 scores. Bourne (13-2)
also continued to play bril
liantly. The talented
sophomore from Pasadena
took Jeff Hull 6-4, 7-6, and in
a match of tiebreakers
slithered away from a 7-6,
7-6 victory over Mike Car
ruthers. Rennert (18-3)
downed Arthur McDonald
6-4, 7-5 yesterday, but

dropped his singles match
against ASU'sTim Anderson
6-4, 6-2.
Doubles has been a
strong point all year for the
Cardinals and despite the
loss of Wright, who is one of
the top doubles players in
the nation, the Cards' start
ing doubles teams have won
all five of the matches they
have played, dropping only
one set in the process. The
Cards are almost unbeata
ble at first doubles with the
team of McEnroe and
Mitchell, but they must
count on good perfor
mances by the sometimes
up, sometimes down team
of Maze and Rast, and the
third doubles team of Re
nnert and Bourne (8-0).
The Cards should have a
tough match but should ad
vance into the finals tomor
row against the winner of
the USC-UCLA match.
SMU, Stanford's semi-final
opponent and the No. 4
ranked team in the nation
swept the doubles against
Cal by winning 7-2. SMU
prevented an All-Pacific-8

semifinals by winning three
three-set matches against
the Bears.
UCLA is the favorite
against USC tomorrow, hav
ing beaten the Trojans twice
already in dual matches this
year. The Bruins had an easy
time with North Carolina
(7-2), and Pepperdine (6-3).
USC opened up with a win
over LSU, 6-3, and scored
the tournaments only up
set, stopping 3rd ranked
Trinity 5-4.

Undefeated and top
ranked nationally, Stan
ford's tennis team stormed
its way into the semifinals
crushing both South
Carolina (8-1) and Arizona
State (8-1) along the way.
The defending champs have
won 34 consecutive dual
matches and now face No. 4
ranked Southern Methodist
University in the semis.
SMU defeated North
Carolina State 8-1, and
those amazing Cal Bears 7-2
to gain a spot in the final
four.
The Cards, led by their
"3M" combination of John
McEnroe, Bill Maze and
Matt Mitchell, have yet to
face any real problems in
the tournament, despite the
loss of senior All-American
Perry Wright.
Wright played 4th singles
and 2nd doubles for the
Cards all year before damag
ing a cartilage in his right
knee in the next to last
match of the season. The in
jury sidelined Wright for the
team tournament although

he will attempt to play in the
individual doubles tourna
ment starting tomorrow.
In the opening matches
the Cards looked awesome
insingles capturingll ofthe
12 matches played. Stan
ford's top player, and prob
ably the top player in the na
tion, John McEnroe, has not
been extended in his first
two matches. McEnroe dis
posed of South Carolina's
All-American Chris Mayotte
6-4, 6-2, and Arizona State's
top player Eric Sherbeck 6-2,
6-1.
The lefthander from
Douglastown has an
nounced that ho is playing
in his final matches for the
Cards as he plans to play on
the pro circuit full time start
ing next month in the
Queens Club tournament in
England.
Two time All-American
Bill Maze and Stanford's No.
2 man, took three sets to
beat SC's Chuck Hodgin
yesterday, but settled down
today to whip Tonny Sie 6-3,
6-3.
Defending National Sing

les Champion Matt Mitchell
(11-1) says he doesn't mind
playing third singles behind
McEnroe and Maze. Playing
third, Mitchell is in a diffe
rent class than most of his
opponents and should have
no problem winning. This
was shown again as Mitchell
crushed Barry Gilbert 6-2,
6-0, and Alan Waldman 6-3,
7-6.
The Cards, now 22-0 on
the season, also received
help from the bottom half of
their line-up. John Rast and
Lloyd Bourne have been
perfect so far in the tourna
ment, while Peter Rennert
has split his two matches.
Rast knocked off Arthur
Anastopoulo and John
Hermanson by identical 6-1,
6-4 scores. Bourne (13-2)
also continued to play bril
liantly. The talented
sophomore from Pasadena
took Jeff Hull 6-4, 7-6, and in
a match of tiebreakers
slithered away from a 7-6,
7-6 victory over Mike Car
ruthers. Rennert (18-3)
downed Arthur McDonald
6-4, 7-5 yesterday, but

dropped his singles match
against ASU'sTim Anderson
6-4, 6-2.
Doubles has been a
strong point all year for the
Cardinals and despite the
loss of Wright, who is one of
the top doubles players in
the nation, the Cards' start
ing doubles teams have won
all five of the matches they
have played, dropping only
one set in the process. The
Cards are almost unbeata
ble at first doubles with the
team of McEnroe and
Mitchell, but they must
count on good perfor
mances by the sometimes
up, sometimes down team
of Maze and Rast, and the
third doubles team of Re
nnert and Bourne (8-0).
The Cards should have a
tough match but should ad
vance into the finals tomor
row against the winner of
the USC-UCLA match.
SMU, Stanford's semi-final
opponent and the No. 4
ranked team in the nation
swept the doubles against
Cal by winning 7-2. SMU
prevented an All-Pacific-8

semifinals by winning three
three-set matches against
the Bears.
UCLA is the favorite
against USC tomorrow, hav
ing beaten the Trojans twice
already in dual matches this
year. The Bruins had an easy
time with North Carolina
(7-2), and Pepperdine (6-3).
USC opened up with a win
over LSU, 6-3, and scored
the tournaments only up
set, stopping 3rd ranked
Trinity 5-4.
