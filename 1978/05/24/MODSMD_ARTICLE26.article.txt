U.N. disarmament session opens
United Nations —The U.N. General Assembly opened
a 5-week, high-level special session on disarmament
yesterday in a massive effort to slow down an arms race
costing the world almost $400 billion a year.
Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Lazar Mojsov, who
will preside over the session, reminded delegates that
major participants in the arms race have the capacity to
"kill several times over every man, woman and child in
the world."
Seventy-three top government officials, including 20
heads of state and 53 cabinet ministers, from the 149
U.N. member nations will speak.
Gay rights ordinance losing 2-1
Eugene, Ore. — tugene residents were voting 2-1 to
repeal a homosexual rights ordinance in early returns
yesterday, apparently following the lead of three other
communities that rejected similar measures.
An initial sampling of precincts in the state's second
largest city showed 7480 votes in favorof repeal and 3950
opposed, election officials said.
Both sides in the battle had predicted the vote would
be close in this university city and said there was little
chance repeal would win by the overwhelming margins
it piled up in Miami-Dade County, Fla., St. Paul, Minn.;
and Wichita, Kan.
Younger, Davis refuse challenge
Sacramento — Republican candidates for governor
Evelle Younger and Ed Davis refused a challenge yester
day from GOP contender Ken Maddy to debate Proposi
tion 13 face-to-face.
But the long-distance debate over the property tax cut
initiative by tax critic Howard Jarvis continued to domi
nate the campaign in both parties yesterday as the prim
ary race entered its final two weeks.
DemocraticGov. Edmund Brown Jr. said if Proposition
13, which cuts property taxes by 57 per cent, is adopted
by voters June 6 hewould have"nootherchoice" except
to cut government services at every level.
Arabs move into arms production
Cairo, Egypt — The Arabs have gone into the arms
business in the Middle Fast and the fledgling industry
already is selling its Western-designed military hardware
in a half-dozen countries.
The Cairo-based consortium is welding Egyptian
manpower and factories, Western technology and Arab
oil dollars in an effort to lessen Arab dependence on
foreign arms makers.
Production and diversification of the four-nation Arab
arms consortium still lags far behind that of Israel, which
produces and sells jet fighters, tanks, missiles and a wide
range of other weapons.
AT&T to adopt price restraints
New York — The Carter administration's offensive
against sharp increases in inflation gained ground yes
terday when American Telephone & Telegraph Co., the
nation's largest corporation, announced it would adopt

a limited program of price and salary restraints.
But although AT&T's announcement followed salary
restraint pledges by such corporate giants as General
Motors and Ford, there appeared to be no concerted
effort by other major companies to fall in line.
AT&T, whose Bell System services 121 million tele
phones in the United States, said it would freeze basic
salaries for its top 430 executives for the rest of the year,
although merit increases of less than 5 per cent still
would be allowed.
Natural gas compromise wins vote
Washington — In the first major breakthrough on Pres
ident Jimmy Carter's energy program in months, House
energy conferees voted 13 to 12 yesterday to accept a
proposed compromise calling for natural gas deregula
tion in 1985.
The action appeared to end the long stalemate on
natural gas pricing that has delayed all progress on Car
ter's energy program.
Although Senate conferees must also vote on the
proposal both proponents and opponents of the mea
sure conceded that there are enough Senate votes to
approve the plan.
The Senate negotiators will vote today.
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), leader of the Senate
negotiators, predicted a 10-7 margin among Senate
negotiators in support of the plan.
Death penalty initiative on ballot
Sacramento — The sponsor of an initiative to broaden
California's death penalty said yesterday he had col
lected 400,000 valid signatures for the measure — over
85,000 more than needed.
Sen. John Briggs (R-Fullerton) said he spent about half
a million dollars on the campaign to collect the signa
tures to place the measure on the November ballot.
The law requires 312,000 valid signatures of registered
voters to place such a measure on the ballot. The secret
ary of state's office must certify any November ballot
initiative by June 29.
Briggs said his measure broadened the death penalty
categories to include "virtually any act of murder."
He said hewould formally present some of the 400,000
signatures collected to the Los Angeles County Registrar
of Voters' office tomorrow.
Dow Jones drops 10.13
New York — The stock market, suffering from a new
outbreak of inflation jitters, dropped sharply yesterday
in selling that wiped out the gains of the previous ses
sion. >
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 8.57 on
Monday, fell back 10.13 to 845.29. It was the biggest
setback for the average since it gave up 11.35 points on
May 3.
New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 33.23 mill
ion shares, up from 28.68 million Monday.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair and cool through tomorrow. Lows in the
mid 40s to lowsos. Highs both days in the upper 50s and

United Nations —The U.N. General Assembly opened
a 5-week, high-level special session on disarmament
yesterday in a massive effort to slow down an arms race
costing the world almost $400 billion a year.
Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Lazar Mojsov, who
will preside over the session, reminded delegates that
major participants in the arms race have the capacity to
"kill several times over every man, woman and child in
the world."
Seventy-three top government officials, including 20
heads of state and 53 cabinet ministers, from the 149
U.N. member nations will speak.
Gay rights ordinance losing 2-1
Eugene, Ore. — tugene residents were voting 2-1 to
repeal a homosexual rights ordinance in early returns
yesterday, apparently following the lead of three other
communities that rejected similar measures.
An initial sampling of precincts in the state's second
largest city showed 7480 votes in favorof repeal and 3950
opposed, election officials said.
Both sides in the battle had predicted the vote would
be close in this university city and said there was little
chance repeal would win by the overwhelming margins
it piled up in Miami-Dade County, Fla., St. Paul, Minn.;
and Wichita, Kan.
Younger, Davis refuse challenge
Sacramento — Republican candidates for governor
Evelle Younger and Ed Davis refused a challenge yester
day from GOP contender Ken Maddy to debate Proposi
tion 13 face-to-face.
But the long-distance debate over the property tax cut
initiative by tax critic Howard Jarvis continued to domi
nate the campaign in both parties yesterday as the prim
ary race entered its final two weeks.
DemocraticGov. Edmund Brown Jr. said if Proposition
13, which cuts property taxes by 57 per cent, is adopted
by voters June 6 hewould have"nootherchoice" except
to cut government services at every level.
Arabs move into arms production
Cairo, Egypt — The Arabs have gone into the arms
business in the Middle Fast and the fledgling industry
already is selling its Western-designed military hardware
in a half-dozen countries.
The Cairo-based consortium is welding Egyptian
manpower and factories, Western technology and Arab
oil dollars in an effort to lessen Arab dependence on
foreign arms makers.
Production and diversification of the four-nation Arab
arms consortium still lags far behind that of Israel, which
produces and sells jet fighters, tanks, missiles and a wide
range of other weapons.
AT&T to adopt price restraints
New York — The Carter administration's offensive
against sharp increases in inflation gained ground yes
terday when American Telephone & Telegraph Co., the
nation's largest corporation, announced it would adopt

a limited program of price and salary restraints.
But although AT&T's announcement followed salary
restraint pledges by such corporate giants as General
Motors and Ford, there appeared to be no concerted
effort by other major companies to fall in line.
AT&T, whose Bell System services 121 million tele
phones in the United States, said it would freeze basic
salaries for its top 430 executives for the rest of the year,
although merit increases of less than 5 per cent still
would be allowed.
Natural gas compromise wins vote
Washington — In the first major breakthrough on Pres
ident Jimmy Carter's energy program in months, House
energy conferees voted 13 to 12 yesterday to accept a
proposed compromise calling for natural gas deregula
tion in 1985.
The action appeared to end the long stalemate on
natural gas pricing that has delayed all progress on Car
ter's energy program.
Although Senate conferees must also vote on the
proposal both proponents and opponents of the mea
sure conceded that there are enough Senate votes to
approve the plan.
The Senate negotiators will vote today.
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), leader of the Senate
negotiators, predicted a 10-7 margin among Senate
negotiators in support of the plan.
Death penalty initiative on ballot
Sacramento — The sponsor of an initiative to broaden
California's death penalty said yesterday he had col
lected 400,000 valid signatures for the measure — over
85,000 more than needed.
Sen. John Briggs (R-Fullerton) said he spent about half
a million dollars on the campaign to collect the signa
tures to place the measure on the November ballot.
The law requires 312,000 valid signatures of registered
voters to place such a measure on the ballot. The secret
ary of state's office must certify any November ballot
initiative by June 29.
Briggs said his measure broadened the death penalty
categories to include "virtually any act of murder."
He said hewould formally present some of the 400,000
signatures collected to the Los Angeles County Registrar
of Voters' office tomorrow.
