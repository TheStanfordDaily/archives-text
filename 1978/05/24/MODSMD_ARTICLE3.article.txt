# Nurses may strike at Stanford Hospital
## 
### 
Unless registered nurses are made
to pay mandatory dues in order to
work at Stanford Hospital they may
go on strike, according to a spokes
person of the Committee for Recog
nition of Nursing's Achievements
(CRONA).
Kathy Barnett, a CRONA member
who works in the Coronary Care
Unit, told the Dailyyesterday that un
less Hospital management and
CRONA negotiators can come to an
agreement about the dues, also
known as agency shop, "the possibil
ity of a strike does exist."
Management and CRONA
negotiators went into discussions
April 25. The nurses'contract expires
|une 30.
CRONA is recognized by the Hos
pital as the sole collective bargaining
representative for registered nurses.
The nurses' union is also negotiat
ing for improved parking conditions
primarily for evening shifts, time off
for CRONA officers, an increase
from five to seven days for maximum
vacation time and an increase in an
nual hospital contribution to an Indi
vidual Retirement Account (IRA)
program.
According to Barnett, the IRA
program has shown tremendous
success since a 1976 collective bar

gaining agreement in which the
majority of nurses decided to estab
lish an IRA as their retirement benefit
from the hospital.
About 650 nurses have established
an IRA with Wells Fargo Bank, the
custodian of all IRAs for CRONA
members, Barnett said. This consti
tutes approximately an 88 per cent
participation.
Barnett said that making sure the
IRA program is successful has taken a
great deal of personal ti me, over 2000
hours during the past few months,
but she said she is confident the
worst is behind her.
"It's been an uphill climb all the
way," she commented, "but it's
worthwhile to know that, in a few
years, these nurses will be directly
benefiting from this program."
CRONA negotiators include Linda
Simpson, Marcie Singhaus, Charlene
Plourde, Joanna Nelson and Barbara
Duci.
Management negotiators are
Joseph Ross, associate director of
personnel; Carol Sasso, personnel
manager; Duane Walker, director of
nursing; Priscilla Wheeler, legal
counsel; and Carol Ann Hoshour,
recorder of minutes.
Ross declined to comment on the
nursing negotiations.
