# Senate finance allocations violate ASSU Constitution
## 
### Gary Fremerman 
This year's ASSU Senate — along
with others since 1970 — has allo
cated student money in apparent vio
lation of its own constitutional fi
nance provisions.
Since 1970 the senate discretionary
fund has been listed in the ASSU
budget as an administrative item,
which is to be used for the senate's
own operations and for such bodies
as ASSU task forces and committees.
In the University's 1970 acceptance
of the current constitution's finance
provisions, then-University Presi
dent Kenneth Pitzer approved a
student-funding mechanism.
However, Pitzer made it clear that
"Funds for programs sponsored by
ASSU, such as commissions, publica
tions, or other member groups, are
to be paid directly by the student
body as a supplement to the Univer
sity's regular tuition. The amount of
this ASSU 'program fee' will be de
termined by members of the Associa
tion, via referendum."
The program fee and other fee as
sessments permitted only students
to allocate funds for student groups.
But this year's senate gave more
than three-fourths of its discretio
nary fund to organizations and prog
rams. The senate, and not the stu
dents, approves and maintains this
fund.
Virtually all groups and programs
that received discretionary funds this
year ate either ASSU-member
groups or are considered co
sponsored by the ASSU, said Greg
Larson, a former Council of Presi
dents member.
Therefore, this year's senate appa
rently violated the finance provisions
set forth by the University because it
gave discretionary funds not ap
proved by students to groups and
programs which can be funded only
by the program fee or other fee as
sessments.
The finance provisions were made
in 1969 partly in response to charges
that for several years the senate's dis
tributions of student funds had been
guided by political concerns.
Prior to 1970 the political composi
tion of the senate determined which

groups would be funded. There
seems to be a striking similarity this
year.
This year's senate is dominated by
the progressive and minority coali
tion, Stanford Organizing Commit
tee (SOC). Because last year's senate
failed to fulfill its obligation to ap
prove this year's budget, this year's
"SOC senate" had to approve its
own budget.
The senate first tripled its dis
cretionary fund from $1500 to $4000

and since then, it has allocated more
than 40 per cent of this fund to SOC
groups and programs. The SOC
sponsored Disorientation Week re
ceived $1000 of this fund.
Last week, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons questioned this senate's
— and previous senates' — use of
student money without direct stu
dent approval.
"I've heard the point made that the
senate is undercutting its own sys
tem of allocating funds to programs
and activities," Lyons said.
Miles White, ASSU financial man
ager, said the senate should not be
come "a central funding body for
student organizations.
"The senate, being political,
shouldn't be funding programs, be
cause the purpose of the program
fee was to allow students to approve
funding programs," he said.
"The program fee was created to
avoid politicization of funding to
programs," he added.
Larson agreed the senate should
not be spending discretionary funds
on projects or groups independent
of its own operations.
"We're ignoring the 1969 mandate
of student controls," Larson said.
Senate chairperson Fred Grethel
said previous senates had spent dis
cretionary funds on groups and
programs because the program fee
assessment had not been large
enough for all the groups needing

money.
Grethel, an SOC member, also
said inadequate financial records
prevented the senate's knowing
about restrictions on the discretio
nary fund.
"We never knew the discretionary
fund shouldn't go to programming,"
he said.
"We didn't know and every senate
in previous years hasn't known."
Grethel said Lyons was question
ing the use of the discretionary fund
partly "because Lyons didn't like the
political atmosphere this year."
The doubling to $2 of next year's
program fee will provide funding for
many other groups, Grethel said. As
a result, the senate will not have to
use its discretionary fund for this
purpose, he added.
Bill Lape, next year's financial
manager, said the University may not
approve next year's ASSU budget
until an understanding on the dis
cretionary fund is reached.

"We didn't know and every senate
in previous years hasn't known."
Grethel said Lyons was question
ing the use of the discretionary fund
partly "because Lyons didn't like the
political atmosphere this year."
The doubling to $2 of next year's
program fee will provide funding for
many other groups, Grethel said. As
a result, the senate will not have to
use its discretionary fund for this
purpose, he added.
Bill Lape, next year's financial
manager, said the University may not
approve next year's ASSU budget
until an understanding on the dis
cretionary fund is reached.
This year's ASSU Senate — along
with others since 1970 — has allo
cated student money in apparent vio
lation of its own constitutional fi
nance provisions.
Since 1970 the senate discretionary
fund has been listed in the ASSU
budget as an administrative item,
which is to be used for the senate's
own operations and for such bodies
as ASSU task forces and committees.
In the University's 1970 acceptance
of the current constitution's finance
provisions, then-University Presi
dent Kenneth Pitzer approved a
student-funding mechanism.
However, Pitzer made it clear that
"Funds for programs sponsored by
ASSU, such as commissions, publica
tions, or other member groups, are
to be paid directly by the student
body as a supplement to the Univer
sity's regular tuition. The amount of
this ASSU 'program fee' will be de
termined by members of the Associa
tion, via referendum."
The program fee and other fee as
sessments permitted only students
to allocate funds for student groups.
But this year's senate gave more
than three-fourths of its discretio
nary fund to organizations and prog
rams. The senate, and not the stu
dents, approves and maintains this
fund.
Virtually all groups and programs
that received discretionary funds this
year ate either ASSU-member
groups or are considered co
sponsored by the ASSU, said Greg
Larson, a former Council of Presi
dents member.
Therefore, this year's senate appa
rently violated the finance provisions
set forth by the University because it
gave discretionary funds not ap
proved by students to groups and
programs which can be funded only
by the program fee or other fee as
sessments.
The finance provisions were made
in 1969 partly in response to charges
that for several years the senate's dis
tributions of student funds had been
guided by political concerns.
Prior to 1970 the political composi
tion of the senate determined which

groups would be funded. There
seems to be a striking similarity this
year.
This year's senate is dominated by
the progressive and minority coali
tion, Stanford Organizing Commit
tee (SOC). Because last year's senate
failed to fulfill its obligation to ap
prove this year's budget, this year's
"SOC senate" had to approve its
own budget.
The senate first tripled its dis
cretionary fund from $1500 to $4000

and since then, it has allocated more
than 40 per cent of this fund to SOC
groups and programs. The SOC
sponsored Disorientation Week re
ceived $1000 of this fund.
Last week, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons questioned this senate's
— and previous senates' — use of
student money without direct stu
dent approval.
"I've heard the point made that the
senate is undercutting its own sys
tem of allocating funds to programs
and activities," Lyons said.
Miles White, ASSU financial man
ager, said the senate should not be
come "a central funding body for
student organizations.
"The senate, being political,
shouldn't be funding programs, be
cause the purpose of the program
fee was to allow students to approve
funding programs," he said.
"The program fee was created to
avoid politicization of funding to
programs," he added.
Larson agreed the senate should
not be spending discretionary funds
on projects or groups independent
of its own operations.
"We're ignoring the 1969 mandate
of student controls," Larson said.
Senate chairperson Fred Grethel
said previous senates had spent dis
cretionary funds on groups and
programs because the program fee
assessment had not been large
enough for all the groups needing

money.
Grethel, an SOC member, also
said inadequate financial records
prevented the senate's knowing
about restrictions on the discretio
nary fund.
"We never knew the discretionary
fund shouldn't go to programming,"
he said.
"We didn't know and every senate
in previous years hasn't known."
Grethel said Lyons was question
ing the use of the discretionary fund
partly "because Lyons didn't like the
political atmosphere this year."
