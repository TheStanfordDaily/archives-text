# Warnke says:
## Arms accord would 'enhance stability' 
### 
Washington (AP) — Chief U.S. arms
negotiator Paul Warnke said yester
day this country would win any
strategic arms race with the Soviet
Union if the current arms limitation
talks collapsed.
But, Warnke said, U.S. security
would be enhanced by a new accord
to bring stability to the two super
powers' military relationship.
"That's the only reason we're in
it," Warnke told The Associated
Press on the eve of a new round of
possibly climactic negotiations here
and in New York. "It's not philan
thropy."
If a strategic arms limitation treaty
(SALT) is not signed and ratified, the
United States is determined to keep
the Russians from gaining any sort of
strategic advantage, he said.
"We've got the will and the re
sources to do that," Warnke said
firmly. "I just have no doubt that if
there is going to be an unbridled
competition, we can match them and
we can outmatch them. That's one of
the things that gives us a strong
negotiating position.
"If the Soviet Union thought that
in the absence of SALT they could
gain strategic superiority they would
have no interest, believe me, in
negotiating SALT, he said, adding:

"One of the principal incentives is
that they recognize we can keep up
with any competition they can
mount."
Three major issues remain unre
solved as Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance and Warnke head into talks
with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko.
The negotiations will be held out
side the special U.N. disarmament
conference in New York and then,
into the weekend, in Washington.
The three issues center on U.S. ef
forts to restrain the Russians in mod
ernizing new missiles and in deploy
ing the bomber known to the West as
the Backfire, as well as on clarifying
the permissible range of American
pilotless cruise missiles.
All of the issues will be reviewed
with Gromyko but, Warnke said, "it's
i mpossi ble to tell" whether there will
be a breakthrough.
While some details of the prospec
tive new treaty could be left for Pres
ident Carter to iron out with Soviet
President Leonid Brezhnev, the main
outline of the accord would have to
be completed before there is a sum
mit meeting, Warnke said.
And it is unlikely Congress will
take up ratification before the end of
the year, he added.
