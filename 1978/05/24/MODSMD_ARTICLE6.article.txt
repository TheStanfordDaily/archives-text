Kinshasa, Zaire (AP) — French paratroopers
found the bodies of 18 more massacred whites in
battle-torn Kolwezi, a European relief official here
reported yesterday. French and Zaire government
forces in the southern Zaire city awaited word
from Paris, meanwhile, on their next step in the
war in Shaba Province.
French soldiers sweeping through the bush out
side the city also found 20 terrified French women
and children hiding from a rebel gang that had
killed all their husbands and fathers, a Defense
Ministry spokesman said in Paris.
He said the women and children were unaware
that a French and Belgian airborne force had dri
ven the rebels from the area over the weekend.
The spokesman said the ministry also had re
ceived "unofficial information" that the French
troops had discovered about 20 bodies, apparent
victims of last week's rebel rampage in Kolwezi, at
a new massacre site Monday.
The ministry spokesman said the number of

foreigners murdered in Kolwezi during the rebel
occupation may have exceeded 200, but a precise
count could not yet be made.
"In the confusion, some bodies may have been
counted twice, and others are still being found
every day,"he said.
Few details were available about the twin dis
coveries of survivors and dead. It was not known
whether they were connected.
The European official here, who asked not to be
identified, said as many as 300 Europeans may still
be unaccounted for. It is believed that some might
be hostages in the hands of the retreating rebels.
Streams of black refugees began returning from
he bush to Kolwezi yesterday, but the French
commander there warned that they faced starva
tion and epidemics.
"We are in a dead city," Col. Yves Gras told
reporters in Kolwezi. He said there was no water,
electricity or food, and with the city's vital copper
mines shut down, no income.

At Kinshasa's airport, nine American C-141 cargo
planes stood in line, awaiting new orders from
Washington. They were the last of 18 U.S. trans
ports that shuttled fuel and military supplies into
Shaba Province for the French and Belgian parat
roops who rescued survivors among 2500 foreig
ners trapped in Kolwezi by the 2-week-old rebel
invasion.
State Department spokesman Thomas Reston
said in Washington the Carter administration was
studying the possibility of providing continued air
transport for the Shaba relief effort, though the
planes would not enter the battle area.
Zaire's president, Mobutu Sese Seko, was in
Paris yesterday at a summit meeting of French
leaders and the heads of 22 African nations,
It was believed that the Zairean leader, whose
army retreated before the rebel invaders, was lob
bying for the formation of an inter-African force to
assume responsibility for the security of Shaba.
