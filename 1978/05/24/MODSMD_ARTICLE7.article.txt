# School of Education dean to step down, pursue research
## 
### Rob Lempert 
When Arthur Coladarci, dean of the
Graduate School of Education, steps
down from his administrative post next
year, he will leave behind a job that gave
him much joy and few miseries.
"I enjoy it almost too much," he said of
his job as the head of the nation's
number-one ranked school of education.
"In all of its excitements, accomplish
ments, failures, puzzles, opportunities,
constraints and complexities, I have al
most never been sorry that I accepted
appointment — and those moments of
doubt and unhappiness were brief and
infrequent," he added.
Coladarci, whose resignation from the
deanship will become effective Sep
tember 1,1979, is stepping down for two
reasons.
Turn over
"I think deans should turn over every
once and a while," he said. Long tenured
deanship is not concurrent with the con
tinued growth of a school or a depart
ment. Deans can start taking themselves
too seriously and stop listening to new
voices and suggestions, he added.
In September Coladarci will have been
dean for nineyears. Though he is not sure
exactly how long is too long for a dean to
serve, Coladarci said nine years is close
enough.
Coladarci said his second reason for
stepping down is that many of the School
of Education's faculty members will retire
soon and he thinks it is appropriate for a

new dean to come in with the several new
professors.
Prof life
When he leaves his administrative
work behind, Coladarci will return to the
life of a professor. A psychologist by train
ing, he will teach educational psychol
ogy, administrative techniques and in
ternational development in education.
Coladarci said he is not yet sure what
research topics he will turn to. After
being away from personal study for al
most a decade, he said he needs some
time to decide in which areas he wants to
work.
To get this decision-making time, but
more importantly, to get out of the way of
the new dean, Coladarci said he plans to
take a sabbatical when he leaves his pre
sent post.
The School of Education has 500 stu
dents and 40 faculty members divided
into six programs: policy analysis,
teacher education, international de
velopment education, mathematical
methods of educational research,
psychological studies and social sciences
in education.
'Benign conspiracy'
The goal of the school, as Coladarci
puts it, is a "benign conspiracy to infil
trate educational practice and research
with fine minds, highly developed com
petence and heuristic energy."
More than half the school's graduates
become college professors, many of
them in other schools of education.

Others become administrators, while
others join foundations and government
agencies which fund educational prog
rams and develop educational policy.
Coladarci has nothing but praise for his
associates.
"I felt honored when I was asked to be
dean, and I have never felt anything else.
Not many other deans can say that. We
have good faculty, students, staff and
administrators," he said.
'Fiercely proud'
"When I travel to visit other schools,"
he added, "I always come back fiercely
proud of the faculty here."
The University administration is also
helpful, Coladarci said. Instead of de
manding programs for the sake of prog
rams or spending for the sake of spend
ing, the administration puts pressure on
the dean and his faculty to justify their
activities on grounds of their educational
value. Coladarci said that's the kind of
pressure he likes to see.
Coladarci's faith in the school is backed
up by polls across the country. For many
years Stanford has ranked among the top
few education schools in the nation and
recently acquired the number one rank
ing.
"Harvard, Chicago and Stanford are all
at about the same level," Coladarci said
"If some want to call us better, I won't
argue."
Coladarci gives much of the credit to
his predecessor, H. Thomas James, who
brought most of the present faculty to the

school.
"The work of previous deans has made
us number one," he said.
4 a.m.
But the standards of excellence set by
the hard-working Coladarci — he some
times starts work as early as 4 a.m.—have

done much to promote the school's qual
ity and reputation.
One of the major problems that will
face Coladarci's graduates in the future is
the question of accountability on the part
of the educator, according to the dean.
Coladarci cited another problem for
education as the return to basics. He said
the desire of many school systems to cut
out the frills and stress the "Three Rs" is
often based more on emotion than on a

rational decision. He said he is worried
because for many people, the basics
don't include aesthetic components like
art and music.
Unpredictable
Coladarci said the big question facing
education in California is Proposition 13.
He said the effects of the initiative are
unpredictable, but it is sure to affect the
public schools. He added he sees little
choice for many districts other than firing
a number of their teachers.
Coladarci was reluctant to predict the
problems and challenges that will face his
successor.
"To predict is dangerous," he said,
"especially the future." But he did men
tion minority enrollment as one possible
area of concern.
In relation to other schools, Stanford
does fairly well on affirmative action, he
said, but applications from minority stu
dents have been dropping all over the
country. Coladarci said the next dean
might want to face this problem.
Coladarci has only taken a light work
load recently because he is recovering
from open heart surgery. In April, one of
his heart valves was replaced by that of a
pig in an operation similar to the one John
Wayne had. In fact, both men had them at
the same time, but as Coladarci said, "he
got all the press."
Coladarci will return to a full work load
on June 5. "I don't want anyone to think
I'm resigning because of my health," he
said.

dean for nineyears. Though he is not sure
exactly how long is too long for a dean to
serve, Coladarci said nine years is close
enough.
Coladarci said his second reason for
stepping down is that many of the School
of Education's faculty members will retire
soon and he thinks it is appropriate for a

new dean to come in with the several new
professors.
Prof life
When he leaves his administrative
work behind, Coladarci will return to the
life of a professor. A psychologist by train
ing, he will teach educational psychol
ogy, administrative techniques and in
ternational development in education.
Coladarci said he is not yet sure what
research topics he will turn to. After
being away from personal study for al
most a decade, he said he needs some
time to decide in which areas he wants to
work.
To get this decision-making time, but
more importantly, to get out of the way of
the new dean, Coladarci said he plans to
take a sabbatical when he leaves his pre
sent post.
The School of Education has 500 stu
dents and 40 faculty members divided
into six programs: policy analysis,
teacher education, international de
velopment education, mathematical
methods of educational research,
psychological studies and social sciences
in education.
'Benign conspiracy'
The goal of the school, as Coladarci
puts it, is a "benign conspiracy to infil
trate educational practice and research
with fine minds, highly developed com
petence and heuristic energy."
More than half the school's graduates
become college professors, many of
them in other schools of education.

Others become administrators, while
others join foundations and government
agencies which fund educational prog
rams and develop educational policy.
Coladarci has nothing but praise for his
associates.
"I felt honored when I was asked to be
dean, and I have never felt anything else.
Not many other deans can say that. We
have good faculty, students, staff and
administrators," he said.
'Fiercely proud'
"When I travel to visit other schools,"
he added, "I always come back fiercely
proud of the faculty here."
The University administration is also
helpful, Coladarci said. Instead of de
manding programs for the sake of prog
rams or spending for the sake of spend
ing, the administration puts pressure on
the dean and his faculty to justify their
activities on grounds of their educational
value. Coladarci said that's the kind of
pressure he likes to see.
Coladarci's faith in the school is backed
up by polls across the country. For many
years Stanford has ranked among the top
few education schools in the nation and
recently acquired the number one rank
ing.
"Harvard, Chicago and Stanford are all
at about the same level," Coladarci said
"If some want to call us better, I won't
argue."
Coladarci gives much of the credit to
his predecessor, H. Thomas James, who
brought most of the present faculty to the

school.
"The work of previous deans has made
us number one," he said.
4 a.m.
But the standards of excellence set by
the hard-working Coladarci — he some
times starts work as early as 4 a.m.—have

done much to promote the school's qual
ity and reputation.
One of the major problems that will
face Coladarci's graduates in the future is
the question of accountability on the part
of the educator, according to the dean.
Coladarci cited another problem for
education as the return to basics. He said
the desire of many school systems to cut
out the frills and stress the "Three Rs" is
often based more on emotion than on a

rational decision. He said he is worried
because for many people, the basics
don't include aesthetic components like
art and music.
Unpredictable
Coladarci said the big question facing
education in California is Proposition 13.
He said the effects of the initiative are
unpredictable, but it is sure to affect the
public schools. He added he sees little
choice for many districts other than firing
a number of their teachers.
Coladarci was reluctant to predict the
problems and challenges that will face his
successor.
"To predict is dangerous," he said,
"especially the future." But he did men
tion minority enrollment as one possible
area of concern.
In relation to other schools, Stanford
does fairly well on affirmative action, he
said, but applications from minority stu
dents have been dropping all over the
country. Coladarci said the next dean
might want to face this problem.
Coladarci has only taken a light work
load recently because he is recovering
from open heart surgery. In April, one of
his heart valves was replaced by that of a
pig in an operation similar to the one John
Wayne had. In fact, both men had them at
the same time, but as Coladarci said, "he
got all the press."
Coladarci will return to a full work load
on June 5. "I don't want anyone to think
I'm resigning because of my health," he
said.


Dean Arthur Coladarci
When Arthur Coladarci, dean of the
Graduate School of Education, steps
down from his administrative post next
year, he will leave behind a job that gave
him much joy and few miseries.
"I enjoy it almost too much," he said of
his job as the head of the nation's
number-one ranked school of education.
"In all of its excitements, accomplish
ments, failures, puzzles, opportunities,
constraints and complexities, I have al
most never been sorry that I accepted
appointment — and those moments of
doubt and unhappiness were brief and
infrequent," he added.
Coladarci, whose resignation from the
deanship will become effective Sep
tember 1,1979, is stepping down for two
reasons.
Turn over
"I think deans should turn over every
once and a while," he said. Long tenured
deanship is not concurrent with the con
tinued growth of a school or a depart
ment. Deans can start taking themselves
too seriously and stop listening to new
voices and suggestions, he added.
In September Coladarci will have been
dean for nineyears. Though he is not sure
exactly how long is too long for a dean to
serve, Coladarci said nine years is close
enough.
