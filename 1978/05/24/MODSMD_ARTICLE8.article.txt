# Hope for the future
## Seeking out all the maybes 
### 
Allan Chen

Since this will be my last column
for the year, I will revert to the first
person voice so that I may write
about my personal vision of an im
portant topic: the future.
For those of you who are already
feeling skeptical, this is no attempt to
prognosticate the most plausible of
all worlds, or the most desirable. No
thing can be said about the future
with any certainty. This is only an
exercise in long range thinking,
something that we students are too
often unacquainted with, as well as
an attempt to instill some hope into
what seems a dismal future.
The common argument runs this
way: we are witnessing the last days
of Man/Woman on earth. Fully 40 per
cent of the human race, most of them
in the developing nations, is surviv
ing at a bare minimum of subsistence,
and the number is expected to grow.
Industrial society consumes more
natural resources each year, and de
grades the environment from the
deepest ocean abyss to the
ozonosphere with pollution.
People will be less educated; vio
lence, poverty, racial tension and
crime will increase. International
tensions will heighten as nations
compete for dwindling resources.
The spector of the nuclear arms build
ups, and the proliferation of nuc
lear weapons to other countries,
hangs over our head like the Sword
Of Damocles. Surely this is a dismal
prospect for the young, who will
have to live the rest of theirlives with
a steady, inexorable worsening of
the quality of life.
My own vision of the future is
quantitatively, not qualitatively diffe
rent. The idea took shape one night
last summer. On an impulse, I de
cided to cross the country by bus to
my home in New York, and I found
myself that night, reading Juvenal's
Satires while passing through
Nevada.
Juvenal's portrait of a decadent
Rome, beset by gamblers, prosti
tutes, cadgers and gluttons just be
fore the fall of the Empire, was ironi
cally and uncomfortably close to

what I saw out the window as I read.
Could it happen again?
Rome fell, and for centuries, there
was a Dark Age. But historians tell us
that 'Dark' is a misnomer. The Dark
Ages were a time of consolidation
and reconstruction. The work of
synthesizing new social-political in
stitutions went on, along with the
preservation of old knowledge and
the search for new. And ultimately,
an important part of the world was
reborn.
What if human society is like a
phoenix? Does it build its own fun
eral pyre, destroy itself in that fire
and thereby purify itself? Is it then
reborn from the ashes of its won re
mains? It happened once to Euro
pean civilization; could it happen
again to the whole world?
The nuclear fire is more devastat
ing and long lasting than that which
pillaged Rome. But perhaps ultimate
destruction is not inevitable. Perhaps
nuclear conflicts can be halted be
fore they are carried to completion,
or perhaps they can be limited to cer
tain regions of the globe. Or perhaps
society will not nuclear self-destruct
at all. If it must collapse, it might'do
so out of lack of resources, apathy,
social entropy.
It is still not a bright prospect. Ul
timate nuclear destruction can never
be ruled out, and even if it doesn't
happen, all of the futures outlined
above remain too dismal to think a
bout.
What should be our response? I
believe that we have to come to
terms with the future in a mature
way. We have spent too much time
feeling sorry for ourselves, like chil
dren who refuse to face a fact. Now it
is likely that the future which will be
is not what we want, but it is also
possible that the human race will
survive the long term. This will only
happen if each of us stops running
away from the future.
We have to stop being afraid of
broadening ourselves in many fields
of knowledge. We must transform
ourselves from the self-centered to
the human centered viewpoint, and

above all, we need to live our convic
tions. All human problems, from pol
lution of the environment to the
arms race to underdevelopment,
originate with human attitudes: fear,
greed, apathy, ignorance, malice,
callousness.
Change the attitudes, change the
world. Change yourself and you
change the world in a small way. If we
do this, I suspect that we will learn
how little we really understand
others, and how poorly we under
stand the world. I don't feel that
there is anything 'inevitable' about
the future, and I know that I can still
feel surprise.
If there was one message that I
hope I have communicated in my
column writing this year, if there is
one thing I would like to communi
cate to all the world, it is this: thereis
reason to despair, but there is also
reason to hope.
The world is a vast, complex web
which we will never understand ab
solutely nor conquer completely.
There are no absolutes, there are
only maybes. If we can still seek out
those maybes, and if we can still feel
a sense of wonder about the world,
then there is indeed reason to hope
for the future.

for the year, I will revert to the first
person voice so that I may write
about my personal vision of an im
portant topic: the future.
For those of you who are already
feeling skeptical, this is no attempt to
prognosticate the most plausible of
all worlds, or the most desirable. No
thing can be said about the future
with any certainty. This is only an
exercise in long range thinking,
something that we students are too
often unacquainted with, as well as
an attempt to instill some hope into
what seems a dismal future.
The common argument runs this
way: we are witnessing the last days
of Man/Woman on earth. Fully 40 per
cent of the human race, most of them
in the developing nations, is surviv
ing at a bare minimum of subsistence,
and the number is expected to grow.
Industrial society consumes more
natural resources each year, and de
grades the environment from the
deepest ocean abyss to the
ozonosphere with pollution.
People will be less educated; vio
lence, poverty, racial tension and
crime will increase. International
tensions will heighten as nations
compete for dwindling resources.
The spector of the nuclear arms build
ups, and the proliferation of nuc
lear weapons to other countries,
hangs over our head like the Sword
Of Damocles. Surely this is a dismal
prospect for the young, who will
have to live the rest of theirlives with
a steady, inexorable worsening of
the quality of life.
My own vision of the future is
quantitatively, not qualitatively diffe
rent. The idea took shape one night
last summer. On an impulse, I de
cided to cross the country by bus to
my home in New York, and I found
myself that night, reading Juvenal's
Satires while passing through
Nevada.
Juvenal's portrait of a decadent
Rome, beset by gamblers, prosti
tutes, cadgers and gluttons just be
fore the fall of the Empire, was ironi
cally and uncomfortably close to

what I saw out the window as I read.
Could it happen again?
Rome fell, and for centuries, there
was a Dark Age. But historians tell us
that 'Dark' is a misnomer. The Dark
Ages were a time of consolidation
and reconstruction. The work of
synthesizing new social-political in
stitutions went on, along with the
preservation of old knowledge and
the search for new. And ultimately,
an important part of the world was
reborn.
What if human society is like a
phoenix? Does it build its own fun
eral pyre, destroy itself in that fire
and thereby purify itself? Is it then
reborn from the ashes of its won re
mains? It happened once to Euro
pean civilization; could it happen
again to the whole world?
The nuclear fire is more devastat
ing and long lasting than that which
pillaged Rome. But perhaps ultimate
destruction is not inevitable. Perhaps
nuclear conflicts can be halted be
fore they are carried to completion,
or perhaps they can be limited to cer
tain regions of the globe. Or perhaps
society will not nuclear self-destruct
at all. If it must collapse, it might'do
so out of lack of resources, apathy,
social entropy.
It is still not a bright prospect. Ul
timate nuclear destruction can never
be ruled out, and even if it doesn't
happen, all of the futures outlined
above remain too dismal to think a
bout.
What should be our response? I
believe that we have to come to
terms with the future in a mature
way. We have spent too much time
feeling sorry for ourselves, like chil
dren who refuse to face a fact. Now it
is likely that the future which will be
is not what we want, but it is also
possible that the human race will
survive the long term. This will only
happen if each of us stops running
away from the future.
We have to stop being afraid of
broadening ourselves in many fields
of knowledge. We must transform
ourselves from the self-centered to
the human centered viewpoint, and

above all, we need to live our convic
tions. All human problems, from pol
lution of the environment to the
arms race to underdevelopment,
originate with human attitudes: fear,
greed, apathy, ignorance, malice,
callousness.
Change the attitudes, change the
world. Change yourself and you
change the world in a small way. If we
do this, I suspect that we will learn
how little we really understand
others, and how poorly we under
stand the world. I don't feel that
there is anything 'inevitable' about
the future, and I know that I can still
feel surprise.
If there was one message that I
hope I have communicated in my
column writing this year, if there is
one thing I would like to communi
cate to all the world, it is this: thereis
reason to despair, but there is also
reason to hope.
The world is a vast, complex web
which we will never understand ab
solutely nor conquer completely.
There are no absolutes, there are
only maybes. If we can still seek out
those maybes, and if we can still feel
a sense of wonder about the world,
then there is indeed reason to hope
for the future.
