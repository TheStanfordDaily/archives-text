# Holistic environmental movement
## Symposium contradicts 'elitist' image 
### 
Bruce Rittman

The environmental movement has
been accused of being elitist because
it is largely comprised of people who
appreciate and want to preserve na
ture against the onslaught of "prog
ress." Critics suggest that environ
mentalists are interested in protect
ing pleasant, but non-essential
amenities.
In addition, these amenities are
accessible mainly to middle- and
upper-income classes, which also
form the bulk of environmentalists.
Thus, environmentalists are consi
dered elitists who put their own con
venience ahead of the needs of the
common people.
The environmental movement, I
claim to the contrary, is not funda
mentally elitist, but its scope extends
across virtually all aspects of human
existence and touches the lives of
nearly every person. Unfortunately,
the "holistic" nature of the move
ment is often over-shadowed by
highly publicized actions to stop
construction of dams and nuclear
power plants, halt discharge of
water- and air-borne wastes, and ban
certain pesticides and detergents.
Although these activities are es
sential, they tend to eclipse other as
pects, and they can thus be distorted
to suggest elitism.

The "holistic" environmental
movement is not concerned solely
with bans and pollutants, even
though they are key focus points. In
stead, the movement involves expo
sure and amelioration of inter
related exploitations of resources
and people.
Examples of resource exploitations
include water and air degradation,
urban sprawl, desertification, deple
tion of mineral and fossil fuel re
sources, and disruption of the
ecological balances by heat genera
tion, synthetic organics, urbaniza
tion, and mono-culture farming.
Humans are exploited in their work
and living communities by conges
tion, hassles, pollution, and segrega
tion.
The exploitations of resources and
humans are intimately related and
are derived from key characteristics
of our modern society: positivism,
reductionism, and capitalism. First,
positivism stresses that humankind is
able to understand and control na
ture for human benefit.
We possess the ultimate reason to
allow beneficial exploitation. Sec
ond, reductionism, which is a cor
nerstone of science, breaks systems
into smaller parts and concentrates
on the small parts individually.

Reductionism is powerful for gain
ing knowledge and exerting control,
but it is likely to increase segregation
by de-emphasizing inter-relations.
Finally, capitalism requires the ac
cumulation of wealth, which is ulti
mately derived from human labor
and natural resources. A greater rate
of capital accumulation, which is of
ficial economic policy throughout
the world, necessitates faster deple
tion and degradation of resources.
The Stanford community will have
a unique opportunity to investigate
some of the less well-publicized
facets of the "holistic" environmen
tal movement through "The Next 50
Years; The Best or the Last? A Sym
posium on Community, Resources,
and Science."
Two public events will takeplaceat
8:00 p.m. in Braun Auditorium.
One event is today and will focus
on alternative community organiza-

tion. Speakers are Ed Kirshner,
Community Ownership Organizing
Project, Berkeley; Drummond Pike,
Shalen Foundation, San Francisco;
and )ohn Mollenkopf, professor of
urban studies.
Land use is the subject of the por
gram on May 24. Phil Leveene of Ag
ricultural Economics at U.C.-
Berkleley and Daniel Nesmith of Na
tional Land for the People will par
ticipate.
In conclusion, this symposium of
fers the community a chance to
explore some of the wide-ranging
concerns of the "holistic" environ
mental movement. These concerns
are the universal ones of the com
munity in which we live and work,
the resources that we use to live, and
the science that shapes our future
lives.
