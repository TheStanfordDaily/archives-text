# Will face second-ranked UCLA for championship
## Netters advance to NCAA finals 
### Jeff Brandon 
Stanford is just a few hours away from its second
straight NCAA tennis championship.
The Cards clobbered Southern Methodist Uni
versity 7-2 yesterday in the NCAA semi-finals and
will face Pacific-8 rival UCLA for the national
championship today.
Today's match against UCLA starts at 11 a.m. PST
on another typical hot and muggy Georgia day.
The Cards, the number-one ranked tennis team
in the nation, defeated SMU in 85-degree heat in
Athens, Ca. Again, the Cards showed their awe
some singles power by winning five of the six
singles matches and making the results of the
doubles matches insignificant.
Led by freshman sensation ]ohn McEnroe (13-2)
yesterday, the Cards continued to show why they
are the dominant force in college tennis, smother
ing the number-four ranked SMU team without
much problem.
Final round
McEnroe, Matt Mitchell and Lloyd Bourne con
sistently cruised through their opponents. All of
them have advanced to the final round without
losing one set in the team tournament. McEnroe
downed Ail-American )ai DiLouie 7-5,6-1. Mitchell
(12-1) gunned down Mark Vines 6-1, 7-5 and
Bourne (14-2) took care of Pem Guerry 7-6, 6-0.
The Cards have been blessed by the fact that
Bourne, a substitute for most of the year, has come
off the bench to do a superb job. In this tourna
ment he replaced Senior Ail-American Perry
Wright who is out with a bad knee.
SMU avoided a shutout when Tom Cain de

feated John Rast on the last point of the third set
tiebreaker 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 (5-4). Bill Maze took three
sets in defeating Mark Turpin 2-6, 6-3, 6-3. When
Peter Rennert (19-3) took care of Harron Ismail 6-0,
0-6, 6-3, the Cards had their3sth straight win and a
spot in today's finals against UCLA.
Two best teams
The Cards 23-0, and the Bruins 22-2 are far and
away the two best teams in the country and neither
has had a tough time advancing to the finals. The
Bruins defeated cross-town rival USC 7-2 in the
other semifinal to earn a berth to play for the
championship.
However the Bruins are still not at full strength.
Robbie Ventnor, the Bruins number-five man is
still out with tendonitis in his right hand. But Ail-
American Jon Paley, who did not compete in either
of the previous matches against the Cards, is in the
starting lineup for UCLA.
With Wright's absence the Cards are also play
ing short handed. But Dick Gould, tennis director,
contends that if McEnroe, Maze and Mitchell play
up to their potential they could offset the loss of
Wright.
Beating UCLA
But probably the key to beating UCLA falls on
the shoulders of rommates Maze and Rast. Maze
has been known for his up-and-down play, as has
Rast. Both are top players and Gould is counting
on both to come through in today's finals.
Maze (12-5) faces John Austin, who has beaten
him three times in three meetings this year. It is
Maze's final match after a brilliant career here at
Stanford (four year starter, three times on the All-

American team). Meanwhile Rast (16-6) faces
hard-hitting Fritz Buehning on the fast Georgia
courts.
As a regular doubles team last year the Maze-
Rast pair never really reached their potential and
had a mediocre season. This year they did not play
together until Wright's injury. An encouraging
sign for Stanford is that the pair is 5-1 in singles and
2-0 in doubles so far in the tournament.
Crushed opponents
UCLA, who has crushed all its opponents this
year, with the exception of Stanford, comes into
the tournament ranked number-two. The Bruins,
who have also cruised to the finals, are led by
freshman Elliot Teltscher, who llie Nastase called
the finest young player in the world. NCAA dou
bles finalist Austin and Bruce Nichols play num
bers two and four respectively while NCAA singles
finalist Tony Graham plays three. Fritz Buehning
and the Ail-American Paley round out the top six.
Gould has emphasized that it will take a total
team effort if the Cards are to win their second
straight NCAA Championship.
But probably Stanford tennis enthusiast
Leonard Gumlia said it best: "If we play like we're
capable of playing they'll be crowning us champs
again today."

2-0 in doubles so far in the tournament.
Crushed opponents
UCLA, who has crushed all its opponents this
year, with the exception of Stanford, comes into
the tournament ranked number-two. The Bruins,
who have also cruised to the finals, are led by
freshman Elliot Teltscher, who llie Nastase called
the finest young player in the world. NCAA dou
bles finalist Austin and Bruce Nichols play num
bers two and four respectively while NCAA singles
finalist Tony Graham plays three. Fritz Buehning
and the Ail-American Paley round out the top six.
Gould has emphasized that it will take a total
team effort if the Cards are to win their second
straight NCAA Championship.
But probably Stanford tennis enthusiast
Leonard Gumlia said it best: "If we play like we're
capable of playing they'll be crowning us champs
again today."

Top Card netter and former Wimbledon semi-finalist John McEnroe led the Cards
as they trounced Southern Methodist University in the NCAA tennis finals
yesterday, beating |ai DiLouie 7-5, 6-1.
Stanford is just a few hours away from its second
straight NCAA tennis championship.
The Cards clobbered Southern Methodist Uni
versity 7-2 yesterday in the NCAA semi-finals and
will face Pacific-8 rival UCLA for the national
championship today.
Today's match against UCLA starts at 11 a.m. PST
on another typical hot and muggy Georgia day.
The Cards, the number-one ranked tennis team
in the nation, defeated SMU in 85-degree heat in
Athens, Ca. Again, the Cards showed their awe
some singles power by winning five of the six
singles matches and making the results of the
doubles matches insignificant.
Led by freshman sensation ]ohn McEnroe (13-2)
yesterday, the Cards continued to show why they
are the dominant force in college tennis, smother
ing the number-four ranked SMU team without
much problem.
Final round
McEnroe, Matt Mitchell and Lloyd Bourne con
sistently cruised through their opponents. All of
them have advanced to the final round without
losing one set in the team tournament. McEnroe
downed Ail-American )ai DiLouie 7-5,6-1. Mitchell
(12-1) gunned down Mark Vines 6-1, 7-5 and
Bourne (14-2) took care of Pem Guerry 7-6, 6-0.
The Cards have been blessed by the fact that
Bourne, a substitute for most of the year, has come
off the bench to do a superb job. In this tourna
ment he replaced Senior Ail-American Perry
Wright who is out with a bad knee.
SMU avoided a shutout when Tom Cain de

feated John Rast on the last point of the third set
tiebreaker 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 (5-4). Bill Maze took three
sets in defeating Mark Turpin 2-6, 6-3, 6-3. When
Peter Rennert (19-3) took care of Harron Ismail 6-0,
0-6, 6-3, the Cards had their3sth straight win and a
spot in today's finals against UCLA.
Two best teams
The Cards 23-0, and the Bruins 22-2 are far and
away the two best teams in the country and neither
has had a tough time advancing to the finals. The
Bruins defeated cross-town rival USC 7-2 in the
other semifinal to earn a berth to play for the
championship.
However the Bruins are still not at full strength.
Robbie Ventnor, the Bruins number-five man is
still out with tendonitis in his right hand. But Ail-
American Jon Paley, who did not compete in either
of the previous matches against the Cards, is in the
starting lineup for UCLA.
With Wright's absence the Cards are also play
ing short handed. But Dick Gould, tennis director,
contends that if McEnroe, Maze and Mitchell play
up to their potential they could offset the loss of
Wright.
Beating UCLA
But probably the key to beating UCLA falls on
the shoulders of rommates Maze and Rast. Maze
has been known for his up-and-down play, as has
Rast. Both are top players and Gould is counting
on both to come through in today's finals.
Maze (12-5) faces John Austin, who has beaten
him three times in three meetings this year. It is
Maze's final match after a brilliant career here at
Stanford (four year starter, three times on the All-

American team). Meanwhile Rast (16-6) faces
hard-hitting Fritz Buehning on the fast Georgia
courts.
As a regular doubles team last year the Maze-
Rast pair never really reached their potential and
had a mediocre season. This year they did not play
together until Wright's injury. An encouraging
sign for Stanford is that the pair is 5-1 in singles and
2-0 in doubles so far in the tournament.

UCLA, who has crushed all its opponents this
year, with the exception of Stanford, comes into
