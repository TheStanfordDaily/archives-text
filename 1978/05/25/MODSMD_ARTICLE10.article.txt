# African Liberation Day

Since 1972, people worldwide
have celebrated African Liberation
Day (May 27). Why? Because it sig
nifies people standing up against im
perialism. The system that forces Af
ricans to be virtual slaves in their own
lands is the same imperialist system
responsible for the 40 per cent black
youth unemployment here, the cities
in decay, police repression and so
cial services being slashed while we
hear cries of 'reverse discriminaton'
from the corporate-controlled
media.
The corporate owners who benefit
from this imperialist system are the

same ones who sit on the Stanford
Board of Trustees and control the
university.
So when we march on African Lib
eration Day and give powerful sup
port to the African people in their
just struggle, we are uniting with
them against our common enemy.
African Liberation Day has tradi
tionally also been the time when
people point the way forward — re
volution in Africa. As the contention
between the United States and
Soviet Union sharpens over who gets
the spoils of the imperialist plunder
of Africa, the African people are say

ing NO, that they are going to fight
for control over their land, resources
and labor till victory. Their righteous
struggle for liberation demands our
support.
Greed squeezes out profits
But we also need to draw out the
link in America. The banks and cor
porate owners (the imperialists) are
concerned with one thing — how to
make the highest profit. It is not a
matter of educating or negotiating
with them — as we have also learned
with the trustees at Stanford.
For it is not just that the corporate
owners are greedy — which they are
— but that they are all locked in
deadly competition, those making
higher profits expanding and driving
the others out of business.
So if Ford isn't in South Africa
exploiting the high rate of profit from
apartheid, CM or Chrysler will be —
and start edging Ford out of produc
tion. As a matter of fact, they are all in
there.
It is this law which, independent of
their will, drives these corporate
owners including the trustees to
squeeze as much profit out of work
ing people here and in Africa, and is
driving us to economic crisis and
world war.
On the worldwide level, the U.S.-
Soviet contention in Africa is gov
erned by the same laws of cut-throat
competition for profit that drives the
corporations inside the country (at
the government ministry level in the
USSR). The stakes have been higher
and higher and the clashes more
heated — from Angola to the Middle
East to Europe.
lust recently we saw the renewed
battle in Zaire between the two
superpowers through their proxy al
lies (France and Belgium on one side,
Cuba and East Germany on the
other). Together with the other hot
spots of contention, this marks the
special importance for us to de
monstratethis African Liberation Day
and say, "Superpowers out of Af
rica."
