# Student here describes his hobby, raising bees

A student here simultaneously improves
his neighbor's apple crop, provides his
friends with candles and beats the high cost
of sugar. Magic? No, beekeeping.
Peter Stauffer, a senior in mechanical en
gineering, has raised bees over the past
three years. He now has six hives distributed
all over Palo Alto.
The first question everyone asks about
beekeeping concerns being stung. "Getting
stung is part of keeping bees," according to
Roger Morse, author of "The Complete
Guide to Beekeeping."
Stingers
Bees use their only weapon, the stinger,
when they are threatened. They may also
sting if they think you are a flower, for they
seem to be attracted by perfumes and hair
spray. Stauffer said he rarely gets stung. He
pointed out, however, that certain proteins
in bee venom may help control arthritis, so
the pain from being stung now may protect
him later on.
Bees seem more prone to attack ankles
and faces than other parts of the body.
Beekeepers' veils are used to protect the
head, neck and shoulders. Stauffer also said
with a smile that rubber bands can be an
important part of a beekeeper's equipment.
He uses them around his pant-legs to pre
vent bees from flying up his pants.
Stinging can be prevented by taking into

account the mood of the bees before handl
ing them. Cold weather, wind, or rain can
make them more irritable. Some hives seem
to have better tempers in general than
others. One of Stauffer's hives is populated
by "rasty bees" that are always angry, while
another has gentle bees that rarely sting.
Bee smoker
A bee smoker, in which bellows are used
to produce smoke by forcing air over a burn
ing piece of burlap, is a very effective way to
calm bees. Smoke is "squirted" into the hive
before the bees are handled and it seems to
sedate them, perhaps by inducing them to
eat honey. A well-fed bee is a happy and
harmless bee.
One of Stauffer's hives is on the roof of his
garage. Putting hives above head-level
means that the bees start their flights high up
and are less likely to bother people. Putting a
fence or bushes around the hive will have
the same effect by forcing the bees to fly up
before leaving the area around the hive.
Some cities have enacted anti-beekeeping
ordinances, although bees are permitted in
this area. Eric Winkler, Deputy Agricultural
Commissioner of Santa Clara County, stated
that no more than two hives are allowed on
any one lot in Palo Alto. Hives must also be
no closer than 25 feet to a property line.
Neighbors
Stauffer said his neighbors don't mind the
bees at all, and are very interested in the

hives. Several of them, in fact, have started
beekeeping themselves.
The purpose of beekeeping is to produce
honey. Bees collect nectar from flowers and
make honey to feed other members of the
hive and to store food for the winter. Hu
mans prize honey not only for its taste but
also for the minerals and vitamins it con
tains.
Honey is very easy to digest, since it has
been pre-digested by the bees. However, it
is more fattening than sugar. One tables
poon of honey contains 61 calories, com
pared to 46 calories for granulated sugar.
Honey is expensive to buy in supermarkets,
usually costing over one dollar a pound.
Social insects
Bees have not been domesticated by man
and seem to have changed little over
thousands of years. They are social insects
who live in groups and divide the labor of
maintaining the hive among the members of
the group.
The single most important member of the
group is the queen, who lays all the eggs and
produces chemicals that keep order in the
hive. The other members of.the group are
the drones, whose sole purpose is to mate
with the queen, and the worker bees who do
the rest of the work.
Complete sets of bees, including a queen,
can be bought for between 10 and 25 dollars.
This is probably the best way for a beginner

to start a hive. Stauffer, however, said he
rescues hives of wild bees that are disturbing
people and sets them up in one of his own
hives.
Commercial hives
Commercially produced hives, in which
the bees are kept, usually consist of three
stories and look like small chests of drawers.
The bees live in the bottom story, which is
separated from the top two by a "queen
excluder" which prevents the queen from
laying eggs in the honey combs. The top two
stories are where the bees store their honey.
The bees enter the hive from a slit at the
bottom; to top of the hive is covered by
protect the bees from the weather.
Each story in the hive contains 10 vertical
movable "frames" of wood. Each frame
supports a thin piece of wax on which the
bees build their beeswax combs. The bees
store honey in the cells of these combs.
When the bees have covered a frame with
comb and filled the comb with honey, they
cap it off with wax. The beekeeper then re
moves the comb from the hive, slices off the
top layer to expose the honey, and puts the
comb in a honey extractor. This device acts
as a centrifuge, spinning the honey out of
the comb. The comb can then either be
reused by the bees or can be used as bees
wax for candles or for floor and furniture
polishes.

Once the honey is out of the comb, Stauf
fer strains it through a nylon stocking and
stores it in "big plastic buckets." Then it is
ready to eat. As Stauffer put it,"the less I do
to it, the more I like it."
Honey can be collected from a hive at al
most any time of the year. Bees feed on
different flowers at different points in the
season, and this determines the flavor of the
honey they produce. In a good year a single
hive can yield as much as 120 to 150 pounds
of honey.
Bees require no daily care. They do need a
source of water, and are attracted to swim
ming pools, freshly watered lawns and bird
baths. Stauffer said his bees often travel to
the San Franciscquito Creek for water.
Bees have been known to go as tar as eight
miles for a good source of nectar, although
they usually only cover a two to three mile
radius from their hive. Bees feed on a wide
array of flowers, including eucalyptus,
clover and orange blossoms.
Pollination by bees is essential lor the lives
of some flowering plants, such as almonds,
and improves many other plants. Stauffer
warned that insecticides and smog are
gradually killing off wild bees, which could
have drastic effects on the yields of a
number of food crops.
