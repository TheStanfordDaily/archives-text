# Students deal with anxiety, fear

Why worry?
Some psychologists theorize that anxi
ety is a learned or acquired fear. Most
people know they get nervous about cer
tain events, but few have asked them
selves why they get tense.
What causes people to get headaches
over five pages of type on paper? Or why
do back muscles tighten up when a dead
line or test date approaches?
The unknown
One major reason for anxiety is a fear of
the unknown. A common psychological
theory points to experiments where sub
jects felt the greatest anxiety when they
were waiting for the unknown shock.
People tend to be less upset when they
must cope with situations they can predict
or control.
Three students here who have had to
deal with high-stress situations agree that
the biggest reason for getting uptight is
knowing you can't control what is happen
ing. And even worse, not knowing what
will be happening.
Chris Rodriguez, a freshman who
danced in the recent Ram's Head produc
tion of "The Music Man," said her most
anxious moments were in the wings, wait
ing to go on stage.
Anticipation
"I anticipated all the things that could go
wrong: falling, my partner dropping me,
or losing a shoe," she said.

"The audience didn't make me nervous.
It's knowing that things have gone wrong
in rehearsals, and wondering if they will
happen again during a performance,"
Rodriguez said.
Interviews for acceptance into medical
schools provide a more intense type of
pressure, according to Dean Inami, a
senior pre-medical student.
"Each interview was different. I never
knew what they were going to ask," Inami
said. |
Determine the future
He knew that each half-hour interview
could determine his entire future, Inami
said. And the amount of travelling was just
as worrisome as the interviews.
When he made his trip back East, there
were a lot of uncertainties, he said.
"Bad weather, hotel reservations, late
flights, and lost luggage were all things I
worried about. I had no control over these
things, and was expecting the worst,"
Inami said.
A common way to deal with stress situa
tions is not to think about your anxiety.
Vivianne Lee, violinist in the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra, said she has never
really thought about how she deals with
the "pre-concert" pressure.
|ust keep going
"If something goes wrong, I just keep
going," Lee said. She said she tries not to
think about what's happened.

"You can't do it again, so concentrate on
the music that's coming up," she said.
All three students agreed that the best
way to alleviate worry is to feel prepared.
Lee said, "If you know you can do it, if
you've played the music extra well when
you're calm, it increases the chance that
you will play well under pressure."
Inami said, "Before the interviews, I
tried to prepare myself for anything," and
that he thought of all possible questions
that could be asked of him.
"I anticipated all my travel plans going
wrong, then planned what I would do in
stead," he added.
Audience Rives energy
"The Music Man" cast rehearsed for
four months, and Rodriguez said if they
didn't know it by performance time, they
never would. The audience gave the dan
cers more energy, she added.
"Applause encouraged us, and this al
leviated the tension because we became
more confident," she said.
"Every night before I weont on stage, I
asked God to take over," Rodriguez said.
"Then I would just go dance and have
fun," she said.
After performing in a concert, Lee said,
she feels "good knowing that I did well
under pressure."
"I put up with the interviews because I
had to," Inami said. "I just resigned myself
to what had to be done, and did it,"he
added.

tion of "The Music Man," said her most
anxious moments were in the wings, wait
ing to go on stage.
Anticipation
"I anticipated all the things that could go
wrong: falling, my partner dropping me,
or losing a shoe," she said.

"The audience didn't make me nervous.
It's knowing that things have gone wrong
in rehearsals, and wondering if they will
happen again during a performance,"
Rodriguez said.
Interviews for acceptance into medical
schools provide a more intense type of
pressure, according to Dean Inami, a
senior pre-medical student.
"Each interview was different. I never
knew what they were going to ask," Inami
said. |
Determine the future
He knew that each half-hour interview
could determine his entire future, Inami
said. And the amount of travelling was just
as worrisome as the interviews.
When he made his trip back East, there
were a lot of uncertainties, he said.
"Bad weather, hotel reservations, late
flights, and lost luggage were all things I
worried about. I had no control over these
things, and was expecting the worst,"
Inami said.
A common way to deal with stress situa
tions is not to think about your anxiety.
Vivianne Lee, violinist in the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra, said she has never
really thought about how she deals with
the "pre-concert" pressure.
|ust keep going
"If something goes wrong, I just keep
going," Lee said. She said she tries not to
think about what's happened.

"You can't do it again, so concentrate on
the music that's coming up," she said.
All three students agreed that the best
way to alleviate worry is to feel prepared.
Lee said, "If you know you can do it, if
you've played the music extra well when
you're calm, it increases the chance that
you will play well under pressure."
Inami said, "Before the interviews, I
tried to prepare myself for anything," and
that he thought of all possible questions
that could be asked of him.
"I anticipated all my travel plans going
wrong, then planned what I would do in
stead," he added.
Audience Rives energy
"The Music Man" cast rehearsed for
four months, and Rodriguez said if they
didn't know it by performance time, they
never would. The audience gave the dan
cers more energy, she added.
"Applause encouraged us, and this al
leviated the tension because we became
more confident," she said.
"Every night before I weont on stage, I
asked God to take over," Rodriguez said.
"Then I would just go dance and have
fun," she said.
After performing in a concert, Lee said,
she feels "good knowing that I did well
under pressure."
"I put up with the interviews because I
had to," Inami said. "I just resigned myself
to what had to be done, and did it,"he
added.
