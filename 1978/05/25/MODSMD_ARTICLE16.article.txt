## 'friends of the boarding house'/john nielsen A
						strange, terrific benefit for the city's finest club... 
### 
Entertainers, especially com
edians, sometimes find
themselves unexpectedly star
ing doom in the face. An audi
ence that doesn't know them, a
hostile crowd, or — horror of
horrors — an indifferent group
of people; such things can rear
their ugly heads where you
least expect it to happen.
When it does happen those
onstage often show their truest
colors; when fighting for suc
cess they often show their
greatest strengths. Trials by
that kind of fire are an educa
tion for both observers and ob
served, and when it comes off
well they can even be a bles
sing.
Last week several "Friends of
the Boarding House" staged a
benefit for David Allen at the
San Francisco Civic Auditorium
(David Allen — the Boarding
House is his baby; they staged
it so he could get a liquor
license and put himself in the
black). In the course of the
evening Allen's friends met up
with every variety of atmos
phere, and the ways in which

It was a foregone conclusion that people
were going to go crazy at the sight of Steve
Martin that evening; a sizable portion of
the crowd would have loved him had he
opened up on us with a machine gun.

they responded showed how
they got where they are. The
friends — Steve Martin,
Loudon Wainwright 111, Billy
Crystal, Robin Williams,
Melissa Manchester, |immy
Buffett, )oan Baez and Martin
Mull — they all performed
well, and carried things off
with elan, but the memorable
thing about this benefit was the
way they nailed an unruly
crowd. The benefit for the
Boarding House last week was
dominated by an extremely
obnoxious faction of the in
stant sell-out crowd, and the
things that they inspired were
wondrous to behold. It was a
benefit, with singers and com
edians, but it was also a tre
mendous evening of high
drama marked by crises, com
plications and tension. Need
less to say, those things can be
disastrous, but last week it was
magnificant to see the war
being waged.
For the most part it grew out
of the presence of Steve Mar

tin. He came on first, and the
place went absolutely nuts.
Too nuts. It was a foregone
conclusion that people were
going to go crazy at the sight of
Steve Martin that evening; a
sizable portion of the crowd
would have loved him had he
opened up on us with a
machine gun. People were
screaming more than they
were laughing, burying every
thing in the noise — when it
left it was painfully clear that
the others were in for a strug
gle. Martin was opening the
next night in Reno, and went
straight from his half-hour to
the plane, but many in the
crowd had decided that they
wanted to see no one else. He
was funny — unbearably funny
— but it was a little scary to
consider what was going to
happen to the poor soul that
had to follow him. It was em
barrassing, and hard to im
agine Martin enjoying a crowd
that appeared to the embodi
ment of those tendencies that
have inspired most of his com
edy.

Loudon Wainwright 111 was
chosen to follow, and that's
where the drama began.
Wainwright was heroic in the
face of efforts by 40 or 50 of the
7700 in the Civic to boo him off
the stage. He announced that
he was overwhelmed at our
gracious reception, and that he
would play one more song and
be gone, and when they
hooted he smiled and decided
to play five more. The lyrics to
the first were "nyea, nyea,
nyea, nyea, nyea" and before
he had finished most of us
were aware of how he had
dealt with adversity. He had
given the crowd a huge musical
rasberry, and made us look like
the fools we were.
Then Billy Crystal — he, for
the most p<?rt, simply ignored
us. He ran through what
seemed to be a well
memorized series of sketches,
one that would have come off
well on the Johnny Carson
show, but by not putting us in
our place he let things get a
little too jumpy. People had

now decided that they wanted
to see Martin Mull, and no
body else, and a couple of mo
rons in the back were begin
ning to truly appreciate the
sounds of their own voices.
Something needed to be done,
before it got ugly again. The
audience needed to be kicked
around a little. The show

needed somebody with a fast
mouth to put things back in
line.
Blasphemy
That's just what Robin Wil
liams did. He was — oh
blasphemous utterance,may I
roast in hell — funnier than
Martin, perhaps because if he
hadn't been he'd have been

eaten alive. In any case it was
obvious that he was fully capa
ble of blowing the morons in
the back to bits. They would
yell something incoherent,
and he would yell something
equally incoherent back at
them — then he'd stop and
explain to everyone else that
"its all right, folks,l speak the

language." When someone in
one of the front rows made the
mistake of getting up and head
ing for the door he yelled that
"no white man ever walks out
on me," and then put on a
cowboy hat and chased the
poor fool for 30 yards down the
aisle. Then he took an empty
seat and yelled at the stogc as if
he were still there. "You
suck!" he said, and then he
jumped into the next seat and
played his girlfriend. "Oh
Wally," was the cry, in a high
squeaky voice, "please let him
finish his wonderful act." Then
Williams jumped hack to the
first seat. "Shut up Susie, or
you're dead meat."
It was perfect. Williams
would launch into a routine
like a madman, then stop half
way through and announce
"its no good, now, I've lost
you," or "that needs work" —
he was so frenzied and so
quick and so goddamn funny
that he pretty near stole the
show.
The masses were in such a
way placated, and Melissa
Manchester (who came on and
announced that in honor of the
Boarding House's acquisition
of a liquor license she had
gone out and gotten totally

. . . perfect, and Mull was up to it, and it
was a pleasure to witness the complete
and lasting humiliation that he adminis
tered to the more vocal of our numbers

blitzed); Melissa Manchester
sang a few beautiful tributes to
Mr. Allen and his building. It
was calmer now, though still a
little restless — I kept thinking
of Loudon who had died for
our sins.
For our sins
Jimmy Buftett and Joan Baez
were there unannounced. Buf
fet preceeded Manchester,
and appeared with his leg in a
cast — he joked around and
sang well and was very well re
ceived. Joan Baez was an
nounced as "a young singer
that Steve Martin had insisted
be included in the show." Sur
prise, surprise, and they liked
her, too.
By this time, though, I was
wondering how Martin Mull
would act. Mull, after all, is
famous for his straight-faced
comedic knives in the back,
and with an audience like this it

looked like he would have a
field day. They were getting re
stless again towards the end of
the second Baez song. We
were making ourselves heard
again and by this time ap
peared ready to skewer who
ever was next. A few voices,
unfortunately, were fast be
coming familiar — in short, it
all seemed perfect for some
one like Martin Mull.
Humiliation
It was perfect, and Mull was
up to it, and it was a pleasure to
witness the complete and last
ing humiliation he adminis
tered to the more vocal of our
numbers. He paused after the
first clear insult, and wewaited
while he chose the instrument
of death — then, calmly, he
nodded his head and looked
sad. "Isn't it terrible when
cousins marry? he said, and the
idiot in the back was never
heard from again. His first song
was called "I have played some
shitholes, but this place takes
the cake."
Mull asked us what kind of
comedy we liked, and
explained that since Allen had
gone to "absolutely no ex
pense" to put the show to
gether he had developed a lit ;

tie bus lag on the way up. Then
he started into a story about
Ralph Waldo Emerson and
Henry David Thoreau and
for somebody else to
step forward and be sacrificed.
Someone did, of course —
from the back again a voice bel
lowed out "what did you say
your name was again?" And
Mull was at him, announcing
that he was writing a book
about assholes and wanted to
get everything in it. He went
through the heckler's sen
tence, and praised him on his
diction, and ingenious ignor
ance of graminer. "You should
write," he told the guy. "They
need people like you to do the
scripts for 'Love Boat.' "
Mull was last, and Mr. Allen
had his license. But he didn't
come by it in the manner you
would expect. No sir, not your
everday benefit. It was better.
