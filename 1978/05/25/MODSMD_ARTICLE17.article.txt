David Allen didn't have to
call Steve Martin and those
"friends" and ask them to do
that benefit for the financially
troubled Boarding House.
They called him. "Friends of
the Boarding House" was
hardly a euphemistic title for
their performance, as Allen
and his building are dear to the
hearts of most everyone who
goes near them. He used to be
a performer himself, you
know, and he runs the place
from a performer's point of
view.
"I'll tell you what that
means," he says when you ask
him what that means. "It
means that having been a per
former there are certain things
thatyou do in certain situations
that might otherwise be over
looked. I would neverallowfor
a room where a performer is
working to have a cash register
in it, for instance. That hap
pens sometimes. I would never
allow a mixing machine. No
body wants to be getting to the
most tender part of a ballad
and have the mixing machine
go SKREEEE right in the middle
of it. That won't happen here.
Deputy Dave
David Allen is a pleasant per
son to be around. And he's
been around. In the thirties he
was a folksinger, hanging out
on the wrong side of the tracks
with the likes of Woodie Gut
hrie, Leadbellyand Josh White.
Later he worked during televi
sion's wonder years as a pro
ducer, director and writer, and
eventually on a children's
show in which he was "Deputy
Dave."
When the TV station canned
him Allen went to work manag
ing the Hungri i. There he
began to hit his stride. While
he was at the"i" that nightclub

helped give such performers as
Woody Allen, Richard Pryor,
Kenny Rankin and Robert Klein
their starts; that seems to be a
habit that he has had much
trouble shaking. Soon after the
Hungri i folded Allen rented
the aforementioned building
on Bush Street; there he talked
Steve Martin out of giving up
his career. He helped launch
Lily Tomlin, as well; those and
other achievements have given
the Boarding House truly
mythical status in recent years.
Baffles
Has it gone to Deputy Dave's
head to be such a wonderful
guy? Nope. "Its not me," he
contends. "It's this place. An
awful lot of people don't
realize it, but this room has
perhaps the best acoustics of
any nightclub in the country.
All the funny-looking stuff on
the walls, all those sound baf
fles and reflectors and traps —
this place was originally a re
cording studio and the sound
is just magnificent. It was a re
cording studio — people say
well geeze, maybe you should
paint it or something, but I
won't, because paint can
change the sound. I have left it
the way it was engineered, and
the performers love the
room."
They do. So do audiences.
Allen appreciates his audi
ences. "I would say that the
vast majority of people who
come to the boarding house to
see a show have come to see a
show, and they have not come
to try and see if score
with some girl who's sitting on
the other side of the room, or
with some fella. I like the audi
ences. There are very few
people who have come as a
personal exhibition thing.
There's no great prestige in
being here, so the high society

group has not deigned to come
in and show themselves off, to
sit in front and flash jewelry. Its
not Las Vegas lounge. You
never see a really good per
former and sit there and cry
because he's knocking himself
out and nobody is paying at
tention. Its not like that."
The logical question
So why, comes the logical
question, if the Boarding
House is such a great place run
by such a great person featur
ing such wonderful perfor
mers, why are they in so much
trouble? Funny you shouldask,
says Mr. Allen. "The perfect
audience, for me, is one that
drinks wine and beer, and
smokes grass, and doesn't take
any kind of hard drugs or dow
ners." He'd be perfectly con
tent to fill the place with
people of that ilk forevermore
if it were possible, but Allen
realizes that times have
changed, and the wine, brew
and hoochie crowds are thin
ner than they used to be. The
Boarding House needed hard
liquor if it was to compete with
places like the Old Waldorf
and the Great American Music
Hall — it was that simple. "The
advertising people all over the
country have successfully
brainwashed the younger gen
eration into thinking that the
older generation was right —
now they want hard booze, be
cause old people drink it."
Liquor licenses today run
close to $20,000 apiece. That's
why they gave David Allen his
benefit. He has his hard booze
license now — got it last week
— and in somewhere around
two months he'll be able to
compete.
He shouldn't have much
trouble, what with the friends
he's got.

him what that means. "It
means that having been a per
former there are certain things
thatyou do in certain situations
that might otherwise be over
looked. I would neverallowfor
a room where a performer is
working to have a cash register
in it, for instance. That hap
pens sometimes. I would never
allow a mixing machine. No
body wants to be getting to the
most tender part of a ballad
and have the mixing machine
go SKREEEE right in the middle
of it. That won't happen here.
Deputy Dave
David Allen is a pleasant per
son to be around. And he's
been around. In the thirties he
was a folksinger, hanging out
on the wrong side of the tracks
with the likes of Woodie Gut
hrie, Leadbellyand Josh White.
Later he worked during televi
sion's wonder years as a pro
ducer, director and writer, and
eventually on a children's
show in which he was "Deputy
Dave."
When the TV station canned
him Allen went to work manag
ing the Hungri i. There he
began to hit his stride. While
he was at the"i" that nightclub

helped give such performers as
Woody Allen, Richard Pryor,
Kenny Rankin and Robert Klein
their starts; that seems to be a
habit that he has had much
trouble shaking. Soon after the
Hungri i folded Allen rented
the aforementioned building
on Bush Street; there he talked
Steve Martin out of giving up
his career. He helped launch
Lily Tomlin, as well; those and
other achievements have given
the Boarding House truly
mythical status in recent years.
Baffles
Has it gone to Deputy Dave's
head to be such a wonderful
guy? Nope. "Its not me," he
contends. "It's this place. An
awful lot of people don't
realize it, but this room has
perhaps the best acoustics of
any nightclub in the country.
All the funny-looking stuff on
the walls, all those sound baf
fles and reflectors and traps —
this place was originally a re
cording studio and the sound
is just magnificent. It was a re
cording studio — people say
well geeze, maybe you should
paint it or something, but I
won't, because paint can
change the sound. I have left it
the way it was engineered, and
the performers love the
room."
They do. So do audiences.
Allen appreciates his audi
ences. "I would say that the
vast majority of people who
come to the boarding house to
see a show have come to see a
show, and they have not come
to try and see if score
with some girl who's sitting on
the other side of the room, or
with some fella. I like the audi
ences. There are very few
people who have come as a
personal exhibition thing.
There's no great prestige in
being here, so the high society

group has not deigned to come
in and show themselves off, to
sit in front and flash jewelry. Its
not Las Vegas lounge. You
never see a really good per
former and sit there and cry
because he's knocking himself
out and nobody is paying at
tention. Its not like that."
The logical question
So why, comes the logical
question, if the Boarding
House is such a great place run
by such a great person featur
ing such wonderful perfor
mers, why are they in so much
trouble? Funny you shouldask,
says Mr. Allen. "The perfect
audience, for me, is one that
drinks wine and beer, and
smokes grass, and doesn't take
any kind of hard drugs or dow
ners." He'd be perfectly con
tent to fill the place with
people of that ilk forevermore
if it were possible, but Allen
realizes that times have
changed, and the wine, brew
and hoochie crowds are thin
ner than they used to be. The
Boarding House needed hard
liquor if it was to compete with
places like the Old Waldorf
and the Great American Music
Hall — it was that simple. "The
advertising people all over the
country have successfully
brainwashed the younger gen
eration into thinking that the
older generation was right —
now they want hard booze, be
cause old people drink it."
Liquor licenses today run
close to $20,000 apiece. That's
why they gave David Allen his
benefit. He has his hard booze
license now — got it last week
— and in somewhere around
two months he'll be able to
compete.
He shouldn't have much
trouble, what with the friends
he's got.
David Allen didn't have to
call Steve Martin and those
"friends" and ask them to do
that benefit for the financially
troubled Boarding House.
They called him. "Friends of
the Boarding House" was
hardly a euphemistic title for
their performance, as Allen
and his building are dear to the
hearts of most everyone who
goes near them. He used to be
a performer himself, you
know, and he runs the place
from a performer's point of
view.

him what that means. "It
