## On what to expect at our first-ever jazz blast Finest of the fusers

Stanford residents will be given a
chance to see the best of the jazz-rock
fusion this Monday when the first Stan
ford Jazz Festival takes place. Stanley
Turrentine, the Crusaders and Roy
Ayersand Übiquity, whoarethefeature
artists, have proven themselves to be
among the best crossover musicians.
The late addition of the )azz Crusad
ers was a real coup for Special Events.
The Crusaders have just come off a suc
cessful tour, while Crusader keyboar
dist )oe Sample has hit the charts with
an excellent solo album.
Roy Ayers has been a familiar name to
jazz fans for many years. Only recently,
however, has Ayers gone after the cros
sover audience; the move has proven
successful for Ayers, who has eclipsed
his past sales with his latest two albums.
Turrentine, likewise, has courted the
fusion audience, but he has consis
tently attempted more complex mate
rial. Turrentine has a very individualis
tic approach to the saxophone which
allows him to stand out even in the
most banal settings. He is an engaging
performer and his latest releases have
shown him playing the most sophisti
cated music he has attempted in several
years.
Also on the card are Esther Philips
and Les McCann. McCann's music is
perhaps more correctly labelled as
rock; nonetheless he has frequently
performed well in the company of jazz
artists. His performance at the Berkeley
|azz Festival of a few years ago showed
him off at his best. Philips is a jazz
singer deeply rooted in the blues.
For once Stanford jazz fans will be
given a chance to hear first-rate jazz on
their home ground. Hopefully the Stan
ford |azz Festival will become an annual
event.
