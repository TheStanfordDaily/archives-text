# Mr. McCann: encores
## 
### 
"This is the liveliest San Francisco has
been in a while," commented road
manager Steve MacFadyen of Les
McCann.
"In years," corrected rhythm player
Steurt Liebig.
The audience at the Great American
Music Hall responded to jazz artist Les
McCann's recent performance with ex
tended ovations, demanding three en
cores.
The intimate setting of the Hall pro
vided an opportunity for interaction be
tween the audience and McCann. He
would talk to the audience and they in
turn would yell out requests.
McCann presents more than just
music which is pleasing to the ear. Like
many artists, he is trying to say some
thing to those who listen.
In his music comes his intensity. He
oscillates between slow, pleasant
keyboards and loud, fast rhythm, often
times in the same song.
One very effective technique he used

was a battle of notes between himself
on the keyboards and lead guitarist
Nick Kirgo, which was somewhat simi
lar to "Dueling Banjos" in Deliverance.
While this occurred, the audience, im
pressed by the talents of Kirgo, waited
in anticipation.
This build up was let out through the
applause which followed the closing
number, "Compared to What?" proba
bly the group's best known song.
The band followed that song with two
encores and then left, apparently con
cluding the show. At least McCann
thought that he was finished.
But the enthusiastic audience was
not to be denied, and a few minutes
later McCann reappeared to play a song
from an upcoming album.
And then he left, and in doing so left
the audience knowing that they had
just witnessed and indeed participated
in a performance that will never be re
peated.
