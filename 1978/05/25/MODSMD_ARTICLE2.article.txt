# Student protests prompt UC regents to call special meeting
## 
### Jon Hornsby 
In response to student protests the
regents of the University of Califor
nia have called a special meeting to
hear testimony appraising policies of
investment in companies with deal
ings in South Africa.
Students at UC campuses in Ber
keley, Irvine, Davis and Riverside
held peaceful sit-ins last Thursday
calling for the special meeting. The
next day, a sufficient number of re
gents endorsed a student petition so
that )une 8 was set as the date for a
special official regents meeting in
Berkeley.
A spokesperson for the protest
movement in Berkeley said students
were pleased by the regents' action
despite a decision not to create a
committee on "social responsibility''
in investment decisions. This move
was also made during Friday's regu
lar meeting of the UC regents.
Carol Bremner, a member of Ber
keley's Students for Economic and
Racial Justice (SEPI), said the thrust of
students' efforts has been to set up
the special meeting, not especially to
set up the committee.
"We've been asking for a public
hearing for over a year," she said.
"Finally, as a result of the sit-ins, we'll
have one."
She added SER) wasn't worried
about the rejection of the proposal
for a committee on investment re
sponsibility because "when faced
with an issue, the regents tend to say,
the committee will handle this,' to
deflect attention and pressure off of

them."
One of the four regents who called
the meeting, Yori Wada, said the
meeting was scheduled because
"the regents have never really heard
the opinions and views of students,
faculty and staff on the matter of the
university's investments in South Af
rica.
"My serious concern," he said, "is
that those regents opposed to di
vestment will not be present at the
meeting."
Wada explained that there is a
sharp division of opinion between
the regents who were appointed by
former Gov. Ronald Reagan, and
those appointed by Gov. Jerry
Brown.
In fact, all Brown appointees voted
in favor of the investment responsi
bility committee and all Reagan ap
pointees voted against it.
Brown and UC President David
Saxon were present at that vote and
showed support for establishing the
committee, as well as for calling the
special meeting, Bremner said.
A widespread campaign by the
Campuses United Against Apartheid
(CUAA), with chapters at 19 Califor
nia schools including Stanford, has
been started to "pressure regents to
attend the meeting," Bremner said.
According to a statement by the
CUAA, Brown promised to attend "if
I'm in the neighborhood," and Leo
McCarthy, speaker of the state as
sembly, also said he'd go "if Jarvis-
Gann doesn't pass." Bremner also
said Saxon promised to attend.

Chris Gray, a member of the CUAA
and also part of the protest jnove
ment at Stanford, said students here
were enheartened by the news and
plan to help in the campaign to en
courage attendance at the special
meeting.
He said he felt it would be "totally
irresponsible" for the regents not to
attend because, being government
appointees, they should be account
able to the people.
"Not attending would show how
distant they are from the concept of
democracy," Cray said.
Gray and Bremnersaid they had no
doubt the meeting would not have
been called without the protests.
During the first three hours of the
meeting, up to 10 speakers for and
against divestment will present their
testimony to the regents, according
to Sarah Molla, Saxon's news rep
resentative. Then other persons,
who have requested to speak can be
heard, she said.
"We want a definite decision to be
made at the meeting, not just an air
ing of views," Bremner said. "If a
vote is reached, it may come up at the
next regular session of the regents."
Wada said he was more doubtful.
"I don't anticipate there will beany
vote," he said. "But there is a possi
bility of it being introduced in the
following meeting."
At Stanford, Trustee Parmer Fuller
and Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president for public affairs, reacted
by saying the Board of Trustees here
has gone beyond the UC regents in
the policies that they have adopted
with respect to investment responsi
bility."
"We already have students and fa
culty contributing opinions,"
Rosenzweig said. "We have a sub
committee and a commission on in
vestment responsibility. Our board
has actually voted in favor of with
drawal in one instance."

Board Chairman Peter Bing
pointed to the recent meeting bet
ween the Trustees and the Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility
and said the board hopes this will be
the fiist of a series of such meetings.
Bremner described the regents'
past responsiveness saying, "they try
to totally ignore students."
She said she hopes this latest event
is an indication that they will be more
receptive in the future.
