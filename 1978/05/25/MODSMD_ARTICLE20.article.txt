# Stanley T: ready to roar
## 
### 
Jazz saxophonist Stanley Turrentine played
music last week at Great American Music
Hall. Turrentine has proven himself to be one
of the most tasteful and energetic players in
the new "fusion" or "crossover" style of jazz
— which combines elements of both rock
and jazz — and which has been skyrocketing
in popularity ever since George Benson scat
ted his way to fame with his album
"Breezin'."
Stanley Turrentine has to be considered
one of the first real "fusion" saxophonists.
His melodic style, fat tone and frequent use
of harmonics (which extend the natural range
of the saxophone, giving you all those
screaming high notes you love to hear) have
become a standard feature of commercial
jazz playing today, one which is very different
from the bebop style of the '50s and the
freeform style of the early '60s.
After the set I went backstage to talk to
Turrentine and asked him what he liked to
call his music.
"I just call it music. The critics, they're the
ones that came up with the names. I just play
... I don't sit down and analyze it. I just play
from what I feel . . . that's it. Call it what you
want."
Turrentine's music does not compare in
depth or intensity with that of John Coltrane
or Sonny Rollins, but whose does? Mr. T's
style is tasty and soulful, not meant to stretch
the limits of jazz, just meant to be enjoyed.
And Thursday night Turrentine played a very
enjoyable set. It included some of the best
tunes he's ever recorded, like "Pieces of
Dreams," and more recently "Birdland." It
was also pleasing to hear him do some real
jazz standards ranging from the bossa nova
"More" to the Fatha Hines ballad "Anna,"
which clearly showed the versatility of his
lyrical style.
The quartet backing Turrentine up was
tight and knew how to reinforce rather than
overshadow Stanley's playing. The guitarist,
Butch Campbell, was a particularly fine
player. His extended solos never lost their
continuity and his technical ability nicely

matched his repetoire of musical ideas. At
the end of the night I asked Turrentine if he
ever ran out of new ideas.
"Sometimes, I think so. Sometimes you
might not mentally be as up. . . . It's just like
any other job; some days you have it and
some days you don't. But the majority of the
time you try to be as consistent as you possi
bly can. ... I think that's why I've been in
this business so long. There's something new
happening every time I play the horn. That
doesn't mean that to me it's always good, but
there's never a dull moment. . . . Once you
lose the energy you might as well stop play
ing."
If Stanley Turrentine can carry that energy
to the upcoming Stanford Jazz Festival, we'll
be hearing some of the best sounds that "fu
sion" jazz has to offer.
