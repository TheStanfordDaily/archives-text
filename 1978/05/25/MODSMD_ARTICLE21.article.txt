## Dracula takes the Alcazar 
### 
When Bram Stoker wrote
"Dracula" in 1897, vampires
were not, as they are now, en
tirely a laughing matter. From
Greece to Ireland, tales of the
"undead" who roamed at night
had been passed down from
generation to generation,
never completely substan
tiated, never completely dis
proved.
Indeed, in their contempor
ary volume "In Search Of
Dracula," two scholars of East
ern European history claim that
even today, belief in vampires,
like the creatures themselves,
does not die easily.
"Belief in the walking dead
and the bloodsucking vampire
may never entirely disappear.
It was only in the past century
—1823, to be exact — that Eng
land outlawed the practice of
driving stakes through the
hearts of those who had com
mitted suicide. Today, it is in
Transylvania that the vampire
legends have their strongest
hold. . .
B«id Vlad •
So there is a Transylvania (it
is a province of Romania) and
there was a Count Prat uia. but
while Stoker's Dracula was a
bloodsucking, night-walking
terror, the real Count, whose

"Christian" name was Vlad,
was merely a demented sadist
who enjoyed pushing poles
through people — "Vlad
Tepes," or "Vlad the Impaler,"
they used to call him.
"Dracul" was his father's
nickname; it means "Devil" in
Romanian. "Dracula" is a di
minutive meaning "son of the
Devil." Dracula himself even
had a son, "Vlad Tepelus," or
"the Little Impaler."
Whether or not Vlad was a
vampire, no one can say. He
was a prince who sporadically
ruled Wallachia in the fifteenth
century and became a war hero
o! sorts by crusading against
the Turks. He lived for a time in
"Castle Dracula" high in the
Carpathian Mountains of
Romania, and was decapitated
at age 45 in battle once again
with the Turks. His head was
sent to the Sultan in Constan
tinople and was openly dis
played on a stake; his body was
taken by monks to the island
monastery of Snagov near
Bucharest, where it was laid in
an unmarked grave.
All of which brings us to the
Alcazar Theater on Geary
Street in San Francisco, where
once again Count Dracula

roams. But this is a different
Dracula; instead of impaling
people, he sucks their blood,
kidnaps their babies and is in
general, a real pest. This is
Stoker's Dracula, and he is a
vampire — he can't be seen in
mirrors, convulses as the sight
of a crucifix, crumbles at the
faintest whiff of garlic. He sus
tains his own life by draining
the life from others.
Novel source
Stoker's novel has been the
source for countless horror
movies, some of which are
classic ("Nosferatu," made in
1922; "Dracula," made in
1931), most of which are not so
classic ("Billy the Kid vs.
Dracula," 1966; "Lust for a
Vampire," 1970; "Blacula,"
1972, etc.).
Several versions have been
written for the legitimate stage.
One version opened in New
York in 1927 with an unknown
Hungarian actor named Bela
Lugosi in the leading role. Cur
rently there are two versions
on Broadway, and the world
premiere of a new adaption by
F. Valentine Hooven, 111 at the
Alcazar.
The plot of Hooven's play is
rather complicated, but basi
cally deals with Dr. Seward
(Bradley Clayton) who runs an
insane asylum on an estate
south of London. His beloved
Lucy (Ann Sara Matthews) is
suffering from a curious illness
with some very strange
symptoms, among them "a
steady loss of blood, extreme
pallor, lethargy during the day,
restlessness at night. . ."all of
which leads Seward to call in a
specialist from Amsterdam,
Professor Van Helsing (Bob
Kallus), who suspects correctly
that the cause of her illness is
the next-door-neighbor, a
rather peculiar count from
Transylvania.
lonathan Harker (Andrew
Potter), who Dracula had en
gaged to procure his English
estate, is staying at Seward's

with his wife Mina (Patricia
Boyette). Harker knows all
about the Count, having been
a prisoner in his castle in
Transylvania, and tries to warn
Seward what Lucy's illness
means. Butonly after Van Hels
ing arrives and Lucy dies does
Seward believe him.
Good performances
This is the kind of stuff that
lends itself well to melodrama;
it would have been easy to
camp it up and overact, but the
actors all contain themselves,
intelligently interpreting their
roles and giving their charac
ters believability, something
close to impossible consider
ing the subject matter.
Ann Sara Matthews is an ap
propriately anemic Lucy;
Michael Neville is a fiendish
but charismatic count; Patricia
Boyette's Mina is a splendid
study of good turning to evil

(the Count sinks his teeth into
her, too).
The special effects are mar
velous, as is the score; during
the entire performance a piano
is on stage to the left, lit softly
and unobtrusively by blue
light.
It is unfortunate that the final
performance of "Dracula" will
be this Sunday night; the show
must close due to poor ticket
sales. It's too bad, for this is
truly a fine production.
