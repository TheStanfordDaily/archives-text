## Jarreau glows 
### 
Proving once again to be a
vibrant and appealing per
former, Al Jarreau returned to
San Francisco with a short, but
nonetheless pleasing concert
last Friday evening. The Old
Waldorf was jammed to capac
ity as Jarreau stepped into the
lights and glowed with exuber
ant energy and style.
Tailor-made for Jarreau's
many fans, the concert began
with "So Long Girl" and co
vered the artist's best numbers
from "Take Five" to "We'll Get
By." But as Jarreau wished it to
be, the evening centered
around several cuts from his
upcoming album, "All Fly
Home."
The title for the future album
— to be released in late July —
is found in three of the artist's
new tunes, each with one
word titles. "All" and "Fly"
shine with Jarreau's familiar
jazz and vocal ability, but
"Home" distinctly differs from
the rest of his repertoire. In
"Home" Jarreau realizes much
of his potential as an original
and important artist. If this new
number represents what is to
come, Jarreau's fans will soon
witness the maturation of a
young and growing jazz per
former.
Jarreau has mastered an in
tricate jazz style that has been
recognized in the form of this
year's Grammy Award for "Best
Jazz Vocalist." While his per
formance did lack the flow of
his award winning album,
"Look to the Rainbow," his
vocal ability grips and controls

the audience. With the added
talent of being able to imitate
any instrument, from an elec
tric guitar to a flute, Jarreau's
most obvious appeal lies in his
wide vocal range and variety.
)arreau exhibits another at
tractive performance quality in
that he commands a rare ability
to communicate with his audi
ence; he is as personable as he
is talented. After being carried
along in the warmth of his
smile and music the major
criticism must be that the 75
minute concert was much too
short.
As a composer, however,
Jarreau does not match his
vocal ability. As the night prog
resses it can become increas
ingly difficult to separate and
recall his songs; the variety
heard in his voice is lacking in
his music. Also, larreau does
seem to have transitional prob
lems between songs. The
fluent composition of his al
bums is not to be found. As a
performer, Jarreau excites the
eye and Ihe ear, but there are
still a few rough edges in need
of smoothing out. No doubt
this will occur as the singer
gains more experience as a
major jazz artist, larreau has a
way to go before he reaches his
full potential, but he has plenty
of time in which to do it.
Al Jarreau is a pleasing and
entertaining artist today. His
fans can look forward to an
even better Jarreau tomorrow.
Given time, Al Jarreau could
be, as his song says, "Better
than Anything."
