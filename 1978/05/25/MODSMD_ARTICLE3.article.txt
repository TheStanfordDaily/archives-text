"The fraternity system should be geared as a fun
thing," said the newly elected president of the Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFC) in his pre-election speech yes
terday at the Theta Delts.
Kurt Osenbaugh, a member of Zeta Psi, was elected
president over Mike Cresto of Kappa Sigma. Cresto later
won the bid for the vice presidency.
After losing the election for vice president, Ken
Breitenbach, a Delta Upsilon, ran unopposed for trea
surer and was unanimously given the position by a mo
tion on the floor.
Osenbaugh will replace this year's president, Reid
Butler. He said he does not want to see competition
developing between fraternities and sororities and ad
ded, "I'd like to keep the whole system as open as
possible.
"I'd like to see more activities involving fraternities
doing more together," he said.
Cresto, in his unexpected bid for the vice presidency,

ran against Dwight Prudhome of Alpha Delta Phi and
Breitenbach.
He said a main problem in IFC is "the lack of com
munication.
"With rush this year, and in the past, houses have had
a real self-interest, and aren't willing to help each other
out," he said.
Cresto suggested that communication could be im
proved by "possibly having IFC-backed (ASSU) Senate
Reps."
Breitenbach, the new treasurer, said he had several
ideas for IFC.
"I've been involved with the IFC pretty much all year. I
have a lot of ideas from this year that I'd like to see the
IFC follow up on — mainly Big Game Week and the Aqua
Follies."
He added that he would have to look at the books
before commenting on whether dues would have to rise
but said, "the main problem is that we won't have
surplus carrying over from this year's fund."
