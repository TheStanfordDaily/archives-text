French soldiers killed in Zaire
Kinshasa, Zaire — French paratroopers skirmished
with Katangan rebels outside Kolwezi and two French
soldiers were killed, military officials reported yester
day. France appealed to African nations, meanwhile, to
help save white hostages in the hands of rebels retreat
ing toward Angola.
The French Defense Ministry said in Paris paratroop
ers battled a rebel force Tuesday at Liulu, five miles from
Kolwezi. The two soldiers killed were the third and
fourth deaths among the6oo-man French airborne force
dropped on Kolwezi last, week to rescue trapped foreig
ners. Rebel casulaties in the clash were not reported.
A report from Kolwezi said the final toll of Europeans
massacred by rebels during their one-week occupation
of the southern Zaire city would probably not exceed
120. Previous estimates had been as high as more than
200.
Meanwhile, White House spokesman Jody Powell said
yesterday that top Carter administration officials have
discussed the possibility of U.S. aid for guerrillas fight
ing the Cuban-backed regime in Angola.
But Powell said Carter hasn't yet decided whether to
seek repeal of a congressional prohibition against any
such move.
Committee moves to end controls
Washington — The chairman of the House-Senate con
ference committee on energy told gas producers yes
terday it would be "treason against the interests of
America" if they withheld natural gas in anticipation of
deregulation in 1985.
Rep. Harley Staggers (D-W.Va.) made the comment as
the joint Senate-House panel moved toward expected
approval of a natural gas pricing compromise that would
free newly discovered gas from price controls in that
year.
The measure would also allow the price ot gas to rise
about 10 per cent each year until the ceiling comes off. It
includes a formula under which industrial consumers
would bear the brunt of the price increases — at least
initially.
Approval of the plan would end the six-month con
gressional stalemate on President Jimmy Carter's energy
program and leave energy taxes the only section of the
five-part legislation remaining to be resolved.
Carter trails Ford in Harris poll
New York — President Jimmy Carter is trailing his 1976
opponent, Gerald Ford, in Americans' preferences for
the 1980 presidential contest, according to a national
poll released yesterday.
The poll, conducted by Louis Harris and Associates for
ABC News, also found former California Gov. Ronald
Reagan roughly even with Carter in the "trial heat" for
the 1980 presidential race.
Former President Ford was ahead of Carter in the poll
results by a 48 per cent to 43 per cent margin. The
remaining 9 per cent of the persons polled did not ex
press an opinion.
ABC News said the percentages are based on tele
phone interviews last week with those who said they had
voted in the 1976 race and with a small group of persons
who were too young to vote that year but who now are
over 18.
U.S. offers aid in disarmament
United Nations — The United States has offered to
serve as the "eyes and ears of peace' to help make
disarmament work for a world spending almost a million
a minute for weapons.
The American proposal — to help set up monitoring
systems like one in the Sinai Desert between Egyptian
and Israeli forces — was unveiled yesterday by Vice
President Walter Mondale to a special U.N. disarma
ment conference.

Nearly 130 officials, including 20 heads of state and 53
cabinet ministers, are scheduled to speak at the confer
ence. The five-week session was called so the 149 U.N.
member countries could search for ways to halt the
nuclear weapons race and divert the nearly $400 billion
spent on arms each year to peaceful purposes.
While pledging the Carter administration's commit
ment to reduce arms sales and curb nuclear weapons,
Mondale said the United States cannot reverse the arms
race by itself.
Soviets conduct interceptor test
Washington — The Russians have conducted a new
test of their satellite-destroying system less than three
weeks before the st?.rt of U.S.-Soviet negotiations on
curbing such space war weapons.
"The Soviets launched a probable anti-satellite inter
ceptor on May 19 against a Soviet satellite," the Penta
gon said yesterday when asked about reports of such a
test. The statement gave no details.
Defense officials said they were surprised the Rus
sians chose to conduct an anti-satellite system test ahead
of the June 8 opening of negotiations in Helsinki.
Experts were divided on whether the test, the first in
five months, was a success.
Intelligence sources said the hunter satellite got
"pretty close" to the target satellite but did not explode.
Princess Margaret divorced
London — A two-minute proceeding in a musty Lon
don courtroom yesterday dissolved the marriage of Prin
cess Margaret and Lord Snowdon, celebrated in the
pomp and circumstance of a Westminister Abbey wed
ding 18 years ago.
The royal divorce came 20th in a list of 27 and put
royalty in company of a barmaid, an office cleaner and a
former guardsman.
Neither the 47-year-old princess, nor her photo
grapher husband, the former Antony Armstrong-Jones,
48, was required to appear in court for the proceedings
— a mere formality under British divorce laws updated
seven years ago.
Advertising restriction ruled illegal
Washington — The Federal Tude Commission, told
that prices of similar eyeglasses sometimes vary by 350
per cent, ruled yesterday it is illegal for states and pro
fessional groups to restrict advertising of prices for eye
examinations and glasses.
State laws or professional associations restrict such
advertising in about 40 states.
It was the first time the FTC, relying on a 1975 law, had
made such a sweeping, industry-wide ruling rather than
regulating companies on a case-by-case basis. More
than a dozen FTC decisions on what is legal throughout
an industry — decisions that could run counter to state
laws — are pending in such business areas as funerals,
hearing aids, mobile homes, vocational schools and
used cars.
The American Optometric Association said that the
FTC "is overstepping its power as a federal regulatory
agency" and that the association would appeal the deci
sion through the federal courts.

Advertising restriction ruled illegal
Washington — The Federal Tude Commission, told
that prices of similar eyeglasses sometimes vary by 350
per cent, ruled yesterday it is illegal for states and pro
fessional groups to restrict advertising of prices for eye
examinations and glasses.
State laws or professional associations restrict such
advertising in about 40 states.
It was the first time the FTC, relying on a 1975 law, had
made such a sweeping, industry-wide ruling rather than
regulating companies on a case-by-case basis. More
than a dozen FTC decisions on what is legal throughout
an industry — decisions that could run counter to state
laws — are pending in such business areas as funerals,
hearing aids, mobile homes, vocational schools and
used cars.
The American Optometric Association said that the
FTC "is overstepping its power as a federal regulatory
agency" and that the association would appeal the deci
sion through the federal courts.

New York — The stock market took a pounding for the
second straight session yesterday amid renewed infla

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off about 12
points at mid-afternoon, closed with a 7.37 loss at 837.92.
The average had fallen 10.13 points Tuesday.
Today's Weather

French soldiers killed in Zaire
Kinshasa, Zaire — French paratroopers skirmished
with Katangan rebels outside Kolwezi and two French
soldiers were killed, military officials reported yester
day. France appealed to African nations, meanwhile, to
help save white hostages in the hands of rebels retreat
ing toward Angola.
The French Defense Ministry said in Paris paratroop
ers battled a rebel force Tuesday at Liulu, five miles from
Kolwezi. The two soldiers killed were the third and
fourth deaths among the6oo-man French airborne force
dropped on Kolwezi last, week to rescue trapped foreig
ners. Rebel casulaties in the clash were not reported.
A report from Kolwezi said the final toll of Europeans
massacred by rebels during their one-week occupation
of the southern Zaire city would probably not exceed
120. Previous estimates had been as high as more than
200.
Meanwhile, White House spokesman Jody Powell said
yesterday that top Carter administration officials have
discussed the possibility of U.S. aid for guerrillas fight
ing the Cuban-backed regime in Angola.
But Powell said Carter hasn't yet decided whether to
seek repeal of a congressional prohibition against any
such move.
Committee moves to end controls
Washington — The chairman of the House-Senate con
ference committee on energy told gas producers yes
terday it would be "treason against the interests of
America" if they withheld natural gas in anticipation of
deregulation in 1985.
Rep. Harley Staggers (D-W.Va.) made the comment as
the joint Senate-House panel moved toward expected
approval of a natural gas pricing compromise that would
free newly discovered gas from price controls in that
year.
The measure would also allow the price ot gas to rise
about 10 per cent each year until the ceiling comes off. It
includes a formula under which industrial consumers
would bear the brunt of the price increases — at least
initially.
Approval of the plan would end the six-month con
gressional stalemate on President Jimmy Carter's energy
program and leave energy taxes the only section of the
five-part legislation remaining to be resolved.
Carter trails Ford in Harris poll
New York — President Jimmy Carter is trailing his 1976
opponent, Gerald Ford, in Americans' preferences for
the 1980 presidential contest, according to a national
poll released yesterday.
The poll, conducted by Louis Harris and Associates for
ABC News, also found former California Gov. Ronald
Reagan roughly even with Carter in the "trial heat" for
the 1980 presidential race.
Former President Ford was ahead of Carter in the poll
results by a 48 per cent to 43 per cent margin. The
remaining 9 per cent of the persons polled did not ex
press an opinion.
ABC News said the percentages are based on tele
phone interviews last week with those who said they had
voted in the 1976 race and with a small group of persons
who were too young to vote that year but who now are
over 18.
U.S. offers aid in disarmament
United Nations — The United States has offered to
serve as the "eyes and ears of peace' to help make
disarmament work for a world spending almost a million
a minute for weapons.
The American proposal — to help set up monitoring
systems like one in the Sinai Desert between Egyptian
and Israeli forces — was unveiled yesterday by Vice
President Walter Mondale to a special U.N. disarma
ment conference.

Nearly 130 officials, including 20 heads of state and 53
cabinet ministers, are scheduled to speak at the confer
ence. The five-week session was called so the 149 U.N.
member countries could search for ways to halt the
nuclear weapons race and divert the nearly $400 billion
spent on arms each year to peaceful purposes.
While pledging the Carter administration's commit
ment to reduce arms sales and curb nuclear weapons,
Mondale said the United States cannot reverse the arms
race by itself.
Soviets conduct interceptor test
Washington — The Russians have conducted a new
test of their satellite-destroying system less than three
weeks before the st?.rt of U.S.-Soviet negotiations on
curbing such space war weapons.
"The Soviets launched a probable anti-satellite inter
ceptor on May 19 against a Soviet satellite," the Penta
gon said yesterday when asked about reports of such a
test. The statement gave no details.
Defense officials said they were surprised the Rus
sians chose to conduct an anti-satellite system test ahead
of the June 8 opening of negotiations in Helsinki.
Experts were divided on whether the test, the first in
five months, was a success.
Intelligence sources said the hunter satellite got
"pretty close" to the target satellite but did not explode.
Princess Margaret divorced
London — A two-minute proceeding in a musty Lon
don courtroom yesterday dissolved the marriage of Prin
cess Margaret and Lord Snowdon, celebrated in the
pomp and circumstance of a Westminister Abbey wed
ding 18 years ago.
The royal divorce came 20th in a list of 27 and put
royalty in company of a barmaid, an office cleaner and a
former guardsman.
Neither the 47-year-old princess, nor her photo
grapher husband, the former Antony Armstrong-Jones,
48, was required to appear in court for the proceedings
— a mere formality under British divorce laws updated
seven years ago.
