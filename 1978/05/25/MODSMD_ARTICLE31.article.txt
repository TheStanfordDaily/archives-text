# Black Activities Center proposal
## Space, staff, funds sought 
### Ellie Lanza 
Students plan to submit a for
mal proposal this morning to Di
rector of Student Activities
Thomas Massey, asking for more
space, staff and funding for the
Black Activities Center (BAC), ac
cording to Keith Archuleta, ad
ministrative intern to the BAC.
The proposal, written by the
BAC Advisory Committee, re
quests a full-time director, secret
ary, at least two student workers,
adequate space to house its prog
rams and clarification of the rela
tionship between the Office of
Student Affairs (OSA) and the
BAC.
In return, the organization will
agree to the University wish for
the BAC to move from the Nitery
to the Black House so the prop
osed Chicano Activity Center can
be set up in the Nitery.
The Black House, where several
student-run black organizations
are now located, provides insuffi
cient office space for the BAC.
"I think we're asking for a little
compared to what problems we
have," Archuleta said.
The BAC, originally the Black
Student Volunteer Center, arose
in 1970 out of a need for black

students to maintain contact with
the community.
The proposal states the BAC's
primary focus now is on coor
dinating black activities on cam
pus. Programs aimed toward the
community have become secon
dary.
The proposal adds, "At present
the needs of the black community
regarding the BAC are far reach
ing and require leadership, reor
ganization, continuity and a
reevaluation of funding."
Because of a University-wide
budget cutback in 1975 which re
sulted in the reorganization of
campus activities, the BAC budget
was cut and funds were reallo
cated to OSA.
BAC's proposal cites this sub
stantial budget cutback from the
1975-76 amount of $51,000 to this
year's budget of $14,625.
The large reduction in funds
has, according to the proposal,
resulted in the loss of "vehicles,
part of a secretarial position,
some subsistence funding, the
summer reading program and the
BAC director."
Due to the budget cut the BAC
suffered a loss in administrative
personnel.

Massey said the University saw
less of a need for BAC administra
tion because fewer students were
participating in BAC-sponsored
tutorial programs and because a
three-year federally-funded
"Right to Read" program ended.
The position of full-time direc
tor, held by Massey from 1970 to
1975, was eliminated by the ad
ministration cuts and Massey's
current position as director of
student activities was formed.
In 1975 the money from the
BAC's budget that had been used
to pay student staff was instead
used to pay a temporary full-time
coordinator of the center.
Last spring this temporary posi
tion was eliminated and OSA is
now responsible for giving the
BAC staff support.
Archuleta feels that the BAC is
not getting the adequate supervi
sion promised them by Dan Wil
liams, associate dean for campus
activities.
Williams' response to the ques
tion of whether the BAC needs a
full-time director was, "There are
very few student organizations
here that wouldn't benefit from
more staff attention."
