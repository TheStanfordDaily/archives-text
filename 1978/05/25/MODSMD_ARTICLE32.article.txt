Gould death
Dr. R. Cordon Could, 68, profes
sor emeritus of endocrinology and
metabolism at the School of
Medicine, died Friday of cancer.
Funeral services are private, and a
date for memorial services has not
yet been set.
Could was an expert on the
metabolism of blood fats and pro
teins. His major research interests
included the regulation of choles
terol synthesis and the role of choles
terol in the development of
atherosclerosis, a disease affecting
the arteries.
He found that cholesterol ingested
in the diet regulates production and
metabolism of the substance by the
body. This discovery has widely in
fluenced the development of treat
ments to prevent atherosclerosis and
related disorders.
