Would KZSU still be "the Zoo"
it non-students didn't work for
the radio station?
What role non-students should
play at the University's radio sta
tion has been a controversial issue
at KZSU tor the last several years,
and itdoesn'tlooklikethisissueis
going to be decided soon.
Non-students constitute "no
more than 10 per cent" of KZSU's
staff, according to Jon Morris, sta
tion manager. While some staff
members feel non-students are
necessary to fill summer and vaca
tion break positions and to pro
vide technical expertise to stu
dents, others believe non
students shouldn't be around
KZSU.
Tom "Tuna" Price, chief an
nouncer and next year's station
manager, is an advocate of non
student involvement.
"It's difficult to fill KZSU's en
tire schedulewith studentsduring
summer and vacation breaks," he
said.
Remain operating
Non-student Steve Ethridge,
musical director, added that "it is
very important the station remain
operating 24 hours during the
summer, especially now that
we've gone to 500 watts. We have
a responsibility to both Stanford

and to the outlying community."
But not all the staff agrees. One
staff member who has been with
KZSU for the last three years, says
he would "rather see KZSU
operating 16 hours a day with just
students than 24 hours with non
student involvement."
Price also advocates non
student involvement because "if
utilized correctly they (non
students) can provide technical
expertise. They are extremely be
neficial to KZSU."
Bill Sposato, news director, said
he agrees that non-students bring
expertise but added this holds an
inherent problem.
Most expertise
"The best DJs get the best
shows," he explained, "and the
non-students are the ones with
the most expertise. They've been
here six or seven years, so they get
the good shows. It all fits in
nicely."
"It's not true that they (non
students) get the best shows,"
Price argued. "KZSU's policy is to
have qualified students given pre
ference. Out of 14 shows during
the prime time hours, three are
done by non-students."
One of the least desired shows
for DJs is the Monday night 6 to 10
p.m. slot when the Palo Alto City
Council meetings are broadcast.
The DJ has only one hour of his

own show.
Andy Barkin did the Monday
night slot this quarter. He said he
had been with KZSU for five quar
ters and that during his second
quarter, he did the Saturday night
6 to 10 p.m. slot, a prime time.
First choice
"I wrote down the Monday
night slot as myfirstchoiceforthis
quarter, not knowing it was
mostly City Council," Barkin said.
"I think it's the chief announcer's
fault not to call and remind me
about it."
Price commented on this by say
ing, "I have to rely on what the DJs
tell me they want. I can't play
camp counselor to 42 D)s and ask
them, 'Now are you sure you
wanted this time slot?' "
Price added, "Maybe I should
have checked," but said another
staff member had told him Barkin
wanted that position because he
planned to devote more time to
training new staff members.
Another KZSU staff member
said Barkin and Price had person
ality conflicts and Price "didn't
like the kind of music Barkin
played."
Personal feelings seem to have
become involved in other in
stances of show scheduling. For
example, according to a staff
member, one student with a
'fairly good time slot" has only

been with KZSU one quarter, but
is on "close relations" with a
KZSU executive staff person.
What about those persons who
don't have a steady time slot but
are instead on a substitution list?
"We have a substitution list for
the 42 programs," Price
explained, adding that the sub
stitution procedures are "a little
strange.
"We try and rotate the list," he
explained. "But a lot of who gets
what times depends on the av
ailability of students or non
students. The person who is un
employed or who is only on half
tuition is likely to get much more
airtime than the person who is tak
ing 20 unit?. Some people just
aren't available."
Sposato agrees that non
students can afford to spend more
time at KZSU.
'Their life'
"They're down here all the
time," he said. "KZSU is their life.
In the past, they've come down,
talked, smoked dope, harassed
other people."
Several of the staff members
said KZSU had a fairly severe drug
problem a few years ago, "but it's
all been cleaned up," Morris said.
None of the staff members con
tacted by the Daily said KZSU now
has a drug problem.
But this wasn't the case about

three years ago. "The problem
was with both students and non
students," a staff member said.
"Non-students brought the drugs
to the station, but both non
students and students were using
them.".
Sposato claims that "non
students are just interested in
their own careers."
Ethridge, 27, has been involved

with KZSU for the last three years.
He agrees that working on a Uni
versity radio station allows him to
"develop myself before I go to a
professional station."
But Ethridge said in return, the
non-student can give the radio
station "a sense of profes
sionalism."

The FCC license for KZSU is in
the name of the Board of Trustees.
KZSU is therefore not indepen
dent of the University, and several
persons feel it is up to the ad
ministrators to try to curtail non
student involvement at the sta
tion.
Thomas Massey, director of
student activities, said the Univer
sity's position is that students
should be given as many jobs as
possible and that non-students
should be used only when abso
lutely necessary.
Massey added he wants faculty
members or other University af
filiates to work there, not non
students.
"Faculty can help," Morris said.

"But I have not been informed of
their interest. I would like to see
faculty involvement because
KZSU is a Stanford University sta
tion."
But he added faculty could
probably help most in the curricu
lar area.
Ethridge agreed that it is impor
tant for the University to establish
a program in telecommunica
tions, especially in radio.
"I've heard the communica
tions taught here is nothing more
than glorified journalism," Et
hridge said. "People should adopt
a radio major at Stanford and
shouldn't be so ready to can non
students until they've seen some
of the good radio programs at
other schools."
