# Prop. 13: first step to moral solution
##

Taxation is theft.
Taxation is nothing but coerced
tribute which, having acquired a
patina of age and tradition, is widely
accepted as legitimate or inevitable.
It is the means by which the ruling
class of a community (in an ideal
democracy the majority) compels
other people to support projects
they would not choose to support if
permitted a free choice.
Taxation is the ultimate means by
which a uniform set of values is im
posed on a people: laws against vic
timless crimes may prohibit certain
actions which conflict with accepted
moral values, but taxation requires

one to actively support those values
chosen by the taxing authority.
Government is the unique social
institution which compels payment
whether or not one desires its ser
vices or supports its goals. If one pre
fers not to contribute to the revenues
of General Motors, one can buy a
Volkswagen, get a bicycle, hitchhike,
or walk.
If one is unimpressed by the re
cord of the Heart Association, or a
private university, or the Catholic
Church, one may freely refuse to
contribute to those causes.
But if one does not desire the
specific services of government or is

unimpressed with its record of serv
ing the public welfare, one must still
pay one's taxes or go to jail.
This situation is so familiar it rarely
elicits indignation: familiarity has
bred acceptance. Vet, there is no es
sential distinction between those
functions supported through taxes
and those performed by non
governmental institutions. Taxation
is supported by no moral justification
but only by moral indifference.
Human rights advocates in
America are justly incensed at many
violations of human rights in this
country â€” restriction on freedom of
expression, laws against victimless
crimes, involuntary mental hospitali

zation, etc.
Yet, involuntary taxation (which,
from all levels of government, ex
torts approximately 40 per cent of the
production of the American people)
is far larger in magnitude and affects
many more people than all other
human rights violations in this nation
combined.
It is in this light that the Jarvis-
Cann tax limitation initiative, prop
osition 13 on the )une ballot, should
be judged.
Jarvis-Cann is far too timid and
conservative. Jarvis does not ques
tion the essential legitimacy of coer
cive taxation; he merely feels that
current taxes are a bit too high.
Jarvis does not lake issue with the
doctrine that "essential services"
should be financed by involuntary
taxation; he simply believes that they
can be adequately maintained at a
slightly lower level of funding.
The conservatives only want to re
form the tax system; the point is
rather to abolish it. The conserva
tives see tax relief as an economic
issue; it is in fact a moral issue.
Proposition 13 deserves our vote
as the only serious anti-tax proposal
on the )une 6 ballot. But it must be
viewed not as a solution to the prob
lem of taxation but only as a first step
to a moral solution. The ultimate goal
must be the complete abolition of
compulsory taxation and the estab
lishment of a free and non-coercive
society.
