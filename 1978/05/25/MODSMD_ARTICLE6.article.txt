Love-starved freshmen
Well you guys (and dolls) asked for
it, an editorial that has nothing to do
with "you know where." I really ap
preciate it when the ASSU brings first
class movies like "The Sound of
Music" to campus for us to see (and
hear).
I saw it this last Sunday and loved
it. However, bringing a romantic
movie like "The Sound of Music" to
campus is a cruel card to deal many
of the freshman males. Let me exp
lain.
Along with stirring pleasurable
emotions, "The Sound of Music"
fans coals that lie deep and dormant
within many freshman hearts. It's no
joke, but rather a shame, many
freshman males are lonely, and see
ing a romantic movie bursting with
love and passion, only makes our
situation seem worse.
Then there are scenes that tease
us; such as when the voluptuous 16-
year-old daughter "puts the move
on" the telegraph boy. And he
doesn't know what is going on.
Hell, if that opportunity knocked
at any freshman's door he would
gladly answer. And how many 16-
year-olds have you seen that could
top her? Certainly none of the Paly
High broads one sees around here.
If any of you Stanford women are
still with me (still reading this), this is
not a cut on you or your weekend
study habits. (I don't hold the
Chaparral's view of Stanford women
to be my own!)
Many of the freshman males are
homogeneous for nerd genes, and
we study when we should be chasing
you; or better, when being chased
by a liberated person.
This celibate life we lead, not by
choice, is made unbearable when we

see moonlit scenes of hugging, kis
sing, romantic gazing, plus all that
other slop and goo. Then seeing that
movie with a dorm group just doesn't
cut it.
In summary, why is the ASSU
being so cruel to us love-starved
freshman males? It's paradoxical, I
loved the movie but those coals in
my heart are now burning and hurt
ing.
Anyone (females only) who would
like to defend the other point of view
is welcome to tell me why a romantic
movie is good for lonely, hard work
ing, freshman males.

Apathy ain't easy
What's it like to be apathetic? Let
me try to explain. Some people
worry about what dress or pair of
shoes they are going to wear to this
Friday night's semi-formal party, and
don't even know where South Africa,
and the world, are.
Other people worry about South
Africa and the military-corporate es
tablishment and don't even know
where their dorm, and the ground
are.
The first group of people doesn't
even know what there is to be
apathetic about, the second group
knows that all other people are
apathetic.
Then there are the rest of us. Some
are apathetic and don't realize it;
some of us realize that we're the si
lent, knowing, lazy, apathetic major
ity.
Oh, but we're not all so bad. Iwrite
my Congressman, occasionally pray
to the unifying Force of the universe,
recycle cans, and am probably going
to work for Carter's reelection cam

paign.
I'm organizing a rally for noon in
White Plaza to protest the noisy
noons in White Plaza during the last
few weeks. I also think a lot, but I
don't tell everyone about it. I think
the ASSU Senate is a joke and should
be abolished.
I think the Baccalaureate service
doesn't meet the spiritual needs of
many seniors. I think good teaching
should be much more valued and
much better rewarded here than it
has been. I think that if Bakke wins,
I'll be very sad for a very long time. I
think a lot of things.
And I'm going to continue think
ing; but I'm tired of "issues" —
Blacks need this, lews need that,
South Africans bla bla, professors do
this (why doesn't anyone care what
God does any more?), freshmen
don't know la de dah.
What ever happened to people, to
simple humanity (or do I mean
"humwomanity")? Things have got
ten out of focus — lives have become
issues.
Well, I don't work for issues; if it
means I'm "apathetic," then I'm
proud of it! And apathy isn't easy; it's
hard getting things done in a world
where one is surrounded by ig
noramuses and belligerents.
I'm still going to recycle cans, give
money to the ACLU (American Civil
Liberties Union), and write my Con
gressman. Vou won't see me doing
those things though. I have my life
and other lives to worry about.
