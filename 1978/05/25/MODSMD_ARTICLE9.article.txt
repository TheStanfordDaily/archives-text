# Pledge program clarified
## 
### 
Ceremsak, Drake

Recently, a great deal of attention
has been paid to the University's in
terest in corporations involved in
South Africa. Student opposition has
taken many forms, but the one of
most concern to us, as members of
the Senior Pledge Committee, is the
recent mailing to seniors asking
them to boycott the Senior Pledge
Program.
As members of the Committee, we
would like to clarify the goals of the
program so that students can make a
responsible, informed decision
about contributing to Stanford.
In their mailing, five seniors, spon
sored by the United Campus Christ
ian Ministry, asked their classmates
to "boycott all University fund rais
ing drives, particularly the Senior
Pledge Program," until the Univer
sity adopts a "responsible" invest
ment policy.
To this end they encourage us to
express our dissatisfaction to the Of
fice of Development on a note en
closed in their mailing.
The Senior Pledge Program was
formed by nine seniors with the
hope that other members of their
class would make a commitment to
help support the University. Our
motivation was to make seniors
aware of the fact that over 50 per cent
of Stanford's budget comes from
contributions and endowments, and
continuing support is necessary to
maintain Stanford's position as an
outstanding educational facility.
When we first met, one of our
major concerns was to include in the
program those people who would be

uncomfortable making a general
contribution to the University in light
of its "controversial" investment pol
icy. We felt that all students had be
nefited from one or more aspects of
Stanford's environment, be it finan
cial aids, overseas studies, club
sports, or one of many special in
terest programs on campus sup
ported by the University. Therefore
the program was set up so that those
pledging could designate their gift to
a specific department, program or in
terest at Stanford.
The pledges are designed to be
small, affordable gifts, recognizing
that in the first few years following
graduation many seniors are paying
off loans, attending graduate school,
or are uncertain of a job. Seniors on
campus have been contacted by a
representative in their living grop.
Those off-campus will receive a mail
ing in their living group. Those off
campus will receive a mailing with
details of the program.
We hope the seniors will have a
chance to consider those aspects of
Stanford life which have been espe
cially meaningful to them. Under
standably no student can be in full
agreement with all of Stanford's
policies. It is our hope that students
will recognize Stanford's continuing
need for support by contributions,
and will give to the area which has
been of particular value to them dur
ing their Stanford career.
