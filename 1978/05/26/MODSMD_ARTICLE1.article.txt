# Netters defeat UCLA 6-3; capture NCAA top ranking

### Jeff Brandon 
In front of the largest out
door crowd ever to watch a col
lege tennis match, John McEn
roe and Matt Mitchell led Stan
ford's No. 1 ranked tennis team
to a 6-3 victory over UCLA jus
tifying its top ranking yesterday
in the finals of the NCAA team
championships.
The match was held in
Athens, Ga.
The win gave the Cards a 24-0
record for the season and their
second straight national
championship — the fourth in
the last six years. It was Coach
Dick Gould's first undefeated
season as coach and the first
golden season since the Cards
went undefeated in 1942.
The story of the tournament
for Stanford was its dominance
in singles play. The Cards won
20 of 24 singles matches. In

fact, the outcome of every
match except the finals was de
cided before the doubles were
even played. McEnroe and
Mitchell combined for a 12-0
record in tournament singles
and doubles. The steady play
of these two superstars, plus
the heroics of Peter Rennert
and Lloyd Bourne gave the
Cards a national champion
ship, despite the loss of a key
player, Ail-American Perry
Wright.
McEnroe, the top ranked
amateur in the world, played
his usual brilliant game. The
tousle-haired freshman, who
plans to turn pro at the end of
the individual tournament,
turned back Elliot Teltscher
6-4, 7-5. McEnroe, recognized
world wide after reaching the
semifinals at Wimbledon last
year, broke Teltscher's serve at

a crucial three-all point at 5-6 in
the second set to win the
match. Besides battling
Teltscher, McEnroe had to con
tend with a hostile crowd that
taunted him throughout the
match. In a rematch of last
year's singles finals, defending
champion Mitchell held off
Tony Graham 7-5, 4-6, 6-i in
three tough sets. In the final set
Mitchell fought off numerous
break points to win the match.
Bourne continued on his
tournament tear. Bourne, 15-2
on the season, won his fourth
straight match of the tourna
ment without the loss of a set.
The rangy 6-foot-3 sophomore
from Pasadena, not even in the
starting lineup until two weeks
ago, downed All-American )on
Paley 6-4, 7-6.
But probably the biggest win
