# Child genius wants medical career

Los Angeles (AP) — Like many
college freshmen, Mariel Ara
gon hasn't decided exactly
what she wants to specialize in,
but she has plenty of time. "I'm
just getting my 8.A., M.D., and
Ph.D.," says Aragon, who is
just 12 years old.
She was admitted to the Uni
versity of Southern California
conditionally last fall at age 11
when she enrolled in two
courses. After she successfully
completed them, USC permit
ted her to take a full load as a
pre-law, pre-med student.
"I'm tickled pink to be
here," she said, adding that
she's not bothered by being
younger than her classmates.
"In fact, I enjoy it. You see, I'm
an only child. And everybody
here treats me like a younger
sister — so, it's like having a lot
of brothers and sisters."
She plans to take physics,
biology, psychology and
French next semester. She'll
finish undergraduate studies
by age 15 and will complete
medical school when she's 22.
Burt Wuttken, a university
spokesman, said Mariel's IQ
has been measured at about
180.
She says she doesn't mind

being called a genius, but "I
really like to be treated like a
normal person. I'm one of you.
I'm not from outer space."
In her spare time, she plays
the piano, sings and reads
about 5000 words per minute, a
technique she learned while
visiting her grandmother in the
Philippines, where she met a
speed reading expert who
comprehends 20,000 words
per minute.
She has acted professionally,
appearing in two episodes of

television's "The Bionic Wo
man," and about 10 commer
cials, including one for Kellogg
cereals and another for a
"Welcome Back, Kotter" game
based on the television series
of the same name.
Born in Puerto Rico, she at
tended nursery school, kin
dergarten, and elementary
school in Las Vegas, Nev.,
skipping grades 4, 6 and 8. Last
summer, she attended a spe
cial program for gifted stu
dents at Johns Hopkins Uni

versity, where she hopes to re
turn for her medical studies.
She hasn't chosen a medical
specialty, delaying that deci
sion until she is more familiar
with medicine.
She lives in Los Angeles with
her mother, dancer Mila Ara
gon, who is divorced from
Mariel's father, Morris Yick, a
mortuary owner. Mariel took
her mother's last name as her
stage name and prefers to be
known as Mariel Aragon.
