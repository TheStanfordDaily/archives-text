# Term paper services under fire
## 
### 
Washington â€” The federal
government wants to kill the
mail-order term paper busi
ness that lets college students
meet course requirements
with their pocketbooks instead
of their brains.
Ghost-written term papers
have been around for years
and many fraternity houses for
decades have had file cabinets
of old term papers.
But what is causing the gov
ernment concern is the trend
toward nationwide corporate

operations selling research
papers for profit. Postal au
thorities say at least six com
panies now are peddling term
papers nationally through ads
in campus newspapers and
elsewhere.
The companies have re
search staffs compiling papers
on hundreds of subjects and
offer catalogs of papers availa
ble at about $3 per page. For a
higher fee, the companies will
write an original paper on a
subject chosen by the student.

In what a government attor
ney said is a test case, postal
authorities announced last
Thursday they have filed a
complaint against the
Academic Research Group,
Inc., of Rutherford, N.J.
The complaint charges the
company sells research reports
that students then turn in for
academic credit. The Postal
Service position holds that sel
ling canned term papers
through the mail violates laws
prohibiting using the mail for
misrepresentation.
Academic Research, con
tacted last Thursday, declined
to comment on the case.
