When do they turn Tanner fountain on?
-T.M.
Roger Buckout, head planner of the fountain,
said an automatic timer is scheduled to run it 7
a.m.-11 p.m. seven days a week.
He added the electrical work on the controls
for the fountain is still continuing. It has mista
kenly been turned off a few times, he said.
Once construction is completed, an effort to
shed power usage would be the only reason for
it to be turned off during the designated hours,
he said.

Why was the eucalyptus grove between
Lagunita and the driving range decimated lately?
Herb Fong, grounds supervisor, said the trees
were removed because they were dead. He said
they died from the inavailability of water as a
result of last year's drought.
A lot of people walk and drive through that
area. As this type of tree is "unpredictable when

dead," he said the decimation was basically a
safety precaution.
New euclayptus trees will be planted there, he
added.

When walking on the asphalt path from the
new Terman Engineering Building across the
street to Roble Gym, one crosses the new grass
strip beside the road. Last month, a section of
the grass strip was dug out, seemingly to be
replaced with asphalt and thus make a continu
ous path. But no, the hole was filled with mud.
Now a detour around the mud is required on the
exit path from the Terman Building to the Roble
Gym.
What is happening? Will asphalt be put on this
gap in the path?
-L.T.
"It is to be filled in with lawn," said Carroll
Rankin of planning and management.
Grounds Supervisor Herb Fong, said the ini
tial plan was to use it as a delivery path. But when
the access to the building was changed, he ad
ded, the path was no longer needed.
Rankin said the path would not have been
convenient as a delivery point. The path also
would have been a dangerous point from which
to cross the street, he said.
