Can virginity be cured?
Is veneral disease a state of
mind?
Should Gov. Jerry Brown go
back to the priesthood?
Competitors in the Rhetori
cal Society Festival spoke on
these and other subjects last
Saturday in the Law School.
About 30 students partici
pated.
The festival gave students an
opportunity to persuade,
dramatize, interpret or impro
vise, according to Scott Rich
ter, director of the Rhetorical
Society.
The festival included the
three competitive divisions of
persuasive speaking, dramatic
interpretation and impromptu.
For the first two sections, com
petitors recited 10 minute pre
pared speeches.
The competition was "so in
timate you didn't feel the com
petition," said Jennifer Hirsch,
who, along with Jorge Garcia,
won first place for the persua
sive speaking category.
"It was nice to have very
competent judges," she ad
ded.
Competitors in the im
promptu section had three mi

nutes to prepare a three
minute speech on a topic they
selected randomly from a hat.
Faryl Reingold and Marc
Shargel tied for first place after
the first round of what Richter
called the "most exciting part"
of the festival.
Reingold and Shargel chose
new topics after the tie.
Shargel's second topic was a
response to Will Rogers'
statement, "I don't make
jokes, I watch the government
and report what I see."
But Richter said Shargal
could not beat Reingold's "bril
liant" parody on "Should Mil
ton Friedman become a Resi
dent Fellow at Columbae
house."
Tamis Hoover won first place
in dramatic interpretation.
Speakers recited a dramatic
monologue. A poem ora prose
piece, with judges looking for
good voice interpretation.
The Rhetorical Society has
been very active all year in
supplying guest speakers to
civic organizations in the mid-
Peninsula area, Richter said.
Fie added, most members
who speak at functions take
Richter's undergraduate spe
cial class on advanced speech,

theory and practice.
Students prepare speeches
on topics ranging from compu
ter crime to the Jarvis-Gann
controversy. Society members
have been giving about two
speeches a week to clubs such
as Kiwanis, Rotary and Lions,
Richter added.
Richter said he hopes to
schedule more activities on
campus next year and to in
clude more student participa
tion.
"We hope to draw in inex
perienced people, expand un
dergrad specials, have more
festivals and make use of video

tape equipment in classes," he
said.
"We want to do more soap
box speeches by the wharf in
San Francisco and in White
Plaza," he added.
Richter said his ultimate goal
is to reinstate a speech de
partment here, but said this
may be "idealistic and imprac
tical."
He said he hopes administra
tion will see the increased stu
dent demand for speech clas
ses when the Rhetorical Soci
ety becomes more active and
more campus oriented next
fall.
