# Zaire massacres worry white S. Africans

Johannesburg, South Africa (AP) — The
massacre of whites in Zaire has churned
up old fears in white-ruled southern Af
rica, the century-old dread that racial
war will finally rid the continent of
European domination.
"The Shaba invasion in Zaire is proof
positive that little sand is left in the
hourglass in this part of the world,"
South Africa's white leader Marthinus
Steyn told a farm group there.
"The tiger of violence is loose in Af
rica."
Dire warnings like Steyn's and the
headlines in the region's newspapers
this past week — "Zaire Horror Orgy
Revealed," "Hundreds Face Mas
sacre," "Drunk Boys On Rampage" —
have sent shudders of apprehension
through many of South Africa's 4.4 mill
ion whites.
For some here it strengthened their
resolve against easing white control
over the 18 million blacks in South Af
rica and against turning South-West Af
rica, also called Namibia, over to
guerrilla-backed black militants. In

Rhodesia, the Zaire bloodbath may
bolster the conviction of many whites
that Prime Minister lan Smith's "inter
nal" settlement, with safeguards for
whites, is the correct path to black
majority rule.
All races
"It will strengthen the determination
of Rhodesians of all races to see that the
forces of law and order are maintained
in a state of disciplined efficiency," said
the pro-government Rhodesia Herald
newspaper. "Without that presence,
any government, new or old, will be
easy prey for the enemy."
"No Kolwezis Here," the pro
government Johannesburg Citizen
headlined an editorial in which it said,
"The Zaire drama should be a warning
to the ProgFeds, the opposition Prog
ressive Federal Party and other liberals
in this country. The continent, in fact, is
still possessed of an inherent savag
ery."
Commenting on the siege mentality,
the liberal Rand Daily Mail of Johan
nesburg said white fears growing out of

the Zaire violence are the "wrong kind
of emotion to exploit."
"One should be cautious in one's
reaction to such events not to leap to
unjustified conclusions and generaliza
tions, particularly in a country like
South Africa, where public emotions
can so easily tip over to destructive
racialism."
Whites slain
An estimated 100 or more white resi
dents were slain by rebel invaders who
occupied Kolwezi, in Zaire's Shaba Pro
vince, last week. The French, who sent
a paratroop force in tr> rescue trapped
foreigners, said about 150 Zaireans,
both soldiers and civilians, also were
killed, along with some 200 rebels.
South Africa and Rhodesia, mean
time, are preparing for wider war south
of the Zambezi, the river that divides
black-ruled Central Africa and the
white-dominated south, and they fear
new Cuban involvement.
After a recent Rhodesian raid on a
suspected guerrilla camp in Zambia
near the Zambezi, the biracial Rhode

siari government indicated it will step
up cross-border pre-emptive attacks
against guerrillas.
The South Africans, too, seem to be
following this "forward strategy," send
ing their forces across the Angola bor
der from South-West Africa on May 4 to
strike at Namibian guerrilla camps 150
miles inside Angola.
South Africa rules South-West Africa
under an old League of Nations man
date rejected by the United Nations. It
plans to grant independence to the ter
ritory but wants to keep the guerrillas
out of power.
Cuba already has an estimated 40,000
soldiers in a dozen African nations. The
State Department says Cuban advisers
trained the rebels who invaded Zaire
May 12 and 13 from Angola.
Western intelligence sources say
there already are signs that Cubans are
training black guerrillas in Zambia, An
gola and Mozambique and the Soviet
Union is increasing the amount and
sophistication of weapons given to
southern African guerrilla movements.
