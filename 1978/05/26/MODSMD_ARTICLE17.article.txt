# Army drug abuse seen as 'serious'
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” Some
209,000 enlisted personnel in
the Army use marijuana and
about 49,000 use hard drugs
such as heroin and LSD, figures
in an internal Army survey in
dicate.
However, Brig. Gen. John
Johns told the House Select
Committee on Narcotics
Abuse and Control on Wed
nesday that the Army survey
was unable to determine
whether the use of drugs had
any measurable effect on the
Army's combat readiness.
Johns, director of human re
sources development in the
Army's personnel office, also
said the survey indicated drug
abuse in the military is not as
widespread as shown by an
earlier committee study.
"The Army views its drug
abuse problems as serious but
not of epidemic proportions,"
said Johns.

"The abuse does have some
degree of adverse impact on
combat readiness but it is dif
ficult, if not impossible, to es
tablish a definitive causal rela
tionship that can be quan
tified," he added.
The survey found that 18.6
per cent of the enlisted per
sonnel responded that they
used marijuana occasionally
and an additional 12.6 per cent
said they used it frequently.
The survey also showed that
5.7 per cent of the respondents
said they used hard drugs oc
casionally, while an additional
1.6 per cent said they used hard
drugs frequently.
If the survey figures are
applied to the 671,000 total en
listed men and women, slightly
more than 209,000 would have
admitted using marijuana and
nearly 49,000 would have ad
mitted using hard drugs.
