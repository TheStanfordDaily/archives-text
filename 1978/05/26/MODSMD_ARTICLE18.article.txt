## pretty baby'/hilary landorf One way of dealing with the conventional wisdom 
### 
There are over 1500 whores
in Storyville, New Orleans
circa 1916 when 12-year-old
Violet's virginity is auctioned
off at her "coming-out" debut.
The untouched "peach blos
som" sells for $400, and, after
downing a whiskey, she leads
her john to the appointed
room, where she leaps into her
mother's world with a scream.
In sin Violet proves that she is
more than her mother Hattie's
"pretty baby" — at 12 she has
already picked up her mother's
erotic gestures, and is on her
way to becoming the hottest
trick in New Orleans . . . until
she is plucked by the photo
grapher Bellocq.
Still-wet
Louis Malle's new film

"Pretty Baby" is very much like
the still-life pictures that
photographer Bellocq (played
by Keith Carradine) creates as
resident photographer at
Madam Nell's brothel — stun
ning, but two-dimensional.
Beginning his directing career
with Jacques Cousteau in the
undersea documentary "Le
Monde du Silence" (The Silent
World, 1956), Malle's current
effort continues in the
documentary style of presenta
tion.
Aided by Ingmar Bergman's
cameraman Sven Nykvist,
Malle displays New Orleans
bordello life in all of its deca
dent grandeur — the lavish liv
ing quarters, the tremendous
dinner affairs. Malle captures

expression and gesture with
precision, and the prolonged
still footage of Violet (Brooke
Shields), her mother Hattie
(Susan Sarandon), and the fad
ing Madam Nell (Frances Faye)
are unforgettable in their ar
resting irony. But beautiful
camerawork cannot sustain the
two hours of movie viewing
when there's a fascinating
story to be developed.
Playboy interview
As reported in the March
issue of Playboy, the
screenplay by Polly Piatt (ex
wife of Peter Bogdanovich) is
loosely based on the lives of
photographer E.J. Bellocq and
his "trick baby" Violet. Piatt
took the story of Violet from an
interview with Violet's grand

mother in Al Rose's book cal
led Storyville.
"In the film," Bellocq meets
Violet," Malle tells Playboy.
"Violet is the 12-year-old
daughter of a prostitute, raised
in the brothels. To get her out
of this hell, Bellocq decides to
marry her."
The film traces Violet's life
from her curiosity when peer
ing at her mother at work,
through the dissolution of her
marriage with Bellocq. Though
always precocious, Violet is
most frequently shown silently
gazing at others while they play
with their own lives, and some
times with her own. She is ex
pressionless when she ob
serves her mother at work; she
is the immortal Aphrodite

when she is carried into the
brothel sitting room holding a
sparkler; she stares blankly
over her step-father when he
photographs her with his port
ablecameraatthetrain station.
Shields
Former Ivory Snow baby,
Shields' face is incredibly
beautiful — big brown eyes, a
perfect Creek nose and deli
cately carved skin. It is proba
ble that, as Malle has done in
the past, he intended Violet's
role as a visual study rather
than a study of character, but,
with hints throughout the
movie of a normal child who
wants attention and love from
her elders, one feels slighted
when Violet's character re
mains undeveloped.
Similarly, Bellocq is the sen
sitive man who takes Violet
away from the brothel, but
oddly enough, he later leaves
her standing naked in his
house when he finds that she
has emptied his bottles of de
veloping fluid. If Bellocq's ob
session with his photography
prevents him from sensing that
Violet's actions are those of an
innocent child, why did he
marry her. If there is a real con
flict between Bellocq's profes
sion and his care for children,
doesn't he know himself well
enough to have realized it?
Malle introduces serious ques
tions about human motivia
tion, but he leaves these ques
tions so stark that one feels he

just didn't take the effort to de
velop them.
Susan Sarandon, playing
Violet's mother, puts in a flaw
less performance in a roleshe's
quite familiar with. Having
starred as a runaway daughter
in "Joe" and an adulteress in
"The Other Side of Midnight,"
Sarandon looks very comfort
able as the insensitive Hattie
who abandons Violet to run off
with her spouse Don Hood.
Hattie is the perfect portrait
of the would-be Violet, born in
a whorehouse like her daugh
ter. As the camera alternates
between Hattie's beautiful
brown eyes and her bulging
breasts, one can see visions of
a Violet turned bitter. In short,
because a whore bitch doesn't
call for much development,
Malle's Hattie fits well.
Sex
"Pretty Baby" is not the first
film in which Malle treats the
bawdier side of sex. His second
feature "Les Amants" ("The
Lovers," 1958) cast jeanne
Moreau as an adulteress who
falls in love with an archeology
student after having spent
eight years in a lackluster mar
riage. The sex scenes are
explicit enough to have had
censorship problems when the
movie was brought to the U.S.
in 1958, but Americans raved at
the artistry of the camerawork.
In 1960, Malle's "Zazie dans
le Metro" ("Zazie") was re
leased. The story of a foul

mouthed 11-year-old visiting
her transvestite uncle,
"Zazie"s" success was again
due to Malle's brilliant use of
the camera to focus on non
verbal expression and action.
Malle
In 1971, Malle shocked the
public yet again in "Le Souffle
au Coeur" (Murmur of the
Heart), a high comedy of a
boy's rite of passage in a
French provincial bourgeois
family. Because the film in
cludes incest, it caused much
alarm in France. But, as Malle
told a reviewer for Newsweek
(Nov. 8,1971) his intention was
to "demystify the incest
taboo."
Does Malle's expressed con
cern with disorienting the pub
lic's moral stance on sexual
permissiveness justify the lack
of development in "Pretty
Baby"? Brooke Shields' whor
ing certainly provokes the pub
lic's interest. Even if, as Playboy
reports, Brooke did tell her
mother she was upset because
she had always wanted her first
kiss to be with a boy her own
age, in the film she handles the
sex scenes as if she really were
a professional seducer.
Nevertheless, as a movie
about boredom should not be
boring, "Pretty Baby," about
the indifference that's so easily
learned in a bordello, should
have gone further than simply
capturing that indifference
with a camera.

times with her own. She is ex
pressionless when she ob
serves her mother at work; she
is the immortal Aphrodite

when she is carried into the
brothel sitting room holding a
sparkler; she stares blankly
over her step-father when he
photographs her with his port
ablecameraatthetrain station.
Shields
Former Ivory Snow baby,
Shields' face is incredibly
beautiful — big brown eyes, a
perfect Creek nose and deli
cately carved skin. It is proba
ble that, as Malle has done in
the past, he intended Violet's
role as a visual study rather
than a study of character, but,
with hints throughout the
movie of a normal child who
wants attention and love from
her elders, one feels slighted
when Violet's character re
mains undeveloped.
Similarly, Bellocq is the sen
sitive man who takes Violet
away from the brothel, but
oddly enough, he later leaves
her standing naked in his
house when he finds that she
has emptied his bottles of de
veloping fluid. If Bellocq's ob
session with his photography
prevents him from sensing that
Violet's actions are those of an
innocent child, why did he
marry her. If there is a real con
flict between Bellocq's profes
sion and his care for children,
doesn't he know himself well
enough to have realized it?
Malle introduces serious ques
tions about human motivia
tion, but he leaves these ques
tions so stark that one feels he

just didn't take the effort to de
velop them.
Susan Sarandon, playing
Violet's mother, puts in a flaw
less performance in a roleshe's
quite familiar with. Having
starred as a runaway daughter
in "Joe" and an adulteress in
"The Other Side of Midnight,"
Sarandon looks very comfort
able as the insensitive Hattie
who abandons Violet to run off
with her spouse Don Hood.
Hattie is the perfect portrait
of the would-be Violet, born in
a whorehouse like her daugh
ter. As the camera alternates
between Hattie's beautiful
brown eyes and her bulging
breasts, one can see visions of
a Violet turned bitter. In short,
because a whore bitch doesn't
call for much development,
Malle's Hattie fits well.
Sex
"Pretty Baby" is not the first
film in which Malle treats the
bawdier side of sex. His second
feature "Les Amants" ("The
Lovers," 1958) cast jeanne
Moreau as an adulteress who
falls in love with an archeology
student after having spent
eight years in a lackluster mar
riage. The sex scenes are
explicit enough to have had
censorship problems when the
movie was brought to the U.S.
in 1958, but Americans raved at
the artistry of the camerawork.
In 1960, Malle's "Zazie dans
le Metro" ("Zazie") was re
leased. The story of a foul

mouthed 11-year-old visiting
her transvestite uncle,
"Zazie"s" success was again
due to Malle's brilliant use of
the camera to focus on non
verbal expression and action.
Malle
In 1971, Malle shocked the
public yet again in "Le Souffle
au Coeur" (Murmur of the
Heart), a high comedy of a
boy's rite of passage in a
French provincial bourgeois
family. Because the film in
cludes incest, it caused much
alarm in France. But, as Malle
told a reviewer for Newsweek
(Nov. 8,1971) his intention was
to "demystify the incest
taboo."
Does Malle's expressed con
cern with disorienting the pub
lic's moral stance on sexual
permissiveness justify the lack
of development in "Pretty
Baby"? Brooke Shields' whor
ing certainly provokes the pub
lic's interest. Even if, as Playboy
reports, Brooke did tell her
mother she was upset because
she had always wanted her first
kiss to be with a boy her own
age, in the film she handles the
sex scenes as if she really were
a professional seducer.
Nevertheless, as a movie
about boredom should not be
boring, "Pretty Baby," about
the indifference that's so easily
learned in a bordello, should
have gone further than simply
capturing that indifference
with a camera.
There are over 1500 whores
in Storyville, New Orleans
circa 1916 when 12-year-old
Violet's virginity is auctioned
off at her "coming-out" debut.
The untouched "peach blos
som" sells for $400, and, after
downing a whiskey, she leads
her john to the appointed
room, where she leaps into her
mother's world with a scream.
In sin Violet proves that she is
more than her mother Hattie's
"pretty baby" — at 12 she has
already picked up her mother's
erotic gestures, and is on her
way to becoming the hottest
trick in New Orleans . . . until
she is plucked by the photo
grapher Bellocq.
Still-wet
Louis Malle's new film

"Pretty Baby" is very much like
the still-life pictures that
photographer Bellocq (played
by Keith Carradine) creates as
resident photographer at
Madam Nell's brothel — stun
ning, but two-dimensional.
Beginning his directing career
with Jacques Cousteau in the
undersea documentary "Le
Monde du Silence" (The Silent
World, 1956), Malle's current
effort continues in the
documentary style of presenta
tion.
Aided by Ingmar Bergman's
cameraman Sven Nykvist,
Malle displays New Orleans
bordello life in all of its deca
dent grandeur — the lavish liv
ing quarters, the tremendous
dinner affairs. Malle captures

expression and gesture with
precision, and the prolonged
still footage of Violet (Brooke
Shields), her mother Hattie
(Susan Sarandon), and the fad
ing Madam Nell (Frances Faye)
are unforgettable in their ar
resting irony. But beautiful
camerawork cannot sustain the
two hours of movie viewing
when there's a fascinating
story to be developed.
Playboy interview
As reported in the March
issue of Playboy, the
screenplay by Polly Piatt (ex
wife of Peter Bogdanovich) is
loosely based on the lives of
photographer E.J. Bellocq and
his "trick baby" Violet. Piatt
took the story of Violet from an
interview with Violet's grand

"Violet is the 12-year-old

The film traces Violet's life
from her curiosity when peer
ing at her mother at work,
through the dissolution of her
marriage with Bellocq. Though
always precocious, Violet is
most frequently shown silently
gazing at others while they play
with their own lives, and some

the artistry of the camerawork.
In 1960, Malle's "Zazie dans
le Metro" ("Zazie") was re
leased. The story of a foul

mouthed 11-year-old visiting
her transvestite uncle,
"Zazie"s" success was again
due to Malle's brilliant use of
the camera to focus on non
verbal expression and action.
Malle
In 1971, Malle shocked the
public yet again in "Le Souffle
au Coeur" (Murmur of the
Heart), a high comedy of a
boy's rite of passage in a
French provincial bourgeois
family. Because the film in
cludes incest, it caused much
alarm in France. But, as Malle
told a reviewer for Newsweek
(Nov. 8,1971) his intention was
to "demystify the incest
taboo."
Does Malle's expressed con
cern with disorienting the pub
lic's moral stance on sexual
permissiveness justify the lack
of development in "Pretty
Baby"? Brooke Shields' whor
ing certainly provokes the pub
lic's interest. Even if, as Playboy
reports, Brooke did tell her
mother she was upset because
she had always wanted her first
kiss to be with a boy her own
age, in the film she handles the
sex scenes as if she really were
a professional seducer.
Nevertheless, as a movie
about boredom should not be
boring, "Pretty Baby," about
the indifference that's so easily
learned in a bordello, should
have gone further than simply
capturing that indifference
with a camera.
