Casablanca *★*■**
Festival
Very obscure film, but you
should see it. After all, you're
part of his work, thethingthat
keeps him going. If this movie
leaves the Festival and you're
not on it you'll regret it.
Maybe not today, maybe not
tomorrow, but soon, and for
the rest of your life.
—John Nielsen
American Graffiti ★***■
Old Mill
Rereleased, with new
scenes, and now you can see
it for the fifth time. With
Richard Dreyfuss the famous
Oscar winner. Also with
what's her name from
"Laverne and Shirley," and
Ron Howard, in his best per
formance since "Andy of
Mayberry ." Loud music,
gang fights, tender drama and
Wolfman. Jack; pathos, hilar
ity and effective use of the
pause. Very good.

New York, New York #★**
Sunday, Mem Aud
Not your everyday Busby
Berkeley tribute. Robert De
Niro plays a hypnotically
libidinous erstwhile G.I. —
now saxophone player; Liza
Minnelli stands opposite him
with considerable panache.
The dialogue, which was
primarily improvised, cannot
support the weight of the ac
tion, but the central figure
carries it off despite the pro
cedural flaws. They can act, is
the thing, and that today is
rare. Underrated, and un
nerving.
—J.N.
Turning Point *■*
Century 25, San Jose
A lot of people think this is a
tremendous movie, very
powerful, with much to say
about living and dancing and
dealing with the problems of
age. Baloney. Don't call me at
home about this, because I
know it smells of manslaugh
ter, but "Turning Point" is an
inflated, shrill, pretentious
fake salvageable only because
it incidentally features the
finest dancer on the planet.
The actor*' credentials are
impeccable, but they cannot
save the thing from its grocery
store pulp novel state of
mind. Stupid.
-J.N.
The Goodbye Girl
Old Mill
Famous Oscar winner
Richard Dreyfuss won his
famous Oscar in this picture,
which also features Neil Si
mon's wife and a mutant child
actress. "Goodbye" tells the
story of a fast-mouthed ro
mance and is distinguishable
from "Barefoot in the Park"
because it is set in a different
part of New York. Be on the
lookout for Simon's upcom
ing hits, too — "The Odd
Goodbye," "The Goodbye
Couple," "California Good
bye" and "Murder by Good
bye." What an artist this man
is. Hollywood's finest.
—J.N.
Annie Hall ***★★
Aquarius Twin
A movie about a skinny,
red-haired schlemeil come
dian with No-Doz man
nerisms and a masochistic
wit. Roughly directed, with a
whiney, indulgent tone and a
vaguely disturbing aftertaste.
(In short, the best film Woody
Allen has ever made.) For all
of their strengths, Allen films
until "Annie" had been exer
cises in comic overkill they
never let up, and eventually,
albeit guiltily, we wish he
would shut up for a minute;
"Annie" is different in that it
lets the ribs rest from time to
time. To use a wildly revealing
phrase, this is a movie with
depth.
-J.N.
The last Waltz *★**
Century 21, San Jose
The cinematography is flaw
less, as should be expected

from the director of "Mean
Streets," "Taxi Driver," and
"New York, New York" (Mar
tin Scorsese, stupid). Unlike
most rock and roll films —
they traditionally have done
little more than provide View
Master recreations of two
hour guitar solos — unlike
most of those "Waltz" man
ages a superb marriage of the
concert and the documen
tary. Itisagenuine thrill tosee
a song you have only known
in disembodied form emerge
from the mouth of a genuine
human being; human beings
in this production include
Bob Dylan, Neil Young, |oni
Mitchell, Neil Diamond,
Muddy Waters and Eric Clap
ton. Without a doubt, the
finest rock film extant.
— J.N.
Blue Collar ****
For the simple price of ad
mission to "Blue Collar," you
get: an inside glimpse into
today's working class, an in
triguing and profound politi
cal statement, a Richard Pryor
who finally acts, great music,
innovative direction by Paul
Schrader, and much more.
Noting this season's execra
ble offerings from the movie
industry, "Blue Collar's" sim
ple directness is as refreshing
as an omniscient, innocent
smile.
Co-stars Yaphet Kotto and
Harvey Keitel.
—|ohn Gibson
F.I.S.T ★★
Palo Alto Square
Employs "The Godfather"
films' scope but lacks their
depth. This story of the epic
rise and fall of a union leader
reminds one especially of the
Michael Corleone section of
"Godfather II"; to excess, in
fact. The Congressional hear
ings and the murders from
that film are unabashedly —
and in comparison, badly —
imitated here.
The director, Norman Jewi
son, asks the audience to ac

cept way too much, and he
also fails to give the film any
sense of consistently believa
ble passion or tension. His
surface approach to the mate
rial is the film's biggest liabil
ity. What the movie desper
ately needed was a director
with sociological (and artistic)
insight; i.e., someone like
Francis Ford Coppola.
The film is kept from be
coming abysmal by Sylvester
Stallone's galvanic, if uneven,
performance as )ohnny
Kovacs, member, and even
tually leader, of F.I.S.T. (Fed
eration of Interstate Truc
kers). His performance con
tains the film's only moments
of passion. These moments
only serve to heighten the
remainder of the film's frus
trating somberness and emo
tional emptiness.
—Ron Lillejord
The Greek Tycoon
Fine Arts
In 1976, "Once is Not
Enough" was released. Last
year brought us "The Other
Side of Midnight." This year,
"The Greek Tycoon" joins
these instantly forgettable
soap opera movies which
celebrate the vapidness of the
rich and of moviemakers.
The film details the "inside
story" of the Aristotle
Onassis-Jackie Kennedy mar
riage. The names have been
changed, of course (to To
masis and Cassidy). Like its
innumerable predecessors,
this tripe will probably make a
lot of money, confirming the
opinion in Hollywood that
glossy garbage pays.
—R.L.
An Unmarried Woman
Old Mill
Paul Mazursky's ("Harry
and Tonto") warm and intelli
gent look at 70s divorce, (ill
Clayburgh finally gets a role
which is equal to her talent,
and she doesn't disappoint.
The film is a bit slow in its

middle third, where there are
some very weak scenes with a
therapist. However, in gen
eral the film is comic and af
fecting without being cruel or
saccharine. Alan Bates stands
out in a fine supporting cast.
—R.L.
COMING HOME ****
Berkeley
Set in 1968, "Coming
Home" is a drama about
people at home dealing with
the Vietnam War. One of its
major characters is unde
fined, and it occasionally suf
fers from poor transition, but
the movie more than makes
up for these deficiencies with
its understanding of the look
and feel of the time, lane
Fonda and Jon Voight (as a
paraplegic) are excellent; and
Hal Ashby's direction is fine
throughout. r
CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE
THIRD KIND *****
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
Steven Spielberg's wonder
fully childlike fantasy about
man's first meeting with ex
traterrestial beings. Spielberg
is clearly indebted to Hitch
cock, but in all the right
ways, and he has the youthful
exuberance that Hitchcock
lost about four decades ago.
The unfortunate thing about
"Close Encounters" is that it
came so soon after "Star
Wars," a situation which pro
vokes unnecessary and mis
leading comparisons bet
ween the two.

"The Greek Tycoon" joins

The film details the "inside

A movie about a skinny,

(In short, the best film Woody

of their strengths, Allen films
until "Annie" had been exer
cises in comic overkill they
never let up, and eventually,
albeit guiltily, we wish he
would shut up for a minute;
"Annie" is different in that it

most rock and roll films —
they traditionally have done
little more than provide View
Master recreations of two
hour guitar solos — unlike
most of those "Waltz" man
ages a superb marriage of the
concert and the documen

a song you have only known

also fails to give the film any
sense of consistently believa

surface approach to the mate

because it is set in a different
part of New York. Be on the
lookout for Simon's upcom
ing hits, too — "The Odd
Goodbye," "The Goodbye
Couple," "California Good
bye" and "Murder by Good
bye." What an artist this man
is. Hollywood's finest.

Annie Hall ***★★
Aquarius Twin
A movie about a skinny,
red-haired schlemeil come
dian with No-Doz man
nerisms and a masochistic
wit. Roughly directed, with a
whiney, indulgent tone and a
vaguely disturbing aftertaste.
(In short, the best film Woody
Allen has ever made.) For all
of their strengths, Allen films
until "Annie" had been exer
cises in comic overkill they
never let up, and eventually,
albeit guiltily, we wish he
would shut up for a minute;
"Annie" is different in that it
lets the ribs rest from time to
time. To use a wildly revealing
phrase, this is a movie with
depth.

The last Waltz *★**
Century 21, San Jose
The cinematography is flaw
less, as should be expected

from the director of "Mean
Streets," "Taxi Driver," and
"New York, New York" (Mar
tin Scorsese, stupid). Unlike
most rock and roll films —
they traditionally have done
little more than provide View
Master recreations of two
hour guitar solos — unlike
most of those "Waltz" man
ages a superb marriage of the
concert and the documen
tary. Itisagenuine thrill tosee
a song you have only known
in disembodied form emerge
from the mouth of a genuine
human being; human beings
in this production include
Bob Dylan, Neil Young, |oni
Mitchell, Neil Diamond,
Muddy Waters and Eric Clap
ton. Without a doubt, the
finest rock film extant.
— J.N.
Blue Collar ****
For the simple price of ad
mission to "Blue Collar," you
get: an inside glimpse into
today's working class, an in
triguing and profound politi
cal statement, a Richard Pryor
who finally acts, great music,
innovative direction by Paul
Schrader, and much more.
Noting this season's execra
ble offerings from the movie
industry, "Blue Collar's" sim
ple directness is as refreshing
as an omniscient, innocent
smile.
Co-stars Yaphet Kotto and
Harvey Keitel.

F.I.S.T ★★
Palo Alto Square
Employs "The Godfather"
films' scope but lacks their
depth. This story of the epic
rise and fall of a union leader
reminds one especially of the
Michael Corleone section of
"Godfather II"; to excess, in
fact. The Congressional hear
ings and the murders from
that film are unabashedly —
and in comparison, badly —
imitated here.
The director, Norman Jewi
son, asks the audience to ac

cept way too much, and he
also fails to give the film any
sense of consistently believa
ble passion or tension. His
surface approach to the mate
rial is the film's biggest liabil
ity. What the movie desper
ately needed was a director
with sociological (and artistic)
insight; i.e., someone like
Francis Ford Coppola.
The film is kept from be
coming abysmal by Sylvester
Stallone's galvanic, if uneven,
performance as )ohnny
Kovacs, member, and even
tually leader, of F.I.S.T. (Fed
eration of Interstate Truc
kers). His performance con
tains the film's only moments
of passion. These moments
only serve to heighten the
remainder of the film's frus
trating somberness and emo
tional emptiness.

The Greek Tycoon
Fine Arts
In 1976, "Once is Not
Enough" was released. Last
year brought us "The Other
Side of Midnight." This year,
"The Greek Tycoon" joins
these instantly forgettable
soap opera movies which
celebrate the vapidness of the
rich and of moviemakers.
The film details the "inside
story" of the Aristotle
Onassis-Jackie Kennedy mar
riage. The names have been
changed, of course (to To
masis and Cassidy). Like its
innumerable predecessors,
this tripe will probably make a
lot of money, confirming the
opinion in Hollywood that
glossy garbage pays.

An Unmarried Woman
Old Mill
Paul Mazursky's ("Harry
and Tonto") warm and intelli
gent look at 70s divorce, (ill
Clayburgh finally gets a role
which is equal to her talent,
and she doesn't disappoint.
The film is a bit slow in its

middle third, where there are
some very weak scenes with a
therapist. However, in gen
eral the film is comic and af
fecting without being cruel or
saccharine. Alan Bates stands
out in a fine supporting cast.
—R.L.
COMING HOME ****
Berkeley
Set in 1968, "Coming
Home" is a drama about
people at home dealing with
the Vietnam War. One of its
major characters is unde
fined, and it occasionally suf
fers from poor transition, but
the movie more than makes
up for these deficiencies with
its understanding of the look
and feel of the time, lane
Fonda and Jon Voight (as a
paraplegic) are excellent; and
Hal Ashby's direction is fine
throughout. r
CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE
THIRD KIND *****
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
Steven Spielberg's wonder
fully childlike fantasy about
man's first meeting with ex
traterrestial beings. Spielberg
is clearly indebted to Hitch
cock, but in all the right
ways, and he has the youthful
exuberance that Hitchcock
lost about four decades ago.
The unfortunate thing about
"Close Encounters" is that it
came so soon after "Star
Wars," a situation which pro
vokes unnecessary and mis
leading comparisons bet
ween the two.
—R.L.

Very obscure film, but you

Maybe not today, maybe not

American Graffiti ★***■
Old Mill
Rereleased, with new
scenes, and now you can see
it for the fifth time. With
Richard Dreyfuss the famous
Oscar winner. Also with
what's her name from
"Laverne and Shirley," and
Ron Howard, in his best per
formance since "Andy of
Mayberry ." Loud music,
gang fights, tender drama and
Wolfman. Jack; pathos, hilar
ity and effective use of the
pause. Very good.

New York, New York #★**
Sunday, Mem Aud
Not your everyday Busby
Berkeley tribute. Robert De
Niro plays a hypnotically
libidinous erstwhile G.I. —
now saxophone player; Liza
Minnelli stands opposite him
with considerable panache.
The dialogue, which was
primarily improvised, cannot
support the weight of the ac
tion, but the central figure
carries it off despite the pro
cedural flaws. They can act, is
the thing, and that today is
rare. Underrated, and un
nerving.

Turning Point *■*
Century 25, San Jose
A lot of people think this is a
tremendous movie, very
powerful, with much to say
about living and dancing and
dealing with the problems of
age. Baloney. Don't call me at
home about this, because I
know it smells of manslaugh
ter, but "Turning Point" is an
inflated, shrill, pretentious
fake salvageable only because
it incidentally features the
finest dancer on the planet.
The actor*' credentials are
impeccable, but they cannot
save the thing from its grocery
store pulp novel state of
mind. Stupid.
-J.N.
The Goodbye Girl
Old Mill
Famous Oscar winner
Richard Dreyfuss won his
famous Oscar in this picture,
which also features Neil Si

actress. "Goodbye" tells the
story of a fast-mouthed ro
mance and is distinguishable
from "Barefoot in the Park"
because it is set in a different
part of New York. Be on the
lookout for Simon's upcom
