# Eight frats under quota for pledges once again
## 
### Bill Burner 
The preliminary spring rush results
released Wednesday by Tom
Hornbeak, assistant director of the
row, show that eight of Jhe Universi
ty's 13 fraternities missed their
quotas by totals ranging from 1 to 6.5
points.
Hornbeak said the fraternities
have until October 5 to find addi
tional pledges.
Last year at this time, there were
also eight fraternities below quota.
Six of these filled their quotas by the
final deadline, however.
Fraternities under quota by bet
ween one and three points are,
Alpha Delta Phi, Delta Upsilon,
Kappa Sigma, and Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon
Fraternities under the quota by
more than three points are, Delta Tau
Delta, Phi Delta Theta and Theta Xi.
Beta Theta Pi, Delta kappa Epsilon,
Kappa Alpha, Sigma Chi and Theta
Delta Chi all made their quotas by .5
to 7 points.
The fraternity system as a whole
was 13.5 points under quota of 239.5.
Alpha Delts have missed their
quota the last two years and any
house's failure to meet quota for
three out of four consecutive years
can place it in the draw system by
determination of the Office of Resi
dential Education.
Alpha Delt President Mark Don
nelly said the house would reached
its quota of 22 sophomore equiva
lents "without a doubt" by the Oc
tober deadline. "We have some solid
prospects hanging on the fence,"
Donnelly said.
Hornbeak said a house's com
pliance with the quota system has
not been tested since the system's
implementation four years ago.
IFC Rush Chairman Mark Triska
noted that "a lot of cards haven't
been signed yet'' and predicted that
the fraternity system could gain at
least 10 additional points by October
6.
Triska said transfer students would
be "fair game" in the fall. "Many
transfers are already members of
frats before they come here," Triska
said.
Triska said many fraternity mem
bers feel the University's quota sys
tem is "unfair." He noted that juniors
who join fraternities and live in the
house are not counted by the quota
system, which assigns a one-point
value to freshmen with two years of
guaranteed housing and one-half
point to sophomores with one year
of guaranteed housing left.
Hornbeak also said the system is
"not perfect" and "needs review" in
several areas. He suggested this as a
"good project for the IFC (Inter-
Fraternity Council) to initiate."
Hornbeak said several houses are
submitting housing guarantee cards
late to the Row Office and predicted
that the fraternity system will add at
least four points to its total by next
week.
