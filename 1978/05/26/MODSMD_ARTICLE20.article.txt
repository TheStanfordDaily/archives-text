## Sam's Grill and Seafood: a bit of old San Francisco 
### 
Sam's Grill and Seafood
374 Bush Street
San Francisco
421-0594
Tradition does not have to be
expensive, especially when di
ning out. Established in 1867,
Sam's Grill and Seafood is a bit
of old San Francisco. Dwarfed
by the towering pillars of
capitalism (better known as the
Financial District), Sam's has a
large devoted clientele of
businessmen.
Undoubtedly, many a mul
timillion dollar deal has been
concluded in the private
booths which fill half the re
staurant, yet the atmosphere is
welcoming to all. The mood is
simple and old fashioned, as
reflected in the massive
wooden bar and the distin
guished waiters, attired in for
mal black and white.
The amply stocked bar,
which is imposingly situated at
the entrance, serves aperitifs
and cocktails while one waits
to be seated. Drinks range in

price from $.75 for a glass of
red or white wine, to $2.50 for a
champagne cocktail.
We were quickly seated and
presented with the menus,
which differ from day to day.
Everything, including vegeta
bles, must be ordered a la
carte.
A variety of appetizers are of
fered, including Avocado
Cocktail ($1.50) and Oyster
Cocktail ($3.50). Old favorites
such as Crab Cocktail ($3) and
Shrimp Cocktail ($2.25) are also
available.
We chose to start off with
soup — clam chowder ($1) and
mock turtle ($.75). The chow
der was thick and creamy, a
cross between New England
and Manhattan style, with just
a hint of tomato. The mock tur
tle soup (actually it is made
with cow brains) was piquantly
spiced with a variety of herbs
and generous pieces of meat.
We decided to split Sam's
Special Salad ($5.50) which was
practically an entree in itself.

This unusual seafood salad
consisted of cooked celery
topped with tomatoes and av
ocado, then crowned with
shrimp, fresh crab and a strip
of anchovy. A light oil and vin
egar dressing accented this
specialty. Also offered was the
exotic sounding Anchovy Salad
($2.90), which we decided to
bypass due to a mutual disklike
of anchovies.
Since Sam's specializes in
grill and seafood we chose De
viled Crab en Casserole ($5.75)
and Sirloin Steak a la Minut,
Bercy ($7). The crab dish was
rich, heavy and somewhat
bland. Fresh cooked crab was
diced and mixed in a casserole
with a blend of cheeses, on
ions, peppers and a bit of fresh
lemon. The large steak was
thick and juicy: grilling further
enhanced its flavor. Accom
panying the steak was a serving
of fried potatoes, which might
have tasted even better had
they been hotter when served.
Other entrees which tempted
our palates included

Hangtown Fry (Olympia Oys
ters,ss.7s) and Abalone ($9).
To all fellow spinach en
thusiasts, we would highly re
commend ordering the superb
creamed spinach ($.75), which
was the best we had ever en
countered. Unfortunately the
kitchen had run out of sauteed
artichoke hearts ($1.15), which
we had been looking forward

to.
The dessert menu proved to
be too tempting, so we treated
ourselves to delicious French
Pancakes ($1.50), thin crepe
like pancakes saturated in
anisette syrup, a mild licorice
flavor. Again we had to forgo a
selection, as the kitchen was
out of Zaboglione ($1.50)
which was described as an Ita

lian dessert made of whipped
egg whites, sugar, and other
mysterious ingredients.
The service reflected a
business-like atmosphere. Our
elegant waiter was very effi
cient though somewhat aloof.
Each course arrived quickly,
with little waiting in between.
Sam's is a unique breed of
restaurant of which few re

main. If you are looking for an
historical dining spot with de
cent food, you should defi
nitely consider Sam's Grill.
Sam's Grill is open weekdays
fromll a.m.toB:3op.m.andis
closed on Saturday and Sun

which differ from day to day.
Everything, including vegeta
bles, must be ordered a la
carte.
A variety of appetizers are of
fered, including Avocado
Cocktail ($1.50) and Oyster
Cocktail ($3.50). Old favorites
such as Crab Cocktail ($3) and
Shrimp Cocktail ($2.25) are also
available.
We chose to start off with
soup — clam chowder ($1) and
mock turtle ($.75). The chow
der was thick and creamy, a
cross between New England
and Manhattan style, with just
a hint of tomato. The mock tur
tle soup (actually it is made
with cow brains) was piquantly
spiced with a variety of herbs
and generous pieces of meat.
We decided to split Sam's
Special Salad ($5.50) which was
practically an entree in itself.

This unusual seafood salad
consisted of cooked celery
topped with tomatoes and av
ocado, then crowned with
shrimp, fresh crab and a strip
of anchovy. A light oil and vin
egar dressing accented this
specialty. Also offered was the
exotic sounding Anchovy Salad
($2.90), which we decided to
bypass due to a mutual disklike
of anchovies.
Since Sam's specializes in
grill and seafood we chose De
viled Crab en Casserole ($5.75)
and Sirloin Steak a la Minut,
Bercy ($7). The crab dish was
rich, heavy and somewhat
bland. Fresh cooked crab was
diced and mixed in a casserole
with a blend of cheeses, on
ions, peppers and a bit of fresh
lemon. The large steak was
thick and juicy: grilling further
enhanced its flavor. Accom
panying the steak was a serving
of fried potatoes, which might
have tasted even better had
they been hotter when served.
Other entrees which tempted
our palates included

Hangtown Fry (Olympia Oys
ters,ss.7s) and Abalone ($9).
To all fellow spinach en
thusiasts, we would highly re
commend ordering the superb
creamed spinach ($.75), which
was the best we had ever en
countered. Unfortunately the
kitchen had run out of sauteed
artichoke hearts ($1.15), which
we had been looking forward

to.
The dessert menu proved to
be too tempting, so we treated
ourselves to delicious French
Pancakes ($1.50), thin crepe
like pancakes saturated in
anisette syrup, a mild licorice
flavor. Again we had to forgo a
selection, as the kitchen was
out of Zaboglione ($1.50)
which was described as an Ita

lian dessert made of whipped
egg whites, sugar, and other
mysterious ingredients.
The service reflected a
business-like atmosphere. Our
elegant waiter was very effi
cient though somewhat aloof.
Each course arrived quickly,
with little waiting in between.
Sam's is a unique breed of
restaurant of which few re

main. If you are looking for an
historical dining spot with de
cent food, you should defi
nitely consider Sam's Grill.
Sam's Grill is open weekdays
fromll a.m.toB:3op.m.andis
closed on Saturday and Sun
day.

Tradition does not have to be
expensive, especially when di
ning out. Established in 1867,
Sam's Grill and Seafood is a bit
of old San Francisco. Dwarfed
by the towering pillars of
capitalism (better known as the
Financial District), Sam's has a
large devoted clientele of
businessmen.
Undoubtedly, many a mul
timillion dollar deal has been
concluded in the private
booths which fill half the re
staurant, yet the atmosphere is
welcoming to all. The mood is
simple and old fashioned, as
reflected in the massive
wooden bar and the distin
guished waiters, attired in for
mal black and white.
The amply stocked bar,
which is imposingly situated at
the entrance, serves aperitifs
and cocktails while one waits
to be seated. Drinks range in

price from $.75 for a glass of
red or white wine, to $2.50 for a
champagne cocktail.
We were quickly seated and
presented with the menus,
which differ from day to day.
Everything, including vegeta
bles, must be ordered a la

A variety of appetizers are of
