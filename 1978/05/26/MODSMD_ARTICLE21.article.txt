# Mood at LOTS is frustration
## CERAS lively in early hours 
### Anne Bowden 
Red carpet slopes over the floor, up the
steps and onto the next level. From the
second and third floor balconies, wooden
bannisters shine down at frustrated com
puter operators on the main floor.
From these upper levels of the CFRAS
building, one can see a quietly shifting
group of people below. White light from a
hanging dome lamp shines onto
backpacks and boxes laying on the central
table. A cluster of people lean on the table
edges, staring into a television-like screen
as they wait for an open terminal in one of
the small carrels lining the walls.
Another cluster of students stare uncom
prehendingly at folded sheets of paper a
counselor holds in his hands. They can not
understand why their programs do not
work.
From the first floor comes the irregular
buzzing of the print-out machine. A steady
stream of paper falls from the machine's
mouth into a twisted pile in a waiting bas
ket.
Rows of navy blue, soft-cushioned
chairs line the walls. Students, alone or in
pairs, spread varying amounts of paper,
books and Pepsi cans in the spaces around
them.
"Yeah, at one time earlier tonight, we

had 109 people waiting for terminals,"
Randy Strauss, student consultant, said.
"At that point the computer, which only
has space for 100 names, lopped off some
people and overlapped the original order.
It was pretty messy," he said.
Gathering around the central table, a
growing group of students continue to
stare anxiously at the queuing screen.
They can not begin to work on their prog
rams until one of the approximately 60
terminals becomes free.
LOTS runs under a full load. People
soon resign themselves to a four or five
hour wait. They probably will not leave
CERAS until the very early morning hours.
And if the work doesn't get done in the
allotted two-hour maximum?
"Sometimes the teacher gives us an ex
tension. Most of the time, though, youjust
resign yourself to the loss of points and
don't get too uptight about it," one stu
dent said.
An atmosphere of quiet frustration fogs
CERAS. Those who have terminals wait for
the overloaded computer's slow re
sponses. A roomful of consultants help
discover time and time again the reasons
for various "bugs," or problems, with stu
dents' programs.

Many individuals spend entire days or
nights here, waiting for another turn on a
terminal. Some sleep upstairs or in a lec
ture room away from the shuffling groups
on the first floor. Others nap in the blue
cushioned seats, surrounded by
homework papers for another class.
Scattered paper coffee cups, orange
cans and cookie wrappers attest to the
vending machines' popularity.'
"Get rid of the cigarette machine," one
student suggested. "We really need a
sandwich machine instead."
"Why did they replace the Mountain
Dew with lemonade?" another student
wondered.
In remote corners of the main floor, it is
evident that some people have not been
home to shower for at least a day or two.
"The line printer munched my prog
ram," one student said. "I've been here
since 8 a.m. and still haven't finished.
"What can I do?" another lamented.
Behind the shadow of a partition,
slumped on the rolling red carpet, one
man has his back propped against the wall.
He stares into the spaces between moving
people. An empty coffee cup that had tip
ped over in his hand leans against his
knee.


Students in CERAS Jate at night work on programs, logic classes and dissertations or play such games as
Star Trek and blackjack on the LOTS computer. Currently there are too many terminals for the computer
to handle efficiently, and not enough terminals to meet students' demand.
