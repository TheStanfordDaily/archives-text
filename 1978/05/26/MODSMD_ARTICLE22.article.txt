# Texts can be changed easily
## Computers help do dissertations 
### Lori Buffum 
They juggle numbers, get blamed for
human blunders, cook your supper and
determine when and where you will hit
red lights. Now, computers can help you
write and type your dissertation.
Stanford graduate student Sue Estler
was shopping for a typist when someone
suggested she try a computer instead. Her
data analysis had introduced Estler to the
labor-saving possibilities offered by com
puters, so the suggestion seemed reason
able.
"A big advantage of the computerized
approach," said Estler, "is that the text can
be changed quickly and easily."
Producing a dissertation involves coor
dination between a student and his or her
committee, so dissertations change at an
alarming rate. Using traditional resources,
each alteration means at least one page

will have to be retyped.
Computers offer a convenient way to
modify and store texts, and high-speed
printers can type almost three pages per
second. This allows students to distribute
typed revisions the same day changes are
made, a Herculean feat without computer
assistance.
The Campus Facility of the Stanford
Center for Information Processing (SCIP)
recently acquired a laser printer.
Both the type-style and the 8% x 11 inch
white paper from this printer satisfy the
quality standards fordissertations, accord
ing to the Graduate Studies Office. Print
ing costs two cents per page and multiple
copies can be ordered with a keystroke.
Drafts can be printed almost instantane
ously on conventional blue-bar computer
paper.

Manipulating a text is very easy to learn,
said SCIP word processing specialist Jean
nie Siegman. WYLBUR, the text editing
language available at SCIP, can transform
almost anyone into a fast typist. A special
low-cost account provides unlimited even
ing and weekend use of this powerful
editor for the flat rate of $2 an hour.
Programmers have also developed lan
guages that perform the tedious, error
prone tasks associated with formatting. A
language called SCRIPT can insert foot
notes, make tables and number pages, au
tomatically considering the latest version
of text.
SCIP offers short courses on WYLBUR
and SCRIPT, has documents and audio
visual tutorials for self-instruction and
provides consultants to answer specific
questions. Call the SCIP User Services Of
