# This year's Quad like high school yearbook in cleverness, accuracy
## 
### Reviewed by David Ansley 
With the publication of the
1978 Quad, the University
community is seeing the resur
rection of an almost forgotten
art form, the high school an
nual.
From the deep inner mean
ing of the cover (turn it side
ways) to the sales-pitch en
dorsement from the publisher
of Time magazine, the staff has

produced a volume which ri
vals the groundbreaking satiri
cal work of the National Lam
poon.
Witness the balanced cover
age: four pages of photos of
the Band, Dollies and Yell
Leaders, countered with eight
of the football team.
Witness the clever commen
tary: the Daily photo editor,
looking glum, pictured with

someone else's blurry foot in
his lap.
Witness the adherence to
form: reams of white space on
almost every page, enough for
every member of the graduat
ing class to fill with "2 good 2
be 4 got."
The photo quality is perhaps
a touch too high for a true re
ndition, but we must consider
the limitations: it's difficult to
persuade Chuck Painter from
News and Publications to pur
posefully blur his shots.
They slipped a few zingers in
anyway. For example, I doubt
that ice cream vendor on page
262 often wears a hat with
"Carnation" spelled in mirror
image.
And the individual who took
the color picture on the first
page will be proud to show the
book to his/her mom. Even if
the photo credit is wrong.
Great expense was spared by
typesetting almost nothing
original, like photo captions.
Would you believe Clark Sterl
ing's name appears only twice?
Creativity was left up to the
individuals in the book: the
Latvian Studies major, E.M. Bo
(the index says his first name is
Edward), and hundreds of
Communication majors who
are listed as Communications
majors.
I take that back about staff
creativity. I just found a refer

ence to "nationally ranked San
Hose State" and Forence
Moore. They lack the punch of
the Sammamish (Issaquah
High) reference to a coed
home ec. class that "altered
sex rolls," but they indicate
good development of style.
The comic strip, of course,
requires no comment.
hive years from now, trying
to recall the events of 1978, I
might wish that the controver
sies had been dealt with more
fully. "Richard I yman speaking
. . . on the tenure issue" leaves
out such important details as
his favorite color.
"I said I had no involvement.
That was a lie," as the only de
scription of ASSU politics, ig
nores everything else, includ
ing the wrath of the innocent
senator under whose photo
the caption appears.
As in any good yearbook,
"Academics" is given the place
it deserves: it follows, in order,
"Politics," "Seniors," "Or
ganizations" and "Sports,"
and consists of your standard
"Approaching Stanford"
photographs.
It is clear that this year's
Quad staff, in developing this
publication, drew strong inspi
ration from the cover artist. He
admires "an atmosphere sepa
rate from the world outside the
painting."
