Could it l>e magic 112 Professional magician and Stanford alum
nus Mark Kosckind runs through the familiar "magic rings"
trick as he rehearses for this weekend's "I believe in Magic"
show. Kosekind and company's second annual benefit for the
Children's Hospital at Stanford will certainly make you wonder
if it is indeed magic, and they have promised a new set of
illusions never before seen in the Bay Area. The two perfor
mances this Saturday and Sunday at H p.m. in Dinkelspicl
Auditorium will feature both magic and comedy. Guest ap
pearances by faculty here and the staff of the Children's Hospi
tal will highlight this year's evening of illusion. Tickets are $ Â»
general admission and $2 for students, and are obtainable at
Tresidder Union box office.
