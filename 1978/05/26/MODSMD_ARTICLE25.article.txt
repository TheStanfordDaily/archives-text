# Weekend crowds fill parks, roads
## 
### Associated Press 
Californians by the* millions head for the
road this weekend for the first big bash of
summer — a Memorial Day holiday
plagued by full campgrounds and higher
gasoline prices.
"It appears that Californians are getting
an even earlier start than normal this
year," said California Highway Patrol Sgt.
Chuck Brady. "They've started already
and, by Friday night, we anticipate the traf
fic jams will be incredible."
Motorists c logging the highways will find
gasoline prices generally 2Vi to \ cents
higher than last year.
The California State Automobile Associ
ation said prices will be highest in the
Sierra Nevada resort areas and lowest in
the Southern California and San Francisco
Bay areas.
Heavy rains
last winter's heavy rains and
snowstorms have left hundreds of*
campgrounds closed, depleting the
number of campsites and facilities availa
ble.
People flocking to the Sierra Nevada's
national parks over the Memorial
may find no place to stay unless they've

already staked out a campsite or reserved a
room.
The Memorial weekend is always one of
the season's busiest at Yosemite and Kings
Canyon-Sequoia parks in the central Sierra
as thousands head to the hills to relax
among the trees.
Campsites that are open at Yosemite
have been filled all week, officials say. The
open campgrounds at Wawona, Yosemite
Valley and Hodgdon Meadow have 1200
sites, about half the park's total.
Buried under snow
The rest, at higher elevations, remain
buried under three to 14 feet of snow, said
Park Superintendent Les Arnberger.
"We strongly urge people to have an
alternate destination in mind," suggested
Arnberger.
State park officials said the best areas for
camping would be in the deserts and
Central California redwood and beat h
areas, but only early arrivals can expect to
find space.
All major highways will be open, the pat
rol said, but some mountain roads washed
out by the heavy rains are still closed.
The torrential rains that ended the two

year drought also spawned heavy hillside
vegetation and Southern California is fat
ing the worst fire conditions in 15 years,
said Warren Hollister, president of the Los
Angeles City Board of Public Works.
"The rains have produced more brush
than usual and one or two dry, windy days
will turn it into tinder," said Hollister.
Park officials throughout the state said
virtually all open fires will be banned he
cause of the abnormally heavy brush
growth.
The National Weather Service predicted
fair skies over most of the state through
Monday, with a chance of driz/le in the
extreme northern tier. Temperatures will
range in the 60s and high 70s in most areas.
Ceremonies
In addition to the revelry, traditional
somber ceremonies are scheduled
throughout the state to honor the nation's
war dead. A special Memorial Day prog
ram will be conducted Monday at the huge
Los Angeles National Cemetery in
Westwood, where f>9,(XX) servicemen are
buried.
The Army's Presidio installation in San
Francisco overlooking the Golden Gate
Bridge also planned ( eremonies Monday.
