# Computer graphs easy
## 
### 
Producing high-quality
graphs and special charac
ters is almost as easy as typ
ing the data, thanks to a
computer plotting package
called "Top Drawer."
Unlike other plotting lan
guages at the Campus Facil
ity of the Stanford Center
for Information Processing
(SCIP), Top Drawer doesn't
require the user to write a
program, explained SCIP
consultant, John Sack.
Instead, a few simple
statements will tell the
computer to transform your
raw data into scatterplots,
data points with error bars,
histograms or other graphi
cal displays, according to
the developer of Top
Drawer, Roger Chaffee.
The cost of Top Drawer
plots is minimal, pointed
out Sack, because Top
Drawer can be run in a spe
cial class (Class Q) which
doesn't charge for the first
second of central
processing time.
Also, one of the devices
which draws the plots, the
Versatec plotter, is free until
June 26, reducing the cost of
most plots to less than a
quarter, according to Sack.
The Versatec plotter is in
Pine Hall.


These seven lines of input produce the plot above using the Top
Drawer plotting package.
