## Students abroad find 'roots'

Florence — Studying at an
overseas campus has given
many University under
graduates the opportunity to
explore their Old World herit
age. At the Overseas Center
here, the lure of European
"roots" attrat ts I 1 of the 57
students to aiu estr.il sites from
Sicily to Scandinavia.
Having scant information
seems to pose more of a chal
lenge than an obstacle to lanis
Cenedella, whose only c lue is a
postcard sent to the United
States in 1920. I his tells her the
name of her relatives'
hometown, I onato in northern
Italy.
She hopes the village- priest
will be able to give her more
information when she visits
there next weekend.
Rebecca Pecchenino has
only a name as well. This sum
mer she and her family will

travel north to Pratiglione to
search for distant cousins.
Nora I'iggot has a bit further
to travel, and as little informa
tion. In Limerick, Ireland, she
hopes to find a cousin who al
legedly was a heroic priest
there during World War I.
For some of us the task of
heritage-hunting is not quite
so difficult. I didn't have to
travel far to find family — a
mere hour from Florence by
bus. There in lucca live an
abundance of relatives, who
took me into their home and
made sure I did not go hungry.
Our discussions ranged from
flaxen cloth making and pros
ciutto to Italian politics.
I aura frassinelli spent mid
quarter break with family in Tu
rin. Her 80-year-old cousin
showed her the original home
of her ancestors, Ogliano, a hill
town near Vittorio Veneto.
There, she even discovered a

"Via Frassinelli"!
John McCarrol's relatives liv
ing in Turin took hini north to
their f.imily town of Asti. This
paese is the cradle of the fam
ous and delicious Asti-
Spumante.
But when McCarrol's rela
tives lived there, the main in
dustry was silk manufacturing,
and he ret eived a quick lesson
in the pros and < ons of the silk
business.
Grami lour
Carey Perloff and John
Graves are also being hosted
by a family in Italy. During her
spring break visit to Rome, Per
loff's aunt gave her a grand
tour of the capital city.
Lisa Anderson plans to jour
ney through 112 jords to a Norwe
gian fishing village, Stavanger,
the home of her father's
cousins. As these relatives do
not speak any Inglish and she
speaks no Norwegian, they
should have very interesting
conversations.
Rick Lada will also face a lan
guage barrier when he visits his
un< le and cousins in Warsaw.
However, he knows his last
name is pronounced "Wada,"
and he has a family ring with
the lion crest of his relatives to
prove his Polish descent.
Kevin Cavanaugh spent his
spring break with relatives in
the town of Killarney in
south-west Ireland. This rather
large group of relatives has not
moved far from its original
home, and some still inhabit
the thatched-roof home of
Cavanaugh's great-great
grandparents.
Jenny Francis spent Christ
mas and part of spring break
with her 70-year-old aunt in
Cheltenham, Gloucestershire,
fngland. This very active aunt
and her HO-year-old sister-in
law escorted francis around
Oxford and the surrounding
countryside.
Jane Irwin will visit a cousin
from Berkshire who is a col
onel in the British Army and a
relative who is a member of a
London rock group.
