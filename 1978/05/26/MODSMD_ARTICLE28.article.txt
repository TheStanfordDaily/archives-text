# Peck lines up pro career
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Judging from the strength of his hand
shake, he could have been an arm wrestl
ing champ. However, the hand belongs to
Stanford's All-America golfer Mike Peck,
and the strong grip seems to personify this
senior's dedication to the sport.
Peck's attitude of commitment could
spell the difference between success and
failure on the professional circuit, which
he hopes to join next winter.
Sacrifices by the golfer and those
around him have enabled him to get his
foot in the door of top-level competition.
Sudden by no means, the opportunity has
arisen as Peck grew up with the game.
"My dad was the one who got me started
playing golf when I was about six years old.
He used to take me out on the weekends
and when nobody was on the course I'd
pull out a club and hit a shot here and
there," he explained.
Parental backing served Peck both as
encouragement and instruction during his
game development and plays a crucial role
in financing golf-related expenses.
"From the time I was six to 16 I never
took a lesson. My dad basically taught me
everything I knew up to then and I can't
say enough for how much they (his pa
rents) have done," he said.
"It just helps to know that your parents
are behind you that much — it's a big as
set," he added.
High school victories
Peck's high school achievements in
clude winningthe Missouri Junior Champ
ionships in 1971 and 1972, qualifying for
the U.S. and World Junior Amateurs in his
senior year as well as lettering in basket
ball twice.
After graduation, he had several scho
larships from which to choose. Stanford
offered a tuition scholarship, and in ac
cepting it, Peck became the second Cardi
nal golfer to hail from Prairie Village, Kan
sas. You may have heard of the previous
star — Tom Watson.
College magnified a situation familiar to

most, if not all students — priorities. Seri
ous golf requires hours of practice to ac
quire the consistency which marks good
play, a habit that obviously conflicts with
academics.
"I'm geared to golf and although I'm
trying to do as well as I can in school, my
main priority is golf. So, as a consequence
of that, my schooling suffers a lot," Peck
said.
The intense concentration on golf di
rectly affected his course selections and
class load. Since this collegiate season is a
pivotal stage before the pro tryouts and
requires large amounts of traveling and
practice time, Peck elected to take a light
load this quarter and finish his economics
major next fall.
Social life limited
For a student whose studies are compet
ing for attention with athletics, where
does a social life find room ? At least for this
quarter, it doesn't.
"I consider myself a very social person. I
like to go to parties and so forth. It (com
peting) definitely affects your social life
this quarter, the other quarters not as
much. I sometimes regret it but if I'm
going to make that my career, I'm going to
have to give up a few things," said Peck.
With Stanford's golf teams, the prece
dence Peck gives the sport was nurtured.
As a freshman, he was surprised to qualify
as the fifth man of a highly-rated Stanford
team. For the role they played in further
ing his skills, he credits former coach Bud
Finger and first-year coach Bruce Sum
merhays.
Of Finger, Peck said, "I can't give
enough thanks to him. He did a hell of a lot
for me that I am not sure I deserve." And
he described Summerhaysas a coach who
"treats everybody well — there's not a
person on the team that doesn't like
Bruce."
Finger, who coached Peck for three
years, stated that he "is an outstanding
young player with quite good possibilities.
He certainly has sacrificed enough to put

himself in a position to be a fine player."
To be successful
Finger cited three basic characteristics
as being key to success — dedication, self
determination and confidence. He com
pared Peck to Watson, explaining that
"Tom Watson was in the same position,
with a dedication to achievement, at this
stage in his career."
Summerhays described Peck as a "good
competitor" who does have the ability to
go professional. "He's been superior in
the Pac-8 — an all-Pac-8 competitor for
three years; a determined individual who
will do very well. He's one of the most
consistent players, out practicing all the
time," Summerhays said of the Card's
team captain.
Among his accomplishments during his
career on the Farm, Peck won the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational on the campus
course in 1976, equalling Watson's 212 re
cord forthe three-round tourney, won the
co-championship of the Pacific-8 Southern
Division, placed 22nd in the NCAA and
finished first in the NCAA Driving Champ
ionship last year.
Looking ahead, Peck will tackle the
amateur tournaments again this summer,
graduate at the conclusion of the fall quar
ter, and attend the winter tryout for the
pro circuit.
Under pressure
A major element of the sport encoun
tered at the amateur level, but especially
basic to the professional ranks is pressure.
How would Peck react to stress when he's
playing for a living?
He responds, "Personally, I like pres
sure. I think I respond fairly well, I don't
think it will affect me.
"Coif is not a life and death matter to
me. I care how well I do and I want to win,
but if I don't, I'm not going to go out and
beat my head against a wall because I blew
a tournament — there are too many more
rounds to go to worry about when I'm
going to do badly."

does a social life find room ? At least for this
quarter, it doesn't.
"I consider myself a very social person. I
like to go to parties and so forth. It (com
peting) definitely affects your social life
this quarter, the other quarters not as
much. I sometimes regret it but if I'm
going to make that my career, I'm going to
have to give up a few things," said Peck.
With Stanford's golf teams, the prece
dence Peck gives the sport was nurtured.
As a freshman, he was surprised to qualify
as the fifth man of a highly-rated Stanford
team. For the role they played in further
ing his skills, he credits former coach Bud
Finger and first-year coach Bruce Sum
merhays.
Of Finger, Peck said, "I can't give
enough thanks to him. He did a hell of a lot
for me that I am not sure I deserve." And
he described Summerhaysas a coach who
"treats everybody well — there's not a
person on the team that doesn't like
Bruce."
Finger, who coached Peck for three
years, stated that he "is an outstanding
young player with quite good possibilities.
He certainly has sacrificed enough to put

himself in a position to be a fine player."
To be successful
Finger cited three basic characteristics
as being key to success — dedication, self
determination and confidence. He com
pared Peck to Watson, explaining that
"Tom Watson was in the same position,
with a dedication to achievement, at this
stage in his career."
Summerhays described Peck as a "good
competitor" who does have the ability to
go professional. "He's been superior in
the Pac-8 — an all-Pac-8 competitor for
three years; a determined individual who
will do very well. He's one of the most
consistent players, out practicing all the
time," Summerhays said of the Card's
team captain.
Among his accomplishments during his
career on the Farm, Peck won the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational on the campus
course in 1976, equalling Watson's 212 re
cord forthe three-round tourney, won the
co-championship of the Pacific-8 Southern
Division, placed 22nd in the NCAA and
finished first in the NCAA Driving Champ
ionship last year.
Looking ahead, Peck will tackle the
amateur tournaments again this summer,
graduate at the conclusion of the fall quar
ter, and attend the winter tryout for the
pro circuit.
Under pressure
A major element of the sport encoun
tered at the amateur level, but especially
basic to the professional ranks is pressure.
How would Peck react to stress when he's
playing for a living?
He responds, "Personally, I like pres
sure. I think I respond fairly well, I don't
think it will affect me.
"Coif is not a life and death matter to
me. I care how well I do and I want to win,
but if I don't, I'm not going to go out and
beat my head against a wall because I blew
a tournament — there are too many more
rounds to go to worry about when I'm
going to do badly."
Judging from the strength of his hand
shake, he could have been an arm wrestl
ing champ. However, the hand belongs to
Stanford's All-America golfer Mike Peck,
and the strong grip seems to personify this
senior's dedication to the sport.
Peck's attitude of commitment could
spell the difference between success and
failure on the professional circuit, which
he hopes to join next winter.
Sacrifices by the golfer and those
around him have enabled him to get his
foot in the door of top-level competition.
Sudden by no means, the opportunity has
arisen as Peck grew up with the game.
"My dad was the one who got me started
playing golf when I was about six years old.
He used to take me out on the weekends
and when nobody was on the course I'd
pull out a club and hit a shot here and
there," he explained.
Parental backing served Peck both as
encouragement and instruction during his
game development and plays a crucial role
in financing golf-related expenses.
"From the time I was six to 16 I never
took a lesson. My dad basically taught me
everything I knew up to then and I can't
say enough for how much they (his pa
rents) have done," he said.
"It just helps to know that your parents
are behind you that much — it's a big as
set," he added.
High school victories
Peck's high school achievements in
clude winningthe Missouri Junior Champ
ionships in 1971 and 1972, qualifying for
the U.S. and World Junior Amateurs in his
senior year as well as lettering in basket
ball twice.
After graduation, he had several scho
larships from which to choose. Stanford
offered a tuition scholarship, and in ac
cepting it, Peck became the second Cardi
nal golfer to hail from Prairie Village, Kan
sas. You may have heard of the previous
star — Tom Watson.
College magnified a situation familiar to

most, if not all students — priorities. Seri
ous golf requires hours of practice to ac
quire the consistency which marks good
play, a habit that obviously conflicts with
academics.
"I'm geared to golf and although I'm
trying to do as well as I can in school, my
main priority is golf. So, as a consequence
of that, my schooling suffers a lot," Peck
said.
The intense concentration on golf di
rectly affected his course selections and
class load. Since this collegiate season is a
pivotal stage before the pro tryouts and
requires large amounts of traveling and
practice time, Peck elected to take a light
load this quarter and finish his economics
major next fall.
