of the day for the Cards came at
the fourth singles spot.
Sophomore Peter Rennert who
finished the season with a
phenomenal 19-3 record, was a
decided underdog against
UCLA All-American Bruce
Nichols. However, Rennert
tagged Nichols 6-2, 6-7, 6-4.
Rennert won the first set and
served for the match at 5-4 in
the second set. Nichols broke
back for five-all and the pair
both held serve to six-all. At 4-4
in the tie-breaker Rennert
double-faulted to give Nichols
the set. In the third set Rennert
took advantage of an early ser
vice break to win and give the
Cards the key victory.
McEnroe, Mitchell, Rennert
and Bourne continued to spell
trouble for UCLA. In the three
dual matches played this year
against the Bruins, the quartet

won 16 of the 17 matches
played. They accounted for all
six Stanford points yesterday in
the team finals.
John Austin continued to
have Bill Maze's number. For
the fourth straight time this
season he took care of Maze,
yesterday winning a 6-4, 7-6
decision.
John Rast also continued to
have problems. Rast was on the
short end of a tough three set
match. After getting blitzed in
the first set 6-1, Rast came back
to win the second set 6-4, but
dropped the third by the same
6-4 score.
Leading 4-2 going into the
doubles is all a team needs
when it has a doubles team like
McEnroe and Mitchell. They
easily won the first set against
Teltscher and Austin, 6-1.
However, in the second set
they fell behind on an early

service break, but fought back
to even things up and wound
up winning the second-set
tiebreaker 5-3. The win
clinched the team champion
ship for the Cards.
After the match was decided
Bourne and Rennert defeated
Graham and Paley 6-3, 1-6, 6-4
and Buehning and Nichols
downed Maze and Rast 7-5,7-5,
but that was all academic.
Victory was not as sweet the
second time around, though.
The emotion of winning the
title was much greater last year.
"Last year it was a much bet
terfeeling," said Mitchell. "We
were seeded three last year
and we beat the top two teams
on back to back days to win the
championship. This year we
were undefeated and ranked
No. 1. I think everybody ex
pected us to win, even ourse
lves. "

The individual tournament
starts today. As expected,
McEnroe is top-seeded in sing
les and in doubles where he
will team with Maze. Mitchell,
who had those distinctions last
year, is seeded 10th in singles
and second in doubles with
partner Perry Wright. Maze is
seeded ninth in singles. Two
singles matches and one dou
bles match will be played to
day. The feature match of the
day will probably be Mitchell
against unseeded Larry
Gottfried of Trinity in the sec
ond round.

but that was all academic.
Victory was not as sweet the
second time around, though.
The emotion of winning the
title was much greater last year.
"Last year it was a much bet
terfeeling," said Mitchell. "We
were seeded three last year
and we beat the top two teams
on back to back days to win the
championship. This year we
were undefeated and ranked
No. 1. I think everybody ex
pected us to win, even ourse
lves. "

The individual tournament
starts today. As expected,
McEnroe is top-seeded in sing
les and in doubles where he
will team with Maze. Mitchell,
who had those distinctions last
year, is seeded 10th in singles
and second in doubles with
partner Perry Wright. Maze is
seeded ninth in singles. Two
singles matches and one dou
bles match will be played to
day. The feature match of the
day will probably be Mitchell
against unseeded Larry
Gottfried of Trinity in the sec
ond round.

of the day for the Cards came at
the fourth singles spot.
Sophomore Peter Rennert who
finished the season with a
phenomenal 19-3 record, was a
decided underdog against
UCLA All-American Bruce
Nichols. However, Rennert
tagged Nichols 6-2, 6-7, 6-4.
Rennert won the first set and
served for the match at 5-4 in
the second set. Nichols broke
back for five-all and the pair
both held serve to six-all. At 4-4
in the tie-breaker Rennert
double-faulted to give Nichols
the set. In the third set Rennert
took advantage of an early ser
vice break to win and give the
Cards the key victory.
McEnroe, Mitchell, Rennert
and Bourne continued to spell
trouble for UCLA. In the three
dual matches played this year
against the Bruins, the quartet

won 16 of the 17 matches
played. They accounted for all
six Stanford points yesterday in
the team finals.
John Austin continued to
have Bill Maze's number. For
the fourth straight time this
season he took care of Maze,
yesterday winning a 6-4, 7-6
decision.
John Rast also continued to
have problems. Rast was on the
short end of a tough three set
match. After getting blitzed in
the first set 6-1, Rast came back
to win the second set 6-4, but
dropped the third by the same
6-4 score.
Leading 4-2 going into the
doubles is all a team needs
when it has a doubles team like
McEnroe and Mitchell. They
easily won the first set against
Teltscher and Austin, 6-1.
However, in the second set
they fell behind on an early

service break, but fought back
to even things up and wound
up winning the second-set
tiebreaker 5-3. The win
clinched the team champion
ship for the Cards.
After the match was decided
Bourne and Rennert defeated
Graham and Paley 6-3, 1-6, 6-4
and Buehning and Nichols
downed Maze and Rast 7-5,7-5,
but that was all academic.
