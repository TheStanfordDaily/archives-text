# Faculty Senate approves Western Culture pilot try
## 
### Peter Brett 
The Faculty Senate voted almost
unanimously yesterday to institute a
pilot program to permit the de
velopment of a limited number of
three-quarter course sequences
which may satisfy a Western Culture
requirement.
The pilot program will be super
vised by a Western Culture Pilot
Program Committee, which will re
port to the Faculty Senate at the end
of the two year trial period on both
the academic quality and financial
feasibility of the requirement.
Students will be able to take the
trial courses, participating in the
program on a voluntary basis for the
next two years.
Courses suggested as part of the
program include the History 1, 2, 3
sequence, the Humanities 60 series
and the Structured Liberal Education
(SLE) program.
Other proposed sequences are
expected to come from other de
partments.
The materials to be used in the
courses will include history from an
cient to modern times, although
there may be variations in emphasis
on particular periods.
However several professors said
they felt this aspect would tend to
restrict the number of forthcoming

sequence proposals.
If the requirement is eventually in
stituted in its final form, the senate
will give it a mandate for a period of
three years, during which time the
courses will be evaluated.
There will be no more than six
major sequences satisfying the re
quirement.
During the discussion, Assistant
History Prof. Carolyn Lougee wanted
to amend this requirement so that
only three out of four historical
periods would need to be covered by
a sequence. She said she felt that the
History 1, 2, 3 sequence would be
ineligible for the pilot program if its
curriculum were altered to include
the ancient period as well as the
medieval, early modern and modern
periods.
Furthermore, according to
Lougee, "a course that dealt with the
culture of Europe since the medieval
period would necessarily look at the

ancient period too."
However, Associate Political Sci
ence Prof. David Abernethy said, "I
find it difficult to start the study of
Western Culture with the medieval
period."
Abernethy added he would like to
see more emphasis placed on the an
cient period than the others, to avoid
excluding the Jewish and Classical
roots of Western Culture.
According to Associate English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz, the Faculty
Senate resolution means that the
proposed courses will have small
group instruction for a minimum of
two hours each week. The small
groups will attempt to elicit the active
intellectual involvement of the stu
dents with primary source works.
However, Rebholz said he is con
cerned that there will be insufficient
funds to hire enough regular faculty
members or Ph.D. instructors.
