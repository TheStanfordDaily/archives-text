# S-crew-U is a tight club
## 
### John Foster 
The word "screw" can have
many different meanings to
many different people. To
some 50 Stanford men and
women athletes the word
"screw" represents their row
ing club — the Stanford crew.
Surely, "screw" is a funny
title for a rowing team, but it is
also an appropriate one. Being
a member of the Stanford crew
team involves satisfaction,
courage, relentlessness,
energy and hard work.
At 5 a.m. Monday through
Friday each member of the
Stanford crew team either
bikes or drives down to the
Redwood City harbor to work
out. They unload their four and
eight man boats (called shells)
into the water, and they row,
and row, and row — for two
hours. After working out they
put the shells back into the
Redwood City boat house, and
they return to campus and
classes.
Craziness you say? Yes,
some people call it craziness,
but other people call it dedica
tion, or satisfaction or some
thing like that. Whatever you
call it, there are roughly 50 men
and women on campus that do
it every day throughout the
year.
One women's team member
noted that "Crew (rowing) is
fun because it is both a physical
and aesthetic sport. You not
only get excellent exercise in
rowing, but you get to watch
some pretty amazing sunrises
and scenery also."
According to crew coaches
each member of the team
learns to develop a sense of
dedication, competitiveness,
confidence, and the ability to
' work and laugh with others.
Strong legs
Besides this, women's coach
Bif Brisbin said that crew is a
sport that involves "total body
movement . . . you use more
calories per minute in crew
than possibly any other sport.

The leg and the back muscles
are really important in row
ing."
The legs must be important
in crew because besides going
out to the harbor every morn
ing at 5 a.m., the team also
does road work twice a week.
And when they are not doing
road work, they are running
the stadium stairs.
What does all this work
amount to?
At the most it amounts to two
races per week during Spring
quarter. Each race covers 2000
meters, and lasts approxi
mately seven minutes. It takes
a lot of work to establish what
one oarsman called "the per
fect blend of strength and en
durance."
According to one woman
crew member "it's exhilarating
. . • it's probably the closest
one can come to working as
both an individual and a team.
You're both alone and to
gether with everyone else in
perfect rhythm when you're in
that boat. It is also fun because
the races take place in really
nice harbors or reservoirs."
Being on the Stanford crew
team also enables one to travel
to such places as San Diego,
Oregon and Los Angeles. Bar
becues are sponsored by the
team before every race, and
parties are sometimes thrown
afterward at the boathouse.
When the men's crew team
loses a race it is traditional for
them to give their jerseysto the
winning team. The oarsmen of
the losing craft are charged half
price for each of their shirts.
Thus, team members have a
real stake in every race that
they enter. The women's team
does not follow this tradition.
T-shirts are symbol
According to the crew
coaches, "As a reward at the
end of the season we give each
member of the club a "S
-crew-U" (standing for Stanford
University Crew) t-shirt. We
never sell or trade these shirts

and they go only to crew mem
bers. It's a symbol of their de
dication to the team."
Because Stanford crew is a
club instead of a varsity sport it
makes it easier to be a more
social sport. Said one crew
member, "The idea of a crew
club is a good one because it
makes it all ours. Then we can
limit the size of our program,
and develop more camaraderie
among the members."
Added another, "There is
less social status and pressure
attached to rowing at a place
like Stanford. Harvard for in
stance actively recruits the best
oarsmen."
Being a club sport may be
important, but not being a var
sity sport affects crew finan
cially.
People in crew have to put
much more time into the actual
administration of the sport. For
example, Jed Corlin, the cap
tain of the mens team this year
and the recipient of the Most
Valuable Oarsman award, was
responsible for promotion, fi
nances, alumni correspon
dence, arranging trips and
other administrative duties.
In addition to this, each team
member is responsible for re
cruiting. The recruiting is gen
erally done by word of mouth,
although some letters are sent
out to prospective oarsmen.
Enthusiasm required
According to next year's
womens captain Riki Lofquist,
"We are not looking for
superstars . . . we are looking
for enthusiastic people and
they don't need any experi
ence. We can teach them ev
erything."
There is little doubt that crew
will be expanding next year.
They have already considered
taking a team to the head of the
Saint Charles River (East Coast)
in the fall. And while they may
be moving from their current
boathouse in Redwood City,
they will be adding more boats
to the program.

Despite some lack in num
bers the men and women crew
teams have done very well this
year. They have beaten high
caliber teams like USC, Santa
Clara, Humbolt and Irvine in
head to head competition.
There is a financial problem
though, and crew members
continue to sell frisbees, work
at the Tresidder Christmas
Faire, and ask for donations to
get funding.
Even though they operate
under the same budget, the
men and women crew teams
work out separately. The only
women that are on the men's
team are the cockswain, the
people that yell "stroke,
stroke, stroke . . . ." Women
are usually used for these posi
tions because the weight limit
is 120 lbs. and it is hard to find
men that only weigh 120 lbs.
Cockswain important
Two of the women that were
cockswains this year lost their
voices by yelling in that crisp
morning air. According to crew
coaches it is difficult to lose a
good cockswain because "they
are the quarterback for the
boat . . . they determine the
pace and the strategy for the
oarsmen. They also steer the
boat, and a good cockswain
can steer the boat right into a
national championship."
The only problem crew ap
pears to be having now is that
once they get a person to come

out for the team it is difficult to
keep them out. "Many people
come out for one year, and
then go to an overseas campus
or develop other commit
ments," said the coach. Since
the best crew teams are those
with the most experienced
oarsmen this is a trend that
"Screw" does not like to see.
Said one oarsman, "Except
for recruiting our only regret is
having to compete with morn

ing sailors or fishermen who
scream "row, row, row your
boat," or "stroke, stroke,
stroke, don't choke."
Despite stray sailors and
fishermen, the Stanford crew
team expects to be much big
ger and better next year.
"This year was a building
year. Next year the men and
women could integrate work
outs more. Nextyearshould be

really exciting," said coach
Brisbin.
The best crew teams are
those with enthusiasm, dedica
tion, and experience and Stan
ford already has an enthusias
tic and dedicated club. What
they need now are people who
are willing to become experi
enced — and for the sailors to
worry about rowing their own
boats.

pears to be having now is that
once they get a person to come

out for the team it is difficult to
keep them out. "Many people
come out for one year, and
then go to an overseas campus
or develop other commit
ments," said the coach. Since
the best crew teams are those
with the most experienced
oarsmen this is a trend that
"Screw" does not like to see.
Said one oarsman, "Except
for recruiting our only regret is
having to compete with morn

ing sailors or fishermen who
scream "row, row, row your
boat," or "stroke, stroke,
stroke, don't choke."
Despite stray sailors and
fishermen, the Stanford crew
team expects to be much big
ger and better next year.
"This year was a building
year. Next year the men and
women could integrate work
outs more. Nextyearshould be

really exciting," said coach
Brisbin.
The best crew teams are
those with enthusiasm, dedica
tion, and experience and Stan
ford already has an enthusias
tic and dedicated club. What
they need now are people who
are willing to become experi
enced — and for the sailors to
worry about rowing their own
boats.

he Stanford crew team catches a lot of sunrises as they're out on the men's and women's squad, competes against some of the top crew
water by 6 a.m. almost every morning. The club sport that has both a teams in the nation.
The word "screw" can have
many different meanings to
many different people. To
some 50 Stanford men and
women athletes the word
"screw" represents their row
ing club — the Stanford crew.
Surely, "screw" is a funny
title for a rowing team, but it is
also an appropriate one. Being
a member of the Stanford crew
team involves satisfaction,
courage, relentlessness,
energy and hard work.
At 5 a.m. Monday through
Friday each member of the
Stanford crew team either
bikes or drives down to the
Redwood City harbor to work
out. They unload their four and
eight man boats (called shells)
into the water, and they row,
and row, and row — for two
hours. After working out they
put the shells back into the
Redwood City boat house, and
they return to campus and
classes.
Craziness you say? Yes,
some people call it craziness,
but other people call it dedica
tion, or satisfaction or some
thing like that. Whatever you
call it, there are roughly 50 men
and women on campus that do
it every day throughout the
year.
One women's team member
noted that "Crew (rowing) is
fun because it is both a physical
and aesthetic sport. You not
only get excellent exercise in
rowing, but you get to watch
some pretty amazing sunrises
and scenery also."
According to crew coaches
each member of the team
learns to develop a sense of
dedication, competitiveness,
confidence, and the ability to
' work and laugh with others.
Strong legs
Besides this, women's coach
Bif Brisbin said that crew is a
sport that involves "total body
movement . . . you use more
calories per minute in crew
than possibly any other sport.

The leg and the back muscles
are really important in row
ing."
The legs must be important
in crew because besides going
out to the harbor every morn
ing at 5 a.m., the team also
does road work twice a week.
And when they are not doing
road work, they are running
the stadium stairs.
What does all this work
amount to?
At the most it amounts to two
races per week during Spring
quarter. Each race covers 2000
meters, and lasts approxi
mately seven minutes. It takes
a lot of work to establish what
one oarsman called "the per
fect blend of strength and en
durance."
According to one woman
crew member "it's exhilarating
. . • it's probably the closest
one can come to working as
both an individual and a team.
You're both alone and to
gether with everyone else in
perfect rhythm when you're in
that boat. It is also fun because
the races take place in really
nice harbors or reservoirs."
Being on the Stanford crew
team also enables one to travel
to such places as San Diego,
Oregon and Los Angeles. Bar
becues are sponsored by the
team before every race, and
parties are sometimes thrown
afterward at the boathouse.
When the men's crew team
loses a race it is traditional for
them to give their jerseysto the
winning team. The oarsmen of
the losing craft are charged half
price for each of their shirts.
Thus, team members have a
real stake in every race that
they enter. The women's team
does not follow this tradition.
T-shirts are symbol
According to the crew
coaches, "As a reward at the
end of the season we give each
member of the club a "S
-crew-U" (standing for Stanford
University Crew) t-shirt. We
never sell or trade these shirts

and they go only to crew mem
bers. It's a symbol of their de
dication to the team."
Because Stanford crew is a
club instead of a varsity sport it
makes it easier to be a more
social sport. Said one crew
member, "The idea of a crew
club is a good one because it
makes it all ours. Then we can
limit the size of our program,
and develop more camaraderie
among the members."
Added another, "There is
less social status and pressure
attached to rowing at a place
like Stanford. Harvard for in
stance actively recruits the best
oarsmen."
Being a club sport may be
important, but not being a var
sity sport affects crew finan
cially.
People in crew have to put
much more time into the actual
administration of the sport. For
example, Jed Corlin, the cap
tain of the mens team this year
and the recipient of the Most
Valuable Oarsman award, was
responsible for promotion, fi
nances, alumni correspon
dence, arranging trips and
other administrative duties.
In addition to this, each team
member is responsible for re
cruiting. The recruiting is gen
erally done by word of mouth,
although some letters are sent
out to prospective oarsmen.
Enthusiasm required
According to next year's
womens captain Riki Lofquist,
"We are not looking for
superstars . . . we are looking
for enthusiastic people and
they don't need any experi
ence. We can teach them ev
erything."
There is little doubt that crew
will be expanding next year.
They have already considered
taking a team to the head of the
Saint Charles River (East Coast)
in the fall. And while they may
be moving from their current
boathouse in Redwood City,
they will be adding more boats
to the program.

Despite some lack in num
bers the men and women crew
teams have done very well this
year. They have beaten high
caliber teams like USC, Santa
Clara, Humbolt and Irvine in
head to head competition.
There is a financial problem
though, and crew members
continue to sell frisbees, work
at the Tresidder Christmas
Faire, and ask for donations to
get funding.
Even though they operate
under the same budget, the
men and women crew teams
work out separately. The only
women that are on the men's
team are the cockswain, the
people that yell "stroke,
stroke, stroke . . . ." Women
are usually used for these posi
tions because the weight limit
is 120 lbs. and it is hard to find
men that only weigh 120 lbs.
Cockswain important
Two of the women that were
cockswains this year lost their
voices by yelling in that crisp
morning air. According to crew
coaches it is difficult to lose a
good cockswain because "they
are the quarterback for the
boat . . . they determine the
pace and the strategy for the
oarsmen. They also steer the
boat, and a good cockswain
can steer the boat right into a
national championship."
The only problem crew ap
pears to be having now is that
once they get a person to come

out for the team it is difficult to
keep them out. "Many people

taking a team to the head of the
Saint Charles River (East Coast)
in the fall. And while they may
be moving from their current
boathouse in Redwood City,
they will be adding more boats
to the program.

Despite some lack in num
bers the men and women crew
teams have done very well this
year. They have beaten high
caliber teams like USC, Santa
Clara, Humbolt and Irvine in
head to head competition.
There is a financial problem
though, and crew members
continue to sell frisbees, work
at the Tresidder Christmas
Faire, and ask for donations to
get funding.
Even though they operate
under the same budget, the
men and women crew teams
work out separately. The only
women that are on the men's
team are the cockswain, the
people that yell "stroke,
stroke, stroke . . . ." Women
are usually used for these posi
tions because the weight limit
is 120 lbs. and it is hard to find
men that only weigh 120 lbs.
Cockswain important
Two of the women that were
cockswains this year lost their
voices by yelling in that crisp
morning air. According to crew
coaches it is difficult to lose a
good cockswain because "they
are the quarterback for the
boat . . . they determine the
pace and the strategy for the
oarsmen. They also steer the
boat, and a good cockswain
can steer the boat right into a
national championship."
The only problem crew ap
pears to be having now is that
once they get a person to come

out for the team it is difficult to
keep them out. "Many people
come out for one year, and
then go to an overseas campus
or develop other commit
ments," said the coach. Since
the best crew teams are those
with the most experienced
oarsmen this is a trend that
"Screw" does not like to see.
Said one oarsman, "Except
for recruiting our only regret is
having to compete with morn

ing sailors or fishermen who
scream "row, row, row your
boat," or "stroke, stroke,
stroke, don't choke."
Despite stray sailors and
fishermen, the Stanford crew
team expects to be much big
ger and better next year.
"This year was a building
year. Next year the men and
women could integrate work
outs more. Nextyearshould be

really exciting," said coach
Brisbin.
The best crew teams are
those with enthusiasm, dedica
tion, and experience and Stan
ford already has an enthusias
tic and dedicated club. What
they need now are people who
are willing to become experi
enced — and for the sailors to
worry about rowing their own
boats.

he Stanford crew team catches a lot of sunrises as they're out on the men's and women's squad, competes against some of the top crew
water by 6 a.m. almost every morning. The club sport that has both a teams in the nation.
The word "screw" can have
many different meanings to
many different people. To
some 50 Stanford men and
women athletes the word
"screw" represents their row
ing club — the Stanford crew.
Surely, "screw" is a funny
title for a rowing team, but it is
also an appropriate one. Being
a member of the Stanford crew
team involves satisfaction,
courage, relentlessness,
energy and hard work.
At 5 a.m. Monday through
Friday each member of the
Stanford crew team either
bikes or drives down to the
Redwood City harbor to work
out. They unload their four and
eight man boats (called shells)
into the water, and they row,
and row, and row — for two
hours. After working out they
put the shells back into the
Redwood City boat house, and
they return to campus and
classes.
Craziness you say? Yes,
some people call it craziness,
but other people call it dedica
tion, or satisfaction or some
thing like that. Whatever you
call it, there are roughly 50 men
and women on campus that do
it every day throughout the
year.
One women's team member
noted that "Crew (rowing) is
fun because it is both a physical
and aesthetic sport. You not
only get excellent exercise in
rowing, but you get to watch
some pretty amazing sunrises
and scenery also."
According to crew coaches
each member of the team
learns to develop a sense of
dedication, competitiveness,
confidence, and the ability to
' work and laugh with others.
Strong legs
Besides this, women's coach
Bif Brisbin said that crew is a
sport that involves "total body
movement . . . you use more
calories per minute in crew
than possibly any other sport.

The leg and the back muscles
are really important in row
ing."
The legs must be important
in crew because besides going
out to the harbor every morn
ing at 5 a.m., the team also
does road work twice a week.
And when they are not doing
road work, they are running
the stadium stairs.
What does all this work
amount to?
At the most it amounts to two
races per week during Spring
quarter. Each race covers 2000
meters, and lasts approxi
mately seven minutes. It takes
a lot of work to establish what
one oarsman called "the per
fect blend of strength and en
durance."
According to one woman
crew member "it's exhilarating
. . • it's probably the closest
one can come to working as
both an individual and a team.
You're both alone and to
gether with everyone else in
perfect rhythm when you're in
that boat. It is also fun because
the races take place in really
nice harbors or reservoirs."
Being on the Stanford crew
team also enables one to travel
to such places as San Diego,
Oregon and Los Angeles. Bar
becues are sponsored by the
team before every race, and
parties are sometimes thrown
afterward at the boathouse.
When the men's crew team
loses a race it is traditional for
them to give their jerseysto the
winning team. The oarsmen of
the losing craft are charged half
price for each of their shirts.
Thus, team members have a
real stake in every race that
they enter. The women's team
does not follow this tradition.
T-shirts are symbol
According to the crew
coaches, "As a reward at the
end of the season we give each
member of the club a "S
-crew-U" (standing for Stanford
University Crew) t-shirt. We
never sell or trade these shirts

and they go only to crew mem
bers. It's a symbol of their de
dication to the team."
Because Stanford crew is a
club instead of a varsity sport it
makes it easier to be a more
social sport. Said one crew
member, "The idea of a crew
club is a good one because it
makes it all ours. Then we can
limit the size of our program,
and develop more camaraderie
among the members."
Added another, "There is
less social status and pressure
attached to rowing at a place
like Stanford. Harvard for in
stance actively recruits the best
oarsmen."
Being a club sport may be
important, but not being a var
sity sport affects crew finan
cially.
People in crew have to put
much more time into the actual
administration of the sport. For
example, Jed Corlin, the cap
tain of the mens team this year
and the recipient of the Most
Valuable Oarsman award, was
responsible for promotion, fi
nances, alumni correspon
dence, arranging trips and
other administrative duties.
In addition to this, each team
member is responsible for re
cruiting. The recruiting is gen
erally done by word of mouth,
although some letters are sent
out to prospective oarsmen.
Enthusiasm required
According to next year's
womens captain Riki Lofquist,
"We are not looking for
superstars . . . we are looking
for enthusiastic people and
they don't need any experi
ence. We can teach them ev
erything."
There is little doubt that crew
will be expanding next year.
They have already considered
taking a team to the head of the
Saint Charles River (East Coast)
in the fall. And while they may
be moving from their current
boathouse in Redwood City,
they will be adding more boats
to the program.

Despite some lack in num
bers the men and women crew
teams have done very well this
year. They have beaten high
caliber teams like USC, Santa
Clara, Humbolt and Irvine in
head to head competition.
There is a financial problem
though, and crew members
continue to sell frisbees, work
at the Tresidder Christmas
Faire, and ask for donations to
get funding.
Even though they operate
under the same budget, the
men and women crew teams

women that are on the men's
team are the cockswain, the
people that yell "stroke,
