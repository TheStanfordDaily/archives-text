Arms talks open amid tension
New York — The United States and th(
Soviet Union opened a new and possibl)
climactic round of negotiations on weapon:
limits yesterday against a backdrop of strainec
relations between the two superpowers.
"The level of tension is fairly high," said .
senior U.S. official before Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance met for nearly two hours at tht
Soviet U.N. mission with Foreign Minister An
drei Cromyko.
Vance told reporters in a brief sidewalk new
conference afterward that it was "too early tc
say" if there was progress.
Vance confirmed President Jimmy Carte
will enter the talks Saturday in Washington
seeing Gromyko at the White House.
Another likely topic of discussion there i:
U.S. displeasure with Soviet and Cuban activ
ity in Africa.
Asked to assess prospects for moving to
ward a new treaty limiting long-range bombers
and intercontinental ballistic missiles, Vance
said: "We haven't had enough time to talk."
The talks move to Washington today.
What the Carter administration regards as
Soviet and Cuban adventurism in Africa has
clouded prospects for a weapons limitation
treaty by the end of the year.
On top of that there has been an unpre
cedented Soviet strategic buildup in Europe
which was condemned by Vice President Wal
ter Mondale in a policy speech to the U.N.
special disarmament conference.
Specifically, he deplored the deployment of
the SS-20, a new, mobile intermediate range
missile that Mondale said menaces civilian as
well as military targets.
Ford: tougher SALT stand
Washington — Former President Gerald Ford
said yesterday that if the Soviet Union persists
in African adventurism, the United States may
have to retaliate by refusing to conclude a new
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty with Moscow.
Ford said the issues are interrelated, and that
he would not preclude the use of the SALT
talks as a method of putting pressure on the
Russians.
"I think the Soviet Union does want a SALT II
agreement," he told a news conference. "I
think the administration has to take a harder
line than they have been, and if the Soviet
Union is going to persist in the adventurism
they are undertaking with the Cubans in Af
rica, as they are, we may well have to say to the
Soviet Union 'SALT II is not a possibility.' "
Ford said he agrees with President Jimmy
Carter that Congress should give the White
House a freer hand to deal with situations like
the one in Angola, where guerrillas are trying
to oust a Marxist government supported by
Cuban troops and Russian arms.
Zairian soldiers saved whites
Kinshasa, Zaire — An American who survived
a week of terror in Kolwezi, Zaire, says he and
more than a dozen other whites owe their lives
to Zairian soldiers who convinced a mob to
spare some of the captives.
Rick Black, 42, a Zambia resident originally
from Los Angeles, said he, his girlfriend Jenny,
and other whites were saved by a contingent of
captured Zairian soldiers who had spent sev
eral days with them in a Kolwezi police station.
Black told his story Wednesday at Kinshasa
airport, before he boarded an airplane leaving

the country — one of hundreds of Europeans
and Americans rescued by French and Belgian
soldiers after being caught in an attack by
Katanganese rebels against Zaire's mineral
rich Shaba province.
Black said the Zairians performed the rescue
on May 17, when a mob stormed the police
station in apparent anger over the arrival of
French paratroopers.
Black said the Zairian soldiers donned civi
lian clothes and convinced the mob to leave.
French paratroopers freed the group.
Tokyo airport site of bombing
Tokyo — Several masked men firebombed a
Korean Air Lines employee dormitory near To
kyo's new international airport yesterday in
what was apparently the latest attack by radi
cals who want to shut down the airport.
No injuries were reported and the damage
was minor and limited to an unoccupied
ground-floor room in the six-story building.
The airport opened officially last weekend
after years of delay caused by protests and
hit-run attacks by radical opponents. A Korean
Air Lines flight was the first to take off from
Narita after the opening.
The opposition comes from farmers who did
not want to give up their land for the giant $1
billion facility, from environmentalists fearing
noise pollution and possible dangers from the
transport of aircraft fuel, and from radicals
who seized on the airport as an anti
government issue.
Iranian gov't takes firm stand
Tehran, Iran — Iranian dissidents can de
monstrate all they want against the Shah, says
Prime Minister Jamshid Amouzegar, but "if
they want to start a riot... we will act and act
strongly." He blamed recent bloody distur
bances on international terrorists using "the
cloak of religion."
In an interview with The Associated Press,
the Iranian government chief also said oil
prices will probably hold steady this year and
Iran favors "sticking with the U.S. dollar" as
the basis for the oil trade. But he said
Washington must reduce its $60-billion budget
deficit.
Five months of anti-government rioting and
street battles with security forces in Iranian
cities have claimed about 40 lives and caused
widespread destruction.
The protests are led by orthodox Moslems
opposed to Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's
policies of modernizing this old Islamic soci
ety, but they are believed to have at least moral
support from dissidents who demand a
liberalization of the Shah's one-party political
system.
Amouzegar said the government has
opened a dialogue with religious leaders to try
to eliminate "misunderstanding" and per
suade them not to "fall for false propaganda."
State budget surplus grows
Sacramento — California's estimated state
budget surplus has grown by $419 million since
January, and now stands at a record $3.63 bill
ion, state Finance Director Roy Bell said yes
terday.
Bell said California businesses had bigger
profits than expected, boosting corporate in
come tax receipts, and the total personal in
come of private citizens is slightly higher than
estimated in January.

He also said state costs in education and
health care fell short of earlier estimates.
The surplus is equal to 21 per cent of Gov.
Edmund Brown's proposed $17.4 billion
budget. Bell said the state needs to hold in
reserve only about 2Va per cent, or $400 mill
ion, as a "prudent surplus" to meet unex
pected emergencies.
Bell said the bigger surplus gives the state
slightly more leeway in meeting needs of local
government if Proposition 13, the Howard Jar
vis property tax cut initiative, is approved by
voters on June 6.
But Bell, who is Brown's chief fiscal adviser,
said the $7 billion annual cut which would be
ordered by Proposition 13 is so big that it
dwarfs the state surplus.
Bid for execution delay denied
Washington — A Georgia death row inmate
scheduled to die in the electric chair today was
denied an execution postponement by the
Supreme Court yesterday.
His attorney was said to be trying through a
Georgia court to get the execution delayed.
Unless Ronald Douthit's lawyer takes quick
and successful action before 10 a.m. today,
Douthit will become the second prisoner exe
cuted in the United States since 1967.
He is scheduled to die in the electric chair in
Georgia sometime between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
today.
Voting 7-2, the nation's highest court turned
down a request by Douthit's lawyer, Eugene
Deal of Atlanta, that it postpone the execution
until a formal appeal could be filed with it. -
Justices William Brennan Jr. and Thurgood
Marshall, who oppose capital punishment
under any circumstances, voted to block
Douthit's execution.
D.A. fights minority hiring act
Sacramento — A district attorney challenging
a requirement to hire minority lawyers said
yesterday he's uncertain whether the state
Supreme Court will make a landmark ruling in
the case.
"Whether this turns out to be a landmark
bigger than Bakke I couldn't tell you," said
Sacramento County District Attorney John
Price, who filed the 1975 suit against the
County Civil Service Commission.
A week ago the state Supreme Court agreed
to hear the Civil Service Commission's appeal
of Price's case. For the time being, the court's
action nullifies the Jan. 30 decision by the state
appeals court in Sacramento upholding Price's
position.
The appeals court ruled the commission had
overstepped the federal Civil Rights Act's ob
jective of removing artificial, arbitrary and un
necessary barriers to employment.
Justice Leonard Friedman, supported by the
two other judges on the panel, held that the
quota "establishes a barrier to the employ
ment of majority applicants."
New Jersey casino to open
Trenton, N.J. — The nation's only legal
gambling casino outside Nevada won state ap
proval last night — and planned an opening
today — when the New Jersey Casino Control
Commission voted 5-0 to issue an operating
permit.
After an 11-hour discussion, and after
months of writing regulations on everything
from blackjack to showgirls' pasties, the com

mission decided Resorts International Hotel
Casino was fit to become the first of many
gambling palaces expected to go up in Atlantic
City.
The casino is the result of a $40 million reno
vation of the former Chalfonte-Haddon Hall
Hotel.
Nixon to host POW reception
Los Angeles — It has been five years since
American prisoners of war returned home
from North Vietnam, and approximately 300
former POWs are gathering here for a big reun
ion this weekend.
Organizers say it will be the largest reunion
of former POWs since former President
Richard Nixon held a reception for them at the
Whiete House in May 1973.
Nixon has invited the POWs down to his San
Clemente estate for a cocktail party Saturday
night, the largest party Nixon has thrown since
leaving the presidency in 1974.
No one knows how many of the former
POWs will visit Nixon, but as former Air Force
flier John Nasmyth said, "I'm sure we're prob
ably the most loyal group to him there is be
cause he got us out."
Newton pleads innocent
Santa Cruz — Black Panther leader Huey
Newton and his body guard Robert )oe Heard
pleaded innocent yesterday to criminal
charges of assault stemming from a bullet
punctuated barroom brawl two weeks ago.
After hearing the pleas, Municipal Court
Judge Richard McAdams set June 2 for a pre
liminary hearing on charges of assault with in
tent to commit murder, assault and being ex
felons in possession of firearms.
McAdams also signed a warrant, over the
objections of defense attorney Floyd Silliman,
authorizing blood samples from each man.
Ralph Boroff, Santa Cruz County deputy dis
trict attorney, would not say specifically why
prosecutors want blood samples, saying the
blood "relates to scientific evidence which we
already have and it would be for the benefit of
everyone."
Newton, 36, is free on $50,000 bail on the
Santa Cruz charges and $155,000 bail in con
nection with his pending trial in Alameda
County on charges of killing a prostitute and
pistol whipping his tailor in 1974. Heard, 29, is
free on $50,000 bail.

Arms talks open amid tension
New York — The United States and th(
Soviet Union opened a new and possibl)
climactic round of negotiations on weapon:
limits yesterday against a backdrop of strainec
relations between the two superpowers.
"The level of tension is fairly high," said .
senior U.S. official before Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance met for nearly two hours at tht
Soviet U.N. mission with Foreign Minister An
drei Cromyko.
Vance told reporters in a brief sidewalk new
conference afterward that it was "too early tc
say" if there was progress.
Vance confirmed President Jimmy Carte
will enter the talks Saturday in Washington
seeing Gromyko at the White House.
Another likely topic of discussion there i:
U.S. displeasure with Soviet and Cuban activ
ity in Africa.
Asked to assess prospects for moving to
ward a new treaty limiting long-range bombers
and intercontinental ballistic missiles, Vance
said: "We haven't had enough time to talk."
The talks move to Washington today.
What the Carter administration regards as
Soviet and Cuban adventurism in Africa has
clouded prospects for a weapons limitation
treaty by the end of the year.
On top of that there has been an unpre
cedented Soviet strategic buildup in Europe
which was condemned by Vice President Wal

special disarmament conference.
Specifically, he deplored the deployment of
the SS-20, a new, mobile intermediate range
missile that Mondale said menaces civilian as

said yesterday that if the Soviet Union persists

he would not preclude the use of the SALT

Zairian soldiers saved whites
Kinshasa, Zaire — An American who survived
a week of terror in Kolwezi, Zaire, says he and
more than a dozen other whites owe their lives
to Zairian soldiers who convinced a mob to
spare some of the captives.
Rick Black, 42, a Zambia resident originally
from Los Angeles, said he, his girlfriend Jenny,
and other whites were saved by a contingent of
captured Zairian soldiers who had spent sev
eral days with them in a Kolwezi police station.
Black told his story Wednesday at Kinshasa
airport, before he boarded an airplane leaving

the country — one of hundreds of Europeans
and Americans rescued by French and Belgian
soldiers after being caught in an attack by
Katanganese rebels against Zaire's mineral
rich Shaba province.
Black said the Zairians performed the rescue
on May 17, when a mob stormed the police
station in apparent anger over the arrival of
French paratroopers.
Black said the Zairian soldiers donned civi
lian clothes and convinced the mob to leave.
French paratroopers freed the group.
Tokyo airport site of bombing
Tokyo — Several masked men firebombed a
Korean Air Lines employee dormitory near To
kyo's new international airport yesterday in
what was apparently the latest attack by radi
cals who want to shut down the airport.
No injuries were reported and the damage
was minor and limited to an unoccupied
ground-floor room in the six-story building.
The airport opened officially last weekend
after years of delay caused by protests and
hit-run attacks by radical opponents. A Korean
Air Lines flight was the first to take off from
Narita after the opening.
The opposition comes from farmers who did
not want to give up their land for the giant $1
billion facility, from environmentalists fearing
noise pollution and possible dangers from the
transport of aircraft fuel, and from radicals
who seized on the airport as an anti
government issue.
Iranian gov't takes firm stand
Tehran, Iran — Iranian dissidents can de
monstrate all they want against the Shah, says
Prime Minister Jamshid Amouzegar, but "if
they want to start a riot... we will act and act
strongly." He blamed recent bloody distur
bances on international terrorists using "the
cloak of religion."
In an interview with The Associated Press,
the Iranian government chief also said oil
prices will probably hold steady this year and
Iran favors "sticking with the U.S. dollar" as
the basis for the oil trade. But he said
Washington must reduce its $60-billion budget
deficit.
Five months of anti-government rioting and
street battles with security forces in Iranian
cities have claimed about 40 lives and caused
widespread destruction.
The protests are led by orthodox Moslems
opposed to Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's
policies of modernizing this old Islamic soci
ety, but they are believed to have at least moral
support from dissidents who demand a
liberalization of the Shah's one-party political
system.
Amouzegar said the government has
opened a dialogue with religious leaders to try
to eliminate "misunderstanding" and per
suade them not to "fall for false propaganda."
State budget surplus grows
Sacramento — California's estimated state
budget surplus has grown by $419 million since
January, and now stands at a record $3.63 bill
ion, state Finance Director Roy Bell said yes
terday.
Bell said California businesses had bigger
profits than expected, boosting corporate in
come tax receipts, and the total personal in
come of private citizens is slightly higher than
estimated in January.

He also said state costs in education and
health care fell short of earlier estimates.
The surplus is equal to 21 per cent of Gov.
Edmund Brown's proposed $17.4 billion
budget. Bell said the state needs to hold in
reserve only about 2Va per cent, or $400 mill
ion, as a "prudent surplus" to meet unex
pected emergencies.
Bell said the bigger surplus gives the state
slightly more leeway in meeting needs of local
government if Proposition 13, the Howard Jar
vis property tax cut initiative, is approved by
voters on June 6.
But Bell, who is Brown's chief fiscal adviser,
said the $7 billion annual cut which would be
ordered by Proposition 13 is so big that it
dwarfs the state surplus.
Bid for execution delay denied
Washington — A Georgia death row inmate
scheduled to die in the electric chair today was
denied an execution postponement by the
Supreme Court yesterday.
His attorney was said to be trying through a
Georgia court to get the execution delayed.
Unless Ronald Douthit's lawyer takes quick
and successful action before 10 a.m. today,
Douthit will become the second prisoner exe
cuted in the United States since 1967.
He is scheduled to die in the electric chair in
Georgia sometime between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
today.
Voting 7-2, the nation's highest court turned
down a request by Douthit's lawyer, Eugene
Deal of Atlanta, that it postpone the execution
until a formal appeal could be filed with it. -
Justices William Brennan Jr. and Thurgood
Marshall, who oppose capital punishment
under any circumstances, voted to block
Douthit's execution.
D.A. fights minority hiring act

what was apparently the latest attack by radi
cals who want to shut down the airport.
No injuries were reported and the damage
was minor and limited to an unoccupied
ground-floor room in the six-story building.
The airport opened officially last weekend
after years of delay caused by protests and
hit-run attacks by radical opponents. A Korean
Air Lines flight was the first to take off from
Narita after the opening.
The opposition comes from farmers who did
not want to give up their land for the giant $1
billion facility, from environmentalists fearing
noise pollution and possible dangers from the
transport of aircraft fuel, and from radicals
who seized on the airport as an anti
government issue.
Iranian gov't takes firm stand
Tehran, Iran — Iranian dissidents can de
monstrate all they want against the Shah, says
Prime Minister Jamshid Amouzegar, but "if
they want to start a riot... we will act and act
strongly." He blamed recent bloody distur
bances on international terrorists using "the
cloak of religion."
In an interview with The Associated Press,
the Iranian government chief also said oil
prices will probably hold steady this year and
Iran favors "sticking with the U.S. dollar" as
the basis for the oil trade. But he said
Washington must reduce its $60-billion budget
deficit.
Five months of anti-government rioting and
street battles with security forces in Iranian
cities have claimed about 40 lives and caused
widespread destruction.
The protests are led by orthodox Moslems
opposed to Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's
policies of modernizing this old Islamic soci
ety, but they are believed to have at least moral
support from dissidents who demand a
liberalization of the Shah's one-party political
system.
Amouzegar said the government has
opened a dialogue with religious leaders to try
to eliminate "misunderstanding" and per
suade them not to "fall for false propaganda."
State budget surplus grows
Sacramento — California's estimated state
budget surplus has grown by $419 million since
January, and now stands at a record $3.63 bill
ion, state Finance Director Roy Bell said yes
terday.
Bell said California businesses had bigger
profits than expected, boosting corporate in
come tax receipts, and the total personal in
come of private citizens is slightly higher than
estimated in January.

He also said state costs in education and
health care fell short of earlier estimates.
The surplus is equal to 21 per cent of Gov.
Edmund Brown's proposed $17.4 billion
budget. Bell said the state needs to hold in
reserve only about 2Va per cent, or $400 mill
ion, as a "prudent surplus" to meet unex
pected emergencies.
Bell said the bigger surplus gives the state
slightly more leeway in meeting needs of local
government if Proposition 13, the Howard Jar
vis property tax cut initiative, is approved by
voters on June 6.
But Bell, who is Brown's chief fiscal adviser,
said the $7 billion annual cut which would be
ordered by Proposition 13 is so big that it
dwarfs the state surplus.
Bid for execution delay denied
Washington — A Georgia death row inmate

Voting 7-2, the nation's highest court turned

D.A. fights minority hiring act
Sacramento — A district attorney challenging
a requirement to hire minority lawyers said
yesterday he's uncertain whether the state
Supreme Court will make a landmark ruling in
the case.
"Whether this turns out to be a landmark

Sacramento County District Attorney John
Price, who filed the 1975 suit against the
County Civil Service Commission.
A week ago the state Supreme Court agreed
to hear the Civil Service Commission's appeal
of Price's case. For the time being, the court's
action nullifies the Jan. 30 decision by the state
appeals court in Sacramento upholding Price's
position.
The appeals court ruled the commission had
overstepped the federal Civil Rights Act's ob
jective of removing artificial, arbitrary and un
necessary barriers to employment.
Justice Leonard Friedman, supported by the
two other judges on the panel, held that the
quota "establishes a barrier to the employ

Arms talks open amid tension
New York — The United States and th(
Soviet Union opened a new and possibl)
climactic round of negotiations on weapon:
limits yesterday against a backdrop of strainec
relations between the two superpowers.
"The level of tension is fairly high," said .
senior U.S. official before Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance met for nearly two hours at tht
Soviet U.N. mission with Foreign Minister An
drei Cromyko.
Vance told reporters in a brief sidewalk new
conference afterward that it was "too early tc
say" if there was progress.
Vance confirmed President Jimmy Carte
will enter the talks Saturday in Washington
seeing Gromyko at the White House.
Another likely topic of discussion there i:
U.S. displeasure with Soviet and Cuban activ
ity in Africa.
Asked to assess prospects for moving to
ward a new treaty limiting long-range bombers
and intercontinental ballistic missiles, Vance
said: "We haven't had enough time to talk."
The talks move to Washington today.
What the Carter administration regards as
Soviet and Cuban adventurism in Africa has
clouded prospects for a weapons limitation
treaty by the end of the year.
On top of that there has been an unpre
cedented Soviet strategic buildup in Europe
which was condemned by Vice President Wal
ter Mondale in a policy speech to the U.N.
special disarmament conference.
Specifically, he deplored the deployment of
the SS-20, a new, mobile intermediate range
missile that Mondale said menaces civilian as
well as military targets.
Ford: tougher SALT stand
Washington — Former President Gerald Ford
said yesterday that if the Soviet Union persists
in African adventurism, the United States may
have to retaliate by refusing to conclude a new
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty with Moscow.
Ford said the issues are interrelated, and that
he would not preclude the use of the SALT
talks as a method of putting pressure on the
Russians.
"I think the Soviet Union does want a SALT II
agreement," he told a news conference. "I
think the administration has to take a harder
line than they have been, and if the Soviet
Union is going to persist in the adventurism
they are undertaking with the Cubans in Af
rica, as they are, we may well have to say to the
Soviet Union 'SALT II is not a possibility.' "
Ford said he agrees with President Jimmy
Carter that Congress should give the White
House a freer hand to deal with situations like
the one in Angola, where guerrillas are trying
to oust a Marxist government supported by
Cuban troops and Russian arms.
Zairian soldiers saved whites
Kinshasa, Zaire — An American who survived
a week of terror in Kolwezi, Zaire, says he and
more than a dozen other whites owe their lives
to Zairian soldiers who convinced a mob to
spare some of the captives.
Rick Black, 42, a Zambia resident originally
from Los Angeles, said he, his girlfriend Jenny,
and other whites were saved by a contingent of
captured Zairian soldiers who had spent sev
eral days with them in a Kolwezi police station.
Black told his story Wednesday at Kinshasa
airport, before he boarded an airplane leaving

the country — one of hundreds of Europeans
and Americans rescued by French and Belgian
soldiers after being caught in an attack by
Katanganese rebels against Zaire's mineral
rich Shaba province.
Black said the Zairians performed the rescue
on May 17, when a mob stormed the police
station in apparent anger over the arrival of
French paratroopers.
Black said the Zairian soldiers donned civi
lian clothes and convinced the mob to leave.
French paratroopers freed the group.

Arms talks open amid tension
New York — The United States and th(
Soviet Union opened a new and possibl)
climactic round of negotiations on weapon:
limits yesterday against a backdrop of strainec
relations between the two superpowers.
"The level of tension is fairly high," said .
senior U.S. official before Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance met for nearly two hours at tht
Soviet U.N. mission with Foreign Minister An
drei Cromyko.
Vance told reporters in a brief sidewalk new
conference afterward that it was "too early tc
say" if there was progress.
Vance confirmed President Jimmy Carte
will enter the talks Saturday in Washington
seeing Gromyko at the White House.
Another likely topic of discussion there i:
U.S. displeasure with Soviet and Cuban activ
ity in Africa.
Asked to assess prospects for moving to
ward a new treaty limiting long-range bombers
and intercontinental ballistic missiles, Vance
said: "We haven't had enough time to talk."
The talks move to Washington today.
What the Carter administration regards as
Soviet and Cuban adventurism in Africa has
clouded prospects for a weapons limitation
treaty by the end of the year.
On top of that there has been an unpre
cedented Soviet strategic buildup in Europe
which was condemned by Vice President Wal
ter Mondale in a policy speech to the U.N.
special disarmament conference.
Specifically, he deplored the deployment of
the SS-20, a new, mobile intermediate range
missile that Mondale said menaces civilian as
well as military targets.
Ford: tougher SALT stand
Washington — Former President Gerald Ford
said yesterday that if the Soviet Union persists
in African adventurism, the United States may
have to retaliate by refusing to conclude a new
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty with Moscow.
Ford said the issues are interrelated, and that
he would not preclude the use of the SALT
talks as a method of putting pressure on the
Russians.
"I think the Soviet Union does want a SALT II
agreement," he told a news conference. "I
think the administration has to take a harder
line than they have been, and if the Soviet
Union is going to persist in the adventurism
they are undertaking with the Cubans in Af
rica, as they are, we may well have to say to the
Soviet Union 'SALT II is not a possibility.' "
Ford said he agrees with President Jimmy
Carter that Congress should give the White
House a freer hand to deal with situations like
the one in Angola, where guerrillas are trying
to oust a Marxist government supported by
Cuban troops and Russian arms.
Zairian soldiers saved whites
Kinshasa, Zaire — An American who survived
a week of terror in Kolwezi, Zaire, says he and
more than a dozen other whites owe their lives
to Zairian soldiers who convinced a mob to
spare some of the captives.
Rick Black, 42, a Zambia resident originally
from Los Angeles, said he, his girlfriend Jenny,
and other whites were saved by a contingent of
captured Zairian soldiers who had spent sev
eral days with them in a Kolwezi police station.
Black told his story Wednesday at Kinshasa
airport, before he boarded an airplane leaving

the country — one of hundreds of Europeans
and Americans rescued by French and Belgian
soldiers after being caught in an attack by
Katanganese rebels against Zaire's mineral
rich Shaba province.
Black said the Zairians performed the rescue
on May 17, when a mob stormed the police
station in apparent anger over the arrival of
French paratroopers.
Black said the Zairian soldiers donned civi
lian clothes and convinced the mob to leave.
French paratroopers freed the group.
Tokyo airport site of bombing
Tokyo — Several masked men firebombed a
Korean Air Lines employee dormitory near To
kyo's new international airport yesterday in
what was apparently the latest attack by radi
cals who want to shut down the airport.
No injuries were reported and the damage
was minor and limited to an unoccupied
ground-floor room in the six-story building.
The airport opened officially last weekend
after years of delay caused by protests and
hit-run attacks by radical opponents. A Korean
Air Lines flight was the first to take off from
Narita after the opening.
The opposition comes from farmers who did
not want to give up their land for the giant $1
billion facility, from environmentalists fearing
noise pollution and possible dangers from the
transport of aircraft fuel, and from radicals
who seized on the airport as an anti
government issue.
Iranian gov't takes firm stand
Tehran, Iran — Iranian dissidents can de
monstrate all they want against the Shah, says
Prime Minister Jamshid Amouzegar, but "if
they want to start a riot... we will act and act
strongly." He blamed recent bloody distur
bances on international terrorists using "the
cloak of religion."
In an interview with The Associated Press,
the Iranian government chief also said oil
prices will probably hold steady this year and
Iran favors "sticking with the U.S. dollar" as
the basis for the oil trade. But he said
Washington must reduce its $60-billion budget
deficit.
Five months of anti-government rioting and
street battles with security forces in Iranian
cities have claimed about 40 lives and caused
widespread destruction.
The protests are led by orthodox Moslems
opposed to Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's
policies of modernizing this old Islamic soci
ety, but they are believed to have at least moral
support from dissidents who demand a
liberalization of the Shah's one-party political
system.
Amouzegar said the government has
opened a dialogue with religious leaders to try
to eliminate "misunderstanding" and per
suade them not to "fall for false propaganda."
State budget surplus grows
Sacramento — California's estimated state
budget surplus has grown by $419 million since
January, and now stands at a record $3.63 bill
ion, state Finance Director Roy Bell said yes
terday.
Bell said California businesses had bigger
profits than expected, boosting corporate in
come tax receipts, and the total personal in
come of private citizens is slightly higher than
estimated in January.

He also said state costs in education and
health care fell short of earlier estimates.
The surplus is equal to 21 per cent of Gov.
Edmund Brown's proposed $17.4 billion
budget. Bell said the state needs to hold in
reserve only about 2Va per cent, or $400 mill
ion, as a "prudent surplus" to meet unex
pected emergencies.
Bell said the bigger surplus gives the state
slightly more leeway in meeting needs of local
government if Proposition 13, the Howard Jar
vis property tax cut initiative, is approved by
voters on June 6.
But Bell, who is Brown's chief fiscal adviser,
said the $7 billion annual cut which would be
ordered by Proposition 13 is so big that it
dwarfs the state surplus.
Bid for execution delay denied
Washington — A Georgia death row inmate
scheduled to die in the electric chair today was
denied an execution postponement by the
Supreme Court yesterday.
His attorney was said to be trying through a
Georgia court to get the execution delayed.
Unless Ronald Douthit's lawyer takes quick
and successful action before 10 a.m. today,
Douthit will become the second prisoner exe
cuted in the United States since 1967.
He is scheduled to die in the electric chair in
Georgia sometime between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
today.
Voting 7-2, the nation's highest court turned
down a request by Douthit's lawyer, Eugene
Deal of Atlanta, that it postpone the execution
until a formal appeal could be filed with it. -
Justices William Brennan Jr. and Thurgood
Marshall, who oppose capital punishment
under any circumstances, voted to block
Douthit's execution.
D.A. fights minority hiring act
Sacramento — A district attorney challenging
a requirement to hire minority lawyers said
yesterday he's uncertain whether the state
Supreme Court will make a landmark ruling in
the case.
"Whether this turns out to be a landmark
bigger than Bakke I couldn't tell you," said
Sacramento County District Attorney John
Price, who filed the 1975 suit against the
County Civil Service Commission.
A week ago the state Supreme Court agreed
to hear the Civil Service Commission's appeal
of Price's case. For the time being, the court's
action nullifies the Jan. 30 decision by the state
appeals court in Sacramento upholding Price's
position.
The appeals court ruled the commission had
overstepped the federal Civil Rights Act's ob
jective of removing artificial, arbitrary and un
necessary barriers to employment.
Justice Leonard Friedman, supported by the
two other judges on the panel, held that the
quota "establishes a barrier to the employ
ment of majority applicants."
New Jersey casino to open
Trenton, N.J. — The nation's only legal
gambling casino outside Nevada won state ap
proval last night — and planned an opening
today — when the New Jersey Casino Control
Commission voted 5-0 to issue an operating
permit.
After an 11-hour discussion, and after
months of writing regulations on everything
from blackjack to showgirls' pasties, the com

mission decided Resorts International Hotel
Casino was fit to become the first of many
gambling palaces expected to go up in Atlantic
City.
The casino is the result of a $40 million reno
vation of the former Chalfonte-Haddon Hall
Hotel.
Nixon to host POW reception
Los Angeles — It has been five years since
American prisoners of war returned home
from North Vietnam, and approximately 300
former POWs are gathering here for a big reun
ion this weekend.
Organizers say it will be the largest reunion
of former POWs since former President
Richard Nixon held a reception for them at the
Whiete House in May 1973.
Nixon has invited the POWs down to his San
Clemente estate for a cocktail party Saturday
night, the largest party Nixon has thrown since
leaving the presidency in 1974.
No one knows how many of the former
POWs will visit Nixon, but as former Air Force
flier John Nasmyth said, "I'm sure we're prob
ably the most loyal group to him there is be
cause he got us out."
Newton pleads innocent
Santa Cruz — Black Panther leader Huey
Newton and his body guard Robert )oe Heard
pleaded innocent yesterday to criminal
charges of assault stemming from a bullet
punctuated barroom brawl two weeks ago.
After hearing the pleas, Municipal Court
Judge Richard McAdams set June 2 for a pre
liminary hearing on charges of assault with in
tent to commit murder, assault and being ex
felons in possession of firearms.
McAdams also signed a warrant, over the
objections of defense attorney Floyd Silliman,
authorizing blood samples from each man.
Ralph Boroff, Santa Cruz County deputy dis
trict attorney, would not say specifically why
prosecutors want blood samples, saying the
blood "relates to scientific evidence which we
already have and it would be for the benefit of
everyone."
Newton, 36, is free on $50,000 bail on the
Santa Cruz charges and $155,000 bail in con
nection with his pending trial in Alameda
County on charges of killing a prostitute and
pistol whipping his tailor in 1974. Heard, 29, is
free on $50,000 bail.
