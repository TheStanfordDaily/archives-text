# Independent appraisal done
## Land sale price questioned 
### Gary Furlong 
The controversy surrounding the sale of 694 acres
of Stanford-owned land intensified thisweek, withan
independent appraisal claiming the land is being sold
for more than $1.5 million below fair market price.
The original sale price Stanford was offered and
was prepared to accept was $684 per acre, a total price
of $475,000 for the land. The independent appraisal,
which will be made public Monday or Tuesday,
claims the land is worth $3000 per acre, a total of $2.08
million.
The land is to be purchased by the Midpeninsula
Open Space District (MOSD), a government agency
established to purchase private land to keep it free
from development.
Before escrow was closed on the land deal, how
ever, a Palo Alto attorney charged that the University
was selling the land at an improperly low price.
Attorney Harry Aine, a Stanford alumnus, alleged
that the sale at the low price was a "sweetheart deal."
Aine said the final closing of the deal had been
postponed numerous times pending investigation of
his charges when he said he finally tired of waiting.
"I wrote a letter to the University and told them to
get an independent appraisal. I didn't hear anything.
So I offered to have it appraised at my expense. Again
I didn't hear much. I then went ahead and had the
land appraised by an independent appraiser," he
said.
The appraisal was done without the approval of
either MOSD or Stanford.
The appraiser, Ed )aynes, said he has been doing
independent appraisals for more than 20 years.
"I'm one of the most qualified people to appraise
that land. I did a very complete study, with about 19
comparable sales considered. I'm also very familiar
with the area."
One of the reasons )aynes said he knows the area
so well is because he used to work for MOSD.
"I worked forthem (MOSD) for three years as assis
tant general manager; I arranged most of their land
deals. The law requires them to pay fair market
value."
But Jaynes said, "I think they're not in compliance
with state law" on land acquisition methods.
However, MOSD land negotiator Craig Britton

doesn't accept Jaynes' appraisal.
"laynes may not be completely unbiased," Britton
said. "I would have to see the actual appraisal before I
say anything. A lot depends on how it was done, and
what sales it was compared to."
laynes, however, feels that selling the land at the
lower price is essentially a gift.
"If they (Stanford) want to give a gift of $1.5 million,
that's their business," laynes added, "but why try and
say this is a regular sale when it isn't? No one can
dispute that the land is worth $2 million."
Vice President for Business and Finance William
Massy questions the validity of the independent ap
praisal.
"I'd have to see the appraisal before I said any
thing," Massy said. "There are a lot of things that have
to be taken into account. I can't comment on it right
now."
"One thing that people don't understand," Britton
said, "is that the donor of the land in the first place,
George Morell, wanted the land left undeveloped. In
this deal, Stanford is getting money, as well as fulfil
ling Morell's wishes."
The land was originally donated in varying size par
cels by Trustee Emeritus George Morell over a period
of 11 years. At first, there were legal constraints on
development on the land given. These were com
pletely removed however, when the last parcel was
donated in 1972. But Morell's wishes that the land
remain undeveloped remain.
Legal counsel to the Office of Business and Finance
Michael Hudnell said if there were legal restraints on
development in this sale contract, that would cer
tainly affect the appraisal price. That is, the land
would therefore be less valuable.
And Hudnell said, "That is the intent that it (the
land) stays undeveloped."
Hudnell said he hoped this clause against de
velopment would be included in the sales contract.
"An announcement is expected today from Stan
ford as a result of a meeting between the University
and the MOSD held yesterday.
University officials would make no further com
ment on the situation pending the release of their
press statement.

deals. The law requires them to pay fair market
value."
But Jaynes said, "I think they're not in compliance
with state law" on land acquisition methods.
However, MOSD land negotiator Craig Britton

doesn't accept Jaynes' appraisal.
"laynes may not be completely unbiased," Britton
said. "I would have to see the actual appraisal before I
say anything. A lot depends on how it was done, and
what sales it was compared to."
laynes, however, feels that selling the land at the
lower price is essentially a gift.
"If they (Stanford) want to give a gift of $1.5 million,
that's their business," laynes added, "but why try and
say this is a regular sale when it isn't? No one can
dispute that the land is worth $2 million."
Vice President for Business and Finance William
Massy questions the validity of the independent ap
praisal.
"I'd have to see the appraisal before I said any
thing," Massy said. "There are a lot of things that have
to be taken into account. I can't comment on it right
now."
"One thing that people don't understand," Britton
said, "is that the donor of the land in the first place,
George Morell, wanted the land left undeveloped. In
this deal, Stanford is getting money, as well as fulfil
ling Morell's wishes."
The land was originally donated in varying size par
cels by Trustee Emeritus George Morell over a period
of 11 years. At first, there were legal constraints on
development on the land given. These were com
pletely removed however, when the last parcel was
donated in 1972. But Morell's wishes that the land
remain undeveloped remain.
Legal counsel to the Office of Business and Finance
Michael Hudnell said if there were legal restraints on
development in this sale contract, that would cer
tainly affect the appraisal price. That is, the land
would therefore be less valuable.
And Hudnell said, "That is the intent that it (the
land) stays undeveloped."
Hudnell said he hoped this clause against de
velopment would be included in the sales contract.
"An announcement is expected today from Stan
ford as a result of a meeting between the University
and the MOSD held yesterday.
University officials would make no further com
ment on the situation pending the release of their
press statement.
The controversy surrounding the sale of 694 acres
of Stanford-owned land intensified thisweek, withan
independent appraisal claiming the land is being sold
for more than $1.5 million below fair market price.
The original sale price Stanford was offered and
was prepared to accept was $684 per acre, a total price
of $475,000 for the land. The independent appraisal,
which will be made public Monday or Tuesday,
claims the land is worth $3000 per acre, a total of $2.08
million.
The land is to be purchased by the Midpeninsula
Open Space District (MOSD), a government agency
established to purchase private land to keep it free
from development.
Before escrow was closed on the land deal, how
ever, a Palo Alto attorney charged that the University
was selling the land at an improperly low price.
Attorney Harry Aine, a Stanford alumnus, alleged
that the sale at the low price was a "sweetheart deal."
Aine said the final closing of the deal had been
postponed numerous times pending investigation of
his charges when he said he finally tired of waiting.
"I wrote a letter to the University and told them to
get an independent appraisal. I didn't hear anything.
So I offered to have it appraised at my expense. Again
I didn't hear much. I then went ahead and had the
land appraised by an independent appraiser," he
said.
The appraisal was done without the approval of
either MOSD or Stanford.
The appraiser, Ed )aynes, said he has been doing
independent appraisals for more than 20 years.
"I'm one of the most qualified people to appraise
that land. I did a very complete study, with about 19
comparable sales considered. I'm also very familiar
with the area."
One of the reasons )aynes said he knows the area
so well is because he used to work for MOSD.
"I worked forthem (MOSD) for three years as assis
tant general manager; I arranged most of their land
deals. The law requires them to pay fair market
value."
But Jaynes said, "I think they're not in compliance
with state law" on land acquisition methods.
However, MOSD land negotiator Craig Britton
