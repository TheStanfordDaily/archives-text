# Carter: less restraint on presidency needed
## 
### 
Chicago (AP) — President Jimmy
Carter, complaining that he "can't
compete at all, even peacefully,"
with Soviet and Cuban adventuring
in Africa, criticized Congress yester
day for restricting presidential ability
to take decisive action abroad.
"There's a trend in Congress that is
building up that puts too much con
straint on a president to deal with
rapidly changing circumstances,"
Carter told a nationally broadcast
news conference.
While announcing that he has or
dered a review of legislative restric
tions, Carter specifically said he has
"no present intention" of asking for
repeal of legislation which bars di
rect or indirect U.S. aid to forces in
Angola.
The president met with reporters
shortly after arriving in Chicago to
address a Democratic fund-raising
dinner and began by condemning
Cuban and Angolan involvement in
the fighting in Zaire.
'Heavy responsibility'
He said both countries "must bear
a heavy responsibility" for the vio
lenceand killing in Zaire. He said the
invasion was mounted in neighbor
ing Angola and was aided by the Cu
bans.
Carter also said U.S. participation
in the multi-nation effort to rescue
Westerners trapped in Zaire was vir
tually complete and American trans
port planes used in the operation
soon would return to their bases.
In discussing the African crisis,
Carter expressed his concern, stated
recently in several meetings with
members of Congress, that some
provisions of security assistance
legislation place narrow limits on
when and where the aid can be used
and he said he has asked Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance to review the laws
with congressional leaders to deter
mine if any changes are advisable.
No forces
Carter said he has no intention of
sending military forces into Africa
but he does want authority to use
economic aid, loans, food and other
peaceful means to try to combat

Soviet-Cuban involvement.
"I have no intention of getting in
volved in Angola," he said and then
added that "I am not going to advo
cate any change in existing law"
pending the results of the review. "I
will oppose further restrictions," he
said.
But then Carter made a point of
saying he doesn't plan now to ask for
repeal of the Clark Amendment,
which bars U.S. aid to factions in An
gola.
Carter also was asked whether
Soviet sponsorship of the Cuban
forces in Africa might lead him to
consider suspension of strategic
arms negotiations with the Russians,
a move suggested by former Presi
dent Gerald Ford and several mem
bers of Congress.
Adverse reaction
Carter responded that he opposes
such linkage while warning that the
Soviets should be aware of the ad
verse reaction their African involve
ment could have in this country.
He said a SALT agreement is "so
important to our country and the
safety of the world, we ought not let
any impediment come between us
and reaching a successful agree
ment."
Carter's regional news confer
ence, which was televised nationally,
kicked off the president's two-day
trip, which will mix politics with bus
iness.
On other matters, Carter said:
— He might veto a $2.5 billion riv
ers and harbors bill, calling for a tax
on inland waterway users, because it
fails to require waterway users such
as barge lines to pay fees to defray
the cost of building and operating
navigational locks.
— He isn't concerned about polls
showing Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) would beat him in an election
because "I've never been particu
larly excited about very good polls,
and never particularly concerned
about bad polls."
— The administration was doing
everything possible to hold down in
flation short of imposing wage and
price controls.
