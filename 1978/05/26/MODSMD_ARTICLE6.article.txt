# U.S. should provide disarmament lead
## 
### 
Randall Schutt

This year the nations of the world
will spend $350 billion on arms, or
about $100 for every person on earth.
Recognizing the idiocy of the ever
accelerating arms race, the United
Nations has called a Special Session
on Disarmament that begins this
week and will continue until June 28,
1978.
Only eight special sessions have
been called by the UN since its
founding in San Francisco in 1945. At
this important Special Session, the
nations of the world will attempt to
adopt specific steps towards world
disarmament.
The United States is particularly
important in this session because of

its military dominance. The US has
the mightiest nuclear arsenal in the
world, it leads in the technology of
arms development, and it exports
more arms than any other nation.
We have made an impressive con
tribution to the development and
manufacture of arms for the western
world. Almost any war today uses
weapons "Made in the USA."
But still we continue spending an
amount equal to the total sum of all
federal personal income taxes, to
develop and procure even more
weapons. Right now the US is up
grading the Trident submarine mis
sile system. A Trident sub with its 408
independently-targetted warheads,

each of which is five times more
powerful than the bombs we drop
ped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, can
completely destroy every major city
in the USSR.
Wewill soon have aboutBoTrident
subs.
Right now the Air Force and the
Navy want to build about 3500 cruise
missiles. These small, inexpensive
(only about $1,000,000 each) rockets
are capable of flying thousands of
miles 50 to 100 feet off the ground
(below radar detection) and deliver
their nuclear warheads within 100
feet of their targets.
With these missiles we can destroy
Russian missiles in their concrete
silos, thus giving us first strike capa
bility. We could destroy Russia and
its missiles without suffering too
many casualities ourselves (only a
few million from the missile sites we
accidently miss and from the cloud of
radioactive fallout that would drift
around the world).
With this capability, nuclear war
will be more likely as it will be "in our
best interest" to attack while we can
get away with it without being com
pletely destroyed ourselves and be
fore the Russians develop the same
capability. Nuclear war will be our
best military option since we will be
able to "win."
Right now we have on the drawing
board other weapons, just waiting to
get funding, including the neutron
bomb and MX intercontinental bal
listic missile.
It is a fact that we have plenty of
arms to defend ourselves. Just one of
our present-day submarines is de
structive enough to deter any coun
try from attacking us. It is only at
budgettime each spring that the Pen
tagon declares that we must maintain
our superiority order to keep from
being destroyed.
In an effort to encourage the US to
offer credible disarmament initia
tives at the UN session, the Mobiliza
tion for Survival will present a peti
tion to Andrew Young, the US Am
bassador to the UN, this Saturday,
May 27 that reads: "Mr. President,
fulfill your campaign pledges. Cut
military spending. Move us toward a
world of zero nuclear weapons.
— Resolve to join other nations in
outlawing the use of nuclear
weaponry as a crime against human
ity.

— Pledge that under no cir
cumstances would the US be the first
to use nuclear weapons.
— End all research, development,
testing, production and deployment
of nuclear weapons and launching
systems, including the neutron
bomb, the cruise missile, the MX
missile and the Trident submarine.
— Initiate major reductions of our
nuclear weapons stockpile.
— Stop the export of nuclear
technology and actively pursue de
velopment of non-nuclear energy
sources at home and abroad.
— Halt all arms sales abroad —
especially the sale of conventional
weapons to dictatorial and repres
sive regimes.
— Cut the military budget by 15 per
cent this year and shift the money
into areas of human need.
— Guarantee decent and produc
tive jobs for those now employed in
military and nuclear industires.
Mr. President, these are eight im
mediate initiatives toward complete
and general disarmament that our
country can take without risk to our
security. They would spur other nuc
lear powers to take similar action.
People of the world are waiting for
some nation to take the first step —
let it be us."

into areas of human need.
— Guarantee decent and produc

Mr. President, these are eight im
mediate initiatives toward complete
and general disarmament that our
country can take without risk to our
security. They would spur other nuc
lear powers to take similar action.
People of the world are waiting for
some nation to take the first step —
let it be us."

This year the nations of the world
will spend $350 billion on arms, or
about $100 for every person on earth.
Recognizing the idiocy of the ever
accelerating arms race, the United
Nations has called a Special Session
on Disarmament that begins this
week and will continue until June 28,
1978.
Only eight special sessions have
been called by the UN since its
founding in San Francisco in 1945. At
this important Special Session, the
nations of the world will attempt to
adopt specific steps towards world
disarmament.
The United States is particularly
important in this session because of

its military dominance. The US has
the mightiest nuclear arsenal in the
world, it leads in the technology of
arms development, and it exports
more arms than any other nation.
We have made an impressive con
tribution to the development and
manufacture of arms for the western
world. Almost any war today uses
weapons "Made in the USA."
But still we continue spending an
amount equal to the total sum of all
federal personal income taxes, to
develop and procure even more
weapons. Right now the US is up
grading the Trident submarine mis
sile system. A Trident sub with its 408
independently-targetted warheads,

each of which is five times more
powerful than the bombs we drop
ped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, can
completely destroy every major city
in the USSR.
Wewill soon have aboutBoTrident
subs.
Right now the Air Force and the
Navy want to build about 3500 cruise
missiles. These small, inexpensive
(only about $1,000,000 each) rockets
are capable of flying thousands of
miles 50 to 100 feet off the ground
(below radar detection) and deliver
their nuclear warheads within 100
feet of their targets.
With these missiles we can destroy
Russian missiles in their concrete
silos, thus giving us first strike capa
bility. We could destroy Russia and
its missiles without suffering too
many casualities ourselves (only a
few million from the missile sites we
accidently miss and from the cloud of
radioactive fallout that would drift
around the world).
With this capability, nuclear war
will be more likely as it will be "in our
best interest" to attack while we can
get away with it without being com
pletely destroyed ourselves and be
fore the Russians develop the same
capability. Nuclear war will be our
best military option since we will be
able to "win."
Right now we have on the drawing
board other weapons, just waiting to
get funding, including the neutron
bomb and MX intercontinental bal
listic missile.
It is a fact that we have plenty of
arms to defend ourselves. Just one of
our present-day submarines is de
structive enough to deter any coun
try from attacking us. It is only at
budgettime each spring that the Pen
tagon declares that we must maintain
our superiority order to keep from
being destroyed.
In an effort to encourage the US to
offer credible disarmament initia
tives at the UN session, the Mobiliza
tion for Survival will present a peti
tion to Andrew Young, the US Am
bassador to the UN, this Saturday,
May 27 that reads: "Mr. President,
fulfill your campaign pledges. Cut
military spending. Move us toward a
world of zero nuclear weapons.
— Resolve to join other nations in
outlawing the use of nuclear
weaponry as a crime against human
ity.

— Pledge that under no cir
cumstances would the US be the first
to use nuclear weapons.
— End all research, development,
testing, production and deployment
of nuclear weapons and launching
systems, including the neutron
bomb, the cruise missile, the MX
missile and the Trident submarine.
— Initiate major reductions of our
nuclear weapons stockpile.
— Stop the export of nuclear
technology and actively pursue de
velopment of non-nuclear energy
sources at home and abroad.
— Halt all arms sales abroad —
especially the sale of conventional
weapons to dictatorial and repres
sive regimes.
— Cut the military budget by 15 per
cent this year and shift the money
into areas of human need.
— Guarantee decent and produc
tive jobs for those now employed in
military and nuclear industires.
