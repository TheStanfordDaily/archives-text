# Political education
## Getting out the vote 
### 
Chael Solari

Why does America have so many
national and urban problems? I have
always believed that it is because
people have become uninvolved in
their government, no one is watch
ing their representative. But why the
lack of interest?
Consider that most people around
today are children or descendants of
the nineteenth and twentieth cen
tury immigrants. Those foreigners
were neither brought up in or trained
in the American democratic process,
like their native counterparts.
Their votes were bought, not cast
with thought. I propose that when
those new residents' children began
attending school, during the great
educator's day of the turn of the cen
tury, there was a face off and com
promise between the educators and
the politicians.
Left out
The politicians and bosses would
pass school funding if educators ag
reed not to stress political education
and involvement in the classroom.
As a consequence, the children in
school, like those in the child labor
force, were left even further out of
the American political system.
Politicians could wallow in their
greed for power or money without
interference. Records reveal that
there was plenty of corruption.
When the grandchildren of the
immigrants eventually moved out of
the central cities to the suburbs, they
left behind them the advantage of
being at least somewhat politically
aware from propinquity. Therefore,
they became even less politicized or
involved and became more isolated.
Note the poor showings in recent

American election history for all of
fices.
Instruction in fundamentals
Obviously the American people
need to be educated in the funda
mentals of democracy, and most im
portant the specifics of how to actu
ally participate. To start with, politi
cal education should be introduced
into the school system at the primary
level and follwed up in high school.
A first grader should not read such
trash as, "See Dick run! Run! Run!
Run!'' The child can see Dick run in
the playground. I say his text should
read, "See Dick and Jane vote! Vote!
Vote! Vote!" High school civics
courses today are a joke. Many
schools do not even have them. They
need to be overhauled and com
plimented with community field ex
perience.
Training children
The goal of my suggestion is not to
brainwash our children, although
they have already been brainwashed
to be apathetic, but rather to train
them to be active, knowledgeable
citizens with employable political
skills. Of course you can not make
people get involved all of the time.
But, if people know their political
power, they will at least be able to act
when something happens that is of
concern to them.
In every town and city there are
problems affecting someone. Na
tional policy making affects
everyone. Citizen input is needed.
Afterall, "we" should be the gov
ernors, not 'them.'
