Conflict resolution
I have been following with some
interest the recent positions of the
United Campus Christian Ministry
(UCCM), as I hope they may solve a
recurring minor conflict. For a
number of years, I have annuaily
given a small percentage of my salary
to the M.L. King fund.
This fund, supported by a number
of faculty and staff, provides scholar
ships for Stanford students. I confess
to feeling some conflict each year
about renewing this pledge, as I
weigh my desire to contribute to a
cause in which I believe against the
selfish impluses prompted by the
ravages of inflation on my seemingly
always inadequate salary.
If I understand the position of
UCCM correctly, I can resolve this
conflict by canceling my pledge to
the M.L. King fund, at the same time
writing an angry letter to the trustees
denouncing their refusal to "re
spond to the community and adopt a
responsible investment policy."
At one fell swoop I can strike a
blow for freedom, contribute to an
end to oppression in South Africa,
assuage my conscience, express my
contempt for the fascist running
dogs who control this University,
and free some funds which I can con
tribute to the local economy, thereby
reducing unemployment.

Griffin has demerits
Some students trying to name a
mascot for Stanford (understanda
bly) came up with "Griffin." In Webs
ter's Collegiate Dictionary, a griffin is
described as a monster half lion and
half eagle; also a griffe, or mulatto;
also a dog of European breed, so cal
led because of resemblances to the
griffin. The Unabridged Dictionary
adds it is a vulture (Gyps fulvus)
found in the mountainous parts of
Europe, N. Africa and Turkey. Grif
fin:
— an Occidental recently arrived
in the East, especially India;

— a race horse making its first race.
Griffinage — in India, the condi
tion of being a griffin or newcomer.
Griffinism — griffinage; hence,
lack of experience. (The football
team would love that!)
The Collegiate Dictionary on
monster: monstrosity, grotesque or
horrible form. Anything monstrous,
unnatural ugliness, cruelty. Just what
is this creature of fantasy, illusion
and imagination?
Some mascot! One Griffin advo
cate summed up the situation in the
Daily: "There's no way a Bear could
ever beat a Griffin."
No way. You can't beat something
that doesn't exist and is only an illu
sion, a fantasy. So — if accepted as
the Stanford mascot, could it not

open the way to even more racial pre
judice than the Indian.
What an opportunity for the rival
rooters' section — "Hi dogs,"
"Half-assed monster," etc., etc.
What a fertile field for ridicule! To be
called a "dog" or "half-breed" is
hardly an improvement on an Indian
Chief! Why trade a noble Indian fora
"dog" in the worst sense of the
word?
The Indian is a well-loved and
honored part of our national herit
age. Why change when Stanford can
have a mascot that is honored by
thousands'of alumni, students and
friends of the University.
