# Few students informed
## Campus groups foster political awareness 
### Jennifer Olney 
Up and down El Camino Real, hundreds of
brightly colored campaign posters alert commut
ers and shoppers to the upcoming state and local
election. Vet turning on to the campus one is
hardly aware of the June 6 primary. There are no
banners, no posters, no campaign buttons. Only a
few students even know the names of candidates
in any local race.
"The basic problem is a cause and effect rela
tionship," Rick Weber, cochairman of the Stan
ford Committee on Political Education (SCOPE),
said.
"The (local) candidates .. really don't come to
the campus as much as they could. There are many
groups that would be willing to sponsor such
speakers, but the speakers are not coming to them
or are not willing to come to this campus. If they
were more.interested in being here, I think we
would get more awareness, more student con
cern."
SCOPE is a student-run organization trying to
foster greater political awareness. However, it
centers its efforts on national and state issues, in
which members feel there is more student interest
than in local issues.
12th district race
The one local race that does arouse student in
terest is the 12th district congressional race,
Weber said.
"The reason that you will have interest in the
congressional race is that (Rep.) Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) will speak at Stanford five or six
times a year," Weber said. "He will actively come
before groups and try to get speaking engage
ments."
Kirsten Olsen, a candidate in the Democratic
primary for McCloskey's seat, has attended a few
events here. However, she admitted, she has been
remiss in contacting Stanford students.
Ronald Davis, Olsen's opponent in the primary
and a former Stanford student, said he plans to
distribute literature in White Plaza and is arranging

to give a speech on his proposal for monetary
reform. He said he has been in touch with the
Stanford Democrats.
Joseph Zingale, who is opposing McCloskey in
the Republican primary, has contacted the Stan
ford College Republicans, according to Rose
Marie Mason, a campaign worker. He too hopes to
campaign on campus.
Former chairman of the Stanford College Re
publicans Paul Cheverton said because the prop
ortion of Republican voters here is so low, it makes
more sense for Republican primary candidates to
concentrate campus campaign efforts specifically
on the Stanford College Republicans. He esti
mated that 15 per cent of the students here are
registered Republican.
Student interest late
"In local political elections, student interest, if
any, appears just before the election," Cheverton
said. "Student interest is really based more on
state or national issues, probably because a lot of
people vote absentee from home.
"In local issues, usually you have some (stu
dents) that are very involved but ... a lot of
people aren't really interested unless there is
some direct exposure . . . and still it is very hard to
get them interested."
Brad Krevoy, chairman of the Stanford Democ
rats, said the best way to gauge student interest is
by voter participation.
Turnout high
The voter turnout for the University area pre
cincts is high compared to other college campuses
and it is heavily Democratic, he said.
"As far as what the Stanford student feels about
politics in general, it seems that the primary races
aren't of that major concern. Either the candidates
aren't that appealing or tive issues themselves
aren't that great. However, I think Proposition 13
has attracted a whole bunch of interest."
There are about 25 students now who are work
ing to oppose the Jarvis-Gann initiative, according

to Krevoy. He said there will be a special "get out
the vote drive" targeted at those people who will
be most inclined to vote no on 13. The Stanford
Democrats are working closely with this group, he
added.
Republicans divided
Cheverton said he does not know of any or
ganized group in favor of Proposition 13. The Col
lege Republicans are divided on 13, he said, which
makes an organized effort difficult.
Cheverton said he thinks the College Republi
cans will strongly support Stanford alumnus Greg
Morris, running unopposed in the 21st assembly
district Republican primary. Cheverton is a
member of Morris' steering committee.
Morris has scheduled a rally with McCloskey
and three sherry hours on campus.
Calvo unopposed
Victor Calvo who now holds the 21st assembly
district seat has not scheduled any campus ac
tivities yet, according to Dorothy Comstock, co
manager of his campaign. He is running unop
posed in the Democratic primary, and so his cam
paign is just beginning, Comstock said.
Krevoy said the Stanford Democrats strongly
support Calvo.
Candidates anxious
"Most of,the people running in the primary
campaigns are more anxious to come here than
the students are to see them," according to the
chairman of the Santa Clara County Young Repub
licans.
But he said he believes there is a lot of latent
interest in politics among Stanford students.
"Maybe the institutional mechanisms are not
fully taken advantage of to interest students and
get them active in the campaigns," he said.
Lack of student knowledge of the candidates, is
a "failing of not only the Young Democrats and
Young Republicans, but also of the news media
and the candidates themselves for not getting the
Daily and KZSU to publicize more of their events,"
he added.
