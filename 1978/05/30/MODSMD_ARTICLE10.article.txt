# University to meet needs of handicapped here
## 
### Jean Kimmel 
Have you ever parked in a space marked
for the handicapped?
You may have noticed the recent curb
cutting and ramp-making on campus. It is
not for the convenience of the bicyclists;
rather, it is for the accommodation of the
handicapped.
A dozen
Stanford has about a dozen disabled stu
dents.
"The term disabled' incorporates many
forms of handicaps according to federal de
finition, but the University deals with physi
cal limitations such as visual, hearing and
mobility," said Associate Provost Wayne
Price.
The University has had limited experience
in developing programs for the disabled. An
official committee to deal with matters con
cerning the disabled was formed last year.
President Richard Lyman named Wayne
Price the University's representative in mat
ters pertaining to the new rules and regula
tions for the disabled issued by the Depart
ment of Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW).
Equal opportunities
The rules and regulation set by the HEW
are concerned specifically with assuring
equal opportunities for the disabled. The
University is required to make all its build
ings and programs accessible to them.
Because of the HEW regulations, the Uni
versity has initiated two programs under
Price's office.

One, directed by Harold Boyd, Assistant
Dean of Student Affairs, deals with the per
sonal needs of students. Boyd's committee
consists of some disabled students and rep
resentatives from Cowell Health Center, The
Career Planning and Placement Center, the
office of Residential Education and Tresid
der.
Brochure
Boyd's committee compiled a brochure
illustrating the accessible entries to build
ings and listing special services available to
students such as wheelchair repair at the
bike shop.
"I suspect that more disabled students will
become interested in Stanford once we pub
licize these services," Boyd said.
The other program, designated as the
Handicap Access Team, is part of the
Facilities Planning Office. Its task is to survey
all University buildings and to estimate costs
of modifying present structures in order to
make them accessible to the disabled.
"We have been considering putting in
ramps and elevators for the wheelchaired
student, and making textured room identifi
cation makers for the blind student," said
Steve Schmidt, physical planner of the
Handicap Access Team.
Most use
Priority for modification is given to build
ings that get the most public use, such as
Memorial Auditorium, the Little Theatre and
Tresidder.
"We have to consider the design aspect,
the aesthetic aspect and the financial aspect

of any modification. We estimated that to
put on ramp into a typical Quad building
would cost $1200," Schmidt said.
"Architectual considerations for disabled
students probably began during the early
19605, but Stanford never had to go full
swing into a modification project because
there wasn't a demand for the facilities. Now
that there is, Stanford has to begin to ac
commodate," said Schmidt.
Compete for funding
The University does not get money speci
fically for these modifications. The modifica
tion plans must compete with other Univer
sity projects in need of funding.
The University has applied with the city of
Palo Alto for a federal grant that would give it
$45,000 to work with. The modification plans
are for the benefit of the disabied faculty,
staff and visitors as well as students.
The University is becoming more aware of
the particular problems of the disabled.
"The reality is coming of age. We are in a
learning assessment situation, a self
assessment of our programs and services so
that there is no discrimination," Price said.
New dimension
"It is like thinking in a new dimension,"
said Schmidt.
Have you ever considered what it would
be like to be blind on campus? Think how
difficult it would be to find a classroom inthe
Quad where every corner is alike, especially
if you weren't familiar with the campus.
Do you realize that the simple presence of
bicycles in front of Meyer library are

dangerous obstacles to the blind student?
No access
Some students in wheelchairs say they
cannot get into many buildings on campus.
"I do fine, my only complaint is that there
aren't enough ramps. I can't get into the
Bechtel l-Center by myself," said one
graduate student.
"It also would be nice to be able to take
the Margarite to the shopping mall â€” since I
can't get on the bus, I have to do most of my
shopping at the bookstore," he added.
Behind others
The University's stage of development in
dealingwith problems of the handicapped is
five years behind those of the University of
California at Berkeley and San lose State.
UC-Berkeley has a disabled population of
over 400, and San )ose State has a similar
population of over 270. Both have well
developed programs for the disabled, for
each campus is fully accessible and has a
full-time organization that provides special
services for disabled students.
"It would be nice to have a disabled stu
dent union just so I would know what ser
vices are available at Stanford. A program
that helps me be as independent as I can
would be best," said one disabled student.
Independent
"All Stanford students are very indepen
dent and that is no exception for the dis
abled students. Therefore, we don't want to
forceouraid on them if they don'twant it, or
don't need it," said Boyd.
"Stanford has a unique approach to the

situation. We respond to the needs of indi
vidual students," said James Lyons, Dean of
Student Affairs.
Peter Axelson, a paraplegic student, told
of the University's quick response to his
needs when on his first day he couldn't get
into his room or the bathroom.
"Within an hour they had workmen wide
ning the doorway and redoing the bat
hroom," Axelson said.
"It is funny how Stanford rushes to help
me with any individual problems that I may
have, but is slow at helping to establish any
permanent program," he said.
File
"We tried to start a file in Old Union speci
fically for the new programs and ideas, and
also to have a phone and P.O. Box so that
interested people could get in touch with us,
but someone didn't go for the idea," Axel
son continued.
The University does well in providing for
individual disabled students here on cam
pus, but no immediate action has been
taken to encourage more disabled students
to apply.
"Many schools have separate admissions
procedures for the disabled," said Lyons.
"Stanford will not compromise its admis
sions standards just to let in a quota of hand
icapped.
"Once students are admitted based on
their academic and extracurricular achieve
ments, we'll do all we can to make sure their
specific needs are met so they will stay. We
will do this for all our students," he said.

forceouraid on them if they don'twant it, or
don't need it," said Boyd.
"Stanford has a unique approach to the

situation. We respond to the needs of indi
vidual students," said James Lyons, Dean of
Student Affairs.
Peter Axelson, a paraplegic student, told
of the University's quick response to his
needs when on his first day he couldn't get
into his room or the bathroom.
"Within an hour they had workmen wide
ning the doorway and redoing the bat
hroom," Axelson said.
"It is funny how Stanford rushes to help
me with any individual problems that I may
have, but is slow at helping to establish any
permanent program," he said.
File
"We tried to start a file in Old Union speci
fically for the new programs and ideas, and
also to have a phone and P.O. Box so that
interested people could get in touch with us,
but someone didn't go for the idea," Axel
son continued.
The University does well in providing for
individual disabled students here on cam
pus, but no immediate action has been
taken to encourage more disabled students
to apply.
"Many schools have separate admissions
procedures for the disabled," said Lyons.
"Stanford will not compromise its admis
sions standards just to let in a quota of hand
icapped.
"Once students are admitted based on
their academic and extracurricular achieve
ments, we'll do all we can to make sure their
specific needs are met so they will stay. We
will do this for all our students," he said.
Have you ever parked in a space marked
for the handicapped?
You may have noticed the recent curb
cutting and ramp-making on campus. It is
not for the convenience of the bicyclists;
rather, it is for the accommodation of the
handicapped.
A dozen
Stanford has about a dozen disabled stu
dents.
"The term disabled' incorporates many
forms of handicaps according to federal de
finition, but the University deals with physi
cal limitations such as visual, hearing and
mobility," said Associate Provost Wayne
Price.
The University has had limited experience
in developing programs for the disabled. An
official committee to deal with matters con
cerning the disabled was formed last year.
President Richard Lyman named Wayne
Price the University's representative in mat
ters pertaining to the new rules and regula
tions for the disabled issued by the Depart
ment of Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW).
Equal opportunities
The rules and regulation set by the HEW
are concerned specifically with assuring
equal opportunities for the disabled. The
University is required to make all its build
ings and programs accessible to them.
Because of the HEW regulations, the Uni
versity has initiated two programs under
Price's office.

One, directed by Harold Boyd, Assistant
Dean of Student Affairs, deals with the per
sonal needs of students. Boyd's committee
consists of some disabled students and rep
resentatives from Cowell Health Center, The
Career Planning and Placement Center, the
office of Residential Education and Tresid
der.
Brochure
Boyd's committee compiled a brochure
illustrating the accessible entries to build
ings and listing special services available to
students such as wheelchair repair at the
bike shop.
"I suspect that more disabled students will
become interested in Stanford once we pub
licize these services," Boyd said.
The other program, designated as the
Handicap Access Team, is part of the
Facilities Planning Office. Its task is to survey
all University buildings and to estimate costs
of modifying present structures in order to
make them accessible to the disabled.
"We have been considering putting in
ramps and elevators for the wheelchaired
student, and making textured room identifi
cation makers for the blind student," said
Steve Schmidt, physical planner of the
Handicap Access Team.
Most use
Priority for modification is given to build
ings that get the most public use, such as
Memorial Auditorium, the Little Theatre and
Tresidder.
"We have to consider the design aspect,
the aesthetic aspect and the financial aspect

of any modification. We estimated that to
put on ramp into a typical Quad building
would cost $1200," Schmidt said.
"Architectual considerations for disabled
students probably began during the early
19605, but Stanford never had to go full
swing into a modification project because
there wasn't a demand for the facilities. Now
that there is, Stanford has to begin to ac
commodate," said Schmidt.
Compete for funding
The University does not get money speci
fically for these modifications. The modifica
tion plans must compete with other Univer
sity projects in need of funding.
The University has applied with the city of
Palo Alto for a federal grant that would give it
$45,000 to work with. The modification plans
are for the benefit of the disabied faculty,
staff and visitors as well as students.
The University is becoming more aware of
the particular problems of the disabled.
"The reality is coming of age. We are in a
learning assessment situation, a self
assessment of our programs and services so
that there is no discrimination," Price said.
New dimension
"It is like thinking in a new dimension,"
said Schmidt.
Have you ever considered what it would
be like to be blind on campus? Think how
difficult it would be to find a classroom inthe
Quad where every corner is alike, especially
if you weren't familiar with the campus.
Do you realize that the simple presence of
bicycles in front of Meyer library are

dangerous obstacles to the blind student?
No access
Some students in wheelchairs say they
cannot get into many buildings on campus.
"I do fine, my only complaint is that there
aren't enough ramps. I can't get into the
Bechtel l-Center by myself," said one
graduate student.
"It also would be nice to be able to take
the Margarite to the shopping mall â€” since I
can't get on the bus, I have to do most of my
shopping at the bookstore," he added.
Behind others
The University's stage of development in
dealingwith problems of the handicapped is
five years behind those of the University of
California at Berkeley and San lose State.
UC-Berkeley has a disabled population of
over 400, and San )ose State has a similar
population of over 270. Both have well
developed programs for the disabled, for
each campus is fully accessible and has a
full-time organization that provides special
services for disabled students.
"It would be nice to have a disabled stu
dent union just so I would know what ser
vices are available at Stanford. A program
that helps me be as independent as I can
would be best," said one disabled student.
Independent
"All Stanford students are very indepen
dent and that is no exception for the dis
abled students. Therefore, we don't want to
forceouraid on them if they don'twant it, or
don't need it," said Boyd.
