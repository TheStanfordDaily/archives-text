# Student life at Florence campus
## features Italian art viewed in new context 
### Maile Meyer 
Florence â€” Art and Florence
are two concepts that should
be contained in the same
breath, for Florence is satu
rated with declarations of its ar
tistic tradition.
Florentine churches,
museums, palaces, gardens
and piazzas are filled with art,
spilling from one to the next,
blending and intertwining the
city in an inescapable visual
web.
A visitor to the city may focus
on a specific sculpture,
museum or church, taking the
piece of artwork out of con
text. The process of seeing the
city becomes a series of art
stops, where one jumps from
one point to the next in an at
tempt to piece a sense of
"Florence" together.
This view of Florence is re

fleeted in every guide book
and full-color postcard sold on
the street. It is the Florence
that thousands of tourist
memories are made of; but
what happens when the Uffizi
becomes a reference point for
the ice cream store around the
corner, as it has for both
Florentines and some students
in the Stanford-in-Florence
program?
Living in Florence during the
last five months has allowed
me to step from the first
perspective into the second.
During these months I have
shed my tourist naivete, but I
have not been here long
enough to call the city my
home. Throughout this period
of getting to know the city, my
concept of Florence and herart
has been broadened.
Florentineart is everywhere;

when classes stop the art
doesn't. The city's art con
tinues from the doorways of
her most famous four-star
churches and fills the streets
and even obscure alleyways.
Soft light falling from a worn
staircase or patterns in a bin of
silver catch an eye that has lost
the urgency to "see it all."
Living in Florence has given
me a sense of the normalcy of
art, and I tend to put it in an

everyday tense. The rich even
ing light, the understated
countryside colors, strands of
drying onions or the reflection
off a rain-spattered street have
been incorporated into my un
derstanding of Florentine art.
This acknowledgment of a
less monumental tradition
does not detract from my loyal
ties to the past, but widens my
concept of what is truly Floren
tine art.
