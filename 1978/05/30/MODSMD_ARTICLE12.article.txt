What is the number one
cause of death in the nation, as
well as the cause of strokes,
kidney disease and heart fai
lure? Well, if you thought the
answer was finals, you're
close, but wrong.
The real cause is high blood
pressure, and the Circle K Club
of Stanford is concerned
enough to make this disease
the central topic of their
Save-A-Life program.
The program, which takes
place today and tomorrow
from 10a.m.to2p.m. in White
Plaza, gives free, quick and
painless blood pressure read

This Save-A-Life program is
one of several service projects
that the Circle K sponsors dur
ing the year. Circle K is a co-ed
college service organization
sponsored by Kiwanis Interna

tional, a service organization
made up of professional
businessmen.
Circle K has been here for a
year and has approximately 50
members. Their last major pro
ject, conducted in January, was
a sweater drive for needy
people overseas.
A similar drive is planned for
the end of this school year.
The members also partici
pated in the Kiwanis Annual
Spring Cleanup in the PaloAlto
community on May 13.
Their last meeting of the
school year is planned for this
Thursday from 1 to 6 p.m. in
