# Natural birth control proves reliable

Los Angeles (AP) — Couples are increas
ingly turning away from the pill and other
forms of artificial birth control because of
health hazards, and a system of natural
family planning may provide the best al
ternative, a team of doctors testing the
new method claimed yesterday.
"We've found that the natural method is
practically risk free — except for possible
pregnancy," said Dr. Maclyn Wade, direc
tor of obstetrics and gynecology at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and head of
the project.
The natural method is different from the
rhythm method of earlier years in that it
relies on body indicators such as tempera
ture and the secretion of mucus to tell a
woman when she is fertile, Wade said. The
rhythm method relied strictly on the
calendar, he added.
Wade said that so far, the natural
method, if rigorously practiced, has had a
98 per cent success rate, compared to 99
per cent for the pill.

However, he pointed out that couples
joining the program were required to sign
a waiver saying they recognized there was
a 25 per cent chance that pregnancy could
occur and absolving the hospitals of re
sponsibility. •
"There's so much riding on it for so
many people," said Dr. Phyllis McCarthy,
codirector of the study which began in
1976 under a $1.4 million grant from the
federal government. "The impact of our
study will affect the lives of millions of
couples throughout the world."
The study of the effectiveness and com
plications of natural birth control methods
comes on the heels of what medical pro
fessionals say is a trend away from artificial
methods.
Dr. Hal Danzer, one of the researchers,
said a study in Berkeley two years ago
showed 50 per cent of those studied were
turning to natural methods, largely be
cause of medical problems — such as car
diovascular ailments possible strokes and

infections — associated with the pill, the
intrauterine device and the diaphragm.
Nationwide, he suggested, the rate of
those turning to the new method is proba
bly 20 to 30 per cent.
Wade said a key element in the natural
method is discipline. The woman must
keep a daily chart of certain bodily func
tions to determine when her fertile period
is.
"To recognize the signs was no problem
for the couples," said Wade. "But to con
trol their urges sometimes was a diffi
culty." He said several couples who let
their passions get the best of them had to
be dropped from the study.
Four of the participating couples, all of
whom had been shielded until now by
promises of anonymity, were present at
the news conference.
All but one couple said they turned to
the natural method after experiencing
problems with the pill or other artificial
birth control methods.
