## McEnroe captures NCAA title 
### 
Athens, Ga. (AP) — Stanford's
John McEnroe battled power
serving John Sadri of North
Carolina State for more than
four hours in the heat and
humidity yesterday before
claiming the National Col
legiate Athletic Association
singles championship 7-6, 7-6,
5-7, 7-6.
Sadri served 24 aces in the
contest, but McEnroe won the
match by twice breaking the
power-hitter's serve to win the
tie-breaking game of the final
set 5-3.
McEnroe, 18, was seeded
No. 1 in the individual compet
ition, while Sadri, a 22-year-old
senior, was the 11th seed. Both
plan to turn professional after
the competition.
McEnroe, generally consi
dered the best college player in
the nation, would have had
three remaining years of eligi
bility had he decided to remain
an amateur.
"It was an honest win and an
honest way to go out," McEn
roe said after the match. "This
is the way I wanted to finish up
my career as a collegian."
Sadri, who describes his
game simply as "boom," got
into the finals by defeating
third seed Eddie Edwards of
Pepperdine 6-1, 6-7, 6-1 in
Sunday's semifinals.

After that match, Edwards
described Sadri's play as a
"serve hell out of the ball and
rush the net game."
But his game wasn't enough
to overpower McEnroe, who
calls himself "more of a place
ment player" than a power hit
ter.
"I didn't think I was return
ing too badly," McEnroe said.
"In fact, I thought I was return
ing serve pretty well. I wasn't
sure how well he could volley,
but he surprised me."
"Every part of his game is
good," Sadri conceded after
the match.
McEnroe said he plans to
enter his first professional
tournament this summer dur
ing an English clay court con
test about a week before
Wimbledon.
Sadri isn't waiting that long.
He said he will make his pro
fessional debut tomorrow in
Greenville, S.C.
John Austin and Bruce
Nichols of UCLA defeated Gary
Plock and Kevin Curren of
Texas 6-4, 6-4 and 6-2 for the
doubles championship.
Austin and Nichols went to
the finals in doubles competi
tion last year and lost to Bruce
Manson and Chris Lewis of
Southern California.
