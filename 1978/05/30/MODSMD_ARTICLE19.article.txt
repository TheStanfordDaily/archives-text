# Lacrosse season successful

"Stanford's tough. Their at
tack is unpredictable. They've
got cannons at the midfield.
Their defense just swarms all
over you and never gives you a
clean shot. If you do get a shot
off, the goalie suclÂ« it up like a
vacuum cleaner. And this is
their rebuilding year!"
The above lament was ex
pressed by a UC-Davis player
after Stanford's lacrosse club
thrashed his team 17-4. The
laxmen had come off of an 18-1
season in 1977, and had lost
two-thirds of the team to
graduation or to the newly

formed Palo Alto club. But
coach Sam Sadtler rebuilt Stan
ford into a 12-4 winner, cap
tured a major tournament title
and boasted the best defense
(five goals per game) of any
university club on the West
Coast.
"The guys did a super job on
defense all year," said Sadtler.
"We'll miss (Dave) Swanson
and (Gary) Robinson due to
graduation, but we'll have four
defensemen returning."
Kirk Phelpsand John Nordell
were the cannons at midfield.
Phelps led the club in scoring
(44 goals, 13 assists) while Nor

dell (21,9) paced the second
line of middies. Peter Werner
(8,3) and Greg Delgado (7,2)
complimented Phelps and
played on the man down,
penalty-killing teams. Peter
Stamats and Witte Ganz were
the playmakers for the second
line.
The attack was headed by
Rick Valentine (24,19), Brad
Keith (6,3), Tom Drelles (5,2),
Stan Allison (5,1) and Dick
Taylor (4,2). When injuries rid
dled the attack, middie Willie
Reid (6,2) and goaltender
Denny Childs (3,0) filled the
voids.

Childs was recognized as
one of the area's best goalies.
His 4.97 goals against and 15
saves per game were among
the best in California. Childs,
along with Swanson, Robin
son, Phelps, Nordell, Werner,
Stamats and Valentine was
named to the 1978 University
All-Star Team.
Only two men will not return
to next year's squad, and the
Stanford Lacrosse Club will be
looking forward to improving
their 12-4 record. The season
will begin next )anuary and
continue through Memorial
Weekend.
