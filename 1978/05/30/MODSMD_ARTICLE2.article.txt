# 'Not businessmen in lock-step'
## The 						trustees: diverse but cooperative 
### Jill Liscom First of two parts 
Do you know how many trustees
there are, how they are selected, or
how the Board of Trustees makes its
decisions? If not, you are not alone.
Ever since the board was organized
in 1885, with only 15 members, stu
dents have had misconceptions
about it and its operations.
The board now consists of 34
members who meet nine times a
year.
According to trustee William Ayer,
"there's a substantial diversity of in
terest among the trustees which
makes for excellent decisions. It's
not 34 businessmen marching in
lock-step with briefcases."
"It's unfair to everyone to blow up
the notion of monolithic groups,"
commented Robert HamrJia, assis
tant to the president in charge of
trustee affairs. "The variety among
the trustees is such that there is con
siderable discussion on varying
views on any point."

Despite the diversity among the
trustees," there are not many issues
on which the Board of Trustees has
great differences of opinion," trus
tee Armin Rosencranz said.
Few votes
"Votes don't happen very often,"
Rosencranz explained. "Typically
there are one or two votes per meet
ing. Usually it's a process of discus
sion among the trustees and some
kind of consensus is reached."
According to President Richard
Lyman, "the principal function of the
trustees is one of insisting on ac
countability of the staff," which is
basically a "preserving and conserv
ing function."
"Trustees are like directors of a
corporation. We don't intervene
regularly in policy activities. Basi
cally, we choose the president and
ratify his staff choices; they carry the
ball," Rosencranz said.
"I can't recall an instance at a
board meeting when an individual
trustee has initiated policy," he ad
ded.
Most of the initiative comes from
the administration, Lyman said.
Committee basis
"The business of the trustees is di
verse and complicated so that it isn't
practical for the entire board to do
complete homework on all of these
subjects," Ayer said. Therefore, the
Board functions on a committee
basis.
The majority of policy issues are
first brought up in University com
mittees. They are then taken to one
of the four trustee committees: in
vestments, finance and develop
ment, land and buildings, and
academic affairs.
"A lot of the real intensive
homework on a given area is done by
the members of that committee.

Then recommendations are taken to
the full board," Ayer said.
Student members
Each of the trustee committees has
two students and two faculty mem
bers, except for the investments
committee, which is smaller and has
only one student and one faculty
member.
Every trustee serves on the
academic affairs committee, nine
trustees serve on the investments
committee, and all trustees serve on
one of the other two committees.
Board of Trustees President Peter
Bing and Lyman serve as ex-officio
members of all committees. In addi
tion, the ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) acts as "observers" on the
committees, unable to vote.
According to Fred Estes, a graduate
student in administrative policy
analysis, a member of the land and
building committee and a newly
elected member of the COP, the
committee meetfngs are run effi
ciently with a "collegial atmos
phere."
Students are full members of the
committees and have "as much
chance as anyone else" to express
their views, he said.
Trustees receptive
Estes said the trustees seem "very
receptive" to student committee
members' views. "What's important
is the quality of what the person says,
not who says it."
Finance and Development Com
mittee member Chris Seaver, a
J.D.-M.B.A. student, said the com
mittees use indirect leadership.
"There's a widely held impression
that these committees are executive
committees" that "delegate details
to Lyman and company," he said.
"But it's the other way around,"
Seaver explained. "The administra

tion decides what would be good
and comes to the Board of Trustees
for approval."
Judgment deferred
When there is strong disagree
ment among the trustees, they defer
judgment for several months while
they discuss it further and come to a
consensus, Seaver said.
Both Seaver and Estes said they
spend several hours a week getting
background information or prepar
ing for the committee meetings,
which are held each month before
the full Board meeting.
In addition, both said that as stu
dent representatives on the commit
tee, they feel obligated to "try to find
out what other students think."
Specific issues
However, as Seaver pointed out,
"the problem in soliciting student
opinion is that committees don't deal
in broad conceptual areas," but
rather, with more specific questions
that require knowledge of the sub
ject.
The majority of the trustees are
appointed by the Board and serve a
five-year term which is renewable
once. After their second term, they
are not eligible for re-election with
out at least a year's hiatus.
Eight of the trustees are elected by
alumni for a four-year term. At the
end of their term, they are not eligi
ble for re-election as alumni trustees,
but they may be appointed by the
Board. Alumni elections are held
every two years. Half of the alumni
trustees must be 35 years old or
younger, and the other half must be
36 or older.
The students who serve on the
committees are chosen by the ASSU
Nominations Committee, and then
must be approved by Lyman and the
Board of Trustees.

academic affairs.
"A lot of the real intensive
homework on a given area is done by
the members of that committee.

Then recommendations are taken to
the full board," Ayer said.
Student members
Each of the trustee committees has
two students and two faculty mem
bers, except for the investments
committee, which is smaller and has
only one student and one faculty
member.
Every trustee serves on the
academic affairs committee, nine
trustees serve on the investments
committee, and all trustees serve on
one of the other two committees.
Board of Trustees President Peter
Bing and Lyman serve as ex-officio
members of all committees. In addi
tion, the ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) acts as "observers" on the
committees, unable to vote.
According to Fred Estes, a graduate
student in administrative policy
analysis, a member of the land and
building committee and a newly
elected member of the COP, the
committee meetfngs are run effi
ciently with a "collegial atmos
phere."
Students are full members of the
committees and have "as much
chance as anyone else" to express
their views, he said.
Trustees receptive
Estes said the trustees seem "very
receptive" to student committee
members' views. "What's important
is the quality of what the person says,
not who says it."
Finance and Development Com
mittee member Chris Seaver, a
J.D.-M.B.A. student, said the com
mittees use indirect leadership.
"There's a widely held impression
that these committees are executive
committees" that "delegate details
to Lyman and company," he said.
"But it's the other way around,"
Seaver explained. "The administra

tion decides what would be good
and comes to the Board of Trustees
for approval."
Judgment deferred
When there is strong disagree
ment among the trustees, they defer
judgment for several months while
they discuss it further and come to a
consensus, Seaver said.
Both Seaver and Estes said they
spend several hours a week getting
background information or prepar
ing for the committee meetings,
which are held each month before
the full Board meeting.
In addition, both said that as stu
dent representatives on the commit
tee, they feel obligated to "try to find
out what other students think."
Specific issues
However, as Seaver pointed out,
"the problem in soliciting student
opinion is that committees don't deal
in broad conceptual areas," but
rather, with more specific questions
that require knowledge of the sub
ject.
The majority of the trustees are
appointed by the Board and serve a
five-year term which is renewable
once. After their second term, they
are not eligible for re-election with
out at least a year's hiatus.
Eight of the trustees are elected by
alumni for a four-year term. At the
end of their term, they are not eligi
ble for re-election as alumni trustees,
but they may be appointed by the
Board. Alumni elections are held
every two years. Half of the alumni
trustees must be 35 years old or
younger, and the other half must be
36 or older.
The students who serve on the
committees are chosen by the ASSU
Nominations Committee, and then
must be approved by Lyman and the
Board of Trustees.

Clear, sunny and hot weather made the Memorial Day weekend that much nicer
for students here. Many took to water-related activities on Lake Lagunita such as
windsurfing, sailing, swimming and sunning in the 90-degree afternoons.
Do you know how many trustees
there are, how they are selected, or
how the Board of Trustees makes its
decisions? If not, you are not alone.
Ever since the board was organized
in 1885, with only 15 members, stu
dents have had misconceptions
about it and its operations.
The board now consists of 34
members who meet nine times a
year.
According to trustee William Ayer,
"there's a substantial diversity of in
terest among the trustees which
makes for excellent decisions. It's
not 34 businessmen marching in
lock-step with briefcases."
"It's unfair to everyone to blow up
the notion of monolithic groups,"
commented Robert HamrJia, assis
tant to the president in charge of
trustee affairs. "The variety among
the trustees is such that there is con
siderable discussion on varying
views on any point."

Despite the diversity among the
trustees," there are not many issues
on which the Board of Trustees has
great differences of opinion," trus
tee Armin Rosencranz said.
Few votes
"Votes don't happen very often,"
Rosencranz explained. "Typically
there are one or two votes per meet
ing. Usually it's a process of discus
sion among the trustees and some
kind of consensus is reached."
According to President Richard
Lyman, "the principal function of the
trustees is one of insisting on ac
countability of the staff," which is
basically a "preserving and conserv
ing function."
"Trustees are like directors of a
corporation. We don't intervene
regularly in policy activities. Basi
cally, we choose the president and
ratify his staff choices; they carry the
ball," Rosencranz said.
"I can't recall an instance at a
board meeting when an individual
trustee has initiated policy," he ad
ded.
Most of the initiative comes from
the administration, Lyman said.
Committee basis
"The business of the trustees is di
verse and complicated so that it isn't
practical for the entire board to do
complete homework on all of these
subjects," Ayer said. Therefore, the
Board functions on a committee
basis.
The majority of policy issues are
first brought up in University com
mittees. They are then taken to one
of the four trustee committees: in
vestments, finance and develop
ment, land and buildings, and
academic affairs.
"A lot of the real intensive
homework on a given area is done by
the members of that committee.

Then recommendations are taken to
the full board," Ayer said.
