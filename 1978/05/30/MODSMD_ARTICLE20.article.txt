Shrine Game
Stanford (AP) — The 54th
East-West Shrine football game
will be played in Stanford
Stadium after all.
A few weeks after it had been
announced that the Shrine was
looking for a new game site,
Stanford Athletic Director )oe
Ruetz said Wednesday that an
agreement had been made to
play the game at Stanford next
)an. 6.
Earlier, Shrine officials said
the game would be moved be
cause Stanford could offer no
acceptable available dates. But
they were unable to find
another suitable site on a bet
ter date.
The East-West game has
been played at Stanford the
past three years and drawn
some of the best crowds in its
history.
Jordan at tournament
Barbara Jordan will be the
sole Cardinal representative at
the United States Tennis As
sociation (USTA) Women's Na

tional Collegiate Champion
ships held at Trinity University
May 29-June3. Jordan, who en
tered the competition of her
own accord, will face some
top-notch collegiate competi
tion.
The USTA tournament is ac
tually the first of two national
women's collegiate champion
ships. The other is sponsored
by the AIAW and will be held
June 4 to 12 in Salisbury, Mary
land.
In order to compete in the
AIAW tournament, teams and
individuals must qualify for a
certain region. The USTA tour
nament on the other hand,
may be entered by any col
legiate team or individual
without special qualification.
Although athletes may com
pete in both tournaments,
Stanford decided against send
ing an entire team to the USTA
championships.
The AIAW-sponsored tour
nament is now recognized as
the primary national competi
tion, due to the organization's

comprehensive support of
women's athletics. Until two
years ago, however, the AIAW
did not sponsor a national ten
nis championship and the
USTA filled that void.
Since the two competitions
conflict, Stanford women's
coach Ann Could said that the
USTA may discontinue their
competition in light of the
wider recognition of the AIAW.
