# Cardinals sweep tourney
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's first division
soccer team won its own
tournament, the third an
nual Stanford Invitational,
by defeating UC-Santa Bar
bara 2-0 in yesterday's fi
nals.
The victory gives the Car
dinals a very impressive
17-1-1 record for the season
and a 53-7-1 mark for the last
three years. This is the third
straight year that Stanford
has won the tourney.
The expected field of 12
teams was reduced to 10
Friday night when UCLA
and the University of Col
orado dropped out. The
Cards' second team
finished ninth in the com
petition, losing to Hayward
State 3-0 on Saturday and to
UC-Santa Cruz 4-1 on Sun
day. The li s gained a victory
over Santa Clara University
by forfeit.
In reaching the finals, the
I's beat Santa Cruz 9-0
Saturday morning and then
defeated Oregon State that
afternoon 5-1. The Cards
shut out Hayward State on
Sunday 6-0.
Against Santa Cruz, Ellen
Griep had a hat trick, Lisa
Steinkamp had two goals,
Kris McGarrey scored twice,
and Kathy Kelley and Sonja
Schoeppel each had one
goal. In the match against
the Beavers, McGarrey had
a hat trick and Cindy Shor
ney scored twice. McGarrey
also had a hat trick in the
Hayward game, along with a
pair of goals by Shorney and
one by Griep.
Contrasting with these
previous games, the scoring
in yesterday's final match
up was fittingly ac
complished by Julie Zender
and fullback Kelly Scott.
Zender put the Cards ahead
on a beautiful head shot 34
minutes into the game, and
Scott gave the team more
breathing room by scoring

eight minutes into the sec
ond half.
Refusing to get discour
aged after missing several
previous scoring oppor
tunities, Zender explained,
"It always feels better if you
keep trying and when you
finally win or do something
well it really feels all the bet
ter. You've got to keep
pushing — it only pays off
once in a while, but when it
does it feels really good."
While Zender's goal
typified the forward playing
style, Scott's goal
exemplified the emphasis
the coaches place on over
lapping, especially between
the fullback and midfield
lines.
Fullbacks important
"This whole season has
been arranged around the
fact that we did have these
fantastic outside fullbacks.
We've worked on overlaps
all season long and finally
we overlapped and had the
fullbacks put it in the net,"
said coach Phil Wright.
"That was the game I
should have done it in,"
Scott commented on her
first career goal. "I was very
surprised at the time. We
(the defense) were keeping
the ball out of our half really
well. I think wedid very well
— the whole team."
While the offense obvi
ously performed quite well
— coming up with 22 goals
in four games — the often
unspoken heroes are the
defenders. Allowing only
one goal in four games, the
Card defense was marked
by good communication.
"Our defense has been
working together really well
lately, covering for other
people and talking a lot. It
helps so much to talk back
here because everybody
knows what you're doing,"
said goalie Lynn McComb.
For the ll's, the tourna
ment was a learning experi

ence, an introduction to the
first division level of play
which will prove valuable
for the players that advance
to the I's next year.
"We entered the tourna
ment with the expectation
that the teams would be
more experienced than us
and also faster since the
(first) teams tend to be a col
lection of the best women
athletes in the schools. It
was especially nice to be
complimented by the first
division teams, saying 'for a
second division team,
you're an extremely good
team,' " said I I's head coach
John Jenke.
Defense comes through
"I'm extremely satisfied
with our defensive play.
Betsy Lovekin's leadership
was instrumental. Also the
incredible strength of our
outside fullbacks Mary Van
Maren and Elaine Erickson
— they were able to contain
their assignments com
pletely," Jenke added.
While admitting that he
needs to further develop
the li s offense, Jenke cited
forwards Kathy Lahanas and
Margaret Deuchar for their
play.
"Kathy Lahanas did a tre
mendous job on offense.
She developed moves
throughout the year that
enabled her to establish
herself as certainly a starter
for other universities. Un
fortunately we have a very
strong first division team so
someone like Kathy is not
able to step in and get the
playing time. That's why we
entered the tournament, to
give people like Kathy that
experience."
"Margaret Deuchar also
played an excellent game,
scored the (I I's) lone goal of
the tournament and created
many opportunities," Jenke
said.

mendous job on offense.
She developed moves
throughout the year that
enabled her to establish
herself as certainly a starter
for other universities. Un
fortunately we have a very
strong first division team so
someone like Kathy is not
able to step in and get the
playing time. That's why we
entered the tournament, to
give people like Kathy that
experience."
"Margaret Deuchar also
played an excellent game,
scored the (I I's) lone goal of
the tournament and created
many opportunities," Jenke
said.

Stanford's first division
soccer team won its own
tournament, the third an
nual Stanford Invitational,
by defeating UC-Santa Bar
bara 2-0 in yesterday's fi
nals.
The victory gives the Car
dinals a very impressive
17-1-1 record for the season
and a 53-7-1 mark for the last
three years. This is the third
straight year that Stanford
has won the tourney.
The expected field of 12
teams was reduced to 10
Friday night when UCLA
and the University of Col
orado dropped out. The
Cards' second team
finished ninth in the com
petition, losing to Hayward
State 3-0 on Saturday and to
UC-Santa Cruz 4-1 on Sun
day. The li s gained a victory
over Santa Clara University
by forfeit.
In reaching the finals, the
I's beat Santa Cruz 9-0
Saturday morning and then
defeated Oregon State that
afternoon 5-1. The Cards
shut out Hayward State on
Sunday 6-0.
Against Santa Cruz, Ellen
Griep had a hat trick, Lisa
Steinkamp had two goals,
Kris McGarrey scored twice,
and Kathy Kelley and Sonja
Schoeppel each had one
goal. In the match against
the Beavers, McGarrey had
a hat trick and Cindy Shor
ney scored twice. McGarrey
also had a hat trick in the
Hayward game, along with a
pair of goals by Shorney and
one by Griep.
Contrasting with these
previous games, the scoring
in yesterday's final match
up was fittingly ac
complished by Julie Zender
and fullback Kelly Scott.
Zender put the Cards ahead
on a beautiful head shot 34
minutes into the game, and
Scott gave the team more
breathing room by scoring

eight minutes into the sec
ond half.
Refusing to get discour
aged after missing several
previous scoring oppor
tunities, Zender explained,
"It always feels better if you
keep trying and when you
finally win or do something
well it really feels all the bet
ter. You've got to keep
pushing — it only pays off
once in a while, but when it
does it feels really good."
While Zender's goal
typified the forward playing
style, Scott's goal
exemplified the emphasis
the coaches place on over
lapping, especially between
the fullback and midfield
lines.
Fullbacks important
"This whole season has
been arranged around the
fact that we did have these
fantastic outside fullbacks.
We've worked on overlaps
all season long and finally
we overlapped and had the
fullbacks put it in the net,"
said coach Phil Wright.
"That was the game I
should have done it in,"
Scott commented on her
first career goal. "I was very
surprised at the time. We
(the defense) were keeping
the ball out of our half really
well. I think wedid very well
— the whole team."
While the offense obvi
ously performed quite well
— coming up with 22 goals
in four games — the often
unspoken heroes are the
defenders. Allowing only
one goal in four games, the
Card defense was marked
by good communication.
"Our defense has been
working together really well
lately, covering for other
people and talking a lot. It
helps so much to talk back
here because everybody
knows what you're doing,"
said goalie Lynn McComb.
For the ll's, the tourna
ment was a learning experi

ence, an introduction to the
first division level of play
which will prove valuable
for the players that advance
to the I's next year.
"We entered the tourna
ment with the expectation
that the teams would be
more experienced than us
and also faster since the
(first) teams tend to be a col
lection of the best women
athletes in the schools. It
was especially nice to be
complimented by the first
division teams, saying 'for a
second division team,
you're an extremely good
team,' " said I I's head coach
John Jenke.
Defense comes through
"I'm extremely satisfied
with our defensive play.
Betsy Lovekin's leadership
was instrumental. Also the
incredible strength of our
outside fullbacks Mary Van
Maren and Elaine Erickson
— they were able to contain
their assignments com
pletely," Jenke added.
While admitting that he
needs to further develop
the li s offense, Jenke cited
forwards Kathy Lahanas and
Margaret Deuchar for their
play.
"Kathy Lahanas did a tre
mendous job on offense.
She developed moves
throughout the year that
enabled her to establish
herself as certainly a starter
for other universities. Un
fortunately we have a very
